Of the Soul of Man, and the Immortality thereof.
Why, since the desire to know, did corrupt the root of all mankind, did my
parents send me to School that my mind might be enriched therewith? for when
our first parents clear and sharp reasons eye, could have approached the
eternal light, as the Intellectual Angels, even then the Spirit of lies
suggests, that because they saw no Ill, therefore they were blind and breathed
into them a curious wish, which did corrupt their will: for that ill they
straight desired to know, which ill was nothing but a defect of good, which the
Devil could not show while man stood in his perfection; so that they were
first to do the Ill, before they could attain the knowledge of it; as men by
tasting poison know the power of it, by destroying themselves. Thus man did ill
to know good, and blinded reasons eye to give light to passions eye, and then
he saw those wretched shapes of misery, and woe, nakedness, shame, and poverty
by experience; Reason grew dark and could not discern the fair forms of God
and truth, and man's soul which at first was fair, spotless, and good sees her
self spotted, hanted with spirits impatient to see her own faults; therefore
turns her self outward, and sees the face of those things pleasing and
agreeable unto her senses, so that she can never meet with her self. The lights
of Heaven, which are the fair eyes of the World, they look down upon the World
to view it, and as they run and wander in the Skies, they survey all things
that are on the Center, yet the lights mine eyes, which see all objects far
and nigh, look not into this little world of mine, nor see my face in which
they are fixed since nature fails us in no needful thing, why do I want means
to see my inward self, which sight might bring me to the knowledge of my
self, which is the first degree to true wisdom, that power which gave me
ability to see externals, infused an inward light, to see my self by means of
which I might have a perfect knowledge of my own form. But as the eye can see
nothing without the light of the Sun, neither can the mind see her self without
Divine light, for how can art make that clear which is dim by nature, and the
greatest wits are Ignorant both where she is, and what she is, one thinks her
to be Air, and another fire, and another Blood, defused about the heart, and
that she is compounded of the Elements, Musicians say our souls are Harmonies;
Physicians, the complexions.

Epicures makes them swarms of Atoms, which by chance fly into our Bodies,
some again that one soul fills every man, as the Sun gives light to every
star, others that the name of soul is a vain thing, and that it is a well mixed
body: and as they differ about her substance, so, also where her seat is, some
lift her up into the Brain, others thrust her down into the stomach, some place
her in the heart, and others in the liver. Some say that she is all in all, and
all in every part, and that she is not contained, but contains all, and thus
the learned Clerks play at hazard, and let them say, it is what they will;
there be some that will maintain it, the only wise God to punish the pride of
men's wits, has therefore wrought this confusion, but he that did make the
Soul of nothing, and restored it when fallen to nothing, that so we might be
twice his* can define her subtle form and knows her nature and powers: To
judge her self she must transcend her self, for fetterd men cannot express
their strength, but now in these latter days, those Divine Mysteries which
were laid in darkness, are brought to light: and this Lamp of God which does
defuse it self through all the Region of the brain, does show the immortal
face of it.

What the soul is?
The soul is a spiritual substance, this makes the man: and every one from
this has his name and nature, and although the soul be knit to the Body, by
which it has apt means to express it self as it is life, That the soul is a
thing subsisting by it self without the body.
motion, sense, understanding, and will, yet she survives though the body dies,
she is a substance and a real thing which has an actual working might of it
self, which springs neither from the senses, nor from the good temprature of
the body, she is a vine which needs no proppinge to make her spring or spread.
She is a Star whose beams proceed from no Sun but from a Native light: when
she compares present things with those that are past, That the soul has a
proper operation without the body.
when she first doubts and then chooses, she does all these without the help of
the body, when she sees the effect in the causes, when she sees the stream,
she conjectures there must be a spring from whence it must rise; and seeing
the branches, knows it proceeds from the root: she collects and ^ewes these
without the Bodies, or senses help, she travills although the Body rest, about
the Center and Sky, and swifter then lightening or fire from East to West:
when she forms all her works within her self, and portions them, and sees
their end, when she begins them in any part, in these the body lends her no
instruments, when she works without UNDERSTANDING.
I once was Aegle ey'ed full of all light.

As through a glass or Cloud I all things view.

hands, sees without eyes, runs without feet, digests the world, and is not
filled, these miracles are done by her own power; when she refines, argues,
divides, compounds, or considers of virtue, and vice, and several things, and
marking diverse principles and grounds, does out of all bring a true conclusion;
When she uses the powers of understanding, and will retire within her self,
into her own closet, these actions she does alone without the Bodies Organs:
yet she lies in the body as in a prison, and gathers notes out of the Worlds
great Book, looking through the eyes, her windows, and exercising the powers
of the senses: and although she can neither judge nor discourse of any thing
which is not first brought in by the senses, yet the power of her discoursing
thoughts, is diverse from the senses, for although the eyes sees naught but
colors, yet colors do not give the eyes power to see, though these be the
objects of the senses, yet the soul sees then by her proper light, the workman
shows his skill in making the stuff, yet the stuff does not give the man his
skill, and although states know by their officers, yet they order all things in
their own counsels, so this Queen the soul though she hears, sees, feels,
and smells, and tastes all things through the senses, yet from her self she
judges and chooses, the senses are always attending nigh unto the Brain,
which is her court, and are ready servants unto her, For she maintains her own
state and justice like a Princess: by them she learns the outward forms of
things, and whatever objects she discerns abroad, she returns them into the
Fantasy, and enroles them there, for the mind to see them, but when she sets
to Judge between the ill or good, and to discern between truth and falsehood,
she views these in her own m^rror, not being guided by the senses, and then she
checks them because they often do err, and decrees against their false
reports, and what they prefer she condemns because she sees with a power above
them, neither does the senses receive those joys which she has in her private
contemplations, and the ravished Spirit leaves the senses, her harmonies are
sweet, and full of skill, when it plays upon the bodies instrument but the
sweet accords which it has in the understandings, (...) Joys of Angels,
these are the notes in the heavenly quier, sounding out the praises of him that
maid the earth and Heaven, her heavenly nature is seen in this that she
performs her noblest works alone, now by these her nature and operations are
known.

Then are they senseless that think the soul to be nothing but a perfection of
the senses, or a quick resulting consequence of forms, That the soul is made
th^^ a^ perfection or reflection of the sense.
which fancy does enrole, if it be so, what is it that does accuse the senses
of false judgments, and fond appetites, and makes us to choose that which the
senses refuse, and to delight in those things which are their torment: Sense
thinks the planets spheres are not much asunder, when they are far distant,
and that the lightning is born before the Thunder, and when we are on an high
hill our eyes judged men no bigger then Crows in the Bottom, and what makes
us to say our tongues are out of taste when in an ague, we say sweet things are
sower, what made Ulysses to have himself bound fast to the mast of his ship,
because he knew else he should throw himself into the Sea, as his Mariners did
when they heard the sweet songs of the Mairmaids, it was not his senses that
persuaded him to it* neither did the senses persuade Granmar to burn his right
hand because it first wrought his recantation: Doubtless there is a nature in
man far above and besides the senses, although most men being so taken up with
pleasures drown their souls in their senses, if our souls were naught but our
senses, then they should have the soundest souls, that had the most excellent
senses, whereas experience manifests, that most folly is sound in youth: and as
our senses decay, our wisdom abounds: and then every living Creature should
excel man, and be a more glorious Creature then he, but they do want that
quick discoursing power which does correct the seeing sense, else why did the
Be, light upon a painted flower, expecting to get honey, and birds pick at the
painted Grapes; sense only knows the outside, the soul looks within; sense
sees the bark, but she the life, the sapp sense hears the sound, but the soul
the concord senses are powers which the soul extends and puts forth, which
being placed in diverse parts apprehends diverse forms of objects, this power
speeds outward, but the root of it is inward; that which does perceive, for
the eyes and ears see and hear, and yet know no more then glasses know what
forms they receive whether it be beautiful or ugly, for if we chance to fix,
our thoughts else where then we see not though our eyes be open: and if on
power did not see and hear, our sighs and sounds would be doubled then we may
plainly understand that the soul is a nature which contains the power of
sense, within a greater power she employes the senses outwardly. But she sets
as a queen within and overrules all. If she then excells the senses, That the
soul is more then the temprature of the humors of the body.
how grossly are they mistaken, that drown her in the blood; or in the well
tempred humors of the body; as if that were the best musician that had the
best tuned instrument; and he the best painter that had the best colors, and
neatest pencells, and pallat on which they lay their colors, why then does not
beauty refine the wit, and good complexions rectify the will; and why does not
health bring wisdom? and sickness make brutish, how can in the memory
understanding and will find Air, Fire, or Water: what Alchymist can draw the
quintessence of these out of the mind, if the elements which have neither life
nor sense can breed in us such a power, why do they not give it other things
in which they are mixed; if she were but the bodies quality, why is she not
with it sick, and ma'md, and blind; but we see a healthy, more perfect, and
sharp sighted mind in a mamed body, which if she did partake of the bodies
nature, she would decay with the body, but when the outward man perishes, the
inward man is renewed, if she were but the bodies accident, as whiteness in
Snow, she might absent her self from the Bodies substance and not be miste,
but it on her, she not on it depends; for she sustaines and cherishes it, she
lends it such secret powers of life, that when they fail the body perishes,
That the soul is a Spirit.
and sithence she works alone by her self, and springs not from sense and well
tempred humors she is a substance and a perfect being, her nature is peculiar,
and her own. But although spirit be the root of sense, yet sense knows her not
because she only knows bodies; but, the soul is a Heavenly influence which
flows from her fountain, the Spirit of God, yet neither like Air or Wind nor
like the spirits about the heart and brain, nor like the spirits that
Alchymists fetch out of every thing, She passes all natures under Heaven, being
like the Angels, which do always behold the face of God; or like him whose
Image she bore in her Creation, that it cannot be a body.
though now scarce the lest shadow of him* and though she holds the first
degree of those forms that are knit to material bodies, yet is she bodilesse,
and free, and almost infinite; although confind in the body, if she were a
body, how could she be contained in that which is less then her self? or how
could she the worlds great shape contain* and yet be brought in our narrow
breasts; all bodies are confind in some place, but she confines all places:
within her bodies have their space and measure; but her MEMORY.
A com^on Jnne all com^ers to reteyne.
A Sieve where good run^e out and bad remain.
A Burrow with a thousand vermin hydes.
A Den where nothing that is good abides
demensive line who can draw? bodies cannot admit of two forms at once, one
must of necessity destroy the other; but in the soul ten thousand forms do
sit, and none of them extrude the other: All bodies are filled with other bodies,
but she receives both heaven and earth together, and their forms neither touch
nor destroy each other: nor can her wide embracements be filled, for those that
embrace the greatest things, do thereby enlarge the capacities of their
minds, as large streams enlarge the space of the channel: All things received
do take such proportion as those things are capable of wherein they are
received, as little glasses show forth but little faces, and on narrow frames,
you can weave but narrow webbs* Then what vast body must we make the mind
wherein stands Beasts, Trees, Towns, Land, and Seas; and yet each thing has
his proper place, and stands in its true proportion: Doubtless this could not
be, but that by a strange sublimation she turns bodies into spirits, as fire
converts to fire, and as our stomachs changes that we eat into our natures;
from their gross matter she abstracts the forms, and draws a kind of
Quintessence from them, which she transformes to her proper nature, that she
may lightly bare them on her celaestiall wings.

This she does when from particular things she abstracts the Universal kinds;
which are immateriall and bodilesse, and can be lodged no where else but in the
mind. And thus from diverse acts and accidents which fall within her
observation; she abstracts divine power and virtue; again, how can she know
several bodies if she were a body; the eye cannot see all colors at once, nor
the tongue relish all tastes at one time, but successively: nor can we judge of
Passion except we be free from all passions, nor can a Judge execute his office
well if he be possessed of either party, if lastly this quick power were a body,
were it as swifte as fire or wind, which blows the on one way, and makes the
other a spier, her nimble body yet in time must move, and not slide through all
places at an instant, she is nigh and far above, beneath, in point of time
which thought cannot devide, she is as soon sent to China, as to Spain, and
returns as soon as sent, she as soon measures the heavens as an ell of Silk.

As then the soul has a substance besides the body in which she is confinde;
so has she not a body of her own, but is a spirit, and a mind immateriall.

Since the body and soul have such diversities, we may very well muse how this
match began: but that the Scripture tells us, That the soul is created
i^mediately by God, Zach. 12.1.
Zachariah 12.1. says the Lord, which stretches forth the Heavens, and lays
the foundations of the Earth, and forms the Spirit of man within him* he
makes the body of Earth, and in it a beam of heavenly fire, now in the womb
before the birth, Erroneus opinions of the Creation of souls.
inspires in all men their souls, and without a mother sends daily millions
into the world which neither from eternity, nor at once in one time lay them up
in the Sun or Moon, nor in some secret cloister where they sleep till they
be awaked, neither did he make at first a certain number, infusing part in
beasts, and part in men, and being unwilling to take further pain would make no
more; so that the widow soul should be married to the next body that should be
born, and so by often changing men's souls should pass from beasts to men, these
are fond thoughts; since there are far more born then dye, then thousand souls
should be abortive, or others deaths should supply their souls; but as nature
Gods handmaid does create bodies in time distinct and in due order, so God
gives souls the like successive date, which himself forms in new bodies,
which himself makes of no material thing, for unto Angels he has given no
power either to form the shape, or bring the stuff from Air or Fire, nor in
this does he use natures service, That the soul is not traduced from their
parents.
for although she can bring bodies from bodies, yet she could never traduce
souls from souls, as light springs from light, and fire from fire as some
learned fathers that were great lights of old did hold, for say they, how can
we say that God made the soul, and yet not make him the Author of her sin,
for in her lies the corruption, for Adams body did not sin but his soul, and
so brought the body to corruption, So we would fain make him the Author of the
wine, if we knew whom to blame for her dreggs; none were yet so gross, as to
contend for this, that souls may be traduced from bodies, between whose
natures there is no proportion, but many subtle wits have justified that souls
may spiritually spring from souls, which if the nature of the soul be tried
would even in nature prove as gross, for all things that are made are either
of naught, or of something that is already made of naught, no Creature ever
formed ought, for that is proper for the Almighty; if then the soul make
another soul, she must take it of some former stuff or matter, but there is
no matter found in the soul: Reasons drawn from nature.
then if her heavenly form do not agree with any matter in the World, then
must she needs be created of nothing, and that is only proper to God alone;
again, if souls do beget souls, it is either by themselves, or the bodies
power, if by themselves what hinders them but that they may engender souls
every hour, if by the body, how can understanding and will join with the body
in this act; only since when they do their other works, they do abstract them
themselves from the body; moreover, if souls were begotten of souls, they
should move and change into each other, but motion and changes brings at last
corruption, and then how should it be immortal? If lastly souls did use
generation, then they should spread incorruptible seed; and then what becomes
of that which they do loose, when the acts of generation do not speed? but if
the soul could cast spiritual seed yet she would not, because she never dies;
mortal things desire to breed their like that so they might immortalize their
kind, therefore the Angels who are called the sons of God neither marry nor
are given in marriage, their spirits and ours are of one substance, Matthew 19.
and have one father the Lord of Heaven. Who would at first that in each other
thing, earth, and water, living souls should breed, but man's soul which he
would make their king, should immediately be produced from himself; and
doubtless when he took the Woman from the side of the man, he alone inspierd
the soul, for it is not said he did devide man's soul, but took flesh of his
flesh, and bone of his bone; and lastly, God being made man for man's sake, and
like him in all, save only in sin, took his body from the womb of the Virgin
but all agree, God formed his soul within* him then is the soul from God, so
say the Pagans which saw by natures light, her heavenly kind, naming her kin
to God, and Gods bright ray, a Citizen of Heaven, confind to the earth.

Reason drawn from divinity.
This cloud may be further cleerd by heavenly light, for questionless God made
her, and made her good, and ingrafted her in the body there to grow, which
though it be corrupted flesh and blood, yet can it not bring corruption to the
soul; yet this soul at first made good by God, and not corrupted by the evil
of the body, yet in the womb is accursed and sinful ere she can judge by wit or
choose by will, yet God is not the Author of her sin, though of her being; and
if we dare judge him in this, he can condemn us, and yet be clear himself,
first God from eternity decreed, what has been, is, or shall be done, and that
every man in his turn should run his race of life, and did purpose to make all
souls that ever have been or shall be, and that they should take there being
in humane bodies, or not to be at all; was it then fit that such a weak event,
weakness it self, the sin and fall of man should prevent his execution, and
counsels fixed, and decreed before the world began, and that one penal law
broke by Adam, should make God break his own eternal law; and revoke the
settled order of the world, and change all forms of things which he foresaw;
could Eves weak hand extended to the Tree, rent a sunder that Adamantive
chain, whose golden linkes of causes and effects remain fixed to Gods own
chare; O could we see how cause does spring from cause, how they are mutually
linckt and foulded, and that on disagreeing stringe does rather make then mar
the harmony, and at once view how death is brought by sin, and how a better
life does arise by death, how in one his justice is seen, and his mercy in the
other, we would praise this his decree a wise and right: but we measure time by
first and last, and see the sight of things successively, when the Lord sees
all at once and at an instant he sees all things in himself as in a glass,
for from him, and by him, and through him are all things. His sight is not
discorsive by degrees, but he seeing the whole, sees every single heart. He
looks on Adam as a root, or spring and on all his heirs as Branches, and
streams; and sees all men as one man, though they dwell in sundry Nations and
Cit^es; and as root and branch makes but one Tree, and the spring and stream
make but one River, so that if one be corrupted the other is corrupted also; So
when the Root and Fountain of man kind did draw corruption and Gods curse by
sin, this was a charge that did bind all his off-springe, and so they all grew
corrupted: as when the hand sins, the man offendes, for part from whole in
this, the law does not sever: so Adams sin extends to whole mankind, for all
natures are but part of his Therefore this sin of kind was not personal, but
real and hereditary; the guile and punishment whereof must pass by course of
nature and law: for as that easy law was given to all, to Ancestor, to heir
first and last, so the transgression was general, in our law we see some foot
steps of this which take her root from God and nature: Ten thousand men make
but one corporation, and these and their successors are but one, and if they
gain or loose their liberties, they harm and profit not themselves alone, but
their Successors: and so the Ancestor and all his heirs, if they should
increase as the Sand, their advancements and forfitures are still but one, his
civil acts do bind and harm them all.

Is it just in us to disinherit the unborne Nephew for the fathers fault? and
for one man's merit to advance a thousand whom deserved naught; and is not Gods
decree as just as ours, if he deprive Adams sons for Adams sins, of all those
native powers and virtues, which he had given to him and to his race; for what
is this contagious sin of kind, but a privation of that grace within, and of
that rich dowery of the mind which all had received, had it not been for sin;
If then a man on light conditions gains a great estate for ever to him and
his, if wilfully again he forfeit it who bemoanes his heirs, or shames the
giver: So when God makes the soul good, rich, and fair, yet when she is joined
to the body, which makes the man, is Adams heir. Justly forthwith he takes his
grace from it, and then the soul being first brought from nothing, when Gods
grace fails, falls to nothing; and this declining, this pronenesse unto naught
is the sin that we are born withal; and we are not only deprived of the first
good qualities, but the contrary do rise, and real spots which mar the
souls beauty; neither is it strange that Adams ill desert, should be
transferred unto his guilty race, when Christ imparts his righteousness, and
grace to them that are unjust, and have no grace, and indeed the soul were
better born a slave to sin, then not to be at all; since if she do believe
Christ sets her free, and mounts her the higher for her fall: yet this will not
content men's curious wits, but they will know further if God foresaw this, why
did he not prevent it: If the Lord by his word had stayed the current of Adams
will, which was free by nature, this had been all one, as if his word had said,
I will henceforth that man should not be man, for what is man without a moving
mind, which has an understanding to judge, and will to choose, now if God should
bind this power of election, her motions would seace, and all stand still; and
why did God infuse in man this soul, but that he should know and love his
maker? now if love be compelled and cannot choose, how is it thank-worthy: love
must be free hearted, and voluntary, and not compelled, or constrained: besides
were we unchangeable in our will, and in our understanding, we might esteem
our selves equal to God whose wisdom still shines, and never erreth, so that
if man would be unvariable he There are a Crew of fellows J suppose,
That angle for their Victuals with their nose
As quick as Beagles in the smelling sense

must be as God, or as Trees and Rocks; for the perfect Angels were not
stable, but more desperate in their fall then man* Let us then praise that
power that makes, us to be men as we are, and so rest satisfied; and knowing
man's fall was curiosity, let us admire Gods counsels, which we can never
comprehend, and let us know that God is the maker of all the souls, that are in
men, and yet their corruption is no fault of his, but in the first man that
broke his decree, This substance and spirit of Gods own making, is placed and
planted there, Why the soul is united to the body.
that partaking both of God and the World, he might bear the Image of all that
is: First, God made Angels bodilesse and pure minds, then other things which
have bodies, and mindlesse; Lastly, He made man the Horizon, betwixt them both,
in whom we may see the worlds abridgment, besides the World did need one wight,
which would order all things with industry and art, and take delight therein;
and also admire God in his works, and here beneath yield him both prayer and
praise, as the Angels in heaven spreading forth his glory.

Lastly, the unreasonable creatures, the brutes, wanted a King to reign over
them, In what manner the soul is united to the body.
and thus God unites himself to the world, that the world might be
everlastingly blessed. But now how shall we express this union? nothing ties
the soul to the body which she possesses, and moves, but virtually; Then she
dwells not there as in a Tent, nor as a spider pend in its webb, nor as a
Vessel contains water in it, or as heat in the fire, or a voice in the Air,
but as the fair and cheerful morning light does impart her silver beams, here
and there, and in an instant unites her self to the transparent Air, in all
and every part, still resting whole, when noise devides the Air, and abides
pure, when the Air is corrupted most, and that not interrupted when the Air is
tossed; So does the piercing soul in the body filled, being all in all, and all in
every part, indivisible, uncorruptable, not forced, troubled or confused, and
as the Sun brings her light from above, though we behold it here below, so the
soul springes from the eternal light, although she shows forth her powers in
the body. How the soul does exercise her powers in the body
Now as the Worlds Sun does beget diverse effects every day in diverse places, as
temperate Autumn, Summers heat, Flowery springtide, and gray Winter here,
even there morning, here noon, there day, here night, melts wax dryes clay,
makes the European white, the African black, the East-Indian red, the American
tawny, so in our little world, the body, this soul Truth and a Lie did each a

and does employ her oeconomicke art, to preserve her household, in one part she
attracts, and in another part she retains, in an other she concocts, and

although the soul does not extend this power out of the body, yet she has a

yet the Organs are but five, by which we can see, hear, taste, feel, or smell;

soulds do much restrain it, that it may more gently touch the Organ: as
streams stopped by their Creekes, and winding bank, run softly through the
plain, so does the voice stray through the ears laborinth, and with easy
motion touch the Brain, it is the slowest yet the daintiest sense; for the
ears of such as have no skill, quickly perceive a discord, and conceive
offense, not knowing what is wright, although they perceive a wrong, her
proper object is men's speech, and not music, and to hear what Gods Herralds
speak by his spirit in the Church to the Churches, our eyes have eyelids, but
our ears are still open, showing we should be quick to hear: Our eyes still
move, our ears unmovable to teach us not to be quickly moved. Thus by the eye
and ear the soul does endew her self with knowlegde, and having all the world
to view she may with the more comfort, bear her prison, these conduit-pipes of
true knowledge fed the mind, but the other three senses do still attend the
body: and by them the soul does find what is good, or ill for it; The bodies
life with meats and Air is fed, Tasting.
and therefore does use the tasting power, which through the tongue and pallat,
relish and distinguish betwixt sweet and sour, and spread by it into the
veins, this is the bodies Nurse, but the Art of Cookery, which is to make
meats the more pleasing to the taste, more bodies are consumed and killed with
it then the Sword or Famine.

Smelling.
Next she uses the smell in the nostrels, as into them at first God breathed
life, so now he makes his power to dwell in them, to judge of all Aires whereby
we live and breath, this sense is Mistress of an Art, to sell sweet perfumes
to soft people, yet it imparts but little good, for they have the best smell
that cannot away with any perfumes, yet good sents do awake the fancy, refine
the wit, and purify the Brain, and old devotions did use incense to make men's
spirits, more apt for divine thoughts.

Feeling.
Lastly, the power of feeling which is life's root, which does shed it self
through every living part, and extends it self from head to foot by sinews;
as a net covering all the body, or much like a spider which sets in the
midst of her web, and if the outmost thread of it be touched she instantly
feels it by the touch; we discern what is hard, smooth, rough, what is hot, and
cold, and dry, and moist, The Immagination or common sense.
these are the outward instruments of the soul, and the Guards by which every
thing must pass into the Soul, or aproacheth unto the minds intelligence, or
touch wits looking-glass; the Fantasy, yet these Porters which admit all
things themselves, neither discern nor perceive them, one Common power which
sits in the forehead brings together all their proper forms; For all those
Nerves which carry spirits of Sense, and go spreading themselves to the
outward Organ, are there united as their Center, and there they know by this
power those sundry forms, the outward Organs present things do receive, the
inward sense retain the things that are absent, for she straightwayes
transmits what she perceives unto the higher Region of the Brain.

Where sits the Fantasy which is the hand maid near to the mind, and so
beholds and discerns them all, The Fantasy.
and things that are diverse in their kind compounds in one: weighs them in
her Balance, and so some she esteems good, and some ill, and some things
neuterall, neither good nor bad, this busy power is working night and day,
when the outward senses are at rest, a thousand light and fantastical dreams
with their fluttering wings keeps her still awake; yet all are not always
before her, The sensative memory.
she successively intends this and that, and what she cease to see she
commits to the large volume of the memory; This Lidger Book lies behind in the
Brain, like Janus eye, seated in the Poll, and is the storehouse of the mind,
which much remembers and forgets more, here senses apprehension ends as a stone
cast into the Pond of Water, one Circle makes another, till at last it touches
the Bank. The passions of sense.
But although the apprehensive power do pawse, yet the motive virtue is lively,
and causes passions in the heart, as joy, grief, fear, hope, love, and hate;
and these passions bring forth diverse actions in our lives, for all actions
without the light of reason proceed from passion; but since the powers of sense
lodge in the Brain, how comes passions from the heart, it arises from the
mutual love and kind intelligence betwixt the Brain and the Heart. From the
kind heat which raigns in the heart, from thence the spirits of life takes
their beginning, these spirits of life ascending to the brain causes a
sensablenesse, and imediately judges whether it be good or ill, and sends down
to the heart where all affections dwell a good or ill report, and if it be
good, it causes love, and longing hope, and well assured joy; If it be ill, it
anoyes the heart with vexing grief, and trembling, fear, and hatred. Now if
these natural affections were good, or if we had such strength of reason, and
especially grace for to rectify natures passion we might be happy, and not so
often miscarry as we do, for we were but blocks without them; besides there
arises another motive power out of the heart, Motion of life.
which are the vital spirits, born in arteries, and causes continual motion
in all parts, Local motion.
it makes the pulses to beat, and lunges respier, and holds the sinews like
a Bridle, so that the body retires; or advances, turns or stops as she strains
or slackens them, thus the soul tunes the bodies instrument, with life and
sense fit instruments, being sent by the body, although the actions do flow
from the souls influence, The Intellectual powers of the soul.
sometimes I will this, yet I have not a power to express the working of the
wit and will, for though their root be knit to the body, yet use not the body
when they use their skill.

These powers do declare the nature of the soul, for these are only proper to
man, for on earth there are none else that have these heavenly powers but man.
The understanding, the souls Pupil, The wit or understanding.
and the only shining Star in this little world: looks in the Fantasy where
are all the gatherings of the senses, and from thence abstracts the shapes of
things, and so receives them in her passive part, which are enlightened by that
part which acts, and so the forms of single things perceives, and afterward by
discoursing to and fro, Reason
anticipating and comparing things, she knows the nature of all things, and
the effects of all things by their causes, when she rates things, and moves
from ground to ground, by well weighing of things, by this she obtaines the
name of Reason, and when by reasoning she has found the truth, and stands
fixed, then is she called understanding, Understanding.
but when she lightly enclines to either part, and is dubious, Opinion.
that is opinion, but when from sound principles, and a certain truth she
defines any thing, then has she the name of true judgment, Judgment.
and as reason springs from sense, so strength of reason gains understanding,
and when we thoroughly understand any thing, that makes knowledge, and by acting
our knowledge we declare our wisdom. So by many stares or steps we obtain to
the highest degree of wisdom: So does this earth Eclipse the light of reason,
which else we might be at an instant like the Angels. The soul
notwithstanding has a natural dowry, and sparks of light to see common
things not altogether Blank, where there is nothing but what is written in it,
for it will naturally excuse or accuse, and can say, this is good, and that
bad, and the sparklings thereof are infinite, almost making the world, and all
things in it, her food, and spreads it self like fire, being still nourished
with new supplies, and although sin has almost quenched these sparkles, yet
whom that just one has justified, they have them increased with heavenly light
within them, like the Widows oil that increased WILL.
Free to all ill, till freed to none but ill

as we have an understanding which should know good, so also we have a will
that should choose it, but the mind being blinded we take ill for good, and
good for ill, will puts in practice what is devised by the wit, one ever
contemplates, and the other acts, will is the Prince, and knowledge the
Counselor which sets in counsel for the common good of the man, The Relations
between Wit and Will.
and when the understanding is resolved, the will lends her power to execute
what is advised by it: Wit is the minds chief Judge which controuls the
judgment of fances court to be false and vain. Will holds the Royal Scepter of
the soul, and reigns over the passions of the heart; will is as free as an
Emperor, nothing can restrain her liberty, no Tyrant, nor torment has power
to make her will what she is unwilling.

To these high powers there is a storehouse, The Intellectual memory.
where lies all Arts, and general reasons which remain unto the soul even
after death which cannot be washed away by any Loethean flood of forgetfulness.

This is the soul and these be her virtues, which although they have their
sundry proper ends, and one exceed another, yet each one do mutually depend on
the other, our understanding is given us to know God, and he being known, our
will is given us to love him, but he could not be known to us here below, but
by his word and works which we receive through the senses, and as the
understanding reapes the fruit of sense, so the quickening power feeds the
senses, and while they do thus dispense their several powers, the best needs
the service of the least, even as the King serves the Magistrate, and the
commons feed them both, the Magistrate preserves the commons by the power they
have from their Prince; The quickening power would be, and there it rests, the
senses are not contented only to be, but would be well, but the soul desires
endless felicity; these three powers do make three sorts of men, for one sort
of men desire as plants only to fill themselves, and some like beasts think the
world is only to take their pleasure in it, and some men as Angels love to live
in contemplation, therefore the (...) turned some men into flowers, others into
beasts, (...) to Angels, which still travill, and still rest. Yet these three
powers are not three souls, but one as one, and two or both contained in
three, 3 being one number by it self alone; a shadow of the blessed Trinity.

These meditations may draw from us this acclamation, What is man that thou
adornest him with so bright a mind, An Acclamation.
made him over all thy creatures a King, and an Angels Peer? O what have thou
inspierd into this dying flesh, what a heavenly life, power, and lively life,
spreading virtue, and a sparkling fire! In other works of thine thou leavest
thy print, but in man have written thine own Image; there cannot be a creature
more divine, this exceeds man's thought, to consider how highly God has raised
man, since God became man, the Angels are astonished when they view and admire
this mystery, That the soul is immortal, and cannot dye.
neither has he endowed man with these blessings for a day, neither do they
depend on this life, for though the soul was made in time, yet lives for aye,
and though it had a beginning, yet has no end Her only end, is never ending
bliss, and that consists in beholding the eternal face of the Almighty, who
is the first of causes, and last of ends, and to do this she must needs be
eternal, then how senseless or dead a soul has he that thinks his soul dies
with his body, or if he think not so, yet would fain have it so, that he might
sin with the more security; Although light and vicious persons say our souls
are but a smoke, or Aerie blast, which while we live plays within our
nostrills, and when he dies turns to wind, although they say so, yet they know
not what to think, for ten thousand doubts do arise in their minds, and
although they strive against their consciences, there are some sparks in their
flintey breasts, which cannot be extinct, which though fain they would, yet
cannot be beasts; but whosoever makes a merror of his mind* and with patience
views himself within, shall clearly see the souls eternity, though all other
beauties of the soul be defaced because of his sin.

For first, Reason 1. Drawn from the desire of knowledge.
we find an appetite in every man's mind to learn and know the truth of every
thing, this is connaturall and born with him, on which the essence of the soul
depends, she has a native might with this desire to find out the truth of
every thing, if she had time the innumerable effects to sort a^ight, and to
climb by degrees from cause to cause; but sithence our lives slide so fast
away through the wind, as the hungry Eagle, or as the ships which leaves no
print of their passage, of which swifte little time we spend while some things
we strain through the senses, that our short race of life is ended ere we can
attain the principles of skill, so that either God who has made nothing in
vain, in vain has given this appetite and Flower, or else our knowledge which
is begun here, must be perfected in heaven. To one whole kind the Allmighty
never gave a power, but most part of that kind did use the same, as though
some eyes be blind, yet most eyes can see perfectly, so though some be lame in
their limbs, yet most can walk, but no soul can know the truth in this life
so perfectly, as it has power to do; if then perfection is not to be found
here below, he must ascend higher where it is to be obtained. Again, how can
she but be immortal, Reason 2. Drawn from the Motion of the Soul.
when with the motion of her will and understanding she still aspiers to
eternity, and is never at rest tell she attaineth thereunto; water in conduit
pipes can arise no higher then the well head, from which they spring.

Therefore since she does aspier to the Almighty she must be eternal, the
nature of all moveable things, are to move to things of their own kind, as the
earth downward, and the fire ascends tell both touch their proper elements; The
Soul compared to a River.
and as the thirsty earth suckes her moisture from the Sea to fill her empty
veins, and so glides along her grassie plains, she stays long as loath to
leave the land, out of whose sides she came, she tastes all places, and turns on
every hand, unwilling to forsake her flowery banks, yet nature does so carry
and lead her streams, that she makes no final stay tell she return into the
bosom of the Ocean. Even so the Spirit of God does secretly infuse into this
earthy mould our souls, which at first does behold this world, and at first
her mothers earth she holds dear, and embracerh the world and worldly things,
she flies close to the earth, and hovers here, and mounts not up with her
celestial wings, and cannot light on any thing which does agree with her
heavenly nature, she cannot rest nor fix her thoughts, neither can she be
contented with any thing, for who ever found it in honor, wealth, or pleasure;
and having his health, ceased to wish, or having wisdom, was not vexed in
mind, as a Be that lights on every flower, and sucks and tastes on all, but
being pleased with none at last arises and sores away, like Noah's dove flies
into the Arc from whence she came.

The understanding ascends from cause to cause, and never rests tell it attain
to truth, the will never rests till it has found good now God the truth and
first of causes is and because he still lasts, is the last good end, and for
this is named Alpha and Omega, ascribing to the understanding Alpha, and for
our will Omega, and When Hearing, Seeing, Tasting, Smelling's past:
Feeling (as long as life remains) does last
Maid reach my Lute, J am not well indeed:
O pitty-mee, my Bird has made me bleed.
sithence she does bewray her heavenly kind, in that she does directly move to
God, and can stay on no mortal thing, she cannot be from below, but from
above; and yet this first true cause and last good end, she cannot hear truly,
see nor hear, she must attend for this perfection, and be espoused to her
maker, and as a Kings daughter being sought to by diverse of her neighbor
Princes, can fix a constant thought on none, although she lend her ear to all;
yet can she love a foreign Emperor, of whom she hears of his great power and
worth, if she be wooed by his Ambassador, and letters, or see his picture, for
she well knows, if she be brought into that Kingdom, where her spouse does
reign, she shall see that which before she conceived in thought, of him, of his
glory, train, and state, and person So while the Virgin soul, while she stays
on the Earth, is wooed and tempted ten thousand ways, by these great powers
which sway the earth, the wisdom of the earth, wealth, pleasure, and praise,
and with these she does beguile her time, and by fits these possess her
Fantasy, but within a while distastes them all, and finds a tediousness in
them, but if she once fix her humble loving thoughts upon the worlds Almighty
King, and see his picture drawn in every thing, and be wooed by his
Ambassadors the Ministers, and can taste his letters in his word written* she
thinks on him, and cannot think too much on him, this honey tasted, is ever
sweet, the pleasure of her ravished thought is such, as she almost meets with
her bliss. But when she shall see his Essence in Heaven, this will be her
sovereign good, and perfect bliss, her longings, wishings, hopes be all
finished; her joys are full, and in this her motion rests, she is crowned with
the Garland of content, feeds on Manna, th^s presence does present such high
delights, as neither tongue can speak or heart can think.

Reason 3. from contempt of death in the better sort of spirit.
For this many holy ones have despised death, and did rather desire it, for when
the burdened balance comes to the ground, the lighter scale mounts the higher
by it. But if the bodies death should kill the soul, death must needs be
against her nature, and were it so, all souls would still fly it, for nature
shuns, her contrariety, for all things which nature brings forth, are chiefly
taught to preserve their being, for although some things desire a change, yet
none seek their destruction, and to turn to naught, and be annihilated, and if
by death the soul were extinguished, she could not thus run against her
nature, since every senseless thing does seek her preservation, and not
destruction, neither could the worlds best spirits, if death took all, yet all
to agree, in this to prefer a good conscience, and there honor, and praise
before their lives, for what is glory and praise to them that are annihilated,
she would then only seek the Bodies good, and not the souls good, none would
adventure unto the wars and Seas; Doubtless they that think of death with
quiet minds, they have surviving thoughts but a trembling horror on the
thoughts of those that fear of being turned to naught, and as holy ones making
nothing of death, show that they do not dye. So evil men fearing the face of
death, prove the eternity of their soul, for wicked men would not fear, Reason
4. From the fear of death in the wicked souls.
if they might be quite exstinguished, they would be glad of that lot, if no
hurt should come upon it, but she fears what may befall her hereafter, for the
law of nature accurseth her within and s^ith, that it is affirmed of all, that
there is a pain for sin after death; then she thar has been hoodwinckt from
the womb, does first see her self within deaths mirror, and so takes care how
she may live alone, when her body returns to the earth, and how ever sees these
irreligious men, when they waxt faint, and burdoned with sickness do not then
begin to think of God, and make vows and protestations? And hardly any
Atheist when he comes to the Gibbet, but begins to bless that power, which all
his life time before he had set at naught, these light and vain men that are
all their youth drunk and mad with surfeitings, and pleasures* at their deaths,
are sober, fresh, and sad, and then begin to discern and speak the truth, Then
if all souls, good and bad with general voice do teach that souls can never
dye, it is not man's flattering gloss, but natures speech that is Gods oracle,
that never lies. Reason From t^ ^nerall of immorta^ty.
All men generally have strong desires after immortality, and in this all are
united, then this desire in nature is not invain, she covets not
impossibilities; from hence springs that general care and study of future
things, that men can find no joy in things present, hence is that main desire
of surviving fame by memorable dead tombs* and books, for she must still
remain that desires this. Lastly, from hence springs care for posterity, for
things their kind would make everlasting so do old men plant young trees, that
other ages may taste of their fruit, if we would apply these rules unto our
selves, and by reflection of the mind would view them, we should find written
in the Tables of our hearts true immortality, and although some impious wits
raise doubts of the immortality of the soul, yet those very doubts do prove
it, Reason 6. From the very doubt and disputation of immortality.
because they seem to know immortal things, for he which brings reasons on
both parts, and calls some things mortal, and others immortal, now if he were
but mortal, he could not judge of immortal things, for when we judge, we make
our minds our mirrours, now material glasses may show you material things,
but immateriall things they cannot show you, as thoughts, or minds, or
speeches, and voices, so when we conceive of God or truth, or Angels which are
eternal, then do our minds receive immortal things which they could not do
if they were mortal, it were impossible and as beasts if they knew reason, and
could distinctly show it they should bear the name of reasonable creatures, for
none could know reason without reason, so when the soul mounts with so high a
winge, as to move doubts of eternal things, she brings proof of her eternity,
even when she strives to prove the contrary, for the thoughts of immortality
being an action done without the aid of the body, shows that alone her self
can move, and be although the body were in the grave, and if she can move her
self so lively without help, That the soul cannot be destroyed.
then must it be everlasting, for her self can never forsake her self. But
although the mind cannot be touched with corruption by any cause that springs
from it self, yet perhaps fate has defined her utter quenching by some
outward cause, perhaps her cause may cease and so she may dye; Her cause
cease not.
God is her cause, and his word her maker, and when heaven and earth shall
pass, she shall stand fixed to eternity, perhaps something repugnant unto her
by strong Antipathy may kill her; She has no contrary.
but what can be contrary to that which holds all contraries in concord; she
can lodge, heat, and cold, and dry, and moist, life, death, peace, and war
together, ten thousand fighting things can lie in her, yet neither to trouble
or disturb each other, I but she may pine away for want of food, that were
strangest of all, because all things bad and good, She cannot dye for want of
food.
all creatures mortal and divine, yea the Almighty himself is her eternal
food, bodies that are fed with mortal things are subject to mortality, but
truth which is eternal feeds the mind, the tree of life which will not suffer,
her to perish: Violence cannot destroy her.
yet violence may as lightening, and the Sun beam dims the sight, or as a
thunderclap, or roaring of a Cannon, does quite astonish the hearing to
encounter things most high, and excellent FANCY.
Ape-like I all things imitate,
Dreame-like I them vary-straite.
New proiects fashions I invent,
All Shapes to head and heart present.
brings high perfection to the soul, for when she views the best and greatest
things, they rather clear then hurt her eye, minds can endure no force nor
bands, but are free though bodies may be captivated. Time cannot destroy her.
Lastly, time may spend her lively powers, and quench her light, but that which
does destroy all other things, does cherish and augment her might; all the
Spheres above shall faint in time and stay there swift motion, and time in
time shall cease, only the soul survives and lives for ever, our bodies every
footstep they take march toward death, whether play or work, sleep or wake,
and flies away on the wings of time, but time gives perfection to the soul,
and to her beauty adds still fresh luster, and makes her to live in eternal
youth, the more she lives, the more she feeds on truth, and by feeding
increases her strength, and what is strength, but an effect of youth, which if
time nurce it, how can it be said to destroy it. Objections against the
immorrality of the soul.
But now some Epicures may smile, and say that this is but false doctrine, for
if the soul do not wax old, how comes it that aged men do so dote, even the
keenest spirits grow sottish, cold, and dull, who were not so in their youth,
and are no souls corrupted? how comes there to be any Idieots by nature, and
some wits they were dazzled, and interrupted, do now clearly see; these are
subtle arguments to those that make reason and sense one thing, but those that
know that wit cannot show her skill, unless she viewes thorough senses glass;
now if that glass of the senses be marred, either it sees nothing, or else it
sees falsehood for truth, for if that region of the tender brain, wherein sets
the inward sense of Fantasy, by nature or by chance becomes unfit, which
should retain the outward gathering of the senses, either it is incapable at
first, and so few or nothing receives, or else marred by some outward accident,
and so perceives every thing amiss, then as a cunning Prince that uses spies,
if they return nothing can know nothing, and if they make advertizement of
lies, all his counsels must needs go awrey; even so the soul knit to such a
Body, whose inward senses are indisposed and unfit, to receive the forms of
things where nothing is brought in can can see nothing.

Hence it is that Idiots, although they have a mind able to know the truth, and
choose that which is good, if she could find such figures in the Brain, as she
might find provided, she were in her right temper, but if a frenzy do
possess it, it so blots and disturbes the forms of things, Fantasy proves
altogether vain, and brings no true relation to the understanding, then the
soul admits all for truth, and buildes false conclusions, flies the good, and
persewes the Ill, believing all that this false spy propounds, but purge the
humors, and appease the rage which wrought this distemper in the Fantasy,
then will the wit which never had disease, discourse as it ought, and judge
discreetly, for the eye has its perfect power of sight, although the stream
be troubled, then these defects are in the senses, and not in the soul, she
loses not her power to see, although her windows be choked with mists, and
clouds, the imperfections are not in the agent, but instrument, the soul has
one intelligence in all; in infants, and old men, although too much moisture be
in the brain of the one, and too much dryness in the other, which makes them
that they cannot attain the outward printes of things, then the soul wanting
work is idle, and we call the one childishness, and the other dotage; yet the
soul has a quick and active wit, if she had apt tools to work withal, and
stuff, for give her but Organs fit, and objects fair, give but the aged man
the sense of the young man, and she will straight way show then her wonted
excellency, and as an old harper, although he has all his Crochets in his
Brain, yet can he not express it when the gout is in his fingers; then dotage
is no weakness of the mind, but of the sense, for if that did wast, we should
find it in all old men, but most of them even at their dying hour have a mind
more quick and lively, and use their understanding power better then in their
youth, and their dying speeches are admired.

But it may be further objected, if all her Organs dye, Objection.
then has the soul no powers to use, and is extincte because she cannot
reduce them to act, and if her powers be dead, then what is she, for some power
springes from every thing, and actings proceed from them, therefore kill her
power, and act, and destroy her. Its very true, the death of the body is the
destruction of the senses, so that she cannot use those faculties, although
their root still rest in her substance, but as the body when it lives by the
wit and will, can judge and choose without the aid of the body, so when the body
can serve her no longer, and her senses are extinct, yet can she discourse in
heavenly contemplation all alone, of what she has heard and learned: and as a
man that has good horsemanship, and can play well on a lute, if thou take both
horse and lute away, yet he still retains his skill, and can put that forth if
they be returned unto him, when the body revives they shall be able to fulfill
all their wanted offices. But it may be further objected, How shall she employ
her self, seeing all her senses be gone? she may keep and enjoy what she has
got, but has no means to understand or to get more, then what do those poor
souls which get nothing, or those that cannot keep what they have got, like
lives which let all out, these souls must sleep for want of exercise.

See how man argues against himself; Why should we not have other means to
know? as children in the womb live by the navil, but being come forth are
nourished otherwise, children if they had use of their senses, and could hear
their mothers tell them, that in a short time they should come from thence,
they then would fear their birth, more then we fear our death, and would cry
out, that if their navill strings were cut, how should their life's be
preserved? since no other conduit brings their food; and if a man should reply
unto those babes, and tell them when they come into this fair world, they shall
see the Sun, Moon and Stars, Sea and earth, and meet with ten thousand
dainties, which they shall take in with pleasure in their mouths, which shall
be cordial as well as sweet and their little limbs shall grow unto tall bodies
they would think it a fable, as we do of the Story of the Golden age, or as
among us many sensual spirits hold the world to come a feined stage, yet those
infants shall find it true. So when the soul is born, for death is nothing but
the souls birth, she shall see ten thousand things beyond her imagination, and
know them in an unknown manner, them shall she see no more by spectacles, nor
hear no more by her double Spies, her self in instant will all things explore,
for every thing is present to her, and lies before her.

But still it may be objected, if the souls departed do live, why do they not
return to bring us news of the strange world wherein they see such wonders,
vain man we do believe that men live under the Zenith of both the frozen
poles, although none come from thence to tell us: So cannot we have the like
faith of our souls, the soul has no more to do here, then we have to
return into our mothers womb, what man did ever covet it, although we all come
from thence: and that shows the soul has a good being that they never desire
to come hither again; doubtless such souls as mount up so high as to see
their Creators face, holds this in so base an account, as that she looks down
and scorns this wretched place. As for such as are detruded to hell, if they
would come here, yet they cannot, but still there are some wicked ones as say,
that politic men have spread this lie of heaven and hell only to make men
virtuous, so then it seems moral virtues be good, but they speak this for
their private gain, for that is the standing of Commonwealths, wherein their
private benefit is interrested, but how can that be false that the Christian,
Jew, Turk, Persian, Tarter, Canibal hold to be true, this doctrine entered not
into the ear, but is native in the breast, if death should destroy man for
whose sake all things was made, then should he be more miserable then Dawes,
Trees, and Rocks, which last longer then he who is taken away at an instant,
but blessed be that great power that has blessed man with longer life then
heaven and earth, and has infused into man mortal powers not subject to the
grave, for although the soul seem to bear about it her grave, and almost
buried alive in this world, she needs not to fear the death of the body, for
when this shell is broke, there comes forth a chicken, for as there are three
essential powers of the soul, the quickening power, and power of the Sense,
and also of reason, there be also three kinds of life defined her, in her due
season to perfect them all; The first life which is vegitive is that nursing
power spent in the womb, where when she finds defects of nourishment, she
expells her body and grows too big for that place, and comes into the world
where all his senses are in perfection, where he finds flowers to smell, and
fruits to taste, sees sundry forms, and hears varieties of sounds, and when he
has past sometime upon this stage, his reason begins to be awaked, which
although she springes when senses begin to fade by reason of age; yet can she
make here no perfect practice.

Then does the aspiring soul leave the body, which we call death, but were it
known to all what life our souls receive by this death, they would rather call
it a birth, or Jail delivery; for in this third life reason will be so bright,
as her sparks will be like the Sun beams, and shall the real ^^ght enjoy of
God, being still increast by divine influence. Then let us take up this
acclamation: O ignorant poor man, what bear thou locked up in the casket of
thy breast, what Jewels and what riches, and what heavenly treasure have thou
in so weak a chest. Look into thy soul and thou shall see such virtues,
honor, and pleasure, and whatsoever is counted excellent in this life. Think
of her worth, and then know that God did mean thy worthy mind should embrace
worthy things; Blot not her beauties with unclean thoughts; neither dishonor
her with thy base passions; destroy not her quickening power with surfeitings
and drunkenness; let not her sensitive power be marred with sensualities and
fleshly desires; and let not her serious thoughts be employed on idle things,
and enslave not her will to vanity, and whenever thou think of her
eternity, have not this evil thought of her, that death is against her nature,
no assure thy self it is a birth in which she is brought forth to a better
being, and when thou come to dye, sing and rejoice as a swan, that thou art a
going to bliss; if thou have faith to believe in Jesus Christ that thy sins
may be forgiven thee, and whereas before thou did fear as a child which is
in the dark, fear not now having this light brought into thee: and now O thou
my soul turn thine eye inward, and view the rays and beams of thy divine
form, and know that whilst thou art clouded with this flesh of thine, thou
can not know any thing perfectly; study the highest and best things, but
retain an humble thought of thy self, cast down thy self, and strive to raise
the glorious and sacred name of thy Maker and blessed Redeemer; use all thy
powers to praise that blessed power which gives thee power to be, and also
power to use those powers thou art endewed withal, and thus shut up all and
say, O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God, how
unsearchable are his Judgments, and his ways past finding out, Of him and
through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever.

WHAT HEAVEN IS, VINDICATED From the Vulgar mistakes, and gross conceivings of
many; some of which mistakes is mention made in this Title, the rest of them
manifested and enlarged in the ensuing Treatise.

AS I. Mistake of Heaven is, that fancey the happiness of Heaven to consist
only in things without them, and look upon it only as an outward place, and not
as an inward state and disposition of the Soul. II. Gross conceit of Heaven
is, as if it were nothing but a Theater, a place of sights and shows, and God
himself were nothing but a more Pompious spectacle, there to be gazed upon by
these bodily eyes, whereas we are never at a distance from him, but only in the
dispersion* multiplicity, distraction, and scattering of our bo^^^s, and in the
dissimilitude, and disproportion of our souls unto him. III. Another Vulgar
and common mistake is that God does not require any endeavors or activity of
ours in the business of Heaven, and that he deals with us in matters of Grace
and Glory, as mere stocks, and stones, and inanimall creatures, and not in any
way suitable to us as free and rational, for although we cannot make alive the
new man in us yet we may concur to the killing, and destroying of the old, by
refusing to satisfy the lusts and cravings of it. IIII. Neither are we to
entertain this conceit, that God has found out any other way to save his
people from Hell and destruction, without saving of them from their sins and
wickednesses.


Infaelix cujus nulli sapientia prodest.

What Heaven is, vindicated from the Vulgar mistakes and gross conceivings of
many.
False Gospellers undermine the true righteousness of God, and make the Gospel
nothing else but a slight imagination; we should not entertain any such
conceit, as if Christ came with any new devise to bring men to heaven without
the hard labor of mortifying their lusts, as if the intent of his coming was
to promulgate ease and liberty to the flesh, and by his being crucified for us
upon the Cross, to excuse our crucifying the old man in our hearts, as if he
had found out a way to save his people from hell and destruction, without
saving of them from their sins and wickednesses 1. The possibility of attaining
that righteousness that is required of us in the Gospel it is by the power of
Christ attainable, or else none could enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. He
that is born of God sins not, for his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin,
because he is born of God, and must we needs say that he that is born of God
can and may do nothing else but sin? is the immortal seed of Gods holy
spirit, of Gods eternal word in the hearts of true believers, is nothing else
but the seed of the Serpent, and the Cockatrice Eggs, it is possible that the
divine nature that the Scripture speaks of, should be nothing else but the
nature of the Devil, that Gods holy spirit in us should make us habitations for
it self to dwell in, and yet suffer us at the same time to be vessels of sin
and Satan; is the end of the holy Gospel not at all to free us from sin by the
power of Christ, but only to spread a Purple veil over us, not all to destroy
the works of the Devil in us, but only to cover them from Gods avenging eye;
Is the end of the Gospel nothing else, but to paliate over the diseases of our
corruptions, which remain in us ever sense the fall, and not at all to cure
them. If so then, surely the reason of this is either, because Christ is not
able to overcome sin and Satan in us, as the Manikees of old dreamed, or else
because he is not willing, and that is a greater disparagement to him then the
former, for the other robbs him only of the Glory of his power, but this
spoils him of the Glory of his goodness; as if Christ should envy that to us,
which of all other things is the most necessary to make us happy; or as if God
were not as careful to advance his Kingdom of light, here in the world, as
the Devil is to enlarge his Kingdom of darkness, as if God did not love his
own butifull Image, his own son and nature, but would willingly suffer it to be
choked and smothered here in the world by those Fiends of darkness, whom he
has long since locked and fettered up in chains of darkness, and reserved for
the judgment of the great day. Says the Philosopher no man sets up a mark on
purpose that men might miss it, and shall God set up this mark of
righteousness in the Gospel as a Butt for us to aim at, for this very end and
purpose, that all the world should miss it; Can he that is the faithful and
true God put such a trick of fraud and mockery upon his creatures? No surely,
righteousness, evangelicall righteousness is the only thing intended per, see
in all Gods Commandments, and sin which is nothing else but a missing of the
mark, comes in by accident, sin is that which God will either destroy and
banish out of the World by the clear discovery of his truth in the hearts of
men, or else he will at last chain it in the bottomless pit to all eternity,
and make the blackness of it to be a soil to set off the glory of his justice.

But it is suggested by some, that Christ will not therefore bestow any true
righteousness, holiness, or sanctification upon a Saint, on purpose that he
might keep him humble, as if the only way to make men truly humble, were to
make them wicked, and as it men would be so much the more proud, by how much
the more holy, and made truly partakers of the image of God. Away then with
this fond conceit, whereby we do nothing else but gratify men's lusts; And
smother and extinguish the life of God in the world, it is the sluggard that
says there is a Lion in the way, but the true believer says, Who art thou O
great mountain before, Zerubbabel thou shall become a plain, nay, the truth it
self says, All things are possible to them that believe, we may undoubtedly
by the power of God in us, prevail every day more and more over the power of
sin and Satan, the weapons of our warfare are very powerful and able to batter
down the strong holds of Satan in our hearts* he that is indeed born of God
shall overcome the world, and the flesh, and the Devil to, by the power of God
in him, he shall destroy the law of sin in his members, by the true Law* the
Law of the Spirit of life, and if we should with unfeigned simplicity of heart
apply our selves to God, and resigning up our selves to him, to be taught and
led by him, we should certainly find that his free spitit would inwardly lead
us into all ways of obedience, and that it would be as natural and as
delightful to us, to walk on in those pleasant paths of holiness and
righteousness, as ever it was to wander in those crooked ways of sin and
wickedness; nay the true Regenerate christian, is so far from delighting
secretly in the ways of sin, as the false hearted hypocrite thinks he does,
that there is nothing that more hurts and wounds his soul, then that he has
not a more lively sense of evil; for the divine life in him being a delicate
and tender thing has the most quickest sense of any thing that is contrary to
it, and is most ingenious and industrious for self preservation against it,
wisdom is easy to the wise, says Solomon, and her ways are ways of
pleasantness to them, and all her paths are peace, and sin is the most ugly
and forlorn thing in the world Let not therefore these evil spies that bring
an evil report upon this Land of Promise, dishearten and discourage us, but
let us go on in the Power of God and his strength, and exercise our faith in
this, not only that we shall be freed from Fire and Brimstone here after, but
that we shall be delivered from the power of sin, and Satan in our own hearts,
this is that faith whereby we overcome the world; and if we had more of this
faith in the power of Christ to destroy our corruptions in us, and to tread
down Satan under our feet, and all that fond and ungrounded confidence, that
God intends to save us while we continue under the power of sin, we should go
on more successefully and prosperously in the way to Heaven.

And it is a dangerous mistake now under the Gospel, to conceive that God will
save men out of a fond affection toward them, without renewing of their
natures, and begetting his own son the new Creature in their hearts. Merely for
believing this very thing, that they shall be saved, as if it were possible for
men to be made happy, without being delivered from the power of sin, which is
all one, as if we should say that it were possible for men to be saved without
salvation, surely such as these think heaven nothing else but a mere place
without them, a fine glistering place, whose gates are of pearl, and the walls
of Jasper, and the bottom paved with stars, a very Turkish Paradise, for had
they once tasted of the true pleasures of the soul purged from sin, and really
established in the life of God, they would then see so much deformity in sin,
that they would not accept of heaven upon such terms as those that is to be
placed in an outward heaven, without the inward change and renewing of their
minds, without the conforming of their souls to the Image and likeness of
God; I am sure a true Saint would not take heaven on such conditions as these
are, that he might enjoy all the outward pleasures that are possible, that he
might have a shining glistering body, that he might tread upon Stars, and fly
upon the wings of the wind, that he might converse with Cherubims and
Serafims, Angels and arc Angels, if all this while he must continue filthy
within, full of noisome and stinking lusts, void of divine wisdom that purges
and purifies the soul, having a dark and sottish mind, unruly affection,
continually struggling and quarrelling within.

God he may indeed dispense with the punishment that belongs to sin, he may
forgive and pardon in respect of punishment, but he can never account those
truly holy, that are truly wicked, and bond slaves to sin and Satan. Now this
can never make us happy to be freed only from the punishment of sin; we can
never be happy, till we be made pertakers of the life of God himself, till we
have the same mind and life in us that is in God himself.

If God should account us righteous, except we were truly possessed of a
righteousness within us, I may speak it with reverence, this could do us no
good, no true christian would be contented with it, no more then a man that is
sick, could be contented to be accounted whole, or one that is poor and naked,
could be contented to be accounted rich and clothed, no more then one that is
frozen in a cold winter night, could be contented to be accounted hot, nothing
without us can make us really happy, till we be inwardly made pertakers of the
Image of God.

But it is very plain and easy to discover the ground of these mistakes,
because carnal men desire not so much to enjoy heaven, as to be freed from
hell, or if they desire heaven they desire nothing at all in it, but only their
own ease and carnal pleasure, it would serve their turn well enough, if they
could but have an artifice to get their sins pardoned, that they might be freed
from the punishment that is due to them, and might be admitted into a sensual
heaven, though they live to all eternity under the power of sin and
wickedness, and never have the lest taste of the true heavenly Manna, nor any
knowledge of the name written on the white stone, which no man knows but he
that has it, and therefore it will serve these men's turns well enough, if
they may be freed from the punishment of sin, while they love sin with all
their hearts, The true hearted christian is really departed out of wicked
Sodom, out of this noisome state of sin, he is not so much solicitus about his
state, as about his life, that he may still continue that heavenly life that is
begun in him, he is not so anxious about his justification in a proposterous
method, as about the sanctification of his heart and affection; that is the
best way to be assured of his justification, he feels the divine life in him,
and that he knows can never sink him to hell, he drinks of the true springs
of everlasting life, and knows he shall never see death, he is not so much
perplexed about his future salvation, because he finds he is already saved,
because it self has taken him upon its wings, and carries him away swiftly
far from the region of death and Hell. I beseech you let us not deceive our
selves, without such an inward frame of spirit as this is, that is really
crucified to the world, and planted into Christ, sucking life and influence
from him. God himself with what he can do without us, would never make us
happy.

Besides the destroying of this corrupt, natural, and fleshly life, we must
also have a new and spiritual life begotten in us; For as Christ and the
divine nature did assume the humane nature to it self, so likewise in every
christian the divine life, or the life of God must as it were assume the humane
and created life of man, and totally act it and enforce it, this is the essence
of the new creature, this is the life and soul of christianity, the marrow and
quintessence of all religion, to have a life wrapped up in man, that is the
very life of God himself, and whosoever does not partake of this life,
whatsoever opinion he entertains in religion, whatever outward forms of
discipline he contends for, whatever sects he belongs to, he is either carnal
or devilish. For nothing of man's is pleasing unto God, but that that God works
in man, and by man, and whatsoever works with God according to that that is in
God, this is in a manner one spirit with God himself, and whatsoever it does,
it does it in Forma Dei, that is, God using this man's soul and life, and
abilities, does act it in him. But whatsoever particular created life, lives
otherwise then the eternal life of God lives, this sets up it self against
God, and this is the life of corrupt nature, and the life of the Devil, this
is sin and nothing else, to live otherwise then the eternal life of God lives,
and this was that that Christ came into the world to destroy, and how does he
do this? surely no otherwise then by bringing Gods own life into the humanity;
Again, for he himself was nothing else but a Tabernacle of God pitched amongst
men, nothing but a humane nature acted, and disposed, and guided by the life of
God, so that whatsoever Christ lives, God lives in him, now this must not only
be done by Christ without us, but the same also must be done within us.

One gross mistake among men, that yet pretend much to Religion that is very
prejudicial to the advancement of this spiritual righteousness that the
Gospel requires of us, and that is a conseite that men have whereby they think
that salvation is a mere outward work, and therefore may be wholly effected by
outward means, whereas it is nothing else for the substance of it, but the
inward transforming of our selves into the likeness of God, the real
translating of us out of the life of nature, into the divine life, or life of
God, or the begetting of a new and heavenly life in the soul of man, that is
the very same that does every way agree with the life of God himself; I say it
with reverence God himself cannot make us happy by any thing without us, but
only by forming his own nature and likeness in us, they are carnal and
earthly minded men, and no way suitable to the state of glory and happiness,
that fancy the happiness of heaven to consist only in things without them, and
look upon it only as an outward place, and not as an inward state and
disposition of the soul; I say therefore that salvation it is an inward thing,
and consists chiefly in being saved from our sins, and being delivered from our
own life, and being translated out of the Kingdom of darkness into the
Kingdom of light and righteousness, and it is not a Heaven without us, though
never so glorious and glistering a place, nay, it is not God without us that
can make us truly and really happy, but it is God inwardly, setting himself in
our souls, and so dwelling in us that our sins may be so ruled and guided by
the life of God, as the members of our bodies are acted by our souls, and when
this is once done, we shall at once live both the life of God, and enjoy the
joy, peace, and happiness of God himself, which will all at once flow in upon
us, I would not be mistaken, I do not here deny but that there be some other
inferior circumstances belonging to the state of happiness, as the changing
of these vild bodies of ours, and instead of this earthly tabernacle that
weighs down the mind, as Solomon speaks, when as our souls were as it were
now buried in a heepe of flesh, they shall receive an other more divine
Tabernacle that Paul calls a spiritual body, a more fit companion for our
souls, and many other such things answerable hereunto, I say these things I
do not deny, but yet all these things are of an inferior nature, and all
depend upon the former, the inward frame and disposition of the soul, in which
the substance of heaven and hell consist. Now this being well considered and
understood, it is very plain that to think we can be saved without inward
righteousness, merely by something done without us, without the inward and
real change of our souls; is all one as to think we can be saved without
salvation, or we can be made happy without the possession of happiness, though
we must still remember the only procuring cause of our salvation, is the death
sufferings and satisfaction of Christ, who was made a propitiation for our
sins, this is therefore the reason for which this inward righteousness before
spoken of is to be urged in the Gospel* not as if we could thereby merit any
thing at all at the hands of God, for we can merit no thing, but there is
nothing that God himself can bestow upon us in heaven better, then the
partisipation of his own life and nature, this inward change of the soul, this
new creature is salvation it self, and if we be not possessed of it in some
measure here, we have little reason how ever we may fondly flatter our selves
to think it shall be done hereafter, that is the first mistake that I shall
take notice of, that we are apt to conceive that salvation is an outward work,
and may be wrought only by outward means.

2. There is another mistake that is very near a kin to that in matters of
religion, and that is, when we seek for God we look for God wholly abroad
without our selves, whereas the only way to find God is to turn our selves
inward, and to look for him in the bottom of our own souls, for if we could
be carried up beyond the spheres, and pry into every corner of the stars in
heaven above, certainly we should as little find God there as we did on earth,
if we could find God any where abroad without us, this could not make us happy,
for then God would be really at a distance from us, but our happiness consists
in such a real communion with God, as our Savior discribes, 17 Joh. 22. The
glory which thou gave me, I have given them, that they may be one as we are
one; I in them, and they in me, that all might be made perfect in one: The
heaven where God dwells in, and where alone he is to be found, is in a
regenerate soul, and he that will indeed find God and be united to him, must
not gaze and gad abroad, and turn his eyes wholly outward, but he must look to
find him within, Intimis animis, for there he may at once both see him, feel
him, taste him, and be united to him, God is never distant by place from us,
for in him we live and move and have our being, but all our distance from him
is only in the dispersion, multiplicity, destractions, and scatterings of our
hearts, and in the dissimilitude and disproportions of our souls unto him, and
when these things are once removed, then God appears to us who was never absent
from us, but only our eyes are now unvailed to see and behold him, God is every
where alike to him that can feel him, he is only not present to him that
cannot receive him, as the sun shines not in a house where the curtains are
drawn, and the windows stopped up. This is the reason why many have so much ado
to find God, because they look for him as a corporal thing, they still employ
their fancies and imaginations to find him without, and send them a roving,
gadding, and wandering abroad after God, and have such natural and gross
conceits of heaven, as if it were nothing but a Theater, a place of sights and
shows, and God himself were nothing but a more pompeous spectacle, there to be
gazed upon by these bodily eyes; God I say is to be sought by a Christian
within his own soul, and the way to find him there is, not by knowledge; or
study, or speculation, but by a leaving off all things, even our own wit and
knowledge, and especially our lives, and by abstracting of our selves from the
love of the world, and of our selves, and dying to them, and then out of this
death will spring the true and heavenly light in which alone God is seen and
known.

3. There is yet another mistake that is very vulgar and common, and that is,
that men are generally very apt to conceive that God does not require any
endeavors, any activity of ours at all in the business of Religion, and that
God deals with us in matters of grace and spiritual things, as mere stocks,
and stones, and inanimal creatures, and not in a way suitable to us, as we are
free and rational; This I conceive to be another mistake that damps and
choakes men's endeavors of subduing and mortifying their lusts, for by this
means we lazily ly down under the burden of our sins, and think we may cast the
blame of our wickedness upon God himself, he has not given us strength, he
has not given us power and ability, this is a strong castle of sin, in which
men are apt to garrison themselves against all the hearty exhortations and
instructions which the Word of God, and the messengers of God bring unto them,
whereas the Scripture every where calls upon us, to work out our salvation with
fear and trembling, to make our calling and election sure, to gird up the loins
of our minds, to fight the good fight of faith, and Christ himself tells us,
That he with his spirit stands at the door and knocks, if any man open, and
will hear his voice, I will come into him, says he, and sup with him, and he
with me; It is true, indeed it is not in our power to make our selves new
creatures, to be regenerate and born again when we please, but as our Savior
tells us, the wind blows where it lists, and thou hear the sound
thereof, and can not tell whence it comes, nor whither it goes, so is every
one that is born of the Spirit, but yet let us not deceive our selves, though
this change in us be a new birth, and we cannot make our selves the sons of
God, no more then we can make our selves the Sons of men, we can indeed but
Pati Deum, lie down and suffer while he prints his own Image on our hearts,
while he forms himself in our souls; yet notwithstanding let us not deceive
our selves, there is something for us to do, and that the Scripture every
where calls upon us for, and that is, not to make provision for the flesh, to
fulfill the lusts thereof, to put off the old man that is corrupt, according to
the deceitful lusts, to mortify and subdue this body of death, that we carry
about us, for though we cannot make alive the new man in us when we please, yet
we may concur to the killing and destroying of the old, by refusing to
satisfy the lusts and cravings of it, and then by looking up to heaven, and
imploring Gods assistance that he would come down upon us the second time, and
breath into us the breath of supernatural life, we have therefore many
gracious promises made to us in the Gospel, on purpose to encourage us to faith
in God, that he will be always ready to prevent us with his goodness, and to
remove the wretched infidelity of our hearts, whereby our confidence in God is
choked and all heavenly endeavors are dampt in us, the whole Gospel was
written to this end and purpose, to destroy this infidelity, and assure us that
we may come to God, and that he is a rewarder of those that seek him.

FINIS.
