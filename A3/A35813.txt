Wherein the chief things of every particular Chapter are reduced to heads,
for help of the Memory; and many hard places explained, for the help of the
Understanding.

To the READER.
WE need not run to the numerous Catechismes and Bodies of Divinity, to
learn our Creed, and the Ten Commandments, (i.) to know our Duty toward God
and man. If there were no Theological Systems in the world, the Principles of
Religion might be all found in these Canonical Epistles: For other Divinity
Treatises are but so many Copies, these are the Original. In these
Apostolical Tracts we have our Divinity at the first hand, in others at the
second, third, fourth, etc. One piece of gold contains in it the worth and
value of many pieces of silver: So do these Golden Epistles contain in them
the substance of many thousand Volumnes of Divinity. Here we may meet with
Schoole-Divinity in the Determination of many Controversies; as concerning
Justification betwixt the Jews and Christians; concerning their Priesthood and
our Saviors; etc. Here also are Cases of Conscience, concerning abstaining
even from lawful things, to avoid scandal; as of eating of meats, etc. And
not only these, but also Ecclesiastical Policy in Church discipline,
concerning the Excommunication of scandalous persons. etc. And for our
Devotion, we need not go far for the Practice of Piety; here we have it:
Justification and Sanctification are chained together in these Epistles; none
of them begin with a Doctrine of Justification, which do not conclude with an
Application of an Use of Exhortation to Sanctification and holiness of life,
least any should think Faith not to be so much the Devotion of the Heart, as
the Fancy of the Brain. Here we have rules concerning our Thoughts, that they
should be pure, humble, etc. Concerning our Discourse, that it should be meek
and profitable to others: etc. And concerning our Actions to others, that they
should have in them Justice and Equity: And generally concerning all these
three, that they should be all seasoned with Charity. Aristotle's Ethics are
here Christ'ned, in being refined from the dross of Heathenisme. Lypsius did
advise one to read Senecaes Epistles, Lege Senecam (says he) firmabit te
contra omnes lapsus: But he might have given better advice, if he had bid him
read the Epistles of the Apostles: These are they that will keep a man's head
above water in all conditions. Senecaes comforts in affliction did but depend
upon the weak Reed of natural reason, but the Consolations of the Apostles
are grounded upon the strong Rock of Faith.

I here present unto you the Analysis of the Canonical Epistles, as most
befitting them, for the seeming abruptness of the style, and the
non-dependance of much of the matter in them, together with the variety
thereof; wherein I have Analyzed every particular Chapter distinctly by it
self; not casting the Epistles into a General sum; in meddling with a
General Analysis, which some have done already: And withal I present my
earnest advise, to use the same method in most of your readings; that is, to
reduce whatsoever you read in any choice Book, but especially the best of all
Books (the Bible) to the most material heads. This way will be the best Art
of Memory, and will support it more then those Cells which the Memorists have
devised to place the Species of so many things in. Famous Aristotle took the
same course, in reducing all the numerous Individuums in the world to certain
Classes and Common places, (i.) the Ten Predicaments. A burden being well
packed and trusse^ up into a little compass, is the easier to b^ carried,
which otherwise will oppress the Bearer.

And, according to my first intention (when I undertook this work) the
Analysis is shor^ and perspicuous, to help the memory; and no^ wyre-drawne,
and stretched out too far, to confound and perplex it. To Analyze and resolve
things into little, and minute parts, would be rather to play the Chemist, then
Divine. Therefore the Analysis of every Chapter does consist of a few heads; it
is not a Hydra, of many heads.

I have also, in this Analysis, briefly explained many hard places; and given
you some glympse of that light, which you will find more diffused in the best
Interpreters. All which I did first for my own benefit, and now do
communicate for yours.

The Lord of Heaven grant, that this work begun and ended by his gracious
assistance, may be for the advantage of us both.

CHAP. I.
1. S. Paul's calling to the Ministry v. 1. Concerning which 1. His zeal and
fervency in it. 2. The object of it, viz. the Gospel. v. 1. Wherein 1. The

The aggravation of their punishment, from their greater measure of knowledge.
v. 21, 22, 23.
CHAP. III.
1. Paul's vindication of himself from the aspersion of encouraging men to
sin. v. 8. 2. His accusation of the Jews of sin, notwithstanding they were
Gods peculiar people. v. 9. 3. His proof of it, out of the Psalms, concerning
the general sinning of all. v. 10, 11. 4. His doctrine of justification by
faith. v. 28.
CHAP. IV.
The prosecution of the doctrine of justification; 1. Positively: That it is by
faith; which he confirms, 1. By reasons; which are 1. Because it is of free
grace. v. 4. 2. Because the promise was made through Faith. v. 13.
2. By proof out of the Psalms; where it is said, that our sins are
forgiven, and therefore not satisfied for by works. v. 6, 7. 3. By the example
of Abraham, who was justified for beleiving the promises of God. v. 13.
2. Negatively; 1. That it is not by works; for then 1. We might glory in

CHAP. VI.
1. An inference from his former doctrine; wherein is, 1. A prohibition to
abuse Gods mercy in sinning the more, because he is so merciful to forgive;
and that for two reasons; v. 1. 1. Because it is against the order of Gods
sanctifying grace; whereby they that are dead to sin, cannot in all common
sense live unto it. v. 2. 2. Because we are baptized unto newness of life. v.

of freedom from it, v. 24, 25.
3. The Nature of the Law; 1. Which does discover sin, and in that is holy.

being brought to despair by the harshnesse of it, is provoked more and more.
v. 8.

CHAP. VIII.
1. Consolation against despair; because there is no condemnation to them that
are in Christ Jesus. v. 1. 2. Consolation against dejection in affliction and
persecution; in that all things work for good to them that are in Christ
Jesus. v. 28. 3. A description, 1. Of Carnality: wherein is 1. The effect of

not 1. Against Gods promise. nor v. 6. 2. Against his justice. v. 14.

in saving some. v. 23. 2. For his justice in passing by others. v. 22.

CHAP. X.
1. A description of 1. Legal justice. 2. Evangelicall.
2. The difference of both, in that the 1. viz. legal breeds doubts. v. 6.

Israelites. v. 3. From Gods decree. v. 2.

were strangers were chosen, much more shall the Jews, that were his own
people, be received again. 2. From the Prophecy of Esaias. 3. From their
parentage, because they were the Children of Abraham. v. 16.
5. The Cause 1. Of Election; Gods free mercy. 2. Of Reprobation; infidelity.
6. His admiration of Gods mercy and wisdom.

Concerning the Church; that we be not high minded in doing any office in it. v.

CHAP. XIII.
Three Exhortations; 1. To subjection unto authority for three reasons; 1.
Because God is the Author of it. v. 1. 2. Because he is the revenger of
disobedience. v. 2. 3. Because he is the rewarder of obedience. v. 3. 4.
Because government is for our good; and therefore we are bound in conscience to
submit unto it. v. 4.
2. To charity; which comprehends all the duties of the second table unto our
neighbor. v. 8, 9. 3. To temperance, sobriety, chastity, and other virtues,

CHAP. XIV.
1. A reprehension of two sorts of people for their dissension; which are, 1.
Some converted Jews. 2. Some converted Gentiles.
2. The matter of their dissension, 1. Meats. 2. Days; whereof the Jews not
qui^^ leaving off the observation of Mos^^ his Law, made a difference after
their conversion: but the Gentiles, making use of their Christian liberty,
thought all meats and all days alike
3. The Apostles holy endeavor to compose their differences 1. By advising of
them to let every man enjoy his own opinion in things indifferent. v. 5. 2. By
letting them know, that both parties did aim at Gods glory. v. 6. 3. By
telling them, how unlawful it was to judge another man's servant; and much more
for one to judge another uncharitably, when they were all Gods servants* v. 4.
4. By showing, how unfitting it was for them, who were to be judged one day,
themselves to judge one another. v. 10.

to teach us to be serviceable one to another. v. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

were able to instruct one another. v. 14. But to be their Remembrancer. v. 15.

their good service, 1. To the Church. 2. To Churchmen, as Phe^e, v. 1, 2. and
Aquila, and Priscilla Mary, etc.
2. A discommendation of others for their factious spirits, and the Character

to be eloquent, then profitable in their preaching. 2. The peoples fond
admiration of their Ministers for their frothy eloquence.
3. The opinion of the Jews and Greeks, that thought plain preaching a
dishonor to the Gospel; is confuted, 1. By reason; because Gods power would
less appear in eloquence, then in plainness of speech. v. 17. 2. By the
example of Gods election, who makes choice of the foolish, v. 26, 27. for his
own glory. v. last.

to spiritual things. v. 13. 2. The subject of his preaching, (i.) Jesus
Christ, hi^ passion, etc. v. 2. 3. The dignity of the Gospel which he

upstart thing, but o^ great antiquity. v. 7.
4. The means how it may be got; which is, the Revelation by the Spirit. v.

who only di^cerne it. v. 15, 16.

CHAP. III.
1. The Apostles Apology for his plain preaching. v. 2^ because the
Corinthians were not capable of high^^ matter. 2. His reproof of their carnal
divisions and factions, i^ idolizing several men, as Paul, Apollo, etc. v. 3,
4. 3. His reasons, whereby he disswades them from their factions, Because 1.
They are but servants whom they so much run after, and therefore not to be
adored. v. 5. And their servants. v. 22. 2. They all work the same work, and
therefore not one to be preferred to another. v. 9. 3. They are the Temple of
God, which is not to be rent with factions. v. 16. 4. They are to have no

CHAP. IV.
1. Against the contempt of the Ministry, v. 1. which the Apostle dehorteth

ironically. v. 8, 9, 10.

medicines that are to be used by every spiritual Physician; 1. Lenitives, (i.)
mild admonitions. 2. Corrosives, (i.) sharp reproofs. v. ult.

CHAP. V.
1. Of Excommunication; where we may observe, 1. The end of it; the salvation
of t^^ soul. v. 5. 2. The neglect of it; which is the ca^^ of more infection.
v. 6. 3. The authority for it; which is Ap^stolicall. v. 3, 4, 5.
2. Of conversation with excommunicated persons which may be twofold; 1.
Familiar and intimate^ and this is absolute^ forbidden. v. 11. 2. Natural and
civil, an^ this is lawful, and cannot possibly be avoided v. 10.
3. The incestuous man's punishment, decreed by the Apostle, v. 3, 4, 5. which
is excommunication. 4. The Corinthians remissness in punishing him sharply
reprehended. v. 2.
CHAP. VI.
1. Concerning the trial of suits and controversies, and of the Judges
thereof; which are of two sorts: 1. Heathenish, which the Apostle disswadeth
the Corinthians from going to, for two reasons; Because 1. They are unjust. v.
1. 2. They are unbeleivers. v. 2.
2. Christian, which he advises them to have. v. 1. Because 1. They shall
judge the World. v. 2. 2. They shall judge the Angels; and if such high things,
then are they much more able to judge worldly matters of less consequence. v.
3.

2. The danger of dissension, which is, damnation, v. 2. and the cures for all
law suits; which are, 1. Patience and Charity. v. 8. 2. Meekness. v. 8.
3. Concerning Fornication; That 1. It is not indifferent, as meats and
drinks. v. 13. 2. It is to be avoided, because our bodies are, 1. Members of
Christ. v. 15. 2. Temples of the Holy Ghost. v. 19 3. Consumed by it. v. 18.


CHAP. VII.
1. A resolution of some doubts proposed by the Corinthians to the Apostle: As,
1. That it was lawful for Christians to marry. v. 2. 2. That it was unlawful
for any to put away his Wife, unless it were for fornication. v. 10. 3. That
difference in religion cannot dissolve marriage; as appears in the instance of
the marriage of the ^aithfull with the unfaithful. v. 12, 13, 14. 4. That
wedlock is no hindrance to salvation* (as some of them thought) no more then
any other calling, of circumcision or uncircumcision, slavery or freedom, etc.
v. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. 5. That no Woman is bound to live perpetuall^ a Virgin.
v. 25. 6. That singleness of life is more convenient not more honest then that
of wedlock. v. 34 7. That we must not addict our selves too much either to the
profit or pleasure of any calling. v. 29, 30, 31.


CHAP. VIII.
A resolution of another Question of the Corinthians, concerning eating of
meats offered to Idols; wherein are proposed.

1. Two Objections; 1. That there was no such thing as a^ Idol, which was a
mere fiction; and therefore it was no fault to eat meats offered to it. v. 4.
2. That meats were indifferent, neithe^ good nor bad; and therefore not
unlawful to eat them. v. 8.
2. An Answer to them both; That though there was but one God, v. 4. and that
their Idols were nothing: and though eating of meats were indifferent, yet if
eating of such meats were offensive to the weaker sort of Christians, they were
bound in charity to abstain from them. v. 6.10. 3. A Position; That Christian
liberty is to be used no further then it may consist with Charity; least we
sin 1. Against our weak brother. 2. Against Christ. v. 12.
4. His own practice of this doctrine; He advised them to do nothing but what
he did himself. v. last.
CHAP. IX.
1. The Apostles willingness to forgo his liberty, to move them to dispense
with theirs, in abstaining from meats offered to Idols, that the weaker sort
might not be offended; as in being content, 1. To preach gratis, without
maintenance from the Church, v. 11. which he proves to be due to the Ministry;
1. From the Law of Nature; and this by two similitudes: taken 1. From Warfare;
that none is a soldier for nothing. v. 7. 2. From Husbandry; that none keeps
a vineyard, nor feeds a flock gratis. v. 7.
2. From the Law of God. v. 9. 3. From Natural Reason; that Temporal things
are to be paid for Spiritual. v. 11.
2. To have no Wife. v. 5. 3. To comply with all men to save their souls; to
do as they do, 1, In matters indifferent, as Ceremonies. v. 19, 20, 21, 22.
Though not 2. In things absolute.



CHAP. X.
1. No privilege for sin, being Gods people, partaking of the Sacraments,
etc. will no more free us from punishment, if we sin, then it did our
forefathers the Israelites. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 2. The benefit, 1. Of bad
example, to deter us from sin; as of the Israelites, whom God punished, 1.
For Idolatry. v. 7. 2. For Fornication. v. 8. 3. For Murmuring. v. 10.
2. Of good example, to draw us to goodness; as of the Apostle Saint Paul, who
did only dissuade the Corinthians from meat offered to Idols (as he had done
before) 1. By his preaching; by showing, that they could not communicate both
with Christians and Infidels. v. 21. 2. By his life; for he abstained himself,
that he might give offense to none. v. last.


CHAP. XI.
1. Of Ceremonies in the Church which are not abolished by the Gospel. 1.
Corcerning men, who are forbidden to be covered in the exercise of 1. Prayer.
v. 4. 2. Prophecy. v. 4.
Reason. Because it is a dishonor to Christ, who gave them liberty not to be
covered, which signifies subjection.

to their Husbands. v. 5. Yet 3. The superiority of the man should not make him
contemn the woman. v. 11.
2. Of preparation for the worthy receiving of the Lords Supper; in which is
forbid drunkenness, whereof the Corinthians were guilty, v. 21. and a strict
examination of our selves enjoined. v. 28. 3. The end of the Lords Supper;
which is, the memory of Christ's death to satisfy for our sins. v. 26.
CHAP. XII.
Of Spiritual Gifts.

1. Their beginning, (i.) the Holy Ghost. v. 8, 9, 10, etc. 2. Their use, the
edification of others. 3. Their abuse, (i.) ostentation, vainglory, and
contempt of others that have not such great gifts, whereof the Corinthian were
guil^^. 4. Their difference: Some gifts are above others, as Faith, Hope and
Charity, which were less esteemed by the Corinthians, then others. 5. The
variety of them; as, 1. The word of wisdom and knowledge. v. 10. 2. Working
of miracles. v. 10. 3. Prophecy. v. 10. 4. Diverse kinds of tongues. v. 10. 5.
Interpretation of them. v. 10.
6. The Apostles advice to superiors that have greater gifts, signified by the
eye, v. 21. not to contemn those that have lesser. ibid. 7. His advice to
inferiors that have lesser gifts, signified by the foot, v. 15. not to envy
those that have greater gifts.

The comparison of it with other virtues, viz.

1. Eloquence. v. 1. v. 2. 2. Prophecy. v. 2. 3. A miraculous faith. v. 2. 4.
Martyrdom. v. 4.

CHAP. XIV.
1. A Comparison of prophecy, and the tongues; wherein is maintained, 1. Not

resurrection; As 1. All preaching would be to no purpose, and our faith too. v.

The Analysis of the Epistle of Saint PAUL to the GALATIANS.
CHAP. I.
After the inscription of the Epistle in the name of himself, and his
brethren, v. 1, 2, we may observe, 1. His Salutation; and in it, 1. The benefit
of Christ's death (i.) remission of sins. v. 3, 4. 2. The thankfulness of
the Apostle for it v. 5.
2. His Reprehension, 1. Of the Galatians; 1. For their inconstancy, in fallin;
off from the Gospel. 2. For their unthankfulness, in falling off from Christ,
who had received them into favor. v. 6.
2. Of their false teachers. 1. For their going about, by maintaining
justification by the works of the Law, and not by faith, to overthrow the
Gospel; which he affirms to be unalterable, Either 1. By men, Or, 2. By
Angels. v. 8, 9.
2. For their vilisying his person, the better to bring in their false
opinions, by saying that he was not ordained a Minister by God, as the other
Apostles were; which the Apostle confureth, by affirming, that he received not
the Gospel, 1. In an ordinary way by men. v. 11. But 2. In an extraordinary
way, by revelation from God, v. 12. and this he justifies, 1. By Arguments;
that the Gospel was not taught him, either, 1. At Jerusalem; for he went not
up thither to them which were Apostles, v. 17. to be taught by them; and his
going to Peter there, was only to visit him, not to learn of him, for he
stayed but 15 days. v. 18. Or 2. Of the Churches of Judea, for he was not 1.
Known to them by face, v. 22. and therefore could not learn of them: But 2.
Only known of them by name who had heard of his condition both 1. Before his
conversion. v. 23. And 2. After it, for which they praised God v. last.









CHAP. II.
He proceeds in the Argument of vindicting against the aspersions of false
teachers, 1. The dignity of his person; that he was not (as they fally
reported) inferior to the other Apostles; 1. Because his going to Jerusalem
with I tus and Barnabas, v. 1. was 1. To acquaint them with the ^^cesse of his
preaching amongst^ Gentiles. v. 2. And not 2. To learn any thing of them. v.
2. Because he reproved Peter, (whi^^ showed he was not inferior to him v. 11.
for his dissimulation and halth between two opiuions, viz. Jewish a^
Christian; which proceeded not 1. Out of error of judgment; But 2. Out of
passion, (i.) fear; and (...) not 1. Of danger; But 2. Of giving offense and
scandal to the Jews, v. 12. which occasioned, 1. A greater scandal both to
the Gentiles, and Saint Paul's doctrine of Christian liberty form Circumsion.
And 2. A Revolt of many by his example, as Barnabas, etc. v. 13.



2. The dignity of his doctrine; wherein, 1. The quality of it; that it was not
contrary to what the other Apostles taught, as was objected; 1. By their not
forcing him to circumcise Titus. v. 3. 2. By the testimony and approbation
which Saint James and Saint John gave unto him of his preaching. v. 9.
2. The Matter of it, (i.) Justification; which he proves, 1. Negatively; not
to be by the Law. v. 16. But 2. Positively; to be by faith. ibid.
3. The Consequence and effect of his doctrine of justification by faith; which
does not tend; 1. To the encouragement of sin. But 2. To fanctification of
life; which follows justification by faith. ibid. and v. 18.




2. In showing the absurd consequence of the Doctrine of Justification by
Works; for if that were true. Men would be their own Saviors, and there
would be no need of having Christ to be our Savior. v. last.

CHAP. III.
1. The inconstancy and sottishness of the Galatians, in falling off from the
Gospel; for which he blame^^ them the more, because 1. They had a perfect and
clear knowledge of the Gospel. v. 1. 2. They had the benefits by it, which we
the gifts of the Spirit, to confirm (...) truth of the Gospel to them; viz.
1. Regeneration. v. 2. 2. Power of doing miracl^^ v. 5.
3. They suffered persecution for it; and (...) forsake that doctrine they
suffered for was folly. v. 4.
2. His Doctrine of Justification by Faith, (from which they were seduced by
false teachers) which he prove to be true doctrine, 1. From the example of
Abraham, who w^^^ justified by faith, v. 6. and was a Father 1. Not only to
those that were e^nally and lineally descended from him, (i.) the Jews, which
the bragged much of: But 2. More especially to all true belevers, and so a
Father to the Gentiles. v. 7, 8.
2. From the Scripture it self. Hab. 2.4. 3. From the terrible and sad effect
of the Law, which is death. v. 10.
3. The Means of Justification, (i.) Christ who has redeemed us, 1. Not from
the obedience to, But 2. From the curse of the Law, v. 3. which 1. Did not
disanull and make void the promise made unto Abraham, v. 17. (as they objected)
But 2. Did serve as a Schoolmaster, 1. To curb and keep in subjection the
Israelites, which were as children under it. v. 19. 23. 2. To fit us (like
Schoolmasters, who train up youth from smaller matters to greater) for
greater; (i.) the receiving of the Gospel, v. 24. which we should not receive
if we were not first made sensible by the Law both 1. Of our sins; And 2.
Punishment for them.

3. Whose power and retrour did cease at the coming of Christ. v. 25.

4. The End of our Justification by Christ was, to show Gods great mercy, who
suffered us to sin that he might show mercy, v. 22. which mercy is without
partiality, and not respects 1. The person of any, either 1. Of birth; Jew or
Gentile Or, 2. Of sex; Male or Female.
2. The Condition of any, bond or free, rich or poor, v. 28.

CHAP. IV.
The Comparison of the Law, 1. To a Tutour; under which we were, 1. As
Children; subject to the ceremonion of it. v. 3. 2. From which we were freed by
God, wh^sent, 1. His Son to redeem us. v. 5. 2. His Holy Ghost to assure us
of our redemption. v. 6.
Not: 1. Which Doctrine the Apostle adviset them to embrace, and not to rely on
the ceremonies of the Law, which are, 1. Weak, and unable to d^^ us any good.
2. Beggarly, without the rich gifts of the Spirit. v. 9.
Not: 2. Here he takes occasion to speak,
1. Of his true love to them, expressed 1. In suffering affliction to prea^ the
Gospel to them. v. 13. 2. In telling them the plain truth v. 16.
2. Of their love to him (though unconstant) whi^^ they expressed, 1. In
rejoicing that he was their Minister. 2. In being willing to part with any
thing, though as dear as an eye for his sake v. 15.
3. Of the false and dissembled love of their fall Teachers, whose design was
only, 1. To get a name. 2. To draw their affections from him v. 17.
2. To Abraham's Bondmaid, whose son was born to bondage, and after the flesh.
v. 23. 3. Of us to Isaac, who was his son by Sarah, of the promise; where the
Apostle concludes, that we are the sons of Abraham by faith, v. 28. though
not descended from him according to the flesh; and that though 1. We suffer
persecution by false teachers of Judaisme, etc. v. 29. Yet 2. This may be our
comfort, that not they, v. 30. but we shall inherit. v. last.



CHAP. V.
He shows, 1. That Judaisine, in trusting to our own works, and fulfilling
the Law, is not the way to salvation: 1. Because to such Christ is no Savior.
v. 2. 2. Because that using but one Ceremony of the Law, as Circumcision, does
bind us to the keeping of all; so that if we fail in one, we are guilty of
death. v. 3.
2. That Christianity, in relying on Christ by faith, is the only way to be
justified, v. 5. to which doctrine he exhorts them to stick close; And, 1.
Commends them for receiving it at the first, with so much chearfullnesse. v. 7.
2. Sharply reproves, 1. Not so much the Galatians, as relapsing rather, 1. Out
of weakness, then 2. Out of wilfulness. As,
2. The false prophets, by whose persuasions they were drawn from his
doctrine, v. 8. who (though few) yet, like leaven, did corrupt the whole
Church, v. 9. and falsely slandered hi^ for preaching Circumcision, for
reproving which he was persecuted by the Jews. v. 11.

3. That the doctrine of Christian liberty does 1. Free them from the rigor,
guilt and punishment of the Law: But not 2. From the obedience to it; which
must be expressed in our love and charity one toward another: whose 1. Effect
consists in serving and helping one another. v. 13. 2. Benefit appears by
considering the inconvenience of dissension. v. 15.

4. That none can have the benefit of the death of Christ, but such as, 1. Have
mortified the works of the flesh v. 24. whereof some appertain, 1. To Lust;
as, 1. Adultery. v. 19. 2. Fornication. v. 19. 3. Uncleanness. v. 19. 4.
Lasciviousness. v. 19.
2. Others to Gluttony; as, 1. Drunkenness. v. 21. 2. Too much eating. v. 21.
3. Others to the Soul; as, 1. Idolatry. 2. Witchcraft.
4. Others to Anger; as 1. Strife. v. 20. 2. Seditions. v. 20.

Goodness. v. 22.23. 7. Faith. v. 22.23. 8. Meekness. v. 22.23. 9. Temperance.
v. 22.23.
and walk, and order their lives according to the directions and actions of
it. v. 25.




CHAP. VI.
1. Motives to make us use moderation and meekness in reproving men that sin
out of infirmity; which are 1. The consideration of our own frailty, and
aptness to fall. v. 1. 2. Christ's command to show our love in hearing one with
another. v. 2. 3. Humility, and not thinking highly of our selves. v. 3. 4.
Self examination, in looking into our own faults, and not being too busy in
prying into other men's. v. 4. 5. The Consideration of being judged for our own
actions, and not by comparing our selves with others. v. 5.
2. An Exhortation to Liberality, 1. To the Ministry; not 1. As a Contribution
of Alms: But 2. As a Communication and payment of a due unto them. v. 6.
2. To all in want, but especially those of our own profession, v. 10. wherein
two virtues are commended; 1. Perseverance, without giving over. v. 9. 2. A
diligent watching for, and catching of any opportunity of releiving them. v. 10.

3. An encouragement to this liberality, which is a promise of a large reward.
v. 8, 9. 3. His affection to the Galatians, expressed by writing this Letter
with his own hand, whilst others were written by others. v. 11. 5. His
dis-affection, 1. To the false Prophets; as being me^ that looked more, 1.
After the bare ceremonies of the Law, which they did press upon others, 1. To
get the favor of the Jews. 2. To avoid persecution by them. v. 12. Then
2. After the substance of it. v. 13.
2. To their doctrine of Circumcision. v. 15.
6. His high esteem of the death of Christ, and the benefits thereby
(regeneration, etc. v. 15.) which makes him scorn, contemn, and no more care
for the world, then for a dead carcass hanging on the Gallows. v. 14. 7. His
desire of quietness, and not to be any more troubled with oppositions of false
teachers, as having suffered too much already. v. 17. 8. His Benediction, 1.
In general, on all those that stick close to his doctrine of justification by
faith. v. 16. 2. In particular, on the Galat: v. last.

The Analysis of the Epistle of Saint PAUL to the EPHESIANS.
CHAP. I.
1. His praise of God for our Election; whereof the ca^^^ are, 1. Efficient;
Gods will merely, not our d^serts. v. 5. 2. Material; Christ Jesus. ibid. 3.
Formal; the preaching of the Gospel v. 8, 9. whereby he makes it know^ to us.
4. Final; Gods glory. v. 6.
2. His prayer to God for their right understanding, 1. Of their Redemption by
Christ. v. 16.17, 18. and inheritance of Heaven b^^ him. ibid. 2. Of Gods
power; 1. In raising their souls from the dea^^ of sin, by their conversion.
v. 19. 2. In raising Christ from the grave, an^ giving him, v. 20. 1. The
honor to sit at his right hand. ibid. 2. The power, rule, dominion and
supremacy: 1. In general; over all things. v. 21. 2. In particular, over the
Church, wherein he is the Head, they the Members. v. 22, 23.




CHAP. II.
1. The state of an Unregenerate man before his conversion; who is, 1. Wholly
dead in sin. v. 1. 2. Led away by the temptations, 1. Of the World. 2. Of the
Devil. v. 2. 3. Of the Flesh. v. 3.
Not: In this state, the Apostle ingeniously confesses, that he was; and the
Jews themselves, as well as the Gentiles, before their conversion. v. 3.
2. The state of a Regenerate man after conversion; who is, 1. Raised from that
death of sin, and sanctified by Christ. v. 5. 2. Saved and justified, 1. By
his mere grace and favor, through Christ, principally. v. 7, 8. 2. By faith,
instrumentally. v. 8. And not, 3. By any works of his own; for two reasons;
1. Because it is Gods mere good pleasure to save him. ibid. 2. Because then he
might boast, as if he were his own Savior. v. 9.

Not: 2. In this state he says they are in; and have the greatest reason of
all others to thank God for it, as being formerly contemned for profane
persons by the Jews for their uncircumcision, v. 11. and living 1. Without the
knowledge of Christ. v. 12. 2. Without the privileges of the Jewish Church,
and the Covenant. ibid. 3. Without the true knowledge of God. ibid.

3. The Pacification and Agreement, 1. Betwixt the Jews and Gentiles; 1. In
making them one Church. v. 14. 2. In taking away the ceremonies which caused
the differences betwixt them. 15.
2. Betwixt God, them and the Jews, v. 16. whereby they have free access to
God, v. 18. and have the honor to be his Church, which for dignity is called,
1. Gods City. v. ibid. 2. Gods Household. ibid. 3. Gods Temple, which is built
upon the doctrine of 1. The Prophets. v. 20. 2. The Apostles. v. 20.



whose foundation is Christ, who was the Peacemaker, and the Corner stone,
ibid. which joined the two walls together, ( i.) the two different parties,
Jews and Gentiles.

CHAP. III.
1. Saint Paul's imprisonment at Rome by the Jews. v. 1. 1. The cause of it,
his preaching Salvation to the Gentiles, and their equality in Gods favor with
the Jews. v. 2. which was, 1. Known imperfectly, and darkely, and but to a
few, in former times. v. 5, 6. 2. Revealed fully and clearly to him, who was
ordained to preach to the Gentiles this Salvation. v. 8. which was procured by
Christ. v. 11. 1. By whom principally they have free access to God. v. 12. 2.
By faith instrumentally. ibid.

2. The dangerous effect which was likely to follow upon it, ( i.) their
falling off from the Gospel, by being discouraged by his sufferings, which he
endeavors to prevent, 1. By his exhortation that they would not faint. v. 13.
backed with this reason, that his suffering was not 1. A disgrace to them, But
2. An honor both to them and the doctrine he suffered for. ibid.
2. By praying for a blessing upon his exhortation (as all Ministers should
do) and that God would give them, 1. Constancy, as might be like 1. The
rooting of a tree; And 2. The ground work of a building. v. 17.
2. Perfect knowledge of his love; as perfect as the knowledge which
Mathematicians have of the Quantity of a thing, when they take the height,
length and breadth of it. v. 18.

2. His patient bearing of his affliction; the sign whereof is his praising of
God; wherein he encourages them to pray to him, by telling them of his
goodness in granting more then they can ask. v. 20, 21.

CHAP. IV.
An Exhortation, 1. In general; to lead such lives as the Gospel which they
profess, requires. v. 1. ( i.) to be Christians; not 1. In a bare name and
profession: But 2. In nature and reality.
2. In particular; to certain Christian virtues; as, 1. Humility. two twin
Sisters. 2. Meekness. two twin Sisters. 3. Patience. v. 2. 4. Love; to which
he persuades them by these arguments; 1. Because they are all Members of the
same Body, whereof Christ is the Head. v. 3. 2. Because they all hope for one
and the same thing ( i.) eternal life. ibid. 3. Because they worship the same
God, profess the same religion, etc. v. 5, 6. 4. Because they cannot live one
without another, by reason that no man has all gifts bestowed upon him, so
that he does not stand in need of the help of another man's gift; for Christ,
after his ascension, sent the Holy Ghost, to give several gifts to several
men, by making, 1. Some Apostles. 2. Others Prophets. 3. Others Evangelists. 4.
Others Pastors and Teachers.



v. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. All which gifts being given to benefit one another, v. 11.
may strongly move us to love and unity.

1. The marks and signs of the Unregenerate man; which are, 1. Vain opinions
of God, and his worship. v. 17. 2. Ignorance of God, etc. v. 18. ( i.)
blindesse of the understanding. 3. Hardness of heart. ibid. 4. Stupidity, and
sensiblenesse of their sins, v. 19. by reason of custom. 5. Disorder of
affections, and perverseness of will. v. 1^. 6. The Aggravation of their sins,
( i.) taking delight in them. i^.
Not: From these courses he disswade^ them. 2. The marks and signs of the
Regenerate, which are called, 1. The renewing in the Spirit. v. 22. 2. Putting
off the old, and putting on the new man. v. 23. 3. A Conformity to Christ,
ibid. which does consist 1. In righteousness, which is an obedience of the
first Table. 2. In holiness, which is an obedience of the second Table. v. 24.


Are 1. Concerning the tongue; speaking of the truth, and wholesome discourse,
without which there can be no civil society and commerce amongst men. v.
25.29. 2. Concerning the heart; 1. The moderation of anger. v. 26. 2. The short
continuance of it. ibid. least Satan draw us to hatred, murders, etc. v. 27.
3. Concerning the hands; 1. Their innocence and freedom from theft and
deceit. 2. Their industry, in laboring 1. To maintain themselves. 2. To help
others. v. 28.

are, 1. Clamorous railing. 2. Slandering and backbiting, whereby the holy

pleasure, (i.) fornication and uncleanness, v. 3. drunkenness. v. 18. 2. The
sins of profit, (i.) covetousness, etc. ibid. because they are damnable
sins. v. 5. 3. Evil company; such as persuade them, that fornication, and
the other sins, are but small sins, v. 6, ^. whom we ought to reprove. v.
11.
2. In o^^ words, in avoiding all discourse which is idle, unprofitable, filthy
and scurrilous. v. 4.

Not: The Reasons for leading a good life, are 1. Because that they which were
darkness before their conversion, v. 8. being now enlightened by the Spirit to
know good from bad, are bound to show their thankfulness to God in good lives.
New profession requires new lives. 2. The opportunity they have, which they
must make use of, because the times are likely to be worse, by persecution. v.
16.
2. In particular, to Family duties; as, 1. The subjection of the wife to the
husband, 1. Because he is her head and ruler, as Christ is of the Church. v.
23. 2. Because her safety and protection does depend upon him. ibid.
2. The affection of the husband to the wife, 1. For Christ his sake, who loved
the Church, though she was deformed, etc. to teach men to love their wives,
though they have not all lovely qualities in them. v. 25, 26, 27. 2. For his
own sake; because in loving his wife, which is a part of him, he loves
himself, v. 28, 29. for they both are one, and a small pourtraicture of that
union betwixt Christ and his Church, which is not, 1. Carnal, But 2.
Spiritual, mysterious, above humane reason to conceive. v. 32.





CHAP. VI.
An Exhortation to more Family duties: 1. Of Children to their Parents, whom
they must obey; 1. Because it is Gods command. v. 1, 2. 2. Because of the
reward they shall have for it; this obedience being the first Commandment which
has the promise, ibid. of blessings; though not, 1. General, as in the second
Command. Yet 2. Particular, ( i.) long life, etc. v. 3.

2. Of Parents to their Children, who are 1. Forbid to deal too severely with
them. v. 4. 2. Commanded to give them good education. ibid.
3. Of Servants to their Masters, whom they must serve, 1. Really, and
heartily. v. 5. And not 2. Hypocritically, and in outward show only: But 3. In
the absence as well as presence of their Masters; not only to be eye-servers,
in working only whilst their Master looks on, v. 6, 7. And to this they are
encouraged by a promise, that God will be a better Paymaster to them for it,
then their Masters. v. 8. 4. Of Masters to their Servants, who are commanded,
1. Not to be too severe to them. v. 9. But 2. Gentle, as knowing that they are
Servants to God, as well as Masters to Servants. ibid.




2. To the maine Christian duty of spiritual warfare, v. 11. wherein he tells
them, 1. Their Enemies, (i.) Satan, and wicked men. v. 12. 2. Their Arms. 1.

3. His Care to acquaint them with his state and condition, by sending Tychicus
to them; who was 1. To tell them how he did do. v. 22. 2. To exhort them not
to grieve too much for his imprisonment. ibid.


4. His usual Conclusion, with a prayer and blessing upon them. v. 23, 24.

The Analysis of the Epistle of Saint PAUL to the PHILIPPIANS.
CHAP. I.
After his wonted Salutation, v. 1, 2. The Apostle,

1. Praises them, 1. For their constancy in their profession of the Gospel,
v. 5. in his absence; which was his joy. v. 4. 2. For their sticking close to
him, 1. In his suffering for the Gospel. 2. In his acting for it. v. 7.

2. Prays for them, 1. For their knowledge; and this, 1. Speculative. 2.
Practical, and experimental. v. 9.

3. For their piety, in doing good works. v. 11.
3. Relates the state and condition in which he was in, viz. his imprisonment
at Rome; whereof he tells the effect; 1. In respect of others who were
converted, and made more resolute by his suffering; whereby the Gospel did the
more increase. v. 12, 13, 14. 2. In respect of himself, who 1. Bore patiently
1. His imprisonment. 2. The preaching of the false Prophets to draw the people
from him. v. 15, 16.
2. Was ready to suffer more for Christ, whom he was confident to gain by, both
in life and death. v. 20, 21.

4. He shows his love of them, and their welfare in the desire of the
continuance of his life; Not 1. For his own sake; because it would be better
for him to dye to enjoy the joys of heaven, then to live to endure more
misery. v. 23. But 2. For their sake, that he might live to do them good;
which he was confident he should do. v. 24, 25, 26.

Lastly, Exhorts them,

1. Not to dishonor their profession by bad lives. v. 27. 2. Not to be
discouraged and drawn from it by any persecution whatsoever, which would be 1.
For the ruin of their persecuters. 2. For the good of them to whom God did
vouchsafe this especial favor; not only, v. 28. 1. To believe in Christ: But
2. To suffer for him, as he had done. v. 29, 30.


CHAP. II.
1. An Exhortation, or rather an adjuration, as they expect to reap any
benefit by Christ; and as they are members of the same mystical body, etc. v.
1. to have 1. Loving and peaceable spirits, whereby they may be all one, both
1. In Opinions; And 2. In affections, v. 2. which will be a great comfort to
him in his affliction. ibid.
2. Public spirits, not regarding their own ends, but the good of others. v.
4. 3. Humble spirits; whereby they may be conformable to Christ, whose Gospel
they profess; whose humility was so great, that though he was a God, v. 6. yet
he condescended so much below himself, as 1. To take upon him our vile flesh.
v. 7. 2. To suffer the ignominious death of the Cross, which was only proper
for bondslaves, v. 8. for which humility he was rewarded 1. With power over all
things. v. 9, 10. 2. With honor and praises from all tongues. v. 11.

4. To avoid carnal security, by working out their salvation with fear and
trembling; v. 12. for this very reason, because they can do no good thing of
themselves. v. 13. 5. To take heed of murmuring and wrangling. v. 14. 6. To
promote the Gospel, both 1. By doctrine; And 2. By life. v. 16.

2. His great care for them, testified, 1. By his intention to send Timothy, 1.
To know in what condition they were in. v. 19. 2. To let them know in what
condition he was in. v. 23. Whom he commends for a man of a public spirit. v.
20.
2. By his intention to visit them himself. v. 24. 3. By sending Epaphroditus
to them, who was sent by them to him with a contribution to supply his wants,
v. 25. and got a dangerous sickness by taking such a long journey to him; and
for whose recovery he praises God, because his death would have added
affliction to his affliction, v. 27. and desires them to receive him at his
return; 1. With joy both for his recovery and return. And 2. With an
honorable respect for hazarding his life for bringing a supply to his
necessity, which he calls a work of Christ. v. 29, 30.


CHAP. III.
1. The Doctrine, 1. Of the false Prophets (whom he exhorts them to avoid, as
being 1. Dogs, barkers against the Gospel. 2. Evil workers, and maintainers
of Concision, (i.) Schism in the Church, rather then Circumcision, v. 1, 2)
which doctrine was justification by the Law, and the carnal descent from
Abraham.
2. Of the Apostle, which is, No confidence to be had in the flesh, (i.) the
carnal descent from Abraham, Ceremonies, and works of the Law, and all other
things without Christ, v. 3. which he did 1. Formerly, when he was a Jew,
account great prerogatives and gain. v. 7. But 2. Now, being converted from
Judaisme, he accounts hindrances and losses. ibid. and all things else in
comparison of Christ, v. 8. for whom 1. He has suffered much, and was content
to do so, so he might 1. Be justified and saved, 1. By faith in him. v. 9. And
not 2. By the works of the Law, ibid. which he will not rely upon.
2. Know him feelingly and practically, the power of his resurrection, v. 10.
in raising him, 1. Here from the death of sin, to the life of grace. 2.
Hereafter from the death of nature, to the life of glory.
3. Be conformable, and like unto him, in suffering for him. ibid.
2. Will suffer more; not thinking that enough which he has done and suffered
already for him, no more then he that runs a race, regards the ground he has
run over: but being (as he humbly confesses) not fully perfect, he will not
keep at a stand, but will labor to be more perfect, v. 12, 13, 14. and
exhorts them to do the like; and 1. To follow, 1. Him, as an example. 2. The
Word, as the rule. 1. Of faith. 2. Of life.

2. To avoid dissension. v. 15, 16, 17.



2. The life, 1. Of the false Prophets; 1. Who mind nothing but earthy things;
the belly, (i) profit and pleasure. 2. Whose actions will be their shame, and
whose end their destruction. v. 18, 19.
2. Of the Apostle, and the converted Philippians he writes to; 1. Who mind
heavenly things. v. 20. 2. Whose end shall be a joyful resurrection to life
everlasting. v. last.


CHAP. IV.
1. An Exhortation, 1. To them in general (whom he speaks to with many loving
expressions) v. 1. 1. To perseverance. v. 1. 2. To courage, and joy in
afflictions. v. 4. 3. To meekness and modesty. v. 5. 4. To a faithful relying

conversation, v. 8. and practice of 1. His doctrine. v. 2. 2. Life. v. 2.


2. To some in particular; 1. To Enodias and Syntiche (two women who had the
office of Deaconship for the poor, who were at some variance) to be
reconciled. v. 2. 2. To the chief Pastor of the Church (to whom he directed
his Epistle to be communicated to the rest) to be helpful to some, that were
his Assistants. v. 3.
2. A thankful Commemoration and remembrance of their benevolence to him to
supply his wants, 1. Formerly, at Thessalonica; which was the more commendable,
because they rereleived him, when he preached to others. v. 16. 2. Of late,
when he was prisoner at Rome, by Epaphroditus; for which he did rejoice, not so
much 1. For his own sake; because his wants were thereby supplied, v. 17.
because he could have been content, if they had sent him nothing, as having
learned the Art of contentment in all estates, as well of adversity as

condition, (i.) of having those virtues before mentioned, v. 8. for the

wherein, 1. The motive cause of it; the love of God, who has 1. Made us
partakers of Heaven, a lightsome place. v. 12. And 2. Has delivered us from
Hell, a darksome place. v. 13.

2. He exhorts them to perseverance in this doctrine, v. 23. for these
reasons; 1. Because he was the Preacher of it, ib. which he would not be, if it
were not true. 2. Because he was a Sufferer for it, and that with
cheerfulness; which did show the truth of it too. v. 24. 3. Because this
doctrine being graciously revealed and made known to them, which was concealed
from former ages, v. 26. did oblige them to continue in it. 4. Because it

3. In his Caution to them to take heed of Imposters, and false Teachers; and

condemn Philosophy it self, as being an useful thing in Divinity) But 2. The
Traditions of men. 3. The Ceremonies of Moses. v. 8. All which are unnecessary
to supply any defect in Christ; because there is no defect in him, and
therefore no need of these (as the false Teachers did tell them) for these
reasons; 1. Because Christ, being God, v. 9. all perfection is in him, and we
perfect in him, without those. v. 10. 2. Because there is no necessity of the
Jewish carnal circumcision, to us that have the spiritual. v. 11. 3. Because

together. v. 14. 4. Of a peaceable and quiet carriage and behavior amongst all
men, v. 15. for these reasons; 1. Because peace was established betwixt them,
being Gentiles, and the Jews, who were formerly at odds. ibid. 2. Because they
were bound to live peaceably to testify their thankfulness for that peace
established amongst them, by being made one Church, who were formerly enemies.
ibid.

6. Why they are to practice these virtues in their newness of life, 1.
Because of their Election. 2. Because of their Baptism, whereby they were
consecrated unto holiness. 3. Because of Gods love unto them, to whom they

Their Faith; which was not a bare one, without good works. v. 3. 2. Their
Charity; which refuses to undergo no toil, and pain, and cost. ibid. 3.
Their Hope; which by the expectation of eternal bliss causes patience in
afflictions. ibid. 4. His assurance, that they were the elect people of God: 1.
Because they received the Gospel, not only in their ears, but hearts. v. 5.
2. Because they cheerfully suffered for it after the example of him, and our
Savior. v. 6. 3. Because they by their examples, life and doctrine, did
encourage others to stick close to the Gospel; as those of Macedonia, and
Achaia.

2. He tells of their fame, and great name that they had through the whole
World (so that there was no necessity of his commendation of them) 1. For their
readiness in receiving the Gospel preached by him. v. 9. 2. For their
conversion from Heathenisme (wherein they served Idols, which were dead Gods)

3. His Commendation of them (to encourage them to go on) for their profitable
and effectual receiving of the Gospel, which they did show, by their patient
suffering persecution for it of the unconverted Gentiles; which he advises
them to think to be no strange thing, because the converted Jews were
persecuted as they, v. 1^, 14. by the unconverted Jews, who did not only
persecute them; but 1. Our Savior. v. 15. 2. The Pr phets. v. ibid. 3.

of his afflictions. v. 3. 1. Because that persecution was the lot of all

1. An Exhortation to holiness of life, which is the end of our justification
and vocation; and which does consist, 1. In the keeping of the eighth
Commandment, (i.) in abstaining from fornication. v. 3. 1. Because it pollutes
the body, which is Gods Temple. v. 4. 2. Because it is the common vice of the

1. Who shall arise; Not only those who shall be alive at the coming of Christ
to judgment (as some fondly did think) v. 15. but also all those that are
dead before. ibid. 2. When they shall arise; at the second comeing of Christ to
judgment, which will be full of glory and terror; with shout, and trumpet
blown by an Archangell. v. 16. 2. The benefit of the Resurrection; they shall
after it, 1. Meet our Savior in the air, when he comes to judgment. v. 17.

of a woman. v. 3. Both which happen often when least of all expected. ibid.
2. The effect which the consideration of Christ's uncertain time of coming
should work in us; which is 1. Not carnal security, as if he would never
come. v. 6. But 2. Continual watchfulness, and expectation of his coming,
ibid. which becomes Christians; 1. Because they are children of light, and of
the day. v. 5.8. (i.) enjoy the light of the Gospel; and sleeping, (i.)
carnal security is not proper for the day, but night. v. 7. 2. Because they
have spiritual enemies, against which they ought all ways to watch, and be in

any unpeaceable behavior. ibid.
2. Concerning one another in their conversation; that they 1. Edify and
benefit one another; 1. By correcting the stubborn. 2. By comforting the
penitent. 3. By strengthening the weak. 4. By using patience in doing all these
three. v. 14.
2. Hurt not one another by revenge of any injury. v. 15.
3. Concerning every particular man alone. 1. To calmnesse of mind in
adversity. v. 16. 2. To Devotion, to be exercised; 1. In prayer at all times.
v. 17. 2. In thanksgiving for every thing. v. 18.

the exposition of the Scripture. v. 20. 5. To distinguish false Teachers from
true, and to adhere to the true. v. 21. 6. To abstain, not only from evil,
but from the very appearance of it. v. 22.

4. The Apostles farewell to them all; wherein is, 1. His prayer, that God
would make them holy more and more, until the coming of Christ; at which time,

The Analysis of the 2. Epistle of Saint PAUL to the THESSALONIANS.
CHAP. I.
After his usual salutation and benediction;

1. His Thanksgiving unto God, (wherein is employed a commendation of the
Thessalonians, to incite them to persevere) v. 3. 1. For the increase of their
faith and charity; 1. By the Word. 2. By the Sacraments.
2. For their patience, (the effect of their faith) in afflictions, v. 4. which
afflictions would be matter, 1. Of reward to the sufferers. v. 5.7. 2. Of
punishment to their persecuters, v. 6. at the coming of Christ to judgment, v.
7. which will be, 1. Glorious, by reason of the Angels that will attend him.
ibid. 2. Terrible to the wicked, who shall then be cast out of his presence. v.
8, 9. 3. Gracious and joyful to his Saints; which will be wondered at for this,
for being in honor and happiness there, who were in scorn and misery here.
v. 10.


2. His Petition unto God for them; and in it, 1. The matter of it. 1. That God
would continue them in that state they were in, and count them worthy of the

CHAP. II.
1. Signs of the nearness of the day of judgment, which some false Prophets
(pretending the spirit) undertaking to foretell, much troubled the people. v.
2. Viz. 1. The miserable state of the Church, by the peoples falling off from
the true worship of God. v. 3. 2. The coming of Antichrist; of whom the Apostle

which is due unto God. v. 4. 2. The beginning of his reign, (i.) the time of
the destruction of the Roman Empire. v. 7. 3. The working and plotting to
maintain his power and greatness; which is, 1. False doctrines. 2. False
miracles, by the power of the Devil. v. 9.
4. His followers, and such as shall be deluded by him; not the Elect, but the
Reprobate, that wilfully refuse the means of their salvation. Concerning whom
we may observe, 1. The manner of their delusions; the drawing away of his grace
from them. 2. The reason why God will leave them, and give them over to such
blindness, is, because of their shutting of their eyes against the light of
the Gospel. v. 12.
5. His Ruin and destruction; 1. Partially, and by degrees here, by the
preaching of the Word. v. 8. 2. Totally, at the day of judgment. ib.


2. The Apostles Thanksgiving to God for their safety from the tyranny and
delusion of Antichrist, which consists in their election unto salvation. v.
13. 1. By the inward calling of the Spirit. ibid. 2. By the outward calling of
the Word. v. 14.
3. His admonition to them to stick close to their Religion, though all the
world besides themselves should stagger, waver, and fall off from it; and not
to part with that which he had taught them, either 1. By word of mouth. v. 15.
Or, 2. By writing. v. 15.
4. His prayer for them; 1. That God would comfort them in afflictions, that

constant, 1. In the profession of true doctrine. 2. In leading good lives. ibid.


CHAP. III.
1. His desire of their prayers; 1. That the Gospel might be dispersed abroad.
v. 1. 2. That it might be adorned by a good conversation. ibid. 3. That it
might not be opposed, 1. Secretly, by Hypocrites. 2. Openly, by Jews and
Heretics.

2. His good opinion of them, that they would not disobey him, as others did.
v. 3. 3. His Exhortation to them, not to keep company with those, that under
pretense of the Gospel, lived idly upon the means of others, without any
calling; whom he calls disorderly persons, v. 6. Which kind of life was, 1.
Contrary to his doctrine, ibid. and v. 10. 2. Contrary to his manner of life,
whereby he confirmed his doctrine; for, notwithstanding his preaching (for
which they were bound to maintain him) he followed his tent-making, that he
might not be changeable. v. 8, 9.
4. His Exhortation to those persons, who though idle, yet were most busy in
meddling with things which did not concern them; that they would live upon
their own labors. v. 12. 5. A Direction for their Charity; which as 1. It was
not to be extended to those idle drones: So 2. It was not to be denied to
others that were in want, for their abuse and unworthiness of it. v. 13.
6. His advise to them, what to do, if those persons would not by admonitions
be drawn to work and labor; which was, to excommunicate them: yet so, as, 1.
To love their persons. 2. To hate their vices. v. 15.
7. The Conclusion of the Epistle; 1. With a Benediction. v. 16. 18. 2. With a
Superscription of his own hand, that they might discern it from counterfeit
Epistles which went in his name. v. 17.

The Analysis of the 1. Epistle of Saint PAUL to TIMOTHY.
CHAP. I.
After his usual Salutation and Benediction;

1. The Apostles charge to Timothy, and in him to all Pastors of Churches, to
be careful to keep out of their Churches, 1. Innovations and new doctrines.
v. 3. 2. Nice and curious disputes; 1. About Jewish ceremonies, concerning
meats, drinks, etc. 2. About Genealogies; wherein the Jews boastingly, and
out of scorn of the Gentiles, derived their pedigree from Abraham. v. 4.

2. His Reason why he did forbid such nice disputes, was, 1. Because they did
not tend to edification and profit of one another. ibid. But 2. Did cause
dissension, and breach of Charity, contrary to the very Law which they did so
much boast of, that were his enemies, v. 5, 6, 7.
3. His Opinion concerning the Law; wherein he shows, that he did not go
about to abolish it by hi^ preaching, (as the false Teachers reported) but thi^
he did think it useful and good. v. 8. 1. For direction; and so to the very
just themselves. 2. For condemnation, and so not to the just, v. 9. but to the
wicked, as Whoremongers, Sodomites, etc.
4. His Vindication of the Gospel; that it was not a destroyer of the Law, (as
some pretended) but maintainer of it, in punishing the same sins condemned by
it. v. 11. 5. His manner of life, 1. Before his conversion; wherein he is not
ashamed to confess what he was, viz. a blasphemer, and a persecuter. v. 13. 2.
After his conversion, which was the exercise of the Ministry, v. 12. wherein he
had as great a measure of grace, as before he had of sin. v. 14.
6. His praise of Gods great goodness, in making him, who was so great a
sinner, 1. The object of his mercy, in saving him. v. 15. 2. The example of it,
for other sinners to trust to in the like case. v. 16.
7. His breaking out of praises into thanksgiving for it. v. 17. 8. His
Repetition of the same charge given to Timothy, v. 3. that he would answer the
expectation of prophecyes made of his being a good pastor; 1. By resisting
(like a stout soldier of Jesus Christ) the enemies of the Church. v. 18. 2. By
professing sound doctrine, and keeping a good conscience; and not making
shipwreck of either, as some had done, as Hymenaeus and Alexander, who denied
the resurrection, and whom he had excommunicated for their amendment. v. 19, 20.

CHAP. II.
1. An Exhortation to men to pray, 1. Generally for all sorts of men
whatsoever. v. 1. 2. Particularly for Kings, though they were Infidels. v. 2.
The Reasons; 1. Because God would have all men saved. v. 4. 2. Because God is

affliction in this life. v. 10.

credit and authority; and 1. Not to suffer his profession to fall into
contempt, by reason of his young years, v. 12. But 2. To supply what was

befall him, for the Gospel, v. 8. and that because God had given him, 1. The
spirit of love, which would undergo any misery for the party loved. v. 7. 2.
Eternal life, of his mere grace and mercy, for the merits of Christ Jesus, v.

unto the converted Jews, (who had a mean opinion of Christ) not to forsake

the forsaking of the Gospel spoken by him, who was greater then they. v. 1, 2.

for stooping so low, v. 9. and so he was not thereby made lower then the

Exhortation, 1. To labor to get it, by mortification of our sins, and
ceasing from our own works. v. 10. 1. By taking warning by the example of
those, that were for their disobedience destroyed in the wilderness. v. 11. 2.
By considering, that they themselves will not escape the same punishment, if
they fall into the same sin; because the Word of God is as quick and sharp
now, as it was then, to denounce judgments to denounce judgments to stubborn
sinners, etc. v. 12, 13.
2. Not to be terrified with what has been spoken concerning the greatness of
Christ: But 3. To go boldly unto him; who is as full of goodness and
meekness, as power and greatness; and one that is as willing as able to help
us; as being not only, 1. Subject to our infirmities, by taking our nature
upon him. v. 15, 16. But 2. Sensible of them. ibid.




CHAP. V.

and forgetting the principles of Religion, concerning, 1. Repentance for
sins. v. 1. 2. Faith in God for pardon. ibid. 3. Baptism. v. 2. 4. Laying on
of hands. ibid. 5. Resurrection. 6. Day of judgment. ibid.
2. In endeavoring to get the knowledge of higher matters. v. 1.
2. Not to go backward, (i.) not to fall from Christianity to Judaisme; by
showing, 1. The danger of Apostasy, and falling away totally from faith in the
Gospel; which being a sin against the Holy Ghost, 1. Against knowledge. 2.
Out of malice and opposition unto God;
cannot be repented of, and so never pardoned. v. 4, 5, 6. 2. The punishment
which God will inflict on those that have the means of knowledge, (i.) Gods
Word; and do not make good use of it; by a similitude taken from thorns. v.
7, 8. 3. Abraham for an example; that they who had been, 1. So forward in
their charity to the poor Saints. v. 10. Might 2. Be as forward in their faith
in Christ Jesus; and be as constant in it, as Abraham was; who for this reason
is called the Father of the faithful, because he was the first that believed
to enjoy those blessings (when there was no likelihood in nature) which God
said he would give him in his son Isaac; so that Gods 1. Promises, v. 14. 2.
Oath confirming them, v. 17.
were the grounds, 1. Of his faith; And 2. Ought to be of 1. Our comfort. v.
18. 2. Our hope; which will be as great support to us in out troubles, as the
Anchor is to sea men, who are in danger of shipwreck. v. 19.






CHAP. VII.
A Comparison betwixt Christ and the Levites; 1. In their persons; wherein is
proved, that Christ is greater then they; 1. In being equal to Melchisedec;
who was, 1. A Type of him; and therefore is said to be without Father and
Mother, to signify his eternity. v. 3. 2. Greater then Abraham from whence
they came; and for this reason greater then they; for his being above Abraham
is proved, 1. By Abraham's paying tithes unto him, v. 4. and the Levites in his
person. v. 9. 2. By Melchisedec's blessing him, v. 7. both which do imply
Abraham to be his inferior

2. In being ordained High Priest by an oath, v. 21. whereby he was more
confirmed a Priest, then the Levites that were made without it. v. 22.
2. In their Priesthoods; wherein is shown, 1. The insufficiency of theirs. 1.
In the short continuance of it; as being altered, when he that was of another
tribe, (i.) of Judah, came into the World. v. 12, 13, 14. 2. In the
imperfection and weakness of it, to make a reconciliation and peace betwixt*
God offended at us for our sins, and us. v. 11, 19.
2. The sufficiency of the Priesthood, to procure pardon for us in him, who 1.
Was free from sin, and so able to satisfy, v. 26. from which the Levites
were not. v. 27. 2. Is eternal; and so is able to save us, by interceding for
us, and speaking in us at Gods right hand, v. 25. and by presenting to God, 1.
Our prayers. 2. Our praises, which are offered up in his name;
whilst the Levites are mortal, and dye. v. 8.23. 3. Who offered up one
sacrifice once for all, whilst they made many with reiteration; which she wed
the imperfection of theirs, and the perfection of his. v. 27.




CHAP. VIII.
A short Repetition of what has been said in the former Chapters; wherein is
proved, that Christ is a Priest differing from the Leviticall Priests; 1. In
place of his residence; he is not, 1. An earthly Priest, nor cannot be; because
earthly Priests were types and shadows of him; and if he had been such an one,
he had been a type of himself. v. 4, 5. But 2. An heavenly. v. 1.
2. In the power of his Priesthood; 1. In abrogating the Covenant of works
under the Law; wherein consider, 1. The cause of its abrogation, viz. the
imperfection of it. v. 6, 7. 2. The reason of that imperfection, viz. the
bringing in of the new Covenant; which would not have been needful, if the
former had been perfect. v. 7.
2. In establishing the Covenant of grace, which excels the old Covenant; 1.
In respect of a greater measure of knowledge which we have by it, then the
Fathers had by the old. v. 10, 11. 2. In respect of the justification of our
persons in the forgiveness of our sins freely for Christ's sake. v. 12.




CHAP. IX.
A Comparison betwixt the Sactifice of Christ; And The sacrifices of the Law;
wherein we may observe, 1. The meannesse and small power those of the Law had,
because they were merely carnal, and therefore did not purge, 1. The
conscience, which was a spiritual things. v. 9. But 2. Merely the flesh.
2. The excellency of Christ's sacrifice, proved, 1. From the matter whereof it
was made; which was not 1. The blood of bulls and goats: But 2. The blood of
himself.
2. From the efficacy of it; proved, 1. By comparing it with that of goats,
etc. that if they did purisy, much more his blood. v. 13, 14. 2. By doing that
perfectly at once, which the High Priests did imperfectly endeavor to do at
many times; whereas, 1. They offered every year for sin. v. 25. He 2.
Offered himself but once for all. v. 28. in that 1. He did dye once; And 2. He
could but dye once, for this reason, because it is appointed for all men once,
and but once to dye. v. 27.







CHAP. X.
A further prosecution of the same doctrine, concerning 1. The insufficiency of
the sacrifices of the Law to justify any, or pardon sins, v. 1. proved by
reasons taken, 1. From the nature of those sacrifices, which were 1. Merely
shadows of that which was to be perfected by Christ; And not 2. Any real
substance at all able of themselves as much as to satisfy for the least sin.
v. 1.
2. From the reiteration and frequent use of them; whereof were offered, Some
once a year. v. 3. Others daily. v. 11.
Note If these sacrifices had been sufficient to pardon sins, one offering
would have been enough. 3. From the disproportion betwixt them and sins;
whereby it was impossible that the blood of goats and bulls should take away
sins, v. 4. Because 1. They were carnal, sins spiritual. 2. They were
finite, sins infinite, as being committed against an infinite God.
4. By Scripture authority (to let them know, that it was not only his saying)
whereby it is said, that God refused those sacrifices, as things insufficient
to justification. v. 5, 6, 7, 8.
2. The sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice; which 1. Did make satisfaction for
sin at one time, which the Priests could not make at many times. v. 10. 2.
Did put an end to all sacrifices for the time to come, by obtaining a full
pardon for sins. v. 18.
3. The Use of the Doctrine, grounded upon the consideration of our access to
God by prayers, through Christ Jesus, and many other benefits. v. 19, 20, 21.
1. Of Exhortation unto faith; and in it, 1. To a perseverance in it. v. 23. 2.
To a bringing forth of the fruits of it, in a good life. v. 24.
2. Of Dehortation, whereby he forbids them, 1. To be Schismatickes, in
forsaking the Church, out of pride, singularity, etc. and thereby breaking
Christian love and charity. v. 25. 2. To be Apostates, in falling away from
that Religion they had been brought up in, by reason of any persecution
whatsoever. v. 26. 1. Totally and wilfully. ibid. 2. With delight. 3. Against
knowledge and conscience, Because for such wilful falling away they must
expect. 1. No mercy. ibid. But 2. Punishment at the day of judgment, v. 27.
which will be, 1. Great; because the punishment of the contempt of Moses his
Law, (which was a less sin then the contempt of Christ's mercy, and merits) was
so great. v. 28, 29. 2. Will certainly be inflicted; because God is a God of
justice and vengeance, as well as mercy. v. 30, 31.



3. Of Caution against impatience; and that they do not fall into it, for
these reasons; because, is They had formerly stoutly endured afflictions; which
were, 1. Great, full of contention, like unto battles. v. 32. 2. Sharpened
with public scorn and derision, v. 33. and therefore a shame to be worse
then they had been.
2. God would reward them for it. v. 35. 3. The reward would be certain,
because promised by God. v. 36. 4. Their comfort and relief would not be long
deferred. v. 37. 5. Their faith would make them live cheerfully in the midst of
all afflictions. v. 37. 6. They were not of the number of backsliders. v. last.




CHAP. XI.
1. A Description of Faith. v. 1. 2. The danger of the want of it. v. 6. 3. The
various and several effects of it, proved in many examples, especially of the
Fathers of old time, who were famous for what they did by it, and suffered for
it* v. 2. As, 1. The knowledge of the Creation, and 1. Its Author. v. 3. 2. Its
manner, ibid. which many learned Philosophers with all their study could not
find out.
2. The acceptance both of, 1. Our persons in Abels example. v. 4. 2. Our
actions in Abels example. v. 4.
3. Freedom from death, in the example of Enoch, who was translated. v. 5. 4.
Watchfulness and providence to prevent future evils, in the example of Noah;
who, 1. Believing a flood to come, provided an Arc to save himself and family.
v. 7. Whilst others 2. Disbelieving it, were through carnal security drowned.
ibid.
5. A strong trust and confidence in God for maintenance, and a livelihood, at
all times, and in all places, in the example of Abraham, whose faith made him,
1. Willing to leave his own Country. 2. Confident to have a better (i.) in
Heaven. v. 8, 9.
6. Temporal blessings beyond all expectation, in the example of Sarah, who
had a child unlooked for, against the ordinary course of Nature. v. 11, 12. 7.
Self-denial; in the example of Abraham, who denied his fatherly affection to
his Son, in offering up Isaac. v. 17, 18, 19. 8. A strong relying upon Gods
providence for all good things; not only, 1. Toward a man's self; But 2.
Toward his posterity, in the examples of Isaac and Jacob, who by this
confidence bestowed estates upon their posterity, which were not then in their
possession. v. 20, 21.
9. Courage to do things even to the hazard of life; in the example of the
parents of Moses, who preserved him though the King had forbid it upon pain of
death. v. 23. 10. Contempt of the World, (i.) the riches and pleasures of it;
in the example of Moses, who left his Courtiers life, to live a miserable life
with the afflicted Israelites. v. 24, 25, 26. 11. Gods protection of them that
do undertake dangerous journies; in the example of the Israelites, who were
preserved in their journey through the Red Sea. v. 29. 12. Victory by weak
means, in the example of Jericho, conquered by Rams horns. v. 30. 13.
Preservation in the midst of dangers; in the examples, 1. Of Daniel preserved
in the Lions den. v. 33. 2. Of the three Children preserved in the flames of
fire. v. 34.
14. Deliverance from dangers, in the example of Rahab, v. 31. and others. v.
34. 15. Victory over dangers. v. 34. 16. Miraculous recovery of life, in the
example of the woman of Sereptaes child, raised by Elias. v. 35. 17. A
stoutnesse and valor; 1. In refusing the offers of life, upon terms of
forsaking their faith and Religion. v. 35. 2. In enduring, 1. Afflictions, 1.
In their names. v. 36. 2. In their bodies. 1. By imprisonment, and whippings.
ibid. 2. By disconsolate wandering up and down. v. 37, 38.

2. Martyrdom, of several kinds; as stoning, sawing asunder, etc. v. 37.


4. And Lastly; A strong Motive to stir them up to faith, by considering the
faith of them of old; and how that it would be a great shame for them, 1. Not
to believe in Christ already come; When as 2. They of old, which received not
the promises, v. 13.39. did strongly believe in Christ before his coming.

CHAP. XII.
The Christians journey; wherein, 1. The nature of it; it is rugged and thorny;
employed in these words, Run with patience. v. 1. 2. The end of it, (i.)
Heaven. 3. Our guides in it, and examples to follow, that we be not discouraged
with those afflictions that are in it: And these are, 1. The Fathers of old,
mentioned in the former Chapter, who by faith overcame great afflictions. v. 1.
2. Christ Jesus, whom we are chiefly to observe in this journey; and to
consider, 1. The greatness of his person; 1. In respect of power; he is the
Author and finisher of our faith. v. 2. 2. In respect of his honor, he sits at
Gods right hand ibid.
2. The greatness of his sufferings, afflictions in body and name, ibid. So
that out afflictions are nothing to his. 3. His encouragement to suffer, (i.)
the consideration of the joys of Heaven to be after all this enjoyed. ibid.

4. Our comforts and refreshments against afflictions, least we faint under
them, in the serious consideration, 1. Of the smallness and lightness of our
sufferings, which are not the loss of life, as Christ's was. v. 4. 2. Of the
causes of them, which is Gods love; in that they proceed from God, not 1. As an
angry Judge; But 2. As a loving Father. v. 5, 6, 7. and therefore if we
patiently suffer, 1. The corrections of our earthly Fathers, who often
corrects, out of passionate anger, to please themselves; much more should we 2.
The chastisements of God, who is our heavenly Father; and corrects us, not to
please himself, but profit us. v. 9, 10.
3. Of the benefit by them; for though afflictions are, 1. Hurtful and
unpleasant to the body. v. 11. Yet they are 2. Helpful and profitable to the
soul. ibid.
5. Directions for our behavior in this journey; which are, 1. Not to be
dejected, nor to hang down our hands and heads for any affliction whatsoever.
v. 12. 0208 1440 V But rather, 2. To make all Gospel precepts tot he bearing
of afflictions easy to us, by a constant practice of them. v. 13. 3. To be of a
peaceable and holy conversation in all our ways. v. 14.
4. To take heed, 1. Not to go out of the right way^, by falling into
heresies. v. 15. 2. Not to go back again, when we are in the right way,
ibid. for grace being once lost, is hard to be recovered; as appears by the
example of Esau, who could not recover the blessing which he lost, v. 16, 17.
which he too late did seek for with tears; which were, not 1. Of repentance,
and sorrow for his sin: But 2. Of discontent, and disdain against his Brother
for a temporal loss. ibid.

6. Reasons to persuade us to walk well in this our Christian journey; which
are, 1. The greatness of mercies already received; in that we Christians do
not live, 1. Under the threats and terrors of the Law, which was given 1. With
a fearful sound of the trumpet. 2. With dreadful flames of fire. 3. With
terrible storms. v. 18, 19. But

2. Under the sweet mercies of the Gospel; which does not, 1. Threaten death
to sinners; But 2. Promise life and pardon, if they be penitent, through the
blood of Christ, which does not cry, 1. For vengeance, as Abels did: But 2. For
mercy and pardon. v. 24.

2. The greatness of judgments which will be inflicted on us, if we do not
walk answerable to this great mercy. 1. In respect of the greatness of the
person of Christ; for if the contempt of Moses, who was but a Servant upon
Earth, was severely punished: how much more will the despising of the mercies
by Christ Jesus our great Master in Heaven? v.25. 2. In respect of the nature
of God; who though
1. He He has been merciful to us, in giving us his Son to satisfy for
our sins: Yet 2. He will be just, in punishing us, if we presume upon that
mercy, and walk* not in some measure worthy of it. v. 29.

themselves; 1. In body; as chastity. v. 4. 2. In estate; as contentedness. v.

The Analysis of the General Epistle of Saint JAMES.
CHAP. I.
In this Epistle (which was writ to the afflicted and dispersed Jews after
their captivities, by Saint James, who was

1. Not the son of Zebedee: But v. 1. of this Chapter; 2. Of Alpheus, v. 1.
of this Chapter;
He speaks,

1. Of the evil of Affliction; and, 1. Of our behavior in it; which must be,
1. With patience; whereof, 1. The cause is faith. v. 3. 2. The perfection,
which is perseverance to the end. v. 4.

2. With cheerfulness; in that 1. Though he be low one way, in being
afflicted. v. 9. Yet 2. He is exalted another way, in having interest in Christ
Jesus. ibid.
2. Of our way to get the knowledge of the Author, effects and benefits of this
affliction, which is prayer, v. 5. which if it be made 1. With faith and
confidence in God that he will grant it: It will be 2. Successful, because
God is bountiful and liberal to grant. v. 5, 6, 7, 8.
3. The benefit by it; eternal joy for momentary sorrow. v. 12.
2. The evil of Prosperity which is pride and vanity, employed in the virtue
which the rich are bound to give God thanks for, (i.) humili^y; which virtue
is got by a serious consideration of the vanity of all earthly things, which
are compared to the flowers of the field. v. 10, 11. 3. The evil of Sin, and
the cause of it; which is, 1. Our own natural corruption; which 1. Drawe^h us
from that which is good. v. 14. 2. Entiseth us to that which is evil. ibid.
And not
2. God; who is not, 1. The Author of evil: But 2. Of every good thing. 1.
Temporal. 2. Spiritual; and in particular, of our regeneration, by the
preaching of the Word, v. 18. by which great gift of regeneration, being
received, we are bound to do the works thereof.


1. In avoiding those common sins, 1. Of hearing 2. Of speaking 1.
Unprofitable; 2. Angry and passionate talk. v. 14.
2. In the diligent hearing of Gods Word. v. 21, 22. 3. Serious meditation of
Gods Word. v. 21, 22. 4. Faithful practice of Gods Word, v. 21, 22. in the
looking into the glass of Gods Word; not 1. Slightly, to see our sins, and
presently after to forget them, without any care to amend them; like those that
slightly look into glasses, to see the faults of their faces, and afterward
never mend them. v. 23, 24. But 2. Seriously, with resolution to amend all. v.
25. And to be a Christian, not only,
1. In outward show and profession of Religion: But 2. In the true exercise of
it; 1. In keeping in the tongue from wronging others by detraction, and bitter
talk. v. 26. 2. In stretching out the hand to the charitable relief of
afflicted people; as fatherless and widows. v. 27. 3. In living a life free
from all scandal. ibid.




CHAP. II.
How Christians should esteem and think of others;

1. For their riches; and for these only men are not to be honored: because
rich men are usually, 1. Oppressors. v. 6. 2. Contemners of Religion. ibid.
2. For their poverty; and for this no man is to be scorned, and contemned; 1.
Because God respects the poor, in bestowing his graces upon them often in a
more plentiful manner then upon the rich. v. 5. 2. Because Charity commands us
to love them. v. 8. 3. Because the uncharitable contempt of them, is the breach
of the Law, though all the other parts of the Law be performed. v. 9, 10* 11.
4. Because merciful judging of these men, without scorned and hatred, will be
rewarded, v. 13.
3. For their outward profession of their faith; and for this only men are not
to be esteemed true believing Christians; for where there is not a good life
answerable to their outward show of Beligion, there is no true faith; for
faith, which does j^stifie, is not,
1. A bare naked and historical faith, for this: 1. Does help others no more,
then wishing the poor meat, does fill their bellies. v. 15, 16. 2. Does not
distinguish a man from a Devil. v. 19. But 2. A working faith; which by good
works does

1. Declare and testify it self before men. v. 18. 2. Justify us before God,
as it did 1. Abraham; not for bare believing, but for doing, (i.) in offering
up his son. v. 23. 2. Rahab, not only for a bare belief of Gods promises,
but for her good works in entertaining the Spies sent by Joshua. v. 25.
3. Preserve its life, in the exercise of it self by good works; which though
they be not, 1. The soul of faith; which is the cause of them: Yet 2. They are
the vital spirit and breath of faith, whereby the life of it may be discerned.
v. last.

CHAP. IIII.
We must be meek in reproving others;

1. Because we our selves are faulty as well as others, v. 1. 1. Especially in
many things. v. 2. 2. In particular, in not governing our tongues; the
government whereof, 1. Shows discretion. ibid. 2. Is difficult; 1. In respect
of its power over other things; wherein it is compared to a bit of a bridle,
and a helm of a ship; which, like the tongue, are. 1. Little in substance. 2.
Great in operation.
2. In respect of the unrulinesse of that power, which is more then that of
wild beasts.

3. Is necessary; 1. To prevent dissentions, murders, and miseries which
proceed from the unrulinesse of it. v. 6. 2. To keep it from that unnatural
monstrous way of venting things quite contrary, as piety and impiety, cursing
and blessing; whereas it was made only for blessing. v. 9, 10, 11, 12.
2. Because to be bitterly and enviously consorious, is not 1. Heavenly
wisdom; whose fruits are, 1. Peaceablenesse, 2. Gentleness, But 3. Easiness
to be entreated. 4. Mercifulness. v. 13, 1^, 18.
2. Earthly, and hellish. v. 15.


CHAP. IV.
1. Of the Flesh, and the lusts thereof; whose effects are, 1. Quarrelling and
contention. v. 1. 2. Insatiablenesse with what they have. v. 2. 3. Vain and
wicked prayers for riches. Not 1. To supply their necessity: But 2. To
maintain their roitousnesse. v. 3.

2. Of the World; and 1. The love of it; which is spiritual adultery and
enmity with God. v. 4. 2. The pride in it; which is hateful to God. v. 6. 3.
Trust, and confidence, and joy in the riches of it, more then in Gods
providence; which proceeds from a want of a serious consideration, 1. Of the
shortness of life. 2. Of the uncertainty of riches. v. 13, 14, 15.
4. Uncharitable speaking ill of others; whereby men sin, 1. Against the Law;
in judging others: Not, 1. According to its rule: But 2. According to our own
wills. v. 11.


2. Against God; in usurping that judgment of others upon them, which belongs
to him. v. 12.
3. Of the Devil; against whom we are, 1. Encouraged to fight; 2. Promised
victory. v. 7.
4. A Remedy against all these forementioned sins; which is a turning unto God,
v. 8. with repentance; which must be both, 1. With outward weeping of the eyes.
v. 9. 2. With inward sorrow and humiliation of heart. v. 10.

CHAP. V.
1. Comforts to the afflicted: 1. By telling them the calamities and judgments
that will befall their Oppressors, (i.) the rich men of the world; whereof, 1.
Some are too covetous, in hoording up riches, and letting them rather rust and
canker, and corrupt, then relieve the needy by being laid out. v. 2, 3. 2.
Others are too prodigal, in spending their wealth to maintain their sensual
lusts and pleasures, v. 5. 3. Others are deceitful, in not paying the
hirelings their wages. v. 4. 4. Others are Oppressors of the godly. v. 6.
2. By exhorting them to patience; 1. By laying before them the patience of
Husbandmen, who in their labors and toils wait patiently for the harvest. v.
7. 2. By telling them their speedy deliverance. v. 8. 3. By showing them, that
afflictions are no new and strange unusual things; for they have besalne, 1.
The Prophets of old, who were patient under them. v. 10. 2. Job, who is famous
unto this day for his patience. v. 11.
4. By telling them the reward of patience, which is happiness. ibid. 5. By
showing the danger of impatience, in that it causes swearing and cursing; from
both which he disswades them most earnestly. v. 12.

2. Directions what to be done in all times; as, 1. In times of prosperity;
praising of God for it. 0208 1440 V 2 v.13. 2. In times of adversity; praying
to God for comfort. 0208 1440 V 2 ibid. 3. In times of sickness and infirmity;
1. Of the body; sending as well, 1. For the Physician of the soul, to pray
with the sick, and for them v. 14. As, 2. For the Physician of the body.
2. Of the mind; when any is in an error; and this is, 1. Confession made by
the sinner to some, that may either comfort or instruct him. v. 16. 2. Prayer
for him; which is proved to be an effectual remedy, by the example of the
powerful prayer which Elias made. v. 16, 17. 3. Instruction of him, to draw
him from his erroneous ways; which will be, next under God, the salvation of
his soul. v. 19, 20.



The Analysis of the 1. Epistle general of Saint PETER.
CHAP. I.
1. His Salutation; wherein is shown, 1. His Condition, what he is, (i.) an
Apostle, etc. v. 1. 2. Their Condition, what they are, (i.) converted Jews,
(whereof he was a Doctor, as Saint Paul was of the Gentiles) who are, 1.
Miserable in respect of this life, as being dispersed and scattered by
persecution. ibid. 2. Happy in respect of the next life, as as being separated
from the world by election, v. 2. of which we may observe, 1. The cause; Gods
decree. ibid. 2. The marks and signs; holiness of life; and this wrought by
the Spirit. ibid. 3. The means whereby it was wrought, (i.) blood of Christ
Jesus. ibid.

those graces, (i.) abundance. ibid.
3. His praises of God; 1. For their strong hope of a better life, v. 3.
wherein is laid down, 1. The cause of this hope; which is, 1. Not our merits;
But 2. Gods mercy. ibid.
2. The certainty of it, (i.) the resurrection of Christ. ibid. 3. The benefits
which we shall reap by this hope; which are, 1. Joy in afflictions in this
life. v. 6. 2. An inheritance in the next life; which will not be like this
earthly; 1. Impure and fading: But 2. Pure and everlasting. v. 4.


2. For their faith; where we may consider, 1. Its nature; 1. In supporting
that hope in the midst of of all afflictions, v. 5. which are, 1. The trial of
faith it self, in this life. v. 7. And will be 2. For the honor and glory of
the faithful, at the day of judgment. ibid.
2. In believing things not seen and not had, as already enjoyed, (i.) joys
in Christ Jesus. v. 8.
2. Its reward; salvation by Christ Jesus. v. 9. Concerning which we may
further observe, 1. Its worth and excellency; in that the Prophets made it
their chief and maine study to know both, 1. The substance of this salvation;
And 2. The circumstances of it. viz. 1. The manner of Christ's 1. Manifestation.
2. Suffering in the flesh, v. 11.
2. The time thereof. ibid.
2. Its coming to pass in their days; whereby they were more happy then the
Prophets, who did not live to see Christ in the flesh. v. 12.


4. Their duty to God for his great mercy, in having the manifestation of

1. In meats and drinks; But 2. In all other fleshly desires. v. ibid.
3. In the perseverance of a hope of our better life. ibid. 4. In living holy
lives; 1. Because God is a loving Father; and Children ought to imitate their
Fathers virtues. v. 14. 2. Because God is a holy God; who has 1. Called us, to
the end we might be holy. v. 15. 2. Commanded us to be so. v. 16.
3. Because God is a severe Judge, and will punish offenders. v. 17. 4. Because
they were redeemed from sin, that they might sin no more; Not 1. With
sums of money, as Gally-slaves are redeemed from the Turkish slavery: But 2.
With the precious blood of Christ Jesus, whereby they were set at liberty from
the slavery, 1. Of Sin. v. 18, 19. 2. Of Satan. v. 18, 19.

fail. v. last.




CHAP. II.
An Use of Exhortation of his doctrine in the last Chapter, to the fruits of
regeneration, and the duties of the regenerate men, (who are compared to new
babes) v. 2.

1. In forsaking, 1. The sins of the heart; as malice and envy. v. 1. 2. The
sins of the tongue; as all evil speaking to and of others. ibid. 3. The
lusts of the flesh; which 1. Are unfit for us, who are strangers in this world,
and ought not to regard, 1. The carnal things on earth: But 2. The spiritual
things in heaven.
2. Are hindrances to the salvation of our souls. v. 11.

2. In a delightful hearing of the Word; which is 1. Compared to milk; 1. For
its purity. 2. For its sweetness. 3. For the nourishment and increase by it.
v. 2.
2. Sharpened and increased by a taste and experimental knowledge of Gods
goodness to us in Christ Jesus. v. 3.
3. In laying hold on Christ by a lively faith, v. 4. who is not only, 1. The
Foundation of the Church, in being a Corner Stone of it. v. 7. whereby we are
built and edified by the preaching of the Word. v. 5. But 2. The preservation
of it; by giving life and virtue to it, as being a living Stone. v. 4. and a
Savior; not 1. Of Infidels; who for want of says, 1. Are contemners and
undervaluers of salvation by Christ Jesus. v. 7. 2. Shall be destroyed, and
have no benefit in Christ's merits. v. 8. But
2. Of Believers; who by faith highly esteem the salvation by him. v. 7.

4. In not being scandalous in their lives, that their Religion might not be
ill spoken of by the Heathen, for the bad lives of the Professors of it. v.
12. 5. In obedience to Governors; 1. Because they are appointed by God, for
punishment of vice, and encouragement of virtue. v. 14. 2. Because disobedience
of Superiors, will make the Heathens speak ill of their Religion. v. 15. 3.
Because Christian liberty does free all, 1. From sin, and the rigor of the
Law; Not 2. From obedience to Magistrates. v. 16.

6. In respecting all men; and this, 1. In loving those of our own profession,
v. 2. in giving obedience, not only 1. Active: But 2. Passive; in suffering
wrongfully of those that are our Masters, though they be Infidels, and not of
our Religion. v. 18. 1. Because wrongful suffering will be rewarded hereafter.
v. 19. 2. Because such suffering is the lot of all Christians. v. 21. 3.
Because Christ suffered the like. v. 21, 22, 23, 24.

2. The Apostles Reasons of his Exhortation to these works of Regeneration; 1.
Because they were chosen and separated from the World, like Priests. v. 9. 2.
Because of a contemptible and despised people, they were made by Gods special
favor, a peculiar people, purchased by the blood of Christ. ibid. 3. Because
they were called, 1. From darkness to light, (i.) ignorance of salvation to
the knowledge thereof. ibid. 2. From by-ways, (i.) sinful courses, to the
true way, (i.) newness of life. v. last. And all this for no other end, but to
glorify God, by living holy lives, answerable to these great mercies of God.



CHAP. III.
Of Duties; which are,

1. Particular; and these, 1. Of Wives; which are, 1. In respect of their
Husbands, to whom they are to be obedient, though they are unbelievers, v. 1.
because such obedience will be 1. For the good of their Husbands, who are
unconverted, by bringing them to a good liking of their Religion, by their
chaste and obedient carriage. v. ibid. 2. For the honor of themselves, in as
much as the Scripture makes honorable mention of Sarah, for her obedience to
her husband Abraham. v. 5, 6.
2. In respect of themselves; in using such apparel as may be; Not, 1. Gaudy,
and whorish. v. 3. But 2. Decent and modest; and not regarding so much the
ornament of the body, as of the mind: which though it be not so visible to the
eye, as that of the body, yet it is, 1. More lasting and durable, and which
will not wear, as that of the body. v. 4. 2. More pleasing; though not, 1. To
the eyes of men: Yet 2. To the eyes of God. ibid.


2. Of Husbands; who are to use, 1. Discretion toward their Wives, v. 7.
Either, 1. In reforming their faults: Or, 2. In bearing with them till they be
amended.
2. In respect unto them; 1. Because they are the more apt to offend, as being
the weaker vessel. v. ibid. 2. Because they shall partake of the joys of
Heaven, as well as their Husbands. ibid. 3. Because that brawling betwixt man
and wife, will be but a hindrance to their devotion. v. ibid.


^. General, of all Christians; to be loving, 1. In thoughts. v. 8. 2. In
words. v. 9. 3. In doeds. v. 8, 9. 1. Because they are Brethren of the same
Profession and Religion. v. 8. 2. Because it is the end of our vocation, to do

only way to live, 1. Peaceably with all men. v. 10. 2. Happily in Gods favor
and protection. v. 12.
4. Because innocent and harmless living, is the only way to be free from the
wrongs, even of the worst sort of people. v. 13.

2. To be patient in the midst of all wrongs and injuries; and in them, 1. To
carry themselves toward their Persecuters; Not 1. With base fear: But 2. With
manly courage. v. 14.
2. To carry themselves toward God; Not 1. With murmuring against him. But 2.
By sanctifying him, v. 15. 1. By praising him. 2. By trusting and hoping in him.

3. To follow the example of Christ; and not to take it ill if they suffer
wrongfully, when as Christ himself was not free from afflictions, v. 18. and
did not only suffer, 1. By unjust men; But 2. For unjust men. ibid. Who is,

1. More righteous and holy then they; in doing good, Not only 1. In the
flesh, in the New Testament: But 2. By his Spirit, in the Old; by inspiring
Noah to preach repentance to those sinners of his time; whereof, 1. Some, for
not repenting, are now damned in Hell. v. 19. 2. Others, upon repentance, were
saved by water, v. 20. to which water Baptism may be compared, whose virtue
does consist; Not 1. In the bare outward act of washing the outside of the
body: But 2. In cleansing the inside of the soul. v. 21.

2. More powerful; in that though 1. He died in the flesh: Yet, v. 18. 2. He
was quickened by the Spirit. v. ibid.
3. More honorable; in that he sits at Gods right hand. v. last.


CHAP. IV.
An Exhortation to many Christian duties, taken from the Doctrine of our
Redemption, mentioned in the former Chapter; As,

1. To mortification of the flesh; wherein we have, 1. The motives to it; which
are, 1. The consideration of the death of Christ. v. 1. 2. The serious
consideration of our former ill led lives. v. 3.
2. The effect of it; which is not the taking away, 1. Of the very essence and
being of sin: But 2. Of the power and dominion of it. v. 1.

they are, (i.) trials of our faith. v. 12. 2. Their kinds; which are, 1. In
estate; as loss of riches. 2. In body; as loss of health. 3. In name; as

which Christians were persecuted in those Primitive times.
4. Their Extent; which is to all men, good and bad. v. 17. 5. Our behavior

them, as new things, that never happened to any but our selves. v. 12. 2. In

Because we have Christ for the Example of our sufferings. ibid. 2. Because we
shall have joy for the reward of our grief. ibid. 3. Because it is the lot of
all Christians. v. 17.

The Analysis of the 2. Epistle general of Saint PETER.
CHAP. I.
1. His Salutation of the same persons writ to in his former Epistle; wherein
is, 1. His calling; and this, 1. General; a Christian. v. 1. 2. Particular; an
Apostle. ibid.
2. Their calling; which is the profession of the Christian faith: whereof
consider, 1. The worth of it; as being precious. ibid. 1. In respect of its
Object, (i.) Christ. 2. In respect of its End, (i.) the salvation of our souls.
2. Its comparison with the faith of the Apostle; which is the same, 1. In
respect of its virtue. v. ibid. Though not 2. In respect of its degree.
3. The cause of it; Gods mercy: in that it is, Not, 1. A work of our selves:
But 2. A gift of God, through the righteousness of him, and our Savior. ibid.
3. His prayer for them. v. 2. 1. For grace and peace. ibid. 2. For their
increase in both. v. ibid.


2. His Exhortation of them to holiness of life; 1. In leaving off the sins
which they have followed in the time past. v. 4. 2. In becoming new men for the
time to come, by a constant endeavor to get, by the assistance of Gods grace.
1. A working, and no bare and naked faith, but such as is joined with a good
life. v. 5. 2. Knowledge in the mysteries of Religion. v. ibid. 3. Temperance
in prosperity, in the moderate use of all temporal blessings. v. 6. 3.
Patience in adversity; in the meek bearing of all afflictions. v. ibid. 5.
Godliness toward God, in serving him. ibid. 6. Charity; 1. In a more
especial manner, to our brethren of the same profession. v. 7. 2. In a more
general manner to all men whatsoever. ibid.


3. The Reasons of his Exhortation; 1. Because we are engaged to live holy
lives, by the goodness of God to us: which sufficiently appears, 1. By his
gifts; which 1. Are all things belonging to our temporal and spiritual life.
v. 3. 2. Are wrought, through knowledge, in Christ Jesus. ibid.
2. Because by his reward of those gifts; which is, exceeding great promises,
v. 4, 2. Because we are called, 1. To live holy lives here; That we may, 2.
Live happy lives hereafter. v. 3.
3. Because, by a holy life, we are made like unto God: Not 1. According to his
Divine Nature, and Essence; as if we had thereby the Godhead in us: But 2.
According to his Divine Image; in righteousness and purity of the soul. v. 4.
4. Because the knowledge of Christ, without a good life, is, 1. No true
knowledge; for this is fruitful in a good life. v. 8. But, 2. False,
hypocritical, and boasting in a mere shadow and blindness. v. 9.
5. Because a holy life does strengthen our assurance of our Election. v. 10.
6. Because a holy life is the Pathway to Heaven. v. 11.

4. The Earnestness of his Exhortation, in pressing it so much upon them; and
that by reason, 1. Of the frailty of their memories, though their
understandings were good. v. 12, 13. 2. Of the frailty of his mortal body,
whereby he was not to continue long with them to instruct them; and therefore,
the shorter his time was to be with them, the more diligent he would be in his
Ministry. v. 14.
5. His Defense of the truth of the doctrine, (which he preached) against all
gainsayers, which was concerning Christ Jesus; whose wonderful power was, 1.
No lie and fable of his own devising, to deceive the people. v. 16. 2. No new
thing, never heard of before. But 3. A Real truth; which 1. He had seen with
his eyes. v. ib. 2. They themselves had read with their eyes, in the Prophers.
v. 19. who foretold all that power and Majesty of Christ Jesus: Not, 1. Of
their own heads and fancies. v. 20, 21. But 2. By the inspiration and
direction of the Holy Spirit. v. last.



CHAP. II.
Of Heretics; in which discourse the Apostle shows, 1. The necessity and
unavoidablenesse of the being of such kind of men; that none may think it
strange, or be discouraged at it; in that Heretics 1. Have been of old, in
the time of the Law, amongst the Israelites. v. 1. 2. Will be in our days, in
the time of the Gospel, amongst the Christians. 1. To try the faith of some.
2. To exercise the patience of others.

2. The doctrines of these Heretics. 1. The denial of the principles of
Religion; as Redemption by Christ. v. 1. 2. Licentiousness of life, under
pretense of Christian liberty. v. 19.
3. Their ends and designs, which are gain and profit; as Balaams design
was, when he went to curse the Israelites merely for a reward. v. 3. 14, 15. 4.
Their ways to obtain those ends. 1. A subtle pretense of Religion, in
speaking some truths; to foist and bring in privily their false doctrines. v.
1. 2. Fair flattering speeches. v. 3.18.
5. Their power, in drawing many after them. v. 2. 6. The manner of their
lives; they are, 1. Hypocrites, that make a fair show outwardly, yet are wels
without water, (i.) Professors without doing any good. v. 17. 2. Troublesome
and turbulent men in the Commonwealth. 1. In speaking dishonourably of them
that are in authority, v. 10. which the Angels themselves, their betters, would
never do. v. 11. 2. In not submitting peaceably to their government. v. 10.
3. Intemperate men; 1. In their gluttony. v. 13. 2. In their drunkenness. v.
ibid. 3. In their uncleanness, and want of chastity. v. 14.

7. The misery which they will bring, 1. Upon themselves, (i.) great
judgments. v. 1.3. which will as certainly befall them, as they did befall, 1.
The Angels. v. 4. 2. Those before the flood. v. 5. 3. Those after the flood; of
Sodom and Gomorrah. v. 6.
2. Upon others; and those, 1. The godly that live amongst them; by tormenting,
1. Their eyes with the fight of their beastly actions, as was Lots. v. 7, 8. 2.
Their ears with hearing their unseemly talk. ibid.
2. The weaker sort of Christians; 1. By drawing them from the true Religion,
wherein they were not firmly settled. v. 14. 2. By bringing upon them greater
judgments for their relapsing, backsliding, and turning to their former wicked
courses, like dogs to their vomits, and sowes to the mire. v. 20, 21, 22.

3. Upon the Church; which is scorn, contempt, and reproach which will be cast
upon it, by the enemies thereof, for having heretics amongst the members of
it. v. 2.



CHAP. III.
Three Uses; 1. Of Caution; to beware that they be not deceived by those false
Prophets, that denied the day of judgment. v. 3.4.17. 2. Of Direction, how to
avoid them; which is, 1. A constant meditation of the Holy Scriptures, which
they had, 1. Read in the Prophets. 2. Heard from the Apostles. v. 2.
2. A Consideration of 1. The simplicity of their opinions, in thinking, 1.
That all things are the same from the beginning of the World; which is false,
because the world was destroyed with water. v. 4, 5, 6. 2. That all things will
be the same; when as God, 1. Has created all things of nothing, and can reduce
them to nothing again. And 2. Will destroy all things; so that there shall be
new Heavens, and a new Earth, if not, 1. According to their natural substance:
Yet 2. According to their corrupt qualities. v. 7.


2. The sinfulness of their lives, in making a trade of sinning, by walking
after their lustss v. 3.

3. Of Exhortation; 1. Not to be impatient, in thinking the day of judgment to
be long in coming, to put an end to the miseries of this life; 1. Because that
that time which seems long to us, is but short in respect of God, in that a
thousand years with us, is with him but one day. v. 8. 2. Because that the
delay of the day of judgment, is not 1. Because he will not punish the wicked:
But 2. Because he will favor the Elect; that the longer it is deferred, the
longer time they may have to repent. v. 9.

2. Not to be carnally secure; but 1. To stand upon our watch and guard, in
respect, 1. Of the certainty of the coming of Christ to judgment. v. 10. 2. Of
the uncertainty of the time of his coming. ibid.
2. To endeavor, 1. To cast off the corruption and filth of our sins; for if
the whole world must be purged of its corruption at the last day, much more
must we be purged of ours. v. 11. 2. To put on the purity of holiness. v. 14.
3. To make daily increase in all manner of goodness. v. last.





The Analysis of the 1. Epistle General of Saint JOHN.
CHAP. I.
Of Christ.

1. His being before time, from the beginning, as God. v. 1. 2. His being in
time, as Man, by his manifestation in the flesh; Concerning which we may
observe, 1. The certainty of it; as being, 1. Seen and heard. v. 1. 2. Often
seen and heard. v. 3. by men who were, 1. No liars: But 2. Of sufficient
credit and repute, even the Apostles themselves. ibid.

2. The publication of it to others; as being a thing necessary to be known.
v. 3.5. 3. The benefit by it; 1. Communion and fellowship; Not only, 1. With
godly men. v. 3. But 2. With God himself; and his Son Christ Jesus. ibid.
2. Joy; whereof, 1. The quality; which is a sense and apprehension, 1. Of Gods
great goodness in sending his Son to take our vile nature. 2. Of the great
comfort (in all afflictions) by it. 3. Of peace of conscience.
2. The quantity and extent of it; which is fullness of joy. v. 4.


3. Forgiveness of sins. 1. The necessity of it; because all men are
sinners: for he that out of pride does say, that he has no need of pardon, is
1. A liar himself. v. 8. 2. Does give the lie to God, who has said that all
are sinners. v. 10.
2. The way to obtain it; which is, true, hearty, sincere and speedy
confession. v. 9. 3. The certainty of obtaining it, if we use such confession.
1. Because God has promised it. 2. Because he will be as good as his word; he
will be faithful to perform his promises. ibid.

4. The partakers of that great benefit, viz. communion with God, joy and
forgiveness of sins; which are, 1- Not the unregenerate and habitual
sinners, who live in darkness. v. 6. 1. Of ignorance. 2. Of sin. But
2. The regenerate, and such as live a new life, who walk according to the
light which is given them; 1. Of knowledge. 2. Of grace; for there is no
justification, (i.) pardon of sins, without sanctification, (i.) holiness of
life. v. 7.


CHAP. II.
1. Of Gods dealing with us; concerning which he tells us (to prevent mistakes)
that he does not write to them of Gods great mercy; 1. To encourage wilful
sinners, v. 1. for such shall have no benefit of his mercies. v. ibid. But 2.
To comfort such as sin out of weakness and infirmity; for whom Christ is,
1. A Mediator, and a pleader in their behalf. ibid. 2. A powerful Mediator.
1. Because he is the Judge his Son. 2. Because he is righteous. ibid.


2. Of our dealing with God; where he shows the sign and mark to know a
true faith by: which is not; 1. A bare verbal profession to keep his
Commandments: But 2. A real practice of them; v. 3. for they that boast of
knowing him by faith, and break his Commandments, are, 1. Hypocrites. 2.
Deceivers of the people. v. 4.
Who do not 1. Abide in Christ. 2. Are not, 1. United to him by faith: Because
2. They are not like unto him in holiness. v. 5, 6.


3. Of our carriage in this life; 1. Toward men in the world; who are, 1. Our
brothers which are so; either, 1. By nature; so are all men in the world
brothers in respect of Adam. 2. By profession; as being of the same Religion;
so Christians are: whom we are enjoined, Not only, 1. Not to hurt: But 2. To
help, in feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, etc. as being engaged to do
it by a Commandment; which is no upstart and new Commandment: 1. In respect of
substance; for even in the Old Testament, under the Law, they were commanded to
love their Brothers: But 2. In respect of the manner of propounding it, and
renewing it in the New Testament. v. 7.


2. Who are seducers and false teachers. 1. Whom he describes, in showing 1.
What they were, (i.) men who were of the Church merely in show and outward
appearance. v. 19. 2. What they are; such as denied the Godhead of Christ, and
Redemption by him. v. 22.
2. Against whom he encourages those he writes to, as being well armed and
fortified against them by the gifts of the Holy Spirit (which he compares to
an unction, v. 20.) as sound knowledge of all things: Not 1. Absolutely: But 2.
Necessary, to keep them from being seduced; so that he did not give them this
Caution against seducers: 1. To instruct them in what they did not know: But 2.
To confirm them in what they did know. v. 21. And 3. To exhort to persevere in
doing so; and to stick close to the Christian Religion they had received. v.
28.
Because thereby, 1. They would rejoice at the day of judgment, whilst others
do tremble, v. ibid. 2. They would show themselves to be no bastards, but true
Sons of God, renewed after his image in holiness. v. last.



2. Toward the things of the World; which are, 1. Pleasures of the flesh. v.
16. 2. Profits. 3. Power and honor; all which he 1. Allows them, 1. To
possess. 2. To enjoy.
2. Forbids them to be enamoured with men, or to put confidence in them, v.
15. because they are 1. Of the world, and not of God. 2. Of a short
continuance. v. 17.




CHAP. III.
1. Gods love to us; 1. In giving us the title and privilege of being his
sons; Not, 1. By nature; for so only Christ is: But 2. By adoption. v. 1.
2. In giving us a hope, by this adoption, of a glorious appearance, and the
enjoyment of the beatificall sight and vision of him, and of his being. v. 2.
1. Like to him in glory there; If 2. We be like to him in holiness here, v. 3.
in not committing sin wilfully, and thinking it to be a light matter; which
is, 1. The breach of the Law. v. 4. 2. The work not of God, but of the Devil,
v. 8. which Christ came to destroy, by taking away, 1. The guilt of it by his
blood. 2. The polution of it, by his Spirit ibid.



2. The worlds hatred of us; whereof, 1. The cause; which is, 1. The ignorance
of God and godliness. v. 1. 2. The innocence and righteousness of the godly;
for Abel was hated of Cain for his righteousness. v. 12.
2. The antiquity of it, (which should make us think it no strange thing) in
being a thing practiced from the beginning of the world; as appears by the
murder of Cain. ibid.
3. The difference betwixt the godly and ungodly in this life, (whereby may
easily be seen the signs and marks of regeneration and unregeneration) for
the sins of the godly are not, 1. Sins of wilfulness, committed 1. Out of
malice. 2. Out of custom. 3. Out of delight; for such are the sins of the
ungodly. Because, 1. The godly are in Christ. (i.) are united to him by faith.
v. 6. 2. Are regenerate, and borne of God. v. 9. 3. Have the seeds of
spiritual graces in them, to restrain them from such sins. ibid. But

ignorance. 2. By being suddenly surprised with temptations. 3. Contrary to
their own purposes and endeavors.

4. Of Brotherly love, and in it, 1. The kinds of it; which are, 1. Loving
words, which are good. 2. Loving deeds, which are better. 3. Loving thoughts in
the heart, which are the best of all, v. 18. if this kind of love be wanting,
the other two will be to no purpose. And if 1. We be judged of hypocrisy, and
want of charity by the heart. v. 20. We cannot 2. Escape the judgment of God,
who knows the secrets of our hearts. ibid.

2. The benefit of it. 1. To others, in supplying their wants, especially those
of our own profession. v. 17. 2. To our selves; which is an assurance of our
regeneration, which is a passing from the death of sin to the life of
righteousness. v. 14. 2. Of our being no Hypocrites. v. 19.

5. Of Gods Commandments. 1. Their sum, comprehended in two words; 1. Faith
in Christ Jesus. v. 23. 2. Love of our brethren. v. 23.
2. Their reward for keeping them. 1. The grant of all our prayers. v. 22. 2.
An interest in Christ, who (if we keep his Commandments) will 1. Dwell in us.
v. 24. 2. Discover to us, that he does dwell in us, by the testimony of the
Spirit. ibid.



CHAP. IV.
1. Concerning faith in matters of Religion; wherein he exhorts them, 1. Not to
be too rash in believing every doctrine they hear. v. 1. But 2. To examine
every thing; Not 1. By the rule of their own fancies and humors: But 2. By
the touchstone of Gods holy Word. v. ibid.

2. He shows, 1. What doctrines 1. Are true, and to be adhered to, viz. the
doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus. v. 2. 2. Are false and heretical; which
are such as denied the Divinity and Incarnation of Christ. v. 3.
2. The natures and conditions of the venters of such doctrines: They are such,
1. As have not the spirit of inspiration and revelation which they beast so
much of. v. ibid. 2. As are worldly minded. v. 5. 3. As are fleshly minded; And
1. Preach sensual things, pleasing to flesh and blood, as licentiousness of
life. v. ibid. 2. Have sensual Auditors. v. ibid.

3. He does comfort them against such Heretics, by telling them that they are
such as have overcome the subtilties of them; Not 1. By their own strength and
power: But 2. By the wisdom of God; whereby they are enabled to discover the
falsehood of such Heretics. And 3. By his power; whereby they become
Conquerours. v. 4.

2. Concerning 1. Gods love to us; wherein observe, 1. The extent and
greatness of it; 1. In loving us first. v. 19. 2. In expressing this love; Not
only, 1. In giving us the creatures for our use and service, and preservation
and good of our bodies: But 2. In giving up his dear and only Son for the
salvation of our souls. v. 9.

2. Our love to our neighbors; 1. Because God loves us. v. 11. 2. Because we
cannot love him again, unless we love our brethren. v. 20.



CHAP. V.
1. Of Faith. 1. Its fruits; which are, 1. Regeneration and newness of life;
whereby the Regenerate, 1. Bear Gods image. v. 1. 2. Have a freedom, 1. From
wilful sinning, and making a trade of sin. v. 18. 2. From being, if not 1.
Assaulted: Yet 2. Overcome by Satan's temptations. v. ibid.

3. Obtain victory over the world, v. 4. when it does either 1. Flatter with
prosperity; Or, 2. Threaten with persecution.

2. A strong confidence of obtaining the grant of those prayers which we shall
offer up to God at any time. v. 14. 1. For our selves, if they be not made 1.
According to our own vain and wicked desires: But 2. According to Gods blessed
will, which should be the rule of all our prayers. v. 15.
2. For others, when we pray for the pardon of their sins; so as they be not
such sinners as do not 1. Sin against the Holy Ghost. v. 16. 1. For which
God will give no repentance. 2. To which, for want of repentance, he will give
no pardon: But
2. Only commit such sins whereof 1. They may; 2. They do repent. v. 16.


2. Of the object of faith. 1. Jesus Christ. 2. The promises of God concerning
him. 3. The fulfilling the types of the Ceremonial Law in him; As, 1. The
types of sacrifices by blood, in his freeing us from the guilt of sin by his
death. 2. The types of washing, in his freeing us from the polution of sin by
the Spirit.
4. The certainty of Christ's being on earth to be our Savior, because we have
proof and evidence for it, and that of three Witnesses; which is, Not 1. Of
men, though that were sufficient by the Law of Moses: But 2. Of the Holy
Trinity. v. 7. 1. Of God, by a voice from Heaven. 1. At his Baptism. 2. At his
Transfiguration.
2. Of Christ himself: 1. By his doctrine. 2. By his miracles.
3. Of the Spirit, persuading the truth of it: 1. In the Word of God. 2. In the
consciences of men.



3. Of Brotherly love; the cause whereof is, 1. The love of God, whose image
they bear. v. 1. 2. Love of his Commandments; which do, 1. Enjoyne us to love
others. v. 2, 3. 2. Are easy to be performed; because by the Spirit we have
both 1. Will. 2. Power to keep them. v. 3.


4. Of our service to God, who has been so loving to us, in giving us his
Son to save our souls; which must be, 1. Religious, 1. In Spirit. 2. In
Truth. And not
2. Superstitious, in carved images, under the fair pretenses of representing
him, who is a God of a Spiritual Essence. v. 21.



The Analysis of the 2. Epistle general of Saint JOHN.
CHAP. I.
This Epistle was writ to a Lady; wherein, 1. The Commendation of her: 1.
Generally; in being called a Lady Elect: either, 1. Because others did probably
think her so for her many virtues, as charity, hospitality, etc. Or 2. Because
the Apostle did certainly foresee her to be in the state of salvation, by the
inspiration of the Spirit. v. 1.
2. Particularly; for the good education, and bringing up of her Children in
the true Religion, v. 4. whereby she preserved them from those heresies which
many others were fallen into.
2. The love and affection which was borne to her, both from himself and
others, v. 7. and herein we may observe, 1. The grounds of it; which was not 1.
Her beauty, honor, and riches: But 2. Her Religion; for she was loved for the
truths sake. v. 2.
2. The fruits and effects of the love which the Apostle bore to her; which
were, 1. Joy for her Childrens good proficiency, and increase in Religion. v.
4. 2. An Exhortation to her to join love with her faith; wherein he tells
her, that his doctrine of Christian love is 1. No new upstart doctrine of his
own invention. v. 5. But 2. Such as was taught by the Apostles themselves from
the beginning of the preaching of the Gospel. ibid.

3. A Caution to her, to take heed 1. Of the dangerous doctrine of Heretics,
who denied 1. The Incarnation of Christ. 2. The Redemption by Christ. v. 7.
2. Of the dangerous company of Heretics. v. 10. 1. Because they were
deceivers, cheats and coseners, able to deceive well grounded Christians, if
they did not look to themselves. v. 7. 2. Because if they did not persevere in
that course they had begun, but should unhappily be misled by Heretics, there
would be a loss 1. Of all his pains taken with them. 2. Of all that ever they
had done, and suffered for Christ. 3. Of that reward which God will give to
perseverers. v. 8.
3. Because by being familiar with them, they would sin, 1. By encouraging
them in their sins. 2. By giving scandal to others. v. 11.



3. An Apology and excuse for the shortness of his Epistle. v. 12.


The Analysis of the 3. Epistle General of Saint JOHN.
1. He expresses, 1. His affection to Gaius the Host at Corinth; which was
not, 1. Fained and complementall: But 2. Real and true; as appears by his
hearty praver for the health of his body, answerable to the health of his
soul, v. 2. Which consisted, 1. In a joyful communion with God. 2. In a
cheerful peace of conscience.


2. His commendation of him for his great hospitality; whereof, 1. The ground,
and cause of it; which was, Not 1. Vainglory; But 2. A lively faith; in that
whatsoever he did in this kind, he did it faithfully. v. 5.

2. The extent of it; which was, Not only 1. To the brethren of his own
profession, as Christians, who were persecuted for the Gospel. v. 7. But 2.
Even to strangers, as men. v. 5.
2. He encourages him to continue in his hospitality, by telling him, 1. The
thankfulness of those that were relieved by it; which they expressed, by
making a public report of it before the Church. v. 6. 2. The acceptablenesse
of it God, as being done after a godly sort. ibid. 3. The general duty of all
Christians, to relieve those that are in distress. v. 8. 4. The hospitality of
Demetrius, as a fit example for him to follow, v. 11. who has 1. A good
report, both 1. Of others. v. 12. 2. Of himself. v. 12.
2. A true report; as being of the truth it self. ibid.

3. Shows his disaffection to Diotrephes, a Minister at Corinth; wherein, 1.
The cause of it; which was his want of charity to the distressed brethren, v.
10. and of this uncharitableness in Diotrephes, observe, 1. The cause of it;
which was, ambition, v. 9. he would not have the brethren respected, least
their respect should lessen his respect amongst them. 2. The aggravation and
heinousness; in that he was not only 1. Uncharitable himself: But 2. Hindered
the charity of others. v. 10.

2. His intention to exercise his authority, in calling him publicly to
question for it. ibid.
4. He concludes his Epistle, with an Apology (as in the former) for the
shortness of it. v. 13, 14.
The Analysis of the Epistle general of Saint JUDE.
1. The Parties to whom the Epistle is writ; which are, Not 1. Particular men,
or Churches, as those to whom the other Apostles writ: But 2. All men
whatsoever, that are 1. Inwardly sanctified by the Spirit. v. 1. 2. Outwardly
called by the practice of the Word. ibid.

2. His care of their salvation; 1. In writing to them of a weighty matter,
concerning the salvation of their souls. 1. To discharge his duty; For (says
he) it is needful for me to do so. v. 3. 2. To forewarne them to be constant,
and to keep close to the faith: Which is not here meant, 1. A justifying
faith: But 2. The doctrine of the Gospel, which is the object of it. v. 3.


2. In not neglecting the fit season and opportunity of writing, when
Heretics began to stir themselves: whom (that they may the better avoid) he
does 1. Show the wickedness and abomination, 1. Of their Tenants and
Doctrines; which was, 1. The denying of the Godhead of Christ. 2. A preaching
of licentiousness of life, under the pretense of Christian liberty. v. 4.

2. Of their lives. 1. In general; as being men, 1. Who were not loved by God:
But 2. Let to their own ways, and permitted by his divine providence to fall
into those damnable opinions. v. ibid.
2. In particular; 1. By comparing their sins with the sins of old; as, 1.
Their murmuring against Governors, with that of the Israelites, v. 6. and more
particularly, with that of Corah, v. 11. the aggravation whereof appears, in
that 1. They used their Governors worse then Michael the Archangell did the
Devil; for Michael did not rail against Satan. v. 9. Though 1. He was greater
then they, and had authority to do it. 2. Satan was worse then the worst of
Governors.
2. They railed against them out of ignorance. v. 10.
2. Their contempt, not only of Governors, but of Government it self, with
that of the Angels that fell. v. 6. 3. Their uncleanness and bestiality, with
that of Sodom and Gomorrah. v. 7. 4. Their covetousness, in venting their
heresies merely for gain, with that of Balaam, v. 11. and respecting and
admiring men more 1. For their outside riches and greatness, to advance their
fortunes. v. 16. Then 2. For their inside holiness.


2. By showing, 1. The hypocrisy of their carriage, in making a show of more
learning and piety then they had; in being men 1. Of fair pretenses and
promises. 2. Of no performance; and for this reason they are compared unto 1.
The clouds, that promise rain, but yield none. v. 12. 2. To wels without
water, and trees without fruit. ibid.

2. Their gluttony and drunkenesse, without fear. 1. Of offending God by it.
2. Of being ashamed amongst men for it. ibid.
3. Their frothy and rotten discourse which they belch out, as the Sea does
mire and dirt. v. 13. 4. Their fickleness and inconstancy, running from one
opinion unto another, like Planets, that observe no regular motion. ibid.


2. To dissuade them the more to forsake Heretics, he further shows 1. The
disgrace of being in their company, and having any familiarity with them, as
being blemishes to their company, especially in their feasts, as spots from fat
and liquor are to garments. v. 12. 2. Their punishment; 1. From the example of
Gods justice upon the like sinners; as the Israelites, the Angels, those of
Sodom and Gomorrah, etc. 2. From the certainty of Gods judgment upon them at
the day of judgment; the certainty of which day appears by the prophecy of old
by Enoch, who foretells 1. The coming of Christ to judgment. v. 14. 2. The pomp
and state of his coming, ( i.) with Angels waiting upon him. ibid. 3. The
dreadful sentence that will be passed by him, 1. Upon ungodly deeds. v 15. 2.
Upon bitter and railing speeches; 1. Against Magistrates. 2. Against the
mysteries of Religion. ibid.





Lastly; He concludes with praising God, 1. For his power; which can 1. Keep
them from backsliding and Apostasy. v. 24. 2. Present them at the day of
judgment: 1. Without fault. v. ibid. And 2. Without fear, because without
fault; so that his presence which will be 1. Dreadful to great sinners. Will
be 2. Joyful to them. v. ibib.


2. For his wisdom, v. 25. which is 1. Excellent; above all humane wisdom,
confounding the wisdom of the wisest. 2. Perpetual; showing it self at all
times, when as the wisest man upon earth is not wise always.
3. For his goodness; in using 1. His power for our good; in that he is our
Savior. ibid. 2. His wisdom for our good; in that he is our Savior. ibid.
