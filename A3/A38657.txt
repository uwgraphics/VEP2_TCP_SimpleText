putting to death of Soldiers come out of Ireland taken Prisoners.

WITH His Highness Answer thereunto.

BRISTOLL, Printed by ROBERT BARKER, and JOHN BILL, Printers to the Kings most
Excellent Majesty: MDC.XLV.

A Letter from the Earl of Essex, to his Highness Prince Rupert.
SIR,
THe two Houses of Parliament have received Information, That because the
Committee at Shrewsbury caused thirteen Irish Rebels taken in Hostility against
the Parliament to suffer death, according to an Ordinance of Parliament
herewith sent; therefore by your express Commands thirteen English
Protestants, who had Quarter given them by your Officers that took them
Prisoners, were notwithstanding murdered upon cool blood; and that you have
resolved to proceed in the same manner for the future; A Relation and
Resolution so strange, that the truth thereof might justly be suspected, were
it not certified by Letters from that Committee of the 24. of March last, to
the Speaker of the House of Commons, and by a letter of the 23. of March sent
to the same Committee by your direction, and subscribed by one Ralph Goodwin
your Secretary (as I am informed) which does own and avow the fact. And
therefore the two Houses of Parliament being deeply affected with such cruel
Massacres committed upon their Protestant Brethren, whose lives they value as
their own, have commanded me to acquaint your Highness, That it is evident by
undoubted proof, that the Rebels of Ireland (what ever they pretended to some
on this side the Sea) did really intend by that odious Rebellion, to wrest that
Kingdom, for ever, from the Crown of England, to the utter deshereson of the
King, and His Posterity, and to extirpate the English Nation, and Protestant
Religion. And for that purpose have solicited, by their Agents, the bringing
over of powerful Aids from Foreign parts, to assist them in this their
intended Conquest; and have set up the Spanish Colors publicly, both at
Wexford and Galloway; have caused their Captains, Officers, and others, to make
Oath before their titular Clergy, That they shall not suffer any English, or
Protestant to live in that Kingdom, That they prosecuted this horrid design by
murdering, hanging, drowning, burning alive, and sterving, within few Months
in one Province, one hundred fifty four thousand of harmless British
Protestants, Men, Women, and Children, without distinction of Age, or Sex,
without any provocation given, but living securely by them, in a full and
settled Peace. That the King first by Proclamation attested by His own Royal
Signiture and privy Signet, has proclaimed them Traitors, and Rebels; and
since that time, both King and Parliament, by four several Acts of Parliament,
have declared and styled them in the same manner. And further, His Majesty, by
Act of Parliament, has consented, That all Pardons granted to them, or any of
them before attainder, shall be void. Now that such bloody barbarous
Miscreants, so odious both to God and Men, so obnoxious to Law and Justice
(even by the judgment of both sides) coming out of Ireland (where they neither
did give nor receive Quarter) to burn and lay waste this Kingdom, as they have
done that, should after all this be admitted to receive Quarter here, and
consequently be made equal in Exchange with the English Nation, and
Protestants: The Lords and Commons of the Parliament of England, cannot with
Religion, Honor, or Justice, in any sort consent unto it: And have commanded
me to let your Highness, and all other Commanders on that side know, That if
hereafter, upon executing the Irish Rebels, in pursuance of that just
Ordinance, any unjust pretext shall be made, to murder, in cool blood, any
Officer, Soldier, or Seaman in the service of the Parliament, That the two
Houses have resolved, and do hereby declare, That for every Officer, Soldier,
or Seaman so causelessly massacred, they shall, and must (though with deep
sorrow and reluctance) cause so many of the Prisoners remaining in their power
to be put to death in the same manner. And therefore do earnestly desire your
Highness, and all other your inferior Commanders, to forbear by such
prodigious Cruelty, to embase the value of the English Nation, which they are
confident will be recented with indignation, even by those English Protestants,
who are for the present deceived into Arms against the Protestant Religion, and
the Parliament of England: To whom they shall be ready to allow Quarter, and
equal exchange as before, and for whom they daily pray, That Almighty God
would open their eyes, and reduce them into the right way. Sir, this being all
I have in command, I take my leave, and remain

Your humble Servant ESSEX.
Westminster the 4. of April 1645.
Die Jovis 24. October. 1644.
THe Lords and Commons assembled in the Parliament of England, do declare, That
no Quarter shall be given hereafter, to any Irishman, nor to any Papists
whatsoever born in Ireland, which shall be taken in hostility against the
Parliament, either upon the Sea, or within this Kingdom, or Dominion of Wales;
And therefore do Order and Ordain, That the Lord General, Lord Admiral, and
all other Officers and Commanders, both by Sea and Land, shall except all
Irish-men, and all Papists born in Ireland out of all Capitulations,
Agreements, and Compositions hereafter to be made with the Enemy: And shall
upon the taking of every such Irishman, or Papist born in Ireland, as
aforesaid, forthwith put every such person to Death. And it is further Ordered
and Ordained, That the Lord General, Lord Admiral, and the Committees of the
several Counties do give speedy notice hereof to all subordinate Officers and
Commanders by Sea, and Land respectively, who are hereby required to use their
utmost care and circumspection, that this Ordinance be duly executed. And
lastly, the Lords and Commons do declare, That every Officer and Commander by
Sea or Land that shall be remiss, or negligent in observing the tenor of this
Ordinance, shall be reputed a favourer of that bloody Rebellion of Ireland, and
shall be liable to such condign punishment, as the Justice of both Houses of
Parliament shall inflict upon him.

His Highness Prince Rupert's Answer to the aforesaid LETTER.
My Lord,
I Received your Lordships Letter of the 4. of this Month on the 11. and
cannot but wonder, that it should seem strange to the two Houses, that I should
cause those Prisoners which were taken in Arms against His Majesty to be used
in the same manner, and by the same measure, as His Majesty's good Subjects
taken Prisoners in the Act of their duty, are used by those that take them.
Those Soldiers of mine, which were barbarously murdered, in cold blood, after
Quarter given to them, at Shrewsbury, were those who during the time they were
in Ireland served His Majesty stoutly, constantly, and faithfully against the
Rebels of that Kingdom, and after the Cessation there, were by His Majesty's
Command transported to serve him in this, where they honestly performed the
duty of Soldiers; and therefore I were unworthy of the Command I hold under
His Majesty if upon so high a provocation, and so unheard of an Act of
injustice, as the putting those poor honest men to death, I had not let the
Authors of that Massacre know, that their own men must pay the price of such
Acts of Inhumanity, and be used as they use their Brethren: And therefore I
caused the like number (to whom Quarter was no otherwise given then to the
former) to be put to death in the same manner as had been done at Shrewsbury.
How the Rebellion in Ireland began, and with what circumstances of blood and
cruelty it has been carried on, (the odiousness whereof, and of all other
Rebellions is apparent, and all good men must abhor) is not applicable to
this Argument; (I wish the temper of this Kingdom had been, or yet were such as
might be applied to the composure of that) Your Lordship has in that Army many
Soldiers, who served His Majesty in that Kingdom of Ireland, yet to those
Soldiers when taken Prisoners, Quarter is given, and observed on this side,
the like must be expected from you; And if it should be otherwise, and that
Quarter should be denied to all those who have been Proclaimed Traitors and
Rebels, or who by Act of Parliament are such, this War will be much more
merciless and bloody then it has been, or then any good man, or true
Englishman can desire to see it: I am sure such rigor shall be prevented by
all the interest and power I have. Neither can that threat and menace in your
Lordships Letter, of the resolution to use such Prisoners as shall be taken of
His Majesty's Army for the future, make any other impression in me, then of
grief and sadness of heart to see such Injustice and Inhumanity, a proceeding
contrary to the Laws of Nature and Nations, contrary to the Rules and Customs
of War in any part of the Christian World, so deliberately and solemnly
resolved, declared, and published. If there should be an Ordinanc^ made that
there should be no Quarter given to any Soldiers under my Command, and an
expectation that those under yours should receive Quarter, would your Lordship
expect that I submit to such an Ordinance, This is the case. I have taken
Prisoners of those who have taken Arms against His Majesty of all Nations,
English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Walloons, of all Religions and Oppinions
that are avowed by Christians, and have always allowed them Quarter, and equal
Exchange, (how unequal soever the quarrel and contention is, and what
judgment soever the Law has determined upon such Persons) and shall do so
still, hoping that Almighty God will open the eyes of those who have been
strangely deceived into Arms against, and to the scandal and destruction of
the Protestant Religion, (in which all men know I have bin born, and for which
they have reason enough to believe I will dye) and the Parliament of England,
assembled by His Majesty's Command, and of which His Majesty is the head, and
will recover and reduce those, who out of ambition or malice have made those
paths, in which the other have trod, to their Piety toward their Maker, and
their Allegiance toward their Sovereign: But if the contrary course shall be
held, and any Prisoners under my Command shall be taken, executed, and
murdered in cold blood, under what senseless and unjust pretense soever, for
every Officer and Soldier so causelessly and barbarously murdered, I will
cause so many of the Prisoners remaining in my Power to be put to death in the
same manner, and I doubt not but the blood of those miserable men, who shall so
suffer by my Order, as well as of those who shall be butchered by that
Ordinance your Lordship mentions, shall be required at their hands, who by
their cruel examples impose a necessity upon other men to observe the Rules
they lay down. And I cannot but express a great sense to your Lordship, that
since His Majesty's gracious offers and importunity for Peace will not be
hearkened unto, by these prodigious resolutions expressed in your Lordships
Letter, the War is like to be so managed, that the English Nation is in
danger of destroying one another, or (which is a kind of extirpation) of
degenerating into such an animosity and cruelty, that all eliments of Charity,
Compassion, and Brotherly Affection shall be extinguished. I hope they whose
opinions and resolutions your Lordship has imparted to me, will take these
animadversions into serious consideration from

MY LORD Your humble Servant RUPERT.

FINIS.
