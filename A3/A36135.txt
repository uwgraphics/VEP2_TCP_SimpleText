adays the common practice amongst these audacious, unprofitable bablers and
seducers, who have made all the world to hang after them, seduced the same, or

outwardly painting, dawbing over, or covering such of them as delight to hear
their hypocrisy and lying giving about too contrary to the doctrine of Christ
and his Disciples, the true Apostles and Prophets, to make them outwardly fair
and godly through themselves, or holy out of their own power; But in vain,
says Christ, do ye teach such doctrines as are nothing but the Commandments
of men; that say, thou shall not touch, taste, handle this: things that perish
all under the hands that have a show of wisdom, through self invented
spirituality and humility, ever teaching, and never able to attain to the
knowledge of truth; urging men by their unprofitable and perverse doctrines
from without; troubling them with grievous institutions, dragging or loading
them with great burdens, or intolerable Yoaks, because of their false works

must stand behind now, and have no interest nor esteem more in the world,
just, as if for the accomplishment, or performing much things, men were
sufficient of themselves, or it depended merely of their bodily exercises or
abilities, and were not according to Gods preventing Grace to be directed, from
that same ground, wherein the true Believers are rooted in the Communion of
God, who therefore ought to be united together through the Bond of Peace, and
the love of God in the Spirit, for to be established through Faith in the Grace
of God, and in the freedom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, his Members
being already grafted into him, and thus planted or transplanted in the
Celestial Being, after they were once delivered from the Power of Darkness,
redeemed through the Blood of the Son of God, and dearly purchased for his
Everlasting Kingdom.

For with God there avails no deceived or inured practice of self-bred
holiness, or Jewish righteousness, as not merely the outward putting away of
the filth in the flesh, like unto the painted or glistering wicked Jezabel; but
the Covenant of a good conscience with God, and that through the power of the

Principalities and Dominions, for which cause the Angels, the Mighty Ones, and
the Powers in Heaven and Earth ought to be subject, submissive, and obedient
unto him, Heb. 5.12. but yet by no means in any slight or ^uperficial manner,
only from without, according to the nature and practice of hypocrites and
dissemblers, which make themselves acceptable according to the flesh, and
neglect withal the weightiest matters in the Law, namely, the Judgment, the
Mercy, and the Faith, by Mat. 23. Jer. 23. 2 These. 2. Revel. 20. Cor. 2.10.

reason of which hypocrisy, all things are now through the power and operation
of Satan, turned loose in the world, so that there is none more that desires
to endure the persecutions of the Cross of Christ, under the obedience of
Faith, or that so hoped for the salvation of the Lord, or waited for the help
out of Sion, under the yoke of the Sea of God, in contemning the world, and

Sepulchers) the same shall be cast into face of the Priests, for their dreams
avail nothing at all, but the Word of God does; and that which does not proceed
of Faith, or consists in the power of Divine Working, or Efficacy (according
as the Holy Ghost will have his own peculiar people to be governed) that same
is sin; therefore says Christ, All the plants which mine heavenly Father has
not planted, are cut off, and whatsoever brings not forth fruit, out of
Christ, the same is cast into the fire: Whence it is that the holy Apostle Paul
does not at all allow of, or require the bare, outward, self-performed works,
by carnal power and ability, lest any should glory in of the same, exalt
himself therein, as those in the first Testament, when they had not the
knowledge of Christ yet, but in a new substantial way of the spirit, Romans 7. in
holiness and righteousness, which is acceptable to God, yiedling the fruit of
the incorruptible seed, and that according to the power of the living Word of
God, which endures for ever; wherefore the true Believers, according to, and
for the inward grounds of their hearts, are to be built and bottomed, or
grounded fast, that so conformably to the Gospel of Christ, they may be
cemented, and junctary be supported together, for the improvement of the common
body; for when the people of the Jews, who yet were the true natural branch,
did not adhere to their Testament in this manner, and brought not accordingly
fruits worthy of the Kingdom of God, the same was taken from them, yea, no
more regarded, and quite cast or cut off from the root, Romans 11.

Let none at all therefore imagine, or be conceited, as if his false Prophets
now had false Power and Commission yet from God, or part of his everlasting
Kingdom, for those dreams which are merely carnal, and have no spirit at all,
namely, those light-swelling proud Saints, on whom the world relieth. Now for
their Salvation, and by whom the people, ever according to their own wills and
pleasures, are so far seduced, and led away from God, that none does care or
desire any more, in the inward ground of the heart or conscience, to square his
actions to the Counsel of the Lord, or the Will of God, arrogating besides unto
themselves, according to their audaciousness, to Lord and Master it over heaven
it self, by their false or pick-key-office, according to, or by which, the
Devil through them absolveth now from, or forgiveth sins, to the utter ruin of
all mankind: 1 Pet. 2.5 Jer. 23. Mat. 7.21. Esa. 28. John 10. Rev. 16.20 Ezekiel.

Jude.

The wisdom of the Wise, and the understanding of the understanding ones,
which the Scribes and worldly learned have of God and his Word, is already
discharged, defeated, and rejected by God, although they have not the Word of
the Lord, but repeated the same aforehand, according to the spiritual
knowledge of it, Jerem: 8. Hos. 4. teaching the word of God not at all in his
Power, or according to the instruction of the Spirit, but falsely and perversely,
by Humane Reasons, and Worldly Constitutions, according to the fabulousness of
their deceitful Philosophy, Col. 2. and wherewith the whole world is led away
already, by doing of evil, or dealing wrongfully, from Christ the Light of
Everlasting Salvation, or narrow way of life, according to the knowledge of
God: But what the issue or condition will be of these blinded Heathens, in

Eternal Truth and Righteousness, that those thieves and murderers shall not be
able to escape the fierceness of Gods Wrath, and the five Pools of the Eternal
Hellish condemnation, Isa. 1. 34. 36. who rob God of his Honor and Vengeance,

For the blood of the slain, Isa. 26. poor innocent souls, that have been spilt
here and there, for such a time hitherto, in the murdering dens of this false
Christendom, and the ruin of the poor, that are destroyed in all places or
countries, because of the hypocrisy of the evil, dis-united, (disagreeing)
practices of the Shepherds, all that same shall be judged yet, now before the
end of the world, as before the great and terrible day of God, Hez. 37. Mic. 4.

Now that there is none at all more, who according to the inward Law, or
testimony of faith or conscience (wherein yet every true believer ought to
stand or walk for his own salvations sake) does observe to take notice of the
day of the Lord, or but believe in regard of the deliverance of the faithful
and Elect, That there is either a God or a Judgment, that same rests wholly
and principally upon the hypocrisy and lies of the Shepherd, Jerem. 33. upon
their hypocritical show of holy ways and courses, which every one does strive
in his own Religion, Seat, or Party, to maintain and desend, without and
against God, in which regard they do yet once again outwardly garnish the same
people they have already deceived and seduced aforehand, Mat. 24. having in
regard of the light or the only true and saving faith, led them astray or away
from God, and plunged them into error or darkness of conscience, which yet
shall not so succeed or avail to the Devil for ever; namely to transform
himself still by his servants, the false Apostles or deceitful Laborers, after
such an impudent and shamless sort, into an Angel of Light, all whose endeavor
and labor is but to maintain their own things, Hez. 13. devouring the people
to feed and fat themselves, and therewithal reviling the counsel of the poor,
in regard of the deliverance of Israel, or the help out of Zion; nay, even
utterly denying herein the Almighty Power of God in Christ Jesus, the only Lord
and Monarch, Epist. Jude. Wherefore also such fierce and ravening wolves and
hirelings, who indeed serve but the world and their own bellies, will draw or
hale a sudden condemnation upon themselves.

have so far lost or forsaken the hope, confidence, and assurance in God, the
living Fountain, touching the deliverance of the poor and afflicted, the
faithful and elect, that ye never yet desired above all things to do; what the
universal, temporal, and eternal welfare of mankind do require, they shall find
it by experience, to their own eternal shame and confusion, that God both is,
and shall be Judge in that matter, here upon his earth, or under heaven, Dan. 7.

The Devil for a good while hitherto has taken away, or usurped by the
Heathens, or false Christians (who are grown Romans 1.11. Mark 13. Jam. 5. 1 Cor.

distracted Religions, cause prate and dispute, courses might be maintained,
but that hereupon only the fire of destruction and desolation was kindled all
the world over, that same shall surely be judged yet in these, according to the
Righteousness of God, that partake in the guilt and cause of it, and do as much
care for God in matter of their purposes or practices herein, as their
fellow-scorners and scoffers of old, in the days of Noah and Lot, whom God for
that very cause afterward drowned with the deluge, and destroyed with fire and
brimstone from heaven, Epist. Jude, Malach. 4.

The Lord shall judge all flesh by fire and by his sword, Isa. 66. Amos 9.

First of all, The men or people of this present and last John 5. 1 Pet. 2.

and purposes are contrary to the writings of the Apostles and Prophets, Isa. 8.

though Moses or Elias, nay Christ himself were in the world now to argue and
reprove the evil, unrighteous, wicked, false, and perverse courses of the
children of men, and should begin according to the zeal of God, to stir against
their false worship of God; and according to the true ground, seriously take to
heart and endeavor the rescuing of mankind from these present troubles and
great tribulations, assuredly it would fare far worse with them, in regard of
this present presumptuous government in the world, then ever happened in former
times among the Jews, in the house of Ahab, and by wicked Jezabel to any, 1
Kings 19. 21. Romans 11.

Gomoritans, will not endure to be reproved Romans 1.11. Genesis 19. Re. 11.19. Romans

they themselves project and make choice of among themselves, Isa. 65.66. that
must stand according to their imagination Psalm. 33. Isa. 8.30.
for ever, and prosper. But on the contrary, the eternal counsel of the Lord
most high, touching the setting up of his Kingdom, and the executing of his
Judgments, Mat. Dan. 2. 7. Rev. 18.19 Number. 16.
12. that must be no more, but remain behind or perish altogether in their
account: These people nevertheless, like Korah, Dathan, and gathering of
Abiram, have outwardly a godly show of godliness, but they deny the power 2 Timothy 3.4. Acts 20.
thereof, as also do their worldly learned and perverted men, through whose
doctrine they are possessed and blinded already, by the God of this world, viz.
by the Devil or Spirit Ephesians. 2.4.6. 2 Cor. 4. Epist. Jud. Heb. 4.
of darkness, which indeed very soon discovers it self in them when they are
rightly set upon by the power and truth of the living word of God, Mich. 3. 7.

Summarily those people which are so earnest, and counted by their outward
Temple or false worship of God, as Ier. 7. ^. Ez. 13.22.
that in the first place they do inwardly in their hearts and consciences,
resist the Grace of God, our Lord and Savior Mat. 23.24 Tit. 2. Gal. 4.5. Romans

outward troubles of the world, do not at all desire or endeavor, above all
things to conform their practice to the Council of the Lord, or Will of God,

fire in the nethermost Hell, Heb. 10. 12. Zeph. 1.3.

as having forsaken God in their hearts or consciences, according to the
Mystery of his Kingdom, do not believe that there shall be a Judgment: Yet for
a fundamental change or removal of these present troubles and tribulations in
the world: So neither and much less yet do the Shepherds or Teachers believe,

and was brought into, through their unacknowledgement of God, shall light upon
themselves and their hypocrisy, Mat. 24.

Briefly these men and people that have forgotten all the works and deeds God
did or wrought from the beginning of the world, they are conceited now as if
all the earth were properly their own, and as if their false Prophets had
already taken the full possession and disposing of Heaven, unto themselves, and
God (according to their perverse and stupid imaginations) had quite lost his
Almighty Power over Heaven and Earth: Wherefore nevertheless the Devil will be
exceedingly disappointed, as his members that will not suffer the Sovereignty
of the Spirit of Christ, or of the Grace of God, to prevail any more, neither
inwardly in their hearts, nor outwardly in the world, according to his right
Judgment or Government: They know well enough already every one according to
his own wisdom and policy how to defend themselves; like unto those Mighties
and Tyrants of old, that were ruined with all their strength, and drowned in
the deluge, when the earth was likewise overgrown with violence and
presumption, Fpist. Jude.

their hearts or consciences, they are now Gods people just in the same manner,
as were the Jews of old, who walked no more in the Law of Moses, nor lived
after the Commandments, Statutes, and Ordinances of God, for any spiritual
deliverance, and crucified and killed even Christ himself, the Son of God, for
their Temple-Cause, and for their false worships sake, by the power of
darkness, in their unacknowledgement of God.

The Shepherds of this present Babel, being divided into three parts, viz. the
three unclean Spirits, Frogs, and Spirits of the Devil, that were never known,
nor sent of God, Mat. 7. they have not the Word of God, but steal it one from
another, and have so far perverted the Word of the living God, the Lord of
Hosts, that the people that were deceived and seduced by them, do not any more
at all agree among themselves, according to the Gospel of Christ, his Disciples
and Apostles, for which cause the Judgment of God shall light on them in the
very first place, by reason of the destruction of the poor, which for such a
while hitherto has been practiced in the murdering Den of this false
Christendom, throughout all places and countries, for the maintenance and
support of the hypocrisy of their distracted Religions, Luke 19. 20. Revel.

And for as much as the Heathens, or false Christians, ought not in no wise to
maintain their outward Temple-Cause, or false worship with rage and fury,
therefore they have cause to look well unto themselves, now what they are
about, in regard of these murdering Arms, which they have taken up one against
another, only according to their own fierceness and revengefulness, as whereby
they do not only pull the Judgment out of Gods hand, but they withal kindle
but the fire so much the more, to the utter ruin and destruction of the poor.

In which regard else, or by reason whereof, these writings are addressed both
unto the Parliament, and also to the King of England, lest by their unrighteous
designs and purposes, and besides too, with the very sweat and Jam. 5. Nah. 3.

take away from them, they do make them an utter prey and spoil, even to their
own destruction; in the mean while soothing themselves, and relying upon the
hypocrisy and lies of their false Prophets, or their remissions or absolving
of sins.

For the same God, that in former times has drowned such people with the
deluge, is ready now to execute his judgment upon this present and last world,
and upon their Genesis 67. Ep. Jude. 2 Pet. 2.3 2 Timothy 4.
