Creator, when I suffer according to the Will of God.

Q. What does God's infinite Wisdom teach you?

A. God's infinite Wisdom teaches me; First, Romans 12.16. Prove. 3.5. 1 Cor.
3.19.
That I ought not to be wise in my own Conceit, nor lean to my own
Understanding, knowing that the Wisdom of this World is Foolishness with God.

Secondly, Col. 3.23. 1 Chronicles. 28.9.

Christ whom he has sent. Joh. 17.3.

and have everlasting Life.

Q. Have all Men then sinned, and by Sin deserved Death?

tA. Romans 3.23.
All have sinned and come short of the Glory of God; Romans 6.23.
And the Wages of Sin is Death.

Q. What is Sin?

A. Sin is the Transgression of the Law. 1 John 3.4.

Q. Did not God make Man upright?

A. God has made Man upright, but he has sought out many Inventions. Eccl.
7.29.

Q. Who of Mankind committed the first Sin?

A. Our first Parents, Adam and Eve.

Q. What Sin did they commit?

A. They did eat of the Tree, whereof God commanded that they should not eat.
Genesis 3.6, 11, 12.

Q. Who tempted them to this Sin?

A. The Serpent (that is, the Devil) beguiled Eve, and she did eat, and she
gave to Adam of the Tree, and he did eat. Genesis 3.13, 12.

Q. By what Temptation did the Serpent prevail with Eve?

A. The Serpent said unto the Woman, You shall not surely die: For God knows
that in the Day ye eat thereof, then your Eyes shall be opened: and ye shall be
as Gods, knowing Good and Evil. And when the Woman saw that the Tree was good
for Food, and that it was pleasant to the Eyes, and a Tree to be desired to
make one wise, she took of the Fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also to her
Husband with here, and he did eat. Genesis 3.4, 5, 6.

Q. What did follow upon Adam 's Sin?

A. By that one Man, Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin; and so Death
passed upon all Men: for that all have sinned. Romans 5.12.

Q. What did Christ when he was upon Earth to save us from Sin, and the
Punishment due to it.

A. Joh. 15.15.
Christ, first, made known to us all things that he had heard from his Father.

Secondly, 1 Pet. 2.21.
He left us an Example that we should follow his Steps.

Thirdly, Gal. 3.13.
He was made a Curse, (or, Died on the Cross for us) and Ephesians. 5.2.
gave himself for us an Offering and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
Savor.

Q. What do the Apostles of Christ declare concerning him?

A. They declare that Joh. 1.14.
he is the only begotten Son of the Father, Romans 9.5.
and God blessed for ever; Euke 1.31, 35.
that he was conceived of the Virgin Mary by the Holy Ghost; Acts 10.38.
that he went up and down doing Good; Acts 2.22.
that he was approved of God by Miracles, Wonders and Signs; Hebr. 4.15.
that he was in all Points tempted like as we are, yet without Sin; 1 Cor.
15.3, 4.
that he died for our Sins, and was buried, and rose again the third Day, Mark
16.19.
and was received up into Heaven, and sat at the Right Hand of God, Acts 1.11.
and that from thence he shall come again, Chapter 10.42.
to judge the Quick and Dead, Mat. 13.40.
at the end of the World.

Q. What does Christ, now he is in Heaven, to save us from Sin and Misery?

A. Heb. 7.25.
He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he
ever lives to make intercession for them. And 1 John 2.1.
we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.

Q. For whom of Mankind did Christ die?

A. 1 Timothy 2.6.
He gave himself a Ransom for all: 1 John 2.2.
He is the Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but also for the
Sins of the whole World: Heb. 2.9.
He tasted Death for every Man: Romans 5.18.
And as by the Offense of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation; even
so by the Righteousness of one, the free Gift came upon all Men, to
justification of Life.

Q. Is there nothing for us to do, that we may receive forgiveness of Sin, and
eternal Life through Christ?

A. God forbid I should think so: for the Scripture tells us, that Acts 3.19.
we must repent and be converted, that our Sins may be blotted out; and Joh.
3.16.
that God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting Life. Heb.
5.9.
And that he is the Author of eternal Salvation to them that obey him.

Q. Shall that Willingness to obey God's Commandments be accepted, which only
produces weak Endeavors?

A. No, but we must strive to enter in at the Strait Gate; because many will
seek, Luke 13.24.
in an idle lazy Manner, to enter in, and shall not be able.

Q. Then we must repent and believe, and obey the Gospel, or we shall receive
no benefit by the Death of Christ?

A. Luke 13.3.
Except we repent we shall all perish: Mark 16.16.
And he that believes not, shall be damned. Joh. 3.19.
And this is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men love
Darkness rather than Light, because their Deeds are evil.

Q. Is it not sufficient, if we obey some of Christ's Precepts; or is it
necessary that we obey them all?

A. Yes verily, James 2.10.
for he that keeps the whole Law, and yet offends in one Point, [or allows
himself in Disobedience to some one Law] is guilty of all. [or is liable to the
same Punishment for kind that is due to the breach of all.]

Q. Will not Faith at all profit us, except it be joined with Repentance and
Obedience to Christ's Precepts?

A. No surely, Jam. 2.17, 20.
for Faith without Works is dead, being alone: And Verse. 19.
the Devils believe and tremble.

Q. Seeing that Justification or Pardon of Sin is several times ascribed to
Faith, and Faith is said to be imputed for Righteousness, what kind of Faith do
the Scriptures mean?

A. The Scriptures mean such a Faith as Acts 15.9.
purifies the Heart, Gal. 5.6.


Q. What is that Repentance that shall obtain Mercy?

A. That Repentance that shall obtain Mercy, is Esaias 55.7.
the forsaking our wicked Ways and Thoughts, and returning to the Lord, Acts
26.20.
and doing Works meet for it.

Q. Can you by your believing, repenting, and doing good Works, deserve at
God's hands the Pardon of your Sins and eternal Life?

A. No, Luke 17.10.
but when we have done all those things that are commanded, we must say that we
are unprofitable Servants: Titus 3.5.
And not by Works of Righteousness which we have done, but according to his
Mercy he saved us, Ephesians. 1.6, 7.
and the Riches of his Grace.

Q. What is the Substance of those Duties which the Gospel of Christ requires
of you?

A. The Grace of God, that brings Salvation to all Men, has appeared,
teaching us, that denying Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World. Titus 2.11, 12.

Q. What is it to live Godly?

A. To live Godly is Ps. 100.2.
to serve the Lord with Gladness, and Heb. 12.28.
to worship him with Fear and Reverence, Prove. 3.6.
and in all our Ways acknowledge him.

Q. Is God alone to be worshipped, or may we also give Religious Worship to
Saints and Angels, as the Papists do?

A. It is written, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou
serve. Matthew. 4.10.

Q. What is it to live Soberly?

A. To live Soberly, is to abstain from these Works of the Flesh, Gal. 5.19,
20, 21.
Adultery, fornication, Uncleanness, Lasciviousness, Hatred, Wrath, Strife,
Seditions, Heresies, Envyings, Drunkenness, Revellings, and such like: and Col.
3.5.
Covetousness, (or setting our Affections upon things below) which is Idolatry.

Q. What is it to live Kighteously?

A. To live Righteously is, Whatsoever I would that Men should do unto me, to
do even so unto them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. Mat. 7.12.

Q. What is your Duty toward the King and the higher Powers?

A. My Duty toward the King and the higher Powers, is to 1 Timothy 2.2.
pray for him, and all that are put in Authority under him, 1 Pet. 2.17.
to honor Him and them, Romans 13.1.
and to be subject unto them.

Q. Why must we be subject to them?

A. We must needs be subject not only for Wrath, [or, for fear of their Sword]
but also for Conscience sake. Romans 13.5.

Q. How does Conscience toward God oblige us to be subject?

A. Because there is no Power but of God, the Powers that be are ordained of
God: whosoever therefore resists the Power, resists the Ordinance of God:
and they that resist, shall receive to themselves Damnation. Romans 13.1, 2.

Q. But must you yield active Obedience to your Governors, if they should
require of you what God has expressly forbidden?

A. Whether it be right in the Sight of God, to hearken unto Men more than unto
God, judge ye. Acts 4.19.

Q. What is your Duty toward the Bishops and Spiritual Governors and Teachers
which Christ has set over his Church.

A. My Duty is to obey them that have the Rule over me, and submit my self, for
they watch for our Souls as those that must give account. Heb. 13.17.

Q. What other Duties do you owe to them?

A. I am also to 1 Thessalonians. 5.12, 13.
esteem those that are over us in the Lord, and admonish us, very highly in
love for their Work's sake. And Gal. 6.6.
he that is taught in the Word, should communicate to him that teaches in all
good things.

Q. Is it lawful for you to publish the Faults of your Civil or Ecclesiastical
Governors?

A. It is written, Thou shall not speak evil of the Ruler of thy People. Acts
23.5.

Q. This puts me in mind to ask you, Whether that Man can be religious who
bridleth not his Tongue?

A. If any Man among you seems to be religious, and bridleth not his Tongue,
but deceives his own Heart, this Man's Religion is vain. James 1.26.

Q. What is the Duty of Children toward their Parents?

A. It Is the Duty of Children to Ephesians. 6.2.
honor their Father and Mother, which is the first Commandment with promise:
Col. 3.20.
And to obey them in all things, for this i^ well pleasing unto the Lord.

Q. What is the Duty of Parents toward their Children?

A. It Is the Duty of Parents not to provoke their Children to Wrath, but to
bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. Ephesians. 6.4.

Q. What is the Duty of Servants toward their Masters?

A. It Is the Duty of Servants to be obedient to their own Masters, and to
please them well in all things, not answering again, nor purloyning, but
showing all good Fidelity, that they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Savior
in all things. Tit. 2.9, 10.

Q. What if they have froward Masters, must they be subject to such?

A. They ought to be subject to their Masters with all Fear, not only to the
good and gentle, but also to the froward. 1 Pet. 2.18.

Q. How should Servants obey their Masters?

A. They should obey their Masters, not with Eye-Service, as Men-pleasers, but
in Singleness of Heart, fearing God. Col. 3.22.

Q. What Encouragement have Servants thus to obey their Masters?

A. Of the Lord they shall receive the Reward of the Inheritance, for they
serve (in so doing) the Lord Christ. Col. 3.24.

Q. What Encouragement have they to suffer patiently from froward Masters?

A. This is thank-worthy, if a Man for Conscience toward God endure Grief,
suffering wrongfully; and (...) when we do well and suffer for it, we take it
patiently; this is acceptable with God. 1 Pet. 2.19, 20.

Q. What is the Duty of Masters toward their Servants?

A. It Is the Duty of Masters Col. 4.1.
to give to their Servants that which is just and equal: Ephesians. 6.9.
And to forbear Threatening.

Q. Why should they do so?

A. Because they have also a Master in Heaven, neither is there respect of
Persons with God. Col. 4.1.

Q. What is the Duty of Husbands toward their Wives?

A. It Is the Duty of Husbands to love their Wives, and not be bitter against
them. Col. 3.19.

Q. How should Husbands love their Wives?

A. They should love them Ephesians. 5.25.
as Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it: and Verse. 28.
so ought Men to love their Wives as their own Bodies.

Q. Ought not Husbands to dwell with their Wives?

A. A Man ought to forsake Father and Mother, and to cleave to his Wife, and
they two shall be one Flesh. Mat. 19.5.

Q. What is the Duty of Wives toward their Husbands?

A. It Is the Duty of Wives to Ephesians. 5.33.
see that they reverence their Husbands, and Verse. 22.
submit unto them as unto the Lord.

Q. Why should they do so?

A. Because the Husband is Head of the Wife, even as Christ is Head of the
Church. Ephesians. 5.23.

Q. What if the Husband be an Infidel or wicked Man?

A. St. Peter says, Ye Wives be in subjection to your own Husbands, that if
any obey not the Word, they also may without the Word be won by the
Conversation of the Wives, while they behold your chaste Conversation coupled
with Fear. 1 Pet. 3.1.

Q. How should you behave your self toward the Aged?

A. I ought to Lev. 19.32.
rise up before the hoary Head, and to honor the Face of the old Man Prove.
16.31.
For the hoary Head is a Crown of Glory, if it be found in the Way of
Righteousness.

Q. What is your Duty toward Strangers?

A. I may not be forgetful to entertain Strangers, for thereby some have
entertained Angels unawares. Heb. 13.2. Mat. 25.35.

Q. What is your Duty toward the Poor and Needy?

A. I ought to be 1 Pet. 3.8.
pitiful toward them, and Ephesians. 4.32.
tenderhearted, Heb. 13.3.
and to remember them that are in Bonds, as bound with them, and them which
suffer Adversity, as being my self also in the Body.

Q. Is it enough to pity them, and to be sorry for their Condition?

A. By no means, Jam. 2.15, 16.
for if a Brother or Sister be naked and destitute of daily Food, and I say to
him, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled, but give them not those things
which are needful to the Body, what does it profit? Therefore Heb. 13.16.
to do good and communicate I may not forget, for with such Sacrifices God is
well pleased.

Q. Ought he to give Alms who gets his Living by the Labor of his Hands?

A. Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with
his Hands the thing that is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.
Ephesians. 4.28.

Q. For what End should you give Alms?

A. My Light should so shine before Men, that they may see my good Works, and
glorify our Father which is in Heaven. Mat. 5.16.

Q. For what End may you not give Alms?

A. I Mat. 6.1.
may not do my Alms before Men to be seen, Verse. 2.
or have Glory of them, otherwise I have no reward of my Father which is in
Heaven.

Q. What if you find you self strongly tempted to Vainglory, and to desire the
Praise of Men in giving your Alms?

A. In that case, my Left Hand should not know what my Right Hand does. [Or, I
should give very secretly.] Matthew. 6.3.

Q. With what Mind ought you to give?

A. I ought to be ready to distribute, and willing to communicate, not to give
grudgingly or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful Giver. 1 Timothy 6.18. 2
Cor. 9.7.

Q. Can a Man love god, who refuses to relieve the Needy, when he is able?

A. Who so has this World's Goods, and sees his Brother has need, and
shuts up his Bowels of Compassion from him, how dwells the Love of God in
him? 1 John 3.17.

Q. What then is pure and undefiled Religion?

A. Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, To visit
the Fatherless and Widows in their Affliction, and to keep our selves unspotted
from the World. Jam. 1.27.

Q. To whom ought you to do good?

A. As we have opportunity we must do good unto all Men, especially to them who
are of the Household of Faith. Gal. 6.10.

Q. What Encouragement have you to be merciful and charitable?

A. Mat. 5.7.
Blessed are the Merciful, for they shall obtain Mercy: And 1 Timothy 6.19.
if we are rich in good Works, we shall lay up for our selves a good Foundation
against the time to come, that we may lay hold of Eternal Life.

Q. Are there not Promises of Temporal good things also to the Merciful and
Charitable?

A. Yes: Ps. 41.1, 2, 3. etc.
Blessed is the Man that considers the Poor, the Lord will deliver him in
time of trouble; the Lord will preserve him and keep him alive, and he shall be
blessed upon the Earth: Ps. 37.26.
And his Seed is blessed.

Q. What was David 's Observation concerning the merciful Man?

A. David says, I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not seen the
Righteous [or, merciful Man] forsaken, nor his Seed begging Bread. Ps. 37.25.

Q. What was his Son Solomon 's Observation?

A. There is that scatters, and yet increases; and there is that withholdeth
more than is meet, but it tends to Poverty. Prove. 11.24.

Q. But you believe that God may in Faithfulness, for great and wise Ends,
suffer a merciful and good Man to fall into Afflictions, notwithstanding the
forementioned Promises?

A. Yes: Romans 8.28.
For we know all things work together for good unto them that love God: 2 Cor.
4.17.
And these light Afflictions which are but for a moment, work for them a far
more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory.

Q. You have well told me your Duty toward the Poor and Needy, God grant that
you practice it: Tell me next your Duty toward your Brother that has offended
you?

A. We ought to forbear one another, and forgive one another, even as God for
Christ's sake has forgiven us. Col. 3.12. Ephesians. 4.32.

Q. How often shall thy Brother sin against thee, and thou forgive him? till
seven times?

A. Yes: Until seventy times seven. Mat. 18.22.

Q. What if you do not forgive your Brother his Trespasses?

A. Neither will my heavenly Father forgive me my Trespasses. Mat. 6.15.

Q. What is your Duty toward your Brother that has offended God?

A. I must not hate my Brother in my Heart, but in any wise rebuke my
Neighbor, and not suffer Sin upon him. Lev. 19.17.

Q. What Encouragement have you so to do?

A. If any Man err from the Truth, and one convert him, let him know that he
which converteth a Sinner from the Error of his Way, shall save a Soul from
Death, and shall hide a multitude of Sins. Jam. 5.20.

Q. How should we reprove our sinning Brother?

A. If any Man be overtaken in a Fault, they that be Spiritual should restore
such a one with a Spirit of Meekness, considering themselves lest they also be
tempted. Gal. 6.1.

Q. Is it not your Duty to be as savourable as may be in judging your Brother?

A. Our Lord has said, Mat. 7.1, 2.
Judge not that ye be not judged: For with what Judgment ye judge, ye shall be
judged. And, Romans 14.4.
who art thou that judge another Man's Servant? to his own Master he stands
or falls.

Q. How ought those that are strong and knowing, to behave themselves toward
the weak and ignorant?

A. They that are strong, ought to bear the Infirmities of the Weak, and not to
please themselves. Romans 15.1.

Q. What is your Duty toward your Enemies?

A. It Is my Duty to love mine Enemies. Mat. 5.44.

Q. How should you show your Love to your Enemies?

A. By 1 Pet. 3.9.
not rendering Evil for Evil, or Railing for Railing, but contrariwise,
blessing: Romans 12.21.
And by overcoming Evil with Good.

Q. What Arguments have we to love and do good to our Enemies?

A. Romans 5.8.
God commends his Love toward us, in that while we were yet Sinners, Christ
died for us. And Mat. 5.45.
so shall we be the Children of our Father which is in Heaven: For he makes his
Sun to rise on the Evil and on the Good, and sends Rain on the Just and on
the Unjust: Luke 6.35.
And is kind to the Unthankful and to the Evil.

Q. By the Answers you have given, I perceive you are far from imagining that
the Grace of the Gospel does excuse us from good Works.

A. We are created in Christ Jesus unto good Works, which God has before
ordained that we should walk in them. Ephesians. 2.10.

Q. Is it sufficient to do good Works with our outward Man?

A. No, but if any Man be in Christ (or, a true Christian) he is a new
Creature. 2 Cor. 5.17.

Q. What is it to be a new Creature?

A. To be a new Creature, is to be Ephesians. 4.23.
renewed in the Spirit of our Mind: Romans 6.17.
and to obey from the Heart.

Q. Why is it necessary to be renewed in the Spirit of our Mind?

A. It is necessary to be renewed in the Spirit of our Mind, because Mat. 7.18.
a corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit, nor a good Tree bring forth evil
Fruit. Chap. 12.34.
And out of the abundance of the Heart, the Mouth speaks.

Q. For what other Reason is it necessary that we should be renewell in the
Spirit of our Mind, and pure in Heart?

A. It is also necessary, because Christ gave himself for us, to redeem us from
all INiquity, and purify to himself a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.
Tit. 2.14.

Q. Is there any other Reason why it should be necessary to be renewed in the
Spirit of our Mind, and be pure in Heart?

A. It is also necessary, because hereby Col. 1.12.
we are made meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light:
Joh. 3.3.
And except we be born again, we cannot see the Kingdom of God.

Q. Why can we not?

A. Because God is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all: and therefore we
cannot have Fellowship with him, and walk in Darkness. 1 John 1. 5, 6.

Q. Are you able of your self to believe and repent, and make you a lcean
Heart, and obey God's Laws?

A. Phil. 4.13.
I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me: Joh. 15.5.
but without him I can do nothing.

Q. Is Christ ready to enable you with his Grace and Spirit?

A. He has promised that Mat. 13.12.
to him that has shall be given, (that is, that uses the Strength he has
already received) and he shall have abundance. Luke 11.13.
And that if we who are evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children,
how much more shall our heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit unto them that ask
him?

Q. What were those Operations of the Holy Ghost which were proper and peculiar
to the first Ages of the Church?

A. First, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father did send in Christ's Name, did teach
the Apostles all things, and brought all things to their Remembrance whatsoever
he had said unto them. Joh. 14.26.

Secondly, Acts 2.1, 4.
when the Day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one
place, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with
other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. Mat. 3.11.
And they were baptized with the Holy Ghost and with Fire; Acts 2.3.
when there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of Fire, which sat upon
all of them.

Thirdly, When Mark 13.11.
they were led before Rulers, Luke 12.12.
the Holy Ghost did teach them in the same hour what they ought to say.

Fourthly, To one was given, by the Spirit, the Word of Wisdom; to another the
Word of Knowledge by the same Spirit; to another the working of Miracles, to
another Prophecy, to another discerning of Spirits, to another diverse kinds of
Tongues, to another the Interpretation of Tongues. 1 Cor. 12.8, 9, 10.

Q. For what End were these extraordinary Gifts and Operations of the Holy
Ghost?

A. By these the Holy Ghost was a Witness that God has exalted his Son Jesus
with his Right Hand, to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give Repentance unto
Israel, and Forgiveness of Sins. Acts 5.32.

Q. What Operations and Gifts of the Holy Ghost have and shall continue in all
Ages of the Church?

A. The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Longsuffering, Gentleness,
Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance. Gal. 5.22, 23.

Q. Will God accept nothing less than absolutely Perfect and Sinless Obedience?

A. If any Man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
Righteous. 1 John 2.1.

Q. What are the special Means in the use of which we may expect the conveyance
of God's Grace?

A. They are the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer.

Q. What read you of the Word or Holy Scriptures?

A. I read that they are able to make us wise to Salvation. 2 Timothy 3.15.

Q. Is it not sufficient to believe as the Church believes, as the Papists say?

A. No: but I must Joh. 5.39.
search the Scriptures: 1 Thessalonians. 5.21.
And prove all things, and hold fast that which is good.

Q. May the Scriptures be understood by simple People in all things necessary
to Salvation?

A. Yes: Ps. 19.7. Ps. 119.130.
God's Word gives Light and Understanding to the Simple. 2 Cor. 4.3.
And if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

Q. Are the Scriptures able to make wise to Salvation without the Addition of
unwritten Traditions, which the Papists do make necessary?

A. Yes certainly: For all Scripture is given by Inspiration of god, and is
profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in
Righteousness: That the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all
good Works. 2 Timothy 3.16, 17.

Q. How must we read and hear the Word?

A. Jam. 1.21.
We must lay apart all Filthiness and Superfluity of Naughtiness, and receive
with Meekness the ingrasted Word, which is able to save our Souls. 1 Pet. 2.2.
And as newborn Babes, desire the sincere Milk of the Word, that we may grow
thereby.

Q. Then mere bearing or reading the Word is not sufficient?

A. We must be Doers of the Word, and not Hearers only, deceiving our own
selves. Jam. 1.22.

Q. What must we do besides reading and hearing God's Word, that we may yield
Obedience to it?

A. We must Ps. 119.11.
hide it in our Hearts, Ver. 15.
and meditate therein.

Q. Must we not also pray to God for his Blessing to make his Word effectual?

A. Yes: We must pray unto God to Ps. 119.33.
teach us the way of his Statutes: Ver. 36.
And to incline our Hearts unto his Testimonies.

Q. How many Sacraments are there?

A. Two: Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.

Q. What is Baptism?

A. Baptism is Acts 10.47.
washing with Water, Mat. 28.19.
in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

Q. What is the inward spiritual Grace of Baptism?

A. It is the Tit. 3.5.
washing of Regeneration, Acts 22.6.
or the washing away of Sins.

Q. What does your Baptism oblige you to?

A. My Baptism obliges me to put on Christ. Gal. 3.27.

Q. What is it to put on Christ?

A. To put on Christ, is to name the Name of Christ, [or, to profess
Christianity,] and depart from all Iniquity. 2 Timothy 2.19.

Q. HOw does your Baptism oblige you to depart from all Iniquity?

A. So many of us as are baptized into Christ, were baptized into his Death:
therefore we are buried with him by Baptism into Death, that like as Christ was
raised up from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even so we also should walk
in Newness of Life. Romans 6.3, 4.

Q. Does not our Baptism oblige us to love one another, and to keep the Unity
of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace?

A. Yes: For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body. 1 Cor. 12.13.

Q. What is the Lord's Supper?

A. The Lord's Supper is Mat. 26.26, etc. Luke 22.19.
Bread broken and caten, and Wine poured forth and drunk, in remembrance of
Christ: Esaias 53.5.
who was wounded for our Transgressions, and bruised for our Sins: Mat. 26.28.
And whose Blood was shed for the Remission of our Sins.

Q. How long is the Death of Christ to be remembered in the Lord's Supper?

A. As often as we eat this Bread, and drink this Cup. we do show the Lord's
Death till he come, [or, till he comes to Judgment.] 1 Cor. 11.26.

Q. May the Cup be denied to any that receive the Bread, as the Papists do to
all the Laity?

A. No certainly: For Christ took the Cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
saying, Drink ye all of it, Mat. 26.27.

Q. Is the Lord's Supper a proper Sacrifice, or is the Body of Christ again
offered up therein for the Quick and Dead, as the Papists say?

A. No, by no means: But 1 Cor. 11.26.
his Death is therein showed forth: Heb. 9.26.
For otherwise must he often have suffered, but now once has he appeared to
put away Sin, by the Sacrifice of himself.

Q. What is the Meaning of those words, Take, eat, this is my Body?

A. Christ has told us his Meaning, in saying, Do this in remembrance of me.
Luke 22.19.

Q. Is Christ's Body confined always to Heaven?

A. The Heavens must receive [or, retain] him, until the times of restitution
of all things, [or, till the last Day.] Acts 3.21.

Q. How may we worthily receive the Lord's Supper?

A. Let a Man examine himself, and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of
that Cup. 1 Cor. 11.28.

Q. What if you should receive the Lord's Supper unworthily, that is, in the
allowance of known Sins?

A. He that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks Damnation to
himself, not discerning the Lord's Body, [or, not making a difference between
the Lord's Supper and his ordinary Meals.] 1 Cor. 11.29.

Q. What is the Advantage that accrues to those who worthily receive it; that
is, that receive it with firm Resolutions against all Sin, and with a thankful
Sense of the Love of Christ?

A. To such the Cup of Blessing which we bless, it is the Communication of the
Blood of Christ; and the Bread which we break, it is the Communication of the
Body of Christ. 1 Cor. 10.16.

Q. How does the Receiving the Lord'-Supper farther engage unto Holiness?

A. the Receiving thereof does farther engage us to Holiness, as it is a
showing forth of Christ's Death; whose Love in dying for us constrains us [to
all holy Obedience:] because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were
all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth
live to themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. 2 Cor.
5.14, 15.

Q. Does it not for the same reason in a special manner engage us to love each
other?

A. Yes: For we are commanded to walk in love, as Christ also has loved us.
Ephesians. 5.2.

Q. For what other Reason does it engage us to love each other?

A. For this Reason, because we being many, are one Bread and one Body; for we
are all Partakers of that one Bread. 1 Cor. 10.17.

Q. What is Prayer?

A. Prayer is the making known our Requests to God, with Thanksgiving for all
the good things we have received. Phil. 4.6.

Q. Must not our Hearts go alone with our Words?

A. We must lift up our Hearts with our Hands unto God in the Heavens. Lam.
3.41.

Q. Then you cannot think it lawful to pray in an unknown Tongue, as the
Papists generally do?

A. No, in no wise: Seeing we must 1 Cor. 14.15.
pray with the Understanding, Ps. 62.8.
and pour out our Hearts before God.

Q. Is it not for the same Reason unlawful to use Prayers in the Public
Congregations in a Language unknown to the generality of the People, according
to the Custom of the Popish Church?

A. 1 Cor. 14.9.
Except Men utter by the tongue Words easy to be understood, how shall it be
known what is spoken? for they shall speak into the Air: Ver. 16.
and how shall the Unlearned say Amen, seeing he understands not what is said?
Ver. 19.
Therefore St. Paul says, he had rather speak five Words in the Church with
his Understanding, that he might teach others also, than ten thousand Words in
an unknown Tongue.

Q. In what posture of Body should we pray?

A. We should bow down and kneel before the Lord our Maker. Ps. 95.6.

Q. How must we do that our Prayers and thanksgivings may be accepted?

A. 1 timothy 2.8.
We must lift up holy Hands without Wrath and doubting (of God's Power or
Goodness.) Col. 3.17.
And whatsoever we do in Word or Dead, we must do all in the Name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, giving Thanks unto God, and the Father by him.

Q. May we not pray to the Angels, and the Virgin Mary, and other Saints, as
the Mediators with God for us, as the Papists do?

A. It Is utterly unlawful so to do: For there is one (only) Mediator between
God and Men, the Man Christ Jesus. 1 Timothy 2.5.

Q. What if we regard Iniquity in our Hearts when we pray?

A. Ps. 66.18.
If we regard Iniquity in our hearts, the Lord will not hear us. Joh. 9.31.
But if any Man be a Worshipper of God, and does his Will, him he hears.

Q. What shall be after Death?

A. It is appointed to Men once to die, and after this the Judgment. Heb. 9.27.

Q. Who shall be the Judge?

A. The Father judges no Man, but has committed all Judgment unto the Son.
Joh. 5.22.

Q. Who must appear before this Judge?

A. We must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ. 2 Cor. 5.10.

Q. Why must we all appear before Christ's Judgment Seat?

A. That every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to that
he has done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Cor. 5.10.

Q. Who are they that shall not be condemned by this Judge?

A. There is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, [or, are true
Christians,] who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit. Romans 8.1.

Q. What shall immediately go before the general Judgment?

A. All that are in the Grave shall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and shall
come forth. Job. 5.28.

Q. What shall follow the general Judgment?

A. To them, who by patient Continuance in well-doing, seek for Glory, Honor
and Immortality, Christ will give eternal Life; but to them who do not obey the
Truth, but obey Unrighteousness, Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and
Anguish, upon every Soul of Man that does evil: But Glory, Honor and Peace, to
every Man that works good. Romans 2.7, 8, 9, 10.

Q. What shall become of this World after the Judgment?

A. The Heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the Elements shall melt
with fervent Heat; the Earth also, and the Works that are therein shall be
burnt up. 2 Pet. 3.10.

Q. Seeing you profess to believe these things, what manner of Person ought you
to be?

A. 2 Pet. 3.11, 14.
I ought to live in all holy conversation and Godliness, and to be diligent,
that I may be found of God in Peace, without spot and blameless. 1 Cor. 15.58.
And to be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord, for
as much as I know that my Labor is not in vain in the Lord.

THE END.
The Creed.
I Believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth; And in Jesus
Christ, his only Son, our Lord; Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of
the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried:
He descended into Hell; the third Day he rose again from the dead: He ascended
into Heaven, and sits on the Right Hand of God the Father Almighty: From
thence he shall come to judge the Quick and the Dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost; The holy Catholic Church; The Communion of
Saints; The Forgiveness of Sins; The Resurrection of the Body; And the Life
Everlasting. Amen.

The Lord's Prayer.
OUr Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name: Thy Kingdom come: Thy
Will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this Day our daily Bread;
And forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us: And
lead us not into Temptation; But deliver us from Evil: For thine is the
Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

The Ten Commandments.
I. GOD spoke these Words and said, I am the Lord thy God, Thou shall have no
other Gods but me. II. Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image, nor
the Likeness of any Thing that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, or
in the Water under the Earth. Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship
them: For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and visit the Sins of the
Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation of them that
hate me: and show Mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my
Commandments. III. Thou shall not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain:
for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain. IV.
Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath Day. Six days shall thou labor, and
do all that thou have to do; but the seventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God: In it thou shall do no manner of Work, thou, and thy Son, and thy
Daughter; thy Manservant, and thy Maid Servant, thy Cattle, and thy Stranger
that is within thy Gates. For in six Days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the
Sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh Day: Wherefore the Lord
blessed the seventh Day, and hallowed it. V. Honor thy Father and thy Mother,
that thy Days may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God gives thee. VI.
Thou shall do no Murder. VII. Thou shall not commit Adultery. VIII. Thou shall
not steal. IX. Thou shall not bear false Witness against thy Neighbor. X. Thou
shall not covet thy Neighbor's House, thou shall not covet thy Neighbor's
Wife, nor his Servant, nor his Maid, nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor any thing
that is his.
A Morning Prayer.
O Most Blessed and Glorious Lord God, I thy poo^ Creature do desire in all
Humility to offer up unt^ thee my Morning Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving
which I beseech thee most graciously to accept in a^^ through thine only
begotten Son, and my dear Savior.

I praise thy holy Name, that thou have preserved me from the Dangers of the
Night past, whereas I might have sl^^^ the Sleep of Death; that thou have
refreshed my Body wi^^ comfortable Rest, and have raised me to see the Light of
another Day, to walk before thee in the Land of the Living. In the^ O Lord, I
live, and move, and have my Being; and un^^ thee am I indebted for all the
Comforts of my Life, which are more than can be numbered. O that the Riches of
the Goodness, and Forbearance, and Long-suffering, might lea^ me to Repentance.
Lord, humble me, that I have not rendered unto thee according to the great
Mercies I have received from thee; that I have been so for getful of thee, a^^
disobedient to thy holy Law^^ that I have sinned against Heaven and in thy
sight, and have made my self unworth to be called thy Child, and to receive the
least good thing at thy hands.

Good Lord, give me such a sense of my Sins, as may b^* get in me an holy
Hatred of them, and that godly Sorro^ for them, which may cause me for ever to
leave and forsake them: And then according to thy tender Merci^^ in Christ
Jesus, be thou graciously pleased to blot out amine Iniquities, and to give me
the free and full pardon of them.

Enable me by Faith to embrace the Promises, and ob^^ the Precepts of the
Gospel: Give me such a Faith as m^^ purisy my Heart, and overcome all the
Temptations (...) the World, the Flesh, and the Devil.

O let thy Holy Spirit sanctify my throughout, and give me more and more Grace
and strength, whereby I may be enabled to subdue all my corrupt and sinful
Affections.

O let thy Grace which has brought Salvation to me, teach me, that, denying
Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, I may live soberly, righteously, and godly in
this present World: Looking for that blessed Hope, and the glorious Appearance
of the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ; who gave himself for me, that
he might redeem me from all Iniquity, and make me zealous of good Works: Wean
my Heart from all the Vanities of this World, and help me to set my Affections
on things above, where Christ sits at the Right Hand of God. And I beseech
thee to watch over me for good this Day; grant that I fall into no Sin, nor run
into any kind of Danger; but that all my Doings may be ordered by thy Laws, to
do always that which is righteous in thy sight.

Together with my self, do good unto all Mankind: Let the whole Earth be filled
with the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.

Bless thy Church in these Kingdoms: Bless our King and Queen, and all that are
put in Authority under them.

Be good and gracious to all my Relations, Friends and Acquaintance, and to
this whole Family.

O that we may have Grace to serve thee acceptably, with Reverence and godly
Fear, and so live together here, as that we may live together in thine Heavenly
Kingdom.

Forgive, I beseech thee, all mine Enemies, and give me Grace to love them, and
to do good unto them: Relieve all that are under any Affliction: And guide us
all by thy Counsel, till at last thou shall receive us to Glory, through the
Mediation of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whose boly Name and Words I continue to
pray:

Our Father, etc.
An Evening Prayer.
UNto thee, O Lord, I commend my self this Night, returning thee all possible
Praise for my Preservation, and all the Comforts of this Day, and my Life past,
but especially for that unspeakable Gift of thine, Jesus Christ; and all the

O let this Love of thine constrain me to all holy Obedience: Let me be
persuaded by thy Mercies to offer u^ my self a living Sacrifice, holy and
acceptable unto the^ which is my reasonable Service.

I humbly beseech thee, remember not against me any of the Follies or
Infirmities I have been guilty of, an^ keep me this Night under the Wings of
thy Providence* Let not any Fears disturb me, nor evil Thoughts seize (...) me:
Give me comfortable Rest and Sleep, and raise m^ up in the Morning with a quick
sense of thee my God and with renewed Resolutions to spend the Remainder (...)
my Life in thy Fear, and to thy Glory. This I humbly beg in the Name of thy
Son, and my dear Savior Jesus Christ, and farther pray as he has taught me:

Our Father, etc.
FINIS.
