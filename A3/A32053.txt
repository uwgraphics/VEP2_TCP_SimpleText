BY THE KING.
A Proclamation for the speedy calling in of all Sheriffs, Escheators,
Receivers, Fee-Farmers, Farmers of Recusants Lands, and all other Tenants who
hold of the King in Capite by Knights-Service, To pay His Majesty's Duties at
His Exchequer at OXFORD.

WHEREAS We are fully satisfied, as well by Records out of Our Court of
Exchequer, as by information of the several Officers of Our said Court, that
diverse Sheriffs, and Escheators of Counties, Cities, and Towns Corporate,
Receivers, Bailiffs of Liberties, and other Accomptants; As also diverse of Our
Fee-Farmers, Farmers of Recusants Lands, and other Tenants, who hold of Us in
Capite by Knights service or otherwise; under color and pretense of the
present Distractions, and Troubles of these times, have wholly neglected to make
their Accounts, and pay those duties which belong unto Us, and to do and
perform their Services for their Tenures; And taking into consideration how
much this neglect of theirs, tends to Our prejudice and disservice; We have
thought fit by this Our Proclamation, to Publish and Declare Our Will and
Pleasure to be; And We do hereby straightly Charg and Command all Sheriffs, and
Escheators of Counties, Cities, and Towns Corporate, Receivers, Bailiffs of
Liberties, and all other Accomptants, as also all Our Fee-Farmers, Farmers of
Recusants Lands, and Tenants who hold of Us in Capite by Knights-service, or
other Services, that they forth with take notice of this Our Proclamation, and
either in their own Persons, or by some others whom they shall appoint,
(according as it has bin heretofore used by them respectively) make their
appearance at Our Court of Exchequer at Oxford, in Easter Term next, (where
they shall find Officers and Clerks appointed for the dispatch of Our
affairs and business, in and concerning the Premises, according to the ancient
and usual course of Our said Court,) and then and there to return their
several Process, formerly issued out unto them out of Our said Court; and be
apposed, charged, and finish their Accounts, and pay Us Our duties and do Us
all other Services, as severally and respectively, they and every of them ought
to have done, at or before the time herein limited, under pain of Our high
Displeasure; As also such other punishments, which by the Laws of this
Kingdom, may be inflicted upon them for their neglect or contempt herein;
Letting them know We cannot esteem them well affected to Us, who shall, under
any excuse, pretense, or color whatsoever, neglect their known Duties, wherein
Our Rights, and Profits are so much concerned. And hereof none, whom it may
concern, are to fail, as they respect their own indemnity, and desire to
preserve a good opinion in Us of their integrity.

Given at Our Court at OXFORD, the 25. of March in the Twentieth year of Our
Reign.
