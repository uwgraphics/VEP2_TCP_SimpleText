HARMONY Evangelical between St MATTHEW and LUKE in the deduction of CHRIST'S
Geneologie.
By William Cowpier Bishop of Galloway
Here St. Luke steping up by twenty degrees higher in the Geneologie of Chr*
then Matthew does, reckons alone.

1 God 2 Adam 3 Seth 4 Enos 5 Cainan 6 Maleleel 7 Jared 8 Enoch 9 Mathusala 10
Lamech


11 Noah 12 Sem 13 Atphaxad 14 Sala 15 Heber 16 Phalec 17 Ragau 18 Saruch 19
Nachor 20 Thara


Here the two Evangelists Reckon on together the Natural Line of our Lord from
Abraham unto David.

21 Abraham 22 Isaac 23 Jacob 24 Juda 25 Phares 26 Ezrom 27 Aram 28 Aminadab 29
Naasson 30 Salmon 31 Booz 32 Obed 33 Jesse 34 David


From David St. Matthew reckons the legal Line of Christ to let us see that
Jesus Christ was lawfully King of the Jews and did Succeed by the law as
nearest of Kin to sit upon the Throne of David his Father. From David St. Luke
reckons the natural line of Chr: to let us see that. Jesus Christ is the son
of David naturally descended of him by Nathan according to the flesh, For the
Messiah was promissed to be the son of David the King of Israel and Juda.
Solomon Roboam Abia Asa Josaphet Joram Ozias Joatham Achaz Ezekias Manasses
Amon Josias Jechonias Here ends the race of Solomon.

35 Nathan 36 Mattatha 37 Menan 38 Melca 39 Eliakim 40 Jonan 41 Joseph 42 Judah
43 Simeon 44 Levi 45 Matthat 46 Jorim 47 Eli 48 Josse 49 Er 50 Elmodam 51 Cosam
52 Addi 53 Melchi 54 Neri
Where St Matthew calls Salathiel the son of Jechonias, understand his legal son
succeeding as ye nearest of Kindred. Where St Luke calls Salathiel ye son of
Neri, understand, ye natural son of Neri 55 Salathiel 56 Pedaiah 57 Zorobabel


Saint Matthew reckons in this line the forefathers of Joseph Saint Luke
reckons in this the forefathers of Mary Abiud Eliakim Azar Sadoc Achim Eliud
Eliazar Matthan Jacob Joseph Jesus Christ
58 Rhesa 59 Joanna 60 Juda 61 Joseph 62 Sem 63 Mattathia 64 Maath 65 Nagge 66
Esli 67 Naum 68 Amos 69 Mattathias 70 Joseph Joseph is called by St Luke the
son of Heli because he was his son in law
71 Joanna 72 Melchi 73 Levi 74 Matthat 75 Heli 76 Mary 77 Jesus Christ


This Geneologie has five Sections, all running (for memories sake) as St.
Matthew does, from Fathers to Children. The first from Adam to Noah; The second
from Noah to Abraham: The third from Abraham to David; The fourth from David to
Zorobabel; The fifth from him to Christ. In the first and second, St. Luke
runns alone; In the third St Matthew and St Luke run together, In the fourth
they take different courses. St Matthew goeing down from David by Solomon, St
Luke from David by Nathan (not Nathan the prophet but another of that name
David's son by Bathsheba, and so Solomon's brother germane) both meet in
Salathiel-where goeing on two Stepps together, they part again, the one taking
his course from Zorobabel by Abiud to Joseph; the other, Rhesa to Mary, both of
them meel in Jesus Christ.

Thus you have the golden line of Christ it begins at the first Adam, and is
absolved in the second, it contains a roll of the Fathers, who through the
privilege of the first borne were ordinary Doctors and chief lights of the
Church, till the coming of Christ. Upon this golden line runs ye whole book
of God, He that would read it with profit, must remember the course of the
spirit in the deduction of this line. If at any time he divert from it, it is
only to enterlace a purpose which may clear the story of the line. So with a
description of the lineage of Seth, he adjoynes a description of the offspring
of Cain, when he draws the posterity of Sem, he adds the seed of Japhet and
Cham, and as he handles the history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, So likewise
of Nahor, Ismael, and Esau but as we may easily perceive, he insists not long
on any of them, who are beside the line; but having spoken so much of them as
may clear the story of the line, he returns to his purpose (leaving them)
until he comes to the fore-promised shiloh, Jesus the son of the most high
and everliveing God.
