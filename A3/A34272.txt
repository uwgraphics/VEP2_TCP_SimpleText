A Congratulation on the Happy Discovery of the Hellish Fanatic Plot.
To the Tune of, Now, now the Fight's done.
1.
COme now let us Rejoice,
And the City Bells ring,
And the Bonefires kindle,
Whilst unto the KING
We pay on our Knees
The grand Tribute that is due,
Of Thanks and Oblations,
Which now we renew,
For Mercies that we
Have received of late,
From Prudence and Justice
Diverting our Fate.
2.
The Curtain is drawn,
And the Clouds are dispersed;
The PLOT's come to light,
That in darkness did Nest:
Jack Calvin's displayed
With his Colors in Grain,
And who were the Traitors
And Villains it is plain:
The Traps that they laid,
And the Snares that they set,
Have caught them at last
In their own silly Net:
3.
The Foreman himself,
That Offspring of Hell,
In whose wicked Breast
All Treason does dwell,
To the Tower is sent,
With his Triple Name,
Whilst the Triple-Tree groans
For his Carcass again,
And many Rogues more
Their Leader will follow
Unto the same Place,
Whilst we whoop and Hollow.
4.
The Libelling Tribe
Who so long have Reigned,
And sowed Sedition,
Shall now be Arraigned;
Their Shams and their Lies
Shall do them no good,
When they come to the Tree,
There Is no Shamming that Wood:
Janeway and Curtis
In the Forlorn Hope,
Then Vile, Smith and Care
Shall Neck the next Rope.
5.
So, so, let them dye
That would Monarchs destroy,
And spit all their Venom
Our Land to annoy:
If that their Power were
To their Malice equal,
And their Courage the same,
They Would soon ruin all;
But their Courage is low,
And their Power but small;
Their Treason is High,
And must have a Fall.
6.
When Trojans of Old
(Our Ancestors) were
In danger of Shipwreck,
And tossed here and there;
Great Neptune soon queli'd
Those Rebels and Storms,
With brandished Trident,
And freed them from harms;
They fled from his Face,
Through the guilt of their Cause,
As these from our Lion,
If he stretch out his Paws.
7.
Go Devils, be gone
To the Region below,
Here Is no business of yours,
Or ought left to do:
No Tempter we need,
We can act all our selves,
Without any help
From you silly Elves;
For what Presbyter Acts,
He thinks a disgrace
All Hell should out-doe him,
Or dare show their Face.
8.
For produce all the Ill
That Hell ever hatched,
It Is nothing at all,
When it comer to be match's
With what has been Plotted
By Traitors of late,
Who aimed at the Ruin
Of Church, and of State:
By Perjury, Bribes,
By suborning all Evil,
By Murder, and worse
Than e're came from the Devil.
9.
Now Presbyter come
And submit thy stiff Neck,
Thou labour'st in vain
Our great Monarch to check;
Whose Power Divine
No Mortals control,
But hazard the loss
Of both Body and Soul:
Then banish for ever
Your Commonwealth hope,
Which tends to destruction,
And ends with A ROPE.
EPILOGUE.
With Wine of all sorts
Let the Conduits run free,
And each true heart drink
The KING's Health on his Knee,
No Treason shall lodge
In our Breasts while we live,
To God, and to Caesar
Their Due we will give;
We Will pray with our Hearts,
And fight with our Hands,
Against all Fanatics,
When Great CHARLES Commands.
