Dear and truly beloved in the everlasting Seed and holy Covenant of Life
Eternal, does my soul salute you, with Love unfeigned, for by the same holy
pure spirit, by which we have been comforted and refreshed in one another many
a time when we have been together, by the same are you brought to my
remembrance, and my spirit gives thanks to God daily on your behalf (to whom I
am knit and united by a bond inseparable) because of your preservation in the
faith, and patience of Jesus our Lord, that though the mountains have swelled
to a great height, and the waves of the raging Sea has rolled so violently
against the rock of your dwelling; yet you are where you were, and your faith
is confirmed through your tribulations, and your patience enlarged through the
experience thereof. Oh dear Lambs! What has our God done for us? His arm
has been underneath in all our trials, else we must needs have fainted long
e're now: But herein does my soul rejoice, that your testimony does live, and
that all the strength of darkness ha^h not sl^^^ it, but it remains as a Crown
upon your heads. Oh my dear friends, let no man take away this your Crown, and
let none lose the price he has already paid, for if any man suffer his
testimony to fall, after he has begun to bear it, he loses his sufferings
that he has suffered, and it is not accounted unto him, but as a reproach, as
he that began to build an house, and could not finish it: Therefore, dear
hearts, you that have this glorious testimony of salvation and life committed
unto you, be tender and careful of it, as of your most choice treasure, and
count it not a small thing that God has done for you; for no honor is like
unto this honor, nor no freedom is like the being a faithful servant of God;
for it has the reward of this life, and of that which is to come: But alas,
my dear friends, none can accomplish this blessed testimony in these days of
trial, but those alone, who knows the daily renewing of that power, by which
we were called unto it; and none feels those renewings, but they that daily
wait upon the Lord, who is the well spring of all our strength and refreshment;
and when so ever any comes to slight their watch, and to neglect their waiting
upon God, they are but as those that forsake the Fountain, and grows into
dryness and barrenness, and becomes unfruitful to God, or their own good:
Therefore keep your dependence upon the Lord, that ye may abide, (for he
abides) and they that are built upon him alone, do also abide unto the end;
for it is the unchangeable power which makes you unchangeable in your
testimony; and as you dwell in that, you have the promise, and cannot be
brought to naught, as many have been, who have been exalted in the Knowledge,
and grown careless of the Cross, who are already fallen, and set forth (as Lots
Wife once was) as exampses of the judgment of God: but such as have their
depondance upon the Lord alone, fe^l^ alw^^es cause in themselves to be humble,
and lowly minded; and although they be joined to the power of God in the
Covenant of his Light, yet self is kept in the death, and the confidence is in
the power, and the honor of all is given to that which is eternal, and not to
the creature, though never so pure: And they who thus in the true humility
gives the honor of their standing and preservation unto the Lord, and not unto
themselves, nor their parts, wits, understandings, nor resolutions, these does
God sufficiently honor with his glory and presence, and supports them in all
their exercises: But who ever comes to disregard the power, and thinks to stand
by what he knows, and has seen, he stands but in a slippery place.

And dear Friends and Brethren, Remember to keep holy the Sabbath of the Lord
our God which is now come, and see that you rest from your labors and toyling
your spirits in the earth, and earthly things; and whoever feels a burden, lay
it off, whatever it be, that ye may possess all things in the free spirit, that
looks not at the vallue of any thing in comparison of the truth, remembering the
words of the Lord, That where the treasure is, the heart will also be: So that
whose heart is in a Wife, in an Husband, in Children, in Trade, in Riches, in
Houses and Lands, or whatever else, so far that they cannot willingly give
them up for the truth, these are such as ones treasure, and this treasure is in
the earth, and the heart is there, whatever they profess; and these things
comes to be the gods in the secret chambers besides the Lord; and so his first
and lasting Commandment (who said) Thou shall have none other gods besides me,
is broken; and this brings guilt and burdens upon the soul, and then thou
can not keep Sabbath to God, for no burden must be borne thereon, but he
that is entered into the rest, is ceased from his labor, as God did from his,
and such keeps the holy Sabbath. So, dearly beloved, east away that labor and
toil which has made some to walk uncomfortably in the way, and some to faint
and fall from it, and lift up your hearts to God in the faith, and give up your
selves, and all things in his will, and there comes an end of all your cares at
once, saveing only to be found doing his will in your Generation.

And in this blessed service, is my rejoyceing, and my fellowship with you, and
with all the faithful in Christ Jesus, in whose love my heart is at this time
enlarged toward you, beyond what words can utter; yet having no new thing to
write unto you, but the very same which we have heard and learnt from the
beginning, to wit, that glorious testimony of the Resurrection of Life and of
salvation, which God, through the manifestation of his Son, has committed
unto us to bear, in which blessed testimony, I still labor in the strength of
the Lord, and he has blessed me therein, and caused me, by the operation of
his divine love, to sound the same Gospel unto several Countries and Nations
in the Eastern parts of the World, where a door of utterance is opened unto
me, and many has believed, and obeyed the truth; and having now been in
England visiting the Churches of Christ about four Months, I am again, in the
will of God, about to cross the Seas, though I much desired first to have seen
your faces in the Northern parts, whom my soul dearly loves; but the
necessities of other Nations and Countries, brings a constraint upon me at this
time to omit it; but the salutation of my love abounds toward you, and I pray
God give you a liveing sense thereof in your selves, to the comforting and
refreshing of every faithful one amongst you. Farewell, and the God of Peace
multiply and increase his goodness in all your souls, and preserve you alive
to himself, to bear his holy testimony amongst his enemies, that the World may
know that he is risen that saves and preserves from falling, to whom belongs
everlasting honor, everlasting renown and dominion for ever, and evermore.

Essex this 15th. of the first Month, 1670. Your dear Friend and Brother in
the Truth, and Companion in the Kingdom, patience, and tribulations of Jesus.
