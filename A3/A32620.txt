A PROCLAMATION Prohibiting the keeping of the Mart at BOSTON, in the County of
LINCOLN.
CHARLES REX,

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, out of His Princely and Christian care of
his loving Subjects, That no good means of Providence may be neglected, to stay
the further spreading of the great Infection of the Plague, does find it
necessary to prevent all occasions of Public Concourse of His People for the
present, till it shall please Almighty God, of His Goodness, to cease the
violence of the Contagion, which is very far dispersed into many parts of this
Kingdom already; and therefore, remembering that there is at hand a Mart or Fair
of Note, unto which there is usually extraordinary Resort out of several Parts
of the Kingdom kept at Boston in the County of Lincoln; The holding whereof at
the usual time, would, in all likelihood, be the occasion of further Danger and
Infection to other Parts of the Land, which yet, by Gods Mercy, stands clear
and free, Has (with the Advice of his Privy Council) thought good, by this
open Declaration of his Pleasure and necessary Commandment, not only to
admonish and require all his loving Subjects to forbear to Resort, for this
time, to the said Mart or Fair kept at Boston aforesaid, or to any other Fair
or Fairs in the said County of Lincoln; But also to enjoin the Lord or Lords of
the said Fair, or others interested therein, that they all forbear to hold the
said Fair, or any thing appertaining thereunto, at the time accustomed, or at
any other time, till by Gods goodness and mercy the Infection of the Plague
shall cease, or be so much diminished, that His Majesty shall give Order for
holding them, upon pain of such Punishment, as for a Contempt, so much
concerning the general Safety of His People, they shall be adjudged to deserve,
which they must expect to be Inflicted with all severity. And to that purpose,
does hereby further charge and enjoin (under the like Penalty) all Citizens and
Inhabitants of the Cities of London and Westminster, That none of them shall
repair unto any Fairs, held within any part of this Kingdom, until it shall
please God to cease the Infection still continuing amongst them. His Majesty's
Intention being, and so hereby Declaring Himself, That no Lord of any Fair, or
others interested in the Profits thereof, shall, by this necessary and
temporary Restraint, receive any prejudice in the right of his or their Fairs,
or Liberties thereunto belonging; any thing beforementioned notwithstanding.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, the Tenth Day of November, in the Seventeenth
Year of our Reign.
GOD SAVE THE KING.
