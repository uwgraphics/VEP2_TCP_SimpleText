A DREAM OR NEVVES FROM HELL.
NOT long since an honest Yeoman coming up to London, to petition to the most
honorable High Court of Parliament in his own behalf, for an especial wrong
he had recei^ed from certain Projectors, who had encroached upon a parcel of
his Freehold, near to the Common where he dwelt, by direction of some
well-minded people, came into Westminster Hall, where having walked a long time
up and down, and not knowing unto whom to deliver his petition, among so many
hundreds that he met withal, at last being desirous to take some repast,
wherewith he might revive and comfort himself, he came to a place near
adjoining, which was termed by the name of Hell, and having well satisfied
himself with such a portion of meat and drink as be thought might content his
appetite, he demanded what might be to pay, and finding the reckoning to be
beyond his expectation, he grew very much discontented at the payment thereof,
and repairing presently to his Lodging, being not far off, and being very
much perplexed at his former Reckoning, he resolved at the last to betake
himself to his Bed, and not long after falling into a slumbring sleep (diverse
Whimzies and diversities of Motions, swimming in his brain of the supposed
Hell where he had formerly been) he dreamed he was in the true and local Hell
indeed:

Where being affrighted with the apparitions of diverse hideous and ugly
deformed diabolical Fiends, who were by his cogitation numberless, he was
transported by his fancy to the great Court of Grand Pluto, who being attended
with a multitude of his black Guard, and other his stigmaticall Officers,
there was an instant hurly-burly and combustion in the Court, about the
suddenness of Grand-Pluto falling into a greevous sickness; wherefore all the
Court Doctors of Hell being summoned to appear (with an infinite company of
Witches, Conjurers, and Sorcerers, fetched from all other places, to give their
best advice therein, were admitted into his princely Chamber, and having cast
his water, and debated the matter a long time about the difficulty of his
Disease, at length they all agreed, that he fell sick of a Parliament.

Whereupon Proclamation being made in Pluto's name throughout all his Hellish
Dominions, to any whatsoever to repair unto his Court, with promises of great
reward and favor from him, that could by any ways comfort him in this
behalf. Upon a sudden there appeared a multitude in long buttoned cassacks,
high collars, and square C-ps, with small falling bands about their Necks, who
seemed to strive, agoinst all others, to be the first that might be admitted
into his presence; and these were reported to be a comp-ny of Jesuits, who
were the dear children of Pluto, who hearing that their Father was sick, came
in all submissive manner to visit him, and to offer their service unto him, and
withal informed him, that if there were any Design, Practice, Plot, Device,
Study, or other stratagem whatsoever, that could administer him any comfort, or
wherein they might any ways express their duty unto him, or further enlarge
his Kingdom, they would ride, run, go, trot, or what not to perform his
pleasure therein, and withal, desired him to be of good cheer, and to be
comforted in his Children, who were ready at all times to wait his will and
pleasure, and to execute whatsoever he should command.

Hereupon they desired their Father Pluto to take notice of the former care
they had to enlarge his Kingdom, by animating the great Metropolitan to be a
means to bring in Popery, and to do the best service he could therein.

And withal showing how they had sowed sedition and discord amongst the
English Heretics, and provoked the Scottish Heretics to rebel against their
lawful King, and to intrude into the Territories of this Land; and also had
animated their beloved Brother Cardinal de Richlieu to raise a puissant Army
for the invasion of this Land in two several places, (viz.) at Dover and
Portsmouth, at such times as the King was supposed to be most deeply employed
in his War against the Scots; and likewise have we not procured your great
Secretary of State, Don Antonio Demonibus to make an especial inrolement of
all their names in your Calendar, amongst those your dear Servants, the
Plotters of the Gunpowder Treason, and those renowned Complotters of the
former invasion into this Land in 88. and have not only animated many noble
personages, and others, to assist us in our great Design of bringing in of
Popery into this Land, but have also procured diverse Popish Books to be printed
openly, thereby the better to encourage your Highness, dear Father, and the
more to enlarge your Kingdom.

And for Courts of Justice, have we not also by our power and authority joined
with our dreadful and High Commission, brought to pass, that if any Heretic,
under the degree of a Lord, should but put on his Hat in the time of Divine
Service, we kept him in our Ecclesiastical clutches five or six years
together. And have we not likewise in the Courts of Chancery, Kings-Beach, or
common Pleas, procured diverse ways and means whereby many men (though their
cause were never so just) have been either by continual delays wearied in
their Suites, or by extorted Fees, Bri^ery, or other Devices, driven to sell
and morgage their lands, goods, and whatsoever they have bin possessed off,
that a man might have worn out* Buff-jerkins in that sp^ce, and yet they
seldom or never had an end of their suites, but have bin fleeced and jeered out
of their demeanes, so long as they could procure either money or friends, and
yet it has bin carried so reatly and cunningly, as if the course of Justice
had bin exactly performed.

And for the Court of Exchequer, we are ablefurther to testise unto you (dear
Father) out of our own knowledge, that it is one of the best Courts belonging
to your infernal Kingdom, for if a suite be once commenced there, they have
so many delays by putting in of Pleas, making of Mtions, putting off a suite
from Term to Term, after a verdict given, or framing some excuses to arise
from the Bench, when a Cause appointed for the day should be heard, or to cause
Motion upon Motion to be made, whereby so many Orders of the Court must be
drawn up, or pretending the Court not to be full, with other sinister devices
and sleights there used; that we have known some men to have served an
Apprenticeship, and bin made Freemen, and also to have married Wives, and had
children, and yet the suit formerly commenced not ended. Therefore, dear
Father Pluto, be of good comfort, and take it not so much to heart, so long as
you have such durifull children, and loving subjects; assuring your self, that
we will do our best endeavors to recover you of this Disease.

Presently after this, there came a company of fellows with broad Seals about
theit necks, who were nominated to be Pluto's Iourney-men, and had the title of
Pateatees, who also hearing that their Grand-Master was suddenly fallen sick,
presented themselves in all humble manner, the further to express their duty
and obedience unto him; Relating unto their hellish Master, that according to
their power and his appointment, they had ever bin obedient and faithful
servants unto him, in oppressing and squeezing the Commonwealth, and that they
intended to continue therein, to the end of their days, and by what means
they could possibly invent or devise, they would show themselves to be dutiful
servants unto him, in racking, poling, and pinching the poor both in city and
country, under pretense of doing good in general to the whole Commonwealth;
and further declared unto their Grand-Master, that in all their projects
whatsoever, they had sheltred themselves under some great Patron, the better to
color their fraud and deceit: and likewise, that in case they had any color
of setting the poor on work, for a general good, they might with authority
and strictness the more covertly hide their cunning and knavery, and withal
assured their great Master, that they would sit up late, rise early, and spare
no pains to increase his Kingdom, and humbly craved his approbation, that
they might be further employed either herein, or in what other business, in
that nature it pleased him to command.

Whereunto Pluto replied, that they had all done well, and left them at their
own disposing to do what they found to be convenient, and so they were
dispatched for the present.

Not long after, Cerberus the Porter of Hell, brought tidings unto the palace
of Pluto, that there was a post arrived with a packet of Letters from little
Will; whereupon Don Antonio Demonibus, his chief Secretary of State, was
presently sent for to read them unto Pluto, the contents whereof, as far as
could be gathered by those that were near about him, was to this effect, That
the said little Will, with diverse other great personages of the State, would
with all convenient speed that might be, come in person to visit his
greatness, and there to remain with him in his Court. Whereat Pluto being
very glad, began to be somewhat cheerful at the hearing of this news,
calling him by name the Son of his love, and further said, he had not thought
to have seen him so soon, as now by his letters directed unto him he did
expect: and thereupon Pluto's chief Secretary of state was commanded to send
an answer of the said packet of Letters by the same post to little Will, and
the other great personages of State aforesaid, how glad he would be of their
appearance in his Court, and what courteous entertainment they should have when
they came there. Then Pluto gave command, that the post should be Royally
rewarded for his pains, and called the post to him, and asked him what diet
little Will did delight in, because the place where I keep Court, is of a
hotter Climate then he has been in heretofore, the post made answer that
little Will formerly* did desire tips of ears, but the Cook dressed them with
the blood in them, and so he took a surfeit, and ever since lived at a sparing
diet. And further told his Highness that he need not be at too much charge for
little Wills diet, he took delight but in two dishes especially, and they were
Lamb and Duck, and those he meant to bring with him. And suddenly upon the
departure of the post with this answer, Pluto gave strict charge and command
unto his infernal attendants, that diverse fair Rooms should be presently
trimmed up, and hanged round about with Tapistry and Cloth of Arras, for the
better entertainment of little Will and his fellows, or any that came along
with him. Then I was very desirous to know what this little Will was, at the
first I could by no means learn, but at last I asked one that I supposed to
be of Pluto's near attendants, if he knew him or no, he informed me, that he
did not know him, but surely it was one that as yet had never been in Pluto's
Court before, and verily believed that he had performed some extraordinary
business in Pluto's behalf, and deserved to be highly advanced in his
infernal Court, and also supposed him to be some great personage, otherwise he
would never have received the Packet of Letters which he sent him, with such
cheerfulness, nor have given such a strict command to his chief Secretary,
and others his infernal servants, for his speedy and present entertainment to
his Court.

And notwithstanding the sudden expectation of little Wills coming into
Pluto's Court and the rest of his fellows, which did not a little comfort and
revive him in this his lingering sickness, yet Pluto found not all to be well
in himself, but grew more and more to be perplexed and so wonderfully out of
patience, that his ordinary attendants could hardly keep him in his Bed,
insomuch, that all his Hellish Doctors were once again sent for to come with
all speed unto him, who being come there, they found that he was very
dangerously sick indeed, and that he was fallen into a grievous relapse, and
that there was no means left to recover Pluto's health, and to restore him to
his former strength again, or to enlarge his infernal Kingdom, but that by
some device or other this present Parliament might be dissolved and broken up,
which being fully agreed upon by all his Doctors they informed his Highness.
That if ever he expected to regaine his former estate, or to get any footing in
England, he must with all speed call a general Council of all his infernal
and wel-beloved Subjects, that they might advise and consult what way were best
that this present Parliament might be dissolved as aforesaid.

Whereupon Cerberus by special command and appointment of Grand Pluto, had
authority to set the gates of Hell wide open, and that all passengers
whatsoever, (none to be denied) might freely have access to come and hear the
will and pleasure of Pluto, and also Charon was commanded with all possible
speed to provide himself of as many Boats as he could to ferry them from all
parts and places to this purpose, and when there was a huge multitude of all
sorts gathered together in a large and spacious place, one of the chief
Heralds belonging to the internal court cried out unto the assembly with a
loud voice, to crave a general silence, after which, Pluto thus began:

My dear children, Servants, Iourneymen, and well approved Subjects, you see
into what a low and weak estate I am brought, and as you have been dutiful
and obedient with all diligence hitherto to execute my commands, so my desire
is, that you would always continue unto the end, I cannot forget your care,
true love, industry, and pains you have taken in general, for the enlargement
of my Kingnome, and you my beloved Doctors, in endeavoring to perform your
best skill, to recover my former health, as also you my dearest children whose
Sanctity, we reverence, whose persons we adore, whose policies we wonder at,
whose power we muse at, whose invincible Stratagems we stand amazed at, and
whose Wisdoms we admire, neither can we but in the first place extol,
applaud, and highly commend you, for your extraordinary care in advancing our
infernal Dominions.

And we are also pleased of our infernal grace and favor, to take notice of
your great service done, in working the dissolution of the last Parliament, by
which means nothing was effected for the good of the Heretics, either
concerning the church or common wealth, but thereby the Nobles of England were
malcontent, the Gentry discouraged, the Commons divided, the number of our
servants, the Roman Catholics infinitely increased, and the whole Realm of
England mightily oppressed; so as the success of our design was thereby no
ways hindered.

Now my wel-beloved children, servants, Iourney-men, subjects, Allies, and all
my well-willers whom soever, if you could by any Device, Stratagem, Policy,
Money, Friendship, or any other delusive or sinister means, study to dissolve
or break up this present Parljament, which would be the only way, as we conceive
in our Diabolical Princely Wisdom, to break the bond of peace and unity
amongst them, and thereby to move God to leave them to themselves, you should
not only be enrolled in our everlasting Calendar for our dearest children and
Subjects, but also be placed near us in our favor for ever; and then also, to
our great comfort, our infernal Stratagem might speedily be executed upon
them, and our Kingdom mightily increased and enlarged.

Therefore all you my dear children, subjects, attendants, and Allies, who are
willing to do your best endeavors for the performing of this Enterprise; we
require you to be ready to take the Oath ex officio, and to lay your hands upon
the Book. Whereupon with a general acclamation and consent, they all promised
to do what possible in them lay to perform his request, and affirmed, that
they all were willing to consent to his demand, and therepon they laid their
hands upon the Book. Then Pluto causing his principal attendants to raise him
a little higher on his Pillow, proceeded on this manner: You my loving Subjects
who have stepped aside, and made your legs your best protection, you also that
are under the command of the Black Rod, and you that much fear you shall be
questioned this present Parliament, and you my Iourneymen Patentees, and the
rest of my loving Subjects here present, are you all willing to take the oath
aforesaid for the breaking up of this Parliament, then they all cried with one
voice; Willing, most willing, long live your Hellish Majesty, I believe you
(said Pluto) take your hands from the Book, I dare take your bare words.
Whereupon Pluto's great Counsel was called before his infernal Highness, and
being assembled together, they all concluded, that forthwith a Proclamation
should be sent abroad into all places in great Pluto's name, the tenor whereof
follows.

TO the Pope, our right Trusty and welbeloved Son, and all the Jesuitical
Rabble, our adopted Children, to the Spaniard, Italian, French, Dutch, or what
Nation people, or in what parts soever this shall come, these are to give
notice, that whosoever can by any fraud, friendship, money, or any other means
whatsoever, dissolve and break up this present Parliament, That thereby great
Pluto may recover not only his former health, but that his Kingdoms and
Dominions may also be enlarged, he shall for so memorable an Act, be seated in
place of Judicature with his chief Justice Rhadamantus; or next to Pluto
himself, and forthwith be made Viceroy of Hell, prince of this world,
Archduke of Styx, Acheron; and Phlegeton; Marquess of Coeytus and Lethe; and
sole Commander (under him) of all Infernal Spirits and Furies.

And hereunto, we, the said Grand Pluto have set our Hand and Seal Royal, in
the presence of all our Children, Friends and servants aforenamed.

This being proclaimed with thundering Drums, and sound of Trumpets, awaked the
honest Countryman, who having seen and observed in his Dream, all these
passages and occurrents, lay for a while as it were in a trance, trembling and
in a great ecstasy, at last recollecting his senses, he arose, and going from
his chamber to go about his business, he met by chance with two of his own
Contrymen, who had been a long time encombred with Law-suites, unto whom he
related this his Dream, with all the passages aforesaid, whereat they
wondering, and much astonished, desired him to deliver unto them a Copy
thereof in writing, which he promised, and performed the next day following.

FINIS.
