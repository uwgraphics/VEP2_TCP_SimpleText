Superiorum permissu.

To the Honorable HENRY TITCHBOURN BARONET.
Honored Sir,
WHat the Macedonians said long since; (when after the death of King Philip,
they saw his Son Alexander, succeeding no less to his Father's Virtue and
Valor, than to his Crown and Kingdom;) That their Nation had lost nothing but
the Body, not the Bravery of their Prince, nor changed its Monarch, but only
the Man, (as Justin expresses it:) The ancient Family of the Titchbourns (which
has continued successively famous in this Country, since the first coming in
of the Saxons) may truly say at this present by a particular providence of
Heaven; which depriving it of its worthy Sir Richard, has supplied his place
with a Sir Henry (your no less worthy Self:) who succeeding as well to your
parents Virtue, as to his Estate and Title; give us all, a most just and joyful
occasion to confess, that we have thereby suffered no notable change or
detriment; since the same spirit of Prudence and Discretion, which appeared in
the Predecessor, continues in the conduct and comportment of the Successor. And
surely, they who have at any time been present, (And who would not wish to be
present at so signal a Ceremony? Which I here mention amongst the many Examples
of the Fathers and Sons paralelled conformity, to eternize the deserved memory
of so heroic a Charity:) at the great Dole, freely given to all far and near
Comers, and annually distributed upon the 25 of March, (as a Memorandum, I
doubt not, of the eelestial bounty) upon that Day, in which the greatest Dole
that e're was given, (the Bread, I mean, which Angels feed on,) was bestowed
from above on starved mankind; cannot but admiringly behold so exact a
correspondency of Order, of Gravity, of Government, between him who formerly
performed this pious action, and your Self who now prosecutes it; as that the
change appears in nothing but in the Person, and the difference is only
distinguishable by the Countenance. This little I have said, (and more I dare
not, dreading the offense of your Modesty,) is chiefly in relation to Gods
Praise and Honor, who is the bountiful Author and Bestower of all good Gifts
and Blessings: For I well know, That your solid Humility suffers you not to
Attribute to your self more of all the high Favors which Nature and Heaven
have liberally heaped upon you, than the bare obligation, which is thereby
increased, of corresponding more diligently to your Duty; and, should I go
about to give you the least share of the Glory, I should at once injure the
divine Grace, and your Virtue. Wherefore to avoid the Censure of Indiscretion,
and the Suspicion of Flattery; and lest I should provoke you to indignation,
upon pretense of seeking to please you; and finally, fearing that instead of
offering you a Present, I might prepare for you a kind of Punishment: I will
spare the labor of running farther into the large field of your Praises,
(which I plainly foresee would prove as irksome to your moderation and temper,
as it is unsuitable to my custom and profession; and which indeed you would more
unwillingly permit, than I could easily perform:) Contenting my self only to
mention what I may not well smother up in silence, as directly conducing to the
design of this Dedication: which is, That the consideration of your singular
Piety to God, and sincere Devotion to the sacred Virgin Mother, has caused me
to fix my eyes upon your worthy Person, as seeming most proper to patronize
this small product of my pen, containing a Daily Exercise for all pious
Christians, in order to a holy Life, and a happy Death;) both in regard of the
sympathy between its Precepts and your Practice; and also in hopes, that your
proposed Example, may prove to others a powerful Motive of borrowing your
imitation. Nor will I doubt of your favorable acceptance of these well meant
endeavors: since what is defective in the Manner and fashion, is abundantly
supplied by the price and value of the Matter, by the profit and necessity of
the Subject, and by the hearty and unfeigned affections of the Offerer; who
ceases not daily to solicit the divine Goodness, that after a long continued
Holy Life, you may finally arrive at a Happy Death, which will be infallibly
followed with the reward of an eternal Crown of Glory and Immortality.

Honored Sir, Your most humble Orator. T. V.

An ADVERTISEMENT To the PIOUS READER.
THe good success of the two former Editions of this daily Exercise, has given
encouragement to this third. In which, (by good advice,) there are some
Additions, some Defalkations, some Alterations.

The Additions are, The Calender of the Chief of our English, British, Irish
and Scottish Saints, for each day in the year, with the time of their Deaths.
The Exhortation to all pious Christians, which is in the beginning of the Book;
and Several Prayers in the 14th Paragraf.

The Defalkations are, The seven Penetential Psalms Paraphrased; which,
(although they contain most pithy Acts of Devotion, and especially of
Contrition, yet those being supplied by many such Acts throughout the whole
work) it was judged fit to omit; as also the several unnecessary Examinations
of the Conscience, and some other few Superfluities; lest this intended
Pocketbook should have swelled to an over-big Bulk.

The Alterations, are chiefly of the You into Thou, in our addresses to the
Divine Majesty: For notwithstanding that other Nations generally make use of
that sweeter and smoother manner of expressing themselves in Prayer; yet I
durst not introduce it into our Language, for fear of incurring the Censure of
Novelty or Singularity.

What else is diversified either in the Manner, or in the Matter, will
obviously appear to the devout Peruser; to whose Prayers the Compiler humbly
commends himself.

AN EXHORTATION TO ALL PIOUS CHRISTIANS CONCERNING Their Daily Exercise of
Devotion, Declaring the Manner, the Profit, and the Necessity thereof; In order
to Live Holily, and to Die Happily.
My Time is not yet come, but your Time is always ready:

(says our Blessed Savior, in St. John 7.6.)
1. AS if he should say; The day of my own Death is in my own disposition; but
as for you, the time of your Death continually attends you: Its stroke is
unavoydable, and its surprisal dangerous. If it seises on you whilst you are in
an evil estate, you are utterly lost; on that Moment depends your Eternity of
Bliss or Bale: Happy Moment, if it find you well provided; Unhappy Moment, if
it catches you undisposed.

2. From this Advertisment of our dear Redeemer, we ought to draw a necessary
Resolution of being evermore in a Readiness, because our Time is always ready,
and we know not the Day, the Hour, the Moment of Deaths summons. And this
affords me a fit occasion, (here at the entrance into this Book, which is to
contain the chief pieces of Piety belonging to the practice of all Christians,)
to direct you, (devout Readers,) how to dispose your selves daily by your
Morning and Evening Exercises, that Death may not find you unprovided. An
affair surely of highest emportance, and therefore deserving your most serious
attention.

3. Why stand you here loytering all the day long! said the Master of the
family, (in the Parable of the Vinedressers,) to such as he found at the
Midday season, standing with folded arms, and following no manner of fruitful
employment: But how much more cause has our Creator, (represented by that
Father of the family,) to reproach the major part of Christians; who seeming so
full of bisiness in this world, stand idling all their time; and being evermore
employed, never act any thing to the purpose. Their pains-taking proves
altogether unprofitable; their Works are useless, (says the Prophet,) and they
weary out themselves in weaving Spiders Webbs Ambition takes up their time,
Avarice employs them, Vanity entertains them, Sensuality embusies them; They
run themselves out of breath after foolish Fancies and irregular Affections;
They tire themselves to content their Carnal Concupiscences, their Irregular
Passions, their Imaginary Curiosities; And yet they can never, (Ah, deceived
Mortals!) never satisfy their Desires: It being impossible to settle such
Appetites, as have no certain Rule, no solid End, no fixed Aim and Pretension.

4. And what (I pray you,) is the Fruit of all their labors! What are all
these passing things they so passionatly pursue, being compared to the Eternal
good things they neglect, to God whom they forget, to Heaven which they forego!
What are they but mere Flies, Atoms, Nothings, less than Nothings! And yet, O
the vast number of such busy Idlers, and idle Laborers! Whatsoever men act
against Gods holy Law and Precepts; whatsoever they act being out of God Grace;
whatsoever they act, not aiming at Gods honor by purity of Intention: though
they take never so much pains, yea though the Action have in it self never so
much of Moral Goodness; yet it is lost as to the Doors, it is useless to their
Souls, it is bootless for Heaven, it is nothing worth, as to the main aim of a
Christian and the final End of Man, which is Eternal Life, Eternal Felicity.

5. It Is therefore a prudent Caution, and worthy every Christians
Consideration, (who ought by Reason and may by Grace provide for his own good,)
to be evermore careful, not only to Act nothing contrary to his Salvation, but
nothing which conduces not thereto; that so he may not expend his Time, his
Toil, his Talent, foolishly, idly, unprofitably. Now he shall happily hit this
mark, who so orders the whole course of his Life, as [1.] to endeavor to keep
himself always in Gods Grace and Favor; and [2] to relate all his Actions,
(whether Commanded, or Moral, or Natural,) to the Divine Majesty, either by an
express and particular adress of his Intention to his honor, or (at least) by
a tacit, vertual, general Designation, whereby he resolv's and purposes to
perform all his Actions to his Creators praise and glory; following the
Apostles advice, Do all things to Gods Honor.

6. And because the whole course of our lives pilgrimage is composed of Years,
the years of Months, the months of Weeks, the weeks of Days; He who shall duly
settle his Course for the space of each Days duration, and diligently observe a
devout Rule for his Daily conduct; cannot fail in the happy steerage of his
whole life; wherein consists the Christians true Duty and tot^ Occupation: and
which surely is the best Preparation against that surprisal, wherewith our
present Theme threatens us; The time of our Death, (and of the Judgment which
follows it,) is ever ready and at hand: The Time is certain as to the
Execution, uncertain as to the Moment; and therefore it demands of us all, a
Preparation, daily renewed, diligently continved, devoutly preseverant.

7. Now to the end I may deliver this so useful and necessary an Instruction in
due Order and Method: it shall be briefly dividid into three Points. 1. The
Exercise for the Morning, 2. The Regulation of the Day, 3. The Exercise for the
Evening.


Which I propose to you all (Devout Christians!) not to be simply read, and so
laid aside; but to be deeply imprinted in your Memories, and duly practiced in
your Lives and Actions, according to each ones reach and capacity, and as his
leisure will give him leave; (the several Callings, Conditions, Affairs, and
Employments of the persons, being considered.)

8. These Exercises therefore, are exceeding necessary for all such Christians,
as seriously aspire to that End, which is the object of their Hope, whereto
their Faith teaches them to tend; which is, the Eternal glory of the next Life.
For he who neglects to left up his Heart to God in the days beginning, before
he gives his affection to worldly affairs; shows an ungrateful forgetfulness
of the End, to which each one ought to aspire; and sufficiently declares, that
the irregular love of temporal things, has stifled in his Soul all sense of
things Eternal: So likewise he who is careless in scanning over his Soul, and
considering his condition at the Days ending; seems he not to have a Swinish
Spirit, which has no motion but for the Body, no life but for the Belly! To
pass whole Days without any respect to God, or reflection on himself; but to
cast himself freely upon all occurring objects and occasions of Vanity,
Curiosity, Sensuality; if it is not a clear mark of Infidelity, it is certainly
a manifest token of Folly, Stupidity, Bestiality; and is surely one of the
greatest Negligences, which can possibly befall a Soul, pretending to any thing
beyond this present Life.

9. O Men! (cry's out the Prophet,) Make not your selves like Horses and Mules,
which are utterly devoid of all understanding: You have not Beast-like, Heads
bended to the Earthwards; but yet if in your Bodies erected toward Heaven, you
have Souls crouching only downwards; Souls, which neither look up in the
Morning by a Conversion, nor in the Day time by a Remembrance, nor in the
Evening by a Reflection toward the place of its Origin; but whose continual
Cogitations, Actions, Occupations, perpetually confine it to its own Prison;
Wherein do you differ from Brute-Beasts, except only in the shape of your
erected Bodies; the straightness whereof may justly upbraid the crookedness of
your Spirits, and the wryness of your Reason. If you tend to God, why think you
not of him; why send you not your daily affections to salute the object of your
pretensions; why flies not your Heart frequently toward the place where your
Treasure is! O strange disorder! God is your End, and yet the World is your
continual employment.

10. The Fruits of these Exercises are so great, that I may boldly say, It
seems in some sort impossible for such a Soul, as carefully, punctually,
preseverantly practices them, to be in danger of damnation: For by these daily
renewed Purposes and Resolutions, she gives herself daily to the Divine
Majesty; and God has bound himself by his own blessed promise, Not to abandon
him who com's unto him, but to receive him into his Protection, till he shall
admit him one day to the enjoyment of his Presence.

11. But let us descend from Generals to Particulars, from Speculation to
Practice: In the Morning season, (said the Royal Prophet,) I will present my
self before thee, (my dread Sovereign!) and I will see and consider what my
duty is toward thee, and what thou desire of me. God, in the ancient Law,
reserved to himself the First fruits of the Earth, and the First born of Men
and Beasts: And with how much more reason, should we Christians render him the
First fruits of the day, the First thoughts and affections; which being formed
after our morning Sleep, may be fitly named the First born of our Hearts! And
surely the voluntary and wretchless Omission of this Duty, draws after it a
whole Deluge of defects, imperfections, failings, fallings, venial Sins, and
sometimes mortal Crimes; into which they tumble headlong, who forgetting God,
deserve to be by him forgotten; and who in the Morning neglecting to demand his
Succor, deserve in the Day time to be destituted of his Assistance in their
several encounters and occasions.

12. If therefore (O Christian!) thou have a desire to preserve thy self from
Sin; let it be thy first care, as soon as thy Eyes are unseel'd from Sleep, to
cast them up toward Heaven; saying with the watchful Prophet; To thee, (O my
Lord!) do I life up my Eyes, my Hands, my Heart, from this Bed, where my Body
has taken 'its nightly repose, toward thy Heaven, where my Soul expects her
eternal rest, etc. And having entertained thy Soul with such like Elevations
whilst thou cloathest thy Body with its Garments, retire into thy Cabinet; cast
thy self reverently upon thy Knees, raise up thy Thoughts toward the glorious
Deity, acknowledge thy own Nothing, and adore his infinite Essence.

Then second this Act of Adoration with a consideration of the large Benefits
received from his liberal hand: The memory whereof, (which are common to all
mankind, and which being more remarkable in thy own particular than in diverse
others, must needs add weight to thy Obligation,) is a most powerful motive, to
draw from thy affectionat Heart and Mouth, Acts of Praise and Gratitude toward
thy bountiful Benefactor.

Accompany this Act of Thanksgiving, with a Remembrance of thy former
Ingratitude, which will lead thee on to Compunction and Contrition. Mark, how
thou have perverted the Gifts of Nature, abused the Gifts of Fortune, rejected
the proferr'd Gifts of Grace, contemned the promised Gifts of Glory. Cast also
a particular glance upon the most grievous Crimes of thy past Life, and reflect
briefly on such, as thou have fallen into since thy last Confession; and excite
a deep Confusion in thy Soul for her strange Disloyalty.

Let this Contrition be followed with a courageous Resolution of Amending what
is amiss, and of Corresponding better to Gods Graces for the Future; and
particularly of Employing the present Day to his honor and service; saying
with the Prophet: My Heart is prepared, (O my Lord God!) my Heart is prepared
to perform its duty, etc.

After this General Resolution of well employing the present Day; propose to
thy self in particular, those Principal Actions and Affairs, wherein thou
probably may be that Day engaged: and having ranked them in thy Mind
according to their several Orders, assigning to each of them its proper Place,
Time, and Measure; Offer them up to God with a pure Intention to seek his only
honor in their Performance, and committing all to his Providence, which will
cause them to succeed to your Good and his Glory.

Lastly, Conclude this Morning Exercise by humbly imploring thy Creators
powerful Assistance for the effectual performance of these thy pious Purposes;
saying with the same devout Prophet; Keep my stepps in thy sacred paths, (O
Lord!) that my weak and staggering Feet may not falter in the way of thy
blessed Law, etc.

13. A happy Beginning, is one half of the Work; and a Ship unmoor'd from the
Harbor, with a favorable Gale, and ful-swoll'n Sails; seems rather to fly than
swim toward the intended Port: A Soul which has so well entered upon her Days
voyage, cannot but make a happy progress, following the same conduct of the
Holy Ghost, whose gracious Inspiration gave her this first good Motion: And it
ordinarily falls out with man's Heart, as with a Bowl, which continues rolling
along on the same side, on which he grounded it who first delivered it. If thy
Heart, O Christian! has begun in the Morning to turn upon Heavens side; it
will easily follow that Rut all the Day long; and though the Objects of
Creatures, the Variety of worldly Affairs, the Necesities of the Body, the
Occupations of each ones Charge, Office, and Condition, and the several
Accidents of the Active Life, will ly as Rubs in thy Way, to retard thy speedy
Course: yet they will not have the Power totally to stop thy tendency, nor
easily remove thee from thy well made Resolution. Thou will run through, by, or
over all thou meetst with; to meet with that desired Object which is thy prime
and principal Aim and Intention.

14. And now to set down a short and easy Method whereby thou may piously
Regulate the whole Days course upon all Occasions: having in the Morning made
these good Purposes, practice in the daytime these Six Points.

First, endeavor to observe exactly the formerly made Division of the Days
employments; executing each intended Action, at the Time, in the Manner, and
with such Conditions, Qualifications, Circumstances, as you foresaw and
premeditated the same: Yet, no with a Spirit of Servitude, which ties you to
run over by Rote some anciently used Exercises; falling into disquiet, when
some unforeseen Accident shall force you to deferr or interrupt your own
prefixed time and order: But with a free, peaceable, and pleasant Spirit, which
pursues the pre-intended Resolution, (as far forth as the intervenient
occassions will permit,) sweetly, re^ignedly, unconstrainedly. For, to oblige
ones self so strictly to any certain Method, as never to fail therein upon some
urgent Necessity; nor to leave it, without the loss of inward tranquillity: Is
to render ones self useless to his Neighbor, troublesome to himself, tiresome
to all Company. But on the other side, to prescribe no Rule for your ordinary
Practice, is to live in perpetual Disorder, and to expose your self to all
sorts of hazards and Confusions.

Secondly, At the entrance upon each Action, (which is of mom^t,) remember and
renew that good purpose you formerly made of Referring all to Gods honor and
glory. This may be don (as it were) in the twinkling of an Eye, by a secret,
sweet, and sudden Glance of the Soul toward her Sovereign good: and is so far
from over-busying the Spirit; that it enables it with new activity, and
alacrity to execute what it has in hand. And this surely is one of the chief
Secrets in Spirituality, whereby a Soul, which knows the right use thereof and
practices accordingly,) shall be sure never to act any thing in vain, nor with
regret; but to undertake all things with Cheerfulness and turn all her Actions
to her Merit: Because that Labor, which proposes the Divine honor for its
End; can neither be excluded from Comfort in its Prosecution, nor deprived of a
Reward after its Performance.

Thirdly, Fall not so eagerly and ardently upon any Exterior Action, as to
have your Heart wholly fixed upon it. For, if the thing is Indifferent, this
Excess may make it Evil: if Good, it must be don with due Measure, Moderation,
Dirscetion: moreover, during the heat of this Violence and Vehemence, Passion
may step into Reasons place, and Evil may borrow the cloak and color of Good.

Fourthly, Examine all that occurs, before you give it entra^e into your
Interior; And if you find it evidently Evil, and opposite to Gods Law and Love;
presently and without dispute, reject it, abandon it, abominate it: If you find
it Good, Lawful, Laudable; embrace it quietly, sweetly, peaceably: If you judge
it to be a matter Indifferent, behave your self also Indifferently, without
tying your self to it by Affection, or turning from it by Aversion; because
there may be danger in either, there of Excess, here of Incivility. In brief,
Use, Receive Refuse all things, according to their own real Nature, Worth, and
Merit: the Evil with Horror, the Good with Honor, the Doubtful with Dread,
the Indifferent with a discreet Freedom, All with Tranquillity of mind. And
this is a most useful and easy Rule, to pass the whole Day in Purity of Heart
and Peace of Conscience.

Fifthly, Return often into your Interior, by making frequent Reflections upon
your self, thereby to avoid your Enemies snares and surprisals. This is the
Exercise of Exercises, the Rule of Rules, without which all the rest will
little advantage you; and which alone (well practiced) contains All, and
consequently may serve instead of All: Neither is it uneasy to be by any one
every where practiced, without the least hindrance of Affairs, or hurt of
Conversation.

But because all our Good proceeds from God, The Sixth and last Point of this
Instruction, is to entertain your Thoughts continually with the feeling of his
sweet and powerful Presence in your Soul, by frequent and fervent Aspirations
and Jaculatory Prayers, either Vocal or Mental: Sometimes Invoking his Mercy;
other times Adoring his Majesty; now Thanking him, then Praising him; now
Complaining of your Misery, frailty, folly; then Admiring his goodness,
patience, longanimity; now being Sorrowful for your Sins, then making serious
Resolutions of amendment: Thus varying your inward Acts and Affections,
according to the diversity of Occasions, or to your Souls several Motions, or
to the Holy Ghosts Impulses and In-actions.

He who can sweetly pass over the Day in these pious Exercises, and have his
Soul fixed in Heaven, whilst his Body is tossed too and fro upon Earth; may
(Halcyon like) find a real Calm upon the raging Sea, enjoy a quiet Peace in
time of cruellest War; and remain unmoved amidst the greatest Tempests. Let
there be thy Heart, says St Augustine, and here will be Rest.

15. The Day thus happily sliding away, draws on the Night-Season; and there
remains yet an Evening Exercise in order to even your Accounts with the great
Father of the Family, concerning your days labor in his Vinyard. And if this
Self-Examination seemed a matter of much importance to mere Philosophers, (as
appears in their Writings;) who aimed only at the leading of a Moral, Discreet,
and Rational Life; how much more necessary is it for Christians, who are to
lead a Holy, Spiritual, Angelical, Divine Life? I say, [a Divine Life:] For
Christians are invited by their Profession, to imitate not only the Angels
Purity, but their Creators Perfection; who has proposed himself the Pattern as
well as the final End and Period of our earthly Pilgrimage: Be ye perfect, O
Christians (says our Savior in the Gospel) as your Heavenly Father is perfect.
The Apostle intimates this Duty, as generally belonging to all Christians, when
he says Let every one examine and prove his own works: And the Council of Trent
commands every one, To Examine himself seriously, and to sound the deepest
secrets, the most hidden folds, the darkest corners of his Soul and Conscience:
Which Precept though it obliges only such as present themselves to the
Sacrament of Penance; yet it may be also esteemed a Command of Council, as to
this daily Self-Discussion; a Council of great consequence and necessity, and
fit to be punctually followed by all Spiritual persons, who desire to discern
the true State and Condition of their own Interiours, to regulate their Lives
according to the Law of God and of Reason, to preserve themselves from
Blindness, Obduration, and those multitudes of dangerous Crimes, which
Self-negligence, carelessness, heedlesness infallibly draws upon them: A
Council, which all the holy Fathers have particularly recommended to their
Childrens practice; which all Gods Servants have carefully performed, (some
Twice, some Thrice, others Oftener, all Once a day;) and without which, it is
almost impossible for poor Man, (who is tossed too and fro, like Autumn leaves,
with the Winds of Inconstancy,) to persever long in his Virtuous enterprises,
Pious purposes, and holy Resolutions.

16. And to descend now to the particulars of this Evening Exercise. The First
thing you are to do (O devout Christian!) having recollected your self in some
place of retirement, Is to render humble and hearty Thanks to the Divine
Majesty for all Favors, Blessings and Benefits, bestowed on you generally in
your whole lifetime, and particularly that present Day: Benefits which his
boundless Goodness daily Renews by still continuing them. And how particularly
his Paternal Affection, Compassion, and Providence have appeared in your
behalf, even in the diverse Occasions and Dangers of this now past Day; your
Eyes (if they will only open) cannot but admiringly behold. Now, since he looks
for no other return for his Bounty, than a bare Gratitude, which will cost thee
Nothing; Will thou refuse, O Creature to thy Creator! Will thou deny, O
Christian to thy Redeemer! one daily Act of thy Memory, one daily Resentment of
thy Heart, one daily Acknowledgment of thy Tongue, for his daily continued Love
and Liberality.

In the next place, you are to beg Light to discern, and Aid to correct such
Crimes as you have that day committed. For how can you Hope without the help of
Heavenly Light, to perceive the many faults, excesses, omissions, which your
Frailty, your Rashness, your Indiscretion, your Proness to evil, your Perverse
customs, have drawn upon your Thoughts, your Desires, your Discourses, your
Actions, (amongst so many Objects, Occasions, Assaults;) either expressly
against his Divine Will and Precepts, or (at least) contrary to his Love and
Liking.

Thirdly, proceed to the particular Discussion of your Conscience, upon those
four Points, prescribed by St Bernard: [1.] How much have you advanced
forwards, or gone backwards in the way of Virtue and Perfection! [2.] What you
are in your Manners, what in your Affections? [3.] How like you are to your
Savior, how unlike. [4.] How nearly you are united to him, or how far distant
you are from him. Then reflect briefly upon the Companies, Discourses, Objects,
Affairs of the past Day; Considering what Passions, what Imperfections, what
Omissions, what Commissions, what expense of time, etc. And here the more
Spiritual persons may fitly make use of St. Leo's method: Let every Christian
(says he) sift and sound his Conscience, in this Manner: [1.] Whether the
Peace, profferr'd to all by our Savior, find's a Resting place in his Heart.
[2.] Whether any Carnal Concupisence impugn's the pious purposes of his Soul.
[3.] Whether he hates mean and humble things, and fancies sublime and high
matters. [4.] Whether the inordinate desire of Gain, or a Greediness of
increasing his temporal means, commodities, honors, worldly glory and esteem
transports him. [5.] Finally, whether hi^ Neighbors Prosperity provokes him to
Envy, or his Enemies Calamity excites him to Joy and gladness.

If in your Examination, you have taken notice of any Mortal Crime; Be sure to
confound your self presently in your Creators presence, by an humble
acknowledgment of your strange Malice, Ingratitude, Frailty: Look upon the
dismal, inexplicable, interminable torments of Hell, which you have deserved
even now at this very instant: Then praise and magnify the Divine Mercy, which
permitted not the Earth to swallow you, as Dathan and Abiron; or the Waves to
ingulph you, as Pharao with his Egyptian Army; or Fire to consume you as Sodom
and Gomorra; or his Sword to cut you off, as the rebellious crew in the
Wilderness; or his Breath to blast you with sudden Death, as Ananias and
Saphira; or some other Instrument of his severe Justice to revenge his Injury,
raze you from off the earths Surface, and cast you headlong into the place
which is only proper and therefore prepared to receive such ungrateful and
perverse Wretches; as diverse Others, who have been Death-struck in the very
height of their sinful fact, and hurried away to Hell, before they had
perfected their begun impiety.

And why is this favorable delay of the Divine Justice afforded you, (O
undeserving Wretch!) but to give you time to call upon his Mercy? Call
therefore, (Poor and miserable Criminal!) Call instantly upon the Divine
Clemency: Petition him presently for a Pardon: Purpose seriously to Correct,
speedily to Confess, willingly to Satisfy for your Transgression: And suffer
not, O Christian! suffer not any Mortal Sin, (which is not absolutely Renounced,
Revoked, Abjured, by a Retractation of your Will,) to harbor in your Heart, to
nestle in your Soul, and to sleep one whole Night with you in your Bosom. For
since you dread to admit a Serpent for your Bedfellow; how dare you sleep
securely, having this horrid Serpent, not with you, but within you; not in your
Bed, but in your Breast, to destroy your Soul by an eternal Death and
Damnation, if your sleeping Body should be surpised by a temporal Death and
Dissolution. And have not many Sinners been so served? Ah! my Friend! That
which happens to One, may happen to any One, and may justly be dreaded by every
One. In matters of such moment, where the loss (if it happens) is irreparable,
Precaution is necessary to prevent the Danger.

But this Act of Contrition must not have the Fear of your own eternal
Punishment, and the Dread of Hellfire, for its only Object: This is too mean a
Motive for your Sorrow, and unsufficient for your Salvation. You are to take
the rise of your Grief from a more glorious Origin, the Consideration of the
heavenly Felicity, whereof this Sin of yours has eternally deprived you,
unless your true and timely Repentance re-instates you. The Kingdom of Heaven
suffers Violence. Your Sorrow, O Sinner! must force your passage thither, and
your Sighs and Tears must make a Breach for your entrance. Neither must you yet
stay here, but soar higher than Heaven it self, elevating your afflicted
Spirit, even to the Throne of the Divine Majesty offended. Yes O penitent Soul!
The Divine Goodness offended is the only pure Motive, and ought to be the prime
Object of your Sorrow and Contrition. O my Father, (said the Repentant
Prodigal,) I have sinned against Heaven, and in your presence: He says not, I
am worthy of your Punishment, unworthy of your Inheritance; but I have offended
you, and injured your Goodness. The consideration of having offended his loving
Father, more lively pierces his Soul, than the fear of Punishment, or the loss
of his Portion.

To be sorry for our Sins, by reason of the incurred Punishment, is a Slaves
property: by reason of the lost reward, is the part of a Mercenary; by reason
of Gods Goodness, is a loving Child's Duty. The Slave shunns Blows; the
Mercenary seeks for Gain, the Child shows his Duty: The first is an act of
Constraint, the next of Covetousness, the last of Love. The Punishment is
indeed to be dreaded, and the Reward is to be desired, but Gods Love is chiefly
to be regarded. His Love should be man's only Motive, because Himself is the
only Object which deseru's all his Affection; the only Good which can replenish
his capacious Heart; the only worthy to draw us, and the only able to satisfy
us; the only Center whether we are to stear our Course, and the only End which
can terminate it. Finally, it is He only who is our All in All, our Perfection,
or Crown, our eternal Felicity.

Behold, (Devout Christians!) the true means, whereby you may be evermore ready
for the Time, which is always ready for you, and may steal upon you when you
least think of it, unless you daily think of it. God give us all his Grace, to
practice well these pious Instructions, and to husband wisely the precious Time
he lends us; that so the Time wherewith he threatens us, may not surprise us.

Your Time, (says he to you all his loving and beloved Children,) is always
ready; Death still attends at your doors, but where or when it will enter and
seize upon you, you know not. It is therefore your part to expect it every day
and in every place; and to make so good use of your Time here, as that you may
hereafter (through my assisting and proferr'd Grace,) come to the Eternity of
my promised and prepared Glory. To which lead and conduct us all, the eternally
Blessed Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

THE CHRISTIANS Daily Exercise aforesaid, Reduced into Practice.
With the Intermixture of many Useful Instructions and Directions.
. I.
1. The Exercise for the Morning.
HAving satisfied Nature with convenient and competent rest and sleep; remember
presently, upon your first awaking, to mark your self with the common and
mysterious badge of Christianity, saying, In the name of the Father, etc.

Then breath forth some brief Aspirations befitting that time, as,

IN the name of my crucified Lord Jesus, I will now arise: He bless me, keep
me, save me, protect me, and direct me, this day and evermore.

Illuminate my Eyes, O Lord! that I may not sleep in death; and that my Enemy
may never say, I have prevailed against him.

My Soul has desired thee in the night, O my Lord and my Love! and in the
morning I will watch after thee.

Arise, thou that sleep, (arise my dull and drowsy Soul!) and Christ will
enlighten thee.

To thee, (O my Lord!) do I lift up my Eyes, my Hands, my Heart, from this Bed,
where my Body has taken its nightly repose, toward thy Heaven, where my Soul
expects her eternal rest.

Here I am, but thither I aspire: This is only my Inn, that is my Habitation.

Unseel my Eyes (O my God!) which sleep has thus long closed: darkness lately
covered them, let thy divine grace now clear them.

Excite thy self (O my Soul!) from this drowsiness which depressed thee, break
these Fetters, and fly up freely toward thy Creator.

Thou have satisfied thy Bodies necessity, settle thy self now to thine own
Duty; which is, to contemplate and love thy sovereign good.

Look up to heaven, where thy servitude shall one day cease, and where thy
action shall still continue, without this tiring interruption, and troublesome
subjection to thy enslaving Body, which here ties thee to its corruption, and
compells thee to comply with that which retards thee, withholds thee,
overcharges thee.

And thou (my Body!) since thou have sufficiently reposed, rowse up thy self to
serve thy Mistress Soul, which during this long nights season, has desisted
from her own functions, to condescend to thy frailty.

Make her a return of thy civility, and employ all thy powers to obey her
precepts, as she has given way (by a cessation of all her faculties) to the
reparation of thy weakness.

Excite your self to a speedy and early rising, and habituate your Body, to get
the victory over sloth and sluggishness; by making use of some instance of
affection toward your loving Lord and Savior, as,

Thou summonst me (O my God!) by thy Angel, my Guardian, to appear before thee,
and to praise thy divine Majesty. I seem to hear thee sweetly calling me,
inviting me, expecting me; Arise my Love, my Dove, my Spouse, my Fair one, and
come: The night is past, the day is present cast off therefore all works of
darkness, and put on the armor of my light and love. And I most joyfully
answer thee, (O my loving Lord!) behold my heart is ready to love and praise
thee, this day and evermore.

Assure thy self, that the observation of this small (and seemingly
unnecessary) Rule, to wit, of rising early and speedily, will add great courage
and comfort to thy Soul, in the progress and practice of thy spiritual
Exercises: whereas on the contrary, you shall prove by experience, that a
little laziness in the Morning, leaves a certain lumpishness and tepedity in
your interior; whence it falls out, that your works of the whole day following,
want either fervor of affection, or purity of intention: Every small
temptation or contradiction overcomes you, discomposes you, and puts all out of
order.

You may here consider, 1. That whilst you were sleeping in your Bed, the
blessed Quires of Angels and Saints, were singing Gods praises in heaven.

2. That many poor Souls have passed the pangs and agonies of death, and
received their dreadful, doubtful, and eternal doom.

3. That many others have in this very night fallen into sundry mischiefs and
miseries; some pining away with hunger, others languishing in their sicknesses,
others perishing by fire, water, desolation, despair, etc.

From these Considerations, will arise several affections of love, admiration,
gratitude, etc.

Having thus entertained your Soul with these or such like pious thoughts, and
ardent ejaculations, from the time of your awaking, till you have clothed your
body with its garments, (as with its sackcloths of Penance;) you are to cast
your self devoutly on your knees before Christ crucified, sacrificing to him
your first fruits, by making briefly and devoutly these acts following, of
Adoration, Thanksgiving, Oblation, Protestation Petition.

1. I adore thee, O omnipotent Creator! from the very depth of my heart and
soul, as my sovereign and only Lord and Love; from whom I had my first
beginning, have my present being, and hope my future happiness.

2. I return all possible thanks to thy infinite goodness, for all thy gracious
blessings and benefits, bestowed on me, a most unworthy, undeserving, sinful
wretch.

3. I offer to thy divine Majesty, to supply my own indignity, the most dearly
beloved heart of Jesus, thy Son and my Savior, with all the merits of his
blessed life, and bitter passion, and whatsoever is grateful unto thee in
heaven and earth.

4. I protest and promise for the future, amendment of my life, reformation of
my manners, performance of my duty, and a more serious tendency to thy love and
service.

5. Grant unto me, I beseech thee, O my gracious Lord God! (and to all them
for whom I ought to pray;) wisdom to know thy holy will, and courage to execute
it: give me grace to avoid sin and scandal, and to work and walk uprightly in
thy presence, this day following, and all the days of my life.

Or, if your leisure permits, you may enlarge your self, and elevate your Soul
toward the glorious and incomprehensible Trinity; acknowledging your own
nothing, and adoring his infinite Essence, with the same feeling of his
presence, as his holy Prophet seemed to have, when he exclaimed,

O my dread Sovereign! all my substance and being, is a mere nothing before
thee.

Without thee I was nothing, and what I now am by thy power, I here annihilate
in thy presence, by an humble sense of my own meanness, and of thy greatness;
of my ignorance, and of thy wisdom; of my misery, and of thy mercy.

I came from nothing by thy gracious favor, and I return into my nothing, by
confessing what I should be without thy continual support, and by acknowledging
what I am by thy free liberality.

I adore thee, O prime, supreme, sovereign Being! O Being, upon which depend
all Beings! O Being, who art all things in thy self, without which all things
are nothing at all.

Being! in which, all that is, subsists; from which, all proceeds; by which,
all is maintained; for which, all labors; under which, all obeys; to which,
all relates; without which, all would perish.

I adore thee, O powerful Creator, and pious conserver of all things! in whom,
and by whom, the inanimate Creatures have being, the animate life, the
sensitive feeling, the rational understanding, the virtuous grace, the blessed
glory, the damned subsistency, the actual essence, the possible idea's: out of
whom, if there be any thing, it is only Sin, which has no being.

I adore thee, O my great, glorious, gracious Lord God! and humbly acknowledge
thy superiority, and my dependency; thy power, and my subjection; thy
immensity, and my littleness; thy all, and my nothing.

Then entering into a serious consideration, of the large benefits received from
his liberal hands, exclaiming with the same extasi'd Prophet,

What grateful acknowledgment shall I return to my Lord God, for so many great
signal favors which his love and liberality have showered down upon my head?

He created me, when I was nothing; he redeemed me, when I was lost; he
justifies me, when I am a sinner; he will crown me, when I continue just.

He has given me a being, restored me to a good being, offers me a gracious
being, prepares for me a glorious being.

He bestows on me his Image in my Creation, his Blood in my Redemption, his
Spirit in my Glorification.

And above all these benefits, he has given me his eternal love, which
prepared for me before all time, all these infinite favors; I loved thee (^
N.) in my eternal charity.

And is not the sight of so many benefits, (which are more, remarkable in my
own particular, than in diverse others) a sufficient motive to draw acts of
eternal praise and gratitude, from my affectionate heart and mouth, toward
thee, my gracious, glorious, bountiful Benefactor?

Wherefore (O my liberal Lord and Lover!) I here present thee with all the
thoughts of my understanding, all the affections of my will, all the acts of my
memory, all the motions of my appetite, all the idea's of my imagination, all
the desires of my heart, all the functions of my senses, all the faculties of
my soul: My very bones, marrow, and bowels, shall exclaim (after their fashion)
by an interior feeling of gratitude; Lord who is like thee, in greatness,
goodness, graciousness, love, and liberality?

Then reflecting upon your former ingratitude, frame a general act of
compunction and contrition.

But ah! ungrateful wretch that I am, how have I abused all these thy
benefits, blessings, and favors? how have I perverted the gifts of Nature,
mis-imploy'd the gifts of Fortune, rejected the proffered gifts of Grace,
contemned the promised gifts of Glory?

Casting here a glance upon the most grievous sins of your life past.

And oh! how deeply is my soul confounded at her strange disloyalty?

Then resolve courageously to amend all that is amiss, and to correspond better
to Gods grace for the future: and in particular, to employ the present day to
the divine honor, glory, and service, saying with the Psalmist,

My soul is prepared (O my Lord!) to perform its duty more faithfully for the
future: Direct (I beseech thee!) my thoughts, words and actions, thou who
disposest my heart: Enable me to do, thou who inspirest the desire.

Let this day, which begins with the invocation of thy sacred Name, pass on in
the observation of thy holy Law, and end with the benediction of thy gracious
favor.

After this general resolution of well employing the day, you are to propose to
your self in particular such principal actions, wherein you may probably be
that day engaged; ranking them in their several orders, and assigning to each
one its due time, proper place, and just measure.

I humbly offer up to thy sacred Majesty, all these actions, (and whatsoever
else the variety of humane affairs, and worldly accidents, may this day
produce) with a pure intention, to seek thy only honor and glory in their
performance, and committing the whole success to thy divine will and providence.

They who aim at higher perfection, are daily to employ their time, in the
practice of these two points. 1. Profound Humility. 2. Cordial, and continual
abnegation.


Questioning their souls thus:

O my soul! the Son of God, sweet JESUS, is dead for our love, and we die
shortly, and perchance this very day; let us then do something extraordinary
for our dear Saviors sake, and for the expiation of our sins. What shall we
leave, perform, reform, suffer, for his love and honor? wherein shall we
humble, deny, resign our selves?

You are to persuade and assure your self, that this present day is lent you,
to prepare and dispose your self in it, for the future day of Eternity, and
therefore resolving to make the right use thereof, say cordially with the Royal
Prophet,

Now I will begin; my time past is totally lost, and therefore this very day
and hour, I will begin to requite and recover all my former faults and follies,
by my future fervor and faithfulness.

In particular, I fully resolve and purpose,

1. To avoid such occasions of sin, curiosity, loss of time, etc.

2. To fight courageously against such a Temptation.

3. To mortify such a Passion or Imperfection.

Take courage, O my Soul! behold Jesus thy Lord and Love looks upon thee: it is
for Eternity thou labourest, and who would not cheerfully pass over these
moments of pain and trouble, to possess thee, O blessed Eternity!

O sweet Jesu! that every hour of my life, and every motion of my heart, might
praise thy sacred Majesty! O that every step I tread, might draw me nearer and
nearer unto thy Love!

After all your good resolutions, you must acknowledge they come from Gods
grace, and that the execution thereof, depends wholly upon his goodness: and
therefore you are humbly to offer him your heart, with all these holy desires
and designs, in beseeching his blessing upon them. And so,

Conclude this Morning Exercise, by imploring his powerful assistance for
their effectual performance, saying with the Prophet,

Keep my steps in thy paths, O Lord! that my weak, reeling, and staggering
feet, may not stumble, falter, and fall backwards from the way of thy blessed
Law and love.

Thy divine glory, is my desired Haven; let thy holy Will, be my way to it; let
thy grace, be my guide to it; let thy strength, be my support in it; let my
obedience, be my steps toward it.

Let me walk in thee, for thee, to thee: In thy Spirit, for thy Honor, to thy
Kingdom.

And if any stumbling block lies in my way, during the course of my
this-days-pilgrimage, remove it, (O merciful Creator!) with the powerful hand
of thy holy Providence; or cause it to serve, (not as an occasion to divert me,
or a snare to shackle me, or as a clog to retard me: but) as a spur to excite
my diligence, in the succeeding race of thy divine love and service. Give me
courage to run through, by, over, or under all that I meet with, that so I may
happily meet with thee the only intended, amiable, and desirable object of my
soul, for all time and eternity.

2. The Regulation of the Day.
Consisting in the practice of these six following Points.
1. THat you exactly observe the formerly made division of the days-hours:
exeeuting each intended action, at the time, in the manner, and with the
premeditated conditions and circumstances; yet not servilly tying your self to
any thing, but performing all with a free, pleasant and peaceable Spirit.

2. That you endeavor to renew your general intention, (of referring all to
Gods honor and glory) at the entrance into each particular action.

3. That you fall not so eagerly upon any exterior affair, as to have your
heart wholly fixed upon it, and your mind totally taken up with it.

4. That you examine all that occurrs you, before you give it a full entrance
into your interior: considering briefly, whether it be good, bad, or
indifferent, and so presently to embrace it, reject it, or behave your self
indifferently toward it.

5. That you return often into your heart, by self-reflection; to avoid your
enemies surprisals.

6. That you entertain your thoughts with the continual feeling of your
Creators sweet and powerful presence in your Soul, by making use of frequent
and fervent Aspirations, and Jaculatory Prayers, either Vocal, or Mental.

This last point, to wit, [The continual consideration of the divine presence]
is the Exercise of Exercises; and which being alone well practiced, is alone
sufficient to bring you to great purity and Perfection.

Let it therefore be your daily and hourly endeavor, to look always upon the
Divine Majesty, (as every where nearer to you, than you can be to your self)
and to aspire frequently and amorously to him (at least in heart, if not in
words) in this or some such manner; (as the several occa^ons, your own
affections, and the Holy Ghosts inspiration, shall suggest.)

O my God, and my All! O my Soul, where are we? what do we think of? who sees
us? how are we employed? why lose we our time, which is so precious? Jesu, I
crave thy pardon, and implore thy grace and mercy. O my Lord, grant me thy
love! O my Savior, sweeten my labors, etc.

And this you may briefly, sweetly, and most profitably practice, at all times,
in all places, employments, companies. But before you go abroad, you may thus
piously premeditate.

1. That many have passed out of their Houses in perfect health, and never
returned home alive: why may not the same befall you?

2. That your Conscience will be much quieter in the Evening, for having begun
well your Devotion in the Morning, and discharged well your duty in the
Daytime.

3. That to go forth into the world, is to meet many troubles, pass many
dangers, and perform many duties; therefore rush not rashly into it, without
recommending your self to God, and craving his blessing and assistance.

3. The Exercise for the Evening.
Having thus passed on the Day in these interior entertainments, and such
exterior employments as were suitable to your Calling;

Recollect your self, at a fit hour, and in a place convenient, in order to
your Evening Exercise: And begin it with an act of Thank^giving.

I Render thee most humble and hearty thanks, (O my gracious Benefactor!) for
all thy blessings and benefits, bestowed on me generally in my whole life time,
particularly in this present day.

O the multitudes of thy mercies and favors, conferred upon so poor and
sinful a creature, (who deserves nothing but to be utterly by thee forgotten
and forsaken;) in Nature, in Grace, upon my body, upon my soul!

Thou have given me (O my glorious Creator!) a rational being, and stamped it
with the sacred Image of thy Divinity! Thou have bestowed on me thy own
eternally blessed Son, to die for my sins, and left thy Sacraments for my
spiritual solace and sustenance! Thou sendest me thy inspirations to excite me,
command thy Angels to guard me, promisest thy Kingdom to encourage me!

Thou have thus long born with my negligences, impieties, impenitency! Thou
have hitherto withheld the Thunderbolts of thy Justice, hanging over my head;
shut up Hell's mouth, gaping under my feet; repressed the Devils rage, ready on
every side to devour me!

Thou have expected my Conversion with long patience, desired it with much
love, allured me to it with many sweetnesses, provoked me to it with frequent
summons, pressed me to it with fearful threatenings.

Thou have daily renewed all these thy divine benefits, by still continuing
them, even till this present and now passed day; in which thy paternal
affection, compassion, and providence, have most particularly showed themselves
in my behalf: All which my Eyes cannot choose but admiringly behold, and which
my heart does here most gratefully acknowledge! exclaiming with thy holy Prophet,

Praising, I will invoke thee, my Lord and my God! I praise thy bounty for the
already received benefits; I implore thy gracious favor for their future
continuance; and I invoke thy holy light, that I may see and know my former
ingratitude, negligence, disloyalty; that seeing and knowing them, I may
detest and deplore them; and by deploring them, may make some satisfaction to
thy divine Justice.

Then begging light, and confessing your own ignorance and blindness in
self-knowledg: say with the same Prophet,

Who is he, (O my Creator!) that can clearly conceive, and truly understand the
number and the enormity of his offenses? Give me a glimpse of thy heavenly
light, (O my gracious Lord!) that I may discern the manifold defects, excesses,
commissions, omissions, which my frailty, my rashness, my proneness to evil, my
perverse customs, have this Day drawn upon my thoughts, my desires, my
discourses, and my actions.

Then descend to a particular Discussion of your Conscience.

1. Reflecting briefly upon the Places, the Companies, the Occasions, the
Discourses, the Objects, the Affairs of the whole day.

2 Considering seriously, 1. What Passions have had greatest power over your
spirit. 2. What evil Customs have returned to tyrannize over your Nature. 3. To
what imperfections you have been most subject. 4. How you have performed your
Morning resolutions, of doing this, avoiding that. 5 How you have complied with
the Obligations which concern your special calling, charge, and condition.

3. Marking particularly, upon each one of these heads, your most notorious
Excesses, Omissions, Commissions, Negligences.

Then conceiving a general hatred, horror and detestation of all sin, say
briefly,

O my Soul! How ill have we employed our Time and Talent, lent us to merit
Eternity.

O my Lord and Maker! I am most heartily sorry for all these sins, defects, and
imperfections, which by thy divine grace and light I have now discovered and
discerned in my soul: and humbly implore thy merciful pardon, both for them
and all such others, as have escaped my memory.

But if in the Examination of your conscience, you there take notice of any
mortal Crime: Be sure to confound your self presently in your Creators
presence; Crying out in the bitterness of your Soul,

O my strange Frailty, Malice, Ingratitude! Whence is it that thou (my justly
irritated Creator!) commandedst not the Earth instantly to swallow me, or Fire
from Heaven to consume me, or thy exterminating Angel to cut me off?

Whence is it, that thou withheldst thy breath from blasting me, (in the very
height of my sinful action) with sudden death; or that thou sent'st not some
of thy instruments of Justice, to revenge this horrid injury, by razing me from
off the Earth's surface, and hurrying me headlong into the dismal,
inexplicable, interminable torments of Hell; being the place, which is only
proper (and therefore prepared) to receive such ungrateful, ungracious, and
perverse wretches.

And why is this favorable delay of thy divine Justice, afforded me, (O my
patient and compassionate Lord God!) but only to give me time to recall my self
from my wickedness, and to call upon thy Mercy and Goodness?

Behold, (O my Creator!) I call, I cry, I come to thee, as a poor, wretched,
miserable Criminal! I call to thee for Pity, I cry to thee for Mercy, I come to
thee for Pardon: And I resolve, purpose, and promise, (by the assistance of thy
Grace) seriously to correct, speedily to confess, and willingly to satisfy for
what is amiss in me.

And this not for fear of Hellfire, which I have deserved; not for the loss of
Heaven, which I have forfeited: but for the love of thee, (my Lord God!) whom I
have offended. I acknowledge my self worthy of thy Punishment, unworthy of thy
Inheritance; but that which chiefly grieves me, is the having injured thy
Goodness: The consideration of having offended thee, (my loving Father!) more
lively pierces my soul, than the apprehension of my sufferings, or the loss of
my Child's portion.

Wherefore, even for thy own sake, (O compassionate Father!) pity, relieve, and
receive thy poor repenting, and returning Prodigal: who even for thy own and
only sake, heartily detests all his sins, sincerely promises his amendment, and
humbly craves thy pardon.

They who have more time and leisure, (and who desire to become more truly
spiritual) may here, before they betake themselves to their rest, make these
five internal and affectionate acts.

1. A Spiritual uncloathing of our Souls.
REturn securely (O my Soul!) into thy place of rest! Repose sweetly, quietly,
confidently in the bosom of the divine Bounty! Rely entirely upon thy Lords
love and mercy! And cutting off all cares and curiosities, all fears and
desires remain here contentedly; without diverting thy self with any other
Objects.

Behold, O my Lord and Lover! I absolutely renounce all but thee, humbly
casting my self into the arms of thy most holy Disposition, Providence and
Protection.

I will henceforth aim at nothing but the advancement of thy Honor, the
accomplishment of thy Will, the increase of thy Love, and an Union with thy
self.

O how truly happy would thou be, (my yet unmortifi'd Soul!) were thy
Affections once free, and not clasped to any Creature? that thou could
readily, resolutely, resignedly throw off all; and take the naked Cross for thy
total Inheritance!

Thou (O my loving Lord Jesu!) were born naked in a Stable, diedst naked on a
Cross, were put naked into thy doleful Mothers arms, to be first bathed in her
Tears, and then buried naked in another Sepulcher: and shall not my Heart and
Soul burn with love of external and internal Nakedness?

Live my Lord Jesus! deprived of Father and Mother, on the Cross: Live Mary,
deprived of thy only Son, at the foot of the Cross: Live naked Cross, and live
this holy Nakedness; Live my Beloved to me, and I to him.

Uncloath me therefore, (O Jesu!) 1. Of all sin. 2. Of all affection to sin. 3.
Of all curiosity and vanity. 4 Of all sensuality. 5. Of all inordinate passion.
6. Of all self-complacency, self-judgment, self-love, self-will. 7. Of my whole
self, and whatsoever is displeasing to the pure eyes of thy divine Majesty.

2. A most profound Humiliation of our Souls.
O My Sovereign Creator! I most heartily acknowledge my own baseness, misery,
weakness, wickedness, nothing I perfectly hate, dislike, and loath my self, and
all my own proceedings.

Behold me, (O Lord!) lying here prostrate at thy feet, as a poor Publican, not
worthy to lift my Eyes toward Heaven, or to take thy sacred Name into my
sinful mouth!

But what more can I do, (O my Maker!) than offer up to thy Majesty an humble
and contrite heart, fully prepared to suffer what thou shall please to command
it: And lo, I present my whole self, bound hand and foot, before the Throne of
thy Mercy, to be adjudg'd according to thy Will.

Lord! I fly not from thee; I appeal not from thy Sentence; I pretend no
privilege; I plead no excuse.

Be thou the Knife, and I the Flesh: Hack and hew me, cut me and crucify me as
thou please: Only pardon my sins; Let me live in thy service; Die in thy
favor; and Enjoy thy Love for all Eternity.

3. A recommendation and resignation of all, to the divine Majesty.
INto thy holy hands, (O heavenly Father!) I recommend my Spirit, my Memory, my
Will, my Understanding, my Senses, my Actions, all that I have and am.

I cast all at thy sacred feet; employ them all as best likes thee, that by
them all thou may be praised, served and loved, purely, perfectly,
perpetually.

I entirely resign my self, and all to thy most sacred Will, in life and in
death, for time and for Eternity. And will resolutely, cheerfully, and
affectionately, say and sing at all times, in all places, upon all occasions,
Our Lords Name be ever praised, his honor always promoted, his Will eternally
performed, by me, and by all his Creatures.

4. A hope and confidence, that God whom we Love, and who Loves us; will
effect what is best for us.
BEhold, (O Heavenly Father!) I here place my self under the wings of thy
paternal protection, by an immutable Act of filial Confidence and faithful
Affection; humbly committing all that any way concerns me, to thy most holy
Providence.

In this Center (O my Creator!) I will irrevocably fix my Heart and Hope:
making it my sole employment (during this my lives Pilgrimage) to please,
praise, and love thee; and not doubting but thou will provide for me, preserve
me, perfect me, and (at thy own appointed time) bring me to thy perpetual bliss
and felicity.

In this Act of Love, Hope and Confidence, I will securely sleep, expire, and
die the death of Love: living no more to my self, for my self, in my self; but
thou (my loving Lord!) living within me: leaving to thee all care of my self;
and not Fearing what can befall me, in all future time and eternity.

5. A Divine Sleep of Contemplation.
ANd now composing my Body to sleep, my Heart shall remain awaked to thee, (my
Lord and Lover!) Though my Understanding remains vacant from all discourse and
image; my Will shall be still working, watching, and melting away in Acts of
Love to thy divine Majesty.

O sweet and secure sleep! O sincere and solid repose! O pure and perfect
pleasure! O the difference, between this spiritual and all fleshly contents!
How great (O Lord!) is the multitude of thy sweetness, which thou have laid up
in store, for all such as truly love and faithfully serve thee!

O Lights! O Delights! O Ecstasies of Spirit! O sweet Spouse of my soul! Wound
me, Burn me, Consume me, Annihilate me in the abyssal depths of thy divine Love
and Union.

Then put off your Garments with all modesty and civility: being never without
some pious thought in your heart, or some Jaculatory prayer in your mouth: As,

O Savior! how barbarously were thou unclothed, to be nailed naked to the
Cross?

Uncloath my soul, (sweet Jesu!) of all its evil habits, and idle affections,
etc.

Composing your self in your Bed, you may say or think thus:

This Bed, may perhaps be my Grave, this sleep my Death, and my next Uprising
may be my Summons to the Sovereign Judges terrible Tribunal: O dear Savior!
dispose of me at thy pleasure for time and eternity.

Endeavor to take your Sleep (which is a natural action) with a Spirit of
Devotion: so making meritorious each minute of time, (whereof Sleep seems to
rob you) by loving God with your Soul, even whilst your Body has no use of
Sense, (either Actually, by breathing forth affectionate Aspirations as often as
you awake, or Vertually, by the vigor of your now well made Intention:) And
thus you may say with the Spouse in the Canticles; I s^p, but my heart watches.

Then quietly shut your Eyes, and fall asleep, upon some good Cogitation, or
pious Affection: (For the last thought at Night, occurs commonly first in the
Morning;) saying with Jesus on the Cross,

Into thy hands, (O heavenly Father!) I commend my Spirit.

If sleep seizes not presently upon you, say three Pater-nosters and Aves: The
first, for the faithful departed; The second, for the now sick and agonizing;
The third, for all your enemies: Which are Three Spiritual Alms-deeds.

. II. Directions for Prayer and Meditation.
THey who aim at the perfection of Virtue, and mean to make a solid progress in
Spirituality, must (besides the Morning and Evening Exercises before
prescribed) daily, duly, and perseverantly apply themselves to Prayer at fit
and set times; and never omit it upon any pretext whatsoever, as far forth as
Obedience, Charity, and Discretion will permit.

There are four sorts of Prayer; Vocal, Mental, Aspirations, Transcendent.
1. VOcal Prayer, is the most imperfect of all, as having the least share of
Spiritual light. Yet it is the most proper for Beginners, till the Soul becomes
more internal: And it is to be performed (especially when it is of obligation)
punctually, leisurely, distinctly, devoutly.

Be sure to make a good choice of your Vocal Exercises: preferring those before
all others, which excite you to most Devotion, and which afford the sweetest
relish to your Souls appetite.

2. MEntal Prayer, consists of three parts; Preparation, Meditation, Conclusion.

Preparation has three Acts:

The first is, a Lively, Humble and Amorous apprehension of Gods Presence, who
is with you, within you, your Life, your Love, your All.

The second is, Purity of Intention; protesting you come to Prayer, only to
praise, please, and honor the divine Majesty: and happen what will, that you
will do, as far forth as his powerful Grace shall enable your weak endeavors.

The third is Invocation, by which you heartily beg light from the Father of
lights; humbly acknowledge your own Nothing; and entirely abandon your self into
Gods holy hands in all things whatsoever.

Meditation has also three Acts.

Consideration, or a quiet search into the matter proposed, that you may win
your will to God.

Affections and Desires, to do this, leave that, love God, hate vice, etc.

Resolutions, firm purposes, and protestations, to practice as your Will is
inclined, as your Understanding is convinced, and as your Soul is now inspired.

Conclusion has likewise three Acts.

Thanksgiving for all Gods benefits in general and particular: especially for
the grace he has now given you.

Petition, craving that by your Creators mercy, your Redeemers merits, and the
Saints mediation, all your Defects may be pardoned, your Wants supplied, your
Wounds cured, your Wishes accomplished: and imploring a special assistance for
the putting in execution of your now made Resolutions.

Oblation of your self, body, soul, present prayer, all, to the divine Majesty.

3. PRayer of Aspirations, or Jaculatory Prayers, are short, sweet, frequent
and fervent desires, requests, elevations, and affections of the Soul to God.

These are of several sorts: and may be made either in the Heart only; or by
the Heart and Mouth jointly.

Of this sort of Prayer; see more in our Spiritual Conquest.

4. THe last, purest, perfectest, and highest manner of Prayer, is made only by
a certain adhesion of the devout Soul to the divine Will, without any Vocal
expressions, Mental discourses, or any Images whatsoever: But by a simple,
general, obscure light of Faith, and a Fervent, Attentive, Intensive motion and
Union of Love.

Of this Prayer, See also our Spiritual Conquest.

A way to Meditate upon any Virtue, or Vice.
1. AFter a lively apprehension of the divine Presence, an humble
acknowledgment of your own unworthiness, and a rectifying of your intention, as
above: Ponder, wherein the Virtue you desire, or the Vice you derest, does
really consist.

2. What need you have to get this, and to root out that? How happily you
should live, could you obtain it? What you lose by not having it?

3. What did your blessed Savior teach and practice; What our blessed Lady, or
such a Saint? What says [your Rule, or] your Conscience, or what is your
Obligation touching this matter?

4. Now what means are there to purchase it? What are the occasions which
nourish this Vice, this Passion, this Imperfection: and hinder this Virtue or
Perfection? What Remedies? What Practice?

5. Then purpose and resolve upon them courageously and confidently: not
doubting but that in due time you shall taste the fruits of your faithful
labors and diligence, etc.

And to persuade your Soul to what you intend, you may add these affective.
Considerations.

1. If my sweet Savior were now personally present, and asked what I should do
in such a case, what Counsel would he give me? I will attentively listen to his
words, cordially answer his Inspirations, and effectually follow his Directions.

2. If some dear friend should demand my advice in this matter, What would I
answer him? My soul shall relish now the same Food, which it would then chew
for another.

3. Why was I Created and Redeemed? Called to Gods faith and service? Why have
I time still lent me? I will be an Impartial Judge; Condemn, Punish, Resolve,
Amen.

4. What does most trouble and hinder my holy Design? This inordinate
affection, this creature, this pleasure, this thing, which withholds me from my
God; Is it better than he is? More worthy to be loved? More beneficial to me?
Shall my soul be ever satisfied or quieted with it! At the hour of my death,
will it plead for me or protect me from my Creators wrath and judgment? Is it
capable to make me now Holy, or eternally Happy? If not; what a strange
Blindness, and Madness is it, for me to leave God and adhere to it? Resolve
accordingly.

General Rules to be observed in all Prayer.
In all your practices of Prayer, and duties of Devotion, Let these general
Rules be carefully and constantly observed:

1. BEgin your Prayers with quietness and liberty of Spirit: that is, endeavor
to have your heart disinteressed from all business and all creatures: Thinking
whither you go, and what to do.

2. Be sure to bring with you to Prayer, either in Book, or Mind, these two
things: 1. The points, or at least the ground work of your Prayer or
Meditation. 2. What you intend to obtain this Prayer.

3. In the progress of your Prayer, be careful to avoid these two Extremities:

1. An indiscreet tying and bending your Brain and Mind to Attention. 2. A
negligent giving of liberty to wandering imaginations.

4. If you find your Heart troubled, confounded or dispersed; Reduce it
sweetly, and encourage it to talk, with its only Lord and Love about the
important affairs of Eternity: Thus quietly checking your self, and recalling
your imagination: Where are we? What do we? Whom seek we? God, Angels, Saints
are present; and am I not present to my self?

5. When your darknrss, dryness, dullness, temptations, or distractions, will
permit you to do (as it were) nothing in Prayer: You are not therefore to be
dismayed, or desist from keeping on in your course at set and ordinary seasons:
But call to mind these three points with faithful diligence, resignation, and
indifferency.

First, what was your intention in now coming to your Prayers; and fall
presently to the practice thereof.

Secondly, assure your self, That to suffer for God being absent, and to enjoy
him being present, are of equal Perfection: And one of these you may always do,
by-being to either of them indifferent.

Thirdly, That you came to your Prayers for two ends;

1. To Adore your divine Maker, To cast your self at his feet, To be disposed
of at his pleasure, To know his holy Will, To receive his sacred Commands.

2. To lay open to him your Wants, To discover to him your Wounds, To present
to him your Petitions; to seek relief, receive redress, beg an Alms. Now the
first of these Ends, (which is Noblest and Purest) is always in your own power
to perform; and therefore That alone gives a sufficient value and merit to your
Devotions.

A Direction of our intention, at the beginning of our Devotions.
OPen my mouth (O my Lord and Maker!) to bless and praise thy divine Majesty:
Cleanse my heart from all curious, noxious, and distractive thoughts: Enlighten
my understanding, recollect my memory, inflame my will, purify my intention,
settle my attention, excite my devotion, elevate my affection, curb and compose
all my interior and exterior senses:

That I may worthily, reverently, and religiously, perform this Morning
[Evening] Sacrifice of Prayer, and that in union and virtue of those most pure
and perfect Prayers and Praises, which thou (O Jesu my Redeemer!) living upon
Earth, offeredst up to thy Eternal Father; Mine may be now acceptable in thy
fight, profitable to the Living and Dead, and Honorable to thee and thy Saints.

At the end of our Devotions.
REceive (O merciful Creator!) this my Morning [Evening] Sacrifice; which I
have offered up and intended to the Glory of thy Name, the Honor of thy
Saints, the Good of my own Soul, the Reduction of all sinners, and the benefit
of all the faithful, living and departed.

Accept (O pious Father!) my poor endeavors; Pardon (O merciful Redeemer!) all
my Defects and Negligences: Give me, (O good Holy Ghost!) efficacious Grace, to
put in due practice my now made purposes and resolutions.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; (For the
benefits of my Creation, Redemption, Sanctification:) As it was in the
beginning, (when the Morning Stars praised thee,) Is now, (in the Church
Militant,) And shall be world without end, (in the Church Triumphant.) Amen.

. III. Practical Exercises, (dilated with Acts, Affections, and Elevations)
upon the chief Christian Virtues.
The First Exercise. Of Virtue in General.
Divided into seven Points.
1. A generous Resolution to practice all Virtues.
BEhold, (O sacred and undivided Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!) an
unworthy, wretched, weak, and wounded Soul, groaning under the burden of her
own abyssal misery, terrified with the consideration of thy inscrutable
judgments, confounded at the memory of her former sin, sensuality, disloyalty
and ingratitude, all covered with shame, and encompassed with sorrow, humbly
prostrates her self before the Throne of thy dread Majesty, and presents her
petition to thy infinite Mercy.

Thou have been pleased, (O benign and bountiful Lord and Lover! whose mercy is
above all thy wonderful works) to expect her hitherto most patiently: How long
shall I suffer you? Thou have most piercingly enticed her: Why will you perish?
As I live, I desire not the death of a sinner.

Thou have most piously invited her: Come to me, all you that labor and are
laden, and I will receive you, release you, relieve you, revive you. Thou have
efficaciously touched and terrified her with thy threats: Sin no more, lest a
worse thing befall thee. Thou have powerfully drawn her with thy promises: No
eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor heart conceived, what I have prepared for
them that love me. Thou have confirmed her in a lively Confidence of thy
goodness: It is I, fear nothing. And finally, Thou (O my all merciful Lord
God!) have put Contrition into my heart, Confession into my mouth, Satisfaction
into my hands, and unfeigned Resolutions of a total reformation into my whole
man: This is the change of thy right hand, (O powerful Creator!) the great and
glorious gift of thy grace, and the effect of thy only goodness; and to thee
therefore alone be ascribed all honor and praise for evermore.

My (now unfettered) Soul aims at a higher flight; she is become by thy
blessing more sensible of these thy benefits, and more zealous of her own good;
and therefore covets a nearer conjunction with thy self, her beloved object:
Ah! Who will give her the wings of a Dove, that she may strongly soar up to
thee, her amiable Sovereign; and sweetly rest in thee, her only satisfying
Center?

But alas! What am I, what have I, what can I do, O my Lord, my life, my love?
where is my courage to set upon so high an enterprise, and what is my strength
to atchieve it? The evil habitudes of all sin and sensuality, have yet an
over-swaying power in my weak Soul: Her long continued customs of vice and
extroversion, lie still as lurking Sentinels to stop her free passage into her
own interior: the usual Objects of her outward senses, busy and blind her
inward eyes, and divert her from beholding Virtues beauty, from considering her
own natural excellency, and from contemplating thy infinite bounty.

Break all these strong bonds for me, O all-powerful Lord God! And let the fame
grace and goodness, which has so forcibly destroyed the root of sin, and
dispossessed Satan of his empire in my heart, implant it now with solid
virtues, and re-invest thou in thy own just heritage and habitation. Let my
heart, soul, senses, and whole man, (all which have been formerly Dens of
Thieves, Deluges of all impiety, and Receptacles of all vices) become new
Paradises of all Perfections, and Gardens of Delights, wherein thou (my Lord
and Lover) may henceforth take thy true pleasure and content.

2. Virtue, is a Habit in the Soul, inclining her to produce actions suitable
to her rational Nature. She excites her self to shake off sinful Habits; and
resolves to set upon virtuous Actions.
AH my noble Soul! how glorious is thy natural being, how great thy dignity?
Thy Reason resembles thee to the sacred Deity, beautifies thee above all
sublunary entities, puts a Scepter into thy hand, a Crown on thy head, and
consecrates thee King of all inferior Creatures: And is it possible, that
thou, (O amiable, active, penetrating, and perfect Spirit) should be so
strangely wanting to thy self in this one only thing, (which is of all things
only necessary) as to be unknowing in the sacred Science of true life; and
ignorantly blind, or brutishly negligent of thy own eternal happiness and
salvation?

Arise, my immortal portion! Erect thy self into thy own Royal prerogatives;
Weigh thy own worth, Regain thy lost liberty; be no longer slavishly subject to
Satan, Sin, and Sensuality: shake off all these shackles of evil customs,
vicious inclinations, and bestial affections; and set upon actions more noble,
and nearer thy own rational nature. O be no longer the only monster amongst
creatures, by wilfully deflecting, basely degenerating from the fair order of
thy great Creator: but be now at length as desirous and diligent to acquire
such virtuous habitudes which are answerable to thy excellency; as thou were
formerly ready to follow all unreasonable and unproportionable impurities.

Yes, (O my Lord, and Lover!) I will quit all evil customs, and inure my self
to such pious employments, as may restore virtuous habits in my Soul, that it
may become agreeable to the eyes of thy divine purity: I will endeavor to
forget and forgo what I hitherto have been; vicious, wicked animal; and become
henceforth a new man; religious, virtuous, rational. This is fully resolved on,
O my Savior, and faithfully promised: Support my frailty, (O my only
encourager and comforter!) with the efficacious force of thy grace, and
powerfully drive on my holy designs to a happy execution.

3. The high Privileges of Virtue; how much it is to be prized; and that it
consists in a Mean.
O Amiable Virtue! It both grieves me and shames me that my deceived foul, has
been so long a stranger to thy true sweetness! What marvail, if I have hitherto
lived (or rather languished) as one disagreeable to my God, unprofitable to my
Neighbors, unpleasant to my Self, and a prey to my insulting Enemies; since I
have been destitute of Virtue, which can only free me from evils, afford me
happiness, make me Master of my appetites, Lord of my actions, and Conqueror of
my adversaries?

How highly will I henceforth prize thee, (O precious Jewel!) how earnestly do
I desire to obtain thee, and how diligently will I endeavor to purchase thee,
since thou powerfully guidest me to my own good, and smoothest the path leading
to the sovereign end and perfection, for which I was created. Ah my poor soul!
what more would thou wish in this life, than to be good and perfect, what
more in the next, than to be eternally happy? both these, Virtue abundantly
bestows on thee. Take therefore your full carriere, (O seduced Worldlings) in
following your unsatiable fancies, your untamed passions, your painted
pleasures, your petty vanities, your uncontenting curiosities: Behold, I here
freely and willingly quit all my interest in them; nor will I now have any
farther solicitude than to follow Virtue, to study Virtue, to learn to express
this lovely Virtue, in all the actions of my life and conversation.

O my Soul! that this golden Mean, were the just measure of all thy actions! O
that thou could ever tread in the middle track of Virtue, and never stray
upon the right or left hand, into the vicious extremities! O true and straight
way leading undoubtedly to my blessed eternity! how few do find thee? and yet
fewer, alas! are they which follow thee.

Thou (O sweet Savior of the world!) who ever lovedst the middle; who in the
Sacred Trinity, middlest the divine Persons; in the Stable, art amidst the
Beast; in the Temple, amidst the Doctors; on the Cross, amidst the Thieves;
after thy Resurrection, amidst thy Disciples; Give grace and discretion to thy
poor Servant, to lay hold on the happy Mean in all my Actions, which so highly
pleases thy Heavenly Majesty. Let me neither Rejoice excessively, nor Grieve
unreasonably: neither Speak rashly, nor be sullenly Silent; neither Act or Omit
any thing whatsoever, but according to due order and measure. Give me, O
bountiful bestower of all good things, a solid Faith, unblemished with Atheism,
and void of Superstition; a lively Hope, without Presumption or Despair; a
perfect Charity, free from too much Coldness, or an over-heat of Zeal; Give me
Wisdom, not touched with Negligence or Craftiness; Justice, not tainted with
Partiality or Severity; Fortitude, exempt both from Rashness and Cowardice;
Liberality, devoid of Avarice, and Lavishness; Truth, disengaged from
Dissimulation and Arrogance; Clemency, far from the excess, either of Calmness,
or Choler; Temperance, secured between Immoderation and Insensibility;
Civility, neither absurd or offensive.

Teach me, (O eternal Wisdom, emanated from the Divine Bosom of the most high,
to show us mortals this middle way, as the direct means to make us here holy,
and eternally happy;) teach me this most necessary Lesson, how to observe this
sacred Mean, in all my practices of virtue and piety. How easily, alas! can I
be zealous, loving, liberal? But to be angry and sin not; to be loving and lust
not; to be liberal, when, where, why! O nice point! O difficult matter, to my
passionate and ignorant Soul! Instruct me, O most loving Master! refrain me
from all excess, retire me into this sweet mediocrity, reform my old man with
his vicious habitudes, renew me to virtue, revest me with thy love; that as a
new born Infant, I may appear innocent, purged, corrected, adorned, before the
eyes of thy infallible Judgment.

4. Virtues, in respect of their Origin, are either Acquired, (by our own
industry) or Infused, (by Gods free gift, goodness, and liberality:) The
Infused Virtues, are the seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost; which counterpoise the
seven Evils, dishonouring our Nature.
BEhold, I now put my Soul into thy Hand, (O merciful Creator!) as a razed
Table, in which there is yet nothing designed: For alas! I have lived thus
long, (I must needs confess it to my own confusion,) without laying out my
stock of Reason, (bestowed on me by thy bounty, to be improved to my own
perfection) upon the purchase of any one Moral Virtue: My time, (ay me!) has
hitherto been taken up in following Trifles; my natural talents and
perfections, buried and drowned in brutish Sensuality; my study has been
Vanity; my labor, Folly; my exercises, Sinful; and all my employments
generally Wicked.

To thee therefore, O liberal and loving Father, the free bestower of all
blessings! To thee, O divine Son, and sweet Savior of the World, the equal
fountain head of all goodness! To thee, O sacred Spirit, coequal Author and
dispenser of all graces! does my poor and empty soul make her most humble
addresses; desiring to be replenished with such supernatural gifts, graces,
virtues; as may not only enable her to act always according to reason; but also
readily to obey thy heavenly Motions, and follow the conduct of all thy holy
Inspirations.

Give me Wisdom, O my God! to know thy divine and Eternal Verities:
Understanding, to penetrate the secret mysteries of thy sacred Word: Prudence,
to assist and counsel me in all my undertakings: Force, to conquer all crosses,
and contemn all contradictions: Knowledge, to make the right use of creatures
and temporalities in order to thy honor, (O my Creator!) and my own eternal
happiness: Piety, to make me ever religious in thy presence: and Reverential
Fear, to enable me to walk in all my ways, as befits an humble servant and
slave before his high and dread Sovereign.

Grant (O most gracious Lord!) that I may prevent such poisonous evils, as
defile my actions, and brand my life with infamy, by the counter-remedies of
these sacred Antidotes.

Against Childishness of conversation, and employing my precious time and
talents in toys and trifles; Let Wisdoms gravity win me to noble, high, and
holy undertakings.

Against Brutality, which has hitherto fastened my deceived senses upon the
outward shows, and fair appearances of things: Let piercingness of
Understanding, light me to the penetrating view of their inward and real value,
to acknowledge thee, my Sovereign Creator, and thy sacred mysteries, hidden
under the veils of all thy Words, and each one of thy Creatures.

Against my Rashness and inconsideration: Let the assistance of solid Prudence
and Counsel, show the Worlds dangers, the deceits of Sensuality, and the snares
of Satan; that duly seeing and considering them, I may discreetly and timely
shun them.

Against my human Weakness, Want of courage, and Fainting in my holy
resolutions; shield me with divine Fortitude, and give me courage that I may
become a Conqueror.

Against my wonted Ignorance; Let true Knowledge keep me from being any longer
cousened: O let me so wisely discern the good from bad, that I may henceforth
frame a right judgment of all things, without error or fallacy.

Against all irreligious Profaness: give me a zealous sense of Piety toward
thee, my Lord God, and all sacred and celestial Mysteries.

Against sottish Security; bridle me with a holy and filial Fear, which may
continually alarm me to stand on my guard, amidst the imminent dangers of this
my Pilgrimage.

Give me, O pious Father, all these thy precious gifts, to assist me against
these pressing miseries, and to regulate my life, both in action and
contemplation: Give me Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge, to aid me in my
practices of Prayer, and Introversion; give me Prudence, Fortitude and Piety,
to stear my daily and ordinary actions; and give me thy sacred Fear, to further
me on in them both, with safety and security.

5. Virtues, in respect of their Subject, are either Intellectual and
Speculative, which enable our Understandings to know and approve Truths; or
Moral and Affective, which carry on our Wills, to embrace such objects as the
Understanding approves of. Virtues, in respect of their Object, are either
Theological, which have God for their prime Object and Motive; or Cardinal,
which furnish the means to come unto God.
LOrd! how far am I from these virtues? how necessary are they for me? and how
fervently does my Soul sigh after them? Thou have commanded me to ask, O meek
and merciful Savior! and promised me to grant: Thou have encouraged me to
seek, and assured me to find: I humbly ask, and heartily seek these necessary
gifts, graces, virtues; give me them, O my good God! fill up my Understanding
with the knowledge of such Truths, as may fix it upon thee, the eternal Verity;
and habituate my Will to embrace such objects, as may be in order to its happy
conjunction with thee, the only essential Goodness.

I acknowledge thee, (O most bountiful and powerful Lord God!) to be the sole
Author of these supernatural and Theological Gifts; from thee alone proceeds
their whole being, birth, growth, and strength; and to thee only I address my
humble Petition to purchase them. O how happy is that Soul whom thou teach,
instructest, and endowest with these prime, and fundamental Virtues? how
becomingly will she carry her self to thee-wards, (the amiable object of all
her desires) and how diligently will she embrace the means, which lead her to
thy love and friendship!

Grant me therefore (O my God!) the gift of pure Faith, to believe thee for
thine own sake, who art the revealer of all verities; a pious Hope, to trust in
thee for thy self, who give all succor and assistance; and a perfect
Charity, to love thee for thy very self, who art all amiable, and infinite in
thy perfections.

Grant me also, (O most merciful Maker!) the comfortable assistance of the
Cardinal Virtues, to forward these my tendances toward thee: Prudence and
Justice, to lead me into the right way; and Fortitude and Temperance, to level
the path, and put away all occurring obstacles, hindering me from thee, my Lord,
my Love, my Hope, my Happiness!

O amiable, admirable, and necessary Virtues! which way shall I cast about to
compass you? O my soul! why languishest thou? why sleep thou? arise, ask,
knock at the gate of Mercy, confidently, constantly, perseverantly; and thy
loving Lord w^ll give, grant, open, and make good his own gracious promises.
Ah! how poor are Worldlings pretenses? how low is their highest ambition? how
unsavory are the Earths best sweetnesses? It Is thou, O sweet Savior, who art
the only sovereign good of my soul, and the satisfying Center of all my
desires: O let me henceforth breath nothing but thee, and continually burst
forth into acts of these Theological Virtues, which immediately unite me unto
thee; and of the Cardinal Virtues, which are the necessary supports of my lives
pilgrimage, and the powerful instruments of my souls progress toward thy
heavenly Paradise.

6. Virtue deserves to be embraced, because it is profitable, pleasant,
honorable; But chiefly, because it makes us pleasing to God.
WHat is good (O Divine Virtue!) in comparison of thee, or what is not evil
without thee? Thou art the Milky-way of Heaven, by which our Souls climb up to
their designed happiness: Thou suppliest all our wants during this worlds
Pilgrimage, clothing thy happy possessors with Gods grace, nourishing them
with his heavenly comforts, placing them in the secure harbor of his
providence and protection, disengaging them from their enemies bondage, making
Death desirable, and Hell it self not dreadful. Ah! what profit can thou,
(my poor Soul!) extract from all created goods, equivalent to these great
prerogatives?

How much more excellent art thou, (O my immortal Spirit!) than the caitiff
clay which incageth thee? So much more worthy are Virtues pleasures, than
Sensual solaces; in Purity, in Dignity, in Permanency. Alas! are not all
worldly Joys to be gathered amongst Thorns and Thistles; and for one poor
Pleasure, art thou not left pierced with a thousand Pains and Fears? Are not
fleshly delights, suitable to Swine and Serpents? Are not ambitious plots, the
pleasures of Devils? and the contentments of the Covetous, are they not such as
Emmets and Moles delight in? Lastly, does not the whole world pass away, with
all its momentary pass-times and concupiscences; and is not Virtues delight
durable to the end?

Yes, (O sacred Virtue!) thou art desirable for thine own sake, honorable
before men, irreprehensible before God; thou comprehendest all sorts of goods,
Profitable, Delectable, Honest; thy charms are all divine, thy pleasures
permanent, thy profits unspeakable, thy honesty amiable, thy joy Angelical. And
are not these solid perfections, (O my Soul!) more beseeming thy purity, than
the worlds false, fading, vile, and vain fooleries?

Does not Prudence teach thee to prefer a greater good before the less, and
substances before shadows? does not Reason induce thee, Justice convince thee,
and thy own Nature press thee, to set a higher price upon truth than falsehood?
O, it is time to undeceive thy self! Thou have been too long, and too
passionately taken up with toys and trifles, been injurious to thy nature, and
foe to thine own perfection! Return, return, poor Soul, to thy pious Lord and
Lover, whose image thou bear; Let not unworthy objects bastardize thy love
any longer: Ah! will thou be still subject to Vices tyranny? ever hanker after
thine own ruin? lie perpetually plunged in misery, and drowned in
imperfection? be always a slave of sin and sensuality, and a perpetual prey to
the sworn enemies of thy salvation? and instead of leading an innocent and
Angelical life, will thou continue in the track of Beasts and Devils?

Ay me! miserable, wretched, deformed and counterfeit creature! who will free
me from this body of sin, which has so weakened and wounded my Soul? Thy Grace,
O merciful Savior, is only, and all-sufficient, to work this cure upon me
thine infirm patient, almost destroyed by my disordered concupiscences, born
and brought up amidst the snares and ambushes of present and powerful
pleasures, and habituated to yield to the urging inclinations of my vicious and
perverted nature; Lord! if thou will, thou can cure, comfort, and cleanse my
sick, sorrowful, and sinful Soul, and having dispossessed these Legions of
Diabolical Vices, adorn it with Divine Virtues, which are so proper to its
noble nature, and so pleasing to thy sacred Majesty.

O Virtue! in thy self most amiable, but far more excellent in respect of my
Lord and Lover, to whom thou art so highly agreeable! O when shall I possess
thee, that by thee I may perfectly please him? The infinity of thy Being, O
sovereign Creator! and the immensity of thy essential perfections, deserve and
demand of me thy poor creature, a rendition of all glory, reverence,
submission, praise, and dutiful practices of Religion, Piety, Virtue: Thy
supreme power requires all perfect obedience to thy sacred Ordinances: Thy
faithful performance of thy sweet promises, force me to a confidence in thy
goodness: Thy profuse liberality enticeth me to thy love: Thy incomparable
height moves me to profound annihilation, self-knowledg, humility: Thy severe
judgments induce me to be ever fearful of my self, and to do penance for my
sins: Finally, all thy greatnesses, glories, dignities, deserve more love,
land, loyalty, than my penury can ever hope to pay unto thy sacred Majesty.

O that I had millions of hearts to adore, admire, extol thy Divine bounty,
thy infinite excellencies, thy amiable perfections! O that I had a Soul
brim-full of all Virtues, that thou might be truly honored by me, sweetly
delighted in me, and perfectly served by me, who so infinitely and only
deservest it! In the mean space, I am resolved to love thee with all the power
of this poor soul, which thou (my bountiful Lord!) have bestowed upon me; I
will practice Virtues, that I may better please thee; I will refer all my
actions to thy only honor, not my interest; I will reflect on thee, and forget
my self; seek thy glory, not my own good: I will neither live nor love, act nor
omit any thing but for thee: who art the only end, aim, and center o fall my
doings and desires.

7. Virtue is obtained by continual Exercise: We must therefore lay hold on all
Occasions, and make it the End of all our endeavors. Three necessary
Dispositions.
O God of all Virtues! who have been pleased to dilate my heart by the infusion
of these sacred desires; divert my soul, I beseech thee, henceforth from all
superfluous employments; make her attentive to prayer, addicted to piety,
enamoured with Virtues beauty, faithful in the practice of such Acts, as may
finally put me into the full possession of this rich treasure, and holy
habitude, which so highly adorns and perfects me.

O my Soul! shall worldlings be more diligent to better their talents, more
indefatigable to augment their possessions, than thou art to obtain Virtue,
which can only make thee holy and happy? O rowse up thy self; lay hold on all
occasions; lose no longer thy time, which thy loving Lord lends thee for this
purpose; leave off these simple and superfluous cares, toys, and trifles, which
are totally useless to thy happiness; and fall upon heroic, honorable,
Virtuous employments: Thou can embrace no counsel more prudently, nor follow
any practice more profitably.

O sacred science af Virtue! be thou henceforth the ordinary entertainment of
my thoughts, the matter of my meditations, the end of my endeavors; I will
employ my time and talent in studying thy essence, excellency, effects,
motives, and what else concerns thee, that I may sincerely affect thee,
seriously seek thee, happily lay hold on thee, and resolutely practice thee: I
will perseverantly fight against perverse nature, quel concupiscence, cut off
curiosity, repress vice, and reiterate these acts, till they induce the
contrary habits of all Virtues, into my conquering Soul.

O Jesu! perfect exemplar of all sanctity; who art graciously pleased to afford
courage to weaklings, to confound the strong:

1. Give me a noble Generosity to set on Virtue; that I may with vigor,
alacrity, and promptitude, vanquish all sloth and negligence.

2. Give me a discreet Severity to set on my self; that the caitiff pleasures
of flesh and blood, make me not relent in my labors.

3. Give me a meek Benigntty and sweetness of heart, that I may peaceably,
patiently, and joyfully, pass over all difficulties, remain always solaced and
satisfied with thy good pleasure, and permission, and persevere constantly in
these my pious practices and resolutions.

The Second Exercise. Of the Theological Virtues, and first of Faith.
1. The Essence of Faith.
Faith is a Theological Virtue, elevating and enabling our souls to an assured
(though obscure) knowledge of all such things as are revealed by God.
PRostrate again, and humbled even into the center of my own nothing, I
represent my self before thy supreme Majesty; (O dread Sovereign of heaven and
earth!)

I acknowledge, (O prime, infallible, and only essential verity!) that the Just
man lives by Faith; that by it only I can have access unto thy sacred Majesty;
and that without it, it is not only vain to pretend, but altogether impossible
to please thee.

I believe, O my Lord, that Faith is the first step of my Pilgrimage toward
heaven; the necessary foundation whereupon I must raise the high edifice of my
desired perfection; and the very substance and support of all my hope of future
happiness in thy blessed eternity.

I also most gratefully confess, that Faith is a gratuite gift of thy mere
mercy, and gracious bounty; which alone moved thee to infuse it into my
undeserving soul in Baptism, O love! O liberality!

But, ah my unfaithfulness! how poorly have I performed my then made public
promise and profession? Alas, my disloyal Soul! Thou have not lived according
to Faith's Laws; thou have little loved thy Lord, less thy Neighbor, and least
of all thine own self: Thou have scarcely dreaded thy supreme Creator as thy
severe Judge, much less honored, served, and obeyed him as thy sweet Father.
Thy Faith has been hitherto dead, and thy barren tree has not yet budded
forth into blossoms, nor born any fruit of good works.

O pious and potent Lord! Curse not presently this fruitless fig tree, lest it
forthwith wither away into nothing! O cut me not yet off, nor cast me suddenly
into the fire, as I have most justly deserved, for having thus long possessed a
place in thy Garden, without any return of profit to thee my heavenly Planter!
O spare me one year longer, (Divine Husbandman!) digg about me, and refresh my
dryness with the sweet streams of thy infinite mercy, that I may spring forth
into fruitful works, worthy my Faith and profession.

Quicken, renew, revive, (O bountiful Lord!) thine own gracious gift of Faith
in my Soul, which is dulled, deaded, and almost destroyed and choked up, with
the venomous weeds of my wilful sin and negligence! O give me a fresh supply
of celestial light and strength, enable my poor Soul to pour forth her self
here in thy Divine presence; receive thy now repenting and returning child,
pardon mercifully his past disloyalties; and graciously accept these hearty
protestations of his most sincere fidelity for the future.

I believe, (O eternal Truth!) I believe all that thy self have said in thy
sacred Scripture, and revealed to thy dear Spouse, the Catholic Church, as
most sure and certain verities. Yes Lord; thy words are indubitable, thy Church
is infallible; and I will sooner believe my self not to live, than to suspect
thy Prophets, Apostles, or their Successors in thy Church, (by whose mouths
thou speak) to be Authors of the least falsehood.

I will therefore expect no greater evidence in this life, in these secret and
sacred mysteries of Faith, than thy Divine Revelation, and thy holy Churches
assertion. Ah, my soul! how well is it for thee, that thou art incapable to
Dive into the Counsels of the Divinity? What were the merit of thy Faith, if
thine own reason could yield thee an infallible certainty? To clear it, alas!
were to ruin it; to draw the curtain which obscures it, were to bereave it of
its most convenient clothing; to examine it too punctually, were to distrust
thy God too peremptorily: wherefore my Soul does humbly and heartily sacrifice
to thee her Sovereign Creator, the noblest faculty wherewith thou have endowed
her, which is, her Understanding: She willingly submits it (by an absolute
captivity and blind obedience) to all thy Divine Decrees, Laws, and Ordinances,
without questioning how, or why: I receive all entirely, universally,
singularly, each sentence of Scripture, each sanction of the Church; without
the least exception, choice, reserve or distinction: I believe all, O Lord,
help my unbelief.

2. The Material Object of Faith.
God is the material object of our Faith; who has revealed all truths, which
are to be believed.
THou (O Eternal Unity of Essence, O ineffable Trinity of Persons, O Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, in whom all things live, move, and have their being!) art
the prime object of my Faith; to whom all truths are to be referred, as the
first and infallible rule of all verity.

Thou have revealed thy self, as an infinite, independent, eternal, perfect,
and omnipotent Creator of all things, Conserver of the whole Universe, Governor
of Heaven and Earth, Glorifier of Angels, Redeemer of Sinners, Justifier of
Saints, first Author, and final End of all Creatures. I believe, adore, admire,
and melt away in the meditation of these thy mavelous greatnesses, and
glories.

Thou have delivered unto me by thy Apostles, (the faithful Interpreters of
thy Word and Will) a short Symbol, as a complete abridgment of the truths I am
bound to believe; of the good things I am to hope; and of the blessed objects,
whereon I am to fix my affection. O Divine Creed! little in expressions, but
large in mysteries; containing sweet milk for Children, and solid meat for Men;
I firmly credit each tittle thou containest, in the same sense and meaning, it
is to be believed: I will frequently repeat and ruminate each one of thy
sublime articles; when I rise, I will remember thee; when I betake me to my
rest, I will recite thee: Thou shall be my Garment to adorn me, my Glass to
dress me, my Corslet to defend me, till I come to thy blessed Kingdom, (O
Father Almighty, and all Mercy!) where thy self in clear vision, wilt be the
revealed object of my Faith, the final accomplisher of my Hope, and the rich
recompense of my Love, in thy life everlasting.

3. The Formal Object of Faith.
Divine Revelation, is the formal object of our Faith: by which truths are
delivered from God to man in diverse manners.
THou have made man, and placed him in this world, (O Sovereign Creator!) to
know, serve, love and please thee; and to praise thee eternally in the next
world: But how, alas! can he arrive at this end, or hope to hit this mark,
unless he be heightened above his depressing earth, elevated beyond his drossie
senses, and enlightened with a more sublime knowledge than his own weak reason
can reach unto? Thy supernatural assistance, (O Divine bounty!) is necessary to
raise him to these blessed objects, which are above nature: His blindness is
too great, and his ignorance is too gross, to discover the Mysteries of Faith,
and secrets of Religion: He must learn this Science from thy self, (O supreme
Verity!) and this assurance must be derived from thine own Divine revelation.

And this thou have abundantly performed, (O immense fountain of all Truth!) at
sundry times, by several means, and in diverse manners.

1. By outward words; forming, voices (as it were) in the air, to inform us of
thy will.

2. By speaking to our hearts, which thou disposest to understand thy heavenly
inspirations.

3. By interposing the Ministry of thy Creatures to denounce thy commands:
Teaching us by thy Angels, preaching to us by thy Prophets, instructing us by
thy Apostles, informing us by thy Scriptures, which are missives sent from
thine Omnipotency, declaring to us mortals thy pleasure.

4. By Visions, either purely Intellectual, (as in S. Paul); or Imaginary, (as
in Jeremy); or Real, (as in Daniel); all showing by silent signs and
resemblances, what thou will have effected.

5. By Dreams, when the outward senses being shut up from all distracting
objects, our souls are sweetly informed with thy Divine Verities.

6. By Raptures, when our elevated spirits, inflamed with heavenly love, are
for a time interdicted the use of their corporeal senses and operations, and
totally taken up in the contemplation of thy infinite beauties and perfections.

7. By thine own dear Son, our sweet Savior; (in whom were hidden all the
treasures of thy Divine Science:) Him thou sentst us, (O eternal and
ever-loving Father!) from heaven to earth, to be our Doctor and Master, and to
teach us thy heavenly Truths, by his own humane mouth.

O my God! how great is thy love in all these manifestations, and how great is
my obligation for all these thy mercies? In how many languages do thou speak
to my deaf Soul? Be thou eternally praised, for all thy comfortable words,
revelations, visions, raptures, instructions, which thou have conferred upon
all thy Saints and Servants; but above all, for sending thy beloved Son, thy
coeternal, coequal, consubstantial, increated, and yet incarnate Wisdom; to
reveal the mystery of thy Law, the immensity of thy Love, the marvels of thy
Mercy: O my Soul! What glory is it, to be instructed by Gods own Son? O my
Lord! how pleasing are thy words to my pallat? how far more sweet are they to
my heart, than is honey, or the honeycomb to my mouth?

4. The Rule and Judge of Faith.
The Rule and Judge, to distinguish between Divine Revelations, and Diabolical
Delusions, is the Catholic Church, which alone has power to explicate the
Scriptures, and judge of Tradition.
BUt since I find my self unfit and unworthy, to whom thou (O my Supreme
Sovereign!) should particularly talk, and tell thy Divine secrets: Behold, I
here absolutely renounce all relying upon any seeming instinct, self-judgment,
or proper re son, in matters of my Faith; and entirely submit to that Judge whom
thou have appointed to regulate, inform, and command me.

Yes, (O Jesu my loving Savior, the only revealer of all Faith, and prime
Author of all Truth!) Thou have espoused to thy self, and established for thy
servants an infallible Church, as an unshaken Pillar to lean upon, a solid
groundwork to build on, a skillful teacher and suggester of all necessary
tenants, a speaker by thy Spirit, and an expounder of thy words.

To deny this, (O my God) were to slander thy Providence, and suspect thy
Justice: Can I doubt, but the same Providence, which so eminently presides in
all human affairs, so plainly appears in the daily supply of my corporal
necessities, and which has given me a Sun, by the light whereof I may guide my
bodily steps from error during this my life's pilgrimage; has not also ordained
an infallible and safe conduct for my immortal Soul, to guide it in its way to
Eternity?

Has thy Justice commanded me to believe, love and serve thee, (O my Sovereign
Creator!) upon pain of eternal punishment, and has not thy goodness
sufficiently showed me the means and manner whereby to effect it?

Be thou eternally blessed, (O my merciful Lord God!) and thy Providence ever
praised; which has left me a sacred Church, to which I may safely give credit;
since he that hears her, hears thee, who art her Inspirer, Governor, and
Protector.

Behold, (O my Lord!) I pull down the Sails of my own soaring judgment: Avaunt
all you Heresies, Singularities, Sects, and Self-opinions; here I will dwell,
since I have advisedly chosen it: in this Ark, I fear no Shipwreck; in this
Haven, I may safely cast my Anchor; in thy bosom and embraces, (O dear Mother!)
I rest secure and satisfied. I believe what thou tellest me, admit what thou
determinest, reject what thou refusest: I embrace all thy holy definitions,
(concerning Grace, Justification, Sacraments, and all other Tenants whatsoever,
contested by contentious Heretics) as so many heavenly revelations: and I
hearken to thy Doctrine, as to the voice of the Divinity; since the same Spirit
which spoke to the world in the Apostles, continues in their Successors, which
are thy present Pastors.

O what Joy, what Comfort, what quiet, what assurance brings this proposition:
Christ's true Church cannot Err? She never yet erred, she never shall for the
future; the malice of Heretics, and rage of Hell shall never prevail against
her: God is her Head, her Guide, her Instructor, even unto the end of the
World. O my Soul! how good is it for us to be here, where only happiness can be
hoped; and elsewhere is nothing but darkness, error, damnation! Thou have not
done thus, (O most loving Lord!) to every Nation; it is thy special grace and
goodness to my undeserving Soul, for which she shall ever sound forth the
sacred Anthems of thy praises.

5. The Motives of Credibility.
Christ himself is the founder of our Faith: The Greatness of the Church: The
Quality of the Doctrine: The Means, by which it was planted and propagated.
WHen I consider thee, (my dear Savior!) to be the Origin, Founder, Denouncer,
Teacher, and Establisher of my Faith; Oh how can I doubt of its verity and
sincerity! Thou (Lord!) art all truth, all might, all wisdom, all goodness:
Thou have confirmed thy mysterious words with such miraculous works, as none
could effect, but by divine assistance: O how credible are thy testimonies?

When I weigh the wonderful greatness, glory and splendour, of thy dear Spouse
the Catholic Church; her antiquity, extent, succession; her establishment,
order, union; her charity, constancy, sanctity, and all other her advantages
and prerogatives, (which would fill whole volumes to explicate;) am I not
sufficiently convinced, that she is not built up by human policy, but is the
work of thy heavenly power? O City of God! what glorious things are said of
thee? which have such excellent succors from above; such admirable success
against thy enemies; such amiable sweetness to confer upon thy faithful
children!

When I ponder the quality of the doctrine, so pure, so perfect, so holy;
forbidding all Sin, even in the least thought or desire; teaching all Virtue;
tending to a supernatural end, (as self-hatred, contempt of all temporalities,
etc.) and aiming (O Lord!) at thy holy Love and union: How clearly does it
appear to proceed from thy self, the pure source of all sanctity and
perfection? Alas! how unproportionable is man's weakness and wickedness to think
of a doctrine so conformable to thy divine greatness?

When I also meditate on the means, whereby this Faith was at first planted,
and soon after propagated to the utmost ends of the world; I clearly behold a
hand of heaven, and an evident draught of thy infinite power and providence.
Twelve Apostles, poor, powerless, creditless persons, (proposing things
contrary to men's natural appetites, and of most hard digestion to flesh and
blood) to give Laws to the whole world! To conquer and convert the Emperors, and
Kings of the earth rising in express opposition against them! I plainly
perceive thy cooperation, O Father of Heaven, and thy choosing of weaklings to
confound the strong.

It Is thou alone can be master of this sacred science; and I may with an
humble confidence cry out: If this be error, (O Lord!) it is thy self have
deceived me; since thou have led me into this belief, by persons of such
sanctity, and confirmed it by prodigies of such efficacy.

6. Resolutions concerning Faith.
ANd now, (my dear Lord and Lover!) I offer thee my poor heart, replenished
with all these Acts, Affections and Resolutions. O that I might dye for the
defense of these infallible Verities? How willingly would I lay down my life,
and shed every drop of blood in my body, for each part and parcel of this my
Faith and profession?

Thou, O Jesu! art God-man, and Man-God: Thou art the Way, the Truth, and the
life. O that I might be torn in a thousand morsels for following this way,
believing this Truth, loving this Life!

Thy Church is infallible, and her decisions indubitable. O that occasion were
offered of a thousand deaths, swords, fires, torments, to try my fidelity in
this assured particular!

But how resolvest thou, (my feeble soul!) upon these high and heroic
exploits, who art so subject to faint, and to turn coward upon far less
occasion? Alas! have thou not often belied thy Faith by thy works, without any
constraint or contradiction? Thou confessest a Savior, needy upon earth, and
naked on the Cross; and yet thy covetousness is insatiable! A Savior humble
and contemned; and thou breathest nothing but ambition! A Savior meek,
merciful, patient; and thy enmities are immortal, thy injuries intolerable, thy
hatred irreconcilable!

Ah weakling! Thou yieldest at a pins-pricking, how will thou stand at the
swords piercing? If straws make thee stumble, how will thou subsist against
darts? Conquer thy self first in these lesser skirmishes, that thou may be
constant in those greater combats.

O my Lord! I am reduced to nothing: I praise the Conquerors, but my self
perishes in the smallest conflicts: I am too conscious of my own frailty, to
confide in my own forces: Yet I desire to imitate the invincible courage of
holy Martyrs, and tender Virgins, who for this Faith endured such torments.
Thou (Lord!) art my only strength and confidence: O let thy grace, (which is
never wanting to them that trust in thee,) powerfully support, and shield me,
(thy weak, yet willing Soldier) with faithful courage and perseverant
constancy, in the day of battle; and whenever time or occasion shall exact a
trial of my true fidelity, thou (O Savior Jesu, the Author and finisher of my
Faith!) who have called me, sought me, found me, carried me home to thy fold,
and numbered me amongst thy Sheep; Grant, I beseech thee, that I may lead a life
correspondent to my Faith, and that my manners may be conformable to thy
merciful illuminations: That after the imperfect and obscure knowledge of this
world, I may finally arrive to the pure knowledge of thee in the other; where,
with thy Saints, I hope to behold thee face to face, by the light of glory in
thy blessed Eternity.

7. A triple Practice; and the Conclusion of these Acts of Faith.
IN the mean space, I will by thy blessed assistance, (O divine bounty!) daily
and diligently prepare, encourage, and fortify my Soul with these three pious
practices.

1. Since Faith is the fountain of all Grace, the life of my soul, the soul of
my love, the groundwork of my salvation, the only Eye by which I can view
heaven through this veil of mortality, the root of all that is truly good,
desirable, amiable; and yet this so necessary a good, (O eternal Goodness!) is
thy free gift: I will instantly beg it of thy bounty, and never cease crying
out, in imitation of thy Apostles; Lord, increase my Faith.

2. Since the want of this lively and active Faith, in such things as concern
thy divine honor, (O dread Sovereign!) and my own happiness, is the chief
cause that I have passed and lost so many years, days, and hours of my short
life, without making any progress in thy love, or profit in virtue: My soul
shall henceforth inhabit Heaven; my spirit shall be no longer linked to these
sensible objects, but shall look upon things to come, as if they were present
truths: Ah World! what art thou to me, who am made for an Eternity? O Earth!
how I loath thee, when I behold Heaven!

3. Since my Faith is thus settled, my conscience thus quieted, my mind thus
resolved upon such evident grounds, such infallible Principles; Let Hell vomit
out all its malice by heretics mouths against these my Tenants; Let all the
dead arise from their graves, to tell me I am deceived; Let the Angels and
Saints descend from heaven to Evangelize a new doctrine; Let all Christians
upon Earth revolt against this, and receive a contrary belief: I will still
remain steadfast in my choice, and firm in my station: not for the miracles
which have confirmed me, and marks of truth, which have sealed my security, and
thy Churches infallibility: but because thou (my Lord!) who have thus
illuminated my soul with the supernatural light of Faith, which thy Church
teaches me, art the Truth it self, and can not possibly deceive me.

Lord! I believe thy self, and thy sacred Church: This is the sum of my belief:
This is my present profession and protestation before heaven and earth: Here I
live, here I will die: Supply my defects, (O indeficient fountain of goodness!)
and strengthen this my Faith by thy efficacious Grace, even to the last gasp. I
believe in God, etc.

The Third Exercise. Of Hope.
1. The Definition of Hope.
Hope, is a Theological Virtue, enabling and enclining our souls to trust in
God, as their proper and Sovereign good, by means of his grace, and good works.
O Most infinitely amiable Lord God! who of thy mere, unmeasurable, and
boundless mercy, have thus filled my Understanding with true Faith, whereby I
have professed to believe thee, and all thy revealed Verities; confessed thee
to be the only object of my desires; and acknowledged thee the Author of my
beginning, preserver of my Being, and the blessed end I aim at.

Replenish now my Will with heavenly Hope; that I may patiently, and
perseverantly, cheerfully and courageously, expect the performances of thy
faithful and infallible promises.

Lift up my soul, (O powerful Lord!) from her natural weakness and
unweildiness; that soaring aloft upon Hopes sacred wings, she may attentively
look on thee, and always aspire toward thee, her only secure Center, and the
sweet accomplishment of her desires and pretensions.

Thou (O Sovereign Goodness!) art all amiable, and therefore all desirable; But
alas! I am yet far from thee, I see but a glimpse of thy glory; I behold thee
at a great distance, through the dark prospective-glass of Faith; I enjoy not
thy beatifying presence, thy perfect love, thy heavenly happiness: My soul is
not yet disengaged from her clog of clay, she has not yet triumphed over her
temptations, trampled upon the bellies of her enemies, Satan, Sin, Sensuality;
nor crowned her virtues with final Perseverance.

These heights are the objects of my Hope, and I rest assured, that I may by
thy helping grace, (O bountiful bestower of all blessings!) arrive at all these
happinesses.

Ah! my immortal Soul! what need thou but thy God? what desire thou but
his favor and friendship? Can thou content thy covetous appetites with
natures poor, imperfect, and perishable accommodations? Alas! how unnecessary
are they in order to thy sovereign good, how unaccomplish'd, how unsatisfactory?

But to desire thee (O only amiable object of my wishes!) is true felicity: Be
thou therefore henceforth the whole aim of my love, and sole scope of my
endeavors: O let my soul be totally taken up with this study, to turn from
creatures, and return to thee, her only desirable Creator!

Yes, Lord; As the tired and thirsty Heart seeks after the living fountain; so
does my faint soul desire thee, (O lovely source of all sweetness!) When, O
when shall I attain to thee, possess thee, enjoy thee; when shall I appear in
thy sweet presence, and be fully inebriated with thy only satisfying pleasures!
By thy grace (O merciful Maker!) I may get these Glories; and by a good life, I
shall in some sort deserve the performance of thy Promises.

I will now therefore strive (O my God!) to correspond to thy never-wanting
Grace: I will presently, seriously, and vigorously settle my self to live
virtuously: And though my passions are violent, my imperfections many, my
offenses grievous; yet thy grace is stronger, thy goodness greater, thy mercy
more powerful; all which give me hopes of victory over my self, and from thee,
confidence of pardon, and compassion.

2. The main motive of Hope is Gods great Mercy; (...) at all times, in all
places, to all conditions.
O My meek Creator! how infinite is thy Mercy! how can I consider it, and
distrust thee? Thou at first, broughtst forth Angels and men out of their
eternal Nothing, to a glorious and blessed being. After sin, thou providedst a
present remedy, and promisedst a powerful Redeemer: In Heaven, thou
recompencest thy Saints above their hopes or deserts: In Hell, thou punishest
with less rigor than thy enemies malice requires: On Earth, thy glorious beams
of providence shine upon all thy creatures; rich and poor, great and small,
Saint and Sinner, Jew and Gentile, Christian and Pagan: Am I wicked? Thou
sweetly wooest me to penance: Am I penitent? Thou willingly receivest me to
pardon: Am I just? Thou conservest me outwardly, comfortest me inwardly, and
encouragest me to perseverance, with infallible promises of eternal pleasures,
in thy blessed Paradise.

O mercy! the sweet refuge, and secure harbor of my Soul: Shall I not hope in
thee, so immense, so infinite, so ready, at all times, in all places, to all
conditions? Yes, I will rely on thee, O my only comfort! I will repose in thee
in all the accidents of this my wearisom Pilgrimage, in my languor and health,
in adversity and prosperity, life and death, for time and eternity.

And when further, I duly dive into thy Paternal Providence, (O heavenly
Father!) which furnishes all things with all necessaries to compass the end of
their creation; taking care of the smallest Birds, Beasts, Flies, Fishes,
Plants, Minerals, all: shall I doubt of thy solicitude for my soul, the most
excellent of them all, made to be master of them all, formed and fashioned to
thy own divine resemblance? O my Creator! how glorious things do I expect from
thy bounty, which has conferred such plenty upon these thy least creatures?

Thy Power also supports this my Hope and confidence: Who can take my soul out
of thy hands, if thou will save it? What are Hells powers, compared to thy
omnipotency? What shackles of sin can hold me, if thou will break them? Thou
(Lord!) can lift up my drowned soul from the deluge of vice, to the piety of
Saints, to the purity of Angels, to the perfection of Seraphins, in a moment,
sooner then I can speak a word, think a thought, or twinkle with my eye.

And thy fidelity in the performance of thy promises, (O just God!) confirms
and comforts me in all the premises: For Heaven and Earth shall pass, but not a
tittle of thy words shall perish.

3. Other Motives of Hope.
Gods great Benefits are also powerful motives for us to place our Confidence
in him: Especially, his Creation, Redemption, Vocation.
HOw can I weigh thy wonderful Benefits, (O most bountiful Lord!) and not
esteem them as so many sacred pledges of thy eternal love to me, and strong
pillars to support my confidence in thee? Thou created'st me freely, willingly,
unconstrainedly of nothing; and can thou hate thine own handy work? Thou
gave me a noble Being, and shall I doubt but thou will give me a perfect and
accomplished Being? Thou made all for me, and me for thy self; and may I not
hope, thou will bring me to thy self? Thou constituted'st me King of thy
creatures, will thou cast me only off, and not govern me with thy creatures?
Thou designed'st me for thy glory, and will thou destroy me for eternity? No
Lord! Thou will in thy good time complete thine own purposes in me, and finish
these blessed beginnings.

Thou (O sweet Redemer!) undertookest a thirty three-years Pilgrimage upon
earth to seek me a lost sheep; will thou reject me seeking after thee? Thou
have loved me, and lost thy life for me; and can I imagine thou will ever leave
me, unless I first leave to love thee? O love! capable to cure all sickness,
able to give life to the dead! Ah my heart! How can thou choose but be
softened to compunction, and hightned to confidence, with these efficacious
comforts and sweetnesses.

Thou have not only delivered me from sin, but called me to sanctity, with thy
holy Vocation; giving me thy grace in Baptism, continually repairing it with
thy other Sacraments, separating me from the vast multitude of infidels and
heretics, which are out of the Church Way to beatitude; not only permitting me
to possess a place amongst thy faithful Christians, but fetting me in an high
and honorable condition, wherein I may make use of all aids, all helps, all
means, to farther me in virtue and goodness in this life, and to purchase glory
in the next. O loving Lord! how greatly do all these endearings, demonstrate
the earnest desire thou have to save me?

If thou art further called to the more perfect state of Priesthood, or
Religion; O how highly does it enforce this motive of thy Hope?

O my God! how infinite is thy goodness; how manifold thy blessings, how
innumerable thy benefits, corporal and spiritual, general and particular,
performed and promised? And can I suspect that thou, who have done so much for
me, wilt not accomplish what is yet behind? O my Lord, my life, my love! I put
my whole confidence in thee, and expect from thy bounty all the benefits thou
have promised me, because I know thou art truth it self, which never can
deceive, nor be deceived; but thy Word is infallible, and thy Work immutable.

4. Fear is also to be joined with our Hope; because God is terrible in his
works, in his chastisements, and in his Counsels.
YEt least Hope without Fear may make me insolent and negligent in providing
for my Salvation: crucify my flesh with thy Fear (O my Lord!) for I tremble at
thy Judgments: O give me a chaste and filial apprehension of thee (my loving
Father!) that I may reverently and incessantly honor thy infinite Mercy, and
never dare displease thy dread Majesty: Give me that Fear which is Hopes
daughter, and begotten by thy pure Love in my soul; that my continual care may
be to please thee, purely and perfectly for thine own sake, not servilely for
mine own interest.

It Is true (O my Lord!) my Sins are many, and grievous; I confess it, and am
confounded and affrighted at the memory of them: But is there any blemish so
foul, which my Redeemers blood cannot cure? Thy mercies and merits (dear
Savior) are so immense, that should my only conscience be burdened with all
offenses of all mankind, I would not despair of thy pardon: I will therefore
remember thy sacred Wounds (O Jesu!) and there will I confidently hide my self,
till my iniquities be passed over.

Thou say (O eternal Lover!) As I live I desire not the death of a sinner,
but rather that he return to me and live: And I also cordially, hopefully, and
confidently answer: As I live, I desire rather to die, than to commit a deadly
sin; and I beseech thee to take my soul out of my body, before thou take thy
love and this resolution out of my soul.

O generous Resolution! O the infinite mercy of my blessed Creator! And can
thou any longer doubt (my Soul) but the same divine goodness has eternally
chosen and predestined thee to his glory, which has now thus graciously
endued thee with these heroic thoughts so befitting thy duty? What dreadest
thou, O thou of little Faith! He has blessed thee with spiritual blessings;
chosen thee before the foundation of the world; predestined thee into the
adoption of a child, through Jesus Christ, according to the resolution of his
good pleasure.

O my Lord! blessed be thy eternal Love, and ever praised be thy infinite
Mercy! how happy art thou, (my poor Soul) and how much obliged to thy dear and
dread Sovereign, who has vouchsafed a favorable glance of his eye upon thee
from all Eternity Lord! I will henceforth love thee, as an obedient child does
his loving Father; I will serve thee courageously, cordially and cheerfully for
thine own infinite goodness sake, which has given me such hopes of my being
enrolled amongst thy adopted children, and of having a blessed portion alloted
me in thy heavenly inheritance.

5. The Sins contrary to Hope, are Despair, Presumption, and too much
Confidence in Creatures. Despair, is a certain aversion from Beatitude (or
rather, a leaving off, from looking after it) under a false color of
impossibility to attain to it.
GRant yet furthermore (O most gracious Lord God!) that I may not so dread thy
Judgments, as to despair of thy Goodness: O let me never be seized with the
least disgust against piety, or distrust of thy promised Beatitude: Let me at
no time desist from patiently pursuing it, upon any pretense of impossibility
to purchase it.

No, my Lord, my Love, my Life, my Strength, my Mercy, my Refuge; to thy power
all things are possible: I acknowledge thee to be the most undrainable source of
all sanctity, the bountiful giver of all grace, the encourager, comforter, and
raiser up of sinners: I hear thee speaking to my dejected Spirit: It is I, fear
nothing: I am thy protector, whereof art thou apprehensive? I came to call
sinners, to cure the sickly, to comfort the sorrowful.

O my God! what sweet and ravishing Words are these to my sad and sinful soul!
Art thou so good to the most wicked? O how gracious will thou be to them that
devoutly seek thee, desire to please thee, and are unwilling to offend thee? O
ever blessed be thy infinite bounty and benignity! Let the most depraved in the
world, leave off their sinfulness, and look on thy sweetness, and they may
confidently hope in thy Goodness; and let the most holy ones incessantly and
eternally praise the immensity of thy Mercies.

6. Presumption is a disordered expectation of good things from the divine
Bounty.
LEt me also ground all these my Hopes of happiness, purely in thy power, (O my
Sovereign Lord and maker!) and upon thy promises; let me expect nothing from
thy mercy disorderly, nor from my own merits presumptuously.

O my poor soul! What folly, what frenzy, what vanity is it for thee to hope in
thy own goodness, unsupported by the divine grace? to think of scaling heaven,
without heavenly help? to dream, that in doing, or living contrary to thy own
knowledge and conscience, thou shall gain so great a good, as is an eternity of
glory? As though thou (my Supreme Creator!) did so highly prize this caitif
Creature; as not to punish him according to his wilful wickedness, or never
deprive him of those felicities which thou have laid up for thy faithful
friends and favorites.

No Lord! Thou have disposs'd all things in their due number, weight and
measure; thou have set certain limits to thy creature, which are impossible to
be passed; and thou have established rules serving for the secure guidance of
such souls to thy self, (who art their final end and beatitude,) as will not
peremptorily go astray, and deprive themselves of thy blessings: O let me
worthily conceive of thy wisdom, greatness, and goodness, and never abuse thy
bounty and longanimity, by taking from thence occasion, to continue in my
malice and impenitency.

I fear thee, therefore (O my dread Sovereign!) amidst the heights of my Hopes:
O let me not be dashed against the rock of Presumption, having happily escaped
drowning in the gulf of Despair.

O my Lord! What skill, what care, what adress is necessary to stear this
tottering Vessel, that it may safely arrive at thee, its only secure Harbor;
lest thou reject it as presumptuous, or detest it as desperate! Be thou the
guide of my week soul, O sweat Savior! Let thy Spirit of discretion direct her
in the middle track, that she neither lanch forth into the main of Presumption,
nor be swallowed up in the quicksands of Despair. Let me hope for such
happiness, in such measure, by such means, as are most pleasing and agreeable
to thy sacred Majesty. O let my Wishes be ever conformed to thy will: Let my
Hopes still rely upon thy mercies: Let my endeavors be always to live in all
purity, sanctity and perfection; that nothing may frustrate the happy
accomplishment of my high expectation.

7. Too much confidence in Creatures, is also contrary to our livly Hope in our
Creator. And the conclusion of this Exercise.
THou only, (O my blessed Creator) can bound my desires; Ah! what content can
I take in the best of thy Creatures: Thou have made my heart for thy self; and
till it rests in thee, its true Center, it remains totally unsatisfied. O
worldly glories! what are you but poor and perishing trifles; compared to my
Gods essential goodness?

Grant therefore, O my God! that I may so love all thy creatures, and make such
use of all temporalities; that my hopes may never be unfastned from thee, my
final and eternal happiness! Let me not rest in them as sovereign, nor pursue
them as principal, since they are too vain and uncertain, too incapable and
unworthy to quiet and content my Soul, which aims at a higher mark, and hopes
one day to behold thy aimable countenance more clearly than through Faiths
glass, to contemplate thy lovely perfections without lassitude, to enter into
thy eternal Paradise, and be there sweetly ravished with the unveiled rarities
of thy Divinity.

Thou Lord! art the only Author of all my Good, and therefore the main object
of all my Hope: Yet since thy paternal piety and providence has allotted
second and less principal causes to be assistants to me, in order to the
desired possession of these prime prerogatives, I will place also, in the
sacred Humanity of my Redeemer, in the powerful intercession of the
Mother-Virgin, in the suffrages of the heavenly Angels and holy Saints, so much
Confidence; as may not (in the least measure) hinder, distract, or divert my
full Hope from thy self, who art my supreme and only sovereign object.

And now, my God! the only desired of my Soul! behold, I offer up unto thee all
these acts of my Hope and Confidence: And here again I most humbly acknowledge,
that thou have provided, both for my Body, and Soul in so convenient a manner,
as no other but thy self (O increated Wisdom!) could have effected: To thee
then, I commit my self and all that concerns me to be disposed of now and ever,
as shall be most pleasing to thy divine honor, and most conform to thy eternal
and equitable disposition.

For since thy power, knowledge, and goodness, are infinite; what hurt can befall
him, or what enemy harm him, who lives secure in thy sacred friendship, and is
shadowed under the wings of thy Divine Protection.

For the future, (O my good and gracious Sovereign!) I will grave on the door
of my mouth and heart, Dominus providebit; Our Lord will provide: Fear not, my
soul! Our Lord governs thee, nothing can be wanting to thee: God is for us, who
dare be against us? He places us near himself, let who will stretch their
hands against us. Let Man, and Devil, earth and Hell, fight against us; Thou
Lord, art my Captain, my comfort, my company: Thou, O JESU! art my victory, my
glory, my crown, and my contentment; Thou O Christ! art my hope, my help, my
happiness: I will henceforth dread nothing, but to displease thee, nor desire
any thing, but to love thee: I will rest quiet, and confident under thy
fatherly care, and powerful protection; come sickness or health, welcome
darkness or light, joy or sorrow, plenty or penury, friend or foe, life or
death, Heaven or Purgatory, Time or Eternity.

The fourth Exercise. Of Charity.
1. The Definition of Charity, in respect of the Divine Majesty.
Charity (in respect of God) is a Theological Virtue, elevating our Wills to a
supernatural love and liking of God for himself, and for his own sake. Several
Acts of Love and Charity.
THou (O most amiable Lord God!) art Charity, and he that remains in Charity,
lives in thee, and thou in him: O divine Love! O happy life! Lord give me this
love, that I may thus live: draw my will powerfully by thy grace, to love thy
goodnesses, greatnesses, and glories, with a supernatural liking of them for
thine own sake.

Habituate and dispose me thy poor creature, (O Omnipotent Creator!) to form
sweet Acts of thy sacred love; direct me to fasten all my affections to thy
only interests; destroy in me all selfishness; cancel all divertisments to
created objects; and raise up my soul to a sincere desire, that thou alone
should possess all such perfections, as are to thy self most proper and
convenient.

I am therefore most highly pleased, most heartily glad, and I most humbly
congratulate thee (O my Lord!) that thou art even all that which thou art: and
that thou enjoyest thine own eternal Prerogatives, thy Unity of Essence, thy
Trinity of subsistences, thy Infinity of attributes, thy Power, Wisdom, Bounty,
Beatitude, Greatness, Glory, and all other the unconceivable goods and
perfections flowing from thy divine Nature, and peculiar to thy eternal Being.

O the inscrutable and immense perfections of my God! how glad is my soul, that
thou can not be fully comprehended, nor perfectly known by any created
understanding.

I wish and desire (Dear Lord!) the accomplishment of thy most just
Commandments; the augmentation of thy honor, praise, service, and all other
appurtinances to thy glory, or relatives to thy greatness, with all the
affections which can possibly be conceived by thy weak creatures capacity.

O my Lord! I will and desire all this for thine own selfs sake, with a love of
perfect liking, benevolence, and congratulation for thy good; without the least
touch of concupiscence, or proper interest.

O the joy and jubily of my heart, to consider thee (the mighty Monark of
heaven and earth!) to be in thy self and of thy self, so great, so happy, so
rich, so glorious! Oh! how ardent are my wishes that all things that have a
being, would more glorify thee, more highly exalt thy holy Name, more
zealously seek thy honor, and more religiously respect and reverence thy
Majesty.

O that thy glory were infinitely greater in heaven and earth! O that all
created liberties were more perfectly addicted to thy Love, and all Spirits had
a clearer knowledge of thy incomparable goodness, excellency and amability! And
yet, how highly does it please me, that all that which the best of creatures
can endeavor to do for thy Love and Service, is so far inferior to thy
essential worth and dignity?

Live my dread Sovereign! Be thou what thou art, Infinite, Eternal,
Incomprehensible! Remain (O powerful Emperor of the whole universe!) for ever
exalted upon the Throne of thine own greatnesses and glories: I love thee in
them all, and each of them in thee, as if I were all one with thee, they all
mine own, and I equally concerned in them all.

2. The same Charity wherewith we love God, induces us to love all his
Creatures, our Neighbors, and our Selves.
I Love all things, O my Lord, in thee and for thee. Thy Creatures are the
products of thy power; they are so many bright beams issuing from thy bounty;
they are under thy dominion and jurisdiction, thy proper goods and possessions,
and appurtenances to thy glory: Lord! I admire, adore, praise and love thee, in
all and every of them.

My Neighbor is yet a nearer shadow of thy goodness, (O divine Creator!) a
livelier Image of thy greatness, thy own adoptive child, bought at the dear
purchase of thy precious blood, and designed to be partaker of thy heavenly
Paradise.

O shall it ever enter into my heart, to hate or offend any one of these thy
lovely creatures? Is it possible I can truly love thee (My Lord and my God!)
and loath that soul, which is stamped with thy sacred similitude, intended for
thy greatest glory, and predestined to chant forth thy eternal praises
amongst the blessed quires of Saints and Angels? Ah! how can that body, which
shall be one day resuscitated to heavenly bliss, imbellisht with glorious
dowries of immortallity, be now odious unto me, aiming at the like happiness?

No, my Lord! I love my Neighbors most truly, tenderly, particularly, in thee
and for thee: I will henceforth cherish them all for thy sake, and contract a
durable peace with them: Be they vicious, envious, ugly, ulcerated; they are
still my fellow Brethren, and thy lovely creatures, and therefore fit objects
of my affection; Confirm me, O my God! in this ample and diffuse charity; O let
all my joy and complacency, all my wishes and desires in loving them, drive at
the only glory of thy infinite goodness.

And now, O my Lord and Lover! reflecting my Charity upon my own Soul; I most
humbly beseech thee, that I may henceforth so truly love my own eternal
welfare, as never more to adventure the loss of thy grace, by the admittance of
wilful sin.

Imprint, O my God, this important resolution with indelible characters in my
heart: Never to sin wilfully in thy sight, were it to save the whole World, or
to gain Heaven to a million of souls; much less to please any earthly friend,
or purchase any temporal commodity: Ah, unequal chang! Ah, poor return of
profit! to win a world and lose my own soul.

3. Three effects of Charity. 1. It makes us truly love our Selves. 2. It
contracts a friendship with God. 3. It is the form of all other Virtues.
THou have no where expressly enjoined me to love my Self (O great Master of
Perfection!) because to love thee, seek thee, serve thee, perfectly, purely,
punctually, is to love my Self solidly, truly, unfainedly. These loves, O my
Soul! cannot be the least separated: thou love thy Self really, when thou
love thy God entirely; thou hate thy Self absolutely, when thy love has not
his goodness for its object. Do thou not then hate thy Self, when thou
hazardest thine own Salvation? Do thou love thy Self, when by voluntary sin
thou leave thy self in danger of eternal Death and Damnation? Do thou love
thy Body, when thou pamper'st it, and permittest such pleasures, as must be
paid with perpetual punishments? O falls, feigned, and foolish affection, which
tends to thy own ruin and destruction! No my Lord! it is thy only Love, which
is the true model of Self-love. O let masked and mistaken Charity, never more
betray me; let me love my self in loving thee, serving thee, obeying thee,
renouncing all proper contentment, and desiring thy only satisfaction.

If you love me, (says the Lord of Love) you will keep my Laws; and if you
fulfill my precepts, you are my friends: O sublime Dignity! to contract
friendship and familiarity with the King of Glory! O divine Promotion! How
highly are thy friends honored? O heavenly Monarch! How firmly is their
Principality established?

Will thou not, O my Soul! court, cherish, and covet this sacred Charity, which
procures thee such inestimable nobility, pleasure and profit? Ah silly
Worldlings! what do you, what seek you, what pretend you? After all your pains,
what is your pay at the best, but a little pelf, a puff of honor, a name at
Court, a favor from a King, a friendship with an Emperor: and what is in all
these, that is not frail and full of danger? Ah! how long will you sweat in
these unsure and unsatisfying persuits? when as to be Gods friend and favorite,
I am so (if I will) even at this very instant. O the heavenly prerogative of
perfect Charity!

It Is thou alone (O glorious Charity!) which give unto Virtues their true
form, life, value, worth, denomination and perfection; since thou guidest them
all unto God, who is the end whereto they are to be referred, and to his glory,
for which they are to be practiced, to make them truly Virtues.

To thee therefore (O King of my heart!) I dedicate my works; to thee (O my
Sovereign good, my only end, and sweet center!) I consecrate all my future
endeavors: I will not now live, but to love thee; not breath, but to bless
thee; not have any being at all, but to be all thine. All I shall do, think,
speak, during the whole residue of my days, is designed to thy glory: I give up
tree, branches, leaves, flowers, fruit, all, to this only end, by an entire,
irrevocable, and eternal Donation: Whatsoever shall hereafter happen contrary
to this my resolution, I here protest in thy presence, (O my God!) to be a mere
surprisal, and altogether involuntary; And therefore (now for then) utterly
disavow it; and choose thee, embrace thee, aim at thee (O my blessed Creator!)
as the final period of all my Faith, Hope, Love, Actions, Intentions and
Pretensions whatsoever.

4. The habit of Charity, may daily increase during this life.
O Unlimited Virtue! of which a Soul is by so much the more capable and
susceptible, by how much she has thee in a higher perfection: How passionatly
does my heart desire the increase of thee?

O my Lord! I ask thee no enlargment of earthly treasure, no addition to my
worldly goods or glories: I only beg the riches of thy pure Love, and a
prosperous progress in thy perfect Charity; that I may seek thee in all, affect
thee above all, and live content with thee, who art only to me all and all.

And since each virtuous action increases this divine and desirable habitude
of Charity: Up my Soul, be thou holily covetous to heap up Heavenly Jewels,
lose no time, let slip no opportunity, lay hold on all occasions to better thy
Talent. Give grace to thy servant (O sweet Savior!) to set vigorously upon all
acts of Virtue, both great and little, that by both he may be a continual
gainer of thy gracious favor and friendship, and become more and more
agreeable to thy good love and liking.

Encourage me (O my God!) to climb up the several steps of thy heavenly
Charity: O let the same merciful goodness, which has given it a beginning in
my heart, augment it and bring it to its full growth and perfection: As I have
for thy love rooted out all affection to sin, assist me now to implant Virtues
in my Souls garden, that thou may finally repose in it, (during the midday
heat of my affection) thus fitted up and prepared for thy desired Presence.

Grant (O most gracious Lord!) that I may never more so far forget my self, and
forgo my present resolution, as to fall into mortal Sin; which is the present
death, absolute poison, and utter destruction of thy divine Charity. O love of
my God! the life of my Soul, the crown of my head, the chief jewel of my heart!
shall I lose thee for any worldly profits, pleasures, preferments? No my Soul!
Let us watch and pray, that we enter not into temptation: Let our Love be
active, that sin seize not on us being idle: Let us frequently and fervently,
cordially and continually, breath forth Acts of sweet love to our ever loving
Lord: O that we could still do it all the moments of our life, and die in the
height of this divine exercise.

5. Our Charity is to be duly ordered. 1. We are to love our God who is above
us. 2. Our own Soul, which is within us. 3. Our Neighbor, who is near to us.
4. Our Bodies, and all other things, which are under us.
O That happy Spouse? in whom thou (O Lord!) were pleased to imprint the
perfect order of Charity:) My Soul, is also thy dear Spouse, (O divine
Bridegroom!) Order there also, I beseech thee, thy heavenly love; season all my
affections with wisdom and discretion; Suffer me not to commit the least
injustice in my charity; but to settle my love upon each object according to
its true value, worth, and merit.

I love thee, (O my Lord!) chiefly and soveraignly, I love my Self only for
thee, pursuing nothing so passionatly as my Souls Salvation; that so I may more
perfectly love thee, more purely please thee, perpetually praise thee, and
enjoy thee eternally. I love my Neighbor, as stamped with thy Image, designed
for thy glory: I love thy dear Servants with complacency; I love mine Enemies
with desire of their amendment: I love all rational Creatures, with wishes of
their progress and perfection in thy Charity: Finally, I love all things in
their several orders to thee, their amiable Creator! and as they are more or
less worthy before thee, who art the only Rule and touchstone of all my
affections.

Lord! Regulate thus my love; Order thus my Charity; Let me henceforth prize
all things with an equal and upright tax: Let me look on Silver and Gold, as
white and red clay, made precious only by men's erring opinions: upon this Life,
as a vapor that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away: upon all
corporal Beauties, as flowers soon fading, whose end is deformity and
rottenness: O let me not absurdly and ignorantly equal the bodies worth, with
the Souls dignity; Heaven with Earth; Eternity with Time; or thee my Creator,
with thy Creatures.

Ah, my indiscreet Soul! how long have thou been deceived? how grossly have thou
hitherto transgressed, and swerved from these sacred Rules? how confused have
been thy affections? Alas! a poor created object, a pretended friend, a
plastred countenance, a parcel of small and perishable commodities, have so
perverted thy judgment, troubled thy senses, and taken up thy love; that thou
have often preferred them before him, who produced thee, them, and all things,
out of their eternal nothing.

Is it possible, that such disordered appetites should master a rational Soul,
endued with a being to be wholly bestowed on divine love? O suffer it no
longer, my loving Lord! Take up thy chief place in my heart, which only
appertains unto thee: Let it first cherish thy infinite Charity before all
things; and lend so much and no more of its affection to all other objects; as
thy heavenly love will permit and allow of.

6. The Retinue and train of Charity. 1. Faith and Hope go before it. 2. The
Interior and Exterior Acts, march on each side of it. 3. The Effects of the
Acts, follow it.
WHence is it (O my tepid Soul!) that having so firm a Faith in thy Creators
greatness, and so full Confidence in his goodness, thou yet remainest so cold
in his Charity? Ah my my Lord! this defect may seem supportable in Infidels who
believe not thy supreme power; and in Devils, who cannot hope in thy divine
mercy: but in me, who am so well informed of both, it is totally intolerable. O
shall the earths frail beauties move the heart of their beholders to
admiration; and shall not thy heavenly beauties, benefits perfections,
promises, inflame my Soul in thy affection? Yes, O my God! as I most unfainedly
believe thee, and most undoubtedly hope in thee, so I cannot but most cordially
love thee: And I will endeavor accordingly to practice and produce such acts,
as are conformable to these my ardent affections.

O how glad is my heart, that thou alone art God! so good, so great, so
eternal, in thy self; so incomprehensible in thy perfections; so amiable in
beauty; so admirable in glory; so infinite in felicity!

O when shall I perfectly praise thee; and powerfully excite all creatures by
my example, to glorify, love, serve, and adore thee, as thy immense goodness
deserves!

Why then, (my weak, wretched, wicked Soul!) O why have thou acted so often
contrary to thy beloved Sovereigns glory? been an open enemy to his greatness?
and so long injurious to his goodness?

Pity and Pardon me, (O meek and merciful Creator!) be no longer deprived of
the greatest praise a poor soul is capable to render thee: Lord! for the love
of thine own honor, change all sinners affections, and draw from them those
respects, duties, submissions, gratitudes, for which thy goodness created them.

O great Charity! how gloriously art thou attended? how ample and magnificent
is thy train of followers? how happy is that Soul, which becomes a Paradise of
delights by harboring thee, O divine Guest! Oh that I were worthy to feel thy
sweet effects, O heavenly Virtue!

Fullness of Joy is ever with thee; Abundance of Peace is thy inseparable
companion; and plentitude of Mercy is to thee a perpetual retainer.

O God! the sovereign Joy of all spirits, and Jubilation of all hearts! cheer
me amid'st this worlds calamities, with the solid comfort of thy only
satisfying presence, grace, and love, in my Soul.

O King of Peace! give me Peace in my Self, by an absolute union of all my
inward forces and faculties to thy only glory: Give me Peace with the Good, by
conformity of my conversation with them: Give me Peace with the Bad, by bearing
the injuries they inflict on me: Give me Peace with Thee, by an entire
submission of all my wishes and desires, to thy holy will and decree.

O most liberal Lord! Give me also the love of Mercy; that I may be ever
pitiful and compassionat toward all poor and miserable persons.

Give me the love of Beneficence; that I may be always willing to succor my
necessitous Neighbor, for thy sake: The love of Alms-deeds; that I may be
ready to relieve all his corporal wants; to Feed him in his hunger; Refresh him
in his thirst; Cloth him in his coldness; Ransom him in his captivity: Harbor
him when he has no home; Visit him when he is sick; and Bury him when he is
dead. The love of Fraternal correction; that I may charitably Correct sinners;
Instruct the ignorant; Counsel the doubtful; Comfort the sorrowful; Bear all
wrongs patiently; Pardon all injuries cordially; and pray for all the living
and the dead zealously.

O my Lord! make my Charity efficacious; Let not my love rest in lip language,
but proceed to real performances of all these outward, inward, corporal,
spiritual actions of piety; that in the dreadful and doubtful hour of my death,
and thy judgment, I may find thee (my sweet Savior!) full of pity and
compassion toward my poor Soul.

7. The Precept of loving God.
God commands us in the Old Law, to love him with all our heart, soul, and
strength: Christ repeats it in the New, as the first and greatest Precept. Acts
of pure Charity.
THy Love (O my Lord!) is in it self so excellent, and to my Soul so pleasant:
that should thou perpetuate this divine gift to me upon Earth, without ever
bestowing on me thy blessed Heaven; it must needs make me (in some sort) happy.
O my Soul! what is more precious than Gods pure love? wherein can thou, and
all creatures employ your time and talents more profitably, than in admiring
your Creators greatness, and loving his goodness?

Yet (O eternal Charity!) Thou also command me to love thee; and threatnest
to lay miseries upon me, if I love thee not! Ah! Is it not alone misery enough,
not to love thee? Is there need of so many ties of Precepts, and threats of
Punishmens to oblige me to thy love? O infinitely amiable bounty! Is not one
stroke sufficient to mollify my stony heart, Thou shall love me with thy whole
heart, but thou addest a second, and with thy whole Soul, and drivest in this
sacred wedg with a third and fourth blow, and with thy whole Strength and
Virtue?

Should thou not (O perfect Lover!) exact this just tribute from me, I
surely ought most freely to pay it, for the good I find in thy sweet
friendship; and now that thou claim'st it, and call'st for thy due: Child give
me thy heart! shall I deny it thee?

Alas, Lord! it is a poor present, but such as it is, take it totally unto thy
self, and dispose of it absolutely at thy pleasure: Oh! that it were as rich and
beautiful, as befits thy Majesty to receive, and my obligation and affection to
give? It is thy only right (O my God!) by all just titles of Creation,
Redemption, Vocation; and it shall be thine daily, by my own free Donation,
Imitation, Affection.

Lord! I love thee in this very instant, with all my heart, soul, force, and
virtue: O let not my enemy upbraid me at my death, to have passed my life
without one Act of thy pure love. Behold, I here at this present, banish all
foul and foreign affections, all self and interessed love, and whatsoever is
contrary to thy divine liking; and embrace thy only naked Charity, with as much
ardour and sincerity, as all my united forces and faculties can possibly enable
me.

Rule thou henceforth, and reign only in my soul (O glorious King of Love!) Let
nothing live but to love thee, and praise thy liberality; to manifest thy
goodness, and to magnify thy glory. O Love! O divine and desirable Treasure! O
rich and precious Jewel! What Soul reflects upon thy real value, and suddenly
sells not all to buy thee; leaves not all to follow thee; suffers not all to
enjoy thee; contemns not all to compass thee?

How late do I love thee, O beauty so ancient, so new! Ah my heart! thou have
hitherto loved thy self truly; will thou remain evermore cold, careless, tepid,
and negligent in loving that object, for which only thou were created, and
which alone can make thee happy!

Ah perfect Lover! my Soul now settles her self to love thee only, entirely,
eternally; she will recompense her former failing, by her future faithfulness;
she defies all branches of Self-love, she desires nothing in Heaven or Earth,
but thy self, her God, her inheritance, the only joy of her heart, and sweet
satisfaction of all her wishes.

But (O sweet Savior!) what pawn of this my love shall I leave with thee; what
pledge of my sincere affection shall I give thee? Thou have asked my heart: Take
it, Lord Jesu! [2] Take it alone: [3] Take it all unto thee. [4] Take it as
thine own due and my free donation. [5] Take it, as the present of a Child to
his Father. [6] Take it, as an holocaust offered up only to please, praise, and
obey thee: and not in respect of thy present benefits, or expected blessings.
[7] Take it, O loving Lord! as thou desire it, deservest it, demandest it,
and command it.

O that I had as many Hearts and Souls in my body, as I have Hairs on my head,
that I might thus dedicate them all to thy divine Love!

Oh! that I could employ each moment of my remaining time, in loving thee as
perfectly as thy glorious Citizens do in Heaven! Oh! that the very last act of
my expiring life, (which I now consecrate unto thee,) might be by virtue of
this my oblation and resolution, an ecstasy of thy pure and perfect Love!

Lord! I love thee; thou know that I love thee; how much I love thee; and
how ardent my desires are to love thee more: I will not leave to love thee,
till thy love transforms me all into love; which is thy self! O Eternal Love,
Eternal Life, Eternal Happiness.

The fifth Exercise. Of the Cardinal Virtues, and first of Prudence.
1. The Essence of Prudence.
Prudence is an Intellectual Virtue, enabling us to Consult wisely, Judge
solidly, and Resolve effectually upon all occasions of action or omission.
GReat and Glorious Lord God! who ever accompaniest thy Judgments with Equity,
and accomplishest all thy works with prudence and perfection; grant unto me thy
poor servant, (here prostrate before thy tribunal of infinite Majesty,) a
competent portion of this most exquisit and necessary Virtue. O let it be still
present at all my proceedings, assistant to all my resolutions, and chief
president over all my counsel; that being by it powerfully swayed, instructed,
and directed, I may know how, when, where, to act, omit, consult, judge, order,
and execute wisely, uprightly, discreetly, undauntedly, all that which is
conformable to thy divine will and liking.

O thrice happy they, who have attained the perfection of this amiable Virtue!
My Soul submits to thee, O sacred Prudence! as to her directing Mistress and
commanding Queen; that by thy safe conduct she may pass onward in the holy
track of true piety, advance daily in the practice of all solid virtues, and
arrive finally at thee, O my God! my eternal bliss and beatitude, the only end
and aim of all her hopes and endeavors.

2. The Parts of Prudence.
Prudence must have eight parts to make it perfect: Memory, Understanding,
Docility, Subtility, Reason, Providence, Circumspectioo, Precaution.
AH, my poor Soul! how far art thou from solid Wisdom, since thou art destitute
of all the requisite qualities and conditions! Thou (O Divine and undrainable
fountain of all knowledge!) who freely openest the veins of Wisdom to them who
humbly confess their own indigence, and heartily implore thy heavenly
assistance: Distill (I beseech thee) these several rivulets into my imprudent,
indiscreet, and ignorant spirit; that I may be more capable upon all occasions
to discern between verity and vanity, and distinguish good from evil; that so
making Virtue the sole measure of all my desires and doings, my life may be
here pleasing to thy Majesty; and my Soul after death, may enjoy thee in thy
blessed Eternity.

3. The chief effects of Prudence are these, 1. It helps us to discover and
avoid our enemies ambushes. 2. It is the sustainer, director, moderator, and
conserver of all virtues. 3. It is the light, by which we see how to guide our
steps toward our heavenly home.
O That my Soul could always feel the admirable fruits and effects of this
amiable Virtue! O that I could dispose all my thoughts, desires, affections,
words, and actions, according to the dictamen of Discretion! O that I could
still consult maturely, judge discreetly, and execute virtuously upon all
important occasions! Give me, O Eternal Wisdom! Circumspection to discern my
enemies deceits, that I may shun them: Give me Prudence of Heart, to remember
things past, dispose of things present, and provide for things to come; Give me
Prudence of Mouth, to moderate all my Speeches; Give me Prudence of Action, to
cancel all evil, and choose what is laudable. And since, (O my Lord!) there can
be no Virtue without Prudence; which gives them order, form, beauty, and all
that denominates them rather Virtues than Vices; Since this is the Salt, which
thou command to be offered in all Sacrifices, whereby they become favoury to
thy sacred Majesty: O grant, that I may be henceforth truly prudent, discreet,
and well advised in all my enterprises, that so I may in all things more
perfectly please thee.

4. The Vices directly opposite to Prudence.
Though all Vices and Sins are opposite to Prudence; yet Temerity or
Precipitation, Inconsideration, Inconstancy, and Negligence, are its greatest
enemies, and more directly destroy it.
WAtch, and Pray, O my weak Soul! that thou fall not into these precipices. Ah,
how often have thou been hitherto dashed against these dangerous Rocks? and
what mervail, if thou still remain'st so weak, wounded, wicked; that thou lie
yet wallowing in the mire of sin, and art almost drowned in the deluge of thy
sensuality, without making any progress in the way of the spirit, since thou
runnest on hood-winck'd, headlong, blindly, rashly, without consulting or
considering the end and order of thy actions? How long will thou defer through
Negligence, or desist through Inconstancy, to effect what Prudence persuades
thee as most convenient, commendable, and conducing to thy desired happiness?
Direct me henceforth (O divine and essential Wisdom!) and preserve me from
relapses into these dismal gulfs of rashness, inconsideration, inconstancy, and
negligence; Let the whole design of my pious practice by thy only honor, and
the perfection of thy holy Love in my Soul, that being here united to thee, it
may hereafter enjoy thee in thy Eternal Glory.

5. Other Vices opposite, (though not so directly) to Prudence; are those which
are contrary to its several parts: Forgetfulness, Ignorance, Indocibility,
Stupidity, Want of Reason, Improvidence, Incircumspection, and Vnwariness.
HElp me, (O my Lord, my only refuge, and buckler of defense!) to conquer all
these enormous monsters: Draw me powerfully out of these deluges of
imperfections, wherein either my natural weakness, or my malicious wickedness
have so frequently implung'd me, and do yet daily and dangerously engage me:
Dissipate, I beseech thee, these dark clouds with the infused light of thy
divine Grace: Indue my forgetful, ignorant, stupid spirit, with Docility to
receive my Superiors Counsels and Commands; with Solicitude for my Souls
eternal safety; with Providence, Precaution, and all other necessary Weapons
against the wiles of my adversaries; that leading a life free from Vice, I may
expect Deaths call without terror.

6. Other Vices opposite to prudence (by excess, as the former were by defect)
are; The Wisdom of the flesh, Craft, Deceit, Fraud, an over-eager carefulness
for temporal conveniences, and too much solicitude for the future.
AH sick World! how sad and deplorable is thy condition! All is full of fleshly
Prudence, Persidiousness, and perpetual Perplexity; Each one seeks for poor and
soon passing commodities of nature; but the eternal treasures laid up in Heaven
for our immortal Souls, are little looked after! Ay me! shall the children of
darkness be more Prudent in their Generation, than thou, (my Soul!) who
pretendest to be an infant of Light? Will thou be less covetous of Spiritual
grace, than worldlings are of Temporal goods? O what a shame, what a confusion
is it, that they should more fervently affect things pernicious, than thou the
profitable; that they should run more nimbly to their death and ruin, than
thou to life and beatitude!

Away then, with these false, feigned, pretended and worldly Wisdoms: I will
henceforth follow thy sweet invitation, (O Saviviour of my Soul!) and be no
more solicitous, what I shall eat and drink, or wherewith I shall be clothed:
I will only seek thy Kingdom; and for the rest, rely upon thy care, and remain
quiet, content and comforted with thy paternal Providence.

7. The Conclusion of this Exercise, containing an humble Petition for perfect
and Evangelicall Prudence.
O Savior, the great Exemplar and pure Idea of all Wisdom! who have taught me
by thine own sacred mouth, what Prudence is most pleasing to thy Divine
Majesty; saying, Be ye wise as Serpents, and simple as Doves; Enlarg (I beseech
thee) my heart, soul, and affections, to receive, retain, and practice this
heavenly Lesson.

Give me (O my gracious Lord God!) the Serpent's prudence, precaution,
sagacity, subtilty: He has a piercing and ever open Eye to prevent and avoid
danger; He exposes his Body, to secure his Head; He shuts his Ears to delude
the Charmers cunning; He casts his Skin, to renew his decaying Age: Grant me,
(O Lord) by this example, a quick-sightedness to discover my enemies deceits;
Teach me to preserve my Head (which is my Faith in thee, my Creator) and
undauntedly to expose my Body, Goods, All, for the just defense thereof; Let me
wisely and warily stop up the windows of my Heart and Senses, from admitting
the sly suggestions of my enchanting Concupiscence: And let me finally despoil
my self of the old man, and re-vest my Soul with the new garment of thy Grace,
Love, Justice and Verity.

And lest Wisdom alone should degenerate into Malice; give me also, (O meek and
debonnair Jesu!) the Doves simplicity, sweetness, innocence, purity; she
neither wrongs other Birds, nor revenges her own injuries; she is without Gall,
envy, and bitterness; she loves to bath and glass her self in the clearest
Waters; she testifies her ardent affection by her perpetual sighs; and having
lost her Mate, she remains free from all future embraces. O that I could
perfectly imitate this Mildness toward all men! Let me never more (O my sweet
Savior! strive to vindicate, defend, or excuse my self; never more render evil
for evil; never more retain the least grudg against my enemies, never more
covet any pleasures, but such as are permitted; O let me still sigh after thee,
(the only Spouse of my Soul!) testifying thereby how little I prize this place
of banishment; how much I long and languish after thy lovely presence; how
deeply I am disgusted with all degenerate Affections; and how highly I disdain
all things which aim not directly at thy Divine Love and Glory.

O simple Subtilty, and subtle Simplicity! that I could jointly compass you!
how purely should I live to my God? how peaceably in my Self? how pleasingly to
my Neighbor? Lord! let the happy Nuptials between the Serpent and the Dove be
celebrated in my Soul; never more to be divorced, either by carnal cunning, or
brutish stupidity.

O let my Conversation be henceforth holy and harmless; my Actions devoid of
folly and vanity; and my whole Life led on, (through the intricate mazes and by
ways of this wicked world) by the conducting Clew of Evangelical Prudence and
Discretion to a blessed death. Thus living, thus dying, I shall finally and
infallibly be joined to my JESU! the only end of all endeavors, (to whom I
desire to live, and in whom I hope to die,) in thy glorious Eternity.

The sixth Exercise. Of Justice, the second Cardinal Virtue.
1. The Essence of Justice.
Justice is a Moral Virtue, inclining our Wills to give every one his due by
lawful means. Several sorts of Justice.
O Most excellent and universal Virtue! Were thou exactly observed, how soon
would all complaints, controversies, and contentions cease amongst the children
of men? How happy and holy an Order would be established and followed in the
world? Our dread Sovereign enjoying his due Honors, and his creatures the
respective Rights which appertain to them! Whence is it, (O rare Virtue! which
art the very tie and cement of the whole Universe!) that thou art not more
strong and powerful in the hearts or all rational Beings?

Thou, ( O prime and essential Equity! who have placed Justice amongst the
first of thy Precepts; saying, Thou shall justly do that which is just: Grant
thou command, and let it flourish gloriously in my soul, that I may exactly
return thy own gifts to thy eternal glory.

O my Soul! with how many obligations art thou charged! Give me, (O great and
glorious King of Justice!) a discerning Spirit to comply with them all; and
permit me not to invade any creatures just prerogatives. Let me no longer covet
to possess what appertains not to me. Ah! how contemptible are all earthly
Commodities, farther than they either profit me, in order to my Souls
perfection, or relate (O my God!) to thy eternal glory? Alas! they will neither
accompany me in Death, nor comfort me in Judgment, nor assist me in Hell. Ah
wordlings! how ill advised Bankers are you; who endeavoring to gain Earthly
treasures, endanger the eternal loss of your own Souls?

2. Of Religion the Sister of Justice.
Religion is a Moral Virtue, inclining us to render unto God that Sovereign
worship which is due to him, by reason of his Excellency and Dominion over all
things. This Worship consists in diverse Acts; whereby we declare Gods supreme
excellency, and our humble subjection and servitude. The Acts are either
Interior, as Devotion, Prayer, Vows; or Exterior, as Sacrifice, Adorations,
Genu flections, Praises, Protestations, Oblations, Tithes, the use of the
Sacraments, and briefly, the practice of all Virtues: All which actions, are
due to Gods infinite and adorable Dignity.
HOw necessary is this Virtue for the advancement of thy honor, ( O mighty
Monarch of Heaven and Earth! O that thou would be pleased to implant it
deeply in my Soul, that I might perpetually praise thee, always adore thee,
and continually content thee with all thy just dues; if nor as devoutly as thy
divine Excellencies deserve, yet as much as thy Precept obliges me, and my
weakness and poverty permit me. Confirm, (great God!) thine own glorious
Kingdom; re-take thy true Dominion in my heart; make use of thine own just
rights and prerogatives, and powerfully draw from me and all thy creatures, as
much Religious duty, service, homage and honor, as our Natures (assisted and
elevated by thy Grace,) are capable to render thee.

Which way, (O my weak Soul!) will thou satisfy all these duties? O that my
Religion were thus active, and my Will thus operative! O Jesu, my Savior! who
gave to God thy Father all his dues in a most divine manner, and satisfiedst
in rigor of Justice, for all my irreligiousness? look compassionatly upon thy
needy and naked creature, and lift up my nothing to a capacity of rendering in
some measure, the worship and honor appertaining to thy immense and infinite
Majesty: Make me (O my merciful Redeemer!) truly Religious; dispose me with
courage to serve thee, with constancy to confess thy greatness, with humility
to acknowledge my own indigency, with fervor to practice all Acts of Virtue,
and with perseverance to perform all thy Precepts; that Thou, (O my God, my
Lord, my All!) may be always honored by me, ever praised in me, and
perpetually pleased with me.

O let me never imagine, to have satisfied the smallest parcel of that debt,
which is by so many titles due to thy divine excellency and dignity: For what,
alas! is the best of my service, homage, and gratitude, in respect of thy
goodness toward me, and thy greatness in thy self? O dread Sovereign! for
whose only glory, I and all creatures were placed in this world: when shall we
unanimously conspire and correspond to this thy sacred design? when shall we
worthily perform and perfectly practice what thou so justly deservest,
desire, demandest and command.

3. Of Devotion, the chief Act of Religion; and of Prayer, the next unto it.
Devotion is the prime and proper act of Religion; inclining our Wills to
embrace actually and readily all that concerns Gods service, and to avoid all
that displeases him. Prayer is an Act of Religion, whereby we humbly ask of
God, such things as are fit to be asked,
O Sweet and sacred Devotion, the dear and only minion of my Soul! how tenderly
do I love thee? how ardently do I desire thee? and yet how unworthy am I to
enjoy thee? Thou (O my glorious Sovereign!) art the supreme cause of all
Devotion, and thy grace is the original Source of all piety: Thou art the only
good which my way faring and thirsty Soul incessantly gapes after; Thou art the
solid support and solace of her weakness and weariness; Thou art the dilater of
all devout hearts, by the infusion of good desires into them: Take from me, (I
beseech thee) the love of the world, clear my thoughts from curiosities and
superfluities; break the fetters which wrest my affection to vanities, and fix
them entirely upon thy self, my only amiable and satisfying Object.

Behold, (O immense Deity, O eternal, infinite, and essential goodness; who
deservest all perfect homage and honor, all possible duty and devotion from me
and all rational creatures; who art in thy self so absolutely excellent and
admirable, and to my Soul so highly bountiful and beneficial! I here most
humbly, promptly, cordially, freely and resolutely, Consecrate the whole
residue of my life and actions, to be totally employed in thy true love and
service. O let me never swerve from this solid and substantial Devotion; let me
rest joyful and content in this my advised choice, and be no more contristated,
troubled, or dejected, in the faithful prosecution of such works as belong to
my duty and thy divine honor. Dilate my heart, O Lord, with holy cheerfulness,
and I will run on swiftly, sweetly, perseverantly, in the paths of thy
Commandments.

I confess (O glorious Creator!) my own Misery, and that I stand in perpetual
need of thy Mercy; and therefore I will daily present my self before thy
supreme Majesty, as a poor, needy, and naked Beggar; as a weak wounded and
wicked Sinner; hoping that thou (O pious Physician!) wilt heal and help, pity
and pardon, cure and comfort my sick, sinful and sorrowful Soul.

O that my Heart and Mouth, were absolutely purified from all undecent
affections, and superfluous expressions in my Prayer! O that my spirit could
always propose devoutly, and my tongue pronounce distinctly such wholesome
things in my petitions, as are proper for me to expect from thy infinite
Majesty! O that I could thus piously, and perseverantly, present my Prayers to
thy Throne of Grace, with all the necessary Circumstances to obtain thy mercy!

My Resolution (O heavenly Maker!) is to ask nothing henceforth of thy divine
Majesty, but the entire accomplishment of thy Holy Will, or that which may in
some manner serve and contribut to the increase of thy honor and glory: and if
I fail of thy present answer to all other my pretentions, I will humbly
acknowledge my desires to have been Undue and Unreasonable; and resting
peaceably in thy presence, I will adore the depths of thy inscrutable Prudence,
and rely securely upon the sweetness of thy secret and paternal Providence.

Teach me (O Divine Master!) thus to pray, with a resigned spirit, and purified
intention; and encourage me to practice purely, perfectly, perseverantly thy
heavenly instruction, in demanding first thy eternal Kingdom, and them not
doubting the sufficient supply of all temporal conveniences.

4. Of Adoration, another Act of Religion.
Adoration as an Act of Religion, whereby we testify our submission, to the
divine Majesty, acknowledging his supreme excellency, and our absolute
dependancy upon him. A perfect f^rm of Oblation to the Divine Majesty.
O Great, glorious, admirable, eternal Lord God! What creature can comprehend
or conceive the least of thy purities and perfections? What honors, homages,
respects and reverences are due to thee, (O Dread Sovereign of heaven and
earth, on whom all things created depend; in whom, I have both breath and
being!) O that I and all creatures could truly descend into our Nothing, that
thy only glorious and essential being might appear and shine more brightly!

O increated and independent Entity! without whose present and continual
support, all things would instantly cease to be what they are by thy bounty,
and slide away into their original nothing! how can I place my self low enough
in the presence of thy infinite Majesty?

Behold, I humbly adore thy sublime Excellencies, from the bottomless depth of
my abyssal nothing: I heartily worship thee (my Sovereign Creator!) in spirit
and truth: I lowly prostrate my poor Soul, before the high Altar of thy immense
greatness; faithfully, dutifully and devoutly acknowledging thy divine power,
and submitting my whole being to thy absolute supremacy.

Ay! how barren are my Affections? How bare, short and filly my Expressions?
How unproportionable my Adorations, in respect of thy supereminent, surpassing,
unexplicable, and unconceivable Excellencies? I therefore present thee (O
glorious Deity!) with all the interior actions of the blessed humanity of thy
Son, my Savior Jesus; I offer unto thee, with all possible submission and
devotion, in supply of my weakness, the perfect acts of love, praise,
adoration, which proceeded from the pure Virgin Mother, and from all the
Saints, with all the hearts and affections of Angels and Men; all the mental
excesses, supernatural jubilations, total abnegations, and amorous unions of
all blessed Souls in heaven and earth.

Ah! that my heart alone were capable of all the united affections and
perfections of all creatures! how willingly (O my God!) would I employ them all
in thy service? How sweetly should I melt away in thy love? Receive, (gracious
Lord!) all these, and whatsoever may be offered unto thee, as my ardent desires
of honor, adoration, loyalty, and gratitude, due to thy infinite Majesty. O
that I could present them unto thee, as frequently as I breath, and as
fervently as the highest Seraphins! I invite and conjure you with heart and
mouth, (O all ye celestial Spirits, and elevated Souls!) to supply my defects
and desires, and to sacrifice to my God, holocausts of praise, benediction,
adoration, ardently, incessantly, eternally.

Accept these homages and oblations, (O sovereign Creator!) from thy meanest
creature, which accepts thee, embraces thee, and makes choice of thee this day,
this hour, this instant, and for all Eternity, for her God; and refuses all
other Lords for thy only love: to thee be rendered all honor, praise,
adoration, and reverence from her and all things that have a being, now and for
evermore.

5. Three Neighbour-Virtues to Justice, are, Piety, Observance, and Obedience.
Piety is a Moral Virtue, whereby we render to our Parents, Kindred, Country,
and Friends, the just duties of honor and acknowledgment. Observance is a
Moral Virtue, whereby we treat with them who excel us in Dignity, with due
reverence and respect. Obedience is a Moral Virtue, whereby our Wills are
carried on to accomplish the things commanded, because they are commanded.
O Savior! the most exact pattern of all perfection! who so highly honouredst
thy heavenly Father, and were so humbly subject to thy earthly Parents; not
forgetting thy dear Mother in the very dreadful agony of they death: Give me
natural meekness, benignity and bowels melting away with Piety, and Compassion,
that I may not fail in the least tittle of my duty toward my distressed
Neighbor, or them to whom I stand any way engaged.

All thy Actions (O dear Redeemer!) are my instructions: grant therefore that I
may in this Virtue of Observance also become thy perfect Imitator; who
willingly gave honor to the Priests, Scribes, Doctors, and all people placed
in Authority: O let me be ever ready to bow to my Betters, submit to my
Superiors, and reverence all persons eminent in power, signal in piety, and
excellent in virtue, as nearer Images to thy Divinity, whence all Authority,
and goodness is derived.

O Divine Obedience! that the world would embrace thee in their several
Callings and Conditions! how much more justly, discreetly, and easily would it
be regulated and governed? Infuse it (O supreme Commander of all Creatures!)
into the hearts of all thy Children; drive out from amongst them a^ rebellions,
murmurings, and mutinies: That Christians obeying their Pastors; Children their
Parent; Servants their Masters; Subjects their Princes; Religious persons their
Prelates; Thou (O great and glorious Lord God!) may be perfectly pleased with
them all in this world, and eternally praised by them in the world to come.

6. Three other Virtues annexed to Justice: Gratitude, Truth, Affability.
Gratitude is a Moral Virtue, inclining us to render good to them who have done
us courtesies, not being obliged thereto. Truth is a Moral Virtue, whereby we
show in our words what we are in our lives, without either feigning, adding, or
diminishing. Affability is a Moral Virtue, whereby we carry our selves sweetly,
both in words and actions, toward them we converse with.
WHat shall I render thee (O my gracious Lord God!) for all the good things
thou have given me? Thou most freely, liberally, and unconstrainedly, chargest
me with thy mercies, inchainest me with thy benefits, and loadest me wi hy thy
love. I thank thee (O bountiful bestower of all blessings!) for them all, both
natural and supernatural, for all the good actions which (by thy help) I have
effected; the good words I have uttered; the good thoughts I have conceived: I
thank thee for expecting me to Penance, calling me to thy Service, preserving
me from deserved Damnation, by the death of thy dear Son: And in acknowledgment
of these and all other thy innumerable favors, (O great Benefactor!) I
gratefully give thee my heart, soul, and all that (by thy grace) I have and am,
for perfect sacrifices of thy perpetual praise.

O hypocrisy, duplicity, and falsehood! (the dangerous and universal Diseases
of this deceitful world!) how sincerely does my Soul abhor you? Give me thy
powerful grace (O God of truth!) to eschew these great evils. O guide and
govern my tongue, not only from forging false testimonies against my Neighbor,
and uttering irreligious expressions against thy Honor; but even from the
least Lie in my words, Infidelity in my promises, Hypocrisy in my behavior,
or Dissimulation in any of my doings, upon any pretension of humane prudence,
or intention of piety whatsoever. O let my Heart walk simply, singly,
sincerely, innocently and unfeignedly in thy presence; and let my Tongue, Hands
and Behavior, be conformable to my heart; that Truth making up a holy harmony
in my whole man, I may perfectly please thee here, (O increated Verity!) and
joyfully praise thee in thy blessed Eternity.

Purify, (O meek and merciful Redeemer!) my whole life and actions, my carriage
and conversation; and give me grace to look always upon the perfect pattern of
thy lovely comportment amongst all men, so full of Mildness, Mercy, Affability
and Curtisie. O that I could behave my self temperatly, discreetly, lovingly,
gently, quietly, contentedly, sweetly and saintly toward all sorts of people
upon earth, till it shall please thy goodness (O my gracious God!) to translate
my peaceable spirit to the more amiable company of thy eternally blessed
Saints, and heavenly Inhabitants.

7. Three other companions of Justice: Friendship, Liberality, Equity.
Friendship is a Moral Virtue; whereby two (or more) persons, profess
reciprocal love to each other, for their mutual help and support in the pursuit
of Virtue. Liberallity, is a Moral Virtue, whereby we make moderate use of our
temporal means; and impart them freely to others. Equity is a Moral Virtue;
inclining us rather to follow the intention of Law makers or Superiors, upon
good grounds; than the precise Letter of their Laws.
O Eternal Creator!) who art the first Origin, and should be the only End of
all Friendship who producedst all this worlds perfections, to induce our Souls
by these gracious benefits, to the love of thy great bounty! Imprint (I humbly
pray thee!) first, thine own holy love, with indelible characters in my heart;
Then impart unto me also this virtuous, comfortable, and innocent Amity, (which
is the legitimat child of Charity, and undivided companion of Justice) of some
spiritual person; capable to counsel me, willing to direct me, courageous to
correct me, and desirous to perfect me in thy love and service.

O my Lord God! all Love, all Liberality! who showrest down Benefits, and
profusest Mercies without measure, upon all thy creatures: Elevate my poverty,
to imitate (in some manner, proportionable to the means thou have graciously
lent me,) thy infinite Bounty: Give me (O my glorious maker!) a noble and
generous Mind, disengaged from base and earthly thoughts, and disposed to high
and heroic actions, aiming at my own Souls Perfection, my Neighbors Profit,
and thy divine Praise and Honor. O let my Eyes be ever open to consider
seriously; my Heart ever willing to compassionate tenderly; and my Hands ever
ready to contribute liberally to the just necessities of thy creatures: That
making the right use of the temporal goods which thou have here graciously
given me; I may finally attain to the eternal glory, which thou (my good God!)
have elsewhere bountifully prepared for me.

How needful is thy infused Prudence, (O Sacred Spirit, the sweet and only
light of my Soul!) and how necessary is thy special gift of Counsel, that I
mistake not in managing of this Virtue Equity? and so either out of Temerity,
misinterpret my Superiors meaning; or out of Timidity unduly execute his
command? Clear my Darkness, (O all knowing Lord God!) with a ray of thy divine
splendor, conduct my Reason in the right way, and keep my Understanding from
error, amidst the millions of labyrinths, many bypath, and dangerous
obscurities, which occur in cases of Conscience, and Moral Resolutions: Conform
my will and works to thy sacred intention; and confirm me in my present
purpose: which is, to observe perfectly thy most just and and holy Ordinances,
(and all theirs whom thou have placed over my head) in that very manner, (both
in substance and circumstance) as thou (O supreme Lawmakers!) demandest and
command.

The Seventh Exercise. Of Fortitude, the third Cardinal Virtue.
1. The Essence of Fortitude.
Fortitude is a Moral Virtue, enabling our Wills to do good, and avoid evil, in
great and dreadful difficulties and dangers: So that we either expect them, or
suffer them, or shun them, or set upon them without excessive Fear, or over
rash Boldness.
MY Life (O my Lord!) is a perpetual warfare; my Soul is beset, during this her
pilgrimage, with innumerable, enormous, powerful, and implacable enemies; so
that I am forced either to fight and conquer, or to fall and be conquered. O
how greatly then do I stand in need of this glorious armor of Fortitude, to
animate my fearfulness, to shelter my feebleness, temper my rashness, and to
accompany me in all my dangerous skirmishes? Give this virtuous strength to thy
weak (yet willing) servant, O my God, who art incomparable in power, invincible
in might, the great Lord of Hosts, the glorious overcomer in the day of battle,
the shield and salvation of all them that combat under thy banner! and I shall
not fear thousands of foes encompassing me; for I can do all things in thee my
comforter.

2. The chief degrees of Fortitude are three.
1. Not to be affrighted at the great difficulties, wherewith we must
necessarily encounter in our spiritual course: but to be resolute in suffering
them; manful in setting on them; yea, and confident to conquer them, through
Gods assisting grace. 2. To rejoice cordially in such sufferings, for so good a
cause. 3. To expose our selves courageously to all calamities, for the
promotion of Gods glory, and our Neighbors spiritual good.
O Thrice happy those Souls, which are thus valiant! Ah! shall I for want of a
little courage be an eternal slave to Sin, Satan, Sensuality? Arise to my aid
(O invincible King of Glory!) under whose feet, Death, Devils, and Hell it self
do groan. And thou (my Soul!) what dreadest thou! advance thy self undauntedly
into the field of battle: Thou fightest under thy Saviors Ensigns, who has
already conquered thy foes for thee, upon his sacred Cross: Reflect upon what
thou art, his Soldier, his Servant, his Son: Lose not heart, nor hope in thy
just quarrel; since thy Lord looks upon thy just combats, invites thee to
courage, assists thee to conquer, and expects to crown thee: Eternity is at
stake, and Heaven thy reward.

3. Martyrdom, (the most heroic act Fortitude) is a voluntary acceptance and
enduring of a violent Death, for the testimony and defense of the true Faith,
or of Virtue.
ALL hail, O ye valiant Champions of my heavenly King! how highly does my heart
prize your courage? how humbly does my soul honor and emulate your constancy?
were not your Bodies passible as mine is; and your Material parts molded out of
the same mass of Clay, by the same merciful and powerful Artificer? Whence is
it then, that you appeared so faithful in your hottest trials, and I prove so
fearful in my least temptations? O I am utterly ashamed of my own former
baseness, and I resolutly and readily offer up my self to die here for thy sake
(O my sweet Savior!) that I may live in thy love eternally.

4. Three Virtues allied to Fortitude; Magnanimity, Patience, Perseverance.
Magnanimity (or greatness of courage) is a Moral Virtue, and inclining our
Wills to heroic and honorable actions in the prosecution of Virtue: in as
much as such actions are hard, and worthy of an high Courage.
THou have made me (O glorious Creator!) for great matters, for thy Heaven, for
thy self: and shall I rest any longer in petty trifles, and aim only at
inglorious objects? No (my worthy Soul!) formed to thy Lords lovely likeness,
Child of the most high, and Heir apparent to his kingdom! It becoms not thee to
content thy self with common Perfection: We will henceforth have higher
thoughts, and aspire to more sublime, generous, and noble enterprises: We will
courageously climb up the several degrees of the most seraphical Virtues; and
set upon holy and honorable works tending to our own greater good, and our
Gods eternal glory. Yes Lord! we desire to be as truly patient as thy servant
Job; as zealous of thine honor, as thy Apostle Paul; as penitent for our sins,
as the pious Magdalen: as pure in our life, as the holy Angels; and as ardent
in thy love, as the highest Seraphins. O my Soul! that we could reach these
glorious Perfections!

5. Patience is a Moral Virtue, which moderates our Sadness, proceeding from
the resentment of some present evil; and hinders us from acting thereupon, any
thing misbecoming our Reason.
O My Soul! what joy, what peace, what holiness, what happiness do still
accompany any this divine Virtue? when will thou truly possess thy self, and
perfectly please thy Savior, by the exact practice of Patience amidst all thy
pressures, troubles and tribulations? O why should thou only expect to be a
delicate member, under Christ thy head crowned with cruel thorns? Lord Jesu! I
must suffer as a Christian, I deserve to suffer as a Sinner, I desire to suffer
as thy Servant: O let not my suffrances become lost to my soul, by my
impatience in enduring them: Let no torment or trouble of my life, tire my
settled resolution of suffering willingly for thy love (O my crucified Savior!)
and persevering constantly in thy service. Let Hell, Death and Devil, arm their
whole fury against me; Let all creatures conspire to annoy me; Let all sickness
seize on my body, all sadness on my Soul, and all sorts of damages, disgraces,
and dismal chances be poured forth upon my only head, I will remain quiet in
thee (O meek and patient Jesu!) and submissive to thy sweet providence and
disposition.

6. Perseverance is a Moral Virtue, whereby we go on in our well begun
enterprises, till they are fully accomplished.
THis is the Virtue (O my Soul!) and this only which gives thee true rest from
all thy sufferings; This rewards all thy laborious endeavors; and this puts a
happy period to thy painful life. Without Perseverance, how vain are all thy
Virtues, and how useless thy past labors and diligence! Ah! my Soul! be no
longer like a Fool, changeable with the Moon; like a Reed, shaken with every
Blast; like the Sensualists, who begin in the spirit, but end in the flesh. No,
my dear Lord! I will never leave to love thee till I leave to live; I will not
cease to persecute my passions, and pursue the enemies of my perfection till
they be all dead and utterly destroyed: I will keep the years of Eternity ever
fresh in my memory, that no temporary sufferings may seem long, tedious, or
troublesome. Thou (O Jesu my Redeemer, O most constant lover of my poor Soul,
for whose sake thou patiently remainedst on thy cruel Cross, till the whole work
of Redemption was perfectly consummated!) make me (I most humbly beseech thee)
constant in virtue, courageous in thy Love, faithful in my Calling, and
perseverant in thy Service, that I may be finally crowned in thy heavenly
Kingdom.

7. The Conclusion of this Exercise: humbly petitioning for perfect and
Christian Fortitude.
BUt what is my strength, (O my gracious Lord God!) that I should be able to
resist, fight, conquer, and persever? Ah! my weakness! how well art thou known
to me, and how much better to she (O my all knowing Creator!) Fortify
therefore my frailty, (O my only hope and helper!) against the vast multitudes
of enemies, which compass me round about, striving to devour my poor soul, and
still plotting to deprive me of thy divine favor and friendship. Let no labor
tire me, ( O my Lord, my Virtue, my Fortitude! nor difficulty terrify me, nor
danger daunt me, nor any thing whatsoever draw me from one title of thy true
love, or make me degenerate in the least degree from my well settled-resolution
of going on faithfully, cheerfully, perseverantly in thy service. Ah! Shall the
lovers of honors, pleasures, riches, and such like worldly trash and trifles,
be more valiant, vigilant, vigorous, than I am, who love thee, O true treasury
of all goodness; O indeficient fountain of all felicity? Shall these greedy
slaves (rather than generous lovers) take such pains and care to purchase a
lie, a smoke, a vanity; and shall not I courageously fight, sweat, bleed, die
to possess thee, O my essential, substantial, eternal Happiness and Beatitude!

Yes Lord! I will joyfully undergo all things for thy Love: I will esteem it,
as a singular honor, not only to suffer, but to be sacrificed for thy sake:
only assist me with thy grace, and support me with thy strength; which is the
Armor of proof, wherein I place my whole Confidence, and the sure ground upon
which I boldly give defiance to all my enemies; the Buckler, wherewith I doubt
not but to defend my self in the day of battle; and the impregnable Fort,
wherein I can only hope for safety against all assaults made from without, by
the Prince of this world, and powers of darkness. To this secure Sanctuary, (O
my God!) I will humbly, continually, and confidently make my retreat, during
this my warfare and pilgrimage; in expectation of being admitted, (according to
the time prefixed by thy holy will and pleasure,) to thy blessed City of Peace;
where finding no more Battails to fight; nor Sieges to sustain; nor Enemies to
conquer, I will joyfully hang up the Trophe's of thine, and my Victory, and
eternally sing forth the praises of thy glorious and triumphant Majesty.

The eighth Exercise. Of Temperance, the fourth Cardinal Virtue.
1. The Essence of Temperance.
Temperance in general, is a Moral Virtue; retaining us within the the limits
of Reason, amidst the difficulties which arise from the delights of our five
corporal Senses.
O My Lord! (the eternal and essential Purity!) who commanded me thy frail and
feeble servant, to live soberly, piously, justly, purely, temperatly, in the
world, and to abstain from all things which defile my Soul, wherein thy self
desire to take thy chaste pleasure and delight: Give me (I beseech thee) a
true sense of thy spiritual and solid sweetness, wean me and win me from all
affections to sin, strengthen me against the allurements of sensuality, and
wound me with thy only pure and perfect Love. O let not the poor pleasures of
flesh and blood prevail any longer over my Reason! Let not my Senses get the
Empire over my Heart, and dispossess thee of thy there desired habitation.

Ah, my disordered Appetites! my deceive'd Affections! my depraved Desires!
Tell me; is this Creature, this Object, this worldly Bubble, which witholds you
from your heavenly Creator, better than he is, worthier to be preferred, more
lovely in your sight, more deserving in it self, or more beneficial to you!
Speak my seduced Soul! Do thou expect ever to be quieted by enjoining it? at
the hour of Death, will it defend thee? in the day of thy Judgment and Gods
wrath, will it plead for thee, and protect thee? Is it able to make thee here
Holy, and eternally Happy? Alas! nothing less. Ah then! What blindness, what
bruitishness, what madness is it, to leave God, and love it; to forsake God,
and adhere to it? No, my Lord; thou art more to me than all, I love thee above
all, and for thy sake I freely forsake all.

I know, Lord! that the Eye is never satisfied with seeing; the Ear with
hearing; the Mind with possessing; nor the Soul with loving any thing but thee,
her only amiable and satisfying Object! I acknowledge the best of sensual
pleasures, to be poor, mean, short in durance, nothing in substance: Why then,
O my Senses! do you still roam abroad? Why beat you the air for vanities, and
seek after lies! Why, O my Soul! do thou persevere to covet that which thou
cofessest can never perfectly content thee? Curb all these disorders (O my
God!) with the bridle of discreet Temperance: Teach me to use thy Creatures
with Sobriety; to be always at defiance with worldly Delights; and to be
totally taken up with the real solid pleasures which proceed only from thy
ravishing Love, and sweet presence in my Soul.

2. The Rules of Temperance are these:
1. The Law of God, Ordinances of his Church, and Orders of our Superiors. 2.
The Necessities of our lives, according to our estates, offices, means,
conditions, dispositions. 3. Decency, which is a love of that which well
beseems us. 4. Shamefacedness, which is a certain fear and horror against all
that is contrary to a just Moderation: For nothing is more opposite to man's
Dignity, than to mistake himself in making use of corporal Delights.
O My Savior! the incomparable pattern of Temperance! These Rules, shall be
henceforth the Laws of my life: I will be ashamed to be any longer like the
Horse and Mule, which are devoid of understanding; but will rationally make use
of thy gifts, in order to support my self for thy only service, I will not
covet what may serve for my pleasure, but what may suffice for my necessity. I
will confidently expect from thy divine promise, and paternal providence, (who
have a tender care over all thy Creatures,) meat and clothing, convenient for
my sustenance, and competent to my condition; and so rest fully content in
thee, and faithfully grateful to thee, the free bestower of all blessings.

3. The means to acquire Temperance, are;
1. Frequently to reflect upon, and punctually to practice the before
prescribed Rules. 2. To keep our bodies and minds honestly employed. 3. To fly
from such objects, actions, persons, occasions; as provoke our senses to
unlawful Pleasures. 4. To think seriously upon Death and Eternity. 5. To make
Mortification our continual exercise.
O My Lord! who by thy most powerful and prudent ordination, have disposed all
things in perfect measure, number and weight: give Grace to thy poor servant,
so to watch over his actions, manners, senses, and desires; that all may be
measured, numbered, and weighed, in the true balance of discreet Moderation. O
that I could still regulate my life by the perfect rule of thy Law and Love,
the Dictamen of Reason, and the Counsel of thy Apostle; denying all worldly
lusts, and doing all things decently, orderly, and beseeming my calling! O that
my Employments were ever holy; my Senses always wary; my Thoughts still
reflected upon the end of my Creation; and all my Members truly mortified! how
hopefully, confidently, and undauntedly might I then expect the glorious
appearance of thee my great God and Savior?

4. Temperance, in particular is divided into Abstinence and Sobriety.
Abstinence, is a Virtue inclining us to a rational mediocrity in the use of
Meat; and Sobriety is the same in the use of Drink, which may also be applied
to our passions.
AH! My immortal Soul! thou art too worthy to be enslaved to thy sensual body!
The beasts exceed not nature's satisfaction, and will thou, who art indu'd with
reason, be less temperate? O shame, O Bruitishness! Does not that first
Precept, ring still in thy Ears: In the day thou eatest, thou shall surely dye?
And will thou yet hearken to thy seducing Eve, yield to thy subtle enemy, and
obey thy belly sooner than thy blessed Creator? Do not all they who strive for
the mastery, and aim at the obtaining of a corruptible Crown, abstain from all
excess: and wilt not thou keep under thy Body, curb thy Senses, and control thy
Passions, that thou may gain an incorruptible and eternal Crown in Heaven?
Yes, my dear Maker! I will never more destroy thy holy work, nor sell my
heavenly inhearitance for a vile Morsel, a mess of Pottage, a momentany
Pleasure: Thou (O sweet Redeemer!) who, whilst thou were pleased to sojourn
amongst us, sustainedst thy body with human Meats: Thou, dear Jesu my Savior!
who sufferedst Hunger in the desert, and Thirst on the Cross, to satisfy for
my riot and gluttony! extinguish (I beseech thee) all fleshly desires in my
senses; Let no worldly sweets so savor to my palate, as to make me outpass the
limits of perfect Abstinence and Sobriety: That using thy temporal gifts with
due temper and moderation; I may one day ba fully satiated and inebriated at
thy divine table, furnished with eternal delicacies and delights.

5. Modesty (which is a Virtue adjoined to Temperance,) is a restraint of all
unruly motions with a certain comeliness and decency, in respect of the
persons, affairs, time, place, and all other circumstances. And it has six
branches; Three, which concern the repression of inward motions; Meekness,
Humility, Studiosity.
Meekness, is a Virtue; which moderates our passion of Choler by subjecting it
to Reason, and keeping us from all such words, and actions, as are unbeseeming
us, and contrary to our duty. Humility is a Moral Virtue; which abates the edge
of our over-high hope and audacity; keeping us from pretending to more than
appertains to our condition; and counselling us to be content with such mean
things as are suitable to our true unworthiness. Studiosity, is a Moral Virtue;
which moderates our Curiosity and Covetousness of Knowledge; and inclines us to
a desire of knowing what is convenient according to our Condition.
THou have commanded me, (O meek and mild Jesu!) to learn of thee this divine
lesson, and thou have left me thy whole life, as a perfect example thereof, and
a pattern by which I should practice it. Thou (sweet Savior!) were silent,
patient, content, resigned, (as an innocent Lamb in the shearers hands) amidst
all the calamities, contumelies, affronts and insolences, which man's malice and
madness could inflict upon thee: And shall not I, (who have deserved all shame,
confusion, hatred, and Hell it self,) sustain willingly my smaller afflictions?
I will henceforth, (O my Jesu!) not only freely pardon all outrages which shall
be done me, but joyfully prepare my heart to embrace alt crosses, endure all
contradictions, and put up all injuries, for thy sake, with all sweetness of
affection and tenderness of companion toward my greatest enemies: That I may
finally possess a portion in that blessed land, which thou (O merciful
Redeemer!) have promised to thy meek, and humble servants.

Ah, my Soul! Learn also this heavenly lesson of thy most humble Savior, and
thou shall find perfect rest in this world, and have an eternal reward in the
next. Alas! Whereof art thou proud? What is due to thee, but only damnation;
which thou well know thou have often deserved? Why should thou expect to
be preferred before any other, who art more unfaithful and ungrateful to thy
loving Lord than all others? Ah, caitif creature! can thou conceive thy self
in a capacity of high honors? No, dear Jesu! I utterly disclaim them all; and
desire that all men may know my real unworthiness, that they may esteem of me,
treat me, and contemn me accordingly.

What would thou know, O my curious Soul! What do you gaze upon, O my
unsatiable Eyes! Is not one thing only necessary? one Science all-sufficient?
one object fully satisfactory? And is not the Rule which directs you to this
one necessary, sufficient, and satisfying object; short, sweet and easy? [This
is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
have sent.]

O Words, full of life and love! What can I wish for in heaven, (O my Lord!)
but eternal life? and what need I desire upon earth (O my Jesu!) but thy only
love? O my Soul! Why seek thou elsewhere that which thou can no where
find, but in thy God, thy Jesus, thy Savior; in whom are all the true
treasures of Science and Wisdom, who is thy only center, rest, satiety, and
security.

O what is all worldly knowledge but vanity of vanities? how mean and foolish is
all wisdom, which provides not for eternity? Ah, my good God! how it grieves
me, that I have given so much of my precious time, to the pursuit of such poor
studies, and getting such empty notions, which now I perceive do so little
profit me, in order to this only solid and Soul-saving science? Lord! I will
henceforth employ all my diligence, endeavors, time, talents, wit, will,
intensions and pretensions, upon that alone which will most advantage thy
honor, and best advance my salvation. My whole study shall be to know thee, (O
my God, and my All!) to contemplate thee, to please, praise, and love thee in
this World, that I may live and reign with thee in thy glorious Kingdom of
Eternity.

6. The other three branches of Modesty, are Virtues helping, us in the
ordering and managing of the outward motions of our Bodies.
1. By our beseeming Carriage. 2. By our fitting Recreations. 3. By our decent
Clothing.
GIve me also, (O liberal Bestower of all lovely Qualities!) these external
Graces beseeming my Condition, and suitable to my Calling: That so my Inward
and Outward composure; my Soul, my Body, my Senses, and all that which (by thy
permission) I am, making up a perfect harmony of all holy Virtues; I may become
pleasing to thy divine Majesty, profitable to my Neighbors, and instrumental
so my own perfection and Salvation.

7. The Conclusion of this Exercise, with an humble Petition for perfect and
Christian Temperance.
ANd now (O great and glorious Creator!) who have made all things for my use,
and me for thy service; Grant (I beseech thee) that I may never more violate
thy sacred order and design.

O let me not rest in any creature, which is so much inferior to my noble
nature; but terminate my love in thy blessed self, who only art above me. Where
else, Alas! can my understanding find a sovereign Object to satiate it, or
Center to content it, but the O supreme Verity! Where can my will meet with a
perfect felicity whereupon to fix its affections, but thee alone, O essential
Goodness!

Let me not therefore leave thee, the solid Substance: to love the Figure,
which so lightly fades away: But give me (O gracious Lord God!) thy efficacious
assistance, that I may make such temperate use of the world, as if I used it
not; that so living out the remaining days of my Pilgrimage, Soberly,
Vigilantly, and Faithfully, according to my calling; I may Joyfully, Hopefully,
Confidently and Preparedly, expect thy coming (O my merciful Judge!) having my
Reins girt with Continence, my Lamp lighted with Charity; Staff in hand with
prompt Obedience to all thy holy Ordinances; and finally enter with thee (my
Souls dear Bridegroom,) into thy Marriage-chamber of eternal delights in thy
happy Paradise.

. 4. Of Penance and Confession.
SInce Penance (according to the sacred Council of Trent) is a duty inseparably
annexed to the state of Christiany; and that every ones life (in whatsoever
condition) should be a continual practice and perseverant performance of
Penance, during the time of this our earthly pilgrimage: We shall endeavor to
deliver with all possible brevity, distinction and clearness.

1. Such Necessary, Essential and Fundamental Truths and Tenants concerning
Penance, as are unquestionable amongst all Orthodox Doctors, and proper to be
known by every Penitent, for the due exercise thereof.

2. We shall descend to the practical, and most important part of Penance;
which is Confession: setting down such Preparations, Examinations of the
Conscience, and Acts of devotion, as are to precede it, such as are to
accompany it, and such as are to follow it.

3. We shall add a larger Examination of the Conscience, or Catalogue of sins
for their help and benefit, who desire to make a good general Confession.

General Maxims and Positions, concerning Penance and Confession.
The necessity of Penance.
WE are by nature the children of wrath, and being heirs of our first Parents
malediction, we are with them banished out of Paradise, and abandoned to labor
and toil upon earth, where we remain slaves to our irregular passions, under
the tyrannical yoke of Death and the Devil.

Now there are but two means to redress these miseries, and to recover the
divine favor and friendship, (and consequently to regain Heaven) to wit,
Innocence and Penance.

Innocence, concerns only such spotless Souls, as have inviolably conserved
their Baptismal sanctity even to the last moment of their lives: [ though they
also, (if there be any such Saints, besides Children dying in the nonage of
reason) may be said in some sort to stand in need of Penance, for the
preservation of their purity, and perseverance in their Innocence.]

Penance, concerns all Sinners: as being the sole means, established by God,
and left by Christ JESUS to his Church, whereby to appease our irritated
Creator, to satisfy the divine Justice, and to restore as to our lost heavenly
Inheritance. Unless you do Penance, you shall all Perish.

Penance is the chief Exercise of a Christian.
WHence it follows, That Penance is the most necessary, important, and
excellent Exercise of all Christians: since all must either Perish or do
Penance; and and it is an Article of our Faith; that Penance is so absolutely
necessary for all Sinners, that without it, there is no hope lest of obtaining
pardon for their Sins, of regaining Gods favor, of saving their Souls, and of
enjoying eternal Happiness.

Penance comprehends the Virtue of Penance, and the Sacrament of Penance.
WHich is to be understood, both of an interior Penance, (which is an act of
the Virtue of Penance;) and of an exterior Sacrament of Penance, (which is
commonly called Confession.)

By the Virtue of Penance, The Sinner is to detest his impieties, with a firm
resolution of no more offending the divine Majesty: By the Sacrament of
Penance, he is to accuse himself of them, with an earnest desire to repair the
wrongs, and satisfy the injuries done to the divine Justice.

So that to obtain pardon for his Sins, he must of necessity have both an
inward, sincere, Christian sorrow and repentance; and also (when it may be
obtained) an outward Confession and Accusation of his crimes, accompanied with
such Conditions, as shall be hereafter specified.

The Sacrament of Penance consists of these four Parts.
(1) Contrition of heart. (2) Confession of mouth. (3) Satisfaction of works,
(which are its material Parts.) (4) An Absolution of the Priest, (which is its
Form.)

Of Contrition: the first Part of Penance.
A Sinner cannot duly perform this important affair of Penance, unless he
conceiv's (as aforesaid) a Sorrow for his past offenses.

This Sorrow may be either Perfect or Imperfect:

It is Perfect, [1] When it proceeds from perfect Charity, grounded upon the
consideration of Gods love and goodness. [2] Accompanied with an inward,
sincere, and cordial detestation of the committed Crime. And [3] joined with a
firm purpose and resolution of future Amendment.

It is Imperfect, when Charity in us is imperfect, and when our sorrow
proceeds, [1] Rather from the fear of Hell. [2] Or from the desire of Heaven.
[3] Or from the foulness of the Sin it self, than from the love of God.

The first is called Contrition, the second Attrition.

Attrition, is (of it self) insufficient to obtain pardon, and therefore it
must be accompanied with a Sacramental Confession, to render it effectual for
the Remission of sins, and reconciliation to the divine Grace and Friendship.

Contrition, is so Excellent, that S. Cyprian esteems it the very best thing
which a mortal creature can offer up to her Creator. It is so Powerful, that S
Ambrose says, It opens heaven, shuts up hell, cures all the Souls diseases,
repairs all spiritual ruins, and serves as a Sponge to deface all iniquities.
It is so pleasing to God, that (sings the Royal Prophet) he never rejects an
humble and contrite Heart, but ever receives it as a most perfect Sacrifice. It
is so easy, that a Moment may conceive it, an Instant may produce it; For
neither the shortness of time, (says S. Cyprian,) nor the exremity of the last
hour, hinders the pardon of a Contrite Penitent. Finally, it is so Profitable,
that (says the same Saint) it not only obtains Pardon for past offenses, but
gains also a future Crown of glory.

But this perfect Contrition, must proceed [1.] from a motive of the Love of
God, and not for any servil Fear: As when a Child having offended his Father,
grieves not so much for fear of being disinherited, as for having been disloyal
and disobedient to so loving and beloved a Parent. [2] It must be accompanied
with an inward, sincere and hearty Detestation of the Crime, like that of the
Prophet David, and of the Apostle S. Peter; and not only an outward, verbal and
lip-lamentation, like that of Antiochus and Esau. And [3] It must be joined
with a firm Resolution of future Amendment.

Now this Sorrow for the Sin, this Detestation thereof, and his Resolution of
amendment, grounded on the consideration of Gods goodness, (which constitute
the essence of perfect Contrition) must be, [1] exceeding great; For as man is
bound to love God above all, so he ought to hate sin above all. [2] They must
be general, absolute and universal, extending themselves to all Sins
whatsoever, without the least conditional reserve of Affection to any one; For
what will it avail thee, O sinner, (says S. Gregory) to be sorry for thy Anger,
if thou studiest Revenge? What will it serve thee to detest Uncleaness if thou
continuest in Covetousness. [3] They must precede (if not the Confession,) at
least the Absolution; for they being (as aforesaid) of the Essence of the
Sacrament of Penance, must necessarily go before the end thereof, which is the
Absolution. [4] There needs no vocal expression of this Sorrow, Detestation and
Resolution for an inward feeling and conception thereof in the Soul abundantly
suffices. [5] Neither is it necessary to conceive as many Sorrows, or form as
many acts of Detestation, and Resolution, as you have committed Sins; for one
only general, sincere, and hearty Sorrow; one Detestation of all that is
opposite to the divine love and liking; one Resolution of amendment, includes
all Former, and Future crimes and offenses.

Of Confession, the second part of Penance.
Confession, is a declaration of your Sins to an approved Priest: Now to the
end you may declare your Sins exactly, you must.

Before Confession,
1. MAke a diligent Examination of your Conscience; For it is not enough to
present your self to your Confessarius, and there relate what comes then to
your memory, or what you have learned by rote out of Books, or what you
formerly used to say: But you must seriously apply your thoughts, for some
space of time before Confession, to consider the true state of your Soul, to
search (as the Council of Trent commands) into the most secret corners of your
Conscience, and to carry with you to Confession such dispostions as are
requisite for the obtaining of Absoution.

2. This Examination of Conscience, may be either in order to a General, or an
Annual; or a Monthly, or a Weekly Confession: and accordingly more or less
time, must be allotted for its due performance.

3. The Necessity of this serious Examination of Conscience before Confession,
appears; In that the Penitent is obliged to accuse himself distinctly of all
his Mortal Sins, with their aggravating circumstances, their qualities, and
their number: Now he cannot Confess them, unless he know them, nor distinctly
know them, unless he has diligently considered them.

Whence it follows, (1) That if the Penitent omits or forgets to Confess any
one Mortal Sin, through defect of his precedent Examination, his Confession is
not only fruitless, but sinful and sacrilegious, as if he had voluntarily
concealed it: because, though his intention was not directly to omit it, yet
his supine negligence directly and formally exposed him to the danger of making
an imperfect Confession.

2. It follows, That a Penitent presenting himself to Confession, without this
precedent Examination of his Conscience, ought to be sent back by his Ghostly
Father without absolution: Unless, [1] the Confessarius will take the pains to
supply has defect by interrogating him upon all such particular points, as may
any way concern his calling, and state of life and conversation. (2) Unless the
Penitent be very weak and infirm, or very ignorant and simple, or a mere Idiot:
in which cases the discreet Confessor may undoubtedly supply their impotency;
but he cannot exempt the common and general sort of Christians from this
serious Examination of their Consciences, which the Council asserts to be
absolutely necessary.

3. It follows, that such Penitents, as will Confess no more than they are
asked, nor utter a word of self accusation unless it be forced out of their
mouths, ought not to receive Absolution: because there is just reason to doubt
of the validity of such Confessions; since the Penitents seem to be altogether
ignorant of the state of their own Consciences; to have been supinely careless
in the consideration of the qualities, circumstances and number of their
crimes; and lastly, to want a due sense of Sins heinousness, and a true horror,
hatred and detestation thereof; and yet all this is necessary for a good
Confession.

4. It follows for the same reasons, That such Penitents as make use only of
certain Books, and set forms of Confession; relating only such things as they
there find and no more, without any search into their own interionr; but out of
mere custom coming to Confession always the with same things, and declaring
them in the same manner: do also abuse the Sacrament. We condemn not the right
use of such pious Books, but we seriously advise all Penitents, that (besides
them) they will dive into their own Consciences; to find out the root of their
Offenses, and to consider their own evil affections, inclinations customs,
together with the nature, number, quality and circumstances of their crimes,
that so they may accuse themselves accordingly. For what Book can possibly
discover the true state of each ones peculiar Soul and Conscience?

4. Before you begin the Examination of your Conscience; you must humbly beg
the divine assistance, since it is by Gods particular Grace and extraordinary
Favor, that any Sinner returns to him by Penance. You must therefore elevate to
him your Heart and Affection, earnestly imploring such heavenly succor as is
necessary for the making a good Confession, which is to you a matter of so high
a consequence and importance.

And consequently you are to ask, [1] Light to see your Sins, and to know the
true state of your Soul. [2] Capacity, understanding, and memory to express
them rightly in Confession. [3] The Love of God, and strength of Resolution to
detest and hate them. [4] All that is requisite to destroy sin by sincere
Penance, to be reconciled to the divine Majesty, to obtain his mercy, to
appease his anger; to satisfy his Justice, and to establish his empire, his
sanctity, his glory in your whole interior and exterior man.

5. After this you may do well to form an act of Pure Intention; protesting,
that you pretend by his present Confession to acknowledge the disorders of your
Life, to obtain pardon for your Sins, and to get Grace by virtue of the
Sacrament for your future reformation and amendment.

6. Then, driving all other thoughts out of your mind, settle your self, by a
serious application of your spirit, to the Examination of your Conscience,
making use, if you please, of some one of the Methods hereafter described in
the particular directions for Confession.)

But beware [1] of overmuch earnestness, impression, anxiety, or disquiet, in
your examination [2] of overmuch scrupulosity; contenting your self to
remember the greatest and most dangerous, hiding the rest (of your Venial sins)
in Christ's sacred Wounds, and drowning them in his precious Blood. [3] of
overmuch tediousness; like those weak spirits; who to make an eight
days-Confession, must have four hours time of Recollection, and are troubled
when it is denied them: for surely the discussion of the Conscience is not to
be measured by the length of time, but by the attention of the Spirit. [4] Be
sure to Confess nothing, but that for which you are sorrowful, and which you
purpose to amend. [5] In defects and imperfections, mention only such in
Confession as you desire to correct in your self, and the rooting out whereof
would make most for the increase of your peace, of humility, of purity of
heart, and liberty of spirit. [6] Above all things, beware you go not to
Confession pro forma, out of custom, or for company; for such persons seem
scarcely to detest Sin sufficiently, nor purpose amendment resolutely, and
consequently put themselves in danger of committing a Sacrilege by coming to
the Sacrament indisposedly.

7. Having made your Examination of Conscience, forget not to frame an Act of
Contrition, detesting all your sins in general, and those in particular which
you have now remembered and remarked in order to your present Confession.

In Confession.
1. YOur Confession is to be accompanied with these Five qualities and
Conditions, which are necessarily required to make it valid and effectual:

The First and principal condition of a good Confession, is Integrity, that is,
You must exactly, entirely, and (sigillatim, says the Council of Trent) one by
one, accuse your self of all your Mortal Crimes, (with their number and
aggravating circumstances,) be they never so secret, so infamous, so enormous;
be they Interior in thought, or Exterior in word or action; be they hidden or
manifest: for who so conceals any one Mortal Sin, either through shame, or
through malice, or through his own culpable negligence and want of due
examination; invalidates his whole Confession, turning it to his own Confusion,
and of the Sacrament making a Sacriledg.

The second Condition is Humility; that is, you must humbly acknowledge your
selves culpable, and not excuse your crimes, or cast your faults upon others,
upon the occasions, upon the temptations, etc.

The third Condition is, Clearness of expression; that is, you must deliver
your Confession in such distinct and intelligible words, as may make your Sins
plainly understood, and the state of your Soul clearly known to your Confessor,
(who sits in that Tribunal, delegated by the divine Majesty, to judge of the
Penitents Conscience.)

The fourth Condition is Simplicity, that is, you must declare your Sins,
truly, nakedly, inartificially, and undissemblingly, without multiplicity of
words, circumlocutions, exquisit phrases, fruitless repetions; and unnecessary
circumstances, especially in Venial Sins; for all this does but disguise,
confound, and obscure the Confession.

The fifth Condition, is a sense, sorrow and feeling of your Sins heynousness;
that is, you must put on the person and posture of a devout, modest, poor
Criminal, appearing before his dreadful Judge; imitating the Publican, who
sighing from his heart, casting down his eyes, and smiting his breast, deemed
himself unworthy all grace and favor.

2. From which Conditions, you may easily gather what abuses you are to avoid,
As,

1. You must take heed of going to Confession, like some lewd Libertines, who
by their light carriage and laughing countenance, show how little serious they
are in a matter of so great moment.

2. Let not your Confession consist of Negatives; tiring your Confessors ears
with these like fruitless and superfluous expressions: I have not loved and
served God as I should; I have not prayed so fervently, frequently, faithfully
as I should, etc. Surely the heavenly Citizens might say as much; and were you
guilty of no heavier Crimes, you might deserve to be placed upon the Altar, as
most worthy of a Saints honor and worship.

3. Use not Indefinit terms, in relating your Sins; like some who will say,
Persons in my place, of my calling, in my condition, do sometimes tell untruths;
People are apt to hear and speak some words of Detraction, etc. For your
Confession must be personal, and your accusation must be limited to your own
particular action.

4. Beware also of these like conditional ways of accusation; If I have sworn,
ly'd, detracted, I ask God pardon: For your Confession must be absolute and
positive.

5. Nor let your Confession consist of Generals, by saying, I have been proud,
idle, envious, etc. Neither imitate such, as having little to say (by reason
they want a true self knowledge, or have failed to make a due Examination of
their Conscience) accuse themselves of Tepidity, indevotion infidelity in
answering to holy inspirations, etc. For you are to particularize the number
and circumstances of your Crimes, and declare that single action or omission
which is sinful.

6. Do not indiscreetly declare a third persons fault or imperfection, to
palliate or extenuate your own crime; saying: I have a Husband, a Son, a
Servant, so froward, troublesome, unruly, that I am sometimes urged to Anger and
impatience, etc. For this is not to accuse your sins, but excuse your self.

7. Much less are you to express your great offenses in extenuating terms, by
saying, I have let slip some Idle words, and they were sometimes tending to
dishonesty or detraction; For this is to cover the Crime, and to commit a
Sacriledg.

8. Avoid these two extremes; Of speaking over-lowd, least others may hear you;
or over-low, lest your Ghostly Father should not understand you.

9. Abuse not your Gostly Fathers years and patience, (and indeed the Sacrament
it self) with Impertinencies, or any thing whatsoever concerns not your
Conscience; For, to talk (during the time of Confession) of trivial, temporal,
or indifferent businesses, which may be deferred; is to profane the sanctity
of this high Tribunal.

10. Imitate not them, who whilst they are at Confession, gaze up and down,
play with their Beads, or Fingers, and relate their Sins with as little
feeling, as if they recited a Romance: For the exterior disorder and
irreverence, declares the interior indevotion and negligence.

11. Run not to every new-coming Priest; like some vagabond spirits, who no
sooner hear of a holy, devout, spiritual Confessarius, but presently they have
an itching desire to make a trial and taste of him: For this savours overmuch
of Curio^ty and Levity.

12. Leave not your ordinary Ghostly Father without a just and warrantable
occasion and necessity: Much less should you do it, when you have committed
some extraordinary Crime, for fear of incurring his ill opinion or disfavour:
For this is a manifest sign of excessive Pride and Hypocrisy.

13. Neither ought you to dislike him because he sharply reprehends you for
your errors: or suspect his affection, if he speaks home to you for your
correction: For all such Exceptions, are the mere tricks of Self love, not the
arguments of soilid Repentance; since whosoever truly conceives himself a grievous
Criminal, will not covet to be cherished, but be well content to be chastised.

Fourteenthly, If you go often to Confession, (as surely all zealous and devout
Christians should), you may do well to mention briefly, and without any
circumstances, some one Sin of your life past, (for which you are certain to be
most heartily sorry;) that so you may both secure your own Contrition, and the
Priests Absolution.

Fifteenthly and Lastly, End not your Confession abruptly, as you would an idle
story, or by saying as some rude penitents do; There Is all: I have no more,
etc. But add some such like words, For these my offenses, etc. As is hereafter
set down.

After Confession.
1. HAving concluded your Confession, you are to yield an humble and attentive
ear to what your Ghostly Father shall tell you. If he questions you; answer him
clearly, sincerely, punctually: If he chides you, take it patiently; If he says
little or nothing to you, trouble not your self; but bowing down your head,
embrace the enjoined Penance, and receive your Absolution.

2. Departing thence, full of outward respect and reverence, and of inward joy
an comfort; retire your self into some place of quiet, and there recollecting,
your heart and senses; conceive your self to be the Prodigal Child received
into favor; and then extasid at the consideration of your Creators boundless
Love and Mercy, render him most hearty thanks for having so freely pardoned
your ingratitude, disloyalty, and disobedience.

3. Do not lightly discover to others what your Ghostly Father said unto you:
or what Penance he enjoined you: For that which passes in this Sacrament,
should be on all sides kept secret.

4. You are not to cast your Eyes any more upon your particular Offenses, nor
to trouble your self by reflection, whether they be well confessed or not: but
turning your heart sweetly, quietly, and confidently to your Creator, detest
whatsoever is contrary to his divine liking; and renounce all that may put any
obstacle between your soul and his love.

5. Know assuredly, That if you have made your Confession sincerely, with all
the necessary and essential conditions and dispositions which ought to
accompany it, you are also absolved from all such Mortal Sins, as you may have
committed through forgetfulness, according to the express decision of the
Council of Trent.

6. But if notwithstanding all the moral and necessary Diligence you have
employed, you have omitted to confess some Mortal Crime, which recurrs
afterward to your memory: be not at all troubled or dismayed thereat; for all
you have to do in this case, is to mention such Mortal Sins (thus omitted and
forgotten,) in your next Sacramental Confession.

7. You may do well to excite your self to a new Sorrow for your Sins;
supplying your defect therein, by borrowing that, which your Savior felt in
the Garden, in consideration of these very Crimes in particular by you now
confessed.

8. Renew your good Purposes of Amending your life, and make fresh
Protestations to correct what is amiss for the future.

9. Say devoutly your enjoined Penance thinking it small in regard of your
sins, and therefore adding other prayers, hereafter set down, as your leisure
and devotion shall permit; and offering up to your Sovereign Creator, for
further satisfaction of your Crimes, the merits of his Son Jesus, the Milk of
his Mother, the blood of his Martyrs, the Innocence of all his Saints.

10. Lastly, beg grace, strength, and courage, for the performance of, and
perseverance in your well made Resolutions: and for the faithful keeping your
Promises now made to God and your Ghostly Father.

Of Satisfaction, the third part of Penance.
SAtisfaction, is a payment of the temporal punishment, which is due to Sin,
(by reason of the injury done thereby to the Divine Majesty) by the performance
of such penal and laborious works, as are imposed by the Ghostly Father. For
the declaration whereof, note these following Maxims, containing briefly all
that is necessary to be known concerning this matter.

1. That when the Sin is pardoned, the Punishment may remain. For the Sacrament
(of Penance, or Confession) remits only the Fault primarily, and the Punishment
secundarily, according to the fervor of the pious Penitent, and the quality of
the imposed Penance.

2. That this Punishment must be paid and discharged; either in this World, by
the performance of good Works, and the gaining of Indulgences; or in Purgatory,
if sufficient Penance be not done during our life time.

3. That it cannot be determined what Punishment in this Life is sufficient to
satisfy for a Mortal Sin: this being a thing known only to God, who alone
knows the grievousness of the offense.

4. That the performance of the Penance imposed by the Confessor is not so
essential to the Sacrament: as that if the Penitent should die before he
accomplishes it, the Sacraments should be invalid.

5. That the Satisfaction, which is essential to this Sacrament, consists in
the Resolution of the Penitent to perform the obligation annexed to his Sin of
repairing the injury he has done the Divine Majesty, either in this World, or
the next.

6. That such a Sinner, as will accept of no Penance, is incapable of
Absolution: because this obligation of doing some Satisfaction, is essential to
this Sacrament.

7. That such an one, as is content to satisfy in Purgatory, but will do
nothing at all in this life, ought not to be absolved: because he may be justly
reputed not sufficiently Contrite for his Sins, by reason of this rashness,
presumption, and plain tempting of God.

8. That the works which are proper to satisfy for our Sins, are Penal works;
and reduced to these three kinds: Prayer, which comprehends all sorts of
Devotion: Fasting, which includes all kinds of Austerities: Almsdeeds, under
which are contained all works of Mercy and Charity toward our Neighbor. And
these three sorts of Penal Works, are therefore chiefly recommended to all
Penitents; because of their convenience to satisfy for the three common sorts
of Sins. 1. Against God, to which Prayer corresponds. 2. Against their
Neighbor, for which Almsdeeds are instituted. 3. Against Themselves, for which
Fasting is ordained.

9. That though (as aforesaid) the Penitent be obliged to accept of some
Penance, to the end the Sacrament may not be rendered imperfect: yet he is not
bound to accept of what Penance, the Confessor indiscreetly imposes upon him;
but he may lawfully demand to have it moderated or changed into something more
easy: For he is not obliged under any pain of Mortal Sin to obey him in any
thing else, than in receiving his Absolution.

10. That when the Penitent has freely a^cepted any Penance imposed upon him
by his Ghostly Father; he is absolutely obliged to accomplish it: Yet if it be
a light Penance, (as three Paters and Aves) or that he omits some small parts
of it; such an omission is only Venial, by reason of the littleness of the
matter.

11. That when the Confessor limits no time for the accomplishment of the
Penance imposed by him, and accepted by the Penitent in Confession: It is
requisite it be performed at the first opportunity: because it is probable, he
so intended it; to the end the Penitent might speedily satisfy for his
Offenses, and carefully preserve himself from future falling.

12. That such an Omission of accomplishing the Penance speedily is no Mortal
Sin; unless it be a notable negligence, and in some dangerous circumstance; the
judgment whereof depends upon the Con^essors Prudence.

5. Particular Directions, and Practical Devotions for Confession.
BEFORE CONFESSION.
THe Penitent. who resolves (by Gods Grace) to make a good Confession, must
(according as opportunity shall suffer, and Devotion serve) perform three
things, before he presents himself to his Ghostly Father: to wit, He must
Consider. He must Examine. He must Pray.

First consider, That the discussion of your Conscience and the Confession of
your sins, is a sovereign remedy against blindness of heart: and weigh with
your self, how dangerous a thing it is, to defer your Conversion, to linger out
in wickedness, to make bad Confessions; since you know not, but that such
wilful malice may cause God in Justice to leave you in final Blindness and
Impenitency. This needs no explication, but Application: If one should tell
you, This year you shall be drowned, would you not beware of Water? Do so of
Sins, and their occasions. Why will you still heap up wrath against the day of
wrath? There is nothing surely, that does more harden the Hearts, and blind the
Understanding, than the abuse of the Sacraments, and the wilful resistance, or
neglect of Gods call and inspirations.

2. Consider, How easily a Blind man is deceived, how dangerously he walks,
what comfort he wants? Apply the same to your soul, blinded with sin, and
ponder well these places of Holy Writ: Run whilst you have light, least the
darkness of death should overtake you. I have sought after thee and thou
would not be found; now thou shall seek me, and thou shall not find me; but
you shall die in your sins.

3. Consider, how a blind man is led; 1. by a Dog, 2. by a Child, 3. by a
Staff! so a blind Soul is led. 1. By Custom in sin, to which it returns as a
dog to his vomit. 2. By Affection to creatures, as a doting Mother thinks her
black Child beautiful. 3. By Passion, for then having a staff, you will strike
friend or foe. Beware in time, and permit your self to be ruled and directed.

4. Consider, what a madness it were for you to kill your self with that
Weapon, which is delivered into your hands for the defense of your Life; And is
it not a far greater frenzy, to procure your spiritual death. by that which
is provided for your souls life and preservation? Is not Confession the
Sacrament of grace and reconciliation? O! Let it not prove your bane and
damnation.

5. Blessed are the clean-hearted, for they shall see God. Without some degree
of Purity, it is impossible to see, enjoy and possess him, who is Purity it
self: Consider then seriously what you must do, and which is the readiest and
surest means to get this Purity?

6. Think, what will most affright your Soul, and make its case desperate at
the hour of death? Bad Confessions. And what will then most comfort it? Good
Confessions; that is, To have done your duty, and used your best endeavor in
the exact and faithful performance of this most important business, which is
all God requires at your hands. Prevent therefore, and provide in time. Do it
even now, for there is danger in delay.

2 Examine.
INvocate the divine Light to see God, and your self; his goodness, and your
naughtiness; that you may praise him for the one, and obtain pardon for the
other. Saying briefly thus.

A Prayer befre the Examinatin of your Conscience.
O Father of light, and God of love! grant me true light, true love, and true
wisdom; that I may impartially discern what does please and displease thy
divine Majesty in my Soul; For I most earnestly desire to detest and deface the
one, and to embrace and increase the other. Illuminate the eyes of my
Understanding, that I may truly see my sins and imperfections; enable my
Memory, that I may duly confess them; strengthen my Will, that I may resolutely
amend them; and change my Whole man, that I may sleep no longer in death and
deadly sin.

O my soul! Give up an account of thy stewardship, since thou have not long to
hold it! Fool! This very night thy soul shall be taken from thee: and what then
will all these impure and impertinent thoughts, desires, words, affections and
actions profit thee? To what purpose gainest thou even the whole World, if thou
losest thy own Soul? O Martha! [O, N.] Thou, art troubled about many things,
when as there is but one only thing which is absolutely necessary, Return
therefore into thy self, and turn to God. Lament, Repent, Amend.

A form of Examination for such as Confess often.
AMongst the many forms of Examination of Conscience, make use of some one that
seems to you the clearest, easiest, fullest, and most suitable to your gust,
devotion, and condition; as thus:

1. How long is it since my last Confession?

2. Where, and with whom, have I since that time conversed?

3. What Employments have chiefly taken up my time?

4. What Sins and imperfections am I most inclinable to?

5. What is the charg and duty, to which my Vocation obliges me?

6. With what Intention have I done my actions?

A form of Examination for proficients, and Religious persons.
Or thus.
1. WHerein have I offended my good God, in Works, of disobedience, propriety,
immodesty, indevotion, etc.

2. In Words, of murmuration, detraction, dishonesty, untruth, pride, passion,
etc.

3. In Thoughts, of curiosity, vanity, sensuality, impurity, disdainfulness,
spitefulness, etc.

4. In Affections, and desires, and intentions, against Charity, Chastity,
Humility.

Or thus.
1. WHat sensuality, in meat, drink, sleep, talk, company?

2. What curiosity, of eyes, ears, tongue, heart?

3. What vanity, pride, complacency?

4. What Tepidity distraction, negligence, in Office, prayers, recollection,
devotion?

5. What uncharitableness, in words, censures, judgments?

6. How impatient, disobedient, soon disquieted for every toy?

7. How partial in my own case, in defending my own opinions, in point of
propriety?

Or thus.
1. I Have been very irreverent, indevout, distracted through my own fault in
performing the divine Office and other prayers of obligation, especially twice
or thrice.

2. I have been defective in charity toward others, externally or internally;
especially in speaking or judging ill of them, or in such a manner, upon such
motives, and so often.

3. I have been very unmortified, unresign'd, froward out of pride, scorn of
others, self-love, etc. especially two or three times in such manner; as by
uttering vain, disdainful, distastful words, by hypocrisy, by internal
complacency, by self-opinion, etc. or by external show, complaining,
impatience, etc.

4. The fourth point may be concerning such particular Sins, as each one shall
find himself most inclined unto, and wherein he most frequently fails.

They who desire a more large and particular Catalogue of such fins and
imperfections, as even good and virtuous persons may sometimes fall into; may
examine themselves upon the following heads; And if they find themselves guilty
of the Crimes there mentioned, let them mark and remember them in order to
their Confession, passing the rest over and omitting them.

employment, condition?

If you have committed any of the more grievous crimes, not here mentioned;
your own memory will easily suggest them unto you; for a soul that is tender,
delicate and desirous to serve God, cannot possibly forget any such mortal
offense, which so much grieves and afflicts her.

It Is therefore abundantly sufficient for such devout Penitents, as make
frequent use of Confession, to use a moral diligence, and take a competent time
for the examination of their Conscience, without troubling themselves to turn
over those long catalogues of Sins, which are proper only for the making of
General Confessions: satisfying themselves, in that they have no will to
conceal any thing from the knowledge of their Gostly Father.

3. Pray.
HAving thus, without anxiety, perplexity, and scrupulosity, examined your
Conscienec: say thus to your sinful Soul:

A Prayer after the Examination of your Conscience.
AH! frail, weak, wicked Wretch! Art thou not ashamed to remain still in thy
wonted negligences, imperfections, tepidities? to sing still the same sinful
song, after so many years past over, so many iterated Confessions, so many
received Sacraments, and so many good Resolutions made to the contrary?
Wallowest thou still in the same Mire, and lie thou still snorting in the
same Bed of Sensuality? O horrid ingratitude! If thou were now summoned to give
up thy just accounts; what could thou answer for so much time misspent, so
many inspirations neglected, so many graces abused? Thou approachest nearer
death and Eternity, but recoylest backward in religious Piety and Perfection;
Will thou still lie sleeping in this dangerous Lethargy? Is this the grateful
and dutiful service thou rendrest thy Creator, for having afforded thee all
convenient means to do Penance, and for having so patiently expected thy
conversion and amendment?

Alas, my confounded Soul! What will become of thee? What course will thou
steer? When and how will thou begin? Ah sinful Wretch! Prodigal Child! Disloyal
friend! Sue to thy Physician; Return to thy Father; Repent thee of thy
disloyalty; Request pardon, grace and love; Resolve to do Penance for what is
past, and to amend for the time to come.

Yes, Lord! even this Day, this Hour, this very Moment, will I begin to be a
new Creature; I renounce all my former follies; I renew all my former good
Resolutions; I consecrate the whole remainder of my life to thy love and
service: And for this end, I will presently leave such Company, such
Curiosities, such Vanities, etc. and abandon whatsoever holds my heart captive
and my Affections enslaved to the prejudice of thy Honor and my Souls
perfection. I will willingly undergo such and such difficulties, endure such
contradictions, crosses, afflictions, and whatsoever thy fatherly hand shall
impose upon me. O all powerful Creator! since thou have given me the Grace to
frame this Resolution, give me also the strength and courage to put it in
execution.

Then endeavor to make an act of perfect Contrition: which contains. [1.] A
Detestation of your sins past, grounded on Gods love and goodness. [2.] A firm
Purpose of Amendment for the future. [3.] A Confidence in Gods mercy. [4.] A
will to do Satisfaction. [5.] A total Resignation to the Divine disposition.

An act of Contrition, and Prayer before Confession.
O My good God! Father of all comfort and compassion! Creator of Heaven and
Earth, and Redeemer of my Soul! Behold here a poor Worm, prostrate at the feet
of thy divine Majesty, humbly craving pardon for all his iniquities and
impurities; I am going, O my sweet Lord Jesu! to the Tribunal of thy Mercy, to
present my self before thy Minister and Vicegerent, and there to give thee an
exact account of my miserable life, by humbly confessing, detesting and
lamenting all the ingratitudes, impieties, and spiritual fornications, which I
have presumed to commit in thy presence with so little respect, and for so vile
and base ends, that the very remembrance thereof breeds an extreme Shame, Fear
and Sorrow in my now sensible and penitent Soul. Shame, for having left an
infinite Good, to embrace an empty, fading, filthy Nothing. Fear, for having
forsaken the light of Heaven and the life of Eternity, to temain in eternal
death and darkness. Sorrow, for having offended thee my God, who art to me so
good, so merciful, so loving, and so liberal.

Oh! that my heart could rend asunder with true Contrition and Compunction; and
my Eyes dissolve into a flood of tears, for having been disloyal to so faithful
a Friend, and disobedient to so free-hearted a Father! Mercy, O dear Father! to
thy prodigal Child: Mercy, O good Lord! to thy sinful Servant!

Give to my Understanding, Light to see and know my faults; to my heart, Sorrow
to hate and detest them: to my eyes, Tears to lament and weep bitterly for
them: and to my mouth, so sincere and entire a Confession of them, as if it
were the first good Confession that I ever made; or should be the last
Confession that ever I should make; which thou only know, O my all-knowing
Lord and Maker!

I therefore most humbly beseech thee, Dear Jesu, my Savior and Redeemer! By
all thy Pains and Tears, by the Prayers of thy most Blessed Mother, by the past
Sorrows of all Penitents, who are now in Heaven, secure of their own Salvation,
and sollicitous of mine; increase my Contrition, and release my Crimes; Pardon
O meek Lamb of God, who take away the Sins of the world! my past faults,
pity my present folly, and protect my future frailty: that with a clean, quiet
and contented soul, I may strive to please and praise thee all my lifetime
hereafter, and in the end, die happily in thy favor and friendship

O my crucified Jesu! my only hope and refuge! bathe me in thy Blood, beautify
me with thy Merits, bless me with thy Grace: By the tears that issued forth of
thy Eyes; by the Prayers which came forth of thy Mouth by the Blood which
gushed forth of thy. Wounds and Heart; by all the pains of thy Body, and pangs
of thy Soul; by all the mercies of thy Divinity, and merits of thy Humanity; by
all that is dear and near unto thee in Heaven and Earth; cleanse, quiet,
cloth, comfort and content my sick, sinful, weak, wounded, and wretched soul.

In Confession.
THen full of confident Humility, and humble Confidence, cast your self at the
feet of your Ghostly Father: in whose person, you are to consider two Priests,
the one Visible to whom you speak, the other Invisible which is Christ Jesus,
whose place he represents; wherefore honoring them both, dreading them both,
and reverently inclining your head and body to them both, begin your Confession
in this manner:

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Benedicite
[that is, I beg your blessing:] Which blessing being received; you begin your
Confiteor, either in English or in Latin: Though having before recited it, in
the Examination of your Conscience, it is not necessary to repeat it here: or
you may do well,) when the want of time and the multitude of other Penitents,
require have) to abridge your Confiteor thus; I confefess unto Almighty God, to
all the Saints, and to you my Ghostly Father, that I have exceedingly sinned,
in Thought, Word, and Deed; through my Fault, my Fault, my exceeding great
Fault.

Then without impertinent Preambles, say.

I Accuse my self, That since my last Confession, (which was eight days,
fifteen days, or a month ago) I have done this, omitted this, etc.

Having declared briefly and clearly, what you could remember; you may thus
conclude your Confession: For these and all other my Sins and Imperfections, I
am heartily sorry, purpose amendment, humbly beg pardon of God, and Penance and
Absolution of you my Ghostly Father: Then bowing down your head and body;
proceed with, Therefore I beseech the blessed Virgin Mary, all the Saints, and
you my Ghostly Father, to pray unto our Lord God for me.

Whilst your Spiritual Father pronounces your Absolution; produce (either with
heart or mouth) some of these short Acts following.

1. Of Sorrow; O God be merciful to me a sinner:

2. Of Humility; Not unto me, Lord! but to thy Name be given all praise and
glory.

3. Of Love and Confidence; My God, and my All: My comfort and my content: my
secure rest and sole refuge; Remain with me sweet Jesus, and it is sufficient.

4. Of Spiritual joy and alacrity; Take courage my poor, dejected, desolate
Soul! Jesus is our guide, and we are going to Heaven: what matters it, whether
we get or lose in this World, have friends or foes, sink or swim, live or die
upon earth? If Jesus loves us, and we Him, it is enough. Live the Cross, and my
crucified Redeemer: Adieu world, Farewell Self-love; Heaven is my Home, Jesus is
my Hope and Happiness.

Also, At the time of Absolution, Imagine you feel Christ's sacred Blood
distilling into your Soul; and that you hear those his sweet words directed
unto your ears: Go in peace; thy Sins are forgiven thee; now sin no more, lest
some worse thing befall thee. O words full of sweetness and comfort!

After Confession.
REtire your self a while. 1. To give God thanks. 2. To say your Penance 3. To
renew your good purposes and resolutions. 4. To offer up your self and all your
actions, with whatsoever you are and have, to be hereafter employed for your
sweet Saviors honor, love and service. 5. To beg of him, (who died on the
Cross, with his Eyes full of Tears, Body full of Wounds, and Heart full of
Mercy, for the salvation of your Soul:) to supply all defects, which may have
occurred in this, or any other your Confessions.

Then ejaculate sweetly some of these Sentences.

CLeanse me, O Lord, from my secret sins, from my vicious customs,
inclinations, and affections: and permit me not to participate with others in
their offenses, nor to be involved in their crimes, by my consent and
connivency.

Return, my Soul, into thy rest, for thy Lord has done well for thee!

What have I in heaven? and what would I have on earth? O my God! thou art the
God of my heart, my part, my portion, and my inheritance for ever.

I desire to be dissolved, and to be with thee, my Lord and Savior! But who
will free me from the body of this death?

I would gladly be separated, not only from Sin, and the occasions thereof; but
even from this body of Sin which I can bear about me: That so being absolved
and dissolved, my departing soul might unspottedly ascend to her eternal rest,
in the very Act of this vehement and amorous Contrition.

Yes, my good and gracious Creator! I would willingly be sequestered from my
self and all creatures; that I might be totally united to thy self, my first
beginning, my final end, my hope, my happiness, my All.

It is good for me to stick fast to my Lord, to place my confidence in God my
Savior.

Let others seek other contents; I and my house will serve thee, our Lord and
Maker.

A Prayer after Confession.
O Merciful Redeemer of my Soul! what praise, love and thanks shall I return to
thee, for having made a Bath of thy Blood, and a Garment of thy Grace, to
cleanse and cloth my defiled and naked Soul in the Sacrament of Penance? Let
my Body, Soul, and all that is within me, bless thee eternally; and let Heaven,
Earth, and all that is within them, say Amen. Alleluja.

Receive, I beseech thee, ( O my dear Lord Jesu! by the bowels of thy Mercy, by
the breasts of thy Mother, and by the merits of all thy blessed Saints) this my
Confession: Let it be pleasing to thy sacred Majesty, and profitable to my own
Soul: Let thy infinite sweetness of love, and bitterness of sorrow, supply all
its defects: whether it be want of Contrition, or of Integrity, or of Humility,
or of Clarity, or of Simplicity, or of a true sense and feeling of my Sins
heynousness, or of a full Resolution of amendment, or any other Circumstance,
Negligence, or Error whatsoever.

Forget and forgive all the crimes; ingratitudes, impurities of my life past,
and in particular whatsoever (through my own carelessness) may have escaped my
memory, whatsoever the common Enemy may accuse me of, at the hour of my death,
and whatsoever thou (my dread Judge!) may in the rigor of thy Justice lay to
my charge at the day of thy dreadful Judgment.

I repenr me heartily for all that I have done amiss: I renounce all that is
opposite to thy perfect love and liking: I resolve to amend all, and to avoid
all sinful occasions: I resign body, soul, all, to do Penance, and make all
possible Satisfaction. And lastly, for thine own sake, (sweet Jesu!) I beseech
thee to pardon all: relying upon thy goodness, confiding in thy mercy,
rejoicing at what thou art, to wit, so loving, and so worthy of all love, so
good in thy self, so good to all others and so good to me, the least and worst
of all others.

Let all creatures join with my soul, to love, honor, serve and praise thee,
(her glorious Creator, her gracious Redeemer, her liberal Sanctifier) this day
and for all eternity.

And now (my Lord Jesu!) I here again lay down the whole burrhen of my Sins at
thy sacred Feet: and take up thy Cross in exchange: Resolving (by thy gracious
assistance) to pass on my lives pilgrimage, in the perpetual practice of
Penance, Patience, and Purity; abandoning Body, Soul, Goods, Limbs, Life, all
to thy service.

Accept my offer, (O dear Lord Jesu!) and admit me henceforth for one of thy
meanest Bondslaves; Let me live and die in the performance of this my promised
duty, obedience, and submission to thy holy Will and Precepts: Let me never
more offend thee; but loath and abhor the very name and shadow of Sin more than
Death or Hell it self.

Teach me, O Lord, how to persevere in thy love, and to correspond to my
vocation, with a zealous fervor joined with prudence and discretion: That
serving thee (my Sovereign Lord and Master!) during my abode in this prison of
Mortality, with fidelity, simplicity, sincerity; I may at the end of my lives
course, be received into immortality with security: and that as I here justly
sing forth thy Mercies, for having used such sweet and efficacious means to
bring my sinking Bark into the safe Haven: so I may there joyfully intone
eternal Canticles of thy Divine praises in thy Kingdom of glory Amen.

6. An easy, and necessary method, of Examining the Conscience: for the making
of a General Confession.
General Advertisements concerning General Confessions.
1. THe motive, which obliges all Christians, (who are desirous to perform
their Duty, and settle their souls in the state of Grace) to make a General
Confession, is only this:

When upon just and rational Grounds, (and not out of an erroneous or
scrupulous Understanding) they doubt of the Validity of any of their former
Confessions; by reason-of some essential Defect, which accompanied them.

The essential Defects, are [1.] Want of sufficient power and jurisdiction in
the Priest to whom their Confessions were made: Or, if he were so ignorant, so
deaf, so drunk, etc. as that probably he did not hear the Confessions, or not
rightly give the Absolution. [2.] Want of Contrition in the Penitent, (or of so
much Sorrow, as was absolutely necessary with the Sacrament:) or want of a
sufficient purpose of amendment. [3.] Want of Integrity in the Confession; when
the Penitent wittingly and willingly concealed any mortal Sin. In which cases,
it is absolutely necessary to reiterate, not only such Confessions; but all
that were made since any such committed Error.

2. As for other motives, (of Devotion and not of Obligation) inducing zealous
Christians to make General, or Annual Confessions: they are to be judged of, by
the prudent Ghostly Father, and his dictamen and counsel is therein to be
followed.

3. The Penitent therefore, who is desirous to make an exact general
Confession: (either as necessitated thereto, by reason of some Essential Defect
crept into his former Confessions; or advised thereto by his Ghostly Father:)
May do well (for his more orderly proceeding, and to avoid trouble,
tedidiousness and Confusion) to divide his whole life into three or four
estates, or stages. The first, from the time he had the use of reason, to the
time of his first Communion: or, (If he have been brought up in Heresy,) till
the time of his Conversion to the Catholic Faith. The Second, From that first
Communion or Conversion, till the time of his Marriage, or of his entrance into
Religion, or of his undertaking such an office, trade, employment, or of his
being made Priest, etc. The third, From that time, till he made his last exact
General Confession. The fourth, From that time till this present day.

Where note, That if the Penitent well remembers to have made good and sincere
Confessions, till he came to such an Age: or, that about ten or twenty years
past, or at such a time, be made an exact General Confession; He is in no sort
obliged to begin his Examination of Conscience any higher, than precisely from
such time as he doubts of the validity of his Confessions.

4. Having thus divided his life: He must apply himself to consider the Places
where he lived; the Persons with whom he conversed; and what was the chief part
of his charge, office, employment, and business: That so he may find out (that
which is indeed the main matter and greatest difficulty in the making an exact
General Confession; to wit,) The number of his sins in their several kinds and
species.

5. If he has been so habituated to some one or more particular sins, as that
he daily and customarily committed them: it suffices to declare, that he so
long time, for so many years, or months, wallowed therein.

6. If the Custom was not so continual, nor the Acts so frequent; It suffices
to say, That he was given to such a Sin, for so long a time, during which, he
fell each month, or each week so often.

7. Because the frailty of men's Memory is so great, that they can scarcely give
in the particular number of their Sins; It suffices to say, I have fallen into
such a Sin so many times, to wit 40. or 50. times, or thereabouts.

8. If one has been formerly an Heretic, It is sufficient to say, I continued
so long in such an Heresy, to wit a Protestant, Puritan, etc. resisting Gods
Grace and Call, etc without specifying such other Crimes as are inseparable
from heresy, as not having during that time observed the Fasts, Feasts, etc.
Unless he has also committed other Crimes, which are against the common laws
of nature and Christianity, which must be specified.

9. As for the time which is requisite for the Examination of Conscience, in
order to a General Confession; it must be so much as is sufficient, according
to the Judgment of a prudent and discreet man, (the Penitents dexterity being
considered.)

10. Let such over-scrupulous Penitents, as torment themselves, and trouble
their Ghostly Fathers with long and unnecessary relations of the circumstances
of their Sins, rest confident and assured: That it is (morally speaking)
impossible, for the greatest Sinner in the world, to have committed any Crime,
which is not either expressed or intimated in this following Catalogue: Let
them therefore satisfy themselves to have deliberatly and impartially examined
themselves upon these points) and Confes'd such Sins accordingly, wherein they
found themselves culpable; adding briefly such only essential Circumstances, as
may alter the species of the crime.

11. Retiring therefore your self into some quiet and convenient place: and
taking sufficient time for your Examination; whether it be for the space of 5.
or 6. hours together, or at diverse interrupted times, and upon several days,
(which is better and less painful,) having Pen and Paper in readiness, and your
Confessional open before you.

You are first to place your self in the Divine presence: imploring the
assistance of the Holy Ghost, and the prayers of the Blessed Virgin, of your
Angel Guardian, and of your particular Patrons, that you may truly know your
Sins, and be sincerely sorry for them.

Then you are to represent to your self the infinite greatness and goodness
of your Creator, by you so grievously offended, and the Image of your Crucified
Savior covered with blood and wounds for the love of your ungrateful and
ungracious Soul, which has again crucified him; as often as she has committed
Mortal Sins: which considerations, must needs touch your heart with a lively
Sorrow and Contrition.

12. This done, you are to examine your self, upon each one of the Commandments
of God, and of the Church: For to commit a Sin, is no other thing, than to do
that, which God or his Church forbids you: or not to do that, which they
command you.

But before you begin your Examination upon the Commandments: you shall do well
to examine your self in general upon these following Articles; marking with your
Pen, or setting down on your Paper, wherein you shall find your self guilty.

General Heads, whereupon you are first to Examine your self.
1. HAve you incurred any Excommunication, or Censure?

2. Have you any Case, reserved to the Pope, or to the Church?

3. Have you made Sacrilegious Confessions? that is, have you through fear,
shame, or malice, concealed any mortal Sin (or which you conceived to be a
mortal Sin) in Confession?

4. How long since did you make such a Confession? how many such Confessions?
how often have you said Mass, communicated, administered, or received Sacraments,
being in this condition?

5. Do you still continue in the direct and evident occasions of committing the
same Sin? Why have you not quitted them? Will you not now quit them? without
which Resolution, you can obtain no Absolution.

6. Are you obliged to make Restitution of goods unlawfully taken, kept, stolen,
or any way by you unjustly possessed? or of your Neighbors honor and good
name? Have you not made this Restitution, (to which you knew your self obliged)
out of covetousness or out of malice, or out of negligence? Are you now
resolved to do it?

7. Have you wilfully omitted the performance of the Penances, which were
enjoined you by your Ghostly Father, and by you accepted?

Declare these things (as you find your self guilty) at the beginning of your
Confession; That your Ghostly Father may know the state of your Soul,
understand his own Power and perform his Duty.

The first Commandment. Thou shall have no other God but me.

12. To suspect others rashly and without grounds.

13. To interpret others actions, words, proceedings, in an ill sense.

Then let him Examine himself upon the six Precepts of the Church, which are

1. To keep the Holy Days appointed, by hearing of Mass, and forbearing to Work.

2. To keep Abstinence, and to fast upon such days as are appointed.

3. To Confess your Sins once in the year, to your Pastor.

4. To Communicate at Easter.

5. To pay Tithes to your Pastors.

6. Not to marry at certain times, nor within certain degrees of Kindred.

Afterward upon the seven deadly Sins: which are, Pride, Covetousness, Envy,
Luxury, Gluttony, Sloth, Anger.

Moreover upon the three Powers of the Soul, which are, the Memory, the
Understanding, the Will.

And upon the Five Senses of the Body, to wit, the Sight, the Hearing, the
Taste, the Smell, the Touch.

Also upon the Sins, which you may commit in the person of author; which are
commonly reduced to Nine; and are comprehended in these Latin Verses, Juffio,
Consilium, Consensus Palpo, Recursus,
Participans, Mutus, Non obstans, Non manifestans.
That is, 1. By Command. 2. By Counsel. 3. By Consent. 4. By Flattery, Praise,
or Adulation. 5. By Defense, or Protection. 6. By Participation. 7. By Silence.
8. By not hindering. 9. By not manifesting.

Then reflect upon the Six Circumstances, which aggravate or diminish the
grievousness of the Sin.

1. THe Place: Whether it was sacred or profane.

2. The Time: Whether Sunday, Holyday, or Working-day.

3. The Person: Whether a Churchman, or a Secular, Married or Single.

4. The Condition: Whether Superior, equal, inferior.

5. The Companions: Whether with Parents, Kindred, one, many.

6. The End: with what intention you did it.

These Circumstances sometimes make that a Mortal Sin, which of its own nature
is only Venial. As if you take away a small thing from another, to the end he
should blaspheme God. Sometimes they change the Species of the Sins: as Theft
committed in the Church is Sacriledg. Sometimes they multiply the Sins: as to
eat flesh upon a Friday in Leat. Sometimes they bring an Excommunication upon
you, besides the Sin; as to strike a Priest. Sometimes they exceedingly
Aggravate the Sin; as to be forsworn upon a Sunday: or, For a Priest to be
forsworn, etc.

Besides these General Heads of Sins, before specified, Priests and Religious
Persons are to examine themselves upon such things as concern their particular
Vocation and Obligation.

Also Merchants, Shop keepers Artificers, and Tradesmen are to examine their
Consciences upon the particular crimes, which belong to their respective
Callings, As for example:

1. TO Sell or Buy, with false Weights, false Measures, etc.

2. Having sold any Wares, to foist in one for another; Or to deliver out that
to the Buyer, which is of less worth and value.

3. To Sell much over, or Buy much under the just price of the things bought or
sold; by reason of the Buyers or Sellers ignorance, or necessity, or confidence.

4. To make a Monopoly with your fellow Merchants; or to Buy up all sorts of
such or such Wares, that you may afterward fell them at your own rates.

5. To sell falsified Wares: as to sell that cloth for a scarlet, which you
know is not; or the like.

6. To sell any Wares, Drugs, or other things, which you know (or probably
doubt) will be employed to an evil use: Especially poisonous drugs, or any
death instruments.

7. To envy those of your own Trade, Employment, Condition; To undervalue
their Persons, or Merchandise, to draw Customers from them.

8. Not to work faithfully, but to make slight and deceitful ware, and selling
them for good, etc.

After your General Confession.
1. HAving examined your Conscience impartially upon these particulars, with a
reasonable and (morally) sufficient diligence: And having made your Confession
sincerely, and bona fide, (according to your memory and understanding) of all
such mortal crimes, whereof you found your self guilty, or which you were
doubtful to have committed: (For you are not bound, neither indeed ought you to
confess Venial Sins, in your General Confessions, to avoid prolixity and
tediousness:)

You are not to reflect any more upon your past sins: (except only by way of a
general detestation of them all:) but to persuade your self (as it is most
certain) that they are all pardoned and remitted by the Sacramental absolution
which you have now received.

2. And if any thing occurs to your memory, as not truly confessed, or not
fully expressed: Resist it, and rest satisfied in this Consideration (before
specified, and here repeated) That it is almost impossible, that any such sin
was not sufficiently comprehended, confessed, and by you expressed; since you
willingly omitted nothing of moment, of all the sins here before mentioned.

3. Scrupulous Penitents are not bound to make a new Confession, (after this
General one) of any sin whatsoever; unless they can positively swear, that they
committed it, and that they did not Confess it.

4. And every Penitent ought to submit his judgment, (in this point of
Confessing again, or not Confessing) to the dictamen of his Ghostly Father,
(supposing he is one generally held to be sufficiently discreet, learned, and
experienced:) For in this case to believe and obey him, is an act both of
Christian virtue and prudence; and it is impossible, that God (who is goodness
it self, and who has said, He that hears you, hears me,) should damn any one
for such an omission.

5. He must therefore confidently permit himself and the care of his Salvation
to his good God and his discreet Ghostly Father, having performed on his own
part all that he conceived necessary.

An Act of Contrition, to be made before and after your General Confession.
O My Sovereign Creator, and sweet Redeemer! Humbly prostrate at the feet of
thy dread Majesty; I acknowledge the Multitude and Greatness of the Crimes,
which I have committed against thy Divine goodness. I acknowledge them, (O my
gracious Lord God!) with all possible shame and confusion; and I abhor them,
with as much sense of Sorrow, as my Heart is capable of.

Yes, (my good God!) It most heartily grieves me to have so heinously offended
thee: Not only by reason of the Benefits which I have received from thy
bounty, and abused by my ingratitude; though I have just cause to be
exceedingly afflicted upon this consideration: Nor for having forfeited my
right and title to Heaven and eternal felicity, though I make my earnest suit
to thy Throne of Mercy, that it may be again restored unto me: Nor for having
deserved Hell, and eternal punishments; though I conjure thy paternal Clemency
to deliver me from it: But principally, and (as near as I can) only because my
Crimes are displeasing, opposite, and offensive to thy infinitely amiable
Goodness; which merely for its own sake, ought to be most sincerely,
affectionatly, and gratefully honored and obeyed by all thy creatures,
although they could neither hope for any Recompense, nor should dread any
Punishment.

In testimony of this my true sorrow, I here protest in thy presence, (O my
God!) that were all the felicities of Heaven annihilated, and the fires of Hell
extinguished; so that there were no other good expected by serving thee than
the sole rendering of my due love, gratitude and obedience; nor any other evil
incurred by not serving thee, than the sole depriving thee of thy due Honor: I
would (and do even at this very instant) begin to love, honor, and serve thy
sacred Majesty, with as much fidelity as my former excesses, have had
disloyalty.

Give me pardon (O merciful Maker!) for my past Sins and Impieties; and grace
to amend for the future: And though I am most unworthy to have my Prayers
heard, or my Petition granted; because I am so enormous an offender: yet (O
merciful Father!) look upon thy meek Son Jesus, whose precious Blood I present
unto thee; And beg for his dear sake, that thou will be propitious to me, a
wretched Sinner.

. 7.
Eight Exercises, transferred hither our of our Spiritual Conquest: to the end
that such Fundamental practices of sublime and solid Piety may be always ready
at hand for the daily use of devout Christians, both before and after
Communion: and in which they may also (according to each ones fervor and
opportunity) very profitably employ themselves, after their Morning Exercise
(as it were) in the way of a Canonical Office; for which reason, they are
distinguished, (like the precedent Exercises of Christian Virtues, which may be
practiced in the same manner,) into Seven Points, correspondent to the Seven
Hours of the Church Service.
The First Exercise, Which is the Ground work of all Prayer and Introversion;
and which alone (being performed with requisite diligence, discretion and
perseverance,) will speedily and infallibly afford unspeakable Comfort and
spiritual Profit to the pious Practicer thereof: As being indeed the end of all
other external Exercises, and the short, sure, simple, and Regia via, leading
to a Devout and Divine life.
THis Exercise consists of Three parts in general, and Nine points in
particular.

1. Preparation of three acts. 1. An affective and lively apprehension of Gods
presence. 2. A cordial and profound act of humility. 3. A pure intention to
please and praise God only.


2. Consideration of 1. Our Wounds, both internal and external. 2. Our Wants,
which are many in every degree. 3. Our Wishes, and humble desires.


3. Conclusion also of three acts. 1. Contrition for our Sins. 2. Resignation
in our wants. 3. Complacence in God, and Confidence in his Goodness.


A practical description of this Exercise.
The first part is Preparation, of three Acts.
1. A lively apprehension of Gods presence, not only in all places, and in all
creatures, by his Power and Essence; but in our Souls by his Mercy, Love, Care,
and Providence.
O My Soul! Where are we? who sees us? What is he that is with us, and within
us? By whose light we see, by whose fire we burn, and by whose love we live?
Live, my most glorious and gracious Lord! in whose presence I kneel, in whose
arms I rest, and after whose love I breath: O that thou were as dear to my soul
as thou art near it! Alas, why does she not care as much for her God, as he
does for her good? Why do I not love thy presence, (O my amiable Lord!) since
thou art present by love?

Thou art my Father, my Physician, and my Food, hear me, heal me, help me: I am
wicked, I am wounded, I am wretched: Out of thee there is no place of rest;
without thee there is no hope of happiness; remain therefore with me; and reign
within me; Let me be thine, all thine, ever thine.

2. Profound and cordial Humility, acknowledging unfainedly before God and his
Angels, our wickedness, weakness, and wretchedness; what we are, and what we
deserve; and so resting quiet in the Center of our own Nothing.
O My Soul! What have we been? What are we? What have we? What can we do? What
do we deserve? What do we desire? What has our loving Father and liberal Lord,
that he has not given us? What have we, proud and prodigal Children, that we
have not received from his merciful hand and heart? What have we received, that
we have not abused by self-love or self-delight?

O sweet Jesu! Give tears to my eyes, words to my tongue, sighs to my heart,
and love to my spirit; for I need them all to deplore my misery, and implore
thy mercy; to admire thy beauty, and adore thy bounty; to sigh after thee, and
suffer for thee: What I have been, it grieves me to remember; What I am, after
so many signal benefits on thy part, and serious promises on mine, I am ashamed
to think; What I deserve I am afraid to call to mind; What I desire I am
ignorant how to ask. Lord, for thy Mercies sake, for thy Mothers sake; by thy
Bowels of mercy, and her Breasts of meekness; by all that thou have suffered
for me, and she for thee; by all that is dear to thee in Heaven and Earth;
Forget and forgive what I have been, my past folly and wickedness; Pity and
protect what I am, my present frailty and weakness: Be satisfied for what I
deserve; supply what I desire; and be mindful of me in life and death.

How much, (O my God!) do I wish to leave all, and lose my self to find thee?
to humble my self to please thee? and to hate my self, to love thee? But these
hard and high matters I dare scarcely promise; how then and when shall I
practice them? Yet without thee, (O Sacred Humility!) there is no solid center
to rest in, no true sweetness to take gust in: therefore (O my God!) I come to
thy School to learn this necessary Lesson; teach me, touch me, wound me, and
win me unto thy self.

3. Pure intention, to please and praise God only: to be all his, ever his, in
what manner and measure he best likes, both in this Prayer, and all things
whatsoever.
BEhold therefore, (O my Lord) how out of pure Obedience to thy Will, and
confidence in thy Mercy, I now approach to please and praise thy divine
Majesty: Not to receive great matters from thee, for I am unworthy; nor to
conceive great matters of thee, for I am incapable; but to leave all for thee,
to be humble of heart beyond all, and to love thee more than all: this is
conform both to my Condition and Obligation. I come to Prayer, (O my only Lord
and love!) not to have much, but to give up all, to be thine, all thine, ever
thine, in life and death, for time and eternity, as thy self best pleases; I
come (O my center and sweetness!) to seek thee and sigh after thee; yet I am
content neither to find thee nor feel thee, but only to see thee by faith, and
to suffer for thee with fidelity. I am satisfied and content that thou art so
good, great, glorious, rich and happy in thy self: and I am confident that thou
in thy good time wilt make me rich in thy mercy, and happy in thy love; for in
this Pilgrimage I desire no other happiness than true humility, nor greater
riches than naked Charity.

The second part is Consideration; showing three things, first to our selves,
and then to our Sovereign Lord and Maker.
1. Our Wounds both internal and external: to wit, our Sins, Ingratitudes,
Daily failings, strong Passions, etc.
AH! my sick and sinful soul! How weak and Wounded are we in every degree, in
all parts, in each member of body, and faculty of mind? 1. All is out of order,
all is pride and self-love: how impenitent are we in sorrowing? how impatient
in suffering? how unconstant in persevering? and yet how importunate in
sinning? 2. My Understanding is blind to good, clear-sighted to evil; My Will
is perverse, peevish, cold, sensual; My Memory is weak, full of idle images,
subject to distractions. 3. My Affections are vain, my Passions violent, my
Inclinations vicious. 4. My Faith is little, my Hope less, my Charity least of
all. 5. So forward to extroversion and dissolution, so backward to introversion
and compunction, so full of imperfections, and immortifications. 6. So little
confidence in my Saviors mercy, so little patience, in my misery, and almost
no performance of my good purposes. 7. So curious to censure others, so
careless to keep my self and curb my own senses. Finally, all is self-love,
self-will, self-conceit, self-seeking, pride, propriety, partiality; which are
my daily and dangerous diseases.

O Father of Mercies, and only Phisician of my Soul! Thou art Almighty, and
Allbounty; these are my wounds and impurities, and if thou will, thou can
both cure and cleanse me; and if thou will not, I will remain content as I am:
I am willing to continue weak, so I be not wicked; to be wearied and wounded,
so I be not utterly tired, overturned, defeated, and lose the victory: Cut,
kill, crucify, O Lord, only spare me for eternity.

2. Our Wants: for we are not only needy, but naked; not only poor, but
beggars; who neither know how to deserve an alms, nor how to desire it.
O My poor Soul! What do we want? nay what do we not want? 1. True light, true
liberty, true love, true life. 2. A settled attention, a simple intention, a
serious introversion, a sincere conversion. 3. Humility of heart, conformity of
will, purity of soul, indifferency of spirit. 4. Wisdom to know Gods Will,
strength to execute it, patience to persevere in it. 5. Resolution to suffer
for our Savior, devotion to sigh after him, diligence to find him, constancy
to remain with him. 6. Courage to endure all, Faith to forgo all, Hope to
expect all, Charity to give all, and Confidence to gain all. Finally, we want
all we should have, Yet our loving Lord is ready to bestow on us all that he
has.

O my God and all! Thou art all that I want; give me thy self, and all my wants
and wishes will be at an end. Thou art all my safety and my only security, all
my refuge and my only center: until I can return unto thee, or wholly turn into
thee, let thy Cross be my Purgatory, and thy Will my Paradise, for other heaven
upon earth I can never hope to find: Until then, I must be content to sweat and
sigh under the burden of this mortal life; to sit like Job upon a dunghill,
forlorn and forsaken by all, full of sores and sorrows; to remain a perpetual
and pitiful patient, scarcely feeling patience in my self, and finding no
compassion in others.

3. Our Wishes and desires. What can a wounded wretch wish, but to be cared for
and cured? What can a naked beggar desire, but to be clothed and comforted
with some few rags and crumbs? What can a blind and cold person ask, but light
and love?
THis, (O my Sovereign and sweet Lord!) is the sum and substance of all my
wishes and requests. O that I could go out of my self, and get into thee! O
that I were dissolved from my loathed body, to the end I might dilate my heart
in thy love, contemplate thy divine face in perfect liberty, and please and
praise thee eternally! for in this prison of flesh and vale of tears, I faint
under the weight of temptations, I fall under the burden of my troubles, and I
continually fail in the prosecution of my pious purposes.

Oh! that thy Will did so rule me, and reign over me, that it were a torment to
decline never so little from it! O that thy Love did so freely and fully
possess my heart, that there were no room at all remaining for any bastard or
base love of things created!

Good Jesu! how truly happy and holy should I be, if I could clearly behold my
own nothing, in thy All; If I could embrace crosses as Crowns, and swallow down
all contempts and confusions, as milk and honey! O when shall I be so elevated
in spirit above my self, by ecstasy of love, as to be able and willing to
humble my self under all creatures without repugnancy!

Alas! Shall I never be content to forsake all, and be forsaken by all? Yea,
having lost and left all for One, to be left by that One, who is my All? and so
remain quiet in my own nothing. How long shall I lie wallowing in flesh and
blood! how long shall I delay, and dally in false loves? How long shall I sigh,
and not enjoy! Seek, and not find; live, and not love?

Come, my Lord, and Love! Lord Jesu, come quickly; Let the fire of thy sweet
love so consume in me all dross of self-love, and so transform my spirit into
thee, that I may take all from thee indifferently, give all to thee liberally,
and rest and repose in thee eternally.

Lord! Let me be thine, or nothing; Love, or not live!

The third Part is the Conclusion, which consists also of three Acts.
1. Contrition, which is a hearty and humble Sorrow for our Sins, Ingratitudes,
Disloyalties, Tepidities, etc.
O My God! How little did I love thee when I so carelessly offended thy divine
Majesty? Oh! that I had never sinned mortally, though it had cost me my life
immediately! O that I were sure never more to swerve from thy Sacred Will and
Commandments! Let me henceforth endure (dear Jesu!) a thousand deaths of my
body, rather than admit one deadly sin again into my soul! O pity and pardon my
past follies and frailties, and prevent me with thy gracious blessings against
future failings.

How great (O Lord) is my obligation to serve and please thee, were it but for
thy favors conferred, thy benefits bestowed, and thy love powered out upon me?
and yet, (ungrateful wretch that I am!) how poorly have I corresponded!

Oh! that I had so deep a sense of my Sins, that my Heart might break with
sorrow? Hide not, (O Lord!) thy face from me, shut not up thy Mercy gates
against me: for though I have most grievously gone astray, yet I am resolved
upon an entire amendment, correction, reformation of my whole man: this strong
Resolution, (which is thy gracious gift) grounds my hope in thy goodness,
emboldens my confidence in thy mercy, and gives me courage and comfort in thy
love.

2. Resignation in all our Wants, Wishes, Desolations and Distresses, to the
divine Will and pleasure.
I Am indifferent, (O my dear Lord!) to sickness and health, to light and
darkness, to delight and desolation: I am thine (sweet Jesu!) put me where thou will, do with me as thou will, send me what thou will! I am content, not only
to have nothing, but to be nothing, so thou (O my Lord!) be all things unto me!
I acknowledge my self unworthy to beg, and less worthy to obtain; and therefore
I resign my self still to beg, and yet still to want, even that which I most
wish; which is, all Light, all Liberty, all Love, all Comfort, all Content,
yea, even all Virtue, Peace and Perfection, so long as it shall please thee! O
Father, I am thine, ever thine, all thine, body and soul, for time and
eternity. Live Jesus only.

3. Complacence and Confidence; the first, that our God is what he is; the next
that he will heal our Wounds, supply our Wants, satisfy our Wishes, and turn
all to our good.
I Am glad, (O my gracious Lord God!) that thou art so worthy of all love,
though I of all others am not worthy to love thee: I am as joyful for what thou
art, (O great God!) as if all thou have were all mine, and I will love thee in
all I am, and have, as being all thine. Thy Cross is my comfort, thy Will my
welfare; and thy Love my life: so that if I can but suffer for thee, do thy
will, and follow thy love, I shall do all that is necessary.

I am indeed dry, dark, and desolate; but since it is thy will, I am sure it is
my good, and therefore sufficient for me, and satisfactory to thee I hope thou will one day complete thy own heavenly design in my soul; healing my Wounds,
supplying my Wants, fulfilling my desires, and filling my yet empty heart with
thy sweet presence and perfect love: In the mean space I will say and sing;
Live Jesus, Live my Lord, my love, my life, my all! whose name be blessed by
all, whose will be accomplished in all, whose honor be advanced above all.

An Advertisement touching the precedent exercise.
1. WE must perform it daily, diligently, discreetly, and with great confidence
and courage. 2. Yet without propriety, that it may neither hinder the operation
of the Holy Ghost within, nor Works of due obligation and obedience without. 3.
If in the practice of this Introversion we find dryness, and feel little
devotion, we may sometimes fitly resume (in lieu of the second part, or
consideration) our wonted exercises, whereto our minds are more addicted:
ending the same with the Conclusion here prescribed; being ever duly disposed
to follow the holy Spirits invitation to higher matters.

The Second Exercise. Of the knowledge of God, and Confidence in Him.
1. Our Chief Happiness consists in knowing God.
TO know thee, (O divine Fountain of goodness) is to be truly happy; and yet
none can know thee (O boundless and bottomless Sea of all perfection!) but
through thy own manifestation and mercy: Vouchsafe therefore, I beseech thee,
(O most loving and liberal Lord!) to enter into this poor and empty heart of
thy meanest servant, to inform my ignorant soul, with a glimps of this
necessary Science, and to inflame my cold affection with a small spark of thy
holy love.

O Omnipotent Creator of Heaven and Earth! both which thou fillest with thy
greatness and glory: O God of infinite power, excellent wisdom, unmeasurable
goodness, and incomprehensible Love! my soul thirsts after thee, the essential
source of all felicity; my heart seeks thee, the proper place of its repose, it
sighs to thee, the natural center of all its hope and happiness. In thy blessed
mind (O my God!) it first rested in its eternal possibility and similitude;
thither it must again return, and there it must either rest eternally, or
perish for evermore: O let it now find thee, that it may ever love thee.

2. Ecstasies, Admirations, and Adorations of the Divinity.
O Lord, most good, glorious, and gracious; most blessed and bountiful; most
high and holy; most excellent and ineffable; What words or thoughts can express
thy purity and perfection? Let me know thee, O amiable life of my soul! Let me
see thee, O true light of my eyes! Let me seek thee, O only solace of my
spirit! Let me find thee, O desired of my heart! Let me embrace thee, O my
heavenly Spouse! Let me possess thee, O Sovereign sweetness, and full satiety
of all my inward and outward senses. O that my heart could always think on
thee, my Will ever love thee, my mind still remember thee, my understanding
continually conceive thee, my reason perpetually adhere to thee, and my whole
man incessantly praise thee! O hide not thy face from me, my joy, my light, and
my life! If I may not see thee and live, O let me die that I may see thee; I
desire to die here, and be dissolved; that I may see thee, know thee, come to
thee, live with thee, and love thee eternally.

O ever blessed and glorious Divinity, O Father, who of thine own substance,
bring forth an ineffable goodness, coequal, consubstantial, and coeternal
with thy self, which is thy Son: O Father and Son, who loving each other with
infinite charity and content, are united together in one Holy Ghost, equally
and unspeakably proceeding from you both! I admire you, adore you, and worship
yon with all the powers of my body and soul.

3. An absolute Oblation of all to the divine Majesty.
O Sacred Deity! O Tri-unity, and Vni-trinity! O Father, Son and Holy Ghost!
Holy, holy, holy Lord God of Hosts, who were, art, and shall be for ever
Almighty; I thy poor creature, prostrate before the Throne of thy divine
Majesty, from the abyss of my own nothing, invoke, adore and acknowledge thee
the abyss of all perfections: I present thee with all thy own gifts, goods and
excellencies, which thou have plentifully poured out upon all thy creatures: I
offer up to thy praise, the affections of Angels and Men: the properties of the
Elements; the beauty and motion of the whole Universe, and the essence of all
being: O that my soul were capable to comprise unitedly all their several
affections and perfections! how joyfully would it employ them in thy praise?
how sweetly would it melt away in thy presence? Behold, O my God, I make an
entire Oblation of them all: I acknowledge and adore thee with them all; and
desire to do it, as frequently as I take breath, and as often as there are
minutes in time, stars in the firmameat, stands in the Ocean, and numbers in
all nature.

O my Lord, whose love is the life of my Soul, increase my knowledge of thee,
that I may enlarge my love to thee: Alas! I love thee not, (O amiable Lord
God!) because I know thee not: I know thee not, because darkness and sin has
covered and encompassed my understanding: Wherefore, O bright light, who
illuminatest all things, expel this darkness from my Soul, drive off those
clouds from my Understanding, and draw the curtain from off the face of the
abyss of my Mind, that I may see and know thee, and then I shall not choose but
love thee.

O my dear Jesu, show me thy divin Father; dart a beam of thy heavenly splendour
into my dull heart, that I may have some degree of that holy science, which may
help me in thy love, make me obedient to thy will, and resolute in thy service.

To know all things of this world, (O Jesu!) and not to know thee, is but
ignorance and folly: let me therefore know thy eternal Father, and thy Self
whom he has sent for my Salvation; and it suffices me. O give me this
knowledge, that I may give thee my love, and I ask no more. Let me be unknowing,
ignorant, and a fool in all other things, so I may wisely know thee only, O my
God, and my All.

4. An humble acknowledgment of Gods high perfections.
O King of Glory, I acknowledge thy perfections to be above all knowledge, but
that of thy own divine Understanding: I confess that thy height is unreachable,
thy goodness unchangeable, thy greatness incomprehensible, thy light
inaccessible: And all other thy divine attributes and perfections are so mighty
and so many, so good and so glorious, so excellent and so admirable, so worthy
and so wonderful, that were all the Power and Prerogatives, all the virtue,
wisdom and qualities of all creatures united in one individual nature, it were
not so much in respect of thy glory and greatness, as the least drop of water
is in comparison of the vast Ocean. Wherefore, I beg of thee, (O immense and
inaccessible Godhead!) only so much to know, conceive, believe and understand
of thy hidden Majesty, as may efficaciously move my will to thee; and I content
my self with so much light of thy divinity, as may force me to love thee
ardently, effectually, perseverantly.

O my Lord, and my Love! Fill my heart with the sweet influence of thy heavenly
grace, that I may in some measure discover how good and gracious thou art to
me, and to all thy creatures! O let me still remember thy mecry, ever dread thy
Justice, and continually admire and adore thy Power and Providence.

Ah! my noble Soul, stamped with thy Creators lovely image, endowed with the
excellencies of Understanding to know him, of Will to love him, of Memory to
rest in him; why adherest thou not fast to him only in pure and perfect
delight, forgetting and forgoing all sensible and worldly Objects?

5. Fervent wishes and desires to love and serve God.
O That I were so ravished with thy love and liking, (My only amiable Lord
God!) that through joy, jubily, and admiration, I might feel no self at all, no
sense, no change, no inequality! That no prosperity might puff me up, no
adversity deject me, no accident separate me from thee, (O my God of infinite
love and liberality!)

O that I could be ever joyful in thee, ever grateful to thee, and ever mindful
of thy inhabiting presence within me! Thou art always nearer to my Soul, (O my
good God!) than my Soul is to my Body, always conserving, counselling,
disposing, directing, inciting and inspiring it to thy Love; and will thou not,
(O my senseless and sinful soul!) be always cautious and circumspect how thou
behavest thy self in thy Lords presence, who is so tenderly careful of thy
safety? O let his love be no longer neglected, his sweet invitations no longer
slighted: O that thou would henceforth walk before him as befits his chaste
and holy Spouse, with all respect and reverence, fear and fidelity, courage and
constancy! preparing thy self diligently for his divine embraces.

6. Admirations of Gods bounty and benefits, and Resolutions of corresponding
thereto.
GRant, I beseech thee, (O mighty and merciful Creator!) that my whole time and
thoughts may be totally taken up in the contemplation of thy unmeasurable
benefits and bounty toward me. For I know, Lord, that I am truly nothing, and
yet thou carest for me, (O my loving Maker!) as if thou had no other creature
in heaven or earth; thou deliverest me from innumerable dangers; thou adornest
me with many gifts and graces; thou give me leave at all times to have free
access to thy Throne of Mercy, so that with one holy thought, one humble sigh,
one devout desire, I may draw near to thee, and enjoy thee, and in thee all
comfort and content: O divine privilege! To discover to thee my Wants, lay open
my Wounds, and boldly declare my Wishes, as to my nearest, dearest, and
trustiest friend and familiar, and to be sure of supplies, salves, and succor
in all my necessities! O what Goodness, what Grace, what Mercy is this?

O my Soul! How loving and liberal a Lord have we? how loving in Mercy, how
liberal in bounty? Ah! our unthankfulness to requite, our unworthiness to
deserve his favors.

Up my heart, be no longer ungrateful and unfaithful to so great, good, and
gracious a benefactor. Yes, (O blessed and bountiful Giver!) I now say
cordially, and will ever stand to it courageously; I will henceforth love thee
my Lord, my love, my life, my strength, my support, my home, my harbor, and my
happiness. I will remember thy sweet words to all sinners; Why will you perish,
O children? As I live I desire not the death of a sinner, but that he would
turn to me and live. I will behold thy sacred wounds suffered for me, able to
move a rock to love and compassion: And though I am ashamed to think what I
have been, how little I have done, how much thou have endured for me, how long
thou have expected me, how lovingly thou have sought me, and how poorly I have
corresponded to thee; Yet I know (O my Lord!) thou ceasest not to be God and
good, though I am weak and wicked. Therefore I will yet take courage in thy
service; and confidently hope, that thou who have sought after me a lost sheep,
wilt mercifully receive me now I seek after thee my loving Shepherd, with a
right intention, real resolution, and inflamed affection.

7. Acts of Confidence, and purposes of Perseverance in the divine love and
service.
YEs, (O my Lord and my Love!) heaven and earth shall sooner perish, than my
Confidence in thy sweet mercies, and my Saviors merits: If thou repellest me,
I will run after thee; if thou shuttest the door against me, I will never leave
knocking; and if thou killest me, yet will I trust in thee. I wholly cast my
self upon thy holy Will, Providence, and Protection. I protest with heart and
mouth, that I now am, and henceforth will be entirely thine; that I have
nothing, seek nothing, fear nothing, desire nothing, demand nothing, want
nothing, will nothing, but thee only, My Lord, my Love, and my All.

And I firmly purpose to serve and love thee (O sacred and supreme Majesty!)
simply, sincerely, purely, and perseverantly, not for any fear of pains or
punishment, not for any self-interest of what this world can offer, or the next
afford; not for the least hope of Heaven or happiness: but I will thee, seek
thee, and love thee for thy self only, (O my All-sufficient Lord God!) who art
the sole object, sweet compleatment, and solid contentment of my soul. Pardon
me, protect me, and provide for me, for thou art my only hope and happiness.

The Third Exercise. Of the knowledge of, and diffidence in our selves.
1. A total Abnegation of our selves, and Relation to the divine Providence.
WHat is man, (O omnipotent Creator!) what is this man, that thou should be
so mindful of him? He is a mere nothing, (Lord!) and I am the least and worst
of those nothings; because I have least corresponded to thy grace, and made
worst use of thy gifts. O give me light; reach forth thy hand to this blind
creature, crying after thee, O true light of the world, and life of my Soul!
that now at length I may duly, diligently, cordially and abyssally dive into my
own baseness, weakness, misery, nothing: that knowing what I truly am, I may
really loath, hate, distrust, despise, and deny my self, and all my own
proceedings; sincerely love thee, only trust and hope in thee, and rely wholly
upon thy divine Providence and Protection.

I am not only content (O my Lord God!) but even willing and desirous, that all
thy creatures should take me and treat me according to my true condition and
unworthiness; And I am resolved by thy grace to humble my self, not only under
thy mighty hand, but also under all their feet, as their servant and slave, to
be trodden on, abhorred, avoided, and detested by them all, as a sink of sin and
filthiness.

I will be desirous to be esteemed and used as Dross among Metals, Chaff among
Grain, a Wolf among Sheep, and as Satan amongst the Children of God.

I acknowledge my self unworthy of all grace and comfort from God or man, and
worthy of all pain, punishment, crosses, contradiction, confusion, desolation,
death, damnation. I will be henceforth ashamed to complain of any aggrievances,
and be content to suffer whatsoever the World, the Devil, and Hell it self, can
inflict upon me.

2. A rational consideration of what we are, were, and shall be.
ANd to strengthen this my resolution, I will rationally consider before thee,
(O my Lord!) what I really am? what I was? and what will become of me? both
touching my body, my soul, and my whole being?

Ay me! I have a body all clay, a soul all sin, a life all frailty, a substance
all nothing. And this is all I have to vaunt of in thy presence, O my Lord and
my Maker!

My material part, is but slime of the earth, the very worst part of the
unworthiest Element. Ah poor man! and can thou look so big, who came from
so base an extraction? Be ashamed to lift up thy head, vile mud and dirt, since
thy pedigree is so well known, and the ingredients of thy being are so mean and
contemptible.

And when I consider what this my body was in the womb, how it was conceived in
concupiscence, nourished with filthiness, and brought up in darkness; I am
ashamed to own my own beginning, which is so horrid and loathsome; and who then
can justly boast of state, strength, beauty, or nobility, since the groundwork
of all is but a little dung and corruption?

Ah poor worm! what a dismal prison were thou detained in, for nine months
space of thy time! What nasty and poisonous food was thy diet? how wretched was
thy birth? how weak and woeful thy infancy? and what art thou in thy best and
most flourishing condition in the world, but a clog and cage to thy inthrall'd
soul; a painted sack, or pargetted sepulcher, full of filth, froth, and ordure?
O my Lord! give me grace to frame an impartial judgment of what I am, and then
how soon shall I check all risings of pride and presumption?

3. We deplore our own misery, and implore Gods mercy.
I Came into this world (O my Lord!) with groans and tears, I live in it with
griefs and cares, I shall go out of it with pangs and fears, and lastly I must
become a horror to the eyes of my dearest friends, a prey of vermin, and a
companion of rottenness. Ah! how can thou be proud of thy perfections, poor
clay and ashes? why should thou look to be so highly prized, and so daintily
pampered, thou stinking puddle? Dust thou art, and to dust thou must return.
Have thou not always before thine eyes these ashes for thy glass, and death for
thy mistress; why then do thou suffer so many sparkles of vanity to arise
from this thy caitiff condition?

And thou, my poor soul, the spiritual part of my composition; O what shall I
say of thee to thy great Lord and Maker? What thou have hitherto been, I well
know; wretched wicked, sinful. What thou now art, I know not; being uncertain
of Gods grace and love. What thou shall be hereafter, I am altogether ignorant;
because doubtful of thy correspondency with grace, and fearful of thy
perseverance in goodness.

Ah sad condition! I came (O my Lord) into this world in original sin, I am
bred up in actual sin, and if death and deadly sin meet together, I shall feel
the smart of them both eternally: O how much need have I then of thy grace (O
merciful Lord God!) to avoid Sin, since I cannot eschew Death! O let me rather
admit a deadly wound, than commit a deadly Sin.

4. A deep Consideration of our own Nothing.
WHat art thou then, O my whole man, consisting of body and soul? What were
thou, (O. N.) from all eternity, before thy conception in the womb, and birth
into the world? Nothing. Ah poor no thing! what is less than nothing? where
dwells this nothing? who can describe a nothing? which more differs from the
least atome in the Sun, than Gods infinite greatness from the least of his
creatures. O proud nothing! What have thou, that thou have not received?
Nothing. Why then art thou puffed up with it, as if thou had not received it?
I acknowledge my whole being, to be from thy only bounty, (O my great, good, and
glorious Maker!) and since I possess nothing, but what I have from thee, since
I shall also necessarily fade away into my first nothing, if thou withdrawest
from me thy conserving hand but a moment; I will no longer glory in that which
is none of mine, but I will here lay the foundation of my spiritual edifice,
upon this sure and solid ground of thy All and my own nothing. I will endeavor
to frame a true conceit of my own misery, frailty, insufficiency and nothing,
that so I may fully, speedily, and solidly come to this desired self-knowledg
and humility.

I will run over my lesson, repeat my questions, learn my answers, and strive
to grow skilful in this necessary and sacred science.

What have I received that I have not abused? Nothing. Body, Soul, Will,
Judgment, Memory, Understanding, Affection, Senses, Meat, Drink, Company,
Habit, books, Prayer, Sacraments, all Creatures.

Can I then be proud of Sin, Filthiness, rottenness, labor, grief, infirmity,
blindness, obstinacy, corruption, death and damnation, which are worse than
nothing?

Shall I boast of thy gifts (O my God!) which are not mine; or of my own abuses
and ingratitudes? The one is to rob thee of thy honor, the other is to be
honored for thy dishonor.

5. A serious Reflection upon Gods gifts and graces; and our strange
Ingratitude.
WHat creature ever sinned so grievously as I have done, and yet sorrowed so
little, and suffered less? Who ever forsook so great and good a God, for so
little and vain a toy as I have done? What sinful soul is there now in hell,
that would not have been a glorious Saint in Heaven, if it had had the helps,
favors, feelings, and visits, which I have both had and abused?

Who ever received so many mercies, so sweet comforts, and so great graces from
thee, O bountiful Lord God! and made so little and bad use of them as I have
done?

If I deny all this, my conscience witnesses against me: If I confess it: Oh!
why am I not more humble?

Finally, If such great troubles, temptations, and tribulations had happened to
me, as have done to others; I should by consenting have ere now burned in Hell
fire; but thou, O meek and merciful Creator! have spared me, because thou
know my weakness, and sent me small crosses, because I cannot bear greater,
etc.

Wherefore, Not unto me, O Lord! but to thee be all honor, for time and
eternity!

O that I could know thee, and know my self! O that I could truly see my own
nothing, and total dependency on thee! my misery and malice, and thy perfection
and total goodness.

Ay me! weak and wretched N! What are my forces that I should rely on them? I
have nothing, O my Lord, but what is thine; my merits are thy mercies; my goods
thy graces: yet I never have been thankful for receiving them, nor faithful in
using them.

O! when did I trust in my own strength and was not foiled, and confounded?
Grant therefore (O my Lord, O my only hope and help, O my sole safety and
security!) that I may totally trust to thee, and distrust my self; truly
acknowledge thee, and deny my self: entirely love thee, and bate my self.

6. A further Confession of our own poorness, unprofitableness, unworthiness.
I Confess, (O my Lord!) that I am the poorest, ungratefullest, unprofitablest,
and unworthiest worm of the earth; a thing altogether useless to the world, and
only active to offend thee, and to do wickedly in thy sight: and is it
possible, that I can harbor any thought of self-love, or self-liking?

O God of infinite glory, greatness, and Majesty; before whom the powers of
heaven do tremble! what are all creatures in thy sight? and what am I, the
meanest of them all? O what proportion is there (Great God!) between me and
thee, between thy All and my Nothing: and yet have I infringed thy laws,
disobeyed thy commands, contemned thy Counsels, resisted thy callings, and
contradicted thy Will to prefer my own? O monstrous impiety and ingratitude!
And shall not I willingly submit to all pain, punishment, contradiction, and
contempt, which thou (O my highly offended Creator!) shall suffer thy creatures
to inflict upon me? Behold, (O my Lord!) I debase, humble, and annihilate my
self under all things that have a being: I will henceforth utterly hate,
distrust, and detest my self, and wholly love thee, and rely upon thy mercy.

O holy self-knowledg, O sacred humility! thou art the key of all perfection,
the door of all solid virtue, piety and devotion.

7. Resolutions to practice Humility, Self-denial, and Abnegation.
I Now clearly see, by the light of thy divine goodness (O gracious Lord God!)
what has hitherto been the cause of my non-proficiency in the way of the
Spirit; and why the path of virtue seemed so unpleasant, thornie, tedious and
troublesome to my deceived soul: It was because I had not learned to leave,
loath, deny, and distrust my self; and rely wholly on thee, O my only comfort
and support!

I will therefore henceforth faithfully practice what I perceive so necessary:
I will profoundly humble my Soul; both inwardly in thy presence (O my Lord,)
and outwardly to the whole world.

I will joyfully and voluntarily embrace all injury, indignity, contempt,
correction and confusion which can befall me; with as much pleasure, as I have
formerly any worldly cherishings and kindnesses.

I will utterly destroy, ruin, and root out all Self-love, self-liking,
self-seeking, self-praise, and self-complacency.

I will cast my self under the feet of the vilest creatures, take pleasure in
the meanest employments, and obey them most willingly, whom my nature most
distasts and dislikes.

I will walk before thee, (O my Creator!] as thy needy, naked, desolate and
destitute Vassal; acknowledging my self void of all Virtue, and attributing to
my self nothing but sin, ingratitude, defects, failings, imperfections.

I will fully persuade my self that no one can contemn, confound, persecute and
punish me as I deserve.

I will not regard whether I am honored or hated, but imagine my self as a
thing dead and forgotten: or as that which never had a being, and is now truly
nothing.

I will be contented to be accounted an Hypocrite in my sincerest actions; and
to be thought full of inward impatience, secret grudgings, and desires of
revenge against them who shall any way mortify or misuse me, though my Heart
be never so free from it.

Finally, I will have these and the like thoughts and words always in my heart
and mouth: I am nothing, I have nothing, I do no good, I am an unprofitable
servant, I utterly hate and distrust my self, and totally rely upon thee, O my
Lord, my Love, and my All.

The Fourth Exercise. To obtain Remission of our Sins.
1. We excite our dull and drowsy Souls to arise speedily, and lament
seriously our former sinfulness.
WHO will give water to my Head, and fountains of tears to my Eyes? And I will
weep day and night for my Sins, which cover me all over like an incurable
ulcer, from the sole of the Foot to the crown of the Head.

Where art thou, O my wretched and wicked Soul? In what labyrinths do thou
walk? In what sinks of Sin, and puddles of uncleanness do thou wallow?

Awake, arise, lament, repent: how long will thou sleep? Why will thou die?
when will thou shake off thy fetters? Ah, return filly sheep to thy good
Pastor, return poor Prodigal to thy pious Father, whose goodness so lovingly
invites thee, whose mercy has so long expected thee.

O great and glorious God, the mighty Monarch of heaven and earth, King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords! behold a poor and penitent Publican, (who is ashamed
to lift up his eyes to Heaven, and unworthy to take your Sacred Name into his
sinful mouth) humbly knocking at your gate of mercy, clipping your holy feet,
and craving your accustomed pity and compassion.

O merciful Lord! Hide not your self from me, shut not the door against me. Oh!
one crum of comfort, one dram of devotion to my sad and sick Soul, to my dry
and desolate Spirit.

2. Our God is all to us, and in us, and the Author of all our goodness.
I Am conscious of my ingratitude against thee (O supreme Majesty!) and my sin
is always before me, and confounding me: But whether should I retire my self
from thee? To whom should I have recourse but unto thee?

Art not thou my Father, my Father of mercies, which have neither limits nor
measure? Art not thou my Maker, my Preserver, my Governor, my Deliverer, my
King, my Pastor, my Physician, my Priest and my Sacrifice?

If thou art not all this and more to me; and if I am nothing to thee; refuse
me, reject me, and relinquish me a prey to be swallowed up by thine enemies.

But it is time, (O Lord!) that Heaven and Earth take notice of what thou art
to me, and what I am to thee. It is time thou should enter into thy right;
And I must must now either give my self to thee, or thou must take me unto thy
self.

Not that I aspire to those excellent prerogatives of thy dearest servants: No
(my Lord!) it suffices me to be in the out-rank of thy meanest slaves; to be
stamped with thy mark, and linked fast in thy chains, that I may never more
have the power to fly from thee. O grant me this favor (most merciful Father!)
Which thy dear Son has purchased for me, by the price of his death and Passion.

3. We Sin of our selves, but cannot arise from it without the Divin assistance.
I Am fallen without thee, by my own frailty: but can never hope to rise, but
by thy mercy, (O my Lord and only support!) I am sick without thee, but cannot
be cured without thee (O my heavenly Physician!) I am dead without thee, but
can never be revived but by thee (O Life of my Soul!) So true it is that to
make me come to thee, thou (O most gracious Lord God!) must first come to me.

O the admirable goodness of my loving Lord! Even this little I am doing, is
rather thine own work than mine: It Is thou (O my Lord!) who put Repentance
into my soul; Desires into my heart; Sighs into my breast; Confession into my
mouth; Prayer into my lips; Remorse into my memory; Resolution of amendment
into my will. It Is thou (O gracious God!) who chiefly actest all this good in
me, by me, and for me.

O my All! do then all in me what thou desire. And particularly overwhelm (I
beseech thee) my whole interior with perfect Contrition; not coming from a
slavish and servil fear, but from a faithful and filial love: Grant me a true
and entire grief for having offended thee; not because of thy Promises, or
Threats; but because thou art in thy self, good, amiable, adorable, and worthy
all love and honor.

4. How great an Evil it is, to destroy Gods Grace in our Souls by Sin.
OR if mercenary interest do yet more move thee, as surely it seems to bear the
greatest sway with thee, my sensual and sinful Soul! For how hainously do
thou take a small injury, how deeply do thou resent a little disgrace, the
loss of a dear friend, of health, of honor, or the like temporal and
perishable commodities? O whence is it then, that thou so little apprehendest
thy loss of Grace, and thy eminent and imminent danger of eternal Damnation?

Is it a small matter to be Gods Enemy? To lose the good will of Heaven? To
destroy Gods Image? To cut up life, root and branch? To side with the accursed
Devils, (thy Creators sworn Enemies?) To hatch Treason, and enter Conspiracy
with the damned? Yea, and to kill (as much as in thee lies) him, who by his own
death gave thee life? O brutal and unnatural ingratitude!

Surely the annihilating of Heaven, Earth, Angels, Men, and all Nature, cannot
be compared with this malicious, evil, and wilful destruction of thy grace (O
Lord!) in my Soul; Since the least degree of a higher order, surpasses the
highest degree of the lower order. O eternal God! What a Monster have I been in
Grace, what a prodigy in Nature; who have so little cared to commit such
enormous Crimes?

But (O my Lord!) I will even now change my life; I here detest all Sin, I make
a firm purpose of amendment, I have a full confidence in thee my Creator, a
good will to do satisfaction, and a total resignation to thy Divine pleasure.

5. The root and source of all our Sins, is our perverted Will.
I Am the woeful Criminal, (O just Judge of my Soul!) and I will be also the
accuser and witness, the Advocate and Executioner in this Tribunal.

I summon you therefore; O detestable Pride! O abominable Envy! O execrable
Avarice! O beastly Lubricity! and all you accursed crew of Sins! how long will
you reign on earth! how long will ye dispeople Gods inheritance! who brought
you in, amongst Gods Children?

It Is the perverted Will of man (O dread Sovereign!) which has don all these
mischiefs. Rectify (O my Lord, I beseech thee) this my crooked Will, and
murder these horrible monsters in me; and grant that I may henceforth rather
expose my body to a thousand Deaths, than my Soul to deadly Sin.

Thy Saints will rejoice (O God!) at my amendment; and thy Angels will make a
Feast; but thy own resentment of joy will be infinite, because thy love is
infinite, which goes hand in hand with thy Essence, and comprehends all Love in
supreme eminency.

I will therefore expect from thee (O heavenly Father!) the exact remembrance;
from thee (my Redeemer!) the perfect knowledge; from thee, (O holy Spirit!) a
true repentance; and from thee (O Sacred Trininity!) an entire Absolution and
plenary Indulgence from all my Iniquities.

6. Our greatest Sorrow is not equivalent to the greatness of our Sins.
THe grief I feel for my past Offenses; the hatred I have against each Sin at
this present; and the resolution I make to avoid all iniquity for the future,
are not equivalent in me to their enormity and hainousness, I therefore humbly
crave (O holy Lord God!) that thou will accept thy own hatred against Sin, for
that which I should and would have; and instead of the Sorrow I want, I offer
that of thy Son, my sweet Redeemer, with the Sacrifice of his immaculate Life,
and innocent death.

And since I cannot be impeccable by Nature (O my Lord!) nor dare presume to
ask to be so by Grace; give me leave to prostrate my self before thy infinite
bounty and clemency, and to beg (by the merits of Jesus Christ, thy dear Son,
and by the desires of thy essential love, the blessed holy Ghost) that though I
may not be impeccable, yet I may never sin more; and if I must sometimes Sin
through my frailty, yet I may never Sin mortally.

This I desire (O Lord!) this thou demandest, this thou command; O give me
what thou command, and command me what thou please.

7. An Act of perfect Contrition, which is elsewhere repeated, as being of
great efficacy.
O My good Lord Jesu! who art the Lord of my Life, and should be the love of
my Soul, did I not like an ungracious and ungrateful wretch give my heart, and
sell my affection to fond, frail, filthy, and fading Creatures and comforts;
which are so far from affording me, either quiet of Mind, peace of Conscience,
purity of Soul, or perfection of Spirit; (which my obligation, and vocation
require of me), that they leave me nothing but trouble, confusion, and remorse,
with a world of dismal and desperate thoughts, violent passions, and vicious
inclinations. Amidst all which disorders, I find no other refuge, nor remedy,
than to return to thee, my true Center! to convert my self to thee, my Soverain
Creator! To cast my self at thy sacred feet, my sweet Lord Jesu! and there with
an humble and contrite spirit, to sue for Mercy, Remission, Reconciliation.

O Heavenly Father! I confess and acknowledge my ingratitude, treachery,
rebellion: And I am sorry from the bottom of my heart and Soul, that ever I
offended thee, who deservest from me all possible love, honor, and obedience;
beseeching thee, as a guilty Criminal, to take compassion upon thy poor and
penitent Creature; and to forgive me the great and grievous transgressions and
offenses which I have committed against thy divin bounty; as I do (for the love
of thee, my Lord and Maker!) most freely forgive all those that have any way
offended, distasted, contristated, or scandalized me; sincerely knowing that I
deserve no comfort from any creature, but all contempt and confusion; and not
only to be troubled, and trampled on by all on earth temporally, but even to be
tormented by the Devils in Hell eternally.

Ah, Crucified Jesu! take pity on my Soul, for which thou pouredst forth thy
Sacred Blood, and gave up thy dearest life on the Cross. Alas! How ungrateful
a Child have I been to offend so frequently, so hainously, so disloyally, so
loving and liberal a Father; so meek and merciful a Redeemer, and so sweet and
sovereign a Majesty, who has always showed himself to me so benign and
bountiful; sparing me in my Sins, and expecting me to Repentance; wooing me to
his love, and calling me to his service by a thousand means; all which I have
either rejected, or neglected; and still nevertheless continuing unto me my
life, time, and means to do Penance.

Oh, my poor Soul! How have thou been blinded and bewitched, to leave the bread
of Angels, and to feed on the husks of Swine; to abandon God, and all solid
goodness, (upon whom depends all thy hope and happiness, all thy quiet,
content, and comfort in time and eternity) for trifling vanities, empty
shadows, mere nothings?

O strange folly and phrensy! would I had never Sinned! and Oh, that I might
never Sin more!

O my God! What have I done, and not done? would I had suffered on the Cross,
(with thee my sweet Savior, and for thy love) pains of body, pangs of soul,
and even death it self, when I thus grievously Sinned! And what can I say, or
do more? I abhor and detest whatsoever I have done, said, thought, or desired
contrary to thy divine will and liking. I renounce all company and occasions,
which may induce me to offend thee. I cast my self at thy sacred feet, to be
thy faithful Bond-slave for ever. I firmly resolve to take up my Cross, and
carry it after thee, (Dear Jesu!) till death; and to do penance and
satisfaction for my past pride, pleasure, and impiety: desiring no more in this
world, but to linger out my pilgrimage at the foot of the Cross, like the
Penitent Magdalen, in perpetual solitude, silence and submission.

Good Jesu! for thy infinite mercies sake, suffer not thy poor creature to be
separated from thee eternally. O amiable Eternity! O Eternal amity of God!
Shall I leave and lose thee for filthy pleasures, frail creatures, fond
friendships, fading honors.

No, my dear Lord! Be pleased rather to take my soul out of my body, than thy
love out of my soul: Let me rather Die miserably, than Sin mortally: Let me
pass on the rest of my pilgrimage in thy grace and fear, that I may finish it
in thy friendship and favor.

Grant me this, I beseech thee, O meek and merciful Savior! by the merits of
thy bitter death and passion; by the intercession of thy most blessed Mother,
by the suffrages of all thy holy Saints in heaven, and happy Souls upon earth:
Upon all which relying, as upon the Anchors of my hope; I absolutely commit and
resign my self to thy sacred disposition and providence for time and Eternity;
fully trusting that thou will mercifully pardon all my Sins, carefully assist
me in all my Wants and Weaknesses; and in the end happily bring me to thy
Eternal Bliss and Beatitude, by such means as thy divin Wisdom knows most
expedient for me.

The Fifth Exercise. Of subduing Sensuality to Reason.
1. We deplore our proneness to Evil.
MY Spirit is willing (O most glorious and gracious Lord God!) to serve thee,
love thee, honor thee, and follow thee, but my flesh is weak, frail, and
refractory: I do not what I desire, (O my God!) nor what thou demandest; But I
act that which I hate, and what thou forbiddest.

I feel (O my Lord!) a law of sensuality, contradicting the law of my mind,
captivating my reason, clouding my judgment, and continually striving to cast
me down headlong into sin and perdition.

Unhappy man that I am! Who will free me from this body of death? Ah! my
brutish body! ah! my burdensome flesh! Thou art my dangerous and deadly enemy.
It Is thy weight that depresseth my Soul: thy earth that clogs and corrupts my
air; thy contagion and perversity, which infects and debaseth my better part
and heavenly portion; thy sensuality, which draws on, endangers, and almost
destroys my reason.

2. A detestation of our Sensuality.
AH Sensuality! the source of all my misery! how justly do I now hate thee? and
how willingly would I leave thee?

At my first acquaintance with thee, thou defiledst me with Original Sin: In my
Infancy thou made a beast of me: And now in my riper years, thou still
pursuest me, proclaimest open war with me, blindest my Understanding with
darkness, ignorance and errors, make my Will refractory to good, and ready to
all evil, distractest my Memory with vain and vile fancies, and perpetually
tossest me to and fro between love and hatred, joy and grief, hope and fear,
and the rest of thy numerous and enormous irascible and concupiscible powers
and passions.

Ay me! how sad is my state? how deplorable my condition? Oh! how long (Lord!)
must I dwell with these devils? how long must I endure the violence of these
Passions?

O my Lord, my strength, and my salvation! break these fetters for me! Command
a calm (O thou powerful Ruler of Sea and Winds!) and appease the surges of
these my unmortified appetites: Oh! restore me to my self again, reduce Reason
to her lost dominion in my Soul, and bring back me thy poor Creature, to thee
her powerful Creator. O let not this passenger perish amidst those boisterous
billows, nor suffer utter shipwreck in these fearful tempests.

I suffer violence (O my Lord!) answer for me: the companion which thou have
given me, has deceived me. Sense has corrupted and conquered my Judgment. Oh!
how am I dragged up and down by my all-mastering appetites! commanded by my
servants, and fettered by my slaves: O Tyranny! O indignity!

Ah my soul! O noble spirit, fair as the Angels, formed to thy Creators lovely
resemblance, stamped with his divine Character, and Heir apparent to his
glorious Kingdom! To be thus subject to the base and brutal desires of flesh
and blood? O intolerable bondage! O unworthy servitude!

3. An humble acknowledgment and confession of our frailty and misery.
O Father of Mercies, and only Physician of my soul! Thou art Almighty, and All
mercy; and I am all weakness, and all misery: There is no part left in my whole
body and soul free from the infectious leprosy of Sin and Sensuality.

All is out of order, (O my Lord!) I acknowledge it to my own shame and
confusion; each sense is gone astray, each member of my body is corrupted, and
each power of my Soul is perverted.

My Understanding is obscured with self-love, my Memory distracted with sensual
objects, my Will possessed with peevish inclinations: My affections are vain,
my passions violent, my dispositions vicious: My body is burdensome, my
imagination troublesome, my life irksom.

These are my Wounds. (O my heavenly Surgeon!) O put to thy helping hand, I
beseech thee; see, sear, and search them before the Gangrene enters, and the
Grief grows incurable! My soul is sick even to death; if thou will (O my Lord!)
thou can both cleanse and cure me.

To this end thou descendest from Jerusalem to Jerico, (O pious Samaritan!)
from heaven to earth, (O compassionate Savior!) where thou find me in this
pitiful plight, sore, beaten, wounded, half dead, and utterly despoiled of all
natural and spiritual riches, by Thieves and Robbers; which are the Senses of
my Body, and the Faculties of my Soul: O pass not by me (sweet Jesu!) but
mercifully bind up my bleeding Wounds, with the swathing bands of thy Death and
Passion; pour upon them the wine of thy precious Blood, and supple them with
the oil of thy heavenly Grace.

4. A firm Resolution of a total Reformation of our lives and manners.
I Intend, O my Lord! (strengthen me in this hour;) I intend (O sweet Savior!)
a total reformation of my life and manners; an entire mortification of my
corporal senses and spiritual faculties; an absolute change in my whole man.

O grant me (I beseech thee my loving Lord!) the powerful assistance of thy
special Grace, for the performance of this great and good purpose.

Teach me now, (O blessed Master!) to live inwardly, piously, spiritually; as I
loved formerly to live outwardly, vainly, sensually.

O let me henceforth yield to thy divine motion, obey thy call, imitate thy
example, and follow thy will.

O let me never more act or omit any thing, (be it never so little) for my own
liking, but purely and perfectly for thy love.

5. A desire of perfect Conformity, both in all our Actions, and in all our
Senses; to our dear Savior.
GRant (O Good Jesu!) that at each word of my mouth, at each glance of my eye,
at each morsel I eat, at each member I move, at each inward and outward action
I undertake; I may first ask thy leave and permission, and so do it, or leave
accordingly, as thy holy inspiration allows me.

O that I could perform each natural and necessary work with an actual
reflection upon thy praise and pleasure, and with a pure intention to be united
to thee, My Lord and my Love.

Thy outward Senses, (O my sweet Savior!) were exactly subject to thy Reason,
and perfectly obedient to thy sacred Soul: O let mine be swallowed up, I
beseech thee (gracious Jesu!) and sanctified by the merits of thine: Let me
live, love, move, and make use of my senses, purely and only in thee, for thee,
and by thee.

Thy sacred Hands, (O holy Jesu!) were harshly nailed to the tree of the Cross;
preserve mine, I beseech thee, from all sinful touch ng.

Thy blessed Feet were likewise pierced and fastened to the same rood, O fix my
steps that I run not to evil actions, direct them in thy paths, and make me
speedy in all works concerning thy honor, and the assistance of my neighbor.

Thy holy Mouth was free from guile, full of Wisdom: put thy Words, (sweet
Jesu!) into mine, let it always speak of thy love, und only sing thy praises.

Thy divin Ears were filled with blasphemies and derisions: Let not mine be
open to hear vanities and detractions.

Thy sweet Eyes poured out floods of tears for me: O give unto mine tears of
compassion for thy Sufferings, and of compunction for my own Sins.

Thy Taste was tormented with the noisome potion of Gall and Vinegar: O take
from me, I beseech thee, all desire of delicacies: let me not eat or drink but
for mere sustenance and necessity.

Thy whole Humanity (O gracious Jesu!) was martyred and murdered: O grant that
I may be truly and totally mortified; Let me not see, feel, hear, taste, smell,
eat, drink, do any thing, or make use of any thing, as following my own gust,
sensuality, and self-seeking; but in pure conformity to thy divin Will and
Pleasure.

6. Petitions for the Conformity of our whole inward man, to our Lord and
Savior.
O Merciful Redeemer! how great and grievous were the inward sufferings of thy
holy Soul? O for those thy sorrows, and thy tender mercies sake, cleanse, cure,
inlighten, inform, reform, and transform all my inward man.

O permit not my Understanding, (where the knowledge of your greatness and
goodness should be only seated,) to be overspread with ignorance and error.

Let not my Memory, which should be totally taken up with thee, be stuffed with
vain fancies, or impertinent curiosities.

Let not my Will, which thou gave me to desire and love thee, (O my only Lord
and Love!) above all thy creatures, be enslaved to any inferior affection.

Repair (O gracious Redeemer!) this lively image of the lovely Trinity, which
is almost defaced by my brutish Sensuality. Grant (O dear Savior!) that my
Understanding, Will and Memory, may be incessantly busied in knowing, loving
and remembering thee; and that they may forget and forgo all other Objects, but
only in thee, and for thee.

7. An absolute Disengagement of our selves from created objects; and Adhesion
to the Divinity.
O That my heart were perfectly dis-ingaged from the love of all Creatures!
Drain it, (sweet Jesu!) and deliver it from all foreign and domestic
Affection; and fill it up again with thine only, that it may never love,
desire, nor will any thing but thee alone, O my Lord, my Love, and my All!

O that my Will were conformable to thine, without any reservation or
retraction! Take it unto thee (Dear Lord!) freely and fully, for time and
eternity: I will have no will but thine; dispose of me as thou please, both
here and hereafter.

O that my Memory were disincombred from all imaginations, and purged from all
impressions, but of thee only! Empty it (O thou only amiable object of my
soul!) and then replenish it with such holy and heavenly notions, as may best
please thy divin Majesty.

O that my Understanding were imbued with some measure of the knowledge of thy
Divinity! O my Lord, infinite in goodness, dreadful in Majesty, and unspeakable
in all perfection; O my great, gracious, and glorious God, quicken it, sharpen
it, elevate it, and illuminate it; that knowing thee, I may not choose but love
thee; and that knowing and loving thee, I may be eternally happy.

Behold (Lord!) I make an absolute divorce with all self-love, sensuality, and
affection to creatures; and give thee my self by an irrevocable donation.

Behold, (Lord!) the keys, the lodging, the treasure, and the Master, prostrate
at thy sacred feet; Enter freely, possess all fully, dispose universally, and
command absolutely. Put me where thou will, give me what thou will, treat me as
thou will; thine I am, (O my Lord, my Love, and my All!) for time and Eternity.

The Sixth Exercise. Of Mortification, and perfect Abnegation.
1. If we will be Christ's true Disciples, we must renounce all, deny our
selves; take up our crosses, and follow him.
O Eternal, and ever blessed Lord God! thou have framed me of soul and body,
and fitted me with faculties proportionable to attain the end of my creation,
which is to love thee entirely, and to live with thee eternally. But alas! how
far am I from observing this thy blessed and beautiful order?

Thou (O Lord!) gave me a Soul to bear all the sway in my body; Reason to
have the chief regency in my Soul; thy Law to be the guide of my Reason; and
thy self to be the sole mover and governor of my whole man.

But oh! how have I wilfully crossed thy sacred design? contradicted thy
intention, and swarv'd from this perfection? My body is all brutish, my soul
all animal, and my reason all sensual. I am all blindness, self-love, and
immortification.

Yet I know well, and thou, (O eternal verity!) have expressly told me, that
unless I renounce all, deny my self, take up my Cross, and follow thee, I can
never become thy true Disciple.

Ah, harsh words to my carnal ears! If thou will be my Disciple, deny thy self;
If thou will be perfect. sell all, give away all, reform all, renounce all,
relinquish all: If thou will possess life eternal, contemn this life temporal:
If thou will be exalted in Heaven, humble thy self in the world: If thou will
wear a Crown with me, bear thy Cross with me. But (O my soul!) how will thou
brook that more dismal sentence, Depart from me, thou accursed, into eternal
fire?

Wherefore, (O my Lord, my Love, and my All!) Since thou have taught me these
things by thy Sacred Word, and showed them by thy holy Example: and thou art
The Way, the Truth, and the life; Grant, (O infallible Truth!) that I may
courageously walk in this perfect Way, that so I may happily come to thee, the
only true and eternal life and love of my Soul,

2. We must leave all things; to find one thing, which is all in all.
WHat dreadest thou (O my fearful and faithless Heart!) Behold, Christ thy King
and Captain is marched on before thee; take up thy Cross, and travel after him:
he leads thee to a Kingdem: Heaven is worth thy pains, O take courage to
mortify thy self, deny thy self, and die to thy self, that thou may live to
Jesus, and with Jesus eternally.

Learn (O my soul!) this short and securing lesson: Leave all things, and thou
shall find one thing which is all in all. Take courage, and fight valiantly
against thy own bad nature: pray, suffer, stoop, bear repugnances, swallow down
contradictions, digest injuries: The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence: The
end thou aimest at, is Perfection, the reward of thy Conquest, is Eternal Love,
eternal Life, eternal Happiness.

Behold, (O my Lord, my strength, and my Salvation!) I am fully resolved to lay
the ax to the root of this wicked tree. Help me, I beseech thee, with thy Grace
from above, that I may hew my self out of my self; that I may kill, crucify,
and mortify my inveigling sensuality, cut off my evil inclinations, rectify
my disordered passions, and root out each thought or desire, which tends not
directly to thy honor, will, and love, O my Lord and my God!

3. We can never love God, unless we hate our Selves.
I Know (Lord!) that it is bootless to study Perfection, without the practice
of Mortification; I confess I can never love thee truly, but in as much as I
hate my self really; such is the Antipathy between self-love, and thy holy
affection: Ah! how can a spirit distracted with contrary inclinations be freely
and fully vacant to thy divine contemplation? Put therefore, I beseech thee, a
sluice to my unmortified Passions; put a bound to my distraught heart; and
powerfully keep back those innumerous concupiscences, and corrupt imaginations
violently succeding each other; that my united affections may intend thee only,
the only object of all happiness.

Gather (O my Lord!) the dispersed forces of my Soul from all multiplicity of
worldly affections, to the union of thy only love.

Keep, I beseech thee, my Understanding, Will, Memory, Imagination, and all my
inward and outward Senses, from roaming abroad; that carefully attending and
entertaining thy divine presence in my Soul, I may attain true introversion,
simplification, and union of my Spirit with thine.

Reform, (O my Lord!) all the natural corruptions of my outward man, and
redress all the spiritual infirmities of my inward man; destroy and disperse
all internal and external enemies and opposers of thy holy love; possess me
perfectly; and dispose of me entirely according to thy Divin will and pleasure.

4. A firm Resolution of mortifying our exterior Sensuality.
TO this end, (O bless my weak endeavors, al mighty, and al-merciful Lord
God!) I will subtract all superfluities from my body, and accustom it to all
sorts of sufferings; that so I may fit it up for thee, (O holy Spirit!) who
dwell not with them that are sensual and subject to Sin.

Alas! I have not yet resisted to the effusion of my blood; and should I spill
each drop of blood in my body, in this holy quarrel; how little ought I to
regard it, in respect of the great good I expect?

I will therefore crucify thee, (O my flesh!) with all thy concupiscences. I
will mortify my outward Senses, the windows by which death steals into my
Soul, the hinderers of my hearts tranquillity, the destroyers of true devotion,
the dispersers of inward recollection, and the utter ruiners of all the good
desires which I conceive and kindle in my prayers; Ah how soon is this divin
fire cooled and quenched, not only by Sin, but also by the distracting images
of outward Objects?

I will keep a special and strict watch over my Tongue, on which depends my
spiritual life or death; and cherish thee, (O beloved Silence!) which art the
key of piety, the keeper of innocence, and the preserver of purity.

I will trample down my inferior Nature with all its evil affections and
motions of love, hatred, joy, sadness, desire, fear, hope, anger, etc. I will
order, dispose, and direct it, according to the Laws of reason, and thy divine
inspirations (O my Lord and my God!) Grant me courage, I beseech thee, to quell
and curb this most dangerous and my greatest enemy, which is the source of all
my miseries, the Citadel from whence Sin assails me, and Satan fetches his
forces to fight against me: Grant (Good Lord!) that I may never yield to this
wicked Eve, persuading Adam, (my Superior Will) to eat the forbidden fruit; (to
consent to unlawful pleasures.)

This is the chief exercise of Gods children, not to be carried away with
affections of flesh and blood, but to conduct themselves according to Gods
Spirit; Therefore every one must strive to know his own natural inclinations,
and then employ all his forces, and apply all his prayers and spiritual
exercises to quell them.

O that I could tame these cruel beasts, my natural passions! how soon should I
be Master of all moral Virtues?

O that I could so till this Vineyard, so delve this Garden, so purge it from
all ill weeds of affection, and prune all superfluous surgeons and shoots of
passions, that the seed of thy Grace, (O heavenly Husbandman!) might only there
take root, increase and fructify?

5. The same Resolution of mortifying our interior man.
I Will also mortify my Superior, and Rational part, with all the curious and
fruitless speculations of my Understanding, all conceits of self-wisdome,
natural prudence, proper judgment, and good liking of my own proceedings: All
vain and foolish reflections of my Memory; and all petty desires and affections
of my Will, which relate not to thee, the only object, and Lord of my love.

I am resolved, (O my Lord!) to nip off each budding Passion, as soon as it
peeps up in my Soul to trouble it in its true repose, and to hinder its liberty
and tendency to thy love.

I will (by thy gracious assistance,) proceed faithfully and sincerely in the
hatred, denial, and mortification of my self, and in the prosecution of thy
divin love. And in order to this only end and aim, I make in thy presence, and
from the very bottom of my Heart and Soul, these particular acts following.

I renounce, (O my Lord!) for the pure love of thee, all affection to worldly
things. Give them unto me, (O gracious God!) or take them from me, as best
likes thy divine Majesty. I resign up all my interest in any thing, though
never so near and dear unto me. Behold, (O my Lord and Lover!) I uncloath my
Soul from all affections whatsoever to creatures, and desire nothing but thy
self alone. O happy nakedness, O rich poverty of Spirit, O pure obedience to
the divin Will in all things! Be you my hearts delight, my whole pleasure and
patrimony.

6. An absolute Renunciation of all Selfishness.
I Renounce all self-seeking. Ah! my corrupt nature, I abhor thee! Adien all
private interest, profit, praise, and preferment! I will henceforth perform all
my actions and exercises (O my Lord God!) for thy only pure and perfect love: I
will seek to please and praise thee with an inward, ardent, and amorous
affection, for thy self only, and not for thy gifts or graces.

I renounce all Sensuality; whether it be in Meat, Drink, Sleep, Apparel,
curiosity of my five Senses, or any thing else whatsoever, (O my Lord!) I will
make no other use of any thy Creatures, than I am absolutely compelled to by
necessity of Nature. I look for no solace but from thee alone, (my only comfort
and content!)

I renounce all disordered love to any worldly person. No favor or friendship,
(O my only amiable Lord God!) no greatness or goodness of any one, shall make
me swerve from my exact duty to thee-wards. No carnal affection to kindred, No
tenderness of amity, No private or public respect, No connivency, or
correspondency, shall make me partial in the reproof of Vice, or praise of
Virtue. O take up my whole Heart with thy holy Love; that thy image and
perpetual memory, may blot out all species of foreign objects.

I renounce all vain, vicious, idle and unprofitable thoughts, fancies and
imaginations. O let my mind not only yield no consent, but no entrance unto
them! O let me never more contristate thy holy Spirit with these Vanities; nor
hinder my souls advancement and union with thee by these divertisements. I will
henceforth compel my heart to some good employment: I will no longer permit it
to wander and waste it self in any idle and superfluous Curiosities. No, (my
Lord and Savior!) thy bitter and blessed Passion, thy blessings and benefits,
shall be the continual occupation of my interior. O what have I to do with
transitory things, who am made for Eternity!

I renounce all care and solicitude, which necessity, obedience and charity, do
not oblige me to. No natural passions of joy, sorrow, hope, fear, love, hatred,
anger, or shamefastness, shall make any impression in this heart of mine, which
is pre-ingag'd in thy affection, sealed up and settled in thy contemplation. No
pretext of lawfulness, nor show of fittingness, nor conceit of compassion, nor
excuse of necessity, shall procure the admittance of such Passions into my
Soul, as may any way distract, darken, or dull the point of my affection and
devotion toward thee, (my only Lord and Love!)

I renounce all bitterness of heart against any one. Is he good? be thou
eternally praised in him and by him, (O bountiful bestower of all blessings!)
Is he wicked? Correct him, (O merciful Creator!) comfort, encourage and raise
him to amendment. Has he offended, affronted, injured, or slighted me? I
deserve, (O great God!) to be trodden on by all creatures, and therefore I
freely forgive him for the past, and give him free leave to add stripes to his
injuries for the future. Am I denied the grant of my most lawful and just
demands? Thou best know, (O eternal Wisdom!) what is best for my state and
condition: O deny not thy love to my Soul, and let me be refused in all other
my requests whatsoever.

I renounce all vainglory, all self-liking and pride, which may arise from
worldly praises, all delight springing from any gift of nature or grace which
is in me. Not unto me, (Lord!) but to thy holy Name be given all honor and
glory. Alas! what am I? what have I? what can I? All is thine, (O bountiful
Lord God!) Nothing is mine but sin; and therefore I deserve only shame and
confusion.

7. More Acts of Renunciation of our own Wills, even in the most spiritual
matters.
I Renounce all desire of delight in my devotions, all sensible gusts of grace,
and all sweetnesses and solaces in the inferior faculties of my Soul. Ah, my
heart! what is this to thee? follow thou thy Savior: Thou seek thy
crucified Jesus: This is not he, but his gifts. O my Lord! it is thy self I
seek and sigh after: If thou sendest me comforts for the encouragemnnt of my
weakness, be thou ever praised: for thou do like a most benign and bountiful
God: If thou withdrawest them, still blessed be thy providence, whch has
secret and several ways of conducting souls to thy self: and if thou will make
trial of my fidelity, by permitting me to be dull, dry, and desolate in my
devotions, be thou equally and eternally blessed.

I renounce all scrupulosity of Conscience, which reflects any way upon the
least diffidence or distrust in thy mercy. I am a Sinner, (O Jesu!) but thou
art a Savior. I have great reason to dread thy Justice; but greater to hope in
thy Goodness. Heaven and Earth shall sooner fail, than my confidence in thee,
(my merciful Maker!) If thou killest me, I will trust in thee. And if I had
formerly hated thee, and betrayed thee, as Judas did, I would now with penitent
Magdalen run to thy blessed feet, weep and bemoan my misery, and hope to obtain
thy mercy.

And finally, (O my Lord!) I absolutely, entirely, and irrevocably renounce my
whole Will in all things, and totally resign whatsoever any way concerns me, to
thy holy will and pleasure. I offer up unto thee the full sacrifice, both
principal and accessory, of all that (by thy gift and grace) I am, have, and
can; my self, goods, graces, body, soul, senses, heart, will, all. I leave no
right or title to any selfness in any thing whatsoever: I am no more my self,
but thy slave. O Lord, Not my will, but thine be don, for time and eternity. O
let me will what thou will, or not will at all. Let all my desires be
involuntary, if they swerve never so little from thy divin pleasure. Die
Self-will: Live Jesus, my Lord, my Love, my All.

The Seventh Exercise. Of Conformity to Christ Crucified.
1. Ardent Wishes and Desires of perfect Conformity to Christ our Savior.
CRucified JESV! Thou only Lord of my life, life of my love, and love of my
soul! O that I could reform my life, deiform my love, and conform my soul to
thee, the absolute pattern of all perfection.

O that I could imprint thy lively and lovely image in my Heart! fasten all my
affections and imperfections to thy sacred Cross, drown all my desires and
defects in thy dear Wounds, put off my self totally, and put thee on entirely,
O sacred humanity, O my suffering Savior!

O that I could perfectly imitate thee, the pure exemplar of all Virtues! that
I could give up my whole self to thee by an Act of irrevocable donation, as
thou demandest and command!

But alas! I am yet (O my Jesu!) all selflove, sin and sensuality. I
acknowledge, (O my Lord!) what I have, and what I want; I know what I desire,
and what I deserve. I confess I am wounded, I am wicked, I am wretched, and I
tremblingly come to thee, my heavenly Physician, to be cured, converted,
comforted.

O sweet Savior! for thy mercies sake, and for thy passions sake, Forget and
forgive what I have been, pity what I am, satisfy for what I deserve, and
supply what I desire.

2. We cast our selves at our Saviors Feet, where we beg Humility.
BEhold (most merciful Jesu!) I first cast my self at thy sacred Feet, pierced
and fastened to the cruel Cross for my trangressions: Pierce my flesh, (O my
Lord) with thy fear, and fasten my soul to thy love. O let not pride and
presumption nestle any longer in that Heart, which thou (O meek Savior!)
love so tenderly, and have redeemed at so dear a rate. O my vainglory and
arrogance, what have I to do with you, how much do I now detest you? Wash off
these stains, (O Jesu!) from my poor soul, in these sweet streams flowing from
thy wounded Feet. O drown these my imperfections in these sacred Seas of piety.

Give me (O gracious Lord!) such true humilty of Spirit, that I may perfectly
perceive the abyss of my own nothing and naughtiness, and rightly conceive the
immensity of thy greatness and goodness, wherereby I may depress my self
unfeignedly, and exalt thee only in my soul. Let me be content to be contemned
by all Creatures, desire to be despised, be willing to be trodden on as dirt and
dust, and the very outcast of the whole world: O let me really hate all honor,
and humbly pronounce with mouth and mind; I am nothing, have nothing, deserve
nothing, desire nothing, but only to please thee perfectly, (my Jesu!) praise
thee perpetually, love thee purely, and live with thee eternally.

3. Before the same Wounds of our Saviors Feet, we beg the virtues of
Obedience, Patience, Silence.
GRant me also, Good Jesu! by the merits of these your Wounds, the Virtue of
perfect Obedience. O let me never tire in trampling down self-will, in
forsaking my own sense, in subduing Self-judgment, in submiting my spirit
inwardly to thy inspirations, and outwardly, not only to my Superiors
injunctions, but even to the commands of all thy Creatures. O let me have no
propriety, affection, or affectation in my own proceedings, but wholly mind thy
holy pleasure in all things.

Let me lay down all my desires at thy sacred Feet, (O my Jesu!) saying, Lord,
what will thou have me to do? so transforming my Will into thine, by an
absolute forsaking, denying, and annihilating my whole self.

Let me receive, (O my Savior!) as from thy secret providence and permission,
not only patiently, but thankfully, all pain, all poverty, all shame, all
sickness, and all sufferings whatsoever; acknowledging that I truly deserve
worse, and desiring willingly to endure more, that so I may have a more perfect
resemblance with thee (my crucified Lord!)

Let me learn, (O my Lord!) by thy blessed example, the holy lesson of discreet
Silence, not only from ill and idle talk, but even from all needless, and
unprofitable discourses: Let me rather edify by the purity of my life and
conversation, than by multiplicity of words and conceptions.

O give me, (sweet Jesu!) a free and frequent access to thy sacred Feet, during
the whole course of my life; and a sure comfort in them at the hour of my death.

4. Petitions for several Virtues, before the Right hand of our Crucified
Redeemer.
FRom thy blessed Feet (O my dear Lord!) I raise my humble devotion to thy
all-holy Hands: and beg leave to cast into the sweet Fountain issuing from thy
powerful right Palm, my manifold Sins of Malice and Injustice; with all my
faults of Hypocrisy and Ingratitude, Falsehood and Infidelity, Rancor and
Revenge.

Renew, (O Lord God!) a right spirit within my bowels: Let exact Justice be the
square of all my actions; Truth the touchstone of my words; and Sincerity the
subject of my thoughts.

Let me be punctual in performing my duty to thee, zealous in punishing my
self, and charitable in compassionating my neighbor. Let me ever yield, first
unto thy Sacred Majesty, all honor and glory, reverence and respect; laud and
love, gratitude and obedience, with my whole heart, soul, and strength; next to
my Superiors, equals, and inferiors; and lastly, to my own body, soul, and
senses, that which is my duty, and each one of their respective dues. O let me
fully perform what I am bound to, carefully eschew what is forbidden me, and
uprightly walk according to my calling.

O let me never presume to slight, scorn, suspect, judge, or condemn any person;
but sincerely serve, succor, and seek the temporal and spiritual good of all
men whatsoever, even of my professed and most peevish Enemies.

Lord Jesu! give me grace to imitate thy Virtues, to be grateful for thy Gifts,
and to make use of thy Goodness, in order to my souls advancement in the way of
thy dear love and desired union with thy divin Majesty.

5. Other Petitions, before the Left Hand.
ANd in the Sacred wound of thy Left Hand, I humbly intomb all my offenses of
Negligence, Tepidity, Sluggishness, Cowardice, and Pusillanimity; all my my
Covetous desires, all Impurity, and all Intemperance. Purge me, (O my powerful
Lord!) purify me, (O my merciful Savior!) Give strength, comfort and courage
to my feeble and frail nature, that I may pass undauntedly through all
difficulties and dangers, to come to thee, and to repose in thee, the only
center of my desires.

Grant me (O my Lord!) Chastity of body, and Cleanness of heart; Temperance in
my appetites, and Sobriety in my senses: Gravity in my deportment, and
Moderation in all my proceedings; that nothing may dislike thee in my soul, nor
dissolve the sacred knot wherewith thou have fastened me unto thee.

Give me also (O Jesu my Lord!) perfect Poverty of spirit. O permit not my
soul, designed to enjoy thee, (her only solid and satiating object) to be
entangled with the least affection to the poor and perishable trifles of this
world. Behold, I cast my self, uncloathed from all creatures, into thy naked
embraces, (O crucified Savior!) I desire to clip nothing in my folded arms,
but a breast burning with desires to please thee (my Redeemer!) and a heart
melting away in thy love. I make choice of thy ba^e Cross, (O Christ!) for my
best inheritance; I stretch out my opened folds, to meet thy holy and heavenly
huggings. O let me never more be unclasp'd from thy blessed bosom: Be thou (O
my great-little naked-Jesu!) my rest, during the short time of my life; and my
refuge at the dreadful hour of my death.

6. More humble Petitions before the Sacred Head and Face, of our Crucified
Savior.
ANd now, (O merciful Savior!) I humbly convert my eyes and contemplation, to
thy sacred Head crowned with thorns, and thy divin Face, all besmeared with
gore and spittle, for my sake: Here, I implore strength, (O Jesu!) for the
weaknesses of my head, and pardon for the wickednesses of my five Wits and
Senses. (O my Lord!) I desire to bury in these thy innumerous Wounds, the
enormous number of my iniquities: and I beseech thee, for these thy sufferings
sake, to adorn my weak capacity with so much solid Wisdom as may fitly suit
with my condition. O let me never think, speak, or act any thing, which is not
seasoned with the salt of Discretion! Let me seriously weigh each circumstance,
and patiently wait thy leave and leisure, before I leap into any work.

Enlighten me, to see clearly thy will and pleasure, and empower me exactly to
fulfill and follow it: Open the eyes of my Understanding to behold my own
baseness and wickedness, and give me thy gracious assistance to reform it: Help
me to frame a right judgment of the real vileness and vanity of all transitory
things, and indue my heart with courage to contemn them.

Inebriate my affection, (O amiable Jesu!) with the sweetness of thy love, and
let all worldly solaces savor of bitterness to my soul. Let me be deaf, blind,
and dumb, to all things which are not thy self, O my crucified Savior!

Let me prudently discern, and piously perform, each parcel of my duty, in its
due circumstance of time, place, order, measure and manner. Let that holy and
innocent Simplicity, (which is the Virtue of thy Saints,) shine in all my
actions. Let me not be curious to know much, but careful to practice much, and
cordial to love thee much, (O my only Lord and love!)

Cleanse my Will from all self-seeking; Keep my Memory from all superfluities;
Close up my Senses from all vanities; that my happy soul, separated from all
sensible images, may quietly tend to thee only, sweetly repose in thee and
continually enjoy thy blessed presence.

O let thy pure and perfect love, (Dear Lord Jesu!) be the faithful Scout-watch
over all my proceedings; that no foreign affection, no sinister intention, no
self liking, or self seeking may steal into my heart, and defraud, or disturb
its happy enjoyment of thee, and holy unity with thy divin Spirit.

Grant, (O my Lord!) that I may prudently turn all good events, and all bad
accidents, to my spiritual profit; by reflecting wherefore they befall me, of
what they warn me, and how far they concern me. Let me learn thereby, gratitude
to thy Goodness, fervor in Prayer, contempt of my self, humility of spirit,
care of my actions, resignation to thy will, amendment of my life, or what else
thy holy Spirit shall please to intimate by these fatherly visitations.

O sacred Head of my crucified Savior! be thou my certain succor during my
lives conflict; and my sure place of retreat, in my last agony of Death.

7. And finally, Ardent Petitions before the Heart of JESUS, wounded with a
Lance.
ANd Lastly, I reverently approach to thy dear Heart, (O amiable Lord Jesu!)
opened with a cruel Lance, in the sight of thy blessed Mother, and thy beloved
Disciple, for the love of my Soul, (O my Jesu!) I here implore thy pardon for
all my perverss affections, and irregular appetites.

Give me thy leave, (O my loving Lord!) to creep into this sweet hole of the
rock, this sacred cleft of the wall, this unlocked closet of heavenly
treasures, this saving Ark of the New Testament; and shut you (O Jesu!) the
door from without; that free from the deluges of all wickedness, and dangers of
the World, Flesh, and Devil, I may sit solitarily, silently, and sweetly,
harkening to thy divin whispers in my elevated Soul.

Purge all my impurities; (O my dear Savior!) in the precious Blood streaming
from thy patent side, and replenish my heart with thy perfect love! Oh! drown
me, wound me, burn me, and consume me in thy divine flames of affection; that I
may love thee strongly, purely, perfectly, perseverantly.

O grant, that I may leave all things with alacrity for thee, (my beloved
Jesu!) though never so great; to loath all things joyfully for thy love, though
never so good; to do all things contentedly for thy honor, though never so
hard; to suffer all things patiently for thy sake, though never so painful; and
to persever constantly in my pious practices, for the sole satisfaction of thy
holy Will, and the accomplishment of thy blessed pleasure.

O let me be incessantly calling and knocking at this sacred gate of Mercy: Let
me be still sighing and seeking after thee, (my Jesus, my Savior, my Lord, and
my Love!) Let me be always thinking, ever talking, and perpetually tending to
unite my heart to thine, to conform it unto thine, to transform it into thine,
that so I may be all thine, and thou all mine for time and eternity. Grant
also, (dear Jesu!) that I may truly love all others in thee and for thee. O
inflame my Charity, quicken my Faith, rectify my intentions, strengthen my
confidence in thee, destroy all complacency in my self, establish me in all
these my good purposes, and let me be as often minded of my now-promis'd duty,
and encouraged to proceed forwards in the path of perfection, as I shall eye
the sacred image of thy crucified humanity.

Elevate my desirous Soul unto thy self, (O Jesu my Lord!) above all chances,
changes and creatures. Oh! let it be so totally attentive to thy presence, so
entirely taken up in thy contemplation, and so wholly absorpt in thy love; that
no outward objects may touch or trouble it, no inferior cares or cogitations
may entangle it, nothing may impede the free intercourse of thy heavenly
friendship, nothing may stop the sweet influence of thy divin graces, or any
way interrupt its happy, quiet and holy tranquillity.

O dear, and opened Heart of my dying Lord Jesus! be thou my sweet comfort
during this lives Pilgrimage; and my sure Sanctuary in its last period.

T^ ^ghth Exercise. Of (...) with GOD.
1. Our Soul seeks nothing but Gods lovely presence, and desires nothing but
the presence of his Love.
O Infinite, immense, and unmeasurable abyss of all bounty! O ever-flowing
Fountain of mercy! O undrainable Sea of love! O my Lord, my Sovereign, my
Savior, and my Sanctifier! Behold I return into thee the sweet source of my
beginning; I run into thee, the gracious Preserver of my being; and I desire to
rest in thee, the only hope of my Souls happiness.

Be thou henceforth, (O my Creator!) the sole subject of my thoughts, and the
only object of my love: Be thou, O God of my heart, Heart of my life, Life of
my soul, and Soul of my Love! my part and my inheritance for ever: I choose
thee only, I offer up my self wholly, I consecrate my self heartily, and
dedicate my self eternally, to thy love, honor, and service.

Ah, good God! where dwell thou? which is the pleasant place of thy abode,
(O King of glory, and Comforter of my Soul?) I seek nothing but thy lovely
presence, I desire nothing but the presence of thy love. My soul sighs to see
thee, my heart covets to have thee, my love longs to enjoy thee, and I can
expect no perfect content, until I am totally united unto thee.

If I now beg a glimps of thy divin face, (O my glorious Lord!) then a drop of
thy heavenly grace, and afterward a dram of thy dear affection; Yet in all
this, it is thy self, (O sweet God!) which I demand: thy whole self is the only
satiating object of my boundless desires and unlimited affections.

2. Fervent Acts of Love and Affection.
I Desire to love thee, (O only amiable Lord God!) by all means, and beyond all
measure, until I am totally transformed into thee by love; O do thou freely and
fully possess my spirit, guide it, govern it, enlighten it, inflame it, elevate
it, inform it, and transport it, how and when thou please.

Oh! Let all adulterate love be quite banished, all multiplicity vanish away,
and all impurity and self-seeking swallowed up: Let thy love be my light, my
liberty, my life!

Lord, I desire but two things in this world: To love, see, taste, and enjoy
thee, My best beloved; and to be humbled, despised, rejected, and esteemed a
reprobate for thy love.

O sweet life! O loving Jesu! what a heaven, what a happiness is it to love
thee? O how lovely, how loving, and yet how little loved is my God?

O source of all goodness, and center of all good souls! What is the greatest
love of mother, friend, life, or any thing else? Art not thou (my God!) all this
to me, and all in all? Ah, my Soul! what did thou ever best love? And did
thou love thy Lord God as much? I blush, (O my dear Lord!) I sigh, and am
ashamed to answer: I will henceforth do any thing, suffer any thing, and leave
all things for thy love. I will not live but languish, not breath but burn, by
an ecstasy and excess of love.

3. Further Acts and Ecstasies of divin Love and Affection.
O Fire! O flames! Burn, Consume, Annihilate. Alas! Beauty of Angels! how late
and how little do I love thee! O come into my Soul; behold a poor lodging, yet
such as it is, it is all thine: I conceal nothing, I reserve nothing; heart,
soul, spirit, all is thine own, compose all, dispose all, depose all unruly
passions, impose what Penance thou please: I accept it, (O my Lord!) only
repose peaceably in my soul, and let no foul or false affection interpose it
self, to disturb this blessed union.

O that I could please and praise thee purely, perfectly, perpetually! Oh, that
I could love thee faithfully, freely, and fully, in all and above all things,
(O my all and only love!)

I acknowledge my self bound, (O Lord!) in thy chains of Charity, I am burned in
thy fire; I am wounded, and won to thy love; But what shall I say, What can I
give? All I have is not worthy of thee, and yet is thine already: Ask (my sweet
Lord!) and have; choose and take; make me such as thou desire, and then take
me to thy desire.

Give thy self, (O great God!) to my soul, and then take my soul with thy self
in it: My life, liberty, love, all, is thy own. My last Will is already made,
in which I bequeath all to thee, thy own Death and Passion, all thy Mercies and
Merits, all the praises and perfections of thy dear Mother, and the blessed
Saints and Angels, and all the goods, glories and splendors of all thy
creatures.

All that I am, have, and can, both spirituals and temporals; kindred, friends,
riches, health, honors, estates, offices, devotion, all is at thy disposal. I
am resolute, (O my Lord!) I am resigned and indifferent, to have them increased
or diminished; to use them to thy glory, or to lose them altogether.

4. We return back to our Creator, all that we have, are, and can.
I Give thee back (O merciful Maker!) my whole being, either to be what thou will, or to be nothing at all, to love thee, or not to live at all.

I offer to thee, (O pious Redeemer!) my sins to pardon, my works to perfect,
my will to purify. I offer thee my wounds to cure, my soul to cleanse, and my
spirit to comfort.

I offer to thee (O holy Spirit!) my intentions to rectify, my inclinations to
sanctify, my affections to deifie.

Finally, I offer all for one, I give all to one, and all I desire is to be all
one with thee, (my all and only Lord and love!)

Thou have given me, (O my bountiful Creator!) the whole world in freehold, for
one penny of Rent, saying; Child, give me thy heart: O Lord! Let this penny
never want the superscription of thy grace, and let me never want thy grace to
pay this rent.

O my Lord! all that I have is but two small mites, I cast them into thy hands,
and had I more, I would give more; Dispose of them both, (dear Lord!) of my
Body and Soul, as best pleases thee, that thy will may be perfectly performed,
and thy name purely sanctified in both.

O sweet God of my heart! Let me embrace thee in the two arms of profound
Humility, and perfect Charity.

O let my Heart faint and melt away in the fire of thy Divin love, let me lose
my self to find thee, be out of my self to live in thee, and be empty of my
self to be full of thee.

O Son of Justice! dissolve with a beam of thy brightness, the frost of my
heart; and resolve it into tears of affection.

5. We declare our Weariness of all things; and our desire of divin Union.
O Beautiful and best-beloved of my Soul! I am weary of this wretched world:
and I breath, thirst, and sigh after thee, the sweet fountain of life-giving
and soul-saving waters: O true rest and refresher of my faint and feeble heart,
out of whom there is neither comfort nor content; Let me shroud my self under
the shadow of thy wings, until iniquity and infirmity have an end.

Come, (Lord Jesu!) Speak thy sweet words of love to my languishing soul, for
thy servant hears thee. Give me courage, alacrity, fervor and fidelity in thy
service, during the few remaining moments of my wretched and wearisom
pilgrimage.

O rest, long expected, and much sighed after! where shall I seek thee; and
when shall I find thee? where sleep thou, (O dear Spouse!) at Midday, in
the heat of love? Where is thy secret cabinet of Contemplation, which thou
hidest from the wisdom of Worldlings, and revealest to little ones and humble
of heart? O show me the bed of divin Union, wherein thou reposest with the
simple, solitary, and mortified soul! O let my poor heart have the honor and
happiness to rest in thee, to remain with thee, and to be united to thee.

O God of love! wound my soul with thy sweet wounds of love, which nothing can
cure but death, wean it from the worlds vanity, and wed it to thy increated
verity; that treading all creatures under me, I may be rapt into thee (my
Creator!) above my self, and there like the happy dove in the secure Ark,
repose my weary and faint limbs in thy bosom, my Sovereign Lord and lover!

6. We humbly beg that One thing, which is only necessary.
O Divin Wisdom! Lead me into the solitude, speak unto my heart, teach me thy
holy will in all occurrences. My deep sighs, and secret desires are not hid
from thee; And thou know nothing can fully cure, comfort and content me, but
thy self, the one and only necessary thing: O then take my self and all: and
give me that one thing in whom are all things.

O sweet waters of divin Love! which flow from the blessed bosom of the
Divinity, and from the open side of my Saviors Humanity! Run into my bowels,
and like pure oil, penetrate and possess every parcel of my spirit; Irrigate
and inebriate it, overflow and absorp it, that it may be transformed and
conformed to the divin Spirit, so that all my actions, cogitations, and
affections may be spiritual, divin, Deiform.

O let my ravished Soul, full of life and fire, break forth into these flames
of joy and jubilation, I have found him, whom my soul loves, I have him, and I
will hold him. This is it, which by reading I sought, by meditation I found, by
prayer I desired, and by contemplation I enjoy.

O how the earth stinks? how loathsome are all creatures to me? O taste, O
sweetness, O true and solid pleasure! O how great is the difference between
this spiritual, and all fleshly delights? O the multitude of thy sweetnesses,
which thou have laid up, O Lord, for them that fear and love thee! O Lights! O
Delights! O Ecstasies of spirit!

Wound me, (O sweet God!) burn me, consume me, crucify me; Let me cry out with
that Lover; Retain, O Lord, the floods of thy grace, or enlarge my heart, for I
can old no longer. I thirst, (Lord!) give me this water. O when? how long? how
much?

7. Our enamoured Souls rest sweetly in this secure home and harbor.
O My Soul! how good is it for us to be here? O sweet and secure home and
harbor! Let us remain and rejoice here for ever. I will keep thee, O my dearly
beloved! and I will kiss thee; I will conjure thee to remain with me: I will
rather lose my self, than leave thy presence.

My beloved is mine; his honor is mine, his heart is mine, his heaven is mine:
And I am his: behold the key, the keeper, the soul the body, the lord, the
whole, (O my God!) is thine; Behold, my liberty, my life, my love, all is thine,
(O my Jesu!) and thine alone; Repose therefore, as a sweet posie, between my
breasts; sleep, like a bridegroom, in my heart; and reign, like a King, in the
closet of my Soul.

Come, Lord Jesu! come quickly; take full possession of thy own: Come, and
please thy self, love thy self, and serve thy self in me, as thou desire and
deservest to be pleased, loved, served.

Let thy love (O King of love!) be the life of my Soul, and the lease of my
life, that when I cease to love, I may cease to live.

In thy love, (O Jesu!) I end this act of love, though my desire actually to
love thee is endless: Oh! let me live and die in thy love, and for thy love;
that by love I may for ever reign and remain with thee, in thy Kingdom of love.
Amen.

. 8. Devotions, Exercises, and Elevations, for Communion.
1, What is to be done before Communion.
THe due Preparation to this divin Banquet requires Two things.

1. Purity from all Mortal sin, and from all affection to it: This purity is
obtained by an humble Confession, a hearty Contrition, fervent Prayer, a
careful custody of heart, and a right intention in Communicating.

2. An actual Recollection and Devotion: which is gotten by pious and affective
Considerations; by Faith and Confidence in Gods Mercy; by a thirsty desire to
See, Enjoy, and be united to God, who is our sweet and Sovereign Good, our
Father, Friend, and Food, our Guest, our Master, and our Meat.

Several Considerations before Communion: To move our Souls to Affections, and
to excite them to an ardent Thirst and Desire of JESUS 's presence.
1. WHat is the blessed Sacrament? But a pure Fountain flowing out of Paradise,
watering the whole Church, refreshing all the Pilgrims of this world, and
quenching all their passions and temptations. I desire, (O my Lord!) to drink
of this water. Dispose my heart (Dear Jesu!) thou who art Author of the desire,
Let me not bring a heart of paper to this Fountain; which after a little
received dew of childish devotion, will presently fleet away for want of care
and custody: Nor let me bring a heart like a Sieve, which will retain no
moisture: But let my heart be like a Sponge, to receive and retain the dews of
thy divin Graces and Blessings, and to be totally imbrued, inebriated, satiated
with thy heavenly sweetnesses.

2. What is in this Sacrament? My God, and all that is good: My Savior, and
with him, his Body, Blood, Soul, Humanity, Divinity. My Jesus, and with him,
all his mercies and merits. Who would not desire an Union with so great a God,
so good a Savior, so gracious a Jesus!

3. How did the poor Magdalen lament the loss of her Master at the Monument?
Ah, my sweet Lord! where art thou? what can I do but sigh and sob in thy
absence? Who will pity my Case? who will plead my Cause? who will pardon my
Crimes? who will save my Soul? Thou only art all my comfort; come therefore to
me, or take me to thee.

4. The holy Baptist esteemed himself unworthy to loose the latchet of thy
Sandals: St. Peter, to be in the same Bark with thee: The Centurion, to admit
thee under his Roof: And what art thou (my poor Soul!) compared to these great
Saints? Lord, I am not worthy of this honor and happiness which I much desire:
Depart therefore from me a sinner, or rather come to me, and cause that I may
sin no more.

5. Who is the Guest I mean to lodge? One who infinitely surpasses all created
perfections: One, whose power framed all, whose providence governs all, whose
beck can in a moment bring all back to their Original Nothing. And is it
possible he will descend to dwell in houses of Earth? If the Heavens cannot
contain thee (Dread Sovereign!) how shall my soul? Whence (O Lord!) is this thy
goodness to me? Who am I to deserve it? No, it is thy Love that brings thee to
me; and it is my Confidence that leads me to thee. O that I were as clean as thy
Empyreal Heaven to entertain thee? as Pure as the Virgin MARY, to receive thee!

6. What need I other Motives of Humility, than to see thee, (O Jesu!) so
humble in this Sacrament? Thou annihilatest thy glory to become my food, who am
the food of worms. I am (say thou) the bread of life, take me, eat me, digest
me, nourish thy self with me; have as much power over me, as much possession of
me, as of a morsel of bread which thou swallowest. Come then, (O my Lord and
Lover!) take full and free possession of me, establish thy government, adorn
thy lodging, command, control, correct all; be thou all in all in my Soul, etc.

7. With desire, (say thou, my sweet Savior!) I have desired to eat this
Pasche with you before I suffer. Why (O Lord!) do thou so much desire it, and
I so little? What good will come to thee by it; and what good will not come to
me by it? Do thou so heartily desire my good, and shall I not desire my own
good and thy glory?

8. At what time was this pledge of the divin love, and comfort of our life
instituted? Just in the night of our dear Saviors Passion, immediately before
he was hurried away to Death. O Love without limits, O mercy without measure!)
When men seek out the means to bereave thee of life; Thou inventest this
Banquet to give them life. How well, (O Loving Jesu!) do thou teach me to
repay good for evil, and to give my life and blood for my Enemies? but much
more for thee, who have showed me such large tokens of thy tender affection.

9. In what place? In a Chamber, on high, well swept, well prepared, freely
profer'd, wherein our Redeemer wrought strange things, both before and after
his Resurrection. What Lodging, O Lord! shall I offer thy sacred Majesty?
Child, give me thy heart. Lord! take it! behold I neither lend it, nor sell it,
but I freely and fully give it unto thee for Nothing; And yet I give thee
nothing but thine own. O Lord! It is not clean; purify it with thy Blood: It
is not adorned; Beautify it with thy Grace, Love and Favor: It is not High,
but base, mean, terrene; Elevate it with thy ennobling Presence, touch it, draw
near it, and draw it near thy self: And then work in it thy holy will and
pleasure.

10. Who were the Receivers? The twelve Apostles: whereof one was a Traitor? Is
it I Lord? Alas! If there be any one, I am most likely: yet my comfort is, that
I come not with any such treacherous intention, but to lodge and love thee, to
obtain pardon for my Sins, and to implore thy Grace, that I may sin no more.

11. O my Soul! how mercifully has thy Lord and Maker provided for thee,
nourished thee, cherished thee? All living creatures stand in need of such
sustenance as is conformable to their nature, without which they cannot live
and subsist. Some of them are Corporal, Others are Spiritual: Man partakes of
both, as consisting of Body and Soul, (which are two different things wedded
together by the divin Wisdom, and in a most wondrous manner, not to be
understood by our weak capacity.) Mark now, O man! (admire and weep in the
ecstasy of thy joy and love) how God provides meat for thy twofold Nature: For
thy bodies food, physic, and support, He provides, preserves, and sustains all
sublunary Creatures: and for thy Souls food, physic and support, He provides
the bread of Angels, and himself in person; the Baker being the Holy Ghost, the
Oven the Virgin Mary, the Fire Charity, the Matter Human Nature united to the
Divinity: O prodigies of Affection!

12. Thy other Sacraments, O my Lord and my God! contain and give Grace, but
this contains and gives the Author of Grace, the Fire of Love, the Sun of
Justice, the Fountain of Mercy: This therefore surpasses them, as far as the
Sun does its Beam, the Fire its Flame, and the Fountain its Rivulet: O how
excessive is thy Love (Dear Lord!) to my poor Soul? in that thou art pleased to
visit it in thy proper person; to cure, cleanse and comfort it with thy own
divin hand and heart, to nourish it with thy own blessed Body and Blood! O what
thanks, honor, love and gratitude, are due to thy infinite bounty and
liberality! O my Soul! where are thy exclamations, admirations, ecstasies of
affection? Remainest thou alone insensible, dry, and undevout, amongst these
miracles of Gods goodness toward thee? Have thou no heart, no feeling, no
fervor amidst these flames of his Charity? Enkindle new fires, O Lord! in my
heart; burn it, consume it, annihilate it in the furnace of thy Love.

13. O the admirable power of my God which works so many Miracles at one Word
of his servants mouth? Bread becomes Flesh, Wine Blood, the Creature our
Creator! Speak also a Word (sweet Jesu!) to my Soul; say, This Soul is mine:
Take it (Lord!) transform it, change it into thy self! Let it be no longer mine
but thine, for all future time and eternity.

14 Why was this divin Sacrament instituted under the forms of Bread and Wine?
1. To show the necessity of it. Can our bodies live without bread and drink?
And can our Souls live without thee, O loving Jesu! 2. To teach us what Union
our Lord desires to make with our Souls: Is not meat and drink incorporated
into our substance? And is not this the effect of thy Sacramental presence (O
Savior!) in humble and holy Souls? O what alterations, what alienations, what
ecstasies do they feel in and after Communion! They do not breath, but burn; not
live, but languish; their life is all Love, their Spirit all Fire. O Lord, let
fall one drop of this dew upon my dry Soul! Give it (good Jesu!) one Spark of
this Fire, one Beam of this Light, one Draught of this inebriating Affection.

15. This is my Body which shall suffer for you; This is my Blood which shall
be shed for you: I bestow on thee (O beloved Soul!) not my Riches, not my
Clothes, not any of my Creatures, but my own dear body dying for thee, my own
precious Blood poured out for thee. See thou how prodigal I am of my Love and
Life, of my Body and Blood? all which I give thee, as a seal of my Promises of
Pardon here, and of Paradise hereafter. And can thou remain still deaf to
these powerful charms of my love? Will thou not be yet won by these woings of
my Affection?

16. To whom (O my Lord!) have thou given this great power over thy self, to
consecrate and transubstantiate Bread and Wine into thy sacred Body and Blood?
Not to Angels, but to Men, that every one may have free access to this sweet
Fountain at all times, without horror or apprehension. And (O my soul!) shall
we perish with hunger and thirst, through our own laziness, coldness, and
tepidity?

17. The holy Prophet Elias, being overwhelmed with sadness, cast himself on
the ground, under the Canopy of a Juniper tree in the Desert; where crying out
to his Creator in the bitterness of his heart, as one weary of the world, of
his life, of all things; O my God! (says he) It is enough; take away my soul
out of my body, for I am no better than my Forefathers: which said, He fell
into a slumber; But an Angel awaked him, wills him to arise, and eat, for that
he had yet a great journey to make: who obeying his commands, walked on safely
in the force of that food, even to the Mount Horeb. O my poor desolate and
disconsolate Soul! How often do we faint and fall under our burden? We are
sometimes weary of our life, and then we desire to be dissolved, and to be with
our dear Savior Christ. When beholding a Table ready set, covered and
prepared, we Confess and Communicate, and presently our Heart is eased, our
Spirit is fortified, our Fear and Sadness are diminished, our Courage and
Confidence are augmented; new Life, new Love, new Vigor, new Fire, new Fervor
is poured into our Souls; all seems easy, and we run on in the race of our
earthly Pilgrimage, with joy and alacrity. Up therefore, (my soul!) take
courage, thy God is for thee, and with thee; eat and drink of this heavenly
Banquet, and stop not thy course till thou arrivest at his holy Mountain.

18. For what does a poor Pilgrim petition? but a little food to refresh him
in his journey. What does a Prisoner seek and desire? but life, liberty and
food. I am a Pilgrim (O my God!) banished from my Country and Kindred: I am
kept in a double Prison, my Soul in the Body, and both in the World, (out of
which I cannot hope to be freed, without many a bitter pang:) In the mean space
What do I ask of thee (my Lord and Savior!) but my daily Bread? True Sorrow
for my offenses, which is the bread of Sinners: True Devotion, which is the
bread of Children: And the blessed Communion, which is the bread of Angels.
Admit me, (dear Jesu!) unto this divin Banquet, and permit me to fill my hungry
Heart and Soul at this holy Table, that so I may get strength and courage to go
on in my Pilgrimage: Patience and Perseverance to support my Imprisonment; till
thou, (O my Lord, my Love, and my All!) shall be pleased to call me to thy
Eternal Rest, Eternal Life, Eternal Liberty.

Other Considerations to stir up in our Souls an ardent Desire of the sacred
Communion.
COme to this divin Table, (O devout Soul!)

1. As a sick and sorrowful Patient to his pious and powerful Physician:
detecting his wounds, declaring his wants, and humbly demanding a Remedy.

2. As a disloyal Servant to his Lord and Master; promising amendment, and
begging pardon and reconciliation.

3. As a starved and ashamed Prodigal Child to his tender and compassionate
Father: to be received, relieved, revived by his Bounty.

4. As a Friend to his Friend; who thus lovingly invites him; Come my friend,
Eat, Drink, be inebriated, my dearest; I will refresh and recreate you; Come
with confidence, and sit down at my Table, My delights are to be with the
Children of men.

5. As a poor Beggar to a rich Benefactor, desiring to be clothed, lodged,
nourished.

6. As a rebellious Sinner, to his merciful Redeemer, resolving to honor him,
love him, and serve him better for the future.

7. As a loving Spouse to her loving, lovely, and beloved Bridegroom: to kiss
and embrace him, and to be constant and faithful to him, to live and die with
him for time and eternity.

8. As a wounded and wearied Heart, desiring Water, and panting after Jesus, the
Fountain of Life and Love.

9. As an Hungry Person to a gorgeous Banquet, where all is ready, to which he
is lovingly invited, where he may be fully satiated.

10. As a Covetous man to a Mine of Money: Is not Jesus your Treasure? where
then is your Heart? Give all, and thou shall have all; Give thy self, and thou
shall have God: O happy exchange! O holy Usury!

11. As a weather-beaten Soldier to his Prey after the Victory: What Spoils
are here, (O Soldier of Christ!) What a rich Booty may thou here freely take?

12. As a little Child to his Mothers breasts, to be suckled, cherished,
comforted, and to rest in her bosom,

13. As S. Mary Magdalen: 1. Either like her a Penitent, lying prostrate at the
feet of Jesus in a Banquet, Anointing, Weeping, Washing, Wiping, Embracing
them: 2. Or like her a Patient, at the foot of the Cross: receiving into your
Breast the drops of Blood, distilling from your Saviors opened side, to
cleanse, cure and comfort your Soul. 3. Or like her a Contemplative at the
Monument; providing for Jesus a Sepulcher in your Heart. And he calling [N.]
answer him, Master: Welcome; It is enough: And then fall into an ecstasy of
Love and Affection.

14. Remember the Dialogue between Christ and the Cananean Woman: She begs,
cries, calls, importunes him for an Alms: Jesus refuses, because (says he) the
Bread of Children is not to be cast to the Dogs: It Is true (Lord!) yet the Dogs
are permitted to catch the offal crumbs which fall from their Masters table; and
that is as much as I desire, and much more than I deserve. Apply it to your
self.

15. Imagine your self seated at Board, with your blessed Savior in his last
Supper, with all his Apostles about him: And that you receive from his sacred
hands (as you do from the Priests) his precious Body and Blood, which he
reaches to your Mouth, saying: Take, Eat, be satiated, and Inebriated, This is
my own true Body and Blood, which I here give you; Remember this my Love and
Liberality, and Go in peace, I am with you, Be not afraid. O excess of Comfort
and Content! O love able to melt a Rock into affection! Reply accordingly, and
consider you are now present at the same Supper, have the same Meat and Drink
set before you; the same Sacrifice, the same Priest, the same Love bestowing
it. Let your Heart be the Altar, your Soul the Pix, and your Will another
Sacrifice,

The first of the precedent Considerations, dilated with Affections; which may
serve as a pattern, by which the others may likewise be enlarged, according to
each ones capacity and devotion.
As a Patient to his Physician.
TAke pity on me, (Lord!) for I am weak and infirm. The healthy have no need of
a Physician, but they who are ill at ease: nor did you come (Dear Savior!) to
call the Just, but Sinners. And alas! I am one of them, My Soul is sick and
sinful; My heart is sore afflicted and ill affected: I am all full of
disordinate affections, unruly passions, violent temptations, and vain
distractions: I am nothing but impatience, impurity, impertinency,
immortification, inconstancy: I am made up of pride, presumption, propriety,
partiality. Oh! my Soul is sick all over! All is self-love, self-will, and
self-seeking. Thou (O sweet Jesu!) art my Physician: and if thou art so
pleased, thou can soon purify me. Take therefore (O compassionate Savior!)
the care and cure of my sick Soul, into thy sacred and powerful hands; for all
my hope of help and health is from thee only.

O what subject of Comfort, Courage, and Confidence have thou (my weak Soul!)
since thy Physician is Almighty, having all creatures at his command;
All-mercy, his Love making him do what is best; All-wisdom, knowing all
Consciences, all Wounds, and all the ways to Cure them!

Wherefore (O Soul-saving Physician!) if thou art always ready and always
willing to heal thy poor Patients: what need I fear but only to displease thee?
or care but only to content thee? If any earthly Physician had all these joint
qualities; Would he permit any Patient to perish? See then (my soul!) where the
defect is: In the Patient, or in the Physician? And finding it assuredly in thy
self: Remove it speedily; and then approach it confidently.

Alas! my Body is an Hospital; my Soul is the Patient; my Diseases are, A
burning Fever of Choler, a cold fit of Tepidity, a Tympany of Pride, a
Dropsy of Avarice, a Fistula of Self-love, etc. very dangerous, and deep
Diseases! But behold, my Physician is coming in person into my poor House and
Hospital, to lodge and live with me. O Love! O Lord! O Father! O Physician!
Behold my Wounds, and my Wants.

But What is the Physic he prescribes, What the Plasters he applies? Admire
with Joy, (O my sickly Soul!) accept with Gratitude, drink and digest with
Delight and Comfort. Here are no bitter Pills, no unsavory Potions, no
corroding Drugs to be swallowed down; but the most sweet, solid and wholesome
food of Angels, even his own most precious Body and Blood. O Love unheard of! O
Physic beyond imagination! The Lord, the King, the Father, the Physician has
made a Bath of his own Blood, a Medicin of his own Flesh, a Banquet of his own
Person, to Bathe, to Cure, to Nourish his Son, his Subject, his Slave, his
Patient, his Enemy, a Worm, a Nothing. O my Soul! How shall we reward so
charitable a Physisician! O my Lord! First Cure me, and then take me for thy
Fee!

And how was this Physic obtained? At what Rate was it purchased? and by whose
Love and Expenses? Surely all Heaven and Earth could not pay it, but God gave
his only Son for the price of it! O excess of Goodness and Mercy! The Physician
himself is also the Physic, the Potion, and the Price. O Mystery! O Miracle!
The Physician is let blood in the Hands and Feet, with Nails; in the Head, with
Thorns; in the Heart, with a Lance; He is Drencht with a bitter Potion of
Vinegar and Gall; and in the end, He Dies a most painful death on the Cross.
Why all this? To give Health, Strength, Liberty, and Life, to my sick and
sinful Soul. O dear Jesu! how much am I thy Debtor? O Angels and Saints! concur
with me to give him Thanks. O Heaven and Earth! help me to praise him. O my
Body and Soul! consume as Wax and Oil upon the Altar of his Love. O all my
faculties! melt away in the Fire of his Charity.

Lastly, O my Soul! This Physician is no stranger, no forreigner, but thy God
and thy Father. And how happy am I, (O my good Father!) to be under thy
skilful, tender, and loving Hand! Lance, cut, kill thy Child, if thou spare him
for Eternity.

Other Acts, Affections, and Preparations for Communion.
Christ's Invitation.
COme unto me all you that labor, in temptation and trouble; all you that are
overladen with your burdensome body and bad nature; All you that are assaulted
with vicious inclinations and violent Passions; All you that are dismayed at the
Memory of your past offenses, and at the feeling of your present frailty.

Come to me, your Father, your Physician, your Food: Have you sinned? I will
forgive you. Are you Sick and Wounded? I will comfort and cure you. Are you
Troubled and Tempted? I will ease and deliver you. Are you Weak and ready to
faint under your Burden? I will nourish and strengthen you. Are you Cold,
Dull, Dark, Desolate, and even dead? I will inflame you, enlighten you, revive
you, melt you into Devotion, and transform you into my self, by a perfect Union.

Why come you not to me? Behold I come to you begging to be your Guest, and
desiring to be lodged in your Breast. I come not only into your House, but into
your Heart: Not only to eat with you, but to be eaten by you: Turn away then
from all Creatures, Return to me your Creator, turn unto me your Center and
Satiety.

The Soul's Admiration.
WHo art thou? (my Lord God!) To whom will thou come? Where meanest thou to
lodge? What moves thee to so great Charity? What will thou do in my poor Cottage?

Humility.
O Lord; I profess my self unworthy to take thy holy Name into my sinful mouth;
and shall I presume to take thy sacred Body and Blood into my impure Soul? Will
thou give the Bread of Children to a beastly Dog?

Yes (my Soul!) such is thy Lord and Masters admirable Love and Mercy, that he
gives himself to be eaten by thee, his poor, base, and abject slave. O excess
of goodness!

Wishes.
O That of every Creature I could make a rational Soul; Of every Soul a burning
Seraphin; of every Seraphin a heavenly Kingdom: to the end that thou (my loving
Lord!) might be lodged purely, be served perfectly, be pleased totally, and
be praised eternally.

Praises.
LEt Heaven and Earth bless thy Name, magnify thy mercy, exalt thy bounty; Let
thy own infinite Love and Goodness sanctify thee; And let my poor Soul, and
all that is within me, say Amen, Allelujah. Thou art worthy ( O Lamb of God!
who were slaughtered and sacrificed for the sins of the world!) to receive all
honor, glory and benediction from all Creatures.

Supplication.
O Amiable and innocent Lamb! Cloth me with thy Wool, hide me in thy Wounds,
cleanse me with thy Blood, lodge me in thy Heart, revive me by thy Death, unite
me to thy Love, swallow me up in thy Divinity, melt me away in the fire of thy
Charity, and make me every way according to thy own hearts desire.

Peace be unto you, Fear not, I am he; It is I, who have ascended to my Father
and your Father, that I may open Heaven gates for you, and provide you there a
happy lodging and yet I remain with you in the sacred Eucharist, till the
worlds final consummation.

Faith.
YEs, Lord Jesu! It is thou, thy precious Body and Blood, thy blessed Humanity
and Divinity. Yes, (my sweet Savior!) I as firmly believe it with my Soul, as
if I clearly saw it with my Eyes, plainly tasted it with my Mouth, or sensibly
touched it with my Hands; and I faithfully cry out, My Lord and my God,

Resignation and Desire.
I Renounce all that is mine, and resign unto thee (O my Lord!) all that is
thine: I desire with all my heart, I were according to thy Hearts desire; and
that thou would please to make such a Change in me, that nothing might
evermore displease thee in me.

Renunciation and pure Intention.
I Come to this Sacrament (O my Savior!) out of Obedience to thy sweet
Invitations; and upon Confidence in thy saving Mercies: My Intention is to do
thy Will, and not my own; to seek thy Satisfaction, not to feel sensible
Devotion; and to please and praise thee by the performance of my Duty: that so
I may get by my Resignation, what I cannot by my Recollection; and content thee
by my Desires, since I cannot by my Deserts.

Confession, Contrition, Resolution.
O My Lord! Behold my Wounds, my Wants: and my Wishes: I remain still
ungrateful, wretched, wicked, tepid, vicious, unmortified, full of Pride,
Passions, Imperfections! I am sorry heartily, I purpose amendment really; and I
beseech thee (O Jesu!) for thy own goodness sake, mercifully to forgive me, and
to cure all, consume all, consummate all that displeases thee in my Soul, in
the sacred Fire of thy Divinity.

Petition.
THy self (O my sweet Savior!) is all I want, and thy Love is all I wish for!
O let me see thee, love thee, enjoy thee, feed on thee, be satiated with the
torrents of thy true delights, and be totally inebriated and drowned in the
Ocean of thy ineffable sweetnesses.

Wean my soul, O Lord! from all terrene and temporal Affections, and Wed it
unto thy self, by an inviolable tie of Love and Fidelity.

Provide for thy self, O Jesu! a lovely lodging in my heart and soul!

O you holy Angels and Saints! come and prepare your Master's dwelling place
within me!

2. What is to be done in Communion?
IN Communion, two things are required, First; A Reverend, Retired, Modest
behavior of your whole Exterior: humbly placing your self upon your knees,
keeping your Body erected, Head unmoved, Eyes fixed on the Sacrament, Lips
quiet, and so expecting till the Priest shall have fully placed the Sacred Host
in your (conveniently opened) Mouth: and be sure not to anticipate his Action,
by reaching your self, on your head forwards in order to receive; or by
snatching your Head or Mouth suddenly backwards, after you have received.

Secondly: A profound Humility of Heart, and longing Love of your Soul, mixed
together, saying:

O God! be merciful unto me a sinner.

I am not worthy, (O my Lord!) that thou should enter under my roof: yet (I
beseech thee,) speak the Word, and my soul shall be saved.

O sweet Jesu! That thou thy self should come to me, into me; A Lord of such
purity and perfection, to so impure and imperfect a creature as I am! O Love, O
Liberality!

Come Lord Jesu! Come loving Master, Enter freely into my open Soul, which
desires to embrace thee.

All is thine, Dear Savior! dispose of all that is here, of Body and Soul, of
Life, Lodging, All, according to thy divin Will and pleasure.

Welcome, my good Jesu! Now dismiss thy servant in peace, for my Eyes have seen
thy salvation.

3. What is to be done after Communion.
HAving received the Priests last Benediction, arise, return to your place, and
renew your ardent affections, in this or the like manner.

O Fire! O Flames! Burn me, Consume me, Annihilate me.

Alas! Beauty of Angels! how late have I loved? and how little do I yet love
thee?

Behold a poor lodging: yet such as it is, it is all thy own; I conceal
nothing, I reserve nothing; Compose all, Dispose of all, Depose all my unruly
Passions, Impose upon me what thou please, only repose sweetly in my soul,
and permit no soul, false, or foolish affection to interpose it self, or
disturb this quiet peace and union.

O that I could lodge thee more worthily, serve thee more faithfully, please
thee more perfectly, praise thee more incessantly, love thee more ardently!

O Jesu my Lord, my all and only love! a thousand times welcome.

What shall I render thee (O sweet Savior!) for all the good things thou have
given me? I humbly acknowledge that I ow more than I have to give, but not more
than I would give, if I had it. O Lord! take all that I have, and pay thy self.
O Angels and Saints, bless my God for me; Love my Jesus for me, and sing forth
his praises, purely, perfectly, perpetually, in supply of my defects.

Be careful to keep your Friend company after your Feast, and not to drive him
presently out of doors, or leave him alone.

What a Shame Ingratitude, yea, and Incivility were it for you, having received
the King of Heaven and Earth, to go forthwith, not only out of the Chapel, but
even out of your own self, by evagation of mind, and extroversion of spirit?
This surely is one reason, why many remain so cold, near this Fire.

But perchance your particular charge, office, employment calls you away: Were
you called from your Meal; Tell me, Would you not supply ^ some after? Do here
in like manner.

Howsoever, be sure (at least for some short space) to keep a Mental Solitude
and Recollection, if not a Corporal; entertaining your divin Guest with the
devout Aspirations, Affections, and Elevations of the eighth prescedent
Exercise of Perfect Union with God, Page 336. And then falling into Acts of
Thanksgiving, Congratulation, Praise, Admiration, Oblation, etc.

Think within your self, 1. Who has Fed you? 2. With what Food? 3. In how
admirable a Manner? 4. With what an excess of Love? 5. What he requires in
Recompense?

Then you may do well to perform these things following.

1. Renew all your good purposes, Vows, Professions, etc. 2. Make a new Reunion
and Conformity of all your desires, Wills, and Affections, to them of your
blessed Savior. 3. Resolve upon some thing in particular, which does most
hinder you, hurt you or trouble you 4. Ask your Saviors advice and Counsel
therein. And 5. Having marked his Inspirations; Resolve effectually, and fall
to practice accordingly.

More Exercises, Acts, and Considerations for such as have more Time, Zeal and
Devotion.
Four Petitions, after Communion, (which may be made also at any other time,
with very much profit.)
1. HAving lodged your Lord and Master, Cleanly. 2. Thanked him heartily. 3.
Offered him all freely. 4. Resolved to leave all for him Sincerely. 5. Promised
to serve him faithfully.

Ask what you stand in need of; Go to him boldly, and beg of him confidently;
for he will deny you nothing that shall be for your Good and his Glory: since,
as sure as God is God, so sure it is, that he is Good, and that he desires your
good.

And now is the time to treat with him about the affairs of your Soul, and your
Salvation: For he is seated in the midst of your Heart, as a King upon the
Throne of his Mercy, To give Audience, To receive Complaints, To redress
Aggrievances, and to give favorable Sentences. Speak therefore to him:

Lord Jesu! I here show you my Wounds as to my Physician; My Wants, as to my
Father: My Wishes, as to my Friend. I am Wounded all over, in my Soul,
Understanding, Will, Affections, Passions.

I Want all that is good, Humility, Charity, Patience, etc.

What I wish, thou well know, who art privy to my secret sighs. O Father, O
Physician, O Friend! Cure me, Comfort me, Content me.

1. My first Petition is: That thy sacred Name may be Sanctified, Honored and
Praised; by all, in all, above all: That thy Kingdom may come, thy Kingdom of
Grace in this world, and of Glory in the next: That thy Will may be done in
Earth as it is in Heaven, in me and in all things, purely, perfectly, eternally.

2. My second Petition is: True Light, true Love, true Liberty, true Life. O my
Soul! Mark well how much thou want these Four things, and thou will heartily
demand them.

3. My third Petition is: A generous Disgust and Contempt of all terrene and
sensual Comforts, Companies, Commodities: A clear sight, and a courageous
Resolution, to know and to enterprise whatsoever shall be to thy Will and
Honor: An invincible Patience and Perseverance, in enduring all this lives
Crosses, Contradictons, Inconveniences. A simple, naked, and indifferent
Charity; loving God in all, and above all, and all others, in or for Him,
without interest, or partiality, or hypocrisy.

4. My fourth Petition is: Increase of Grace, Extirpation of Vice, Implantation
of Virtue, Mortification of Passions, Victory over ill Customs, Progress in
divin Love, Purity of Intention, Perseverance in the way of Perfection.

All which I most humbly beg for my self, for my Friends, for my Enemies, for
them who have done me any good, for the whole Church, for all the World.

Two Questions; which Jesus proposes to the Soul, being in the midst thereof:
After Communion.
1. O Blind Creature! What will thou, that I should do unto thee? What do
thou want? desire? expect? Fear not to speak, I am thy Father, and thy
Physician.

Lord, That I may See. Thou may easily perceive (sweet Savior!) what I Want,
and for what I Wish. What does a Blind wretch desire but Eyes and Light, to See
and Know both thee and Himself, thy Mercy and his own misery, thy Will and his
own Obligations? Lord! Let me See thee here by Faith, and hereafter by eternal
Vision, Fruition, Possession.

2. Peter! Love thou me more than these? N. tell me truly, feel the pulse of
thy Heart, weigh thy Affection in the just Balance of the Sanctuary, speak
unfainedly without self-flattery; Do thou Love me? at least, will thou Love
me? how much do thou love me, more than all these Creatures?

Answer if thou dare: Lord! thou know that I love thee a little, and I
will love thee more, and will never cease to love thee, till I come to love
thee only.

It is easy for the Sea to swallow up a small Drop, for the fire to consume a
little Straw, and for the Sun to revive a little Worm: And is it not easier for
thee, (O Sea of Sweetness! O Fire of Love! O Sun of Justice!) to absorp,
transform, annihilate my poor Spirit into your Self, and to make me a pure and
perfect love; changing my Sadness into Joy, Darkness into Light, Coldness into
Fervor; and putting new Vigor, new Heat, new life into my Heart?

N. Do thou love me! If so, let me see the Tree by its Fruits: Do this for my
love: Cut off such a superfluity; abandon such company; avoid such curiosity,
etc. Love such an one for my sake; Forgive all upon my command; Suffer this
Mortification, Contradiction, Cross, Infirmity for my love: leave all for me,
and leave thy self to me.

. 9. Directions, Entertainments, and Affections during the time of Mass.
Every devout Christian should carefully observe these three Rules.
1. TO hear Mass daily if he has health, leisure, and opportunity.

2. Not to go to Mass for fashions sake, or out of custom; but out of a deep
sense of the incomprehensible greatness of this divin Sacrifice; and out of a
fervent desire to contemplate his God, clothed with our humanity, under the
shapes of Bread and Wine in the Priests hands.

3. Not to enter into the place designed for this holy purpose, as he would
into a Playhouse: but with a Reverent, Religious, Recollected composition of
all his exterior and interior Senses; and (briefly) with such a behavior, as
may beseem one who is to be honored with the presence, and speech of a God.

Preparatory Prayers before Mass.
Whilst the Priest is vesting himself, you may entertain your self with some of
these following Prayers and Elevations.
PRostrate before the Throne of thy divin Majesty, (O dread Sovereign!) I
humbly implore thy Pardon for my Offenses, thy Grace for a supply of my
indignity, and thy Love to ravish my soul, and senses in the contemplation of
this Sacred Mystery; that my whole interior and exterior man, may be entirely
employed in praising, and admiring thy infinite Goodness and Mercy.

O sweet Jesu! I will accompany thee to Mount Calvary: Make me partaker (I
beseech thee) of that Charity which conducted thee thither: Give me such a
feeling of thy sufferings, as had the daughters of Sion, meeting thee with the
Cross on thy Shoulders, a Cord about thy Neck, and a Thorny Crown on thy Head:
Grant me a Resignation of my Will to thine, like that of thy Virgin Mother at
the foot of thy Cross: And by the Merits of thy Sufferings, and Constancy,
bestow on me the gift of Perseverance in thy love and service.

O divin Spirit! the faithful Bridegroom of my Soul! Descend now graciously
into it, purify it from the dross of its imperfections, and replenish it with
the flames of thy sacred affections; that it may breath nothing but thy Love,
and desire nothing but the accomplishment of thy Will.

Then direct your intention, and apply the Mass in this manner.
I offer unto thee (O my God of infinite Majesty!) this divin Sacrifice by the
hands of thy Priest; For the Remission of all my Sins, for a Thanksgiving for
all thy Benefits, for a Supply of all my spiritual and temporal Necessities,
for my Friends and Enemies. Lord! Conserve thy Church, Convert the Infidels,
Extirpate all Heresies, unite Christian Princes, and give solace to the poor
Souls suffering in Purgatory.

At the beginning of Mass.
The Priest's bowing down before the Altar at his Confiteor, represents our
Savior prostrate at his Prayers before his Eternal Father in the Garden, for
the Remission of your Sins: Make you also a general Confession of your Sins
with the Priest, and humble your self before the divin Majesty, saying:
I Humbly cast my self, (O my sweet Redeemer!) at thy sacred Feet, desiring to
wash them with my tears, in acknowledgment of my wickedness: O Jesu! take
compassion upon thy poor creature, redeemed with thy precious Blood, who
repents him heartily of all his past Sins, and purposes seriously, by the
assistance of thy Grace, to serve thee more faithfully, seek thee more
diligently, and love thee more fervently for the future.

At the Introite.
Reflect upon Gods immense Greatness, Charity and Mercy.
I Rejoice, (O Eternal Lord God!) in that thou art what thou art; and that
there is no Being but by thee only. Thou well know (O infinite Goodness!)
what thy self is, and what I am: Thou art All, and I am Nothing: And yet thou
seek after me!

At Kyrie eleison:
Demand pardon for the Sins of the whole World
HAve mercy (O Lord!) upon all them who are in mortal Sin; reclaim their
perverse Wills to thy love, and give them the grace of true and perfect
Repentance, that thy Name may be magnified, thy goodness extolled, and thy
praises celebrated by them and all thy creatures.

At Gloria in Excelsis.
Desire and endeavor the promotion of Gods Honor and Glory, to the utmost of
your power.
O My God! how joyfully, affectionatly, incessantly, do the Angels adore thee,
and sing forth thy divin Praises! And how slack are men in serving, honoring
and loving thee? O how highly does the fervor and diligence of those blessed
Spirits delight me; and how much does men's negligence and forgetfulness
displease me?

Lord! I humbly adore thee with those holy Quires, and heartily desire, that
the whole World would render thee all due honor, homage and adoration. Lift up
my Heart, (O my Lord!) and lodge my affections in the place where my Treasure
lies: Let all that I think, say, or do, intend thy honor; and let my Soul and
Tongue resound always, Glory be to God on high.

At Dominus vobiscum.
BE thou always with me, (O my God!) and let thy Grace never depart from me.

At the Prayers, or Collects.
Humbly join your Prayers with them of the Priest, saying,
O Eternal Lord God! look mercifully upon thy well-beloved Spouse, the
Catholic Church; and graciously receive the Petitions which she humbly
presents to the Throne of thy Sacred Majesty, by this Priests mediation and
Ministry. Hear us, (O Lord!) and help us, for thy dear Sons sake, our only
Savior and Redeemer, Christ Jesus.

At the Epistle.
Entertain your self in considering how our Blessed Savior was hurried from
Annas to Caiphas, from Pilate to Herod, from one place to another in the time
of his Passion: How he was questioned, accused, buffeted, abused: Then pray for
patience in your sufferings.
O Sweet Savior! I most humbly beseech thee, by the Merits of al thy unjust
Sufferings, to give me courage, constancy and patience in all such occasions
of injuries, crosses and contradictions, as thy Divin Providence shall permit
to befall me, during this my lives Pilgrimage. Grant that I may equally adore
thy Eternal Will in prosperity, and adversity, and resignedly submit my self,
and all that any way concerns me, to thy most just and sacred disposition.

At the Gospel.
Rise up, to show your readiness to obey the Evangelical Doctrine: and stand
attentively harkening to your Saviors own sweet words: (But if you understand
not their meaning, reflect upon some other point or passage of your Redeemers
life, instruction, or counsel:) Imploring his Grace for the effectual execution
of what he there teaches you, advises you, inspires you.
ILluminate my interior Eyes, (O God of my heart!) Unveil my Understanding,
and Inflame my Affections; that I may clearly see and know thy holy Will, and
cheerfully accomplish thy sacred Precepts, Counsels, and Inspirations.

At the Creed.
You may make a profession of your Faith by a mental or vocal recital of your
Creed together with the Priest: Or say briefly thus.
O Sovereign Deity! I firmly believe thee to be one God, in three Persons; who
madst all things of nothing. I believe, that the Second Person became Man in
blessed Mary's womb, by the Holy Ghosts operation; and that he died for me and
all mankind on the Cross. I believe that he arose from Death, that he ascended
into Heaven, and that he shall judge the whole World in the last Day. I believe
the holy Catholic Church, and whatsoever she teaches and defines. And in this
Faith I will live and die.

Offer up your Prayers also for the Illumination and Conversion of all
Unbelievers.
TAke pity, O Lord, upon all Infidels, Heretics, and Schismatics; And
remember (O most compassionate Creator!) that thy powerful hand did not bring
these perfect products out of their eternal Nothing, and stamp their Rational
Souls with thy own sacred Image, in order to destroy and abandon them, since
thou have been graciously pleased to send down thy only Son, my dear Savior,
to Redeem and Ransom them (as well as my unworthy self) with the price of his
most precious Blood.

Dart therefore (O Sovereign Lord, and sincere Lover of all Souls!) some
efficacious beams of thy heavenly light, into their dark and deceived
Understandings: that they may see the Truths of thy sacred Mysteries; and give
them Grace to submit their Necks to the sweet and easy yoke of thy Precepts,
and thy Churches Prescripts.

Ah! (my dear Lord!) what have I done for thee, or what have I deserved of
thee, that I should be called to thy saving Faith, and be made a Member of thy
sacred Church? Impart (I beseech thee) the like favor to these your missed,
mistaken, and unbelieving Creatures: that they may (with me) faithfully
acknowledge, adore, and love thee, their glorious Maker and Redeemer; admiringly
praise and magnify thy Goodness, and joyfully celebrate thy Mercies, with
Canticles of eternal gratitude and thanksgiving.

At the Offertorie, or Oblation of the Bread and Wine.
Make also an humble and hearty Oblation of your Body, Soul, Goods, Friends, to
the divin Majesty.
O Eternal Father! In union of that ineffable Love wherewith my dear Savior
offered up himself on the Cross to thy divin Majesty; I also offer up my self
with him: humbly beseeching thee to direct all my thoughts, words and works to
thy Honor, to my own good, to my neighbors edification.

I offer up this divin Sacrifice, to the glory of thy Name, to the honor of thy
Angels and Saints, to satisfy for my sins, to thank thee for thy benefits, to
obtain a supply of my temporal and spiritual necessities.

I particularly offer it up, to obtain this Virtue, conquer this Temptation,
amend this Imperfection, surmount this Passion: And for all them who have
desired my Prayers, or to whom I have promised them.

At Lavabo.
Humbly beg to have your Soul washed from all its filth and wickedness;
reciting the Psalm Miserere, or some Verses of it; as
AMplius lava me, etc. Dew down (O merciful Creator!) one small drop of thy
divin Grace into my sinful Soul; or rather, shower down an abundance of thy
sweet waters upon me, to cleanse me from my enormous crimes and impurities.

Asperges me Hysopo, etc. Be sprinkle my Soul, (O Sovereign Lord God!) with the
Hysop of thy Grace, that I may serve thee more purely: Wash me with thy sacred
waters, till I become whiter than the driven Snow, etc.

At the Preface.
Lift up your heart to contemplate the Beauties, Glories and Greatnesses of
Heaven, whither you tend, and which is your only home, aim, and end.
HOw desirable are thy Tabernacles, (O Lord God of Hosts!) My Soul sighs,
pants, and thirsts after you, more than the wearied Stag breaths after the
refreshing Fountains. Draw me after thee (O divin source of all sweetness!) and
I shall run cheerfully after the odours of thy perfumes: for what do I seek but
thee, or what can satisfy me but thy self, in Heaven or in Earth?

O that the memory of thy eternal good things, remained always deeply ingrav'd
in my Soul; how easily should I then disdain all temporal, perishable, and
worldly trifles?

O my God, and my All! when shall I be so happy, as to behold thee clearly in
thy heavenly Glory?

At Sanctus.
Keep your Heart raised up to your Creator; praising, adoring, admiring the
infinite Majesty of the Sacred Trinity, as if you were amidst the blessed Quires
of Angels and Saints in Heaven: intoning with them.
HOly, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabbath. Heaven and Earth are full of your
Glory, Hosanna in the highest.

O Holy of Holies! give me a glimps of thy glorious self, that my illuminated
Soul may praise thee more purely, and love thee more perfectly.

O celestial Seraphins! who incessantly praise my God, with the sweet Eccho's
of your eternally repeated Holy; descend from Heaven to help my desirous heart
in singing forth his praises; that I may also become holy, pure and perfect in
the presence of my Lord and Maker.

At the first Memento.
INto thy sacred Hands (O sweet Savior!) I recommend my Soul with all its
faculties, my Body with all its senses, my whole Interior and Exterior man
with all its affections and actions.

Preserve me (O all-powerful Redeemer!) from all Sin and Impuritie; and give me
perseverance in thy love and service.

Let thy undrainable fountain of mercy (O Lord Jesu!) extend also it self
toward my Kindred, Friends, Enemies, (particularly toward such and such) and
all them for whom I ought to offer up my Prayers to thy divin Majesty.

Whilst the Priest pursues the rest of the Canon in silence; do you also
recollect your Senses in expectation of your Saviors presence upon the Altar,
which will be as soon as the words of Consecration are ended: Your Heart burning
in the mean while, with these like desires of S. Augustine.
O My Comforter! appear unto me! O only light of my Souls eyes, let me see thee!

O only Joy of my Spirit! Come and glad me with thy presence!

O only Jubily of my Heart! Let me contemplate thee!

O my Lord, my Life, my Love, my All! Show me thy self, and I shall be safe,
etc.

At the Elevation of the sacred Host and Chalice, represent to your self, how
your Redeemer offers up himself there to the Eternal Father: and conforming
your Devotion to the Spirit of Christ Jesus, you may say with heart or mouth.
O Adorable Majesty! In Union of this affectionate Reverence which my Redeemer
now renders thee; In memory of his dolorous Passion; And in acknowledgment of
my own Nothing, and thy infinite Greatness: I humbly offer unto thee a perpetual
submission of all my Being, all my Powers, all my Faculties, Be thou eternally
exalted, admired, and glorified, O Holy, Holy, Holy Trinity, My Lord, my God,
my All.

Or thus, by way of Ejaculations, Affections, Ecstasies.
O Goodness! O Mercy! O Love! O Liberality! O immense, infinite,
incomprehensible, excessive Charity!

O Eternal Father! behold thy beloved Son, and my blessed Savior; whom I
humbly offer up to thy divin Majesty in satisfaction for all my offenses,
negligences, ingratitudes.

I offer thee his purity, innocence, perfection; to satisfy for my impuritie,
malice, impiety: his Humility for my Pride; his Zeal for my Tepiditie; all
the Sanctity of his life, for all the imperfections of my life.

O merciful and compassionate Father! Look upon thy own Sons Charity: Behold
how he once offered himself, a Bloody Sacrifice on the Cross for my salvation:
and how he now offers himself, an unbloody Sacrifice on this Altar for the same
end. O holy Father! receive this his holy Sacrifice, in lieu of all the honors,
homages, gratitudes, which are due to thy sacred and sovereign goodness from me
and all thy creatures.

Keeping your mind still fixed upon your dear Savior now present on the Altar;
speak unto him with the most tender affections which your Heart can possibly
produce, either by Acts of Praise; as,
O Son of God! what can be compared to thy Charity? O my Lord! who is like
thee in Goodness, in Love, in Liberality? O sweet Jesu! thou art my Rest, my
Refuge, my Riches, my Center, my Hope, my Happiness, my All.

Or, by Acts of Complacencie; as,
O King of Heaven and Earth! Thou art here the Joy of my Soul, as thou art
there the Jubily of thy Saints. Thou art here on the Altar, and thou art there
in thy eternal glory and beatitude. O Amiable Sacrifice! O Admirable Invention
of the divin Power, Wisdom and Charity!

Or, by Acts of Thanksgiving:
O Dear Savior! How much have thou done for an unworthy wretch! O the excess
of thy goodness! who can sufficiently acknowledge it? O Great Monarch of both
worlds! That thou should thus humble thy self for a mere worm upon this Altar!

O ye Angels, Saints, and all Creatures! Come help me to honor, praise, bless,
and love my liberal Lord God: who has (as it were) employed his Omnipotency,
in order to my benefit and profit.

Or, by Acts of Thanksgiving.
O Dear Savior! How much have thou done for an unworthy wretch! O the excess
of thy goodness! who can sufficiently acknowledge it? O great Monarch of both
Worlds! That thou should thus humble thy self for a mere worm upon this Altar!

O ye Angels, Saints, and all Creatures! Come help me to honor, praise, bless,
and love my liberal Lord God: who has) as it were) employed his Omnipotency,
in order to my benefit and profit.

Or, by Acts of Resignation.
O Jesu! Since thou art pleased to render thy self here present for my sake: I
here promise a readiness to perform any thing for thy service.

O my God! what will thou have me do? thy Will is the Desire of my heart, the
Delight of my soul, the Design of my intentions, the Drist of my whole life and
being.

O when shall I have no Will but thine! no life but for thy Love! no being but
to be what thou would have me?

Or, by Acts of Self-Oblation.
O My Lord, and my Lover! since thou give thy self wholly to me, I give my
self entirely to thee.

O Savior! Receive me, take me, possess me totally, entirely, eternally,

Or, by Acts of Desire to please him.
O What shall I do, (Dear Lord!) in order to please thee? What do I covet in
this world, but to give thee content?

Were there no Heaven, no Hell, no Reward, no Punishment; It were yet for me a
sufficient honor and happiness to be agreeable to thy Divin Majesty, O my God
and my All!

Or, by Acts of Grief, that He is offended.
AH! my Savior! whence is it then, that so many Souls forsake thy love; since
thou art so lovely and so loving?

Ah! my Dear Jesu! Why did I ever offend thee, since thy ineffable Charity
deserved my reciprocal affection! O wretched, wicked, miserable all they, who
love not Jesus!

Or, by Acts of Desire to Love him.
O Most pure and perfect Lover! who lovedst me from all Eternity! When shall I
begin to pay my love, which is so long since due to thy divin Goodness!

O when shall I truly hate the World, Sin, and my self, for thy love and
service?

Or by Acts of Desire, to see him in his Glory.
O King of Glory! When shall I clearly contemplate thy amiable Countenance, in
thy happy Kingdom?

O Life of my life, and Love of my Soul! when shall I leave this loathsome and
imprisoning Earth, and be admitted into thy lovely Paradise?

At the second Memento.
O Compassionate Creator! take pity upon the poor Souls in Purgatory
(particularly such and such.) And let the same Mercy which has been graciously
pleased to pardon their impieties, mitigate also their punishments: that by the
merits of thy dear Sons death and Passion, (which are here in this holy
Sacrifice most humbly presented to thy Sacred Majesty in their behalf) they may
speedily be translated to that state of glory, for which thou eternally
designedst them.

At the Pater Noster.
Humbly crave such things, as are contained in these Seven Petitions.
1. O Heavenly Father! I most heartily congratulate thy infinite Glory and
Greatness. Give (I beseech thee) the light of thy Faith to all Infidels, and
the grace of thy Love and Charity to all Christians: That thy sacred Name may
be sanctified by all men upon Earth, as it is by all the blessed in Heaven.

2. O Holy, holy, holy Trinity! enter, remain, reign in our hearts, souls,
affections: that we may serve thee, love thee, honor thee upon earth, as thy
Saints do in Heaven.

3. Teach me, (O Lord!) to perform thy Will, [1.] Perfectly, [2.] Purely, [3.]
Promptly, [4.] Perseverantly.

4. O Bread of Life! which descendest from Heaven, to give life to the world!
give thy self to my Soul, that I may live by thee, in thee, for thee, by thy
grace, in thy favor, for thy honor.

5. O liberal Father! For the love of thee, I freely forgive all such as have
any way offended me: and for the love of thy dear Son, I beg forgiveness of all
my own offenses, against thy divin Majesty.

6. Behold, (O my blessed Creator!) how I am on all sides encompassed with
cruel enemies: Lord, I refuse not the combat, since it is thy Will; but I beg
thy gracious assistance, that I may get the victory, and that thou may have
the glory.

7. Deliver me (O All-powerful Lord God!) from all Evil; from all corporal,
spiritual, temporal, eternal miseries: From Sin, from my self, and from
whatsoever displeases thy divin, infinite, amiable, adorable Majesty.

At the first Agnus Dei.
O Sweet Lamb of God, pardon all my Sins: and particularly such and such an
one, wherein I have most grievously and frequently offended.

At the second Agnus Dei.
O Innocent Lamb of God! Implant all Virtues in my Soul: and especially this
and this which I seem most to stand in need of.

At the third Agnus Dei.
O Peaceable, pure, and perfect Lamb of God: Give me peace of Conscience,
purity of heart, perfection of Spirit, etc. and whatsoever will render me most
agreeable to thy divin Majesty.

At Domine non sum dignus.
HUmbling my self in the presence of thy sacred Majesty, (O Sovereign Lord
Jesu!) I adore thy Goodness, Greatness, and Glory; and acknowledge my own
Unworthiness, Baseness, and Nothing.

Whilst the Priest Communicates.
If you are to communicate Sacramentally, these Prayers and Devotions may serve
you for a sufficient Preparation: Howsoever you may communicate Spiritually to
your great profit and merit in all the Masses at which you assist: This
Spiritual Communion consists in these two Points.
1. A Lively Faith of your Saviors Real Presenee in the Sacrament.

2. An Ardent Desire to Receive Him into your Soul, and to be perfectly united
to Him.

O my sweet Savior! the Sovereign Lord of my Heart, and the beloved Object of
my affections! I adore thy sacred Body, Blood, Soul, Divinity, covered under
these Sacramental forms! O that I had all the necessary dispositions of a
worthy Communicant! Do thou only speak the word (O all-powerful Lord God!) and
my Soul shall be saved: Enter (O my beloved Bridegroom!) into this poor
lodging; enrich it with thy infinite perfections; fit it up (as thy self best
knows and pleases) for thy own entertainment.

At the last Prayers.
Render your hearty Thanks to the divin Majesty, for all his Gifts and Benefits.
O My God! my desire is always to praise thee, for thy always continued
favors: But ah! my Frailty, Tepiditie, and Weakness interrupt my desires,
wishes and affections; Make use therefore of thy own goodness (O my gracious
Redeemer!) in supplying my present Defects, pardoning my past negligences,
preserving me from future failings, and praising thy self in me and all thy
Creatures.

At the Priests final Benediction.
O Sweet Jesu! bestow on me this day thy Blessing with this of thy Minister;
preserve me from all sin, and give me perseverance in thy service: That at the
last day of thy dreadful Judgment, I may receive that happy Benediction amongst
thy Elected and Predestined Children, of Venite Benedicti: Come ye Blessed of
my Father, and take possession of the Kingdom, which was prepared for you from
all Eternity.

At the last Gospel of St. John.
This Gospel is always recited in the end of Mass, as containing the sublimest
mysteries of our Faith, and being an abridgment of the mervails hidden in the
holy Trinity. And as those words; Verbum caro factum est, The Word was made
flesh,) Words never enough to be reverenced,) the Priest and People fall down
upon their Knees. And at the end thereof. The last word is Deo gratias, Thanks
be to God, for the aocomplishment of these holy Mysteries.
I Render thee all possible praise and thanks (O Sovereign Creator!) for the
favor I have this day recived of thy bounty, and of which many better
deserving Christians are deprived. Receive (O Lord!) my unworthy prayers,
supply all my defects, pardon all my indevotions, distractions, and
irreverences, and grant that by the strength and virtue of these divin
Mysteries, I may march on cheerfully, courageously, perseverantly in the path
of your Precepts, Love, and Service, a midst all the temptatations, troubles
and dangers of my lives Pilgrimage; till I shall one day happily arrive at thy
holy Mountain, which is thy heavenly Paradise; where with thy blessed Angels
and Saints, I shall more clearly contemplate thee, more perfectly enjoy thee,
and more understandingly celebrate thy infinite Goodness and Mercy, with
uninterrupted Canticles of eternal Praise, Admiration and Gratitude.

. 10. Directions, Devotions, and Entertainments for Sick Persons.
1. What the Sick Party is to do at the beginning of his Infirmity.
1. WHen any Sickness shall sieze upon you, receive it no otherwise than as the
summons of Death; and render most humble and hearty thanks to your heavenly
Father, for giving you this paternal Visitation and timely warning.

2. Though the best disposition to a happy Death, is to have led a holy Life:
yet what soeever your Life: yet what soever your Life has been formerly, you
are now to resolve seriously to spend the short remainder of your time in your
Creators love and service, and in order hereunto.

3. Endeavor to have discreet and devout persons about you: for if ever poor
man has need of faithful friends, it is surely in the time of sickness, and in
the Hour and Agony of his death, when his own Forces fail him, when his
grievous pains oppress him, when his Ghostly Enemies are most busy about him.

4. Above all, strive to have the company of your Confessor at fit seasons:
entreating him to take your soul into his charitable care and consideration, to
entertain you with the continual inculcation of your duty, of your Creators
mercy, of your sins heinousness, and of whatsoever he shall think proper to
dispose you for eternity.

5. Confess and Communicate with all possible fervor, zeal and devotion; and
then rest in peace, hope and confidence; casting all your Sins, Cares and
Fears, together with yur whole self into Christ's open Wounds.

6. Trouble not your mind with an overscrupulous Examination of your
Conscience, or desire so make a general Confession, (especially if you have of
late had a convenient and ordinary care of your duty) for this shows want of
Confidence in your Creators mercy, and your Redeemers merits. Yet if any thing
of moment troubles your mind, and hinder your interior tranquillity, discover
it briefly in Confession, and then remain fully satisfied for the future:
conforming your self quietly patiently and obediently to the Dictamen and
Judgment of your Ghostly Father.

7. Desire your Physician, Friends, and Ghostly Father not to flatter you, but
freely to deliver their sense and opinion concerning the danger of your presons
sickness; that so you may have time to settle your Spiritual and Temporal
affairs.

8. When it shall be told you as it was to Ezechias, Dispose of thy house, and
set all things in order; for thou shall die, and not live: Then (at least)
without delay, fall seriously to the making of a settlement of your four sorts
of Houses. 1. Your Interior House, which is your Conscience. 2. Your Exterior
House, which is the house of your birth, family, parents, kindred, domestics,
and whatsoever concerns your temporal means. 3. Your Inferior House, which is
your Body, wherein your Soul dwells during this mortal life. 4. Your Superior
House, which is Heaven, whither your Soul aspires after this her Pilgrimage.
[1.] The Interior House of your Conscience must be carefully cleansed from all
crimes, adorned with all Virtues, and prepared with the Sacraments of
Confession, Communion, Extreme Unction. [2.] The Exterior House of your Family
must be cared for, by making a clear, pious, and equitable Testament of such
Goods as you possess. [3.] The Inferior House of your body must be provided
for, as to its Burial after your Souls departure. [4.] The Superior House of
Paradise, for which you were created, must finally be cared for: not only by
continual praying for final perseverance, that so you may not lose your hopes
and title to it; but also by perpetually practicing such Acts of Sanctity, as
may increase your merit; and raise you higher and higher in the divin favor,
till the hour of your death.

9. If there be any Restitution commanded, any Alms to be distributed; any
Acts* of Justice or Piety to be performed; delay it not, for fear of Deaths
surprisal: O how many Souls burn in Hell fire for having driven off from time
to time their doing of Penance, their Conversion to God, their Restitution of
ill gotten Goods, their doing of Just Actions!

10. The like is to be said of your being reconciled to your Enemies, if there
be any such occasion; for without perfect Charity, all is lost; and he that
hates his neighbor is a murderer.

11. If your Sickness increases, you must timely ask the Sacrament of Extreme
Unction: which being received with due Devotion and Contrition is of great
virtue and efficacy; remitting all Venial offenses, and cancelling all such
Mortal Crimes as escaped your memory in Confession: yea, and sometimes curing
you of your Corporal Infirmity, according to that of Saint James. Is any one
sick? Let him call for the Priests of the Church to pray over him, and anoint
him with Oil in the name of the Lord, and the Prayer of Faith shall save the
Sick, and our Lord shall raise him up; and if he be in sins, they shall be
forgiven him.

12. Drive out of your fancy, that fond and foolish Opinion of some
ill-grounded Christians, who conceive these holy Ceremonies, (to wit, the
receiving of their Viaticum and extreme Unction) to be a hastening of their
death: no, they prolong your life, if it be for Gods honor and glory; or
prepare you for a better life, which shall last for all Eternity.

13. If there be any person about you which may probably endanger your Quiet,
or trouble your Conscience, or give occasion of new Temptations, by reason of
any past sinful familiarity, or disaffection: endeavor to have him or her
removed: for such Objects may cause you to lose more merit in a moment, than
all the Priests of the world can cause you to gain in your whole life time.

14. If notwithstanding all the moral diligence you have used in making your
Confession, the Devil should suggest any enormous Crime to your memory, as
forgotten, or not sufficiently specified with all its due circumstances,
intending thereby to disquiet your mind, or to drive you into despair: confess
it speedily, humbly, sincerely; which will shame him, and secure your Soul; But
if your weakness, or want of speech permit you not to declare it; excite your
self to an inward act of Contrition, saying in your heart, Jesu pity me, pardon
me, absolve me.

15. Having settled all things as discreetly and diligently as you can, (to wit,
your temporalities by a clear and conscientious Testament, and your Soul by a
sincere Confession, and by a devout receiving of the Sacraments of the
Eucharist and Extreme Unction.) Leave off all other thoughts and employments,
and prepare your self only for a happy Death; and in order hereunto:

16. We should advise you, (as far forth as your time and strength will
permit,) to execute your own Testament; by distributing such Alms as you have
determined to bestow, and performing such acts of Piety as you intended,
without delay: so making your own Eyes the Overseers, and your own Hands the
Executors of your Will; and not to leave all to them who may forget, or
neglect, or perchance refuse to accomplish it.

17. Then make another Spiritual Testament, in some such like manner. [1.] Give
your Soul to God, to serve him, love him, lodge him. [2.] Your Will and Judgment
to your Spiritual Guide. [3.] Your Heart to your Brethren, Assistants,
Attendants. [4.] Your Memory, Understanding, and Spirit, to remember, admire,
and meditate upon your Greators Goodness, and your Redeemers Mercy, etc. [5.]
Your Tongue to pray and praise God, and to speak meekly to your Neighbors.

18. Be as quiet, obedient, and content as you can; O what rare Virtues are
Meekness, Quietness, and Obedience in Sickness, and of how great Edification!
Know therefore that whatsoever hinders your quietness and meekness, are mere
temptations, and come not from God, but from your Ghostly enemy; as to be
troubled that you cannot pray, sleep, eat, keep your Physic, etc. or that you
are so burdensome, chargeable, noisome to others; or, that you are molested with
abominable imaginations, etc. For all these are shadows, and only imaginary
difficulties, to a well settled and resigned Soul.

19. Yet be not so careless, as to addict your self so much to your ease,
extroversion, and recreation, that you forget God and your Soul: nor so
attentive, that you afflict Nature, or increase your disease; but to endeavor
to be as indifferently cheerful, as your frailty will permit.

20. Beware of being overcurious, or delicate in your Diet, over-tender of
your Treaty, or over-solicitous of your Health; Leave all to God with a
Childish simplicity and sincerety: taking him for your Father, Physician, and
Friend, who loves you, sees you, and tokes care of you.

21. Complain little, desire less, refuse nothing, seek not to be moaned: but
being asked, tell truly how you find your self, making no aggravations of what
you suffer, but humbly requesting the Prayers of them that visit you: saying, I
am indeed sick, but Gods Will be done; pray for me.

22. Take all things necessary for your recovery, without any scruple or
repugnancy.

23. Neither praise nor dispraise your self, nor care what others say or judge
of you.

24. Entreat some devout person to read now and then discreetly and distinctly
in some good Book of Resignation and Confidence, and to pray sometimes with you,
for your ease and comfort.

25. Seek not much content from Creatures, or from any Person, or from your
Ghostly Father himself; but place your whole confidence in God your Creator, and
expect your chief comfort from Christ your Redeemer.

26. Communicate as often as your Confessor shall permit, and Confess once a
Week, and that only few things, without anxietie, perplexity, or scrupulositie.

27. Let not the memory of your past offenses, or the doubt of your future
estate, or the feeling of a present impatience in your sickness and sufferings,
afflict your Spirit; much less any representations or images, be they never so
fearful and abominable; which are no more to be valued than as Dreams
proceeding from your Bodies indisposition: for your Heart being solidly
converted to God your Creator, and averted from all that is displeasing to his
Divin Majesty, none of these things can hurt you, but rather give you occasion
of merit.

28. Before or after the receiving of your Viaticum; ask Pardon of the whole
World, of them there present, and of any particular person, whom you conceive
to have hurt, hindered, scandalized, or contristated: saying, For thy sake (O
my Lord and Savior!) I freely forgive all who have any way offended me; and I
humbly beg of all them whom I have any way offended, that for thy sake they
will freely forgive me.

29. During the whole time of your Sickness, you have two things chiefly to do.
[1.] To Suffer. [2.] To Offer: Suffer patiently what you feel, and Offer your
self willingly to suffer more, if it so pleases the divin Majesty.

30. Instead of reflections upon Sin and Hell, fix your mind upon Heaven, and
consider what a happiness it is to love, see, enjoy, please and praise God
eternally in his blessed Paradise: where there will be no more fear, doubt,
temptation nor occasion of offending him: where he will wipe all tears off your
Eyes, sweat off your Brows, blood off your Wounds: where you shall possess
perfect Health and Welfare, true Life and Liberty, full Peace and Plenty for
evermore.

Read over these few points of Instruction, or cause them to be often read unto
you, (during the intervals of your Disease) ponder them seriously, and practice
them devoutly: and be hopefully confident, that if you endeavor to conform
your self in your Sickness to this (or the like) Method, you cannot depart this
life out of Gods grace and favor; but that he will call you to live with
Himself and his holy Angels and Saints in his happy mansion of Eternity.

Then recite with a sincere Devotion this following Prayer.

A Prayer to be said when one first falls Sick.
SIckness, (O my Sovereign Lord God!) is a just punishment of Sin; which
corrupting the Souls integrity, has subjected the Body to misery: And I
acknowledge my Sins to have been so great, that I deserve to suffer a far
greater Misery. I have, (alas! I humbly confess it, and now heartily lament
it,) long abused the Health which your bounty bestowed on me, and employed the
strength was lent me to serve you, to become more powerful in impiety: I have
yielded to my Appetites whatever they desired, and instead of measuring the use
of your Creatures by the rule of Necessity, I have followed the law of
Sensuality: Is it not then most just I should at last lose the goods I so long
abused? Yes, O my Lord! and you deal favorably with your rebellious Servant,
if the pains I now suffer may serve to expiate the future punishments my Sins
have deserved. Give me therefore, O my Gracious Sovereign! the Spirit of
perfect Penance, that I may zealously rise up against my self to revenge your
offended Justice; and that to appease and and satisfy it, I may suffer my
present Sickness, not only with patience, but with pleasure, alacrity, and
gratitude. Strike me, O my God! Scourge me, burn me, wound me, cut me, and kill
my Body, so you pardon my Sins, and spare my Soul in Eternity, In hope of which
happiness, all Sufferings shall seem sweet to me, as proceeding from your
paternal hands; and I here disavow all expressions of complaint, which the
violence of my Disease may hereafter draw from my Tongue, but not from my
Heart; which is wholly resigned to my dear Lord's will and pleasure. Nor will I
care to be informed how long I must lie languishing in this my Infirmity, or
whether Death shall in this battle be defeated, or become victorious over my
life: No, my Lord! I absolutely leave the disposal of my Body, Soul, and all
that concerns me, to thy divin Will and Pleasure; and desire nothing, as to my
life and death, but that the short remainder of my life may be spent in loving
thee, serving thee, and suffering for thee; and that whenever thou shall send
death to cut its thread, my Soul may be found ready prepared for her happy
eternity. In the mean space, it matters not whether I am cherished, or
contristated; I will endeavor to be indifferent to either, since I deserve not
the one, and my Sins render me worthy of the other. Thy innocent Son, O Eternal
Father! who suffered not (as I do) for his own Sins, was deserted by his
Disciples, and even by thy self also: and shall I, after this example, expect
from men any assistance, tenderness and compassion? I only beg of thee, (my
bountiful and compassionate Creator!) some small communication of that Spirit,
wherewith thy patient Son, my sweet Savior, suffered, that so uniting all my
pains to his Passion, they may acquire the dignity, (which their own nature
denies them,) to be acceptable to thy divin Majesty. Whose sacred Name be
praised by me and all creatures for evermore.

Demands to a Sick Person, at the receiving of the Viaticum, or Extreme
Unction; or at other fit times.
1. DO you firmly, heartily, and humbly believe all the Articles of Faith, and
all the Holy Scripture, according to the sense of Catholic Doctors, and
Definitions of the Church?

2. Do you detest all Superstitions, Schisms, and Heresies condemned by the
Church?

3. Are you glad and desirous to die a Member of this true Catholic,
Apostolic, Roman Church; in the Faith taught by our Lord Jesus, and
participation of the holy Sacraments?

4. Do you acknowledge that you have grievously offended God your Creator, who
has been so bountiful unto you; and are you sorry for all your sins,
ingratitudes, negligences, omissions, commissions, lost time and opportunities,
rejected Inspirations.

5. Do you ask pardon of the divin Majesty, and all your Neighbors whom you
have any way offended, disedified, contristated, wronged or scandalized?

6. Does your Sorrow for all these things proceed, not so much for fear of
death, hell, and punishment, as for the offense, displeasure and dishonor of
God, whom you should have loved above all things.

7. Are you fully resolved by Gods grace and assistance, (if you out live this
sickness) to amend your Life, and rather to leave, lose, and suffer any thing,
than to offend God; And do you desire life only to this effect, that you may
better serve him?

8. Do you wish you could love God with as great sincerity, as the blessed
Saints do in Heaven, and as the most perfect Souls do upon Earth?

9. Have you performed such Penance, made such Restitution, done such
Satisfaction to God and Man, as your Confessor has enjoined you; or are you
content and ready to do it?

10. Do you recommend your self to the Prayers of the blessed Virgin Mary, of
your special Patrons, and in particular of your good Angel Guardian?

11. Do you distrust, disavow, and renounce all your own merits, virtues, and
perfections; and trust to be saved by the Mercies of God, and Merits of your
dear Redeemer?

12. Do you render hearty thanks to the divin Majesty for all his favors and
blessings; and especially for that of your Conversion and Vocation to his true
Church and Faith: And also for all the Crosses he has permitted to befall you,
and even for this your present Sickness in which you now languish?

13. Do you absolutely and entirely resign your self to his sacred Will and
Disposition, for all time and eternity: and are you indifferent to Sickness or
Health, to Life or Death, to Comforts or Crosses, and to whatsoever shall be
conformable to the Divin liking and pleasure?

14. If the Devil tempts you in matter of Faith; What will you answer him? I
believe in God and his Church. Or, In matter of Despair? It Is true, I am a
great Sinner, and deserve Hell: yet my Savior is my hope, my pledge, and my
surety; and when God ceases to be good, and Jesus to be my Savior, then will I
cease to hope for Mercy, and not before.

15. But if your Ghostly enemy continues to afflict, affright and terrify you
with the memory of your Sins, Gods Judgments, and Hells torments, what will you
do? I will say, Live Jesus my Lord, and my Love; and I will put his Death and
Passion betwixt me and them all.

16. If through the suggestion of Satan, or any self-frailty, or surprisal, you
should chance to fall and swerve from any of these good purposes and
resolutions? I now declare it to be of no force for evermore: and I will by
Gods grace return speedily to him again.

Other Questions proposed to a Penitent, languishing, and loving Soul, by her
Confessor; to dispose her to a happy Death, with her Answers unto the same; by
way of a Dialogue between God and her. This is proper for more Spiritual
Persons.
GOD. My Child! the last hour of thy mortal life runs now in the Watch of my
divin Providence: This is the moment on which depends thy Eternity; Answer me
therefore heartily, conscionably, and confidently to these points which I shall
here propose unto thee.

Soul. O my God! be thou blessed for evermore, and thy sacred Will be done in
me, and in all thy Creatures: Speak Lord, for thy servant hears attentively,
and will answer sincerely as in thy presence, who penetratest into the secrets
of my heart: And I most humbly beseech thy Divin Majesty, that I may supply by
my inward Will and Desires, what I am unable to express by my outward Words and
Gestures. I confess and acknowledge my imperfection, ignorance and unworthiness
to speak to thee, (My Lord and my Maker!) or to be by thee remembered or
regarded; but hoping in thy gracious assistance, I will humby obey thy commands.

1. Art thou willing to die a Member of my Church, at this Time, in this Place
and Company?

O my God! I desire (even from my very heart) to die a true Child of thy holy
Church, believing all that the said Church teaches, and am ready rather to lose
my life, than leave my Faith: As for all other circumstances of my death, I am
altogether indifferent how, when, and where I shall live or die, so it be in
thy sweet favor and friendship, and according to thy sacred Will and Pleasure.

2. Does not thy Soul covet to be in my custody and love; and to return to me,
her Center, Sanctuary, and place of Rest?

This (O my Lord!) is the earnest suit of thy poor servant; For I well know, I
am safe and secure in thy powerful Custody: and if thou love me, I am sure
to enjoy thee, because thou never leavest them whom thou love. O Rest, long
expected, much desired, and frequently sighed after, when shall I enjoy thee? O
my Creator! Let my soul repose in thee her Center; She was made for thee, and
she will never be truly quiet and content, till she returns to thee, and
becomes united to thee, her final end, and only felicity.

3. Do thou not heartily detest all Sin, all Error, all Inordination of Will
and Affection?

I do, (most gracious Lord!) and whatsoever is any way contrary, or displeasing
to thy Divin Majesty; being desirous to have absolutely no Will at all but
only thine.

4. 1. What will thou have to be thy last Word. 2. Thy last Wound. 3. Thy last
Will. 4. Thy last internal Act of Affection to me?

1. Sweet Jesu receive my soul. 2. Wound me with thy Love, that I may be wholly
thine. 3. I give my self, and all to thee, to whom all is due. 4. I choose thee
for my God, and will be thy Bond slave for ever: I desire nothing either for
time or eternity, but thy only Will: Be thou what thou art, to wit, all
goodness, all glory, all happiness; and let me be what thou will, and as I may
be most pleasing to thee.

5. What is thy Affection toward Creatures? What thy Aversion from them? Art
thou truly content to leave all, and to be left by all?

I cannot perceive (O my God!) that I am averted from any reasonable Creature,
though I often feel my self upon light occasions moved with displeasure against
some of thy servants, (whose feet I am not worthy to kiss;) yet I now; even
with all my heart, wish to them Happiness in this life, and eternal felicity in
the next.

Neither do I envy any ones prosperity in any thing whatsoever; but humbly
beseech thee, (my sweet Jesu!) if it be for thy own honor and glory, to bestow
more favors, and greater blessings upon all thy Creatures: And this I most
heartily crave for those especially with whom I have had, or shall hereafter
have any difficulty, and whom my nature is least inclined to affect

Whatsoever inordinate affection I ever had, or now have, either to my self, or
any created object, I do here, in thy adorable presence, disavow and utterly
renounce; converting my whole heart and love to thy Sacred Majesty; and
desiring to honor and affect all thy Creatures in thee, and for thee only.

I am content (O my God and All!) to leave all, and that all should leave and
abandon me: only permit me to live under the shadow of thy wings, and to have
thee always present with me.

6. Wherein do thou most trust and confide in dying?

O my Creator! In thy infinite Mercy, and in the Merits of my sweet Redeemer,
Christ Jesus, is all my Hope and Confidence: And I humbly present this
unspeakable Treasure, (I mean the Death and Passion of my Lord Jesus,) before
the Throne of thy Justice, (O my dread Sovereign!) as also the Merits and
Intercessions of the immaculate Virgin Mary, and of all thy glorious Saints.
Lo, (my Lord!) this is all my Trust, Comfort and Confidence; here is all my
Hope, Riches and Treasure; and in this I will rejoice for ever; For of my self,
I am miserable, wretched, wicked, having nothing in my Soul to adorn it, or
render it grateful to thy immense purity and infinite Goodness.

7. (1.) Have thou not greatly offended me? (2.) Does it not much grieve thee?
(3.) If thou could recall it, would thou do it? (4.) Would thou Confess
all again, and that in Public, if it were my will? (5.) What do thou offer
in Satisfaction? (6.) What Penance art thou content to undertake? (7.) Will thou ask Pardon for all thy Scandals? (8.) If all hearts were thine, as they
are mine, how would thou dispose of them?

1. O most merciful Father! I confess I have most grievously offended thy
gracious goodness, and that I have often deserved Hells eternal punishments:
but thy Mercy has spared me till this present, to the end I may become
converted and live: Be thou ever blessed and praised by me, and all creatures
for evermore. 2. I am sorry and grieved to my very soul, that I have offended
so good a God; and that there has been so great a dissimilitude in my Soul
with thee, according to whose sacred image it was created. 3. Pardon me (O
compassionate Father!) pardon your now repenting, returning, converted Child:
for could I recall, undo, and cancel all the evil I have ever thought, done, or
said, I would surely do it, though the difficulty cost me my Life. 4. And I
would most readily re-confess all my Sins, (though they are very many, and
monstrous) in the presence and hearing of the whole world, if I understood by
thy Deputy, my Ghostly Father, that it were thy will and pleasure. 5. O my
God! If thou demandest Satisfaction from me, which way shall I turn me? I will
run to my sweet Jesus, and present thee with the precious merits of his most
holy and painful Life, and of his most cruel and shameful Death, in full
satisfaction for all my offenses. 6. As for Penance, Behold my weak Body, and
languishing Soul, inflict upon them what punishment thou please; only spare
me for Eternity. 7. I beseech thee, (O my ever blessed Creator!) by the Passion
of thy Son Jesus, to pardon all the evil Example, notorious Scandal, and bad
Counsel which I ever gave to any person: And I heartily ask pardon of all them,
who have received any harm by me, either in body or soul; humbly begging of
thee, Sweet Jesu! to forgive and wash away in thy precious Blood, all those
spots, which by my fault they have incurred. 8. O the only beloved of my Soul!
had I the disposing of all hearts, I would most freely bestow them all on thee:
nor would I permit them to be employed so much as one moment of time in any
other exercise, than in loving, praising, and magnifying thy sacred Majesty.

8. Do thou nor ardently desire to Love me, to See me, to Enjoy me, and to
Please and Praise me, as my blessed Angels and Saints do in Heaven?

O my Lord! I desire above all things, 1. To love thee, for thy own sake,
because thou art most worthy to be beloved. 2. I long and languish to see and
enjoy thy beatifying countenance; but my own unworthiness tells me, it is an
over high Presumption, therefore I humbly resign my self to thy holy Will. 3.
Yet, (O gracious Creator!) fain I would praise and please thee as those happy
Choristers do in Heaven.

9. (1.) Why art thou afraid to die? (2.) Did not I die for thee? (3.) And wilt
not thou die for me? O my dear Sovereign! When I reflect upon my sinful life, I
tremble at deaths memory and approach: But (O dear Jesu!) when I consider thy
infinite merits and mercies, I am comforted, I become confident, and I remain
content to die whenever it shall be thy good pleasure, because thou being my
God, sufferedst Death to give me eternal Life.

10. How long art thou content to ly languishing in Sickness, and after death
to remain punished in Purgatory?

Even as long as it shall please thee, (my Lord and Lover!) for in Sickness, in
Death, and after death I wholly resign and abandon my self to thy sacred Will
and Disposition.

11. 1. Have I not been bountiful, liberal, and loving to thee? 2. Have thou
well requited this my love and liberality? 3. What thanks do thou give me? 4.
At least what do I deserve from thee?

O my Lord! Thy Liberality, Mercy, Goodness, and Love to me, (thy most
ungrateful Vassal,) has been excessive, immense, unmeasurable: and alas! I
have never requited the least of thy benefits by any faithful service, fervent
affection, or sincere gratitude.

But now, (O my Royal Benefactor!) behold I here 1. render thee all the humble
thanks, benedictions, and praises I am able. 2. I heartily wish it were in my
power to praise, honor and love thee with that purity, fervor and affection,
as thou deservest, and I desire. 3. Since I know my self to be altogether
incapable to pay what I owe thee; therefore I beseech thee to pay thy self out
of thy own infinite stock of mercy, and thy Sons immense treasure of merits. 4.
Thy self (O my Soverain Lord God!) is thy own praises, and this I offer up unto
thy divin Majesty.

12. How much did I suffer on the Cross? 2. For whom? 3. What moved me to it?
4. What did I thirst after in dying, and crying Sitio? 5. Compare thy pains
with mine; is there any proportion? 6. Will not all this move thee to suffer a
little Sickness and Death for me?

O my dear Redeemer! I am not able to conceive, much less to express the dismal
torments thou enduredst at thy Death. 2. Yet I know, it was all to Redeem
Sinners, and my self in particular. 3. And the only motive was the great
affection thou had to save my soul, that I might Love, Praise, and Enjoy thee
eternally. 4. I believe thy Thirst was after my love and salvation; 5. And I
wish that mine may be after thy only Love and Honor. 6. In thanksgiving for
all which thy love, favors and benefits; and because thou art my God, I
absolutely resign my self to suffer and die, when, how, and where it shall
please thy divin Majesty.

13. But what if thou art not of the number of my Elect? and that out of my
severe Justice I should send thee into Hell fires?

O my God! I remit my self wholly to thee: and were I assured of that fearful
Separation from thee, yet I would still endeavor to love thee, serve thee, and
adhere to thee, during this my pilgrimage on earth, with all possible
diligence, sincerity and fidelity.

14. Do thou not much desire in dying, to have the fruit of the Sacraments,
and the presence and Prayers of thy Ghostly Father, and of my holy Church?

This (O my dear Lord!) is my most hearty desire: but I prefer thy blessed Will
before both, I care not how suddenly Death may seize on me, so it finds me not
unprovided.

All this (which is by me spoken and answered to my Lord and Savior, with
perfect use of Sense and Judgment) I will by his divin Grace never revoke or
deny; where and howsoever I lead and end my life.

Of all which, I take for witness my Lord God himself, (in whose presence I am)
and the whole Court of Heaven; humbly offering up these my desires, intentions,
and resolutions, to the Throne of the divin mercy, to be there ratified,
confirmed, and perfected by the merits of my dear Redeemer Christ Jesus, and by
the intercessions of his and my blessed Mother Mary; and heartily begging the
assistance of the whole Church, both Militant and Triumphant, for the full and
perfect performance thereof.

Blessed be my God for ever. Amen.

Protestations to be made by the Sick Person; either Vocally, if he be able, or
else Mentally, being distinctly read and suggested unto him.
In the Name of the Blessed Trinity; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
I N. wretched and miserable sinner, do Protest before Almighty God, (who sees
the secrets and sincerity of my heart) before you my good Angel, and all the
Court of Heaven; and also before you my Ghostly Father, and Friends here
present:

1. That I have a firm, constant, and settled will and desire to die in the true
Catholic Faith and Church, wherein all the Saints are departed: understanding
and believing all the Articles of my Faith in that sense and meaning, which my
holy Mother the Catholic Church, the Spouse of Christ, and Pillar of truth,
has, and does propose them to be understood and believed.

2. Also I protest, that I do with all my heart and soul detest all the sins of
my life past, humbly beg pardon for all my Commissions against God, my
Neighbor, my self, in Thought, Word, and Deed; and for all my Omissions in
observing the precepts of God and his Church, (the Rule and Constitutions of my
Profession,) the works of mercy either spiritual or corporal; as also for
having abused the Sacraments, refused Gods grace, rejected his inspirations,
neglected his vocations, been careless in the custody of my heart and senses,
scandalous in my life and manners, tepid in tending to perfection; and
generally for all my sins, scandals, disedifications; and for whatsoever I have
any way offended my Creators divin Majesty and goodness. Humbly beseeching him
by his own infinite Mercy, by the Merits of my dear Savior Christ Jesus, by the
Intercession of the powerful Virgin Mary, and by the Prayers of all the Angels
and Saints, that he will be pleased to supply all the defects of my Sacramental
Confessions; and that now at last he will furnish me with grace and strength to
produce this one Act of true and sincere Contrition; O my God! be merciful unto
me a Sinner; In the pronunciation whereof, I could be content my heart would
break asunder with grief and sorrow, for having offended so infinitely amiable a
Lord and Lover.

3. Also I protest, that I do heartily forgive all such as have ever any way
offended, hurt, or injured me; and that I most humbly crave pardon of all them
whom I have any way knowingly, or ignorantly offended, hurt, injured in words,
in deeds, or by my bad example: offering my self ready to make them full and
ample satisfaction to the utmost of my power.

4. Also I protest, that I am altogether incapable to render worthy thanks to
the divin Majesty, for his infinite favors, blessings, and benefits, from time
to time, in general, and in particular, bestowed upon me his undeserving,
unworthy, and ungrateful Servant; wherefore I do beseech the blessed Virgin, my
Powerful Mother and Patroness, and all the celestial Citizens, to supply this
my defect with their more perfect acts of perpetual praises and thanksgivings.
O that I had now as many tongues and hearts, as there are creatures in the
Universe, stars in Heaven, sands in the Sea, atoms in the Air! how willingly
would I employ them all in my Creators and Redeemers praises for evermore; I
likewise render most hearty thanks to all such as have conferred any corporal or
spiritual benefit upon me, and to such as have instructed, admonished,
corrected me; to all such as have and shall help, assist, and comfort me in
this my Sickness; beseeching the divin Goodness, to give them eternal rewards
for their Christian and Charitable endeavors.

5. Also I protest, that by Gods grace, I will die free from all Despair and
doubt of the divin Mercy: For though my sins are many and enormous, yet I know
my Creator is more ready to show mercy, than I am to demand it: and that one
drop of his dear Sons precious Blood shed upon the Cross, is abundantly
sufficient to redeem me and all mankind; since therefore all that is required
on my part, consists in bringing a fit disposition to receive his Grace and
Mercy: and that I have at this present, a firm desire to dispose my self
accordingly, and to serve him, love him, honor him for the time to come, with
all possible fervor, sincerity and fidelity; I will cheerfully, confidently,
resignedly, remit all to his sacred Will and Providence.

6. Also I protest, that if through fear, faint-heartedness, want of judgment,
extremity of pain, or any other accident or occasion whatsoever: I should fall
(which God of his infinite mercy forbid) into any such doubt or despair, or into
any thought, word or action, displeasing to my dearly beloved, and ever
honored Lord and Maker: I do now at this present, being in full and perfect
sense, utterly renounce it, recall it, reject it.

7. Also I protest, that if (the divin Providence so permitting,) I should have
any wicked temptation (of whatsoever kind and nature) suggested unto me by my
sworn enemy, during the whole time of this my Infirmity, or in my last Agony: I
will not yield the least assent thereunto, either tacitly, or expressly, either
by signs, or by gestures: and I do now for then revoke, annul, and abhor any
such thoughts, temptations and suggestions, being desirous and resolved to
adhere only to God my Creator, so long as any breath shall remain in my body,
and to be faithful to Him even till my last Gasp,

8. Also I protest, that (since my good God has promised to give his grace to
all such as do what lies in them to get it, and that his gate of mercy is never
shut against an humble and contrite Soul:) I do confidently hope, and hopefully
desire, and desirously expect to have both Grace in this world, and Glory in
the next, by the merits of my blessed Saviors bitter Passion, and by his holy
Mothers and Saints powerful Intercession; whose Prayers I beg, whose happiness
I congratulate, whose perfections I emulate, and to whom I do now for the hour
of my death most humbly supplicate, that they will then obtain for me a lively
Faith, a constant Hope, an ardent Charity, a courageous Fortitude, a profound
Humility, an invincible Patience, and all such other Virtues, as will then be
most necessary for me: saying to them (now for then) with heart and mouth.

O all you glorious Angels and Saints of Heaven; especially you, O sacred
Virgin, Mother of Jesus, and you my particular Patrons N. and N. and you my
good Angel! intercede for me in that dreadful hour, that I may depart this
World in my Creators grace and favor.

9. Also I protest, that though the weakness of my nature be so great, that I
even abhor suffering; yet in Spirit I embrace this Cross, this Sickness, these
Pains, as tokens and pledges of the divin favor and affection: and do submit
my self to live and die, and suffer, in what measure and manner shall be most
conformable to his holy pleasure and honor.

10. Lastly, I commend my Soul to God my Creator, who made it of nothing: to
Christ my Savior, who redeemed it with his Blood: to the Holy Ghost, who
espoused it to himself, and sanctified it in Baptism: protesting, that when in
my last Agony, I shall be unable to employ my tongue any longer in praying and
praising the divin Majesty, I desire still in mind to be firmly united unto
him: offering (now for then) my Agony, my Sweats, my Sufferings, to be joined
and united to the bitter Agony, bloody Sweatings, and dolorous Sufferings of my
dying Savior Christ Jesus, for the remission of my Sins, and for his eternal
glory: whose holy Name be sanctified, whose praises be celebrated, whose Will
be performed in Earth, as it is in Heaven, by me, and all creatures for
evermore.

Exercises for the time of Sickness,
THE best and easiest Exercise for a Sick Person, is a frequent repetition of
pious, and fervent Ejaculations, Acts, Aspirations, and Elevations of his Soul
to God, be they never so short, plain, and simple: let him therefore make use
of some of these Acts following, relishing them silently in his Heart, or
sweetly breathing them forth of his Mouth, without any violence, or over
binding himself to long attention.
Acts of Contrition.
O Sovereign Goodness! how it grieves me to have offended thee! were I again to
act over my life, upon the Earths Theater, how warily would I walk in your
presence. O my Lord! I utterly detest all my past Sins, and humbly acknowledge
that I justly deserve these present pains and punishments; but O spare me for
Eternity.

Let him frequently (during the time of his Sickness) make this short Act
following of true Contrition.

O my God! For thine own sake whom I love above all things, and because Sin is
most displeasing to thy divin Majesty, I heartily detest all my impieties,
humbly demand thy Pardon, and promise to amend all that is amiss.

2. Acts of Faith.
I Believe, Lord! and neither doubt, nor dispute of any thing that thou have
revealed, and thy Church defined; If I err in my Belief, (O Blessed Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost) thy self have deceived me, who have confirmed my Faith by
so many wonders and miracles, which could be wrought by none, but thy self: and
since all deceit is far from thee, surely all error is far from me.

I believe Lord! help my unbelief.

I believe that thou art most just, and that thou have all right to chastise me
with this present sickness.

I believe that thou art infinitely powerful, and can cure or kill at thy
pleasure.

I believe that thou art soveraignly Merciful; and that thou will pardon my
Sins, protect me from my Ghostly enemies, and bring me to thy self, by such
means, in such manner, and at such time, as is most pleasing to thy own divin
will and liking.

3. Acts of Hope and Confidence.
O My God! the only desired of my Soul! I most heartily confess and acknowledge,
that thou have provided for me in so convenient a manner, both in prosperity
and adversity, in health and sickness, in body and soul: as no other wisdom,
but thou only (my sweet Lord and Maker! the increated Goodness, and wise
Disposer of all things!) could have effected.

To thee therefore, (O my God and my All!) I commit my self and all to be
disposed of now and ever, as shall be most agreeable to thy own honor and
glory, and most conformable to thy eternal, just, and equal will and providence.

I hope, (O my Sovereign Lord God!) that this moment of pains and sufferings,
will be soon changed into an Eternity of happiness and comfort.

I trust that my now languishing and dying body, shall be one day raised to
glory, impassibility, immortality.

I cheerfully expect to have this poor imprisoned soul of mine, called up to
see, enjoy, and contemplate thy amiable and beautifying countenance for
evermore.

4. Acts of Love.
O Eternal Father! thou have given thy Son to me; and behold I give him again
to thee, together with my whole self, and all that I have, am, and can; my Love,
my Life, my Liberty, my Heart, my Soul, to please and honor thee for all
future time and Eternity.

O my Lord! I love thee heartily: and (during the short remainder of my life in
this world) I will serve thee faithfully; not so much of obligation, as of
Election; not so much for my own comfort and profit, as for thy will and
pleasure; not for the delight I take in thy loving service, but for the desire
I have to please thee: not as a servant, bondslave, or hireling, but as a
Freeman loves his Friend, as a Child his Father, as a Spouse her Bridegroom:
not only out of gratitude for received benefits, but also and chiefly because
thou art my God of infinite perfection in thy self, and of infinite affection
toward me.

O God of Love, and Love of my Soul! what do I desire in Heaven, or expect from
Heaven; and what do I long for upon Earth; but thee the only object of my
affections, the only aim of my pretensions, the only desire of my heart, the
only delight of my spirit!

Come, O my blessed Lord and Lover! and take full possession of my Heart and
Soul: transform me into thy love, and conform me to thy Will. Let thy Will be
the only desire of my heart, and let thy Love be the only life of my Soul, and
lease of my life; that when I leave to love, I may cease to live, etc.

5. Acts of Resignation.
Take examples from CHRIST in his Agony.
O My All powerful Father! If I must needs drink of this bitter chalice,
(endure this long and tedious Sickness, suffer these sharp and severe
torments,) thy holy Will be done.

From Job on his Dunghill.
It Is thou (O Sovereign Lord!) who art the bountiful bestower of all blessings,
and thou may justly withdraw, revoke, and retake them at thy own will and
pleasure; be thou blessed and praised for evermore.

From S. Paul, prostrate on the ground.
LOrd! What will thou have me to do? what is thy holy pleasure? behold thy
Servant ready to accomplish it.

Aspire frequently to God, and Resign up all willingly to him, in this or the
like sort.
WEre I master of all Bodies and Souls, I would presently give up to thee,
(Great Lord of Heaven and Earth!) all my right and title; and were it in my
power, I would make of each body an instrument to please and praise thee, and
of all souls as many Paradises to lodge and love thee.

Come what will, (O my Creator!) I will place my hopes in thy infinite mercy,
and in thy Sons abundant Redemption: And my perpetual Song shall be, O Lord be
merciful to me a Sinner! Blessed be my God for all, and in all: Live Jesus, by
whose death I live, and for whose love I am willing to die, etc.

O when shall I take as much pleasure in suffering, as I have done in sinning!
O that I could entirely resign my whole self, Body and Soul, in Life or Death,
for time and eternity, to be disposed of according to thy divin Will and
Pleasure?

O that I could in every moment of time pronounce with heart and tongue, Live
Jesus only, whose Will be accomplished, whose name be sanctified, whose praise
be published in all, by all, above all, etc.

6. An Act of Purity of Intention.
O Eternal Lord God! Thou have created me to serve thee only, redeemed me to
love thee only, and now inspired me with a will and desire to please thee only,
during all the remaining days of my life: And behold, my hearty and humble
desire is to serve thee, love thee, and please thee purely, perfectly,
perseverantly.

Reform therefore, I beseech thee my sinful life, conform my stubborn will,
Deiform my sinister intention, change and transform my spirit into thine; that
all my thoughts, words, actions, pretensions, and these my present pains,
sufferings, and sickness, may be presented to thy sacred Majesty with such
purity, perfection and perseverance, as thy Love deserves from me, and mine
desires for thee.

7. An Heroic Act of highest efficacy; containing a Contract between the Soul
and her Creator: Which being made devoutly at the beginning of any dangerous
Sickness, and frequently iterated during the intervals thereof, must needs
afford exceeding great comfort in Deaths last hour and Agony.
O My God, my Lord, my Creator! from whom, by whom, and in whom, I and all
things live, move, and have a being! I rejoice at what thou art, as if it were
all mine; and I offer what I and all creatures have and are, as being all thine.

Behold, (O Heavenly Father!) I thy poor Child and unworthy Creature, do here
with all possible sincerity, submission, and devotion, make this present
Contract with thy Sacred Majesty, to be thy faithful servant and bondslave for
evermore; intending hereby that each remaining moment of my life, and all that
is within me, without me, about me, may henceforth incessantly bless and praise
thy holy Name, and accomplish thy most just and holy Will in all things
whatsoever.

And for this end, I do now enrol this Oblation, Donation, and Resignation of
my whole self to thy divin Majesty, in the very Center of my Heart and Soul;
with such Intention, Force, and Efficacy, as thou (O my all-knowing Lord God!)
can comprehend to be the very best, which I thy poor creature am capable to
perform, without any reservation, restriction, or contradiction whatsoever. I
desire also, (O my Creator!) to make this Contract with thy sacred Majesty, in
the best manner, with most proper words, in the fittest terms, and with such
significant clauses and conditions, as it ought and may be performed.

In Confirmation whereof, I produce as witnesses, the sacred Virgin, Queen
Mary, my Angel Guardian, my particular Patrons, and all the celestial Citizens,
humbly imploring the assistance of their Prayers, for the performance of this
my hearty Oblation of my whole self purely and entirely to thy divin Majesty,
which I beseech thy infinite goodness and mercy to receive from my Hands and
Heart, and to seal it in Heaven, that it may be there warranted and confirmed
for evermore.

And because the necessities, frailties and infirmities which accompany this my
Pilgrimage, (and which will probably most of all overwhelm me in deaths Agony)
permit me not (according to my desire) to be always employed in thy praises:
therefore I now prostrating my self before thy Throne of Majesty; whom I
reverently Adore with the greatest Affection that thou (O my Lord God!) know
may be given by any creature; and to whom I Offer, in supply of my own
unworthiness, all the ardent affections, mental excesses, supernatural
jubilations, and amorous unions of all devout Souls in Heaven and Earth, (as
though I felt them all in my own heart) humbly express this my present
Covenant, Contract, and Agreement with thee, my Sovereign Creator, Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, in this manner:

That as often as I shall, either Interiourly or Exteriourly, either in Heart
silently, or with my Tongue verbally, think or say any of these things
following,

I Adore, I Thank, I Offer, I Resolve, I am Sorry, I Desire, I Resign, I
Believe, I Hope, I Love, O my Lord, O my Jesu! And so passing no further shall
there end: My intention is, to make as perfect an Act of Adoration,
Thanksgiving, Oblation, Resolution, Contrition, Petition, Resignation, Faith,
Hope and Charity, as is possible for any creature to make.

And I do now for then declare, denounce and testify, that my will and desire
is, (whenever I shall think or pronounce any of the words aforesaid) to make,
exercise, and perform all the Acts contained in this Book; in all the devout
Books that ever were, or shall be written; and which the blessed Virgin,
Angels, and Saints do, and shall do in Heaven, for all eternity.

Receive and ratify (most gracious Sovereign!) this my humble Act, Contract,
and Covenant, as to all and each one of its branches and members, and
whatsoever is therein explicitly and implicitly included: receive it as a pledge
of my hearty desire to serve, praise and honor thy divin Majesty, purely,
perfectly, eternally. Receive it once for all, which I wish to present unto
thee every moment and minute, to produce as often as I breath, and to iterate
as frequently as any Act can possibly be repeated and multiplied And I invite
and conjure all the celestial Spirits and faithful Souls, to sacrifice unto thy
sacred Majesty more perfect holocausts of praise and benediction for evermore.

In this manner, a pious Soul may incessantly praise and please God; and with
little labor acquire much merit: For having once sincerely made, (and daily,
weekly, or monthly repeating) this Act, according as it is here largly
described; it may hourly be practiced with great ease and comfort, by the mere
direction of the mind, and simple reflection of the spirit toward God; upon
all occasions, and in whatsoever company and employment.
OF all other Devotions, the use of a Crucifix is chiefly to be recommended to
a Sick Person: Kissing it, Embracing it, speaking sometimes to the Crucifix,
sometimes to his own Soul. Nothing is more easy, nothing more pious, nothing
more profitable: For in the contemplation of that Sacred object, you may with
great facility adore, praise, bless, thank, invoke the divin Majesty, and
admire his infinite mercy, love and liberality; in this or the like manner, as
his Holy Spirit shall suggest unto you.
O holy Cross! O deep Wounds! O sacred Blood! O cruel Sorrow! Dear Lord, at how
dear a rate have thou bought me? O sweet Jesu! be unto me a Jesus! Let not the
Soul perish, which cost thee so great a price! Destroy not thy own workmanship!
Lose not thy own labor, pains, and passion.

O Jesu! Thou art my Friend, and my Physician: my Lord and my Love: my Portion
and my Possession: my Peace and my Patience: my Light in Darkness; my Health in
Sickness; my Comfort in Sadness; my Plenty in Want; my Life in Death; my Heaven
in Purgatory; my God and my All, for Time and Eternity.

A larger Exercise in Contemplation of the Crucifix. Fixing your Eyes upon the
Crucifix, or taking it reverently into your hands, and humbly embracing it,
with an ardent desire to honor, imitate, and conform your self, as far forth
as God shall enable you to the last thoughts, words, and affections of your
dying Savior: Read (or cause to be read) this following Exercise, leisurely,
distinctly, and devoutly; ruminating upon each point, and relishing every
aspiration and affection.
The first Consideration.
ALl Christ's Actions are our Instructions; and as his Life is the prime
exemplar of holy living, so his Death is the perfect pattern of happy dying;
which he exhorts all Christians to imitate, saying; Take up your Cross and
follow me.
O My Soul! how ill have we imitated our sweet Savior in our life, manners,
and conversation? Let Us (at least) strive to imitate him in his death; by
taking patiently this present Cross, which he lays upon our shoulders, and
following him cheerfully to Mount Calvary.

O Jesu! my Redeemer, and the worlds Savior! how happy are they, who are
enabled by thy Grace to imitate thy Virtues; who desire to live only for thee,
and are ready to die with thee; who live in thy friendship, and die in thy
favor.

O glorious Son of God! Thou were Incarnated and Crucified for my ungrateful
Soul: O that I might be mart^r'd and crucified for thy sake; to the end I might
be conform-able to thee in dying, though I have been so unlike to thee in
living.

O my dear Savior! though my Soul is not forced out of my body by such a
violent death as thine; yet imprint in it, I beseech thee, such sweet thoughts
and affections, as thou felt'st when thou diedst for my sake.

The Second Consideration.
JESUS died willingly, patiently, resignedly.
O My God! Give me health or sickness, give me life or death, give me
whatsoever thou please; not my will, but thine be done.

O Jesu! By virtue of thy perfect Resignation to the divin Will, strengthen
mine in Deaths Agony. Behold, I bind my self to that blessed conformity of
thine to thy heavenly Father; and in union thereof; I most willingly embrace
the design thou have over me, be it for life or for death.

O my Savior! Thou being Gods innocent Son, diedst in the flower of thine age:
and shall I desire long life who am a sinner, a rebel, a criminal? I yield,
Lord! I yield, and submit to Deaths summons. Farewell Earth: farewell world;
farewell this Vale of tears and miseries! Heaven is my happier home; Paradise is
much more pleasant and agreeable; and Death is my way to it.

The Third Consideration.
JESUS prayed for strength, succor and courage in his Deaths Agony.
O My Eternal Lord and Lover! Behold thy poor child encompassed with miseries
and calamities on every side, knowing not what to choose or desire, but only
the accomplishment of thy most just Will! O forget not thy creature in his
greatest necessity.

Thou art graciously pleased (O compassionate Creator!) to take pity upon the
fowls of the Air, and beasts of the Earth, and to succor them in time of their
need: O refuse not thy favors to a Soul stamped with thy sacred image and
resemblance, but pity me, succor me, comfort me, and protect me from the hands
and power of my Enemies.

Ah! my Jesu! my glass is almost run out, my senses fail me, my strength
decays, my breath is almost spent? O do not thou forsake me, (dear Jesu!) when
all things else shall leave and abandon me.

The Fourth Consideration.
JESUS dying wept for my Sins, and prayed to his Father for their pardon.
O My Soul! Shall thy Savior alone be sensible of thy sinful condition, and
remainest thou insensible of thine own? O Jesu! I will surely weep as well as
thou; and O that my Heart could cleave in pieces with sorrow for all my
impieties.

O my God! It grieves me to have offended thee: thee, being what thou art, an
infinite, essential, immense goodness! Ah! wretch that I was! were I again to
begin my life, how differently would I lead it from what I have done?

I have grievously sinned against thee, my good God, I humbly acknowledge it,
heartily crave thy pardon, and hopefully offer up to thy Throne of Mercy the
tears, prayers, and sufferings of thy beloved Son, my sweet Savior Jesus, for
a supply of my want of Sorrow and Contrition.

The Fifth Consideration.
JESUS dying, pardoned his Enemies, loved them, prayed for them.
O Jesu my Savior! In honor of this thy fervent Charity, I freely forgive all
them who have ever offended me in my whole life time.

It now heartily grieves me that I ever hated them: and were they here present,
how humbly would I embrace them, and beg their pardon?

Give them (O my God!) thy Grace in this world, and thy Glory in the next.

The Sixth Consideration.
JESUS amidst his cruel sufferings, and in deaths Agony, conformed himself
absolutely to his Fathers Will.
O Jesu! I desire not to be freed from my pains; but to be furnished with
patience to endure them as long as thy Providence shall be pleased to prolong
them.

I wish neither health nor sickness, neither life nor death; but all I aim at
in time and eternity is the full accomplishment of thy most just and holy Will:
choosing rather to obey thee, than to be exempt from suffering. Is it thy divin
pleasure I shall lie thus languishing till Doomsday? O my Lord! it is also my
will and pleasure: Will thou, that I die presently? O my God! I most willingly
accept it, even at this instant.

O eternal Father! ever blessed and praised be thy sweet Name and Providence,
for all the sufferings, sicknesses, calamities I ever endured since I had a
being: Receive them (O Lord!) together with these afflictions I now feel, and
those I shall feel at the departing of my Soul out of my body, (which I humbly
unite to them of my dear Savior dying on the Cross,) for the expiation of my
crimes, and in satisfaction for all my impieties.

The seventh Consideration.
JESUS dying, Looked upon, and discoursed with his sacred Mother, and S. John.
O Incomparable, Powerful and Compassionate Virgin! Mother of Jesus, Mother of
Mercy, Mother of power, Mother of all mankind, and my Mother, by my particular
choice and election! I now humbly and earnestly call and cry unto thee, to
deliver me (by thy prayers and patronage) from my dreadful enemy, to obtain
for me pardon and Remission of my sins, and to assist me in my last passage,
conflict, and agony.

O ye heavenly Spirits, and holy Saints! Noble Angels, Glorious Apostles,
Triumphant Martyrs, Sacred Doctors, and Confessors, Pious Widows, and Pure
Virgins! who securely possess that happiness to which my heart and soul
incessantly aspire: Intercede for me, that I may also be with you a happy
sharer and partaker.

O Blessed Saint N.! whose name I received at my Birth, and in my Baptism: Let
me receive thy succor at my Death, and in my Agony,

O my good Angel Guardian, my honored Prince and Protector! Be pleased to
assist now thy poor feeble and fainting Pupil: Stand by me, O valiant Champion!
fight for me, and defend me from the fury of my now most busy Enemy, and
conduct my departing soul to its eternally prepared habitation.

The Eighth Consideration.
JESUS dying (with Head humbly inclined) adored the Sacred Trinity.
O Adorable Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! Sacred Deity! Undivided Trinity! Thou
art my Creator, and I am thy creature; Thou art my Lord, and I thy servant;
thou art my dread Sovereign; and I thy Victim and Sacrifice, consecrated to thy
only Majesty: Thou have all absolute power and dominion over me, and I have no
power of my self.

I humbly Adore thy divine Greatness, Power, and Sovereignty, and heartily
Confess my own Weakness, Poverty, Nothing.

Alas! How strangely have I hitherto forgotten, mistaken, misunderstood the
world, my self, and all sublunary things? My eyes are now opened, and I
perceive my self to be a poor, wretched, dying Creature.

The Ninth Consideration.
JESUS died in an Ecstasy of divine Love.
AH, my God! Though I have not lived in thy Love; yet, let me (at least) die in
it. O that I might breathe out my Soul in an Ecstasy of sacred Love; and that
my last sigh in this world, might be an ardent Act of pure, perfect, and
extatical affection!

Live my Lord Jesus! Ever happy, ever triumphant, ever glorious, in thy own
divin Essence, Attributes, Perfections!

O my God, and my All! Nothing more but thy self! Ah when shall my languishing
Soul see thee, embrace thee, enjoy thee? When shall my whole employment be to
praise thee, love thee, be united to thee, uninterruptedly, incessantly,
eternally!

The Tenth Consideration.
JESUS dying, recommends and resigns his Soul into the hands of his heavenly
Father.
INto thy hands, O my Lord! I also recommend my spirit: Thou (O heavenly
Father!) art its first beginning, and O, let it sweetly return to thee, as its
final end and only felicity! I am all thine (O my merciful Creator!) by all
manner of titles; and behold I give my self to thee in all manner of ways: O do
not now reject me, but receive me, possess me, and take me totally to thy self
for evermore.

O how it now grieves me, to have given my Soul to any other than thy self, (O
my Sovereign Lord and Lover!) to whom it only appertains?

Oh! how earnestly does my Soul desire to be dissolved, that it may come to
thee, (my sweet Savior!) Yet not my Will but thine be done, in this and all
things whatsoever! Let it be (Lord Jesus!) how, where, and when thou shall be
best pleased!

When the sick Person feels his strength begin to decay, let him commend his
Soul to his Creator in these following ancient Prayers of the Churh.
O My Sovereign Lord God, whose mercy is infinite! O glorious Trinity, Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, who art Goodness it self! Have mercy on me, a miserable
sinner. O most loving father! take pity on thy poor Child, and forsake me not
in this my last and greatest need.

O sweet Savior Jesu, Son of the living God! I beseech thee by the virtue of
thy most blessed and bitter Passion, grant me thy Grace, give me a pardon of my
sins, and vouchsafe me a portion of thy Glory: I challenge not (dear Lord!) a
place in thy Heaven, for any worthiness of my own merits; for alas! I am but
dust and ashes: but for thy Passion's sake, whereby thou were pleased to redeem
me miserable man, and to purchase Heaven for me, at the price of thy precious
Blood. I beseech thee therefore, O Jesu my Savior! by thy sufferings on the
Cross for me, especially at that hour when thy blessed Soul left thy Body,
have mercy on my poor Soul at the time of her departure.

When he draws nearer his end, he is chiefly to make use of short and pithy
Aspirations of Love, Desire, etc. As for Example.
O My Lord! I love thee, I love thee, and I wish I could love thee more.

As the fainting Heart desires the refreshing Fountains, so does my Soul thirst
after thee my Savior.

I thirst, Lord! and thou only can quench my thirst.

Lead my poor Soul, (O my all powerful Creator!) out of this loathsome prison;
that it may love and praise thee for evermore.

O beautiful Jerusalem! my happy home! when shall I come to live and lodge in
thee?

O ye blessed Quires of Saints and Angels! who perfectly enjoy God, and
unweariedly intone his Eternal praises! when shall I come to love and land my
dear Lord with you?

O Sacred Virgin Mary! Mother of power, pity and compassion! Be thou now to me
a Mother, and take care of thy weak child.

O my glorious Patrons! be pleased now to remember me, to assist me, to pray
for me.

O my good Angel! pity me, protect me, comfort me, strengthen me in this hour
of my Agony.

Take courage, my poor Soul! take courage; Eternity comes on, our misery and
sorrow will soon have an end, and our peace and plenty is beginning without end.

Frequent these in the time of your Health, that they may occur easily to your
memory in the time of your Sickness: And then ruminate them sweetly, quietly,
and discreetly, according as your Soul shall relish them without violence,
eagerness, or anxiety.
An Exercise of holy Dying, consisting of four Acts.
FOur things are requisite to die well: 1. A Spiritual Death to all creatures.
Strive then (O my Soul!) to deny thy self in all things, and to die to thy self,
and to the whole world in love and affection, that thou may live to God
only, who alone can comfort thee in Dying, and content thee after Death. Thou will find it no trouble to leave, what thou do not inordinatly love. And what
is it thou so love? find it out, and forsake it; leaving that and all, to
find one and all; and aspiring often: What do I hope for in Heaven and what do
I look for upon Earth? O my God and my All! be thou all mine, and let me be all
thine; and let all other things go which way they will

2. A cordial and profound humility. This gives the greatest Grace to the
living, and Comfort to the dying. Proud spirits are always in extremes: either
they die blindly presumptuous, or Death opening their eyes, they fall into
despair at the sight of their miserable estate. O my Soul! humble thy self,
since thou have nothing to be proud of; for alas! what were thou before thy
late receiving of a being? What have thou which proceeds not from thy Creators
bounty? Why then art thou proud of it, as if it were thine own? What have thou
received, which thou have not abused? What sinful Soul would not have been a
Saint, had it received such favors as thou have misimployed, and buried? How
long ere this might thou have most justly been hurried headlong into
Hellfire, for thy pride and impiety; since the damned spirits, who there are
and shall be eternally tormented, sinned once only in Pride, and thou so often;
since they had something to be proud of, and thou nothing; since their sin was
only in thought, and thine also in word and work? O my God! I acknowledge Hell
to be my Center, and the place which is proper for the entertainment of so
perverse a wretch; and should thou send me thither, thou art Just, and
righteous are thy Judgments.

3. A firm Confidence in God. Let not Humility hinder your Confidence in the
divine mercy and goodness; for by this token, it will be easily known to be
false and ill grounded. Yet trust not in your own merits, good works, good
life, good will: but [1.] in the infinite goodness and mercy of God. [2.] in the
abundant Merits and Redemption of Jesus. [3.] in his sweet promises of pardon
and protection. [4.] in the prayers and patronage of your Mother of Power, and
particular Patrons. [5.] in the custody of your good Angel. [6.] in the
participation and union you have with the Church Militant and Triumphant. And,
(O my soul!) is not this enough? Lord! I am thine, I trust in thy mercy, and if
thou killest me, yet I will still hope in thee.

4. An entire Resignation to the divine will and disposition in all things for
time and Eternity. O my Soul! this is the Act of acts at the dreadful hour of
Death; and, O my Lord! I offer up my self to endure all pains, disgraces, and
desolations in this life; and to suffer all punishments in Purgatory, and in
Hell it self (if thy Justice will have it so) in the next life: not reflecting
what shall become of me, either in this my Sickness, or in my Life, or after my
Death, but leaving all to thy sacred Will and sweet Disposal.

When the sick person is in his last Agony.
The Priest, or Charitable assistants, should suggest unto him some of these
devout words, thoughts, and considerations.
1. TAke Courage, (Dear Christian Brotheo, or Sister! suffer patiently for a
little while, that you may be happy for all Eternity.

2. Christ Jesus dyed for you, and be you content to dye for him.

3. Though your Sins are great, yet greater is Gods mercy.

4. Though your, Tongue is put to silence, yet let your Heart speak
affectionatly to your sweet Savior. O Jesu! thy will be done. O my Lord! I
love thee, I adore thee, I thank thee, etc. And I beseech thee, (O my merciful
Creator!) that every sigh, every thought, every eye cast up to heaven, may be
acceptable to thy sacred Majesty, according to that irrevocable covenant,
contract, and intention, which I formerly made, and here humbly renew, in thy
divine presence.

When the Agony is of long continuance, it may be very profitable, comfortable,
and convenient, to read over the Passion of our Savior, or some passages
thereof so it be done, 1. Discreetly, without troubling or disturbing the sick
person. 2. Distinctly, not in an over high tone, loud voice, or eager
precipitation 3 Devoutly, to move his affection. 4. Deliberately, and with
certain pauses and interruptions; staying upon such points and passages, as may
touch, pierce, and comfort him, As for example:
ARe you desirous (my dear Brother!) to entertain your departing Soul with the
memory of your dying Redeemer? Lift up then your Heart sweetly and quietly to
your Savior, whilst I shall recite what he did, said, and suffered for your
sake.

The Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to S. Luke.

With desire I have desired to eat this Pasch with you, before I suffer. Mark
these ardent and affectionate expressions of your dear Redeemer: He has still
for you the same love and desire; and his Will is, that you shall celebrate
this Pasch with him eternally in his happy Paradise.

This is my body which I give for you: If your blessed Savior, has given you
his Body, give yours to him, and be content in your sufferings.

I prepare for you a Kingdom, that you may eat at my Table. O comfortable
sentence! It Is for you that this Kingdom is prepared! Pass to it cheerfully,
courageously, confidently.

O my Lord! I am ready to accompany you into Prison, and unto Death. O the
admirable courage of St. Peter! say you the same, and you will die resignedly.

Pray, that you may not enter into temptation. Reflect upon these words: and
since this is a time of temptation; elevate to God your Heart, that you may be
delivered.

He prayed on bended Knees. Behold a rare example: Do you imitate it in desire
and affection, and permit not your spirit to be born down with the sufferings
of your body.

O Father! If you please, let this Chalice pass away from me; yet not my Will,
but yours be done. O how comfortably should you repeat this prayer of your
agonizing Savior? Speak it in your Heart, and unite your thoughts to those of
your sweet Jesus.

Being in his Agony, he prayed more ardently. Behold Jesus in the same
condition with your self. Pray then, pray heartily, ardently, perseverantly.

And his Sweat became like drops of blood, trickling down upon the earth. This
bloody Sweat will wash away your Sins, sweeten your Pains, and smooth your
passage to Eternity.

Judas came up to Jesus, and Jesus kissed him. Comfort your self in Christ's
kissing Judas: Ah! shall not you hope to obtain his kiss of peace in Heaven,
since you die in quality of his faithful friend and favorite?

Jesus looked back upon Peter, after he had denied him. O sweet words! and can
you doubt but that Jesus beholds you, lying now upon your Deathbed, humbly
adoring him, heartily confessing him, and ardently loving him?

These and the like devout and pithy Reflection: and Applications may be made
upon the reading of the Passion: which surely cannot but afford much comfort to
the agonizing person, and edification to the assistants.
Holding the Crucifix before him.
ADore your dear Savior, dying on the Cross for you: and trust in his infinite
merits and mercies.

Kiss these sacred Wounds, hide your self in these holes of the Rock; and rest
here secure against all your enemies deceits and stratagems.

Offer up the death of JESUS to his eternal Father; and desire that yours being
thereto united, may become pleasing to his divin Majesty.

Say with the Publican; O my God! be merciful to me a Sinner.

Cry out with the Blind man, O Jesu! thou Son of David, take pity upon me.

Profess your Faith with S. Thomas, O my Lord and my God.

Animate your Hope to say with me: I hope I shall soon see Him in Heaven, whom
I now contemplate fastened to the Cross.

Excite your Charity with S. Paul: I desire to be dissolved, and to be with
Christ.

Address your self to the Eternal Father, with the words of dying Jesus: O my
Father! into your hands I commend my Spirit.

When the sick Person draws so near toward his Death, that no further
Applications can be made to him, let the devout Assistants charitably pray for
him, in this or the like manner:
O Most compassionat Jesu! Take pity upon him.

O Jesu! the Redeemer, Lover, and Life of Christian Souls: Have mercy upon him.

O Jesu! the sweet Comforter of all desolate and distressed Sinners: Comfort,
encourage, and strengthen him.

O holy Mary! the Refuge of Sinners: Pray for him.

O Mother of Mercy! Mother of Grace! Mother of Jesus! Mother of Power! Pity
him, protect him, defend him, assist him, in this his greatest extremity.

O glorious Saint Joseph, the nursing Father of Jesus, and Virginal Spouse of
the Virgin Mary, Pray for him.

O Angelical Spirit! who have been hitherto his faithful Guardian! Do not now
abandon him, but conduct his soul to its prepared place of eternal rest and
happiness.

O all ye holy Saints and Angels! and you St N. his special Patron, receive him
into your happy company.

O Jesu! be you unto him a Jesus, and save him.

A Prayer to God the Father.
O Father of Mercies, and God of all Comfort! we most humbly address our
petitions to the Throne of thy divine Clemency, in the behalf of this our
languishing Brother; beseeching thee by the immensity of thy Mercy, and by the
infinity of thy Sons merits, to pardon his sins, to mitigate his pains, to arm
him with patience, to furnish him with perseverance in thy Grace and Love, till
his last Gasp, and then to receive his departing Soul into thy paternal care
and protection.

A Prayer to Christ Jesus.
O Lord Jesu Christ! who were mercifully pleased to suffer an ignominious death
upon the Cross, for the Redemption and Salvation of Mankind; we most humbly
beseech thee, to interpose the Sweat of thy Agony, and the Blood of thy
Passion, between the severe Justice of thy Eternal Father, and the grievous
Sins and offenses, of this thy poor servant: And deliver him in this hour of
his Death from all such pains and punishments, as he may fear to have justly
deserved.

A Prayer to the Blessed Virgin.
O Sacred Mother of Jesus; By that sword of sorrow which pierced thy tender
Heart, when thou stoodest by thy dear Son hanging on the Cross, heardst him
uttering his last Words, and beheldst him giving up his Ghost: We beseech thee,
to assist also this thy dying Child with thy Prayers, whom his Brother Jesus
recommended then and there to thy peculiar care and custody, saying; O Woman
behold thy Son. Turn thy Eyes of pity and compassion toward him, (O Blessed
Mother!) in this his extreme misery and affliction; and leave him not in this
his last and greatest necessity; O clement, O pious, O sweet Virgin Mary.

When the Agonizing person is ready to expire.
DEpart, O Christian Soul! Depart in peace out of this world; In the name of
God the Father who Created thee; In the name of God the Son, who Redeemed thee;
In the name of God the Holy Ghost, who espoused thee; In the name of the
Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominations, Principalities, Powers, Cherubins,
and Seraphins; In the name of the Patriarks, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs,
Confessors, Monks, Heremites, Virgins, Widows, and all the Saints of Paradise.
Let thy place be this day in peace, and thy habitation in the holy Sion.

O God of infinite Goodness, Clemency, and Sweetness! who art graciously
pleased, (out of the greatness of thy Mercy) to pardon repentant Sinners:
Behold this thy poor creature, with the Eyes of thy wonted pity and compassion,
and grant him the general pardon, which he most heartily desires, and we most
humbly beg for him. O Lord! redress the losses, repair the breaches, remit the
offenses, which he has contracted through human frailty, or diabolical
temptation, and let this Member, for whom thou have mercifully spilt thy sacred
Blood, be happily united to the body of thy holy Church.

We recommend you (our dear Brother, or Sister!) to Almighty God, and remit you
to his care and custody, whose creature you are: hoping, that when you shall
have paid to nature the Tribute of Death, you shall return to him who is the
Author of your Life. And we most humbly and heartily beseech his Divin
Majesty, that at the instant of your Souls departure out of its imprisoning
body, the heavenly Quires of Angels may receive it; the holy College of
Apostles may meet it; the triumphant Martyrs may accompany it; the glorious
Confessors, Virgins, Widows, and all the celestial Citizens, may joyfully
conduct it to the happy vision and fruition of sweet Jesus in his eternal
Kingdom.

O Divine Jesu! The Lord of our lives, and the love of our Souls! We beseech
thee by that ardent Charity which moved thee to become man for us: By the price
of thy Blood which thou pouredst forth for us: and by the merits of thy Death
and Passion which thou enduredst for us; that thou will be graciously pleased
to let thy goodness, mercy, and pity appear in the person of this thy poor
servant, who is now summoned to leave this world and to come before thee, his
dread Judge and Sovereign: Dispose his Soul (Dear Jesu!) and prepare it for this
great trial: Suffer it not to quit its Body without a true and hearty
contrition for its Sins, and a faithful and filial conversion to thee its
Savior. Visit him, clear him, and comfort him with that efficacious grace,
wherewith thou art wont to purify, justify, and sanctify repentant Sinners.
Deal with him in mercy (O sweet Redeemer!) as thou did with the good Thief;
and encourage his languishing heart with the like cheering words, This day thou
shall be with me in Paradise.

At the very time (as near as may be guessed) of the souls departure out of the
body, say, Subvenite Sancti Dei, etc. As in the Roman Ritual.

XI. Some devout Prayers for the Souls departed.
A Prayer to God the Father, for the Soul newly departed.
O Eternal Father! whose nature is goodness, and whose work is mercy! cast thy
compassionate Eyes upon the poor Soul of this our departed Brother or Sister N.
[or, upon the poor Souls, suffering in Purgatory:] and remembering it to be thy
own creature, redress its miseries, remit its punishments, release it from its
imprisonment.

Receive (O gracious Sovereign,) the superabundant sufferings of thy Son Jesus,
for a full satisfaction of thy divine Justice: and for his dear sake, pardon
this thy poor servants past impieties, forget his frailties, and cancel all his
omissions, commissions, and ingratitudes.

I humbly acknowledge (Great Lord of Heaven and Earth!) that if thou look
only upon his deserts, he must needs be a long time the object of thy severe
Anger and Rigor; but if in Mercy thou will be pleased to look upon Jesus his
Redeemer, and to apply to him the merits of his bitter Death and Passion, thou will soon free him from all his miseries, and bring him to the enjoyment of thy
eternal Felicity.

O my God! That I were capable to satisfy thy Divine Justice, in the behalf of
this poor Soul, for whom I now petition thy, Mercy: how willingly would I exact
in my own person, that which detains him in Purgatory! And though my
unworthiness may hinder this desired effect, yet such is thy Goodness, (O my
gracious Sovereign!) as that I may hope to have my will accepted, my petition
granted, and this poor Soul pardoned, succored, delivered, and speedily
admitted to praise, love, and honor thy sacred Majesty, with the rest of thy
celestial Citizens for evermore.

To Christ Jesus.
O Jesu! the Savior of our Souls, whose inclination to do good to poor
Mankind, is so great, that thou often pressest him to ask, and promisest to
grant his petitions: Receive I beseech thee this Prayer, which I most humbly
present to thy Throne of Mercy, in behalf of [this my departed Brother, or
Sister] the Souls suffering in Purgatory.

Remember, (O most compassionate Redeemer!) that it is a Thing bought with thy
Blood, designed to thy Glory, intended to be a Co heir with thee in thy
heavenly Kingdom. Look upon it, (sweet Jesu!) as the noble conquest of thy
Cross, and the sacred Trophee, by thy powertorn out of the Devils clutches; and
as such a thing, afford it some solace in its sufferings, and free it from
those flames, fetters, and prisons, which hinder it from enjoying that Glory,
whereunto thy Mercy has predestined it, which thy Passion has purchased,
and which thy Goodness has prepared for it.

If the tears of Mary and Martha did so pierce thy tender Heart; that they
obtained the raising of their dead Brother Lazarus out of his Sepulcher: Be not
less favorable and flexible (O dear Savior!) to these my sighs, tears, and
prayers, which I now pour forth before thee, for the Soul of my departed
Brother (or Sister.) Speak only the word, (O all powerful Redeemer!) N. come
forth of those Flames; and Purgatory will render thee a most prompt Obedience,
and the delivered Soul will eternally magnify thy Mercies.

To the glorious Virgin Mother.
I Most humbly salute thee, Great Queen of Heaven and Earth, Glorious Mother of
JESUS, Powerful Advocatrix of Mankind, and compassionate Comfort of the
afflicted! These blessed Titles embolden me thy unworthy servant, to beg thy
prayers for the poor Soul [of my departed Brother,] now suffering (as I
probably both fear and hope,) in the place of Purgatory; and to petition thee,
that thou will be pleased to employ the Power, the Privilege, and the
Friendship thou have with thy dear Son my Savior, in his behalf, and for his
release, comfort and pardon.

O Great and Glorious Virgin Mother! Consider this suffering Soul, as by thy
Son redeemed, and by thy self beloved; and since thou have interest in the
salvation and joy of the Souls purchased with the price of thy Sons precious
Blood; take pity upon this Soul, longing to behold thy Son and thy self in
Glory, and to sing forth Divine praises with the blessed Saints for all
eternity.

To S. Joseph.
O Faithful Steward of Gods sacred Family! Worthy Guardian of Jesus and Mary!
Great and Glorious S. Joseph! Permit me to make my most humble addresses to
thee, in behalf of this poor Soul, suffering in the flames of Purgatory. It
burns with an ardent desire to enjoy God, and to behold thee in thy heavenly
Glory; but the Decree of divine Justice, detains it from this desired
happiness; be thou therefore pleased, O Just man! to interpose thy pious
intercession for the cancelling, or (at least) for the moderation of this
severe Edict.

Thou formerly freedst Jesus and Mary, from Herod's cruelty; free now this Child
of Jesus and Mary, from the pains of Purgatory, and obtain for him a speedy
deliverance, that he may with thee and thy dear Spouse Mary, praise, honor,
and enjoy Jesus for all eternity.

The Sequens of Holy Church, usually said in the Masses for the Dead.
Dies Irae, dies illa, etc. 1. THat Day of Wrath, that dreadful Day
Shall all the World in Ashes lay:
As David and Sybilla say.
2. How shall poor Mortals quake with fears,
When their impartial Judge appears
Who all their Causes strictly hears!
3. His Trumpet sounds a dreadful tone,
The noise through all the Graves is blown
And calls the Dead before his Throne.
4. Nature and Death shall stand at gaze,
When Creatures shall their Bodies raise,
And answer for their forespent Days.
5. The fair-writ Book of Conscience shown,
Sins black Indictment shall be known,
And every Soul it is Guilt shall own.
6. So, when the Judge shall sit on high,
All hidden Sins shall open ly
No Crime shall from due Vengeance fly.
7. What Plea shall wretched I pretend?
What Patron move to stand my Friend?
When scarce the Just themselves defend.
8. O dreadful God and glorious King!
Who do the saved freely bring
To Bliss; save me, O Mercies Spring.
9. Pious Jesu! call to mind,
Thy Travels, for my good designed,
Grant I may that day Mercy find.
10. Thou sat'st down weary seeking me,
Thou climbd'st the Cross, my Soul to free,
Let not such Labors fruitless be.
11. Dread Judge! whose Justice is severe,
My long black score of Sin make clear,
E're the accounting Day appear.
12. I, as a guilty Person, groan;
My faults are in my Blushes known;
Pity, dear Lord, thy Suppliants moan.
13. Thy granting Magdalen relief,
And opening Heaven to the Thief,
Has with sweet Hopes allayed my grief.
14. My worthless Prayers deserve no hire;
But thou, mild Lord, thy Grace inspire,
And save me from eternal Fire.
15. Amongst thy Sheep grant I may stand
Far from the Goats accursed band,
Securely placed at thy Right Hand.
16. The taitif Troop being put to shame,
And pent in Hells n'ere dying flame,
Amongst the Blessed enrol my Name.
17. With bended Knee I make my Prayer,
And Heart contrite as Ashes are,
Of my last End, dear Lord, take care.
18. That Day of Doom, that Day of Tears,
When guilty Man awakes in Fears,
From Dust; and fore his Judge appears:
19. Jesu! whose Breast our woes condoles.
Preserve him from Hells burning Coaks,
Give rest to all departed Souls. Amen.
XII. A most devout Exercise of Confession and Communion, applied to the Souls
suffering in Purgatory.
When your Charity toward your departed Brethren and Friends, shall invite
you, (O pious Christian!) to apply the fruit of your Communion in their favor:
You may do well to entertain your self during that whole day, (set apart for
that holy purpose,) in such acts, exercises, and thoughts, as are proper for
that subject: As for example:
At your awaking in the Morning.
Imagine you hear those poor, restless, and afflicted Souls, making their moan
to you, and exciting you with their ordinary complaints; ( Miseremini,
miseremini, saltem vos Amici! O Friends! take compassion upon us! And do you
answer them with a Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine, and lux perpetua luceat
eis. O my God! who have mercifully given me rest this night, and light this
morning; give eternal rest, and eternal light to these poor souls.

Being clothed, and placed on your knees to Adore the Divine Majesty, you may
thus pour forth your heart before him.
O Sacred Trinity! I here most humbly prostrate my self, and these poor Souls
in thy presence; Offering up for them to the Throne of thy mercy, all my this
days Actions and Devotions: and particularly my Confession, Communion, and the
Indulgence, which through thy Mercy, I hope to obtain: uniting them to the
merits of my dear Redeemer, of his blessed Mother, and of all the glorious
Saints of Heaven: And beseeching thy infinite goodness to accept of these my
weak and unworthy endeavors, for satisfaction of their punishments, for solace
of their sufferings, and for their speedy admission to thy beatifying presence.

Going to Confession.
Imagine [1.] That the Sacrament of Penance is the Purgatory of this world,
where thou art to cleanse thy Soul by the Fire of Contrition, and Flames of
Charity, not only from its Sins, but also (in some measure) from the
Punishments which by its Sins it has deserved: that being thus pardoned and
purified, it may be more capable to assist those Souls which suffer in the
Purgatory of the other world. [2.] That if it so pleased the Divine goodness,
as to lend one hour of time to the Souls in Purgatory, wherein they might merit
and do Penance: how zealously would they make use of this blessed Remedy? how
sincerely would they Confess their Sins? how faithfully would they perform
their Duty? [3.] That many poor Souls suffer now most severe punishments in
Purgatory, (and even in Hell it self,) for one only Sin: and what does thy self
deserve for so many? or what must thou expect, unless thou endeavourest to make
some timely satisfaction during this life?

Returning from Confession.
[1.] ADmire the Divine favor, mercy, and goodness in your behalf: which is so
great, that had he don the like to the damned, before their departure out of
this world, they had been all Saints in Paradise. [2.] Perform your enjoined
Penance, humbly, punctually, and with an ardent desire to satisfy the divine
Justice for your offenses.

Hearing Mass.
1. AT the Entrance of the Priest to the Altar. Think how all Purgatory begins
to rejoice, in expectation of the fruits of this great Sacrifice. Join your
Heart, Affection, and Intention with his; Offering up with him the same
Sacrifice, in memory of Christ's Passion; in Thanksgiving for his favor
conferred upon the Souls of Purgatory, in that they departed this life in his
Grace and Love; and in satisfaction for the punishment due to their sins.

At the Confiteor.
FOrm an Act of hearty Contrition; and weigh how highly it grieves the faithful
Souls departed, that they ever offended the divin Goodness.

At the Kyrie-eleison.
CRy out for Mercy in their behalf, by the same repeated petitions to the
sacred Trinity.

At Gloria in excelsis.
O My God! That these poor Souls were now also conforted with thy Angelical
Quires, to chaunt forth with them these happy Canticles of thy eternal Glory.

At Credo.
MAke a profession of your Faith; protesting you will never swerve one tittle
from that belief wherein all the Saints and Souls in Purgatory departed.

At the Offertory.
REnew your Oblation, intention, petition, for their succor, solace
deliverance.

At Sanctus.
NOt only the Angels and Saints of the Church Triumphant, but also the souls of
the Church suffering, intone this glorious Trisagion: With whom I most humbly
Adore, Praise, and Magnify thy sacred Name, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of
Sabbath. O increated, ineffable, eternal Sanctity! Increase this day the
number of thy heavenly Quiristers. Let Heaven and Earth be full of thy Glory:
Heaven receiving new inhabitants; Earth procuring for them this happiness.
Osanna; O that the same Song might now Echo forth at their entrance into
Paradise, as it did at my Saviors entrance into Jerusalem.

At the Elevation of the Sacred Host.
O Eternal Father! Look upon thy beloved Son Jesus; and for his dear sake, take
compassion upon the poor Souls, for whom we petition thee.

At the Elevation of the Chalice.
O Merciful Creator! Let fall one small drop of this precious Blood upon
Purgatory, to quench its ardors, and comfort those distressed souls, for whom
it was spilt upon the Cross.

At the Memento for the Dead.
O My Lord! Look in mercy on the souls 1. Of my Parents, Kindred, Friends,
Benefactors. 2. Of such a particular person, N. 3. Of such as have been most
charitable in praying for the departed. 4. Of such as are left uncomforted,
unremembred, unpray'd for. 5. Of such as suffer most, or who should (according
to thy Justice,) remain longest in their torments. 6. Of such as are in the
first and next place to be released. 7. Of such as lastly entered. 8. Of such as
most loved Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. 9. Of such as suffer there, upon my
occasion. 10. Of them, to whom thou shall be pleased to apply this my
Communion. 11. Of my own Soul, as if it were already departed out of my Body;
humbly entreating thee (dear Jesu!) by the Water and Blood which gushed forth
of thy wounded side, and heart, in thy Passion; to pity me at this present, and
to permit me to advance here the payment for such punishments, as I should
hereafter pay in Purgatory.

At the Pater Noster.
REpeat it with the Priest, as a most efficacious Prayer to obtain succor for
the Souls suffering in Purgatory.

At the Communion.
MAke such Acts and Affections, as are most savoury to your spiritual gust; and
most beneficial to the Souls, for whom you intend the fruit of your Communion:
As for example,

An Act of Faith.
I Firmly believe, that I here receive my dear Savior Chrst Jesus: Who both
can and will give me the effect of this sacred Communion, which is, eternal
life; and not only to my self, but also to those poor suffering Souls, for whom
I intend it.

An Act of Hope.
O What good things do I hope to receive by this present Communion? I hope for
my Self, I hope for these Souls; and I hope for no less than God himself and
his everlasting life, love, and glory.

An Act of Love.
I Love thee, (O infinitely amiable Goodness!) And I desire that these Souls may
speedily be translated to the fruition of thy beatifying presence, that they
may love thee more perfectly for all Eternity.

An Act of good Intention.
I Approach now to this blessed Banquet (O my God!) to glorify thy sacred
Name, to unite my self to thy divin Goodness, to render the merits of thy
Passion efficacious, both for my own Soul, and for theirs to whom I humbly
apply the fruit thereof.

In Communicating.
SAy for your self and them; Into thy hands (O Lord!) I commend my Spirit! O
how sweet will my Purgatory seem unto me, being thus placed in thy sacred
hands. O Jesu, my life and my love! Let me live and die in thee; and when thou
descendest into my Soul, let the effects of thy goodness descend also into the
prisons of thy Justice, to deliver those faithful Souls, who desire nothing
more than to see thee, love thee, and praise thee with thy Saints and Angels in
thy eternal Glory.

After Communion.
AMongst all the Acts of Devotion you produce, (and which are elsewhere
prescribed;) be still mindful of the Souls in Purgatory; as for example:
Adoring your Dear Savior, seated now in the midst of your Soul; do it (as it
were) in their company; saying, If thou love me, (sweet Jesu!) as I cannot
doubt but thou do; love also those poor Souls, and bestow upon them such good
things, as thy love designs for me, etc. Thanking him, say: O my dear Savior!
Let these Souls also praise thee with me in their Prison, and be admitted
speedily to praise thee more perfectly in thy Paradise. Petitioning him, say;

O My Lord! I beg for my Self a holy life, and a happy death: And I beg for
those Souls, an application of thy Merits and Passion, and the effect of this
Plenary Indulgence, which I hope to have this day gained, and which I here most
humbly offer up in their behalf to thy Sacred Majesty.

At the end of Mass.
REceiving the Priests blessing; pray unto the holy Trinity, that he will be
pleased to bless these suffering Souls, created to his Image and designed for
his Glory: and say, Almighty God bless you, The Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost. Amen.

During the remaining time of the Day.
LEt all the Objects which oocur, all the Actions you do, and all the
Employments you undertake, serve you as so many Memorials to mind you of your
own Death, and of theirs, who are gone before you. As for example: Entering into
your Chamber. Think of the dismal Dungeon, wherein those poor Souls are (by
their Creators just Judgment) detained. Seeing the Fire. Reflect upon their
Flames. Eating and Drinking. Remember the bread of Tears, which is their only
food and nourishment. Conversing with others. Consider they have none but cruel
Devils for their ordinary Companions. Washing your Hands. Think how this flesh
of yours must shortly become the food of Worms, and the subject of corruption.
Hearing the Clock strike; say for them, Requiescant in pace: for your self,
Eternity is at hand.

Briefly, let all the objects of your Senses serve you for as many Images of
your Death: The Sun you behold, the Air you breath, the Celestial Orbs you
admire, may fitly put you in mind of the darkness of Purgatory, of the splendour
of Paradise, of the glory of Heaven; whereof your poor suffering Friends are
yet deprived.

Let your Jaculatory Prayers of this day, be either concerning theirs or your
own Purgatory; O Lord! give rest to the departed, O Jesu, the God of my heart,
the desired of my soul, the object of my affections, the end of my pretensions!
Grant I may live in thy Grace, and die in thy Favor.

If your leisure permits; you may imitate this easy and efficacious devotion
of some pious persons; saying a pair of Bedes for your departed friends, in
this manner:

Take your Ordinary Rosary, and forming your Intention; Begin with a Creed;
Then say, Our Father upon each of the great Grains; and upon each one of the
lesser Grains, say; Pie Jesu Domine, dona eis Requiem. Amen. (that is,) O
compassionate Lord Jesu! give the^ rest. Amen.

In the Evening.
HAving examined your Conscience; endeavor to produce a most fervent Act of
Contrition, as if in that night you were to depart out of this world. And go to
Bed as to your Grave; saying; Ah! the Vanity of all worldly riches,
greatnesses, and glories! You must shortly be included in two yards of earth!
etc. Into thy hands, O Lord! I commend my Spirit, etc.

Two excellent profits, which all pious Christians may draw, from this
charitable practice of praying for the Souls in Purgatory.
The first profit is; That remembering these departed Souls, they can hardly
forget their own approaching Death: and consequently will be moved to make some
timely preparation for that great action, whereupon depends their whole
Eternity.
THe practice hereof may be reduced to these two Points.

First, Question your self in this sort: Were I now presently to depart this
world upon deaths Summons: am I in a condition to appear before Gods Judgment
Seat? What do thou answer, (O my soul!) what could thou wish to have done?
Fall forthwith to settle thy self, and all that concerns thee in order to thy
Death; and never cease till thou can say with S. Paul, Nihil mihi conscius
sum: Through Gods goodness, I find no guilt in my Conscience: My heart cannot
upbraid me of any horrid crime, which I have not endeavored to deface by
Contrition, to discover in Confession, to do penance for by Satisfaction: My
soul detests all that is opposite to the love and will of my Lord Jesus.

Secondly, Habituate your self in the Exercise of such Acts, as you would and
should practice in the article of your Death: Taking therefore your Crucifix in
your hand; say: Well! I must dye: but when? where? how? in what estate,
circumstance, and condition? All this is uncertain, I accept therefore, (O my
Creator!) the Decree of my death, as from thy divine Justice; and the
Uncertaintie of its execution, from thy eternal Providence: Behold, I am ready
and willing to obey thy blessed Ordinances, nor do I desire to live one moment
longer, than is according to thy most just will and liking.

I protest that I will live and dye in an absolute conformity to the Catholic
Faith; because thou, my Lord God, (who art the prime and essential Truth,) have
taught and revealed it.

I Hope in the infinity of thy goodness; in the fidelity of thy promises, in
the immensity of my Saviors merits: Though thou killest me, O my Lord, yet I
will hope in thy Mercy.

I will die in thy Love, that I may love thee (O abyssal Ocean of all Love and
perfection!) for evermore. Yes (my Lord and my Love!) I could heartily wish
that an Act of Seraphical Love might separate my Soul from my Body, that so it
might become happily united to thee, (its only beloved object) for all Eternity.

It grieves me, (O my God!) that I ever offended thee; because thou art
infinitely good: and I am content to die; because I would be freed from all
future occasions of offending thee. Wherefore I here offer thee my life, as a
pledge of my Love; and I accept of Death, as a fit punishment of my offenses.

O when will that desired day come, in which I shall see thee (my sweet
Savior!) face to face without any interposition; love thee without any
interruption; praise thee without any imperfection?

I acknowledge, that Purgatory is too pleasant a place for the chastisement of
my impieties; and were I adjudg'd thither till the last day of general doom, I
were most mercifully dealt withal: yet (O my Creator!) to the end I may make a
more honorable satisfaction to thy sacred Justice, by the merits of my sweet
Savior; I will endeavor to gain all the Indulgences whereof any one is
capable in the Article of Death; and in particular that which is obtained by
pronouncing then the holy Name of Jesus; which I desire may be the last word of
my Mouth, the last motion of my Heart, the last sigh in my Soul. O Dear Jesu!
Let my last breath echo forth, Jesu, Jesu, Jesu, Amen.

O Blessed Virgin Mary! mother of Mercy, mother of Power, mother of Jesus:
Behold thy poor child, and present my departing Soul to thy dear Son Jesus.

O glorious S. Joseph! who expiredst in the sweet embraces of Jesus and Mary;
Obtain for me, that I may die in their favor and affection.

O my good Angel! the faithful Guardian of my Life, leave me not in the
dangerous moment of my Death.

End this Exercise with a generous Resolution to Die daily to your self, to the
world, and to all things: and to Live as you desire to Die.
THe Second Profit is: That considering the grievous pains they suffer; you
will easily resolve to endure your Purgatory in this world: which was the
ardent desire of S. Augustine; when he thus petitioned the divine Majesty: Purge
me (O Lord!) in this life, and put me here in such a condition, as there may be
no need hereafter of any Purifying Fire; that so I may be the sooner united to
thee, my first beginning, and my final end and felicity.

The practice hereof may be reduced to these points following.

1. COnsider, that all Sin, renders us liable to punishment, which must
infallibly be paid, either in this world or in the next. Now our merciful Lord
seems to leave the choice unto our selves, and to present unto us two
Purgatories: That of the next world, painful, long, fiery, devoid of all
comfort and merit: That of this world, easy, short, and full of comfort. O my
Soul! which will thou choose?

2. The Purgatory of this world consists in satisfying Gods severe Justice for
our sins, as far forth as we are able by our own free actions: without
deferring it to the end of our lives, or depending upon the charity of others.
O my Soul! were thou presently to depart out of this world; how many years of
Purgatory must thou expect for the expiation of thy many and enormous offenses?
Resolve therefore to begin (even this day without any farther delay) thy
Purgatory in this world, by endeavoring now to make satisfaction for thy sins.

3. This Satisfaction consists in these Five things; which may serve us for as
many Purgatories, to cleanse our Souls from their Sins, and cancel the pains
they have thereby justly incurred.

The first is, To perform those works which are called Satisfactory, to wit,
Alms-deeds, Fasting, and Prayer; uniting them to the merits of our Redeemer,
Christ Jesus. Alms deeds, satisfy the divine Majesty, by giving him our goods
of Fortune: Fasting, by consecrating to him the goods of our Bodies: Prayer, by
offering up to him the goods of our Hearts and Spirits.

Alms-deeds free us from Sin and Death; and suffer not a Soul to descend into
darkness. They purge us and procure us mercy, and eternal life.

Fasting, which (under its notion) contains all sorts of penitential actions,
mor ifications, and austerities, both voluntary and obligatory; opens
Heaven-gates unto us.

Prayers appease the divine Anger: and Tears extinguish the Fires and Flames
which are prepared by Gods Justice, to punish us for our offenses. Now the most
efficacious Prayers are these: (1.) The Sacrifice of the Mass. (2.) The
Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist. (3.) The continual practice of Acts of
Contrition; which served the pious Magdalen for her Purgatory at the feet of
Jesus.

The Second is, To embrace all the Afflictions, Crosses, Calamities,
Sicknesses, and Losses of this life; as so many purging Fires. Thus the patient
Job endured his Purgatory upon his Dunghill, and in the Fire of fervent Charity,
and faithful Resignation, which made him break forth into these expressions
amidst all his sufferings: Our Lords Name be ever blessed: As he pleases, so
all things come to pass.

The Third is, To practice heroic Acts of Virtue; as, generously to pardon
your enemies; nobly to oblige them, who have disobliged you; couragiosly to
conquer that Passion, which has most power in your Soul: For, the pains you
take, and the violence you use upon these occasions, will much contribute to
the Satisfaction for your Sins, and serve you instead of your deserved
Purgatory.

The Fourth is, To perform such Works of Restitution, Charity, and Piety, in
your own person, and during your lifetime; as you desire should be done at the
hour of your Death: For by clearing your own Accounts, settling peace in your
own Soul, and executing your own Testament; you will be exempt from the fear of
suffering a severe Purgatory, through your Executors negligence.

The Fifth is, When you have performed all things, as your zeal to satisfy
Gods Justice has suggested unto you, To have an humble sense of the no-worth
and value of all your own actions and endeavors; and thereupon, To address
your self to the undrainable treasury of your Saviors merits, hoping to draw
thence, sufficient Water for the washing away of all your offenses.

These are the Five voluntary Purgatories of this World, by which if you here
satisfy for your Sins, you may hope to avoid hereafter the necessary Purgatory
due to them in the next World.

13. An Appendix containing several devout and efficacious Prayers; proper for
the frequent use of all pious Christians.
1. A Prayer to our Lord Jesus, wherein we humbly acknowledge him for our
Sovereign, and promise him faithful obedience for the future.
O Jesu! King of Kings! to whom all power is given in heaven and earth, as a
most just reward for thy most perfect Obedience! Thy Empire is out of the reach
of rebellion, it dreads no dangers, and is free from the vicissitudes of
Fortune. Thou want neither spies abroad nor policies at home to secure thy
Throne, neither warlike guards nor worldly greatnesses to procure thy respect
and increase thy honor; since whatsoever is requisite to be the Sovereign King
of Kings, and the immortal and incomprehensible Monarch of Heaven and Earth, is
in the riches of thy own divine Being; and thy own Nature necessarily involves
a boundless Jurisdiction.

Wherefore, O Jesu my Savior! behold here prostrate before thee, one of thy
meanest subjects, offering to thy sacred Majesty, as to his sovereign King, an
humble and most respectful Homage. I come, Lord! to renew that solemn Oath of
fidelity which I took formerly in Baptism; and to present thee the Key of my
Heart, hoping thou will vouchsafe to enter in, take full possession, and make
there thy constant habitation. Thou, O all-powerful King! can soon make it
fit for thy own entertainment; having in this point (as in all others) an
advantage over earthly Princes, to raise men from their dunghils, and render
them worthy of their dignities: Thou, O great Monarch! choosing Saul for the
King of thy people, changedst also his spirit; calling David from the
sheepfold, madst him a man according to thy own Heart; drawing the Apostles
from their Fishing-employments, rendredst them fit Preachers of thy Gospel. Why
then shall not I with an humble boldness beg thy entrance into my poor Heart;
since I well know, it will at the same instant become a mansion worthy thy
Royal Majesty?

I am not fully satisfied, O my Sovereign King! in being thy faithful subject,
I desire to be thy Bondslave and Vassal: I will therefore no longer pretend to
the least power over my self, but all my future labors and endeavors shall be
to acquire riches for thy Royal Majesty: Yes, my will is, that every child of
mine, (to wit, all my works, words and thoughts,) shall be henceforth born in
the same Bondage of thy Love. O my Soul! what higher honor can we have, than
to live in a such Slavery? O my Savior! sweet is thy yoke, light thy burden,
easy thy precepts, favorable thy fetters, pleasing thy authority, prudent thy
proceedings, paternal thy providence to them who faithfully adhere to thee. O
how loving and liberal a Lord art thou to such loyal subjects? Unhappy they who
are none of this holy number; and ever magnified be thy Mercy, which has drawn
my soul out of my enemies clutches to enrol her thy Captive. Behold, O my
blessed Redeemer: I acknowledge my self, with much comfort and content to
appertain particularly to thee in quality of an absolute Bonds man, by this thy
new right of purchase: but yet, O my dread Lord and Master! I know not how to
render thee a Bondslave's duty, and therefore beg of thy goodness to teach me
this great secret, and take from me that unfortunate liberty, which enables me
to rebel against thy Royal will and pleasure. Ah! my Lord! If thou leavest this
my liberty to it is own nature; I shall soon leave off all Obedience to thy
laws: I shall quickly, alas! trample upon thy Crown, slight thy Scepter, and
use against thy self all the goods, thy bounty has given me: My Understanding
will censure thy Mysteries, my Memory will forget thy mercies, my Fancy will
feed upon filthy Images, my Will will love what thou loathest, my unruly
Passions, uncurb'd Senses, brutish Appetites will all bandy against thy blessed
Grace and my own Reason: Finally, I shall glory in being thy enemy, and say,
Who is the Lord?

Take from me therefore, I beseech thee, O Jesu! the root of this dreadful
rebellion; command and compel my stiff neck and stubborn nature to submit to
the blessed yoke of thy law, and force me to be happy. O most pleasing
constraint, which renders me a copartner with thy self in thy Royalty! For
thou, O great and gracious King Jesu! art nothing jealous of thy Sovereignty,
but thou most liberally communicatest it to thy beloved Subjects, designing
them to be all Kings in thy endless Eternity: And is it possible, O my Soul!
that thou so easily quittest so sublime a Dignity? Will thou be so silly, as to
fall in love with thine own shackles, that is, with thy filthy sins of
Ambition, Avarice, Revenge and Sensuality? Ah! art thou not utterly confounded
at thine own excessive Folly: and will thou not yet perceive, how thy own
error brings with it a self-punishment? Alas! what is it that thou love,
what is that, which seems to content and comfort thee? What is it, that
pretends to secure thy Soul in this shameful servitude? On the contrary; what
troubles, what torments, what solicitudes, what horrors, does not each moment
of time suggest to thy trembling spirit?

Shake off then with a manly courage, this sad and heavy yoke of Sin and Satan,
and submit cheerfully to that which thy Lord Jesus this day presents unto thee:
A yoke, which is sweet and easy, and which he himself will carry together with
thee. Yes, O immortal, invisible, omnipotent King Jesu! I change Master even at
this instant; and I make choice of thee, to be henceforth my sole Lord and
Sovereign. Behold not, I beseech thee, how long I have staid in rebellion, but
look upon the Wounds thy self endured to win me to thy Obedience. Reign in
Heaven and earth, O Adorable Monarch! and rule particularly in my heart and
Soul; and let all rational creatures unanimously confess and acknowledge it
their highest honor and happiness to be Servants to the crucified King Jesus.

2. A Prayer, to be said by one, who is upon making choice of a condition of
life; begging light from above, to discern Gods Will, and his own Good.
It Is the order of thy divine Providence, O dread Sovereign of Heaven and Earth!
that there should be in this great world several sorts of states and
conditions, to which thou designest men by a choice, known only to thy
all-knowing Wisdom. Thou also assurest us by thy sacred Word, that each one
ought to remain in the condition to which he is called, And there is no lawful
calling which exclude's from thy Kingdom. This moves me to prostrate my self,
at thy feet and pour forth my heart here in thy presence, hoping to receive
some glimpse of light from thee, (O true light, which illuminatest every one
coming into this World) To direct me in this matter, which is to me of highest
importance, not only as to my temporal, but my eternal happiness. O my Lord, I
humbly acknowledge my own ignorance and simplicity; for alas; I neither can
foresee the future, nor dive so far into my own dark interior, as to
distinguish whether the motions I there feel are Rational or Sensual; and
whether my perverse Nature opposing thy Grace, incline's me not to an Election
which may endanger my Salvation. The World and the Flesh furnish me with plenty
of fair and specious Reasons, but I well consider they are dangerous
Counselors, and damnable are their Maxims. Lord! lead me out of this labyrinth
of irresolutions; since I resolve to leave my self absolutely to the conduct of
thy holy Spirit, renouncing all my own ratiocinations, affections,
inclinations, and interests; and willing nothing at all, but only what thou will for me. Behold I am thy Servant and the child of thy handmaid; say only
the word (O my loving Master!) and thy holy will shall be obeyed; lift me up or
cast me down, it shall equally please me, so I may perceive it is thy divine
Conduct which disposes thus of me thy poor Creature. I beg of thou this only
blessing, O my compassionate Father! that thou will please to prosper and
sanctify me in that particular State I shall settle in, giving me strength and
courage to wade through all the difficulties I shall there meet with, and
rewarding my Perseverance in thy love and service in this world, with a crown
of glory, and with immortality in the next.

3. A Prayer to be said by one who is fallen into some great Necessity,
Calamity, or Misery.
THy infallible truth assures me, O Sovereign Lord God! there is not a Hair of
my Head fal's off without thy order: How then can I doubt, but this sad
Accident befal's me by the particular permission of thy all-penetrating
Providence? I will not know the reason of this thy proceeding; since I
acknowledge thee, (O my Omnipotent Creator!) to possess an absolute Empire not
only over my goods, but over my life; and that my person is in thy power, as
Clay is in the hands of the Potter, to imprint upon me what form and put me to
what use, thy self best pleases. Thou (O my Lord!) gave me health, wealth,
peace, fame, friends, children, prosperity, etc. Which was a favor, I humbly
confess, I did not deserve; thou have now deprived me of them, which I humbly
acknowledge to be an effect of thy Justice, since I made not use of them as I
ought to thy only glory and my own eternal good. Thy blessed will be done in me
and all creatures, is all the Complaint I will make; begging thy Grace to
imprint as well in my Hear the meaning of these sacred words, as I have the
sound of them in my Mouth; that I may joyfully, resignedly, and without reserve
submit to thy sacred disposal all that concern's me, and make use of thy
Fatherly Visitations to the increase of my Filial obedience and affection. Let
me forget what I have been in my former Prosperity, and not fear what I may be
in any future Adversity; cheerfully embracing my present Condition, incessantly
praising thy sweet Providence, and peaceably expecting the eternal Recompense
thou have promised to such as suffer for thy sake.

4. A Prayer humbly imploring the continuance of Health, and that we may make
good use of it, in order to our eternal Happiness.
MAn, born of a Woman, (as your sacred Word, O eternal Truth! teaches us,)
live's but a short time, And during this his short stay upon earth, is subject
unto many Miseries. His life is a Flower, which drie's up and dwindles away
upon the same day it is displayed: it is a Blast, soon past and dissipated: it is
a stream of Water, which nimbly slides by, disappears, and never more returns:
it is a Shadow, flying away as soon as formed: it is Smoke, which as it rises,
vanishes: in sum, it is a mere Vapor, having no solid consistence and
permanency. This is the short, fickle, uncertain nature of man's life; and I
ask thee not (O great Lord of life, and death! to change it for me; I only
beg, that thou will be pleased in giving me Health, to grant me also Grace to
make the right use of it to thy glory and my own salvation, for alas! I shall
be little able to act for the one or the other, when the rigor of a sharp
Disease seizes on the functions of my inward and outward faculties. Grant, (O
my God!) that the curb of thy holy fear may keep my body always in good order,
(least it being high in flesh should shake off it is subordination to the
spirit,) that so I may employ it is strength to acquit my self of my Christian
obligations, and perform the several duties of my place and condition. Take
from me, O Lord! all desire of superfluities, which serve only to satisfy the
senses, and let me rest fully contented with such conveniences as serve for my
lives ordinary entertainment; till such time as thou shall please to free my
Soul from this fleshly slavery, and accomplish my Redemption, by destroying all
that is borrowed from the old Adam, and consummating my adoption in Glory;
which I desire for no other end but to be no longer subject to offend thee, (my
Lord and Maker,) and that I may be happily obliged and necessitated to praise
and love thee for all Eternity.

5. A Prayer for the Conversion of Heretics.
ONe of the secret Judgments of thy divine Providence, O Omnipotent Creator!
(which I humbly adore, without daring to dive into it,) is the permission of
Heresies to spring up in such multitudes, as Weeds amidst the Wheat, in the
field of Christianity. It Is for the conversion of these misbelievers, for the
reduction of these straid sheep, for the illumination of these blinded
Christians, that we now present our petition to the Throne of thy divine
Clemency. Clear them, O Lord! clear the Understandings of these our brethren
(for so they are, by participating with us of the self-same Baptism) and recall
them to the safe sheepfold of thy Universal Church. Give them, we beseech
thee, that Columbin simplicity, which is necessary to receive and retain the
Faith of thy Gospel; and that Christian infancy, which is not suspicious, not
litigious, not apt to dispute and judge, not puffed up with any self-opinions.
Let them see and admire the beauty of Catholic verities, by an inward light
penetrating their Understandings and captivating them to the obedience (...)
faith and the Church. Ingrave in their Wills the love of thy Truths, and
dissipate all these impostures wherewith their deceived Teachers entertain them
in the hatred of our sacred mysteries. We have enough disputed, written,
preached; be thou now, O divine Doctor! the concluding Umpire of all our
Controversies. Speak effectually to their hearts, O all penetrating spirit! and
open them to hear thy Voice and to admit of thy Inspirations; and having filled
them with the seed of thy saving Faith, shut them and seal them with thy grace,
lest the Birds of prey snatch it away. O Sovereign Shepherd! reunite these
wandering sheep to their true Pastor, and make us all members of one Body under
one Head; that we may with one heart and mouth unanimously adore, praise and
glorify thy sacred Name, during the remaining time of our pilgrimage upon
Earth, and afterward in Heaven for all Eternity.

6. A Prayer for a Special Friend.
PReserve, O Lord, thy Servant N. for whose Health, Happiness, and Prosperity,
we humbly offer up these our Petitions to thy Sacred Majesty; beseeching thee
to grant him a perseverant Constancy in the Catholic Faith, a safe passa^
through this lives dangerous Pilgrimage, and that no Worldly, Carnal, or
Diabolical Temptations may have the power to separate him from thee, his prime
and only Good. Give him Grace to correspond to the Calling and Condition
wherein thou have placed him: Direct him in all his Ways, Defend him against
all his Enemies, and grant him finally a happy Death and departure out of this
World; and a speedy passage after Death to the fruition of thy Eternal Felicity.

7. A Prayer for a Friend in Tribulation.
VOuchsafe, O merciful Creator, to afford the sweetness of thy Comfort to thy
afflicted servant N. and to remove according to thy wonted Mercy, the heavy
burden of his Calamities. Give him, we humbly beseech thee, Patience in his
sufferings, Resignation to thy good pleasure, Perseverance in thy service, and
a happy translation from this afflictive Life to thy Eternal Felicity.

8. A Prayer for our Enemies, Detractors, and Persecutors.
O Meek and Merciful Lord Jesu! the great Master, Exemplar, and Practiser of
Peace, Charity, and Union amongst men! Who have commanded us to love our
Enemies, and to do good for them who hate us; and who prayedst on the Cross for
thy capital Adversaries: Increase within us, (we most humbly beseech thee,) the
Spirit of Christian Charity; that we may freely, heartily, and sincerely
forgive them, who have any way offended, injured, or persecuted us. Bestow on
them also, (O Blessed Savior!) the same Spirit of perfect Peace, Love, and
Charity: and powerfully defend us from all their Deceits and Treachery.

9. A Prayer for a Woman laboring in Childbed.
O Most dread Sovereign! Who for the just punishment of the first Woman's
prevarication have pronounced and imposed a severe and unavoydable Sentence of
Malediction upon all Womankind, that they should bring forth their Children in
pain and sorrow: We most humbly beseech thee, (O undrainable Fountain of
Goodness and Mercy!) to mitigate the rigor of this general Edict, in behalf of
this your poor Handmayd, N. (now laboring in the pangs of Childbed,) and to
give her Courage, Comfort and Patience in her sufferings. Grant her (O gracious
Lord God!) a speedy and happy Deliverance; and that the Child she bears in her
womb, may be brought forth into the World accompanied with all such Perfections
of Body, Soul, and Senses, as are befitting our human nature; that it may live
to be re-born by Baptism; and that both the Child and the Mother, may become
thy faithful Servants.

10. A Prayer to withdraw our Minds from the superfluous Cares and Solicitudes
of this World.
O Lord, our true Lover, our faithful Teacher, and our bountiful Nourisher!
Take from us all vain, superfluous and noxious Cares and Solicitudes; and since
thou have been graciously pleased to promise us, that thy Self wilt make a
sufficient Provision for us, grant that we may confidently rely in all things
upon thy sacred Providence. Let us therefore fix our Hearts and Affections upon
Heavenly Objects: Let us seek only thy Kingdom; and be only solicitous for the
advancement of thy Honor and Glory: Let us run on cheerfully, courageously,
perseverantly, in the way of thy Precepts, during this our earthly Pilgrimage,
that so we may be finally translated to thy Heavenly Paradise.

11. A Prayer to appease the Divine Indignation, in any public or private
Necessity.
WHen we compare, O Lord! thy Punishments with our own Prevarications; we are
forced to confess, that our Crimes do far exceed thy Chastisements: We are
sensible of our Sins Penalty, but we leave not our sinful Pertinacy; Our sick
Minds are troubled, but our stiff Necks are not bowed: Our Life languishes
under the burden of our Afflictons, and yet we amend not our wicked Actions:
We acknowledge our misdeeds in the day of Correction, and we forget what we have
bewailed after the Visitation. If thou, O Lord, stretchest forth thy Hand to
strike us, we make thee large Promises; if thou sheathest thy Sword, we fail in
our Performances. If thou scourgest us, we petition thee to spare us; if thou
mercifully sparest us, we again maliciously provoke thee to scourge us.

Behold, O dread Sovereign! Thou have us self-accused, adjudged, condemned; and
we well know, that unless thou will pardon us, we must needs perish Yet grant
unto us, O Compassionate Father! that which we desire, though we deserve it
not; who have given us a Being, when we were not.

12. A Prayer for the Conversion of Heretics and Infidels.
ALmighty, and all merciful God! who seek and desire the salvation of all
Souls; Take pity (we beseech thee,) upon such as are seduced with pestiferous
Errors, and segregated from the unity of thy sacred Church. Pardon them, O
Lord, for they perceive not what they do* Illuminate the Eyes of their
understanding, O true Light of all Spirits! that they may see their own
Blindness, and seeing it, may speedily abandon it: And that so becoming
sincerely reconciled to thee the Supreme Shepherd, and to thy Church, the only
safe Sheepfold; they may joyfully praise and magnify thy Mercies, together with
us thy faithful Children, for evermore.

13. A Prayer for a sick person.
O Sovereign Lord God, the Author of our Health, and our Comforter in Sickness;
in the Watch of whose Divine Providence run all the Moments of our lives
earthly Pilgrimage! Hear, we beseech thee, the humble Petitions, which we
present to thy throne of mercy for N. thy infirm but faithful Servant, and
mercifully restore him to his former welfare, that he may henceforth walk more
worthy his Calling, and make greater progress in virtue and Piety. But if it is
thy pleasure, (O Supreme Lord of Life and Death!) to call him hence to
Eternity; let thy most just Will, (O Heavenly Father!) be accomplished in this,
and in all things whatsoever: only let Death find him well prepared, and
rightly disposed. Let him humbly kiss thy Paternal Rod which chastises him,
and patiently submit to the Cross which thy loving Hand has laid upon his
Shoulders: Let him behave himself, during the remaining time of his Infirmity,
as befits a faithful and devout Christian; free from Pusillanimity and Despair,
full of Hope and filial confidence: And finally, being strengthened with the
Sacraments, reconciled to his Enemies, and settled in thy Grace and Favor; let
him cheerfully expect, and joyfully embrace Deaths summons, and quietly pass
from this place of Banishment to his happy home in thy Heavenly Paradise.

14. Prayers, in Time of the Plague.
1. The Anthem. Remember thy Covenant, (O Merciful Creator!) and say to the
smiting Angel, Now hold thy Hand: that the Earth may not become desolate, and
every living Soul destroyed.

Ver. Lord, let thy Anger cease from thy People.

Ans. And from thy City.

Let us Pray.

HEar, we most humbly beseech thee, (O Compassionate Lord God!) the Prayers of
thy distressed people: and as we acknowledge our selves to be justly punished
for our offenses, so be thou pleased in mercy to free us, for the glory of thy
own sacred Name.

2. O God! who well know that our human frailty cannot subsist amidst so
many and so great Dangers, without the support of thy Divine favor and
assistance: Give us, (we most humbly beseech thee,) Health of mind and body;
and grant that we may overcome by thy help and mercy, what we deservedly suffer
for our own Sins and Impieties.

3. Lord! lend a gracious Ear to the petitions of thy poor Servants; grant us
the desired effect of our faithful Supplications, and avert from us the fury of
the raging Pestilence: that we may humbly and gratefully acknowledge these
Scourges to proceed from thy just Anger and Indignation, and to cease through
thy boundless Mercy and Goodness.

4. A Prayer to the sacred Virgin Mother, (called the Myraculous Prayer,
against the Plague.)

THe Star of Heaven, (whose snowy Breast
Did suckle our sweet Lord;) suppressed
The Plague of Death, whose Origin
Was from the very first of Men:
May that clear Star at present daign
Those Constellations to restrain,
Whose Wars deprive men of their Breath,
By the destructive wounds of Death.
Repeat thrice these four ensuing Verses.

Bright Star of the Sea, against Plague thy help afford,
Nothing's denied thee by thy Son, our Lord,
Who honors thee, Blest-Maid: Sweet Jesu, save
Them by thy power, for whom she daigns to crave.
Let us Pray.

O God of Mercy, God of Compassion, God of Pardon! who in time past taking pity
upon thy afflicted, people, commandedst the striking Angel to withold his
Hand from further punishing them: We most humbly beseech thee, for the love of
that glorious Star, whose sacred Breasts gave thee suck, to preserve us from
all Plaguey Infection, to deliver us from an unprovided Death, and to defend us
from all destructive Accidents and Incursions.

15. Prayers for a happy Death.
1. O Dear Lord Jesu! I most humbly beseech thee by those bitter Pains and
Pangs, which thou suffredst for me in thy bitter Passion, and particularly in
the hour wherein thy Divine Soul passed forth of thy blessed Body; take pity
upon my poor and sinful Soul in her last Agony, and in her passage to Eternity.

2. It Is thou, ( O Sovereign Goodness! who art the prime Source and daily
Preserver of my Life; and it is from thee alone that I can expect the Grace of a
happy Death. Thou (O Lord!) did not make this Death which separates Soul and
Body; 'twas Sin which brought it into the World; had not man strayed from thy
sacred Precept, he had not been subject to this severe Punishment. But yet thy
Divine Son, by enduring the Sting of Death, has changed its harsh Nature, and
through his means and merits, it may now be made a Sacrifice most pleasing to
thy Majesty: For precious in thy sight is the just man's Death, which is only a
glorious passage from Time to Eternity. This is the Death I here most humbly
demand of thy Divine bounty, as the Crown of all thy Mercies; for thou, (O
Lord!) look not so much upon the first beginnings of thy Children, as upon
their final End and Consummation; and the Eternity of their Glory or Misery,
depend's upon the last moment of their Life. Then it is, that the Tempter tries
all ways to prevail over the weakness of our spirit, (when it is beaten down
by the Bodies sickness,) either to swell it up into a dangerous Presumption, or
deject it into a more dangerous Despair. Then it is, that all the sinful
passages of our life come swarming into our Memories, to strike us with a sad
resentment of what it is too late to remedy. Then it is, that the poor Soul,
overwhelmed with a flood of sorrow, cannot without thy strengthing Grace,
exercise the functions of her Reason and Religion. Give me therefore, O my
gracious Lord God! in this passage, (which is so full of peril, and of so great
importance,) all those Christian dispositions, which thy wonted Clemency give's
to thy elected and beloved Children; that I may well perform this last duty of
life. Let me consider Death as the just punishment of Sin; and so most
willingly receive it, to obey the Law which comprehend's all his race, by whom
it was introduced into the World. Let me look upon my Body, as a parcel of old
Adam, deserving to return into dust, and only fit for corruption. Let me render
to thy Majesty most hearty thanks for vouchsafing by Death to deliver my spirit
from the Law of these corporal Members, which kept it so long enslaved under
the Law of Sin. Let me freely offer up to thee my life in Sacrifice, and let
thy love be the Fire, not only to purify, but also to ennoble this my
oblation, which of it self is so mean and contemptible.

Finally, (O Sovereign Lord of life and death!) I resignedly leave to the
conduct of thy sacred Providence all that concerns my poor Soul's departure out
of this her pilgrimage, as to the Time, the Place, the Assistants, the
Consolations, the Derelictions and whatsoever other Circumstance. I only beg
that thy holy Grace may not then abandon me, when all human helps must of
necessity become useless unto me.

In the mean space, let Death (O my God!) be my continual Looking-glass, to
keep me from wilfully offending thy Divine Majesty; to check my immoderate
Affection to this life, which is so uncertain in its permanency and so certain
in its misery; and to mind me, that each Moment of time I live, may be the
last, wherein I must appear before thy dread tribunal, to render an account of
my actions, and to receive accordingly a definitive sentence, which must remain
irrevocable for all Eternity.

3. The Prayer of S. Vincent to our Lord Jesus for the same end; that is, to
obtain the grace of Dying well.

O My Sovereign Lord Jesu! who dyedst for the salvation of the whole World, and
desire not, that any one should perish; to whom I never present my Prayers
with out hopes of Mercy, relying upon thy own gracious Promise; That whatsoever
shall be asked in thy Name, shall be granted: I beseech thee by that sweet and
sacred Name, that in the Article of my Death, thou will be pleased to give me
perfect integrity of my Senses, true Contrition for my Sins, a lively Faith, a
firm Hope, and a perfect Charity; that I may then say unto thee with a pure and
clean Heart; into thy Hands, O my Savior Jesu! I commend my Spirit.

16. A most Devout and Efficacious Prayer to our Blessed Redeemer, in the
honor of his bitter Passion.
Which whosoever shall humbly Recite, before the Image of a Crucifix, (with a
pure Intention and perfect Resignation several Days together;) may confidently
Hope to obtain of the Divine Mercy, a full Grant of their lawful Demands.
O Dear Jesu! My blessed Savior and Redeemer! The sweet Comforter of all sad,
desolate and distressed Souls! Behold thy poor Servant, humbly prostrate at the
foot of thy holy Cross; deploring his Misery, imploring thy Mercy, and
beseeching thee to take pity and compassion upon him in this his present and
pressing Affliction [Infirmity, Poverty, Temptation, Trouble, or whatsoever
other Spiritual or Corporal Necessity.]

Hear my Prayers, O assured Refuge of all afflicted wretches! behold my Tears,
consider my Sorrows, and remedy my Distresses: for finding my self encompassed
with grievous Calamities, by reason of my great Crimes; I know not whether to
fly for Succor, or to whom I may make my Moan, but to thee, my meek and
merciful Savior; with a full hope and confidence that thou, O my loving
Reedemer! wilt vouchsafe to lend the Ears of thy ordinary piety and accustomed
clemency, to the humble Petition of thy poor Child; And

By that sweetness which thy blessed Soul resented at the time of thy Alliance
with our Human nature; when resolving with the Father and the Holy Ghost, to
Unite thy Divine Person to Mortal Flesh for Man's salvation, thou sent'st thy
Angel to the holy Virgin Mary with those happy tidings; and clothing thy self
with our Humanity in her chaste Entralls, remainedst true God and true Man for
the space of nine Months in her sacred Womb:

By the Anguish thou enduredst, when (the time of thy designed Passion drawing
nigh) thou prayedst to thy Eternal Father, That if it might stand with his
Divine Providence, thou desiredst that bitter Chalice might pass away from
thee; yet concluding with a most perfect act of Resignation, Not my Will, O
Heavenly Father, but thine be fulfilled:

By the outrageous Injuries, scornful Disgraces, cruel Blows, contumelious
Blasphemies, forged Witnesses, false Accusations, and unjust Judgments, which
thou (Innocent Lamb,) patiently enduredst.

By the Shackles which fettered thy Limbs, the Tears which flowed from thy
Eyes, the Blood which trickled from thy whole Body.

By the Fears, Sorrows, and Sadnesses of thy Heart, and by the Shame thou
receivedst in being stripped of thy Garments, to hang naked on the Cross in the
sight of thy sorrowful Mother, and in the presence of all the People.

By thy Royal Head crowned with Thorns, and smitten with a Reed; By thy Thirst
quenched with Vinegar and Gall; By thy Side opened with a Spear, and issuing
forth Blood and Water, to refresh our Souls with that living Fountain of thy
Love and Mercy.

By the sharp Nails wherewith thy tender Hands and Feet were cruelly pierced
and fastened to the Cross.

By the Recommendation of thy departing Soul to thy Heavenly Father, saying;
Into thy Hands, I commend my Spirit.

By thy praying for thy Enemies, saying; O Father, forgive them, for they grow
not what they do.

By thy giving up the Ghost, when thou cryedst out with a loud Voice; My God,
my God, why have thou forsaken me! and then bowing down thy blessed Head to
reach us the Kiss of Peace, sayd'st; All is finished:

By the great Mercy thou shewd'st toward the good Theif, saying; This day thou
shall be with me in Paridise.

By thy Descent into Limbus, and the Joy thou communicated'st to the just Souls
there detained.

By the Glory of thy triumphant Resurrection, and the comfortable Apparitions
thou frequently madst for forty days space to thy sacred Virgin Mother, to thy
Apostles, and to thy other chosen Friends and Servants.

By thy admirable Ascension, when in the sight of thy Mother and thy Apostles,
thou were elevated into Heaven.

By the Myraculous coming down of the Holy Ghost in form of Fiery Tongues;
whereby thou replenishedst the hearts of thy Disciples, with thy Love, and
gav'st them Strength and Courage to plant thy Faith in the whole World.

By the dreadful day of General Judgment, in which thou art to give Sentence
upon all-Mankind.

By all these Sorrows, Joys, Passions, Compassions, and whatsoever else is near
and dear to thee in Heaven and upon Earth; take pity on me, (O compassionat
Redeemer!) hear my Prayer, and grant me that, for which I now most humbly and
heartily Petition thee.

Mention here the thing you desire; or reflect mentally upon it.

Give me, O gracious Savior! a speedy and efficacious feeling of thy Divine
Succor and Comfort; (who according to the accustomed Sweetness of thy tender
Heart) art wont to grant the Requests of them who fear and love thee, even to
their own Souls desire and satisfaction.

Bestow on me also, (O my Blessed Lord Jesu!) a constant Faith, a confident
Hope, a perfect Charity, a cordial Contrition, a sincere Confession, a
competent Satisfaction, a diligent Custody of my self from future fallings, an
heroic Contempt of the world, a complete Conquest of my passions, a zealous
Imitation of thy exemplary life and conversation, [an entire Accomplishment of
my Vows,] an absolute Mortification of my self-will, a willing Readiness to die
for thy love and honor, a final Perseverance in grace and good works, a happy
Departure of my Soul out of this World, with my perfect Senses about me, the
holy Sacraments to strengthen me, thy self (O dear Jesu!) to comfort me, thy
sacred Virgin Mother, with the Saints my particular Patrons to pray for me, and
my good Angel to conduct me to Eternal rest, Eternal Life Eternal happiness.

17. A Prayer to our Good Angel.
O Holy and happy Spirit; who by our Merciful Creators appointment, have been
my faithful Keeper, my friendly Comforter, and my charitable Protector, since
the first instant of my Birth, until this present Moment! I humbly beseech
thee, to continue thy care and custody over me in all places, in all company,
upon all occasions, Preserve me, O my Good Angel! Defend me, and deliver me,
both whilst I sleep and when I am awake from all Diabolical Incursions, from
all evil Temptations, from all Dangers of Soul and Body, and from a Sudain and
Unprovided Death. Be thou graciously pleased, to represent my Wounds, my Wants,
and my Wishes, to our common Lord and Master, and obtain for me thy poor Pupil,
Courage to overcome my Self, and strength to get a complete Victor over Sin,
Satan, and Sensuality. Especially if there lurks any secret Crime in my
Conscience; obtain for me Light to discern it, a Will to detest it, Time to
confess it, and Grace to amend it.

Abandon not my poor soul, I beseech thee (O blessed Spirit!) for the Love of
sweet Jesus, who has not spared his dearest blood and Life to save it; but
remain constantly faithful, favorable, and friendly unto me all the moments of
my life; and take a special and particular care and charge of me, in my Deaths
last gasp and Agony.

Defend me then in that dreadful hour (O powerful Guardian!) from the fury of
my sworn enemy; and convey my departing Soul into the bosom of my dearly
beloved Lord and Maker, there to praise him with thy self for evermore.

(O my Good Guide!) I again and again iterate this my humble and earnest suit;
beseeching thee, neither to forsake me during this transitory Life; nor to
forget me when all the world will leave me: that through thy safe and secure
Conduct, I may so pass through the wearisom troubles of this earthly
Pilgrimage, as that I may find Eternal rest in the heavenly Paradise. Amen.

The Conclusion of the whole Work.
Being an Epithalamium, or nuptial Entertainment of the amorous Soul; ravished
in comtemptation of the reciporcal Affections, Mercies and Benefits of her
Bridegroom: upon those words of the Canticles. Dilectus meus mihi, and ego
illi. My beloved to me, and I to him.
1. O Lord of my love, love of my life, and life of my Soul! How amiable art
thou remaining in thy self, within the boundless limits of thy own essential
Perfections, and how admirable art thou issuing forth of thy self, to diffuse
abroad thy goodness and communicate it to thy Creatures! Witness this large and
lovely Univers, framed of norhing by thy Omnipotent Finger: whose beauty and
excellency more appears in Man alone, than in all the rest of its united
wonders and prodigies. Man! that miracle of the World, and Masterpiece of
Nature, in whose Creation, thy love, goodness and mercy can never be
suffciently admired and magnified.

2. And when this prime Creature had, (Alas! soon after its first production,)
lost its original Perfection, by violating thy precept: thou were graciously
pleased, (O great and glorious Sovereign!) out of the tenderness of thy
Compassion toward man, this poor Criminal, to give him (as it were) a new
birth, a new being, a new creation, in a manner far different, in a way much
more admirable, with an affection infinitely exceeding the former. For thy self,
(O prodigy of goodness!) becam'st man for his love, and enchargedst thy own
shoulders with all his sins, pains, and miseries; to set him at his ease,
freedom, and liberty. Yes; (O my Lord and Lover!) thou becam'st man, even like
me in all things, Sin only and ignorance excepted, which were incompatible with
thy goodness and wisdom, and which thou camst to destroy and cancel, thus
ennobling my Nature by uniting it to thy Divinity, sanctifying it with thy
Justice, enriching it with thy Grace, instructing it with thy Doctrine,
strengthening it with thy Example, rescuing it from servitude, restoring it to
its lost title of Gods Child, and rendering it capable of Eternal Glory.

3. O my God! how greatly do I feel my self obliged to love thee, in
consequence of this large, liberal, and signal favor. It Is a chain, which so
strictly ties me to a reciprocal affection; that it infinitely exceeds all the
expressions of my ravished tongue, and heart. For what had I, poor wretch!
alas! what had I (O my glorious Creator and gracious Redeemer!) whereby to help
my self; and what have I yet whereby to prevail against my potent adversaries,
the World, the Flesh, and the Devil; but only thy self, and what thou have
freely given me, who art my only strength, support and succor?

4. When therefore I look into the furnace of thy love (O my Lord Jesu!) and
behold thy personal descent from the Eternal Fathers bosom, to cloth thy self
upon earth with a parcel of our poor Humanity, for the redemption and salvation
of my Soul: surely this only contemplation fills my extasi'd heart with
unspeakable admiration; and not only excites, but inforces it, to love thee
most ardently, and (were it capable) even infinitely, and eternally.

5. But if for one only effect of your amorous bounty, I feel my self thus
powerfully obliged to expand my Soul before thy sacred Majesty: how much more
should I do it in contemplation of all thy united gifts, graces, and benefits,
abundantly contained in thy blessed humanity, whereby thou becamst our temporal
Redemption, and my eternal Salvation? Should I not much more ardently pour
forth my self before thee, in respect of so many ravishing motives; and yet
much more and more in respect of thy Self, (O my sweet Lord and Lover!) than of
all these amorous effects of thy Mercy, who art now my All, and art to be my
All in all, for all Eternity, in thy accomplished and consummated Beatitude;
when after the painful assaults and languors of this life, I shall remain in
thee, by thee, for thee, a happy and triumphant Conqueror over my self and all
my enemies?

6. Whence is it then, (O my Love, and my Life!) that my Soul melts not away in
the fires of thy sweet Affection? How comes it to pass, that my whole pleasure
is not in loving thee entirely, ardently, indeficiently? Why is not my
uninterrupted thought, song, and saying, My beloved to me, and I to him? since
thou thus forcibly constriuest, as it were and enchainest me unto thy self, by
these strong bonds of thy infinite Charity?

7. Ah! my dull Soul! this disaster comes undoubtedly from thy self; who
remainest so cold amidst these ardent flames, so hard amongst these iterated
strokes, so impenetrable against these sharp-Pointed darts and arrows of the
divine love and affection. Yes, (My Lord and Lover!) the desect of my love,
proceeds from my own default: For thou (My dearest Lord!) desire nothing more
than to see thy Grace have its full and entire effect in my heart, which I
hinder by my unnatural harshness, tepidity, and ingratitude.

8. Alas! my misery! shall I still live, and not sincerely Love thee, the only
worthy to be beloved object? No, (my amiable Lord God!) to live and to love
thee, shall be henceforth in me, one and the same continued, univocal,
convertible action. Let others lead their lives according to their own election
and liking; for my part, I here make choice of this life of love for my only
Haven and Heaven upon earth: and my amorous Motto shall be for evermore, My
beloved to me, and I to him.

9. Yes, (O sweet Bridegroom of my Soul!) thy sacred love shall be the lease of
my life; that I may cease to live, when I leave off loving thee. O the sweet
and secure life of Love! I have chosen thee, and I will contentedly repose in
thee; I have found thee, and I will faithfully follow thee; My Beloved shall be
mine, and I will be his, for all future time and Eternity.

10. Ah! (Sovereign King of Love!) how miserable is that Soul that lives devoid
of thy dear Love! and how much more miserable is that Soul which having felt
the sweetness of thy affection falls back to her former tepidity, negligence,
and ingratitude! O my Lord! Let not this misery fall to my lot; but let me love
thee solidly, sincerely, preseverantly. O Let my amorous spirit become fully
and finally absorpt into thy felf; Let me admire thee in thy blessed gifts and
graces, but permit me to adore thee in thy own abyssal, essential, amiable
essence, which infinitely exceeds them. Let thy Love run sweetly into my heart,
and permit my heart to return sweetly back by the same channel of Love into thy
bosom, (as a Brook slides silently and sweetly, but yet swiftly into its
original Ocean,) to be there unrecoverably lost in the bottomless depths of thy
divine Affections.

11. O my God, my Lord, my Love, my Life, my All! I am no longer able to endure
the consideration of thy ardent Love; without corresponding thereunto with all
my heart, soul, and strength, by the most zealous, perfect, and continued
affection, that can possibly be produced by any poor creature. O how it grieves
me to have so long neglected this necessary duty! O dear Love! I most humbly
crave thy pardon, and conjure thee, by thy own sweet self, to forget all my
past tepidities, and accept of this present ardour, whereby I promise to be
henceforth so faithful, fervent, and constant unto thee, that no time, no
temptation, nor death it self, shall ever hinder or interrupt the payment of
this my sincere homage of love, upon thy sacred Altar.

12. Behold (O the only Beloved of my Heart!) what a bold protestation of
future fidelity in thy presence, I have now made: hoping for thy blessing upon
it, as an effect of thy love; but putting no value upon it, as proceeding from
my self, whose power and being are one and the same thing, (to wit a mere
Nothing,) before thy supreme Majesty: Since therefore I have as much confidence
in thy infinite Goodness, as I have distrust in my own Nothing, I will
patiently, hopefully, resignedly expect thy divine will and pleasure in this
and all things whatsoever. O thrice welcome Will of my God! be thou fully
accomplished in me and in all creatures for all time and Eternity.

13. O dearly beloved Bridegroom of my Soul! thou art pleased to be all mine,
and I am resolved to be all thine: My life, my liberty, my love, all is thine
(Dear Jesu!) all shall be thine, and thine alone: Thou shall be the sole
subject of all my thoughts, and the sweet object of all my affections: Thou
shall be the God of my heart, the heart of my life, the life of my soul, and
the soul of my love for evermore: Thou shall rest as a fragrant Posie between
my breasts, repose like a loving Bridegroom in my heart, and reign like a
Sovereign King in the most intime closet of my interior: I will keep thee,
kiss thee, conjure thee to continue with me; and I will choose rather to leave
my life than lose thy love.

14. O my God! thou art my all and only good, thou art the only desire of my
heart, and delight of my soul; Thou art the only refuge, repose, and retreat of
my spirit; Thou art the only light of my eyes, music of my Ears, honey of my
Tongue, and joy of my Heart: Thou art the only sufficient and ever-indeficient
Fountain of peace, plenty, purity, and perfection: Out of thee, is neither
pleasure nor profit, neither praise nor preferment, neither liberty nor
liberality, neither peace nor purity, neither life nor love, neither honor nor
happiness, I will therefore remain in thee only, love thee only (O only amiable
object!) for evermore.
