The Publishers, to Mr. Henry Purcell.
SIR,
HAving had the good Fortune to meet with the Score or Original Draught of your
Incomparable Essay of Music composed for the Play, called The Indian Queen. It
soon appeared that we had found a Jewel of very great Value; on which account
we were unwilling that so rich a Treasure should any longer lie buried in
Oblivion; and that the Commonwealth of Music should be deprived of so
considerable a Benefit. Indeed we well knew your innate Modesty to be such, as
not to be easily prevailed upon to set forth any thing in Print, much less to
Patronize your own Works, although in some respects Inimitable. But in regard
that (the Press being now open) any one might print an imperfect Copy of these
admirable Songs, or publish them in the nature of a Common Ballad, We were so
much the more emboldned to make this Attempt, even without acquainting you with
our Design; not doubting but your accustomed Candor and Generosity will induce
you to pardon this Presumption: As for our parts, if you shall think fit to
condescend so far, we shall always endeavor to approve our selves,

Your Obedient Servants, J. May, J. Hudgebutt.

A Song in the first Act, Sung by Mr. Freeman.
^ WAke,^ ^ wake, wake Qui -- ^ ^ -- -ve -- ra, wake, our soft -- -- -- -- rest
must^ ^ cease; wake, wake,^ ^ wake, Qui -- ve -- ra, wake, -- our^ ^ soft -- --

no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no, -- -- no^ ^ more must
we sleep, must we sleep under Plan -- -- tain shade, which neither^ ^ Heat
could pierce, nor Cold in-vade; where bount'ous Nature never, never, never,^ ^
never, never, never feels de-cay, and op' -- -ning Buds, and op' -- ning^ ^
Buds drive -- -- fall -- -- -- -- -- -- ing Fruits a -- way.^

A Song in the first Act, Sung by the Boy with Flutes.
^ WHY,^ ^ why, why should men quarrel, why, why should men quarrel here, where
all,^ ^ all, all, where all -- -- -- pos -- sess as much as they can hope for^
^ by suc -- cess; none, none can have most none can have most, where^ ^ Nature
is so kind, as to ex-ceed, as to ex -- cee -- -- -- -- ^ ^ -- -d^ Man's u^^
though not his Mind; why, why,^ ^ why should Men quarrel, why, why should Men
quarrel here, where all, all,^ ^ all, where all -- -- -- -- pos -- sess as much
as they can hope for^ ^ by suc-cess, as much as they can hope for by suc -- --
cess,^ ^ as much as they can hope, as much as they can hope for by suc -- cess.^

By ancient Prophecyes we have been told,
Our Land shall be subdued by one more old,
And see that world's already hither come,
If these be they, we welcome then our doom.
A Song Sung by Mr. Freeman.
^ THeir looks are such that Mercy flow -- -- -- -- -- -- -s^ ^ from thence,
more gen -- tle, gen -- tle than our Na -- -tive in -- nocence:^ ^ By their pro
-- tec -- tion let us, let us, let us beg to live, they come not^ ^ here to con
-- quer but for -- give; by their pro -- tec -- tion let us, let us,^ ^ let us
beg to live, they come not here to con -- quer but for -- ^^ -- give, they come
not here to con -- quer but for -- give.^

If so your goodness may your power express,
And we shall judge both best by our Success.
A Song in the Second Act, Sung by Mr. Freeman.
^ I come to Sing great Zem -- -- -- po -- al-la's sto -- ry, whose beaut'ous
sight, so^ ^ Charming bright, out-shines the Lu -- stre of glory; whose
beaut'ons sight, so^ ^ charming bright, out -- shines the Lu -- stre of glo-ry.^

Sung by Envy and his followers with-Instruments. What Flat'ring noise is this,
At which my Snakes all hiss;
I hate to see fond Tongues advance,
High as the Gods, the slaves of Chance.
A Song Sung by Mr. Freeman.
^ Scorned Envy here is nothing, here is nothing that thou, that thou can
blast; Her^ ^ glo -- ries, her glo -- ries are too bright, to be over -- ^ ^ --
-- cast; her glo -- ries, her glo -- ries are too brigh -- -- -- ^ ^ -- t to be
over -- -cast.^

Sung by Envy and his followers with Instruments. I fly from the place where
Flaterry reigns,
See those mighty things that before,
Such slaves like Gods did adore,
Contemned and unpitty'd in Chains.
A Song Sung by Mr. Freeman.
^ BE -- gone, begone, be -- gone cursed Feinds of Hell, sink down, sink^ ^ down
where Noisome Vapers dwell; While I, while I her^ ^ tri -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
-- -- umph sound,^ Turn over. ^ while I, while I her Try -- -- -- -- -- -- --
-- -- ^ ^ -- -- umph sound, to fill, to fill the U -- ni -- ver -- sal Round.^

Sung by a Conjurer. YOu twice ten hundred Deities,
To whom we daily Sacrifice;
Ye Powr's that dwell with Fates below,
And see what Men are doomed to do;
Where Elements in Discord dwell,
Thou God of Sleep, arise, and tell,
Great Zempoalla what strange Fate,
Must on her dismal Vision wait.
The Conjurer's Charm.
BY the Croaking of the Toad,
In their Caves that make abode;
Earthy Dun that pants for breath,
With her swelled sides full of death;
By the Crested Adder's Pride,
That along the Cliffs do glide;
By the Visage fierce and black,
By the death's Head on thy back;
By the twisted Serpents placed,
For a Girdle round thy Waste;
By the Hearts of Gold that deck,
Thy Breast, thy Shoulders, and thy Neck;
From thy sleeping Mansion rise,
And open thy unwilling Eyes;
While bubling Springs their Music keep,
That use to lull thee in thy sleep.
Sung by the God of Dreams. SEek not to know, what must not be revealed,
Joys only flow where Fate is most concealed;
Too busy Man would find his Sorrows more,
If future Fortune He should know before;
For by that knowledge of his Destiny,
He would not live at all, but always dye;
Enquire not then who shall from Bonds be freed,
Who it is shall wear a Crown, and who shall bleed;
All must submit to their appointed doom,
Fate and Misfortunes will too quickly come;
Let me no more with powerful Charms be pressed,
I am forbid by Fate to tell the rest.
A Song in the Third Act, Sung by Mr. Freeman, and Mr. Church.

A Song Sung by Mrs. Cross.
^ I Attempt from Love's sickness to fly -- -- -- in vain, since I am^ ^ my
self my own Fever, since I am my self my own Fever and Pain; No^ ^ more now,
no more now fond Heart with Pride, no more swell, thou can not raise^ ^
Forces, thou can not raise Forces enough to re -- bell: First strain again.
For^ ^ Love has more power and less mercy than fate, to make us seek ru --
in,^^ to make us seek ru -- ine, and love those that hate. End with the first
Strain^

Verse. Then Cho. We the Spirits of the Air,
That of Humane Things take Care,
Out of Pity now descend,
To forewarn what Woes attend;

Verse. Greatness clogged with Scorn decays,
With the Slave no Empire stay's,

Cho. We the Spirits etc.

Verse. Cease to languish then in vain,
Since never to be loved again.

Cho. We the Spirits, etc.

A Song in the Fourth Act, Sung by Mrs. Cross.
^ THey tell us that you migh -- ty Powers a -- bove, make perfect your^ ^ Joys
and your blessings by Love; Ah! why do you fuffer, ah!^ ^ why do you suf-fer
the blessing that is there; to give a poor Lover such^ Turn over. ^ sad torments
here, yet though for my pas -- -sion such grief I en -- dure,^ ^ my love shall
like yours still be con -- stant and pure.^

II.
To suffer for him gives an ease to my pains,
There Is joy in my grief, and there is freedom in Chains.
If I were divine he could love me no more,
And I in return my adorer adore;
Oh! let his dear life then (kind Gods) be your care,
For I in your blessings have no other share.
A Sacrifice, Sung by the Chief Priest.
WHile thus we bow before your Shrine,
That you may hear great Powers Divine,
All living things shall in your Praises join;
You who at the Altars stand,
Waiting for the Dread command,
The fatal Word shall soon be heard,
Answer then is all prepared,
Chorus. -- All Is prepared.

Priest. Let all unhallowed Souls be gone,
Before our Sacred Rites come on,
Take care that this be also done,

Chorus. -- All is done.

Priest. Now in procession walk along,
And then begin your solemn Song.

Chorus. All dismal sounds thus on this Offering wait,
Your power's shown by their untimely Fate;
While by such various Fate's we learn to know,
There Is nothing to be trusted here below.
