The Doubting Virgins Satisfaction: OR, The Maids Answer.
She who was possessed with fear,
is now eased of her Doubt;
And she her Sweetheart loves so dear,
she cannot live him without.
To the Tune of, The Reprieved Captive; Or, The doubting Uirgin.


DEarest know I do not slight thee,
for my Love is firm and true,
My desire is to delight thee,
i will be constant unto you:
Do not fear me, Love, but hear me,
and believe my constancy,
In me put trust, I will be just,
I scorn to tell my Love a lie.
Some young men may be deceitful,
but do not blame all for a few,
To be false to me is hateful,
you shall not find me untrue:


But I will strive whilst I Am alive,
to imitate the constant dove,
Thou shall find, me ever kind,
to thee my joy and dearest Love.
It would be to me a wonder,
if that thee and I should part,
And would surely break in sunder,
the tender strings of my poor heart:
But I desire, to admire,
the radiant beams of thy fair eye;
Which pierce my breast, and spoil my rest,
O grant me Love or else I dye.


In my eyes thou art a jewel,
far more precious then pure Gold,
If thou do to me prove cruel,
my warm blood will soon be cold:
Then shall I, assuredly,
be laid into my silent grave,
It Is you that can, preserve a man,
then kill me not whom you can save.
What is in my lines asserted,
nothing is but perfect truth,
Never shall be contraverted,
pray believe a faithful youth:
And if I lie, I wish to dye,
then never doubt what I do speak,
For if you do, you will find it true,
that for your love my heart will break.
The Maids kind Answer.
I Would put it to the trial,
if I thought your Love were pure,
And you would be true and Loyal,
falseness I cannot endure,
But yet indeed, my heart does bleed,
to hear you make such sad complaint
And now I find, I am inclind,
to love you by a mean constraint.
Then what Love you have professed,
and declared unto me,
Be but true 'twill make you blessed,
all your life you will happy be,
But yet my fear, begets a care,
by me cannot well be expressed,
Be true to me, and thou shall see,
I Will take a Lodging in thy breast.
And we quickly will be married,
to complete true Lovers bliss,
There shall nothing be miscary'd,
come we will bind it with a kiss:
Embraces then, they changed again,
and more and more both proved kind,
So they at last, were linked fast.
you Lovers all my ditty mind.
You that often make great pretenses,
if you prove not just and true,
You will find that great offenses,
will imputed be to you:
But you will be blessed, and live at rest,
and when you dye depart in peace,
UUhile some that prove, unjust in Love,
shall meet with pains that never cease.
Then let me in Love advise you,
to be constant unto death,
For you know death will surprise you,
and will stop each mortals breath:
Then live and be, from dangers free,
entail a Blessing while you may,
Be sure you prove, so sure in Love,
'tmay be your own another day.
FINIS.
