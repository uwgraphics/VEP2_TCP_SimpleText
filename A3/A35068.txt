PIERIDES, OR THE Muses Mount.

BY HVGH CROMPTON Gent.

LONDON, Printed by J. G. for Charles Web, at the Golden Boars-head in Saint
Paul's Churchyard, 165^.

To the Right Honorable, MARY, Duchess of Richmond and Lenox, etc.
Illustrious Lady,
IN these destructive Times, the Concomitants of Pride and Envy are swollen up
to such Vehemence and Vigor, that whereof wit should be cherished by
Indulgency, it is even massacred with remorseless Tyranny, and turned out naked
to the worlds tuition. The strong Oaks of Apollo are fallen by the hand of
Nature: and the tender aspiring Sprigs, (which were wont to shroud under them)
are left like Jonas, without a Gourd, and have not the passive power left,
which should carry them through the furious Hurricane which the evil spirit of
this Age has conjured up among us: wherefore I presume (and indeed my
presumption is great) to appeal to your Honor, as the only Sanctuary left me
for refuge, not wholly doubting Your disdain (which I might justly fear, were
not Your Candor above my Merit.) I am no Parasite, I will not offend You with
superfluous Oratory; Nor be a Sycophant to Your Virtue. The world is well
enough acquainted, and needs no pretended Herald to proclaim You Prudent and
Pious. May it but cohere with Your pleasure to aspect the endeavor of my Muse
with a serene Eye, and You will superabundantly feli^citate him who is

Your Honors Poor Servant, HUGH CROMPTON.

TO THE READER.
Reader,
THe condition of our Fortunes many times unhasps our Resolutions. I had bound
up my Muses in a bundle, intending them only for waste paper, the employments
of my Profession increasing, and (as I thought) likely to continue upon ^e. But
the succession of a worse fate having ^isimploy'd me, I resumed the Quill (that
idle^ess might not sway) and for want of a better ^^bour in my ramble, gathered
this Sallad from ^arnassus, and washed it in Helicon. But thou must find Oil and
Vinegar, and Sugar it with thy good conceit if thou please. Errors thou shall
have many, it may please the better, since the time glories in them. Yet if
thou pinch too hard, I have learned to cry Peccavi. Enter, and peradventure it
will please, if not, the remedy is removed; for I have done, only subscribing
my self

Thine, as thou art Mine, HUGH CROMPTON.

PIERIDES: OR, THE MUSES MOUNT.
I. Bacchus.
COme jolly God Bacchus, and open thy ^^ore,
Let the big-belly'd G^apes of their burden be eased:
Let thy liberality freely flow over,
For it is by thy bounty that we are appeased.
It is Sack that we lack,
It is Sack that we crave;
It is Sack that we fight for, and Sack we will have.
2.
Let pining Heraclytus drink of his Tear,
And sniv'ling Tymon lie sick in his cell;
And let the course Bumpkin preach law in his beer,
But it is Wine makes our fame and our glory to swell.
It is Wine makes divine
All our wits, and renownes
The Peasant wi^h Scepters, the Shepherd with Crowns.
3.
He that spends his money for honor, and climes
In the trees of triumph, may sit there and pause;
All he gets for his pains is the error of times,
Nursed up by the Pandars of vulgar applause:
But the gold that is sold
For Canary, brings wit,
And there is no honor compared to it.
4.
Some love to wear satin, and shine in their silk,
Yet quickly their fashion will alter and vary;
Sometime they will eat mutton, sometime they will drink milk:
But I am for ever in tune for Canary.
It is sack that does make
All our wants to be nothing,
For we do esteem it both meat, drink, and clothing.
5.
A green goose serves Easter, with gooseberries dressed;
And July affords us a dish of green peason;
A Collar of Brawn is New-years-tide Feast;
But sack is for ever and ever in season:
'Twill suffice all the wise
Both at all times and places,
It is a good friend to all tempers and cases.
6.
Then farewell Metheglin, thou dreg of the hives,
And Cider, thou bastardly darling of Summer;
You dull the quick blood that Canary revives:
Then fill me a pottle of Sack in a rummer;
For I Will drink till each chink
Be full, and it is but reason;
And then I shall have no room to harbor treason.
II. The Power.
1.
Blessed Rosella, shall I praise thee?
With wits herauldry emblaze thee?
Or with strong Encomiums raise thee?
2.
No, I need not; I should spoil thee,
Rhymes and Raptures would defile thee,
And of thy own light beguile thee.
3.
If the Muses I should muster,
And of Wits bring the whole cluster.
They could not unlock thy luster.
4.
All the verge of my desire
Is not to advance thee higher*
But thy virtues to admire.
5.
For thou art of such force and vigor,
Thou can make the mountains bigger,
And restrain the Lions rigor.
6.
Start the Stoic from his station,
Urge a dead man into passion;
And allarm a drowzy nation.
7.
Make the Bull to break his bridle;
And the Ass would not be idle,
Till he played upon the fiddle.
8.
Cause the Thief to break his halter;
And the Saint his zeal to alter;
Making thee to be his Psalter.
9.
And now I wish that I could win thee,
Or on my sleeve that I might pin thee,
Or set my Standard up within thee.
III. The Apprentice.
TIme mend thy pace, thy sands but slowly run;
Eight weeks seem longer then eight twelve months gone:
Sure the art asleep, thou do not make such have
To help me as thou have done in times past.
Stay'st thou to hear the Sirens whilst they sing?
Or has the rust of age impaired thy wing?
Have I affronted thee? did I declare
Thy faults, and set them out in secular?
Did I e're babble that the times were bad?
Or did I grumble at the tricks you had?
No, I have praised you, and was ever free
To gloss you out with an apology.
Why then this sloth? (dull Mower) can it be
That with revenge you will pay a courtesy?
Now I Have most need of Time, and ^^in would hug him,
His forehead's grown so bald I cannot lug him.
If thou art sick, then prithee wear a cap;
For I am fearful thou have got a clap,
Thy loins are grown so stiff; and thou do creep
As though the primum mobile were asleep.
I prithee rouse thy spirits, and let slip
Some gentle gale on my apprenticeship.
I see the haven, but if thou deprive
Me of thine aid, I never shall arrive.
But why should I petition to a soul
Impenetrable, that will not condole
The saddest sorrows; nor concede unto
The strongest prayers, or the deepest Oh?
He wait thy motion, be it slow or fast;
I know thou can not but conclude at last:
And when thou art ended, I Will detest thee more*
Then ere I gave thee honor heretofore.
Oh here is my grief, this smothers all my joy;
(...) can but say I am a prentice-boy.
I must be ready at each beck and call,
And if I fail, my bones must pay for all.
And this is long of thee ( Time) were thou ended,
Then all these misdemeanors would be mended.
But I Will take courage, and make woes divine,
With sacred Nectar and Falernian wine:
For I have studied Physic, and am sure
I Have no disaster but what wine will cure.
IV. The Discharge.
1.
WEll, it is enough, I Have charmed each thought
That moved my fancy into crimes:
My little wits I Have largely bought,
And now I Will vex no more at times.
Let States run round,
My muse is bound
Over to the peace, I will give over;
I Have said too much, I Will say no more.
2.
I have been punished for my sin,
And now my state of life I Will change;
Experience jogs me to begin
A fixed frame, and cease to range.
I Will be content
With Parliament,
With a Protector, or a King,
With House of Lords, or any thing.
3.
Why should I strive? what is it to me,
Whatever chance in State does fall?
No rotten M^^ler I will be,
Since it avails no good at all.
Heart, tongue and Hand
Shall slily stand,
Attending stories high or low,
As Hench-boyes to their Masters do.
4.
Let this man wear a sparkling Crown,
And in his hand a Scepter hold;
Let him take it up, or lay it down,
It gains me neither dross nor gold:
But if I grutch
'Twill lose me much;
And this resembles him that doubles
His own industry for his troubles.
5.
Therefore my fancy does decline,
And Virgin-like I Will stand demure;
So shall I ease this heart of mine,
And drink my sacred wine secure;
And laugh at those
That do oppose
State-turns, and every change regard,
Receiving ruin for reward.
V. The Conceit.
1.
GIve me the boul, the jolly boul
Filled to the brim with Claret:
And since the Crown from the head does roll,
Upon my nose I Will wear it,
I Will wear it there, and it is no crime
If I conceive my self sublime.
2.
I have a heart within my breast
That no misfortune knows,
And will not languish in the least,
While Fancy comes and goes.
No alteration me confines,
While my poor Muse does bro^ze the vines.
3.
I bu^then not my brains at all
With Parliamentall matters;
With who shall stand or who shall fall,
Or shall be torn in tatters.
I push out Ladies with my paw,
For I have read the Salique Law.
4.
I am as great, perhaps as good
As them that boldly slay
The Root and Branch of noble blood,
Princes and caetera.
Each Martyrs Ghost haunts them, we see,
When there is no fate has power on me.
5.
Yet I adore the sacred Stream
Of The Bacchanalian vain.
Whose pleasures yield a boundless Theme:
Then fill the boul again.
If this be vain, you must submit,
Your glory's far more vain then it.
VI. The Encomium.
1.
REach me a golden pen that writes
Such curious Raptures as the Court affords;
Such dainty Language as delights
Ladies saluted by their sprighly Lords:
Such as may paint the feature of Adonis,
Or tell a blind man how serene the Sun is.
2.
Oh it is my dear, the subject now
Wherein to sport my sporting Muse incites me;
And it is the splendor of her brow;
Whose fair reflexes on my Muse inlights me.
Bright Star of Majesty, methinks I see
The Gods and Angels strive to worship thee.
3.
So sweet a lip, so pure a cheek,
Such graces seated in her crystal eye,
As Paris might in Helen seek;
Such food in Juno Jove did never enjoy:
Tongues must be silent, phrases are too light,
Textor can teach us no such Epithet.
4.
Therefore I must content my passion,
That now is grown so furious and so proud,
Not with my pen, but speculation;
And this must be too through some velvet cloud:
For if I see her clear whom I adore,
Her beams will blind me, I shall see no more.
VII. Winifred.
SHe is facetious, of a gentle nature,
Well educated, of a seemly stature,
Pleasant and lovely, full of witty knacks,
(...) as all perfections, and there is none she lacks:
She Is young, she is old, she is both stale and new,
She is a virgin and a woman too.
She is religious; nay I Will tell you more,
She is a Lady and she is a whore.
VIII. Honesty.
1.
IN Lov's school I Have lately entered,
And have chose my nuptial mate;
On her virtues I have ventured,
E're I counted her estate.
2.
I have seen her grace exceeding
All the stroke of wanton girls:
I prized her bounty and her breeding
Richer then a thousand pearls.
3.
And such wealth will^ never be spent all,
Her virtuous soul cannot decay:
And where such beauty's ornamentall,
Who can turu their hearts away?
5.
And therefore my love I Will cherish,
Till I make my bliss divine;
And let me for ever perish
When I cease from being thine.
IX. The Farewell to the World.
1.
SInce the world does deceive every one that doth^ cleave*
To It, I now take my leave
From the pleasures thereof, and begin to abhor it:
And did you but know as much as I do,
You Would say I had reason sufficiently for it.
2.
What Is the best of the worth that the world does set^ forth*
From the South to the North?
If you look but with reason upon it, it is rotten.
Wherein shall I trust? when I Am laid in the dust,
The flags of my glory will all be forgotten.
3.
What Is the Prince in his Throne, or the Lord of the^ town,
Or the Statesman in's gown?
If the sound of their titles do only support 'um,
Their fame will not last till ages are past;
And the things they aspire at will surely come short home.
4.
What Is the Courtier in plush, or his Mistress's blush,
If she stands every push?
(...) not worth the touch of a Gentleman's Lacquey:
If you stick to her close you may forseit your nose;
(...) 'has that in her panniers will presently wrack ye.
5.
What Is the Mayor in his ruff, or the Soldier in buff,
And his ruffling stuff,
If their powers do serve them but only to chat on?
They are as gross as the Clown, that comes and sits down,
While his amorous Mistress makes water with his hat on.
6.
What Is the Nun in her nook, or the Clerk from his book,
Or the Judges grim look,
When the prisoners applaud him with Oh good my Lord Sir?
Take him but from the Law, and he is not worth a straw;
Bid him parse the Greek Grammar, he knows not a word sir.
7.
What Is the Miser in's dross, who is fearful of loss?
All his hopes are but moss;
And the zeal of his fashion is in his trunk-breeches:
But the Scull in his boat, or the Fool in his coat,
Has a far larger portion of freedom and riches.
8.
It Is the soul that does shape his designs by the grap^
Does all sorrows escape,
And is freed from the curses of danger and trouble^
And I tell you no lie, such a soul I enjoy,
And I find my good qualities daily redouble.
X. The Puff.
1.
BE gone ye dull lights of the world with yo^^ vapors,
He Is cursed that relies on your pitiful look;
He Is blessed that does banish you out of his book:
Your matter con^umes, and it dies like your tapour^^
It moulders away like the drammes of a day,
And there is no man does find it enough to conten^ him;
The best it will do is to cheat and prevent him:
2.
I neither will value your promise nor powers,
I will not aspire at the uppermost throne:
Give me but an Angel, take whose will the Crown^
All goodness that thence does accrew's like the showers
That fall in the springs, or the bird that now sings,
And is hush: from her bush by a puff: if you measure*
You Will find there is more of distraction then pleasure^
3.
^^ere can be no merit nor object of honor
More worthy then this, for a man to command
His glasses as subjects, his pots as a land:
He that can do this has all wealth, for he won her;
And then he may scorn to be overborn
By the trampling feet of the Court, or obey them;
His freedom of mind does out wit and o're-sway them.
4.
Do you but anoint me with unction of bottles,
Then I will be King, and then I will be Prince;
Then I will confute, and then I will convince,
And teach you more knowledge then ten Aristotle's:
And I will not fear then your almighty men,
Whose terrible voices can shake the foundations
Of great ones and small ones all over the nations.
5.
Then I and my people would jointly conspire,
^e sway them by love, and they shall not ^efuse,
^e cheer up my spirits and strengthen my Muse
By the wholesome heat of Bacchus his fire;
And I will not care how State matters shall go:
It Is not the great Sultan himself nor his asses
Can prove the least title they have to our glasses*
6.
He has but the genius of power to rule us.
My Fancy's an Island that lives by the store
Of its own native riches, and needs no more.
Why then should the Lord of the Ocean befool us?
Let Us drink a free health to our own Common^ wealth;
For I Will burn out this lump of my body to ashes,
Before I Will be frighted by fools or their flashes.
XI. The Ejection.
1.
NOw I have weaned my wits aside
From Melancholy's dismal breast;
And from thy conceited care my genius bids forbear,
And will no more the duggs abide,
That kept her soul unblest
Of nourishment and rest.
2.
I Have sent sad thoughts to be exiled
In The broker of Oblivions book:
I vow I will give over, and range about no more,
To seek for glory, pomp or gold.
All time thus spent we spill,
Insatiate souls to fill.
3.
World, I have tried thee, and I see
The frailty of thy temper such,
As secretly deludes each fancy that intrudes
On that supposed good of thee.
Far off you promise much,
Yet crumble by each touch.
4.
Why then (dull fate) should I desire
To wait upon thy wavering heels?
I know thy wanton tricks, alas thou can not fix
More then the metal in the fire:
Who, ere thy goodness feels,
It slips away like Eeles.
5.
My aspiration at the Throne,
My dartings at Nobility,
My labor for the word of Worship, or my Lord,
Shall fall into Oblivion.
Gooodness is altered in mine eye,
Worms take it, what care I.
6.
Place me but on the jovial joint
Of Bacchus his fraternal crew,
There we will govern point by point:
We Will drink deep healths to you,
And make no more ado.
12. The Suit.
AH me, Rosella! what do mean?
Must I weane
From thee mine eyes away so quick?
Can one glance
Ere advance
Future hopes, or a dance
To remain in my breast? I am sick.
2.
I am deeply sick of love;
Come, remove
These mists away by thy bright face:
You can cease
(If you please)
The rage of my diseases,
It Is your sweet presence does it chase.
3.
Have you a heart to tear and rent
My content?
Is this the rhetoric of your zeal?
Have you vowed
To be proud?
'Cause Nature you endowed
With beauty both to kill and heal?
Oh stay and do not leave the City:
Heal me for love or else for pity.
13. Loves best object.
1.
SOme say, that they
Will only love where beauty lies:
But sure such lovers lose their way,
And Cupid blinds their slippery eyes;
Such gilded love
Unfixt will prove,
And various as the weather.
For look when beauty does decay,
Then it and love will die together.
2.
Some say, that they
To wealthy girls will only share
Their hungry souls, but these (I say)
Deceitful sons of Venue are:
For the intent
Of him that is bent
Unto such base affection,
Is rather riches to enjoy
Then virtuous parts, or good complexion.
3.
Some say, that they
Will only turn their wandering eyes,
And straggling spirits to obey
The Nymphs of Pallas, grave and wise.
Such love as this
Most noble is,
And highly to be prised.
But make not wit your only prey,
If you by me will be advised.
4.
Some say that they
At Virtues center only shoot:
And such as these might find the way
To happiness, if they would do it.
But yet (alas)
Aside they pass,
And misapply their prizes;
For those that virtues be (they say)
By trial prove but rotten vices.
5.
But now, I vow
I Will tell you how it is best to love.
Love ver^ue, wealth, wit, beauty too;
And this will not unhappy prove:
How bright and clear
Shall she appear,
To a judicious lover,
Who in his apprehensions may,
These (clearly) all in one discover?
14. To our Mistresses.
1.
LAdies, expel your formal tricks,
Whereby you wrong your longing nature;
Strip ye your selves, and scorn to mix
Such masks and myst'ries in the creature.
Cog ye, and quibble, and do what ye ca^
Ye are created for the use of man.
2.
Why do ye flinch, and bend your brows,
When we demand if ye are willing
To wait on Venus? each man knows
Your fresh does lust, and asks fulfilling.
Fain, flatter, and do what ye can,
Ye are created for the use of man.
3.
We know your natures, and desire,
Which you conceal with modesty:
We know the thing you most require,
In soft pretenses sweetly you deny.
We know you labor all you can
To sport, and dally, and embrace with man.
4.
Since then in man you so delight;
Since he is the sum of your affection;
Since it is for him your fancies fight,
And make intestine insurrection,
Cast by your coyest veiles, and then
Present your naked bodies unto men.
5.
Pine not away with inward fire,
Waste not your beauty with pretense;
Wrong not (with echoes) your desire,
Nothing but sorrows spring from hence.
Cast by your blankets once again,
Present your persons unto naked men.
15. An Epithalme.
1.
Go, go to bed, brook no delay,
The Curfew. Saints-bell calls away,
Let Mars with Venus freely play.
2.
Be gone, be gone, let modesty
Not check your fancies, but enjoy
These nuptial pleasures legally.
3.
Doll, draw the curtains, let the eyes
Of day be dark, lest she surprise
These (dove-like) sporting Didymies.
4.
Let stupid Morpheus be exiled,
Till (arm in arm) you both compiled
Have laid down earnest for a child.
16. The Comparison.
HAve yon beheld the Apple Trees
How they will moulder by degr
In lukewarm Autumn, and how ba^e
In winter time their bodies are?
Then they are dead, but when the spr^
Her plant-reviving bell shall ring,
These withered trees begin again
To dress themselves, and all the tra^^
Of saplesse suckets that were dead,
With verdure will b'invelloped.
So it is with my fair Rose, for she
But now ('cause with frigiditie
She Is touched) seemed dull and dead; but when
Loves spring returns, she will love again;
So that the tender plant and tree
With my blessed Roses love agree:
Only they differ in the time,
(Which makes her virtue more sublime)
The trees receive reviving power
But once a year, she every hour.
17. Man.
1.
POor Man,
Why boasts he thus?
It is but for a spanne
That he must tarry here with us.
Can he his days recall? or can he reine
Times nimble Steeds, and call them back again
2.
He bragges,
And takes delight
TO unfold the tattered flagges
Of his own virtues, in the sight
Of every eye: but there is no reflection
Of his own eyes to his own imperfection
3.
Within
A calm of rest.
Deceitful peace does win
The flexile byas of his breast,
To dote on earth: but she disbands her power,
And loses all her glory in an hour.
4.
A bre^th
Produces Joy,
Another, woes or death.
Thus he 'twixt hope and fear does lie,
His sweets are mixed with, sowers, and his glory's
As apt to vary as the Child of Doris.
5.
He Is crossed,
Disturbed, and vexed;
Hurried, enraged, and tossed
By louzy Fortune, and perplexed,
While he has life; and yet he loathes to hear
^eaths doleful Bell man jangling at his ear:
6.
By life,
(Which he adores,
Which to preserve there is such strife;
And for that end, in's flesh he stores
Deaths Antidotes) he is deceived (alas)
often proves the greatest foe he has.
7.
He Is lost,
But tell me why:
It Is thus, because he will boast
Of Earth, and Earths felicity;
His judgement's blinded, and he thinks amiss,
Like prick-ear'd Midas. He is lost in this.
8
By death
Good souls of glory
Receive a joyful sheath;
Yet talk of death, he hates the story:
And what is the reason? why the reason's clear,
It Is 'cause he dreams there is no heaven but here.
18. On the renowned, Mary Villers, Duchess Richmond, etc. An Acrostick.
Most reverend Madam (in whose sacred breast
All virtue dwells, and heavens wealth does rest)
Receive these feeble raptures, which aspire
Your worth t'imblazon, and your parts admire.
Villers (thou darling of that light divine,
In whom thy Maker and his grace does shine)
Long may thou live, long may thou reign in peace
Long may thy virtues thrive and never cease.
Early and late, may all the Saints attend thee;
Rich robes of Glory may the Angels lend thee;
( Sweet soul) and it is my prayer, Let God defen^ thee*
19. The Acrostick reduplicate.
Might I but worship, and the Idol free,
Ah Madam, thou should be my Deity.
Religion, breeding, birth, renown and worth,
Yea every ornament Villers holds forth.
Vast is our theme, as though the Gods intended
In thee the pride of nature should be mended.
Love is thy Lacquey, Modesty thy Child,
Lewdness thy foe, and every vice exiled:
Eternal bliss is thy prepared prize.
Rule thou as Goddess in the earths disguise,
So shall my soul become thy sacrifice.
20. The degrees of Bacchus.
HEre I will closely stand to my devotion,
And will not stir til we have dreyn'd the ocean.
^^re I Will commence brave matters, and aspire
(...) Bacchus school, till I can climb no higher.
^^awer attend me with a cheerful cheek,
and do not let my liquor be to seek:
^^r if thou do, vile brat, (by Jove) I tell ye,
(...) mortify thy bones into a jelly.
The I. Glass.
^^ah, what is this? the biting of a flea
^^nto a Bear, a drop onto the sea.
^^ull rogue, recrute my cup, fill up the pot,
^^ep nothing void, nature admits it not.
^st thou not heard it on Apollo's drum,
^^atura non admittit vacuum?
^pply, supply me with another quick;
^his is devoured even at a lick.
2.
^gain, again recrute, and do not smother
(...) good beginning: help me with another;
3.
and yet another, with a nimble hand.
^uick, be obedient unto my command.
4.
^hese are but empty Prologues, you shall find
^here is a Scene of honor lies behind.
5.
All this is nothing to a dusty brain.
Rehearse thy duty, fill the glass again.
6.
So, now I taste it is nature, but (alas)
All this is nothing, fill the other glass.
7.
This whets the appetite, me thinks I find
Room for a volly coming yet behind.
8.
Now I could smile, and in a cheerful tone
Sing out the praises of my sack alone.
9.
So, stay a little, and anon you will see
Which is the strongest, or my wits, or thee
My brave Canary. No excess will grow
On either side. Cork-like, my wits they flow
Upon this liquor; and as that ascends,
So thrives my wit, and to the world extends.
10.
Brave Wine I vow, a Cordial to my heart:
Now I commence a Bachelor of Art.
11.
Now I am Master and a Doctor too;
Law, Physic and Divinity I Will show
All in a volume. Here Is the liquor'd Letter;
And being liquor'd it will work the better.
Here Is Art refined, sweet Music I have found;
My head strikes up, and all my brains dance roun^
Here Is Grammars Key, now I have undertook
^peak all tongues without a Construing book.
^gick and Rhetoric here recorded are;
^e's every thing that is pleasant and that is rare.
13.
(...) that Apollo was but here to see
(...) harmony betwixt my cups and me!
(...) that proud Hercules stood here before me!
(...) make him kneel, and tremblingly adore me.
should he not shiver to behold me stand
^^th a full glass of Nectar in my hand;
(...) with a hand full and a head full too?
^^d run away, and glad he escaped so.
^^st noble drink, how are my thoughts unsnar'd?
(...) thinks I am a man of great regard.
^^w I conjecture that the world is mine;
^^ugh to see adversity repine,
^^cause I flourish. Both the Turk and Pope
^^nd bare to me, bo^^ pleading (with small hope)
^^r a poor pension. O beloved Sack,
^^ving but thee, I Have all, and do not lack.
^^ere's wealth and riches, and here is beauty bright,
^^ere's Virtue and her Ladies of delight.
^^ere is the hand of Midas, (and that is much)
^^hich turns all to gold that it does touch.
^^ere is the pride of men, this makes small odds
^^etwixt our privileges and the gods.
^^hen welcome Sack (brave Sack) with all my heart;
^^ith thee I Will live and die, and never part.
^^ow to the stars I go, and in my pride,
^^ecome a Deity bestellifi^d,
With glittering Nymphs ( Diana-like) that be
Set there on purpose to imbellish me.
From Pole to Pole my fancy flies, to clear
All insurrections that are gathered there:
I dispossess bold Boreas, and assuage
The stubborn sallies of his turdy rage.
Clearing the air of gloomy clouds, and then
I Will kick down Persens from his seat again;
And take the sloven that Lucina bears,
And pull him from his Mistress by the ears.
And being mounted on her Crystal breast,
There will I sip my solace and my rest.
In her sweet bed of spices will I play
From day till night, and then from night till day.
Though Venus frown I care not, for I lack
No heart to daunt a foe, when filled with Sack.
There do I triumph in my glory, for
I need not bow to each competitor.
But laugh to see how sadly they repine,
And cannot climb unto such fate as mine.
There do I smile to see our Zealots creep
In clods of earth, half 'wake, and half asleep,
Like crawling Tortoises; while I arise
Mounting aloft (like Eagles in the skies:)
Then welcome Sack, the only wings that carry
A soul into Elysium, is Canary.
21. Her Continence.
It Is not the force of the golden shower,
That once so bounteously did pour
unto Dana^'s lap, that can
Make my chaste Rose a Courtesan
^o Jupiter; she will not stay
^er motion (like Atalanta)
^or the golden Apples that are flung
from the Wardrobe of a flattering tongue.
^o, y' are mistaken, she is none
^f that slight metal. She Will not own
^mooth Sycophanters; neither will
^he slumber carelessly, until
Great Jove the thund'rer shall descend,
^ There being no one to defend
^er from the furies of such fate,)
And as she sleeps, divirginate
^he tender girl, as once (you know)
^e did unto fair C^listo:
and then (to augment her first despair)
^ransforms the Wench into a Bear.
Nor is she like nights queen, that stepped
And kissed Endimion as he slept:
^eaving her dear Apollo bright,
that ^till reguilds her horns with light:
And leaves her own Celestial mirth
For the dull plea^ures on the earth.
No, no, my Rose will never move
The steady bias of her love
Like wavering Goddesses: it is she
Exceeds them all in constancy.
And for thy sake my constant Rose,
The crossest wind that ever blows
Shall not untwist that firm decree
That Heaven sealed 'twixt thee and me.
If wealthy Juno should present
Her self with all the Emolument
That e're she had, I should refuse
Her riches, and take thee to choose.
If solid C^res should adorn
My granaries with heaps of ^orn,
Upon condition, that soon after
I Would wed my self unto her daughter;
I Would heed her not: if Pallas should
A Cabinet to me unfold
Of all her gemmes, I Would not dismount
My love from Rose on this account.
In Rose there is Juno, Pallas too,
And there'sa Venus fair and true;
Mistake me not, Rose is not base,
She Is not in act there, but in face.
Therefore (dear Rose) what e're betide us,
It shall but wound us, not divide us.
22. The Soliloquy.
I Have no riches, neither know
I where the Mines of Silver grow;
The golden age I cannot find,
Yet there is plenty in my mind.
It Is wealth I crave, it is wealth that I require;
Yet there is no wealth to fill my vain desire;
Nor hopes thereof to still my craving lyre.
2.
What shall I do in such a case?
I am accounted mean and base.
Both friends and strangers frown on me,
^ Cause I am gaul'd with poverty.
Well, let them frown, yet I will not lament,
Nor value them, though fortune has not lent
To me her blessings, yet 1 have content!
3.
Alas poor plant of low esteem,
How base of thee the world does deem?
^'me but an object, could my name
But once procure the wings of fame;
Then like Apollo, glittering in the skies
I Would ride triumphant, and I Would tympanise,
Daring the apples of all humane eyes.
4.
I, but I am not so sublime
In parts and merits, as to clime
Into the high terrestrial story
Of ^ame, triumph, renown, and glory:
Yet my content shall vanquish my disease.
Perhaps if I should climb such stairs as these,
(Like Icarus) I might salute the Seas.
5.
For glory has but waxen wings;
It Is like the voice of one that sings
A Prick-song ditty, now he yauls
With mounted voice, and then he falls:
So falls our fame, for censure will exile it,
And ill looked Envy quickly discompile it:
The least disaster may at last defile it.
6.
I but poor warm, diseases pierce
The thin and slender universe
Of my poor flesh, weak flesh, yet I
Can find no help nor remedy;
But yet I care not, there is a healthful wind.
Survey Philosophy, and you shall find,
Sick flesh it better then a sickly mind.
7.
Then farewell care for carnal wealth,
For worldly fame, and fleshly health:
I Will use no Doctor, while I find
A wholesome temper in my mind.
I will not grieve, no fate shall make me vary*
Both cross and loss shall be no adversary,
I Will wash down all with glasses of Canary.
23. The Lovers form.
LAdy behold, a bruise that lies within
The folded carpet of our skin,
Will at the length be clearly found
To work it self into a wound
That Is visible, and will be seen
Unto the eye both fresh and green:
Or like the ember-sparks that lie
Raked up in tenebrosity,
Which by degrees become a flame:
Even such is Love; and mine is the same
To you fair Madam: Therefore know,
That as these sparks of Love do grow
Within my breast, I must discover
My self to be your faithful lover.
Nor do I speak with feigned tongue,
Projecting at your smallest wrong.
For my intention's sound and true;
(Lady) IN me deep in love with you.
Your virtues and your beauty joynd,
Have kindled love up in my mind:
And such a flame that I am sure
There Is none beside your self can cure.
Therefore (sweet Mistress) do you please
By loving me again to ease
My wounded heart, which must be yours
While I am mine, or life endures.
24. To my friends R. A. I. an Epithalme.
BEloved Couple may the Gods
So rectify you, that no odds
May ere distermine or divide
The Gordian knot which ye have ti'd.
Let earnest frownings never unfashion
Your calm content, nor raise your passion.
May all your acts and postures be
Of Cupids brave Artillery:
And may the greatest of your strife
(While you shall breath the breath of life)
No greater be, but that a cup
Of kissing lips may take it up.
Long may you live, long may you be
The darlings of felicity.
With health and wealth may fate salute ye,
As well as nature did with beauty.
25. Another.
BRight stars of beauty, and more bright
In every virtue. Since your light
Is joined and mingled, I will pray
To Jove and Juno that there may
Be no Eclipse, nor breach of love
To hide your glories, or to move
Your peaceful bosom. whilst you be
By Heaven allowed this unity.
O it is my wish, and my desire,
That every action should conspire,
And every power may comply
Even for your tranquillity.
Thus may you thrive, till ye inherit
The livelihood your virtues merit.
26. To Zoilus.
1.
WHen I remember what mine eyes have seen,
And what mine ears have heard,
Concerning Muses too too young and green;
And how they have been jeered:
TO expose my own I am afear'd.
2.
And yet this fear decreases, when I call
To my tempestuous mind,
How the strong loins of Phoebus children all,
Have fallen by censures wind:
And in their road what rocks they find:
3.
But then fresh thoughts my breast surprising, lend
More stripes of Eglantine:
For if with strongest Muses they contend,
And at such wits repine;
Much more they will strike at mine.
4.
When snotty Zoilus his detested breed
Shall their dull fingers lay
Upon my volumes, and begin to read
The included lines, he will say
I am but Bacchus boy.
5.
And what renowned rhymes can be expected
From him that is sopt in juice
Of guzling Aristippus, and infected
With liquor too profuse?
His wits are drowned in's cruse.
6.
Thus by my person he will my Poems measure,
'Cause I am young and poor;
(And who can hinder't if it be his pleasure?)
He Will say my wit's no more*
And I his lash must feel therefore.
7.
Well, what of this, though in his furious rage,
With belching words he says
I am a child, a child and under age,
In The non age of my days?
This adds the more unto my praise.
8.
But now to you, the lamps of humane wit,
And pillars of discretion;
That on the vertex of Parnassus fit,
Retaining full possession
Of prudence, far beyond expression:
9.
You that can please Mecaenas, if you please;
And daily drink your fills
Of wit, by courting the Pierides,
Which do invite your quills
To move, as water turns the mills:
10.
If you but please to cast your eyes upon
The offsprings of my brain,
With censure soft; and see what I have done
With love, and not disdain:
I have enough of joyful gain.
11.
And for reward, this promise I will give,
If ye will but incline
To tread within the limits where I live,
(Though all at me repine)
You shall be served with noble wine.
12.
The which I Will boast of to transcend the drinks
Wherein the Gods delight:
Here Is genuine Nectar, that is defiled and stinks.
O here is a lovely golden bright;
A taste that charms the appetite:
13
What though my drowzy Muse is too too dull,
Wanting some grains of weight?
Yet Pipes they flow, and Hogsheads they are full
Of liquor pure and right,
To which I do you all invite.
14.
Excluding Zoilus, and his crazy crew
^ hat fancied to contest
With Vulcans honest servant, 'cause there grew
No window in his breast.
Let them drink Ale and be unblest.
27. The way to Woo.
1.
HE that would love, and gladly win
The objected scope of his affections;
Then let him not conceive it is sin
TO attempt the mark by my directions.
2.
The God of love (yon know) is blind,
Therefore cannot impartial be;
The ey's the window of the mind:
And who can p^ize right if not see?
3.
Since then love's partial, and admits
No solid censure in the theme;
Lovers (like Apes) must shape their wits
To turn the blewest milk to cream.
4.
Nor must they want those noble skills
Of Sophistry, whereby to wind
Their waxen words to match the wills,
Not of their own, but Ladies mind.
5.
(...) never so fond thy mistress be,
^ill be thou sure to administer:
though she is pleased with foolery,
^y thou it is wisdom, and assist her.
6.
(...) she is proud, then praise her beauty,
and say thou fanciest her attire;
^onfess a world of needless duty;
^he laws of Love support a liar.
7.
^et all the thundering Eccho's slip
Though she^s the offspring of disgrace)
^^hrough the easy crannies of thy lip,
^er ^eign'd sormosity to blaze.
8.
^f she is wealthy, then adore
^ Her now and then with gifts of cost;
^or if she finds thy present poor,
^he'l sl^ght thee, and thy labor's lost:
9.
And who so foolish to deny
^o set such costly baits as may
^ake fishes, whose validity
Will over and over his cost repay?
10.
Great Jove must not presume to see
^Dana^'s beauty, nor unfold
Her lap, till in her bosom he
Hurls down a shower of gold.
11.
If she be fair, then use to kiss
Her lips (those gates of Paradise;)
Embrace her often, remembering this,
Venus delights in veneries.
12.
When e're she is pleased to smile, although
Its at conceit, yet represent her;
And when she talks, do thou talk too:
Be thou to her as the shade to the center.
13.
Of stubbornness thou must be clear*
That thou may flee at her request:
Stand not at terms, although it were
T'atchieve some plot thou do detest.
14.
Only resist her still in this,
When she persuades thee not to love;
And look thou do it with a kiss,
Affirming thou will never move,
15.
Think nothing scorn that she desires;
For Hercules (have you not heard
The tale?) so glowed in Cupids fires,
That for his Dear he would spin and card.
16.
If then the God of vigor (who
Dislimb'd the Arcadian Boar,
And slew the Snakes of Juno too
That were designed his sides to goar;)
17.
^oopt so submissively, and bent
himself so vile a slave to be:
^oop thou also, and be content;
^or if thou love it suits with thee.
18.
^^st as the Steel does turn unto
^he face of the magnetic power;
^ven in your actions so must you
^cline unto your Paramour.
19.
(...) rhyming fancies rule her brains,
^ccustom thou thy self to sing
^asonian and soft Phrygian strains,
Well mounted on the Cyprian wing.
20.
Make this thy labor, and aspire
^or stuff that may augment the flame;
And soon you will set that breast on fire
Whereto your lovesick arrows aim.
21.
^he foes of Love are stubborn words,
^ad lowering eyes, and lips that pout:
These cut more sharp then sharpest swords,
And put your Ladies unto rout.
28. Tailors.
1.
Tailors and Wood-cocks both agree,
(But not in point of skills)
For both of them (we plainly see)
Do live by their long bills.
2.
The Tailors scrub, the Wood cocks fly;
So both be quick and nimble:
The Wood cock trusts unto his eye;
The Tailor to his thimble.
29. Wisdom.
THou matchless darling of the heavenly race,
Minerva decked and adorned with grace
And sacred beauty: thou that wilt not be
Devirginated by the proudest he
That e're assayed with vigor or with tears:
I have consumed the morning of my years
In wooing thee, yet am as far to win
Thy sacred love, as when I did begin.
I cleav'd the waters like a true Meander;
I sought thee here, and did pursue thee yonder;
Like poor Alphaeus I have followed thee,
But Arethusa thou have proved to me.
I cannot gain thee, neither can I rest
^^ll thou residest in my longing breast.
^ow shall I win thee? how shall I obtain thee?
^hou glorious prize, what shall I do to gain thee?
^hou happy object, thou will not be sold
^or sums of silver, or for heaps of gold.
^he Indian Gems, or Neptunes Corals be
^f no esteem, of no validity
^o win this Paragon. It Is only Jove
that keeps her seated in his tower above,
that can procure her me; therefore I Will pray
^ato the King of Heaven, that I may
^e wise: Thou mover of Celestial motion,
Attend to my petition and devotion:
Thee I appeal to, under whose protection
Remains the Mistress of my best affection.
^ am in love, the object is thy daughter:
^ong have I wooed, and longer have I sought her;
^ong have I wished, and labored to obtain her;
But my ignoble person cannot gain her.
Do thou therefore be pleased to infuse
My breast with her; do thou assist my Muse
With heavenly wisdom; for she will never be
Attained for me, if not infused by thee.
30. The Mind.
WHose mind shall I decipher? whose intent
Shall I now shadow out, or represent?
My own I cannot* And I think it is vain
To tell another's in a Dorick strain
Of my invention. Minds are so unstable,
That we may title them incomparable.
No art can shape them, they are so temporary,
That e're a thought can reach them they will va^^
Strange things they be; and who so e're intends
To tell a mind, what e're it comprehends
Must also treat of. And this theme's too ample
To be expounded, or admit example:
Both Earth and Heaven, Hell, Faith, Hope, and (...)
Yea, every creature is contained therein.
Have you e'e noted a prodigious cloud
In apparition; like a man? endowed
With manly members? and the same appear
In the next moment, like a shagged bear;
Then (moved by Aeol^^) anon she shapes
Her sable vapor to some Jack an apes.
This shows the mind in part, but (pray observe)
This Cloud in Lands kips Zeuxes well might carv^
But the deformed Centaures that abide
Within the mind, cannot be typ^fi^d.
Suppose Ap^lles brings his Pensils out,
Prepares his sundry paints, and goes about
TO attempt the thing, he will come as far behind,
As though he were to Manacle the wind.
Alas, Man knows it not: and who can paint
A shadow of the thing he is ignorant?
Surely these knowing times and you scarce find
A man that rightly knows his own mind.
31. The Interruption.
CAn I not wanton once a day
In her dark night-enlightning ray,
(...) the pale foes of Love must be
^^par'd to bark and bite at me?
^^n we not spend an hour or two
^hen we have nothing else to do)
(...) Amorous actions, bobs, and chocks,
and twisting fingers in our locks,
^^nerian glances, smiles and kisses,
and such true harmless mirth as this is:
^^t on a sudden, there must be
^^e clownish boars of enmity
^nt to di^termine and divide us,
^^nd be as rough as though the had spied us
^ike Zimri and his mate) compact,
and joined in some uncivil act?
(...) these are clowns, and ru^tick fools,
that never were taught loves golden rules:
and like the Dog that will not eat,
^or let the Ox lick up the meat.
^hou God of Love, where e're thou art,
from these defend us with thy dart;
^^nd thou thy bow, and use thy charms,
While I am rampant in her arms.
32. The Requital.
ANd why did Rose incur such trouble,
As to reciprocate (this bubble)
A ring to him, who only sent
To her the vulgar complement
That Lovers to their Ladies send,
Or that which friend may do to friend?
Nor did I lard it with such words
As wanton feigned love affords.
It was no god of steel, entombed
With golden phrases; nor persum'd
With powdered oaths: The Herald knows
'T was only thus, My love to Rose.
And now my Rose upon this score,
Returns a Ring; what need I more?
I but alas, I cannot flatter,
Her love I value more then the matter
Expressing it; though she presented
Me with this Ring, I Am not contented
So much as though her lips should move
Thus, pray salute him with my Love.
I, here is a token, if bu^ true,
What pleasure might from hence accrue?
This is a wealth would please me more
Then all the gold oth' Indian shore:
I weigh not gold, when I remember
That glowing spark, that secret ember,
That true Idalea^ coal that burns
Rose's breast, and freely turns
(...) me (its Magnet;) this is joy,
^e sum of my felicity.
therefore sweet Herald, use to bring
^ve Letters rather then a Ring;
^^ough love by tokens is expressed,
^et of all tokens love's the best.
33. The Dream.
1.
LAst night my senses being locked,
Food Briz^ came and boldly knock^
Against my fancy gate:
and in her wanton arms she brought
As with a strong desire I thought)
The Empress of my fate.
2.
^ho blu^hing stood before my face
(...) As t^were expecting my embrace)
Her bosom being nak't:
^hen Panick fear, and pleasant hope
At once into my spirits crope,
And moved me till I quak't*
3.
(...) moved this query in my breast;
(...) Rose in earnest or in jest?
The Jury proved it she.
^hen I with furious faith begun
Toward this glorious prize to run;
But reason bridled me.
4.
Stay, stay, (she said) there is no reason
Thou should fall on, for it is treason;
Therefore bold youth return:
But love, which reason does exceed,
Nay stronger then my self indeed,
So furiously did burn
5.
Within the chimney of my breast,
That I was quite bereft of rest,
Till in my arms I felt her;
Then with a vigorous haste I rushe
Upon the girl (who wept and blushed)
Thinking to have purchased shelter.
6.
But when I came into the station
(With equity pray poize my passion)
Where she appeared to me,
I found a stock which neither moved
Its bulk, nor breathed; alas it proved
Her shape, it was not she,
34. The Change.
I Once thought solace had been bound to serve
My will for ever, 'cause she used to carve
Such mellow morcels to my sense, when I
^^t at the table of mine infancy.
^hen first I entered on this mortal stage,
^ ^halleng'd peace and pleasure as my page;
(...) heart swom light, cleaving the glorious seas
(...) consolation, bliss, content and ease,
^ith such fair gales, that I thought common pleasure
^as mine successively, my fathers treasure
which he transferred to me* but now I find
^is as apt to vary as the wind.
^hen I was lulled in the indulgent arms
^f my dear nurse, and tickled by her charms,
^new no doubt, nor did I fear the danger
^f future chance; bad fortune was a stranger
unto my sense; I little thought to see
^he dismal furies now tormenting me.
^^te promised fairly, when she used to bring
^ach hour a mess to me well rellishing.
^ut now her bounty is so poor and slender,
that I can guess her but a mere pretender.
^ut let her do her worst. now I assure ye,
^weet Sack has set me up above her fury.
35. The Mistake.
^TVVas long of Midas who inspired
Me with partiality, and injured
My clearer judgment, else I had
^ot made loves Archery so bad;
Again to me my darts did glide*
Too too sublimely, and too wide.
I levelled with mine eyesight aim
Toward the center of a Dame,
Whom fortune had with dowries blessed,
And sanctity it self expressed;
Whom natures seal had signed pretty,
And noble practice proved her witty.
All these I aimed at, and I thought
To have ensnared them, and have caught
Them for my prey; but she denied,
And when I shot she slipped aside;
When I said I, she answered no,
And would not bend unto my bow:
When ere I urged her to explain
Her mind, she pinch't me with disdain.
No smiles, but frownings waited on
Her sharp responses, whereupon
I did commence to ruminate,
If these were not the signs of hate.
And in my search I proved these
To be the true Antipodes
To my intent: then did I pause
Upon this hate-producing cause
In this fair object. But the quest
Of reason sitting in my breast,
Did soon convince my faith of this,
That my love-darts were shot amiss.
Herein (said they) your folly lies:
You aimed at her, and she was wise;
Therefore in vain your darts incline,
^rudence with folly will not join.
36. The Encomium.
MY mind has moved me often to praise
Rosella's beauty, but her rays
Recalled my Muses, and enjoined
My well and ill prepared mind
^o curb these praises, ere they sprung
from my soft quill, or softer tongue.
for reason (not the prop alone,
But Basis wisdom stands upon)
Has re-inform'd me that she lack't
No verbal or external act
^o patch her cheeks with, or repair
The tresses of her golden hair.
Where all the fuel is on fire,
There needs no breath to raise it higher.
A stomach filled with dainty meats
Disgests not what it after eats.
Then pardon ( Rose) my silent quill,
Which fancies not to superfill
Your theme with praises, which you neither
Desire, wi^h, want or fancy either.
^le not describe thy crimson blush;
Joves purest Nectar needs no bush:
But I will praise the courser sort
That need it, and will thank me for it.
37. Three Friends.
1.
THeer certain friends (whom fortune did exp^
To many harms and dangers,
And circumvented with a world of foes;
Some neighbors, others strangers,)
2.
Well blessed with vigor, and prepared with arms,
And sted fastly conjoined
With resolution to oppose all harms,
With one entire mind.
3.
(Their minds thus melted into one) they went
With fury, to resist
Each stop that stood their projects to prevent,
And each Antagonist.
4.
Nor did success prove poorer unto these,
Then't was fore-doom'd to do:
For many a one they shackled by degrees,
And many a one they slew.
5.
Nor did their thirsty swords forbear to spill
The vitals of their foes;
Nor sheath their bloody jaws in scabbards, till
There was no more to oppose.
6.
Now all is won, and every prize their own,
The trine is sweetly blessed
All the extinsick trouble being gone)
With native peace and rest*
7.
^ut pride (the darling of good fortune) sprung
(Armed with desire of strife)
^hese glorious Champions, and these friends among;
And spoiled their friendly life.
8.
Nor would it vanish, till it had untwisted
The knots once love had ti'd;
And now each friend his bosom-friend resisted,
till they were all destroyed.
The Moral.
THese trusty friends three Nations were, well known
To be subordinate to a single Crown;
And while they loved, the world could not outvie them;
But their intestin hate did soon destroy them.
Intrinsic strife, and home bred contradiction,
Are the next road to ruin and affliction.
38 The Apology.
Do thou admire to see my rhimes,
Accost thine eyes so oftentimes?
Pray tell me, can the tender lambs
Forget to bleat unto their dams?
Or can the babe refrain its tongue
To wag to her from whence it sprung?
Can it withhold its childish strife
From her that did indow't with life?
No, no, it cannot; neither will
My muse be silent, nor my quill
Refrain its chattering unto you,
From whom my Muses breath accrue.
Had your refulgent rays never shone
(With instigative power) upon
My dull Urania, she had been
Unknown, unskilful, and unseen.
Often your own luster did inspire
Me with an active power, and then
(Like souls) shall I not turn again
To my Creator? mark the flame,
Ascends not it from whence it came?
No wonder then if you behold
My Muses often to be so bold
To buz beneath your eye-beams, seeing
You are the author of their being.
39. The Encouragement.
1.
WHat power affronts our zeal, or who shall stand
As a sad Gnomon 'twixt thy self and me?
Art thou not mine? and do thou not command
^e at thy pleasure by authority?
Since then our hearts are linked, who shall prevent
Or break the tenets of our true intent?
2.
^e thou but loyal, and it is no matter
though I be carbonado'd for thy sake;
though our beleaguerers many a time shall b^tter
that Crystal Tower of thine, yet they shall take
No inward prize, nor 'twixt us interpose;
Be but our hearts true, and we will fear no foes.
3.
^e not too much dejected, though the art forced
To wait and linger for loves full repast.
The more our stomachs long, the more they fast,
The dearer will our dainties be at last.
The longer a hot fever in thee burns,
The sweeter is thy health when it returns.
4.
Then banish doubtings of division, from
The promontories of thy silver breast,
(Those fair Belconies of Elysium,
Where Heaven's Nectar and Ambrosia rest)
Each crabbed Guerdion, by his purest arts,
Shall but divide our bodies, not our hearts.
40. The request to walk.
SOl has prepared every grove,
Fit mansions for retired love.
Come let us walk therein, and see
Which shine the brightest, they or thee.
Come, come, there is no secret spy,
No bastard of Antipathy
To Cupids Cordials, that may leere
Among the whistling trees, to hear
Our soft discourses, and there is
None to upbraid us when we kiss.
The feathered train will gladly sing,
And in their order they will bring
Fresh warbling Sonnets, and advance
Their mellow Music, while we dance
To their serene and sprightly charms,
With hand in hand, and arms in arms.
Speak then, where shall we dance a round?
On Sylvan's floor, or Ceres ground?
Or with Priapus shall we play?
Speak now, and choose the best you may.
The Answer.
THe thorny backed and rough Sylvanus
Shall not refresh nor entertain us:
Nor withered Ceres, 'cause the plow
Has made long furrows on her brow:
But it is Priapus I desire;
There we will play until we tire.
41. The self-che^k.
MY chaster Muses freely are inclined,
To wish thee to be wary:
Lest by temptation, thou should be enjoined
(Like Cloris) to miscarry.
But pardon me, I doubt not in the least.
Because you would not fall at my request.
42. The Advice.
1.
I Am big-belli'd with desire
To court thine ears with admonition,
Left thou art melted by the fire
Of such as unto thee petition
2.
To crop thy Virgin blooms, and then
Will leave the branches bare and base:
Of such licentious greedy men
As leave poor Ladies in disgrace;
3.
Who ( Jason-like) will never spare
To spoil the cask, so they can get
What Jewels it includes rare;
Even for the Gem spoil the Cabinet.
4.
Attend not to Mercurian lips,
Gay raiment, or Atalanta's balls,
If once thy foot in public slip,
Thousands will lurk to give thee falls.
5.
And this sage counsel I bequeath
You for your good, because I see,
By the inticement of a breath,
Yon fell so gently down for me.
43 The Blush.
WEll may she sigh and blush to see
My love-dri'd cheeks how pale they be.
For her light love, and lean reward
Of my affection, leans so hard
Upon my vitals, that it strains
The crimson tincture from my veins,
And leaves my cheeks to be the right
Type of the Lady of the night.
But stay fond Muses, sure you err,
She wrongs not you, but you wrong her.
For if the slender Love that freez'd
In torid Zone of her, had squeezed
The tincture from my cheeks, sure then
She would have gilded those again,
By the continual blush and blaze
That darts (like Paean) from her rays.
Her tongue's the mintage, I the coin;
And as she speaks, this heart of mine
(...) formed, as the signets be
To wax, so are thy words to me:
^f then her words can wrest my nature,
Her blush may burnish my dull feature.
(...), but the weakness of her love
Does still persuade her to remove,
And vail her cheeks: so that the cause
Which from my face the tincture draws,
Does also hinder and debar
My pined visage from repair.
Why then suppose thy self a fly,
So may thou buz beneath her eye;
Then her hot eyes or fragrant breath
May scortch or stifle me to death.
Oh that were best of all! it is better fate
To die Loves Martyr, then to live in hate.
44. The Protest.
1.
LAdy, let not a tear trickle down or appear
In your eye,
To conceive I should leave
My affecting of you till I die.
2.
May the Bell never toll as a foy to my soul
When it flies
From its urn, to return
To the place whence it came, over the skies.
3.
May the Sun never shine on this forehead of mine
While I breath,
If that I e're deny
To adore and to love thee till death.
4.
May the horrible itch, or the ghost of a witch Torture me
If I prove to remove
My engagements (fair Lady) from thee.
5.
But why should I speak, that have no force to bre^^ My design?
For as well may I sell
My own life, as forbear to be thine.
6.
Can the water remove from beneath to above Without art?
No, you know it cannot so.
No more can I alter my heart.
7.
Can the day light go out, while the Sun goes about
In the Sphere?
No, you know 't cannot so:
No more can my zeal to my Dear.
8.
The art Queen of my soul, and have force to controu^ Each decree:
For alas! even as
Steel to the Loadstone, so I am to thee.
9.
^nce then there is no force can divide or divorce
Us in twain,
^hrow aside peevish pride,
^hile I kiss thee again and again.
10.
^t us wantonly play, kiss and clip while we may,
Without scorn;
^r if we merry be
^ver night, I Will not leave thee in the morn.
45. The Item.
WHat I always grumbling, always whining?
Still suming, raving, and repining?
that ails my brat to be so pettish,
^o cross, so peevish, and so frettish?
^urst Cur, what makes thee thus? I say,
^hy wearest thou thy self away
^n macerating envies wheel?
that inward mover do thou feel?
^r is it ought that dwells in me
that does extort thy voice and thee?
^ure then I Will say, and yet I will not flout thee,
^he Devil's in thee, or thy wit's without thee.
46. The Maids Soliloquie.
1.
YOu Virgins of the Queen of Lovers,
Come and consult with me a while;
Help me to chase this bird that hovers
About my breast, into exile.
Show me a way
Whereby I may.
In stead of sighing, take delight to smile.
2.
What though he is gone, in wrath departed?
Shall I for ever more lament?
No, I will not be so faint-hearted;
It shall not cause me to repent,
Though he has left
Me, and bereft
Me of his love, yet I have my content.
3.
When in his arms I was confined,
A jealous frenzy vexed my brain;
And I each moment was enjoined
To feel the sting of Cupids pain:
For then I thought I had been caught*
But now my heart's become mine own again.
4.
If it were needful I should marry;
I need not labor for a lad;
But I will rather choose to tarry,
^est some should think that I were mad:
For when I wed,
My joys are fled,
And all my good days will be turned to bad.
5.
And since his absence greatly cases
Me of my sorrows and my care,
^ray let him wander where he pleases,
And not return till I despair:
The which shall be
When you shall see
Both Towns and Castles builded in the air.
47. The Dialogue.

About Rosella's head?

Thy heart lies fettered.

(Like Eurus cheek) so red?

Where modesty is bred.

In her bright eyes like Pearl?

Flew daily from the girl.

When I accost her beams?

Thy sight by their extremes.

So often change and vary?

To wish you to be wary.

Then Coral, or the Rubie?

For thou art but a boobie.

Wherein the truth of this is?

Them by your moistning kisses.

And pray what is their duty?
(...) Why feeble art is here expressed
^ wait on natures beauty.
(...) What mean her hands to look so white,
^ though they were (...) snow?
^ This shows that love it cold and light,
which in her heart does grow.
and youth thou lie, and it is but thy pretense,
^an refute thee by experience.
48. The Times.
1.
MY heart, alas, is ever dying,
And yet is never dead.
^ke ful-lblown Dames I lie out-crying,
Yet am not brought to bed.
2.
^alm, they say, succeeds a storm;
Alas, why I believe it:
^d good it also chac't by harm,
Which daily lurks to grieve it:
3.
(...) some unhappy news to day
Tranquillitie's exiled:
^d all my joys consume away;
^d thus I am beguiled.
4.
Perhaps anon this rigid act
Is by the court repealed:
And then I am with pleasures backed,
And all my wounds are ^^l'd.
5.
But this is that which never endures
Above a day at most:
Some cruel jog does lance my cures,
And all my joys are lost.
6.
To day here is murder, the^^ to morrow,
And scandal he comes after:
These are the grounds of wise men's sorrow,
Bat to the foolish, laughter.
7.
Here Is Tereus bedded with his sister
In The midst of all the throng;
And when he had defiled and kissed her,
He robbed her of her tongue.
8.
Here Is Irus hanged for stealing bread,
Though robbed of his arrears:
And here is Croesus perjured,
Yet he can keep his ears.
9.
Here is Lycaon fiercely slaying
His guests, and yet goes free:
And here are Saints in Temples praying,
And ill designed as he.
10.
^ere's Z^ilus railing at the times,
As though he did detest them:
^et notwithstanding Z^ilus rhimes,
He closely can digest them.
11.
^or need he rail at them so much;
For they would never be
^o wicked, were it not for such
Unconstant fools as he.
49. Put the case,
IF Whores and Rogues were linked together,
'Twould be a brave conjunction;
And oyled with the oil of leather,
'Twould be a curious unction.
^f Mars shall move in Venus sphere,
What alteration might we fear?
2.
^f I should love and be neglected,
What would become of me?
^f the French Pox had thee infected,
What would become of thee?
^f Cupid cuts Alceste's Corns,
May not Admetus fear the Horns?
3.
^f Time with his long sith should mow
Death down, and make him die:
Then Reader but imagine, oh
What blades were thee and I?
If this were so, in stead of peace,
Both men and malice would increase,
4.
If the first mover of the Orbs
Should chance to fall asleep,
The Scottish Knight, Sir Arthur Forbs,
Could hardly shear his Sheep.
Or if Apollo close his eye,
What light would you see Planets by?
5.
If thou and I were both as one,
Endowed with worldly riches,
If thou keep Whores, and I keep none,
Who first might pawn his breechts?
If Nimrod steals Diana's Deer,
Has not Apollo cause to fear?
50. The Ramble.
GO home loose thoughts, y' have seen enough*
Your pleasure's burnt unto a snuff:
What you conceived your lasting prize,
Now proves a vapor in disguize.
Now you have rambled out your swing,
You find the world is no such thing
As you supposed, when you were wont
Only to stand and gaze upon it.
^ow many friendships were professed?
^ow many fawners did contest
^o wait on me, while I was stayed,
and kept me close unto my trade?
^h what pretenses, what a brood
^f promises to do me good!
^hese puffed me up, and did invite
^y fancy to some fresh delight;
^hought I, I Will try the world, and see
^ starting out will better me;
^e change the course of my estate,
And fall upon some newer fate.
Oh foolish brain! though some indeed
^eek out new fortunes, it is for need;
When the old's so poor 'twill not maintain them,
^hen to seek out it does constrain them.
^ut he that is fixed well, he is worse
^hen mad, in altering of his course;
^he follie's mine. Abroad I went,
And many a silver spill I spent,
And I was welcome while it lasted;
But being gone my pleasure blasted:
And they that courted me before
unto their favors, now give over,
And have so molded their condition,
That they regard not my petition:
While I had silver, there would be
No want of good society,
Such pleasant words did me assail
As use to court men iuto Jail*
I was a sweet young man, they said,
And did deserve as sweet a maid.
Bless him and's fortunes, prudent youth*
And I must be a Saint forsooth.
Pox take their Worships, but no matter,
This Ramble makes my knowledge fatter.
I find all pleasures are but vain;
Therefore I will go home again.
51. The Desertion.
WAs I bewitch't or drunk when I essayed
To change my function, and forsake the tr^^^
The sacred trade of Nectar, which maintains
Our consolation, and supplies our brains
With springs of Wit; and fall into the sphere
Of sollen Ale, and sense-afflicting Beer?
Was e're such folly acted in our school?
Could e're good fellowship breed such a fool?
But stay a little, let me plead excuse,
Else I am lavish in my own abuse:
'Twas not the Beer alone invoked me hither;
But 'twas the Widow and the Beer together.
The Wine inflamed my spirits, and it is common
When Nectar's regent, to accost a woman.
But soon the woman did my fancy tire,
And then again for Wine was my desire.
Hence we may note that women, in the taste,
Suffice our will, such pleasures will not last
love a night or two; but he that uses
^streams of Wine to mollify his Muses,
^never cloyed (his solace knows no sorrow)
^r he that is drunk to day loves Wine to morrow.
52. Adonibezeck,
GOod deeds deserve requitals, and the men
That strike unjustly, must be struck again
With their own weapons; and from hence it comes*
that proud Adonibezeck lost his Thumbs.
53. Donec eris foelix.
1.
WHat peevish planet did the heavens sway
When I was born? what star did rule the day
Of my untimely birth? it neither lends
Me wealth nor friends.
2.
Why was I born? wherefore did not my mother
Comply with death? death, why did thou not smother
Me in that womb? then had my body been
At rest unseen.
3.
Unnatural father, why did thou deny
To leave me maintenance? could thou not buy
Some grand fee-simple? had thou but done so,
I Would known no foe.
4.
Had this been done, no question but thy son
(Whose state proud Fortune now derides) had w^
The day of triumph, and advanced his same,
And fathers name.
5.
Why did thou give me learning? why did thou
Not bring me up to labor at the plow?
This is the road to riches, to other brings
Contrary things.
6.
Carnal discretion tells me, had I bent
My youth to purvey for emolument,
I had been happy in the thing which sends
Both same and friends.
7.
But now (poor abject) I must needs incline
To friends: O Croesus, if I were but thine,
'Twere great encouragement; Oh let me be
Partner with thee.
8.
But stay a little, I must not intrude
Into his secret Counsels, he will exclude
My sense from thence, and charge me to be gone
To H^licon*
9.
I want an equal portion to compare
With his vast treasure, he will never care
To entertain me, if I cannot swim
In wealth with him.
10.
^ must forsake his dainties, and go feed
^y fond desires on the barren weed
^^at's on Parnassus; there is my pleasure, there
Lies all my cheer.
11.
(...) hold my Muse. I Will lock thee in my trunk,
^st they that see thee say my Muse is drunk:
^rown not thy self with madness, thou can rise
Above the skies.
12.
^ck is thy sustenance, did ever know
Bacchanalian vapor sink so low
^s sorrow dwells? no misery can be
Known unto thee.
13.
^et must I pity those unhappy boys
That juggle with Maecenas for the bays
^f vain applause; whose lottery is to lie
In misery.
14.
^it they have plenty, but we seldom know
When wit and riches both together flow
^n the same font; Fate (mortals ticklish guide)
Does them divide.
15.
Your waxen-winged verses will dissolve
^n time of want; then censure will revolve
Your fame in the bowels of contempt, and drowned
You, once renowned.
16.
Are you in prison? tell me can you pierce
The gates and wickets by a measured verse?
Can your own fancy bail you, can you be
For crimes set free?
17.
Where Is all your friends? perhaps one says I kno^ hi^
I Have seen his person, I have read his Poem.
All wish him well, but which man goes about
To help him out?
18.
But now you Poets, if you would have friends,
First learn ye to be happy, else your ends
Are all in vain; and when you happy be,
Remember me.
54. The Soldier and his Mistress.
So. HArk, hark (my Paragon) the trumpet sound^
The foaming horse come pra^^^ over the ground
The noise of battle in my ear rebounds.
2.
Arm, arm, brave Hectors, the Centurions cry,
Advance, advance your weapons or you die;
Which horrid noise will break our Sympathy.
3.
Mist. No, no, it needs not, shall the horrid swarm^
Of men and horse allure thee by their charms,
To leave my fleshly for thy martial arms?
4.
^ing closer then, for thou shall not depart
from me this night in person, or in heart;
^rm not, for thou in arms already art:
5.
And the art engage'd unto the harmless fight
^f wanton Cupid, where (this following night)
^e'l both be conquered, conquered with delight.
6.
Our smiles shall be our arrows, and our eyes
Are Stratagems, sufficient to surprise
Thoughts of dissension and Antipathies.
7.
Each blow will beg another, and 't will ease us;
^uch contestations cannot choose but please us:
And such a quarrel greatly will appease us.
8.
Brave war and harmless! oh who would deny
To be a soldier in it? who would not die
In such a battle, such artillery?
9.
Sold. I, but I dare not; if my Captain find
Me in your quarters, no excuse will blind
His rigid sentence, and his furious mind.
10.
Mist. There Is none shall find thee, for I Will vail thy face
And body too, with the embroidered case
Of my rich blanket, where we will embrace.
11.
My smock shall shroud thee, and my hand shall guide thee
From whatso^'re disa^ter shall betide thee,
In The bus^^ on my bel^y I will hide thee.
12.
Or if he find thee, I will (...) than,
That he is armed (let him say what he can)
To ruin mortals, thou to make a man.
55. The Exclamation.
SInce 't was thy beauty that begun
This servent ^rdor in my breast,
Make it, my grief-expelling sun,
That wretched I may take some rest.
I burn, I burn 'twixt the extremes
Of fear and hope, and thy bright beam^.
2.
One heat another may unthrone;
Then wonder not if I desire
(Who scorching lies in the torrid Zone)
Your forehead to expel my fire.
Oh smile, and let my heart not lie
Broyl'd on the grid irons of thine eye.
3.
Ice (fires foe) laid to the skin
That Is burnt, will c^use the ^lesh to turn
Into a bl^ste^, and within
With greater (...) to burn:
O Iey heart, then be not so,
I would bring additions ^o my wo^*
4.
^^^ange kind of creature, whose clear eye
(...) scorch and burn like Luna's brother;
^d yet her heart in Ice does lie,
^r self does freeze, yet burns another*
^e torrid and the frigid Zone
^ite their temper^ both in one.
5.
^en let thine eye thy heart reflect
^on, and soon the Ice will perish;
^^d then thy heart will me affect,
^^d with enlivening flames me cherish!
^ow I lie gasping, and I saint
^r want of thee, my lovely Saint.
6.
^^ou art that tree whereon is found
(...) ^trange and double-natur'd power;
^e one is bitterly to wound,
^e other sweetly is to cure.
^^d since the first on me have pa^^,
^^me now and cure me with the last,
7.
(...) furious flame! alas I fry,
^^d cannot damp the heat with water;
(...) ^^srcture reels, and I must die,
(...) beauty brings me not her daughter.
^oss and turn, and cannot rest:
^is Juniper flames within my breast.
8.
^ome lively, soul, let us symphathize
In love and arms, and be not loath;
Let me behold in thy bright eyes
Nareissus and Adouis both.
Were but thy heart as hot as mine.
I should find pleasure to calcine.
9.
Poor beauty-strucken soul, I have
No consolation in the world,
Unless thy bounty dain to save
Me from those plagues upon me hurled:
Thou art that spell, and only thee
That charmest all my misery.
10.
Come sacred Doctress then, and act
Thy energy and power on me:
A word of thine (with Cupid backed)
Is medicine enough to be
Deaths Antidote, and to control
The ecstasy wherein I roll.
56. The Invitation to Marry.
PUt on ( Rosella) ride not with delay,
It Is full of danger; all-devouring time
Brings things (in time) to ruin and decay.
Enjoy thy pleasure now it is thy prime;
All things unused quickly are decayed,
And for the lack of use are useless made.
2.
^bserve an house that is not inhabited,
^ow soon swift time makes pock-holes in the walls:
^bserve a cage, from whence the bird is fled,
^ow soon it is cobweb'd, and to ruin falls.
^h let not ( Rose) thy wanton white and red,
^or want of wanton use be withered.
3.
Thou art the ( Rose the Queen of every flower)
And if in time thou art not choicely taken,
Thou will decline, and lose thy fragrant power;
And thy fresh cheeks of beauty be forsaken:
Then take this counsel, let it not be known
^o rare a Rose should languish all alone.
4.
Make me thy Tenant, and let me inherit
This curious Joynter: let thy youthful age
^e kept for me, to me do you transfer it.
^le be the Bird too if you will be the Cage,
^le keep the house, as it is, and you shall see
No alteration in the Cage shall be.
5.
The Rose is even ripe, and fit to gather;
Here is a hand shall pluck it if you please:
Let it not stand, left time and stormy weather
Shall blanch its virtue, and make beauty cease;
Resign it now, reserve it not until
It Is neither fit for scent, nor to distill.
6.
Let Us love no longer single, but enjoy
The true Elysiun^ which our Wedlock brings,
And let us feed on that fel^city
Where of the silly Dove of Venus sings;
Die not a Virgin, lest survivers tell.
Rose is departed to loud Apes in hell.
57. The ^reeminence.
ALas what is Phoebus? I did never
Stand trembling to behold his light,
As I have often done to her;
He shines in the day, she day and night:
His glory can but dull mine eyes,
But in her luster my heart fries;
Then tell me where most power lies?
2.
Pale-faced Diana can but show
A crazy countenance, but my Rose
Has full-grown beauty, clear and true:
Her heavenly brow no blemish knows;
Yet in Lucina you may see
Apparent spots, pray then tell me
Which is most bright, the Moon or she.
3.
Though Aetna's mountain fiercely fries
With burning Sulphur, yet alas,
Rosella with her piercing eyes,
Its Calenture does far ^rpass;
The flames that issue from that urn,
things at a distance will not burn;
A man may see'^ and safe return.
4.
But whosoever on Rose shall cast
A fixed eye, he is burned by her.
And he that shall her beauty taste,
Must needs be hurled into loves fire;
His breast is stricken by a glance,
Her fatal look's a sad mischance,
And leaves the viewer in a trance.
5.
The virtuous Loadstone, though it is
The Map^of wonders, ye^ I say
^he can effect as great as his,
By her sweet reason^ quelling ray:
This draws my knife to it, that my heart
Let reason then to me impart,
^n which of these lies greatest art?
6.
The stone which the Philosopher
Approves for virtue. comes behind
The stronger force that dwells in her
(As by experience I can find;)
With this his stone (poor mortal) he
Can but turn things to gold, but she
Makes mirth of sowrest misery.
7.
Then what is Phoebus? may not be
Confess his weakness to his shame?
And what is Luna? may not she
Withdraw her face, and do the same?
The Load stone and Philosopher,
And Aetna, all must know they err,
And all pay tribute unto her.
50. The Drollery.
1.
LIke the rich jewels of a jeaks,
Or like a Millstone fri'd in steaks,
Or like the Elbow of a Bat,
Or like a Presbyterian Rat:
Just such is he that called my Mistress Madam,
Ten thousand years before the days of Adam.
2.
Like a red herring dressed in coats,
Or like a flea that feeds on oats,
Or like a louse that can speak French,
Or like a whorish honest wench:
Such is that mortal whose discretion can
Both rob and cheat, yet be an honest man.
3.
Like Tadpoles that must ride in Coaches,
Or like the leaden wings of Loaches,
Or Humble-Bees in leathern jackets,
Or true men's hands in Harlots plackckets:
Such is that goodly Squire, whose intent
Is to build Churches when his money's spent.
4.
Just like a Beard that is lined with plush,
Or like a three-leg'd Holly-bush,
Or like the Vine that bears Cider,
Or like the Cloak-bag of a Spider:
Just such is he that took a Gun, and shot
Quite through the shoulder of his Chamber Pot.
5.
Like a Sirreverence lapt in Lawn,
Or like a sword that never was drawn,
Or furious Whiskin burnt to coals,
Or men that live without their souls:
Such Croesus is, that would no: line his breeches.
Nor get his wife with child, for fear on's riches.
6.
Like one that sees though he be blind,
Or the fore-horse that comes behind,
Or like a freeborn Bastard brat,
Or like I know not who nor what:
Just such is he that falling sick of sorrow,
Was buried yesterday, and di'd tomorrow.
59. Love beyond Reason.
I Love to sport above her eye,
I love her well, but know not why.
I love her smell, I love her taste,
I love to twist about her waste:
I love her sound, I love her touch;
The active power of love is such
That for my Mistress I could die,
And yet in troth I know not why:
I searched her soul to see what merit
Was there, and found none did inherit
To reason for a rudiment,
Upon this scrutiny I went,
Where the cause of love I did detect,
Not her desert, but my defect:
Or thus more plainly runs the rule;
I loved her cause I was a fool.
60. In the Garden.
1.
Rosella did but look
Upon the Milk-white Rosy bushes,
And presently each Rose forsook
Their white, and Vapor'd in Rosella's blushes.
2.
She did but cast her eye
Upon the blew-lipt Lavanders,
And presently they did defy
Their own complexion, and did boast of hers.
3.
The virid Marjoram
Her sparkling beauty did but see,
And presently their green became
All di'd which Sc^ries, blushing, red as she.
4.
And when it is my delight
My perished beauty to renew,
Then I accost her, whose first sight
Then turns my pale cheeks to a crimson hue.
5.
Brave Artist, then I Will sue
Philosophers no more, to know
Their Elixar; it is all in you,
Proved by experience wheresoere you go.
61. A Kiss.
1.
A Way false fear,
And come not here.
Cheer up brave thoughts, and grow
In strength, fall not below
Your quality; alas, the assumption
Of one poor kiss was no presumption;
No, none at all, sweet-lips you did not err,
There was no treason in saluting her,
2.
Where you before
Had thousands more
Without repulse or frown.
No, (wanton girl) it is known
Thou have not only loved the sport,
But waited and endeavored for it.
I Have seen thee active to inflame the blisses
That are ingender'd by the game of kisses.
3.
Wherefore I Will draw
From Cupids Law,
That Custom might have claimed
Its right, and never framed
The least Apology; nor stood
Poring upon the Optative mood.
Yet she, forsooth, not only stayed the use,
But tells me the attempt is an abuse.
4.
But sinner, sure
Thou needst not woo her
To pass such errors by
With an indulgent eye:
Thou needst not blush where there is no fault,
He needs no crutch that never did hault.
Cast off thy care, set sorrows on the score,
Since she repulst thee once, never kiss her more.
62. Hero.
VVOe is me that fall!
Woe is me that perish!
Genius tell me, whither shall
I repair for one to cherish
My declining soul, and condole
My distress? Oh pity! yonder
Swims the Skeleton of Leander:
^d then she sighed, and then she wept,
^d in a passion then she stepped
aside
the remorseless waves, and then she died.
63. The Ruin.
1.
Wish that I had never known thee;
Oh that I could not dote upon thee,
Nor adore
^^y alluring lips and eyes
To which my wanton fancy flies)
Any more!
2.
^y enchanting grace and beauty
To which Adonis ows a duty)
Have inshrin'd
^eep within that fatal chest
^f thy yet unrelenting breast
All my mind.
3.
^t is reason thou should carry
The Penal burden which burglary
Does require;
^or thy penetrating ray
Has broke my house, and stolen away
My desire.
4.
Gentle thief thou ha^t undone me,
If thou wile not reflect upon me,
I must go
Unto the dead, then for my sake
Restore my heart again, or take
Me also.
65. Good Liquor.
1.
LOve, envy, rage, and fury rest,
And secretly repose,
Like hood-wink^ Falcons in my breast,
Until the Ocean flows:
For want of quaffing cups you die,
And are as ill prepared as I.
2.
I Will feast you with my rhymes no more,
When once I cease to tipple;
When er'e you bar the Cellar door,
My Muse becomes a cripple.
As Luna (void of Sol) may wink,
So Clio must for want of drink.
3.
Nor is it your Al^ and musty Beer
That procreates my phrases.
It Is Wine that makes my Ela clear,
And worthy of your praises.
beasts (but Asses) love to choose
^ best of grass, and worst refuse.
4.
^ not your Wine that is mixed and blended
With this and that receipt;
^t's first decayed, and then amended;
From such I must retreat.
Heavens Nectar I incline,
bright Apollo's rasie Wine.
66. The Air.
1.
Weet sounds that issue from the Quire
Of winged Musicians, or the Thracian Lyre,
Be dumb, repose your Knells,
You warbling shrill-mouth'd Philomels.
Your tones extort my tears,
Your music seems unto my ears,
(...) Vrsus to the eye appears.
2.
^uses, whose charms are Musket-proof
^ passive power, you may stand aloof;
Whose active charms can draw
Waters from mountains, and unthaw
A flinty breast, you be
Of no more value unto me
Then Butter flies to Broom-men be.
3.
Sing to the woods, and silvered brooks;
I neither like your Sonnets, nor your looks.
Court fools as may affect
Your dissonanting dialect:
My Lute's more clear and choice,
Wherein I only can rejoice:
It is Rosella's heavenly voice.
67. Time. The Interpreter.
WHat serious students with their busied b^
Could never unlock; what Philosophic p^
Tried, and fell short of: what strong art never ^
What was a theme too hard for the Alchymist:
What mighty Merlin in his operation,
Fore sight, Prediction, and prognostication,
Could not unroll, Time has now detected:
Yet still he is dispes'd, and dis-respected:
There Is no man crowns him with a wreath of p^
Composed of Laurel triumph, though his ways
Are rules of truth; while error boldly draws
Worlds of applause to her insatiate claws.
Infected Animals, how are ye blinded
With misty judgments? how intic't and winded
With strange belief? how nimble, and how pro^^
To build on rottenness? Rely upon
Deluding Motives? making declination
From the firm Basis of true revelation.
^ge your opinions, you unbridled youths,
^ time, not Artists will declare our truths.
68. Knowledge.
THrough the Meander of invented art
^ I Have deeply waded, and unthaw'd the Ice
^ knotty contexts; as a ^teely Dart,
^ere's through mysteries, dark, obscure and nice:
^r Cypria's function was made known to me,
^e with her daughters been too well acquainted;
^e known Romes stages and her gallantry:
^ pastimes Paradise I have been planted.
(...) was my senses oiled with such content,
^t that displeasure also had its growth.
^now what 't was to laugh and to lament,
^pell'd the nature, and the use of both:
^pur'd my genius, on my Muse I put
^ to the Labyrinth of as deep conclusion
^ sense and reason knew. I hewed and cut
^e doors of darkness down, and made intrusion.
^ was acquainted with the starry realm
(...) others be, yet here my knowledge lack't,
^ knew not him that sits at the helm,
(...) whose discretion all the Planets act.
therefore thou root of nature, and of art,
^ Since void of knowing thee makes knowledge void,)
^fuse no other Science in my heart,
^hen of my self and thee, my glorious guide.
69. The Vineyard.
1.
ENter you that save with madness:
Enter you that sigh with sadness,
And receive the oil of gladness
In the Vine.
2.
Here Is the mystery of the Muses;
Here Is the Font Ma^^as uses;
Here wit gains what ere it loses.
Noble Wine.
3.
Here Is the Laurel, here is the Bays,
Here Is the sum of Poets praise,
Heare's the crea^ of Pa^s rays,
Samous liquor:
4.
Here Is the Arse^^ whence do spring
Presents worthy for a King.
Here my s^neies tender wing
Thriveth quicker.
70. The Quere.
SAy, shall I love, or shall I leave her?
Shall I leave or love for ever?
^ll I part with my profession,
^ proceed in my progression?
Ecc^o.
(...) back, suspend thy love for ever;
^l home thy heart again and leave her:
^o much of one sort breeds lothing,
^kes the object fit for nothing;
^yls the fancy, spoils the sense,

^cially in those that summon
^eir wits to attend a woman.

^en that face which once was fire
^calcine, shall now expire
^ Lamps of Zealots, and shall choke
^y own sense with thy own smoke:
^d you will feel (in such a case)
^ch disease, or much disgrace:
^ou go your credits lost,
^ou stay you will be crossed:
(...) how dismal is it, for he,
(...) whose love formalitie
^ps, or the affection, where
(...) wells not for love but fear!
^en return, return and leave her,
Lest thou art a fool for ever,
What avails thy wanton courting?
Kissing, clipping, hugging, sporting,
Smiling, beckning, musing, glancing,
Winding, tripping, footing, dancing,
Chopping, changing, mingling words,
All the joy that love affords:
What art thou for this the better?
Only thou art made a debtor
For It* Although thy Mistress swims
Over the glorious Cherubims
In thy fancy, she will not scorn
To salute thee with a horn
For thy requital: Such there be;
Then love not such vanity.
O return, return and leave her,
Else I Will say the art mad for ever.
He Is a fool that loves to be
Vassal'd, when he may be free.
71. The life and death of Sarah.
SArah lived and Sarah loved,
Sarah thrived and Sarah moved.
Sarah sat and Sarah slept,
Sarah wak't and Sarah wept,
Sarah sob'd and Sarah smiled,
Sarah was begot with child,
Sarah sigh't and Sarah song.
And Sarah could not hold her tongue.
Sarah pist and Sarah cried.
Sarah shit and so she di'd.
72. The Messenger.
LOve commands his servant out
To the woods, to range about
For a Mistress for his Master,
Cause he wanted such a plaster
As a Lady. Out he gots,
Through the woods, streams, verse and prose:
One he found, and then returned
(To the man that sight and burned.)
Expectation did advance,
And hope had the predominance:
Love replied to the Agent then,
Do thou gladly turn again?
Art thou fraited with my bl^ss?
Then he answers, Master yes.
But what have thou prepared for me?
Is she coy, or is she free?
Is she tall, or is she low?
Is she slender? lean or no?
Is she square, or is she round?
Is she sick, or is she sound?
Do the Gods confess their duty
Is to worship such a beauty?
Is but Venus scarce her type?
Is she green, or too too ripe?
Is she foul, or is she fair?
Is she not at others are?
Is she white, or is she black?
Or what is it that she does lack?
Answer.
I have prepared for thee enough.
She Is coy enough, add free enough,
She Is Low enough and tall enough,
She Is big enough and small enough,
She Is fat enough and lean enough,
She Is rich enough and mean enough,
She Is young enough and strong enough,
She Is short enough and long enough,
She Is sick enough and sound enough,
She Is square enough and round enough,
She Is black enough and white enough,
She Is foul enough and bright enough,
She Is thin enough and quick enough,
And she will soon be thick enough,
If you can give her P -- enough.

73. The lost Maidenhead.
1.
AS I went wandering over the grounds,
Where fruitful Ceres hand appeared,
Among the soul-enchanting sounds
Of feathered Choristers, I heard
Sla^inda making doleful moan,
because her Maidenhead was gone.
2.
Alas! (quoth she) the rose is fled,
That in my Azure veins did flow:
Ah pity me! my Maidenhead
^s loft, and now what shall I do?
Undone, undone, the woods proclaim;
My folly has betrayed my fame.
3.
The Gods (alas) will all combine
My sorrows to exasperate:
The blushing sun will cease to shine
On me. Oh cursed is my fate!
Undone, undone the mountains utter;
And angry heaven seems to mutter.
4.
If love forbear to break my heart
In pieces by his bolts of thunder,
Yet will the chaste Diana's dart
Dash and divide me all in sunder.
Undone, undone, unhappy girl;
I Have lost my Gem, my only Pearl.
5.
But while she warbled out her wrong
By the bright vapors of her passion,
And mournful Dirges sadly song,
Served up in cups of Execration:
An Echo then replied and said,
Lament not for thy Maidenhead.
6.
It Is like proud flesh that hurts the wound,
If it is not clip't away in time;
Or like the swarfie scum that is found
In boiling pots: excessive slime,
Which if not scum'd when it does rise,
Sinks in, and all within annoyes.
7.
Yet if thy graces can but brook
The loss, but still thou do implore it,
I Will give thee what another took;
If the art content I will restore it.
Content I am, she answered then,
Restore it me thou happy man.
And theu he gave it,
As she did crave.
8.
^he golden flower is now replanted
Within his native place again;
And fair Clarinda is not daunted,
Remembering no departed pain.
^ut since she found the loss so soft,
^ fear she will love to lose it often.
57. Good Fellowship.
1.
FIll, fill the glass to the brim,
It Is a health unto him
That refuses
To be curbed, or disturbed
At the power of the State,
Or the frowns of his fate;
Or that scorneth to bark or to bite at our Mases:
And that never will vary
From the juice of the Vine, and the cups of Canary.
2.
Drink to your friend, drink away,
For the showers to day
Will replenish
The sweet Vine with rich Wine,
Which the But and the Pipe
Shall receive when it is ripe.
Both the white and the red, both the green and, the Rhenish
For we never will vary, etc.
3.
Watch, watch his waters, and see
He drink fairly, as he
That begun it:
Fill his Cup, fill it up;
For why should we pinch
Him, or bate him an inch?
It Is his own every drop, and he ought not to shun ^^
There Is no man shall vary, etc.
4.
Mind, mind the work in your hand*
Let the rogues in the land
Not affright us:
Hang the sons and the guns
Of proud Mars, though we hear
His rebounds in our ear;
Yet he neither can hurt us, disturb us, or bite us,
Nor force us to vary, etc.
5.
Let them wrangle and jar,
They are Pillars of War
And contention;
But we will stay all the day
In the Tavern, and find
More delight in our Wine
Then the Chemist can draw from the rarest invention
And we never will vary
From the juice of the Vine, or the cups of Canary.
75. The Aspirer.
^Ull-fraighted with a strong desire, he seeks
(...) That fames loud Trumpeter might fill his checks,
(...) tell his glory to all humane ears,
and make it thunder in the Hemisphears:
^ought will suffice him but a large report
^f his magnificence about the Court;
^e would be Caesar feign: but hark my friend,
^ all essays premeditate thy end.
(...) that is exalted, quickly may be cast
(...) rapid storms, disturbed by every blast:
^he Cedars tremble, while the Bushes stand,
^ot moved nor frighted by the winds command.
and the bold Borean arm most strongly knocks
against the largest and the tallest rocks:
When fortune meets with her strongest foe*
^e takes advantage there to overthrow.
^estruction glories and delights to ride.
upon the shoulders of presuming pride.
^he longest freedom has the closest thrall:
^he highest rise begets the greatest fall.
^nce then such danger in the mountain lies,
^ond youth descend, descend if thou art wise.
(...) is a fate more happy to remain
^us beloved, then Croesus in disdain.
^esides, thy worth can challenge no such thought,
^s Princes Relics, they are dearly bought.
By birth and blood, blood spilt, and blood that is no^
Sad thoughts, high passions, and a world of tro^^
Now, if the are thine by birth and worthy deed,
Arm tho^ thy self with boldness, and proceed
Unto possession; but (alas) we know
No birth nor merit e're in thee did grow.
Then spell thy self, and ponder on thy merit,
For thou art too unworthy to inherit
Such Gems as these. Each vulgar must not pass
Within the bounds of the Corinthian Lass.
Will thou be Prince? review thy ^elf, and than
Thou may be happy if a Serving man.
Besides, were honor thine by Jove's decree,
Thou needst not seek for it, 't would follow thee.
75. Vice Courted.
ON melted Pitch can I my hand not lay,
But it must needs defile me?
Or court an unchaste Mistress for a day,
But needs she must beguile me?
It Is but a feeble Bulwark cannot bear
The brunt of one attempt:
There is no confidence in such a Sphere;
All virtue is exempt.
Go wet your hands in water, then you know
Pitch has no power to stain:
Go oil your heart with grace, and whores also
Will tempt you, but in vain.
^n lie a little in Radopha's arms;
Be confident and wary,
(...) let thy chastity oppose her charm^;
So may thy soul not vary,
(...) passively receive the sugered sin
That Is bounded by her waste;
(...) (like the Diers hand) declare wherein
Thou dipdst thy finger last.
^etimes it is good to search corrupted souls.
For hence we may discern and see
(...) sad it is where only vice controls,
And prize more noble honesty.
76. Semper Idem.
Who would not morgage faith and fame
Purchase so divine a soul as she,
That is for ever more the same,
^ring no more then Anaxarete?
As the first day I came to woo her,
^tedfastly she does continue still;
And so it is like she will endure:
(...) she never loved me yet, nor ever will.
Let greedy Rivals then adjorn
^ir forward suits and sue for her no more:
For I shall still enjoy her scorn
^pite of them; she has' for me in store*
77. Nobility.
TEll me no more, no more, thou young (...)
Of the renown due to thy predecessor*
Tell me no more, no more, thou tardy Stoic,
What man was famous, or what man Heroic,
Thou being idle: This will rather bring
Lead, then a feather to the failing wing
Of thy own fame. This is not thy defense,
The public eye looks on the present tense.
It looks not backward, then recite not thou
Thy fathers fame or merit: tell me now
Thy noble Acts, and so thou shall repair
His rusty glory, and thine own: forbear
Fond Thraso, else you know such brags will be
Disparagements unto they line and thee.
What if thy father had been born a fool,
Had thou but prosper'd in the heroic School
Of rare exploits, then thou, should have enjoy
Thy recompense (which none should have denied)
Abundantly, and in as ample measure.
As though all virtue were thy fathers treasure,
But if the art foolish, though thy father was
A Tully or a Hector; yet, alas
It Is no more beneficial unto* thee,
Then Alexanders glory is to me:
Only it adds more anguish to thy mind*
When thou remembrest how thou have declined*
^n^w then, Nobility, if rightly meant,
^ rather by self-action then descent.
78. The Extremes.
FAir one, those radiant lustres that arise
From (those bright Tapers) they Celestial e^
^ave fired me* I burn in every part,
^hey gnaw (like Vulters) my relenting heart.
And then the numness of you frozen zeal
^arves all my bliss, and makes my ^^ope conge
^o that my heart lies in a restless Urn;
With Cauoasus I freeze, with A^tna burn.
wherefore that sorrows may not me e^lipse,
chase frost and fire with thy love and lips.
79. The dying Lover.
YOu murdering eyes, you have disliv'd a man:
Nay, do not court me now, you never can
Repair the breach. Dull lamps they may be cherish
But there is no succor for a heart that is perished.
You may deplore my fall, but not recover
The blood you spilt; deaths fatal blow is over.
And now behold I die, my senses reel,
My humane powers dissolove, I gently feel
My soul departing to the sphere above,
The low Elysium of terrestrial love.
Bewail your self, not me, for I am ceast:
Yours is the crime, mine is eternal rest.
These words he spoke, then with a doleful gasp,
His soul and body death did soon unhasp.
80. Furioso.
MOnsieur Mundungo, in a three-sol'd hat,
Lined with Louse-^kins, and a suit of that,
One day came walking with a sword b' his side,
Along the medows, where the man espied
Two Rivals fighting for a Lass that stood
Bleeding in sorrow, to behold, their blood.
To these he marched, as though he would have devou^
Both Lords and Lady too: Lord how he lowr'd!
With ears like Midas, and a head as large.
As Lugnals Chimney, or a Gravesend Barge.
His neck like Atlas, and the fool expressed
Deformed Tytius in his ugly breast.
His gouty f^ogers were like Millers pegs:
And great Colossus furnished him with legs.
This mighty Monster armed (I Will assure ye)
With hobnail tushes, oiled wing hellish fury,
Accosts these Champions, vowing in a breath,
To send their bodies to eternal death.
But as he entered to oppose the play,
He drew his sword, and stoutly run away.
81. Loves frailty.
Love, thou are a false delight,
The art shouldered up with blisses,
^nded with golden kisses;
^y holiday is night.
^^e, thou art a wanton youth,
^^d guilty of high treason
against the Prince of reason:
^y target is untruth.
^^e, those leering looks of thine
^e gilt with feigned passion,
^^t with dissimulation:
^ttery's thy Brigandine.
^^ve, thou art a subtle thiese.
^^at do both rob and wound us,
^^d many times confound us,
^t giv'st us no relief.
^^en Love avoid, and court my thoughts no more,
^y birth if spurious, Venus is a whore.
^ink not to trap me with thy sugered wiles*
^are not for thy frowns, nor weigh thy smiles:
^he shall not please me, nor the other grieve me;
^^auty shall neither wound, nor Love relieve me.
82. The She Cockney.
MY City dame fell sick, she sighed she wept*
She went to bed, she slumber'd and she (...)
She rose again, she fed, she walked, yet still
Forsooth, my mistress was extremely ill.
It pleased her fleeting fancy then to steer
Her course into the fields, to see if there
Her qualm might cease, yet still (poor soul) (...)
Can meet with no cessation nor relief.
Her tender foot steps to the fragrant bowers,
She fed upon the fruits, she cropped the flowers,
She went, she wept, she smiled, she sighed, yet (...)
Forsooth, my Lady if extremely ill.
Well, she retired to repose again
Upon her downy bed, yet still the pain
Attended her: Her pulse did loudly pelt;
Whose verberation I am sure I felt,
Which hardly she did, neither could she say
What was ker pain, or in what part it lay:
But it is the mode, forsooth, and therefore still
Our City Mistress i^ extremely ill.
83. Weak Love.
1.
BAse love that cannot hold
A frown;
and baser heart that is controlled,
And thrown
^^to despair at one denial,
^^ou have betrayed thee in thy trial.
2.
^^or heart that cannot bear
Nor brook
^ne vice, where many virtues are:
Nor look
^hrough's fingers at a venial error;
He learned not this from C^pids mirror*
3.
^oor soul that cannot rest
A day
From her being absent, nor digest
Delay
Of promise, though he knows it be
Obstructed accidentally.
4
We know that girls will smile
And lowre*
Now the are as pert as Camomile,
Then sour:
Who robs a Hive (loud fame does sing)
Must with the honey taste the sting.
5.
They Will crip, and rise again,
And so
Experience cries the best of men
Will do:
And shall we therefore not descry
A fault and see it secretly?
6.
They Will promise much, it is true,
And yet
They are slack to pay: and will not you
Do it?
Come, come, revise your self, you will see
Her vice is your Epitomy.
84. Rosella Sleeping.
BLow not Zephyrus in the least* give over
Dexamine to dash against the shore.
Advance thy trident, and put down thy billows;
Oh Neptune buzze not in the muffled willows.
Peace Hornets, music, is of no effect,
Where dull eyed Morpheus holds the intellect.
Then cease Canary-birds, and let her rest
Breathing on me, while I breath on her breast;
Whose balmy breath (so fragrant) shall refresh
The mournful passion of my panting flesh;
While her sweet eyelids, on her eyes laid down,
Screen her poor lover from the torrid Zone.
^^h is our walking in a Summers day,
^^en cooler clouds mask Titans fiery ^ay.
^^en whistling Myrtles peace, refrain to shake,
^ke not Rosella till Rosella wake.
85. Minerva.
1.
AWay, away all you that be
Of Cupids gang; your sugered faces
Are no Magneticks unto me,
I can detest your soft embraces:
^eed not care to fly from you,
^ave the Graces and the Muses too:
2.
Go Vulcan, go and tell thy tale,
And show thy vices to another;
Thou never shall on me prevail,
I Have wit enough thy flames to smother.
(...) can take pleasure void of you,
^ave, etc.
3.
Go ruffling Courtiers, and salute
Such as you know will fall before ye;
No powdered hair nor Sunday suit
Shall bribe Minerva to adore ye.
I can take pleasure, etc.
4.
Go envi^s cursed whelps, and sit
Where snaky Strigies use to dally:
And you that spurn (like Zoilus) wit,
Go rest you in Charybdis valley.
I can rejoice in spite of you;
I have the Graces and the Muses too.
86. The Charm.
1.
COme my fairest, come my dearest,
Come my dearest, come my fairest,
Let Us enjoy
Cupids pleasure
In full measure,
Since here is none but thee and I.
2.
Give me kisses, give me blisses,
Give me blisses, give me kisses.
Do not arise,
Let us dally
In loves valley,
While Apollo shuts his eyed*
87. Rosella Maskt.
1.
^O have I seen cloud impair
The azure Heavens, and the fair
^^bition of the Prince of the air.
2.
and I have seen the Borean weather
^eep all the clouds away together,
and drive them to I know not whither.
3.
^ven so I Have seen a Mask obscure
^osella's cheek, and vail the pure
^^lustrious blood her veins immure.
4.
and I have seen the vail has gone
and disinvellop't that fair Sun,
^s soon as I have breathed thereon.
88. Tom Tell-troth.
1.
I Love not a cast in the eye,
Nor lead in the edges of Knive^:
I love not a man that will lie,
Unless 't be with other men's wives.
2.
I love not the ribs of a Lark,
I love not the brains of a Crow,
I love not a Dog that will bark,
Except he will bite also.
3.
I love not to sit on a bench
While you put my foot in the Stocks,
But I love a beautiful wench,
Provided she has not the Pox.
4.
I care not for hunting the Hare,
I care not for coursing the Coney.
I care not for selling my wave,
If I thought I should get no money.
5.
I care not for courting a Witch,
Nor drinking of Milk when it is hairy.
I care not for eating of Pitch;
But I love to be drinking Canary.
6.
I love merry lads in my heart,
That mirth with their honesty have:
^as for a fool I care not a fart,
and I cannot endure a knave.
89. The Dejection.
1.
^Hy art thou chained to the world? can not remove
A little higher to the orbs above?
(...) slenderly do thou thy stock improve?
2.
^y is thy heart contained in a snare?
^at secret thought dulls fancy? Oh what are
(...) thoughts invellop't with the clouds of care?
3.
(...) came thou thus, what Cell-created news
(...) down thy progress? what condition screws
(...) genius to the post, and dulls my Muse?
4.
^^d down this fog, and let the beams of light
(...) a light heart I mean) display their bright
^ntial glories to disband the night.
5.
not within thy self, what life is this?
(...) mirth is sadness, sorrow is thy bliss;
^u liv'st below a man, and think amiss.
90. O Yes!
O Yes! O yes! O yes! If any man
In City, Town, or Country can
Tell tidings of my Love, that is fled
Out of the warm and naked bed
Last night, while I lay slumbring by her;
Let him bring word unto the Crier,
And for his labor he shall have
As large requital as he will crave.
Her Characters be these; She Is dressed
With honesty, and that is the best
Attire (I think) that Ladies wear.
Prudence has pleated up her hair:
As for her face, where e're you spy
A girl whose beauty blinds your eye,
And wounds your heart, say that is she;
And then conduct her safe to me:
For till I find her I must trace
Through all the thickets and the groves
Where lovers use to look their loves.
With Heroules I Will search the fountains,
And make an Echo in the mountains,
For my fair one that is fled and hid;
As he for his dear Hylas did.
The torch of Cores I will borrow;
I Will search to day and seek to morrow;
Baulking no trouble, nor no pain.
Till I have found her out again.
(...) ^onder, yonder sure she stands
(...) heavens, wringing both her hands.
(...) that is not she too, it is a cloud
(...) which poor Ixion once was proud.
^m mistaken, I must leave,
^d travel on, lest I deceive
(...) hopes, and smother up my love,
(...) will my search immortal prove.
91. The Reply.
ANd is she gone? Ah pity then!
That she should ere return again
(...) you (dull Clown) whose slumbering eye
^^uld fall asleep when she lay by.
^e was a jewel, it is true;
^^d was esteemed so by you,
^hen you had lost her. Learn you then,
^^ver she return again,
(...) keep her as a Gem of cost,
and prize the Gem before it is lost.
^t all my fear is, that you had
Tytians face. This is no lad
^r fair Aurora; she will buss
^ther the young spark Caephalus.
and from her bed each morning fly
(...) wanton in the southern Sky.
^^ntent you then with crazy age;
and if the Nymphs of Cupids stage
Fly off from thence, this is the reason
They love not faces out of season:
Time-wasted flesh, and wrinkled brows
Are no fit objects for their bows.
Love's fresh and young, the like it loves,
But snorting age it never moves.
93. A Token.
HEre take my heart, my heart and body too,
Had I a greater gift I Would give it you.
The Exception.
COuld I but sink into your thoughts, and spy
Your roving fancy in your rolling eye;
I Would cast mine eyes upon it, and if I found
Your love was loyal, and your heart was sound,
I would accept them, but I dare not take
Veiled Gems at venture, nor presume to make
Such covered bargains. Leave your suit fond lover,
Unless the gift you give you can uncover.
Another Token.
THat our affection may increase and shine,
Let Us change, give me thy heart, and thou (...) mine
The Exception.
^Eep home your heart pray, and from me retire,
It Is more then my desert, or my desire.
(...) be no changling, 't would produce much dangers
(...) turn acquaintance out, and put in strangers.
(...) heart lives well, and does not care to move;
^^y be content, I thank you for your love.
94. The Station.
1.
COme fancy, and do not thou dabble
Thy wings, nor the wit of thy Muse,
among the sophisticate rabble
(...) Judas's, Doegs and Jews.
^y off from their modes, do not mingle
Nor mix
^y nature with theirs; tarry single,
And fly from their tricks.
2.
^un the fraud of the Court, if you ken it,
and from the loose Libertines fle^;
^et be not so strict as Saint Bennet:
^r that superstition would be.
(...) sure thy designs they be stable
And stout,
And let them be invariable,
Not like to the rout.
3.
Let Jesuits envy their Masses,
And Recabites fall to their Wine:
Let Puritans fly from their Lasses;
And Atheists all be divine.
Let Ranters lie down with the Sleepers;
And then
Let the zealous Pilgrims, and Weepers
Turn laughers again.
4.
Let um chop, let um change, let um alter,
Though one take the Crown for the Oar:
Though some the gold chain for the halter,
And some the Strapado for the Whore.
Though some 'stead of rags gather riches
And fame;
And some bewray their noble breaches:
Yet I Will be the same.
5.
It Is neither bad time, nor bad season
Shall cut off the cords of my mirth:
It Is neither bad rhyme nor bid reason
Shall spoil my design in the birth:
Let every one change as he pleases:
But yet
^^^ther solace or sorrow increases,
I Will not stir a bit.
6.
Science is clearly convicted
^t all their intentions are vain:
^refore I their folly relicted,
(...) never will mind them again.
^ow them, I felt them, I tried them
At best.
^e them not, but Semper Idem
For ever I Will rest.
95. Urbs infoelix.
1.
IF like a Mill my Harp did move,
I need not use my fingers,
Nor call for help from heaven above,
Nor seek for earthly fingers.
(...) streams of tears that from mine eyes gusht out,
^uld be enough to turn the wheel about.
2.
I Have searched each angle of thy soul,
I Have peep't through every cranny,
I find beyond compare the art foul,
Thy vices are too many
For tongue to tell to the intentive ears,
Flowing as proudly as my brack^sh tears.
3.
I from my window cast mine eye,
Where wanton girls were seen,
All clothed with immodesty,
And prides rich Magazine:
Whose proud array, and prouder looks did tell
Their journeys were in vain, their end was hell.
4.
Unhappy people, come refrain;
Renew your so lowing years:
Weep for your loss and for your gain,
Till sin is drowned with tears.
Your golden mines of Love and Peace are dumb,
While leaden strife and envy take their room.
96. The Iron Age.
1.
When Saturn dwelt in Italy,
The Golden Age begun:
But (Ah!) ere my nativity,
The Golden Age was done.
2.
I Have read how he sometimes would go
And drink a pint of Wine
^ith old Japetus, where they two
Would tell a tale divine.
3.
They had their feasts of Love and Peace,
Knitting their hearts in Vno:
But now in stead of these, we be
Like Heroules and Juno.
4.
T was after that Jove had bereaven
His Father of his Crown,
And had assumed the power of Heaven
To be his only own.
5.
This revolution did produce
An happy Scene of powers;
And pleasure then was grown profuse:
I wish the case were ours.
6.
But look where Pride does sway the Stage.
And Folly rules the Pagin,
The event will be the Iron Age,
As well you may imagine.
97. The Bride Weeping.
1.
FLee blushing Sol, thy motion is too slow;
And V^sper thou delai'st.
Has night forgotten what she has to do,
Or turned Loves bitter foe,
And so will not make haste?
Pity remorseless Gods, and see
How the sweet girl has wept for ye.
2.
Lash on thy Nag dull Phoebus, and renew
Vesper thy tardy pace;
And lazy night lend your assistance too.
We only wait your race,
We only wait for you.
See how she pants for the sport,
Her heart even breaks in longing for it.
3.
Peace wrong d girl, and rest a while content,
Relief begins to spring:
Darkness does vail the brighter element.
Bubo extends her wing,
While day^ birds cease to sing.
Then peace my dear, and cease to cry,
Thou shall be eased by and by.
98. The Passion.
AH, woe is me! she turns aside,
And still refuses:
When I would kiss, I am denied
With cold excuses.
Ah me! I can receive no rest,
But I must perish,
Until her lips and mine con^est,
My soul to cherish,
But that I know she will never do;
She holds it evil.
Then fare her well, and let her go
Unto the Devil.
She that refuses my good will,
And scorns my favor,
I Will also scorn to woo her still,
But let the Devil have her.
99. To Fate.
1.
TRead under Fate, be not destroyed,
Rouse up again and live;
Take courage and revive:
Take reason for thy guide:
Love's blind, and so is fortune, let them be
Captains-Conducters to themselves, not me.
2.
Sigh not sor sorrows past, refrain
To let base fear control
The sallies of thy soul:
What privilege we gain
By giving vantage unto sorrow, shall,
If put into our eyes, not hurt at all.
3.
Adversity's of no effect
To smother, or to bind
A well disposed mind.
Fleet Souls low Spheres neglect;
And soaring to another Zone, they claim
Fates upper hand, and wear the Crown of Fame.
4.
Come then my soul, and see thou go
Into thy self, and there
Survey what things you wear,
Then get what you have lost.
And armed with courage, to the world relate
Thy self triumphant over the Tower of Fate.
100. Confidence.
1.
COuld I imagine how I might
Destroy my foes in thinking,
Or draw their bloods by drinking,
I Would stay at home, and in an Angle fight.
2.
Yet may I triumph over the times
With my laborious Quill
(While I my self sit still)
With measured Rhetoric, and melodious rhimes.
3.
Then arm thy self Urania,
And flee to every Zone
That Mortals trend upon.
Surround the Globe, and in their fancies play.
4.
Sprout forth young sprig of tender Wit,
Well fledged with Dorick strains,
Flee swiftly from my brains,
And let the world see I Am not ^^rb'd by it.
5.
Grow Darts on thy ignoble Stem,
That wisely may resist
Each proud Antagonist;
And tell thy foes thou w^lt not stoop to the^^
101. The Check.
1.
BUt stay, lie down my soul,
Lie down, (dear soul) and leave
The world, corrupt and foul
With vanity, and cleave
Unto thy self, and like a Hermit, spend
Thy days in silence, till thy days shall end.
2.
He sleeps in silver peace
That in a Cell remains,
Where altercations cease
Both from his breast and brains.
No revolution of the reeling State
Can mend or mischief his monastic fate.
3.
No blustering blast that blows
From rigid mouths of Kings;
No poisoned surge that flows
From worth-consuming springs
Can drown his fortunes by their furious flashes,
Or beat his walls down by their dismal dashes.
The Counter Check.
BUt stay (my soul) the art born
A burning Taper bright,
Whose luster should adorn
Thy neighbor and the night.
Then spread thy beams, and he that shall despise
TO embrace thy light, may it burn out his eyes.
102. Sack-Drawers.
1.
YOu Swains of the Deity ruling the Vines,
Why hang ye your heads and decline in your spirits?
What! can ye not meet in the strength of the wines,
The high supposition that Bacchus inherits?
The Calling you follow
Is allowed by Apollo,
Where he and his Muses do feed:
And ye are all Gentlemen Drawers indeed.
Ye are all better then Princes, all heavenly heirs,
The honey-lip^ Bacchus (a God) is your father;
But some have the Devil, the Devil for theirs.
Then are ye not worthy and reverend rather?
Your Function's a treasure of solace and pleasure,
As it by the Gods was decreed.
And ye are all. etc.
3.
Each day is a Holiday full of delight;
No Antidote like unto Wine against sorrow,
We sing and we play and are wanton to night,
Which mirth does increase and is doubled to morrow
With singing and laughing,
With drinking and quaffing,
Our fancies we fleece and we feed,
For we are all, etc.
4.
And are we not company fit for the best
Of Nobles and Gallants that tread on the Center?
With them we confer, we comply and contest,
Which does to our profit arise peradventure.
Our ways do present us
All things that content us;
There Is nothing at all that we need.
And we are all, etc,
5.
We eat of the best, and we drink of as good,
A dish of Ambrosia each day is prepared;
And also to nourish our hearts and our blood,
Nepenthe and Nectar is liberally shared.
Our Tenches and Sammons.
Our Wenches and Gammons,
Canary our Cod-pieces bleed.
Then are we all Gentlemen Drawers indeed.
6.
Our Rent is prepared, our Taxes are paid,
No secular action does cause us to alter,
And he that is bent to repine at our Trade,
As well when he is hanged may rail at his halter.
Let no man upbraid us,
Since heaven bath made us
Mechanic to rule and exceed.
For we are all, etc.
7.
Then let the dumb Stoic do all that he can,
We live by our Melody, he by his mettle.
A fig for the Rechabite, and Puritan,
Whose head is as round and as dull as a Beetle:
I ever will follow
The drink of Apollo,
Ejecting the juice of the weed.
And we are all Gentlemen Drawers indeed.
103. Her Endowments.
MY Mistress must be spic'd with pride,
And not corrupt with silthy scorn;
She must be wanton too beside,
Yet not too much for fear of the horn.
She must not be as others are,
Either too foolish or too wise:
She must be near, but not too fair,
Left her bright luster blind my eyes.
I care not for rich clothes or coin:
It Is feigned love that sues for stock.
But where I fix this love of mine,
I Will love my Mistress in her smock.
104. Grief.
1.
AWay (thou gnawing worm) fond grief.
Away from me, away.
Thy absence is my sweet relief,
Then flee without delay;
He that gives way to woe and sorrow,
May grieve to day, and mourn to morrow.
2.
Go now into another Zone,
Where mortal brains are light,
And press them down; I Have need of none
Since I have felt thy weight.
He that shall change his frown for laughter,
May laugh to day, and sing hereafter.
3.
^rid you both, and know you well;
But do not like you so;
A light heart has no parallel,
But oh the pangs of woe!
Yet Woe, the heart can never shoot,
If Thought be not the Porter to it.
4.
Then get the touchstone which may turn
All dross and dregs to gold.
When grief begins in you to burn.
Let fancy make it cold:
Know either peace, or blustering passion.
Arises from the imagination.
5.
Suppose you then that all is good,
And in that thought r^pose:
This will alay that fiery blood
Which in thy body flows.
And mark me now (for this is chief)
Nothing on earth requires grief.
6.
If accident should chance to fall,
It falls from heaven above.
Then let no poverty or thrall,
Your soaring spirits move.
Nothing but sin can grief require,
Then grieve for sin, else grief expire.
55. A Quiet Mind.
1.
IN midst of plenty only to embrace
Calm patience, is not worthy of your praise;
But he that can look sorrow in the face
And not he daunted, he des^rves the Bays.
This is prosperity, when ere we find
A heavenly solace in an earthly mind.
2.
Let Croesus then with drossie coin depress
His heavy heart, while mine to heaven flies;
He lies tormented in a deep distress,
Whiles I am regent in the throne of joys.
Oh here is happiness, when men can find
An empty pocket, and a thankful mind.
3.
Estates are fetters, if they are not blended
With charity, and not too much of care:
Hence is the soul not bettered but offended;
Riches with reason is a jewel rare.
Yet poor or rich be quiet, and you will find
No blessing level to a quiet mind.
106. Love stealing his Mistress.
1.
HAnd in hand, and heart in heart,
We will secretly depart,
(While the Dogs and Cocks and Crows
Nature calls to repose.)
To the valley,
Where Venus use to dally.
Come away,
Leave relations all at home,
Make conceit oblivions pray.
Its no thest to steal loves pleasure,
Or to rob its golden treasure,
Then prepare thy self, and come
To Cupids dark Elysium,
Where we will take a thousand kisses,
Searching out more secret blisses.
2.
Let invention frame excuses,
Love and Ladies have their Muses.
Wanton Cupid though he is blind,
Can a thousand crotchets find
To excuse thee,
While I gently use thee.
Let us fly
(Silent as the subtle Crane^
Over Taurus) through the sky,
To the Park of Venus, where
I will soon hunt down my Dear,
Tracing thy Meandring veins,
To take pleasure for my pains.
There I Will hunt thee down with laughter,
Shooting not before, but after.
107. A Health.
Here Is a health to her, whose Power
Surmounteth all the rest,
To her that only I adore,
To her I fancy best,
To her that can with subjects fill
My nimble Brains, or empty Quill,
And furnish me with sense divine;
It is this noble glass of Wine.
Let others fancy whom they please,
Their poor and feeble Mistresses;
Yet I will still embrace the Cup
Brim full of Sack, and hug it up.
108. The Exaltation.
1.
A Rout, a rout my fancy cries,
If reason shall give way to it,
I know not what to say to it.
Then wake sublimer thoughts, and rise,
Help me quickly,
I am sickly,
Despair is come, and pleasure dies,
2.
But yet me thinks it should not do it,
Have thou no more discretion?
Then hark to my expression,
And it will be a fair recruit.
Disinherit
Thy dull spirit
Of such thoughts as make it mute.
3.
Rear up the down-falls of thy heart.
Remit both care and sorrow
To day before to morrow.
This is a melancholy smart,
From which College
All the knowledge
We derive's not worth a fart.
4.
Sweep down the Cobwebs of despair,
Shake hands with inbred pleasure,
Dive in light fancies treasure;
And bid your heaviness forbear.
Be oblivious
(Not sascivious)
Of your folly, not your prayer.
5.
Drink down disasters, wash away
The filth of all misfortune,
And to the Gods importune,
That Bacchus power may not decay.
It Is Sack and Claret
That will carry't
When the world shall say you nay.
6.
Reject times errors, such as steer
The conscience to perdition:
As envy and ambition.
Shun Lady-lust, if she appear,
And do not dally
In her valley,
Neither seek for Venus there.
7.
Your cordial help and your redress,
Your strength and sure assistance,
Which is not at a distance)
^rink that from the Grape we press.
Then do not vary
From Canary;
It Is your help and happiness.
109. Reality.
CAst off conceit a while, lay fancy by.
And clear thy pockets of Hyperbolic.
This done (my Genius) court me, and declare
What worthy creatures all your Women are.
Women are sugered Pills, the baits of Gins,
^^xt with corruption, and a world of sins.
Man wins the day, but Woman bears the same:
The are Maps of Modesty but (...) the same.
Deluding Devils in the garb of Saints;
Built of corruption, beautisi'd with paints,
Whom nature sent (though art did them attire)
Like Sampsons Foxes, to set all on fire.
110. The Ultimum vale.
I Shall not beg your praise, nor spend my breath
In expectation of a Laurel VVreath.
Read and give judgment, be it good or ill,
All Is one to me, I Will not confine my Quill
Unto such servile labor, as to measure
Out this Lords humor, or that Ladies pleasure,
I write my downright fancy, and I bend
Not for the fear of Foe, or love of Friend.
FINIS.
