A Song in the Comedy called Sr. Fopling Flutter Set by Mr John Eccles Sung by
Mrs Hudson and exactly engraved by Tho: Cross.
^ Caelia with mournful pleasure hears my soft, my soft com-^ ^-plaints of
Love; mingles her wishes Sigh's and tear's and vow's -- her ^ ^heart I move.
But when to the blessed, the blessed hour I press the willing, ^ ^ ^willing Maid
denies; and tho a passion she confess, yet her loved, yether ^ ^lov'd Martyr
dye's.^

Duty forbids my tender suit,
When ere she bids me love;
That guardian flame defends the fruit,
The nodding bow would give.
Ah! might I with an amorous Prayer
Atone her Fate and mine
We'd both enjoy, but to my share
Fall all the load of Sin.
