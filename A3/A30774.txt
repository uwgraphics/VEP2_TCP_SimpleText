A LETTER FROM MERCVRIVS CIVICVS TO MERCURIUS RUSTICUS: OR, LONDONS CONFESSION
but not Repentance.

SHOWING, That the beginning and the obstinate pursuance of this accursed
horrid Rebellion is principally to be ascribed to that Rebellious City.

A LETTER FROM MERCVRIVS CIVICVS TO MERCURIUS RUSTICUS.
Good Brother RUSTICUS,
THough there have been some unkind jars between my brother Aulicus and me,
yet my earnest desire is to keep a good understanding between your self and me:
I cannot but congratulate your happiness that breathe in so free an air,
wherein it is lawful to hear and speak truth: O Truth, sacred Truth, whither
art thou fled? if you at Oxford did not give her entertainment, I know not
where she would find a place of abode, for here at London we fortify against
her to keep her out: Nay with us in the City it is come to that pass, that it
is almost as dangerous to speak truth as Love the King: you know how famous we
have been here for publishing and printing Lies, he that will not lie to
advantage the great Cause in hand, is not amongst us thought fit to have
access either to the Pulpit or the Press. And therefore when I was first set
on work to communicate Intelligence to the Kingdom to indear my self to them
that employed me, I played my part reasonable well, I Lied my share; but at
last admonished by our brother Aulicus, and to confess to you, touched a
little in conscience, I began by degrees to take off my self from that
unwarrantable course, and did here and there sprinkle a little truth, yet very
sparingly lest I should be thought to be turned Malignant or Cavaleer: but as
little as it was, it was distasteful: for hereupon Mr Pim and the Remainder of
the five Members, assisted by Mr Martyn, illiterate Sergeant Wild, Peard (that
has less Law if it be possible then the Serjant) and some others that have
sworn never to endure truth again, since they have thriven so well by Lies,
moved at the Close Committee to have me silenced: yet to blind the world, as if
their aim were not at me alone, they involve others in the same doom, and for
Intelligencers, by an Order they bung up all our mouths at once: yet knowing
how much it co^cerned them that the old trade went on, though since they have
permitted another to make use of my name, yet at first they gave authority to
one man only to lie for all the rest: him they call the Parliament Scout, not
Bulmore the Scout that was slain at Whetley bridge near you at Oxford, I mean
not him, yet if you look into his weekly Pamphlets, you would swear that he
had no more brains in his head, then Bulmore had when they were shot out.

This man indeed tells you some truths, but such antiquated ones that they were
stale news above a Thousand years since, as that on the borders of Scotland,
there dwelt a People whom they called Picts, that there was a Wall built
between England and Scotland, and the like: while he keeps at this distance and
comes no nearer, he never needs fear that the heels of the times may chance
dash out his teeth: he may write on! but if once he come to publish any Modern
truths, as that his Excellency durst come no nearer Oxford then Them, that
Fairfax is beaten in the North, and Waller and Warwick in the West, or the
like, he were best look to himself, he may read his fate in us: These new
Reformers will never Brook it.

Since therefore we are here inslaved either to Lies or Silence, that the world
may not for ever be kept hoodwinkt, go on (I pray) as you have begun to let
her see the Miseries under which she daily suffers. But me thinks it would be a
work well worthy your endeavor, to let the Country see not only their
miseries, but to point them out the fountain and source from whence they flow:
This discovery has been within me as wine that has no vent, ready to burst
like new bottles, yet as full as I am, I dare not vent my thoughts concerning
this here, but have chose rather to whisper them to you: for it is in vain to
dissemble it, your sad stories of the Ruin and devastation of the Country are
ecchoed in our Streets, and though we bear it out in a Vaunting way, as if
these things concerned not us, yet I assure you there are many souls that
mourn in private, (for in public we must be as mad as the rest, or else we
suffer as Malignants) as knowing how justly we stand charged with all those
Calamities, which the sword of Rebellion has brought upon you: I never hear
that of the Prophet read, Woe to the bloody City, it is full of Lies and
Robbery, but I cannot choose but think of London.

It is too too manifest, nor can it be denied, but that all your Sufferings
have been derived from us: when Common Prayer was in use amongst us, I remember
such a Query in one of the Prophets, Is there any evil in the City and the
Lord has not done it? But you may ask, Is there any evil in the Country,
and the City has not done it? You have made us Rich and Populous, and we in
foul Ingratitude have prodigally powerd out both our Wealth and Strength to
make you and our selves miserable.

Well might the Incendiaries of this present Rebellion (so I dare call it to
you, though I dare not speak so plain here) bring violent affections, eager
endeavors to set this flourishing Church, and Kingdom in Combustion, but alas!
all this had signified little or nothing, had they not gained our consent, and
we resigned up our persons and estates to their disposal to be made the base
instruments to compass their most Traiterous designs: Could Say or Pim, and
their beggarly Confederates have found money to Levy an Army against their
Liege Lord, that had not money to pay their own Debts, had not we furnished
them? If we shall without partiality consider the several helps which this
City has Contributed to this Rebellion, we must confess that both the
beginning and continuance of this unnatural War may be ascribed to us: So
that in all England there is but one Rebel, and that is London. To reflect a
little and look back on those times when this Rebellion was but am Embrio, or
else did begin to creep into the world, (for we may not think that this
Monster was a Brat of a sudden birth) though it were conceived (some Say)
ne^re Banbury, and shaped in Grays-Inne-Lane, where the undertakers for the
Isle of Providence did meet and plot it, yet you know it was put out to Nurse
to London.

For first you may well remember when the Puritans here did as much abominate
the Military-yard or Artillery-Garden, as Paris-Garden it self: they would not
mingle with the Profane: but at last when it was instilled into them, that the
blessed Reformation intended could not be effected but by the sword, these
places were instantly filled with few or none but men of that Faction: We were
wont you know to make very merry at their Training, some of them in two years
practice could not be brought to discharge a Musket without winking; We did
little imagine then, that they were ever likely to grow formidable to the
State, or advance to that strength, as to be able to give the King Battle, but
after a while they began to affect, yea and Compass the chief Offices of
command, so that when any prime Commanders dyed, new men were elected, wholly
devoted to that Faction; and it became a General Emulation amongst them who
should buy the most, and the best Arms.

Secondly, that they might fill all places of authority with such as should
advance the design, all care is taken to fill the Bench of Aldermen, and the
Common Counsel, with men disaffected to the Government, both Ecclesiastical,
and Civil. To this purpose if London did not afford men bad enough, they would
call them from other Corporations, as Alderman Atkins from Norwich and the
like: but if he had been Amsterdam or had been an Adventurer to New England, or
been the host of the silenced Ministers, he was a jewel: Nay some will tell
you, and I am much of their opinion, that the Faction have had so great a Care
of this, that they have chosen some men to places of the best esteem in the
City, whose estates were not able to defray the Charges, but have been
supported by a Common Purse, and if you have not forgotten it, there was a
Motion you know made, That Honest men, so they call th^eselves, might bear the
Magistracy, and the City bear the Expense: some men thought that this
proposal had especial Relation to those two beggarly Captains, Ven and
Manuring, who having nothing either within or without them to render them fit
for government, yet in this Rebellious City, were thought most fit, because
most averse from what was by Law established.

Thirdly, because all this could not compass the end they aimed at, unless
the Clergy did conspire with them and contribute their help, and because they
found very few of the Settled Clergy here in the City, (except Dr. Gough, M.
lackeson, Votier, Simons, Walker, and a very few more) Compliant with their
endeavors, they labored by all means possible, to introduce that Gibbus or
excrescency, of the Clergy called Lecturers over their Parochial Ministers
heads, whose maintenance being dependent (yet a portion by double Leases and
other Sacralegious devices stolen from their own Parsons, so that the barren
Mountains of Wales afford not so many poor, and as Sir Benjamin Rudyer was
wont to call them, scandalous Livings together, as are to be found within the
walls of London) must preach such Doctrine as may foment disloyalty, and
instill such Principles into their Auditors as may first dispose them to, and
after engage them in Rebellion, when things were ripe, or else they shall want
bread to put into their heads: The Truth is, Brother Rusticus, these Military
preparations had effected Little, had not the fire been given from the Pulpit.

And because they saw how Successful this Course was, and what strange
effects it wrought in our City, a Fourth design was, to place some of their
Emissaries in all Corporations (those Nu^c^ries of Schism and Rebellion) and
in the most eminent parts of the Kingdom; for this purpose a most specious and
pious pretense is held out to the world, the buying in of Impropriations:
Feoffces are appointed, men of public Callings, as Clergymen, Lawyers, and
Citizens, whose employments must needs render them known to many, and men of
noted Zeal in the Opinion of the Wo^ld; (such as it was) thereby to gain the
reputation of Religion to the undertaking: the Lectures (and others too)
deceived by the outside of this Project, stir up the Rich and well affected
to Contribute Liberally to this so religious an Act, of rede^ming the Lords
portion out of Lay-hands, and amongst the last Counsels given to the dying
(and then commonly they make deepest impression) This was never forgotten: by
this means great Sums were advanced, and the World stood at gaze to see the
great return which would be made to the Church of that which Sacraledge had
made a Lay-Fee: after any were redeemed how long the revenues were held in the
Feoff^es hands, what pittances were allowed to the Incumbents, how they robbed
Peter to pay Paul, and established a Lecture perhaps in Cornwall, with the Tith
of a Parsonage in Yorkshire, or the like, appertains not to my present purpose.

The thing that I shall observe unto you is, the great care and art used in
fitting men for their service, and then disposing and securing them in their
Employment, from any Molestation of Ecclesiastical Censures. To this end,
First, they account it necessary to plant two Seminaries, the first an Initiary
Seminary, to this purpose they project the buying of a Headship in one of the
Universities for some eminent man of their own party, under whose Influence
their Novices might be trained up in their Mysteries: though some houses in
both Universities were notorious enough in this kind before, and might have
saved them this Labor, as Magdaline Hall and New-Inne in Oxford, and Emanuel
College and Katherine Hall in Cambridge.

The second was a Practique Seminary, and that was at St. Antholines here in
London, and did in Spiritualibus answer to the Artilery Garden, being a place
to train up their young Emissaries, where they might take an Essay of their
affections and abilities, and by the bewitchments of gain and popular applause
deeply engage them in their Faction: and from this Seminary were most of their
new bought Impropriations filled. And as they had their Salary from, so they
were subordinate to a Classis or Cler^-laicall Consistory, who had power to
transplant their most hopeful Imps either into their purchased Impropriations,
or else into a Lecture in some of the most populous places of the Kingdom,
maintained by a borrowed portion from an Impropriation elsewhere: yet this
Consistory, did not in their choice, strictly tie themselves to the plants of
their own Nurceries, but if any man had been a Pseudomartyr for their cause, or
had been sentenced by the high Commission for Nonconformity, or by some
Notorious undertaking had evidenced and declared himself, and irrevocably
without apparent note of Infamy and Levity (if he retracted) engaged himself
to their party: or had Letters Testimonial from Patriarch White of Dorchester,
Mr. Cotton of Boston, or the like, (for Calamy and Marshall were not, as it is
said of Dathan and Abiram, as yet famous in the Congregation.) This man was a
choice plant and fit for their Soil.

Secondly, being planted abroad, their second care was, that whatsoever they
Preached, though never so derogatory to the Government either Ecclesiastical
or Civil, yet they might be free from molestation, and Preach on, without
danger of loosing their maintenance by Ecclesiastical censure. To this purpose
they attempt the buying a Commis^aries place there, where they intended to make
any special plantation: who being after their own hearts, might wink at their
irregularities, and though the Churchwardens should by chance be so honest to
regard their oaths, and present them, yet by the purchased or bribed
Commissary they may secure them from the danger of the Court.

Lastly, for fear least any of their Creatures should fall from them, and
desert the Cause as some had done, when they had got what they looked for;
wisely they provide, that their maintenance shall be dependent, on the pleasure
of their good Masters the Feoffees, alterable by addition, or substraction,
according to their merits, or demerits, and their persons subject to be
Casheered if they Preach not to the advancement of their holy cause, and
according to the directions sent unto them from the Conclave of their Elders at
London: That so as much as humane Policy could invent, they might (to use Mr
Foxlies own words speaking in this argument) Establish the Gospel by a
perpetual decree.

When all things were now ready, their Emissaries having prepared the hearts of
the people to Rebellion, first alienating them, by frequent slandering the
footsteps of Gods anointed, decrying the Government both of Church and State,
fomenting the causeless discontents, and aggravating the necessities of State,
with the odious names of Tyranny, Arbitrary power, Violation of the Subjects
Liberty, and Property, and likewise possessed the credulous multitude, that the
conformeable Clergy had made a Revolt from the Protestant Religion, and had an
earnest intention to introduce Popery: at last was fulfilled that Prophecy of
Judicious M. Hooker, toward the end of the Preface to that incomparable work of
Ecclesiastical Policy, that after the Puritans have first resolved that
attempts for Discipline are lawful, it will follow in the next place to be
disputed, what may be attempted against Superiors who will not have the Scepter
of that discipline to rule over them? Which Prophecy we see exactly fulfilled
in our days, for the Puritans having first rebelled by a Proxey, they then
thought it seasonable to take an essay what an entertainment the doctrine for
taking up Arms against the King would find amongst their Disciples.

To this purpose Doctor Downing, a man fitted for any base employment, and one
that (what ever he counterfeited) ever looked awry on the Church, in which
(being settled and in peace) he could never hope to advance farther then Vicar
of Hack^ney, was to feel the Pulse of the City: while therefore discontents
run high in the North, the Scots having in a hostile manner entered the
Kingdom, the People every where, especially in London, stirred up by some
agents to Petition the King for this Parliament, D. Downing Preaching to the
Brotherhood of the Artilery Garden positively affirmed, that for defense of
Religion and Reformation of the Church, it was lawful to take up arms against
the King.

He having thus Kindled the fire in the City, for fear of being questioned
(for as yet it was not lawful to Preach Treason) retired privately to the
Earl of Warwicks house in Essex, the common Randevouz of all Schysmaticall
Preachers, this Sermon in every place administering matter of discourse, People
censured it, as they stood affected, which gave occasion to the Ringleaders of
this faction to enter upon a serious examination, and study of this case of
Conscience: and it seems, consulting the Jesuits on the one side, and the
Rigid Puritans on the other, or indeed, because without admitting this
doctrine, all their former endeavors would vanish into smoke, they stood
doubtful no longer, but closed with these two contrary Factions, yet shaking
hands in this point of Rebellion, and subscribed to D. Downings doctrine, as an
Evangelicall truth.

And* that in this I may not be thought to speak as if I were a Parliament
intelligencer still, for the truth of this, I appeal to M. Stephen Marshall
himself, who being pressed by M. Simons, that her^of^re he was of another
opinion, ingenuously confessed it, but withal affirmed, that on D. Downings
Sermon, having a hint given them, the Brethren did enter upon an examination of
the Doctrine, and upon examination found it tru^: T^ough the truth is, they
whispered this doctrine long before in their Conventicles, but never durst
proclaim it in their Pulpits, before they saw an army in the bowels of the
Kingdom to make it good by the sword, and a Faction in a Parliament comeing on,
that would Authorize Rebellion under this pretense, by their Votes and
Ordinances.

After it was once owned as a Truth, and a Truth, first scanned, and then
avowed by Marshall, Calamy, Downing, and Colonel Cornelius Burges, and the
rest of their Elders, That for the cause of Religion it was lawful for the
Subject to take up Arms against his Lawful Sovereign, good God! how
violently did the People of London rush into Rebellion? how pliable did the
Faction in Parliament find them, to raise Tumults? make outcries for justice?
call for innocent blood? subscribe and prefer Petitions against the holy
Lyturgy? and the Hierarchy, Root and branch, if Doctor Burges did but hold up
his finger to his Mermidons? or Captain Ven send his summons by his Wife, to
assemble the Zelots of the City?

But because all other attempts had been to little purpose, while the power of
the sword remained in His hands, into which God had put it, the Heads of this
Rebellion consider, that it was more seazable by secret practices, to render
the King unable to withstand them, then for them openly to oppose the King;
therefore their main endeavor is to wrest the power of the Militia out of the
Kings hands by degrees, and to put it there, where they might place the
greatest confidence.

But this was a work not easily effected, great Changes could not be ushered in
but by great preparations to make it way for them; hereupon the Faction in
Parliament make it their first work to make this City wholly theirs, that one
soul as it were might animate both representive bodies, That of the Kingdom,
and this of the City: knowing that it was in vain for the Faction in
Parliament to contrive unless the Faction in the Common-Councellin London
would execute: for though there were some flourishes made from Buckingham-shire
in the behalf of M. Hampden, and from Leichestershire in the behalf of Sir
Arther Hasterigge; and the like, yet the standing Guard, and power of the
Faction in Parliament, on which they relied, to affront the King; and save
themselves from the justice of the Laws, was that fixed here in London.

And because where fear does possess the multitude, it makes them work not
like agents, but like instruments, and moulds them to a Temper, fit to receive
impressions, from those, in whose wisdoms or Loves they repose themselves,
making them plia^le to all directions and Counsels, which shall be given by
them, whom they esteem Patriots of the Commonwealth, and Assertors of the
Liberties, and safety of the People, all possible art was used to possess the
Kingdom, but especially the City with strange ^ealousies and Fears, and
therefore besides the often inculcating the fained intention of introducing
Popery, great preparations in France, and Denmark to invade the Kingdom, to
enable the King to govern Arbitrarily, to the subversion of the fundamental
Laws of the Kingdom, together with the Liberty and Property of the Subject:
(Theames that did continually possess both the Pulpit and the Press, which
how tru^, though most impudently affirmed, the World now sees:) each day did
produce a discovery of some new Treason, and to ind^^^e the City the more it
must be so contrived, That in these monstrous fictions you shall continually
find the Parliament and City fained to be involved in the same danger.

To possess the Kingdom how mortally the Parliament and City (the two vital
parts of the Kingdom as Pym calls them) were threatened; in the time of the
Recesse they take opportunity of the Petition delivered by the Troop^rs from
the North, and by an order from the Committee, they appoint strong watches to
be kept in all highways, Villages, and Towns within twenty miles of London,
that Travelers into all parts of the Kingdom, passing through these Guards,
might report when they came home, in how much danger the Parliament and City
were for their sakes.

And that the Credulous People might not think but that this was done on good
grounds, a Letter is written from the Parliament Commissioners in Scotland, M.
Hampden, M. Fiennes and the rest to M. Pym and the close Committee here, to
inform them of a strange conspiracy discovered in Edinburgh, to seize on the
persons of the Marquess Hamilton, and the Earls of Argile, and Lan^ricke: the
Committee wisely considering that it was no st^ange thing for Treason to make a
step out of Scotland into England, instantly provided against it, (at least so
they would be thought) by publishing an Order commanding the Justices of Peace
of Middlesex, Surrey, and Southwarke, to secure the City and the places
adjoining from all danger by strong guards, well armed, and give this reason
for their Order, Because the Mischievous designs and conspiracies lately
discovered in Scotland against some Principal and Great men there, by some of
the Popish Faction, gives just occasion to suspect, that they may maintain
correspondency here and practice the like mischief.

Presently upon the neck of this M. Pim's life (to the great detriment of the
Kingdom and Nation) is endangered by a contagious plaster of Plague sore,
wrapped up in a letter and directed to him: but God be thanked, the infection did
not take, though throwing away the plaster only, he put the letter in his
Pocket: he being reserved for another manner of death (we hope) then to dye
privately in his bed, with a few spectators to bear witness of his end.

Then comes a Tailor out of a ditch in Finsbury fields, having miraculously
escaped, being run nine times besides the body, (for like a wise Tailor,
wheres^ever he made ilotholes, he would be sure to make none in his own skin,
though to gain credit to the relation:) and he tells a strange discovery of a
Treason, which he overheard two men talking of, a Conspiracy against the life
of the Lord Say, and some of the chief Members of both Houses: A thing so
improbable, indeed so Ridiculous, that had they not thought that the world
stood prepared to receive any thing for truth which came from them, 'twas a
wonder how they durst own it. And now I have named a Tailor it puts me in mind
of Per^ins my Lord Says Tailor, who at a Common Council produced a copy of a
Letter from an I know not what Irish Lord in Paris, to such an other Irish Lord
in London, intimating some strange design against the City, which took as
passionately with the People, as if it had been certified from M. Strickeland
his worship himself* Ambassador for the two Houses unto the States-Generall of
the united Provinces. But the most monstrous of all ^he rest, and that which if
the people had not been accursed to believe Lies, was the invisible Army
quartered under ground at Ragland Castle, discovered by John Davis, servant to
Mistress Lewis an Inne-keeper at Rosse, to Alderman Actons Coachman: except the
blowing up the Thames with Gunpowder to drown the City, one of the most
dangerous plots that ever affrighted London.

And as by their own fictions they endeavored to possess the People with
Iealousies, so whatsoever the King did never wanted a sinister interpretation,
glossed to the multitude, to traduce His actions, as if in them there were ever
some evil intended to the City and Parliament. When the King removed Belfore
from the Lieutenancy of the Tower, and placed Sir Thomas Lunsford in that
charge, the Citizens and their Wives could not sleep quietly in their bedds,
for fear of having their houses beaten down about their ears. To satisfy
their Clamours, though nothing were objected against him, the King reassumes
the Trust, and presently deposites it with Sir John Byron: the Faction were as
ill satisfied in him, yet it was not easy what to object against him: nay it
was a Query that did not a little trouble them in what to quarrel him: at last
Lieutenant Hooker the Aquavite man, and Nicholson the Chandler, complain in
the Common Council, that since Sir John Byron came to be Lieutenant of the
Tower, the Mint (to the great prejudice and dishonor of the Kingdom) stood
still. Those that knew what trade these men drove, by the poor retaile of
Broomes, Candles, and Mustard, their chief merchandise, to improve brass
farthings into Groats and Sixpences, accounted the Objection as inconsiderable
as the Authors that alleged it, yet as mean and false as it was, it served
some men's turns to slander the King to His People, and raise a Clamor. The
King out of the abundant goodness of His Nature, hoping to win them by some
condescendments, (which now the world sees is impossible: Puritans being of
another manner of Temper then to be overcome with kindness) removes Sir John
Byron, and confers this great trust on Sir John Coniers, a man of whom the
Faction it seems conceived better hopes, and indeed hitherto if you consider
his exaction upon the Kings friends in his custody, or retaining the name of
Lieutenant, but resigning the power contrary to his express oath, and that on
his own Petition to the Train bands of the City, he has not given them any
occasion to repent them of their acquiescence in him.

It were endless, Brother Rusticus, to relate all the means used to heighten
the fears of this miserable City, and by consequence of the Kingdom:
especially after the Faction in Parliament, had shown them the way by
publishing that great Buggbeare to affright the People, the Remonstrance of the
state of the Kingdom.

At last to make experiment what good effect all these arts had produced the
maine Engineers resolve on Twelfe night to see what partee they had in the
City, 1641.
and what assistance they might expect (if occasion served) by giving a false
Alarm. To this purpose in the night a Rumor is divulged and suddenly
dispersed through the City, That the King and Cavaleers with fifteen hundred
horse were coming to surprise the City: you would wonder to consider how this
report prevailed, insomuch that in an instant London was in Arms, no less
then 50000 or 60000 men ready provided to encounter they knew not what: the
Women (who as M. Peter's did instruct (...) in the Pulpit, have huggd their
Husbands into this Rebellion) provide hot water (besides what they sprinkled
for fear) to throw on the Cavaleeres: joynt-stooles, foormes, and emp^y tubbes
are thrown into the Streets to intercept the Horse. Had you been at Lord
Majors that night, as I was, you might upon the Aldermens coming to him, to
consult against the common danger, easily perceive which of the Aldermen were
privy to this design, and who were not thought fit to be entrusted with so
great a Mystery: some of them (and when time serves I can tell you their
names) came so neat as if they had spent the whole day to be trim at
midnight, their beards put into a feasting posture, not a hair awry, a clear
demonstration that they had not consulted their pillows that night: Their
Ruffes set as completely as if they had been to dine with the Masters of their
Companies, or were prepared to bear a part in my Lord Majors show: but the
rest that slept in the simplicity of their hearts, and went to bed, so far
from misconceiving their gracious Sovereign to have any evil intention
against the City, that they thoug^t themselves safe under his Protection, these
came in a far different garb, one came in his nightcap and forgot his Hat,
another had his Hat, but did not remember to take his Ruff, one trots along in
his slippers, another for haste not staying to garter his stockings, had lost
them had not his shoo^s (...) on: so that it was easy to distinguish who were
Cons^iding Ald^rmon, as they call them, and who Malignants.

And as by degr^es they wrought the people to this height of Jealousy, so by
degrees too, proportionable to their (...) they disarme the King, and Arm
themselves. At first they did only wrest the Sword out of the Kings Hau^, (...)
as their party grew stronger, they turned the point upon him. When their Fears
were but young, the Faction of the City desired (...) more, but a strong guard
of the Train-Bands, and this (...) called The Safety of the City, when their
Fears grew Stronger, then in a Common Council they move for The Posture of
defense, which was the Egg of which afterward was natched that Cockatrice of
the Militia.

But because it was impossible to disarme the King, as long as the Lord Major
stood firm in his Loyalty, and invested in his power; their maine work
therefore was, first, to pack a Common Council of men of their own Faction,
and then by advancing the power of their Common Council (by the assistance of
the House of Commons) above the Lord Majors, to draw the Voting of all Queryes,
and the Resolution of all doubts, or matters under debate, unto the decision of
a Major part; and if any Obstacle lay in their way to these ends, which was not
in their power to remove, presently at a dead lift, Penington or Ven or Vassels
bring an order from the House of Commons, which never failed to determine all
things, for their own Creatures. And because the Practices of these men deserve
not to be buried in Silence, I shall give you a short account, how the power of
the Militia of the City, came to be taken out of the Lord Major, and Court of
Aldermens hands, and ^eated in a Major part of the Commons; In which you shall
see how a Faction in the City conspired with a Faction in the Parliament, and
this Faction in the Parliament with that in the City, until between both, the
King was enforced, for fear of their tumults, and Insolences, to withdraw
himself into the Country.

The time of Election of Common Council men coming on, at St Thomas day 1641.
When these fears and Jealousies had distracted the City, it was no difficult
matter, for this active faction, to instill into their fellow Citizens how much
it Concerned them to make choice of Godly men (so they miscall themselves) and
such as would oppose the Popish Party, under which notion, they comprehend all
such as stand well affected to the Government established, whether
Ecclesiastical, or Civil. They accuse the Old Common-Councell-men, as men not
Zealous for Religion, Ready to comply with the Court for loanes of Moneys, and
which was worse, many had not only set their hands to, but were active in
promoting the intended Petition, for Episcopacy, and the Book of Common
Prayer. These Objections (which duly considered had been so many convincing
arguments for them) so prevailed, with these silly men, (who thought all to be
in danger, unless the government were put into new hands) that in most Wards,
the old Common Council men were turned out, and new chosen in, wholly devoted
to the Puritan faction; especially in those Wards, where their Aldermen
inclined that way: amongst these, the most remarkable were Atkins, W^llastone,
George Garrat the Draper, Wardner, and Towse. Now outgoe all the grave,
discreet, well-affected Citizens, as Sr George Benyon, M. Drake, M. Roger
Clarke, M. Roger Gardner, Deputy Withers, M. Cartwright, and others, and in
their stead are chosen Fowke the Traitor, Ryley the squeeking Bodyes-maker,
Perkins the Tailor, Norminton the Cutler, young beardlesse Co^lson the Dyer,
Gill the Wine-Cooper, and Iupe the Laten-man in Crooked-Lane, Beadle of the
Ward, in the place of Deputy Withers. So that a man would swear, they meant to
fulfill, what a wise Lord Keeper once spoke to a Recorder of London, dyning
with him, upon occasion of a Wood Cock-Py^ brought to the Table, with the heads
looking out of the Lid, Mr Recorder, you are welcome to a Common Council.

These new men, though chosen on S. Thomas day, are never returned by the
constant custom of the City, before the Monday after Twelfe-day: nor have
power to (...) in the Common Council, or concur in doing any act, before the
Indentures of their Election be returned from the Wardmo^e Inquest to the
Town-Clark, and a Warrant is sued fort^ from the Lord Major, to the Sergeant of
the Chamber to Summon them. Yet in the Year 1641. the small space of time
between S. Thomas day, and the day of this Return, was a very active time:
and that which laid the Groundwork, of that Revolt of this City, from their
Loyalty to Rebellion, which presently followed. Therefore Impatient to stay the
time of their ordinary calling, and knowing the Necessity of their presence for
the advancement of the work in hand, when the King, gave order to the Lord
Major, for calling that Common Council held December, 31. 1641. when the Lord
Newburge was sent from the King, to give the City notice of the late Tumults at
Westminster, and White Hall, and to recommend unto them the Care of preventing
the like disorders, for the time to come. To this Common Council, comes Fowks,
and with him, all the Tribe of this new choice, and mingle with the old; which
being an Intrusion without president, was earnestly opposed by them, that loved
the ancient order, and honor of the City; and foresaw the Inundation breaking
in upon them, yet out of Respect to the Kings Message, and that Lord that
brought it, the controversy for the present was hushed up, and generally, they
applied themselves to give dispatch to the Answer, which they were to return
to the King, which was accordingly done, and the Answer presently after
published in Print.

So, on the 5. of January, being the day after the King went to the House of
Commons to demand the Five Members, a Common Council being called by the Kings
direction to the Lord Major, to which himself in Person came, to impart unto
them, the reasons that induced him to go to the House the day before, and to
admonish them, not to harbor or protect these men in the City. Thither came
Fowke and his new Elected, but not admitted Brethren. Fowke having prepared a
Saucy, Insolent Speech, to make unto the King, concerning Fears, and
Iealousies, touching the Members accused, The Privileges of Parliament, and
that they might not be tried but in a Parliamentary way. The King heard him
with admired patience, and whereas so disloyal expressions, justly deserved
his Royal Indignation, to have sent him to Newgate, or Bride-well (especially
interposing in that Representative body of which, as yet, he was no member.)
The King only returned this short, gracious Answer, bidding him and the rest,
to assure themselves, That they should have a lust Trial, according to the
Laws of the Land; adding, that they were dangerous men, and that neither he,
nor they, could be in safety, as long as these men were permitted to go on in
their way.

It was observed by some, very wise men, there present, that the King at His
coming to the Common Council, was received with Joy, and acclamations; not
much Inferior to those, at His entrance into the City, on His return from
Scotland. But after the reason of His coming was known, and the Puritan Party
had in^tilld into the peoples heads, that the great Patriots of the Kingdom
were in danger, to be called to a Legal Trial, for Treason, at His return,
there was a new face on the Multitude, and instead of God save the King, there
was nothing ecchoed in His ears, but Privileges of Parliament, Privileges of
Parliament! Great is Diana of the Ephesians was never roared louder. The King
dined that day at Sheriff Garrets, and the Faction of the Sectaries,
Brownists, and Anabaptists having time to assemble, after dinner, the house was
beset, and the streets leading unto it thronged with people, Thousands of them
flocking from all parts of the City: and the clamor still was Privileges of
Parliament; which cry first taken up that day, and that, with so good success,
never failed to be Objected to the King, and inculcated to the People, even
unto this day, in all their appeals unto them.

This Tumult sweld to that height, that the King in His return was in great
danger, the people in a most undutifull manner, pressing upon, looking into,
and laying hold on His Coach: nay, in defiance of His sacred Person, and
Authority, that seditious Pamphlet of Walkers, To your Tents O lsrael, was
thrown either into, or very near His Coach: Insomuch, that those few friends,
which the King had in the City, were heartily glad when they heard that the
King was safely arrived at White Hall: for I assure you, His fast friends here
in the City, as the never enough honored Sir Richard Gurney, and Sir Thomas
Gardner the Recorder were in great danger, being pursued with outcryes, as
Remember the Protestation, others calling them half Protesters; nay the Lord
Major had his Chain torn from his neck by a Zealous sister.

This very day, the two Houses (the leaders in both) thinking themselves unsafe
at Westminster, affrighted with their own guilt, resolve to take Sanctuary in
London, knowing, that what ever they had done, or ever should do, though never
so derogatory to the King, never so contrary to Law, yet the Puritan Faction in
the City would afford them not only protection, but power and assistance. Both
Houses therefore adjourn, until the Tuesday following, and cast themselves
into a Committee, to meet at Guild Hall, or Grocers-Hall.

To the Committee at Grocers hall, come the Five Members in great Triumph,
guarded, and attended by the Train-bands, and a strong guard set to secure the
place of their sitting. Now, if ever, was the fatal conspiration of Time and
Place, for Coining new unheard of Privileges of Parliament, not only to the
securing the persons of Traitors, but Justifying Treason it self: For here was
(before this day) the unheard of Privilege of Parliament declared, That no
Member of Parliament ought to be arrested by any warrant whatsoever, without
consent of that House, whereof he is a Member, and by the same Ordinance it was
declared, That they that shall arrest these Members are enemies to the State:
with free liberty granted for all persons to harbor or converse with them: In
all which, it is evident, that the power and strength of London were made the
first obstruction of the free course of Justice, and the City made the Asylum,
and Sanctuary of those, whom the King had justly declared Traitors.

And now, having undoubted experience of the affection of the City, all eyes
being turned from White Hall, to Grocers Hall, where the Darlings of the People
were pompously feasted, and fawningly courted: on Saturday the eight of Ian.
1641. the Committee consult, how the accused Members might come to Westminster;
the Tuesday following, and without any long debate, it was resolved upon the
question, That the Sheriffs of London should, and might raise a guard of the
Traine-bands, for the defense of the King and Parliament; and that they might
warrantablely march out of their Liberties, and that you may see that the Scene
was right laid, there were some ready at that instant to make a tender of the
assistance of the Seamen and Mariners, whose power should guard them by Water,
as the Train-bands by Land. Next day being Sunday, every Pulpit that was at
their devotion, sounded nothing but the praise of Kimbolton and the Five
Members: inciting the People to stand up in the defense of these w^rthies: else
if they permitted the King to take away these to day, he might go on to seize
on as many more to Morrow, until he had left the Parliament naked of all good
Patriots, and Zealous assertors of Religion, the Laws, and Liberties of the
Kingdom.

On Monday the tenth of Ian. 1641. the King hearing of these great
Preparations, an Army by Land, and a Navy by Sea, which was to cast ancre
against White Hall, suddenly, (and certainly guided byan immediate providence,
which in a peculiar manner watched over Kings) resolved with his ever glorious
Queen, the Prince, and the Duke of York, to withdraw to Hampton Court, which
accordingly He did: not leaving (though well he might) His curse behind him
upon London, as Henry the third of France did on Paris, fowly provoked in the
like manner; who flying from the City and the Holy League the Parallel of this
Treason here, at Chaliot, turning toward it, said, I give thee my Curse,
disloyal, and ungrateful City, The French Hist. p. ^ 805.
a City which I have always honored with my continual abode, a City which I
have enriched more then any of my Predecessors, I shall never enter within the
compass of thy walls, but by the ruin of a great and Memorable breach.

The King, now, no better then fled from London, and the apparent dangers
there, the whole strength of the City remained at the disposal of a Faction of
Puritans in the Parliament, and a Faction of Puritans in the City. That very
Monday, on which the King for his safety from these Tumults, withdrew himself
(and it is a wonder that any man should be so frontlesse to deny, that for that
reason, and that reason only, he withdrew himself) was the return made of the
Indentures of the Election of the Common councell-men, and if any election was
questioned, as some were, and that most justly, 'twas truly observed, that the
decision, never failed to go on their side, who were last elected, whether it
were right, or wrong: for whereas formerly all controversies of this Nature
were submitted to the determination of the Lord Major and Court of Aldermen
only, now by the impetuousnesse, and Clamor of Fowke, and his adherents, it
must be referred to a Committee of the Common Council, the same Committee
which was for the Safety, the first step which the Puritans made toward the
Militia.

Having thus put the King to flight, and by most indirect unwarrantable
Practices, turned most of the discreet able men of the City, out of the
Common Council, they begin to put the City into a True Posture of Rebellion,
which they called, the Posture of Defense, and was the Second step to the
Militia: and for the Committee of this Posture of Defense, they nominate Six
Aldermen, and twelve Commoners, most of them being of this last election. And
to have a leader for the intended Rebellion, upon Ven's Recommendation; Skippon
for his Council, and advice, is added as an Appendix to the Committee. And
though a great debt lay on the Chamber of London, which was often Complained
off, but never paid, yet Sergeant Major General Skippon, (so many are the
Syllables of his new honors) is ordered by act of Common Council, to have
300^ a year, out of the Treasury for Orphans, during his life, if he should so
long continue in the City service.

A strong Party being thus made, they begin to make all manner of Warlike
Preparations, and provide Ammunition of all sorts: they increase the number of
the Train-bands, from six, to eight Thousand, and appoint over them six
Aldermen, to be Colonells, each Colonel to have his Captains, Officers,
Colors, and Regiment, to be assigned him by the Committee for the Posture of
Defense: and yet as if all this had been to no purpose, unless they can make
the Lord Major (a shrewd rub in the way) a mere Cipher, and reduce their
Governor, to so mean a condition, as to be only their instrument, they
entrench upon his power, and invade it many ways.

First, therefore, whereas the power of summoning Common-councells, resided
only in the Lord Major, who, with the advice of some Aldermen, was to judge of
the Reasons inducing him, to assemble this Representative body, now by Orders
from the House of Commons, at the instance of Pennington, Ven, and Vassells,
the Lord Major is not left to his own judgment, when to call or not to call a
Common Council, but must do it, as often as the Men of this Faction shall
command him: which usurped power, both Ven and Fowkes have used with that
insolency, that when they have required Sir Richard Gurney to call a
Common Council, and he has demanded a reason, they have vouchsafed him no
other answer, then this saucy one, that when he came thither he should know.

Secondly, as the power of calling Common-councels was trusted by their Charter
and Long prescription, with the Lord Major, so the power of dissolving them,
was put into the same hands, he might rise in the midst of a debate, and
dismiss the assembly, and yet was not bound to give them an account, why he
did so; but now, partly by violence, and partly by pretended orders from the
House of Commons, he is fastened to his seat, there he must sit, until Ven and
Fowkes and the rest have no farther use of him.

Thirdly, heretofore, when a Common Council was called, nothing could be put
to the Question, or proposed as the Subject of their deliberation, but what the
Lord Major by the Recorder did offer unto them; but now, when they could not
prevail with the Major to command the Recorder, nor with the Recorder without
the Lord Majors consent, to propose what the Faction pleased, by the
Omnipotency of an order, from the House of Commons, they make the dumb to
^^eak, what Ven and the rest will have them: or else the Lord Major and the
Recorder must answer it ^t a Committee.

Lastly, whereas the Lord Major and Ald^rmen sit apart, from the Commons, and
are (...), when the others are bareheaded, and have a Negative Voice, the itch
of incorporating two in one, has been as great in the City, as ever it was at
Westminster, and with (...) success; for the faction here (upon the point)
have cast all into a common huddle, blending the Court of Aldermen with the
Commons* Upper, and Lower, sound as harshly here, as Westward: And though in
outward appearance, they remain two distinct Members, of one body, yet, in
power, they have made both, Level, Involving the Votes of the Major and
Aldermen in the major part of the Commons.

The Puritan Faction, by the assistance of the House of Commons* having thus
gotten the power to call Common-councells, power to continue them, power to put
to the Question what they please, and power to determine all by a Major part,
my Lord Major having no more sway then Perkins the Tailor, Rily the Bodies
maker, or Nicholson the Chandler, they may dispose of the Wealth and Power of
the City as they please: now the two Factions openly communicate Counsills,
walk hand in hand, that 'twas a question, which was the Parliament, that at
Westminster, or this at Guile-hall.

Toward the end of January 1641. the Commons house Petitioned the King
touching the Tower, the Forts, and the Militia, and as two strings set to the
same tune, though on two several Violls, at a convenient distance, if you
touch one, the other by consent renders the same sound, so, the House of
Commons, and the Common Council of this City, were now grown to such a
Sympathy, that the motions, and endeavors of one, were the work of both: that
you would swear, Fowkes was as much a Parliament man here, as Ven at
Westminster: for before February was ten days old, there was a
Common Council held, in which many things were debated: the Court was
continued long, until one of the Clock: at last, tired out with long sitting,
and willing to rise, Ven, taking advantage of the present indisposition of the
Court, to sit longer, ready to admit proposalls, without any strict scanning,
(especially since whatsoever passed that Common Council, was to undergo a
second consideration at the next, as their constant custom is) produces an
Order from the House of Commons, by which, they were desired to return such
men's names, with whom the City thought fit to entrust the Militia of London.

The Court, surprised with so unexpected a Message for the present, not
piercing into the reason of it, nor understanding that the Houses were in so
great forwardness to settle the Militia, as afterward they found they were,
nor imagining that the men, whose names they returned, should have absolute
power to execute any thing of themselves, but only as a Committee to consult,
and prepare, and report to the Common Council, as the limited power of all
Committees is, and, considering that the Posture of Defense, and the new
Militia, though two names, were in effect but one the same thing, Ordered that
the names of the Com^ittee, for the (...), should be sent to the House in
return to their order. The Intention of the House, (as some think) in this
Message, (though for my part, if I were put to my oath I dare not swear it)
was, to indeare the City, and to lay an Obligation upon them by giving them
power to nominate their own men: But Ven (instructed by some, that had more
wit, but as little honesty as himself) his purpose in the carriage of this
business was, to make the Lord Major, the Sheriffs and Court of Aldermen, by
their own voluntary, but Inconsiderate act, to renounce (as it were) their
own Interest, and so, to place this great power of the Militia on the
Committee for the posture of Defense, whereof the Major part, if not all, were
of his own Faction.

Many days had not passed, before it was generally known, to the great Regret
of all Loyal discreet men, That the Militia of London, was put in the hands of
the Committee for the posture of Defense. Not long after, a Common Council was
called, at which, when the orders made the last meeting, (as the Custom is)
were read, at this, many men seeing the snare, into which unwittingly they had
cast themselves, began to retract, and speak against that order, whereby the
Committee for the Posture of Defense, were invested with the power of the
Militia: nay, some of the Aldermen, whose names were returned, for the new
Militia, utterly protested against it: affi^ming, that when they passed that
order, they had not the least Intention, to exclude the Lord Major, from having
power over the Militia, nor had any thought, to place so absou^u^e power in
their Committee, as (they found) the two Houses had done: and hereupon, by some
that stood well affected to the honor, and peace of the City, it was earn^stly
moved, that the Houses might be Petitioned to reverse their Order, but all in
vain: the Faction in the Common Council being instructed by their Leaders, at
what advantage they had the City, were resolved, not to Lose it, by giving way
to such a Motion: but on the Contrary, to make all sure, Ven produces another
order from the House of Commons, That Skippon, whom the Committee for the
posture of Defense, had associated (...) for his advice, and assistance,
should, by their Assent, be ^^ded to the same Committee for the Militia: which
was no sooner move^* (...) assented unto, the Major part of the Common Council
(who now rule the rest) will have it so.

The Court of Aldermen finding (but too too late) that this settlement of the
(...), would be no small derogation to the (...) and the Government of the City
in general; and being out of all h^pe to find the Commons ^^ady to Join with
them, in such a Petition, resolve (without them) to petition, that this Order
of so dangerous Consequence might be (...) and Sheriffs be nominated of the
Committee. To this end petitions are ^amed, and delivered, but to no pu^pose;
the Lord (...), was too well known, to be admitted, to h^ve any share in that
power which was intended to be employed against the King.

Notwithstanding this Repulse, diverse Ci^izens, very Consi^erable for their
number, but more considerable for their Quality and abilities, out of a sense
of that great Comtempt and prejudice which this would bring upon that ancient
Government, ^^der which their City had so long flourished, join in a petition
in their own names, to the two Houses, to the same effect, but with worse
Success^; for the House of Commons, having Information what was in agitation in
the City, send Wa^^ Long to ^eize on the Petition, and the Subscriptions; by
which means, the Names of the Subscribers (...) there wanted not arts to make
them retract their own voluntary act: some by persuasions, and private
solicitations, others intimidated by threats, and Menaces, are Compelled to
recent, and because it was a Note of Lev^ty, if not worse, so suddenly to
protest against their own voluntary Act, therefore the Decoy to bring on the
Rest, to so base, ^o^unworthy a Revolt, was Lemhall the Speakers Brother, which
Example (he having broke the Ice) was followed by many, that Loved an Ignoble
quietness, before freedom, with Trouble.

This last Petition was that which they call Benyons petition^ and indeed Sir
George Beny^n was (and he needs not be ashamed of it) a Framer, and a chief
promoter of that most reasonable, most equitable Petition: which
notwithstanding was made that great crime, that afterward drew on his
Impeachment, and heavy Gensure in Parliament. Id which Sentence, the World may
see what gross* Injustice and partiality was used by them, th^^ would be
angry, not to be thought the most upright, unblemished Iustitiaries in the
world. The Christmas before (which we^ now must call Nativity Tide) the Lord
Mayor, and the Recorder, were convented before a Committee for obstructing the
Apprentizes petition, against Episcopacy; and learned Peard (^ho has no more
Law then what was made this Parliament) sitting in the Chair, told them, that
it was against the freedom and Liberty of the Subject, not to permit them
(without any Let or Interruption) to present their grievances in paper to the
Parliament, Nay for fear they should want work, there was an order published
in print by the House of Commons to that very purpose; yet Sir George for
making use of the same Liberty, which themselves had proclaimed, is sentenced
thus: First, fined in three Thousand pounds. Secondly, disfranchized, utterly
deprived of the privileges of the City. Thirdly, never to bear any Office in
the Kingdom. Fourthly, to be committed prisoner to Colchester Jail for two
years, and lastly, at the expitation of that term to give security for the
good behavior, such, as the Parliament if they then sare) should then think
fitting, and in case the Pariament were dissolved, such as the Lord Keeper for
the time being should approve of: how will this Sentence, for ever justify the
severest, that were ever given, either in the Star Chamber, or High Commission,
That did doom a man to ruin, for no other fault, then what themselves had
authorized, and judged it against the Liberty of the Subject, to oppose it,
even by their own Order.

The Committee for the posture of Defense, being by these dishonest practices
made Lords of the Militia, and being armed with as much power as will, to serve
the most desperate, Treasonable designs, which either Say, or Pym should
suggest, they now go on without check or controu^e, and beat down all
before them that stand in their way. On Trivial pretenses, or for necessary
obedience to the Kings Just Commands, they remove honest Sir Richard Gurney*
(whose name in after Chronicles will outshine famous Walworths, and upbraid
this Rebellious City to all posterity) from the Government of the City, and
(...) his place substitute Little Isaac, rejecting the Olive, and advancing
that Bramble, out of which I fear will come that Fire, which will consume this
seditious City. Now the People are authorized by Ord^nance of both Houses, and
encouraged and pressed even in point of Conscience, by their Boutefeau
Lecturers, to List horses in Moorefields, send in money and plate to Guild Hall
for the service of the King and Parliament, and because they would be sure to
have an Orator in every Pulpit to quicken the people, to pour out their wealth
Liberally, to further the Rebellion intended, they cause the very dregs, and
s^um of every Parish, to petition against the Orthodox Clergy: who being
imprisoned, or fle, they sequester their Livings, for the use of their own
Levites: so that at this day, there is not a true Orthodox Minister left,
freely speaking his Conscience, and exercising his Ministry in the whole City:
so that whatsoever they pretend, that they take up Arms for the defense of the
Protestant Religion, if they mean the Protestant Religion, as it is by Act of
Parliament established in the Church of England, I assure you, Brother, were
you here, you could no more see a face of the Church of England, then you can
at Amsterdam.

They have not only banished all Decency and Order, together with the
established Liturgy, out of our Churches, but in stead of the Gospel, our new
Preach^rs entertain their Auditories with news, which upon examination prove
but fictions and Lies to blind the people, or else with bitter invectives
against the King and his Government: and as for Faith, Charity, and Repentance,
they are laid aside as impertinent arguments: all their exhortations now, are
to Treason and Rebellion: So that, as in the Holy League of France, as my
Author speaks, our pulpits are made the Chaires of Iuglers. Nay, the very
Sacraments escape not their Blasphemy and Profanation ^o these vile purposes:
I doubt not but you have heard of M. Case his Invitation of the Congregation to
the Lords Table, who in stead of you that do truly and earnestly repent you of
your sins, and be in Love and Charity with your Neighbors, and intend to
lead a new Life, etc. bespake them thus: You that have freely and liberally
Contributed to the Parliament, for the defense of Gods cause and the Gospels,
draw near: To the rest he threatened Damnation, as com^^ing unworthily to the
holy Sacrament: it were endless to (...) unto you, (it deserves some man's
labor in particular) to acquaint you, and the Kingdom, with the Blasphemies,
Prophanations, and Absurdities, which he and his Brethren in Evil, vent every
day in their Extemporary Prayers and Sermons.

Yet were a^l this Treason set out mixed with wit, or did they preach Rebellion
aduantag'd by the alluring helps of art and El^quence, it might persuade some
amongst us not to turn Recusa^ts from their Assemblies: but they are the
d^yest, and the dullest beasts that ever peepd over a pulpit: while these
remain in the City, Rotheram the Lecturer, never needs fear to be heard in
his deprecation, that we might never see such a famine here in London, as was
once in Samaria, where an Asses head was sold for fourscore pieces of Silver,
Thanks to him and the rest, we have great plenty here, and while we have so
many, there is no fear that they will ever rise to so high a price.

But when people are disposed unto a Re^ellion, small helps will serve their
Turn, a Rams-Horne is as good as Shebahs Trumpet: yet they have one art (and I
may not forg^t it, because it takes much with the People) and it is this, you
shall have one, and the same argument possess most of our Pulpit, on the same
day, the same matter, is the Subject, ^i^her of their railing invectives, or
Rebellious Exhortations. The undiscerning multitude, not piercing into this
Imposture, f^ndly are persuaded, that this is no less then the inspiration of
the Holy Ghost, when God knows, this is no more, then an I^timation given from
the Heads of the Faction, to Calamy, and the Iunto that meet at his house, from
whom their Emissaries receive direct^ons, what concerns the present
opportunity, and is necess^ry to be pre^ched unto the people.

By these and the like Arts, it is a w^nder to see, what ^orces have been
raised, what sums have been advanced, and pour^d out, to further this
Rebellion; It is the Opinion of very wise men amongst us here, that have
observed the several h^lpes, which the City of London ha^h contributed to this
present unnatural War, that they have supplied the Treasury of the Rebels,
with no less, then Three Millions of money, and their A^my with threescore
Thousand men, first (...), then recre^^ing their mangled, b^aten Regiments, at
so great Expense both of Treasure and Blood has this proud unthankful City
been, to disthrone the King, and r^ine the Kingdom.

And that they might not want supplies of men, to keep this Rebellion on Foot,
they have cancelled, or dispensed with all the Obligations and Ties of
Religion, Nature and Laws; They have given the Son power not only without,
but contrary to the parents commands to List himself, and take entertainment
in their Army, the same liberty they have given to Apprentises, and Servants,
to take Arms, not only without, but contrary to the command of their Masters
and Mistresses. How many poor P^rents, how many poor Tradesmen, nay, how
many poor Widows, and their distressed Orphans, be here in this City, that
had no other Subsistence but what was hardly earned by their Children, or
Apprentises industry and labor, are now all like to starve, or are
necessitated to fly to the Alms of the Parish (though the poores stock it
self be invaded and spent in this War) while those that fed them are left in
this unnatural Rebellion? Nay how many disconsolate parents have you in the
Country, that sent their Children hither to this City, and gave great sums
with them, to bind them Apprentises to Trades, and Manufactures, hoping that
hereafter they might live like men, nay, perhaps some of their Mothers out of
an overweaning opinion, might fancy to themselves, hopes, that they might live
to see their sons Lord Majors of London, (and why not?) that now sit
mourning, and wringing their hands, and curse the day not only in which they
sent them hither, but in which they were borne, not because they have lost a
Leg or an Arm^, or returned maimed, so that all they can hope for is to have
entertainment in an Hospital, and that no longer neither, then till the Kings
maimed Soldiers shall come, and tell them that that Charity was never provided
for men disabled fighting against their King, but because they have lost their
lives, and not only their lives but their precious souls too, dying in a
grievous sin, in the very act of Rebellion? methinks you in the Country, (if
there be any bowels of compassion yearning over the fruit of your bodies; if
there be any sense of that eternal condition that does attend them after this
life, if there be any hope of the joys of Heaven, or fear of the Torments of
Hell) should be very sensible of this.

And though God has manifestly fought against them, for the King, giving him
victory in many Battles, when all humane helps, and advantages were on the
Robells side, though God has miraculonsly, and beyond the hope of m^n restored
unto Him, the hearts of the people, (which the heads of this Rebellion, by
slanders had stolen from Him:) th^ugh from small, and contemptible beginnings
in the eyes of His enemies (few or (...) for Him but God, and the just^ce of
his Cause) God has prosp^red Him into many mighty Armies, which ^ender him
formidab^e to the proudest, and stoutest of the Rebels; ^^ough every Victory
has been seconded by a (...) of peace, and with an overture of pacification,
so that as himself spe^kes in (...) Declaration Pu^lished July, ^^ ^643. He
could not probably (...) unden the Scandalous Imp^^^tion which ha^h usually
(...) His Messages of p^ace, (...) they proceed from the W^ak^esse of His P^^er
^ot l^ve of His People. Lastly^ though like a^ ind^^gent Father of R^bellious
Children, He has (...) his City, and VVood it, by many pardons, many and often
repeated Acts of Grace and Favor to recall us to our former Loyalty, ((...) we
were Loyal) yet, inconsiderate, unthankful wretches as we are, we overlooke,
or slight all these invitations; For (...) we have added this, as the
complement of our other R^bellions, that (whether more unthankfully or
undutifully I ^^^^not tell) we have cast dirt in our Sovereigns fa^^, and
(...) the foo^stpes of Gods Anointed, as if he were guilty of all (...)
Miseries, which at this time threaten the subversion of this Na^^on: we will no
longer wrong our King secretly, through (...) sides of His evil Counselors,
or Cavallers, but ^hrage him (...), and point blanke, as in that most seditious
Declaration, or what every you will call it, presented by Sir David Watkins,
and that broken Citizen, out at elbowes, called Satin Shute, to the
Common Council, and by them to the remainder of the (...) House, if it be not
breach of privilege to call it so.

How willing have we ob^yed every Commandment, except God, and the Kings* How
forward have we been, to employ the large Revenues of our several Companies,
and Brotherhoods, (as heretofore to excess, and gluttony, so now) to support
this, Reb^llion? how ready* even b^yond our Ab^lities, have we bin to, submit
to every Tax, and illegal Impistion: even to the bondage, and sl^very of
(...), b^ which we are not so much Proprietaries of our own, as Stewards, or
Cashieres to the heads of the Rebellion: and all this to no other end but to
keep up the Rebellion: we have not only protected, and supported the Kings
Mortal Enemies, but as much as in us lay, have persecuted all His Friends, or,
if but suspected to stand well-affected to Him, and the Justice of his cause,
not sparing the effusion of I^nocent blood, as that of M. Tomkins, and M.
Chaloner, which like the blood of Abel, calls loud to Heaven for vengeance, on
this bloody City, and Q^^stionlesse will in time be heard; For not Content to
buy these men's bloods with great sums of moneys which could not be advanced
but on this Condition, that M. Tomkins, and M. Chaloner, be delivered up to
their pleasure, and murdered for a strange Conspiracy called Obedience to the
King: but being dead, in an unheard of barbarousnesse they press into the
houses, where their dead bodies lay, before their Funerals, and thinking they
could never be sure enough, of so great a guilt, they will not believe that
they are dead, unless they force the houses to see the bodies of them whom
themselves had murdered; Insomuch, that to avoid further violence and rage of
the Citizens, they were feign to set open the doors where their bodies say,
and expose them to the view of all, that so they might glut themselves with
beholding that sad spectacle which themselves had made.

That the Kings Gracious offers of Peace have been slighted, and rejected,
with scorn, and Con^empt, and His Messengers that brought them, (contr^ry to
the Law of Arms, and Nations) Impriso^ed; That those miserabl^ distractions,
which have rent, and (...) this flourishing Kingdom, are so far from being
closed, that they are rather made wider, That the sword of War, so long
d^vouring, is not yet sheathed, except in one another bowels, That this
Kingdom is still made, the Scene of Marthers, Rapines, Oppression, and
P^nderings, and whereon all the horrid acts of rage, and injustice are every
day acted, and the Nation put almost out of hope, ever to enjoy her former
Peace, and plenty, is our fault and ours wholly: Had not the heads of this
Rebellion been anima^ed by this City, and Encouraged by promises of more
supplies of men, and Mo^ies, They had long (...) this laid down their Arms,
and come with halters about their necks, and cast themselves at the Kings feet,
submissely begging those Pardons, which they have presumptuously rejected: Time
was, when the two Houses gave a Law to the City, now it is come to that pass,
that the City prescribes to the Relics of the two Houses; They must not
Conclude of War or Peace, without consulting the City; if they do, they
reckon without their Host.

Nay, though Fairfax be utterly routed in the North, and William, once surnamed
Conqueror, be totally defeated in the West, yet they can neither be persuaded,
nor beaten into thoughts of Peace: on the 20 July last, no longer ago, many
Thous^nds (as the printed Paper tells you) preferred a Petition to the House of
Commons, presented by M. Norbury of the Cursitors office, and John Ha^ an
Attorney of Guild Hall, both pernicious men: which as it evidently shows their
Obstinate aversion from Peace, so it is the most desperate divellish slander,
that ever yet durst look the World in the Face; for first they tell the House
of Commons, and in them, the World, That the King without any touch of
Conscience, and in defiance of God, has raised an Army of Papists, Out-lawes,
and Traitors, for the Robbing, Burning, Murdering, and destroying of His
Relgiious, Honest, and well meaning People, And then knowing not only their
Interest in, but their power over the House of Commons, they do not so much
Petition, as Co^^and them to accept of their assistance, for the raising a new
Army, and in express Terms prescribe unto them, and limit them to a Committee
of their own nomination, for the seizing and receiving of such Sums, as the
willing shall think fit to offer, or they shall think fit to extort from the
^^willing for this service: And that you may Judge of the whole Bunch, by some,
they name Pennington the pretended Lord Major, Strode, one of the five Members,
Harry Marti^ Plunder-master-Generall, and Dennis Bend Burgess of Dorchester*
and P^^riarch Whites own disciple, a man of a double Capacity to be a Rebel,
and finding themselves more alone in these undertakings then they did imagine,
like desperate Traitors, they call on the whole Kingdom, a^ one man according
to the intent of the late Covenant, to join with them in this Rebellion. And
having thus taken a course to raise new forces, on Saturday the 29 of July, at
a Common Hall, they voted Sir William Waller, General of their new intended
Army, whom to indeare the more, they interest him in the Government of the
City, hoping that being as mad as his Lady, he will hold up the Rebellion, as
long as he can, and then be one of the last to run away: I mean not from
Battle, for in that he showed himself as forward as the foremost, but from
Justice, and the due reward of his disloyalty. By all which it is most evident,
that this Languishing Rebellion had before this day gasp'd its last, and given
up the Ghost, had not this Rebellious City by its wealth, and Multitudes,
fomented it, and given it life.

If therefore Posterity shall ask, who broke down the bounds, to those
streams of blood, that have stained this earth; if they ask, who made Liberty
captive, Truth criminal, Rapine just, Tyranny and Oppression Lawful: who
blanched Rebellion, with the specious pretense of defense of Laws, and
Liberties, War with the desire of an established Peace, Sacrilege and
Profanation, with the show of Zeal, and Reformation: Lastly, if they ask who
would have pulled the crown from the Kings head, taken the government off the
hinges, dissolved Monarchy, inslaved the Laws, and ruined their Country; say,
'Twas the proud, unthankefull, Schismatic, Rebellious, Bloody City of
London, so that what they wanted of devouring this Kingdom by cheating and
couzening, they mean to finish by the Sword.

That therefore these dangerous defluxions, and continual, not small
distillations, but floods of Men, Money, Ammunition, and Arms descending from
the Head City, and Metropolis of the Kingdom, may not for ever dissolve the
nerves, and luxate the Sinews of this admirably composed Government: it will
highly concern this Nation to look about them, to undeceive themselves, and
to consult their own peace and safety, by joining with their Gracious
Sovereign, in chastizing these rebellious insolences, and reducing this
Stubborn City either to Obedience or Ashes.

Yet that the World may not think, that this inundation of wickedness wherein
the Devils of Rebellion rage in the Children of disobedience, has involved all
of us in the same disoyalty, let not ( good Brother) the name Rusticus neither
deter you, (as if it were a Solecisme, to tell the Murders, Robberies,
Plunderings, and other Ou^rages, committed in the City, nor deprive us (a
handful of faithful Subjects in comparison of the Rebels, the Puritans,
Brownists, and Anabaptists) of so great an Opportunity, to justify our
Innocence. Let the Country know, that we have been at the charges, to undo,
not only them, but our selves too, the Collosse which we have built, is fallen
on the builders, the Fire which we have kindled, devoures the bellows which
first blowed it up; some of us repent of our fond credulity to be deceived, and
fooled by the empty name of a Parliament, God grant it be not too late; yet how
ever, let Posterity know this too, that the King has his Martyrs in London,
all are not in the Country; And to make this good, secretly (as much as the
close obstructions of the ways of conveyance will permit) you shall not fail
of Intelligence from

Your affectionate Brother MERCURIUS CIVICUS.
London, Aug. 5. 1643,
