EDINBURGH: Printed by Evan Tyler, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majesty.
1647.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE COMMITTEE OF ESTATES, The humble Remonstrance of
the Commissioners of the General Assembly, met at Edinburgh the 13. of
October, 1647.
AS there has been very lately a public an^ solemn Thanksgiving, for the
great mercies and deliverances which God has wrought for this Nation, after
he had brought it very low; So the dangers which are interwoven with our
deliverances are very great, and still growing greater and greater. This also
comes forth from the Lord of Hosts, who is wonderful in Counsel and
excellent in Working, that we may not be secure, or think that all our storms
are overpast, but may serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice in trembling, and be
the more stirred up to watchfulness, circumspection, and zeal, in all the
duties which the condition of this time calls for.

We therefore in the discharge of that great trust which is committed to us,
and according to the duty of Watchmen set upon this Watchtower, cannot be
silent in a time of so great danger, but hold it incumbent to us humbly and
faithfully to report and Remonstrate to your Lordships, That the dangers of the
true Reformed Religion and Cause of God in this whole Island, wereby the late
General Assembly their Declaration communicated to your Lordships, discovered
to be in many respects so great and so imminent, as might justly minister
occasion to your Lordships in your wisdom to think of some more effectual
means and remedies for preventing or removing such dangers, although they
could not now be aggravated by any new emergents. Nevertheless, we have too
great cause to conceive that the dangers of Religion are now grown greater
then they were at the time of the General Assembly.

And even since the time of publishing your Lordships Act concerning the
disbanding of the Army in this Kingdom; The wise and mavelous providence of
God is making answer and proclaiming aloud in both our ears, That the danger
is become greater and more imminent, for the waters of the present deluge are
grown many cubits higher since that time; for evidence whereof, the Kings
Majesty's late answer to the Propositions of both Kingdoms may be in stead of
many demonstrations. It is our great grief that we have cause to say so, but we
must speak to the matter as it is, and unless we would shut our eyes, we
cannot but behold in that answer, a threefold growing danger to Religion. For
first, His Majesty professes, that as when the Propositions were offered to
him at Newcastle, he could not agree to some of them without violation of his
Conscience and Honor, so neither can he agree to others of them now,
conceiving them more disproportionable to the present condition of affairs
then when they were formerly presented to him, as being destructive to the
principal interests of the Army: So that his Majesty's disagreeing being now
more enlarged and of a greater latitude then before, if his Majesty's former
answer to the Propositions was justly conceived to be unsatisfactory in point
of Religion, this last does much less satisfy; for although his Majesty did
not in his former answer agree to the Covenant, and other material
Propositions concerning Relegion, yet there was in that answer some part of
satisfaction even to the Propositions concerning Religion: whereas in the late
answer, even that part of satisfaction is by the foresaid expression unsettled
in stead of being adhered unto: We shall pass that clause in the answer which
owneth the interests of the Army so far as to prejudice the more public
interests of both Kingdoms in those Propositions agreed upon after mature
deliberation by both Parliaments.

Secondly, His Majesty's waving the Propositions of both Kingdoms, and
pressing the Proposals of the Army to be the subject of a Treaty, does yet
further increase the danger of Religion, seeing those Proposals as they omit
and abandon the former desires of both Kingdoms in point of Religion, so they
cannot avoid (as the words stand) the continuing of Prelacy, the toleration of
Heresies and Sects, and the taking away of the Ordinance injoyning the taking
of the Covenant, as is more fully expressed in the Declaration of the late
General Assembly.

Thirdly, His Majesty's answer does also divide that joint and common interest
of both Kingdoms in the Propositions, which was formerly the ground of a joint
Treaty of both with his Majesty: Hereby (whatever may be the prejudice
otherwise) surely Religion will suffer not a little, forasmuch as the
Propositions concerning the Covenant of the three Kingdoms, and the Uniformity
between them in Religion, are by this means in effect excluded from the
Treaty, the joint desires and common concernments of the Kingdoms in point of
Uniformity in Religion being no part of the subject of a Treaty with either
Kingdom severally, but of a Treaty with both jointly.

Yet his Majesty's answer to the Propositions is not the only danger to be now
looked upon in this business, for even since that answer was given, this
common Cause and Covenant has been yet further weakened and dangerously
wounded, by the late strong endavoures in England, to move the Parliament to
establish by their Authority a toleration of Sectaries, and to slight and lay
aside such of the Propositions of Peace as concern the Covenant, and the joint
interest of the Kingdoms in Religion. It adds grief to our sorrow, that we
have cause tormention the new persecutions raised there by means of the
Sectaries, against diverse who have been zealous and active for the good of
Religion, King and Kingdoms. Yea, they who plead so much for liberty of
conscience to themselves, allow so little of it to others who differ from them,
that they can now make up a charge, either of constructive Treason, or of high
crimes and misdemeanors against them, for such particulars as do upon the
matter amount to no more but zealous endeavors in opposing the way of the
Sectaries. Neither common sense, nor Christian sympathy can suffer us to
conceive that the cause of Religion is in no greater danger then before, when
persecution is growing daily more and more hot against such as have most
appeared against or endeavored to hinder the late unsufferable exorbitancies
of the Sectaries.

While the danger of Religion is thus increased abroad, we cannot say that it is
grown any whit less at home, but rather greater: for beside the dangerous
influence which the growing power of the enemies of the Covenant in England is
like to have upon this Kingdom, the Malignant faction at home has not so much
decreased in profession, as increased in design and practice against this
Cause and Covenant; Surely they who are disaffected in this Nation, being many,
are as malicious as before, when very shortly after the expedition into
England, perceiving no force within the Kingdom to resist them, they took Arms
and disturbed the public Peace: And if they were so ready to stir when that
Army was but out of the Kingdom, how much more if it shall be disbanded? Some
enemies are still in the fields, and in actual Rebellion within this Kingdom;
and there is too great cause to fear that many others who retain their former
principles and continue in their former designs against this Cause shall not
be flow to take up Arms, if your Lordships lay them down.

And so much the more may this be expected, because as their pride and
insolency is of late grown more intolerable upon the hopes of disbanding the
Army, so there are many of them enraged, as Beeres robbed of their whelps, or
as Wolves of the evening, being also desperate of mending their broken estates,
except it be in public combustions; Others of them are animated and emboldened
by the great favor and indulgence which has been showed toward them in their
Delinquencies, in so much that they are thereby hardened from repenting of
their Rebellion, or compliance with Rebels, and even bless themselves for a
better lot, easier yoke, and lighter burden then those who have been most real
and active for the Covenant.

These dangers of Religion we have insisted upon, as being most proper for us
to speak to, and not as we were insensible of the great danger of the Kings
Person, and of Monarchical Government, for preserving of which, according to
our Covevenant our prayers and best endeavoures shall not be wanting. And now
the danger of Religion in all these being so great, and the grounds of our
fears and apprehensions being so pregnant, we earnestly beseech and humbly
obtest your Lordships, in the bowels of Jesus Christ, and by the vows of God
which are upon you, that as your Lordships desire God, and your own
consciences, and the posterity may not afterward charge upon you the ruin of
Religion, King and Kingdoms, so your Lordships may be very tender and
conscionable that no such design be entertained or get place among you, as
tends to the disabling of this Church and Kingdom, from an effectua^l
prosecuting and promoting of the ends of the Covenant, or to the strengthening
and inabling the enemies thereof, by affording them the opportunity which they
wait for, to disturb again the Peace, and to destroy the present Reformation.
These and no better effects can be looked for if the Army in this Kingdom which
has been so blessed of God, and so faithful to you, shall be disbanded before
this Cause which so much concerns the glory of God, the Reformation and
defense of Religion, the Peace and safety of the Kingdoms, the Honor and
happiness of the King, be settled upon a firm foundation.

In this our humble desire we are not biased with any respect to any
particular party or interest: Our witness is in heaven and within our own
breasts, that we speak for the interest of Religion and of the Cause of God;
neither does that which we desire tend to a new War, but to the preventing of a
new War; nor to the increasing of burdens on the Kingdom, but to the
preventing of greater burdens: Nor is it our desire alone, but many others are
equally sensible with us of the great danger which may accrue to this Cause
from the disbanding of that Army. It is not unobserved that most of those who
are active for the laying down of Arms are such as were against the taking up
of Arms in this Cause; However since there can be no assurance in humane reason
that the Kingdom shall need no Army, we humbly offer it to your Lordships most
serious thoughts, how far, a new state of the Question, setting aside the
Covenant, (which some late debates both here and in England give us cause to
fear) and the raising or employing of another Army (which we also apprehend and
expect if this Army were once disbanded) may be prejudicial and even
destructive to this Cause and Covenant, for which this Nation has done and
suffered so much.

Having thus discharged our Consciences, we humbly leave all this to be well
weighed by your Lordships, and we pray the Lord himself to guide your
Lordships Counsels, that you may be like the wise men of Issachar, having
understanding of the times what Israel ought to do, and what they ought not to
do.

A. Ker.
