LONDON, Printed for James Knapton, at the Crown in St. Paul's Churchyard, 1696.

The Preface.
THe following Book was at first drawn up in a rude manner, only to please my
self, and divert the vacant hours of a Solitary Country Life. But it is now
published, purely in hopes of its doing some good in the World, among such,
whose Genius and Leisure lead them to Mechanical Studies, or those whose
business and livelihood it is.

Many there are, whose fault, or calamity it is, to have time lying upon their
hands; and for want of innocent, do betake themselves to hurtful pleasures.
This is the too common misfortune of Persons of Quality. Among some of the
courser sort of these, if this Book shall find some acceptance, it may be a
means to compose their loose Spirits; and by an innocent guile, initiate them
in other Studies, of greater use to themselves, their family, and country.
However it may hinder their commission of many sins, which are the effects of
idleness.

If there be any one person, in whom these good effects are produced, I shall
think my idle hours well bestowed, and bless God for it. However upon the
account of the innocence of my end in publishing this Book, and that it was
written only as the ha^^less (I may add also the virtuous) sport of leisure
hours; I think my self excusable to God and the World, for the expense of so
much time, in a subject different from my Profession.

But besides, I think my self under some little obligations of Justice and
Charity, to publish the ensuing papers for the sake of those, whose business
the Mechanic part is. I take it to be a Charity to the Trade; because there
are many (although excellent in the working part) who are utterly unskilled in the
artificial part of it. And then, it is a debt I pay: because I owe somewhat of
health, as well as diversion to the Study, and practice of these sort of
Mechanics. And the best requital I can make for my trespass, is to publish
what I have had better opportunities perhaps of Learning, than many Workmen
have.

And further yet, there is another reaand;son, which much prevailed with me to
publish this Book, viz. Because no body, that I know of, has prevented me, by
treating so plainly and intelligibly of this subject, as to be understood by a
vulgar Workman. I have often wondered at it, that so useful and delightful a
part of Mechanical Mathematics should lie in any obscurity, in an age wherein
such vast improvements have been made therein, and when many Books are daily
published upon every subject. I speak here of this Art remaining in obscurity;
not as if nothing was ever written of it, and I the in venture of Automatical
Computation.

But although I cannot assume the glory of being the first Writer upon this
subject, yet very few have as yet done it; of which I shall next give some
account.

Cardan, Kircher, and Scottus promised it; but I do not find they ever
published any thing to the purpose of it. Our great Mr. Oughtred I take to be
the first that ever wrote to any purpose about the Calculation of Automata: And
I believe he was the first that brought that Art under Rules, in his little
treatise called Automtaa. This Book was first surreptitiously published in
English in a little Book, called Horolog. Dialogues, in the year 1675; and
afterward far more completely in Latin, at the Theater in Oxon, among Mr.
Oughtred s Opusc. Mathem. in the year 1677. This last edition it was my
misfortune not to meet with, until it was too late, and therefore I have been
forced to quote the first, and worst in my Book.

What Mr. Oughtred had wrapped up in ^his Algebraick obscure Characters, was
afterward put into plainer Language* by that excellent Mathematician Sir Jon.
Moor, with some additions of his own; which you have in his Math. Compend. and
since him, by Mr. Leyborne, in his Pleasure with Profit.

I hope I shall not be judged to have transgressed the Rules of Modesty, in
coming af^r three such famous men; neither should I venture that censure, but
for two reasons. One is, I find by experience, that what they have written, is
understood by very few Workmen. And therefore I have endeavored, with all
industry, to make the matter as plain as I could for such. For which reason, I
hope the more learned Reader will excuse my using many words, when fewer would
have served his turn; and that I have condescended to low things, (and to him
needless) as teaching the Golden-rule, etc. The other reason is, that what
those three have written, relates only, or chiefly to the Watch-part. To which
I have added several other things of my own: particularly the Calculation of
the Clock-part, etc. I have been forced to reduce to Rules my self, and to name
no more, the Historical part has not been so much as attempted before, that I
know of.

These Reasons will, I hope, excuse me with the most censorious Reader, not
only for presuming to write after so accurate a*piece, as Mr. Oughtred s is,
but also the Novelty of the subject, will I hope procure for me a candid
interpretation of the faults and blunders, that I may have unwittingly
committed.

To the preceding account of what others have written (which shows what help I
have had from printed Books) I shall subjoyn my acknowledgments, and thanks to
the principal of my friends, who have given me their assistance in compiling
this Book. But their names I shall not make more public than mine own, being
unwilling to be discovered my self. In the Chap. of the Terms of Art, I owe
much to the assistance of L. Br.... a judicious Workman in White-chappel, who
drew me up a Scheme of the Clock-maker*s Language. In the History of the Modern
Inventions, I have had (among some others) the assistance chiefly of the
ingenious Dr. H.... and Mr. T....* The former being the Author of some, and
well acquainted with others, of the Mechanical Inventions of that fertile Reign
of King Charles the II. and the latter actually concerned in all, or most of
the late inventions in Clock-work, by means of his famed skill in that, and
other Mechanic operations.

There are some other contrivances of this last age (besides those I have
mentioned) which I have passed over in silence; because either they are only
branches, or improvements of the inventions I have taken notice of, (such as
several ways of repeating work, etc.) or else, they only collaterally relate to
Watch-work (as the inventions of Cutting-Engines, Fusy-Engines, etc.) To treat
of all these, would swell my Book far beyond its intended bounds; which I have
already somewhat exceeded. I shall therefore commit this task to some better
Pen, hoping that no person will take it amiss, that I have not mentioned what I
have been beholding to him for the relation of.

For the resons last mentioned, I have also left out of my Book, a Chapter of
the Art of making, and using many sorts of Sodders, the way of coloring
Metals, etc. useful in the practice of Clock-work. This I had prepared for the
sake of Mercurial Gentlemen, but omitted printing it, and some other things,
out of Charity to poor Apprentices and other Workmen, whose purses I am
unwilling my volume should too much exceed.

If I have at any time invaded the Workman's province, it was not because I
pretend to teach him his Trade; but either for Gentlemen's sakes, or when the
matter led me necessarily to it.

I have nothing more to add, but that I would have this little Treatise looked
upon only as an Essay, which I hope will prompt some abler pen to perform the
task better, especially in the Historical part. For since Watch-work owes so
much to our Age, and Country, it is pity that it should not be remembered:
especially when we cannot but lament the great defect of History, about the
beginning and improvements of this ingenious and useful Art.

The Artificial CLOCK-MAKER.
CHAP. I. Of the Terms of Art, or Names by which the parts of an Automaton are
called.
IT is necessary that I should show the meaning of those Terms which
Clock-makers use, that Gentlemen and others, unskilful in the Art, may know how
to express themselves properly, in speaking; and also understand what I shall
say in the following Book.

I shall not trouble the Reader with a recital of every name that does occur,
but only such as I shall have occasion to use in the following discourse, and
some few others that offer themselves, upon a transient view of a piece of work.

I begin with the more general Terms: as, the Frame; which is that which
contains the Wheels, and the rest of the work. The Pillars, and Plates, are
what it chiefly consists of.

Next for the Spring, and its appurtenances. That which the Spring lies in, is
the Spring-box; that which the Spring laps about, in the middle of the
Spring-box, is the Spring-Arbor; to which the Spring is hooked at one end. At
the top of the Spring-Arbor, is the Endless-Screw, and its Wheel.

That which the Spring draws, and about which the Chain or String is wrapped,
and which is commonly taper, is the Fusy. In larger work, going with weights,
where it is cylindrical, it is called the Barrel. The small Teeth at the bottom
of the Fusy, or Barrel, that stop it in winding up, is the Ratchet. That which
stops it when wound up, and is for that end driven up by the String, is the
Garde-caut, or Guard-Cock, as others; and Garde-du-Cord, and Gard-du-Gut, as
others call it.

The parts of a Wheel are, the Hoop, or Rim: the Teeth: the Cross: and the
Collet, or piece of Brass, soddered on the Arbor, or Spindle, on which the
Wheel is rivetted.

A Pinion is that little Wheel, which plays in the teeth of the Wheel. Its
teeth (which are commonly 4, 5, 6, 8, etc.) are called Leves, not Teeth.

The ends of the Spindle, are called Pevetts: the holes in which they run,
Pevet-holes.

The guttered Wheel, with Iron spikes at the bottom, in which the line of
ordinary House-Clocks does run, is called the Pully.

I need not speak of the Dial-plate, the Hand, Screws, Wedges, Stops, etc.

Thus much for general Names, which are common to all parts of a Movement.

The parts of a Movement, which I shall consider, are the Watch, and Clock.

The Watch-part of a Movement is that which serves to the measuring the hours.
In which the first thing I shall consider is the Balance: whose parts are, the
Rim, which is the circular part of it: the Verge, is its Spindle: to which
belong the two Pallets, or Nuts, which play in the fangs of the Crown*Wheel: in
Pocket-Watches, that strong Stud in which the lower Pevet of the Verge plays,
and in the middle of which one Pevet of the Crown-Wheel runs, is called the
Pottans: the wrought piece which covers the Balance, and in which the upper
Pevet of the Balance plays, is the Cock. The small Spring in the new
Pocket-Watches is the Regulator.

The parts of a Pendulum are, the Verge* Pallets and Cocks, as before. The Ball
in long Pendulums, the Bob in short ones, is the Weight at the bottom. The Rod,
or Wire is plain. The terms peculiar to the Royal Swing, are the Pads, which
are the Pallets in others, and are fixed on the Spindle. The Fork is also fixed
on the Spindle, and about 6 inches below, catches hold on the Rod, at a flat
piece of Brass, called the Flatt, in which the lower end of the Spring is
fastened.

The names of the Wheels next follow. The Crown-Wheel in Small pieces, and
Swing-Wheel in Royal Pendulums, is that Wheel which drives the* Balance, or
Pendulum.

The Contrate-Wheel, is that Wheel in Pocket-Watches, which is next to the
Crown-Wheel, whose Teeth and Hoop lie contrary to those of other Wheels.

The Great-Wheel, or First-Wheel, is that which the Fusy, etc. immediately
drives. Next it, are the Second-Wheel, Third-Wheel, etc.

Next follows the Work between the Frame and Dial-Plate. And first, is the
Pinion of Report; which is that Pinion which is commonly fixed on the Arbor of
the Great-Wheel, and in old Watches used to have commonly but four Leaves;
which drives the Dial-Wheel, and this carries about the Hand.

The last Part which I shall speak of, is the Clock, which is that part which
serves to strike the Hours: In which I shall

First speak of the Great* or First-Wheel; which is that which the Weight or
Spring first drives. In 16 or 30 hour Clocks, this is commonly the Pin-Wheel;
in 8 Day pieces* the Second-Wheel is commonly the* (...) This Wheel with Pins
is sometimes called the Striking-Wheel, or Pin-Wheel.

Next to this Striking-Wheel, follows the Detent-Wheel, or Hoop-Wheel, having
a Hoop almost round it, in which is a vacancy, at which the Cloc^ locks.

The next is the Third, or Fourth*Wheel (according as it is distant from the
First-Wheel) called also the Warning*Wheel.

And lastly is the Flying-Pinion, with a Fly or Fan to gather Air, and so
bridle the rapidity of the Clock's motion.

Besides these, there are the Pinion o^ Report, of which before; which drives
round the Locking-Wheel, called also the Count-Wheel, with 11 Notches in it
commonly, unequally distant from one another, to make the Clock strike the
hour^ of 1, 2, 3, etc.

Thus much for the Wheels of the Clock part.

Besides which there are the Rash, or Ratch; which is that sort of Wheel, of
twelve large Fangs, that runs concentrical to the Dial-Wheel, and serves to
lift up the Detents every hour, and make the Clock strike.

The Detents are those Stops, which by being lifted up, or let ^all down, do
lock and unlock the Clock in striking.

The Hammers s^rike the Bell: The Hammer-tails are what the Strikingpins draw
back the Hammers by.

Latches are what li^t up, and unlock the Work.

Catches are what hold by hooking, or catching hold of.

The Lifting-pieces do lift up, and unlock the Detents, in the Clock part.

CHAP. II. The Art of Calculation.
SECT. I. General preliminary Rules and Directions for Calculation.
1. FOR the more clear understanding this Chapter it must be observed, that
those Automata (whose Calculation I chiefly intend) do by little Interstices,
or Strokes, measure out longer portions of Time. Thus the strokes o^ the
Balance of a Watch, do measure ou^ Minutes, Hours, Days, etc.

Now to scatter those strokes among Wheels and Pinions, and to proportionat^
them, ^so as to measure Time regularly is the design of Calculation. For the
clearer discovery of which, it will be necessary to proceed leisurely, and
gradually.

Oughtred of Autom. sect. 4.
2. And in the first place, you are to know, that any Wheel being divided by
its Pinion, shows how many turns that Pinion has to one turn of that Wheel.
Thus a Wheel of 60 teeth driving a Pinion of 6, will turn round the Pinion 10
times in going round once.

From the Fusy to the Balance the Wheels drive the Pinions; and consequently
the Pinions run faster, or go more turns, than the Wheels they run in. But it
is contrary from the Great-Wheel to the Dial Wheel. Thus in the last Example,
The Wheel drives round the Pinion 10 times: but if the Pinion drove the Wheel,
it must turn 10 times to drive the Wheel round once.

3. Before I proceed further, I must show how to write down the Wheels and
Pinions. Which may be done, either as Vulgar Fractions, or in the way of
Division in Vulgar Arithmetic. E. C. A Wheel of 60 moving a Pinion of 5, may
be set down thus, 60/3: or rather thus, 5) 60: where the first figure is the
Pinion, the next without the hook, is the Wheel.

The number of Turns, which the Pinion has in one turn of the Wheel, is set
without a hook on the right hand: as 5) 60 (12, i. e. a Pinion 5 playing in a
Wheel of 60, moves round 12 times, in one turn of the Wheel.

4) 36 (9 5) 55 (11 5) 45 (9 5) 40 (8 17
A whole Movement man be noted thus, 4/^^ 55/5 45/5 40/5 17 Notches in the
Crown*Wheel. Or rather as you see here in the Margin: where the uppermost
number, above the line, is the Pinion of Report 4, the Dial-wheel 36, and 9
turns of the Pin. of Report. The second number (under the line) is 5 the
Pinion, 55 is the Great-wheel, and 11 turns of the Pinion it drives. The third
numbers, are the Second-wheel, etc. The fourth the Contrate-wheel, etc. An^ the
single number 17 under all, is the Crown-wheel.

4 By the 2. before, knowing the number of turns, which any Pinion has in one
turn of the Wheel it works in* you may also find out how many turns a^ Wheel
or Pinion has, at a greater distance; as the Contrate-wheel, Crown*wheel, or
etc. For it is but multiplying By the Quotients I commonly mean the ^umber of
Turns; which number is set on the right hand, without a hook, as is shown in
the last Paragraph. Which I no^e ^ere now once for all.
together the Quotients, and the number produced, is the number of Turns. An
Example will make what I say plain: 5) 5^ (11 5) 45 (9 5) 40 (8
let us choose these 3 numbers here set down; the first of which has 11 turns,
the next 9* and the last 8. If you multiply 11 and 9 it produces 99, for 9
times 11 is 99, that is, in one turn of the Whee^ 55, there are 99 turns of the
second Pinion 5, or of the Wheel 40. If you multiply 99 by the last Quotient 8
(that is, 8 times 99 is 792) it shows the number of turns, which the third and
last Pinion 5 has. So that this third, and last Pinion turns 792 times in one
turn of the first Wheel 55. 8) 80 (10 6) 54 (9 5) 40 (8 15
Another Example will make it still more plain The Example is in the Margin. The
turns are 10, 9 and 8. These multiplied as before run thus, viz. 10 times 9 is
90, that is, the Pinion 6 (which is the Pin. of the third Wheel 40) turns 90
times in one turn of the First*wheel 80. This last product 90 being multiplied
by 8, produces 720* that is, the Pinion 5 (which is the Pin. of the Crown-wheel
15) turns 720 times in one turn of the First-wheel, of 80 teeth.

5. We may now proceed to that, which is the very groundwork of all; which is,
not only to find out the turns, but the Beats also of the Balance in those
turns of the Wheels. By the last Paragraph, having found out the number of
turns, which the Crown-wheel has in one turn of the Wheel you seek for, you
must then multiply those turns of the Crown-wheel by its number of Notches, and
this will give you half the number of Beats, in that one turn of the Wheel.
Half the number, I say, for the reasons in the following 6. For the Explication
of what has been said, we will take the example in the last: the Crown-wheel
there, has 720 turns in one turn of the first Wheel (...) This number
multiplied by 15, the Notches in the Crown-wheel, produces 10800, which are
half the number o^ strokes of the Balance, in one turn of the first wheel 80.
The like may be done for any of the other Wheels; as the Wheel 54, or 40: but I
shall not insist upon these, having said enough.

I shall give but one Example more which will fully, and very plainly
illustrate the whole matter. 4) 32 (8 5) 55 (11 5) 45 (9 5) 40 (8 17


The example is in the margin, and it is of a 16 hour Watch, wherein the Pinion
of Report is 4, the Dial-wheel 32, the Great-wheel i^ 55, the Pinion of the
secon^-Wheel is 5, etc. the numbe^ of Notches in the Crown*wheel are 17: the
quotients or number of turns in each, are 8, 11 9, 8. All which being
multiplied as be*fore, make 6336: this number multiplied by 17, produces
107712; which la^summ is half the number of Beats in on^ turn of the
Dial-wheel. The half number of Beats in one turn of the Great-wheel, you will
find to be 13464: For 8 times 17 is 136, which is the half number of Beats in
one turn of the Contrate-wheel 40: and 9 times 136, is 1224, the half beats in
one turn of the Second-wheel: and 11 times 1224, is 13464, the half beats in
one turn of the Great-wheel 55. And 8 times this last, is 107712 before named.
If you multiply this by the two Pallets, that is, double it, it is 215424,
which is the number of Beats in one turn of the Dial-wheel, or 12 hours. If you
would know how many beats this Watch has in an hour, it is but dividing the
beats in 12 hours, into 12 parts, and it gives 17952, the Train of the Sir J.
Moor* Mat. Com. p. 109.
Watch, or beats in an hour. If you divide this into 60 parts, it gives 299 and
a little more, for the beats in a minute. And so you may go on to seconds and
thirds, if you please.

Thus I have delivered my thoughts as plainly as I can, that I may be well
understood; this being the very foundation of all the artificial part of
Clock-work. And therefore let the young practiser exercise himself thoroughly in
it, in more than one example.

If I have offended the more learned, quick-sighted Reader, by using m^^y
words; my desire to instruct the most ignorant Artist* must plead my excuse.

Ibid. p. 116.
6. The Balance or Swing has two strokes to every tooth of the Crown-wheel.
For each of the two Pallets has its blow against each tooth of the
Crown-wheel* Wherefore a Pendulum that swings Seconds, has its Crown-wheel but
30.

SECT. II. The way to Calculate, or contrive the Numbers of a piece of Watch
work.
HAving in the last Section led on the Reader to a general knowledge of
Calculation; I may now venture him further into the more obscure, and useful
parts of that Art: Which I shall explain with all possible plainness, tho less
brevity, than I could wish.

Oughtred Autom. Sect. 14.
1. The same motion may be performed either with one Wheel and one or by many
Wheels and many Pinions: provided that the number of turns of all those Wheels
bear the same proportion to all those Pinions, which that one Wheel bears to
its Pinion. Or (which is the same thing) that the number produced by
multiplying all the Wheels together, be to the number produced ^y multiplying
all the Pinions together; as that one Wheel is to that one Pinion. 28) 1440


Thus suppose you had use for a Wheel of 1440 teeth, with a Pin. of 28 leaves,
you may make it into 3 Wheels and Pinions, viz. 4 ^ 36, 7) 8, and 1) 5. For if
you multiply the three Wheels together, viz. 36, 8 and 5; and the three Pinions
together by themselves, viz 4, 7 and 1, you will find 1440 to arise for the
Wheels, and 28 for the Pinions. Or if you try the example by the number of
turns, it will be the same. For 28) 1440 (51 3/7. And the quotients and turns
of the 3 Wheels and Pinions multiplied together, are 51 3/7 also, as in the
last example.

It matters not in what order the Wheels and Pinions are set, or which Pinion
runs in which Wheel: Only for convenien^ sake, they commonly set the biggest
numbers to drive the rest.

2. Two Wheels and Pinions of diff^rent Ought. ib.
numbers may perform the same m^tion. As, a Wheel of 36 drives a Pinio^ of 4,
all one as a Wheel of 45 drives Pin. of 5; or as a Wheel of 90 drives Pin. of
10. The turns of each are 9.

3. If in breaking your Train into parcels (of which by and by) any of you^
Quotients should not please you; or Id. ib.
you would alter any other two number which are to be multiplied together, yo^
may vary them by this Rule: Divid^ your two numbers by any two oth^ numbers
which will measure them; the multiply the Quotients by the alternat^ divisors,
the product of these two la^ numbers found, shall be equal to the product of
the two numbers first give^ Thus if you would vary 36 times 8, d^vide these by
any two numbers that wi^ evenly measure them, as 36 by 4, and by 1. The fourth
part of 36 is 9, and divided by 1 gives 8. Multiply 9 by (...) the product is
9; and 8 multiplied by (...) produces 32. So that for 36 times 8^ you shall
have found 32 times 9. 9 8 36 X 8 4 1 32 X 9


The operation is in the Margin, that you may see, and apprehend it the better.
These numbers are equal, viz. 36 times 8 is equal to 32 times 9; both producing
288. If you divide 36 by 6, and 8 by 2, and multiply as before is said, you
will have for 36 times 8, 24 times 12, equal to 288 also.

If this Rule seem to the unskilful Reader hard to be understood, let him not
be discouraged, because he may do without it, although it may be of good use to
him that would be a more complete Artist.

4. Because in the following Paragraphs, I shall have frequent occasion to use
the Rule of Three, or Rule of Proportion, it will be necessary to show the
unskilful Reader, how to work this noble Rule.

If you find 3 or 4 numbers thus set, with four spots after the second of them,
it is the Rule of Proportion; as in this example, 2. 4:: 3. 6. i. e. As 2 is to
4:: So is 3 to 6.

The way to work this Rule, viz. by the 3 first number to find a fourth, is, To
multiply the second number and the third together, and divide their product by
the first. Thus 4 times 3 is 12, which 12 divided by 2, gives 6; which is the
number sought for, and stands in the fourth place.

You will find the great use of this Rule hereafter; only take care to bear it
in mind all along.

5. To proceed. If in seeking for your Pinion of Report, or by any other means,
you happen to have a Wheel and Pinion fall out with cross numbers, too big to
be cut in Wheels, and yet not to be altered by the former Rules, you may find
out two numbers of the same, or a near proportion, by this following Rule, viz.
As either of the two numbers given, is to Id. ib.
the other:: So is 360 to a fourth: Divide that fourth number, as also 360 by 4.
5. 6. 8. 9. 10. 12. 15. (each of which numbers does exactly measure 360) o^ by
any one of those numbers that brings a quotient nearest to an integer (or
whole number.) Thus if you had these two numbers, 147 the Wheel, and 170 the
Pinion, which are too great to be cut in small Wheels, and yet cannot be reduced
into le^s, because they have no other common measure, but unity: say therefore
according to the last paragraph, As 170 is to 147; or as 147 is to 170:: So is
360 to a fourth number sought. In numbers thus, 170 147:: 360. 311. or 147.
170:: 360. 416. Divide the fourth number and 360 by one of the foregoing
numbers; as 311 and 360 by 6, it gives 52 and 60. In numbers it is thus, 6) 311
(52 360 (60 Divide by 8 it is thus, 8) 311 (39 360 (45 If you divide 360 and 416
by 8, it will fall out exactly to be 45 and 52 8) 360 (45 416 (52 Wherefore for
the two numbers 147 and 170, you may take 52 and 60; or 39 and 45; or 45 and
52, o^ etc.

6. I shall add but one Rule more, before I come to the practice of what has
been laid down; which Rule will be of perpetual use, and consists of these five
particulars.

Oughtred Sect. 12. Sir J. Moor Ibid. p. 109.
1. To find what number of turns the Fusy will have, thus, As the Beats of the
Balance in one turn of the Great-Wheel or Fusy (suppose 26928) To the Beats of
the Balance in one hour (suppose 20196):: So is the continuance of the Watches
going in hours (suppose 16) To the number of the turns of the Fusy 12. In
numbers 'twill stand thus, 26928. 20196:* 16. 12. By 4. you may remember tha^
you are to multiply 20196 by 16, the product is 323136. Divide this by 26928,
and there will arise 12 in the Quotient, which must be placed in the fourth
place* and is the number of turns which the Fusy has.

2. By the Beats and turns of the Fusy* to find how many hours the Watch will
go, thus,

As the Beats of the Balance in one hour, are to the Beats in one turn of the
Fusy:: So is the number of the turns o^ the Fusy, to the continuance of the
Watches going. In num^ers thus,

2196. 26928:: 12* 16.

3. To find the strokes of the Balance in one turn of the Fusy, say, As the
number of turns of the Fusy, to the continuance of the Watch's going in hours::
S^ are the Beats in one hour, to the Beats o^ one turn of the Fusy. In numbers
it (...) thus,

12. 16:: 20196* 26928.

4. To find the Beats of the Balance in an hour, say thus, As the hours of the
Watch's going, To the number of turns of the Fusy:: So are the Beats in one
turn of the Fusy, To the Beats in an hour. In numbers thus,

16. 12:: 26928. 20196.

5. To find what Quotient is to be laid upon the Pinion of Report, say thus, As
the beats in one turn of the Great-wheel, To the beats in an hour:: So are the
hours of the Face of the Clock (viz. 12 or 24) To the Quotient of the
Hour-Wheel divided by the Pinion of Report, i. e. the number of turns, which
the Pinion of Report has in one turn of the Dial-Wheel. In numbers thus,

26928. 20196:: 12. 9.

Or rather (to avoid trouble) say thus, As the hours of the Watch's going, Are
to the numbers of the turns of the Fusy:: So are the hours of the Face, To the
Quotient of the Pinion of Report* In numbers thus, 16. 12:: 12. 9. If the hours
of the Face be 24, the Quotient will be 18; thus, 16. 12:: 24. 18.

7. Having given a full account of all things necessary to the understanding
the Art of Calculation, I shall now reduc^ what has been said into practice,
by showing how to proceed, in Calculating a piece of Watch-work.

The first thing you are to do, is to pitch upon your Train, or beats of the
Balance in an hour: as, whither a swi^^ Train, about 20000 beats (which is the
usual Train of a common 30 hour Pocket*Watch) or a slower Train of about 16000
(the Train of the new Pendulum Pocket*Watches;) or any other Train.

Having thus pitched upon your Train, you must next resolve upon the number of
turns you intend your Fusy shall have; and also upon the number of Hours, you
would have your Piece to go: As suppose 12 turns; and to go 30 hours, or 192
hours (which is 8 days) or etc.

These things being all soon determined; you next proceed to find out the beats
of the Balance, or Pendulum, in one turn of the Fusy, by the last 6. part 3.
viz. As the turns of the Fusy, To the hours of the Watch's going:: So is the
Train, To the number of beats in one turn of the Fusy. In numbers thus, 12.
16:: 20000. 26666. Which last number are the beats in one turn of the Fusy, or
Great-Wheel; and (by Sect. I. 5. of this Chap.) are equal to the Quotients of
all the Wheels unto the balance, multiplied together. This number therefore is
to be broken into a convenient parcel of Quotients: which you are to do after
this manner. First, half your number of beats, viz. 26666, for the reasons in
Sect. I. 6. of this Chap. the half whereof is 13333. Next you are to pitch upon
the number of your Crown-wheel, as suppose 17. Divide 13333 by 17, the Quotient
will be 784 (or to speak in the language of one that understands not
Arithmetic, divide 13333 into 17 parts, and 784 will be one of them.) This 784
is the number left for the Quotients (or turns) of the rest of the Wheels and
Pinions: which being too big for one or two Quotients, may be best broken into
three. Choose therefore 3 numbers, which when multiplied all together
continually will come nearest 784. As suppose you take 10, 9, and 9. Now 10
times 9 is 90; and 9 times 90 is 810, which is somewhat too much. You may
therefore try again other numbers* as suppose 11, 9, and 8. These multiplied as
the last, produce 792* which is as near as can be, and convenient Quotients.

Thus you have contrived your Piece* from the Great-Wheel to the Balance* But
the numbers not falling out exactly according as you at first proposed; you
must correct your work thus. First to find out the true number of beats, in one
turn of the Fusy, you must multiply 792* aforesaid, which is the true product
of al^ the Quotients, by 17, the notches of the Crown-wheel; the product of
this i^ 13464, which is half the number of true beats in one turn of the Fusy,
by Sect. ^ 5. of this Chap. Then to find the tru^ number of beats in an hour,
say by 6* part 4. of this Section, as the hours o^ the Watch's going, viz. 16,
to the 1^ turns of the Fusy:: So is 13464 the ha^^ beats in one turn of the
Fusy, to 1009^ the half beats in an hour: the numbe^ will stand thus 16. 12::
13464. 1009^

Then to know what Quotient is to b^ laid upon the Pinion of Report, say by
(...) 6. part 5. of this Sect: As the hours (...) the Watch's going, viz. 16,
to the tur^ of the Fusy, viz. 12:: So are the hou^^ of the Dial-plate, viz. 12,
To the Quotient of the Pinion of Report. In numbers thus, 16. 12:: 12. 9.

4) 36 (9 5) 55 (11 5) 45 (9 5) 40 (8 17


Having thus found out all your Quotients, it is easy to determine what numbers
your Wheels shall have: for choose what numbers your Pinions shall have, and
multiply the Pinions by their Quotients, and that produces the numbers for
your Wheels, as you see in the Margin. Thus 4 is the number of your Pinion of
Report, and 9 its quotient; therefore 4 times 9, which makes 36, is the number
for the Dial-wheel. So the next Pinion being 5, and its quotient 11, this
multiplied produces 55 for the Great-wheel. And the like of the rest of the
following numbers.

Thus, as plain as words can express it, I have showed how to Calculate the
numbers of a 16 hour Watch.

Oughtred Sect. 21.
8. This Watch may be made to go a longer time, by lessening the Train, and
altering the Pinion of Report. Suppose you could conveniently slacken the Train
to 16000, the half of which is 8000. 8.
Then say (by 6 part 2. of this Sect.) As the halfed Train, or Beats in an
hour, viz. 8000, To the halfed beats in one turn of the Fusy, viz. 13464:: So
are the turns of the Fusy, viz. 12, To the hours of the Watch's going: in
numbers thus, 8000. 13464:: 12. 20 So that this Watch will go 20 hours.

Then for the Pinion of Report, say, by the same part 5, As 20 the Continuance;
To 12 the turns of the Fusy:: So are 12 the hours of the Face, To 7 the
quotient of the Pinion of Report. In numbers thus, 20. 12:: 12. 7.

4) 28 (7 5) 55 (11 5) 45 (9 5) 40 (8 17


The work is the same as before, as to the numbers; only the Dial-wheel is but
28, because its quotient is altered to 7; as appears in the Margin, by the
Scheme of the work.

9. I shall give the Reader one example more, for the sake of showing him the
use of some of the foregoing Rules, not yet taken notice of in the former
operations. Suppose you Id. ib. 22.
would give numbers to a Watch of about 10000 beats in an hour, to have 12 turns
of the Fusy, to go 170 hours, and 17 notches in the Crown-wheel.

This work is the same as in the last Example 7. In short therefore thus, As
the turns 12: are To the Continuance 170:: So is the Train 10000, To 141666,
which are the beats in one turn of the Fusy. The numbers will stand thus, 12.
170:: 10000 14^666. Half this last is 70^33. Divide this half into 17 parts,
and 4167 will be for the quotients. And because this number is too big for 3
quotients, therefore choose 4: as suppose 10, 8, 8, and 6 (i. e. 6 and 3 fifths)
These multiplied together as before, and with 17, makes 71808, which are half
the true beats in one turn of the Fusy. By this you are to find out your true
Train first* saying as in the former example, As 170 to 12:: So 71808, to 5069;
which last is the half of the true Train of your Watch. Then for the Pinion of
Report, say, as 170, to 12:: So 12, to 1/^4/74/^. Which Fraction ari^eth thus:
If you multiply 12 by 12 it makes 144; and divide 144 by 170, you cannot; but
setting the 144 (the dividend) over 170 (the Divisor) and there ari^eth this
fraction ^/24/^4/^, which is a Wheel and Pinion; the lower is the Pinion of
Report, and the upper is the Dial-wheel, according to Sect. I. 3. of this
Chapter. Or (which perhaps will be more plain to the unlearned Reader) you may
leave those two numbers, in their Divisional posture thus, 170) 144, which does
express the Pinion and Wheel, in the way I have hitherto made use of. But to
proceed. These numbers being too big to be cut in small 24) 20 20/24 6) 60 (10
6) 48 (8 5) 40 (8 5) 33 (6 17


Wheels, may be varied, as you see a like Example is 5. of this Section: viz.
Say, as 144* is To 170:: So is 360, To 425. Or, as 170, to 144:: So is 360, To
305. In number thus, 144. 170:: 360. 425. Or 170. 144:: 360. 305. Divide 360,
and either of these two fourth and last numbers by 4, 5, 6, 8, etc. (as is
directed in the Rule last cited.) If you divide by 8, you will have for your
numbers 1/14/74/^ 4/^5/^ or 3/48/5. If you divide by 15 (which will not bring
it so near an integer) you will have 2/24/8 or 2/^0/4: which last are the
numbers set down in the Margin* where the numbers of the whole Movement are set
down.

10. Having said enough, I think, concerning the Calculation of ordinary
Watches, to show the hour of the day: I shall next proceed to such as show
minutes and seconds. The process whereof is thus: First, having resolved upon
your beats in an hour, you are next to find how many beats there will be in a
minute, by dividing your designed Train into 60 parts. And accordingly you are
to find out such proper numbers for your Crown-wheel, and quotients, as that
the Minute-wheel shall go round once in an hour, and the Second-wheel once in a
minute.

An Example will make all plain. Let us choose a Pendulum of 6 inches to go 8
days, with 16 turns of the Fusy. By Horol. Disq.
Mr Smith's Tables, a Pendulum of 6 inches vibrates 9368 in an hour. This
divided by 60 gives 156 beats for a minute. Half these sums are 4684 and Sect.
1. 6.
78. Now the first work is to break this 78 into good proportions; which will
fall into one quotient, and the Crown-wheel. First, for the Crown-wheel; let it
have 15 notches. Divide 78 afore^ by this 15, the quotient will be 5. A^ so
this first work is done: for a Crow^ wheel of 15, and a Wheel a^ Pinion, whose
quotient is 5 (^ in the Margin) 8) 40 (5 15


will go rou^ in a minute, to carry a Ha^ to show Seconds.

Next for a Hand to go round in ^ hour, to show Minutes. Now becau^ there are
60 minutes in an hour, it is b^ breaking 60 into two goo^ 8) 64 (8 8) 60 (7 8)
40 (5 15


quotients (which may be ^ and 6, or 8 and 7, or etc. and the work is done.

Thus your number 4684, broken, as near as can be, into proper numbers.

But because it does not fall out exact into the abovementioned numbers, yo^
must Correct (as you were directed before) and find out the true number ^ beats
in an hour, by multiplying 15 by 5, which makes 75; and this by 6^ makes 4500,
which is the half of the tru^ Train. Then to find out the beats in on 6. Par.
3. and 7.
turn of thy Fusy, operate as before, vi^ As the number of turns, 16, To the
co^tinuan^ 192:: So is 4500 to 54000, which are half the beats in one turn of
^he Fusy. In numbers thus, 16. 192:: 4500. 54000. This 54000 must be di^ided by
4500, which are the true ^umbers already pi^ched upon, or beats* ^n an hour.
The quotient of this division ^s 12, which being not too big for one single
quotient, needs not be divided into more. The work will stand, as you see in
the Margin. ^) 108 (12 ^) 64 (8 ^) 60 (7 ^) 40 (5 15




As to the Hour-hand, the Great-Wheel, which performs only one revolution in 12
turns of the Minute-wheel, will show the hour. Or rather you may order it to be
done by the Minute-wheel, ^s shall be showed hereafter.

11. I shall add but one Example more, and so conclude this Section; and that
is, To calculate the numbers of a ^iece whose Pendulum swings* Seconds, ^o show
the hour, minutes, and seconds, and to go 8 days; which is the usual
per^ormance of those Movements called Sir J. Moo^ Ibid. p. 116.
^oyal Pendulums at this day. First, cast ^p the number of seconds in 12 hours
(which are the beats in one turn of (...) Great-wheel) These are 12 times (...)
minutes, and 60 times that, gives 432^ which are the seconds in 12 hours. H^ V.
Sect. 1. * 6.
this number (for the reasons before) 21600. The Swing-wheel must ne^ be 30, to
swing 60 seconds in one of (...) revolutions. Divide 21600 by it, a^ 720 is the
quotient, or number left to (...) broken into quotients. Of these quo^ents, the
first must needs be 12 for (...) Great-wheel, which moves round on^ in 12
hours. Divide 720 by 12, (...) quotient is 60; which may be conve^*ently broken
into two quotients, as (...) and 6, or 5 and 12, or 8 and 7, whi^ last is most
convenient. A^ if you take all the Pinions the work will stand as in (...)
Margin. 8) 96 (12 8) 64 (8 8) 60 (7 30




According to this compu^*tion, the Great-wheel will (...) about once in 12
hours, show the hour, if you please: the Seco^ wheel once in an hour, to show
the (...) nutes; and the Swing-wheel once in a (...) nute, to show the seconds.

Thus I have endeavored with all possible plainness, to unravel this most
mysterious, as well as useful part of Watchwork. In which, if I have offended
the more learned Reader, by unartificial terms, or multitude of words, I desire
the fault may be laid upon my earnest intent to condescend to the meanest
capacity.

SECT. III. To Calculate the Striking part of a Clock.
1. Although this part consists of many Wheels and Pinions, yet respect needs to
be had only to the Count-wheel, Striking-wheel, and Detent-wheel: which move
round in this proportion; The Count-wheel moves round commonly ^nce in 12, or
24 hours. The Detent-wheel moves round every stroke the Clock strikes,
sometimes but once in two strokes. From whence it follows,

1. That as many Pins as are in the Pin-wheel, so many turns has the
Detent-wheel, in one turn of the Pin-wheel. Or (which is the same) the Pins of
the Pin-wheel are the Quotient of that Wheel, divided by the Pinion of the
Deten^-wheel. But if the Detent-wheel moves but once round in two strokes o^
the Clock, then the said Quotient is bu^ half the number of Pins.

2. As many turns of the Pin-wheel a^ are required to perform the strokes of 1^
hours (which are 78) So many tur^^ must the Pinion of Report have, to turn
round the Count-wheel once. Or thus* Divide 78 by the number of Striking pins,
and the Quotient thereof shall b^ the Quotient of the Pinion of Report. Al^
this is, in case the Pinion of Report b^ fixed to the arbor of the Pin-wheel,
as i^ very commonly done.

All this I take to be very plain: or (...) it be not, the example in the
Margin will clear all difficulties. 8) 48 (6 6) 78 (13 pins 6) 60 (10 6) 48 (8


Her^ the Locking-wheel is 48^ the Pinion of Report is 8^ the Pin-wheel is 78,
the Striking-pins are 13. An^ so of the rest. I need onl^ to remark hero, that
7^ being divided by the 13 pins, gives 6^ which is the Quotient of^* the
Pinion^ of Report: as was before hinted.

As for the Warning-wheel, and Flying-Pinion, it matters little what numbers
they have, their use being only to bridle the rapidity of the motion of the
other Wheels.

Besides the last observation, there are other ways to find out the Pinion of
Report, which will fall under the next.

2. These following Rules will be of great use in this part of Calculation, viz.

Rule 1. As the number of turns of the Great-wheel, or Fusy;

.To the days of the Clock's continuauc^:

::So is the number of strokes in 24 hours, viz. 156*

.To the strokes in one turn of the Fusy, or Great-wheel.

Rule 2. As the number of strokes in 24 hours, which are 156,

.To the strokes in one turn of the Fusy, or Great-wheel,

::So are the turns of the Fusy, or Great-wheel,

.To the days of the Clock's continuance, or going.

Rule 3. As the strokes in one turn of the Fu^y,

.To the strokes of 24 hours, viz. 156.

::So is the Clock's continuance,

.To the number of turns of the Fusy, or Great-wheel.

These two last Rules are of no great use (as the first is) but may serve to
correct your work, if need be, when in breaking your Strokes into Quotients (of
which presently) you cannot come near the true number, but a good many strokes
are left remaining. In this case, by Rule 2. you may find whether the
continuance of your Clock be to your mind* And by Rule 3, you may enlarge or
diminish the number of turns for this purpose. The praxis hereof will follow by
and by.

The 2 following Rules are to find fit numbers for the Pinion of Report, and
the Locking-wheel, besides what is said before 1. Inference 2.

Rule 4. As the number of Strokes in the Clock's continuance, or in all it^
turns of the Fusy,

.To the turns of the Fusy,

::So are the Strokes in 12 hours, which are 78,

.To the Quotient of the Pinion of Report, fixed upon the arbor of the
Great-wheel.

But if you would fix it to any other Wheel, you may do it thus, as is before
1. Infer 2^
hinted, viz.

Rule 5. First, find out the number of Strokes, in one turn of the Wheel you
intend to fix your Pinion of Report upon (which I shall show you how to do in
the following.) Divide 78 by this number, and the number arising in the
Quotient, is the Quotient of the Pinion of Report.

Or thus. Take the number of Strokes in^ ^e turn of the Wheel, for the number
of the Pinion of Report, and 78 for the Count (or Locking) wheel, and vary them
to lesser numbers, by Sect. 2. 5. of this Chapter.

Rule 6. The foregoing Rules are of greatest use, in Clocks of a larger
continuance; although, where they can be applied, they will indifferently serve
all. But this Rule (which will serve larger Clocks too) I add chiefly for the
use of lesser Pieces, whose continuance is accounted by hours.

The Rule is to find the Strokes in the Clock's continuance, viz. As 12, is to
78:: So are the hours of the Clocks continuance, To the number of Strokes in
that time.

This Rule (I said) may be made use of for the largest Clock; but then you must
be at the trouble of reducing the Days into Hours Whereas the shortest way is
to Multiply the strokes in one turn of the Great-wheel, by the number of Turns.
Thus in an 8 day piece the Strokes in one turn are 78. These multiplied by 16,
the turns, produce 1248; which are the Strokes in the Clock's continuance. If
you work by the foregoing Ruled the hours of 8 days are 192. Then say, 12* 78::
192. 1248.

3. In this Paragraph, I shall show the use of the preceding Rules, and by
examples make all plain that might seem obscure in them.

I begin with small Pieces: of which but briefly. And first, having pitched
upon the number of turns, and the continuance, you must find, by the last Rule,
how many Strokes are in its continuance. Then divide these Strokes by the
number of turns, and you have the number of Striking-pins. Or divide by the
number of Pins, and you have the number of Turns.

Thus a Clock of 30 hours, with 15 turns of the Great-wheel, has 195 strokes.
For by the last Rule, 12. 78:: 30. 195. Divide 195 by 15, it gives 13 for the
Striking-pins. Or if you choose 13 for your number of Pins, and divide 195 by
it, it gives 15, for the number of ^urns, as you see in the Margin. 15) 195 (13
13) 195 (15




As for the Pinion of Report, and the rest of the Wheels, enough is said in the
1.

But suppose you would calculate the numbers of a Clock of much longer
continuance, which will necessitate you to make your Pin-wheel further distant
from the Great-wheel, you are to proceed thus: Having re^olved upon your turns,
you must find out the number of strokes in one turn of the Great-wheel, or
Fusy, by 2* Rule 1. Thus in an 8 day piece, of 16 turns, 16. 8:: 156. 78. So in
a piece of 32 days, and 16 turns, 16* 32:: 156. 312. These strokes so found
out, are the number which is to be broken into a convenient parcel of
Quotients, thus;

First resolve upon your number of Striking-pins: divide the last named number
by it: The quotient arising hence, is to be one, or more quotients, for the
Wheels and Pinions. As in the last examples* Divide 78 by 8 (the usual pins in
an 8 day piece) and the quotient is 9^; which is a quotient little enough. So
in the Month-piece: if you take your Pins 8* divide 312 by it, the quotient is
39. Which being too big for one, must b^ broken into two quotients, 10) 65 (6^
8) 48 (6 6) 48 (8 pins


for Wheels and Pinions, or as near (...) can be: which may b^ 7 and 5, or 6
and 6. The latter is exactly 39, and may there^o^ stand: as you see is done in
the Margin.

The quotients being thus determined and accordingly the Wheels and Pinio^^ as
you see; the next work is to find (...) quotient for the Pinion of Report, to
^^ry round the Count (or Locking) wh^^ once in 12 hours, or as you please. ^
you fix your Pinion of Report on the Great-wheel arbor, you must operate (...)
the Rule 4. of the last paragraph. As (...) the last example in the
Month-piece: (...) Rule 6. before, the strokes in the conti^^ance are 4992.
Then by Rule 4 say, 4992. 16:: 78. 499^/124^ or thus, 4992) 1248. The first of
which two numbers is the Pinion, the next is the Wheel. Which being too large,
may be varied to ^^/9 or V. Sect. 1*. 3.
36) 9; or to ^4/6 or 24) 6, by Sect. 2 5. before.

These numbers being not the usual numbers of a Month-piece, but only made use
of by me, as better illustrating the foregoing Rules* I shall therefore, for
the fuller explication of what has been said, briefly touch upon the
calculation of the more usual numbers. They commonly increase the number of
Striking-pins, and so make the Second-wheel the Striking-wheel* Suppose you
take 24 Pins; Divide 312 by it, and the Quotient is 13. Which is little enough
8) 104 (13 6) 72 (12. 24 pins


for one Quotient; and may therefore stand as you see is done in the Margin:
where the Quotient of the first Wheel is 13. In the second Wheel of 72 teeth,
are the 24 pins, although its quotient is but 12, because the Hoop-wheel is
double, and goes round but once in two strokes of the Pin-wheel.

The Pinion of Report here, is the same with the last, if fixed upon the arbor
of the Great*wheel. But if you fix it on the arbor of the Second, or Pin-wheel,
its quotient then is found by 1. Infer. 2. or by 2. Rule 5. viz. Divide 78 by
24, and the number arising in the quotient, is the quotient of the Pinion of
12) 39 (3


Report, which is 3. The Pinion of Report then being 12, the Count-wheel will
be 39, as in the Margin.

To perfect the Reader in this part of Calculation, I will finish this Section
with the calculation of a Year-piece of Clockwork. The Process whereof is the
same with the last, and therefore I may be more brief with this, except where I
have not touched upon the foregoing Rules.

We will choose a piece to go 395 days with 16 turns, and 26 Striking-pins. By
2. Rule 1. there are 3851 strokes in one turn of the Great-wheel. For 16. 395::
156. 3851. This last number divided by the 26 Pins, leaves 148 in the quotient,
to be broken into two or more quotients, for Wheels and Pinions. These
quotients may be 12 and 12; which multiplied, makes 144, which is 10) 120 (12
8) 96 (12 78 (26 pins


as near as can well be, to 148. The work thus far contrived, will stand as you
see in the Margin.

Before you go any further, you may correct your work, and see how near your
numbers come to what you proposed at first, because they did not fall out
exact. And first, for the true continuance of your Clock* If you multiply 12,
12, and 26 (i. e. the Quotients un*o the Stri^ing-pins, and those Pins) you
have the true number of Strokes, in one turn of the Great-wheel: Which, in this
example, make 3744. For 12 times 12, is 144; and 26 times that, is 3744. (This
Direction I would have noted, and remembered, as a Rule useful at any time to
discover the nature of any piece of Clock-work.) Having thus the true number of
Strokes desired, by 2. Rule 2. you may find the true Continuance to be only 384
days. For 156. 3744:: 16. 384. If this Continuance does not please you, you may
come nearer to your first proposed number, of 395 days, by a small increase of
the number o^ Turns; according to 2. Rule 3. viz. by making your turns almost
16. For 3744. 156:: 395. 16 almost.

Lastiy, For the Pinion of Report, if you fix it upon the Great-wheel, it will
require an excessive number: if you fix it upon the Pin-wheel (which is usual)
then by 2. Rule 5, the quotient 13) 39 (3


is 3; and the Pinion of Report being 13, the Count-wheel will be 39; as you
see in the Margin.

But for the better exercising the Reader, let us fix it upon the Spindle of
the Second-wheel 96. Its quotient is 12; which multiplied by 26 (the pins)
produces 312; which are the Strokes in one turn of that Second-wheel. Then by
2* Rule 5, Divide 78 by 312, i. e. Set them as a Wheel and Pinion thus, 312)
78, and vary them to lesser numbers (by Sect. ^ 5.) viz. 36* 9, or to 24) 6, or
the like.

I think it needless to say any thing o^ Pocket-clocks, whose calculation is
the very same, with what goes before.

That the unlearned Reader may not think any thing going before difficult, I
need only to advise him, to look over the working of the Rule of Proportion, in
Sect. 2. 4. For I think all will be plain, if that be well understood.

SECT. 4. Of Quarters and Chimes.
THe Reader will expect that I should say somewhat concerning Quarters and
Chimes: but because there is little, but what is purely mechanical in it, I
shall say the less, and leave the Reader to his own invention.

1. The Quarters are generally a distinct part from the Clock-part, which
strikes the Hour.

The Striking-wheel may be the First, Second, or etc. Wheel, according to your
Clock's continuance. Unto which Wheel you may fix the Pinion of Report.

The Locking-wheel must be divided (as other Locking-wheels) into 4, 8, or more
unequal parts, ^o as to strike the Quarter, and lock at the first Notch; the
half-hour, and lock at the second Notch, etc. And in doing this, you may make
it to chime the Quarters, or strike them upon two Bells, or more.

It Is usual for the Pin-wheel* or the Locking-wheel, to unlock the Hour-part in
these Clocks; which is easily done by some jogg or Latch, at the end of the
last Quarter, to lift up the Detents of the Hour-part.

If you would have your Clock strike the Hour, at the Half-hour, as well as
whole Hour, you must make the Locking-wheel of the Hour-part double: i. e. it
must have two Notches of a sort, to strike 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. twice apiece.

2. As for Chimes, I need say nothing of the Lifting-pieces and Detents, to
lock and unlock; nor of the Wheels to bridle the motion of the Barrel. Only you
are to observe, that the Barrel must be as long in turning round, as you are in
Singing the Tune it is to play. As for the Chime-Barrel, it may be made up of
certain Bars, that run athwart it, with a convenient number of holes punched
in them, to put in the Pins, that are to draw each Hammer. By this means, you
may change the Tune, without changing the Barrel. This is the way of the Royal
Exchange Clock in London, and of others. In this case, the Pins or Nuts, which
draw the Hammers, must hang down from the Bar, some more, some less, and some
stand upright in the Bar: the reason whereof is, to play the Time of the Tune
rightly. For the distance of each of these Bars, may be a Semi-brief, or etc.
of which hereafter.

But the most usual way is, to have the Pins that draw the Hammers, fixed on
the Barrel. For the placing of which Pins, you may make use of the Musical
Notes, or proceed by the way of Changes on Bells, viz. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. The
first being far the better way, I shall speak of that chiefly, especially
because the latter will fall in to be explained with it.

And first, you are to observe what is the Compass of your Tune, or how many
Notes or Bells there are from the highest to the lowest: and accordingly you
must divide your Barrel from end to end. Thus in the examples following, each
of those Tunes are 8 notes in compass; and accordingly the Barrel is divided
into 8 parts. These Divisions are struck round the Barrel, opposite to which
are the Hammer-tails.

I speak here, as if there was only one Hammer to each Bell, that the Reader
may more clearly apprehend what I am explaining. But when two Notes of the same
sound come together in a Tune, there must be two Hammers to that Bell, to
strike it. So that if in all the Tunes you intend to Chime, of 8 notes compass,
there should happen to be such double Notes on every Bell, instead of 8, you
must have 16 Hammers: and accordingly you must divide your Barrel, and strike
16 strokes round it opposite to each Hammer-tail. Thus much for dividing your
Barrel from end to end.

In the next place, you are to divide i^ (round about) into as many divisions,
as there are Musical Bars, Semibriefs, Minums, etc. in your Tune. Thus the
100th Psalm-tune has 20 Semibriefs; the Song-tune following, has 24 Bars of
triple time: and accordingly their Barrels are divided. Each division therefore
of the 100th Psalm Barrel is a Semibrief, and of the Song-tune it is three
crotchets* And therefore the intermediate Spaces serve for the shorter notes:
as, one third of a division, is a Crotchet, in the Song-tune. One half a
division, is a Minum; and one quarter a Crotchet, in the Psalm-tune. Thus the
first note in the 100th Psalm, is a Semibrief, and accordingly on the Barrel,
it is a whole division from 5 to 5. The second is a Minum, and therefore 6 is
but half a division from 5; and so of the rest. And so also for the Song-tune,
which is shorter time: The two first notes being Quavers, are distant from one
another, and from the third pin, but half a third part of one of the divisions.
But the two next pins (of the bell 3, 3) being Crotchets, are distant so many
third parts of a division. And the next pin (of the bell 1) being a Minum, is
distant from the following pin (4) two thirds of a division.

From what has been said, you may conceive the surface of a Chime-barrel, to
be represented in the Tables following, as stretched out at length: or (to
speak plainer) that if you wrap either of these Tables round a Barrel, the
Dotts in the Table, will show the places of the A Table of Chimes to the 100
Psalm.
^ The Musical Notes of Psalm 100.
^ The Musical Notes of, Such Command over my Fate, etc A Song
^ The Chimes of the Song, Such Command over my Fate, etc.
^ To be inserted between page ^^ and ^^

Pins, to be set on the Barrel.

You may observe in the Tables, that from the end of each Table to the
beginning, is the distance of two, or near two divisions: which is for a Pause,
between the end of the Tune, and its beginning to Chime again.

I need not say, that the Dotts running about the Tables, are the places of the
Pins that play the Tune.

If you would have your Chimes complete indeed, you ought to have a set of
Bells, to the Gamut notes; so as that each Bell having the true sound of Sol,
La, Mi, Fa, you may play any Tune, with its Flats and Sharps. Nay, you may by
these means, play both the Bass and Treble, with one Barrel.

If any thing going before appears gibberish, I cannot help it, unless I should
here teach the skill of Music too.

As to setting a Tune upon the Chimebarrel from the number of Bells, viz. 1, 2,
3, 4, I shall here give you a specimen thereof.

Such Command over my Fate, in numbers.

775, 3, 3, 1. 4, 5, 6, 4. 4, 2.

Note, In these numbers, a Comma [,] signifies the note before it, to be a
Crotchet. A pricked Comma, or Semi-colon [;] denotes a pricked Crotchet. And a
Period [.] is a Minum. Where no punctation is, those Notes are Quavers.

I shall only add further, that by setting the Names of your Bells at the head
of any Tune (as is done in the Tables before) you may easily transfer that
Tune, to your Chime-barrel, without any great skill in Music. But observe,
that each line in the Music, is three notes distant; i. e. there is a Note
between each line, as well as upon it: as is manifest by inspecting the Tables.

SECT. 5. To Calculate any of the Celestial Motions.
The Motions I here chiefly intend, are the Day of the Month, the Moons age,
the Day of the Year, the Tides, and (if you please) the slow motion of the Suns
Apogaeum, of the Fixed Stars, the motion of the Planets, etc.

1. For the effecting these Motions, you may make them to depend upon the Work
already in the Movement; or else measure them by the beats of a Balance, or
Pendulum.

If the latter way, you must however contrive a Piece (as before in Watch-work)
to go a certain time, with a certain number of turns.

But then to Specificate, or determine the Motion intended, you must proceed
one of these two ways: either,

1. Find how many beats are in the Revolution. Divide these beats by the beats
in one turn of the Wheel, or Pinion, which you intend shall drive the intended
Revolution; and the Quotient shall be the number to perform the same. Which, if
too big for one, may be broken into more Quotients. Thus, if you would
represent the Synodical Revolution of the Moon, which is 29 days, 12 hours)
with a Pendulum that swings Seconds, the Movement to go 8 days, with 16 turns
of the Fusy, and the Great-wheel to drive the Revolution. Divide 2551500 (the
Beats in 29 days 12 hours) by 43200 (the Beats in one turn of the Great-wheel)
and you will have 59 in the Quotient: which being too big for one, may be put
into two Quotients. Or

2. You may proceed as is directed before, Chapter 2. Sect. 2. 7.
in the Section of Calculating Watchwork, viz. Choose your Train, turns of the
Fusy, Continuance, etc. And then instead of finding a Quotient for the Pinion
of Report, find a number (which is all one as a Pin. of Report) to Specificate
your Revolution, by this following Rule.

Rule. As the Beats in one turn of the Great-wheel. To the Train:: So are the
Hours of the Revolution, To the Quotient of the Revolution.

Thus to perform the Revolution of Saturn (which is 29 years, 183 days) with a
16 hour Watch, of 26928 Beats in one turn of the Fusy, and 20196, the Train:
the quotient of the Revolution, will be 193824. For, As 26928, To 20196:: So
258432 (the Hours in 29 y. and 183 d.) To 193824. Note here, That the
Great-wheel Pinion is to drive the Revolution work.

But if you would have the Revolution to be driven by the Dial-wheel, and the
Work already in the Movement (which in great Revolutions, is for the most part,
as nice as the last way, and in which I intend to treat of the particular
Motions) in this case, I say, you must first know the Days of the Revolution.
And because the Dial-wheel goes round twice in a day, therefore double the
number of the days in the Revolution, and you have the number of turns of the
Dial-wheel in that time. This number of turns is what you are to break into a
convenient number of quotients, for the Wheels and Pinions* as shall be showed
in the following examples.

2. A Motion to show the Day of the Month.

Oughtred. 26.
The days in the largest Month are 31. These doubled are 62, which are the
turns of the Dial-wheel, which may be broken into these two quotients 15 and 4;
which multiplied together make 62. Therefore choosing your Wheels and Pinions,
as has been directed in the former Sections, your work is done. The Wheels 4)
62 (15 5) 20 (4


and Pinions may be, as you see done in* the Margin. Or if a larger Pinion than
one of 5 be necessary, by reason it is concentrick to a Wheel, you 4) 62 (15 10
(40 (4


may take 10 for the Pinion, and 40 for the Wheel, as in the Margin.

The work will lie thus in the Movement, viz. Fix your Pinion 10, concentrical
to the Dial-wheel (or to turn round with it upon the same Spindle.) This Pinion
10 drives the Wheel 40: which Wheel has the Pinion 4 in its center, which
carries about a Ring of 62 teeth, divided on the upper side into 31 days.

Or, you may, without the trouble of many Wheels, effect this motion; vi^. By a
Ring divided into 30 or 31 days, and as many Fangs or Teeth, like a Crown*
wheel teeth, which are caught and pushed forward once in 24 hours, by a pin in
a Wheel, that goes round in that time. This is the usual way in the Royal
Pendulums, and many other Clocks; and therefore being common, I shall say no
more of it.

3. A Motion to show the age of the Id. ib.
Moon.

The Moon finisheth her course* so as to overtake the Sun, in 29 days, and a
little above an half. This 29 days (not regarding the small excess) makes 59
twelve hours, or turns of the Dial-wheel, which is to be broken into convenient
quotients: which 10) 5, 9 (^9 4) 40 (10

4) 59 (14 10) 40 (4


may be 5, 9 and 10 as in the first example; or 14 and 4, as in the second
example in the Margin. So that if you fix a Pinion of 10 concentrical with your
Dial-wheel, to drive a Wheel of 40 (according to the last example) which Wheel
40 drives a Pinion 4, which carries about a Ring, or Wheel of 59 teeth, divided
on the upper side into 29 'twill show the Moons age.

Id. ib.
4. A Motion to show the day of the Year, the Sun's place in the Ecliptic,
Sun's Rising or Setting, or any other annual motion of 365 days.

The double of 365 is 730, the turns of the Dial-wheel in an year: which may be
broken into 4) 73 (18 4) 40 (10 5) 20 (4

4) 73 (18 4) 32 (8 4) 20 (5


these quotients, viz. 18, and 10, and 4, according to the first example; or
18, 8, and 5, according to the second. So that a Pinion of 5 is to lead a Wheel
of 20; which again by a Pinion of 4, leads a Wheel of 40; which thirdly, by a
Pinion of 4, carries about a Wheel, or Ring of 73, divided into the 12 months,
and their days; or into the 12 signs, and their degrees; or into the Sun's
Rising and Setting, etc. For the setting on of which last, you have a Table in
Mr. Oughtred's Opuscula.

Autom. 35. Id. ib.
5. To show the Tides at any Port.

This is done without any other trouble, than the Moon's Ring (before mentioned
3.) to move round a fixed circle, divided into twice 12 hours, and numbered the
contrary way to the age of the Moon.

To set this to go right, you must find out at what Point of the Compass the
Moon makes full Sea, at the place you would have your Watch serve to. Convert
that point into hours, allowing for every point North or S. lost 45 of an hour.
Thus at London Bridge it is vulgarly thought to be high Tide, the Moon at N. E.
and S. W, which are 4 Points from the N. and S. Or you may do thus: by
Tide-tables learn how many hours from the Moon's Southing, it is Highwater. Or
thus; find at what hour it is Highwater, at the Full or Change of the M^on: as
at London Bridge, the full Tide is commonly reckoned to be 3 hours from the
Moon's Southing; or at 3 of clock at the Full and Change. The day of
Conjunction, or New Mood, with a little stud to point, being set to the hour so
found, will afterward point to the hour of full Tide.

This is the usual way; but it being always in motion, as the Tides are not, a
better way may be found out, viz. By causing a Wheel, or Ring to be moved
forward, only twice a day, and to keep time (as near as can be) with Mr.
Flamsteed's most correct Tables. But this I shall commit to the Readers
contrivance, it being easy, and more of curiosity than use.

6. To Calculate Numbers, to show the Motion of the Planets, the Slow Motion of
the Fixed Stars, and of the Sun's Apogeum, etc.

Having said enough before that may be applied here, and they being only
curiosities, seldom put in practice, I shall not therefore trouble the Reader,
or swell my Book with so many words, as would be required to treat of these
Motions distinctly, and completely.

Only thus much in general. Knowing the years of any of these Revolutions, you
may break this number into quotients; if you will make the Revolution to depend
upon the year's Motion; which is already in the Movement, and described 4.
before. Or if you would have it depend upon the Dial-wheel, or upon the Beats
of a Pendulu^, enough is said before to direct in mis matter.

In all these Slow motions, you may somewhat ^^^^ten your labor, by endless
Screws to serve for Pinions, which are but as a Pinion of one tooth.

Mat. Com. p. 117.
Sir Jonas Moor's account of his large ^phere going by Clock-work, will
suffi^ently illustrate this paragraph. In this ^phere, is a Motion of 17100
years, for ^he Sun's Apogeum, performed by six ^heels, thus, as Sir Jonas
relates it; For the Great-wheel fixed is 96, a Spindle-wheel of 12 bars turns
round it 8 times in 24 hours, that is, in 3 hours; after these, there are four
Wheels, 20, 73, 24, and 75, wrought by endless Screws that are in value but
one: therefore 3, 20, 73, 24, and 75 multiplied together continually, produces
7884000 V. Sect. 1 4, 5.
hours, which divided, by 24 gives 3285000 days, equal to 900 years. Now on the
last wheel 75 is a pinion of 6, turning a great Wheel, that carries the
Apogeum number 114: and 114 divided by 6, gives 19 the quotient: and 900 times
19 is 17100 years.

Thus I have, with all the perspicuity I ^ould, led my Reader through the whole
^rt of Calculation, so much of it at least, ^at I hope he will be master of it
all; not ^ly of those motions, which I have par^cularly treated about, but of
any other ^t mentioned: Such as the Revolution of the Dragons Head and Tail,
whereby the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon are found, the Revolution of the
several Orbs, according to the Ptolemaick System, or of the celestial bodies
themselves, according to better Systems, with many other such curious
performances, which have made the Sphere of Archimedes of old famous: and since
him, that of William of Zeland, De Subtle. l. 17.
and another of Janellus Turrianus of Cremona, mentioned by Cardan: and of late,
that elaborate piece of Mr. Watson, late of Coventry, now of London, in her
late Majesty's Closet.

CHAP. III. To alter Clock-work, or convert one Movement into another.
THis Chapter I design for the use of such, as would convert old Balance
Clocks into Pendulums, or would make any old work serve for the trial of new
motions, or would apply it to any other such like use.

1. To do this, you may draw a Scheme of your old work: and so you will see
what Quotients you have, and what you will want. To do all which, there are
sufficient instructions in the preceding Chapter. A few instances will make all
plain.

2. Let us choose for instance an old Balance clock to be turned into a
Pendulum of 6 inches. The old work is, The Great-wheel 56, the Pinion 7; the
next Wheel 54, the Pinion 6; the Crown-wheel 19, etc. The Scheme 4) 48 (12 7)
56 (8 6) 54 (9 19


of this work is in the Margin. The Quotients and Crown-wheel and 2 Pallets
multiplied together continually, produce 2736, which are the Strokes of the
Balance, in one turn of the Great-wheel, by Sect. l. 4, 5. of the last
Chapter. And by the Quotient of the Dial-wheel (which is 12) it appears, that
the Great-wheel goes round once in an hour. Or you may find the Beats in an
hour, by 5. last cited. Having thus found the Beats in an hour, of the old
work, you must next find the Beats in an hour, of a 6 inches Pendulum; which
you may do by Horol. Dis. p. 54.
Chap. 5. 4. following; or by Mr. Smith's Tables, according to whom the number
is* 9368. Divide this by 2736, and you have the Quotient, which 2736) 9368 (3


is to be added to the Scheme of the old work. This Quotient is 3 and near * as
you see in the Margin.

The work thus altered, will 4) 48 (12 7) 56 (8 6) 54 (9 6 (2^ (3 19


stand as you see in the Margin, viz. a Pinion 6, and a Contrate-wheel 21, must
be added.

According to this way, the old work will stand as before, only the Crown-wheel
must be inverted.

3. But because the Crown-wheel is too big for the Contrate-wheel (which is
unseemly) therefore it will be best, *to make both the Contrate, and
Crown-wheels new; and increase the number of the Contrate-wheel, but diminish
that of the Crown-wheel. To do which, pitch upon some convenient number for the
Crown-wheel. Multiply all the Quotients, and this new Crown-wheel number, as
before; and divide 9368 by it. As, Suppose you pitch upon 11 for the
Crown-wheel: if you multiply 8, 9 and 11* the Product is 792; which multiplied
by the 2 Pallets, makes 1584, which are the Beats in one turn of the
Great-wheel, or V. Sect. 1* 6.
in an hour. Divide 9368 by it, and you have near 6 for the Quotient 4) 48 (12
7) 56 (8 6) 54 (9 6) 36 (6 11


of your Contrate-wheel. The work thus ordered, will stand as in the Margin.

If you would correct your work, to find the true number of Beats in an hour,
etc. you must proceed, as is shown Sect. 2. 6, and latter end of 7. of the last
Chapter.

4. But suppose you have a mind to change the former old Watch, into a 30 hour
piece, and to retain the old Ballance-wheel (which may be often done:) in this
case, you must add a Contrate-wheel, and alter the Pinion of report. For the
Contrate-wheel, choose such a Quotient, as will best suit with the rest of your
work; and then multiply all your Quotients, Crown-wheel and ^ Pallets together,
and so find the number of turns in the Great-wheel, as before. Then say by
Sect. 2. 6. part 5. before, As the Beats in one turn of the Great-wheel, To the
Beats in an hour:: So are the hours of the Dial, To the quotient of the Pinion
of Report.

Thus in the old work before; to the old quotients 8 and 9, you may add another
of 8, for the Contrate-wheel. Those multiplied, as was now directed, make
21888, for the Beats in one turn of the Great-wheel. And then for the quotient
of the Pinion of Report, say in numbers thus, 21888. 9368:: 12. 5. 6) 30 (5 7)
56 (8 6) 54 (9 6) 48 (8 19


The quotient for the Pinion of Report is somewhat more than 5, which overplus
may be neglected, as you see by the Scheme of the whole work in the Margin.

If you desire to know what number of turns, the Fusy must have in this work;
Say by the last quoted * part 1, in numbers thus, 21888. 9368:: 30. 13 almost.
So that near 13 turns will do.

If you would correct your work, to know the exact Beats, etc. you are referred
to directions in the end of the last paragraph.

5. I shall add but one thing more, to what has been said in this Chapter, and
that is, to change the Striking part of this old Movement, into a 30 hour piece.

A Scheme of the old 4) 39 ^ 7) 56 (8 pins 6) 54 (9 6) 48 (8


work is in the Margin.

And to alter it, the best way is, to double the number of Striking pins,
making the 8, sixteen pins: and the Hoop of the Detent-wheel double, that the
Pin-wheel may strike two strokes, in its going round once.

The greatest inconvenience here, will be to bridle the rapidity of the
Strokes; because a quotient of (2 only, added to the old work, will be
sufficient for this purpose: which being an inconvenient number, 'twill be
necessary to be content with the old numbers, or make more Wheels and Pinions
new, than may be thought worth the while.

If you would find what number of turns, the Fusy will require; you must find
how many Strokes are in 30 hours, by Sect. 3. 2. R. 6. before. These are 195;
which divided by the 16 Pins, gives somewhat more than 12 turns of the Fusy.

Lastly, for the Pinion of Report, you must pursue the directions in the last
quoted place, R. 5.

The work thus altered, 5) 24 (7/18/6 7) 56 8. 16 pins 6) 54 (9 6) 48 (8


will stand as in the Margin.

CHAP. IV. To size the Wheels and Pinions, or proportion them to each other,
both Arithmetically and Mechanically.
1. FOr the exact and easy moving of the Wheels and Pinions together, it is
necessary that they should fit each other, by having their teeth and leaves of
the same wideness, or near of the same wideness. For many do make the Leaves of
the Pinion narrower than the Teeth of its Wheel, by reason of their running
deep in each other; which is as if the Diameters of the Wheel and Pinion were
less. But this I leave to those, whose practice and observations are greater
than mine in these matters.

2. To make the Teeth of a Wheel and Pinion alike, the way Arithmetically is
thus, First you must find the Circumference of your Wheel and Pinion; which you
may best do by the Rule of Three (so often made use of before) the Rule is
thus, as 7 is to 22:: so is the Diameter to the Circumference. Or more exactly
thus, as 1, is to 3, 1416:: So Diam. to Circum.

Suppose you have a Wheel of 2 inches diameter, and 60 Teeth, and would fit to
it a Pinion of 6 Leaves. First 7 22:: 2. 6, 3. The circumference of the Wheel,
is then 6 inches, and 3 tenths of an inch. Then say, as the Teeth of the Wheel,
to the circumference Sir J. Moor Mat. Com. R. 5.
of it:: So are the Leaves of the Pinion, to the circumference thereof. In
numbers thus 60* 6, 3:: 6*, 63. The Pinion then is 63 hundredth parts of an
inch round.

Now to find the Diameter, it is but the reverse of the former Rule, viz. As 22.
to 7:: So the Circumference to the Diameter. In numbers thus, for the foregoing
Pinion, 22. 7::, 63* 2, The Diameter then of the Pinion must be two tenths of
an inch, to fit the aforesaid Wheel of 2 inches diameter.

sect 3. But because this way may be difficult to persons unacquainted with
Decimal Arithmetic, which is very necessary here; therefore I shall set down a
way to do it mechanically. Having drawn a Circle, divide it into as many parts,
as you intend leaves in the Pinion you would size. From two of these points in
the Circle, draw two lines to the Center: to which apply two of the Teeth of
your Wheel, guiding them up and down until they touch at the same width on
these Radii. Mark where this agreement is, and a small circle drawn there, will
represent the circumference of the Pinion sought after.

CHAP. V. Of Pendulums.
sect 1. AMong all known Motions, none measures Time so regularly, as that of
a Pendulum. But yet Watches governed hereby are not so persect, but that they
are subject to the variations of weather, foulness, etc. And the shorter, and
lesser the Pendulum is, so much the more subject such Watches are to these
annoyances.

There are two ways to obviate these inconveniences in some measure. One way
is, to make the Pendulum long, the Bob heavy, and to vibrate but a little way
from its settlement. Which is now the most usual way in England. The other is
the contrivance of the ingenious Mr. Hu^ens, which is, to make the upper part
of the rod, play between two cheek parts of ^ Cycloid. Sir Jonas Moor says,
that after some time, and charge of Experiments, Id. ib. Rule 3.
he believes this latter to be the better way. And Mr Hugens calls it admirable.

If any desire to know how to make those Cycloidal Cheeks, fit to all
Pendulums, I refer him to the aforesaid Mr. Zulichem's De Horol. Oscil. p. 10,
11, 12.
Book, because I cannot show how to do it, without the trouble of Figures; and
this way is much ceased, since the Crown-wheel method (to which it is chiefly
proper) is swallowed up by the Royal Pendulums.

sect 2. Another thing to be remarked in Pendulums is, That the longer the
Vibration is, the ^lower it is. For if two isochrone Pendulums do move, one the
quadrant of a circle, the other not above 3 or 4 degrees, this latter shall
move somewhat quicker than the former. Which is the true reason, why small
Crown-wheel Pendulums go faster in cold weather, or when soul, than at other
times. Yea, in the best Royal Pendulum, if you put a divided plate behind the
Ball, and observe its swings, you may perceive the Vibrations to be sometimes
shorter; and that then the Watch does gain too much* Somewhat also may perhaps
be attributed to the rarity or density of the air; which I have not yet had an
opportunity of observing, by comparing with a good Baroscope, the various
vibrations of a good Royal Pendulum. But Mr. Boil says, that a Pendulum moves
as long, and as Machina Pneumat. Exp. 26.
fast in a thick medium, as a thin one; contrary to the opinion of some
Naturalists, who think the contrary. His opinion is grounded upon the
experiment of a Pendulum vibrating in his air-pump, the air sucked out, and in
the open air; wherein was no alteration.

sect 3. For the calculation of all Pendulums, it is necessary to fix upon some
one, to be as a Standard to the rest. I pitch upon a Pend* to vibrate Seconds
each stroke.

Mr. Hugens lays down the length of a Pend. to swing Seconds to be 3 feet, 3
inches, and 2 tenths of an inch (according to Sir J. Moor's reduction of it to
English measure. Ibid.
)

Ibid.
The Honorable Lord Bru^cker (says Sir Jonas) and Mr. Rook, found the length
to be 39, 25 inches, which a little exceeds the other: and may be, was justened
by Mr. Hugens's Rule for the Center of Oscillation. For Mounton's Pendulum,
that* vibrate 132 times in a minute, it will be found likewise 8, 1 inches,
agreeing to 39, 2 inches English. Therefore for certain 39, 2 inches may be
called the Universal measure, and relied on, to be the near length of a Pend.
that shall swing Seconds each vibration.

But forasmuch as the different size of the Ball, will make some difference in
the length of this Standard Pend., therefore to make this Pend. an Universal
measure, to fit all Places and Ages, you must measure from the Point of
Suspension, to the Center of Oscillation. Which Center is found by this Rule,
As the length of the Fiugenius ^^^i supra, p. 141. Sir J. Moor ibid.
String from the point of* Suspension to the center of a round Ball: is to the
Semidiameter of a round Ball: is to the Semidiameter, to a fourth number. Add
two fifths of that fourth number, to the former length, and you have the center
of Oscillation; and thereby the true length of this Standard Pendulum.

If it be desired to fit a Ball of a triangular, quadrangular, or any other
form to this Pend, the center of Oscillation in any of these bodies, may be
found in the last cited book of Mr Zulichem.

If it be asked, What is the meaning of the Center of Oscillation? The most
intelligible answer (although not perfectly true) is, That it is that point of the
Ball, at which if you imagine it divided into two parts, by a circle, whose
center is in the point of Suspension, the lower part of the Ball shall be of
the same weight (or near so) with the upper.

4. Having thus fixed a Standard, I shall next show how from thence to find the
Vibrations, or Lengths of all other Pendulums. Which is done by this Rule,
Hugen* Moor, ib^*
The squares of the Vibrations, bear the same Proportion to each other, as
their Length^ do. And so contrary wise. Wherefore to find the length of a Pend*
say* As the Square of the Vibrations given: To the Square of 60 (the
Standard):: So is the length of the Standard (viz. 39, 2) To the length of the
Pend. sought.

If by the length, you would find the Vibrations, it is the reverse of the last
Rule, viz. As the length proposed: To the Standard (39, 2):: So is the Square
of 60 (the vibrations of the Standard): To the Vibrations sought.

Suppose for example, you would know what length a Pend. is, that vibrates 153
strokes in a minute. The Square of 153 (i. e. 153 times 153) is 23409. Say,
23409. 3600:: 39, 2. 6. A Pend. then that vibrates 153 in a minute, is about 6
inches long.

On the other hand, if you would know how many strokes a Pend. of 6 inches has
in a minute; Say, 6. 39, 2:: 3600. 23520. The square root whereof is 153, and
somewhat more.

Note, Because 141120 is always the Product of the two middle terms multiplied
together, therefore you need only to divide this number by the Square of the
Vibrations, it gives the length sought: by the length, it gives the square of
the Vibrations.

If you operate by the Logarithms, you will much contract your labor. For if
you seek the length, it is but Substracting the Logarithm of the Square of the
Vibrations, out of the Logarithm of 141120, which is 5. 149588, and the
Remainder is the Logarithm of the length sought.

If you seek the Vibrations, it is but Substracting out of the aforesaid
Logarithm 5. 149588, the Logarithm of the length given, and half the Residue is
the Logarithm of the Vibrations required. The following examples will
illustrate each particular.

According to the foregoing Directions* I have calculated the following Table*
to Pendulums of various lengths: and have therein showed the Vibrations in a
minute, and an hour, from 1 to 100 inches. If any desire a more minute account,
I refer Horolog. Disquis.
him to Mr Smith's Tables in his late Book. The reason why his calculation and
mine differ, is because he measures the length of the Pend. from the point of
Suspension, to the lower part of the Bob; and I only to the center of the Bob.
His Standards are 6 inches, and 41 inches; and mine is 39, 2, for the reasons
aforegoing.

39,6 2376 100 37,5 2250

The use of this Table is manifest, and needs no explication. As to the
Decimals in the column of Minute-Swings, I have ^dded them for the sake of
calculating the column of Hour-Swings; which would have been judged false
without them, and would not have been exactly true without them.

5* I have but one thing more to add to this Chap. of Pendulums, and that is,
^o Correct their Motion.

The usual way is, to screw up, or let down the Ball. In doing of which, a
small alteration will make a considerable ^ariation of Time: as you will find
by calculation, according to the last paragraph. To prevent the inconvenience
of ^crewing the Ball too high, or low, Mr Smith has contrived a very pretty
Table Ibid.
^or dividing the Nut of a Pendulum Screw, ^o as to alter your Clock but a
Second in ^day. But by reason no Screw and Nut can be so made, as to be most
exactly strait and true, therefore it may happen, that instead of altering your
Watch to your mind, you may do quite contrary; as ^nstead of letting the Ball
down, you may raise it higher, by the false running of the Nut upon the Screw.

Considering this irremediable inconvenience, I am of opinion, that Mr Hugens's
Ibid. de Centro Oscil. Prop. 23.
way would do very well, added to this. His way is, To have a small Weight, or
Bob, to slide up and down the Pend. rod, above the Ball (which is immovable.)
But I would rather advise, that the Ball be made to screw up and down, to bring
the Pend. pretty near its gauge: and that this little Bob should serve only for
more nice corrections; as the alteration of a Second, or etc. Which it will do,
better than the Great Ball. For a whole turn of this little Bob, will not
affect the motion of the Pend. near so much as a small alteration of the Great
Ball.

The Directions Mr Hugens gives, about this little Corrector, is, That it
should be equal to the weight of the Wire, or Rod of the Pend., or about a 50th
part of the weight of the Great Ball, which he appoints to be three pounds.

Perhaps this Bob may do its office, if it be made to screw only up and down
the lower part of the Rod, below the Ball. If not, you must make it slide above
the Ball, or be screwed up and down there.

Seeing this little Bob is not the only Corrector (as in Mr Zulichem's way)
therefore it is not necessary to insert here, that ingenious person's Table,
showing what alterations of Time will be made by sliding the Bob up and down
the rod. Only thus much may be observed in that Table of his, viz. That a small
alteration of the Corrector toward the lower end of the Pend*, does make as
great an alteration of Time, as a greater raising or falling of it, does make
higher. Thus the little Bob raised 7 divisions of the Rod, from the Center of
Oscillation, will alter the Watch 15 seconds; raised 15, 2 'twill alter it 30.
But whereas, if it be raised to 154* 3 parts of the Rod, it will make the Watch
go faster 3 minutes, 15 seconds, the Watch shall be but 3. 30 faster, if the
Bob be raised to 192* 6. So that here you have but 15 variation, by raising the
Bob above 38 parts; whereas lower, you had the same variation, when raised not
above 7 or 8 parts.

From what has been said, it appears, that about half a turn of this little
justening Bob, will at no time alter the Watch, above a second in 24 hours* and
that above a whole turn, will not alter it so much, higher on the Rod;
supposing that the Bob at every turn ascended or descended a whole degree of
the Rod; which perhaps it will not do in 20 turns: and consequently, it will
require many turns, to alter the Watch but one second.

CHAP. VI. The Antiquity, and general History of Watch, or Clock-work.
1. IT is probable, that in all Ages, some Instruments or other have been used,
for the Measuring of Time. But the earliest we read of, is the Dial of Ahaz.
Concerning which, little of certainty 2 Kings ^0* 11. Isai. 38. 8.
can be said. The Hebrew word Ma^aloth does properly signify Degrees, Steps, or
Stairs, by which we ascend to any place. And so this word Ma^aloth is rendered
Ezekiel. 40. 26. And accordingly the LXXII translate the Ma^aloth of Ahaz, by the
words (...), and '(...), i. e. Steps or Ascents. The like does the Syriack,
Arabic, and other Versions.

Some pretend to give a description of this Dial of Ahaz: but it being mere
guessing, and little to my purpose, I shall not trouble the Reader with the
various opinions about it.

Among the Greeks and Romans, there were two ways chiefly used to measure their
Hours. One was by Clepsydrae, or Hour* glasses. The other by the Solaria, or
Sun-dials. The (...), says Suidas and Phavorinus, was (...) Lexic. in verbo
(...)
(...) i. e. An Astronomical Instrument, by which the Hours were measured. Also,
That it was a Vessel, having a little hole in the bottom, which was set in the
Courts of Judicature, full of water; by which the Lawyers pleaded. This was,
says Phavorinus, to prevent babbling, that such as spoke, ought to brief in
their Speeches.

As to the Invention of those Waterwatches (which were, no doubt, of more
common use, than only in the Law-Courts) De die Natali c. 23.
the Invention, I say, of them, is attributed, by Censorinus, to P. Cornelius
Nasica, the Censor (Scipio Nasica, Pliny calls him.)

The other way of measuring the Hours, Ibid.
with Sun-dials, seems, from Pliny and Censorinus, to have been an earlier
invention Not. Hist. l. 2. c. 76.
than the last. Pliny says, that Anaximenes Milesius, the Scholar of
Anaximander, invented Dialling, and was the first that showed a Sun-dial at
Lacedoemon. Vitruvius De Archit. l. 6. c. 48.
calls him Milesius Anaximander. This Anaximander or Anaximenes was cotemporary
with Pythagoras, says Laertius; and flourished about the time of the Prophet
Daniel.

But enough of these ancient Timeengines, which are not very much to my
purpose, being not pieces of Watch-work.

I shall in the next place take notice of a few Horological Machines, that I
have met with; which, whether pieces of Clock-work, or not, I leave to the
Readers judgment.

In the Life of Dions
The first is that of Dionysius, which Plutarch commends for a very
magnificent, and illustrious Piece. But this might be only a well delineated
Sun-dial.

Another Piece, is that of Sapor King of Persia. Whether that Sapor, who was
Eusebius. Vit. Constable* l. 3.
cotemporary with Constantine the Great, I ^ow not. ^ardan says it was made of
De Subtle* l. 17.
Glass; that the King could sit in the middle of it, and see its Stars rise and
set* But not finding whether this Sphere was moved by Clock-work, or whether it
^ad any regular motion, I shall say no ^ore concerning it.

The last Machine I shall mention in ^his Paragraph, is one I find des^ribed by
De Architect. l. 9. c. 9^
^itruvius. Which to me seems to be a piece of Watch-work, moved by an equal
^nflux of Water.

If the Reader will consult the French ^dition of Vitruvius, he will find there
a ^ir Cut of it.

Among diverse seats which this Ma^hine performed (as sounding Trumpets,
^hrowing Stones, etc.) one use of it was, ^o show the Hours (which were unequal
^n that age) through every month of the ^ear. The words of Vitruvius are,
Aequa^iter influens aqua sublevat Scaphum inversum (quod ^b artificibus Phellos
sive Tympanam ^icitur) in quo collocata regula* versatilia ^^mpana denticuli^
a*qualibus s^nt perfecta. ^ui denticuli alius alium impelientes, ver^^^iones
modicas faciant, ac motiones. Item (...) Reg^loe, aliaque Tympana ad eundem
modum dentata, quoe una motione coacta, versando faciunt effectus,
varietatesque motionum: in quibus moventur Sigilla, vertuntur Metoe, calculi
aut Tona projiciuntur, Buccinoe canunt, etc. In his etiam, aut in colu^na, ant
parastatica Horoe describuntur; quas Sigillum egrediens ab imo virguloe,
significat, in diem totum: quarum brevitates ant crescentias, cuneorum adjectus
aut exemptus, in singulis diebus and mensibus, perficere cogit.

The Inventer of this famous Machine, Vitruvius says, was one Ctesibius, a
Barbers Son of Alexandria. Which Ctesibius flourished under Ptolomy Euergetes,
says V^d. Phi^^nd. not. in Vitruv.
Athenoeus, l. 4. And if so, he lived about 240 years before our Saviors days;
and might be cotemporary with Archimedes.

3. Thus having given a small account of the ancient ways of Measuring Time, it
is time to come closer to our business, and say something more particularly of
Clock-work.

Which is thought to be a much younger invention, than the forementioned
Pieces; and to have had its beginning in Germany, within less than these 200
years.

It is very probable, that our Balance Clocks, and some other Automata, might
have their beginning there; or that Clock-work (which had long been buried in
oblivion) might be revived there. But that Clock work was the Invention of that
age purely, I utterly deny; having (besides what goes before) two instances to
the contrary, of much earlier date.

4. The first example is the Sphere of Archimedes; who lived about 200 years
before our Saviors days. There is no mention of this Sphere in Archimedes his
extant works: but we have an account of it in others. Cicero speaks of it more
than once. In his 2d Book De Nature Deorum, are these words; Archimedem
arbitrantur plus valuisse in imitandis Sphoeroe conversionibus, quam Naturam in
efficiendis, etc. And in his Tusculane Questions, Lib. 1. 25. Edit. El^ivir.
the Collocutor, proving the Soul to be of a Divine Nature, argues from this
Contrivance of Archimedes, and says, Nam cum Archimedes Lunoe, Solis, quinque
Errantium motus in Sphoeram illigavit, effecit, etc. The Sense is, That
Archimedes contrived a Sphere, which showed the motion of the Moon, Sun, and
five Planets.

Epigr. in Sphoer. Archimed. Vid. Card. de Subtle. l. 17.
But the most accurate description is that of Claudian, in these words.

Jupiter in parvo cum cerneret oethera vitro,
Risit, and ad Superos talia dicta dedit:
Huccine mortalis progressa potentia curoe?
Jam meus in fragili luditur or be labor.
Jura poli, rerumque fidem, legesque Deorum,
Ecce Syracusius transtulit art Senex.
Inclusus variis famulatur Spiritus astris,
Et vivum certis motibus urget opus.
Percurrit proprium mentitus Signifer annum.
Et simulata novo Cynthia mense redit.
Jamque suum volvens audax industria mundum
Gaudet, and humana Sidera mente regit.
Quid falso insontem tonitru Salmonea miror?
Aemula Naturoe parva reperta manus.
In English thus:
When Jove espied in Glass his Heavens made,
He smiled, and to the other Gods thus said:
Strange feats! when human art so far proceeds,
To ape in brittle Orbs my greatest deeds.
The heavenly motions, Natures constant course,
Lo! here old Archimede to art transfers.
The enclosed Spirit here each Star does drive;
And to the living work sure motions give.
The Sun in counterfeit his year does run,
And Cynthia too her monthly circle turn.
Since now bold man has Worlds of's own descried
He joys, and the Stars by human art can guide.
Why should we so admire proud Salmons cheats
When one poor hand Natures chief work repeats.
From this description it appears, that in this Sphere, the Sun, Moon, and
other heavenly bodies, had their proper motion: and that this motion was
effected by some enclosed Spirit. What this enclosed Spirit was, I cannot tell,
but suppose it to be Springs, Wheels or Pullies, or some such means of
Clock-work: Which being hidden from vulgar eyes, might be ^^ken for some Angel,
Spirit, or Divine power; unless by Spirit here, you un^erstand some aerious,
subtiliz'd liquor, (...) vapors. But how this, or indeed any thing, but
Clock-work, could give such ^ue, and regular motions, I am not able ^o guess.

5. The next instance I have met with (...) ancient Clock-work, is that famous
^ne in Cicero, which, among other irre^agable De Not. Deor. Lib. 2. 34.
arguments* is brought in to love, That there is some intelligent, divine, and
wise Being, that inhabiteth, rules in, and is as an Architect of so great a
work, as the World is, as the Collocutor expresses himself* His words (so far
as they relate to my present purpose) are these: Cum Solarium vel descriptum,
aut ex Aqua contemplere, intelligere declarari horas art,non casu, etc. And a
little after, Quod si in Scythiam, aut in Britanniam, Sphaeram aliquis tulerit
hanc, quam nuper familiaris noster effecit Posidonius, cujus singulae
Conversiones idem efficient in Sole, and in Luna, and in quinque Stellis
errantibus, quod efficitur in coelo singulis diebus, and noctibus; quis in illa
barbary dubitet, quin ea Sphaera sit perfecta ratione? The sum of the Authors
meaning is, That there were Sun-dials described, or drawn [with Lines, after
the manner as our Sun-dials are:] and some made with Water(which were the
Clepsydrae, or Hour-glasses, beforementioned.) That Posidonius had lately
contrived a Sphere, whose Motions were the same in the Sun, Moon, and 5
Planets, as were performed in the heavens each day and night.

The age wherein this Sphere was in^ented, was Cicero's time, which was a^out
80 years before our Saviors birth.

And that it was a piece of Clock-work, ^s not (I think) to be doubted, if it
be ^onsidered, that it kept time with those ^elestial bodies, imitating both
their an^ual, and diurnal motions, as from the ^escription we may gather it did.

It may be questioned, whether those Machines were common or not: I believe
^hey were rarities then, as well as Mr Wat^n's and others are accounted now.
But ^nethinks it is hard to imagine, that so ^seful an Invention should not be
reduced ^to common use; it being natural, and ^sie to apply it to the measuring
of ^ours (tho unequal) especially in two ^^ch Ages, as those of Archimedes and
^ully were, in which the Liberal Arts so greatly flourished.

6. After the times last mentioned, I and little worth remark, till the last
Age; (...) which Clock-work was revived, or ^holly invented anew in Germany* as
is ^enerally thought, because the ancient ^ieces are German work. But who was
^e Inventer, or in what time, I cannot M^lyneaux, Scioth. Telescop. Ep. Dedic.
discover. Some think Sever. Boethius invented it about the year 510. Perhaps
it was in Regiomontanus his time (if not so early as Boethius) which was above
200 years ago. It is very manifest, it was before Cardan's time, because he
speaks of it, as a thing common then. And he lived about 150 years since.

7. As to those curious contrivances in Clock-work, which perform strange,
surprising feats, I shall say little. Dr. Heylin Cosmog. l. 2.
tells us of a famous Clock and Dial in the Cathedral Church of Lunden in
Denmark. In the Dial (says he) are to be seen distinctly the Year, Month,
Weekday, and Hour of every day throughout the Year; with the Feasts, both
moveable and fixed; together with the Motion of the Sun and Moon, and their
passage through each degree of the Zodiac. Then for the Clock, it is so framed by
artifical Engines, that whenever it is to strike, two Horsemen encounter one
another, giving as many blows apiece, as the Bell sounds hours: And on the
opening of a door, there appears a Theater, the Virgin Mary on a Throne, with
Christ in her arms, and the three Kings or Magi (with their several trains)
marching in order, doing humble reverence, and presenting severally their
Gifts; two Trumpeters sounding all the while, to adorn the Pomp of that
Procession.

Magia Univers. P. 1. Proleg: and Magia Thaumaturg.
To this I might add many more such curious performances; but I rather choose to
refer the Reader to Schottus, where he may find a great variety, to please him.

CHAP. VII. Of the Invention of Pendulum Watches.
1. THe first that invented the way of applying Pendulums to Watch-work, was Mr
Christian Hugens of Zulichem; as he affirms of himself, with very cogent
reasons.

This excellent invention, he says, he put first in practice in the year 1657*
and Hor. Oscil. p. 3* Edit. Paris.
in the following year 1658, he printed a delineation and description of it.

Others have claimed the honor of this Invention; among which, the great
Galileo has the most to be said on his side. Dr. John Joachim Becher (who
printed a Book when he was in England, entitled; De Nova Temporis dimetiendi
ratione Theoria, etc. which he dedicated to the English Royal Society, Anno
1680.) he, I say, tells p. 8.
us, That the Count Magalotti (the Great Duke of Tuscany's Resident at the
Emperors Court) told him the whole History of these Pendulum Clocks, and denied
Mr Zulichem to be the Author of them. Also, That one Treffler (Clock-maker to
the Father of the then G. Duke of Tuscany) related to him the like History: and
said moreover, That he had made the first Pend. Clock, at Florence, by the
command of the Great Duke, and by the direction of his Mathematician Galilaeus
a Galilaeo; a pattern of which was brought into Holland. And further he says,
That one Caspar Doms, a Fleming, and Mathematician to John Philip a Schonborn,
the late Elector of Mentz) told him, that he had seen at Prague, in the time of
Rudolphus the Emperor, a Pend. Clock, made by the famous Justus Borgen,
Mechanic and Clock-maker to the Emperor: which Clock the great Tycho-Brahe
used in his Astronomical observations.

Exper* made in the Acad* del Cimento by Mr. Wal^er, p. 12.
Thus far Becher. To which I may add, what is said by the Academie del Cimento,
viz. It was thought good to apply the Pendulum to the Movement of the Clock* a
thing which Galilaeo first invented, and his Son Vincenzio Galilei put in
practice in the year 1649.

As to these matters thus related by hearsay by Becher, and so expressly
affirmed by the Academy, I have little to reply, but that Mr Hugens does
expressly say, He was the Inventer, and that if Galilaeo ever Hugen. ib.
thought of any such thing, he never brought it to any perfection. It is
certain, that this Invention never flourished till Mr Hugens set it abroad.

2. After Mr Hugens had thus invented these Pendulum Watches, and caused
several to be made in Holland, Mr Fromantil, a Dutch Clock-maker, came over
into England, and made the first that ever were made here: which was about the
year 1662. One of the first Pieces that was made in England, is now in
Gresham-Colledg, given to that Honorable Society by the late eminent Seth, Lord
Bishop of Salisbury: which is made exactly according to Mr Zulichem's
directions.

3. For several years this way of Mr Zulichem was the only method, viz.
Crown-wheel Pendulums, to play between two cycloidal cheeks, etc. But
afterward Mr W. Clement, a London Clock-maker, Horolog. Disquis. p. 3.
contrived them (as Mr Smith says) to go with less weight, an heavier Ball (if
you please) and to vibrate but a small compass. Which is now the universal
method of the Royal Pendulums. But Dr Hook denies Mr Clement to have invented
this; and says that it was his Invention, and that he caused a piece of this
nature to be made, which he showed before the R. Society, soon after the Fire
of London.

4. The Use of these Pendulum Watches Mr. Hugens sets forth in several
instances. Particnlarly, he gives two examples of their great use at Sea, in
discovering the Difference of Meridians, more exactly than any other way: which
he deduceth from the Observations of an English, and French Ship.

On Land, they were found very serviceable, among other uses, particularly to
these two. 1. To measure the time more exactly, and equally than the Sun. ^. To
be (as Sir Christoph. Wren first proposed) a perpetual, and universal Measure,
or Standard, to which all Lengths may be reduced, and by which they may be
udged, in all ages, and countries. For as our Royal Society, Mr Hugens, and
Mountonus have proposed after Sir Christopher Wren) this Horary foot, or
Tripedal length, which vib^teth Seconds, will fit ill ages and places* But then
respect must be had to the Center of Oscillation, which you have an account of
in Mr Hugens his ^soresaid book, de Horologio Oscillatorio, ^s has before been
said.

5. There is one contrivance more of Pendulums, still behind, viz. the Circular
Pendulum: which is mentioned by Mr Hugens as his own, but is claimed by the
ngenious Dr. Hook as really his. This ^end* does not vibrate backward and
forward, as those we have been speaking of ^o; but always round, round; the
String being suspended above, at the tripedal length, and the Ball fi^ed below,
as suppose at the end of the fly of a common ^ack.

The motion of this Circular Pend* is as regular, and much the same with what
goes before: and was thus far made very useful in Astronomical observations,
by the said Dr Hook, viz. To give warning at any moment of its circumgyration,
either when it had turned but a quarter, half, or any lesser, or greater part
of its circle. So that here you had notice not only of a Second, but of the
most minute part of a Second of Time. You may find a description of this
Pendulum, and other matters belonging to it, in Dr Hook's Lectiones
Cutlerianoe: Animad. in Hevelius Match* Caelest. p. 60.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Invention of those Pocket-Watches, commonly called Pendulum
Watches.
1. THe reason they are called Pendulum-Watches, is from the regularity of
their Strokes, and Motion. Which exactness is effected by the government of a
small Spiral Spring, running round the upper part of the Verge of the Balance:
which Spring is called the Regulator.

2. The first Inventer hereof, was that ingenious and learned member of our
Royal-Society, Dr Hook: who contrived va^ious ways of Regulation. One way was
^ith a Lodestone: another was with a under strait Spring* one end whereof
^layed backward, and forward, with the ^allance: So that the balance was to
this ^pring as the bob of a Pendulum, and the ^ttle Spring, as the Rod thereof.
And se^eral other contrivances he had besides of ^is nature.

3. But the Invention which best an^ered expectation, was at first, with two
^llances: of which I have seen two sorts, ^ho there were several others. One
^ay was without Spiral Springs, the ^her with. They both agreed in this, that
the outward Rims of both the Bal^nces, had alike number of Teeth; which ^nning
in each other, caused each Bal^nce to vibrate alike.

But as to the former of these, which had no Spiral Spring* the Verges of its
Balances, had each but one Pallet apiece, about the middle of the Verge. The
Crown-wheel lay (contrary to others) reversed, in the middle of the Watch, in
the place, and after the manner of the Contrate-wheel. The teeth of this
Crown-wheel, were cut after the manner of Contrate-wheel teeth, viz. lying
upwards, but very wide apart, so as that the Pallets (which were about one
tenth of an inch long, and n^rrow) might play in and out between each tooth.
The Verges of the two Balances, were set one on one side, the other on the
other side of the Crown-wheel, so that the Pallets might play freely in its
teeth. And when the Crown-wheel in moving round, had delivered its self of one
Pallet, the other Pallet on the opposite side, was drawn on to make its Beat,
by means of the motion which the other Balance had given its Balance, (the
two Balances moving one another, as has been said in the beginning of this
Paragraph.) And so the same back again.

It may be here noted, that for the more clear understanding of the last
contrivance, I have described the two Balances, as having Teeth on the edges
of their Rims, running in one another. But the contrivance was really thus*
There was a small Wheel under each Balance, proportioned to the width of the
Crown-wheel. But the Balances were much larger. And so the Teeth of these two
little foresaid Wheels or Balances, running in one another, moved the larger
Balances above them, all one, as if these two great Balances had been toothed
and played in each other.

4. The other way, with two Balances also, moving each other (as was said in
the beginning of the last) had a Spiral Spring to each Balance, for its
Regulator. In this Invention, only one Balance had the Pallets, as the common
Balances have: and the Crown-wheel operated upon it, according to the usual
way. But then when this Balance vibrateth, it gives the same motion backward
and forward, to the other balance; as has been said.

The first of these two ways, was never prosecuted so far, as perhaps it
deserved. And the excellency of the latter is, that no jirk, or the most
confused shake, can in the least alter its Vibrations. Which it will do in the
best Pendulum Watch with one balance now commonly used. For if you lay one of
these Watches upon a Table, and by the Pendant jirk it backward and forward,
you will put it into the greatest hurry; whereas the last mentioned Watch, with
two balances, will be nothing affected with it. But notwithstanding this
inconvenience, yet the Watch with one balance and one Spring (which was also
Dr. Hooks Invention) prevailed, and grew common, being now the universal Mode:
but of the other very few were ever made. The reason hereof, I judge, was the
great trouble and vast niceness required in it, and perhaps a little foulness
in the ballance-teeth may retard the motion of the balances. But the other is
easier made, and performs well enough, and in a pocket is scarce subject to
the aforesaid disorder, which is caused rather by a turn, than a shake.

5. The time of these Inventions was about the year 1658, as appears (among
other evidence) from this inscription, upon one of the aforesaid double
Ballance-Watches, presented to K. Charles II, viz. Robert Hook inven. 1658. T.
Tompion fecit 1675.

This Watch was wonderfully approved of by the King; and so the Invention grew
into reputation, and was much talked of at home, and abroad. Particularly its
same flew into France, from whence the Dauphine sent for two; which that
eminent Artist Mr. Tompion made for him.

6. Dr. Hook had long before this, caused several pieces of this nature, to be
made, although they did not take till after 1675. However he had before so far
proceeded herein, as to have a Patent (drawn, tho not sealed) for these, and
some other Contrivances, about Watches, in the year 1660. But the reason why
that Patent did no further proceed, was some disagreement about some Articles
in it, with some Noble Persons who were concerned for the procuring it. The
same ingenious Dr. had also a Grant for a Patent for this last way of Spring
Watches in the year 1675: but he omitted the taking it out, as thinking it not
worth the while.

7. After these Inventions of Dr. Hook, and (no doubt) after the Publication of
Mr. Hugens's book de Horolog. Oscil. at Paris 1673 (for there is not a word of
this, tho of several other Contrivances) after this, I say, Mr. Hugen's Watch
with a Spiral Spring came abroad, and made a great noise in England, as if the
Longitude could be now found. One of these the Lord Bruncker sent for out of
France, (where Mr Hugen^ had a Patent for them) which I have seen.

This Watch of Mr. Zulichem's agreed with Dr. Hook's, in the application of the
Spring to the balance: only Mr. Zulichem's had a longer Spiral Spring, and the
Pulses and Beats were much slower. That wherein it differs, is 1. The Verge
has a Pinion instead of Pallets; and a Contrate-wheel runs therein, and drives
it round, more than one turn. 2. The Pallets are on the Arbor of this
Contrate-wheel. 3. Then follows the Crown wheel, etc. 4. The balance,
instead of turning scarce quite round (as Dr. Hook's) does turn several rounds
every vibration.

8. As to the great abilities of Mr. Hugens, no man can doubt, that is
acquainted with his Books, and his share in the Philosophical Transactions,
etc. But I have some reason to doubt, whether his fancy was not first set on
work, by some Intelligence he might have of Dr Hook's Invention, from Mr
Oldenburgh, or others his correspondents here in England.

But whether or no that ingenious person does owe any thing herein to our
ingenious Dr Hook, it is however a very pretty, and ingenious contrivance; but
subject to some defects: viz. When it stands still, it will not vibrate,
until it is set on vibrating: which, tho it be no defect in a Pendulum Clock,
may be one in a Pocket-Watch, which is exposed to continual jogs. Also, it does
somewhat vary in its Vibrations, making sometimes longer, sometimes shorter
turns, and so some slower some quicker vibrations.

I have seen some other contrivances of this sort, which I mention not, because
they are of younger standing. But these two (of Dr Hook and Mr Hugens) I have
taken notice of, because they were the first that ever appeared in the world.

CHAP. IX. The Invention of Repeating Clocks.
1. THe Clocks I now shall speak of, are such as by pulling of a String, etc.
do strike the Hour, Quarter, or Minute, at any time of the day and night.

2. These Clocks are a late Invention of one Mr Barlow, of no longer standing
than the latter end of K. Charles II. about the year 1676.

This ingenious Contrivance (scarce so much as thought of before) soon took
air, and being talked of among the London Artists, set their heads to work; who
presently contrived several ways to effect such a performance. And hence arose
the diverse ways of Repeating work, which so early might be observed to be about
the Town, every man almost practicing, according to his own Invention.

3. This Invention was practiced chief^, if not only, in larger Movements,
(...) K. James II.'s Reign: at which time it as transferred into Pocket-Clocks.
But ^ere being some little contest concern^g the Author hereof, I shall relate
the ^^e matter of fact, leaving the Reader to ^own judgment.

About the latter end of K. James II.'s ^gn, Mr Barlow (the ingenious Inventer
^ore-mentioned) contrived to put his ^ention into Pocket*watches; and en^voured
(with the Lord Chief Justice ^bone, and some others) to get a Patent ^it. And
in order to it, he set Mr Tom^ the famous Artist, to work upon it: ^o
accordingly made a Piece according ^is directions.

^r Quare (a very ingenious Watch*^er in London) had some years before (...)
thinking of the like Invention: but bringing it to perfection, he laid by
thoughts of it, until the talk of Mr Bar^ Patent revived his former thoughts;
^ch he then brought to effect. This ^g known among the Watch-makers, (...) all
pressed him to endeavor to hin^ Mr Barlow's Patent. And accordingly
applications were made at Court, and a Watch of each Invention, produced before
the King and Council. The King, upon trial of each of them, was pleased to give
the preference to Mr Quare's: of which, notice was given soon after in the
Gazette.

The difference between these two Inventions was, Mr Barlow's was made to
Repeat by pushing in two pieces on each side the Watch-box: one of which
Repeated the Hour, the other the Quarter* Mr Quare's was made to Repeat, by a^
Pin that stuck out near the Pendant which being thrust in (as now it is done by
thrusting in the Pendant) did Repeat both the Hour, and Quarter, with the sam^
thrust.

It would (I think) be very frivolous, to^ speak of the various contrivances,
and methods of Repeating work, and the Inventers of them; and therefore I shall
sa^ nothing of them.

CHAP. X.
Numbers for several sorts of Movements.
I Think it may be very convenient to set down some Numbers, fit for several
Movements; partly, to be as Examples to exercise the young Reader, in the
foregoing Art of Calculation: and partly, to serve such, who want leisure or
understanding to attain to this Art.

1. But first it may be requisite, to show the usual way of Watch-makers
writing down their Numbers, which is somewhat different from that in the
preceding Book.

Their way represents the Wheel and Pinion, on the same Spindle; not as they
play in one another. Thus the numbers of an old House-Watch, of 12 hours, is
written thus;

My way: The Watch-makers way. 4) 48 *48 7) 56 56 -- 4 6) 54 54 -- 7 19 19 -- 6

According to my way, the Pin. of Report [4] drives the Dial-wheel [48:] the
Pinion [7] plays in the Great-wheel [56] etc. But according to the other way,
the Dial-wheel stands alone; the Great-wheel has the Pinion of Report on the
same arbor: the Wheel [54] has the Pin: [7] and the Crown-wheel [19] the Pin:
[6] on the same Spindles.

This latter way (tho very inconvenient in Calculation) represents a piece of
work handsomely enough, and somewhat naturally.

2. Numbers of an 8 day Piece, with 16 turns the Barrel, the Pend. vibrates
Seconds, the shows Minutes, Seconds, etc.

The Watch-part. The Clock part. 8) 96 8) 78 8) 60 -- 48) 48 -- 6) 72 6) 48 8
pins. 7) 56 6) 48 30 6) 48

In the Watch-part, the Wheel 60 is the Minute-wheel, which is set in the
middle of the Clock, that its Spindle may go through the middle of the Dial-plate
to carry the Minute-hand.

Also on this Spindle is a Wheel 48, which drives another Wheel of 48, which
last has a Pinion 6, which drives round the Wheel 72 in 12 hours. Note here
two things: 1. That the two Wheels 48, are of no other use, but to set the
Pinion 6 at a convenient distance from the Minute-wheel, to drive the Wheel 72,
which is concentrical with the Minute-wheel. For a Pinion 6 driving a Wheel 72,
would be sufficient, if the Minute-hand and Hour-hand had two different
centers. *2. These numbers, 60* 48) 48-6) 72, set thus, ought (according to the
last) be thus read, viz. The Wheel 60, has another Wheel 48 on the same
Spindle; which Wheel 48 divides, plays in, or turns round another Wheel 48;
which has a Pinion 6 concentrical with it: which Pinion drives, or divides a
Wheel of 72. For a Line parting two numbers (as 60-48) denotes those two
numbers to be concentrical, or to be placed upon the same Spindle. And when two
numbers have a hook between them (as 48) 48) it signifies one to run in the
other, as has before been hinted.

In the Striking-part, there are 8 Pins on the Second wheel 48. The Countwheel
may be fixed unto the Great-wheel, which goes round once in 12 hours.

3. A Piece of 32 days, with 16, or 12 turns both parts: the Watch shows
Hours, Minutes, and Seconds; and the Pend. vibrateth Seconds*

The Watch-part,

The Pinion of Report is fixed on the and of the arbor of the Pin*wheel. This
Pinion in the first is 12, the Count-wheel 39; thus, 12) 39. Or it may be 8)
26. ^n the latter (with 12 turns) it may be 6) 18, or 8) 24.

4. A two month Piece, of 64 days; with 16 turns; Pend. vibrateth Seconds, and
shows Minutes, Seconds, etc.

Here the third Wheel is the Pin-wheel; which also carries the Pinion of
Report 8, driving the Count-wheel 52.

Seconds, etc.

The Watch. The Clock may be the same with the 8 day piece before, 2. 8) 96 8)
64 -- 48) 48 -- 6) 72 8) 60 8) 40 The Seconds Wheel. 15

10. A Month Piece of 32 days, with Pendulum, Turns, and Motions, as the last.

In the latter of these two Numbers, the Pinion of Report is 36, on the Second
Wheel. The Dial Wheel is 9.

The Clock-part may have the same Numbers, as the Year-piece before 7.

12. An 8 Day Piece, to show the Hour and Minute, Pend. about 3 inches long.

Automata showing the Motion of the Celestial Bodies.
1. Numbers for the Motion of the Sun and Moon. See before in Chap. 2. Sect. 5.
3, 4.

2. Numbers to show the Revolution of the Planet Saturn, which consists of
10759 days.

On the Dial-wheel. If you would make it depend upon a Wheel going round in a
year, thus. 5) 69 4) 52 4) 48 10) 59 or thus, 4) 118 4) 40 6) 30

Note, The lowermost Pinion in these, and the following numbers, is to be fixed
concentrical to the Wheel, which is to drive the Motion, viz. the Dial-wheel,
Year-wheel, or etc.

3. Numbers for the Planet Jupiter, whose Revolution is 4332 days. On the
Dial-wheel.

4) 48 Or thus, on the Year-wheel. 4) 40 6) 71 4) 36 4) 32

Note here, That the two last numbers of Saturn, may be the two first of
Jupiter also.

By the permission of my ingenious friend Mr Flamsteed, I here insert a
description of Mr Olaus Romer, the French King's Mathematician's Instrument, to
represent the Motion of Jupiter's Satellites; a copy of which he sent to Mr
Flamsteed in 1679.

Upon an axis (which turns round once in 7 days) are four Wheels fixed: one of
87 teeth; a second of 63; the third 42; and the last of 28 teeth. On another
axis run 4 other Wheels (or Pinions you may call them) which are driven by the
asoresaid Wheels. The first is a Wheel, or Pinion of 22 leaves, driven by the
Wheel 87, which carries round the first Satellite. The second is 32, driven by
the Wheel 63, which carries round the second Satellite. The third has 43
leaves, driven by the Wheel 42, which carries the third Satellite. And lastly,
is the Pinion 67, driven by the Wheel 28, which carries round the fourth
Satellite.

On the first axis is an Index, that points to a circle divided into 168
parts, which are the hours in 7 days.

On the other axis all the Pinions run concentrically, by means of their being
hollow in the middle. In the midst of them all, the axis of Jupiter himself is
fixed, with a little Ball at the top, representing Jupiter's body. On the ends
of 4 small Wires, fixed in the four several Sockets of the aforesaid Pinions,
may 4 lesser Globules be placed (at their due distance from Jupiter's Globule)
to represent the 4 Satellites going round that Planet.

4. Numbers for Mars, whose Revolution is 1 year 322 days.

On the Dial-wheel* 4) 48 The two last Numbers of Saturn may be the two first
of Mars also. 4) 40 4) 45

5. Numbers for Venus, whose Revolution is in 224 days.

On the Dial-wheel. 4) 32 Note, The last number of Jupiter may be the first of
Venus. 4) 32 4) 28

6. Numbers for Mercury, whose Revolution is near 88 days.

On the Dial-wheel. 4) 56 4) 52

7. Numbers to represent the Motion of the Dragon's Head and Tail, (near 19
years) to show the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon.

On the Dial-wheel. On the Year-wheel. 4) 48 4) 76 4) 40 Note, The two last
numbers of Saturn may be the two first of this on the Dial-wheel. 4) 44 4) 42

As to the placing these several Motions on the Dial-plate, I shall leave it
wholly to the Work-mans contrivance. He may perhaps make them to represent the
Copernican, or some other Sys^em.

Numbers for Pocket*Watches.
1. A Watch to go 8 Days, with 1^ turns, to show Minutes and Seconds, the Train
16000.

6) 96 6) 48 -- 12) 48 -- 12) 36. 6) 45 On the Wheel [42] is the Second's hand
placed, and on the Wheel [48] the Minute hand. 6) 42 19

2. Another of the same, without Minutes and Seconds, to go with only 8 turns.

20) 10 6) 66 6) 60 5) 50 5) 45 19

3. A Pocket-Watch of 32 Hours, with 8 turns, to show Minutes and Seconds,
Train as the last.

12) 48 6) 48 -- 12) 48 -- 12) 36 6) 45 6) 42 -- Seconds Hand. 19

4. The usual Numbers of 30 hours Pendulum Watches, with 8 turns, to show the
Hour and Minute.

12) 48 6) 54 -- 12) 48 -- 12) 36 6) 48 6) 45 15

If any of the Numbers of the preceding Wheels and Pinions should not please
the Reader, he may easily correct them to his mind, by the Instructions in the
foregoing Book. The way in short is this: Divide the Wheel by the Pinion, and
so find the number of turns, according to Chap. 2. Sect. 1. 2. Multiply the
Pinion you like better, by this number of turns, and the Product is the Wheel.
Thus in the 8 day Pocket-watch 1, if you think the Great-wheel too large, you
make it instead of 6) 96 (16 thus, viz. 5) 80 (16: i. e. choosing the Pinion
only 5, and multiplying it by 16 (the turns) the Wheel will be 80.

Tables of Time relating to Watch-work.
A Table of Time.
Seconds. 60 Minutes. 3600 60 Hours. 86400 1440 24 Day. 604800 10080 168 7
Week. 2592000 43200 720 30 4 Month. 31536000 525600 8760 365 52 12 Year.

The foregoing Table will be of good use in Calculation, for the ready finding
out the parts of Time: which is thus. Find the parts of time you seek for, the
number in the concurrence of Squares, is the answer to your question. Thus,
suppose you seek for the number of Seconds ^n a Year: in the Square under
Seconds, and in the same line with Year (which is the ^owermost Square on the
left hand) is the number sought, viz. 315, etc. So Minutes in a Month, are
43200.

If you would know any number, where there is the addition of an odd number to
it, as the Seconds in a Month and one day; add the Seconds in a month (which
are 259 --) and the Seconds in a Day (which are 86 --) and you have the number
sought, viz. 2678400.

Explanation of the Table.
This Table shows how much the Sidereal, goes faster than the Solar day, in
any number of nights for a month. So that observing by your Watch, the nice
time when any fixed Star comes to the Meridian, or any other point of the
Heavens: if after one Revolution of that same Star to the same point, your
Watch goes 3. 57 ^lower than the Star; or after two nights 7. 54; or 16
nights, 1 h. 3. 20, etc. then does your Watch keep time rightly with the Mean
motion of the Sun. If it vary from the Table, you must alter the length of your
Pend* to make it so keep time.

To observe the time nicely, when the Star comes again to the same point of
the heavens, it is necessary to make the observation with a Telescope, that has
cross threads in the focus of the object-glass; and so leaving the Telescope
fixed in the same posture, till a second Observation. You may do this with the
telescopular sights of a Quadrant, or Sextans, and so leaving it standing until
anoher night of Observation. Or for want of this more nice way, you may do it
by looking along by the edge of two Strings, suspended with Plumbets, in a
room, at some distance from one another. Or by looking at the edge of a
Chimney, etc. as Mr Watson has directed, at the end of Mr Smith's Horo^.
Disquis. But to make a tolerable observation any of these last ways, it is
necessary to have a Candle shine upon the edge of the furthermost String, or
Chimney; without which you cannot see exactly when the Star comes thereto.

Remarks upon the Table.
The Column of the Sun's Refractions, I owe to that accurate observer of the
celestial motions, Mr* Flamsteed. Which Refractions, although in the Table the
same, yet do differ at different seasons of the year, nay perhaps, according to
the different temperature of the air sometimes, in the same day. Thus Mr
Flamsteed found the Refractions in February, very different from those in
April: and it is observed, that the Refractions are commonly greater, when the
Mercury is higher in the Barometer.

The Table therefore does not show what the Refractions always are, but only
about the middle quantity of them, at every degree, of the 10 first of the
Sun's altitude. And accordingly I have calculated the Variations thereby made
in the hour of the day.

These Variations of the hour are greater or lesser, according as the angle of
the Sun's diurnal motion is acuter with the horizon. The reason is plain;
because as the Sun appears by refraction higher than really he is; so this
false height does affect the hours in Winter, more than the Summer half year.

There is no ray indeed of the Sun, but what comes refracted to a Sun*dial*
and consequently, there is no Dial but what goes more or less false (except at
Noon in Dials that cast a Shade, where the refraction makes no variation*) But
the Refraction decreaseth apace, as the Sun gets higher, and causes a
variation of not above half a minute, at 10 degrees of the Sun's altitude;
except when the Sun is in, or near the Southern Tropic. Nearer than half a
minute, few common Sun-dials show the time. And therefore, partly for this
reason, and partly, because Mr. Flamsteed's observations reach not much
farther, I have calculated my Table to only 10 degrees.

The Table needs little explication. For having the Sun's height, you have
against it, in the next Column, the Refraction* and in the 3 next the
alterations of the hour, at 3 times of the year. Taking therefore by a Quadrant
the Sun's altitude, and observe at the same time, the hour of the day by a
Sun-dial, by the Table, you see how many minutes, and seconds, the Dial is too
fast. As at the Sunrising a Sun-dial is too fast 4. 34, about June 11, and 3.
32, about Mar. 10. and Sept. 12, and 4 38 about Dec. 11.

Addenda.
TO the Fifth part of the Rule in 6. p. 21. If you have occasion to lay the
Pinion of Report upon any other Wheel, and not the great-Wheel, you may do it
by this Rule, As the Beats in one turn of any Wheel; To the Beats in an hour::
So are the hours of the Dial; To the Quotient of the Hour-wheel divided by the
Pinion of Report.

To page 66. Suppose in altering an old Watch, you would have it show minutes,
as well as hours; you may do it thus: Divide the Beats in one turn of the
Great-wheel, by the Beats in an hour; the Quotient will show in how many hours
the Great-wheel goes round once. If the Beats in the Great wheel exceed the
Train, you must choose your Minute-wheel first, and multiply it by the Quotient;
this will give the Pin. of Report. But if the Train exceeds the Beats of the
Great-wheel, you must choose the Pin. of Rep. and multiply the Quotient by it:
the product is the Minute-wheel.

But it often falls out, that the Train and Beats of the Great-wheel will not
exactly measure one another: if so, the best way is to half the two numbers, as
far as they will equally admit of halfing; or divide them by some common
divisor, and so having brought them to as small numbers as you can, you may
suppose them to be a Wheel and Pinion, and reduce them to lesser numbers* by
Chap. 2. Sect. 2. 5. Thus suppose you would make the old dull Movement there
mentioned, a Minute-watch; you may reduce the numbers of the Great-wheel 2188^*
and the Train 9368, to a Pinion and Wheel 28) 12. Which Pin. 28 being set upon
the Spingle of the Gr. Wh. will drive a Wheel 12 round once in an hour, to show
Minutes. If you make this* Wh. 12 drive another of 48; (concentrical to which,
is a Pin. 12 driving a Wheel 36 (which Wheel is concentrical with the
Minute-wheel) this will carry a Hand round in 12 hours. But in this case, you
must place the Pin. 28 on the Spindle of the Gr. Wh. so as to slide round
stiffly, when you turn the Minutehand to rectify the Watch.
