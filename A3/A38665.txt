The ESSEX BALLAD.
To an old Tune new revived.
IN Essex much renowned for Calves,
And giving Verdicts in by halves,
For Oysters, Agues, and for Knaves
of Faction.
One Peer, and Men of Worship four,
With Gentlemen some half a score,
Did draw in ten Dutch Else of Bore
to Action
The Squire, whose Name does famous grow
As Marcus Tullius Cicero,
And keeps true Time with Sir A --
-- A --
As freely gave himself his Hand,
As once his Voice to rule the Land,
By such as should not understand
too rashly.
The Rout that erst did roar so loud;
A M -- and a H --
Are of their Choice now grown so proud,
you would wonder:
And these State-Tinkers must be sent
To stop the Leaks of Government,
Grown crazy now, and almost rent
in sunder.
His Honor first set all his Hands,
Each Members next in order stands;
The Rabble, without If's or And's,
subscratch it.
The Cause, not obsolete, though old,
Like Insects lay in Winter cold,
And warm Petitions (they were told)
would hatch it.
Corn bore a price in Cromwell's days,
Nor did we want a vent for Bays;
Nay, even Calves were several ways
advanced:
And then we feared not wicked Plots;
The Godly served to cut our Throats,
Though Agents for the Pope, as Oats
and Prance said.
Those Reasons did so much prevail,
That they petitioned Tooth and Nail,
To have the Sovereign strike Sail,
and stand by:
While the Parliament had sat some years,
To drive out Pope with Presbyters,
And try the Babylonish Peers,
and Danby.
For how can Corn and Wool be dear,
Since Popish Lords drink little Beer,
Eat Fish, and very seldom wear
our Woollen?
Nay, even their Horses are afraid
Of Treason in the Manger laid;
And the King's Evidence dismayed
their Pullen.
These Greivances, with others many,
(Too long for Ballad of a Penny)
Drove on a Herd of Clowns to any
adventure.
Those Brands, which in the days of Yore,
Uumanufactur'd Parchment bore;
And when Farms let, signed heretofore
Indenture.
In Hieroglyphick rows were set
Like Oriental Alphabet;
And least the King should quite forget
the Senate,
Their Hinds lay whip and whistling by,
Humbly to council Majesty;
And what they could not read, would try
to Pen at.
The Milk-maid hoped old comfort's in it,
Since Bodkins once did Breeches Mint,
And straight subscribed their Butter-print
to Creamer:
But these were all but single gains,
And hardly worth their toil and pains,
The Cause wants vigor, and disdains
a Dreamer.
This dallying therefore to prevent,
An Anti-popish Bull was sent,
The Emblem of the Government,
to baiting:
Where Butchers, Tinkers, Ostlers go,
Tapsters and Broom-men all a row;
And Carters for the sport left Ho
and Haiting.
The unanswerable Scotch-Cloth Men,
Taps, Sives, Chairs, and Coney-skin,
Beggars and Boys all thronged, and then
Egyptians.
This Honorable Covey met,
Hedge draws the Members Setting-Net,
And gets from all, without Regret,
Subscriptions.
When this great Council was dismissed,
They found that several Yards of Fist
Were wanting to complete the List;
and ordered,
Seven Elders to disperse the Deed,
To those of the Geneva Creed,
Brethren to such as on the Tweed
are bordered.
These trudged a Conventicling,
To pray the Lord, and beg the King,
The Congregation signed the thing
Sans Scruple
Those Scholars that could write, they bribe
To prompt and proxy every side;
And these did personally subscribe
Cextuple.
But now the time draws on apace,
And Member itches for his place,
The Knights and Gentlemen five brace
assemble:
And brought the Muster-Roll to Court,
Though Charles did hardly thank 'em for it;
But made 'em with a sharp retort
to tremble.
Now God preserve our King and Queen
From Pyebald Coats, and Ribons green;
Let neither Knave nor Fool be seen
about 'em:
And those that will not say Amen,
Let 'em Petition once again,
For every one the Shire has, ten
to rout 'em.
FINIS.
