An Examination of Several Votes of the Lords and Commons Assembled in
Parliament, concerning such as take up Arms against the Parl: of England, or
assist in such War. Wherein is declared, that all such persons are Traitors by
the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, and ought to suffer accordingly, which
the 20 of June 1648. are Ordered by the Commons Assembled in Parliament, to be
Printed and Published by the Sheriffs in every Market Town.
AMong the many irregularities of the Houses this Parliament, they have taken
up an use of printing their Votes, which though of no legal efficacy, yet
were the conduits to convey their seditious plots to the people, and prepare
them by Traitorous ifusions to assist their attempts: the force of them
dependinng on the reputation of the contrivers: and its somewhat likely that
the present Houses find some diminution of their Authority among the people,
and rely on that of their first leaders; and therefore they now the 20 of June
1648. make use of Votes made the 20 of March 1642.

It must be acknowledged that the 20 of March 1642. the People of England had a
great opinion of the Honor, Wisdom, and Integrity of the two Houses of
Parliament, upon whose words (rather then their own sense) they did believe
that there were things amiss in Government, and that from them must come the
remedy: but they long since found how far their actions and deeds differed from
their pretenses; and now the 20 of June 1648. its evident to all of the meanest
understanding, that the burdens of the people are multiplied, and that the
moderate Levies of Moneys complained of by the two Houses, to be done by the
King, in prejudice of their Liberty, are turned into intolerable exactions;
these Houses seeking not to ease any grievances, but to gain power to lay
them; and they tell the people by their Actions, that their little finger must
be heavier then the Kings Loins.

The people now see, that the reverence and zeal they bare to these Houses, was
to a false and imaginary deity; and the service they performed to them,
abominable to God, and odious to all Good men, making their sons and daughters
pass through the fire, the Subjects of England to endure all kind of misery
to please this Idol: They now see, that there is no Injustice and Oppression
equal to that of their two Houses of Parliament; their Government Arbitrary,
and their proceedings Tyranny, their pretenses Hipocrysie, their cruelties and
merciless dealings with the King and Fellow Subjects, showing them rather
inhumane Canibals then Christians; and their multiplied falseshoods and
perjuries exceeding the most professed deceivers: but it is like they think
that the Votes that deceived once, are still of force upon the people, and
therefore its necessary to discover what truth their Votes contain, that are
thus relied on after the many proofs of the uningenuity of those that contrived
them. p1 1. We observe in the Title, that the Votes have the style of the Lords
and Commons Assembled in Parliament, concerning such as take up Arms against
the Parliament of England, or assist in such War, wherein is declared, that all
such Persons are Traitors by the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, and ought
to suffer accordingly.

If the Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament, were the Parliament of
England, the style need not have been varied, but either the Votes might be
called the Votes of Parliament, or the War they mention against the Parliament,
might have been called a War against the Lords and Commons; but themselves well
know that the two Houses are not the Parliament, and then to what end are these
Votes, for they Vote not that War against the two Houses are Treason, and War
by the King against himself they intend not.

But the two Houses being (vulgarly called the Parliament) to abuse the people,
have industriously labored to implant a belief in them, that the two Houses
without the King, are the Parliament, and that there is a Majesty in it, and
Treason may be committed against it; and whatever efficacy the Acts of the
King in Parliament have, they arrogate to their own Acts without the King; and
would have all power (annexed to His Person in Parliament, and elsewhere) to
belong to themselves, without, nay, against Him, because He exercises His
Supreme, power in Parliament: Thus these vipers devour their Parent; and being
called by the King to be His Council, (which Title they assume in their
Declarations) and by the duty of their place to Council Him only, they most
Traitorously take Council against Him, and Council His people to Rebel
against Him, which is the sum of these Votes; a Treason unparalled in former
Ages, and contrary to their former professions and practice; for in all
Commissions of this Parliment, (desired by themselves for the passing of Laws)
its expressly affirmed, that no Act or Ordinance of both Houses, can binds, or
be in force without the Kings consent; and consequently can be no Act of
Parliament, nor can the two Houses in judgment of Law be the Parliament.

In their Barbarous proceedings against persons that have borne Arms against
them, they have styled their offense a Levying of War against the King; and the
attempt of Captain Burley to deliver the King out of Prison, is made by them a
Levying War against the King, well knowing there is no War else Treason by Law.
And we ask of them, whether the attempt of Sir Thomas Fairfax in removing their
Speaker Pelham, and other Members, and placing Lenthall, and others, were not a
War against the Parliament? it must needs be by their grounds, or nothing is;
for they made Orders to revoke what passed in Pelhams time, which needed not,
if it were not a Parliament in their sense; and then it must follow, that his
Excellency is a Traitor by their own rule, and themselves that assisted him.

There is no levying War, Treason, but such as is made against the King, though
it be Acted upon His Subjects in Parliament, or in any other capacity; and that
which makes a War Treason, and against the King, is the want of his Command.
Mrs. John declared in his Speech against the Earl of Strafford, that levying of
War upon the Kings Subjects is Treason, for its War against Him, and are not
they all then Traitors which made this War upon the Kings Subjects, not only
upon such as assisted the King, but Neutures? All War that is made upon his
dominions, by His Subjects without His Command, is Treason; but its a madness
therefore to say that a War by His Command is Treason, for then if He be
overcome by Rebels, such as assisted Him must be Traitors, for Levying War
upon the Kings Subjects: A senseless assertion, and would make good that scoff
at Law, that Victory only makes Traitors; an axiom never owned by Law nor
Religion, but drawn from the lewd practice of Rebels; the making of War being
the Kings peculiar prerogative, and is matter of Supreme power, not
Jurisdiction, and belongs not to any Court or Counsel, and the two Houses can
claim no more then belongs to a Court or Counsel.

The House of Commons have Ordered the printing of these Votes and it is like
they expect Obedience, as if it were an Act of Parliament, though without the
King and Lords; Never did one or both Houses of Parliament presume to print
before this, and we may as well believe they had this Privilege by the
fundamental Laws, (which was never known before these seven years last past)
as that the Lords and Commons are the whole Parliament; or that a War made by
the King can be Treason. But come now to the Votes.

The first Vote, that it appears, that the King (seduced by Wicked Council)
intends to make War against the Parliament, who in all their consultations and
actions, have proposed no other end unto themselves, but the care of Kingdoms,
and the performance of all duty and loyalty to His Person.

It seems these men had taken such pleasure in their power of judging, that
they fell to judicial Astrology, and would tell fortunes, for they adventure
to tell the intentions of their King, though Solomon says, the Kings heart is
unsearchable; doubtless in point of Duty, Subjects ought not to pry into it;
and we may surely conclude, that as they may be deceived in their conjectures
of His intentions, so they have certainly broken their Loyalty by making such a
Vote, and run into certain Rebellion upon certain suspicions; but their case
is worse, for they had resolved (before this pretense) on their violence
against the King, and had in a great part Acted it, raising Tumults against
Him, Threatening Him with popular furies, unless He consented to mischievous
Laws of their contriving; They had Levied an Army for the guarding of Persons
against an Accusation of Treason; they had caused diverse Members of both
Houses of Parliament to be assaulted and menaced, whereby they were enforced to
leave the Houses, they had seized the Navy, disposed the Militia, fortified
Towns: and now to blear the eyes of the poor multitude, tell them the King
intends to make War upon the Parliament; never King had greater cause to right
himself, nor ever people less cause to make war on him: They would persuade
the people, that if their war be defensive against their King, its lawful, and
if that they say its so, its then out of question.

If self defense be lawful in Subjects against Supreme power, then they are
not bound to assist their King against Malefactors or Rebels, unless they
first know the cause, whereby all Government is at an end, and obedience must
follow private persuasion, not public Authority; and the King does in vain
proclaim an enemy abroad, or Rebels at home, and then he cannot hope long to
wear a Crown; and if Subjects adhere to an enemy, the King may not make War
upon them, but first send for a Judge to Indite them, and a Malefactor may as
well use force against the sentence of the Judge, upon pretense of Injustice;
as Subjects against their King, upon pretense of want of just cause of making
of War, it being as essential to Supreme power (which these men swear to be
in the King) as civil decisions to any Judicatory; and if it were not (as most
certainly it is) the foundation of all Government, yet by Law, and practice
most undeniably, in the King of England; we cannot hope to find modesty, where
we see disloyalty and Rebellion, and in these men's reiterated Remonstrances,
they take it for a ground in Law, that the King cannot do evil, and if the
Law will not suppose he can do evil, can there be any Law to make War upon
Him upon pretense of doing evil? and if by the policy, and constitution of any
Kindgome the Supreme Governor be exempt from punishment by Law as of necessity
He must, it is a most absurd opinion, that He should be subject to private
violence; and if the Members of Parliament be corrupt, and entertain
negotiations with foraigne Princes, their Kings enemies, and adhere to them, as
is more then possible, and the King declare a War against such persons, may
they take Arms against Him to defend themselves? then all Rebellions will be
self defenses, and none that have force will submit to Law, and so it must
follow, that if any commit Treason, the force that the King uses for His own
preservation, or their punishment, shall be called War against the Parliament,
or War against the Subject; but when ordinary ways of Justice are shut up by
force, the King has recourse to His Regal power; and if His Counsel in such
a case should not advise Him to make War upon such persons, it might well be
judged of them, that they were an unfaithful and wicked Counsel, and though
the King had taken no resolution of War, notwithstanding the great violence
offfered Him, as He made appear by many witnesses, and reasons, yet these men
reproach Him to his face, with these Traiterous Votes, and add, that (the King
seduced by wicked Counselors) so odious an expression in the mouths and pens
of Subjects, as cannot consist with duty and Loyalty, and their professions of
their care of the Kingdoms, and performance of all duty, and Loyalty to His
Majesty's Person, so contradictory to these Votes can get no belief, but were
devised to give color only to their courses, being no part of their purposes;
and these Houses consisting of a great number, who for age, education, or
parts, being no way qualified to judge of Counsels, and being seduced by wicked
counsels to reproach their King; and seek His ruin, are no more to be trusted
for their care of the Kingdom, (which they have brought to shame, impotency,
and beggary,) then for performance of their duty to their King, whom they have
abused with all immaginable contumelies, deposed from Government, shut up in
Prison, and out of horror of their guile and fear of punishment, have plotted
how they may take away his life by poison, or assassination; and these
shameless wretches would have it believed, that making War upon Him, attempts
to kill and depose Him, imprisoning of Him, and offering of violence to His
Person, are no Treason; but that endeavoring to defend Him, free Him from
Imprisonment, preserve His life are Treason; Prodigious impudence, and they
might as well Vote He were no King, and that England never had a King by Law.

That whenever the King makes War upon the Parliament, it is a breach of the
trust reposed in Him upon His people, contrary to His Oath, and tending to the
dissolution of this Government.

Its apparent that the King may justly make War upon all or any Members of
Parliament for Disloyal and Traitorous Acts, when ordinary justice is shut up,
and that it is neither breach of trust reposed in Him by His people, contrary
to His Oath, nor tending to the dissolution of this Government; and if the King
charge either any, or all of them with such offenses, they must not stand upon
their Guard, but submit to legal Trial. Its a known truth they ought to be
Tried by the ordinary Courts of Law, and their own Votes to the contrary, have
neither weight nor credit, being against all Law, which allows not a
Malefactor to be his own judge, or to testify in his own cause. Its one of the
usual frauds of these men to weakon the opinion and duty of the people of, and
toward their King, to tax Him with a breach of Trust reposed by the People in
the King; If they should express the time when this Trust was reposed, their
answer is that it must be supposed so, when the Monarchy was first constituted;
and they speak as if all hereditary Monarchies were no other then elective, and
every of them came in upon trust. A perfidious piece of Sophistry; No doubt all
Kings have a duty to perform, and all Subjects hope and pray for their Kings
performance of it, but the constitution of hereditary Monarchies includes no
trust, but in the frame and constitution of that form of Government, and they
in the beginning could not but foresee that there might come evil Kings, yet
they resolyed not to break the order, but depended rather on Gods providence
then open a way to faction and domestic broils, which they esteemed worse
then the accidental evil of a single Prince, and which states of another
constitution often find by sad experience; and their imaginary trust has no
more ground then the prosecution of Traitors by the King has to be a breach of
it, or a War against the Parliament; There are duties of parents to children,
but they are not trusts; and in hereditary Monarchies, the King is Rex natus,
non datus, and the people cannot upon pretense of any crime precedent, refuse
their admission of Him, much less can they withdraw their obedience for any
crime subsequent; and as the Kings making War against all or any Members of
Parliament, is no War against the Parliament; so were it applicable to such a
sense, it were not contrary to any title of His Oath, when he has such cause
as was formerly expressed.

For the dissolution of Government. War by Princes against Rebels is
necessary to preserve it, but Rebellion against the King dissolves all
Government, for thereby the KING is made a Subject; all His Power despised, His
Subjects Governed by another Power, the submission whereunto is of no less
guilt, then to any foreign Power, for it is as destructive to that of the
KING'S; and we now see apparently, all Law, Liberty, and Property is lost, and
all is arbitrary at the will of Power, and no man by Law or Conscience bound to
submit to any Magistrate, whose power is derived from the KING; and it is an
odious usurpation to use a pretended derived Power, when they suppress the
supreme; and the exercise of the Sovereign power by the two Houses, making
Commissions in the KING'S Name, is all one, as if it were their own; and if it
be Murder to judge to death by Commissions in their Names, is it less when
they make a Commission in the KING'S? They cannot pretend to have any such
Power derived to them, nor can the Kingly power be possibly in the two Houses,
for they may differ in Vote, which is a condition the Kingdom cnnnot endure,
nor any Law or Reason allow; and if these men had any thought of that misery
that comes by dissolution of Government, they would not have cut assunder all
the ligaments of it, striving to get the King's consent to establish such a
confusion in this poor Kingdom, as may never be set in order in any
Generations to come; seeking to distract the Subjects, and pretend that
obedience to them, is loyalty to their KING, though it be against Him, and to
make War for the KING, equally penal to war against Him; Such as make
these Votes, and such as practice such a Power, are guilty of the breach of
Trust reposed in them by their Countries and Towns that sent them, of the Oath
of Alleagiance and Supremacy taken at their entrance into the House, of all the
blood and miseries that have insued from that damnable position and practice.

3. That whosoever shall serve or assist Him in such War, are Traitors by the
fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and have been so adjudged by two Acts of
Parliament, and ought to suffer as Traitors, 11 Ric. 2.1 Hen. 4.

And why do they not express against whom it is Treason to assist the KING?
they know there is no Treason but against the King, and if they had told all,
it must cut the throat of their Votes; That War by the KING is Treason
against the KING, which is legible only by these bloody Votes, for if the KING
have power to make War, He may judge of the cause of it; and if He err in
the justice of the cause, such as assist Him cannot be punished for doing their
duty, which is to assist Him in any War within the Kingdom, 11 Hen. 7. But
these men should have done well to have told what, or where these fundamental
Laws were, that men might see them, and not be mistaken. If the Statute of the
25 Edw. 3. be a fundamental Law, this is no Treason within that Statute. And
if 1 Mar. be a fundamental Law, nothing is Treason but what is mentioned in
that Statute of 25 Edw. 3. so as if there had been such judgment, as they
pretend, the force is wholly taken away. We may not imagine that many of these
that made these Votes understood the disserence of fundamental and not
fundamental Laws, nor that any of them knew such fundamental Laws as they
herein suppose, but it was the perfidious contrivance of some of the Leaders of
this rout, to invent words of an unknown known sense, that they might style any
actions crimes against imaginary Laws, that were done by any Persons that they
had a mind to destroy, and have thereby made the Land guilty of blood, judging
by Laws they know not, and crimes they understand not.

Martyn, Lilburne, and others, will have fundamental Law right reason, and no
reason right but their own; and its most probable, the first Inventers of this
term now in Parliament, had that reserve to their own reason, for none of the
Judges (or men learned) could ever yet find what they meant by fundamental
Laws.

But they say, it has been so judged by two Acts, of Parliament, the first is,
11 of Rich. 2.

It has happened to Parliaments in England, as is incident to all Assemblies, to
have some, whose actions are not for imitation: There are Records of disorderly
and traiterous Assemblies in Parliament, and of wicked Decrees made by them;
and no honest man will think the Judgments or Acts of Parliament in the time
of Hen. 8. touching His Wives and Children, and the many sad Executions of
Innocent persons, are of Authority; and these men have declared in this
Parliament, That they hold the Parliament that Deposed this Ric. 2. or any
other King, were no lawful Parliaments, which must be intended in regard they
were unlawfully called, or their traiterous Acts; and this Parliament of 11
Rich. 2. was assembled by a traiterous and prevailing Faction in War, as that
was, and its Authority was only Force, and its Acts dis-loyall and extorted,
and were the groundwork of the distractions of that KING'S Reign, and of His
traiterous Deposition and execrable Murder; and these Voters choose to tread in
their steps and no man may doubt if they be not prevented, will arrive to the
same end; and yet so desperate is thein case, that it cannot be maintained from
this odious example: These men having exceeded the worst of Traitors, and
though they pretend they have not yet killed their KING, it wanted not their
will, as appears by the manner of their proceedings against ROLFE, upon the
discovery of the practice against His Life.

That unhappy Prince, Rich. the 2. came young to His Crown, and was checked
and over awed by the power of His Uncles, and other great Princes of His blood,
and imbroyled with the factions of a potent Nobility, who made the then
assemblies of Parliament to act all their ambitious projects, and sorced the
KING to entrust powers to some of them, who thereby became Masters of Him, and
raised Forces against Him, and prevailed over Him; killed and destroyed diverse
of the KING'S most faithful Subjects, enfonced Him to call this Parliament of
11. and proceeded tumultuously and rebelliously in it, and threatened to Depose
the KING, unless he consented to make an Act to atteint and punish diverse men
that they accused of a Conspiracy to destroy the KING (a known untruth,) but
there is no mention that they were accused for assisting the KING, making a
War against the Parliament, there being no such case; for it were a madness
to think the KING would make a War upon the Parliament (understood the
Houses) that He could Dissolve them with His breath; nor any mention of
fundamental Laws whereby such case was Treason, so lewdly false are these Men
in their Quotations: and in the same Parliament they got likewise a general
Pardon from the KING fot their proceedings upon this reason, That it was done
for the Weal of the Kingdom, (that is in their opinions:) let any honest or
knowing man that reads those Records judge where the Treason lies, either in
these that were thus pardoned, or in others that were illegally destroyed: And
when Henry the 4. being one of the chief Conspirators against Him, and
Deposing Him, confirms in his Parliament after he had Imprisoned his lawful
KING, the acts of that lawless Parliament, no man can think it other, then a
means to assure his wicked Usurpation and former Treason, and of no more
authority, but of no use at all in the present question.

And if we had no clearer demonstrations of those men's corruptions, the use
they make of this odious example might sufficiently instruct all men of their
intentions; and the sad story of the success of that detestable usurpation may
warn us to prevent the progress of these men; for from that year of the 11
of Richard the second, the Kingdom had no rest for almost an hundred years,
constant faction among the Nobility; bloody executions of such persons as the
jealousy of the Usurper made him fear of; continual Tumults and civil
broils at home, or war abroad, and which ended not but in the final
extirpation of the numerous Male Line of our Kings, the destruction of the very
Famisies of the greatest part of the Nobility; besides, the great change that
fell on the minds of men, the Nation was grown barbarous, and the many inhumane
cruelties and injustices that daily occurred, may strike horror into any man
of Honor, Piety, or Honesty to think on such a condition, which these Voters
have in a great measure now introduced.

And for conclusion, they agree to the former Votes, and think that it is a
double testimony, as the Stature of 11 Richard the 2. and, Henry the 4. and
having served themselves of ridiculous complaints of the KING'S intentions,
rumors of jealousies and fears to begin this War upon Him, continue the
same shameless exclamations, when they have Imprisoned and Dethroned Him; and
they may as well be believed, if they Vote that the KING is not in prison, and
that they have made no War against Him, as in Voting a War against them to
deliver the KING, is a War against the Parliament. If they had made
conscience of Treason, these Votes had never been, nor this War. But they
have gotten Force, and that is their Law; however it is to be hoped, that their
Kingdom gotten by falsehood; and exercised by tyranny will end suddenly, and
then they will be as odious to themselves, as they have been insolent over
others; and as they have Cain's curse, will wish for his mark, lest every one
that meets them should prove their Executioner.
