Authority or Power (...) issue Warrants to Constables, and other Our Officers,
t^ ^vers of Our trained Bands of this Our County, and requ^ (...) to march with
their Arms, and to come into Our Town of (...) where he has disarmed diverse of
them, keeps their Arms, a^ ^arges the men: And whereas We are credibly
informed, that (...) persons, who were lately Colonels, Lieutenant-Colonels,
Captains and Officers (...) ^rayned Bands of this Our County, intend shortly to
summon, and endeavor to mus^^^ (...) ^^rces of this Our County: For as much as
by the Law of the Land, none of (...) Bands are to be raised or mustered, upon
any pretense or authority whatsoever (...) ^all VVarrant under Our own hand, or

Lieutenant or Deputy Lieutenant legally authorized to co^ the Forces and
trained Bands of this Our County of York, and the Commissions, ^and, and Power
of all Colonels, Lieutenant-Colonels, Captains and Officers of Our ^^ained
Bands,(which were derived from the Commission and Power of the Lord Lieutenant
only) are now actually void, and of no Force and Authority. Our Will and
Command therefore is, that you forthwith issue Warrants under Our Hand, to all
the late C^lonels, Lieutenant-Colonels, Captains and Officers who (whiles the
Lord Lieutenants Commission was in Force) had the command the trained Bands of
this Our County: And also to all High and Petty Constables, and other Our
Officers, in this Our County, wh^ it may concern charging and commanding them,

the Peace of this Our Kingdom, not to Must^^, Leavie, or Raise, or to Summon or
VVarn (upon any Pretense or Directions whatsoever any of Our trained Bands to
Rise, Muster, or March without express VVarrant under Our Hand, or VVarrant
from you Our Sheriff grounded upon a particular Writ to that pu^pose; which
We also command you, not to put in Execution without Our Privity and
^^^owance, whiles We shall reside in this Our County. And in case any of Our
traine^ ^ds shall rise, or gather together, contrary to this Our command, Then
We will a(...)and you to charge and require them, to dissolve and retire to
their dwellings. A^ (...) due Summons from you, they shall not lay down their
Arms, and depart to t^ (...). We will and command you, upon your Allegiance,
and as you tender the (...)d quiet of this Our Kingdom, to raise the Power of
the County, and suppress (...)e, as the Law has directed and given you Power
to do. And to the end that th^esse Command may be notified to all Our good
Subjects in this Our County, so (...) may pretend hereafter to have been misled
through ignorance; We require you (...) ^hese our Letters to be forthwith
read, and published openly in all Churches an^ (...)s in this Our County.
Herein you may not fail, as you tender the safety and h^ (...) Our Person, the
good and peace of this Our Kingdom and will answer the contra^^ (...) peril.
For which this shall be your sufficient VVarrant.

Given at our Co^^^ (...) ^^^K the fifth day of May, in the eighteenth year of
Our R^^^^ ^^^^ To Our trusty and welbeloved high Sheriff of Our County of York.
