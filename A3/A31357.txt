London, Printed by B. G. for the Company of Stationers. 1688.

An Advertisement touching Cato, and some other School-Books translated by
Charles Hool.
BEing abundantly persuaded, that the Latin tongue may as readily be attained,
as the French and other Languages are with us; or at least to a great deal more
perfection, both for speaking and writing, than commonly it is, and that also
according to our old way of Teaching, did we use such means to facilitate it as
they do in other Countries; I have seriously attended that Method, and (as God
has given opportunity) contrived sundry helps, whereby I thought I might
(probably) ease my own pains, and ready my Scholars at their Books.

And whereas I have hitherto forborne to mention the particular use of those
already published, (because I have still in mind, after some other requisites
provided, to make a full Discovery of the Art of Teaching, proceeding orderly
from the very A B C to the height of what is attainable to at a Grammar
School:) to satisfy their desires, who continually importune me to say
something here (by way of Preface) touching the course I take, and the benefit
I find in teaching this and other School-Books thus translated by me, I shall
now freely impart my School Method, so far as concerns those Books, and so
fully as is requisite by writing. And hereby, I presume, I shall neither
exasperate others, nor do prejudice to my self.

For I know very well, that the proportioning of things taught to the Learners
just capacity, and the ordering of present documents, in relation to the past
and future, so as to help the memory to retain the one, and prepare the
understanding for receiving the other; still carrying on his affections to
covet more, is a mere slight, and yet a Masterpiece in our Profession: Which
indeed it is very difficult to discourse on, if not impossible to discover.
Because (as I conceive) this Ars infundendi is continually attended with so
many Circumstances, and requires such prudential considerations, as none can
possibly observe and think on, but those that are very circumspect and
assiduous in a long continued Practice. Scire quid deceat, est caput artis,
quod nulla art docetur, is very true in School teaching.

When a Child therefore is, 1. So well acquainted with his entrance into the
Latin Tongue, as that he can tell you (according to his rudiments, or Grounds
of Grammar) what part of Speech any word is, what are its Accents, and with
what it agrees, or by what it is governed according to Rule. 2. When he can
decline any Noun, and form any Verb, and render the Rule of the Genders of the
one, and of the Praetertense and Supines of the other, out of Propria quae
maribus, Quae Genus, and As in Praesenti. 3. When by the daily use of his
Vocabulary, and Phrases, he has a good stock of proper words, and neat
expressions, so as plausibly to deliver himself upon any familiar occasion. 4.
When he has been exercised a while in construing, parsing, altering, and
imitating the Collections out of the lowest School-Authors, and can do it
Grammatically, though not altogether so exquisitely, as may be expected and
attained to by after practice. 5. When he can read either English or Latin
pretty distinctly, and can frame to write truly and legibly, and to keep his
books fair: Then let him take an easy progress in the same Language by the
help of his Latin Grammar, and the Authors already provided him; after this
Method.

1. Let him, together with his Sententiae Pueriles, procure himself a little
Paper book of the same bigness, and handsomely ruled; in which let him every
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in the forenoon (after he has read two or three
Verses in the Latin Testament, and repeated his Grammar part.) 1. Write down
half a Page of the Sentences both English and Latin according to the Printed
Copy, and get them by Heart, as he writes them, which will cause him to be
more intent upon the matter, and to write more truly and leisurely. 2. Let him
repeat so many of them as he is well able (without tiring his memory) by heart,
out of his own written Copy, and construe them likewise memoriter, sometimes
out of English into Latin, and sometimes out of Latin into English. 3. Let him
parse as many Sentences as the time and your leisure will permit you to hear;
and be sure he decline those Nouns, and form those Verbs through, which seem
more difficult, and inform him touching what Rule you know he is not so well
acquainted withal in his Grammar, or which he does not so well understand, and
let him turn to it. For this purpose he should always bring his Grammar with
him, when he comes to say his Lesson. 4. Show him how to imitate or vary one
of those Sentences, and then cause him to write it down, taking special heed to
the placing of his Latin words in the Latin order. Ex. gr. When he has said
Grammatically, i. e. as our words stand in English.

Opitulare amicis. Be helpful to thy friends.

Let him change some accidents of the words thus,

Opitulabor amico. I will help my friend.

Afterward let him imitate it, by altering some of the words, and keeping the
construction in the Latin order, thus;

Amicis opitulare. Help thy friends. Miseris opituletur Deus. God help poor
folks. Sociis nostris opitulabimur. We will help our fellows.

Then help them to understand and remember it, by showing them how to return an
answer in the same case that the Question is made in, as.

Q. Quibus opitulaberis? R. Amicis.

Q. Whom will you help? A. My friends.

And in the same Mood and Tense.

Q. Amicis tuis quid debes facere? R. Opitulari.

Q. What ought thou to do to thy friends? A. To help them.

On Mondays and Wednesdays in the afternoons (after the Vocabula' s repeated)
let a Boy 1. Transcribe out of Cato into a paper Book provided for that
purpose, two or three Distichs Latin and English; and as he writes them, let
him get them by heart, and afterward rehearse them so, according to his
written copy: 2. Let him construe them word by word memoriter (and to help him
in so doing, let him make use of Cato Grammatically construed) and parse them
according to the grammatical order. 3. Let him oppose every Lesson by way of
Question and Answer both English and Latin, which he should thus write down in
two columes in a little Book, ex. gr. out of the first Distioh.

Q. What is God? Quid est Deus? A. A Spirit. Spiritus. Q. How know you that?
Unde id scis? A. Verses tell me so. Sic dicunt carmina. Q. How is God then to
be worshipped? Quommodo ergo colendus est Deus? A. With a pure mind. Purd
mente.

And then 4. Let him give you the sense of the Distich thus;

God, who is a Spirit, is chiefly to be worshipped of us, and that with a pure
mind.

Deus, qui est Spiritus, a nobis precipue and pura mente colendus est.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays in the afternoons let Children learn to talk with
one another according to the expressions they meet with in Pueriles
Confabulatiunculae, and Corderius' s School-Colloquies thus: 1. Let them
construe a Colloquy, or more verbatim. 2. Cause them to analyze exactly (at the
least) one, of every part of Speech in it, and to deeline a Noun, and conjugate
or form a Verb thorowout. 3. Let them take a Clause or a whole Sentence, and
alter it quite to another meaning by other words placed in the same order that
those are in the Book, 4. Let them try who can say the most part of a Colloquy
by heart, and see how well they can imitate it. 5. Let them frame a Colloquy of
their own in English, and turn it into Latin, marking according to the figures
of their Books, the page or Colloquy and line, where the words and Phrases, or
Sentences they make use on, are to be found, especially if they be such as they
seldom meet withal.

But however, Let them have a paper Book, wherein the Grammar Rules are
written, after the manner of commonplace heads, and ever as they find examples
in these Authors answering their Rules, let them write them down under them.
Let them likewise have a book for Phrases, Alphabetically contrived, wherein
they may write down such elegancies as are worthy the present noting, and of
which they may come to make use of at another time. The benefits that accrue to
Children by thus canvasing these lesser Authors, are extraordinary; For, 1. It
bettereth them in reading either English or Latin. 2. It teaches them
Orthography, and fair writing. 3. It makes them rightly to understand what they
Learn, and easily to remember it, by presenting every thing to the Fantasy as
well by the eye as by the ear, and imprinting them fast upon the memory by an
earnest intention and reiteration. 4. It not only helps them to construe
surely, and with confidence, and 5. To parse readily any word in their lesson
(which are things merely Grammatical;) but also 6. Instructs them in the
Moral part of Learning, both how to behave themselves, and to speak as those of
better breeding. For it makes the matter, words, and Phrases in every lesson
their own, and stores them with Copy and Variety of both, to use upon any
occasion. And this is it which Mr. Brinsley truly calls the very picking out of
the kernel, and the life of every Lecture.

Now for the translating of these books, to the end they might be thus improved
to the Childrens greater advantage, I conceived there was to me a necessity so
to do, if I meant at all to use them, as (I observe) the generality of
Schoolmasters have done both here and beyond the Seas for many years, and some
Ages together.

1. In regard the parties to whom they are commonly taught are but little ones,
of about seven or eight years old, who are not so well able to apprehend terms
of Art, and digest Rules; as to imitate, remember, and repeat the forms of
Speech in any Language; whereof; when they have gained some knowledge, the
Rules may be better instilled into them by informing them in a Practical way,
why they said thus and thus, and directing them withal, how to say the like,
when they are put to it.

2. A Book altogether Latin is (as I may term it) a mere Barbarian to our
Children, that are ignorant in the tongue, and therefore know not one word in
the Book what it means, further than it is told them. Hence comes it to
pass, that when the Master, or (as in many Schools) a boy takes upon him to
interpret a place in an Author, and to tell Children verbatim what it means
(though never so distinctly and twice or thrice over) the work of Construing
proves so elaborate, that they can receive but a very little at one Lesson,
whereas the more one hears or reads of any language, and the oftener he meets
with the words and phrases in it (so he do but well understand what they mean)
the more apt he is to remember them, and the sooner and the surelier to attain
the Tongue. Moreover a Book only Latin, presents in it many things to be
considered at once (and the most of them beyond a Boys apprehension) before one
can understand it; viz. the proper and then the tropical signification of the
words, and which of many is to be used in each particular place. 2. How the
words are to be transprosed from the Rhetorical to a Grammar order. 3. How
every Elegancy and Phrase is to be rendered according to the natural Idiom. 4.
How the Sentence or Speech does hang together in our language, so as to express
the same sense that it bears in Latin: For the pondering of all which, a young
Learner had need to be helped by having the languages set down as they answer
one another, that thereby he may be able to compare them both together, and
express the one by the other, giving to each its due propriety.

3. Because the profession of a Latin Schoolmaster is to teach the Latin
tongue, and not the Grammar only (which is but an introduction to it) and
experience tells us that no language is more readily got than by familiar
discourse in it, and ability therein is no way sooner gained than by comparing
the tongue we learn with that we know, and asking how they call this, or how
they say that in another language, which we are able to express in our own.

4. The having of these first Books merely Latin, seemed a main cause why
Children made so little progress in them, and with so little benefit or
pleasure. For commonly they peruse not above six or seven leaves in some one of
those Authors, not regarding them further, than to construe or parse their
present Lesson, which they seldom do as they ought, because they do not well
understand them, whereas by having them in English and Latin together, they
will run their Books two or three times through, and readily perform any task
their Masters shall impose upon them.

5. Whereas many that had tasted the sweat of their own labors, and were free
in imparting it to others, had formerly translated certain School-Books (by
which many hundreds that have industriously used them to help themselves, and
others, in the Latin, have received much benefit.) I observe the present rarity
of such Books had made them excessive dear, and therefore conceived it
requisite to make them more common; and that both the English an Latin might be
had under one, I have set them down constantly together.

6. This, I conceive, is the surest (if not the only) way to avoid. Anglicisms,
and other Barbarisms which are incident to Children in making Latin, For where
a Rule many times cannot be had to direct them, nor their Dictionaries be able
to supply them with words and phrases, their Authors may. And it is undoubtedly
better for a Child to learn to speak well at the first, than after he has got
an habit of Bald, duncical Latin (as they call it) by attending only the Rules,
to be first made to unsay it, and then to express it better, as his Author has
done.

7. I might allege further, that these manner of Translations may prove
beneficial, though not so necessary altogether, to many at riper years, as well
as to little boys, viz. 1. To the weaker sort of Country School Masters, that
have no supply of Books, who may hence gain the true construction of a place
which seems doubtful, obscure, or erroneous. 2. To young Students, who come not
perfectly grounded to the Universities, as it is meet, who by using Books
translated may attain a Copy of proper Language, without trusting too much to
Dictionaries, which do oft-times fail, if not deceive them. 3. To those that
have lost their Latin Tongue, and would recover it by their own industry. And
lastly to them, that after a little insight into it, having no other means to
increase it but by these Books, which do serve, upon my knowledge, to many
instead of private Teachers, and are affectual, with a little direction now and
then, when the Learner finds himself at a loss.

Touching the manner of Translating, I observe Many Men, many Minds, and
therefore there are many Methods or ways taken by many. Some set down the
English only, as Mr. Brinsley; some the English and Latin together, and that
word by word, as Mr. Hain; or clause by clause, as Dr. Web; or speech after
speech, as Mr. Bernard. For my part, I have observed that course which I found
most agreeable to my Scholars apprehensions, which I see also taken by the
French, Dutch, and other School masters in foreign parts, who do certainly
sooner gain the Latin Tongue by admitting these helps, than we that abandon
them in England. I have endeavored to frame my English style to the Latin, so,
as at once to reach the Authors true meaning, and to condescend to the capacity
of a young Learner. As for rendering of words Grammatically, I have sometimes
done it, where other words would have seemed to carry the child too far aside.
Sometimes I have purposely set down the sense of the Latin, as we express it in
English discourse, that a child may thereby be enforced more diligently to
search out his way of Construing. And I find that children which have been
exercised in Vocabularies and Grammar-Rudiments, will in a very short time be
able to construe Grammatically of themselves, because the sense, and Grammar
order, and knowledge of the words before hand, direct them very readily to what
they would say, and they quickly recall their own errors. I have therefore
taken the most care to make our English answer the Latin in its propriety of
Words and phrases. For, To render the Latin word for word, would seem too harsh
in our English tongue, which would sometimes scarce be understood to be
English, and children are short of Judgment, how to give the right
significations of Words: especially where the matter is not familiar unto them,
which I conceive to be the main reason why so many have rejected these more
ancient and first School-Books, especially of late years, and since our
Children are put to Latin so early. Where places admit of a double sense I have
followed that which in the judgment of Commentators upon that place, seems
the most natural, and where they admit sometimes of a double Text, I have made
the Construction also double. The elegances that occur more remarkable, I have
caused to appear by the change of the Letter in the print, and the Sentences
are pointed at with this mark I have commonly rendered you for thou, or thee,
because our children are generally now taught to say so (especially in common
discourse) for manners sake. For quid me tuissas? is every bodies reply now a
days, to whom do we say thou, except he be much our inferior, though Erasmus
was very angry with all such in his time as would not endure to be thou would.

Some School Masters there are, very eminent for their excellent abilities, and
long experience (and such whose Persons I acknowledge my self much bound to
reverence (that because of some suspected inconveniences) are utterly averse to
all manner of Translations of School Books. Now I entreat these more seriously
(and in friendly manner as I study to write this) to consider, whether more
benefit has not commonly redounded to Schools where Translations have been
used, than where they are totally excluded? I mean so as to make the Scholars
learn more cheerfully, and the Masters to teach more comfortably.

1. Seeing it is manifestly apparent, that since Mr. Hayn put out the
Construing Book, the Grammar has been sooner and more profitably learned by
the generality of Children under ten, than ever it was before, by here and
there a youth near twenty years old. And tho the most School masters at its
first coming up, exclaimed against it, and with all strictness forbid it to
come within their Schools, yet the help it did to children at home and
underhand, toward the performance of their tasks, and the ease that Masters
found in having their children prepared aforehand for their Lessons, has so
far convinced men, and prevailed, that a million (I believe) of those Books
have been sold; and that which we call Lillies Grammar is now seldom bought
without a Construing Book, to explain its meaning.

2. We see it evidently, that the Greek tongue has been more generally
studied, and more easily attained, and that to a great deal more perfection
than formerly, both at Universities, and elsewhere, since all those Orators,
Poets, Histories, Fathers, (and what not) have been translated into Latin.

3. The Practice of some Masters that make use of Interliniaries for
themselves, whereby they learn the Eastern Languages (not to speak of their
Construing the French or Spanish Bibles by the help of an English one) may
excuse their Scholars; and convince them, that Translations may as well be
allowed to Children as Men. If they say Boys must work it out by their own
selves, I may reply, that they have neither that strength of judgment, nor
aptness to devise ways (whereby to help themselves at a loss) that men have
and therefore should not be left (as commonly they are) to shift for themselves
more than Men would be.

4. I think it as profitable for a Child, having had his Lesson once construed
to him (or not at all) to learn how to construe perfectly by a book, as by his
Masters often telling him, who (perhaps) sometimes chides him because he does
no better remember. And the poor boy therefore, to fasten it the better in his
memory by the sense, makes use of his own weak shifts, to scribble the word
(which he conceives, but is not yet sure) his Master told him, in the margin
of his book. I am sure it is more encouragement to the Scholar to know where to
help himself, and less trouble to the Master that he can do as well without
him: Not to say, that it conduces something to the fairer keeping of their
books. What need I care what way my Scholar con his lesson, so he can say it
truly? The easiest way for himself to learn, is the acceptablest way for me to
teach him by; and the most profitable doubtless to us both, if it be constantly
followed to the gaining of an habit.

Now whereas it is objected, that Translations in a School, are means to beget
and maintain, 1. Idleness in the Master; and 2. Truantliness in Scholars; I
answer,

1. I observe them that commonly make this objection, to be conversant rather
in teaching Scholars that are toward maturity, both of age and learning, than
in entering little Ones into a tongue, whereof they know nothing, however
therefore with them there be no need of such mean Subsidiaries as these, yet
with others there may.

2. This objection is but a groundless suspicion of theirs that have never made
use of them; which till they do, they can never certainly say what
conveniences, or inconveniences attend them. In the mean time their Opinions
are no infallible proofs, and I will not take upon me to refute them; being not
desirous to impose upon any man, either in matter of judgment or practice.

3. But this I can confidently say (now near upon 20 years experience in this
Calling, as well publicly as privately) 1. That a Master, whose own eyes ought
to be his constant and best Monitors among his Scholars, shall not want
employment, were his work made never so easy to his hand, to see that Children
do orderly behave themselves, and diligently perform their tasks within their
limited times. 2. Though Translations do make the Master's work in teaching a
great deal more easy, because Children, with a little of his direction, may be
able by their help to construe and parse their Lessons; yet does it not
therefore follow, that by them he has nothing left him to do: for it is some
work to hear, and instruct, and examine his Scholars, in repeating their tasks
(though they be never so well prepared, and ready in saying;) and if, because
they can say readily, he dispatch them the sooner, he may take the opportunity
to show them how to observe, imitate, or make use of the passages in their
lessons; and by thus doing, he shall improve their knowledge, both for
behavior and language. And indeed, this is the end of all our learning, that
we may know and do our duty both to God, our selves, and other men, and
persuade those men with whom we converse to do so too.

4. Those Helps are so far from making Children any way to truant it that they
exceedingly increase in them a desire to their Books, and make them continually
(in School time at the least) to busy themselves about them. For, 1. They take
away those dulling disheartnings, that do usualy befall Children (when they are
put to get a Lesson, the meaning whereof they do not well understand: who, when
others forbear to tell them, and their own contrivances to help themselves
fail, do presently despair of what they are about, and look no further after
it. 2. The writing, imitating examining, and doing other things for the
improvement of their lessons, will afford them little time to be idle; whereas
when Boys have no more to do but that every days work of construing and
parsing, they spend little or no time in looking after it, but either betake
themselves to some busy chat, or foolish pastime, or (which is worse) sit
sottishly idle in the School or slip out at the door, and there they do
emanare, tarry forth (which is properly to truant it) if they do not withal
commit some egregious misdemeanour or other. 3. One may imagine that a lothness
rather to undergo the burden of reading so many exercises as Children can
readily perform by help of these Translations, and a little direction of the
Master now and then, should incline many Masters to neglect them, than any fear
of having too little to do in a Calling so every way cumbersome and full of
toil. But for the trouble of reading Exercises a discreet Master can devise
better ways, how to help himself in it than I can at this time stand to
prescribe.

5. Let who will object further what they please to imagine against it, so long
as we see this course (which I use in private, and do now commend to the
public) of teaching language by language, as well as by Grammar rules, is that
which they take for the most part in all places beyond the Seas, and by which
they out strip us in Latin. And no wise man will be angry to see English Boys
have as easy Helps for the Latin, as these commonly have in foreign parts:
seeing our Language has very little nearness to the Latin whereas others of
most use and eminency with us, (i. e. the French, Spanish, and Italian) seem
wholly to be bred out of that tongue now corrupted.

6. My intentions are not to fill the Schools (as some are merrily said to have
done the world) with Translations; but only by the helps of some few selected
ones to bring on the younger sort of School boys, in Grammatical Exercitations,
and getting Language, till they be able to help themselves in the purest Latin
Authors. And this, I conceive, they will readily do, after they have run over
(besides the Books already mentioned) Aesop's Fables, Terence, and a competent
number of select Epistles: all which I have now in hand, and endeavor (as God
affords me opportunity) to finish, according to my agreement with the Company
of Stationers.

It would be tedious to my self, and Reader, to continue a discourse touching
the Author of this Book of Distichs, as 1. To dispute whether Cato major or
Cato minor, or Valerius Cato the Grammarian, might not have been Authors of it.
Or 2. To enquire the reasons, why some have fathered it upon Seneca, some upon
Chrysostom, and others upon Ausonius. Or 3. To determine which of these three
was its ancientest and justest title, viz. Ethica Catonis, Tullius de
Praeceptis Catonis (whereby some have thought Tully composed it,) or Libellus
elegantissimus qui inscribitur Cato. Or 4. To censure with Erasmus and Scaliger
that this Book was called Cato, because it has in it Sentences worthy of Cato,
or is able to make one that observes them, a wise and well behaved man, as Cato
was.

I shall only say, that this Book has been every where approved on, and taught
in Schools and all Countries for these many Ages together, insomuch, as
Planudes turned the Distichs into Greek, Erasmus made Scholia's, and others
before him had written Commentaries upon them. Corderius for his own ease and
Scholars benefit construed them in French, and some (about 70 years since)
converted his construction into English. Sir Rich. Baker, J. P. and sundry
others, have rendered them in English verse: So that I shall neither seem to
introduce a new Author, or to bring any uncouth device into our Schools, if for
the sweetning of this Poet, and that children may more easily digest it, I take
the like course that others of greater worth have done before me.

Those arguments (I confess) which Mr. Mulcaster and some others have used
against this Book, (and this chiefly, that it was too serious for little Ones
that mind nothing beyond their toys,) did much sway me to forbear the use of it
in my School, till both by turning it into an easy English verse (as near as
might be to the Latin) and construing it verbatim in an Interlineary way, I had
rendered it more suitable to their apprehensions. And now they sometimes delight
both me and themselves, in striving who can repeat the most Distichs both
English and Latin by heart, after they have writ them fair (as I have said) in
Paper Books. Corderius in one of his Colloquies brings in some of his Scholars
thus exercising themselves and vying memories. What I have hitherto done, or
intend (by Gods blessing) further, in facilitating the way of teaching, was
occasioned by my own private endeavors to bring on Children in a cheerful and
continued exercise of reading, writing and speaking the Latin tongue, as well
as English, and to acquaint them all along (according to the pitch of their
capacity) with the Rules of Grammar, letting them see how far both languages
agreed in that Art, and wherein they differed. And this I dare thus publicly
aver upon trial, that whereas (especially since I have got those Helps printed)
I am constant to my Rule, (Which of late I have observed to de enjoined by Chr.
Helvicus) never to whip a Boy for his Book, or (as my Tutor once advised me)
not to punish a Child for his intellectuals, though I seldom let voluntary
misdemeanors in point of manners go unpunished (especially where I meet with a
stubborn Spirit,) I rarely have a Child come to me that does not studiously
attend his learning, and after a while make show of profit.

And again, whereas I had formerly framed my Method so, as I usualy saved one
year in seven of what I knew others commonly spent; I have sensibly of late
gained upon my self, so as to gain one of three, of what I have spent
heretofore. Nay further, where I have to do with those of riper years, whose
abilities and occasions require more expedition, and less attendance, I do
constantly undertake in six Months to make them intelligibly to peruse any
ordinary Latin Author, and to give the Grammatical reasons for what they read:
and I bless God, I failed in performance with none that have carefully attended
their appointed hours, which is once in two days to receive directions, and
employ their spare time accordingly. The main thing to be required either from
Children, or men of years, is a willing mind to be taught, and an attentive
ear. Parents therefore might do very well, when they bring their sons to the
School, either to engage for their quiet demeanor there, or to leave the Master
to his power to command it, or (at least) to forbear such expressions of
indulgency as may encourage them to rudeness beyond control.

I have wondered to hear that some of our Profession should blame others, for
going about by these means to prostitute learning, and to make the way of
knowledge too common a thing, which in my judgment is impossible. For, let the
way be never so easy, all will not desire. to go it, and if one should begin
never so early, and proceed never so fast, in a way of learning, it would be
with him as it is with other Travelers, who when they have once come whether
the Earth and Sky seemed in their eyes to meet, they find the Heavens as high
as formerly it was above them, and that meeting (as some rudely call it) of the
Earth and Element, to be still as far as they can ken before their face: And
the wisest man a live will ingeniously confess (as wiser men than he, perhaps,
have done before him) that all the little which he knows, is nothing in
comparison to that infiniteness of things whereof he is ignorant. Besides, were
the Art of School teaching never so common, there are Children enough (but
especially in London) to be taught and it is work for more than one man to
reduce our corrupted nature to good order. For my part, I have often wished,
that all Parents were able to teach their own children; for then they would
either ease Schoolmasters by setting their work more forward, as sometimes
they do their servants, or more liberally reward their pains, that diligently,
and faithfully perform their trust, in a thing of such concernment, and wherein
themselves have no judgment.

I know it is with Books, as with dishes at a Table, where every one tastes
what he best likes, and some prefer mere Kick-shaws before solid meats. I ever
liked that free law of hospitality, viz. Every Man what he pleases; and
therefore amongst others I only present my dish, and press it upon no man's
stomach. And forasmuch as I neither oppose nor prescribe to others, I hope none
will trouble themselves to oppose, or detract from me, but either heartily
censure what I thus freely communicate, or commit their misdoings to the common
test.

It is God I serve in what I do, and my Country that I desire to benefit; and
as I repose my self securely upon God, in assurance of his protection, so I
hope none of my Countrymen will envy or malign my undertakings. But if any man
do so, I account Gods amiable countenance, and the encouragement I receive from
men of known integrity, and learning, to have far more force to bear up my
spirits, than their cavils can be to deject them. And now, whether I seem to
have said too much, or too little of this subject, I forbear more than to say,

Mr. Triplet's Opinion touching those Translations.
SIR,
It Is true, that Translations of School Authors are excepted against by many
persons of Learning and Judgment, as conducing to promote Truantry in Children,
who are forward enough to learn with as much ease as they can, and delight not
in any thing that exacts any pains at their hands. But as some would not swim
at all, if they were not first entered with bladders; so many would not so much
as think of wading in the Latin Tongue, if they were not brought on with such
facile Manuductions as these.

Since I have rolled this stone, I can upon good experience say, that I have
good cause to thank you for your pains in this kind: For what between dullness
on the one side, and laziness on the other, I should not have made so great a
progress in many under my charge, had not your smoothing the way, thus invited
us to pass on.

And if the Master please, these Translations may prove mere Helps and no
truantly refuges: When he does not content himself with the Child's answer,
simply as it lies in the Book, but by varying Genders, Numbers, Voices,
Persons, Moods, Tenses, etc. does so Grammatically Catechize and instruct his
Scholar, that by every Sentence which you have translated, he is able to make
such another; and perhaps the Child that is thus taught, may sooner learn to go
a high lone, than he that is taught, to go without a standing-stool.

This is my Opinion, I will not call it Judgment, for fear of offending them
that judge against it. The truth thereof I submit to the wise. This truth I am
pretty sure of, that I am,

Hayes, June 25. -- 53. Sir, Your affectionate Friend and Lover, THO. TRIPLET.

The first Book of Cato's Distichs concerning Manners.

Let him with upright mind be served by thee.

For daily rest affords to vices growth.

He Is next to God, that can hold's tongue with reason:

Who falls out with himself, with none can 'gree.

Whilst they blame others, none without fault live.

Safety sometimes to wealth preferred must be.

For wise men without blame often change their mind,

Of servants: Whom thou love she often disdains.

Yet if you love him, in your way proceed.

All men can speak, but few are truly wise.

Be good to good men, but not to thy cost.

Silence hurts none, but some for words are blamed.

Faith is but rare, because words are so free.

Touching thy self, and do not others trust.

But nothing say, when thou thy self do well.
16 Whilst, now grown old, men's words and deeds you scan,
Think what you did your self, being a young man.

They think all said of them that guilty are.

The end not always like beginning is.

Hope not for dead-mens shoes that may outlive thee.

Accept it well and highly it commend.

The weight of poverty take in good part.

He that fears death, loses even that he lives.

Do not blame God therefore, but calm thy spirit.

And that thou may save, think thou have it not.

Lest, whilst thou would seem kind, thou do prove light.

Do thou the like; th^s Art is mocked by Art.

The pipe sounds sweetly whilst the bird is taking.

Then bring them up to Trades, that they may live.

So shall thou neither base, nor griping seem.

When his fault checks him, it is the Teachers shame.

Its fond to ask what it is just to deny.

Known things on judgment rest, unknown on chance.

Do thou that labour'st, count each day for gain.

For friends are won by fair compliancy.
35 Fear not small things to give for further ends:
For favor by this means uniteth friends.

Anger breeds hatred; concord maintains love.

So temper, as to strike them you seem loath.

Patience a virtue is exceeding great.

Want will increase, where labor makes no gains,

Be still a friend unto thy self most near.
Catonis Distichorum de moribus Liber Primus.

Hic tibi praecipue sit pura mente colendus.

Nam diuturna quies vitiis alimenta ministrat.

Proximus ille Deo, qui scit ratione tacere.

Conveniet nulli, qui secum dissidet ipse.

Cum culpent alios, nemo sine crimine vivit.

Utilitas opibus praeponi tempore debet.

Temporibus mores sapiens sine crimine mutat.

Saepe etenim mulier, quem conjux diligit, odit.

Si tibi sit charus, noli desistere coeptis.

Sermo datur cunctis, animi sapientia paucis.

Sic bonus esto bonis, ne te mala damna sequantur,

Nam nulli tacuisse nocet, nocet esse locutum.

Para sides ideo est, quia multi multa loquuntur.

Plus aliis de te, quam tu tibi, credere noli.
Officium alterius multis narrare memento:
Atque aliis cum tu benefeceris, ipse sileto.
16 Multorum dum facta, senex, and dicta recenses,
Fac tibi succurrant, juvenis quae feceris ipse.

Cotiscius ipse sibi de se putat omnia dici.

Non eodem cursu respondent ultima primis.

In morte alterius spem tu tibi ponere noli.

Accipito placide, plene and laudare memento.

Paupertatis onus patienter far memento.

Qui mortem metuit, quod vivit, perdit id ipsum.

Incusare Deum noli, sed te ipse coerce.

Utque, quod est, serves; semper tibi deesse putato.

Ne sis ventosus, dum vis urbanus haberi.

Tu quoque fac simile: sic ars deluditur art.

Fistula dulce canit, volucrem dum decipit auceps.

Instrue, quo possint inopem defendere vitam.

Sic tibi nec parcus, nec avarus habeberis ulli.

Turpe est doctori, cum culpa redarguit ipsum.

Nam stultum petere est, quod possit jure negari.

Cognita judicio constant, incognita casu*

Pro lucro tibi pone diem, quicunque laboras*

Obsequio quoniam dulces vincuntur amici.
35 Ne dubites cum magna petas, impendere parva:
His etenim rebus adjungit Gratia charos

Ita odium generat, concordia nutrit amorem.

Ipse tibi moderare tuis ut parcere possis.

Maxima enim morum semper patientia virtus.

Cum labor in damno est, crescit mortalis egestas.

Cum fueris felix, semper tibi proximus esto.
The Second Book of Cato's Distichs concerning Manners.
THE PREFACE.
IF thou perchance, would learn the ground to till,
Read Virgil; but if you desire good skill,
In Herbals, Macer them in verse will show,
If Roman Civil Wars fain you would know,
Lucan peruse, who tells you all those fights:
If you delight in love and wanton sights,
Run Ovid over. But if your mind be set,
Above all worldly things Wisdom to get;
Hear, and attend, that you may better note,
How one may lead a life from vice remote.
Then come, and (lest you go too far amiss)
Learn here by reading what true wisdom is.

By due deserts is better than to reign.

Forbear; being mortal, mortal things desire.

Thr^ring death, not one good day to see.

Wrath keeps the mind that truth it cannot see.
5 Slack not to spend, when a just cause desires:
We must be somewhat free, when time requires.

The ship rides safest in a little stream.

Lest many blame, what thou dislik'st alone.

For sins are sometimes hid, and sometimes plain;

Whom Nature has made weak, she makes more wise.

We see the conquered often the Victor beat.

The greatest strife does often from least words grow.

He knows without thee what to do with thee.

Which, if it do not hurt, is hard to bear.

Who gets by unjust doom, never joys it long,

Who rakes up discord, shows a bad condition.

Whom glory vain does vex, fools do the same.

What has been long a getting, quickly ends.

Folly to counterfeit becomes the wise.

For to thy credit they are contrary.

Small heed is given to them that often prate.

The fault is not the Wines, but you abuse it.

With a good Doctor trust thy bodies cure.

Fortune smiles on them to their greater fall.
24 Foresee to bear such things on thee may light:
An evil hurts less by good foresight.

Keep hope; hope never leaves men, no, not dead.

Time has a lock before, but's bald behind.

In this like Janus, that looks two ways, be.

We owe more to our health, than to our pleasure.

Lest whilst thou slightest many, thou please none.

Blame not the times, when thou work'st thine own grief.

When they are awake, they hoping in sleep see.

PRAEFATIO.
TElluris si forte velis cognoscere cultum,
Virgilium legito: quod si mage nosse laboras
Herbarum vires, Macer tibi carmine dicet:
Si Romana cupis, vel civica noscere bella,
Lucanum quaeras, qui Martis Praelia dicet:
Si quid amare libet, vel discere amare legendo,
Nasonem perito: sin autem cura tibi haec est,
Ut sapiens vivas, audi, quo discere possis
Per quae semotum vitiis traducitur aevum:
Ergo ades, and quae sit sapientia disce legendo.

Utilius regno, meritis acquirere amicos.

Cum sis mortalis, quae sunt mortalia cura.

Dum mortem metuis, demittere gaudia vitae,

Impedit ira animum ne possit cernere verum.
5 Fac sumptum propere, cum res desiderat ipsa:
Dandum etenim est aliquid, cum tempus postulat, aut res.

Tuta mage est puppis, modico quae flumine fertur.

Ne plures culpent id, quod tibi displicet uni.

Temporibus peccata latent, and tempore patent.

Consilio pollet, cui vim natura negavit.

Victorem a victo superari saepe videmus.

Lis minimis verbis interdum maxima crescit.

Quid statuat de te, sine te, deliberat ipse.

Quae si non laedit, tamen hanc sufferre molestum, est.

Nemo diu gaudet, qui judice vincit inique.

Post inimicitias iram meminisse malorum est.

Hoc faciunt stulti, quos gloria vexat inanis.

Labitur exiguo, quod partum est tempore longo,

Stultitiam simulare loco prudentia summa est.

Crimen avaritiae: nam sunt contraria famae.

Exigua iis tribuenda fides, qui multa loquuntur.

Nam nullum crimen vini est, sed culpa bibentis.

Corporis auxilium medico commit fideli.

Indulget fortuna malis, ut laedere possit.
24 Prospice qui veniunt hos casus esse ferendos:
Nam levius laedit quicquid provideris ante.

Spem retine: spes una hominem nec morte relinquit.

Front capillata, post est occasio calva.

Illum imitare Deum, qui partem spectat utramque.

Pauca voluptati debentur, plura saluti.

Ne nulli placeas, dum vis contemnere multos.

Tempora ne culpes, cum sis tibi causa doloris.

Cum vigilat, sperans per somnum cernit id ipsum.
The third Book of Cato's Distichs Concerning Manners.
THE PREFACE.
REader, if thou this verse away would bear,
These Rules of living well, be sure to hear.
With learning store thy mind, cease not to learn;
Without it none can life from death discern.
Thou shall get good by it: But if thou it scorn,
Thou make thy self, not me that writes, forlorn.

It is not in your power their tongues to sway.

Hide thy friends faults (yet play the honest man.)

Plain truth is sound, but lies deceitful are.

Grows faint, though idleness, the body's pined.
5 Mirth with thy labor sometimes put in ure,
That better thou may thy labor endure.

Lest some thus scoff at thee another day.

Keep and increase, lest thou a byword be.

Live frankly, and be free to every friend.

Scorn no man's judgment, so that it be right.

Yet see thou live content with present store.

Nor care to keep her if she fall to strife.

Or do; another life is our best guide.

Lest, over-prest with the work, thou leav't with scorn.

Lest thou be thought like them, thou wilt not reveal.

For Laws themselves would fain be ruled by right.

And being guilty, be thy proper Judge.

Poets, not to be trusted, wonders feign.

A tatler, whilst thou would, be civil famed

When women would deceive, they shed a tear.

Who waste their own, would others spend as fast.

Which though not good it self, ends all that is bad.

For not to bear, but brawl, is bad in thee.

To please thy Father, do not cross thy Mother.
Catonis Distichorum de Moribus Liber Tertius.
PRAEFATIO.
HOC quicunque velis carmen cognoscere, Lector,
Haec praecepta feres, quae sunt gratissima vitae.
Instrue praeceptis animum, nec discere cesses;
Nam sine doctrina, vita est quasi mortis imago.
Commoda multa feres: sin autem spreveris illud,
Non me scriptorem, sed te neglexeris ipse.

Arbitrii nostri non est quid quisque loquatur.

Quantumcunque potes, celato crimen amici.

Simplicitas very sana est, fraus ficta loquendi.

Nam cum animus languet, consumit inertia corpus.
5 Interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis,
Ut possis animo quemvis sufferre laborem.

Exemplo simili ne te derideat alter.

Augendo serva, ne sis quem fama loquatur,

Munificus facito vivas, non parcus amicis.

Nullius sensum, si prodest, tempseris unquam.

Fac vivas contentus eo, quod tempora praebent.

Nec retinere velis, si coeperit esse molesta.

Quae fugias: vita est nobis aliena magistra.

Succumbat labor, and frustra tentata relinquas.

Ne videare malos imitari velle tacendo.

Ipsae etiam leges cupiunt ut jure regantur.

Cumque reus tibi sis, teipsum judice damna.

Nam miranda canunt, sed non credenda, Poetae.

Ne dicare loquax, dum vis urbanus haberi.

Nam lachrymis struit insidias, dum foemina plorat.

Qui sua consumunt, cum deest, aliena sequuntur.

Quae bona si non est, finis tamen illa malorum est.

Namque malum est nil velle pati, nec posse tacere.

Nec matrem offendas, dum vis bonus esse parenti.
The Fourth Book of Cato's Distichs concerning Manners.
THE PREFACE.
WHoever thou art, that fain would live secure,
And not to hurtful vice thy mind inure,
Remember that these Rules thou often read,
Which in thy course of life may thee bestead.

Which they that dote upon live beggar-wise.

If thou with needful things contented be.

Say not that Fortune, which is nothing, ^'s blind.

In which no honest man takes much delight.

A rich m^n sick, has Cash, but not himself.

Endure thy Fathers words, when he does threaten.

Those apt to errors, whence no good ensue.

It Is part of gains to help an honest man.

Things often do harm, which thou at first neglectest.

Take heed of Gluttony the bellies friend.

I charge thee that of man thou take great heed.

Be wise (...) en will valiant thee account.

No Doct^^^ like a Friend, can give relief;

Safety thereinto seek great fondness is.
15 When you a Mate or faithful friend desire,
Not after's wealth, but after's life enquire.

What good does wealth, if wealthy, thou be poor?

Detest those vicious pleasures which breed shame.

For he that is old, grows childish once again.

Art tarries, and a man will never fail.

Speech does man's manners hide, and them bewray.

As care by wit, so use is helped by the hand.

He fears it not, that knows to scorn his breath.

For thus must knowledge propagated be.

Many an ill disease proceeds from pleasure.

Do not condemn again, through lightness moved.

Again, when things go ill, do not despair.

Few men by long experience come to know.

One day will show how much he is thy friend.

To know deserves praise, not to know merits blame.

Take what does please, and shun what does annoy.

Where the River's still, the waters deepest are.

See other men's, which thou may far worse find.

Is better than to lanch into the deep.
34 Seek not to thrust an honest man from's right:
For God will always punish wrongful spite.

But rather joy, if thou may them obtain.

Yet sometimes for our friends we must bear crosses.

Death as thy shade, attends thee every where.

Think not to please God with a bloody vow.

He that did wrong* may come to do thee right.

In healing wounds, smart by smart cured is.

Suppose he is changed, yet his first love respect.

Lest name of thankles-person-light on thee.

With such, and Cowards, Death does best agree.

Slaves call them, yet, being men, do not abuse them.

Lest thou look after what thou did forsake.

They happy die, whose life was never bad.

Take heed thou do not bear the Cuckolds name.

(Above all things) an ill will to be taught.

The senses briefness makes them go by twain.
Catonis distichorum de Moribus Liber Quartus.
PRAEFATIO.
SEcurum quicunque cupis traducere vitam,
Nec vitiis haerere animum, quae moribus obsunt:
Haec praecepta tibi semper relegenda memento,
Invenies aliquid, in quo te utare magistro.

Quas qui suspiciunt, mendicant semper avari.

Si contentus eo fueris, quod postulat usus.

Noli Fortunam, quae non est, dicere coecam.

Quam nemo sanctus, nec honestus captat habere.

Aeger dives habet nummos, sed non habet ipsum.

Fer patris imperium, cum verbis exit in iram.

In quibus error inest, nec spes est certa laboris.

Nam recte fecisse bonis in part lucrorum est.

Namque solent, primo quae sunt neglecta nocere.

Indulgere gulae noli, quae ventris amica est.

Unum hominem tibi praecipio plus esse timendum.

Fac sapias, sic tu poteris vir fortis haberi.

Nec quisquam melior medicus, quam sidus amicus.

Stultitia est morte alterius sperare salutem.
15 Cum tibi vel socium, vel fidum quaeris amicum,
Non tibi fortuna est hominis, sed vita petenda.

Quid tibi divitiae prosunt, si pauper abundas?

Fac fugias animo, quae sunt mala gaudia vitae.

Nam quicunque senex, sensus puerilis in illo est.

Ars remanet, vitamque hominis non deserit unquam.

Sermo hominum mores, and celat, and indicat idem.

Ut cura ingenium, sic and manus adjuvat usum.

Non timet is mortem, qui soit contemnere vitam.

Propaganda etenim rerum doctrina bonarum est.

Morbi causa mali est homini quandoque voluptas.

Hoc vide ne rursus levitatis crimine damnes.

Rursus in adversis, melius sperare memento.

Rara datur longo prudentia temporis usu.

Una dies, qualis fuerit, monstrabit, amicus.

Scire aliquid laus est, pudor est nil discere velle.

Quod lautum est ammo complectere, sed fuge litem.

Qua flumen placida est sorsan latet altius unda.

Alterius specta, quo sit discrimine pejor.

Tutius est multo, quam velum tendere in altum.
34 Contra hominem justum prave contendere noli:
Semper enim Deus injustas ulciscitur iras.

Sed gaude potius, tibi si contingat habere.

Sunt quaedam quae far decet patienter amicum.

Quocunque ingrederis, sequitur mors, corporis umbrae*

Ne credas placare Deum, dum caede litatur.

Laedere qui potuit, prodesse aliquando valebit.

Vulnera dum sanas, dolor est medicina doloris.

Mutavit mores: sed pignora prima memento.

Ne nomen subeas, quod dicitur Offici-perda.

Nam timidis and suspectis aptissima mors est.

Et servos dicas; homines tamen esse memento.

Ne rursus quaeras quae jam neglexeris ante.

Foelices obeunt, quorum sine crimine vita est.

Vitandum ducas inimicum nomen amici.

Fac discas multa, and vites nescire doceri.

Hos brevitas sensus fecit conjungere binos.
Erasm. Rot. in Epist. ad Joh. Nivium.
I Think nothing ought to be disdained, be it never so mean, which pertains to
Learning, much less these Verses which are of such pure Latin, and so
profitable for good manners.

Erasm. Rot. in Epist. ad Joh. Nivium.
EGo nihil sastidiendum duco, quantum vis humile, quod ad bonas pertinet
