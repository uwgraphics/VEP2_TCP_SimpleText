A few Words in season to all the Inhabitants of the Earth, to call them to
Repentance before it be too late,
ALl you Inhabiters of the Earth, hear the Word of the Lord, and hearken what
the Spirit of Truth says; you who are spending your precious time in Pride,
Coveteousness and Lightness, in Wantonness and Vanity, in your vain
Conversations and evil Communications, in lying and deceit, in vain words, and
evil speaking, in laughter which is madness, as says the Scriptures, sporting
you selves as in the daytime, making merry over the just principle in you, and
slaying my Witness in you, my controversy is against you all, says the Lord
Almighty, and my wrath and indignation is kindled against you all that are
found in these things, and if you do not speedily repent and turn from the
evil of your ways, and turn in your minds to my Witness in you, which
witnesses against all your unjust doings; (yea my Law in your hearts, you
trample upon, which condems you for your rebellion against it) and if you
hearken not to my counsel, and turn at my reproof, and join to the Light in
you, and give up to be guided by it, ye shall for ever perish; for I am the
Light of the World, says* Christ, and lights every one that comes into the
World; and this is the condemnation that Light is come into the World, and men
love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil; you will not
come to me that you may have life, says Christ; for all your preaching and
praying, and singing, and the best performances ye have, whilst the heart is
unclean, and the fruit brought forth that is accursed, they are all as
menstrous rags and stinketh in my nostrills, and your prayers are an
abomination, says the Lord; yea, Priests and People has all corrupted their
ways, there is none that does good, no not one that, bears the Image of the
earthly; therefore return, return from the wickedness of your ways, and cease
to do evil, and learn to do well; and come and let us reason together, says
the Lord, though your sins are as crimson, they shall be as white as snow,
though as red as scarlet they shall be as white as wool; for what is to be
known of God is manifest in man, that is the true Light which lights every
man that comes into the World; John 1. And whilst you have the Light believe
in the Light, that ye may be Children of the Light, says Christ: John 12. This
is the condemnation, that light is come into the World, and men love darkness
rather than light, because their deeds are evil; for every one that does evil
hates the light, nether comes to the Light least their deeds should be
reproved; but he that does Truth comes to the Light, that his deeds may be
made manifest, that they are wrought in God; John 3. 19, 20, 22.

So people consider, is not Pride and Covetousness works of darkness? For the
Lord beholds the Proud afar off, and Covetousness is Idolatry, and a Liar
cannot enter into the Kingdom, neither can any in their vain conversation; for
ye are grieving his Spirit and doing dispite to the God of Truth: Are ye not
spurning against God? do ye think to strive with him and prosper? no verily, a
day of sorrow is coming upon you, and will overtake you as a Thief in the
night, and you cannot escape it; therefore you unwise lay it to heart, be
afflicted and Mourn and Weep, let your Laughter be turned to Mourning, and your
Joy to Heaviness; it is better to go to the House of Mourning, then to the
House of Laughter, or to the House of Feasting; for that is the end of all Men,
and the living will lay it to his heart; Sorrow is better than Laughter, for by
the sadness of the countenance the Heart is made better; the Heart of the Wise
is in the House of Mourning, but the Heart of Fools is in the House of Mirth;
So ye Fools be wise and of an understanding Heart; Fear, Dread and Tremble, ye
stiff necked ones; for unto such a one will I look that is of a contrite Spirit
and trembles at my Word, says the Lord; Therefore serve the Lord with fear,
and rejoice before him with trembling, kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye
perish from the way; when his Wrath is kindled but a little, blessed are all
they that put their trust in Him.

And you Swearers, and Drunkards, and Adulterers, repent, repent and turn from
you evil ways and wicked actions, and turn to the Witness of God in you, which
witnesses against these your actions, and judges you for them; and if you
meet Him not by Judgment, He will cut you off in the feirceness of his Wrath,
and you will down to the pit, and there will be none to deliver you; for
because of these things the Land mourns, and the habitations thereof are
become desolate, yea desolation hangs over your heads for these things; yea
my Law in your hearts you trample upon, which condemns you for so doing and if
you do not speedily repent and own my Word in your Hearts (the Light) which
shows you these great abominations; and if you hearken not to my counsel and
turn at my reproof; Lo, I will come in a day and in a hour, that ye look not
for, and in the midst of your Pleasure and Idolatry will cut you off, and you
shall go down into the Lake that burns for evermore; but if you will return
from your wickedness and hearken to my Word in you, says the Lord; the Gate of
Mercy is set open, by which you may return and Live; so Life and Death is set
before you, choose you whether; for the Lord wills not your destruction, it will
be of your selves if you perish for evermore; so whether you hear or forbear,
the Lord is clear of your Blood; so remember you rebellious ones, you had
warning in your life time, for the Grace of God has appeared to all Men, and
it teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and to live righteously
and soberly in this present World; who were sometime in darkness, but now are
Light in the Lords Praises, Glory and Honor be given to his gracious Name for
evermore.

And you that are found in these things before mentioned, the Grace of God has
appeared to you, though you mind it not, but live in laciviousness, in the Lust
of the Eye, which is the Pride of Life; and the Lord beholds the Proud afar
off, and to Judgment you must come assuredly; and you that live in the lust of
the Flesh, which they that live after must dye, and think not that you shall
escape the Wrath of the Lord for these things; and you Liars ye cannot enter
into the Kingdom in that nature, for all these things comes forth of the
cursed nature and evil ground; therefore return, return to the measure of the
Spirit of God in you, which judges you for these things; and as you join to
the Spirit it will mortify the deeds of the body, the unruly Nature, which
dishonors the Lord; and so as you are lead by it, it will bring you out of
the evil ways to live righteously and soberly to the Praise and Glory of God
with us; for the Lord made Man for his own Glory; but whilst you live in your
evil ways, you dishonor his Name and grieve his Spirit, showing you are
Children of disobedience, which will bring destruction upon you; and if you do
not hear and return it will come upon you assuredly. This is a Warning from the
Lord to warn you before his Wrath break forth upon you; but if you hear and
return from your evil ways, it will be well with you; if not his Wrath will
break forth upon you; so in the fear of the Lord whilst you have a little more
time, prize it that your Souls may live and not dye, spend no more time in
vanity and wickedness, I warn you from the Lord by his Spirit, lest you are
destroyed for ever: From a Servant of the Lord, who has known his terror for
sin, and through his Love returned to do his will; and in obedience to his
command do warn you: and if you hear your Souls shall live; if not, your blood
will be upon your own heads, the Lord is clear of you.

Given forth by a Lover of the Seed of God in all the whole Creation; who am a
Stranger to the World, and longs for the Redemption thereof. E. FLETCHER.

The End.
