HIS MAJESTY'S MOST GRACIOUS ANSWER
To the Proposition of both houses of Parliament for Ireland sent the Twenty
fourth of February 1642.
HIs Majesty being Glad to receive any proposition that may repair the
Calamity of his; distressed Kingdom of Ireland, especially when it may be
without burden or imposition, and for the ease of his good Subjects of this
Kingdom has graciously considered the Overture made by both Houses of
Parliament to that purpose, and returns this answer.

That as he has offered and is still ready to venture his own Royal person
for the recovery of that Kingdom, if his Parliament shall advise him
thereunto, so he will not deny to contribute any other assistance he can to
that service, by parting with any profit or advantage of his own there. And
therefore (relying upon the wisdom of this Parliament) does consent to every
proposition now made to him, without taking time to examine whether this course
may not retard the reducing of that Kingdom, by exasperating the Rebels, and
rendering them desperate of being received into Grace, if they shall return to
their obedience.

And his Majesty will be ready to give his Royal assent to all such Bills as
shall be tendered unto him by his Parliament for the confirmation of every
particular of this proposition.
