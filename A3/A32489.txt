A PROCLAMATION For Reassembling the Parliament.
CHARLES R.

WHereas Our Parliament now in being stands Prorogued till the Tenth day of
October next, We having had reason to believe at the time of the said
Prorogation, that Our Affairs might have permitted the Attendance of the
Members of both Houses on Our Service and their own Occasions in their
respective Countries, until that time: We now finding this Our Kingdom Invaded
during a Treaty of Peace, and esteeming Our Self ever most safe in the Advice
and Affection of Our People in Parliament, Have therefore, and for diverse
urgent Causes moving Us thereunto, thought fit, and resolved by and with the
Advice of Our Privy Council, to call together both Our Houses of Parliament;
And do therefore hereby straightly Charge and Command all and every the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and all Knights of Shires, Citizens of Cities,
Burgesses of Boroughs, and Barons of the Cinque Ports of this present
Parliament, That they and every of them do personally appear, reassemble
themselves, and give their Attendance at Westminster on the Twenty fifth day of
July next, then and there to Treat and Advise of the weighty Affairs of Our
Kingdom; And all Assistants of Our House of Peers, and Officers and Ministers
of either House of Parliament, are hereby required and enjoined to give their
Attendance accordingly.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the 26th day of June 1667. in the Nineteenth
year of Our Reign.
