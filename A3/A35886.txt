A DIALOGUE BETWEEN Pasquin and Morforio, Two STATUES in ROME.
Mor. WHY how now Pas -- since the Last Election,
I thought you would no Business for Reflection?
French Leuid'ores, that never used to fail,
Have lost their Virtue now, and cannot prevail;
And honest Clement wisely does Espouse,
Distinction's laid aside, the Common Cause.

Pas. True, but the English Senators have made
Themselves the Subject of a Pasquinade --

Mor, Pray hold your Tongue.

Pas -- Why so? I need not fear,
Their Sergeant surely cannot reach me here.

Mor. Their Privileges daily they extend,
For, like the World to come, they are without End;
And if their Power but equally increase,
You may have Cause to wish you would held your peace.
But what is the Quarrel?

Pas -- I can make it out:
That tho 500 used to set and Vote,
(At least 400 Senators and odd)
They Are now reduced to 4.

Morf -- To 4?

Pas -- To 4 indeed.
One M, one S, two HH, and no more,
The Nation represents, and that is but Four.
The rest are (o's) and no Number make,
Unless you do from these the Unites take.

Mor. How can that be?

Pas -- If you desire to know,
NED will inform you, and JACK tell you HOW.
Ask at Vienna, Shall we War proclaim?
To be resolved, they will bid you go to them:
And at the Hague they will tell you, It Is as they,
And not the KING or his Allies, shall say.
Huffing D'aux Vaunts and Swears Be Gar,
My Master do de Dutch nor no Confederate fear,
If S. and Shak Hoe against him don Declare:
Them he will make his own, and den vid ease,
Can wind and turn the rest which vay de please.
But who, except Lewis le Grand that knows
The Force of Luid'ores, would e're suppose,
That Four should lead Four Hundred by the Nose!
