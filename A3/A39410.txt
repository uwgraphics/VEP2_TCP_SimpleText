HIS Majesty being desirous that the Treaties between Him and the Neighboring
Princes and States, His Allies, be duly Observed and Executed, and in no wise
misconstrued in this juncture of time, is pleased to Declare, That the Clause
in the latter end of the Fifth Article of His late Royal Proclamation, bearing
Date at Newmarket the Twelfth of this Month, (Purporting, That the Goods or
Merchandises of His Own Subjects found in Prize-Ships brought up to His
Majesty Ports, shall upon due Proof, be taken out and Restored to the true
Proprietors) is to be understood, only of the Goods or Merchandises of His
Majesty's Subjects, taken in the Ships of such of His Allies, as being in War
with others, have in the Treaties now Subsisting between His Majesty and them,
no such Clause o^ Provision as makes Free-Goods to become Unfree, when Laden
and Taken in Unfree Ships; But as to those of His Majesty's Allies who by
Treaty with Him have Stipulated and Agreed, That whatsoever Goods or
Merchandise shall be found Laden by His Majesty's Subjects, upon any Ship
whatsoever belonging to those with whom such Allies are in Hostility, may be
Confiscated; It is His Majesty's meaning, That the Goods or Merchandises of His
Own Subjects so taken and brought up into Port, be not taken out of any
Prize-Ship, or Restored to the Proprietors; But be left in the Power and
Possession of the Captor, as well as the proper Goods of those he is in
Hostility with, that shall be taken in the same Ship; And this His Majesty
Commands to be strictly observed by His Officers in the Sea Ports of His
Kingdoms and Dominions, whom it may or shall in any way concern.
