LONDON, Printed for R. R. Nov. 5. 1642.

The Kings DECLARATION For a PACIFICATION.
THe Kings Majesty to declare that he is full of Mercy as well as Justice,
desiring not the effusion of his Subjects blood, does by a late Proclamation
declare, Thatwhereas it was unjustly suspected that he favored the malignant
party, and those that are Popishly affected, he does disavow and protest
against all suspicions, ever intending the maintenance of the Protestant
Religion, and the good of his Subjects, and does therefore most earnestly
desire that all matters of difference might be reconciled betwixt him and his
Parliament, though many rumors have bin spread abroad that he has sought the
ruin and destruction thereof, and has for that purpose raised this present
great Army, but now since the great battle at Kenton near Banbury, he does
show himself a right noble King, in desiring his Subjects not to be mistaken
in his intents, but confidently to believe that he desires nothing more then
that they would upon good terms lay down their Arms, and that thereupon he
would receive them again into his gracious mercy and favor: what can be said
more by a King unto his Subjects: who seeking their preservation, if by any
fair means it may be obtained, does desire them to embrace the gracious offer
of Peace: what love can be greater then for a King to entreat his Subjects, and
desire them to be good unto themselves, and not to proceed in these violent
courses, which must needs be the ruin and destruction of the Kingdom. He is
resolved that for what is past, he will not think the worse of any of them, and
if they will now return to their former obedience, he will most lovingly forget
all opposition made by them, being confident that they have been misled by
some factious advice to stand in an opinion of defending Religion and his
Person, when by these violent proceedings, they go about to destroy both. But
on the contrary, it has pleased his Majesty to declare, that if they still
continue to certify matters by a combination, in opposing his Majesty, and
do contribute Plate, Money, or any other assistance to these present wars, he
will account them open enemies against his Person, and the state of the
Kingdom. But if they will submit unto his mercy, and proceed no further in a
warlike manner, to take up Arms upon whatsoever pretenses, but lay down those
already ready taken, he will give unto all his Subjects a free pardon for all
former acts, and will no more remember any former passages, even from the first
beginning of this dissension between the King and Parliament.

And moreover, for the preventing of great effusion of blood, and the settling
of matters, whereby the Kingdom may flourish as it formerly has done, the King
led thereunto by his own royal disposition, does desire that certain grave
and substantial Citizens may be chosen to reconcile matters of difference
between his Majesty and the Parliament, and that he will in like manner appoint
some equal in fidelity and understanding to consult with them about the great
affairs of the Kingdom; and what they shall agree upon, he will ratify and
make good by consenting to all their Acts and Consultations, that so this
Civil-warre, which has bred so great a disturbance in the Kingdom, may
proceed no further, a pacification and beace being made on both sides, to the
general content of the King, the Parliament, and all his royal Subjects.

It is most certain that the requests of a King have a commanding power, and
howsoever some skillful in calumnious reports, seek to cherish and increase
the unhappy disagreement between the King and people, yet in the wisdom of
those that are best affected, nothing is thought to be a more ready way to
procure the peace and happiness of this Kingdom, then that all grudges and
jelousies may be removed, and matters well stated and settled for the good of
the Commonwealth, whereupon will follow a clear understanding between Prince
and people, continued together in a mutual league of dearest affection, it
being the wonder of the Land, and the joy of foreign Nations, that there
should be any disagreement between our Sovereign and his Subjects, especially a
Civil war, the like whereof, these many hundred years has not been known^ in
England. It will be therefore very f;it not to seek too far into the causes of
the Kings displeasure, or of the present disagreement of the King and
Parliament, since all humane actions, whether of the Prince or people are
subject unto such errors as cannot be corrected but by a Divine power; Many
things may befall a State for the punishment thereof, that the people be in
grown ripe in their sins, may on a sudden be cut down and the sword of the
Prince may execute the decree of divine revenge; And again, the people misled
by factious counsel, may be drawn to oppose their King, (I say no^ that they
are) since to excuse in an equal manner cannot be thought to be any particular
condemnation, but in regard that both are subject to error, it may be without
offense concluded, that it were best with a clear understanding to look into
the occasion of this Civil war, whereof some perhaps are utterly ignorant, and
others upon false grounds think it fit to be maintained: And therefore to shun
these errors of opinion, it will be the safest and most peaceable course to
desire that there might be a Pacification and agreement between the Prince and
the people, and his most loyal Parliament, which his Majesty in a late
Proclamation has most graciously offered.

For let all Subjects consider the premises of his disavowing all Papists, and
protesting to maintain the Protestant Religion, his desiring of peace between
himself and his Parliament; his offer of pardon to all his loving Subjects,
earnestly requesting them to lay down their Arms; his protesting that he does
and will seek to avoid the effusion of blood; and lastly his offer of
establishing a peace by Counselors elected on both sides, and all this will be
sufficient to work a desire of reconcilement between the King and his Subjects.

FINIS.
