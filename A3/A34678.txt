, in bearing the burdens one of another Gal. 6.2.
, and imposing no burdens, but in equal proportion 2 Cor. 8.13, 14.

16 Qu. Wherein stands the brotherly Communion which we are to hold one with
another?

Ans. In our steadfast and continual fellowship in the Apostles doctrine, and
worship, and ministration Act. 2, 42. and 6.1.
; and for this end to dwell together Psalm. 133.1. and 122.1, 3.
, to watch over one another Heb. 10.24. and 3.12, 13. and 12.15. Mat. 18.15.
, to resort together to the public assemblies Heb. 10.25. Psalm. 110.3. and

, and there to join in all holy duties, with one accord Isa. 60.8. Act. 1.14.

, and every Lords day, as God has prospered us, to lay up in store for the

for all men, even for Kings, and all in authority, that we may lead a quiet and
peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty 1 Timothy 2.1, 2 Ezra 6.10.
.

19 Qu. Whether are not set forms of public Prayer, devised and ordained by
men, an acceptable sacrifice unto the Lord?

Ans. If such set forms had been an Ordinance of the Lord, and a Worship
acceptable unto him, the Lord himself, or at least some of the Apostles and
Prophets would not have held back that part of Gods counsel from the Church
Act. 20.26, 27.
. Besides, public Prayer is as well a part of public Ministry, as Prophecy
is Genesis 20 7. Nehem. 9.6. 1 Cor. 14.16.
; and the forms of one might as justly be taught by the precepts of men, as the
other Isa 29.13. Mat. 15.6, 9.
; and both of them are alike the gifts of the holy Spirit, to whom it belongs
as well to teach us what to pray, as how to pray Romans 8.26.
. Nor will it well stand with the holy gesture, very usual in Prayer, which is
to lift up our eyes to heaven, to cast down our eyes, and so fix them upon a
book Joh 11.41. and 17.1. Psalm. 121.1. and 123.1.
.

20 Qu. What part of public worship is next to be administered?

therewith to preach it, by giving the sense, and applying the use Nehem. 8.8.
Acts 15.22 Luke 14.21, 23, to 28.
: In dispensing whereof they were wont to stand above all the people in a
pulpit of wood, and the Elders on both sides Nehem. 8.4.
, whilst the people hearkened to them with reverence and attention Neh 8.5, 6,
7. Luke 4 16 17, 20.
. Where there be more Prophets besides the Elders, they may prophecy two or
three Nehem. 8.7. 1 Cor. 14.29, 31. 1 These. 5.20.
, if the time permit, the Elders calling to them, whether of the same Church or
others, if they have any word of exhortation for the people to say on Acts
13.15. 1 Cor. 14.31:
, and for the better edifying of a man's self or others, it may be lawful for
any young or old (save 1 Cor. 14.34, 35.
only for women) to ask Questions at the mouth of the Prophets Mal. 2.7. Lu.
2.46.
.

21. Qu. After the Ministry of the Word, what part of Gods public worship is
next to be administered?

Ans. After the Word (which is the Covenant of God) the seals of the Covenant

. And as for Baptism, it is to be dispensed by a Minister of the Word Acts
16.14, 15, 31, 32, 33.
, unto a believer, professing his repentance, and his Faith Mat. 28.19. Mat. 3
6.
, being a member of the same Church body Lu. 3.5.12 8
, as also unto his seed Act. 8.36.37 Genesis 17.23. Acts 16.15.33 1 Cor. 7.14.
, presented by the Parents to the Lord, and his Church Luke 2.21.22
, at which time the Minister calls upon the Parents to renew his Covenant
with God for himself, and his seed Genesis 17.27.18.19.
, and calls upon God (as the nature of the Ordinance requires) for the pardon
of original sin, and of the sin of the Parents, and for a blessing upon
the Ordinance and Infant Mat 3.11. 1 Timothy 4.5.
; and then the Child being called by the name which the Parent has given it,
for the his own edification, and the child's Luke 1.59 to 63. and 2.21. Mat.
3.6, 16. John 3.23. Acts 8.38, 39 Romans 6.4.
, he Baptizeth it into Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy
Ghost 1 Cor. 10.2. Heb. 10.22. Mat. 28.19.
.

22. Qu. How is the Lords Supper to be administered?

Ans. The Supper of the Lord is to be dispensed by the Minister of the Word 2
Cor. 30.17. and 35.5, 6.
, unto the faithful of the same Body 1 Cor. 10.17, and 12, 13, 14.
, or commended to them by a like Body Romans 16.1, 2.
, having examined and judged themselves 1 Cor. 11.28. to 31.
, and sitting down with him at the Lords Table e, before whom the Minister
takes the Bread, and blesses it, breaks it, and gives it to the Brethren,
with this commandment once for all, To take and eat it as the body of Christ
broken for them, and this to do in remembrance of him. In like manner also he
takes the Cup, and having given thanks, he powers it forth, and gives it to
them, with a commandment to them all, To take, and drink it as the blood of
Christ shed for them, and this also to do in remembrance of Him Mat. 26.26.27,
28. Luke 22.19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25. Mat. 26.30. Mar. 1426. Greek, as He.
2.12. from Psalm. 22.22.
. After all have partaken, thanksgiving is ended with singing a Psalm*.

23. Q. After the Ministry of the Word, and the seals thereof, how is the
Collection for the Saints to be administered?

Ans. The collection for the Saints was by the Apostles ordinance, to be made:
for the time, every. Lords day 1 Cor. 16.1. 2. Deuteronomy. 16.10.16.
; for the measure, as God has prospered every man 1 Cor. 16.2 2 Cor. 8.3.
; for the manner, not of constraint, but freely and willingly 2 Cor. 9.5.7.
, brought by the givers as an Offering to the Lord, and laid down Acts 434.35
Mat. 1^.42 2 Chro. 29.17
, as at first before the Apostles, so afterward by their appointment before
the Deacons of the Church as into a common Treasury Acts 4 35. with chapter ^ 2. to
8. 1 Cor. 16.2 (...). put into the common stock, Gal. 6.6. (...). 1 Timothy 5.17,
18. Gal 6.6. Acts 4.35. and 6.1, 2, 3. Romans 15.25, 26. Acts 1.28, 29, 30.
, by them to be distributed to the supply of the Ministry, and of the poor
Saints, according to their need, and of outward service of the Church f.

24 Qu. What duty of Gods worship is to be performed in dismissing the
Assembly?

Ans. After all other parts of Gods public worship have been performed, the
Minister Number. 6.23.
, or any of the Prophets, is to dismiss the Assembly with a word of blessing 1 Samuel 6.18. 1 King. 8.14. and 8.55, 10.61.
, offering up blessing unto the Lord, and putting a blessing upon the People
Number. 6.25. to 27. 2 These. 3.17, 18. 2 Cor. 13.14.
.

25. Qu. In what manner are all the duties of Gods worship to be administered?

Ans. In spiritual simplicity, without affectation of legal shadows John 4.24.
, of worldly pomp, or carnal excellency 2 Cor. 2.17. and 1.12. 1 Cor. 2.1,
2, 6, 13.
, decently 1 Cor. 14.40.
, and in order Idem.
, and to edification 1 Cor. 14.26.
.

26. Qu. What form of Government is the Government of the Church?

Ans. The Government of the Church is in Christ our head kingly or royal Psalm.
2.6. Isa. 33.22. and 9.6
, but in the Church Stewardly and Ministerial Mat. 16.19 1 Cor. 4.1, 4. 1 Pet.
4.10. and 5.1, 2, 3.
, and in both of them spiritual and heavenly John 18 36.


27. Qu. How does Christ exercise his Kingly government (or power) in the
Church?

Ans. By calling the Church into holy fellowship with himself, and one with
another Psalm. 74.2 and 76.1, 2
, by ordaining Officers and Governors in his Church, with their callings and
gifts Ephesians. 4.8, 11 1 Cor. 12.28
, by giving Laws and Ordinances to his Church, for the whole Government of it
Isa. 33.22 Jam. 4.12
, by putting life and power, even the power of his Spirit, into all his
Ordinances, for the edifying of his body unto perfection 2 Timothy 3.16 17. Mat.
18.18, 20. and 28 20. John 16 7, to 11, 13, 14.
, and finally by subduing our enemies, and perfecting our selves in his peace
to his heavenly kingdom Romans 16.20. John 14.27. 2 Timothy 4.18
.

28 Qu. How is the Government of the Church in the hand of the Church,
Stewardly or Ministerial?

Ans. Because the end of the Government of the Church is spiritual and
heavenly John 18.36 Mat. 16.19
, as is the building up of Christ's kingdom, and the saving of souls 1 Cor. 5.5
. It is not in the power of men to ordain or provide means or helps to such
ends; but only for him that can work upon the soul and conscience Ephesians. 4.11,
12 1 Cor, 1.24 and 3.5, 6, 7
: and therefore it is not in the hand of the Church to make Laws or
Ordinances, to choose Officers or Members, to administer Sacraments, or
Censures, or any part of Worship or Government, of their own heads, but to
receive all as from the hand of Christ; and to dispense all according to the
will of Christ, revealed in his word Heb. 8.5 1 Kin. 13.33 and 12.33. Ier.
7.31. Number. 15.39. Deuteronomy. 12.1, 4, 31.32.
.

29. Qu. How is the Government of the Church spiritual and heavenly?

Ans. The Government of the Church, though it be not altogether inward, but
partly outward Luke 17.20, 21. Isa. 2.2.
, as being administered by open and known Officers Isa. 30.20.
, with an audible and lively voice Rev. 1.16.
, in the open face of the Brethren of the Congregation Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. 1 Timothy 5.20.
, yet it is in it self not of this world, but spiritual and heavenly Joh.
18.36.
, as being ordained not by the wisdom of this world, but of Christ 1 Cor. ^ 6,
7, 8. Mat. 28.20.
; and administered, not according to the precepts of men, but his commandments
Mat. 15.6, 9
; not by earthly weapons, but by the Word, and seals of the Covenant, and other
spiritual Ordinances 2 Cor. 10.4 Isa. 11.4.
; not working upon the bodies or outward estates of men by fines, or
imprisonments loss of limbs, or of life; but upon their souls and consciences
by the evidence of the Spirit Heb. 13.17 2 Cor. 10 5. 1 Cor. 2.4.
: Finally, not aiming at worldly peace, wealth and honor, but at the
righteousness of faith, peace of conscience, and joy in the holy Ghost Joh. 16
33 Romans 14 17
.

30 Qu. To whom has Christ committed the Government of his Church?

Ans. Partly to the body of the Church, in respect of the state or frame of it

private Member of the Church?

Ans. Yes verily, there is a power of edification 1 Cor. 10.23 24. Mat. 16.18,
19 and 17.15, 16.
, which the Lord has given to every Member of the Chuch, to exercise mutually
one over another Jude 20. 1 These. 5 5.11. 1 Cor. 12 7.
, to save some with compassion, others with fear Jude 21, 22, 23.
, by a word of instruction, Admonition, Exhortation, and Comfort Acts 18.26.
Mat. 18.15. Col. 3 16. 1 These. 5.14 11.
.

34. Qu. How is Ordination to be administered?

Ans. When the Church has chosen and called on Officer, they present him to
the Elders Acts 1.23. and 6.5, 6.
, who do ordain him, if he be a Deacon, with Prayer, and Impositian of hands
Acts. 6.6.
, and with Fasting also, if he be an Elder Acts 14.23.
.

35. Qu. How are the Censures of the Church to be administered?

Ans. The Censures of the Church are ordained by Christ for the removing of
scandalls out of the Church Mat. 18.16. to 15. Luke 17.1, 2, 3.
, which if they be private (one Brother offending another) the offender is to
go and acknowledge his repentance of it unto his Brother Mat. 5.23, 24
, who is then to forgive him Luke 17.14.
, but if the offender neglect to do it, the Brother offended is to go and
admonish him, and convince him of it between themselves privately. If
thereupon the offender be brought to repent of his offense, the Admonisher
has won his Brother: but if the offender hear not his brother, the brother
offended is to take with him one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three
witnesses every word may be established; whether the word of admonition, if the
offender receive it, or the word of complaint to the Church, if he refuse it:
for if he refuse it, the offended brother is to tell the Church, and if he
refuse to hear the Church, then he is to be counted as an Heathen and
Publican Luke 17.3. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17.
.

36. Qu. What if the scandalls (or offenses) be public, how are they to be
removed?

Ans. By public reproof 1 Timothy 5.20. Gal. 2.14.
, and if the offenses be not only public but heinous, then the Church is to
remove the offense by Excommunicating the offender out of the Church 1 Cor.
5.1.5. 1 Timothy 1.20.
.

37. Qu. How is Excommunication to be administered?

Ans. When the offense of any Brother is public and heinous, or being
private, is by the obstinacy of the offender become publicly scandalous, the
Church being met together, is in the name and power of the Lord Jesus, and
with his Spirit, to deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the
flesh, and the salvation of his soul in the day of the Lord Jesus 1 Cor.
5.1.4, 5. Mat. 18.17. 1 Timothy 1.20. 2 Timothy 3.2, 5. Tit. 3.10, 11.
.

38. Qu. Is there no use of Suspension in the Church?

Ans. There may, to Members lying under the apparent guilt of sin, after the
admonition of the Church 1 Cor. 5.11. 2 Thessalonians. 3.14.
, discerning the unclean from the clean, until they be cleansed Dev. 10.10.
Eze. 22, 26. Ier. 15.19.
.

39. Qu. What is Anathema Maranatha?

Ans. It is the utmost Censure of the Church, whereby a Brother falling from
the love of Christ into hatred against him, is cut off from fellowship with
Christ for ever, even to the coming of the Lord 1 Cor. 16.22.
.

40. Qu. Having seen what power of Government the Church has received and
exercised within it self: tell me now whether any Church has power of
government over another?

Ans. No Church has power of Government over another, but each of them has
chief power within it self, and all of them equal power one with another;
every Church has received alike the power of binding, and loosing, opening and
shutting the Kingdom of heaven 1 Mat. 18.17 18.
. But one to another, all of them are Sisters Cant. 8, 8. Gal. 4.26.31
, all of them Concubines Cant. 6.8.
, but by their own corruption or usurpation of others Revel. 18.2.
: finally all of them are Candlesticks of the same precious metal, and in the
midst of them all Christ equally walks Revel. 1.12, 13. and 2.1.
.

41. Qu. But if one Church have no power of Government over another: what
course then is there left to reform such corruptions as may arise in any
Church, whether in Doctrine or practice?

Ans. The corruptions that are found in any Church do either infect part of the
Church, or the whole body: if part only, then the part remaining sound, may
either convince and reform their Brethren themselves, if they be able; or if
they be not able, they may at least prevail so far with them, as to send for
light from some other Church, as they of Antioch did to the Church of
Jerusalem Acts 15.2.
. But if the corruptions found in a Church do infect the whole body, Ezra 10.2.
yet still there is hope in Israel concerning this. For though one Church has
not power of Government over another, as subordinate to them: yet every Church
has equal power one with another, as coordinate with them. And therefore look
what power one Brother has over another in the same Church, the same power
has one Church over another in Brotherly communion. As if one Church shall
hear of any offense in another, they may enquire the certainty of it Deuteronomy.
13.14.
, and thereupon send letters and messengers, to convince and admonish them of
it. If the Church offending do hear the Church admonishing, they have gained
their Brethren and their desire: if the Church hear them not, then that other
Church may take one or two Churches more, to assist them in the conviction of
that sin. If yet the Church hear them not, then upon due notice thereof
given, all the Churches thereabout may so meet together, and after judicious
enquiry into the cause, may by the word of God confute and condemn such
errors in doctrine or practice, as are found offensive, to prevent the
spreading either of the gangrene of heresy 2 Timothy 2.17, 18.
, or of the leprosy of sin 1 Cor. 5.6, 7
. And if the Church offending shall not yet hearken to their Brethren, though
the rest of the Churches have not power to deliver them to Satan, yet they have
power to withdraw from them the right hand of fellowship, and no longer to hold
them in communion of Saints, till they approve their repentance By proportion,
from Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. 2 These. 3.6.
.

Isa. 33.22. The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our
King; he will save us.
A Conclusion.
J. C.
THe Kingdom of Christ, whether in the hearts of his servants, or in Church
State, and all the Administrations thereof, See Mr. Tailor on Tit. 1.5.
dispensed according to the Rule of the Gospel, does not disturb the State, or
Peace of earthly Kingdoms, or Commonwealths; And therefore, the gathering of
Saints or Churches, according to the order of Christ, and the guidance and
walking of both according to his will, is no just offense to the Civil
Magistrate.

Gal. 6.16. As many as walk according to this Rule, peace be on them and mercy,
and upon the Israel of God.
