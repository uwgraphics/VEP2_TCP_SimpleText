SIRS,
THE Favors that I have received from Your Excellency since Your Accession to
this Government, and from You the Honorable Members of His Majesty's Council
here, as also from You the Worthy and Worshipful Representatives of the People
in our General Assembly, and from the Inhabitants of this Island in general,
have been so many and Eminent, that I cannot but be truly sensible they exceed
all possibility of a just Compensation. Nor do I presume that the Compilement
of this Tract of the LAWS (now in all humility dedicated to Your Excellency,
Council and General Assembly) ought in any measure to be esteemed worthy to be
taken as any part of a Retribution. Nor did I attempt this Work upon any such
Motive, but purely that I was convinced that every Man is a Debtor to his
Country and Profession; and therefore could not but think my self obliged in
Duty to exert my utmost Efforts in some Service for the good of this Island, as
lay most proper for my Post and Profession, of which I conjectured, that a
Collection of the LAWS would be most acceptable, especially considering the
numerous Disadvantages daily suffered for want of it.

But as the many Attempts formerly without Effects made toward such a
Collection, convincingly showed the difficulty of the Task, so it did as
manifestly declare the general Benefit that was aimed at, and expected from
such a Performance, and thereby confirmed me in my former Opinion, and
encouraged me to offer some Intimations of such my Purposes and Designations to
the Assembly; which found such an Acceptance, as easily convinced me that I
could not better acquit my self of my Duty, than by a Tender of my Endeavors
in that Service, whose good Opinion of my poor Abilities, and obliging Commands
chiefly induced me to this Undertaking.

Though I am sufficiently conscious I am not par Operi, yet hope this well
intended Enterprise will give Life and Encouragement to some Abler Person to
give it a finishing Stroke, and bring it to Perfection for the Benefit of this
Place and Island, that has produced and raised many great Estates to several
Merchants, Mariners and Traders hither; and also considerable and great
Revenues to His Sacred Majesty, and which on a calm Enquiry into, and serious
Consideration of the Customs it pays for its own Native Commodities Exported
hence, the increase of English Trade and Navigation it causes, the Seamen it
thereby breeds, the Consumption of Goods of English Growth it makes, will
not be found less advantageous to the Crown of England than the best of His
Majesty's American Colonies. This may be a sufficient Reason to hope, that
since His Gracious Majesty has been pleased to grant the Power of making LAWS
proper for the Constitution of this Island, consonant and agreeable (as near as
may be) to the LAWS of his Kingdom of England; That He will also from Your
Excellency's Recommendation, extend His wonted Especial Grace and Favor to Us
in the passing the Act for the Printing and Establishing of this Collection,
which being intended for the Press, has received a strict and full Examination
(that it might be Correct) on the Oath as well of the Clerk of the Council from
the Records there, and the Clerk of the Assembly from the Records of that
House; and also of a Committee of the General Assembly, with the Inspection and
Approbation of the Honorable Francis Bond, late President, and Honorable the
Members of His Majesty's Council here, with the Attorney and Solicitor
General, and now an Authority for its Impression, by Your Excellency's passing
the Bill for that purpose.

This once Flourishing (but alas! now Withering) Isle, being blessed with Your
Excellency's Auspicious Presence, cannot but with all Duty and Loyalty rejoice
in His Majesty's great Goodness to, and abundant Care of her, in his Election
and Mission of a Person of Your Birth, Honor and Dignity to Govern her, whose
chief Delight consists in an equal distribution of Justice, and a lively and
impartial Execution of His Majesty's LAWS, and must eternally be obliged with
the utmost Gratitude, to acknowledge the Blessing she has already received
from Your Indulgence and Care. You have already opened the long barred Gates of
her Rights and Privileges, restored her Ancient Charter, and given a new Life
to her Laws. You have prescribed and reconciled our late Animosities and
Discords, and happily settled Love and Union throughout Your Government, which
seems Paternal, and Our Obedience to Your Excellency, bottomed rightly on Love,
not (according to the Dreams and Conceits of the Hobbists) upon Fear. So that I
cannot omit doing Your Excellency that Justice, as to declare, You have
imitated the most eminent and greatest Examples, viz. Our Illustrious Edward,
and Glorious Elizabeth, as well as the Learned and Great Justinian; and
therefore may justly be said to be the Life of our Laws, as well as a Pattern
of Virtue and Honor. Nor is Your Excellency's high Care and Regard to the
Royal Prerogative less observable, by which means You may de Jure claim
(because you merit) the Dignity and Authority His Majesty has with so much
Wisdom and Judgment conferred on You.

It Is not any Thoughts I have of my own Performance, that tempted me to the
Arrogance of prefixing Your Excellency's Name, together with those of the
Honorable Council, and General Assembly, to this Treatise, but the Nature and
Dignity of the Subject Matter. For who should more rightfully Patronize the
LAWS, than those that gave them Being and Birth, and who preserve them by an
equal and warm Execution?

How excellently fitted and adapted these LAWS are to the good Government of
this Place, the many Years we have lived quietly, happily and securely under
their Directions and Injunctions, will give a most convincing Testimony, and
irrefragable Argument, so as they may not improperly be called as well the
Walls of the Colony as of Justice.

LAWS are described by Cicero, de Legibus, to be the highest or chiefest Reason
grafted in Nature, commanding the things that are to be done, and forbidding
the contrary: And Fortescue speaking of the Statute Laws, gives them this
Encomiastick Definition, Lex est Sanctio Sancta, jubens honesta, and prohibens
contraria; they are truly the universal Suffrages of Nature propagating Good,
and impeading Evil. Without such, Virtue would be without Reward, and Vice
without Punishment. LAW is as the Soul in Government, that gives it Life and
Form, and is certainly the best Guard, as well of the King's Prerogative, as of
the Peoples Darlings, Liberty and Property.

The greatest Strength of Kingdoms, consists in the goodness of their LAWS,
they being the Nerves of the Body Politic, and are both Rules and Curbs to the
Ministers of Justice, to direct and keep them in the Paths of Honor and
Righteousness, and prevent all Arbitrariness in them, (whose Province it should
be to distribute Right, equally to Rich and Poor) and their Officers. Infinite
are the Benefits which accrue to those that are Partakers of Good Laws; by
which, Omne humanum Bonum, our Lives and Fortunes are preserved from Oppression
and Absolute Power, our Possessions secured to Posterity, and we in this
delightful Island made safe and happy.

King Edgar collected the Laws of his Kingdom, and gave them the Strength of a
Faggot bound, when as before his time they were loose and dispersed. This gave
him more Glory than the Sailing round his Island with a potent Fleet rowed by
conquered Kings; and was the greatest Action of him or his Predecessors for the
Good of his Subjects, the Benefit whereof has even reached this Age, and
encouraged us to follow his glorious Example, by gathering together, and
methodizing the loose and scattered Laws into one Body, which is done in this
Collection, the advantage of which, will (I doubt not) be largely experienced
in a short time by all the Inhabitants, and may be of signal Use to all
Merchants, Mariners and Traders hither, particularly to the Professors and
Practisers of the Law in England, who have formerly wanted them as Directions
in Cases upon which their Judgments have been required.

And as our Laws are to be valued and preserved as our chiefest Jewel, so in
the framing them, the greatest Care, Prudence and Consideration ought to be
had, that they be grounded on true and loyal Principles, always respecting and
promoting what is right and just. No private Interest but the Common Good,
should be the end and motive of their Constitution; they should also have the
duos Sales the Lord Cook mentions as their necessary Ingredients, viz. Salem
Sapientiae, ne sint insipidae, and Salem Conscientiae, ne sint Diabolicae. They
should also increase rather in Goodness than in Number, which naturally
produces Amazement and Confusion, if not Discord. For the Government wherein
an unanimous Accordance happens, is like a well furnished Quire, where all the
Actions, Words and Various Sounds, yield and maintain a glorious Harmony.

Thus it is evident how great the Benefits are which we receive constantly by
good Laws; and thus it is also evident, that the want of such Laws, or a lively
Execution of them, is inconsistent with the true Interest of Mankind, Men
without Government being worse than Beasts, as having greater means by the
advantage of their depraved Reason to do more (yea and more) superlative
Mischiefs, when let loose to the Dictates of their Will, such as Rebellion,
Murder, Rapines, etc.

But as the Miseries and Misfortunes are innumerable, which attend a People
that have no Laws, so the Unhappiness of those who have good Ones is not much
less, if they be kept from public View and general Use; for in such Case, what
shall direct them to their several Duties? what encourage Obedience, what
affright them from Obliquities and Transgressions? To obviate and remove all
which Evils and Inconveniences, is the prime End and Design of the Publication
of this Tract.

I fear I have too much trespassed on Your Patience, and by this long
Harrangue, rudely invaded those Minutes which You know how much better to
dispose of, therefore will detain You no longer, but to submit this Piece (such
as it is) to Your Excellency's, and the Honorable and Worshipful Gentlemen's
Patronage, with a Duty and Devotion becoming

SIRS, Your Most Obedient And Most Humble Servant, WILLIAM RAWLIN.

AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
TO the LAWS of general Concernment now in Force, and Printed at large in this

respective Titles in due place; so as (if occasion should happen) Recourse may
be had to the Records in the Offices of this Island for them.

THE LAWS OF BARBADOS.
An ACT for Printing the Laws of the Island of Barbados, Contained in the
Ensuing Volume.
FOrasmuch as nothing more conduces to the Well-being, Support, Tranquillity
and Benefit of any Place and People, than the Preservation of their Laws, and
the Knowledge of them; and daily Experience having manifested innumerable
Inconveniences that this Island have suffered for so many Years past, by not
having the Laws of the Island (by which they are to be regulated and governed,
their Lives preserved and their Estates secured to them and their Posterity)
made public and open to the ready View of all the Inhabitants, for want of
which, many Persons of great Authority in this Government not being acquainted
with all the Laws that are kept in Offices, or, if known, not to be had on
sudden Occasions; for want of which also, it often happens in the Multitude of
Copies which are taken from the Offices, great Variations and Aberrations are
made by heedless and unskilful Transcribers from the Original Laws, and these
Copies being obtruded upon Trials for Authentic, have been the Cause of Unjust
and Illegal Determinations.

And forasmuch as all our Laws on Record have often been in great Danger to
have been wholly lost both by Hurricane and Fire, for Remedy of which, and
Prevention of many other Inconveniences for the future, and that Rich and Poor
may equally have the advantage of free Recourse to the Laws of the Island, as
well the Inhabitants, as all other Persons in Parts remote, who have Estates
and Interests depending on them, and that the Laws may be collected into one
entire Volume:

Be it Enacted by his Excellency the Honorable Ralph Gray, Esquire, Captain
General, and Chief Governor of this and other the Carribee Islands, the
Honorable the Members of his Majesty's Council, and General Assembly of this
Island, and by Authority of the same, that the Body of the Laws Collected by
William Rawlin, Esquire. present Clerk of the Assembly, containing the Laws of the
said Island (excepting such as relate to particular Persons, being private
Acts) be forthwith transmitted by the said William Rawlin, or his Assigns into
the Kingdom of England, in order to the Printing thereof.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the said Book of
Laws when Printed as aforesaid, be, and shall be taken, deemed and held a Good
Lawful Statute-Book of the said Island of Barbados, in all Courts, and upon all
Occasions whatsoever, as the Statute Book of the Laws of England is deemed,
held and taken in that Kingdom. And that any Impression of the said Laws, which
shall or may be made by any other Person or Persons whatsoever, and hither
Imported, shall be of no manner of Force or Validity in any Courts, or on any
Occasion or Occasions within the Island aforesaid.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every
Person and Persons whatsoever, that shall hither Import and expose to Sail any
of the aforesaid Statute-Books not Printed by the said William Rawlin, his
Executors, Administrators or Assigns, that he or they shall forfeit for each
Book so Imported and Sold, the Sum of Forty Shillings; one Moiety thereof to
his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, and the other Moiety to the said William
Rawlin, his Executors, Administrators or Assigns, the same to be recovered
before any Justice of the Peace within this Island (as in Case of Servants
Wages) due Proof being made thereof.

Provided always, and it is the true Intent and Meaning of this Act, that the
said William Rawlin, his Executors or Assigns, within Two Years after the
Publication hereof, shall be obliged, and are hereby obliged to cause the said
Laws to be Printed, and hither transmitted for the Use of the Inhabitants of
this Island, he the said William Rawlin and his Assigns, having the sole
Benefit of the Impression and Sale thereof.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the said William
Rawlin, or any other Clerk of the Assembly for the time being, have hereby full
Power and Authority (while Clerk of the Assembly) to Print all Laws and Acts
for the future, which shall be passed by the Governor, Council and Assembly.

Imployers, whereby the Affairs of the several Ships are much hindered and
prejudiced, and great Damage sustained, besides the unnecessary Expenses of
several the said Seamen in many the said Taverns and Alehouses: And by reason

No 10. An ACT for the keeping clear the Wharfs or Landing Places at the Indian
Bridge, and on Speght's- Bay, alias Little-Bristol.
WHereas many Merchants, Storehouse-keepers and other Persons, who having
Goods, Merchandises and other Commodities imported to this Island, after the
Landing thereof, care not in any reasonable time to remove and take away the
same; so that the Wharfs or Landing-Places are greatly stopped, and as it were

Repealed.

No 12. An ACT that the bringing Writs of Errors, and other Equitable Matters,
before the Governor and Council, to be by them determined, be and do continue
in Force, according to the Ancient Customs of this Island.
WHereas for the speedy and due Administration of Justice, and Right to all, it
has anciently been the Custom and common Practices within this Island, for the
Governor and Council, to hear and determine all Writs of Errors, Petitions of
Grievances, and all other Equitable Matters whatsoever, which have come, and
been presented before them, either at their private Meeting as Governor and
Council, or as they held and set in General Sessions. And whereas, also the
same Custom and Practice has continued from the Settlement of this Island, and
being exercised by the Governor and Council successively, as adjudged by the
representative Body of this Island, to be the best and most expedient means of
administering equal Right to the People. It is therefore the Desire of the
Gentlemen of the Assembly, to the Governor and Council, that it may be Enacted
and Ordained.

And be it Enacted and Ordained, by the Governor, Council and Assembly, That
the said Custom and Usage of hearing and determining all Writs of Error,
Petitions of Equitable Causes, and other such like Matters, by and before the
Governor and Council, do continue and be in force, according to the ancient
Custom and Practice within this Island: Any Law to the contrary
notwithstanding. Dated the Fifteenth Day of January, 1655.

No 13. An ACT concerning Vestries.
WHereas it has been taken into serious Consideration, how burdensome,
grievous and intolerable it is to the Inhabitants of this Island, to pay the
Assessments and Levies which have been made, laid and imposed upon them by the
several Vestries of the Parishes of this Island, by a Power granted them by a
former Statute, whereby many one's Estates have been exhausted and taken from
them, to make Payment of the said Assessments and Levies. Which to prevent for
the future, and to reduce such their Power to a limited and known lawful way
of Assessing and Levying,

It is hereby Enacted, Published and Declared, That no Assessment or Levy
whatsoever, either upon Land, or by the Head, which shall be made by any Vestry
of this Island, shall be of Force or Validity against any Person or Persons
charged for Payment of the same, Assessments to be confirmed by Governor and
Council.
until such Assessment and Levy shall have received a Confirmation by the
Governor and Council, either for Approbation thereof, or otherwise determining
of the same, as to them shall seem just and reasonable; any former Act to the
contrary notwithstanding; which said Assessments and Levies, the said Vestries
are to present to the Governor and Council presently upon making the same, to
receive such Approbation or Determination, that there may be no stop or
hinderance in collecting the same.

And it is hereby further Ordained and Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That
all the Freeholders of every Parish within this Island, shall repair to their
respective Parish-Churches every Year successively, on the Second Monday in
January, Sixteen Persons to be the Annual Vestries.
and there by their free Voices, choose Sixteen Persons to be the Vestry-men of
their Parish for the Year ensuing; which said Vestrymen so Elected, or the
major part of them, have hereby power to manage all business of the said
Parish, to set Rates for defraying their Parish Charges, and to discharge and
perform such other Duties in behalf of their said Parish, as does belong to
their Office and the Trust reposed in them.

And the said Rates so made by them, being published Three Sundays in the
Parish Church, Rates publishing Three Sundays in the Church.
and no exception taken to it, shall be approved of, and confirmed by the
Governor and Council, and Attachment under the Governors Hand, granted for
the Levying and Raising the same. But in case exception be taken to the said
Rates, the Party grieved shall be heard, and his Tax examined, concluded and
determined by the Governor and Council before the Confirmation thereof passes
as aforesaid.

And whereas great Complaint has been made of the Neglect of the several
Persons chosen for Vestrymen to convene and meet at their appointed times to
manage and carry on their Parish-Affairs. For better proceed therein for the
future,

It is Enacted and Ordained by the Governor, Council and Assembly, One or more
Justices, to summon Vestry-men.
and by the Authority of the same, that any one or more Justices of the Peace
in any the Parishes within this Island, have hereby power (as occasion shall
require) to Summon and Convene at the Parish-Churches, the respective
Vestry-men, Churchwardens and others of their Parish-Officers, to debate and
consult about the Parish and Church Concernments, and whatsoever Vestry-man,
Churchwarden or other Officer so required, to appear (such notice being given
at his House) shall fail to convene and meet accordingly (such excuse being not
given or sent, as the said Justice shall approve and allow of) shall forfeit
Five Hundred Pounds of Muscovadoe Sugar, Five Hundred Pounds of Muscovadoe
Sugar, forfeit for nonappearance.
to be levied by warrant of Distress, from the said Justice or Justices, to the

defraying other Parish Duties or Charges, the Constable to be allowed Ten per
Cent. for his Distress; and in case of Refusal, to be committed to the common
Goal, until he shall perform the same.

No 14. An ACT for limitting the Assemblies Continuance.
WHereas by sad experience we have found, That the long setting of
Representatives has been the occasion of many Factions and Divisions, and of
great Distraction in the whole Nation and the People that chose them, though
they be never so much unsatisfied or displeased with their Actions, cannot by
reason of their unlimited Election, put a seasonable end to the power which
they have given them. For Prevention therefore of the evils which such a Custom
may possibly bring on the Inhabitants of this Island.

Be it Ordained and Enacted by the Governor, Council and Assembly, and by
Authority of the same; That this present Assembly, No Assembly to set but one
Year.
nor any future Assembly to be held within this Island, shall be and continue
any longer, than for one whole Year from their time of first meeting, as an
Assembly, fully to be complete and ended. And the Elections now lately, and
which hereafter shall be made of Freeholders to set in the Assembly, shall
(though the same be not expressed) be held, deemed and adjudged to be an
Election to continue of force, no longer than for, and during the Term of One
Year, and to be reckoned from the time of their first meeting as aforesaid: Any
former Law, Custom or Usage to the contrary hereof notwithstanding. August the
6th, 1660.

No 15. An ACT or Order for the Publication and Execution of the Acts
concerning the Uniformity of Common Prayer.
WHereas diverse opinionated and self-conceited Persons have declared an
absolute Dislike to the Government of the Church of England, as well by their
aversion and utter neglect or refusal of the Prayers, Sermons and Adminstration
of the Sacraments, and other Rights and Ordinances thereof used in their
several Parish-Churches, as by holding Conventicles in Private Houses and other
Places, scandalizing Ministers, and endeavoring to seduce others to their
Erroneous Opinions, upon Pretense of an alteration of Church Government in
England. All which their Misdemeanors, have begotten many Distractions, a great
Reproach and Disparagement to the Church and Ministry, and Disturbance of the
Government of this Island: For Suppression of which their disorderly Courses,

It is hereby Ordered, Published and Declared, and all Persons whatsoever
inhabiting or resident, All People to give due Obedience to the Government of
the Church of England.
or which shall inhabit or reside in this Island, are in his Majesty's Name
strictly hereby charged and commanded, That they and every of them from
henceforth give due obedience, and conform themselves unto the Government and
Discipline of the Church of England, as the same has been established by
several Acts of Parliament, and especially those which are at large expressed
in the fronts of most English Bibles. Which Acts of Parliament, the Ministers
of every Church and Chapel in this Island, are hereby required to read
publicly and distinctly in their several Parish-Churches and Chapels; that
thereby all Persons may know what is their Duty in this behalf, and the Penalty
they incur by their Contempt and Neglect thereof; which all that appear faulty
in, must expect to have strictly put in Execution against them.

And all Justices of the Peace, Ministers, Churchwardens and other his
Majesty's Officers of this Island, that may give furtherance to the execution
of the aforesaid Acts, are hereby required in his Majesty's Name, to do their
Endeavor therein to the utmost of their Powers, as they tender their several
Duties to Almighty God, and their Allegiance to our Sovereign Lord the King,
and the due Execution of their several Places and Offices whereto they are
called.

No 16. An ACT concerning Morning and Evening Prayer in Families.
THat Almighty God may be Served and Glorified, and that he give a Blessing to
our Labors,

It is hereby Enacted, That all Masters and Overseers of Families, Morning and
Evening Prayers to be said in Families.
have Prayers openly Said or Read every Morning and Evening with his Family,
upon Penalty of Forty Pounds of Sugar, the one half to the Informer, the other
half to the public Treasury of this Island.

That all Masters of Families that live within Two Miles of their Parish Church
or Chapel, All that live within Two Miles, to hear Prayers twice daily.
shall duly repair thereto, Morning and Evening, on the Sabbath, with their
Families, to hear Divine Service; and they which live above Two Miles from such
Church or Chapel, to repair to such Church once a Month at least, Above Two
Miles once in a Month at least.
under Forfeiture according to the Law of England in such Case provided. If a
Servant make Default of repairing to the Church according to the true intent of
this Act; if the Fault be in his Master, then his Master is to pay Ten Pounds
of Cotton for every such Default; if the neglect be in the Servant, he is to be
punished at the Discretion of the next Justice of the Peace.

That every Minister begin Morning Prayers every Sunday, by Nine of the Clock
in the Morning, and Preach once that Day at least.

And forasmuch as little care has been observed to be taken by Parents or
Masters of Families for the instruction of their Children or Servants under
Years of Discretion, in the Fundamentals of Christian Religion, or the
knowledge of God, and as little Endeavors used therein by any the Ministers of
this Island: So that Religion comes thereby to be scandalized, and the Worship
of God contemned, and all manner of Vices through the ignorance of Persons
attaining Maturity of Years, encouraged and countenanced. And for the better
information therefore, of all sorts of Persons concerning God and the true
Religion,

It is Ordained and Enacted, by the Governor, Council and Assembly, and by the
Authority of the same, That the respective Ministers of this Island, in their
several Parish-Churches or Chapels of Ease, on every Sunday in the Afternoon,
do there publicly exercise the duty of Preaching, That Ministers are to Preach
or Catechize every Sunday.
or of the catechizing and questioning all the Youth and others that shall come
before them, in the points of the Christian Faith, and endeavor by such

No 21. An ACT for the good governing of Servants, and ordering the Rights
between Masters and Servants.
WHereas much of the Interest and Substance of this Island, consists in the
Servants brought to, and disposed of in the same, and in their Labor during
the Term they have to serve, wherein notwithstanding Provision has been made
by many good Laws, yet great and often Damage has happened to the People of
this Place through the Unruliness, Obstinacy and Refractoriness of the Servants.

And whereas also it much concerns the Peace of this Island, that a continual
strict course should be taken to prevent the bold Extravagancies and wandering
of Servants, who frequently run from, and desert their Master's Service, making
use of all advantages and occasions to disturb the public Peace, and prejudice
their Masters:

Wherefore the President, Council and Assembly, upon serious and mature
consideration of the Premises, and for the good regulating and governing of
Servants in all things concerning their Masters and themselves, during the time
they have to serve by Indenture or otherwise, and as well concerning such
Servants Wages, have thought fit to Enact, Ordain and Publish; and it is
Enacted, Ordained and Published by the President, Council and Assembly, and by
the Authority of the same, That no Person whatsoever shall presume to bring
into this Island, any Children of the English Nation, or the Dominions
thereunto belonging, None to be brought here under Fourteen Years of Age.
to be sold as Servants, under the Age of Fourteen Years, unless they can
produce a good Certificate, or an Indenture or Writing from the Principal
Persons of the Parish, wherein the said Child last lived, that it is done with
their consent, or with the consent, or at the request of the Parents of such
Child; the Age of such Child or Servant to be judged by Inspection.

And whosoever shall do otherwise, shall upon Conviction by sufficient
Testimony, or the Parties Confession before the President or the Superior
Officer of the Island for the time being, be imprisoned by the said President
or Superior Officer's Warrant, until he has given in Security by recognizance
of Two sufficient Freeholders of this Island, in One Hundred Pounds Sterling,
to the Secretary for the time being, that he will return such Child or Children
unto their Parents or Guardians, or such as have or should have the keeping of
them, and of his Performance thereof, to bring or send a Certificate within
Twelve Months next ensuing, proved as aforesaid.

And whereas it has been an ill Custom and Usage of diverse Merchants and other
Persons coming to this Island, indirectly and by delusive means and practices
to obtain Men and Women on Board of Ships in England, so cause them to be
Transported hither, and are here disposed of to serve according to the Custom
of the Country, having no Indenture, Covenant or Contract for the same.

It is therefore hereby further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority
aforesaid, That from, and after publication hereof, all Persons so indirectly
sent, Against bringing Servants against their Wills.
or brought over, the Master of them, or Persons, to whom they are consigned,
or who are concerned therein, having no Covenant, Indenture or Contract made in
Writing, or other Verbal Agreement by him or them to be proved by the Oath of
one or more Witnesses, or by the Servant's Confession, That such Servant came
with his own Consent or Knowledge, That all such Persons so brought over, have
hereby power, and are at liberty to implead the Persons who brought them, or to
whom they are consigned, according to the Laws of England, for their Freedom,
and to recover their Damages and Satisfaction for such wrongful and injurious
dealing. Provided that he or she declare the same, and make his or her
Complaint to some Justice of the Peace within Thirty Days after his or her
Landing in this Island, unless they be prevented by Si kness, and then within
Thirty Days after he or she is able.

And all Servants whose time shall expire at any time hereafter, having had no
Indenture or Contract, shall receive for their Wages Four Hundred Pounds of
good Muscovadoe Sugar: The ascertaining of Servants Wages.
And in case of Indenture or Covenant, to be paid according to his Covenant or
Indenture; as the ancient Usage and Custom of this Island has been. And
whatsoever Servant shall hereafter come to this Island, and serve their Time
therein by Indenture or otherwise, The last Master to pay the Wages.
shall receive as aforesaid (the last Master always to pay the said Wages.)

Against Trading with Servants.
It is further Enacted, Ordained and Published by the Authority aforesaid, That
no Freeman or Trader whatsoever, presume to buy or sell any Commodities
whatsoever, with any Servant or Slave within this Island, without the consent
of the Master or Owner of such Servant or Slave, Forfeiture.

the Master or Owner of such Servant: And all Contracts and Covenants so made by
such Servant or Slave, to be utterly void and of no effect: And such Trader or

Sugar, the one half to the Informer, the other half to the Treasurer for the
public use, the same to be recovered by Action in any Court of Record within
this Island.

It is further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That whatsoever

Provisions, or Commodities whatsoever, shall upon Conviction of every such
Offense, by one or more Testimonies upon Oath, before any of his Majesty's
Justices of the Peace within this Island, or the Parties own Confession, be
adjudged by the said Justices of the Peace, to serve his said Master or
Mistress Two Years after the said time, by Indenture, Custom or Bargain, is
expired without any consideration of Wages or Sallary to be paid him, and be
further liable, in case that time of Servitude will not make full Satisfaction.
And whereas many Women Servants are begotten with Child by Freemen or Servants,

and by the Authority of the same, that whosoever shall beget a Woman-Servant

in case of the said Child's Death, before the said Three Years be expired, that
then the said Person is only to serve the said Owner One Year: But if the said
Woman-Servant shall happen to Dye, or become infirm, by reason of her Labor in

or otherwise be expired; the same to be ordered by the next Justice of the
Peace, before whom such Proof thereof shall be made. And for the better
understanding therein,

It is hereby Ordained and Enacted, by the Authority aforesaid, That the same
Proof or Evidence that is sufficient to prove the reputed Father of a Bastard,
by which he is obliged to discharge the Parish whose it shall be, or to keep
the same, shall be as authentic to a Jury, to cause the Father of a Bastard to
make reparation to the Master or Mistress of such Woman-Servant upon whom the
same is begotten; as is before appointed. But if a Servant shall beget a
Woman-Servant with Child, then after his Time is expired, he shall serve the
Owner of the said Woman Servant double the time she had to serve at the time of
the Offense committed.

Item, Be it further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, Of

Item, It is further Ordained and Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That when
any Difference shall arise between Master and Servant, in and concerning the
time of their Servitude, or Term of Years that they are to serve, Suits between
Masters and Servants for time, to be referred to the Common Law.

be heard and determined at Common Law, in the Court of the Precincts wherein
such Master or Servant shall then live and abide, as in other Cases of Right
between Party and Party.

And that all Servants who have occasion or ground to commence Suit therein,
What time to be allowed them for the prosecution of their Suits. Two only out

Mistress one whole Day after his Time by Indenture or Custom is expired. So
that the same do not in the whole exceed Three Years; and so in proportion for

It having been formerly a great Complaint, that many Masters, when their
Servants grow Sick, and unable to perform their daily Labor, will seem to
remit some part of the time, to be cleared of them; or turn them off, Against
turning away Sick Servants.
to the intent they may not be chargeable to them for their Recovery; Whereby
many of the said Servants may most miserably perish, or become a Charge to the
Parish where they first happen to be laid up. For Prevention whereof for the
future, and duly punishing such inhumane Acts in such Persons as shall become
guilty of the same,

It is hereby Ordained and Enacted, by the President, Council and Assembly, and
by the Authority of the same, That what Master, Mistress or Governor of

Mistress then formerly; For Satisfaction of such Master or Mistress in every
such case, the said Servant shall serve his or her said Master or Mistress

No 22. An ACT concerning the Conveyance of Estates.
WHereas several old Acts made before the Usurped Power took Place in our
Nation, much concerning the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of the Possessions of
the Inhabitants of this Island, and the clearing their Titles to the same, have
been altered, and in some measure impaired during those Times; and that the
true intent and meaning of them are by many mistaken or mis-understood. To the
intent therefore, that the respective Freeholders may be better informed
touching the said Laws, and of the Benefit belonging to them thereby,

It is Ordained by the President, Council and Assembly, That the said Acts be
forthwith published in their several Parish-Churches within this Island, hereby
declaring, that the said Acts being made by and under his Majesty, the only
lawful Authority, and still of Force, and have been ever since the time of
their first Enacting; An old Law restored.
which Laws follow in these Words. For that the King's Writs do not run here,
whereby Fines and Recoveries cannot be here had and levied as in England, and
yet here is as much and more use and need of them; for that few Men come to
this Island with any intention to settle themselves and Posterities; but for
the most part to gain or increase their Estates, and then to sell their Lands
and return; which oftentimes cannot well be done, nor with Security to the
Purchasers for want of such Fines and Recoveries, without some Act be made to
supply the same.

Be it therefore Enacted, by the President, Council and general Assembly of
this Island, That a Deed in due Form of Law made, A Deed acknowledged and
recorded in Three Months, sufficient to pass an Estate without Livery or
Attornment.
and within Three Months after the Date thereof, be acknowledged before the
Resident Governor for the time being, or before some other of the chief Judges
for the time being, of some one of the Courts of Justice within this Island, by
all the Parties that pass or grant away, or Lease for above the Term of Three
Years, any Freehold or Inheritance by such Deed, or by so many of them, as
there shall be living; or by any other Person or Persons lawfully authorized
under Hand and Seal, to convey or grant the same. ( So that the same be
recorded at length in the Secretaries Office of this Island within the said
Three Months) shall be valid, to pass the same without Livery, Attornment, or
any other Act or Ceremony whatsoever. And that no Deed hereafter without such
acknowledgment and inrollment shall pass any Estate of Freehold or Inheritance,
or any Lease above the number of Three Years.

Item, Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Married
Woman shall be minded to alien her Jointure, How a Feme Covert may sell her
Estate.
Dower or any other her Estate of Freehold or Inheritance within this Island,
or any part thereof, whether it be joint or in severalty, and do make any
Writing under her Hand and Seal, to convey the same, and come before the
Governor, or any other chief Judge of some of the Courts of Justice within
this Island, To tell her what the Deed is, and the Estate she sells.
to acknowledge the same: Then such Governor or Judge shall acquaint her what

Plead the general Issue, give the Special matter in Evidence.


or against any Person employed by them, or any of them, or authorized by this
Act to do or perform, as by this Act is directed for doing or performing as
aforesaid. That then, and in every such Case, the Action shall be laid in the
proper Precinct where the Fact was done, and not elsewhere. And the Defendant
may plead the general Issue to it, and give the special matter in Evidence at
the Trial, that what was done, was done in pursuance of this Act. And if upon
Examination it shall appear to be done, then the Jury shall find for the
Defendant. And in such case also, if the Plaintiff shall be nonsuited, or
discontinue his Action after the Defendant has appeared, the Defendant shall
have his full Costs, what upon Oath he shall make appear to any Judge, before
whom such Trial or dis-continuance is had, he laid out in defense of such Suit,
and also one Thousand Pounds of Sugar more, in regard of this unjust trouble
and vexation taxed by the Court against the Plaintiff.

And be it further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That every
Surveyor elected or hereby appointed as aforesaid, Surveyors to give Account to
the Vestry, at the end of the Year.
shall Yearly within one Month after the expiration of the Year wherein he was
so Surveyor, make and yield up to the Vestry of the said Parish, a true and
perfect Account in Writing, at some public Meeting, to be appointed by the

or by reason of his said Office, namely, of whom and what received, and to whom
and what paid. And if any Overplus do remain in his Hands, he shall pay the
same over to the next Surveyors, or one of them then in being, for the use of
the said Parish, to be disbursed in and about the Highways.

And if such Surveyor shall refuse or neglect to make such Account or
Re-payment as aforesaid, That then it shall be lawful, to and for any one of
his Majesty's Justices of the Peace within the Parish or Precinct, and upon
such Default found on the Surveyor's part, to commit such Surveyor to the
common Goal, To stand committed until they account.
there to remain without Bail or Mainprize, until he shall make such Account
and Payment as aforesaid: Together with such satisfaction for the Damage, as
the said Vestry and Parish have sustained by reason of such neglect, and as any
one Justice shall judge reasonable. But if the said Justice shall find such
Account to be clear and good, then he is to allow the same; and such Surveyor
is not afterward to be questioned or troubled thereabouts.

And whereas several Persons for their private Commodity, have, or hereafter
shall in the Highways, which run through Plantations, erected Gates; through
which, all Travelers being necessitated to pass the same, by reason of the
Narrowness thereof, becomes in Wet Weather, very Deep, and almost Impassable;
to the great Trouble and Damage of his Majesty's Liege People. For Remedy
whereof,

Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all such Gate-Places on
the public Road, The Dimention of Gates and Gate-ways on all common Roads.
shall be at least Ten Foot in wideness, between Post and Post; and they shall
be made at the Charge of the Owner of the said Land, where such Gate shall be,
within Three Months after Publication hereof: A good, firm and sufficient
Causeway, or firm Gravel Path, of the full wideness of the said Gate, and to
extend in length Twenty Foot of each side of the said Gate, and shall
continually keep the same in Repair. And in case any Person so having a Gate as
aforesaid, shall neglect to make it of the said wideness, or to make the
Causeway within the time aforesaid; Punishment of Offenders.
he shall forfeit Two Thousand Pounds of Sugar, to be levied and disposed of in
manner as aforesaid; and shall likewise forfeit for every Three Months after
that he shall neglect the same, the quantity of Two Thousand Pounds of Sugar,
until he has made the said Causeway, as is in this Act prescribed. And after
the said Causeway made, if the said Person shall neglect to Repair the same,
within Twenty Days after he is ordered to do it, by the Surveyors of that
Parish, or by any one of them, he shall forfeit for every such Default, One
Thousand Pounds of Sugar, to be levied and employed as aforesaid.

And the Surveyors of the several Parishes are hereby empowered and required,

to take away all Rails that shall be put up in any common Highways in the
Passage. And in case any Rails shall be so hereafter put up, the Parties shall
forfeit for every such putting them up, Two Hundred Pounds of Sugar, to be
levied and disposed of as aforesaid.

And whereas the Highways in open Ground are in many Places already by Fences
reduced to a narrower scantling than by this Act is required, which now to
widen, might be of great Damage to the Owners of the Land of each side of the
said way: For Prevention whereof,

Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if the Owners of the
said Land, do within one Month after Publication hereof, In old narrow Paths,
Causeways to be made by the Land Owners.
make a firm, plain and sufficient Causeway or Gravel Path between the said
Fences, (provided the same be broad enough for Two Carts to pass each against
other) and also to enter into Bond for One Hundred Pounds Sterling, to the
Surveyors of the said Parish for the time being, and their Successors, for the
use of the said Parish, constantly to keep the same in good Repair; If not
made, and to keep Hedges, to be pulled down.
Then and in such case, the Surveyors of the Highways, shall forbear to beat
down the said Fences, or widen the said Way: Any thing in this Act seeming to
the contrary notwithstanding.

Whereas it has been taken into consideration, that if the Parishes nearest
adjoining to the Seaside, should at their own proper Costs and Charges,
maintain their Highways and Causeways, it might possibly become
over-burthensome unto them, in regard their Ways be nearer the Center, and are
more in number, and more used and worn; of which the Parishes farther off, have
the Benefit and Convenience; and therefore it seems most equitable, Adjoining
Parishes to contribute to the mending of the Highways.
that they should in some measure contribute toward the Maintenance and Repair
of them. For which purpose,

Be it further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That upon all
extraordinary Occasions of Charge in reparation as aforesaid, of the Highways,
Causeways, Gravel, Paths or Bridges in the Parishes nearest the Sea, such
reasonable Contribution shall be made out of the Parish Stock, by the Surveyors
of those respective Parishes which have the benefit of such Reparations,
General Sessions to order the Quantum.
as to the Justices of the Peace at the general Sessions upon hearing the whole
Matter, shall be judged fit and reasonable.

Item, If any Justice of the Peace shall refuse or neglect to perform that
Duty, which by this Act is required of him; A Justice refusing or neglecting
his Duty, to be fined 10000 Pound of Sugar.
Such Justice upon Conviction thereof by the Oath of Two Witnesses, or his own
Confession before the Commander in chief for the time being, and any Two more
of the Council, shall be adjudged to forfeit the Quantity of Ten Thousand
Pounds of Muscovadoe Sugar, and to stand committed, until he have paid the same
into the Hands of the Surveyors of the said Parish where the said Default was
made, to be disposed of for the use of the Highways as aforesaid.

And lastly, Be it Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That all
Acts, Laws and Statutes formerly Made, All former Acts and Statutes are void,
that are made to this purpose.
Enacted and Ordained, for, and concerning any broad Paths or Highways within
this Island, and provided for in this Act or any Clause thereof, be and are
hereby declared to be void and null, to all intents and purposes whatsoever:
Any Law, Usage or Custom to the contrary notwithstanding. January the Ninth,

No 42. An ACT for the certain and constant appointment of all Officers Fees
within this Island.
WHereas the Fees for the respective Offices of this Island, are by an Act of
the Governor, Council and Assembly, settled for a time uncertain; by means
whereof it may be understood to be a Settlement to perpetuity, which was not
the intention of the said Act; the Authority of this Place always intending to
reserve a power in themselves, at any time when they shall see fit, to make the
several Fees more or less.

Be it therefore Ordained and Enacted by the Governor, Council and Assembly,
and by the Authority of the same, That from henceforth no establishment of
Fees, be continued in force longer than the Twenty Fifth Day of March next. And
after that time, no establishment be made, of any the Fees aforesaid, for any
longer time than Six Months. But if the Governor, Council and Assembly, shall
omit at the expiration of the time aforesaid, or in any of the Six Months
after; That then the Fees before Established, continue and be in force, until

No 44. An ACT for the Relief of such Persons as lie in Prison, and others who

WHereas it has been taken into consideration, the extreme Poverty of several
Poor Persons within this Island, and their Inability to satisfy their several
Creditors, and by reason thereof, suffer long and tedious Imprisonment, without
any hope of Relief therein.

It is therefore hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Governor, Council and
Assembly, That all such Persons who are in Prison, and all others that have no
other way to satisfy their several Creditors and Judgment for the same obtained
against him, shall, if they will thereunto submit, be ordered and appointed by
the Judge and Assistants of the Precincts wherein he lives, or wherein such
Judgment was obtained, to serve such of his or their Creditors, that will give
the greatest Wages per Month, for his or their Servitude, until such Judgment
had, or Debts by him or them owing, shall be fully satisfied.

Provided the said Debt or Debts, exceed not Two Thousand Pounds of Sugar. And
in case there shall be any fraudulent Contracts or Agreements between the
Debtors and Creditors, that in such cases the Judge or his Assistants shall
revoke their Orders, and prosecute the Offenders, as in case of Fraud: Any Law,
Usage or Custom heretofore to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

No 46. An Addition to an ACT, Entitled, An Act for Settling the Estates and

of this Island, that are in quiet possession of any Lands or Tenements, by
virtue of any Warrant from any former Governors, or by Conveyance or other Act
in Law from them who had the same Warrant, shall have, hold and enjoy the same
as their free Estate.

And whereas since some Scruples have arisen whether an Estate for Life or
Inheritance may be construed from the same for want of these Words (their
Heirs) To the intent the same may be more fully explained, and all Disputes of
that kind for the future abolished,

Be it therefore Enacted and Declared by the Governor, Council and Assembly,
that by these Words (as their Free Estates) was meant, the whole Estate and
Inheritance of the respective Plantations within this Island. So that by such
Possession in manner as by the said Act is expressed, the said Inhabitants are
hereby adjudged and declared to have and hold their Lands of Right to them, to
dispose of or alienate, or otherwise to descend or be confirmed to their Heirs
for ever.

No 47. An ACT for Settling the several Markets in the several Towns of this
Island.
Repealed by Act 98.

No 48. An ACT for the Encouragement of such as shall plant or raise Provisions
to sell.
WHereas diverse the Inhabitants of this Island have been discouraged from
planting and raising Provisions to sell, in regard of the tedious Payments, are
many times made, and the great trouble of Prosecution of the same at Common
Law. For Prevention whereof for the future,

Be it Enacted and Ordained by the President, Council and Assembly, One
possessed of 20 Acres or under, for Provisions sold, may recover before a
Justice.
and by the Authority of the same, That all Planters Possessed but of Twenty
Acres of Land, or under, that shall after Publication hereof, sell any sort of
Provisions of the growth or produce of this Island, shall, and have hereby
power to prosecute any Person for any Debt accrewing by such Sale, before any
Justice of the Peace within the Parish or Precinct, and recover the same in
such manner and form, as Servants and Laborers are empowered to recover their
Wages by virtue of an Act in that Case made and provided. And all Justices of
the Peace respectively, are hereby empowered to do the same accordingly. Dated
the 13th of March, 1661.

No 49. An ACT Entitled, An Acknowledgment and Declaration of the Inhabitants
of the Island of Barbados, of his Majesty's Right to the Dominions of this
Island, and the Right of the Right Honorable the Earl of Carlisle, derived

Lord Willoughby of Parham; and also for the Unanimous Profession of the true
Religion in this Island, and imposing condign Punishment upon the Opposers
thereof.
The Reason of this Act ceases. Repealed.

No 50. An ACT concerning the Sale of Lands by Attorneys, Executors and
Administrators.
WHereas it has been a long received Custom in this Island, for Attorneys,
Executors and Administrations to make Sale of Land of their Principals,
Testators and Intestates. And forasmuch as it evidently appears unto all Men,
that the greatest part of the possessors of Land in this Island, sold no Land
by no other Title, although they have given very valuable considerations for
the same.

The Governor and the Assembly having taken the Premises into their
consideration, and well weighing the mischievous consequence which must
necessarily follow, if the validity of such Sale should be questioned, Do
hereby Enact, Declare and Publish, That all Sales already made unto this Day by
any of the Persons before recited, to the behoof of any Principals, Testators
or Intestates, shall be as firm and valid unto the Purchasers, their Heirs and
Assigns, as if they had been made by the Principals themselves, or by the
Testators or Intestates themselves.

hold by Merchants or by any Title derived from them, shall likewise be

disturbance.

No 54. An ACT for the doubling the Impositions of all sorts of Strong Liquors
imported this Island.
Obsolete, and other Acts made since to the same purpose.

WHereas the present Governor, Council and Assembly, have signified by a late
Declaration bearing date the Seventh Day of March instant, that the Government
of this Place shall be according to the Laws of England, and of this Island, as
has been heretofore used and practiced. And for that nothing more conduces to
the good and quiet of any Place and People, than the assuring and ascertaining
such Laws and Statutes as they are to be governed and regulated by. And to take
off all pretense of Ignorance of the same for the future,

It is therefore Ordained and Enacted by the Governor, Council and
Representatives of the Inhabitants of this Island now Assembled, What Laws of
this Island are ascertained.
That all such Acts and Statutes as have been made and published in this
Island, or viewed, corrected and confirmed by any Governor and Council, or

contrary notwithstanding.

And it is hereby further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That Philip Bell,
Commissioners appointed to collect such Laws of this Island, as shall be in
force.
Esquire, Robert Hooper, Esquire, Constant Silvester, Simon Lambert, John
Jennings and Richard Evans, Esquires, and Mr. Edward Bowden, Secretary; do with
what convenient speed they can, collect and compile all the Acts and Statutes
in force as aforesaid, and them cause to be fairly and distinctly entered and
enrolled by the Secretary of this Island into one Book entirely by themselves,
without being mixed or confused with any the Laws, Acts or Statutes made void
as aforesaid. Which Acts and Statutes so Transcribed, Entered and Enrolled, and
none other, shall be, and be taken and esteemed to be, the Acts and Statutes in
Force, made in this Island; any Declaration, Order or Ordinance to the contrary
notwithstanding. And to the end the Inhabitants of this Island may be made
sensible of the said Acts by the publication of them, and that the Secretary of
this Island in this time of much business, as much as may be eased.

It is further Ordained and Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That one Fair
Copy of all the said Acts, The said Laws to be transcribed and published in
every Parish.
when Transcribed and Engrossed as aforesaid, shall be fairly written out and
attested by the said Secretary, and sent to the Minister of the Parish of St.
Michael, to be by him published in the said Parish Church the next Sunday, and
so from thence to some other Parish, to be published the Sunday after that; and
so successively from Parish to Parish, to the end and purpose it may on the Ten
next succeeding Sundays be published in the other Ten Parish-Churches of this
Island; this to be done and conveyed to the several Ministers of the respective
Parishes, by the Provost Marshal or his Deputy.

And that Copy so attested and published as aforesaid, to be by the Provost
Marshal returned to the Clerk of the Assembly, to be by him kept with the Books
of the Assemblies Proceedings: Provided that this Act nor any thing therein
contained, shall be construed to give liberty to any Person, to assign Errors

Eighth Day of February last past.

It is also Ordained and Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That in regard the
public Seal appointed by his Majesty, that now is, to the Right Honorable
Francis Lord Willoughby of Parham, for this and the rest of the Charibbee
Islands, cannot at present be had to affix to this Act, according to the
appointment of his Sacred Majesty in his Grant to the said Lord Willoughby,
bearing Date the Twelfth of June, in the Fifteenth Year of his Majesty's Reign:
The present Governors subscribing their Names to this Act, shall be deemed as
effectual, and of as full force and authority, to all intents and purposes, as
if the said Public Seal were thereunto affixed.

Given under our Hands, the Twenty Second Day of March, 1666. Henry Willoughby,
Henry Hawley, Samuel Barwick.

damnified by the Burning or setting on Fire the said Sugar Canes, for the Term

make Restitution and Satisfaction to the Party so damnified, according to the
nature and quality of the Damage. Provided that this Statute extend not to any
that shall burn or set on Fire their own Sugar Cane Fields, so that it be not
prejudicial to any other. And whereas several Fields of Canes and Pasture have
of late been fired, accidentally by carrying of Fire, and smoking of Tobacco
in Paths where Canes are planted on either side, to the great Loss and Damage
of several the Inhabitants of this Island,

It is therefore hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Governor, Council and
Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, That whatsoever Person or Persons
shall after Publication hereof, presume to carry Fire, or take any Tobacco in
any Path where Sugar Canes are planted on both sides of the same Path, or near
to any Planted Canes, upon Conviction before any Justice of the Peace (who is
hereby authorized to hear the same) by the Oath of one or more Witness, or the
Parties own Confession, shall pay, and forfeit Five Hundred Pounds of Sugar for
every such Offense so committed; and in case the Person contrary to this Act
offending as aforesaid, shall not be able to pay the said Forfeiture, such
Person or Persons shall upon Conviction as aforesaid, by order of the said
Justice of the Peace, have and receive Twenty Lashes upon his bare Back, the
same to be executed by the next Constable, the said Fine to be paid in to the
Commissioners for the Highways of that Precinct where the Offense was
committed.

Affairs.
Obsolete.

The Preceding Collection of Laws were by an Act of this Island Ordained and
Established to be in full and absolute Force and Virtue, and were duly
published in all the Parishes of this Island, and returned to the Clerk of the
Assembly, as more fully appears by an Attestation under their several Hands:
The Original whereof is affixed to the Assembly Book of Acts: And also the
aforesaid Acts were sent to England for his Majesty's Approbation, and have
been fully approved and confirmed by his Sacred Majesty to be of full force and
authority in this Island.

The Return of the Commissioners is contained in the Words following, Viz. WE
the Committee appointed for the Compiling of the Laws, having caused them to be
Collected and Transcribed, as appears by a Writing under our Hands, expressed
in the Page, the first Line entered in this Book, and are therein expressed, and
be comprehended in One Hundred Fifty Three Sheets of Paper; which being now
fairly engrossed in this Book, do appear to be Fifty Eight Laws, and are
comprehended in Fifty Eight next preceding Pages. And to the end, that one
first Declaration may be rightly understood, in regard that relates to the One
Hundred Fifty Three Sheets of Paper, wherein the Laws were first digested, We
have thought good here to insert this present Explanation.

FOrasmuch as it has been in the power of the Governor of this Island, from

Surreptitious Practices, Patents have been obtained and procured from his
Majesty, by Persons very unfit for a Place of such Trust, to the great

for the discharge of the said Place, We the Representatives of this Island of
Barbados, do humbly pray your Excellency, that it may be Ordained and Enacted.

WHereas it has been an ancient Usage even from the First Establishment of the
Courts of Judicature in this Island, that the several chief Judges in their
Courts of Common Pleas, have always from time to time, as occasion has
afforded, made choice of, and appointed Clerks and Marshals to attend the said
Courts, and the former issuing forth all Precepts, and entering upon Record all
such Matters, as have concerned the said Courts: And the other executing all
Warrants, Writs, Executions and other Precepts issuing from thence.

And whereas upon just Complaint made against the said Clerks and Marshals for
their Neglect or other Miscarriage, the said Judges have had power to Discharge
them, and place others in their stead, who should be more careful and diligent
in the execution of their Offices.

And whereas the Judges of this Island have no Sallary or Allowance from His

do humbly pray your Excellency, that it may be Ordained and Enacted,

And it is hereby Ordained and Enacted, by his Excellency, William Lord

No 83. An ACT for Relief of such Poor Persons as have much suffered by the
late afflicting Hand of God.
Obsolete.

No 84. An ACT to prevent Forceable and Clandestine Entries into any Lands or
Tenements within this Island.
FOrasmuch as great care has been had for diverse Years past, for the quieting,
settling and ascertaining all Men's Rights and Possessions in, and to their Lands
and Tenements within this Island; so as that the difficulty and determining
Men's Interests through the defects of former Grants, or the weakness of Men in
the infancy of Settlements, as to Deeds and due Forms of Law, has been of late
Years reasonably well evinced and cleared, and the limitation of time, as to
Men's Rights and Estates, Claims and Properties has been successively enlarged
and continued beyond expectation: Whereby all Capacities and Conditions of
Persons might arrive to a Challenge of any their Estates. And that it is high
time now the Possessors of Lands should in some measure be free from the daily
vexation of unwarranted Claims, Entries and secret Possessions gained by
Litigious, Troublesome and Unconcerned Persons, who notwithstanding the Courts
of Common Pleas, are open, and do hold Monthly for the determining Men's Rights;
Yet do daily vex and disturb the Inhabitants of this Island in their
Possessions and Estates, by privately setting up petty Roofs, or Thatcht
Houses, sometimes in the Night, sometimes in the Day, in the remote Bounds or
Parts of their Plantations and Lands, and by sudden and secret Entries into
Lands and Tenements, or by private ways of gaining Possession upon very
frivolous Suggestions, do pretend Right and Property. And by such Means, with
other subtle Tricks and Pretentions, meeting many times with the advantage of
ignorant Persons concurrent with their Devices, do daily trouble and put to
charge the Owners and rightful Possessors, and endanger their just Interests;
when in truth the Party so indirectly gaining Possession or Entering, has no
just cause for his so doing. And also whereas it often falls out, that upon due
Trial at the Common Law, it was found that such Entry was altogether Unlawful;
whereupon Judgment is given, that the Plaintiff shall recover his Possession
with Costs and Damages against the Defendant, whose Condition is for the most
part so desperate, that he is not able to perform the Sentence of the Law;
whereby the Plaintiff after a tedious Suit, and his Estate wasted, is left
remidiless to his intolerable Grief and Damage. For Prevention of which great
evils for the future,

It is Ordained and Enacted, by the Deputy, Governor, the Council and Assembly
of Representatives of this Island of Barbados, and by authority of the same, No
forceable Entries.
That henceforward no Person or Persons whatsoever, presume to make any
forceable Entries, or forceable Detainers into, or of any Lands, Houses or
Tenements within this Island, or presume to enter secretly into any Man's Lands,
Not to erect Huts, Hovels, Thatcht Houses to gain possession.
Houses or Tenements for gaining of Possession, by setting up any Roofs, Hutts,
Hovels, Tents or Thatcht Houses, or by any such private or secret Practices, or
other ways or means whatsoever, without due Course, Trial and Recovery at Law
first had and obtained, Forfeiture.
under Penalty of forfeiting Ten Thousand Pounds of Sugar for every Person so
offending, to the King's Majesty. And whenever any Person or Persons shall
make any such Entry and Detainer, or by any such secret Means or Ways as
aforesaid, enter into, or gain Possession of any Man's Lands, Houses or
Tenements, upon any Pretense whatsoever, contrary to this Act, without Trial
and Recovery at Law, first had and obtained, to bring into Question and Trial
the Right and Property thereof. Two Justices or one of them to remove
Possessions.
The Two next Justices of the Peace are hereby required and authorized, upon
complaint of the Party grieved, to remove such Entries and Possessions, and all
such Houses, Roofs, Huts and Thatcht-Houses, for that end so put and erected,
shall cause to be pulled down and destroyed, as if the same had never been. And
the Person or Persons so entered, possessed or holding, or found doing contrary
hereunto, shall be committed to the common Goal of this Island, there to
remain, until they have given Recognizance themselves, Offenders forfeit.

answer the same, and in the interim to keep the Peace. At which said Sessions,
the matter shall be fully examined, and the said Penalty there adjudged, and
accordingly paid into the Public Treasury of this Island. And in case of
resistance by strong Hand or Force against the said Justice or Justices
executing herein, by any Party possessed or entered as aforesaid, and contrary
to this Act; Posse Comitatus.
The said Justice or Justices are hereby authorized and required, to raise the
Power of the Country, and proceed against all the Offenders as Rioters or
Rebels. And the Justice of the Peace who shall herein fail of executing as is
hereby required, shall forfeit Ten Thousand Pounds of Sugar, Forfeiture.
the same to be recovered in any the Courts of Common Pleas within this Island,
by him that shall inform thereof, and sue for the same; the one half to the
public Treasury for the use of the Island, and the other half to the Informer.

Provided nevertheless, that this Act, Exceptions.
nor any thing therein contained, shall not extend, or be construed to reach or
extend to any entry made upon Breach of Covenants, Conditions, or any
Arrearages of Rent, or any such like case, where the Right, Title or Property
is not hereby enforced to, and intended for a Trial, or brought into question,
or to the formal Entry made for the ensealing Leases of Ejectment, or Livery of
Possessions made thereupon, if the Owner or Tenant thereby shall not be
dispossessed.

hereafter mentioned.

(Regiment, alias) Division, be changed into Goods.
Obsolete.

No 91. An ACT reducing the Interest to Ten Pounds for One Hundred in One Year.
WHereas at this time, there is a very great abatement in the Value of Land,
Sugar, Cotton, Ginger, and all other Wares and Commodities of the growth of
this Island, both here, and also in England, and other Foreign Parts whither
they are Transported: And whereas diverse Inhabitants of this Place, as well
Planters, as Merchants, Farmers of Plantations and Tradesmen, both for their
urgent and necessary Occasions for the following their Trades, and maintenance
of their Stocks and Employments, have borrowed, and do borrow, diverse Sums of
Money, Sugar, Wares, Merchandises, and other Commodities. But by reason of the
said general fall and abatement of the Value of Lands, and the Prices of Sugar,
and other Merchandise, Wares and Commodities aforesaid, and Interest in Loan,
continuing at so high a Rate as Fifteen Pounds in the Hundred, for one Year,
does not only make Men unable to pay their Debts, and continue the Maintenance
of Trade; but their Debts daily increasing, they are enforced to sell their
Lands and Stock, at very low Rates, to forsake the use of Merchandise and
Trade, and to give over their Leases and Farms, and so become unprofitable
Members of the Commonwealth, to the great hurt and hinderance of the same.

Be it therefore Ordained and Enacted and it is hereby Ordained and Enacted, by
the Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, and by Authority of the same; that
no Person or Persons whatsoever, from, and after the Nine and Twentieth Day of
September next, upon any Contract to be made after the said Nine and Twentieth
Day of September, shall take indirectly, or indirectly, for Loan of any Moneys,
Sugars or other Wares, Merchandises or Commodities whatsoever, above the Value
of Ten Pounds, 10 l. per Cent. Interest.
for the forbearance of One Hundred Pounds for a Year, and so after that Rate
for a greater or lesser Sum, or for a longer or shorter time. And that all
Bonds Contracts, and Assurances whatsoever made after the time aforesaid, for
Payment of any Principal or Money to be Lent, or Covenanted to be performed,
upon, or for any Usury, whereupon, Contracts for above 10 per Cent. void.
or whereby there shall be reserved or taken above the Rate of Ten in the
Hundred as aforesaid, shall be utterly void. And that all and every Person and
Persons whatsoever, which shall after the time aforesaid, upon any Contract to
be made after the said Nine and Twentieth Day of September, take, accept and
receive, by way, or means of any corrupt Bargain, Loan, Exchange, Cheivesance,
Shift, or Interest of any Wares, Merchandises, or other thing or things
whatsoever, or by any deceitful way or means, or by any Covin Engine, or
deceitful Conveyance for the forbearing, or giving Day of Payment for One whole
Year, of, and for their Moneys or other things, above the Sum of Ten Pounds,
for the forbearance of one Hundred Pounds for a Year, and so after that Rate
for a lesser or greater Sum, or for a longer or shorter time, shall forfeit and
lose for every such Offense, Forfeiture.
treble the Value of the Moneys, Sugars, Wares, Merchandises and other things,
so Lent, Bargained, Exchanged or Shifted.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all, and every
Scrivener and Scriveners, Broker and Brokers, Solicitor and Sollicitors,
Driver and Drivers of Bargains or Contracts, who shall after the said Nine and
Twentieth Day of September take or receive, directly or indirectly, any Sum or
Sums of Money, or other reward or things for Brokage, Soliciting, driving or
procuring the Loan, or forbearing of any Sum or Sums of Money, Procurage 5 s.
per Cent.
over or above the Rate or Value of Five Shillings, for the Loan, or forbearing
of One Hundred Pounds Sterling for a Year, and so ratably: Or above Twelve
Pence for making or receiving of the Bond or Bill for the Loan or Forbearance
thereof, or for any Counterbond or Bill concerning the same, 1 s. for the Bond.
shall forfeit for every such Offense, Two Thousand Pounds of Muscovadoe Sugar,
Forfeiture.
and have Imprisonment for half a Year; the one Moiety of which Forfeitures to
be to the King our Sovereign Lord, his Heirs and Successors, and the other
Moiety to him or them, that will sue for the same, in the same Precincts where
the several Offenses are committed, and not elsewhere, by Action of Debt, Bill,
Plaint or Information, in which no Essoign, Wager of Law or Protection to be
allowed.

And to the end there may be no shifting Evasions in abuse to the true intent
and meaning of this Act, as there has been of the former Act of this Island,
by changing the Species of the Debt, sometimes from Money into Sugar and other
Commodities, and again at other times from Sugar and other Commodities into
Money: Wherein the Lender or Creditor working on the necessity of the Debtor or
Borrower, has set so low a Value on Sugar, when he converteth his Money into
Sugar, and on the contrary so high a Value on it, when his Sugar-Debt or Sugar
were to be converted into Money: That by such shifting the Original Sum lent,
has generally in Two or Three Years at most been doubled, to the great
oppression of the Inhabitants of this Island, and the scandal of Justice, that
have not adjudged such shifting and indirect Courses to be contrary to the
former Act.

It is hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That there shall
be no Change or Alteration of Money or Wares lent or continued in the Hands of
any Borrower; No changing Money into Goods, or Goods into Money.
but that whatsoever is lent or continued, shall still remain unchanged from
the Species it was first lent in, and that no Commodities be as aforesaid
changed or shifted into Money, nor Money into Commodities.

And forasmuch as in the understanding of one Clause of the Act, establishing
the Courts of Common Pleas within this Island, the Judges of the respective
Courts, have differed in Opinion and Practice; whereby some Inconveniences have
happened as well to the Merchant and Trader, as Inhabitants of this Island: By
reason that on Recoveries in this Island of Debt payable in England, and there
not duly satisfied, some Judges have ordered the satisfying thereof by
Appraisement, some by Sale or Outcry; when as indeed neither of those Courses
are directed by the said Act, but done at the discretion of the Judges. To the
end there may be no failure of Justice, and that every Recovery should be
satisfied, for prevention of which different proceedings, and for the
establishing a just and equal way for the satisfying such Debts and Recoveries,

It is hereby Enacted and Ordained, and the respective Judges of this Island,
This last Clause is Repealed by an after Act. N. 117.
are hereby required upon all such Recoveries now or hereafter to be made by
reason of any Contract preceding the Publication of this Act, be satisfied and
paid by Attachment and Appraisement, and that no Sale by Outcry in such case be
allowed. And whatever Recoveries shall hereafter be obtained in any of the
Courts of this Island, of Money that were payable in England, and became due by
reason of any Contract made after the Publication of this Act, such Money-Debts
shall be here satisfied by Muscovadoe Sugar, at Two Pence the Pound, or
whatever else shall be Attached, where no Muscovadoe Sugar can be found, shall
be Appraised into Muscovadoe Sugar; and if the Recovery be on Bills of
Exchange, Twenty per Cent. to be added, as by the former Law of this Island is
appointed. And in ordering and appointing Appraisers, the Judges are to have an
especial care, that they appoint none to Appraise, but such as are good and
sufficient Freeholders. This Act to continue for the Space of Seven Years,
from the said Nine and Twentieth Day of September, and so to the end of the
Setting of the Assembly then next following.

Given under my Hand, the 29th of April, 1668. Signed, William Willoughby.

No 92. An ACT for preventing the Selling of Brandy and Rum in Tipling-Houses
near the Broad Paths and Highways within this Island.
FOrasmuch as intolerable Hurts and Troubles to this Island, do continually
grow and increase through the Multiplicity of such Abuses and Disorders as are
daily had and used in Unlicens'd Tipling-Houses, commonly called Brandy, or
Rum-Houses, which are for the most part situated and erected near to
Broad-paths or Highways; Whereby the Keepers of such Houses take advantage to
Trade and Deal with Servants and Negroes for Stolen Goods contrary to Law, and
to the great Oppression and Damage of Honest and Industrious People.

And whereas on Sabbath Days, many Lewd, Loose and Idle People, do usually
resort to such Tippling Houses, who by their Drunkenness, Swearing and other
Miscarriages, do in a very high nature, blaspheme the Name of God, profane the
Sabbath, and bring a great Scandal upon true Christian Religion. For Prevention
whereof for the future,

Be it Ordained and Enacted by the Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, and
by Authority of the same; None to sell Wine near Highways. Not to be licensed.
and it is hereby Ordained and Enacted, that no Person or Persons whatsoever,

Confession, shall for such their first Offense, Forfeits 500 l. Sugar, First

by distress, as in case of Servants Wages, by Warrant from any Justice of the
Peace of that Parish, where such Offense shall be committed. The same
Forfeitures to be converted to, and reserved for the use and maintenance of the
Poor of that respective Parish. And in case any Person shall offend the Second
time in the same nature, Second and after Offense, the Goal.

Neither shall be construed to extend to the Prohibition of such Person or
Persons as are appointed to give Entertainment in their Houses at the Quarter
Sessions, or other Court or Courts of Judicature within the Body of this Island.

And forasmuch as it has been the too long Covetous Practices of many Persons
to buy decayed Wines, etc. with intent and purpose to vent the same at great
Rates amongst the poor People, who live far up in the Country: By which means
the poorer sort of Planters and Laborers contract many needless Debts, to the
great Ruin of themselves and Families; and which tends very much to the
depopulation of this place, if not timely prevented.

Be it therefore Ordained and Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, None to sell
Wines, etc. but what shall be the produce of their own Plantations.
That no Person or Persons, except such as are before in this Act excepted, do
after the first Day of June next ensuing the Publication hereof, take upon him

made.

All Articles in Accounts for Strong Liquors void.
Articles of Accounts, Bills, Bon^^ or other Contracts so to be made, or given
after the First Day of June next, for the Sale of such Strong Liquors retailed
up in the Country as aforesaid, shall be deemed, and are hereby declared to be
void, null and of no effect; any Law, Usage or Custom heretofore to the
contrary notwithstanding.

And be it further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That no
Person or Persons within this Island, from and after the Publication hereof,
shall be permitted to keep any Still or Stills for distilling of Rum: None to
keep a Still but Planters or Refiners.
Except such Person or Persons have Land and Canes of their own, or such as
keep Refining Houses.

And if any other Person or Persons shall obstinately persist so to do, that
then he or they shall abide, and undergo the Censure of the next
Quarter Sessions, so often as he or they offend in that kind.

No 94. An ACT declaring the Negro Slaves of this Island to be Real Estate.
WHereas a very considerable part of the Wealth of this Island consists in our
Negro Slaves, without whose Labor and Service we should be utterly unable to
manage our Plantations here, thereby relieving our own Wants, and bringing that
considerable increase of Revenue, which this Place affords unto his Majesty's
Coffers, as well here as in England.

And whereas Some Law Suits have arisen, and other great Inconveniences have
followed, where diverse Persons dying Intestate, have left their Right and
Interest of their Negro Slaves to be by Law disputed between their Heirs,
Executors and Administrators, wherein the various Judgments or Affections of
several Courts or Jurors, have sometimes found for the one, and at other times,
for the other.

For a full Remedy of these Inconveniences, and to the intent that the Heir and
Widow, who claims Dower, may not have bare Land without Negroes to Manure the
same, And also that the Condition, Right and Interest of Negroes, to all other
ends and purposes whatsoever may be fully known and determined,

The Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly of Representatives, being willing
that all Doubts, and Ambiguities herein should be removed, and the Law in this
case declared and put in a certainty, have Ordained and Enacted, And it is
hereby Ordained and Enacted by the Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, and
by Authority of the same, that from, and after Publication hereof, all Negro
Slaves in all Courts of Judicature and other Places within this Island, shall
be held, taken and adjudged to be Estate real, and not Chattels, Negroes made
real Estate.
and shall descend unto the Heirs and Widow of any Person dying Intestate,
according to the Manner and Customs of Lands of Inheritance held in Fee-Simple.

Provided always, that no Person selling or alienating any of his or her
Negroes, No need to Inroll.
is hereby held or obliged to cause such Sale or Alienation to be enrolled, as
is accustomed to be done and required by the Law of this Island, in the
alienation of other real Estates: Any usage Law or Custom to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Provided that this Act, nor any thing therein contained, Not to extend to
Merchants Factors, etc. Importing.
shall be taken and deemed to extend unto any Merchant, Factor or Agent,
bringing Negro Slaves to this Island, or having the consignment of any Slaves
unto them. But in all respects, they, their Executors Administrators or
Assigns, may hold, possess and enjoy such Slave or Negroe in such Condition, as
they might have done before the making of this Act, until such Sale of such
Slave or Slaves has been made in this Island.

of those Days, and all manner of Contracts thereby, though never so unduly
made, seemingly confirmed and warranted. So that many Evils may ensue to the
Inhabitants of this Island, by the Indirect Practices of many loose and wicked
Persons.

Assembly, and by Authority of the same, That the said Act of the Ninth Day of

No 114. An ACT prohibiting Wandering Persons from carrying of Goods and Wares
in Packs or otherwise, from House to House in this Island.
FOrasmuch as the extravagant Wandering of several Persons with their Packs of
Wares in and about this Island from House to House, there to make Sale of the
same, has been found to be very prejudicial to the Inhabitants thereof, not
only for that such Toleration is contrary to the wholesome Laws of England,
which strictly prohibit all such Pedlers as Vagabonds, But for that it does
also occasion and create many great Mischiefs to this Place, by reason of the
continual underhand dealing of such Persons every where with Servants and
Negroes; Whereby they drive on most part of their Trade by trucking for Stolen
Goods, to no small Damage of honest and industrious Planters, who may from time
to time Supply himself with all sorts of Commodities at cheaper Rates from the
Merchant, at the several Towns and Storehouses within this Island.

Be it therefore Ordained and Enacted by the Deputy Governor, Council and
Assembly, and Authority of the same, that all such Persons, Stone to carry
Packs from House to House, Forfeits such Wares.
as shall presume so to Travel, Wander, or go from House to House in this

whatsoever, shall forfeit his or their Wares and Commodities whatsoever, so
carried as aforesaid. And that it shall and may be lawful for any Person
whatsoever, to apprehend and take such Person and Persons so Wandering,
Traveling and carrying Goods in manner aforesaid, and him or them to carry
before the next Justice of the Peace, to examine the same. And if upon his
Examination, he shall find the Person or Persons so brought before him, to be
Offenders against this Act, Any Justice may examine and divide the Wares.
That then it shall and may be Lawful for such Justice of the Peace, to divide
all and every the said Goods and Wares so carried as aforesaid, according to
the best of his Judgment, and the one half to give and deliver to such Person
or Persons, Half to the Informer, half to the Poor.
that shall apprehend such Person or Persons, so offending as aforesaid, and
the other half forthwith to deliver over to the Overseers of the poor of that
Parish, where the Person or Persons so offending, shall be Apprehended, Seized
or Taken, the same to be to the use of the Poor of the said Parish, who is to
give an exact Account thereof to the Vestry of each such Parish.

WHereas by an Act of this Island bearing Date the 29th of April, One Thousand,
Six Hundred, Sixty Eight, Entitled, An Act for Reduceing the Interest to Ten,
for One Hundred in One Year, It is in a latter Clause in the said Act, Declared
and Enacted, that whatsoever Recoveries shall hereafter be obtained in any the
Courts of this Island, of Moneys that were Payable in England, and became due
by reason of any Contract made after the Publication of the said Act; such
Money-Debts should be here satisfied by Muscovadoe Sugar, at Two Pence per
Pound; or whatever else should be Attached where no Muscovadoe Sugar could be
found, should be Appraised into Muscovadoe Sugar; and if the Recovery be on
Bills of Exchange, Twenty per Cent. to be added. And whereas it is found by
experience, That the Consequence thereof tends to the impairing of the Credit
and Trade of this Island;

Be it therefore Enacted by the Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, and by
the Authority of the same, That the said last Clause in the said Act,
Entitled, An Act for the Reducing the Interest to Ten, for One Hundred in One
Year, and every thing therein contained, as is here before recited, shall be,
and is hereby from henceforth Repealed, Annulled and made void, to all Intents
and Purposes whatsoever.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That from henceforth,

An ACT to prohibit the bringing of Heading and Timber from Surinam.

No 122. An Additional ACT concerning the Conveyance of Estates.
WHereas by an Act of this Island made the Eleventh Day of September, One
Thousand, Six Hundred, Forty and Nine, Entitled An Act concerning the
Conveyance of Estates; the Preamble whereof run in these following Words.

For that the King's Writs do not run here, whereby Fines and Recoveries cannot
be here had and levied as in England, and yet here is as much and more use and
need of them: Recital of a former Act.
For that few Men come to this Island with intention to settle themselves and
Posterities: But for the most part to gain and increase their Estates, and then
to sell their Lands and Return, which oftentimes cannot well be done, nor with
Security to the Purchaser, for want of such Fines and Recoveries without some
Act be made to supply the same, etc. It was Enacted, That a Deed in due form of
Law made and within Three Months of the Date thereof, acknowledged before the
Resident Governor for the time being, or before some one of the chief Judges
of one of the Courts of Justice within this Island, by all the Parties that
grant or pass away any Lease for above the Term of Three Years, or any
Freehold or Inheritance by such Deed, or by so many of them as shall be
living, of by any other Person or Persons lawfully authorized under Hand and
Seal, to convey and grant the same; ( So the same be recorded at length in the
Secretary's Office of this Island, within the said Three Months) shall be
valid, to pass the same without Livery, Attornment, or any other Act or
Ceremony whatsoever. And that no Deed hereafter without such Acknowledgment and
Inrollment shall pass any Estate of Freehold or Inheritance, or any Lease above
the number of Three Years. Which before recited Clause, as well Negative as
Affirmative, was on the Seventh of October, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Fifty
and Two, Repealed and Supplied by one Act, containing as follows.

That no Deed shall be sufficient in Law to bar a real Purchaser, to pass any
Estate of Land, Deeds to be acknowledged before the Governor, or one of the
Judges.
unless the same be acknowledged before the Governor, or One of the chief
Judges of One of the Courts within this Island, and enrolled at length in the
Secretary's Office, within Three Months of the Date and Delivery thereof. And
in case the Grantor shall refuse, or does not on Summons, appear to acknowledge
the same, Then upon Proof made by any of the Witnesses, before such Governor
or Judge, that the said Deed was duly sealed and delivered within the said
time, shall be sufficient for Recording the same. Which said Act made in Anno
One Thousand, Six Hundred, Fifty and Two, not being made under Kingly
Authority, became void immediately on his Majesty's happy Restoration; And
thereby the former revived, yet so unobserved not only by the general Body of
the Inhabitants of this Place, but even by the Ministers and Courts of Justice,
that the apprehension, use and practice settled by the said Act, in One
Thousand, Six Hundred, Fifty and Two, has continued even to this present Day.
By which Misapprehension, and yet Re-establishment of the before recited Clause
of that Act made in Anno One Thousand, Six Hundred Forty and Nine, without due
Provision, would occasion many and great Inconveniences to the Inhabitants of
this Place.

(...) Acts, (...) 1652.
The Representatives of the Inhabitants of His Majesty's Island, do therefore
desire, that it may be Declared and Enacted;

And it is hereby Enacted and Declared, by the Deputy Governor, Council and
Assembly and by Authority of the same; That no Deed made since the Eleventh of
September, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Forty and Nine, or that hereafter shall
be made, shall be sufficient in Law to bar a real Purchaser: Unless it be
acknowledged and proved before the Resident Governor or chief Judge of One of
His Majesty's Courts of Common Pleas within this Island, for the time being,

The Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, desiring to put a Remedy to the
same, have Enacted and Ordained,

And it is hereby Enacted and Ordained by the said Deputy Governor, Council

No 130. An Additional ACT relating to the Militia.
Repealed.

No 131. An ACT appointing Overseers of Plantations, to officiate and act as
Surveyors of the Highways and Constables.
FOrasmuch as several of the most eminent Plantations in most Parishes of this
Island do little or no Parochial Duties, by reason the respective Owners of
such Plantations have removed themselves to England or elsewhere, and in their
Place and stead have left their particular Attorneys, Agents and Overseers, to
manage their Estates for them in their Absence, Whereby the Country has not
only a far less Choice of able Men to officiate in the highest Places of Trust,
But the burden likewise of inferior Officers does thereby lie more heavy upon
the Poorer sort of People. To the intent therefore that each Plantation may
bear (so far as is possible) its equal Share in the performance of such Duties;

Be it Ordained and Enacted, and it is hereby Ordained and Enacted by the
Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, and by Authority of the same, that it
shall and may be Lawful, to, Justices at Quarter Sessions, or Vestry-Men to
Elect.
and for the Justices of the Peace at their Quarter Sessions or Vestries of
each Parish within this Island, as in other cases has been accustomed at their
Election of Officers, to nominate, constitute and appoint, as to their
discretion shall seem most meet, any chief Overseer or Overseers, Attorney or
Agent living upon any of the said Plantation or Plantations within this Island,
containing Threescore Acres of Land or more, Plantation ^^ Acres.
and whose Owner or Owners at such time or times of Election of Officers shall
not be resident within this Island, to serve as Surveyours of the Highways, or
as Constables; any Law, Usage or Custom heretofore to the contrary

And it is further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That in
case any Overseer, Attorney or Agent as aforesaid, so elected and chosen to
serve as Surveyor or Constable as aforesaid, shall after due notice given,
neglect or refuse to be Sworn, and officiate either by himself or approved
Deputy, at the charge of the Plantation in his respective Office, Refusing to
Serve, forfeits 2000 lb. Sugar.
That then every such Overseer shall out of his proper Estate, forfeit Two
Thousand Pounds of Muscovadoe Sugar for such his Offense, the same to be levied
by way of Distress, Levied by Distress.
by Warrant or Precept under the Hand of any Justice of the Peace within such
Parish where such Offense is committed. And in case no Estate of such Overseer,
Attorney or Agent so offending (as aforesaid) to that Value can be found, Then
the said Justice of the Peace is hereby empowered and required to commit to
Goal every such Person so offending, Imprisonment till Payment or Performance.
till he shall pay the same, or perform his Duty herein required.

All which Forfeitures are hereby appointed to be employed and laid out, in,
and toward the Maintenance of the Poor of each respective Parish where such
Offense shall be committed.

FOrasmuch as by a good, wholesome and beneficial Law of this Island bearing
Date the Eleventh Day of September, in the Year of our Lord, One Thousand, Six
Hundred, Forty Nine, Entitled, An Act concerning the Conveyance of Estates,
and by the Addition thereunto made, the One and Twentieth Day of September, in
the Year of our Lord, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Sixty and One, generally
called, the Act of Non-claim; Amongst other things therein contained, is
limited and appointed the certain Times wherein Persons are to make their
Claims to Lands and Tenements in this Island. But for that it is not therein
ascertained and appointed in what manner, or how such Claims are to be made to
Lands and Tenements, So that the Judges of the Courts of Common Pleas are left
to their own Judgments and Opinions, what is, or may be a Claim in such Cases.
Whereby great Hurts may redound to the Inhabitants, Possessors of Lands and
Tenements, in case the Judges of the several Courts of Law should differ or
vary in Judgment, in the manner of Claim, or allow of any other Claim, than is
hereafter mentioned and declared.

And to the intent that the same may be ascertained, and the Possessours of
Lands and Tenements assured how and in what manner Persons having or laying
Claim to any Lands or Tenements in their Possessions; And also all Persons
having Right or Title to Lands or Tenements, may know how to claim or demand
their Right in such Cases, and that the Judges of the respective Courts of
Common Pleas for the future may not vary herein,

The Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, have thought fit to declare, and
they do hereby show and declare, That all manner of Persons whatsoever that are
concerned to make Claim to any Lands or Tenements within this Island, so as to
make their Claim effectual, Claim saved by Action entered, and not otherwise.
are to make claim by their Action at Law duly entered in the Offices of the
Courts where the Lands or Tenements are, according to the Forms, Practice and
Rules of the said Courts: To which Action, the Tenants or Person in Possession,
are to receive Summons from the said Court.

And that all Judges and Courts of common Pleas do allow of no other Claim to
Lands or Tenements, for any Persons, Judges and Courts to admit of no other
Claims.
Plaintiffs in any Suit or Suits before them than what is to be made by their
Action on Record and Summons given in manner aforesaid, and not otherwise; Any
Law, Usage, Custom or Practice to the contrary notwithstanding.

And whereas Persons having or pretending Rights and Titles to Lands and
Tenements in the possession of others, having once made their Claim within the
times limited and appointed in the said Act, may for ever then after keep their
Pretense of Right or Title to the same, by bringing their Action or Actions by
way of Claim at Law once in Five Years, and so again in Five Years after, and
so vex and trouble the Persons in Possession in such manner for ever.

The Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, for prevention and removal of so
great an Inconveniency, do therefore Declare and Enact, And it is hereby
Declared and Enacted, That all Persons whatsoever, that shall hereafter make
their Claim to any Lands and Tenements within the time limited in the said Act;
Do by the said Action, To bring Action in Five Years to Trial.
or by some other Action (if brought in the Five Years then next after, (bring
the same to trial, That Trial to be definitive, and a Bar.
and the same Trial to be conclusive and definitive on the Plaintiffs part for
ever, and never to bring any Action then after for the same, but to be for ever
barred; any Law, Usage, Custom or Practice to the contrary notwithstanding.

And forasmuch as the Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, having duly
consulted the said Act, and the said Addition thereto, do find, that the said
Act, being pleaded in Bar by the Possessors of Lands or Tenements against
Persons who have not made their Claim within the time limited therein, such
Persons so neglecting their Claim become utterly barred, But does not provide,
that all manner of Persons whatsoever, that shall at any time Claim under such
Person or Persons who have lost their Claim, shall be in like manner barred by
the said Act if pleaded; Nor that the said Act, or such parts thereof, as
concern the matter aforesaid, can be given in Evidence to a Jury upon trial of
any such Matter or Right to the Lands or Tenements in question between Party
and Party; Which if it had Provided and Enacted, would have been and hereafter
would be much to the quiet of the Inhabitants of this Island. And to the intent
and on purpose, that such quiet may hereafter be to the said Inhabitants,

It is Ordained and Enacted by the Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, and
by the Authority of the same, That in all such cases, where any Person or
Persons whatsoever have lost their Claim to any Lands or Tenements in this
Island, He who claims under any one barred, is also barred.
That all Persons whatsoever Claiming under any such Person, who have so lost
their Claim, shall be utterly barred to all intents and purposes whatsoever;
the same to be duly pleaded in Bar, Act of Non-claim to be pleaded, or given
in Evidence.
or given in Evidence to a Jury upon the Trayal of any such Right; And that the
said Act and Addition thereto, or such Clause or Clauses in them, or either of
them, as relate to the matter aforesaid, shall be given in Evidence to a Jury
upon trial as aforesaid, And that all Judges and Courts of the Common Pleas
upon such Trials, Judges to allow it.
accept the same as Evidence so far as the same shall concern the said matter
in difference.

And whereas it is provided in the said Act, that where a Man and his Wife in
this Island, are willing to Alien and sell Lands, which is held in right of the
Wife, they appearing before any chief Judge, and acknowledging their Deed,
mentioning the same, with intent to pass away the Land, and duly Recorded in
the public Register, shall be effectual to convey the same, as if it had been
done in England, by Fine and Recovery: But provideth not, where any Man and his
Wife so having Lands in this Island, living in any parts remote, may by any way
Convey the same.

Therefore the Deputy Governor, Council and Assembly, do hereby Enact and
Ordain, Man and Wife of full Age, or Feme Sole, to alien Lands here, whilst in
Parts beyond the Seas.
And it is hereby Ordained and Enacted, That if any Man and his Wife of full
Age, or Woman Sole by their Deed of Sale, or any other Instrument sufficient to
that intent, if resideing, in England, Scotland or Ireland, or any other His
Majesty's Dominions, shall appear before any of His Majesty's Judges of any
Court of Law, or Mayor of any City or Corporation, or before the chief
Governor of any Island or Place where they live and inhabit, and shall
acknowledge the same; in which Acknowledgement the Woman do declare her
voluntary and free Consent, without Threats or Force of her Husband; and the
same shall be so sent over, and truly certified under the Seal of the Judge,
Mayor, Corporation or Governor, to this Island, and Recorded here at length in
the Secretary's Office, within Twelve Months then next after such
Acknowledgement, shall be as effectual to convey the Land therein contained, as
if the same had been done in this Island, according as in the said Act is
provided; any Law, Usage or Custom to the contrary notwithstanding.

to and with many Freemen, whose times of Service have been lately expired, as
also other Artificers and small Setlers in this Island, enticed, spirited and
carried many such hence to other Settlements, by taking them obliged Servants
to serve from their Arrival for time, for their bare Transportation, or other
small Considerations, promising them great Quantities of Land and other
Benefits in such Remote Parts, when as they are no sooner arrived, but are sold

better than Slaves, being utterly deceived and ruined, and their honest
Expectations altogether frustrate, grounded on Promises tending to their

is contracted for, or to be the Recompense.

And it is further Enacted, That whosoever shall by himself or any other, send

Cattle, Stock or other Goods, after the same has been legally Attached;
Whereby the Plaintiff is disappointed of his Payment, or some part thereof;
Such Person for such his Offense, is by the said Judge immediately to be
committed to Prison without Bail or Mainprize. But since the making the said
Act, the Clause aforesaid has been found to be inconvenient, in that if any
Persons Goods or Chattels being in Execution, and he making away the same, it
is not only inconvenient, but impossible for the Plaintiffs in any Execution,
to make proof thereof by Witnesses; whereby the Plaintiffs are not only
retarded from their just Debts, but left without Remedy for obtaining the same.
For Remedy whereof,

The Deputy Governor, Council and Representatives of this Island now
assembled, do Ordain and Enact, And it is hereby Ordained and Enacted by, the

Distilled Spirits to be imported this Island.
Expired.

No 173. An ACT concerning Persons intended to depart this Island, and the
setting up their Names in the Secretary's Office and Warrants of Arrest.
FOrasmuch as it has long been a Law and Custom of this Island, that all
Persons whatsoever inhabiting or residing within the same, (except Women Covert
and Children under the Age of Fourteen Years) intending to depart hence, have
used to put up their Names publicly in the Secretary's Office upon a Table
there for that purpose; And after Twenty One Days so past or otherwise, upon
entering and giving their sufficient Securities as has been accustomed in such
cases, have a Ticket or License from the Secretary for the time being, Signed
by the Resident Governor, has been a sufficient Warrant for any Master of any
Ship or Vessel, to transport them to any other Place. The intent and practice
of which Law and Custom has been, that Persons indebted might not privately go
off, But that they might be compelled before their Departure, to give Security
in the said Office, to pay their just Debts, and answer all other Claims and
Demands that might justly be made against them. Which Law and Custom in this
kind, has hitherto by experience been found of good use and benefit to the
Inhabitants and Traders here: But for that the said Act and Law has not
sufficiently provided for giving Securities in the said Office for Payment of
Debts, performing of Contracts and other Agreements at times and days to come,
after such putting up their Names: Nor strictly appointed Persons underwriting,
to underwrite for their exact Sums due, or to become due, or other Pretenses
not really just or true, and other Defects not well or sufficiently provided
for by the said Act. For Remedy whereof, and supplying such Defects as are
already known,

assembled, have thought fit to Ordain and Enact, And it is hereby Ordained and

manner of putting up Names in the Secretary's Office.
and to enter thereon their Christian and Sirnames at large, and in what Parish
they reside, and whither intended, and the Day and Year when their Names are so
put up. And that the Secretary or his Deputy for the time being, give not, or
grant unto any Person or Persons whatsoever, a Ticket or License for any to
depart hence, When a Ticket to be given.
Unless their Names have been first put up as aforesaid, in the said Table in
the Secretary's Office, full One and Twenty Days, or otherwise taken good and
sufficient Security to answer all Under-writings whatsoever, that are or shall
be there entered within One and Twenty Days from the first setting up their
Names as aforesaid.

And whatsoever Person or Persons intending so to go off, are not well known to
the Secretary or his Deputy for the time being, Persons unknown to the

to have gone by that Name so put up, That in all such cases the Secretary or
his Deputy grant out no Ticket to such Person, until he be certified of his or
her Name so requiring the Ticket, by a Certificate under the Hand of some one
of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace in this Island, That he or she has
gone, or been known by, or upon the Justices own Knowledge, Of his own
knowledge, or by the Oath of Two Witnesses.
or the Oath of Two Witnesses well known to the said Justice, and such
Certificate to be filed and kept in the said Office for his Warrant therein;
and likewise to take Security to answer all Under-writings as is aforesaid,
That then and in all such Cases, The Secretary and Governor to Sign all
Tickets.
it shall and may be lawful to and for the Secretary or his Deputy for the time
being, to grant out such Ticket first by him to be Signed, as a Sign and Token
of his due Performances in his Office in such Cases, according to the true
intent and meaning of this Act. And that then the Resident Governor of this
Island for the time being, is hereby desired and lawfully authorized to Sign
such Ticket for his or her Departure. And such Ticket so Signed by the Resident
Governor and Secretary, or Deputy Secretary chiefly officiating in the said
Office, shall and may be a lawful Warrant for any Master of any Ship or Vessel
to transport such Person or Persons to any other Place whatsoever, without
impeaching any Obligation, Master of any Ship may safely transport with such
Tickets.

Women Covert, and Children under 14 Excepted. Unless Feme Sole Traders.


Law or Custom of this Place to the contrary.

Provided always, and it is the true intent and meaning of this Act, That the
Clauses before-going, extend not to Women Covert, or Children under the Age of
Fourteen Years; other than such Women Covert, that trade, use or exercise any
Trade as a Sole or Feme Merchant within this Island and not otherwise.

And for the Prevention of the great Mischiefs that many times happen to
Persons going off this Island, Against evil and malicious Vnder-writings.
through the malice of some evil disposed Persons, upon pretense of Debts or
other pretended Claims, make or cause Under-writings to be made against them
for great Sums of Sugar or other large Demands not really due, or owing, to
their great Hurt and Damage.

Be it therefore Ordained and Enacted, and it is hereby Ordained and Enacted by
the Authority aforesaid, That whosoever shall under-write any Person or
Persons, so having their Names up as aforesaid, Directions how to under-write.

Four Thousand Pounds Sterling; he is disabled to sell all or part of the said

of the said Benjamin Middleton and his Fortune in the World, and more
especially the Creditor of the said Estate.

For the speedy Prevention of all which Mischiefs and Inconveniences, and that
he may be enabled to make any legal Sale of all or any part of the said Estate,
to raise Money for the Payment of the said Debts, thereby to prevent many
Lawsuits and Troubles which will inevitably fall upon the said Estate, and in
the end prove very ruinous and destructive to the said Benjamin Middleton, his
Posterity and Family. And to the end that any Person or Persons that hereafter
shall and will come in and offer to purchase and buy all or any part of the
said Estate and Premises, may be better encouraged thereunto.

Be it Enacted by His Excellency, Sir Jonathan Atkins, Knight, Captain General

No 251. An ACT for the better enabling the Executors of William Plumley,
Deceased, to sell his Estate for the Payment of his Debts.
WHereas William Plumley, late of this Island Mariner, died seized of a
considerable Estate in Lands and Negroes, and possessed of diverse Stocks and
other Goods and Chattels of Value and in his Life time, did contract very great
Debts and Engagements upon himself and his Estate, and by several Obligations,
Judgments and Mortgages, did entangle and incumber his said Estate; which
Encumbrances are now speedily like to fall upon the said Estate, and to tear
the same in pieces, to the utter undoing of his surviving Wife and Children.

And whereas the said William by his last Will and Testament, bearing Date the
4th Day of February, 1675, amongst diverse other things therein mentioned, has
appointed and devised all or the greatest part of his Estate, to his Executors
to be sold for the payment of his said Debts, and has made several Bequests to
his younger Children for their Provision and Maintenance.

And forasmuch as there is an absolute necessity, that his whole Estate,
Interest and Premises, should be forthwith sold to raise Money for the
satisfying and discharging the said Debts and Engagements, and making
convenient and competent Provisions for the Wife and Children out of the
Overplus after the Debts paid, in case any shall happen to be. But in regard
some of the Executors and Devisees are yet in their Minority, and incapable by
Law to convey any good and sufficient Titles and Assurances to any Person or
Persons that would purchase and buy the same, for the Purposes and intents
aforesaid.

And because there is great justice and equity that the Sale thereof should be
speedily effected to hinder all Vexatious Lawsuits, Charges and other Troubles
that will unavoidably fall upon the said Estate, the consequence whereof will
absolutely ruin the Wife and Children. For the Prevention whereof, and to the
end that all the just Debts of the said William Plumley may be truly and bona
fide paid and satisfied, and the Wife and Children duly provided for, with
competent Portions and Maintenance out of the overplus of the said Estate and
Premises, in case any shall happen to remain according to the intent of the
said William Plumley, and as is befitting all justice and equity. And also to
the end That any Person or Persons who hereafter shall or will come in and
offer to purchase and buy the said Estate and Premises may be encouraged
thereunto,

Be it Enacted by his Excellency, Sir Jonathan Atkins, Knight, Captain General
and Chief Governor of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the Council and
Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, It is Enacted, That John Plumley,
Paul Plumley and Sarah Plumley, Widow, and the Survivours or Survivour of them,
shall have good Right, and hereby full power and authority is given and granted
to them and the Survivours and Survivour of them, upon good and valuable
considerations, whether for Money, Sugar, or other Goods and Commodities; To
Grant, Bargain, Sell in Fee-simple or Fee-tail, or Demise, make Lease or Leases
for Life or Lives or Years, and to make any other Disposition, Sale or grant of
the whole or any part of the said Land, Negroes, Stock and other the Estate,
Interest, Right, Claim or Property that was belonging to the said William
Plumley at the time of his Death; to any Person or Persons whatsoever.

And it is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every, or
any Grant, Bargain or Sale, or other Disposition that shall be so made by the
said John Plumley, Paul Plumley and Sarah Plumley, and the Survivours or
Survivour of them, of the Estate, Interest, Right, Title and Property
aforesaid, either in the whole or by Parcels, either in Fee-Simple, Fee-Tail
General or Special, Lease or Leases for Life, Lives or Years in Possession or
Reversion, Shall be good and effectual in Law to all Intents and Purposes
whatsoever, to any Person or Persons, their Heirs and Assigns, in as large and
ample manner as the said William Plumley in his Lifetime, might or could have
done the same and not otherwise, according to the respective limitation of
every such Estate or Estates, that shall upon good and valuable Considerations
aforesaid, bona fide, purchase and buy the same: Any Law, Custom or Usage
whatsoever to the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding.

Provided this Act or any thing therein contained, shall not prejudice or
injure the Right, Title or Interest of any Person or Persons whatsoever, that
on the Day of the Date hereof, have any Claim, Right or Title to the Premises
aforesaid, or any part thereof, either by any Act or thing done by the said
William Plumley in his Lifetime, or by any other ways or means, or by the
Creditors of the said William Plumley, in case Payment be not made to them
according to the Intent and Provision of this Act.

It is also hereby further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That in case
Payment be not made to the Creditors of the said William Plumley by his said
Executors or their Appointment, That all or any part of the said Estate, shall
be liable to the satisfaction thereof in the same manner, as if the said Estate
had remained in the Possession of the said John, Paul, and Sarah unsold and
undisposed of.

And whereas all the foregoing Premises were passed into an Act on the 12th of
July, 1676; but it has so happened, that Two Years are fully elapsed since the
Date thereof, and has not received the King's Gracious Ratification to make it
perpetual.

And forasmuch as since the making the said Act, the Estate and Premises
mentioned and intended therein, has been sold for very valuable considerations,
for the ends and purposes designed by the said Act; And the Purchasers thereof
have been chiefly encouraged thereunto by the indubitable Security of their
Title, being grounded upon the said Act; but now the said Act being of no
force, for want of his Majesty's Royal Confirmation as aforesaid.

And forasmuch as some Contentious Persons may possibly hereafter arise and
endeavor to overthrow the Title of the said Purchasers under the said Act; For
Prevention whereof, and for the better quieting the Possessions and Titles of
the said Purchaser or Purchasers that claim under that Act,

Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every Person or
Persons whatsoever, that since the Date of the said Act, have for valuable
considerations, bona fide, bought and purchased all or any part of the said
Estate and Premises mentioned and intended within the said Act, Shall by virtue
of this present Act, have, hold and enjoy their said Purchases and Premises,
according to the true purview and meaning of the said Act, against all manner
of Persons whatsoever, as if the said Act were still in force, and confirmed by
the King's Majesty as aforesaid; any Act, Law or Usage to the contrary hereof
in any wise notwithstanding.

And We His Majesty's Council and the Representatives of this Island, do humbly
request your Excellency, as the Father of Orphans in this Island, to cause a
due Distribution of the Surplusage of the said William Plumley's Estate, after
his Debts are paid, to the Legatees, Widow and Children of the said Plumley,
according to the purport of his last Will and Testament.

And it is Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That your Excellency have such
Power by virtue of this Act, to cause the said Will in all respects to be
performed, and at your Excellency's Discretion to cause Security accordingly to
be given.

WHereas our late Sovereign Lord, Charles the First of blessed Memory, did by
his Letters Patent, under the great Seal of England, grant and convey unto
James Earl of Carlisle, and his Heirs for ever, the Propriety of this Island of
Barbados: And his Sacred Majesty that now is, having by Purchase invested
himself in all the Rights of the said Earl of Carlisle, and in all other Rights
which any other Person may claim from that Patent or any other, And thereby
more immediately and particularly has taken this Island into his Royal
Protection. And His Most Excellent Majesty, having by Letters Patent under the
great Seal of England, bearing Date the Twelfth of June, in the Fifteenth Year
of his Reign, appointed His Excellency, Francis Lord Willoughby of Parham,
Captain General, and Chief Governor of Barbados, and all the
Charibbee-Islands, with full Power and Authority to Grant, Confirm and Assure
to the Inhabitants of the same, and their Heirs for ever; All Lands, Tenements
and Hereditaments under His Majesty's great Seal, appointed for Barbados and
the rest of the Charibbee-Islands, as Relation being thereunto had, may and
does more at large appear.

And whereas by virtue of the said Earl of Carlisle's Patent, diverse Governors
and Agents have been sent over hither, with Authority to lay out, set, grant or
convey in Parcels the Lands within this Island, to such Persons as they should
think fit; which was by them in their respective times, as much as in them lay
accordingly performed.

And whereas many have lost their Grants, Warrants and other Evidences for
their said Lands, and others by reason of the ignorances of those times, want
sufficient and legal Words to create Inheritances in them and their Heirs; and
others that never Recorded their Grants or Warrants; and others that can make
no Proof of any Grants or Warrants they ever had for their Lands, and yet have
been long and quiet Possessors of the same and bestowed great Charges thereon.

And whereas the Acknowledgment of Forty Pounds per Head, and other Taxes and
Compositions formerly raised to the Earl of Carlisle was held very heavy. For a
full Remedy therefore for all the Defects before related, and quieting the
Possessions and settling the Tenures of the Inhabitants of this Island,

Be it Enacted by his Excellency, Francis Lord Willoughby of Parham, etc. his
Council and Gentlemen of the Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, That

and Customs thereof, may at all times repair unto his Excellency for the full
Confirmation of their Estates and Tenures; and then and there shall and may
receive such full Confirmation and Assurance under His Majesty's great Seal for
this Island, as they can reasonably advise or desire, according to the true
intent and meaning of this Act.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every the
Payments of Forty Pounds of Cotton per Head, and all other Duties, Rents and
Arrears of Rents, which have or might have been levied, be from henceforth
absolutely and fully released and made void; And that the Inhabitants of this
Island, have and hold their several Plantations to them and their Heirs for
ever, in free and common Soccage; yielding and paying therefore at the Feast of
St. Michael every Year, (if the same be lawfully demanded) one Ear of Indian
Corn to His Majesty, his Heirs and Successors for ever, in full and free
Discharge of all Rents and Services for the future whatsoever; in consideration
of the Release of the said Forty Pounds, and in consideration of the
confirmation of all Estates in this Island as aforesaid; and in acknowledgment
of his Majesty's Grace and Favor, in sending to, and appointing over us his
said Excellency, of whose Prudence and moderate Government, we have hertofore
had large experience, and do rest most assured thereof, for the future.

And forasmuch as nothing conduces more to the Peace and Prosperity of any
Place, and the Protection of every Single Person therein, than that the Public
Revenue thereof may be in some measure proportioned to the Public Charges and
Expenses, and also well weighing the great Charges that there must be of
necessity, in the maintaining the Honor and Dignity of His Majesty's Authority
here, the public Meeting of the Sessions, the often Attendance of the Council,
the Reparation of the Forts, the Building a Sessions House and a Prison, and
all other public Charges incumbent on the Government, do in consideration
thereof, give and grant unto his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors for ever;
And do most humbly desire your Excellency, to accept these our Grants; and we
humbly pray your Excellency, That it may be Enacted. And be it Enacted by his
Excellency Francis Lord Willoughby of Parham, Captain General and Chief

Growth or Produce of this Island, that shall be shipped off the same, shall be
paid to our Sovereign Lord the King, his Heirs and Successors for ever, Four
and a Half in Specie for every Five Score.

And be it further Enacted and Declared by the Authority aforesaid, That if any
Goods beforementioned, on which the said Custom is imposed and due by this
Act, shall at any time hereafter be Shipped or put into any Boat or other
Vessel, to the intent to be carried into any Parts beyond the Seas (the said
Imposition due for the same, not paid, compounded for, or lawfully tendered to
the Collectors or their Deputies, or not having agreed with the Commissioners
for that purpose to be appointed, or their Deputies, for the same, according to
the true intent and meaning of the said Act, That then, and from thenceforth,
shall the said Goods be forfeit, the one Moiety thereof to be to our Sovereign
Lord the King, and the other to him that shall Inform, Seize and Sue for the
same, in any Court of Record within this Island. Which Grants are left to your
Excellencies own way of Levying, in full Confidence and Assurance, That your
Excellency will take such course for the collecting and gathering of the said
Impost, without any Charge, Duty or Fees, as may be most for the ease of the
People of this Island.

Provided nevertheless, That neither this Act, nor any thing therein contained,
shall extend, or be construed to bar his Majesty, or his said Excellency from

been Appraised by Two Men of the same Parish; and if the Effects so Appraised,

Be it Enacted by his Excellency, Sir Richard Dutton, Knight, Captain General
and Governor in Chief of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the Honorable

neither live, nor have Land in either of the said Parishes, thereby commanding
them to cause so much of the said Line as is doubtful, to be run out by some
able Sworn Surveyor or Surveyors: And the said Justices are hereby empowered
and required to issue out their Warrant to the Churchwardens of the said
Parishes, to appear at a Place and Time, certain to see such Line laid out; and
also to such Surveyor or Surveyors, as the said Justices shall think fit,
requiring him or them to come at the said Time and Place to run out the said
Line; And the said Justices are also authorized to Summon all such Evidences
they shall judge convenient, for clearing upon Oath any Doubts or Matters
concerning the said Line; which Oath the said Justices have hereby full power
to administer.

And be it further Enacted, That the Charge of running out the said Lines, The
Charge to be born by both Parishes.
shall be born by both the said Parishes in such proportion as the said
Justices with regard to the clearness of the Right on either side, shall
appoint and determine; and if any Evidence or Witness shall fail to appear
according to Summons, so that by this means the Matter in Controversy cannnot
be decided; The said Justices may appoint another Meeting for that Purpose, at
the Charge of the Witness or Witnesses so failing, to be levied, in case of
Non-payment, by Warrant of Execution from the said Justices, as in case of
Servants Wages.

And where by virtue of the Line or Lines so run as aforesaid, any Parish
obtains an increase of Land, by taking in any Plantation or Parcel of Land into
the said Parish, which was not formerly accounted appurtenant, or part of the
said Parish, and paid Dues thereunto; Such Lands shall be from thence-forward
obliged to pay its proportion of all Parochial Taxes and Duties which shall be

paid in the P^rish where the Land ^^es, and to be discharged from the other
Parish.

of the respective Parishes, shall take order with all convenient speed for
making a good Wall or Pale, Churchyards to be enclosed.
or other decent and strong Fence about all Parts of the Churchyards belonging
to each Parish, with good Gates or other Passages into the same.

And the said Vestries have power by this Act to lay such Levies and Taxes upon
their respective Parishes, as shall be needful to this purpose; which shall be
collected in the same manner, and by the same Authority as all other Parish
Levies are.

No 300. An ACT for more speedy Remedy in Distresses taken Damage fesant, and
Trespasses done by Horses, Cattle, and other living Chattels.
WHereas it has been taken into consideration, that frequently very Costly,
and sometimes very Tedious Suits at Law do happen upon Replevins of Distresses
pretended to be taken Damage fesant, when indeed the Damage has been little or
nothing, and the Distress detained rather to vex and charge the Owner by
forcing him to sue Replevin, Than for any Harm done, or Satisfaction hoped
thereby, and sundry Evils tending to the impoverishment of the poorer sort, are
observed to follow the same. To Prevent the like for the future, and that the
Owner of the Distress may not be injured by too long detention thereof, nor the
other Party for want of due Satisfaction, and both have Right with the greatest
speed, ease and equity, and with the least Cost that may be,

It is hereby Ordained and Enacted by His Excellency Sir Richard Dutton,
Knight, Captain General and Chief Governor of this and other the
Charibbee-Islands, and by Authority of the same, That any Person or Persons

to Three of the Neighboring Freeholders, them requiring, or any Two of them,
to view and appraise the Damage: Upon return whereof, An Oath.
and Oath made by the Appraisers to the said Appraisment; as also Proof made of
the payment or tender of what the Damage was appraised unto; which the said
Justice has hereby full power to Administer. Or if the Party detaining, shall
not on Summons appear, or deliver the Goods detained, That then the Justice
aforesaid shall issue a Warrant instead of a Replevin, to the next or any other
Constable of the Parish, To re-deliver the Distresses.
where the Distress was taken, him requiring and commanding the said Distress
to take, and the same deliver and restore to the Complainant. Any Law or Custom
heretofore used to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

And it is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if the Party
distreining, or any other Person shall to frustrate the effect of this Act, or
so convey away such Distress, that the Constable cannot make deliverance
according to his Warrant, If the deliverance of the Distresses hindered, the
Offenders Person to be Arrested.
In such case the Constable shall take such Offender and bring him before the
said Justice, to whom if it appear he has so done, The said Justice shall
cause Chattles of the Parties, to the value, to be taken and delivered the
Complainant, or in want thereof, To lie in Goal till be re-deliver.
shall commit the Offender to Prison there, to remain until the said Distress
may be taken, and deliverance made by the Constable as aforesaid. And it shall
be lawful for the Justice or his Clerk to receive and take for each Warrant Six
Pence in Money, and for each Replevin Twelve Pence in Money.

Provided always, and it is the true intent and meaning hereof, that in case of
Distresses for Rent, If he or they dispute of Title.
or pretense of Title, where the Distress is taken, or upon pleading Property
to the Goods so distreined, That then the power hereby given the said Justice
of the Peace is immediately to cease, The Justices power to cease. To be tried
at Common Law.
and the Replevin to issue from the Common Law, where the same matter in
difference is to be decided and not otherwise.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person or
Persons pleading property as aforesaid, does not upon the Trial of the Cause
make good the same, the said Court, where such Trial is had, Treble Cost.
shall tax treble Cost against the Person so failing as aforesaid. Any Law to
the contrary notwithstanding.

No 303. An ACT to empower Attorneys to confess Judgment upon particular
Warrants.
WHereas it has been a usual and lawful Practice for many of the Inhabitants of
this Island, to confess Judgment by Warrant of Attorney directed to some one of
the Attorneys of his Majesty's Courts of Common Pleas, therein warranting and
desiring them, to appear before a certain Judge, naming the said Judge of his
Majesty's Court of Common Pleas held for a certain Precinct of this Island,
there before such Judge to confess Judgment, etc.

And whereas it has lately happened by Death and Removal of the Honorable the
Judges of this Island, from one Court to another, into other Precincts than
where they lived at the time of giving such Warrant as aforesaid; it becomes
impossible directly for the Attorney to pursue such Warrant, although the true
intent and meaning thereof is only relating to the Judgment, and not the
precise manner of doing the same.

And whereas many Inconveniences may thereby arise, in as much as Debtors
under those circumstances may either dispute or avoid their Judgments so to be
confessed as aforesaid: For prevention of which Inconveniency,

Be it Enacted by his Excellency Sir Richard Dutton, Knight, Captain General,
and Governor in Chief of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the Honorable
the Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by Authority of the same,
That in such Case where any of the Attorneys of his Majesty's Courts of Common
Pleas in this Island, have such Warrants of Attorney directed to them, to
confess Judgment before such Judge, that is since the giving of the same, dead
or removed from the Precincts where he was Judge at the time, Attorneys to
confess Judgment before the Judge of the Precincts, notwithstanding the death
or removal of the former Judge.
It shall and may be lawful for such Attorney or Attorneys by virtue of such
Warrant as aforesaid, to confess Judgment for such Sum or Sums of Money or
Sugar, as in the said Warrant is contained, before the present Judge of that
Precinct where the Judgment is to be confessed, by virtue of such Warrant.

Which said Judgment so to be confessed as aforesaid, The Judgment to be
effectual.
shall be as firm and binding, and as good and effectual in Law, as if the same
had been confessed before the Judge named in the said Warrant. And the Attorney
indempnified.
And the Attorney or Attorneys so confessing Judgment by virtue of such
Warrant, is hereby indempnified in so doing: Any Law, Custom or Construction to
the contrary notwithstanding.

No 306. How Pirates and Felonies done upon the Sea shall be tried and punished.
FOrasmuch as several Colonies and Plantations belonging to our most Gracious
Sovereign King Charles the Second in America, have been lately infested by a
dangerous sort of People called Pirates, who are not only Enemies to them of
His Majesty's Settlement, but of all Mankind: And for that the Persons said to
be Pirates, are most commonly Thieves, Robbers, Murderers and Man-slayers, and
other Misdoers contrary to the known Laws. And to the intent that all such that
shall be taken in or about this Island, or brought Prisoners hither, may be
proce^ded against according to the Statute made in the Twenty Eighth Year o^
^^^ry the Eighth, Declaring and Enacting how Pirates on the Seas shall be Tried
and Punished.

Be it therefore Enacted by his Excellency, Sir Richard Dutton, Knight, Captain
General, and Governor in Chief of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the
Honorable the Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by Authority of
the same, That whatsoever Person or Persons that are or shall be taken, sent or
brought to this Island Prisoners, for having committed Treason, Felonies,
Pyracies or other Offenses upon the Seas, or in any Creek, Haven or Bay in or
about this Island, shall be inquired, heard, tried and determined in this
Island, in such Form and Manner, as if such Offenses had been committed,
perpetrated and done upon the Land, Treason, Pyracy, etc. to be tried as
Offenses at Land.
by virtue of a Commission under His Majesty's Seal appointed for this and
other the Charibbee-Islands, signed by His Majesty's Governor or Commander in
Chief here for the time being, impowering one Person to be chief Judge,
together with Five or more substantial Persons by him in the said Commission to
be appointed, to hear, try and determine the Offenses aforesaid, after the
common course of the Laws of the Kingdom of England. And such as shall be
convicted of any such Offense or Offenses, by Verdict, Confession or Process,
by Authority of any such Commission, shall have and suffer such Pains of Death,
Loss of Lands Goods and Chattels, as if they had been attainted and convicted
of any such Crimes and Offenses done upon the Land: Any Law or Statute to the
contrary notwithstanding.

No 327. An Additional and Explanatory ACT to an ACT, Entitled, An ACT for the
Governing of Servants, and Ordaining Rights between Masters and Servants.
WHereas many Disputes have arisen, whether Servants, Laborers and Artificers,
and all Persons that by an Act for good governing of Servants, and Ordaining
the Rights between Masters and Servants, may recover their Wages and Debts
arising for Work done against the Executor or Administrator, before a Justice
of the Peace, as well as they might have recovered the same, against the
Testator or Intestate in their Lifetime. For Removing of which Doubts and
Disputes,

Be it Enacted and Declared by the Right Honorable Edwin Stead, His Majesty's
Lieutenant Governor, and Commander in Chief of this and other the
Charibbee-Islands, the Honorable the Council and General Assembly of this
Island, and by the Authority of the same, An Executor or Administrator to be
Sued for Wages before a Justice as Testator or Intestate.
That all Persons that by Virtue of the said Act, may Sue the Testator or
Intestate before a Justice of the Peace, shall have the like Remedy against the
Executor or Administrator.

And whereas it is by the said Act provided, that the Debt or Duty recoverable
before a Justice of the Peace, shall not be above the Sum of Four Thousand
Pounds of Sugar; so that the Balance of an Account often falls within that
Sum, when the Debt is much beyond it.

Be it therefore Declared and Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all
Persons, The Balance 4000 Pound of Sugar, or 25 Pound to be cognizable.
the Balance of whose Accounts for Wages or Work done, does not exceed the
value of Four Thousand Pounds of Sugar, or Five and Twenty Pounds Sterling, may
Sue before the Justice of the Peace, as by the Act aforesaid is appointed. And
the said Justice of the Peace has hereby full power to consider of the Value
of the Materials, that any Artificer upon Contract have made use of, together
with their Labor not exceeding the Sum aforesaid, as well as by the said Act
they may do of their Labor only: Any Law or Usage to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Eodem Die Passed the Council, and consented to by the Lieutenant Governor.
Passed the 15th Day of May, 1688.
No 328. An ACT to revive and continue diverse ACTS of this Island.
Expired.

No 329. An ACT for the Governing of Negroes.
WHereas the Plantations and Estates of this Island cannot be fully managed,
and brought into Use without the Labor and Service of great Numbers of Negroes
and other Slaves: And for as much as the said Negroes and other Slaves brought
unto the People of this Island for that purpose are of barbarous, wild and
salvage Natures, and such as renders them wholly unqualified, to be governed by
the Laws, Customs and Practices of our Nations. It therefore becoming
absolutely necessary, that such other Constitutions, Laws and Orders, should be
in this Island framed and Enacted for the good regulating and ordering of them,
as may both restrain the Disorders, Rapines and Inhumanities to which they are
naturally prone and inclined, with such Encouragements and Allowances as are
fit and needful to their Support, that from both this Island through the
Blessing of God thereon, may be preserved, His Majesty's Subjects in their
Lives and Fortunes secured, and the Negroes and other Slaves be well provided
for, and guarded from the Cruelties and Insolences of themselves or other
ill-tempered People or Owners. To which purpose,

Be it Enacted and Ordained by the Right Honorable Edwyn Steed, his Majesty's
Lieutenant Governor, and Commander in Chief of this and other the
Charribee-Islands, the Honorable the Council and General Assembly of this
Island, and by Authority of the same, That no Master Mistress, Commissioner or
Overseer, of any Family in this Island, shall give their Negroes or other
Slaves leave on Sabbath Days, Holy Days or any other time, to go out of their
Plantations, except such Negro or other Slave as usually wait upon them at Home
or Abroad, and wearing a Livery, And no other Negro or Slave, except with a
Ticket under the Master or Mistress Hand, or some other Person by his or her
appointment, specifying the time allowed for his or her return, upon pain of
forfeiting for every Negro or other Slave so licensed to go Abroad, Two
Shillings, and Six Pence Sterling, half of the said Fine to be to the Informer,
and the other to the public Treasury. And if any Master, Mistess, Commssioner
or Overseer of a Plantation shall find any Negro, or other Slave in their
Plantation at any time, without a Ticket or Business from his said Master and
does not apprehend them, or endeavor so to do, and having apprehended them,
shall not punish them with a Moderate Whipping, shall forfeit Ten Shillings
Sterling, to be disposed of as aforesaid.

And for that as it is absolutely necessary to the safety of this Place, That
all due care be taken to restrain the Wanderings and Meetings of Negroes and
other Slaves at all times, more espcially on Saturday Nights, Sundays and other
Holy Days, and their using, and carrying of Clubs, Wooden-Swords, or other
mischevious and dangerous Weapons, or using or keeping of Drums, Horns, or
other loud Instruments, which may call together, or give Sign or Notice to one
another of their wicked Designs and Purposes; and that all Masters, Overseers,
and others may be encouraged and enjoined diligently and carefully to prevent
the same,

Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall be lawful for all
Masters, Overseers, and other Persons whatsoever, to apprehend and take up any
Negro, or other Slave that shall be found out of the Plantation of his, or
their Master or Owner, at any time, especially on Saturday Nights, Sundays or
other Holy Days not being on lawful business, and with a Letter from their
Master, or a Ticket, or not having a white Man with them (except only such
Negroes or other Slaves as usually attend their Masters, and have on a Livery)
and the said Negro or other Slave or Slaves, correct by a moderate Whipping;
and after Notice given to their Master, Owner or Overseer, him or them detain,
until the said Master, Owner or Overseer pay to the said Person that took him
up, Two Shillings and Six Pence for every such Negro or other Slave; he making
Oath before the next Justice of the Peace (if thereunto required) by the Owner
of such Negro or other Slave, that he found or saw no Letter or Ticket with
him, as also any Negro or other Slave or Slaves met or found out of the
Plantation of his or their Master or Mistress, though with a Letter or Ticket,
If he or they be armed with such Clubs or other Offensive Weapons aforesaid,
him or them so disarmed, take up and whip, and shall receive the same Reward as
aforesaid, from the Master or Owner of such Negro or other Slave or Slaves; And
whatsoever Master, Owner or Overseer shall permit or suffer his or their Negro
or other Slave or Slaves, at any time hereafter to beat Drums, blow Horns, or
use any other loud Instruments, and shall not cause his Negro-Houses once every
Week to be diligently searched, and such Instruments if any be found, cause to
be burned; or whosoever shall suffer and countenance any public Meeting or
Feasting of Strange Negroes or other Slaves in their Plantations, shall forfeit
Fifty Shillings Sterling for every such Offense, upon Conviction, or Proof as
aforesaid, Provided an Information or other Suit be commenced within One Month
after Forfeiture thereof for the same.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That every Overseer of a
Family in this Island, shall cause all his Negro Houses to be searched
diligently and effectually once every Fourteen Days for Fugitive and Runaway
Slaves, Clubs, Wooden-Swords, and other mischievous Weapons; and finding any
so, to take them away, and cause them to be burned; as also For Clothes, Goods
and any other things and Commodities that are not given them by their Master,
Mistress, Commander or Overseer, and honestly come by; in whose Custody they
find any thing of that kind, and suspect or know to be Stolen Goods, the same
they shall seize and take into their Custody; and a full and ample Description
of the particulars thereof in Writing, within Six Days after the Discovery
thereof, to send to the Clerk of the Parish for the time being, who is hereby
required to receive the same, and to enter upon it the Day of its Receipt, and
the particulars to file and keep to himself; and shall set upon the Posts of
the Church Door, a short Brief that such lost Goods are found; whereby any
Person that has lost his Goods, may the better come to the Knowledge where
they are, by further enquiring for Stolen Goods, until he shall first declare
what he has lost, and the Marks and Descriptions thereof, and paid him Twelve
Pence for the same; by which, if the Clerk shall be convinced, That any part of
the Goods certified to him to be found, appertains to the Party enquiring, he
is to direct the said Party enquiring, to the (...) and Party where his Goods
be, who is hereby required to make (...) ^f what is in being, to the true
Owner, upon the Penalt^ (...) Forfeitures of Twenty Shillings Sterling for
every neglect by ^^e Overseer or Clerks aforesaid in any of the particulars
aforesaid.

And for the more effectual detecting and punishing such Persons that trade
with any Slaves for Stolen Goods,

Be it further Enacted, that where any Person shall be suspected to trade as
aforesaid, any Two Justices of the Peace, or the Justices of the Quarter
Sessions of the Peace, shall have power to take from him sufficient
Recognizance not to trade with any Slaves contrary to the Laws of this Island;
and if it shall afterward appear to the Justices of the Quarter Sessions, that
such Person has, or has had, or Shipped off any Goods suspected to be
unlawfully come by, such Person being called before the Justices at the next
Quarter Sessions following, shall there be obliged to make reasonable Proof of
whom he bought, or how he came by the said Goods; and unless he do it, his
Recognizance shall be forfeited.

And be it further Enacted and Ordained, That if any Negro or Slave whatsoever,
shall offer any Violence to any Christian, by striking or the like, such Negro
or other Slave shall for his or her first Offense, by Information given upon
Oath to the next Justice, be severely whipped by the Constable, by Order of the
said Justice. For his Second Offense of that nature, by Order of the Justice of
Peace, he shall be severely whipped, his Nose slit, and be burned in some part
of his Face with a Hot Iron. And for his Third Offense, he shall receive by
Order of the Governor and Council, such greater Punishment as they shall think
meet to inflict. Provided always, That such Striking or Conflict be not in the
Lawful Defense of their Master's, Mistresses or Owners of their Families or of
their Goods.

And it is hereby further Enacted, That all the Slaves within this Island,
shall have Clothes once every Year (that is to say) Drawers and Caps for Men,
and Petty-Coats and Caps for Women, upon pain of Forfeiting Five Shillings for
each Slave that shall not be clothed as aforesaid; one Third to the Informer,
the other Two Thirds to His Majesty, for the use of the Poor of the Parish
where the Offender lives.

And it is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Persons who
shall hereafter take up any Runaway or Fugitive Negro, or other Slave or
Slaves, not knowing the Master or Owner of such Negro or Slave, and shall bring
them unto the Provost-Marshal or his Deputy, shall receive Ten Shillings
Sterling from the Treasurer for the time being, who is hereby appointed to pay
the same: And in case he shall refuse to make the said Payment upon presentment
of the said Negro, or other Slave or Slaves, and thereof Oath to be made before
any Justice of the Peace, the said Justice is hereby authorized and required,
to direct his Warrant to any Constable, to cause the Value thereof to be
immediately levied out of the Goods of the said Treasurer, and the said Goods
to be delivered to the said Party. And the Negroes so brought, shall be kept in
the Cage at the Stepping-Stones by the Provost Marshal, and not in Goal; which
said Cage is always to be kept in sufficient Repair, at the Public Charge of
this Island.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be
lawful for the said Provost Marshal, to retain and keep in his Custody as
aforesaid, the Body of all such Run-aways, until the Owner of them shall pay
unto the said Treasurer, Eleven Shillings Sterling; and also unto the said
Provost Marshal, Four Pence for every Four and Twenty Hours the said Fugitive
Slave has been in his Custody, and also until he have a Discharge under the
Hand of the said Treasurer or his Clerk. And the Turn-Key shall receive Six
Pence for every Negro delivered: Provided always, That the said Provost Marshal
do furnish the said Negroes and other Slaves, with sufficient Food and Drink,
which is to be proved upon Oath, if by the Owner of the Negro or other Slaves
it shall be so required to be done.

And it is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any of the said
Slaves shall dye for want of Food, the said Provost Marshal shall be
responsible for them to the Owners: And if the said Marshal suffer any Slave to
escape before he be duly delivered by a Discharge in Writing under the Hand of
the abovesaid Treasurer, the Provost Marshal shall pay unto him the aforesaid
Treasurer, Eleven Shillings, and shall make further Satisfaction to the Owner,
as by the Governor and Council shall be thought fit: And if the said Provost

due Delivery as aforesaid, he shall forfeit for each Slave so suffered as

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all such Persons as
shall apprehend and bring down any Runaway Slave or Slaves to St. Michael's
Town, unto the Treasurer for the time being, or to the Cage, shall upon such
bringing down of such Runaway Slave or Slaves, deliver upon Oath to the said
Treasurer, or in case of his Sickness or Absence, to any Justice of the Peace,
to be by him returned to the Treasurer's Office (before he shall receive the
Consideration before appointed) an Account of his Name and Place of Abode, with
the Time when, and Place where he apprehended such Fugitive Slave or Slaves;
And that he knew of no Ticket the Negro had, nor the Owner of such Negro or
Slave, which the said Treasurer is hereby required to take and enter into a
Book; to the intent that all Owners of Slaves may come to the right Knowledge
and Understanding when their Slaves were Apprehended, and by whom, and whether
they might be wrongfully taken up, or not; and that the Keeper of the Cage at
the delivery of any Slaves, do take a Receipt of the Person to whom delivered,
and there insert the Mark or Description of the Slave delivered.

And whereas diverse Evil and Ill-disposed Persons, have hitherto attempted to
steal away Slaves by specious Pretense of promising them Freedom in another
Country, against which pernicious Practices, no Punishment suitable has been
yet provided,

Be it therefore Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That what
Person soever shall directly or indirectly at any time after Publication
hereof, tempt or persuade any Negroes or other Slaves to leave their Masters or
Mistresses Service to whom they are Slaves, out of an Intent and Design to
carry away any of them off this Island, or to conceal or Entertain any of them
upon this Island, or howsoever to defraud the said Masters or Mistresses of
them, and be thereof convicted by their own Confession, or the Oath of One
Credible Witness, shall be by the Two next Justices of the Peace where the
Injured Person lives, whereof One to be of the Quorum, adjudged to pay the
Master of the said Negro or other Slave, Five and Twenty Pounds Sterling, to be
levied as in the case of Servants Wages: But in case the Party offending shall
not be found worth Lands, Goods or Chattels, to the value aforesaid; then shall
the Justice for so long time as will recompense the Party injured for the
Twenty Five Pounds aforesaid, adjudge him Servant for Five Years to the Party
injured, and so deliver him over to him, and make a Record thereof. But if any
Man shall so tempt and practice with any Persons, Negroes or other Slaves, and
them actually so attempted, convey away, or send off the Island, and be after
Apprehended and convicted for the same in this Island, he shall be by the Two
next Justices of the Peace as aforesaid, condemned to pay the Owner of such
Negro or other Slave, Three times the Value of him or them, and Execution for
the same from the Two Justices, to issue accordingly, as in the case of
Servants Wages: And if the Person so offending, has no Estate, then he shall be
ordered by the Justices to serve the Party injured as aforesaid.

And whereas many heinous and grievous Crimes, as Murders, Burglaries, Robbing
in the Highways, Rapes, Burning of Houses or Canes, be many times committed by
Negroes and other Slaves, and many times maliciously attempted by them to be
committed, in which, though by diverse Accidents they are prevented, yet are
their Crimes nevertheless heinous, and therefore deserve the like Punishment:
And also do many times Steal wilfully, Kill, Maim or Destroy one or more
Horses, Mares, Geldings, Cattle, Sheep or other Quick or Dead thing of the like
nature, and of the Value of Twelve Pence or above: And many times by attempting
to steal from the Inhabitants of this Island, Stock and other Goods
beforementioned, of above or under the value aforesaid, do put such
Inhabitants or some of his Family in Terror, Dread and Jeopardy of their Lives,
which several Offenders for danger of Escape, are not long to be imprisoned:
And being Brutish Slaves, deserve not, for the Baseness of their Condition, to
be tried by the Legal Trial of Twelve Men of their Peers or Neighborhood,
which neither truly can be rightly done as the Subjects of England are, nor is
Execution to be delayed toward them, in case of such horrid Crimes committed.

It is therefore Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That when any
such Crime as aforesaid, shall be committed, or attempted to be committed, by
any Negroes, Slave or Slaves, and the said Criminals be apprehended and brought
before any of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace within this Island, and the
Justices before whom the Criminals are brought, shall take Security for their
forth coming, or send them to Prison, and with all convenient speed, shall join
with him the next Justice of the Peace; And these Two shall by their Warrant or
Precept, call to them Three Able, Good and Legal Freeholders of the Place
nearest where the said Crimes were committed, and these Five Persons, viz. The
Two Justices and the Three Freeholders, shall hear and examine all Evidences,
Proofs and Testimonies, or by violent Circumstances they shall find such Negro
or other Slave or Slaves guilty thereof, they shall give Sentence of Death upon
them accordingly, the said Freeholders being first Sworn before the Two
Justices, who are hereby empowered to administer the same, and forthwith by
their Warrant cause Execution to be done upon such Negro or Negroes, Slave or
Slaves, by some Negro to be pressed for that purpose, by some Constable, to be
appointed by Warrant from the said Justices.

It is further Provided, That if any Freeholder shall make default to appear
upon such Summons before the Justices, as is before mentioned, or appearing,
refuse to join with them as is before appointed, and do show no Cause for such
Default, to be approved by the said Justices, then the aforesaid Justices do
set a Fine upon him of Fifty Shillings Sterling, forthwith by their Warrant or
Precept to the next Constable, or what Constable they shall think fit, to levy
the same upon the said Freeeholders, their Goods or Chattels accordingly. And
if any Person shall send off his Negro that has killed another, he shall pay
unto the Master of such Negro, the Value of such Negro so killed as aforesaid.
And in regard great Mischiefs daily happen by the Petty Larcenies, committed
also by the Negroes and Slaves of this Island,

Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Negro or other
Slave shall hereafter steal or destroy any Goods, Chattels and Provisions,
Canes or green Corn whatsoever of any other Persons than his Master's or
Mistresses, being under the value of Twelve Pence, every Negro or other Slave
so offending, and being brought before some Justice of the Peace of this
Island, upon Complaint of the Party injured, and shall be adjudged guilty by
Confession, Proof or probable Circumstances, such Negro or Slave so offending
(excepting Children, whose Punishment is left wholly to the Discretion of the
said Justice, shall be adjudged by such Justice to be publicly and severely
whipped, not exceeding Forty Lashes; and the said Justice shall order and cause
the Owner of such Negro or other Slave, to make Satisfaction to the Party
injured; and if such Negro or other Slave punished as aforesaid, be afterward
found guilty of the like Crimes aforesaid, under the value of Twelve Pence as
aforesaid, he or they for such, his or their Second Offense, shall by Order of
the Justice of Peace before whom such Complaint and Proof is made, have his or
their Noses slit, and be branded in the Forehead with a hot Iron, that the Mark
thereof may remain: And the said Justices shall order the Owner of such Negro
or other Slave, to make Satisfaction to the Party injured, double the value of
what his Loss shall appear: And if such Negro or other Slave after the Second
time as aforesaid, be accused of Petty Larceny, or of any of the Offenses
before mentioned, such Negro or other Slave shall be tried in such manner as
Murder, Burglary, etc. are provided for to be Tried; and if such Negro or
other Slave as shall be Tried, shall be found guilty a Third time of any the
Offenses aforementioned, then such Negro or other Slave for that Third
Offense, shall be adjudged to suffer Death, in the manner as is appointed in
Cases of Murder as aforesaid; or other Punishments as the said Justices shall
think fit. And in case the said Justices and Freeholders, and any or either of
them, shall neglect or refuse to perform the Duties by this Act required of
them, they shall severally for such their respective Defaults, forfeit the just
Sum of Five and Twenty Pounds Sterling.

And it is further Enacted, Ordained and Published by the Authority aforesaid,
That if any Negroes or other Slaves, shall make Mutiny or Insurrection, or rise
in Rebellion against this Place or People, or make preparation of Arms, Powder,
Bullets, or Offensive Weapons, or hold any Council or Conspiracy of, or raising
Mutiny or Rebellion against this Island, as has been formerly attempted; that
then for speedy Remedy thereof, the Governor of the Island, or Superior
Officer for the time being, appoint a Colonel and the Field Officers of the
Regiment of this Island, or any Four of them, to meet in Council, and proceed
by the Marshal Law against the Actors, Contrivers, Raisers, Fomenters and
Concealers of such Mutiny or Rebellion, and them punish by Death or other Pains
as their Crimes shall deserve; As to the aforesaid Colonel and Field Officers,
or any Four of them shall seem fit. Now forasmuch as the Loss of the Negroes
and other Slaves that shall suffer Death by this Act, would prove so heavy for
the Owner of them only to bear, and that the Owners of Negroes may not be
discouraged to detect and discover the Offenses of their Negroes; and that the
Loss may be born by the Public, whose safety by such Punishments is hereby
provided for and intended.

Be it Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That in all cases
whatsoever, where any Negro or other Slave, by the appointment and Provision of
this Act shall suffer Death, then shall such Justices and Freeholders, Colonel
and Field Officers, who adjudged such Negro or other Slave to suffer Death,
immediately after Sentence thereof given, inquire by the best means they are
able, of the Value of such Negro or other Slave, in which Value they shall
never exceed the Sum of Five and Twenty Pounds Sterling, for any One Negro or
other Slave, and also the Damage of the Party injured, and make Certificate
thereof to the Treasurer for the Time being, therein requiring the said
Treasurer to pay out of the Value of the said Negro or Negroes, the Value of
the Damage to the Party injured: And the Overplus if any be, to the Owner or
Owners of such Negro or other Slaves; and if there be no Party injured, then
the whole Value to the Owner or Owners of the said Negroes or other Slaves, and
if there be no Party injured, then the whole Value of the Danger or Dangers of
the said Negroe or other Slave out of the Public Treasury of this Island. But
in regard there are some Masters and Owners of Negroes and other Slaves in this
Island, who do not make sufficient Conscience of providing what is necessary
for their Negroes or other Slaves, or allowing them time to Plant or Provide
for themselves; for which cause such Negroes or other Slaves, are necessitated
to commit Crimes contrary to the Law; and yet the safety of this Island
requiring, that such Negroes and other Slaves shall suffer as the Law has
appointed, rather than the poor Inhabitants of this Island be ruined, and
driven from hence by their means. That therefore such Masters and Owners of
Negroes and other Slaves whose neglect of Negroes and other Slaves, makes them
in some measure guilty of their Crimes, may not be countenanced therein at the
Charge of the Public.

Be it hereby further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Justices and
Freeholders appointed as aforesaid, to enquire into the Value of such Negro or
other Slave as they shall sentence to Death, shall also further enquire by
Witnesses examined on their Oaths, or by their good Information, how the Owner
or Owners of such Negro or other Slave, condemned as aforesaid, was provided
with Provision and other Necessaries, and what Allowances those Negroes and
other Slaves had received. And if it shall appear to the said Justices and
Freeholders, or the Major part of them, that the said Master or Owner had not
provided reasonably and as is generally accustomed for Negroes and other
Slaves, and that necessity might have compelled the said Negro or other Slave
to the Offenses they have committed, Then and in that case, the Justices and
Freeholders as aforesaid, shall certify the same to the Treasurer aforesaid,
and only appoint the said Treasurer to pay the Damage to the Party injured, out
of the Value of the said Negro or other Slave, and nothing to such Master or
Owner. And if the Treasurer for the time being (having sufficient Public Stock
in his Hands) shall fail to make Satisfaction and Payment to such Master or
Owner of any Negro or other Slave, he having the Governor's Warrant for the
same, the Party injured shall have an Action of Debt upon such Certificate as
aforesaid, against the said Treasurer in the Court of Common Pleas for the
Precincts of St. Michael's, etc. And the Treasurer being thereto duly summoned,
shall at the First Court after Summons, plead and come to Trial, or else
Judgment to pass against him by Default; and after Judgment, Execution
immediately to issue for Satisfaction. And in regard the Planters necessity
does compel them for the Managemnt only of their Lands, to keep so vast a Stock
of Negroes and other Slaves, whose desperate Lives and great Numbers become
dangerous to them, and all other the Inhabitants. That therefore such who are
not bound up by that necessity in having Plantations of their own, and hired
Land, may not increase the danger to this Island, by keeping Negroes or other
Slaves to hire out to others,

Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That no Person of the
Hebrew Nation residing in any Seaport Town of this Island, shall keep or
employ any Negro or other Slave, be he Man or Boy, for any Use or Service
whatsoever, more than one Negro or other Slave, Man or Boy to be allowed to
each of the Persons of the said Nation, except such as are Denizen'd by His
Majesty's Letters Patents, and not otherwise, who are to keep no more than for
their own use, as shall be approved by the Governor, Council and Assembly: And
if any Negro, Man or Boy, more than is before allowed by this Act, shall be
found Three Months after Publication hereof, in the Custody, Possession or Use
of any the Persons aforesaid, then every such Person or Persons, shall forfeit
such Negro or other Slave, one Moiety of the Value thereof to whomsoever shall
inform, and the other Moiety to His Majesty, to the Uses in this Act appointed.

And whereas diverse Negroes and other Slaves at this present are, and have been
long since run away into Woods and other Fastness of this Island, doing
continually much Mischief to the Inhabitants of this Island, hiding themselves
sometimes in one Place, and sometimes in another, so that they are not to be
found without much difficulty,

Be it therefore Enacted, That from and after Publication hereof, it shall and
may be lawful for any Justice of the Peace, Constable or Captain of a Company
within this Island, that shall have notice of the Residency or Hiding Place of
any Runaway Negroes, or other Fugitive Slaves, to Raise and Arm any number of
Men, not exceeding Twenty, to apprehend and take them, either Alive or Dead.
And for every Negro or other Slave that they shall take alive, having been run
away above Six Months from his Master, they shall receive Fifty Shillings
Sterling; and for every Negro or other Slave that they shall take alive, having
been run away above Twelve Months Five Pound from the Master or Commanders of
the said Negro or other Slave; if killed in taking, they shall receive Fifty
Shillings Sterling from the Public; any Act or Statute heretofore to the
contrary notwithstanding.

And it is further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That if any
Negro or other Slave under Punishment by his Master or his Order for running
away, or any other Crimes or Misdemeanors toward his said Master,
unfortunately shall suffer in Life or Member, which seldom happens; no Person
whatsoever shall be liable to any Fine therefore. But if any Man shall of
wantonness, or only of Bloody Mindedness, or Cruel Intention, wilfully kill a
Negro or other Slave of his own, he shall pay into the Public Treasury,
Fifteen Pounds Sterling: But if he shall so kill another Man's, He shall pay to
the Owner of the Negro, double the Value, and into the Public Treasury, Twenty
Five Pounds Sterling. And he shall further by the next Justice of the Peace, be
bound to the good Behavior during the Pleasure of the Governor and Council,
and not be liable to any other Punishment or Forfeiture for the same; neither
is he that kills another Man's Negro or other Slave by Accident, liable to any
other Penalty but the Owner's Action at Law. But if any poor small Freeholder
or other Person, kill a Negro or other Slave by Night, out of the Road or
Common Path, and Stealing, or attempting to Steal, his Provision, Swine or
other Goods, he shall not be accountable for it: Any Law, Statute or Ordinance
to the contrary notwithstanding.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all the Fines and
Forfeitures arising by this Act, shall be to His Majesty for the use of this
Island, according to such uses and proportion that in the aforesaid Clauses are
respectively appointed; and such thereof as are not otherwise limited and
appointed in this Act, as are above the Sum of Five Pounds Sterling, shall be
recovered by Bill, Plaint or Information, in any of his Majesty's Courts of
Record within this Island; and such as are of the Sum aforesaid, or under,
shall be recovered before any Justice of the Peace within this Island, who is
hereby required to grant Execution for the same, as in the case of Servants
Wages, Provided the same be commenced within Thirty Days after the same be
forfeited.

And lastly, to the intent this Act and every Clause and Branch thereof may
receive full Execution, and no Person plead Ignorance therein,

It is Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That this Act be Read
and Published in all the respective Parish Churches in this Island, the first
Sunday in February, and the first Sunday in August in every Year ensuing.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Acts heretofore
made concerning, or any ways relating to the Governing of Negroes, Enacted
before the Date of this Act, shall be Repealed, and are hereby Repealed to all
Intents and Purposes whatsoever.

Negroes, Cattle, Coppers and Stills and other Goods in great Lots or Numbers to

Goods are often bought at under Rates and Value. Wherefore for Prevention of
the said Inconveniences for the future,

Be it Enacted by the Right Honorable Edwin Stead, His Majesty's Lieutenant
Governor, and Commander in Chief of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the
Honorable the Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by Authority of

extort more for their respective Fees, than by Law is established for them, and
that the Inhabitants may the better know what Fees are appointed to be paid,

rendered less and less capable, through the growing interest of the said Debts,
not only to pay them, but to continue the improvements of the said Four Hundred
and Fourteen Acres, for want of such Stock as it at present needs. For Redress

No 377. An ACT appointing an Oath to be taken by all such as by the Laws of
this Island are or shall be empowered to hear and determine Writs of Error and
Petitions of Grievances, and all other Matters of Equity whatsoever.
WHereas by the ancient Customs, Laws and Practices of this Island, the
Governor and Council for the time being, have always set to hear and determine
all Matters and Controversies in Error and Equity; Which Custom and Practice
has hitherto been continued in this Island, and believed to be part of the
business of the Council, to which they thought themselves obliged by their Oath
of Councellor.

But forasmuch as some Doubts and Scruples have lately arisen touching the
authority of the Council to set and judge in the Matters aforesaid, without a
distinct Oath, and that it is therefore necessary that some other Oath should
be taken by the Members thereof, more fully to qualify them to act therein,

Be it therefore Enacted and Ordained, and it is hereby Enacted and Ordained by
his Excellency Colonel James Kendal, Captain General and Commander in Chief of
this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the Honorable the Council and General
Assembly of this Island, and by Authority of the same, That from and after the
Date hereof, no Person shall be admitted to set and judge in the aforesaid
Matters, until he has first taken the following Oath: You do Swear, That you
will according to the best of your Skill, Conscience and Judgment, do equal
Right, Law and Justice to their Majesty's and all their Subjects and People,
both Rich and Poor, without Favor or Affection, Hatred or Malice, or having
regard to any Person whatsoever, that has any Matter, Cause or Thing at any
time depending before you. So help you God, etc.

Which said Oath the Governor for the time being, is hereby empowered to
administer to each Member that is to set and determine in the matters aforesaid.

And be it further Provided by the Authority aforesaid, That whereas his
Excellency is by the Laws of this Island, greatly entrusted in determining all
the Matters aforesaid, and of consequence is become included in the Oath
aforesaid, and there being no sufficient Authority to administer unto him the
said Oath,

Be it Enacted, That his Excellency taking the same Oath of his own
Administration, shall be as effectual compliance with this Act, as if done by a
Dedimus specially obtained therefore.

No 378. An ACT for encouragement of all Negroes and Slaves, that shall
discover any Conspiracy.
WHereas sundry of the Negroes and Slaves of this Island, have been long
preparing, contriving and designing a most horrid, bloody, damnable and
detestable Rebellion, Massacre, Assassination and Destruction by them to be
committed, done and perpetrated upon and against all the white Inhabitants
hereof. But before this should be effected, it has pleased Almighty God to
give us a gracious Deliverance by a miraculous discovery thereof.

To the end such barbarous Purposes and Practices may be prevented for the
future, and that such Negroes and Slaves as are not infected and drawn in by
the wicked and devilish instigations of others may not be excited thereto, nor
perverted in point of their obedience, but may be encouraged to continue
orderly and quietly, and discover so soon as shall come to their Knowledge, any
Design, Purpose or Intent of any Negro or other Slave, to commit or abet any
Insurrection or Rebellion.

Be it Enacted by his Excellency Colonel James Kendal, Captain General and
Chief Governor of this and other the Charribee-Islands, the Honorable the
Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by the Authority of the same,
That whatsoever Negro or Slave shall after Publication hereof, hear any other
Negro or Slave, speak or utter any Words tending to Mutiny, Insurrection or
Rebellion, or shall have or prepare any Gunpowder, Ball, Sword, Lance or
other warlike Instrument than what are allowed for watching or other Service of
the Country, and shall forthwith discover the same to any Justice of the Peace
of this Island, The said Justice shall join himself to the next Justice of the
Peace, and they two are hereby empowered and required to cause the said Negro
or other Slave so accused, forthwith to be apprehended, and the Accuser and
Accused to be brought Face to Face, and shall diligently inquire into the said
Matter: And if they shall find the Accusation just, they shall secure the said
Negro or Slave, and report the said Matter to his Excellency or other Governor
for the time being, who is hereby humbly requested to appoint Field-Officers to
try the said Negro or Slave, as by the Act entitled, An Act for the Governing
of Negroes is provided, who are to proceed accordingly. And if they the said
Field Officers shall find the said Negro or Slave guilty of what he or she
stands accused, and shall condemn him or her to suffer Death, Such Field
Officers shall appraise the Condemned Negro as by the said Act is appointed:
But the Negro which accuses the other, the Field Officers shall appraise at his
or her full Value and worth, although it exceed the Sum by the said Act
limited; of which the said Field Officers shall forthwith certify his
Excellency or the Governor for the time being upon Oath; who is hereby
requested to draw an Order on the Treasurer for that Sum which such Accuser is
valued at, to be paid to the Owner of such Negro or Slave at sight. And upon
Payment thereof, his Excellency or the Governor for the time being, is
requested to declare the said Negro or Slave free, and such Negro shall be sent
off this Island by the Treasurer, to such Place where he or she shall desire,
who is hereby required to pay for such Negroes Passage. But if such Negro had
rather stay here with his Master, Mistress or Family, and not be Free, such
Negro shall receive Forty Shillings to his own use from the said Treasurer. And
if any Negro or Slave shall not make good his or her Accusation against such
Negro or Slave as he or she shall accuse, such Negro or Slave shall receive
such Punishment, not to extend to Life or Member, as by order of the said Two
Justices or Field Officers who shall hear the Matter, shall think fit.

No 379. An Additional ACT to an ACT, Entitled, An ACT for the Governing of
Negroes.
WHereas by an Act of this Island, Entitled, An Act for the Governing of
Negroes, bearing Date the Eighth Day of August, One Thousand, Six Hundred,
Eighty and Eight, amongst other things it was Enacted in these Words.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Acts heretofore
made concerning or relating any ways to the governing of Negroes enacted before
the Date of this Act, shall be Repealed, and are hereby Repealed to all Intents
and Purposes whatsoever.

And whereas by a former Act of this Island, Entitled, Recital of a former Act.
A Supplemental Act to a former Act, Entitled, An Act for the better Ordering
and Governing of Negroes, bearing Date the One and Twentieth Day of April, One
Thousand, Six Hundred, Seventy and Six, it was Enacted in these Words, viz.
That if any Negro or Slave after he has lived in this Island for the space of
Twelve Months at least, shall run away from his Master or Mistress, and
continue absent above the space of Thirty Days, such Negro or Slave shall
suffer Death for the same, the Offense to be tried as the Offenses expressed in
the first Branch of this Act; and the Owner of such Negro or Slave, shall be
allowed his reasonable Value from the public Treasury of this Island, in the
same manner as is allowed for other Negroes that suffer Death by this Act.
Which last mentioned Act was often revived and continued; but the same Clause
after some Negroes had suffered Death for running away as aforesaid was
Repealed, it being expected, that others would have taken warning thereby, and
not have been guilty of such Offense for the future.

And forasmuch as the first mentioned Act now in force, bearing Date the Eighth
Day of August, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Eighty and Eight, has made no
Provision, That such Slaves as absent themselves Thirty Days, shall suffer
Death as aforesaid; and such is their brutish and barbarous Nature, that they
will not be reclaimed by any fair means, But by the often running away of
Negroes and Slaves, and by their long Absence from the Service of their Owners,
they become desperate, and daily plotting, commit Felonies and other
Enormities, not only to the terror and affrightment of the Neighborhood, but
the danger of the Island in general.

Be it Enacted by his Excellency Colonel James Kendal, Captain General and
Chief Governor of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the Honorable the
Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by the Authority of the same,
That if after Publication of this Act, any Negro or Negroes, or other Slave or
Slaves, after he, she or they have lived in this Island one whole Year,
Runaway 30 Days, to suffer Death.
that is, are or shall run away and absent him, her or themselves from the
Service of his, her or their Master, Mistress or other Persons with whom he,
she or they reside, and shall continue absent for and during the space of
Thirty Days, shall suffer Death for the same, the said Offense and Offenses to
be tried in the like manner by Two Justices of the Peace, and Three
Freeholders, as other Criminals in and by the said Act now in force (to which
this is an Addition) are appointed to be tried, Such Negro or Slave to be
valued by them the said Justices and Freeholders; which Value the Owner thereof
shall be paid and allowed out of the Public Treasury of this Island, as is
allowed for other Negroes that suffer Death by the said Act.

that he will write to the Lords of the Committee to interceed with Their
Majesty's to permit a Regiment of Soldiers designed for the Leeward for the
Expedition against the French, may after such Expedition is over, remain here
for the reinforcement and defense hereof.

Be it Enacted by his Excellency Colonel James Kendal, Captain General, and
Chief Governor of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the Honorable the
Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by Authority of the same, That
in case Their Majesty's will please graciously to appoint a Regiment of
Soldiers to be sent up hither from the Leeward Islands, after the Expedition is
over, to remain here during this present War; Soldiers to have free Quarter.
Such Soldiers shall have and receive Free-Quarters here, viz. Meat, Drink and

Be it Enacted by his Excellency Colonel James Kendal, Captain General and
Chief Governor of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the Honorable the
Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by the Authority of the same,
That whatsoever Person or Persons after Publication hereof, shall sell any Rum

Appurtenances lying and being in the said Parish of Christ-church, and Island
aforesaid, containing by estimation in the whole, Two Hundred Forty Five Acres,
be the same more or less; And being so seized, the said William Kirton did by

his Body to be begotten; And did thereby also make and appoint several

And whereas the said Philip Kirton Son of the said William Kirton, had issue

But forasmuch as that the said Philip has not any Stock of Negroes or Cattle
to manure the said Lands, which for want thereof, lie desolate, and are of no
profit or benefit to the said Philip Kirton, to support himself and Family,
part of which Lands have been already Attached and extended for Military
Duties, and Parochial Charges, and the Quantity will be daily lessened by such
unavoidable Encumbrances; To Prevent which Mischiefs, there is no means left

Plantation or Plantations, Lands and Premises, and thereby Dock all Intails and
Bar all Remainders depending on the Estate Tail, created by the said Will.

Right or Title in Remainder or Reversion by the said Will, are for ever hereby

and his Heirs, are hereby enabled to make any Sale or Disposition of the said
Lands and Premises, with their Appurtenances, to any Person or Persons
whatsoever, and to their Heirs and Assigns; any Law, Custom or Usage to the
contrary notwithstanding.

No 428. A Supplemental and Explanatory ACT to an ACT, Entitled, An ACT for
Binding and Ordering poor Apprentices.
WHereas an Act of this Island, Entitled, An Act for binding and ordering poor
Apprentices, dated the Third Day of October, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Eighty
and Eight, has of late been much controverted, and some Question and Scruple
moved thereon, whether any Person being within the Age of One and Twenty Years,
and bound to serve as an Apprentice, can be obliged by Indenture for a longer
Term or time than until such Apprentice arrive to the Age of Twenty One Years,
which Disputes and Differences of Opinions often happening between the
Magistrates of this Island by the absence of their Apprentices, and the
vexatious Suits they have brought against them by their Apprentices for their
Freedom, which if not timely provided for, may prove of great detriment to the
prosperity of this Place.

Be it Enacted by the President, Council and General Assembly of this Island,
Apprentices though under Age of 21, yet bound to serve the time mentioned in
their Indentures.
and by the Authority of the same, That all and every such Person or Persons
already bound, or at any time or times from henceforth shall be bound by
Indenture to serve as an Apprentice in any Art, Science or Occupation,
according to the Tenor of the before recited Act, and in manner and form as in
and by the said Act is prescribed, albeit the same Apprentice or any of them
shall be within the Age of One and Twenty Years at the time of the making their
several Indentures, shall be bound to serve for the Years in their several
Indentures contained as amply and largely to every Intent, as if the said
Apprentice were of full Age at the time of the making such Indentures, any Law,
Usage or Custom to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided always, Proviso.
And be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, To serve but Seven Years.
That all Persons within the Age of One and Twenty Years, to be bound
Apprentices as aforesaid, shall not by Indenture be obliged for a longer time
than Seven Years, unless such Person or Persons be so young at the time when
they are bound Apprentices that they want a greater number of Years to arrive
to the Age of One and Twenty Years.

And whereas by the before recited Act, it is provided, that if any Apprentice
shall neglect, absent or refuse to serve his or her Master or Mistress,
according to his or her Contract or Agreement, that then and in such Case, the
Two next Justices of the Peace are authorized to order Punishment to be
inflicted by Whipping or Imprisoning such disorderly Apprentice as in and by
the said Act (reference thereto being had) will more at large appear; which
Method (Experience has made manifest, does in no measure relieve the Masters
or Mistresses, or work any Reformation in such unruly Apprentices.

Be it therefore further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every
Apprentice or Apprentices already Bound, An Apprentice absenting himself
without leave, a Justice to order Service after the Expiration of his Indenture.
or to be Bound in manner as aforesaid, that shall presume after Publication of
this Act, to absent himself or her self from his or her Master or Mistress's
Service without leave first obtained from his or her Master or Mistress, or to
be warranted for his or their so doing, by the Two next Justices of the Peace,
every such Apprentice so absenting him or herself without such License as
aforesaid, upon Conviction thereof, by the Oath of One or more Witnesses, or
his or her own Confession, before the next Justice of the Peace, shall for
every Hours Absence be adjudged and ordered by the said Justice to serve his or
her said Master or Mistress, the like space of time after his or her time of
Apprentiship by Indenture is expired, or be proceeded against, as in and by the
afore-recited Act is appointed at the Election of his or her Master or Mistress
complaining, any thing in this Act seeming to the contrary notwithstanding.

And to the end that Apprentices may receive no manner of Encouragement
whatsoever to neglect their Duty, and that such Persons who have heretofore
given countenance, concealed or entertained Apprentices that have absented
themselves from their Masters or Mistresses Service, may be deterred from the
evil of such unjust Practices for the future,

Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person or
Persons whatsoever, The Penalty against Entertainers.
shall wittingly or willingly entertain any Apprentice for the space of Twelve
Hours, or otherwise countenance his or her Absence from their Masters or
Mistresses Service, upon Complaint and Conviction thereof, by One or more
Witnesses before the next Justice of the Peace, or the Party's own Confession,
the said Justice is hereby authorized to proceed against such Entertainer or
Concealer of Apprentices convicted as aforesaid, and to adjudge them in the
like Penalties, and in the same manner as is appointed for Proceedings against
the Entertainers of Servants, by an Act dated the Twenty Seventh of September,
One Thousand, Six Hundred, Sixty and One, Entitled, An Act for the good
government of Servants, and ordering the Rights between Masters and Servants.

well as Enormous Crimes, and illegal and undue Proceedings, to the prejudice of
Justice, and the laying open a Gap for Bribery. For Prevention whereof,

WHereas heretofore many Deceits and Frauds have been used and practiced in the
Payment of the Duty of Powder, which tends very much to the Prejudice and great
Hazard of the Loss of this Island, if not timely prevented.

To the intent therefore that Merchants, Owners and Masters of Vessels for the
future may know their respective Duties on their Arrival, and what Impost of
Powder shall henceforward be required of them, and in what manner and to whom

Goods on Shore (Horses or other Living Creatures excepted) upon Penalty and
Forfeiture of One Hundred Pounds Sterling, to be forthwith paid by the said

and for a Two Deck Ship (which carries Goods between Decks) the Depth of her
Hold to be taken from the Plank below the Kelsey, to the under part of the
Upper Deck Plank, and the length and depth as before; then multiply the length
by the breadth, and the Product thereof by the depth, and divide the whole by
Ninety Four, and the Quotient will give the true Contents of the Tunnage,
according to which Method and Rule all Vessels shall be measured, and the Duty
computed and paid accordingly, any Custom, Usage or Practice to the contrary
notwithstanding.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Keeper of the
Stores of the Magazine for the time being, A Register of all Entries to be kept

case whatsoever, to receive, take or demand any Reward, Fee or Fees, by virtue
of his said Office other than what in this Act is appointed. And at all times
when required by the Committee of Public Accounts, the said Keeper of the
Stores of the Magazine shall bring before the said Committee the said Book or
Books, wherein shall be fairly written the Names of such Master or other Person
who has so Entered or Reported; with the Names of such their Ships or Vessels,
their Tunnage or Burden, and faithfully account for all Powder, Arms or other
Stores that shall be delivered, or come into his Care and Possession by virtue
of his Office, for the use or account of the Public: And if the said Keeper of
the Stores of the Magazine shall have reason to suspect any Master or Commander
who has made a short Entry of his Ship or Vessel, Then and in such case, the
said Keeper of the Stores shall himself, or employ a Sworn Surveyor as a Gager,
immediately to repair on Board such Vessel or Vessels by him so suspected, to
take the true Burden of such Vessel, according to his best Judgment, and
thereof shall make report upon Oath before the Governor and President, or
Commander in Chief for the time being, in Presence of the Master, Commander or
other Person that made Entry of the said Ship or Vessel; upon which said

depends on the care and fidelity of such Person or Persons as shall for the

from the first settling of the Militia therein, unto this day, that all
Commissioners of the Trained Bands therein, have been of the Inhabitants
thereof; and such who have been Persons of such Honorable Qualifications, and
visible Estates, that they have not been in the least Burdensome to the

sufficient part of the Militia as may be needful to guard any Bay or Bays of
this Island, if any Vessel or Vessels under the number appointed for an Alarm,
which is by this Act already provided, shall Land or attempt to Land in any of

for the prevention of an intestine Commotion or Insurrection, Proviso.

in what Division soever the Mansion House of any Person shall stand, in that

And forasmuch as many Persons by this Act appointed to bear Arms, are not Men

such Omission shall be made, to the use of the Poor of that Parish. And
forasmuch as great Complaints have been made of the Marshals of the respective
Regiments, for taking greater Fines, and Distraining for above Twice the Value
of the Fines by this Act imposed for Defaults than is allowed hereby, For
Restraint and Prevention of such Inconveniences for the future,

It is hereby Provided and Enacted, That if any of the Marshals aforesaid,
shall in the Distraining for any Fine whatsoever as aforesaid, commit or do any
Injury unto the Person upon whose Goods he so Distrained beyond the Power and
Duty by this Act to him given and appointed, and shall not leave a Certificate

remain for the space of One Month, and be Fined Five Pound Sterling to His
Majesty, to be paid to the Treasurer of this Island, for the use of the
Fortifications: And it shall and may be lawful for such Persons so grieved as
aforesaid, to complain to the Colonel or Commander in chief of the said
Regiment, and if he gives no redress, then the Person grieved, if he think fit,
may commence his Action at the Common Law, against the Marshal, whose Complaint
being made out to be just and true, the Jury shall give Treble Damages to the
Plaintiff, and the Court double Cost, the said Action to be tried the first
Court after Service thereof: Proviso.
Provided always, the said grieved Person commenceth his Action within Six
Months after such Injury done him as aforesaid: Provided also, Proviso.

where such Action is commenced, shall tax double Cost against the Plaintiff for
his unjust Vexation.

order any to be so fired within his House or Plantation, shall for every such
Offense forfeit (except it be in his own Defense, or Preservation of his Goods,
or in case of an Alarm) Two Shillings and Six Pence. But if it shall so
happen, that the Person be insolvent, Servant or Negro, then and in such case
it shall and may be lawful, to and for the next Justice of the Peace, to bind
the Offender to the Quarter Sessions if a Christian, or order him if a Slave,
such Corporal Punishment as he thinks the Offense deserves.

And forasmuch as many Disorders are committed by Petrols, by reason that the
Command of them is given often to loose and inconsiderable Persons, occasioned
chiefly by refusal of such Command, by the more able and sober Persons. For
Remedy whereof,

Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That whatsoever Person (except as
before excepted) shall from and after Publication of this Act, Neglect of
Service on Petrols, to forfeit Twenty Shillings.
refuse or neglect such Command, being thereunto required by the Captain or
Commander in chief of each respective Troop, shall for every such Offense,
forfeit Twenty Shillings, to be levied by the Marshal of the said Regiment; and
the Commander of such Petrol, is hereby empowered and required to make Returns
of such Defaulters for Nonappearance, to one of the Commission Officers of the
Troops and Companies to which such Petrols belong, that by the said Officer the
said Returns may be made to the Colonel, that Execution may issue against the
Delinquents in manner and form as for other Defaults for Nonappearance is in
and by this Act prescribed and appointed.

And be it further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That if any
Officer or any other Person qualified by this Act to make Returns, shall
contrary to the true intent and meaning of this Act, Persons suffering by false
Returns, to have their Actions at Common Law.
make any false or undue Returns wittingly and willingly, so that such
Execution be levied, the Party so aggrieved, shall have his Action at Common
Law in the Court of the Precincts where such Officer that has made such false
Returns, does live or reside, which Action shall be entered in Thirty Days after
such Execution levied, and shall be tried the first Court after such Entry made
by a Jury; and if the said Officer shall be found guilty by the Jury of having
made such false Returns, then the said Jury for his making such a false Return,
shall find him in Damages Five Pounds Sterling; and the Court shall award to
the Plaintiff, Three Pounds Sterling in Cost, and no more. But if the Plaintiff
does not make good his Action, so that the Returns appear to be legally made,
then the Court shall tax treble Cost for the Officer or Person who made such
Returns for his unjust Vexation; any thing in this Act to the contrary
notwithstanding.

And for that the Marshal upon an Execution Signed against any Person by the
Colonel or Commander in chief of the Regiment shall not be hindered from
executing the said Execution against, or upon any Person so returned for the
Defaults in the Militia, as by this Act appointed, and for that likewise the
Party grieved may not have his Goods carried and driven away by the said
Marshal,

It is therefore Enacted and Ordained, That the Party whose Goods are so
Attached, Goods levied on, to be in the Delinquents ^ Custody, Bon^ being given.
shall apply himself in Ten Days after such Execution levied to the Colonel or
Commander in chief of the Regiment to which he belongs, who is hereby empowered
and required to order the Goods so Attached from the Party, to remain in the
Delinquent's own Possession; and the said Marshal is hereby required to yield
all due Obedience to the same, and the said Delinquent at the same time, shall
give a Bond to the said Marshal in double the Value of such Execution or
Executions so levied, that he will bring the aforesaid Action within one Month
at furthest after such Complaint; and that if the Action so brought, or being
brought, shall not be found for the Plaintiff, so that the return of the
Officer is adjudged lawful, then the Complainant shall in Five Days return the
Goods so Attached to the Marshal, or pay the Value they shall be Appraised at;
which if not complied with, then the said Marshal shall recover the whole
Penalty in the said Bond, against such Complainant as aforesaid, by Action at
the Common Law without Appeal, and the Court is hereby empowered to Tax common
Cost.

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Acts or
Statutes heretofore made, All former Acts of the Militia Repealed.
for or concerning the Militia of this Island, be and are hereby declared to be
absolutely Void, Null and Repealed, to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever; any
Law to the contrary notwithstanding.

imprisoned upon suspicion of Crimes, which cannot be done, unless there be a
more frequent calling and holding of Courts of General Sessions, or Oyer and
Terminer, and General Goal delivery than has of late been practiced in this

Records, in order to the better Discovery and Redressing such Grievances, and
for the better enquiry into the Breach of His Majesty's good and wholesome Laws
of this Island, without which, they could by no means attain to such good Ends
for which it shall please His Majesty to call them, which would very much tend
to His Majesty's Dishonor and Disservice, and very much to the Detriment of
His Majesty's Subjects of this His Island of Barbados, who are very far distant
from His Most Sacred Person, and thereby want many of the happy Circumstances
of His Subjects in England, who live more immediately under the Influences of
his good and happy Government. To the Intent therefore to put an end to all
these Doubts which have been principally moved by such Offenders, who would
thereby avoid the just Punishment due to their Crimes, and the better to quiet
the Minds of His Majesty's good and faithful Subjects of this Island, and that
the General Assembly may better answer the good and wholesome Ends for which it
shall please His Majesty from time to time to call them.

Disobedience, and also to punish any Affronts or Misbehaviours offered against
