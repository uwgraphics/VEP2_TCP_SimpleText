An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons in Parliament.
WHereas the Lords and Commons now assembled in Parliament do find by
continual experience, That very great quantities of Ordnance, Arms, and other
warlike Ammunition, And many Commanders and Soldiers have been brought into
Newcastle, and other parts of this Kingdom from foreign parts, and especially
from the Low Countries (notwithstanding the prohibition given by the States of
the united Provinces to that effect) to be employed against the Parliament, and
their adherents, the well-affected persons of this Realm.

And whereas diverse of His Majesty's well affected Subjects out of their loyal
respect to His Majesty, their pious disposition to the peace and happiness of
this Kingdom, and as much as in them lies to prevent and hinder all such
supplies as shall be sent from any foreign parts, to the prejudice of this
Nation, Have lately made known to the said Lords and Commons their voluntary
disposition and readiness to set forth some Ships and Pinaces, warlikely
appointed, equipped, manned and victualled, at their own proper costs and
charges, So that in recompense of their charge and adventure therein, they may
have and enjoy to their own uses all such Ships, Munition, Goods, Moneys, and
Merchandises which they shall take and surprise by Sea or by Land, intended or
designed against the Parliament and their adherents the well affected persons
of this Kingdom, as aforesaid, or that have carried, or they shall take
carrying, any the said supplies to the intents aforesaid, Which being well
approved by the Lords and Commons in Parliament as a good and acceptable
service, they do commend the same for a pious and laudable undertaking, and
are will1ing to give it all the encouragement and advancement that may be, to
bring it to a good and successful issue, as tending very much to the honor
of the King and the welfare of this Nation; And therefore for the better
enabling the performance of this so free and commendable undertaking and
enterprise, It is ordered, established and ordained by the Lords and Commons
assembled in this present Parliament, and by the authority of the same, That it
shall and may be lawful1 for any of his Majesty's good and loyal Subjects of
this Kingdom of England (to be approved and thereto appointed by the
Commissioners of the Admiralty established by the Parliament) in warlike manner
to equippe and furnish for the said intended employment such and so many Ships
and other Vessels as they shall think fitting, and to place in them competent
numbers of Soldiers, Mariners and Gunners, with necessary Arms and
Provisions for that service, and to appoint over them such Commanders,
Captains and Officers as they shall think fit; and the same Ships and Vessels
so manned, equipped, Armed and provided to set forth to the Sea, and with the
same to seize, surprise, and take all and all manner of Ships and Vessels with
the Ordnance Ammunition, Goods, Commanders and Soldiers therein that they
shall find or understand are sent or are come to any parts of this Kingdom to
the prejudice thereof, as aforesaid; and further to surprise and take all and

goods whatsoever; And for the better encouragement of all such Adventurers in
the said interprize. It is by the Lords and Commons likewise Ordered and
ordained, That the said Adventurers shall have and enjoy as their proper goods,
all Ships, Goods, Moneys, Plate, Arms, Ammunition, Victuals, Pillage and
Spoil which shall be seized, or taken by any persons by them to be employed by
force and virtue of this Ordinance, which by definitive sentence to be given in
His Majesty's high Court of his Admiralty shall be pronounced at the time of
the taking or seizing thereof, to have been sent, designed, or intended to
come into this Kingdom against the Parliament, and all well affected persons
their adherents in this Nation, or to have belonged to any Pirates or
Sea-Rovers what soever: and the same to have and enjoy to their own use,
without any account whatsoever thereof to be made, Only reserving the tenths
accustomed in such cases to be paid to the Admiral. And it is further Ordered
and Ordained, That there shall be true and faithful inventories taken of the
Ships, Ammunition, Moneys, Goods, Plate, Pillage and spoil which shall be
taken by virtue and authority of this present Ordinance, and a true
appraisement made of the same, and the same together with all papers and
writeings found in any Ship, or other Vessel by them to be taken shall be
carefully preserved, and two or three of the Officers of every Ship or other
Vessel, so taken, shall be examined before the chief Officer of the next safe
port of England, and the said examinations with the said papers, inventories,

possible, and with all force compel them to yield, and submit themselves to
reason and Justice, although it do fall out that by fighting with them one or
more of them be maimed, hurt, or slain in the resistance. And it is further
ordered and ordained, That the Owners, Captain, Master and two or three other
