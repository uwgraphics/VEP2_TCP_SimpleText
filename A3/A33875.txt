PREFACE. To the Merchants and Traders of the City of London.
Gentlemen,
ALthough the publishing of the ensuing Pamphlet (or Catalogue) may at the
first view, seem to several persons a ridiculous and preposterous attempt, yet
the Author of this poor Collection humbly hopes, that it will not be exploded
or rejected by you, for whose ease and convenience (together with your foreign
correspondents) he principally intended it: And if it prove so successful, as
to receive a favorable acceptance from your hands, the censure of all other
persons not concerned in the convenience arising by it, will not discourage the
Author to proceed and make such Improvements of this small Embrio, as may soon
bring it to a perfect birth. He humbly hopes no Apology will be required for
such Errata's or Escapes as have been committed as to the Orthography, or true
writing of the respective Names of this Catalogue, as well for that he has
found it a very difficult thing, to procure so ample an Account of Names as he
has done; as also in regard his main design is, to publish this forthwith, to
the end that if those persons that are concerned in the Use of it, do give it a
favorable Receptance, he may set forth an Additional Catalogue far more
correct and accurate; wherein if he may receive Encouragement accordingly, he
shall not in any thing be better satisfied than that his poor Endeavors shall
have answered those Ends for which they were intended.

Advertisement.
WHereas, since the ensuing Tract was in the Press, the Author has discovered
the Habitations of several other Merchants, not comprehended in the
Alphabetical Order; he has therefore thought fit (rather than to omit them) to
insert them in the last Page of this Book by themselves. And whereas the Author
intends shortly to Reprint this Catalogue, with Additions; he does therefore
desire, that for the better furtherance of the next Edition, all Merchants, as
well such as shall be newly arrived from beyond the Seas, as also all such as
shall be newly set up, would be pleased to give in their Names and Habitations
to Samuel Lee Stationer, over against the Church, near Pope's Head Alley in
Lombard Street. And if it happen that any Omission shall be made of any
Merchants Names in this or the ensuing Edition, let the Parties concerned
repair to the said Mr. Lee, where they may probably receive satisfaction. And
if any Bill of Exchange happen to be drawn upon any Tradesmen or Shopkeepers
under the denomination of Merchants, if they repair to the place aforesaid they
may receive due Information.
