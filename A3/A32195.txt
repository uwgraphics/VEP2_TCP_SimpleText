THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY TO THE RIGHT VVORSP.LL SR ANDREW RICCARD GOVERNOR,
THE DEPVTIE, and ASSISTANTS OF THE COMPANY OF MERCHANTS TRADING IN THE LEVANT
SEAS.
RIGHT VVORSP.LL SR and SRS
Having been often solicited by the Consuls of the several Factories in
Tur^y, and by other private merchants my esteemed friends, for true coppies of
the Capitulations, we have with the Grand Sig. as they were last renewed,
and enlarged with aduantagious additions, and privileges by his Excellency
the Earl of vvinchilsea Our present Lord Ambassador; I apprehended that
printing some coppies thereof, would excuse me from a greater pains, then
transcribing so many would be, as might satisfy my friends, and would serve
for a good light, and information to every member concerned in the Leuant
trade, of the true extent of the articles we hold with the Turkish Empire,
that so they may neither omit to take those advantages in their trade, which
Our Capitulations allow, nor ignorantly confiding to what was never granted,
and agreed, run into those errors, which your com^on purse has so often
been forced to rectify, and repair.

These Capitulations, or articles of peace first opened our traffic with the
Turks in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, about 80 years past, and since have
been explained, and enlarged in the time of almost every Ambassador with
such alterations, as the state of affairs, and the abuses, and iniquity of
the times suggested: And yet all the uigilance, and caution of the many wise,
and resolute Ministers, that have acted in his Embasse, could never (nor never
will) be able to provide those prudent remedies, that may be proof, and a
guard impregnable against the pretenses, and uiolence o^ the Turkish avarice.
The present ^mbassadour, my most esteemed Lord (whom I have the honor to
serve as Secretary of his ovv^^, and the af^aires of your Right Worshipful
society) has contributed an affectuall addition to this work, which by
a^uice, and information from all the Factories in Turkey of their respective
agreiuances, is as amply confirmed, as the hand, and authority of the
Emperor, and law of nations can establish: to which proposalls tendered by
the merc^ants, the war then hot with Algier, occasioned his Excellency to
insert other cautions, against the pyracies of Barbary, when at Adrianople
he encountered the messengers, that broug^^ complaints of the assault his
Maies^ies Fleet against the Capi^^latio^^, and Articles of peace had made upon
the Grand Signors to vv^e of Algier, to which allegations, his ^xcellencie
made those prudent rep^ies, that neither the privilege of their Sect, nor
their late presents, nor relation as subjects, could prevail to afford them
matter of favor, or counten^nce: And at how easy, and cheap a rate your
threa^ned es^ates were then protected, the accounts sen^ you home will
justify: and the inconsiderable Auances that have happened since his arrival,
are a testimony of the great vvisdome, and care of his Excellency; That if it
please God, to con inue the same success to him, in the remainde^ of his time,
bles^ed with the present flo^rishing estate of your trade, his return may be
celebrated wi^h the same, and glory of the most happy, and fortunate of
Ambassadors.

These Capitulations being thus completed, to which nothing can at present,
be thought or, to make more, perfect, ^or no oppress^on imaginable, which
^eet^ not a prohibition herein, until the ma^itious invention of the Turks
(which is ingenious in nothing but in matters of their intere^^) espy some
unarmed part, in which to vv^^rd Us: It is the vvi^dome, ^igilance, and reso
u^ion of the Embas adour to maintain them in reverence, and observation: in
which that course, and method is to be taken, as is not practiced in the
Courts of Christendom, and is of that different form, in matte^ and
proceeding, as will render an experienced Minister in the treaties of other
countries a Nouice in this, until ti^e and conuersa^ion has instructed him in
a new science and unacq^inted Maxims of State, and policy.

The Capitulations the Grand Sig.r gives to us, and other Christians tha^ t^^ff
ck with ^im, are (in my opinion) of an other nature and form, then articles
of peace are usual to be betvveene two nations; for he requires no
counterpart from his Majesty, whereby to oblige him to perform the ^ame
conditions with himself, but as if he needed, and expected nothing from the
English conferres on them several Imperial im^unities, and privileges, as
his Charter, and Acts of grace, without demand of any returns which he
accounts as a diminution to his all containing Majesty to be needful, or
vvanting of. And this p^ide, is ^o natural to the Turks, and so necessary to
be flattered by those, who would maintain the intercourse of peace, and
traffic wi h them, that it is no mean Art to know vv^ll, how to nourish,
and d^lly wi^h their barbarous humor. But it is beyond, I must confess, my
capacity, to be more, then superficially acquainted with these mysteries, it
is for my Lord, to be Master, and profoundly uersed in them; who knovves the
times, both to threaten, and to flatter, and when with resolute words, or
soft speeches to dispearse, and calm those storms, which we who live,
under the arbitrary will of Tyrants, do often foresee, and yet dissolve,
before the fury reach, and arrive you. This is the care, and study of his
Excellency, who has many times occasion to be more tender of your safety,
then his own, and to interpose himself, and his, betvveene you, and the
barbarous rage. And when I, who am one of the meanest of those concerned in
your interest, ^an be of service, and ^se to the public benefit of the Right
worshipful society, I shall think my life too mean a sacrifice to o^fer to
you; for having received so many obligations from your worships and
testimonies of your bounty, I judge my self for ever bound to subscribe my
self.

THE PRINTER TO THE READER.
COURTEOUS READER
If in perusing these follovving Capitulations you find some fevv letters
misplaced, or the letter VV not so neatly formed, as were to be wished,
attribute the fault neither to the Printer, nor Correctour: for the press at
Constantinople being but sildome employed, is not furnished with the uarietie
of those letters, which are only propper to northern languages, amongst which
the VV is of special use; to supply which defect, I have been forced to
imitate that letter as well as I could beyond my own art, and profession.
And if any other letters are let slip, it was in time of the Correctours
urgent auocation to other employments which permitted him not to be so
accurate, and attentive hereunto as he desired. And so hoping you will
pardon, what slight errors you may possibly meet with herein I remain.

XXXIII
There having been in times past a di ference betvv^ene the Ambassador of the
Queen of England and the ^re^ch Ambassador both Resident in our Port about
the merch^nts of the Dutch nation both which Ambassadors sent their petitions
to our Imperial stirrup: And made request, that the said Dutch me^chants
coming into our dominions should p^^se un^er their banner; which request of
both Embassa^ours vv^s granted under our Imperial Seal; not vvith^tan^ing
Si^^n B^^l^ the Son of Cigala Captain of the Sea, now ^e^^^sed, as Admiral
and practiced in marittime cases, having a^uise^ the Imperial ^^iestie that it
was fit, and convenient, that the Dutch nation s^o^ld be assigned to the
protection of the Amb^ssa^our of E^gla^d, and that it should be so written in
their Capitulations which opinion b^i^g by all the Viziers ^pproued; by
express or^er, and Imperial aut^oritie it vv^s co^^anded that the D^^ch
merch^nts of the Provinces of Holland, Zeland, Freezelan^, and Geld^rl^^d,
Tha^is, the merchan^s of those 4 Provinces trading in our dominions, shall
always come under the b^nner of the Queen of England as all other Eng^i^h
do, and that of all the goods, and merchandise which they shall, or do
import or export, to and from our dominion, in their Vessels, they shall pay
the duties of Consulage, and all other du^ies to the Ambassador o^ Consul of
the Queen of England; And that never hereafter the french Ambassador or
Co^sul shall insinuate, nor intermedle herein, and ac^ordingly It vv^s
com^anded; that for the time to come, it should be ruled and observed
according to this present Capitulation,

After which there being arrived an other Ambassador at this HighPort sent
from the king of ^ngland with letters, and presents, which vve^e most
acceptable, the said Ambass^dour did make reque^t that certain other
necessary articles should be added, and written in the Imperial
Capitulations; of which the first vv^s; As in times past, in the days of one
of our forefathers of famous memory Sultan Soliman Han, there was gran^ed a
ce^taine Capitulation, and privilege, that the m^^chants of the spanish nation
Portugal, Ancona, Ciuilla, Florence, Cat^l^^nia, and all sorts of Dutchmen,
and other merchant strangers, might safely, and securely go, and come through
all the places of our dominions, and trade, and tra^fick, granting unto them
Moreover, that in any part of our Empire they might e^ta^lish their Co^suls;
But it being that eu^ry nation apart vv^s not able to d^fray the ^harges, and
m^i^tenance of a Co^sul; It vv^s then left to their will, and ch^ice to ^ome
un^er the banner of such A^^a^sa^our or Consul as (...) like ^^e^ Provided that
it vv^re an Ambassa^o^r, or Co^^^l of a King in peace, and amity with our
High Fort upon which Grant, and other privileges given them, there were
often granted diverse Imperial com^ands, and constitutions, being so desired
by merchant strangers, who of their own will elected to trade under the
banner, and protection of the Ambassador, and Consul of the King of England.
And vvhilest in all Scales, and Ports in these parts they had refuge to the
banner, and protection of the English Consuls It seems, that the French
Ambassador by some means having a new gotten into their Capitulations, that
the said merchant strangers should come under their banner, did endeavor to
force them in all Scales to their protection; for which cause the controversy
was again renewed and referred to our Diuan, or Great Council which after
a due examination and a new election permited to the will, and choice of the
said merchants, they again did desire to be under the protection of the
Ambassador of the King of England, notvvithstanding it being made known to
the Imperial Port that as yet the french Ambassador did not desire to molest
the said merchants, nor to force them under his protection, the first Article
written in the french Capitulations, that the merchants strangers should come
under their protection, was by the Imperial com^and made Void and annulled;
And to the end that according to the ancient custom of the said merchant
strangers they should always come under the banner, and protection of the
Ambassador, or Consuls of England; and that never, hereafter they should be
uexed, or troubled by the french Ambassador in this point The said
Ambassadors of his Majesty of England having desired that this particular
should be written, and enrouled in this new Imperial Capitulationj this
present article was accordingly inserted, and by the Imperial authority It
is com^anded, That for ever in time to come, merchants of the said Princes, in
the mentioned form, and according to this Imperial com^and in their hand,
shall always be under the banner, and protection of the Ambassador, and
Consuls of England.

XXXIIII
There shall never be permitted, or granted any Imperial com^ands, contrary
to the tenor, and articles of this Imperial com^and, or Capitulations, nor in
prejudice of this our peace and amity, but in such occasion the cause shall
first be certifyed to the Ambassador of England residing at the Port, to the
end, that be may answer, and object any scandalous action or other pretense,
which might infringe the peace, and league.

XXXV
The English merchants of all the merchandise, which they shall bring, or
transport in their ships having paid the custom, they shall also pay the right
of Consulage to the English Ambassador, or Consul.

XXXVI
The Eng^ish merchants, and all under their banner, s^all and may safely
throughout our dominion, trade, buy, sell, (except only com^odities prohibited)
all sorts of merchandise; likewise either by land, or sea, they may go, and
traffic, or by the way of the river Tanais in Moscouia or by Ru^sia, and from
thence may bring their merchandise into our Empire, also to, and from Persia,
they may go, and trade, and through all that part newly by Us conquered, and
through those confine^, without the impediment, or molestation of any of our
ministers, and they shall pay the custom and other duties of that country, and
nothing more.

XXXVII
The English merchants, and all under their banner shall and may safely, and
freely trade, and negotiate in Aleppo, Cairo, Scio, Smirna and in all parts of
our dominions, and according to our ancient customs of all their merchandise,
they shall pay three in the hundred for custom, and nothing more.

XXXVIII
The English ships which shall come to this our city of Constantinople if by
fortune of seas, or ill vveather, they shall be forced to Co f^, or to such
like Port; as long as the English will not unla^e and tell their own
merchandise, and goods, no man shall enforce them, nor gi^e them any trouble,
or annoyance, but in all places of danger, the Caddees, or other of our
mini^ters, shall al^vvayes protect, and defend the said English ships, men, and
goods, that no damage may come unto them, and with their money may buy
uictualls, and other necessaries; and desiring also with their money to hire
carts, or uessells, which before were not hired by a^y other, to transport
their goods from place to place, no man shall do them any hinderance, or
trouble what soever.

XXXIX
The English Nation of all the merchandise which in their ships shall be
brought to Constantinople or to any other part of our dominions which they
shall not desire of their own accord to land, or sell, of such goods there
shall not be demanded; or taken any custom at arrival at any Port, and
having landed their ^erchandize, and paid their customs, and other duties,
they may quietly and safely depart with out the mole^tation of any man.

XXXX
In regard English ships coming into our dominions, do use often times to
touch in some part of Africa, and there take in Pilgrims, and Mohammedan
passengers to transport them to Alexandria, and arriving at that Port, It
seems that the Customers, and other officers, do pretend to take custom of
all goo^s, which are found in t^eir ships before the merchants are vvillin^ to
la^d any; by occasion of which molestation they have forbo^^^e to transport
any pilgrims. And in like manner, their ships which come to Constantinople and
carry diverse merchandise, to transport part thereof to other places, the
customers, and Farmours would enforce to land, and pretend to take custom
thereof. Wherefore we do com^and, that all the English ships which with
their merchandise shall come into this Port of Constantinople, Alexand^ia,
Tripoli of Suria, Scanderoone, or into any ^ort whatsoever of our Empire
according to use, they shall pay only custom of such goods, which with their
own will they shall design to sell, and such other merchandise, as they
discharge not from their ships willingly our customer shall not demand, nor
take custom, nor other duties, but they may transport them whether soever
they please.

XXXXI
And if it shall happen, That any of the said English Nation, or any under
their banner shall com^it man slaughter, bloodshed, or any other like offense;
or that there shall happen any cause appertaining to the law, or Justice,
until the Ambassador or Consul shall be present, to examine the cause, the
Judges, nor other ministers, shall not decide nor give any sentence, but such
controversy shall always be declared in the presence of the Ambassador,
or Consul to the end, that no man be Judged, or condemned contrary to the
law, and the capitulations.

XXXXII
Whereas it is written, in the Imperial Capitulations, that the goods landed
out of any English ship, which shall come into our dominions, and pay custom
ought also to pay the duty of Consulage, to the English Ambassador, or
Consul. it seems That diverse Mabometan merchants, Sciots, and other
merchants in peace, and amity with this Imperial Port, and other merchant
strangers do deny, and refuse to pay the right of consulage. Wherefore, It is
com^anded, that all the merchandise which shall be laden upon their ships,
and have paid custom be they goods of vvhomsoeuer, according to ancient
Imperial Capitulations, they shall pay the right of Consulage to the
Ambassador or Consul of England without any contradiction.

XXXXIII
That English merchants which trade at Aleppo, and those under their banner of
all the silk which they shall buy, and lade upon their ships, shall pay the
custom, and other duties, as the french, and Venetian merchants do pay, and
not one asper, or farthing more.

XXXXIIII
As the Ambassadors of the King of England which shall be Resident in this
Imperial Court are the Representatiues, and Comissioners of the person of his
Majesty so the Interpreters are to be esteemed the Com^issioners of the
Ambassador, Therefore for such matter as the Interpreters shall translate or
speak in the name, or by the order of the Ambassador; it being found that
that which they have translated, to be according to the will, and order of
the Ambassador, or Consul, they shall be always free, from any imputation,
or punishment. And in case they shall com^it any offense, our ministers shall
not put any of the said Interpreters in prison, nor beat them without
knowledge of the Ambassador, or Consul; in case any of the English
Interpreters shall die, if he be an Englishman, all his goods, or faculties
shall be possessed by the Ambassador, or Consul of England, but if be shall
be a subject of our dominion, they shall be consigned to his next heir, and
having no heir, they shall be taken into our Exchequor. And as in this
particular so also in all other the above mentioned articles, and privileges
granted by our forefathers of happy memory, It is expressly com^anded and
Ordained, That all our slaves shall ever obey, and observe this Imperial
Capitulation and that the peace, and amity shall be respected and maintained,
without any uiolation whatsoever.

XXXXV
Since which time of our fore fathers of famous memory, and the gran^ of
these above mentioned Capitulations, articles, and establishment of peace, and
amity, the said King of England having in the time of our grand father of
happy memory Sultan Mahomet Han sent one, his well desired Ambassador a
person of quality to this high Port, to confirm this peace, articles and
Capitulations which Ambassador did declare, that often times there were to
diverse persons Imperial com^ands granted, subreptitiously procured contrary
to the tenor, and articles of the Imperial capitulations; which being
without our knowledge presented to our Judges, and Governors, and the da^es
of such com^ands being more fresh then those of our Imperial Capitulaions: the
Judges, and ministers do put in execution the private com^ands preiuditial and
contrary to these Imperial. To the end therefore, that for the time to come,
such commands shall not be accepted of any, but that the imperial
Capitulations might be always observed, and maintained, according to the
sincere meaning; the said Ambassador demonstrating the sincerity of his
Majesty and his request herein to our Imperial knowledge, which was most
acceptable; in conformity thereuto it was expressly ordered; That all such
com^ands which already have been, or shall hereafter be granted, which
are, or shall be repugnant to the tenor of this Imperial Capitulation,
whatsoever such commands shall be vv^en presented before our Caddees, or
other ministers, should never be accepted, or put into execution, but that
always the tenor of the Imperial Capitulations shall be observed; And
whosoever shall present such com^and contrary to the Capitulations, they shall
be taken from him, and in no wise be of any force, or ualiditie. In which
time also on the part of our said Grand father all the above written
Privileges, Articles, and Capitulations, were accepted, and ratifyed, and the
peace, amity, and good correspondence anciently contracted was a new of him
confirmed and established.

XXXXVI
In the time of the inauguration of Sultan OSMAN Han in the Imperial, and high
throne, the King of England did again send a famous, and noble Geentleman, his
Ambassador, with letters, and presents which were most acceptable. And the
said Ambassador desiring in the name of his King, and Lord, that the ancient
Capitulation, articles, and contracts granted in the days of our forefathers
should be of him renewed, and confirmed, and the ancient peace, and amity,
anew fortifyed, and established, which his request was to the said Sultan
Osman most acceptable. And the ancient Capitulations, articles, Privileges,
herein written, and confirmed, and the long since contracted peace, and amity
by him promised, and accepted.

XXXXVII
After whom in like manner, in the days of Sultan OSMAN Han the King of
England having again sent unto this high Port his Ambassador the Excellent,
and honnourable, sr THOMAS Roe Knight with his letters, and presents, which
were most aceptable; and proffering in the name of the King his Lord, all good
terms of friend ship, and good correspondence? And desiring that the ancient
Capitulations, and all the articles from his Ancestors, and from himself
formerly granted to the English nation might be anew confirmed, and the
peace, and league long since betvveene both parties contracted, and ratifyed;
and that some other articles uery necessary might be added to the Imperial
Capitulations, and diverse others already granted might be renewed, amended,
and in a better form explained, which his request and demand was uery
acceptable unto him; and in conformity thereunto, the ancient Imperial
Capitulations, and all the articles, and other privileges in them often
confirmed, and the peace, amity, and good corrspondence contracted, in the
times of his Ancesters, Grand father, and father, and himself confirmed, were
again by Sultan OSMAN then ratifyed, established, promised, and accepted,
vvhereupon by him there was express com^and given, that for the time to come,
the ^enour of his renewed Capitulations should be of every one observed, and
that all men should be careful, and respectfull to the^ said peace, and
friend ship established, and contracted on both parts, and that no man should
presume to uiolate, or to do any act contrary thereunto which Emabssadour did
often declare that the Caddees, and other of our ministers, in many places, and
provinces, contrary to the Imperial Capitulations and will of the Imperial
Majesty have imposed, and laid diverse taxes, burdens, and moneys upon the
said English Nation, and those under their banner, for which cause as it is
above declared, it being found necessary to make additions of some new
articles in the said Imperial Capitulation, of which the said Ambassador
made declaration in vvriting, and presented the same to the Imperial presence;
The said Sultan OSMAN Han with his Imperial hand, and seal did presently
give express order, and com^and, that in the time to come, all those articles,
and privileges which were already in the Imperial Capitulations, and those
articles which now are there in by our order newly added shall be of all
our subjects, and slaves duly obeyed, and observed according to the sincere
meaning of this our Imperial Capitulations.

XXXXVIII
In as much as it is publicly known, That certain pirates of Tunis, and
Algier, contrary to our Imperial Capitulations, mind, and will, do take, and
rob in the seas, the ships merchandise and men, subjects to his Majesty of
England, and of other Kings, and states in league with this our Imperial
Port, to the great Damage, and injury of the said English Nation, we do
com^and and by the^e presents we do ordain, that several Imperial
commands be given, for the entire restitution of all goods, and merchandise to
the English Nation so taken away, And that all such English as have been
taken, and made slaves, or imprisoned by the said pirates shall be im^ediately
set free. And after the date of this our Imperial Capitulations; If it shall
be known, that the said Pirates, of Tunis, and Algier, shall rob them
again, and shall use, and continue their outrages, and will not restore their
goods, and men, we do com^and that the said pirates, be not received into
any Port of our dominions, especially into the Scales of Tunis, Algier, Modon,
or Coron. Our Beglerbegs, and other minsters, shall not suffer them to enter,
nor harbor, nor receive them, but the Beglerbeges, Caddees, or other ministers
shall persecute, banish, and punish them.

XXXXVIIII
Being informed that in our dominions many of our Customers, and other officers
in Aleppo contrary to the Imperial Capitulations under color of taking
custom, and rest upon silk of the English merchants, have uiolently taken
from the said merchants agreat sum of money. And whereas in the Imperial
Capitulations, it is written that for silk which the English shall buy in
Aleppo, they shall pay as the french, and Venetian merchants do, and no more;
Notvvithstanding the said customers, besides the two and half per cent for
custom and Rest have taken from that nation a great sum^ of money lately under
name of Rest wherefore we com^and that this bussinesse shall dee examined,
and that the said money be restored back, and for the time to come, the ancient
custom may dee kept; And that this nation shall only pay, as the French, and
Venetian do, and that never be taken one asper by name of such imposition.

L
Whereas the English merchants resident in Galata, ordenarily buy diverse
goods, and merchandise before they can la ie, or send them away upon their
ships, and do pay unto the customers, the custom of the said goods, receiving
a bill, or acquittance to have paid the same, and after carry the same
merchandise to their own vvare houses: In the mean time before they can
load, and ^end away the said goods; It happens, that either the customer dies,
or is removed from his charge and the new customers will not accept of the
said acquittances, but pretend an other custom troubling, and molesting of
them many vvayes. Wherefore we do com^and, that of all the merchandise
which they shall buy, it appearing really that be has paid once his custom,
the customer shall ^ccept of the said acquittances, and shall not demand of the
merchant a second custom.

LI
It being usual to buy in Angora, Chamblets, Mohaires, silks and other sorts
of merchandise which they transport to Constantinople, and other places of our
dominions, and pay their customs, taking acquittances for the same, and so put
the goods into their own vvare houses; And after being desirous to ship them
away, the customers do demand again the custom, There fore for the time to
come when the said merchants shall desire to lade such goods; and it be true
that they have already paid their custom of such merchandise, they shall not
demand any second or new customs Provided that the said merchants do not
mingle their goods, which have not paid custom with those which have
already paid custom.

LII
The English merchants of all the merchandise which they shall bring into our
dominions, and of the merchandise which they carry out of our dominions, as
silk, chamblets, and other goods, having paid the custom, and not sold the
goods unto an other; And being afterward to ship it away for Scio, Smyrna,
or any other Scale, and the said goods there ariuing, the customers, and
officers shall always accept of their aquittances, which they have in their
hands, and shall not take other custom of their merchandise.

LIII
The English merchants of all the com^odities which they shall bring to
constantinople or to any other Port of our dominions, and of all such as they
shall transport, the Mestaragi of Galata and Constantinople shall take their
Mestaria or Brokidge according to the ancient ca^^o, and ^^ance, that is of
such merchandise, as of old custom, was wont to pay it, or such they shall
only take Mes^aria, but of such merchandise as was not anciently accustomed to
pay it shall not be taken ^^^aria contrary to the ^ntient cannon. Farther
upon the Engli^h merchandise, there shall not be made, or laid any
impositions, or other causes, Nor from the said nation shall not be taken one
a^^^r, more, which shall be contrary to the ancient ca^no^, and accustomed
^sance.

LIIII
The English Nation shall, and may freely come in to all the Ports of our
do^inions to ^egoti^^^ and bring in clo^^, Kersie, sp^ce, tin, lead, and all
other merchandise, and no (...) shall do ^^m any ^i derance, or ^olestation,
In ^ke ^^^^er except only goods prohibited, they shall and may b^y, and ^^port
all so^^ of merchandise without the prohibition, or mo^e^tation of ^^y man;
and the customers, and other (...), the said nation ^^^ing pai^ their custom
according to this Imperial Capitulation, and ^he ancient use, shall not demand
o^ them any ^^ing more. In the time of the happy memory of my ^n^le ^^^an
(...) Han, the King of England sent his Em^^^^^dour Sir (...) uis^e ^^ovv
Baronet with his pr^sent and letter, vvh^^^ was ^^^eiued (...) ^ood part; and
the time of his Em^^^^e ^ei^g expi^ed, Sir Thomas Bendis^ arrived to resid^ at
the Port with hi^ present, and co^rteous letter, the which vv^^ in l^ke
manner vv^ll accepted and the said Ambassador having tend^red the Imperi^ll
Capi^ulation, formerly granted, that accordi g to the anti^nt Cannon they might
be renewed, It is ^er ^y again com^anded that all the points, and particular
Articles, therein be observed, and maintained.

LV
And because contrary to the sense, and tenure of them the ships of ^h^ ^nglish
mer^^^^^^s before they arr^^^ at the S^al^ ^enerall Officers did go upon them
and uiolently force out of ^^e ^^ips the goods of the m^rchants, taking away
the choi^e of them without (...); ^or the Price, or making any account with
the owners

LVI
And farthermore the said m^ chants having once paid the custom for their
goods at the (...) and ^^i^g ^^^^rous to ^^^^port the ^^^e good, (...) an ^^h^r
(...) customers di^^^^^^ and d^^^i^e them, u^^ill (...) r^^^iue other second
(...).

LVII
And vvher^^^ in the Imperial C^p^tu^^^^^ is ^xpres^^^ that in all the
differences, and suites with the English Nation our Magistrates are not to
hear nor decide the cause, unless their Embas^^^our or Consul be there
present. Of late our Judges without the Knowledge of their Ambassador have
condemned, imprisoned, (...) taken presents from the English Nation which is a
great vvrong done to them.

LVIII
Also whereas in the Imperial Capitulations, it is ordered, that the
Customers shall not take any custom for such gold, and dollars as by the
English Nation shall be brought in, or carried out of Our Imperial Dominions,
and that the merchants are to give only three percent, for the custom of t^eir
goods, and no more; the Customers notvvithstanding do pre^end to take custom
for their ^^equeens, and dollars; and to take more custom then their due for
their raw silks, which they buy, and of the goods which they land at
Scanderoone to carry up to Aleppo, they demand six per cento; which unjust
exactions have been heretofore rectifyed, and redressed with an express
Hatte sheriff. But being now again informed, that the said ^nglish
merchants, are as before vvronged, by reason that the Customers do ualue, and
estimate the goods of the English merchants more then they are vvor^h; and
though the Customers are to have bu^ three percent yet by an over ualuation of
the goods they take from them six per cent. And the servants of the Custom
house under pretense of small duties, and expenses wrongfully take great
sum^es of mo^y from them. And a greater number of vvaiters being put aboard the
English ships, then heretofore have been used, the charges thereof are a great
expense to the merchants, and masters of ships that sustain it. To all which,
we being requested for a redress, do Com^and, that when the Customers do
set great ualues upon their goods, th merchant offering to them according to
the rate of three per cent in specie of the same goods, the Customers shall not
refuse but accept the same. And being desired by the English Ambassador that
the bone specifyed abuses, and injustice should be rectifyed we Do Com^and,
that contrary to the Imperial Capitulations the English merchants be neither
in the foregoing particulars, nor in any other manner troubled nor their
privileges uniustly infringed.

The Ambassador of the King of Great Britain sir Heneage ^inch Knight, Farle
of VVinchilsea, Viscount Maidston, Baron Fit^herbert of ^a^^vvell, Lord of the
Royal Manor of wye, and I Leiuetenant of the Coun^ie of Kent, and City of
Canterbury, whose end may it terminate wi^h bliss: did a^riue with his
presents, and with all sincerity, and affection was accompanied with
letters amply expressing the good friendship, and correspondence; and that
above said Ambassador has presented the Capitulations that they might be
renewed according to the Cannon And that ^o^e Articles of great consideration
which were before in the ^apitulations may be more punctually ob^erued, the
said (...) a^ adour did desire that they might be again renewed, and more ^
ainly expressed in the Imperial Capitulations His request was graciously
accepted; one of which points is this.

LIX
That the galleys, and other uessells of the Imperial Fleet departing the
dominions of the Grand Signor, and meeting on the s^a with the ships of
England, they shall in no wise give them molestation, nor detain them in
their uoyage, nor take from them any thing whatsoever, but ought a^lvvayes to
shovv to one and other good friendship, without doing the least damage,. And
it being thus dec ared in the Imperial Capitulations, the B^yes and Captains,
who sail upon the Seas, and those of Algier, T^^ is, and Tripoli meeting
English ships which sail from one Port to an other ought not ^o take from
them any money, or goods upon pretense that their ships transport enemies goods,
and there upon search them, and with this color molest, and de^aine them from
prosecution of their uoyage, so that only at the mouth of the castles, and in
the Ports where the searchers belonging to the customs usual y come aboard,
their goods shall be examined, but on the Sea, they shall be liable to no
farther search or inquisition.

LX
And contrary to the Articles of the Imperial Capitulations, the goods of the
English Nation ought to receive no molestation ^auing once paid the Custom,
nor shall the customers deny to give the ^eschere, or certificate that the
custom is said for, upon complaint hereof, we strictly com^and that the
a^oresaid Cu^^omers do not defer im^ediately upon demand to give the
Teschere or certificate,

LXI
And the custom being once paid of any sort of merchandise not sold in that
Port, which is to be transported to an other Scale, entire credit shall be
given to the Teschere and a second custom shall not be so much as farther
pretended

LXII
In Aleppo, Cairo, and other parts of the Imperial Dominions, the English
merchants, and their servants may freely, and frankly trade, and for all their
goods, and merchandise pay only three per cento according to the former
custom, and the Imperial Capitulations, whether the goods be brought by
sea, or by land. And though the Customers, and Farmers upon the arrival o^ the
goods at the Scale to give molestation, and trouble ^o the English Nation,
pretend: that the goods of the growth, and manufacture of E^^land ought only
to pay three per cent, but goods brought from Ve^ice, and other places are
obliged to pay more, and with this color and pretense occasion suites, and
troubles to the English wherefore in this point let the Imperial
Capitulations be observed as in former times, and Our officers ought in no
wise to permit the contrary hereunto.

LXIII
An Englishman becoming indebted, or having made himself pledge for an other,
who is either failed, or run away; the debt ought to be demanded of the
debtour; And if the Creditor have no Hoge^, that such an o^e according to the
law has made himself pledge, and security; the debt shall not be demanded
of the other; which Article is already declared in the capitulations.

LXIIII
Whereas some times an Englishman living in a country to free himself from a
debt draws a ^ill of Exchange upon an other Englishman who has no ef^ects
of his in his hands, and the person to whom the mo^y is paya^le being a man
of power, and authority, brings ^i^ ^ill, and ^^ntrary to the law, and the
Capitulations d^^ands, and forces payment of the bill, in vv^ich case the
merchant accepting the bill, shall be obliged to satisfy it, but not accepting
of it, he shall be liable to no farther trouble.

LXV
And the Interpreters of the ^^b^s^adour of England being free by the Articles,
declared in the ^^^i^^t ^apitulations of all Angaria, or taxes; by virtue also
of ^^is present article, when any of the said In^erp^eters die, their goods,
or estate shall not be subject to the Cassam, but shall be divided amongst
the creditours, and ^eires.

LXVI
And the King of England being a true friend to this Our happy Port To his
Em^^s^a^^ur who re^^^^^ here ten Ser^^nts of what nation soever shall be
allowed f ee from Harach or taxes, or moles^ation of any man.

LXVII
An Englishman tur^ing Mohammedan, and having good^, or estate in hi^ ^a^d^
^el^^gi^^ to his English ^rincipalls, t^^se goods or estate s^^^^ ^ee delivered
into the hands of the ^^bas^^dour, or Consul tha^ they may convey, and make
them good to the true owners.

Let all the forementioned Articles be punctually observed: And the said
^^^as^adour des^ring ^^at th^se additions should be i^serted in the I^peria^l
Capit^^^ti^ns, his re^^^^ was graciously received; and ^he Imperial
Capi^u^^tions vvhic^ were formerly given are renewed, and conjoined with
these ^resent. And according to Our Imperial Signature let this Imperial
Capitul^tion be again granted. And WE COMMAND, that vvhiles: this present
King of England CHARLES the Second, whose end terminate in bliss, and
happiness; does in the same manner, as in the times of my deceased progenitors
conserve the like friendly and faithful correspondence: I do Accept, and
PROMISE to obser^e, and according to my promise, and oath, I Swear, and
Promise by that One God, Creator of Heaven, and Earth and of all the
Creatures, that contrary to these present Capitulations, no breach, nor
uiolence shall be offered either by me, or mine but shall be observed by all.
