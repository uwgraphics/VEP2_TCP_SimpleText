The Order for Morning Prayer.
Let him that ministers read with a loud voice these Sentences of Scripture,
and after them the Exhortation following. COrrect us, O Lord, Jer. x. 24.
but with judgment; not in thine anger: lest thou bring us to nothing. O our
God, incline thine ear and hear; Dan. ix.18.
open thine eyes, and behold: for we do not present our supplications unto thee
for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. O Lord hear, O Lord
forgive, O Lord hearken, 19.
and do, and defer not for thine own sake, and for thy people that are called
by thy name. DEarly beloved brethren, the Scripture moves us in sundry places,
to acknowledge and consess our manifold sins and wickedness, and that we should
not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty God our heavenly
Father, but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient heart,
to the end, that we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by his infinite
goodness and mercy. And although we ought at all times humbly to acknowledge
our sins before God, yet ought we most chiefly so to do, when we assemble and
meet together, to render thanks for the great benefits that we have received at
his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise, to hear his most holy Word, and
to ask those things which are requisite and necessary, as well for the body as
the soul. Wherefore I pray and beseech you as many as are here present, to
accompany me with a pure heart and humble voice, unto the throne of the
heavenly grace, saying after me.


The Confession to be said of the whole Congregation after the Minister, all
kneeling. ALmighty and most merciful Father; We have erred and strayed from thy
ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires of our
own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left undone those
things which we ought to have done; And we have done those things which we
ought not to have done; And there is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have
mercy upon us miserable offenders. Spare thou them, O God, which confess their
faults. Restore thou them that are penitent; According to thy promises declared
unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for
his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the
glory of thy holy Name. Amen.


The Absolution to be pronounced by the Priest alone, standing; the People
still kneeling. ALmighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desires
not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and
live; and has given power and commandment to his Ministers, to declare and
pronounce to his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of their
sins: He pardons and absolveth all them that truly repent, and unfeignedly
believe his holy Gospel. Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true
repentance and his holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do at
this present, and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and holy, so
that at the last we may come to his eternal joy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.


The People shall answer here, and at the end of all other Prayers, Amen. Then
the Minister shall kneel, and say the Lords Prayer; the People also kneeling
and repeating it with him. OUr Father which art in Heaven; Hallowed be thy
Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us
this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them
that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; But deliver us from
evil: For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, for ever and
ever. Amen.


Then likewise he shall say, O Lord open thou our lips.

Ans. And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.

Priest. O God make speed to save us.

Ans. O Lord make haste to help us.

Here all standing up, the Priest shall say, Glory be to the Father, and to the
Son: and to the holy Ghost;

Answer. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
end. Amen.

Priest. Praise ye the Lord.

Answer. The Lords name be praised.

Instead of the Venite, exultemus, shall be said this Hymn following; one Verse
by the Priest, another by the Clerk and People. LEt God arise, and let his
enemies be scattered: Psalm. lxviii. 1.
let them also that hate him flee before him.

Like as the smoke vanishes, so shall thou drive them away: 2.
and like as the wax melts at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the
presence of God.

I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people: Psalm iii 5.
that have set themselves against me round about.

Destroy thou them, Ps. v. 10.
O God, let them fall by their own counsels: cast them out in the multitude of
their transgressions, for they have rebelled against thee.

The Lord will abhor the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.

6.
But let all those that trust in thee rejoice: 11.
Let them ever shout for joy.

For thou Lord, 12.
wilt bless the righteous: with thy favor will thou compass him as with a
shield.

Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: Ps. vi. 10.
let them return and be ashamed suddenly.

O Lord my God, Ps. vii. 1.
in thee do I put my trust: Save me from all them that persecute me and deliver
me.

Arise, 6.
O Lord, in thine anger, lift up thy self, because of the rage of mine enemies,
and awake for me to the judgment that thou have commanded.

So shall the Congregation of the people compass thee about: 7.
For their sakes therefore return thou on high.

Through God we shall do valiantly: Ps. cviii.13.
for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.

Glory be to the Father, etc.
As it was in the beginning, etc.

Instead of the Psalms for the Day, shall these proper Psalms be used, ^. IX.
X. The first Lesson, 2 Chronicles. Chap. 20. to v. 31. After the first Lesson, shall
follow Te Deum Laudamus in English. WE praise thee, O God: we acknowledge thee
to be the Lord.
All the earth does worship thee: the Father everlasting.
To thee all angels cry aloud: the heavens, and all the powers therein.
To thee Cherubin, and Seraphin: continually do cry,
Holy, holy, holy: Lord God of Sabbath.
Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty: of thy glory.
The glorious company of the Apostles: praise thee.
The goodly fellowship of the Prophets: praise thee.
The noble army of Martyrs: praise thee.
The holy Church throughout all the world: does acknowledge thee;
The Father: of an infinite Majesty;
Thine honorable, true: and only Son;
Also the holy Ghost: the Comforter.
Thou art the King of Glory: O Christ.
Thou art the everlasting Son: of the Father.
When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man: thou did not abhor the Virgins
womb.
When thou had overcome the sharpness of death: thou did open the Kingdom
of heaven to all believers.
Thou sit at the right hand of God: in the glory of the Father.
We believe that thou shall come: to be our Judge.
We therefore pray thee, help thy servants: whom thou have redeemed with thy
precious blood.
Make them to be numbered with thy Saints: in glory everlasting.
O Lord, save thy people: and bless thine heritage.
Govern them: and lift them up for ever.
Day by day: we magnify thee;
And we worship thy Name: ever world without end.
Vouchsafe, O Lord: to keep us this day without sin.
O Lord, have mercy upon us: have mercy upon us.
O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us: as our trust is in thee.
O Lord, in thee have I trusted: let me never be confounded.
The second Lesson, Heb. XI. Jubilate Deo. Psalm. C.
O Be joyful in the Lord all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure, that the Lord he is God: it is he that has made us, and not we
our selves, we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
praise: be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endures
from generation to generation.
Glory be to the Father, etc.
As it was in the beginning, etc.
Then shall be said the Creed by the Minister, and the People standing. I
Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the holy
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
dead and buried, He descended into hell; The third day he rose again from the
dead, He ascended into heaven, And sits on the right hand of God the Father
Almighty; From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the holy Ghost; The holy Catholic Church; The Communion of
Saints; The forgiveness of sins; The resurrection of the body, And the life
everlasting. Amen.


And after that, these Prayers following, all devoutly kneeling, the Minister
first pronouncing with a loud voice, The Lord be with you.

Answer. And with thy Spirit.

Minister. Let us pray.
Lord, have mercy upon us.

Christ, have mercy upon us.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

Then the Minister, Clerks and People shall say the Lords Prayer with a loud
voice. OUr Father which art in heaven; Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against
us. And lead us not into temptation; But deliver us from evil. Amen.


Then the Priest standing, shall say, O Lord, show thy mercy upon us.

Answ. And grant us thy salvation.

Priest. O Lord, save the King and Queen.

Answ. And mercifully hear us when we call upon thee.

Priest. Endue thy Ministers with righteousness.

Answ. And make thy chosen people joyful.

Priest. O Lord, save thy people.

Answ. And bless thine inheritance.

Priest. Give peace in our time, O Lord.

Answ. Because there is none other that fights for us, but only thou, O God.

Priest. O Lord, save thy servants,

Answ. Who do put their trust in thee.

Priest. Send us help from thy holy place.

Answ. And evermore mightily defend us.

Priest. Let the enemy have no advantage against us:

Answ. Nor the wicked approach to hurt us.

Priest. Be unto us, O Lord, a strong tower,

Answ. From the face of our enemies.

Priest. O Lord hear our Prayer,

Answ. And let our cry come unto thee.

Instead of the Collect for the Day, shall be used these which follow, both in
Morning and Evening Prayer, and in the Communion Service. O God our refuge and
strength, whose power no Creature is able to resist, who teach our hands to
War, and our fingers to fight, and without whom the Horse and Chariot is in
vain prepared against the day of Battle; defend us we beseech thee with thy
mighty power, and save us with thy out stretched arm, that our Forces may be
preserved, and become Victorious by Sea and Land, evermore serving under his
glorious Banner who is the Lord of Hosts, God blessed for ever. Amen.


O most glorious and gracious God, whose Judgments against obstinate offenders
are most severe and terrible, But whose Mercies are infinite to all them that
with hearty Repentance and true Faith turn unto thee; We the sinful People of
this Land, do acknowledge before thee, to thy glory and our own shame, that
never any Nation had greater experience of thy goodness, nor ever did any more
unthankfully abuse it. When thou gave us great and long Prosperity, we like
Jesurun wared fat and kicked against thee; when thou did thrust us into those
Confusions, out of which we saw little hopes of arising, even in the time of
that distress did we trespass yet more against thee. When by miracles of mercy
thou had turned our Captivity, we soon forgot thee our Savior, and returned
again to our folly; And even while thou have of late appeared for us, by
delivering us out of the hands of our implacable Enemies of the Romish Faction,
we have by our sins been fighting against heaven and against thee; And now we
are no more worthy to be called thy Sons or thy Servants, whom neither thy fear
has driven to repentance, nor thy goodness led to it. In mercy, O God, awaken
us all; beget in us a holy dread of thy Judgments, and a deep sense of our
manifold and repeated provocations, pardon the great offenses of us thy
servants, and the crying sins of the whole Nation, remove the evils we still
lie under, avert those we have just cause to fear; and howsoever thou may
think fit to Correct us for our sins, yet never deliver us up into the hands of
those men whose mercies are cruel; pour out thy abundant blessings upon our
Gracious King and Queen, and their great Council now Assembled in Parliament,
keep them as the apple of thy eye, hide them under the shadow of thy wings,
direct and bless them in all their Consultations. And more particularly we now
prostrate our selves before thee to implore thy blessing upon this their great
undertaking for the necessary defense of thy people; Go forth with their Fleets
and Armies, compass them with thy Favor as with a Shield, let it appear that
thou the Lord our God art with us to help us, and to fight our Battles, bless
us with Victory and Success, and in thy own good time with such a Peace as may
tend to the glory of thy great Name, and the Preservation of thy Church and
true Religion among us, the Honor and Safety of Their Majesty's, and the
Security, Peace and Prosperity of these Kingdoms; All which we humbly beg in
the Name and through the Mediation of thy Son Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.


The Collect for Peace. O God who art the author of Peace, and lover of
Concord, in knowledge of whom stands our eternal life, whose service is
perfect freedom; Defend us thy humble servants in all assaults of our enemies,
that we surely trusting in thy defense, may not fear the power of any
adversaries, through the might of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Collect for Grace. O Lord our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting
God, who have safely brought us to the beginning of this day; defend us in the
same with thy mighty power, and grant that this day we fall into no sin,
neither run into any kind of danger; but that all our doings may be ordered by
thy governance, to do always that is righteous in thy sight, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.

miserable sinners.

multitude of thy mercies look upon us, through the merits and mediation of thy
blessed Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


A Prayer for all the Reformed Churches. O God the Father of mercies, who of
thy great goodness have united us into the mystical body of Christ (that is his
Church) we as living members thereof, mourning with them that mourn, and
rejoicing with them that rejoice, do now present our Supplications and Prayers
at the Throne of Grace, in behalf of all the Reformed Churches, beseeching thee
to look down with an eye of mercy and pity, upon the sad and mournful estate of
such of them whom thou have delivered over to the hands of superstitious and
merciless men, who have compelled so many of them to defile themselves with
their Idolatrous Worship; stretch out thy Arm against those deceitful and
bloody men, suffer them not still to triumph over thy Heritage. How long, Lord,
shall thy anger burn for ever! How long will thou forget thy People, that
prays! Oh let the cry of the Blood of thy Saints, and the sighing of the
Prisoners, come before thee! Deliver thou those that are as Sheep appointed for
the slaughter. Hear us, O God, for thy mercy's sake, and for the honor of thy
great Name. Plead thy Cause with them that blaspheme thy Truth and persecute
thy People, that so all men may say, Verily there is a God that judges in the
Earth. Purge all thy Churches from their dregs, and make them meet for a
glorious Deliverance, that so all the world may see the Salvation of our God;
and that though he hides his face from his People for a season, yet he will not
cast them off utterly. Grant that thy true Religion may so shine, as to become
the Joy of the whole Earth, and that all Antichristian Idolatry, Superstition,
and Cruelty, being cast out of thy House, all that name the Name of Christ, may
depart from iniquity, and walk worthy of their holy profession, that the
Kingdom of thy dear Son may come quickly; and that all his enemies being made
his footstool, he who is the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, may reign to
all the ends of the Earth: To whom, with thee, O Father, and the Holy Ghost, be
all honor and glory for evermore. Amen.

A Prayer of St. Chrysostom. ALmighty God, who have given us grace at this time
with one accord to make our common supplications unto thee, and do promise,
that when two or three are gathered together in thy Name, thou will grant their
requests; Fulfill now, O Lord, the desires and Petitions of thy servants, as may
be most expedient for them; granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth,
and in the world to come life everlasting. Amen.

2 Cor. 13.14. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen.

The Communion-Service.
The Priest standing at the North-side of the Lords Table shall say, OUr Father
which art in heaven; Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us
our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not
into temptation; But deliver us from evil. Amen.

ALmighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and from whom
no secrets are hid; cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of
thy holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy
holy Name, through Christ our Lord. Amen.


Minister. GOd spoke these words, and said, I am the Lord thy God: Thou shall
have none other gods but me.


People. Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this Law.


Minister. Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the likeness
of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water
under the earth. Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship them: for I the
Lord thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show
mercy unto thousands in them that love me, and keep my commandments.


People. Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.


Minister. Thou shall not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the
Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.


People. Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this Law.


Minister. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath Day. Six days shall thou
labor and do all that thou have to do, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of
the Lord thy God. In it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and
thy daughter, thy manservant, and thy maidservant, thy cattle, and the
stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.


People. Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this Law.


Minister. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the
land which the Lord thy God gives thee.


People. Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this Law.

Minister. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.


People. Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this Law.


Minister. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy
neighbors wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor
any thing that is his.


People. Lord have mercy upon us, and write all these thy Laws in our hearts,
we beseech thee.


Let us pray.

ALmighty God, whose kingdom is everlasting and power infinite; Have mercy upon
the whole Church, and so rule the hearts of thy chosen servants William and
Mary our King and Queen, that they (knowing whose Ministers they are) may above
all things seek thy honor and glory; And that we and all their Subjects (duly
considering whose Authority they have) may faithfully serve, honor and humbly
obey them, in thee, and for thee, according to thy blessed Word and Ordinance,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee and the holy Ghost, lives and
reigns ever one God, world without end. Amen.

O God our refuge and strength, whose power no Creature is able to resist, who
teach our hands to War, and our fingers to fight, and without whom the Horse
and Chariot is in vain prepared against the day of Battle; defend us we beseech
thee with thy mighty power, and save us with thy outstretched arm, that our
Forces may be preserved, and become Victorious by Sea and Land, evermore
serving under his glorious Banner who is the Lord of Hosts, God blessed for
ever. Amen.

O Most glorious and gracious God, whose Judgments against obstinate offenders
are most severe and terrible, But whose Mercies are infinite to all them that
with hearty Repentance and true Faith turn unto thee; We the sinful People of
this Land, do acknowledge before thee, to thy glory, and our own shame, that
never any Nation had greater experience of thy goodness, nor ever did any more
unthankfully abuse it. When thou gave us great and long Prosperity, we like
Jesurun waxed fat and kicked against thee; when thou did thrust us into those
Confusions, out of which we saw little hopes of arising, even in the time of
that distress did we trespass yet more against thee. When by miracles of mercy
thou had turned our Captivity, we soon forgot thee our Savior, and returned
again to our folly; And even while thou have of late appeared for us, by
delivering us out of the hands of our implacable Enemies of the Romish Faction,
we have by our sins been fighting against heaven and against thee; And now we
are no more worthy to be called thy Sons or thy Servants, whom neither thy fear
has driven to repentance, nor thy goodness led to it. In mercy O God awaken us
all; beget in us a holy dread of thy Judgments, and a deep sense of our
manifold and repeated provocations, pardon the great offenses of us thy
servants, and the crying sins of the whole Nation, remove the evils we still
lie under, avert those we have just cause to fear; and howsoever thou may
think fit to Correct us for our sins, yet never deliver us up into the hands of
those men whose mercies are cruel; pour out thy abundant blessings upon our
Gracious King and Queen, and Their great Council now Assembled in Parliament,
keep them as the apple of thy eye, hide them under the shadow of thy wings,
direct and bless them in all their Consultations. And more particularly we now
prostrate our selves before thee to implore thy blessing upon this their great
undertaking for the necessary defense of thy people; Go forth with their Fleets
and Armies, compass them with thy Favor as with a Shield, let it appear that
thou the Lord our God art with us to help us, and to fight our Battles; bless
us with Victory and Success, and in thy own good time with such a Peace as may
tend to the glory of thy great Name, and the Preservation of thy Church and
true Religion among us, the Honor and Safety of Their Majesty's, and the
Security, Peace and Prosperity of these Kingdoms; All which we humbly beg in
the Name and through the Mediation of thy Son Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.


For the Epistle, Deuteronomy. 20. v. 1. to v. 5. When thou go out to battle
against thine enemies, and see horses, and chariots, and a people more then
thou, be not afraid of them: for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought
thee up out of the land of Egypt. And it shall be when ye are come nigh unto
the battle, that the priest shall approach, and speak unto the people, And
shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, you approach this day unto battle against
your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither
be ye terrified because of them. For the Lord your God is he that goes with
you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
The Gospel, St. Matthew. 24. v. 4. to v. 14. JEsus said unto his disciples, Take
heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am
Christ: and shall deceive many. And ye shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars:
see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the
end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in diverse
places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall they deliver you up
to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for
my names sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,
and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise, and shall
deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
I Believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, And of
all things visible and invisible:

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, Begotten of his
Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of very God,
Begotten, not made, Being of one substance with the Father, By whom all things
were made: Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven, And
was incarnate by the holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, And was made man, And was
crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was buried, And the
third day he rose again according to the Scriptures, And ascended into heaven,
And sits on the right hand of the Father. And he shall come again with glory
to judge both the quick and the dead: Whose kingdom shall have no end.

And I believe in the holy Ghost, The Lord and giver of life, Who proceeds
from the Father and the Son, Who with the Father and the Son together is
worshipped and glorified, Who spoke by the prophets. And I believe one
Catholic and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of
sins, And I look for the Resurrection of the dead, And the life of the world to
come. Amen.


Then follows the Sermon; and after that shall be said, Let your light so
shine before men, S. Mat. v.16.
that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in
heaven. As we have therefore opportunity, Gal. vi. 10:
let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of
faith.
Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church militant here in earth.

ALmighty and everliving God, who by thy holy Apostle have taught us to make
prayers and supplications, and to give thanks for all men; We humbly beseech
thee most mercifully [ to accept our alms and oblations, If there be no alms or
oblations, then shall the words [of accepting our alms and oblations] be left
out unsaid.
and] to receive these our prayers, which we offer unto thy divine Majesty,
beseeching thee to inspire continually the universal Church with the spirit of
truth, unity, and concord: and grant that all they that do confess thy holy
Name, may agree in the truth of thy holy word, and live in unity and godly
love. We beseech thee also to save and defend all Christian kings, princes and
governors; and especially thy servants WILLIAM and MARY our King and Queen,
that under them we may be godly and quietly governed: and grant unto their
whole Council, and to all that are put in authority under them, that they may
truly and indifferently minister justice, to the punishment of wickedness and
vice, and to the maintenance of thy true religion and virtue. Give grace, O
heavenly Father, to all Bishops, and Curates, that they may both by their life
and doctrine set forth thy true and lively word, and rightly and duly
administer thy holy Sacraments: And to all thy people give thy heavenly grace;
and especially to this Congregation here present, that with meek heart and due
reverence, they may hear and receive thy holy Word, truly serving thee in
holiness and righteousness all the days of their life. And we most humbly
beseech thee of thy goodness, O Lord, to comfort and succor all them who in
this transitory life, are in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other
adversity, And we also bless thy holy Name, for all thy servants departed this
life in thy faith and fear; beseeching thee to give us grace so to follow their
good examples, that with them we may be partakers of thy heavenly Kingdom.
Grant this, O Father, for Jesus Christ's sake, our only Mediator and Advocate.
Amen.


O God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ our only Savior, the Prince of
Peace, look down in much pity and compassion upon this Church and Nation, now
seeking unto thee in Fasting and Prayer, stir up, we beseech thee, every soul
among us, to cast forth the accursed thing, to root out of our hearts all
pride, and all wrath and bitterness, all unjust prejudice and causeless
jealousy, all hatred, and malice, and desire of revenge, and whatsoever may
hinder us from discerning the things that belong unto our peace. And by the
power of thy holy Spirit do thou dispose all our hearts to such meekness of
wisdom, lowliness of mind, patience, gentleness, and long-suffering, and
forbearance of one another in love, and such Honor and Reverence of those whom
thou have set over us, as becomes the Sons of Peace, that so the God of Peace
may be with us. Give us grace, O Lord, serioufly to lay to heart the great
Dangers we are in, by our unhappy Divisions, and the great Obligations which
lie upon us to godly Union and Concord: That as there is but one Body, and one
Spirit, and one Hope of our Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God
and Father of us all; so we may henceforth be all of one Heart and of one Soul,
united in one holy Bond of Truth and Peace, of Faith and Charity, and may with
one mind and one mouth glorify thee, O Lord; who with thy Father and holy
Spirit, live and reignest, one God, world without end. Amen.


ALmighty God, who have promised to hear the petitions of them that ask in thy
Sons Name; We beseech thee mercifully to incline thine ears to us that have
made now our prayers and supplications unto thee, and grant that those things
which we have faithfully asked according to thy will, may effectually be
obtained, to the relief of our necessity, and to the setting forth of thy
glory, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


Then the Priest (or Bishop, if he be present) shall let them depart with this
Blessing. THe peace of God which passes all understanding, keep your hearts
and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our
Lord: And the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, be amongst you, and remain with you always. Amen.


The Order for Evening Prayer.
Let him that ministers read with a loud voice these Sentences of Scripture,
and after them the Exhortation following. COrrect us, O Lord, Jer. x. 24.
but with judgment; not in thine anger: least thou bring us to nothing. O our
God, Dan. ix.
incline thine ear and hear; open thine eyes, and behold: O Lord hear, O Lord
forgive, O Lord hearken, DEarly beloved brethren, the Scripture moves us in
sundry places, to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness, and
that we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of almighty God our
heavenly Father, but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient
heart, to the end, that we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by his infinite
goodness and mercy. And although we ought at all times humbly to acknowledge
our sins before God, yet ought we most chiefly so to do, when we assemble and
meet together, to render thanks for the great benefits that we have received at
his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise, to hear his most holy Word, and
to ask those things which are requisite and necessary, as well for the body as
the soul. Wherefore I pray and beseech you as many as are here present, to
accompany me with a pure heart and humble voice, unto the throne of the
heavenly grace, saying after me.


The Confession to be said of the whole Congregation after the Minister, all
kneeling. ALmighty and most merciful Father; We have erred and strayed from thy
ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires of our
own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left undone those
things which we ought to have done; And we have done those things which we
ought not to have done; And there is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have
mercy upon us miserable offenders. Spare thou them, O God, which confess their
faults. Restore thou them that are penitent; According to thy promises declared
unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for
his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the
glory of thy holy Name. Amen.


The Absolution to be pronounced by the Priest alone, standing; the People
still kneeling. ALmighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desires
not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and
live; and has given power and commandment to his Ministers, to declare and
pronounce to his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of their
sins: He pardons and absolveth all them that truly repent, and unfeignedly
believe his holy Gospel. Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true
repentance and his holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do at
this present, and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and holy, so
that at the last we may come to his eternal joy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.


Then the Minister shall kneel, and say the Lords Prayer; the People also
kneeling, and repeating it with him. OUr Father which art in Heaven; Hallowed
be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; But deliver us
from evil: For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, for ever and
ever. Amen.


Then likewise he shall say, O Lord, open thou our lips.


Answer. And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.

Priest. O God, make speed to save us.

Answer. O Lord, make haste to help us.

Here all standing up, the Priest shall say, Glory be to the Father, and to the
Son: and to the holy Ghost;


Answer. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
end. Amen.

Priest. Praise ye the Lord.

Answer. The Lords name be praised.

Proper Psalms are, XI. XXVII. LXIII. The First Lesson I. Sam. VII. to v. 16.
Magnificat. S. Luke I. 46.
MY soul does magnify the Lord: and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
For he has regarded: the lowliness of his handmaiden.
For behold, from henceforth: all generations shall call me blessed.
For he that is mighty has magnified me: and holy is his Name.
And his mercy is on them that fear him: throughout all generations.
He has showed strength with his arm: he has scattered the proud in the
imagination of their hearts.
He has put down the mighty from their seat: and has eralted the humble and
meek.
He has filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he has sent empty
away.
He remembering his mercy has helped his servant Israel: as he promised to our
forefathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.
The second Lesson, 1 Cor. X. to v. 15. Deus Misereatur. Psalm. 67.
GOd be merciful unto us, and bless us: and show us the light of his
countenance, and be merciful unto us.
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shall judge the folk
righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.
Glory be to the Father, etc.
As it was in the beginning, etc.
Then shall be said the Apostles Creed by the Minister, and the people
standing. I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, Who was conceived by the holy
Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified,
dead, and buried, He descended into hell; The third day he rose again from the
dead, He ascended into heaven, And sits on the right hand of God the Father
Almighty; From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the holy Ghost; The holy Catholic Church; The Communion of
Saints; The forgiveness of sins; The resurrection of the body, And the life
everlasting. Amen.


And after that, these Prayers following, all devoutly kneeling, the Minister
first pronouncing with a loud voice, The Lord be with you.

Answer. And with thy Spirit.

Minister. Let us pray.
Lord, have mercy upon us.

Christ, have mercy upon us.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

Then the Minister, Clerks, and people, shall say the Lords Prayer with a loud
voice. OUr Father which art in heaven; Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against
us. And lead us not into temptation; But deliver us from evil. Amen.


Then the Priest standing up, shall say, O Lord, show thy mercy upon us.


Answer. And grant us thy salvation.

Priest. O Lord, save the King and Queen.

Answ. And mercifully hear us when we call upon thee.

Priest. Indue thy Ministers with righteousness.

Answ. And make thy chosen people joyful.

Priest. O Lord, save thy people.

Answ. And bless thine inheritance.

Priest. Give peace in our time, O Lord.

Answ. Because there is none other that fights for us, but only thou, O God.

Priest. O Lord, save thy servants,

Answ. Who do put their trust in thee.

Priest. Send us help from thy holy place,

Answ. And evermore mightily defend us.

Priest. Let the enemy have no advantage against us:

Answ. Nor the wicked approach to hurt us.

Priest. Be unto us, O Lord, a strong tower,

Answ. From the face of our enemies.

Priest. O Lord, hear our prayer,

Answ. And let our cry come unto thee.

Instead of the Collect for the day, shall be used these which follow. O God
our refuge and strength, whose power no Creature is able to resist, who
teach our hands to War, and our fingers to fight, and without whom the Horse
and Chariot is in vain prepared against the day of Battle; defend us, we
beseech thee, with thy mighty power, and save us with thy outstretched arm,
that our Forces may be preserved, and become Victorious by Sea and Land,
evermore serving under his glorious Banner who is the Lord of Hosts, God
blessed for ever. Amen.


O most glorious and gracious God, whose Judgments against obstinate offenders
are most severe and terrible, But whose Mercies are infinite to all them, that
with hearty Repentance and true Faith turn unto thee; We the sinful People of
this Land, do acknowledge before thee, to thy glory and our own shame, that
never any Nation had greater experience of thy goodness, nor ever did any more
unthankfully abuse it. When thou gave us great and long Prosperity, we like
Jesurun waxed fat and kicked against thee; when thou did thrust us into those
Confusions, out of which we saw little hopes of arising, even in the time of
that distress did we trespass yet more against thee. When by miracles of mercy
thou had turned our Captivity, we soon forgot thee our Savior, and returned
again to our folly; And even while thou have of late appeared for us, by
delivering us out of the hands of our implacable Enemies of the Romish Faction,
we have by our sins been fighting against heaven and against thee; And now we
are no more worthy to be called thy Sons or thy Servants, whom neither thy Fear
has driven to repentance, nor thy Goodness led to it. In mercy, O God, awaken
us all; beget in us a holy dread of thy Judgments, and a deep sense of our
manifold and repeated provocations, pardon the great offenses of us thy
servants, and the crying sins of the whole Nation, remove the evils we still
lie under, avert those we have just cause to fear; and howsoever thou may
think fit to Correct us for our sins, yet never deliver us up into the hands of
those men whose mercies are cruel. Pour out thy abundant Blessings upon our
Gracious King and Queen, and their great Council now Assembled in Parliament,
keep them as the apple of thy eye, hide them under the shadow of thy wings,
direct and bless them in all their Consultations. And more particularly we now
prostrate our selves before thee to implore thy blessing upon this their great
undertaking for the necessary defense of thy people; Go forth with their Fleets
and Armies, compass them with thy Favor as with a Shield, let it appear that
thou the Lord our God art with us to help us, and to fight our Batels, bless us
with Victory and Success, and in thy own good time with such a Peace as may
tend to the glory of thy great Name, and the Preservation of thy Church and
true Religion among us, the Honor and Safety of their Majesty's, and the
Security, Peace and Prosperity of these Kingdoms; All which we humbly beg in
the Name, and through the Med^ation of thy Son Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.


O God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do
proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot give, that
both our hearts may be set to obey thy Commandments, and also that by thee we
being defended from the fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and
quietness, through the merits of Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.


LIghten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord, and by thy great mercy defend
us from all perils and dangers of this night, for the love of thy only Son, our
Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.


O Lord, we beseech thee mercifully hear our prayers, and spare all those who
confess their sins unto thee, that they whose consciences by sin are accused,
by thy merciful pardon may be absolved, through Christ our Lord. Amen.


O Most mighty God, and merciful Father, who have compassion upon all men, and
hate nothing that thou have made, who would not the death of a sinner, but
that he should rather turn from his sin, and be saved; Mercifully forgive us
our trespasses; receive and comfort us, who are grieved and wearied with the
burden of our sins. Thy property is always to have mercy; to thee only it
appertains to forgive sins. Spare us therefore, good Lord, spare thy people
whom thou have redeemed; enter not into Judgment with thy servants, who are
vile earth, and miserable sinners; but so turn thine anger from us, who meekly
acknowledge our vileness, and truly repent us of our faults; and so make haste
to help us in this world, that we may ever live with thee in the world to come,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


Then shall the people say this that follows, after the Minister. TVrn thou
us, O good Lord, and so shall we be turned. Be favorable, O Lord, be
favorable to thy people, who turn to thee in weeping, fasting, and praying.
For thou art a merciful God, full of compassion, long suffering, and of great
pity. Thou sparest when we deferve punishment, and in thy wrath think upon
mercy. Spare thy people, good Lord, spare them, and let not thine heritage be
brought to confusion. Hear us, O Lord, for thy mercy is great, and after the
multitude of thy mercies look upon us, through the merits and mediation of thy
blessed Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


A Prayer for the Kings Majesty. O Lord our heavenly father, high and mighty
King of kings, Lord of lords, the only Ruler of Princes, who do from thy
throne behold all the dwellers upon earth; most heartily we beseech thee with
thy favor to behold our most gracious Sovereign Lord and Lady, King William
and Queen Mary, and so replenish them with the grace of thy Holy Spirit, that
they may always incline to thy will, and walk in thy way; endue them plenteously
with heavenly gifts; grant them in health and wealth long to live; strengthen
them that they may vanquish and overcome all their enemies, and finally after
this life they may attain everlasting joy and felicity, through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.

A Prayer for the Royal Family. ALmighty God, the fountain of all goodness, we
humbly beseech thee to bless Catherine the Queen Dowager, her Royal Highness
the Princess Anne of Denmark, and all the Royal Family: Endue them with thy
holy Spirit; enrich them with thy heavenly grace; prosper them with all
happiness; and bring them to thine everlasting Kingdom, through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.

A Prayer for the Clergy and People. ALmighty and everlasting God, who alone
workest great marvels; Send down upon our Bishops, and Curates, and all
Congregations committed to their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy grace; and
that they may truly please thee, pour upon them the continual dew of thy
blessing. Grant this, O Lord, for the honor of our Advocate and Mediator,
Jesus Christ. Amen.

A Prayer for the High Court of Parliament. MOst gracious God, we humbly
beseech thee, as for this kingdom in general, so especially for the High Court
of Parliament, under our most religious and gracious King and Queen at this
time assembled: That thou would be pleased to direct and prosper all their
consultations to the advancement of thy glory, the good of thy Church, the
safety, honor and welfare of their Majesty's and their Kingdoms; that all
things may be so ordered and settled by their endeavors upon the best and
surest foundations, that peace and happiness, truth and justice, religion and
piety may be established among us for all genetations. These and all other
necessaries for them, for us, and thy whole Church, we humbly beg in the Name
and Mediation of Jesus Christ our most blessed Lord and Savior. Amen.

A Prayer for all the Reformed Churches. O God the Father of mercies, who of
thy great goodness have united us into the mystical body of Christ (that is his
Church;) We as living members thereof, mourning with them that mourn, and
rejoicing with them that rejoice, do now present our Supplications and Prayers
at the Throne of Grace, in behalf of all the Reformed Churches; beseeching thee
to look down with an eye of Mercy and Pity upon the sad and mournful estate of
such of them, whom thou have delivered over to the hands of superstitious and
merciless men, who have compelled so many of them to defile themselves with
their Idolatrous Worship; stretch out thy Arm against those deceitful and
bloody men, suffer them not still to triumph over thy Heritage. How long, Lord,
shall thy anger burn for ever! How long will thou forget thy People, that
prays! Oh let the cry of the Blood of thy Saints, and the sighing of the
Prisoners, come before thee! Deliver thou those that are as Sheep appointed for
the slaughter: Hear us, O God, for thy mercies sake, and for the honor of thy
great Name. Plead thy Cause with them that blaspheme thy Truth and prosecute
thy People, that so all men may say, Verily there is a God that judges in the
Earth. Purge all thy Churches from their dregs, and make them meet for a
glorious Deliverance, that so all the world may see the Salvation of our God;
and that though he hides his face from his People for a season, yet he will not
cast them off utterly. Grant that thy true Religion may so shine, as to become
the Joy of the whole earth, and that all Antichristian Idolatry, Superstition,
and Cruelty, being cast out of thy House, all that name the Name of Christ, may
depart from iniquity, and walk worthy of their holy profession, that the
Kingdom of thy dear Son may come quickly; and that all his enemies being made
his footstool, he who is the Lord of lords, and King of kings, may reign to
all the ends of the Earth: To whom, with thee, O Father and the Holy Ghost, be
all honor and glory for evermore. Amen.

O God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ our only Savior, the Prince of
Peace, look down in much Pity and Compassion upon this Church and Nation now
seeking unto thee in Fasting and Prayer; Stir up, we beseech thee, every Soul
among us to cast forth the Accursed Thing, to Root out of our hearts all Pride,
and all Wrath and Bitterness, all unjust Prejudice and causeless Jealousy, all
Hatred and Malice, and desire of Revenge, and whatsoever may hinder us from
discerning the things that belong unto our Peace: And by the power of thy Holy
Spirit do thou dispose all our hearts to such meekness of Wisdom, lowliness of
Mind, Patience, Gentleness, and Long-suffering and forbearance of one another
in love, and such honor and reverence of those whom thou have set over us as
becomes the sons of Peace, that so the God of Peace may be with us. Give us
grace, O Lord, seriously to lay to heart the great Dangers we are in by our
unhappy Divisions, and the great Obligations which lie upon us to godly Union
and Concord, that as there is but one Body and one Spirit, and one hope of our
Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of us all; so we
may henceforth be all of one heart, and of one Soul, United in one holy Bond of
Truth and Peace, of Faith and Charity, and may with one Mind and one Mouth
glorify thee, O Lord, who with thy Father, and Holy Spirit live and reignest
one God world without end Amen.

A Prayer of S. Chrysostom. ALmighty God, who have given us grace at this time
with one accord, to make our common supplications unto thee, and do promise,
that when two or three are gathered together in thy Name, thou will grant their
requests; Fulfill now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of thy servants, as may
be most expedient for them, granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth,
and in the world to come life ever lasting. Amen.

2 Cor. 13.14. THe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen.

FINIS.
