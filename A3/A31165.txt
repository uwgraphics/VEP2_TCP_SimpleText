The CASE of the King and Queen Dowager, by their Atturnies the Lord Privy
Seal, the Earl of Chesterfield, the Lord Chief Baron Mountague, the King and
Queen Dowagers surviving trustes Thomas Air Esquire and George Shaw Gent.
Respondents to the Petition of Thomas Air, William Ing, Henry Balgay Esquires,
and other Appealants.
KING Charles the First of ever blessed Memory, in the Tenth Year of His Reign,
was seized of the Forest of High Peak in the County of Darby, then and before,
plentifully stored with Red Deer, that there were Forresters there, and the
Forest Laws continually put in execution; That the Freeholders and Tenants of
the several Towns within the said Forest; viz. of Bowden, Middle-cale, Chapel
in le Frith, Shalcross, Fairfeild, Fernaly, Castleton, Mellor, Hope, Bradwell,
and Wormhill, finding themselves much aggreived, not only with the Deer by
eating up their Corn and Grass, but also with the Severity of the Laws of the
said Forest, did Petition His said Majesty to destroy the said Forest, and
improve his Wastes and Commons there, which were very large, whereupon the King
was most Graciously pleased to condescend to the destruction of the some, to
which purpose he issued forth his Commission out of His Duchy, to enquire as
well of His as of the Tenants claims within the said Forest, with power to
the Sheriff to Impanual Juries, and likewise Power to swear them to that
purpose, and instructions were annexed to the said Commission, what particulars
should be given in Charge to the Jury; and one Jury did present that the King
might reasonably improve one Moiety of the Wastes within the said Forest, after
which Presentment Mr. Woodroff a Counceller at Law of the Inner Temple, who
lived in Hope aforesaid, and had Land in Hope and Bradwell aforesaid, worth 400
l. per Annum, was entrusted by all the other the said Towns, as well as Hope
and Bradwell, to manage all their Affairs concerning their improving the said
Commons, with the Lord Newburgh then Chancellor of the Duchy; and in the Year
1639 as appears by the said Mr. Woodroffs Letter, the Lord Newburgh directed
Agents should be sent up, to Treat and Agree with his Lordship for the Commons,
which accordingly was done, and all the said Towns sent up their respective
Agents, and the Towns of Hope and Bradwell, did then particularly Employ and
Entrust for the purposes aforesaid, the said Mr. Woodroff, and one Thomas Air
of Shatton, whose Charges were born by the said Towns, and the Town of Wormhill
did send up and entrust one Randell Brock then Servant to Rowland Air Esquire and
one Thomas Herroyd whose Charges were likewise born by that Town, and all the
several Agents for the respective Towns within the said Forest for which they
were entrusted, did Consent and Agree, that His then Majesty should have a
Moiety of their Wastes, at which time the Agents for Bowden, Middle-cale, did
Contract and Agree for the Kings Moiety within them for a Fine and Yearly Rent,
all the said Commons were Surveyed, and most of them divided into Two equal
parts, one for His then Majesty, and the other for the Tenants; before the said
Agents were sent to treat with the then Chancellor for the purpose aforesaid,
and the Agents for the Towns within the said Forest having all Agreed and
Consented that the King should have one Moiety of the Commons, and Bowden
Middle-cale having Contracted for the Kings Moiety within them, His then
Majesty being on His part to destroy the said Forest, accordingly did destroy
the same, and any Person after the first Days Hunting had liberty to kill Deer
there, and the Forresters from the remote parts of the said Forest did fetch
in the Deer into the Campain or the plain part of the Forest that they might
the more easily there be killed and utterly destroyed, and His Majesty having
performed what on His part was to be done, and presently after that the late
horrid Rebellion broke out which put a stop to His then Majesty's Improving or
Farming His Moiety of the said Commons, and the now Appealants ever since that
time do enjoy all the Profits of the said Commons, as well the Kings as their
own part, so that His said late Majesty never received any Profit or
Compensation for the destruction of His Forest, all which proceedings as
aforesaid being transacted at the then Chancellors House, most of the Records
relating to that matter, are either lost or mislaid.

And to prevent all just Accusations of a project or surprise of the Country,
the Relator Air did not make his discovery until His late Majesty King Charles
the Second of ever blessed Memory had happily been restored Fourteen Years, and
then obtained Grants from the Queen Dowager, of the said Moiety belonging to
the Crown, being part of Her said Majesty's Joincture under a Yearly Rent, with
a clause of Determination in the Grant for non-payment of the Rent, and
likewise obtained a Grant of the reversion from His said late Majesty King
Charles the Second, and then the Relator Air, entered upon the same, and the
Freeholders in all as well as in these Towns of Bradwell, Hope, and Wormhill,
did deny the Kings Right, the King having long ago made very great improvements
so that they have not sufficient Common for their Cattle and claimed all to be
their own but the Soil, Whereupon Mr. Attorney General of the Duchy by the
Relation of Thomas Air the said Patente, in the Year 1674 exhibited an
Information, against the Inhabitants of Bowden, Middle-cale, and after a long
Suit upon very good proof of all the matter before recited did obtain a Decree
for the Kings Moiety whithin that Town, In June 79.
and on re-hearing the same Cause the Decree was confirmed, after which the
King and now Queen Dowager by their Attorneys the now Lord Privy Seal, the Earl
of Chesterfeild, the Lord Chief Baron Mountague, the King and Queens surviving
Trustees, the Relator Air, and George Shaw, exhibited another Information
against all the Freeholders in the Towns of Castleton, Mellor, Chapel in le
Frith, Shalcross, Fairfeild, Fernaly, Hope, Bradwell, and Wormhill, which
Information was to the same effect as the former, and after another long and
tedious Suit, upon the very same proofs as in the former Suit obtained a
Decree, In Feb. 82.
which upon a re-hearing was likewise confirmed, and the now Appealants William
Ing, Thomas Air, Henry Balgay, etc. were all served with Privy Seals out of
the Duchy Court but did not appear, but stood in contempt till after the
Decree upon the said last mentioned Information wherein they were named
parties, knowing the Kings evidence, whereby they might prepare crose
Interrogatories thereby to pussel the Kings aged Witnesses, and likewise
counter prove their Testimonies by the help of leading Interrogatories, then
came and prayed that they might be heard. Whereupon a Third Information was
exhibited against them, In June 84.
and after several hearings obtained a Decree for the Kings Moiety within the
Towns of Hope, Bradwel, and Wormhill, which Decree last mentioned upon
re-hearing was confirmed; Thsee Three Towns which now Complain are the best
Land, and did lie in most of the spoil of the Deer, would have all those Towns
as Bowden, Middle-cale, Mellor, Shalcross, which are very Barren and Boggy Land
to be bound by the Agreement, and theirs being the best Land to be unconcerned,
and would after Forty six Years, the Deer being destroyed as aforesaid in
execution of the said Agreement on the Kings part, and the King having
performed His part of the said Agreement, and so improof they endeavor to
compel His Majesty to try this Agreement at Law made Forty six Years since, and
by such Trial upon an improvement design to overthrow the said Decree so
solemnly made in a matter properly examinable and determinable in Equity, in
the said Court of Duchy, being the Kings Court of Revenue as well as a Court
of Equity, having proper Jurisdiction of the said Cause, and having so
deliberately heard and determined the same. And by the King and Queens
Prerogative they may try their Cause in what Court they please, and not be
prescribed to their Court or the manner of their proceeding by the defendant to
their Suit.

These Appellants do allege that they have differenced their Case from the
other Case, and the reason not the same, or an improvement here, there having
been some Hundred years ago, many great improvements made within them, (viz.)
within Hope, and Bradwel, has been improved a great parcel of Ground called
the Woodlands or Croekhill, another piece called Edal. And within Wormhill has
been improved a piece of Land called the Campaign, the over end, and Green
Fairfeild, and so by those improvements they have not Common lest sufficient
for their Commonable Cattle, and so would insinuate that the now improvement
ought to be upon no other ground or reason but upon surplus of Common.

All the Defendants in the Information against the Freeholders of Bowden,
Middle-cale, where the Commons are very Barren, did by their Answers say, That
the Kings and Queens of England, and Dukes of Lancaster, had made so great
Improvements within them that they had not sufficient Common lest, and no
reason for another Improvement now, and did set forth, that diverse great
parcels of Land to a considerable Yearly value were improved (viz.) Chenly or
Maidstone Field, Shellfe, Comes and Twarden.

And all the Defendants to the Information against Chapel in le Frith, Mellar,
Shalcross, Fairfield, Fernaly, Castleton, Hope, Bradwell, Wormhill, did by
their Answers use the same Argument for themselves, and said that the Campaign,
and all the Woodlands, the over end, and Green Fairfield were taken from them,
and so no Surplus of Common nor sufficient lest for their Cattle.

The Defendants to all the said Informations have used the same Argument as
aforesaid, and so overlook the consideration of the Kings destroying His
Forest, as not valuable to them, and their enclosed Lands freed from the
Forest Laws, as not considerable.

All the said Improved Lands were severalties in many parts of the Forest for
to fat the Kings Deer, and no Man claimed or had any Common there, but Cattle
were agested there to feed amongst the Deer, as the Forressers saw occasion.

And (...) in the said severalties are now (...) in Fefarm, (...) of
^^-afforrested (...) Kings Deer hindered from their quiet feeding thereon as
formerly.
