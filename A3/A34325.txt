For now the time was ended,
when she no more Intendid
to lick her lips at men Sir,
and know the sheets in vain Sir,
and lie o'nights alone, and lie o'nights a lone.

He loved her more than plunder;
And showed her many a Scar Sir,
Which he had brought from far Sir,
With fighting for her sake.

But while those three were prating,
The Sailor slyly waiting;
Thought if it came about Sir,
That they should all fall out Sir:
He then might play his part.
And just even as he meant Sir,
T^ Logger-heads they went Sir.
