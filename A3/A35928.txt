Diana's Darling, Or The Modish Courtier.
The fair Diana whom the amorous Swains,
Had strove to vanquish with a deal of pains,
At last by Hylas modish courtship pressed,
Grants him that favor she denied the rest,
By whose Examples future Lovers may,
Learn by what means their Mistress to enjoy.
To an excellent new Tune much in request called Diana's a nymph.
With Allowance.



DIana's a Nymph so chaste and so fair
That Venus her self may not with her compare,
Tho Venus her self she has had the great praise,
The same it is altered and changed now a days,
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame,
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great Name.
Diana's a Nymph so happy and free
There Is none so delightful and pleasant as she,
In beauty excelling the rest of her Sex,
Which she knows in her mind they do daily perplex
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame,
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great Name.
Diana has breasts, Diana has eyes
Would summon the surlist of stoics to rise;
Once seeing her face he would be cinnick no more,
But leave his close Cell and straight fall to adore,
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame,
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great Name.


Diana's soft touch with her delicate hand,
Would make the morosest of Hermits to stand
Amazed to feel what an amorous rage,
Her grasp would infuse into wrinked old age,
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great Name.
A tripple that halts, and never had gone,
In time out of mind from his smoky old home,
Would slight his old pain and his Crutches despise
And father his cure on Diana's bright eyes,
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame,
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great Name.
In Diana when ere she resolves to be kind
Such wraptures of pleasure her Lover may find,
As deny him the leisure to weigh the blessed fate,
Or think there is any such Heaven as that.
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame,
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great Name.


Both Silvia and Juno and Celia appear
Like dowdies deformed when Diana draws near,
Her beams like the Suns in the firmament shine,
They scarce look like Mortals whilst she seems divine
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame.
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great name.
Diana one Morn I saw in a Grove,
And told her in short of my passionate love,
At first with a frown she my Language did hear,
But still I proceeded with pleasure and fear.
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame,
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great name.
I sang it so loud Diana did smile,
And I feasted my soul on her beauties the while
Ah fair one forbear to be cruel said I,
And save you poor Hilas that's going to dye.
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame.
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great name.
The Beauty stood mute whilst I leaned on her breast,
UUhere thrusting my hand somewhat lower I pressed
Ah Diana said I, might I chose the great bliss,
To be found in the World I should think it were this.
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame,
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great name.
She blushed all the while my straggling hand,
Was plunged heart in her bosom^ and then comma(...)
That I the sweet pleasure should that time forbea(...)
Because we beheld a young shepherd draw near.

UUith that we went both to a Neigh'bring shade
UUhich Nature on purpose for Lovers had made,
Where the amorous Trees did so kindly combine,
That naught but Diana's bright beauty could shin(...)
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame,
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great name
I pressed her again to grant the sweet bliss,
she smiled and her heavenly answer was this,
The care longs to you; my dear Hilas to you,
That yo do not a harmless young Uirgin undo.
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame,
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great name
With that in the dark more pleasing then light,
UUe fell to such soft and amazing Delight
That the Gods tho much better they be
In vain did often wish tho to be happy as we.
Then ever hereafter all honor and fame.
Shall be rendered be rendered to Diana's great name
