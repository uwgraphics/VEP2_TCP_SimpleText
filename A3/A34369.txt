A Constant Wife, and a Kind Wife, A Loving Wife, and a Fine Wife, Which
gives content unto man's life.
To the Tune of, Locks and Bolts do hinder.


Young Men and Maids, lend me your aids
to speak of my dear Sweeting
It shows how Fortune has betrayed,
and often spoiled our meetings
She likely was for to be rich;
and I a man but meanly,
Wherefore her friends at me do grutch,
and use me most unkindly.
Her constancy I will declare,
wherein she proved loyal,
But few that will with her compare,
when they are put to trial,
Her friends against her did contend,
because she lent me favor,
They said I quickly all would spend,
if that I might but have her.
They did convey her from my fight,
because she should exempt me,
I could not find my hearts delight,
which sore did discontent me:
I traveled over craggy Rocks,
over Mountains, Hills, and Ualleys;
But she was kept from me with locks,
only through spite and malice.


But Love that conquers Kings and Queens,
here in did shew-us favor,
I brought to pass, and wrought the means,
in what place I could have her:
She had an Uncle did detain,
and kept her her person from me,
Which I had very like to have slain,
because he did so wrong me.
I boldly came where she did dwell;
and asked for my Sweeting,
They said of her they could not tell,
which was to me sad greeting;
But presently she heard my voice,
and called me at her Window,
O I would come to thee my love,
but Doors and Locks do hinder.
Whereat amazed I did stand,
to hear her make that answer,
I drew my sword into my hand,
and straight the House did enter:
And then I made the Locks to fly,
and Doors in pieces shatter,
I vowed to have her company,
and quickly I came at her.
The second Part, to the same tune.
HEr Uncle and some of his Men,
did aster present follow,
Who said I ne`r should out again,
but in my blood should wallow;
But with some hurt done on both sides,
I got my Sweetheart from them:
Young Men to get your selves such brides,
fight for to overcome them.
Then joined we hands, in Hymen's bands,
to love and live together,
She loved me not for House or Lands,
for I had none of either;
Her Love was pure, and does endure,
and so shall mine for ever,
Till death does us so much injure,
to part us from each other.
With hand and heart, I will impart,
the praise of my dear Sweeting,
Now welcome joys, and farewell smart,
blessed be the time of meeting:
With my Sweetheart, and only Dear,
in whom is all my pleasure,
The like of her does not appear,
she is so blessed a creature.
O happy is that time and hour,
that e^r I saw thy feature,
Such heavens bliss on me did shour,
to send me such a Creature;
She is so pleasing to my Eye,
the like was never any,
She Is virtuous, wise, and very kind;
she far surpasses many.
Her comely Feature may compare,
with any in Town or City,
For courtesy she is most rare,
likewise she is full of pity:
No virtue that can give content,
in all that hear her praises,
But God to her the same has lent,
whereby her Glory raises.
Her golden Locks like threads of gold,
her eyes like Stars do glister,
Her Cheeks the Rose and Lilly sold,
she may be Venus Sister:
She has a dimple in her Chin,
her neck shines like the Crystal,
The like has seldom times been seen,
she seems so Celestial.
Her Arms and Shoulders are complete,
her breast like Alablaster,
Her Wast and Middle is so neat,
there is none that can surpass her,
Her Eloquents gives such content
in all that hear her praises,
That freely they`l give their consent,
and yield her Earthly praises.
Her Lilly hands are at command,
to do me any service,
And quickly she will understand,
a matter whatsoever it is:
If I bid go she will not stay,
to work me a displeasure,
But presently she goes away,
and is not this a treasure?
Her parts below i`le not descry,
for they are very neat ones,
A dainty Foot, a Leg, and Thigh,
as can be made of flesh and bones:
She is so perfect in her parts,
that many were enflamed;
On her they wholly set their hearts,
and at her fully aimed.
Thus to conclude and end my Song,
I wish well to the Female,
Or else I should do them much wrong,
and prove my self a tell-tale.
Young Men adieu, prove not untrue,
unto your only Sweeting;
Observe your time, you need not rue,
nor curse the time of meeting.
