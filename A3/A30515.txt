A BALLAD.
I Sing the praise of a worthy Wight,
Whose Father ( -- --) that never would Fight,
For his Face, but more for his A -- made a Knight.
With a fa la la la la la la.
This Knight soon after a Duke became,
And got at the Island Rhee such a Fame,
That all true English Cursed B --:
With, etc.
That Idol Duke to that Greatness did Swell,
That Honors and Riches before him Fell,
Till F -- the Brave sent his Soul to Hell:
With, etc.
And now you shall hear how his Mighty Son,
With that very small Sin of Incest begun,
And then to Treason and Buggery went on:
With, etc.
For the Incest, Old R -- can tell when and where;
For the Treason, the Papers of Old Oliver,
And K -- Arse knows his Buggerer:
With, etc.
Now he who so Bravely and Nobly begins,
Must afterward think when such Glory he wins,
Adultery and Treason but Trivial Sins:
With, etc.
For S -- C -- t lost this Nation more
Brave men than ever were Killed before,
Or shall be hereafter for such a Damned Wh --
With, etc.
More Seed has been Spilt in her Nauseous Womb,
Of all Nations, all Sorts from the Prince to the Groom,
Then Martyrs Blood for the Church of Rome:
With, etc.
Yet he that will after her Beastly Life hunt,
May Swear and Venture his Soul upon it,
She has nothing Catholic but her C -- t:
With, etc.
The Pox upon Pox has Eaten by Bits
His T --, yet so well her purpose it Fits,
That he Fathers the Children Doughty Begets:
With, etc.
And now I have done with that Rampant Whore,
And that Sink her C -- t which is Cannon Bore,
But his Grace F -- ks oftener Behind than Before:
With, etc.
I come to his Farce, which must needs be well done,
For Troy was not longer before it was won,
Since it is more than 10 years since first 'twas begun:
With, etc.
Yet gathering from Plays, Pimps, and Table Chatt,
With the Help of his own Canonical S --,
And his Family Scribe, Antichristian M --:
With, etc.
With Transcribing of that, and Transcribing of those,
With Transmitting of Verse, and Transfusing of Prose,
He has dressed on his Farce with other men's Clothes:
With, etc.
His Abusing the Living, and Robbing the Dead,
His Inserting Fine Things which other men said,
Makes his own way Writing without Tail or Head:
With, etc.
But where the Devil his own Wit does ly,
They must have very good Eyes that can Spy,
Unless in the Dances and Mimikry:
With, etc.
I confess the Dances were very well Writ,
And the Tune and the Time by Haynes as well Hit,
And Littlewood's Motion and Dress had much Wit:
With, etc.
But when his Poet John Bays did appear,
It Is known to more than half that were there,
The greatest part was his own Character:
With, etc.
For he many years Plagued his Friends for their Crimes,
With Repeating his Verses and other men's Rhymes,
To the very same Persons ten thousand Times:
With, etc.
Then his Grace has Tormented the Players more,
Than the Howards and Fleckno, and all the store
Of Damned Dull Rogues they were Plagued with before:
With, etc.
At last Learned B -- though it Fi^,
To tell us the Ancients wanted Wit,
For he easily understood all they had Writ:
With, etc.
But sure he said this in the Heat of his Blood,
For if what the Ancients have Written be Good,
It Is in Languages he never yet Understood:
With, etc.
When in France, and in Spain, and in Holland it is known,
What mighty Wonders our Statesman has done;
'Twill make 'um all Tremble to hear his Renown:
With, etc.
For he that can Libel our Poets, and knows
How to Mimick our Players in Gesture and Clothes,
With ease can Destroy all His Majesty's Foes:
With, etc.
Now the Church he Contemns as much as the Quaker,
The Kingdom he would ruin if the Parliament forsake her,
For he Serves his King as well as his Maker:
With, etc.
For he that Forsook him in all His Distress,
Killed the Husband, and Keeps the Adulteress,
Like Judas, would Sell him, and Sell him for Less:
What, etc.
He has Mimick'd the King and Duke over and over,
That Merciful King who has Pardoned more,
Than all our Kings ever Pardoned before:
With, etc.
That King who if ever Committed a Crime,
Which to Church or State may be Fatal in time,
It was in Extending his Mercy to Him:
With, etc.
Now God grant His Majesty never may find,
It Is Fatal to be to a B -- Kind,
For his Father was ruined by what he Designed:
With a fa la la la la la la.
FINIS.
