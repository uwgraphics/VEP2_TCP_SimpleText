The Kings Majesty's Letter to the Lord Mayor, and Court of Aldermen, of the
City of LONDON, concerning the Choice of Common-Council-men, 1661.
To Our Right Trusty and Well-beloved, the Lord Mayor, and Court of Aldermen,
of Our City of LONDON.
CHARLES REX.

RIGHT Trusty, and well beloved; We greet you well;
Having received signal testimonies of your good Affection to Us and our
Government, so Ancient and Fundamental in this Our Kingdom, whereby the Peace
and Welfare, not only of your selves, but Posterity is most highly concerned,
and calling to mind the many Contrivances, and subtle Insinuations the Enemies
of our and your Peace have formerly set on foot, to seduce our good Subjects,
and thereby cheat them of that Tranquillity which they enjoyed in a wealthy and
flourishing Estate for many years together, under the Reign of our Royal
Grandfather, and Father of ever Glorious Memory; and to the end such horrid
Examples, as of late have been used, the Only sources of those unheard of
Miseries, may not again be put in practice in these our Kingdoms, and
e^pecially in this our Native City (for the good prosperity and preservation
whereof we have, and do use all the care and vigilance we can) We have thought
fit to let you know, we are not ignorant, there are some Active and Turbulent
spirits in that our City, who do not value, as they ought, our many Acts of
Favor and Grace, so lately vouchsafed unto them, which we well hoped might
have reclaimed, and not hardened them in their wickedness; so that at length we
shall be forced to that severer part of Justice which we have hitherto waved:
It were no hard matter for us to paint out those very Wards, and Persons, who
are laboring their own mischief, in contriving the choice of such to be of the
next Common Council, ^s have been too faulty in former Transactions, and are
known Opposers of all Regular Government, ^oth in Church and State. We do
therefore hereby Admonish, Require, and Command you to take special care, and
give strict Order in the general Wards, that a peaceable and quiet Election be
made, and that the Choice be of such Persons, as are every way well affected to
the established Government, both in Church and State; if otherwise, you will
enforce us to an unwilling change of such Elections; and We cannot be blamed,
if We are thus compelled in Matters of this Nature, which We are more than
willing to forbear, and do still hope You will give Us no cause to blame You,
or trouble Our self in that Particular. We have thought fit to give You this
Advertisement, to the end our good Subjects may against that day (which we hear
is not far off) bethink themselves who are the fittest Persons to preserve Our
Peace; and therein We will not omit to let You know we shall esteem it as a
Character of Your loyalty to Us, if not in this alone, but in the Choice of
all other Officers, You appoint such persons as have been Asserters of the Laws
established, or at the least, not Acting Instruments against them, and Our just
Rights, and such You cannot want in that populous City, who are Freemen
thereof.

As to your choice of a Bridge master, We shall not interpose by recommending
any person to You, in that particular, but hoping You will follow the
Directions given, We leave it to Your selves, upon this Confidence, that You
will give us no cause to repent of our former kindness, but rather, to repeat
new ones; which, be assured We have a very great desire, and inclination to, As
occasion shall be offered; and that our directions herein may be the more
effectual, Our pleasure is, that You send transcripts of this our Letters, to
the several Wards of this Our City, not doubting, but by the knowing Our
desires, to prevent the many inconveniences that may happen by ill Elections,
they will readily comply with Our pleasure in this particular, and so we bid
You heartily farewell.

Given at our Court at White Hall, the 13th of December, 1661. And in the 13th.
Year of Our Reign.
