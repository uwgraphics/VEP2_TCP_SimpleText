The Careless Curate and the Bloody Butcher:
In a Narrative of sad News from Chelmsford in Essex, declaring an Execrable
Murder Committed by a Barbarous Butcher, who coming home at midnight, and
finding the Parson of the Parish in bed with his Wife, in a revengeful p^ssion
with his Knife cut off his privy Members, By which he dyed: and the Malefactor
being immediately Apprehended, is Committed to Chelmsford Gaol. A deplorable
Example to dehort all sorts of Men and Women from Adultery and Murder.

To the tune of, Oh women, monstrous women,


BLack Murder and Adultery
Are two such sworn Brothers,
That whosoere their fathers be
Hot passions are their Mothers,
As Will appear in this Narration,
More full of woe and lamentation,
Then ever came into this Nation,
And by report it is true.
From Chelmsford Town in Essex this
Sad Narrative was sent,
I wish 'twere false because there is
A Clergy person in it:
But when the Devil does begin
With fly deceits to draw us in.
Princes and Priests are all but Men
And prone to do amiss.
When p'ety is quite forgot
We fear each Rock and shelf,
This Minister it seems was not
A Curat to himself,
Had he bin so(I must be true l're)
He had not been betrayed by beauty
To lay aside his holy duty,
To run at Butchers Wives
And though from this Adulterous sin
I can no whit exempt her,
She met much disadvantage when
Her Tutor proved her Tempter:
But this is no excuse before
That Judge whom all good men adore
Or plea for playing of the whore
With any man alive.
They say this Parson often ^spyed
This Butchers Wife at Church;
'Twas there that Devil was his guide
Which left him in the lurch:
But that foul fiend is every where
and though ye house of prayer it were
the devil would have his chapel there
Witness the Butchers Wife.
The second part,
to the same tune.


This Parson did solicit her
And she in time old yield,
Women are not like men of war
That stoutly ^eep the field:
One night yt Butcher went from home
Then did this jolly Gamester come
To take some lawless pleasure from
The beau^ious Butchers Wife.
But in the midst of all their sport
The bloody Butcher came
Who seeing them in such a sort
Was strangely out of frame:
He star'd and loo'kd about him then
and thought (when he yt black Coat had seen)
Hugh Peter's had been alive again
And fumbling with his Wife.
The Parson and the Woman to
Began to preach and pray,
But he (as bloody Butchers do)
Is deaf to all they say,
Without regard unto his Coat
He took his rival by the throat,
And with a fury flaming hot
He drew a desperate Knife.
The Butcher kneeled upon his breast,
The woman cried forbear,
But he (with rank revenge possessed)
Cut off his Lady-ware:
He might as well have stabbed his heart;
For after grievous pain and smart,
His soul did from his body part,
This Butcher was a Beast.
The Buther's wife shreek't and cried
Which called the Neigbours in,
And there (in little time) they spyed
Two h^rrid Acts of sin,
And then the Officers were called,
Who to a Justice had him haled,
And now he is (li^e an Ox instal'd)
Shut up in a Chelmsford Gaol.
There he until the Sizes come
Is close confined to lie,
From whence he may expect his doom:
For surely he shall dye,
His wife is full of sorrow fraught,
To think that she (by courses naught)
Has such a sad confusion brought
Upon three Souls at once.
But now it is time I should conclude
This fatal sad report,
I hope there is none will be so rude
To judge the Clergy for it:
They are but Men as well as we,
And subject to infirmity:
God keep us from Adultery,
Malice, Revenge and Blood,
Printed for William Gilbertson.
