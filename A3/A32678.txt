Charles R.

WHereas Complaint has often been made unto Us, That diverse Persons do rudely
press, and with evil Language and Blows force their way into Our Theaters,
(called the Theater Royal in Bridges-street, and the Dukes Theater in
Dorset-Garden) at the time of their Public Representations and Actings,
without paying the Price established at both the said Theaters, to the great
disturbance of Our Servants, Licenced by Our Authority, as well as others, and
to the danger of the Public Peace: Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, and We
do hereby straightly Charge and Command, That no Person of what Quality soever,
do presume to come into either of the said Theaters before and during the time
of Acting, and until the Plays are quite finished, without paying the Price
established for the respective Places. And Our further Command is, That the
Money which shall be so paid by any Persons for their respective Places, shall
not be returned again, after it is once paid, notwithstanding that such Persons
shall go out at any time before or during the Play; And (to avoid future Fraud)
That none hereafter shall enter the Pit, First, or Upper Gallery, without
delivering to the respective Doorkeeper the Ticket or Tickets which they
received for their Money paid at the first Door.

And forasmuch as it is impossible to command those vast Engines (which move the
Scenes and Machines) and to order such a number of Persons as must be employed
in Works of that nature, if any but such as belong thereunto, be suffered to
press in amongst them; Our Will and Command is, That no Person of what Quality
soever, presume to stand or sit on the Stage, or to come within any part of the
Scenes, before the Play begins, while it is Acting, or after it is ended; and We
strictly hereby Command Our Officers and Guard of Soldiers which attend the
respective Theaters, to see this Order exactly observed. And if any Person
whatsoever shall disobey this Our known Pleasure and Command, We shall proceed
against them as Contemners of Our Royal Authority, and Disturbers of the
Public Peace.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Second day of February in the Twenty sixth
Year of Our Reign.
