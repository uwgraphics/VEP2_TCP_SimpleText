His MAJESTY'S Answer to a Book entitled, The Declaration, or Remonstrance of
the Lords and Commons, of the 19 of May.
IF We could be weary of taking any pains for the satisfaction of our people,
and to undeceive them of those specious mischievous Infusions which are daily
instilled into them, to shake and corrupt their loyalty and affection to Us and
Our Government, after so full and ample Declaration of Our Self and Intentions,
and so fair and satisfactory answers to all such matters as have been objected
to Us by a major part present of both Houses of Parliament, We might well give
over this labor of Our Pen, and sit still, till it shall please God so to
enlighten the Affections and Understandings of Our good Subjects on our behalf
(which We doubt not but that in his good time he will do) that they may see Our
sufferings are their sufferings. But, since in stead of applying themselves to
the Method proposed by Us, of making such solid particular Propositions as
might establish a good Understanding between Us, or of following the advice of
Our Council of Scotland (with whom they communicate their affairs) in
forbearing all means that may make the breach wider and wound deeper, they have
chosen to pursue Us with new Reproaches, or rather to continue and improve the
old, by adding and varying little Circumstances and Language, in matters
formerly urged by them, and fully answered by Us, We prevailed with Our Self,
upon very mature and particular consideration of it, to answer the late printed
Book, entitled, A Declaration or Remonstrance of the Lords and Commons, which
was ordered the nineteenth of May last to be printed and published, hoping then
that they would put Us to no more of this trouble, but that that should have
been the last of such a nature they would have communicated to Our people, and
that they would not, as they have done since, thought fit to assault us with a
Newer Declaration, indeed of a very new Nature and Learning, which must have
another Answer. And We doubt not but that Our good Subjects, in short time,
will be so well instructed in the differences, and mistakings between Us, that
they will plainly discern, without resigning their reason and understanding to
Our Prerogative, or the infallibility of a now major part of both Houses of
Parliament (infected by a few malignant spirits) where the fault is.

Though We shall with humility and alacrity be always forward to acknowledge
the infinite Mercy and Providence of Almighty God, vouchsafed so many several
ways to Our Self and this Nation, yet since God himself does not allow, that
We should fancy and create dangers to Our Self, that we might manifest and
publish his Mercy in Our deliverance, We must profess We do not know those
deliverances mentioned in the beginning of that Declaration, from so many
wicked Plots and Designs since the beginning of this Parliament, which, if
they had taken effect, would have brought ruin and destruction upon this
Kingdom. We well know the great labor and skill has been used to amate and
afright Our good Subjects with fears and apprehensions of Plots and
Conspiracies, the several Pamphlets published, and Letters scattered up and
down full of such ridiculous contemptible Animadversions to that purpose, as
(though they found, for what end God knows, very unusual countenance) no sober
man would be moved with them: But We must confess, We have never been able to
inform Our Self of any such pernicious formed design against the Peace of this
Kingdom since the beginning of this Parliament, as is mentioned in that
Declaration, or might be any warrant to those great Fears both Our Houses of
Parliament seemed to be transported with, but we have great cause to believe
more mischief and danger has been raised and begotten to the disturbance of
this Kingdom, then cured or prevented by those Fears and Jealousies: And
therefore however the rumor and discourse of Plots and Conspiracies may have
been necessary to the designs of particular men, they shall do well not to pay
any false devotions to Almighty God, who discerns whether Our dangers are real
or pretended.

For the bringing up of the Army to London, as We have heretofore (by no other
direction then the testimony of a good conscience) called God to witness We
never had, or knew of any such Resolution, so upon the view of the Depositions
now published with that Declaration, it is not evident to Us there was ever
such a Design, unless very loose Discourse or Argument be instance enough of
such a Design: And it is apparent, that what was said of it, was near three
months before the discovery to both Houses of Parliament, so that if there
were any danger threatened that way, it vanished without any resistance or
prevention, by the Wisdom, Power, or Authority of them.

It seems the intention of that Declaration (whatsoever other end it has) is
to Answer a Declaration they received from Us, in Answer to that which was
presented to Us at Newmarket the ninth of March last; and likewise to Our
Answer to the Petition of both Houses, presented to Us at York, the twenty
sixth of March last. But before that Declaration falls upon any particulars of
Our said Declaration or Answer, it complains, That the heads of the Malignant
Party have with much Art and Industry advised Us to suffer diverse unjust
Scandals and Imputations upon the Parliament, to be published in our Name,
whereby they might make it odious to the people, and by their help destroy it:
But not instancing in any one Scandal or Imputation so published by Us, We are
still to seek for the Heads of that Malignant Party. But Our good Subjects
will easily understand, That if We were guilty of that Aspersion, We must not
only be active in raising the Scandal, but passive in the Mischief begotten
by that Scandal, We being an essential part of the Parliament: and We hope
the just defense of Our self, and Our Authority, and the necessary vindication
of Our Innocence and Justice, from the Imputation laid on Us by a major part,
then present of either, or both Houses, shall no more be called a Scandal upon
the Parliament, then the opinion of such a part be reputed an Act of
Parliament: And We hope Our good Subjects will not be long misled by that
common expression in all the Declarations (wherein they usurp the word
Parliament, and apply it to countenance any Resolution or Vote) some few have a
mind to make, by calling it, The Resolution of Parliament, which can never be
without Our consent; Neither can the Vote of either, or both Houses, make a
greater alteration in the Laws of this Kingdom (so solemnly made by the advice
of their Predecessors, with the concurrence of Us and Our Ancestors) either
by commanding or inhibiting any thing (besides the known Rule of the Law) then
Our single Direction or Mandate can do, to which We do not ascribe the
Authority.

But that Declaration informs our People that the Malignant Party has drawn
Us into the Northern parts far from Our Parliament. It might more truly and
properly have said, That it has driven, then drawn Us hither. For We confess,
Our Journey hither (for which We have no other reason to be sorry, then with
reference to the cause of it) was only forced upon Us by the true Malignant
Party which contrived and countenanced those barbarous Tumults and other
seditious Circumstances of which We have so often complained, and hereafter
shall say more, and which indeed threatens so much danger to Our Person, and
laid so much scandal upon the whole Privilege and Dignity of Parliament,
that We wonder it can be mentioned without Blushes or Indignation: But of that
anon. But why the Malignant Party should be charged with causing a Press to be
transported to York, We cannot imagine, neither have any Papers or Writings
issued from thence, to Our knowledge, but what have been extorted from Us by
such provocations, as have not been before offered to a King. And no doubt it
will appear a most trivial and fond Exception, when all Presses are open to
vent whatsoever they think fit to say to the people, (a thing unwarranted by
former custom) that We should not make use of all lawful means to publish Our
just and necessary Answers thereunto. As for the authority of the great Seal
(though We do not know that it has been necessary to things of this nature)
the same shall be more frequently used hereafter, as occasion shall require, to
which We make no doubt the greater and better part of Our Privy Council will
concur, and whose Advice We are resolved to follow, as far as it shall be
agreeable to the good and welfare of the Kingdom.

Before that Declaration vouchsafes to insist on any particulars, it is pleased
to censure both Our Declaration and Answer, to be filled with harsh Censures,
and Causeless Charges upon the Parliament, (still mis-applying the word
Parliament to the Vote of both Houses) concerning which they resolve to give
satisfaction to the Kingdom, since they find it very difficult to satisfy Us.
If, as in the usage of the word Parliament, they have left Us out of their
thoughts; so by the word Kingdom, they intend to exclude all Our people, who
are out of their walls: (for that is grown another Phrase of the Time, the Vote
of the major part of both Houses, and sometimes of one, is now called, The
Resolution of the whole Kingdom) We believe it may not be hard to give
satisfaction to themselves; otherwise We are confident (and Our confidence
proceeds from the uprightness of Our own Conscience) they will never be able
so to sever the affections of Us and Our Kingdom, that what cannot be
satisfaction to the one, shall be to the other. Neither will the Style of
Humble, and Faithful, and telling Us, That they will make Us a Great and
Glorious King, in their Petitions and Remonstrances, so deceive Our good
Subjects, that they will pass over the Reproaches, Threats, and Menaces they
are stuffed with, which sure could not be more gently reprehended by Us, then
by saying, Their expressions were different from the usual Language to
Princes, which that Declaration tells you, We had no occasion to say. But We
believe, whosoever looks over that Declaration presented to Us at Newmarket, to
which Ours was an Answer, will find the Language throughout it, to be so
unusual, that, before this Parliament, it could never be paralleled, whiles
under pretense of justifying their fears, they give so much countenance to the
discourse of the Rebels of Ireland, as if they had a mind Our good Subjects
should give credit to it: Otherwise, being warranted by the same evidence,
which they have since published, they would have as well declared, That those
Rebels publicly threaten the rooting out the name of the English, and that
they will have a King of their own, and no longer be governed by Us, as that
they say, That they do nothing but by Our Authority, and that they call
themselves, The Queens Army. And therefore We have great reason to complain of
the absence of Justice and Integrity in that Declaration; besides the
unfitness of other expressions. Neit her did We mistake the Substance or
Logic of the Message to Us at Theobalds, concerning the Militia, which was no
other, and is stated to be no other (even by that Declaration which reproved
Us) then a plain threat, That if We refused to join with them, they would make
a Law with out Us: nor has the Practice since that time been other which will
never be justified to the most ordinary (if no partial) Understandings, by the
mere averring it to be according to the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom,
without giving any direction, that the most cunning and learned men in the Laws
may be able to find those foundations. And We must appeal to all the World,
Whether they might not with as much Justice, and by as much Law, have seized
upon the estate of every Member of both Houses, who dissented from that
pretended Ordinance (which much the major part of the House of Peers did two or
three several times) as they have invaded that Power of Ours over the Militia,
because We (upon Reasons they have not so much as pretended to answer) refused
to consent to that Proposition: And if no better effects then loss of Time and
Hinderance of the public Affairs have been found by Our Answers and Replies,
let all good men judge by whose default, and whose want of duty such effects
have been: For as Our end (indeed only end) in those Answers and Replies has
been, The settlement and composure of public Affairs, so We are assured, and
most men do believe, That if that due Regard and Reverence had been given to
Our Words, and that Consent and Obedience to Our counsels, which We did expect,
there had been before this time a cheerful Calm upon the face of the whole
Kingdom, every man enjoying his own, with all possible Peace and Security that
can be imagined, which surely those men do not desire, who (after all those
Acts of Justice and Favor passed by Us this Parliament, all those Affronts and
Sufferings endured and undergone by Us) think fit still to reproach Us with
Ship Money, Coat and Conduct-Money, and other things so abundantly declared (as
that Declaration it self confesses) in the general Remonstrance of the State
of the Kingdom, published in November last, which We wonder to find now avowed
to be the Remonstrance of both Houses, and which We are sure was presented to
Us only by the House of Commons, and did never, and We are confident, in that
time, could never have passed the House of Peers; the Concurrence and Authority
of which was not then thought necessary. Shall We believe those Reproaches to be
the voice of the Kingdom of England? That all Our loving Subjects cased,
refreshed, strengthened, and abundantly satisfied with Our Acts of Grace and
Favor toward them, are willing to be involved in these unthankful
expressions: We must appeal to the Thanks and Acknowledgements published in the
Petitions of most of the Counties of England; to the testimony and thanks We
have received from both Houses of Parliament, how seasonable, how agreeable
this usage of Us is to Our merit, or their former expressions.

We have not at all swarved or departed from Our Resolution, or words in the
beginning of this Parliament: We said, We were resolved to put Our Self freely
and clearly upon the Love and Affection of Our English Subjects, and We say so
still, as far as concerns England. And We call Almighty God to witness,
all Our Complaints and Jealousies, which have never been causeless, nor of Our
Houses of Parliament (but of some few Schismatic, Factious, and Ambitious
Spirits, and upon grounds, as short time, We fear, will justify to the world)
Our denial of the Militia, Our absenting Our Self from London, have been the
effects of an upright and faithful Affection to Our English Subjects, that We
may be able (through all the inconveniences We are compelled to wrestle with)
at last to preserve and restore their Religion, Laws, and Liberties unto them.

Since the proceeding against the Lord Kimbolton, and the five Members, is
still looked upon, and so often pressed, as so great an advantage against Us,
that no retractation made by Us, nor no Actions since that time committed
against Us, and the Law of the Land, under pretense of vindication of
Privilege, can satisfy the Contrivers of that Declaration, but that they
would have Our good Subjects believe, The Accusation of those six Members must
be a plot for the breaking the neck of the Parliament, (a strange Arrogance, if
any of those Members had the penning of that Declaration) and that it is so
often urged against Us, as if by that single casual mistake of Ours (in form
only) We had forfeited all Duty, Credit, and Allegiance from Our people: We
must, without endeavoring to excuse that, which in truth was an error (Our
going to the House of Commons) give Our people a clear and full narration of
the matter of fact, assuring Our Self that Our good Subjects will not find Our
carriage in that business such as has been reported.

When We resolved upon such grounds, as when they shall be published will
satisfy the world, That it was fit for Our own Safety, and Honor, and the
Peace of the Kingdom, to proceed against those persons, though We well know
there was no degree of Privilege in that case, yet (to show Our desire of
correspondencie with the two Houses of Parliament) We chose, rather then to
apprehend their persons by the ordinary Ministers of Justice (which, according
to the Opinion and Practice of former times, We might have done) to command Our
Attorney General to acquaint Our House of Peers with Our intention, and the
general matters of Our charge (which was yet more particular then a mere
Accusation) and to proceed accordingly, and at the same time sent a sworn
Servant, a Segeant at Arms to Our House of Commons, to acquaint them, That We
did accuse, and intended to prosecute the five Members of that House for high
Treason, and did require that their persons might be secured in custody: This
We did, not only to show that We intended not to violate or invade their
Privileges, but to use more Ceremony toward them, then We then conceived in
Justice might be required of Us; and expected at least such an Answer as might
inform Us, if We were out of the way; But We received none at all; Only in the
instant, without offering any thing of their Privileges to Our consideration,
an Order was made (and the same night published in Print) That if any person
whatsoever should offer to Arest the person of any Member of that House,
without first acquainting that House therewith, and receiving further Order
from that House, That it should be lawful for such Members, or any person to
assist them, and to stand upon his or their Guard of Defense, and to make
resistance according to the Protestation taken to defend the Privileges of
Parliament: And this was the first time that We heard the Protestation might be
wrested to such a sense; or that in any Case (though of the most undoubted and
unquestionable Privilege) it might be lawful for any Person to resist, and
use violence against a public Minister of Justice, armed with lawful
Authority; though We well knew, that even such a Minister might be punished for
executing such Authority. Upon viewing this order We must confess We were
somewhat amazed, having never seen or heard of the like, though We had known
Members of either House committed without so much Formality as We had used, and
upon Crimes of a far inferior nature to those We had suggested; and having no
course proposed to Us for Our proceeding, We were upon the matter only told,
That against those Persons We were not to proceed at all; That they were above
Our reach, or the reach of the Law, it was not easy for Us to resolve what to
do: If We employed Our Ministers of Justice in the usual way for their
apprehension (who without doubt would not have refused to execute Our lawful
commands) We saw what Resistance and Opposition was like to be made, which very
probably might cost some blood; If We sat still and desisted upon this terror,
We should at the best have confessed Our own want of power, and the weakness
of the Law: In this strait We put on a sudden Resolution, to try whether Our
own presence, and a clear discovery of Our Intentions (which happily might not
have been so well understood) could remove those doubts, and prevent those
Inconveniences which seemed to have been threatened; and thereupon We resolved
to go in Our own Person to Our House of Commons, which We discovered not till
the very minute of Our going, when We sent out, That Our Servants, and such
Gentlemen as were then in Our Court, should attend Us to Westminister; but
giving them express command (as We have expressed in Our Answer to the
Ordinance) that no Accidents or Provocation should draw the^ to any such Action
as might imply a purpose of force in Us, and Our Self (requiring those of Our
Train not to come within the door) went into the House of Commons, the bare
doing of which We did not then conceive would have been thought more a breach
of Privilege, then if We had gone to the House of Peers, and sent for them to
come to Us, which is the usual custom. We used the best expressions We could
to assure them how far We were from any Intention of violating their
Privileges, That We intended to proceed Legally and Speedily against the
persons We had accused, and desired therefore, if they were in the House, that
they might be delivered to Us, or if absent, that such course might be taken
for their forthcoming as might satisfy Our just Demands; and so We departed,
having no other purpose of force, if they had been in the House, then We have
before protested, before God, in Our Answer to the Ordinance. You have an
account of Our part of this Story fully, let Our people judge freely of it:
What followed on their part (though this Declaration tells you, It could not
withdraw any part of their Reverence and Obedience from Us; it may be any part
of theirs it did not) We shall have too much cause hereafter to inform the
world.

There will be no end of the Discourse, and upbraiding Us with evil
Counselors, if upon Our constant denial of knowing any, they will not
vouchsafe to inform Us of them; and after eight Months amusing the Kingdom
with the expectation of a discovery of a Malignant Party, and of evil
Counselors, they will not at last name any, nor describe them: Let the Actions
and Lives of men be examined, who have Contrived, Councelled, Actually
consented to grieve and burden Our people, and if such be about Us, or any
against whom any notorious malicious Crime can be proved; if We shelter and
protect any such, let Our Injustice be published to the world, but till that be
done particularly and manifestly, (for We shall never conclude any man, upon a
bare general Vote of the major part of either, or both Houses, till it be
evident that major part must be without Passion or Affection) We must look upon
the charge this Declaration puts on Us, of cherishing and countenancing a
discontented Party of the Kingdom against them, as a heavier and unjuster tax
upon Our Justice and Honor, then any We have, or can lay upon the Framers of
that Declaration.

And now, to countenance those unhandsome Expressions, whereby usually they
have employed Our connivance at, or want of Zeal against the Rebellion of
Ireland, (so odious to all good men) they have found a new way of exprobration:
That the Proclamation against those bloody Traitors, came not out till the
beginning of January, though that Rebellion broke out in October, and then by
special Command from Us, but forty Copies were appointed to be printed. It Is
well known where We were at that time when that Rebellion brake forth, in
Scotland. That We immediately, from thence, recommended the care of that
business to both Houses of Parliament here, after we had provided for all
fitting supplies from Our Kingdom of Scotland, that after Our return hither We
observed all those Forms for that Service, which We were advised to by Our
Council of Ireland, or both Houses of Parliament here: And if no Proclamation
issued out sooner (of which for the present We are not certain, but think that
others before that time were issued by Our directions) it was, because the
Lords Justices of the Kingdom desired them no sooner; and when they did, the
number they desired was but twenty, which they advised might be signed by Us;
which We, for expedition of the Service commanded to be printed (a circumstance
not required by them) and thereupon We Signed more of them then Our Justices
desired: All which was very well known to some Members of one or both Houses of
Parliament, who have the more to answer, if they forbore to express it at the
passing of this Declaration; and if they did express it, We have the greater
reason to complain, that so envious an Aspersion should be cast on Us to Our
People, when they knew well how to answer their own Objection.

What that Complaint is against the Parliament, put forth in Our Name, which is
such an evidence and countenance to the Rebels, and speaks the same language of
the Parliament, which the Rebels do, We cannot understand. All Our Answers and
Declarations have been, and are owned by Us, and have been attested under Our
own Hand, If any other had been published in Our Name, and without Our
Authority, it would be easy for both Houses of Parliament to discover and
apprehend the Authors: And We wish, that whosoever was trusted with the
Drawing and Penning of that Declaration, had no more Authority or cunning to
impose upon, or deceive a major part of those Votes by which it passed, then
any man has to prevail with Us, to publish in Our Name any thing but the Sense
and Resolution of Our own Heart: Or that the Contriver of that Declaration
could with as good a Conscience call God to witness, that all His Counsels and
Endeavors have been free from all private Aims, Personal Respects, or
Passions whatsoever, as We have done and do, That We never had or knew of such
Resolutions of bringing up the army to London. And since this new device is
found out in stead of Answering Our Reasons, or satisfying Our just Demands, to
blast Our Declarations and Answers, as if they were not our own (a bold
senseless imputation) We are sure that every Answer and Declaration published
by Us, is much more Our own, then any one of those bold, threatening, and
reproachful Petitions and Remonstrances are the Acts of either, or both Houses.
And if the Penner of that Declaration had been careful of the trust reposed in
him, he would never have denied (and thereupon found fault with Our just
Indignation) in the Text or Margent, that We had never been charged with the
intention of any Force, and that in their whole Declaration, there is no word
tending to such a Reproach; The contrary whereof is so evident, that We are in
express terms charged in that Declaration, That We sent them gracious
Messages, when, with Our Privity, bringing up the Army was in agitation. And
even in this Declaration, they seek to make Our people believe some such thing,
to be proved in the Depositions now published, wherein, We doubt not, they will
as much fail, as they do in their Censure of that Petition showed formerly to
Us by Captain Leg, and subscribed by Us with C. R. which notwithstanding Our
full and particular Narration of the substance of that Petition, the
circumstances of Our seeing and approving it, this Declaration is pleased to
say, Was full of scandal to the Parliament, and might have proved dangerous to
the whole Kingdom. If they have this dangerous Petition in their hands, We
have no reason to believe any tenderness to Usward has kept them from
communicating it; If they have it not, We ought to have been believed: But that
all good people may compute their other pretended dangers by their clear
understanding of this, the noise whereof has not been inferior to any of the
rest, We have recovered a true Copy of the very Petition We signed with C. R.
which shall in fit time be published, and which, We hope, will open the eyes of
Our good people.

Concerning Our warrant for Master Jermins passage, Our Answer was true and
full; But for his black Satin Suit, and white Boots, We can give no account.

We complained in Our Declaration, and as often as We have occasion to mention
Our return and residence near London, We shall complain of the barbarous and
seditious Tumults at Westminster and Whitehall, which indeed were so full of
scandal to Our Government, and danger to Our Person, that We shall never think
of Our return thither, till We have Justice for what is past, and security for
the time to come. And if there were so great a necessity, or desire of Our
return as is pretended in all this time upon so often pressing Our Desires, and
upon causes so notorious, We should at least have procured some Order for the
future. But that Declaration tells Us, We are upon the matter mistaken, The
resort of the Citizens to Westminster, was as lawful as the resort of great
numbers every day in the Term to the ordinary Courts of Justice. They knew no
Tumults. Strange! Was the disorderly appearance of so many thousand people with
Staves and Swords crying through the streets, Westminster Hall, the passage
between both Houses (in so much as the Members could hardly pass to and fro)
No Bishops, Down with the Bishops, no Tumults? What Member is there of either
Houses that saw not those numbers, and heard not those cries? And yet lawful
Assemblies: Were not several Members of either House assaulted, threatened, and
ill entreated? And yet no Tumults: Why made the House of Peers a Declaration,
and sent it down to the House of Commons, for the suppressing of Tumults, if
there were no Tumults? And if there were any, why was not such a Declaration
consented to and published: When the attempts were so visible, and the threats
so loud to pull down the Abbey at Westminster, had not We cause to apprehend,
That such people might continue their work to Whitehall? Yet no Tumults. What a
strange time are We in, That a few Impudent, Malicious (to give them no worse
term) men should cast such a strange mist of error before the eyes of both
Houses of Parliament, as that they either cannot, or will not see how
manifestly they injure themselves, by maintaining these visible untruths? We
say no more; By the help of God and the Law, We will have Justice for those
Tumults.

From excepting (how weightily let every man judge) to what We have said, that
Declaration proceeds to censure Us for what we have not said, for the prudent
Omissions in Our Answer: We forbore to say any thing of the words spoken at
Kensington; or the Articles against Our dearest Consort; and of the Accusation
of the six Members: Of the last, We had spoken often; and We thought enough of
the other two: having never accused any (though God knows what truth there
might be in either) We had no reason to give any particular Answer.

We do not reckon Our Self bereaved of any part of Our Prerogative, which We
are pleased freely, for a time, to part with by Bill; yet We must say, We
expressed a great trust in Our two Houses of Parliament, when We divested Our
Self of the Power of dissolving this Parliament, which was a just, necessary,
and Proper Prerogative: But We are glad to hear their Resolution, That it
shall not encourage them to do any thing, which otherwise had not been fit to
have been done: If it do, it will be such a breach of Trust, God will require
an Account for at their hands.

For the Militia, We have said so much in it heretofore, and the point is so
well understood by all men, that We will waste time no more in that dispute. We
never said, There was no such thing as an Ordinance (though We know that they
have been long dis-used) but that there was never any Ordinance, or can be
without the Kings consent; and that is true: and the unnecessary President
cited in the Declaration, does not offer to prove the contrary: But enough of
that; God and the Law must determine that business.

Neither has this Declaration given Us any satisfaction, concerning the Votes
of the fifteenth and sixteenth of March last, which We must declare, and appeal
to all the world in the point, to be the greatest violation of Our Privilege,
the Law of the Land, the Liberty of the Subject, and the Right of Parliament
that can be imagined. One of those Votes is (and there needs no other to
destroy the King and People) That when the Lords and Commons ('it is well the
Commons are admitted to their part in Judicature) shall declare what the Law of
the Land is, the same must be assented to, and obeyed; that is the sense in few
words. Where is every man's Property, every man's Liberty? If a major part of
both Houses declare that the Law is, that the younger Brother shall inherit,
what is become of all the Families and Estates in the Kingdom? If they declare,
That by the Fundamental Law of the Land, such a rash Action, such an unadvised
Word ought to be punished by perpetual Imprisonment, is not the Liberty of
the Subject, Durante beneplacito, remediless? That Declaration confesses,
They pretend not to a Power of making new Laws, That without Us, they cannot do
that: They need no such Power, if their Declaration can suspend this Statute
from being obeyed or executed, and make this Order, which is no Statute, to be
obeyed and executed. If they have Power to declare the Lord Digbyes waiting on
Us to Hampton Court, and thence visiting some Officers at Kingston, with a
Coach and six Horses, to be levying of War, and High Treason: And Sir John
Hothams defying Us to Our face, keeping our Town, Fort, and Goods against Us,
by force of Arms, to be an Act of Affection and Loyalty, What needs a Power of
making new Laws? Or is there such a thing as Law left? We desire Our good
Subjects to mark the Reason and Consequence of these Votes, the progress they
have already made, and how infinite that progress may be. First, they Vote the
Kingdom is in imminent danger (it is above three months since they discerned
it) from Enemies abroad, and a Popish and Discontented Party at home; That is
matter of Fact; the Law follows: This Vote has given them Authority by Law
(the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom) to order and dispose of the Militia of
the Kingdom, and with this power, and to prevent that danger, to enter into
Our Towns, seize upon Our Magazine, and by force, keep both from Us: Is not
this Our case? First, they Vote We have an intention to levy war against our
Parliament; that is matter of Fact: Then they declare, Such as shall assist Us,
to be guilty of High Treason; that is the Law, and proved by two Statutes,
themselves know to be repealed: No matter for that; They declare it. Upon this
ground they exercise the Militia, and so actually do that upon Us, which they
have voted We intend to do upon them: Who does not see the confusion that must
follow upon such a power of declaring? If they should now vote, That we did not
write this Declaration, but that such a one did it, which is still matter of
fact; and then declare, That for so doing, he is an Enemy to the Commonwealth;
what is become of the Law that man was born to? And if all their Zeal for the
defense of the Law, be but to defend that which they declare to be Law, their
own Votes, it will not be in their power to satisfy any man of their good
intentions to the public Peace, but such who are willing to relinquish his
title to Magna Charta, and hold his life and fortune by a Vote of a major part
of both Houses: In a word, We deny not but they may have a power to declare in
a particular doubtful cafe regularly brought before them, what Law is; but to
make a general Declaration, whereby the known Rule of the Law may be crossed
or altered, they have no power, nor can exercise any, without bringing the Life
and Liberty of the Subject to a lawless and arbitrary subjection.

We complained (and let the world judge the Justice and necessity of that
Complaint) of the multitude of Seditious Pamphlets and Sermons. And that
Declaration tells Us, They know We have ways enough in Our ordinary Courts of
Justice to punish those: So we have to punish Tumults and Riots, and yet they
will not serve Our turn to keep Our Towns, Our Forests, and Parks from
violence. And it may be, though those Courts have still the power to punish,
they may have lost the skill to define what Riots and Tumults are; otherwise a
Jury in Southwark, legally impanelled to examine a Riot there, would not have
been Superseded, and the Sheriff enjoined not to proceed, by virtue of an Order
of the House of Commons; which, it seems at that time, had the sole power of
declaring. But it is no wonder, That they who could not see the Tumults, do not
consider the Pamphlets and Sermons, though the Author of the Protestation
protested, be well known to be Burton (that infamous Disturber of the peace of
this Church and State) and that he preached it at Westminster, in the hearing
of diverse Members of the House of Commons: But of such Pamphlets, and seditious
Preachers (diverse whereof have been recommended, if not imposed upon several
Parishes, by some Members of both Houses, by What Authority We know not) We
shall hereafter take a further account.

We confess, We have little skill in the Laws, and those that have had most,
We now find are much to seek: Yet We cannot understand or believe, That every
ordinary Court, or any Court, has power to raise what Guard they please, and
under what Command they please; Neither can We imagine what dangerous effects
they found by the Guard We appointed them, or (indeed) any the least occasion
why they needed a Guard at all.

But of all the Imputations so causelessly and unjustly laid upon Us by that
Declaration, We must wonder at that charge so apparently and evidently untrue,
That such are continually preferred and countenanced by Us, who are Friends or
Favorers, or related unto the chief Authors and Actours of that Arbitrary
power heretofore practiced and complained of: And on the other side, That such
as did appear against it, are daily discountenanced and disgraced. We would
know one Person that contributed to the Ills of those Times, or had dependence
upon those that did, whom We do, or lately have countenanced or preferred; Nay,
We are confident (and We look for no other at their hands) as they have been
always most eminent Assertours of the public liberties, so if they found Us
inclined to any thing not agreeable to Honor and Justice, they would leave Us
to morrow: Whether different Persons have not, and do not receive countenance
elsewhere, and upon what grounds, let all men judge; and whether We have not
been forward enough to honor and prefer those of the most contrary opinion,
how little comfort soever We have had of those preferments; in bestowing of
which, hereafter We shall be more guided by men's Actions then Opinions: And
therefore We had good cause to bestow that Admonition (for We assure you it was
an Admonition of Our own) upon both Our Houses of Parliament, to take heed of
inclining, under the specious shows of Necessity and Danger, to the exercise of
such an Arbitrary power they before complained of: The Advice will do no harm,
and We shall be glad to see it followed:

And are all the specious Promises, and loud Professions, Of making Us a Great
and Glorious King, Of settling a greater Revenue upon Us, then any of Our
Ancestors have enjoyed, Of making Us to be Honored at home, and Feared
abroad, resolved into this, That they will be ready to settle Our Revenue, in
an Honorable Proportion, when We shall put Our Self in such a Posture of
Government that Our Subjects may be secure to enjoy Our just Protection for
their Religion, Laws, and Liberties? What Posture of Government they intend We
know not, nor can We imagine what Security Our good Subjects can desire for
their Religion, Laws, and Liberties, which We have not offered, or fully given.
And is it suitable to the duty and dignity of both Houses of Parliament to
Answer Our particular weighty expressions of the Causes of Our remove from
London (so generally known to the Kingdom) with a Scoff, That they hope We
were driven from thence, not by Our own Fears, but by the Fears of the Lord
Digby, and his Retinue of Cavaliers? Sure the Penner of that Declaration
inserted that ungrave and insolent Expression (as he has done diverse others)
without the consent or examination of both Houses; who would not so lightly
have departed from their former professions of duty to Us.

Whether the way to a good Understanding between Us and Our people has been as
zealously pressed by them, as it has been professed and desired by Us, will be
easily discerned by those who observe, that We have left no public Act undone
on Our part, which, in the least degree, might be necessary to the Peace,
Plenty, and Security of Our Subjects, and that they have not dispatched one Act
which has given the least evidence of their particular Affection and Kindness
to Us: But on the contrary, have discountenanced and hindered the testimony
other men would give to Us of their affections: Witness the stopping and
keeping back the Bill of Subsidies granted by the Clergy, almost a year
since, which though Our personal wants are so notoriously known, they will
not, to this time, pass: So not only forbearing to supply Us themselves, but
keeping the Love and Bounty of other men from Us, and afford no other Answers
to all Our Desires, all Our Reasons (indeed not to be answered) then, That We
must not make Our Understanding or Reason the Rule of Our government, but
suffer Our Self to be assisted (which We never denied) by Our great Council.
We require no other Liberty to Our will, then the meanest of them do (We wish
they would always use that Liberty) not to consent to any thing evidently
contrary to Our Conscience and Understanding: and We have and shall always
give as much estimation and regard to the Advice and Counsel of both Our
Houses of Parliament, as ever Prince has done: But We shall never (and We hope
Our people will never) account the contrivance of a few (Factious, Seditious
persons, a Malignant Party, who would sacrifice the Commonwealth to their own
fury and ambition) the wisdom of Parliament; and that the justifying and
defending such persons (of whom, and of their particular sinister ways to
compass their own bad ends, We shall shortly inform the world) is not the way
to preserve Parliaments, but is the opposing and preferring the consideration
of a few unworthy persons, before their Duty to their King, or their care of
the Kingdom. They would have Us remember that Our Resolutions do concern
Kingdoms, and therefore not to be molded by Our own Understanding: We well
remember it; But we would have them remember, That when their Consultations
endeavor to lessen the Office and Dignity of a King, they meddle with that
which is not within their determination, and of which We must give an account
to God and Our other Kingdoms, and must maintain with the sacrifice of Our
life.

Lastly, that Declaration tells you of a present desperate and malicious Plot,
the Malignant Party is now acting, under the plausible Notions of stirring men
up to a care of preserving the Kings Prerogative, maintaining the Discipline of
the Church, upholding and continuing the Reverence and Solemnity of Gods
Service, and encouraging Learning, (indeed plausible and honorable Notions to
act any thing upon) and that upon these grounds diverse mutinous Petitions have
been framed in London, Kent, and other Places. Upon what Grounds would these
men have Petitions framed? Have so many Petitions (even against the Form and
Constitution of the Kingdom, and the Laws established) been joyfully received
and accepted? And shall Petitions framed upon these Grounds be called Mutinous?
Has a multitude of mean, unknown, inconsiderable, contemptible Persons about
the City and Suburbs of London, had liberty to Petition against the
Government of the Church, against the Book of Common Prayer, against the
Freedom and Privilege of Parliament, and been thanked for it: And shall it be
called Mutiny in the gravest and best Citizens of London, in the Gentry and
Commonaltie of Kent, to frame Petitions upon these grounds; and to desire to be
governed by the known Laws of the Land, not by Orders and Votes of either, or
both Houses? Can this be thought the Wisdom and Justice of both Houses of
Parliament? Is it not evidently the work of a Faction within or without both
Houses, who deceive the Trust reposed in them, and have now told Us what
Mutiny is, to stir Men up to a Care of preserving Our Prerogative,
maintaining the Discipline of the Church, upholding and continuing the
Reverence and Solemnity of Gods Service, encouraging of Learning, is Mutiny?
Let Heaven and Earth, God and Man, judge between Us and these Men: And however
such Petitions are, there, called Mutinous, and the Petitioners Threatened,
Discountenanced, Censured, and Imprisoned: If they bring such lawful Petitions
to us, We will graciously receive them, and defend them and their Rights
against what power soever, with the uttermost hazard of Our being.

We have been the longer (to Our very great pain) in this Answer, that We might
give the World satisfaction, even in the most trivial Particulars which have
been objected against Us; and that we may not be again reproched with any more
prudent Omissions. If We have been compelled to sharper Language then we
affect, let it be considered, how vile, how insufferable Our Provocations have
been; And except to repel Force be to assault, and to give punctual and
necessary Answers to rough and insolent Demands, be to make invectives, We are
confident the world will accuse Us of too much Mildness; and all Our good
Subjects will think, We are not well dealt with, and will judge of Us, and of
their own happiness and security in Us by our Actions; which We desire may no
longer prosper, or have a blessing from God upon them and Us, then they shall
be directed to the glory of God, in the maintenance of the true Protestant
Profession, to the preservation of the Property, and the Liberty of the
Subject, in the observation of the Laws, and to the maintenance of the Rights
and Freedom of Parliament, in the allowance and protection of all their just
Privileges.

FINIS.
