A Pindaric ODE, Sacred to the MEMORY OF The Most Reverend Father in GOD, DR.
William Sancroft, etc.
Strophe I.
ONce more Vouchsafe, Indulgent Muse,
TO inflame my suppliant Breast with sacred Fire;
Since now a Task I choose,
The Noblest and the Ablest to Inspire,
The Saddest, yet the Worthiest, Theme,
That e're engaged our Eyes in Tears to flow,
Or e're required a full Castalian Stream,
To bear the Solemn Pomp of Numerous Woe.
Much Grief enchas'd with Joy is to be set,
An Ivory Triumph in Dispairing Jet;
Sadness and Pleasure here must Play their Part,
With mighty Truths Adorned with Wondrous Art.
Antistrophe I.
It Is SANCROFT's Venerable Name,
Great CANTERBURY's Greater Patriarch,
The Nation's Pride and Shame,
That now becomes the Muse's worthy Mark,
Thou, Goddess, though the Mark be high,
And far beyond a Mortal's humble Ken,
Be sure to Reach it with a Daring Eye,
And lively Touches of a Skilful Pen.
And that Success may favor Thee the more,
Invoke that Goodness, SANCROFT did adore:
Call to thine Aid those High Celestial Powers,
That now have Crowned Him theirs, who late was Ours.
Epod. I.
Ah! How the Numbers of his Virtues rise!
Ah! How his Splendors Dazzle Mortal Eyes!
Ah! How his Rays Engagingly Surprise!
What Art shall now the various Scenes relate?
How shall our Zeal the God-like Hero trace,
From Fresingfield, his Native Place,
Through all the Turns of his Maeandrous Fate?
EMMANUEL First the hopeful Scholar took,
And Smiled on Him with her Auspicious Look;
She Saw her Image in his Eye expressed,
And at first View,
The Mighty, Flowing Treasures knew,
The Wealth of his All-comprehending Breast.
There fixed in her bright Zodiac long he shone,
Of Twelve the brightest Constellation:
Till high advanced to the Phoebean Carr,
His Beams appeared more Bright and Darted far.
Him Fair EMMANUEL did Create
Her Master, (as the World miscals the Name,)
Though He took on Him but a Servile State,
The Grandeur all to his Emmanuel Came:
He would be Less, that She might rise more Great.
Thence Paul received his Venerable Head,
And He relieved the much Distressed Paul:
His Tent He near the blessed Apostle Spread,
And Built, and was Himself to Him, a Wall.
Till, Sheldon falling from the sacred Throne,
To Canterbury's brighter Orb he rose:
Wise Charles durst on his Shoulders strong alone
The mighty Bulk of that Vast Globe repose.
Strophe II.
But now what Tongue, what Pen, what Art,
Can half the Sum of his High Praises tell?
The Depth of his Wise Heart,
Religion's spring, Learning's unfathomed Well?
The Treasures of his Wealthy Mind,
The Magazines of his well furnished Brain,
His Love Diffusive, Favor unconfined,
Sense Quick, as Lightning, Candor Sweet as Rain?
Judgment, as piercing, as the Eye of Day;
Patience, amidst injurious Treatments Gay,
Humility, like Corn in fertile Vales,
And well-fix'd Loyalty, which never fails?
Antistrophe. II.
Witness, Blessed Lambeth, lately Blessed,
When SANCROFT's Presence cheered Her gladsom Heart:
Witness, his Constant Guest,
The Poor, which never from Him did Empty part.
Witness the Church, his only Wife,
His Friend, his Darling, Dear as Light or Breath:
That held her Triumph's equal with his Life,
But Lost Her Crown and Comfort at his Death.
Witness those Ears, that heard his Wondrous Sense,
And those his Works; that now fresh Life Commence.
Witness these Times, that could not shake his Soul,
And Future Times, that will his Fame Enroul.
Epod. II.
Muse Change thy Note! This Glorious Orb of Light
Is now Eclipsed, and all his Splendors Bright,
Sunk in the Abyss of Everlasting Night.
EMMANUEL weeps, and Fresingfield is sad,
The Church is Widowed, Destitute the State,
Lambeth Deplores her Rigid Fate,
And Learning is in Weeds of Sable clad:
Our Israel is Deprived of her Defense,
Her Horse and Chariots now are Ravished hence,
And Loyalty and Virtue hence are Fled:
Religion's Name
Remains, but She Is no more the same:
See, how, alas! She hangs her drooping Head.
Farewell, Great Prelate, Last and Best of all,
That e're were vested with the Sacred Pall:
Prince of our Confessors Triumphant Crew,
Pride of the Crown and of the Mitre too:
Thee, SANCROFT, Heaven has now enrol'd,
Secure, and far removed from Mortal Cares,
Crowned and Rewarded now Thousand Fold,
For all thy Faith, thy Patience, Love and Prayers,
And Stately Walking on Ethereal Mold.
We, wretched Souls, low groveling on the Ground,
Deprived of thy Paternal, Past'ral Care,
TO unequal Times and Chains of Error Bound,
Will yet ende'vour our Losses to Repair.
Still on thy Bright Example We will look,
And Learn from thence Things Present to Despise,
And Study Heaven in thy Diviner Book,
Which does the Counterpart of Heaven Comprize.

His EPITAPH.
a SAY, Virgins, what are You, whose Mournful Face
Augments the Sadness of this Burial Place?
b Our Name's Religion, Learning, Charity,
Virtue, an Humble Mind and Loyalty.
a Who then Lies here? b Sancroft the Good and Wise.
a Alas! All Worth with Him Entombed lies.
FINIS.
