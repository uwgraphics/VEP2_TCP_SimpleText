SOME False Principles AND ERRORS DISCOVERED AND REFUTED: In a short Answer to
a Catechism book, which is said to contain, The Principles of Religion, put
forth by a namelesse Author; But is supposed to be the work of one Samuel
Eaton, a professed Minister of the Gospel, among the Sect of the Independants,
in Cheshire. But upon true examination he is found to be teaching the
traditions of men for the commandments of Christ; and his Principles are
proved to to be not according, but contrary to the Spirit of God and the
Scriptures.

TO THE READER.
THE Reason and Cause of this being sent abroad is for the better Information
of all, but more particularly for the good of that Assembly, to whom Samuel
Eaton is Minister and Pastor, that they may know the truth from error, and the
way of Righteousness from all false ways, and may turn from Idol-shepherds
that destroys the vineyard, and treads it down, and may come to Christ, and
receive him who is the chief shepherd, to feed his flock with the bread of
eternal life.

And the reason why these false principles are charged upon Samuel Eaton is
this, it being doubtful to some who was the Author of that Catechism, wherein
these principles and doctrines was held forth: John Gredley and Anne Sheeld by
name was with the said Samuel Eaton, and asked him if he owned that book (the
Catechism) and he said he would maintain all in it; that was his answer.

THe ways of the Lord are equal and just, but the ways of the Sons of Adam
are altogether corrupted, and different and contrary to the ways of Salvation;
And the wisdom that is of this world is foolishness with God, and its end is
destruction to it self, and to all that walk therein; And what is man, that he
shall prescribe a way to his Maker? and who is it, that will be more wise then
God, to set him a way how he must teach his people? Therefore in vain have men
labored, and have reaped to themselves nothing but wind and confusion; And in
vain have they sown, for others to reap after them, whose fruit has been
emptiness, and not filled the hand of the gatherer; And in particular this book
with which I am now dealing, is the fruit of an empty Tree, which cannot
satisfy the hungry soul, nor comfort the weary seeker; for the satisfaction
and comfort of the seeking hungry soul depends only upon the Lord, and upon
the bread of life that comes down from God; and the soul that eats thereof is
satisfied and comforted for ever, and hungers no more, nor thirsts any longer;
but the fountain is in him, and the well springs up unto eternal life, and he
goes no more forth: And if so be that all herein were true and sound Doctrine,
and were learned, so as to express it over again in words this might be, and
yet the soul still remaining in anguish, and under sin and death, though
increased in the knowledge that is from below, and yet in a farther ignorance of
God; for the wisdom of this world knows not God, neither can it teach, nor
receive the knowledge of the things that pertaines unto life eternal, but to
the simple and to fools does the Lord teach and reveal the knowledge of his
kingdom, and it is not received from books, nor the teachings and traditions of
men, but by the manifestation of the eternal spirit which does lead into all
truth, and reveal the mysteries of Salvation.

The first thing that I take notice of is this, thou say, God is a Spirit,
and he is one in ^eing, and is to be distinguished into three persons, and the
Father, Son, and holy Ghost are personal relations; and if one be a person
such are the other, etc.

Ans. The Father, Son, and Spirit is one, this we believe and know, according
to the Scriptures; but as for thy word person, that is carnal and too low a
word to denominate God by, who is infinite; for God and the spirit has no
person, nor cannot truly be distinguished into persons; for a person has
relation to place, time, and change, and is not in all places at all times at
once, and the Scriptures knows no such distinction, for God is is a spirit,
and has no relation to one time, place or alteration more then another, but
fills heaven and earth, and his presence is in all, and over all, who is
blessed for ever, and is infinite, and without person, or confined being, and
the Scripture no where in true translation, does denominate God, Christ and the
spirit by persons, and personal beings, nor does distinguish them into three
persons; for persons are related to carnal, as I have said, and persons is to
low, too denominate God and Christ and the spirit by: so thy principles are
unsound, and not agreeing to the spirit of God, and the Scriptures, And
therefore not to be believed nor received.

Whereas thou say, That the one standing rule, according to which God is to
be sought, worshipped and served, is the holy Scriptures, in which God has
revealed himself in all things which he would have believed and done, etc.

Ans. It is the spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures, which spirit was
and is within the saints that leads into all truth, and teaches to know all
things, and that spirit of God only is the standing rule to walk in, and to
walk by; it was the rule to Abel, Enoch, Abraham, and the rest of the holy
Fathers that lived before any scripture was written, and it was the rule to the
Prophets, to Christ and to the holy Apostles, they all followed the spirit and
walked in it, and spoke and wrought and acted as the spirit of God within them
moved them, and led them, it was not the Scriptures, but the sprit that gave
forth the Scriptures that was the standing, unchangable, unerring rule of
worshipping serving and obeying the Lord God, and that same spirit is the
standing rule to us also; for the Apostle commands to walk in the spirit, and
that which we are to walk in is our rule, and as many as are the sonns of God
are led by the spirit of God, and then the spirit is their rule, and that
guides the feet in the way of peace, and in the spirit is God worshipped, for
they that worship him must worship him in the spirit and in the truth, and such
he seeks to worship him, for it is in the hearts of his people, and within them
that God reveals himself by his spirit, for it is the spirit that reveals
the things of God, and none knows the things of God, saving by the spirit of
God, and that reveals God, and teaches to worship God and to serve him, and
the Scriptures they declare of the rule, and of the revelation of God, and are
a declaration of all things which is to be believed and practiced by the
children of the Lord; so that the Scriptures are not the standing rule, neither
does it teach to worship and serve God, but the spirit that gave forth the
Scriptures, that is the standing rule in and through all generations, and the
spirit does reveal the knowledge of God, and how he is to be worshipped and
served.

And thou say, the Scriptures are the word of God, given by imediate
inspiration of God, and that they are given to all men to be read, and the
Scriptures are sufficient to make the man of God perfect and thoroughly
furnished, and are able to make wise unto Salvation; and the Scriptures and
plain and easy to be understood by the simplest, and there is milk in them for
babes, and strong meat for persons grown up.

Ans. Christ is the word of God, and his name is called the word of God, and
the word of God was in the beginning and shall endure for ever; and this word
is not the Scriptures, and the Scriptures are not the word, but the Scriptures
are words of God, given forth from the Word which was in their hearts that
spoke forth the Scriptures, which were wro^ as the holy men of God were moved
by the holy Ghost, and given by the inspiration of the spirit of God, and the
Scriptures are a declaration, and a treatise of the Word that was in the
beginning, and shall endure for ever; but the Scriptures are not the word, and
some of them were given to one sort of men, and some of them to another, and
some of them to all; but as for the threatenings and Judgments pronounced, and
the reproof of the wicked, that part was not given to the Saints nor spoken to
them, and so not given to all, and the promises to the children of the Lord,
and the Epistles to the Saints, and them that were sanctified, that part was
not given and spoken to the world and to the wicked who are unconverted, and so
not spoken to all, though all may read them, yet none can understand them but
by the same spirit as gave them forth, and who has not the same spirit to
guide them, they cannot understand the Scriptures, for it was given forth by
the eternal spirit, and the carnal wisdom that is from below, and sensual,
cannot understand nor receive the things of the kingdom of God, which is
declared of in the Scriptures, and so the Scriptures are not easy to be
understood, but are sealed from the world, neither are the Scriptures without
faith (which thou have left out) sufficient to make the man of God perfect, but
the Scriptures through faith, is able to make the man of God perfect, and
thoroughly Furnished, this we know and believe, and does set the Scriptures in
its right place, and give it its right honor and respect; and as for thee and
thy generation who are erred from the spirit of truth, you know not the
Scriptures nor the power of God, for Christ is the bread of life, and the water
of life, in him is the milk for babes, and meat for strong men, and not in the
Scriptures who testify of Christ the life, and in them the Pharisees thought
to have eternal life, but would not come to Christ the end of the Scriptures
that they might have life, and this is the self same state with yours of this
age, who thinks to have the perfecting of Salvation and the milk for babes, and
the meat for strong men in the Scriptures, but will not receive Christ who is
the perfect Salvation and the bread and water of life for all the children of
the Lord who are born of the spirit; and so thy Doctrines, and thy principles
of thy Religion, are not sound nor agreeing with the Scriptures but contray,
and by a contrary spirit, and therefore we cannot be of thy mind, but does
truly Judge thee to be unlearned of the Father, and knows not the way of
Salvation, and so thou cannot truly inform nor direct others.

And thou say, men are under a necessity of multiplying transgression* etc.
Romans 3. 12. Ephesians. 4. 17. 2 Pet. 2 4.

Answ. In this thou have erred, and spoken contrary to sound doctrine; for
there is no necessity laid upon any to commit any sin, much less a necessity
of multiplying transgression; if there be a necessity, who lays it on men, and
why is that necessity? transgression is of the wicked one, and who sins is of
the Devil, and there is no necessity for that upon any account, because sin
destroys the soul, and is a vexation to the Lord God, and a cause of
everlasting misery, and for to act that, there is no necessity, which has
these effects, and thou have perverted the Scriptures quoted by thee, to prove
thy false assertion which I have set down for the Reader to peruse, that all
may see thou have perverted them, for they prove no such Doctrine, as that
there is a necessity of multiplying transgression, which thou have affirmed and
brought the Scriptures to prove it, which is first false doctrine uttered by
three, and also a perverting of the Scriptures to maintain it, and this is too
evils, which thou have committed in one work, and because thou have done evil,
it shall lie at thy door, and there I will leave it.

And thou say, to be Iu^^^fied is not to be really cleansed from all sin, nor
is it to partake of real righteousness and holiness, but it is to be accounted
and reputed Just and holy, and not to have sin reckoned, etc.

Ans. There is none Justified but who are in Christ, and are changed, and
renewed and born again, and such are cleansed from sin, for he that is born of
God sins not, and it is he only that is Justified, and not the old man that
is unchanged, and commits sin, he is not Justified; and who is born of God
and are Justified, are really cleansed and really does partake of righteousness
and holiness, even of the righteousness and holiness of the Son of God, and in
that righteousness he is accounted righteous, and in no other, nor by no other
way then by receiving Christ and his righteousness, and being made partakers of
it in their hearts, for the Apostle said, if Christ be not in you, you are
reprobates, and such are not Justified, nor accounted just and holy who have
not Christ within them, and his righteosness, but who has Christ within, the
hope of glory, and are accounted just and righteous in the sight of God, the
body of sin is put off; for if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of
sin, and such are really cleansed, and if he be in you, you are made partakers
of real righteousness and holiness, and this is the truth of the Gospel of
Christ which confounds and condemns thy false Doctrine, for no man is
accounted and reputed just and holy, but who are cleansed from sin, and are in
Christ's; for who does commit sin are unholy, and so reputed of God, and sin is
reckoned to them, and this all will find in the day of the Lord, when he comes
to Judge righteously, and to give every man according to his works, and not
according to what he may make a show of and profess in words, though all you
false daubers with untempered mortar, heal up the hurt of the Daughter of Sion
deceitfully, and cry peace, peace, by a false applying the Promises and words
of Christ, when God speaks no peace, and even you and your false daubed wall
will be Whirlwind of the Lord beat down and destroy utterly; and this I
assert contrary to thy false doctrine and principles, that none are Justified,
but who has Christ in them, and really partakes of holiness and righteousness,
and are really cleansed from sin, and are born of the spirit of God, and is
heir of the promise of eternal life.

And further thou say Justification admits not of any degree* and if a
person be Justified from any one sin, he is Justified from all sin, as well
from sins to be committed, as those that are already committed, and who is once
a Justified person, is not unjustified upon new sin committed, etc.

Ans. Grace and faith, and truth, and Christ himself admits of degrees, or
measures which are one, and there are several measures of life, of light, of
grace and faith, of sanctification, and of Justification also; for according as
every man, has received Christ so has he received Sanctification, and
Justification, and no otherwise, for Christ is made wisdom, and
Sanctification, and Salvation, and every one feels his Sanctification, and his
Justification, according to the measure of the gift of Christ given to him, so
that there are several measures of Justification, and also a man may be
Justified from one sin, or some sin, and not from all sin; for according to
every man's Sanctification, so is the witness of his Justification to him, and
no more; and if thou know any thing by experience thou know this, and no
man is Justified from the evil which he is to commit, for that faith gives
license to sin, if any committing sin, shall believe that that sin is long
since forgiven, and he is Justified from it, and if he shall believe he is
Justified, though he commit sin, even long before he commits his sin, this will
be a cause to run into sin, and is a gap opened by thee, unto all
unrighteousness; Why, if people can believe they are justified from the sins
which they have yet to commit, what should restrain them from running with
pleasure into all unrighteousness? and if new sins always committed, do not
make persons unjustified, then may the sinners rejoice in their sins, and take
their pleasure in ungodliness; this doctrine of thine is pleasant to the
wicked, and it is the way and principle of liberty in all sin, rather then the
principles to lead from sin, and so thou have showed whose work thou art doing,
by strengthening the wicked in his way, so that he cannot turn from sin, rather
then drawing him from sin, and this is the Devils work.

And thou say such as are justified, are regenerated and sanctified; and a
little before thou said to be justified is not to be cleansed, nor is it to
partake of real righteousness; and persons are justified from sins which they
have to commit. And these are contradictions, and proceed out of darkness, and
not from the light; and thy folly and ignorance may be read by all men; for who
are regenerated and sanctified are cleansed, and partakes of real
righteousness; and thou further say, that sanctification is a real change
from sin to the purity of the Image of God and I say none are sanctified but
they are justified, so none are justified but who are changed into the Image of
God, this the trut^ says, and wherein thou have said contrary, thou have
spoken contrary to the truth, and the truth will judge thee.

Again thou say sanctification is not perfect in this life, and the new man,
the spirit or law of the mind, is that grace or imperfect sanctification, etc.

Ans. Then Christ is not perfect in this life, for he is made of God unto us
sanctification, 1 Cor. 1. 30. but we say Christ is perfect, and therefore
sanctification is perfect, and the new man is the Image of God, and is created
in righteousness and in true holiness; but thou say the new man is
imperfect; consider of thy principles, when they are compared with the
scriptures, and see the error and wickedness of them, and the spirit and Law
in the mind is the spirit of God, and the Law of God in which the Apostles
served God, and so does all the Saints; but thou say the spirit and Law in
the mind, is imperfect, and this is error in the highest degree, to say or
signify that the new man the Image of God, that is in righteousness and true
holiness, and the Spirit of God and the Law of God is imperfect
sanctification, and grace is the salvation, and is Gods sufficiency, and that
thou say is imperfect also; and thus thy principles of thy religion which
thou walk in thy self, and would teach to others, are abominable, corrupted
principles of error, and contrary to the spirit of truth, and to the scriptures
also; and no marvel that thy name is concealed, for thy work deserves not a
good man's name to it; much more might be said to lay open further thy folly,
but this is sufficient to men of understanding; and contrary to thee I do
assert, that the new man, the Image of God, the Spirit and Law of God in the
mind, is perfect grace and perfect sanctification, and thou have said the
contrary, and now whether thy principles of Religion, or mine, be the more
true, and whether falls, let all sober men judge with the light in their
conscience,

And thou say, the old man, the flesh, the body of sin, the body of death, is
the sin that remains in sanctified persons.

Ans. Who are sanctified, are ^reed from the body of sin and death, and has
put it off, and the Law of the Spirit of life has freed them from the flesh,
and from the old man; for if the old man, the flesh, the body of sin, and death
be in the sanctified person^, then there is none sanctified at all, and what
are they sanctified, freed and cleansed from, if the old man, the flesh, the
body of sin and death be ye remaining in them? thou speak like an unlearned
man, and one that, knows not the sanctified estate, but art erring in thy
mind, and judgment, and in thy words also, for we have put off the old man, and
are Crucified to the flesh, and made free from the body of sin and death, and
this is our sanctification, and who are remaining in these things are not
sanctified, but in the degeneration, and has no part yet in the kingdom of
God, nor in Christ Jesus, but are without him in the world.

And thou say, the sanctification of the first day, has put an end to the
sanctification of the seventh etc.

Ans. Here again thou have uttered that which thou knows not, for all days
are alike unto God, and one sanctified as much as an other, and no respect of
days with him, but all are holy, and pure, and good, and when the
sanctification of any thing is put to an end, (as as thou say the
sanctification of the seventh day is) then the thing is no more good, nor holy,
but become evil and unclean, if it be no more sanctified nor holy, and in this
principle thou have erred also; as for the seventh day it was commanded of God
to the Jews, to be kept and observed holy to the Lord, and all manner of labor
to all Creatures were forbiden, which thing was a sign and a shadow of a good
thing to come, the end of which ordinance was Christ's the substance of all
things, and the end of days, and that there was any anulling of that command
to the Jews, and a command to keep and observe the first day of the week in
stead of the other, by any outward command, this we read not in all the
Scriptures, and what ground thou have more then thy imaginations I know not; to
assert the changing of days, and to teach the observation of the first day, as
the Sabbath instead of the seventh day, seeing thou have nothing in the
Scriptures to raise such a principle from, and so would make exception of
days, and respect of times which the Apostles did not, after the holy spirit
was come; for days and times all are a like to God, and who are come to Christ
the true rest of the immortal Soul, are in the end of days, and out of the
respect of times, in the substance which endures for ever, and in the Gospel
ministrations, there is no command or injunction, by Christ or by his Apostles
given to us for the observing any one day more then another.

And thou say, when it is said, swear not at all, the meaning is not vainly
and unnecessarily.

Ans. Christ has not spoken doubtfully, but plainly, and he has not left his
words to thee to give thy falls meaning upon; so thou take too much upon thee,
and intrudest into things thou have not seen, and all swearing which is
contrary to the command of Christ, is unnecessarie and vain, though by such
false consequences and perverting of Scriptures, thou and thy generation have
made the people to err, and led the blind by the way; for where the Scriptures,
as they are in themselves, does not made for your turn, then it means not thus,
but otherwise, and this is the consequence, and it must be interpreted say you,
and so you pervert the Scriptures to your own destruction, and to the undoing
of many others, for you that lead the people cause them to err.

And where is thou speakst, of outward seals of the Covenant, which is Baptism
(say thou) which appertains to grown persons converted, and also to
children, etc. Acts 2. 39.

Ans. The seal of the covenant of God is the Spirit, even the Spirit of promise
which seals and confirms unto God, and not any outward thing; for the
Covenant of God is inward and spiritual, and not outward and carnal; and the
seal and testimony of it, is the spirit of life, and no tradition of man; and
as for Baptism in that way and manner administered and practiced, as in the
Church of England, it is wholly an invention of man, and not after any
Institution and commandment of God, and sprinkling of infants, which is said
to be Baptism, is so far from being a seal of the Covenant of God, that it is a
mark of the whore of Rome, and was by her first of all ordained and begun to be
practiced in her Church, and your false Minsters have received it from her, and
it is a seal and sign that you and you Ministry and Church is of the whore of
Rome, and not of the true Church of Christ; for, the Apostles nor the true
Church of Christ never ordained nor practiced such a thing amongst them; and in
the true Church, as sprinkling of infants and calling it the Baptism in the
faith of Christ, and the seal of the Covenant, there was no such practice and
dostrine amongst them; but it is come up since the true Church fled into the
wilderness, and since the beast received power over kindreds and Nations, and
it is an institution of the great whore that has sat upon the waters, for many
generations, and she has made Nations drink her cup of fornication, and the
original of this practice and principle is received out of the whores Cup, and
not by any commandment of Christ, or axample of his Church and Apostles; and I
cannot but charge thee, that thou teaches for doctrine the traditions of men,
and holds forth for principles of Religion, to be believed and learned, the
institutions of the great whore, of whose cup thou have drunk, and would also
give it to others that they may drink it also, and to accomplish which evil end
thou have perverted the Scriptures Acts 2. 39. for the Scripture has no such
thing intended in it, as to the baptising of infants, for which end thou have
falsely cited it, for though the promise is to as many as the Lord our God
shall call, yet what is this to the sprinkling of infants, which thou asserts
as a principle of Religion, and would seem to enforce it, by virtue of the
Scripture mentioned? but thou have abused the Scripture, and showed thy self
to be disagreeing to the holy Ministers and Apostles of Christ, and to be
agreeing with the false Church of Rome, and this is answer sufficient to thee.

And thou say, The outward covenant of God is conditional, and the
profession of the faith entitles both such as make it, and their infants unto
it ( to wit,) the covenant.

Ans. The Covenant of God is not outward but spiritual, as I have said, and it
is also free, even the free gift of God, and the promise and Covenant is freely
manifested without the performing any thing by the creature to obtain it from
God, for it stands not upon condition, but upon free love and mercy; and many
makes a profession of faith which has not right nor title to the inheritance
of Salvation, nor to Gods sure covenant, neither can any upon earth, much
less Infants void o^ understanding, have any assurance or title in the
Covenant of life eternal, but who are regenerated and born of the elect seed,
for the unchanged and degenerated, in that state has no title nor right in the
Covenant, but Abraham's seed which is heir of the promise, which is born of God
and not from below, to that is the Covenant; so thou have spoken things thou
know not, and have manifested thy false principles which thou walk in,
and would cause others to receive them also.

Then thou speak, of bread and wine, which ( say thou) are the outward
signs in the Lords Supper, and are aseal of the Covenant also, etc.

Ans. The supper of the Lord is the bread of eternal life, the body and blood
of Christ, and who eats thereof shall never die, nor hunger and thurst any
more; and as for bread and wine visible and carnal, that is not the real Supper
of the Lord, and even the purest institution and practice thereof is but a
representation of a thing, and not the very thing, and the end and substance
being come, the outward sign may be neglected; But as for the manner and
institution of that practice in the Church of England, and the practice it
self, we deny to be either a sign of good past, or to come; but in an
Idolatrous way it is leld forth, and not in any true honor to God; for he is
thereby dishonored; for the false Church has gotten the form of that
practice as well as of many others, (which the true Church once practiced)
without the power, and now does practice many things, in mere imitation and
vain Idolatry, and in form and tradition, and without the teaching of the
Spirit, which sometime the true Church and the Apostles practiced in the power,
and by the leading of the Spirit of God, and what the command of God was unto
them; so that though you may in some things practice the very same which the
Apostles did, yet having not the same Spirit to lead you, nor being guided
thereby as the saints and the Apostles were, your works are but Idolatry and
formal, and not accepted of the Lord, but stinks in his nostrels, and your
covenant is outward, and your seals outward, your Baptism and Supper outward
and carnal, and while you are with zeal prosecuting your outward proformances
and following them, you neglect the inward, and the substance, which is Christ
within you the hope of glory, which if he be in you, then the body of sin is
put off, and the vail is done away, and the representations are done away, and
the substance and salvation is come, and if Christ be not in you, you are
reprobates, notwithstanding all your profession and practices of outward duties
unto God without his Spirit.

And whereas thou have quoted, Col. 3. 10. Gal. 5. 17. Rom 7. 23. to prove that
the new man, the spirit or Law of the mind, is called the imperfect
Sanctification.

Ans. Hereby openly thou have showed thy self to be a perverter of the
Scriptures and a wrester of them to thy own destruction; for let but reasonable
men peruse the Scriptures mentioned by thee, and see if there be such a thing
in them as held forth by thee; that the new man, the spirit or Law of the mind,
is called imperfect Sanctification, which thou have asserted, and cited those
texts to prove it, but to as to the thing it self I have answered before; only
this is to show, thy manner of perverting Scriptures; which is the work of the
evil spirit in thee, and not the work of the Spirit of God.

And thus I have examined some part of thy principles of Religion which thou
have put forth into the world, for others to learn; and the error and falsness
of them is laid open, and how contrary to the Scriptures they are, and in haste
as it were, I have passed over it, not willing to rake into things which gave
no just occasion against truth; but have only confuted a few of thy many
particulars; which had I narrowly sought into other things, much unsoundness
would have been discovered; but what I have said is truly sufficient to
discover unto sober persons, the error of thy judgment, and of thy principles
and practices, and of thy whole Religion; and before ever thou be a true
instructor of others in the way, thou must first repent and believe, and learn
the way thy self, which yet thou are ignorant of; for thou have showed no
knowledge but what is sensual and devilish, and from below, and merely carnal,
and natural; and meeting with thy book, and enquiring what the Author was, I
was engaged to say something to it by way of Answer, and to lay it to the line
of judgment according to the Scriptures; and it has proved very guilty of
error, and perverting Scriptures, and of corrupt principles; and in justice I
could not but condemn it, and if thou shall receive the conviction of thy
error, and of thy false doctrines by my answer, and repent, it shall prove to
thy good; but if thou shall be stiff-necked, and harden thy heart, then shall
thy condemnation be the greater and thy Judgment the more just; because God
has warned thee, and given thee a day of visitation, and showed thee the error
of thy ways and judgment that thou might forsake thy transgressions, and
be converted and live; but whether thou shall harden thy heart and remain in
error, or repent or turn from it; my reward is with the Lord, and in him I have
peace in this matter; whatsoever, thy mind shall be toward me in my work; for
I stand not to man's judgment while I cannot be convinced of error in this
business, and if thou shall envy me, and have wrath in thy heart toward me,
because I have dealt to plainly with thee in reproving of thee; then thou will
but add to thy own sin, and add more wrath up in store against thy self against
the time of thy judgment, and a greater burden will lie upon thy conscience;
wherefore consider of these things and let not the day of thy visitation pass
over, and be shut up with the night of darkness, and thou be everlastingly
condemned; And if thou shall vindicate thy own false principles, by answering
to me again; thinking to clear thy self, and to reprove me, that will not prove
thy best way because thou wants the truth and righteousness to stand by thee;
and to appear bold in a bad cause, will show more wickedness, then sign of
repentance; and if thou do answer a sound reply will further unfold the
mystery of iniquity that lies hid in thee, and be thy greater shame; And as
for thee and all the false Ministers, God has discovered you, and you are made
bare and naked, and the false woman the Whore, your mother, her shame is
discovered and her judgment is come, and God is avenging us on her, and great
Babylon is now come into remembrance before the Lord, to bring her down to the
ground, and you have long made a prey upon the heritage of the Lord, and been
spoilers thereof, rather then builders of her breach, and she has been trodden
down, and not pitied by you; and as for your poor ignorant hearers they lie in
thick darkness, and loves to have it so; and the blind has led the blind, and
yet the light is arising out of thick darkness, and its appearance shall be
glorious to expel all your errors, and that mist of darkness that does now
cover them, and this light shall arise in men's consciences, which shall
discover the difference between every false, and the right way; and all that
take heed to the light shall no longer sit in darkness nor in the shadow of
death, but their steps shall be directed in a perfect way; and the glory of the
Lord shall shine forth upon them, and this will the Lord bring to pass, and
hasten his work, and cut it short in righteousness, for his elects sake.

The 21. of the 3. Mon. 1659. By a lover of thy soul, and a seeker of the good
and Peace of all men. E. B.

THE END.
