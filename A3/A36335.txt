Other Public Misdemeanors, are All upon Record, and Needless to be here
Inserted: But now, to give him his due, in Mitigation of his Villainies, he had
more of Wit, Address, and Truth, in him, then All his Fellow Evidences, Put
together; and he was a Man of Method over and above; as you will see by the
Sequel: For he kept Distinct Diaries of his Motions, Receipts, and Expenses: And
there appears upon his Papers of Disbursements, in the Space of Two Years, and
betwixt Eight and Nine Months, [Fourteen Hundred and Fifty Pound, Fifteen

The Reader is to take Notice, that in This Expedition, DANGERFIELD went by the
Name of FIELD; And that Care is taken for the Dispersing of his Notes, as they
are here put together, into All the Places where he made his Progress: Not
Doubting but that it will Produce some Further Discovery of so Notorious a
Cheat.

To give his Description; He Is a Proper, Black, Handsome-Fellow. He was in
Second Mourning, and a Short Periwig, for the Greater Part of the Time. Mounted
upon a Light Bay, betwixt 14 and 15 Hands High: But upon the Swaying of his
Nagg, he bought a Gray Gelding at Worcester, about 14 Hands High; with a White
Face, and Two Wall Eyes.

His Servant, was a Short, Well-set, Black Young man, Pockbroken, and upon a
Dark Bay, about 14 Hands High.

Dangerfield Himself, is at present a Prisoner in Newgate.
