The Kings Majesty's Answer to the Petition of the House of Commons, sent on
Saturday last, the nine and twentieth of this instant Jan. 1642.
HIs Majesty having seriously considered of the Petition presented to him from
the House of Commons, on Wednesday the six and twentieth of this month,
returns this answer.

That he was in good hope his gracious Message, the twentieth of this month,
to both Houses would have produced some such overture, which by offering what is
fit on their parts to do, and what is proper for his Majesty to grant, might
beget a mutual confidence in each other.

Concerning the Tower of London, His Majesty did not expect, that having
preferred a person of a known fortune, and an unquestionable reputation to that
trust, he should be pressed to remove him without any particular charge
objected against him, and therefore returns this answer, That if upon due
examination any particulars shall be presented to his Majesty, whereby it may
appear that his Majesty was mistaken in his opinion of the Gentleman, and that
he is unfit for the trust committed to him, his Majesty will make no scruple of
discharging him, but otherwise his Majesty is obliged in justice to himself,
to preserve his own work, lest, his favor and good opinion may prove a
disadvantage and misfortune to his servants without any other accusation, of
which his Majesty doubts not this House of Commons will be so tender, (as of
all business wherein his Majesty's honor is so much concerned) that if they
find no material exceptions against his person, they will rather endeavor to
satisfy and reform the fears of other men then (by complying with them)
press his Majesty to any resolution which may seem so much to reflect upon his
honor and justice.

For the Forts and Castles of the Kingdom his Majesty is resolved that they
shall always be in such hands (and only in such) as the Parliament may safely
confide in: But the nomination of any person to those places, being so
principal and inseparable a flower of his Crown, vested in him, and derived
to him from his Ancestors by the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom he will
reserve to himself; In bestowing whereof, as his Majesty will take care that
no corrupt or sinister courses shall prevail with him, so he is willing to
declare that he shall not be induced to express that favor so soon to any
person as to those whose good demeanor shall be eminent to him or his
Parliament: And if he now has or shall at any time by misinformation confer
such a trust upon an undeserving person, he is and always will be ready to
leave him to the wisdom and justice of his Parliament.

For the Militia of the Kingdom (which by the Law is subject to no command but
of his Majesty, and of authority lawfully derived from him) when any particular
course for ordering the same (which his Majesty holds very necessary for the
peace and security of his Kingdom) shall be considered and digested by his
Parliament, and proposed to his Majesty, his Majesty will return such an
answer, as shall be agreeable to his honor and the safety of his people, His
Majesty being resolved only to deny those things, the granting whereof would
alter the fundamental Laws, and endanger the very foundation upon which the
public happiness and welfare of his people is founded and constituted, and
would nourish a greater and more destructive jealousy between the Crown and
the Subjects, then any of these which would seem to be taken away by such a
satisfaction: And his Majesty does not doubt that his having granted more then
ever King has granted will ever persuade his House of Commons to ask more
then ever Subjects have asked. And if they shall acquaint his Majesty with the
particular grounds of their doubts and fears, he will very willingly apply
remedies proportional to those fears. For his Majesty calls God to witness,
that the preservation of the public peace, and the laws and liberties of the
Subject, shall always be his Majesty's care and industry as of his life, and
the lives of his dearest Children. And therefore his Majesty does conjure the
House of Commons by all the acts of justice and favor they have received from
him this Parliament, by their hopes of future happiness in his Majesty, and in
one another love of Religion and the peace of this Kingdom (in which that of
Ireland cannot be forgotten) that they will not be transported with jealousies
and apprehensions of possible dangers, to put themselves and his Majesty into
real and present inconveniences, but that they will speedily pursue the way,
proposed by his Majestys former message which in humane reason is the only way
to compose the distractions of the Kingdom; and with Gods blessing will restore
a great measure of felicity to King and People.
