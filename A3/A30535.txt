A Message TO ALL KINGS and RULERS in CHRISTENDOM.
To all (called) Christian Kings and Princes, and to all the Parliaments and
Rulers and Governors of every degree, throughout the whole Christian World.
A Call unto you all by a servant of the Lord, in the Name of the Lord God,
dreadful and mighty, and the highest Power over all the World, That ye take off
oppression, and relieve the oppressed, and cease to grind the face of the
poor, and from drinking the Whores cup, and from carrying of her, and from all
oppressions whatsoever, least the Lord God Almighty execute his fierce
indignation upon you, if ye will not turn at his reproof, and hearken to his
voice when he calls unto you.

FOrasmuch as it has come to pass in the World for many Ages since the last
glorious appearance of Christ Jesus, and the light of his glorious Gospel,
through his Servants the holy Apostles, That Antichrist, that man of sin, the
enemy of Christ and his Kingdom, has ruled in the hearts of people, and
throughout and over the Christian World, and he has been exalted within and
without, ever since the falling away from the true faith, which once was
delivered to the Apostles and true Churches, and he has showed himself to be
God, and has sitten in the seat of God, and has exercised Lordship over the
persons and consciences of men, throughout generations, ever since the falling
away from the faith; for the true Church, the elected Spouse, the Lambs Wife,
which once brought forth him that was to Rule the Nations, and was clothed with
the Sun, and had once great beauty and excellency, has been fled into the
Wilderness, and has been desolate as without Husband and Issue; but has
remained in her place, prepared her of God, where she has dwelt in mourning,
and been fed with the bread of sorrow, being pursued thither by the dragon and
his floods of cruelty, who also waited to devour the man child when he was
born, and the Martyrs blood has been shed, and the holy Prophets, and Apostles
and Saints, have been made war against, and killed and persecuted for
righteousness sake, and the two witnesses have long laid slain and rejoiced
over in the streets of the great City, and the blood of the Innocent has been
drunk, and the Lamb and his followers has been made war against, and the
dragon, the devil and Satan has deceived the World, into the name of
Christians, without true Christian life, and Righteousness and Truth has
stood afar off, and Justice and Mercy has been wanting, and the fear of the
Lord and true obedience to him has been in a great measure expelled out of
Nations, and even all that would not worship the Beast and his Images, and
receive his mark, the Beast has had Power to kill them, and he has had power
to execute his wrath against them that have followed the Lamb, even all this
time of darkness and Apostasy which has over-shadowed the Christian World,
since the Apostles days until this time; And all this has been since the
falling away from the Life and Righteousness and Spirit of Jesus, as I have
said, and the Beast has been great that arose out of the Sea, and out of the
Earth, (when the true faith was lost) and his power mighty amongst men, for he
received power from the dragon, that made war against the true Church, and
sought to devour the man child, and power has been given him over Kindreds
Tongues and Nations, and all the World has wondered and followed after the
Beast, and have been admiring his power and his great authority, and saying,
Who is able to make war with him, for he has had a mouth given that has
spoken great things, and it has been given him to war with the Saints, and to
overcome them by his unrighteous Laws and decrees, and all that dwelt upon the
earth has worshipped him, whose names are not written in the book of Life, and
he has had many heads, (even diverse sorts and changes of government) and many
horns, with which he has pushed the Innocent, and ruled over the earth, and
kept all under his power, and he has set up Images to worship and likenesses
without life, and he has caused both small and great, rich and poor, free and
bond, to receive his mark, and he has carried the Whore, and she has
journeyed upon him from Nation to Nation through the earth, in the sheeps
clothing, and made all Nations drink her cup of fornications, and the whore,
that false Church, she has sat as a Queen, in great state and authority upon
Nations, Tongues, Multitudes and Peoples, and through the Beasts authority,
which has carried her, she has Ruled in great authority over the consciences,
persons and estates of people, and she has drunk the Saints blood, and the
Martyrs blood, and in her is found even until this day the blood of the Martyrs
and the Prophets, and of just men, and of all that has been slain upon the
earth, and she has exercised cruelty and tyranny over the heritage of God, and
she has had the sheeps clothing upon her, even part of the garment of the
Lambs Wife, and she has appeared in much beauty with a golden cup in her hand,
in which the wine of her fornications, and the filthiness thereof has
appeared, and which she has caused the Nations to drink, and by her sorceries
and witchcrafts she has deceived the World, and with her false miracles, and
shows and Images and false ministers which she has set up, she has corrupted
the earth, and all this she has done by the Beasts power, that has carried
her, who received his authority from the dragon, and from the devil; and thus
Antichrist, the Beast and the Whore have ruled in the World in great authority
for many generations, and the World has been as a wilderness by them, and
waste, and barren of all good fruit, truth and faith has been departed from
amongst men, and love and peace has been far away, and murders, thefts, wars,
strifes and all injustice and wickedness has abounded in Nations, and thus
the whole earth has been corrupted through the Whore and false Church, who
has deceived Kings and Rulers and Peoples by her enchantments and sorceries,
which she has caused them to receive at her hand, and out of her golden cup of
abominations, out of which they have drunk false doctrines and practices to the
deceiving of their souls and bodies; But now the day of the Lord is come and
coming, and the Lambs Kingdom is to be set up, and the Kingdoms of this world
must be changed and recovered again, and will become the Kingdoms of the Lord,
and of his Christ, and the marriage of the Lamb is come again, and the day of
glad tidings unto the poor and to the distressed, and the Lambs wife, shall be
adorned for her husband, she shall be clothed with the Sun, and shall be
covered with her former beauty, and shall be led out of the Wilderness, and the
earth shall be refreshed and delivered from the oppressions and Tyrannies of
Antichrist and the Whore, for the hour of her judgments are come, and the
darkness of the night of woeful Apostasy which has clouded the World is
passing over, and the light of the Lamb is risen, and the daystar has appeared
in the hearts of people, and the man of sin which has sat in the Temple, and
showed himself to be God, and falsely exercised the bodies and consciences of
deceived people in false ways and worships, is discovering and destroying by
the spirit of his mouth, and by the brightness of the coming of Jesus, and the
Beast and the false Prophet shall be taken alive and cast into the lake of
fire, and the Beast and false prophet shall be tormented day and night for
ever, for the breath of life from God is entered into the two witnesses, and
they shall again prophecy, and the light of the glorious Gospel that has long
been hid, must again be preached to Kindreds Tongues and Nations, and the
Kingdom of Christ Jesus must be set up, and these things is the Lord God
Almighty bringing to pass, and he will confound and destroy Antichrist and all
that have worshipped him, and they that have worshipped the Beast, and drunken
the cup of fornication, and committed idolatry with the great Whore, they shall
be taken and cast into the bed of torment, and shall weep and howl, because of
the great destruction of Babylon that great City who has been the glory of
Kingdoms, and made rich her Merchants (the false Ministers) with deceivablenes,
whom God will overthrow; that great fenced City of confusion (the false Church)
that great Whore, the Mother of all abominations, the Lord God is risen against
her, to enquire for the blood of Martyrs, and Prophets, and righteous men,
that is found in her, and she shall be rewarded according to her ways, and as
she has given others to drink the cup of fornication, so in like manner shall
she drink the cup of fierceindignation of the Lords wrath from his Saints, and
she shall no more deceive the Nations by her sorceries, but the earth shall be
delivered from her, and the Kingdom of the Son of God shall be exalted over
all, and the light of the Lamb shall be the Light of all Nations, and all that
are saved shall walk in the light of it, and truth shall reign, and the fruit
of righteousness shall abound, and all people shall glorify God their Maker,
and the whole earth shall be refreshed with the mercy of him that made her.

Wherefore all ye Kings, Princes, Parliaments, Rulers through whole
Christendom, this is a request unto you all of a lover of Immortal souls, that
you will cease to commit fornication with the great Whore, and that you will not
any longer drink her cup of Idolatries, neither that you will causeNations to
drink it, neither that you will carry the great Whore any more, nor receive her
sorceries and enchantments to deceive your souls and bodies, and this the Lord
God Almighty (who ought to be the fear and dread of all Nations) requires of
you, and it is a charge to you in the presence of the Lord God, that ye do not
any longer defend the great City Babylon, and the false Church with your
weapons of cruelty and oppression, neither that you will ever any more oppress
the persons and consciences of people on her part and on her defense, but that
you will wholly cast off the Whore, and not suffer her to sit upon you, and
that you will not be Servants to her, to execute her cruelties upon the bodies
and consciences of people; for these things have you done, and therefore is the
Lord displeased with you, and therefore deliver your selves from the
abominations of the folse Church, and receive not her delusions, neither impose
them upon the peoples under you, for now the judgments of the great Whore is
come, and the time that the Lord will reward her according to her ways, and
she shall have of the fruit of her doings, and if you will yet uphold her, and
commit fornication with her, and compel the Nations to drink of her cup, and
cause all people to worship the Beast, and to receive his mark as it has been,
Then the Lord shall execute his vengeance upon you, and you shall in no wise be
deiivered; Wherefore I say again unto you, arise out of darkness, and come to
the brightness of the light of the morning, even to the Sons appearance, and
receive his Kingdom, and lay down your Crowns at his feet, for the Lamb is
risen whose Crown is immortal, and ye and all your glory, and greatness, and
honor, and power is but as dust and ashes before him, and he can break you down
and never build you up again; and come out of great Babylon, and forsake your
city, for the day of the Lord will sudenly come upon you, for great Babylon is
come into remembrance before the Lord to reward her with great indignation;
Wherefore this is a call unto you, lay aside your Inquisitions, your Goales and
Houses of Correction, and Prisons, and all your torturing, and persecuting of
the Persons and Consciences of People about Worship, Church and Ministry, for
in these things and by these weapons you have defended the Whore, and through
the force of your violent Laws, and cruel impositions unjustly laid upon
people, have the Whore (the false Church) been carried by you, and defended by
you; but lay aside all your cruel weapons, and not persecute nor kill, nor shed
the blood of the Servants of the Lord, by unjust Laws, nor limit not the Spirit
of God from crying against Babylon, and reproving her iniquities, for these
things have you done in defense of the Whore, for you have been the carriers of
her, the defenders and preserves of her by your unrighteous Laws, and through
you has she sat as a Queen, thinking she should nere see sorrow, because ye
have defended her, and taken part with her, and caused Nations to drink her
cup, for you have been the exec^t^rs of her pleasure, to compel the Nations to
commit Idolatry, and to partake of her fornications, and you give her authority
to drink the blood of all that would not drink her cup, and it is now time to
forsake these your ways, and to learn wisdom from the Lord, that you may rule
in righteousness amongst men, as men, but not to be Rulers in Christ's Throne,
nor his Kingdom, by imposing such a Worship, and such a Religion upon peoples
Consciences, and to destroy and kill all that will not thus worship to your
image, and bow according to your prescription, this ye ought not to do, nor the
Lord never entrusted you with this power, nor made you Rulers in his Kingdom,
nor to sit in his throne of conscience, for while you have done this, your
authority has been from the Dragon, and not from the Lamb; and now this the
Lord requires of you, let conscience go free, and rule not over the Inward
man, for while you do take that upon you, to force such a Worship and such a
Religion upon people, contrary to the Spirit of God, you are but servants to
the great Whore. Wherefore be warned, for this is an invitation of love,
righteousness, truth and just judgment, mercy and peace unto you, that you
may know what the mind of the Lord is unto you, and may do it, and rule for God
and not for man, upon which depends the happiness and welbeing of a Nation
and Nations, and their Rulers, and on the contrary depends their overthrow
and destruction, and this will speedily be brought to pass; wherefore come out
of Babylon, and deliver your selves from that bondage wherewith the false
Church has bound you, she has caused you to drink her cup, and you have been
made drunk with her false faith, and doctrines and practices; and ye have
compelled Nations to drink the same cup of abominations, and ye have executed
cruelty and injustice upon all that would not, and ye have been servants to the
great Whore, and being in bondage your selves, you have brought all in bondage
under you; but now the Lord is changing times, and things, and powers, and
happy are you if ye deliver your selves, and let the oppressed go free, in so
doing, if ye fulfill this my request, and do the will of the Lord herein, then
blessings and peace eternal; but if ye be disobedient, and take part
continually with the Whore, ye shall partake of her judgments; And this has
the Lord spoken to you, and in the day of vengeance ye shall confess that you
are warned,

By a Friend to the whole Creation, that waits for the Redemption thereof,
Edward Borough.

THE END.
