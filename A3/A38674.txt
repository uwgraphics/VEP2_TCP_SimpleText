AN Elegiack Acrostick UPON The Reverend, Learned, and much to be lamented Mr.
Joseph Caryl, Late Minister of the Gospel at St. Magnus London Bridge.
He departed this life Thursday, February the 13th. 1672.

Joseph! Oh, sigh when ye repeat that Name,
Only an Angel ought to speak the same:
Such are his works which we have seen in Print,
Each must estile him Master of the Mint.
Peerless for what h'as done, but what is more,
Has left behind Gemms never seen before.
Come all ye sacred Muses lend a tear,
As duty binds ye, come, and spend it here.
Reverence (what is pious, good, and just)
Ye ought to pay to his untimely dust.
Let others fear before they see a storm:
His Divine parts to Justice did conform.
AN EPITAPH ON The Reverend, Worthy, Pious and Elaborate Divine, Mr. Joseph
Caryl.
HEre lies a Saint, a patient Job,
Who lately traced our terrene Globe,
As sent on purpose to befriend
Poor sinners to their latter end.
Weep Reader, weep, for here lies one,
Whose worth deserves a better stone.
However, this place his corpse does keep,
But his rich soul can never sleep,
For happily he is gone before,
To pleasures lasting evermore.
Sic transit gloria mundi.

FINIS.
