Hereunto is also annexed a short APPENDIX concerning some Passages in STEPHEN
COLLEGES TRIAL.

Printed in the Year, MDCLXXXI.

The INTRODUCTION.
IT is a wonder to see how Passion and Interest predominate over Reason in
Mankind; Nothing is done, nothing said, without some tincture of either, or
both. Even common Occurrences are usually related as Men would have them to be,
rather then as they are. Plain-dealing is almost fled: And all things now a
days, whether Private or Public, Sacred or Profane, are according to
different Inclinations, without regard to Truth, promiscuously made the Subject
of a Satyr or Panegirick.

An obvious example of this we have in the several accounts given of the Trial,
Declaration, Demeanor, and Death of the late Lord Stafford; concerning whose
Tragedy, though acted for the most part in the face of the whole Nation, yet
there have flown about in a manner as many, and those contradictory Stories, as
there are Relaters; and such as know least, commonly talk most, to complete the
Error.

It is true, the Printed Trial set forth by Authority is no wise liable to
these gross mistakes; But it has swelled in the Press, by forms, etc. To so
vast a volume, that few can spare either money to buy it, or time to read it.
Besides, it is in a manner silent of matters chiefly designed for the Subject
of this Treatise ( viz.) My Lords Comportment, Declaration, Devotion, Last
Speech, and other Occurrences, which happened inclusively from the time of his
Trial, to his final end.

Having therefore attained to a most exact and certain knowledge of these
particulars, I shall for the satisfaction of the curious, and manifestation of
Truth, give (together with an abstract of the whole Trial, and some occurrences
concerning it) a plain and sincere relation of what I know, and can by
unquestionable Evidence justify to be true. And herein I shall also totally
abstain from any the les^ moralizing upon transactions, whereby to forestal the
Readers Judgment. But contenting my self with a plain and candid Relation of
things, as I find them, leave every one to the freedom of his own censure and
verdict upon them.

SECT. I. My Lords Birth, Education, Quality, etc.
William Howard, Viscount Stafford, was second Son to Thomas Earl of Arundel,
and Uncle to the now Duke of Norfolk. In his youth he was educated with all
care and industry imaginable to improve in him the endowments of Nature and
Grace. And to speak truth, he was ever held to be of a generous Disposition,
very Charitable, Devout, addicted to Sobriety, inoffensive in his words, and a
lover of Justice.

When he arrived to years of maturity, he married Mary, descended from the
ancient Dukes of Buckingham, Grandchild to Edward, and Sister, and sole Heiress
to Henry Lord Stafford; To whose Title he succeeded (being created by the late
King Charles of Glorious memory) Baron. Anno 1640. And soon after Viscount
Stafford.

During the time of the last bloody Rebellion, he suffered much for his Loyalty
to the King; Always behaving himself with that courage and constancy, as became
a Nobleman, a good Christian, and a faithful Subject. After his present
Majesty's joyful restoration, he lived in Peace, Plenty, and Happiness, Being
blessed with a most Virtuous Lady to his Wife, And many pious and dutiful
Children. In which state he remained till the 66. year of his age, when
happened this Revolution of his fortune, as follows.

SECT. II. My Lords Imprisonment, Charge and Arraignment, etc.
ABout Michaelmas Anno 1678. Mr. Titus Oats (formerly a Minister of the Church
of England) accused upon Oath, before the King and Council, and not long after
also before the two Houses of Parliament, several Roman Catholics, some
Persons of Quality; (and amongst the rest, the Lord Viscount Stafford,) of High
Treason, for intending and designing the Death of the King, the introducing of
Popery, and subversion of the Government.

My Lord, though he immediately heard of this Impeachment, yet relying (as he
said) on his own Innocence, never left his Family, nor withdrew himself from
his ordinary known Acquaintance and Affairs till the 25th of October, (78.)
when by Virtue of a Warrant from the Lord Chief Justice, he was sent Prisoner
to the Kings Bench, and from thence, soon after to the Tower, where he remained
above two years before he could be admitted to Trial.

During this interval, the whole Nation was surprised and alarmed with the
noise of an horrid Plot, contrived by the Pope, Priests, and Jesuits, wherein,
the King was to be murdered, Armies raised, Protestants Massacred, and the
three Kingdoms destroyed, by Fire and Sword, the People were affrighted,
searches made, Guards doubled, and all in an uproar. The King hereupon
consulted the Parliament, and both Houses declared it a Plot. Yet to strengthen
the Evidence (as yet, but weak) and make farther discoveries; Indempnities are
promised, Rewards proposed, and encouragements, given by Proclamation to any
who would make out upon Oath the particulars of what in substance was already
declared. By this, and the like sedulity of the King, and three succeeding
Parliaments, several new Witnesses came in; First, Captain Bedlow. Next
Dugdale, Prance, and two others Bolron, and Mowbray, out of the North; Then Mr.
Jennison, Smith, Seigneur Francisco Dangerfield, Zeile, Lewis, etc. Lastly one
Mr. Turbervile, who, together with Oats and Dugdale, gave Evidence against
this Lord Stafford, of whom we now treat.

After two years Imprisonment, when many Roman Catholics, both Priests and
others, had been Executed, and most of the rest Imprisoned or fled; At length
my Lord was brought to his Trial, on the 30th. day of Novem. 1680. at the Peers
Bar in Westminster Hall; the House of Commons being present, and the Lord
Chancellor High-Steward of England. The Impeachment was drawn in the name of
the Commons of England. Trial, p. 4.
wherein my Lord was charged, together with other Papists, for having imagined
and contrived to murder the King, to introduce Popery, and subvert the good
Government of Church and State established by Law.

To this Impeachment my Lord, being thereupon arraigned, pleaded Not Guilty.

Allegations in proof of the Plot in general. 1.
THen the Cause was opened, Page 7, etc.
and the Commons Learned Counsel, who were appointed Managers of the Trial, set
forth the Charge in most Copious and Eloquent Language; And beginning first
with the Plot in general, they showed to the life the Wickedness, the Malice,
the Horror of so Dreadful, Bloody and Hellish a Design. They strongly insisted
on the express Positive Oaths of the Witnesses, upon whose Testimony the credit
of this Plot chiefly depended. They amply dilated upon the Letters of Coleman,
and others, clearly demonstrating the busy Designs and Activity of the
Writers. They pressed home the execrable Murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey,
charged upon the Papists, as well by the Oaths of Captain Bedlow and Mr.
Prance, self-acknowledged Partners in the Assasination, as also by a certain
Letter sent from London to Tixall, intimating the Murder of a Justice of Peace,
and communicated by Dugdale to diverse Gentlemen in Stassordshire, the third day
after the Murder was committed. They displayed to the full view the Sham-Plots
and Counter-Contrivances, whereby (it is said) the Papists would have suborned
the Kings Evidence, and turned all their Guilt upon His Majesty's known and
well-experienced Loyal Protestant Subjects. They urged the firing the City, the
burning the Navy, the calling in French-Armies, Wild-Irish, Spanish-Pilgrims,
etc. asserted in the several Depositions and Narratives of Dr. Oats, Captain
Bedlow, Mr. Dangerfield, etc. They recapitulated the several Trials of Ireland;
Whitebread, Langhorn, etc. And alleged the Votes of both Houses of Parliament
declaring it a Plot. To strengthen all this, they ripped up the Cruelties of
Queen Mary, the French and Irish Massacres, the Powder Plot, etc. They
anatomized the wicked Principles (from whence spring evil Practices) of
Murdering, Lying, Swearing, Faith-breaking, Equivocating, etc. imputed to the
Papists, as held by them lawful, and matters of Faith. In short, nothing was
omitted, nothing neglected throughout the whole Process; But every the least
Circumstance enforced and advanced to its full proportion, with such vigor of
Wit and Industry as sitly corresponded to so great a Cause, prosecuted by so
high an Authority, before so Illustrious Judges, and August an Assembly.

When the Managers themselves had made these efforts to show the Universal
Conspiracy, (as they termed it) they produced six Witnesses to the same effect,
whereby to second and confirm what they had thus in general asserted.

Mr. Smith's Deposition.
THe first was Mr. Smith, Page 17, etc,
who deposed, That going into France, he became acquainted with Abbot Montague
and one Father Bennet; These persons, to induce him to be a Catholic, told him
he should have an Employment amongst them; and that in a few years they would
bring in their Religion into England, right or wrong; But this was not
sufficiently prevalent with him to turn Papist; yet he lived with them several
years. The motives of his Perversion.
That at last he went into Italy, where the Jesuits persuaded him to discourse
with Cardinal Grimaldi, the which he did; That the Cardinal made much of him;
and he it was perverted him to the Romish Religion; That, upon occasion of
showing him a pair of Hangings, this Cardinal told him, He had great assurances
the Popish Religion would prevail in England; That there was but one in the
way; And that, to accomplish their Designs, they must take him out of the way.
That the Jesuits there also publicly preached, and privately taught, That the
King of England being an Heretic, whoever took him out of the way, would do a
meritorious act. That after this, he studied several years at Rome; And that,
whilst he was in the College, he saw several of Coleman's Letters. That, being
made a Priest, he was sent into England with instructions to inform the
Papists, They were not obliged to obey the King; but that they should endeavor
to promote the Popish Religion. His Employment in England.
That upon his arrival in England, he was placed with one Mr. Jenison in the
Bishopric of Durham, where his main Employment was to root out the Jesuits,
(as men ill-principled) and to dissuade the Papists from sending Moneys to
Colleges beyond-seas. That one Thomas Smith told him he received a Letter from
the Lord Stafford, wherein my Lord said, He expected some sudden Change.

Dugdale's Deposition.
NExt to Mr. Smith was Stephen Dugdale, page 21. etc.
who deposed, That for about 15 or 16 years together, he had been acquainted,
by several Letters, and other means, there was a Design carrying on for the
bringing in of the Romish Religion. That the Papists were to have Money and
Arms ready against the King's Death, (for he said he heard nothing of killing
the King till the year 78.) That in October (78.) my Lord Aston and others
should go to dispose of certain Arms they received, to the value of 30000 l.
That the King of France was acquainted with all these Designs; and that he
would furnish the Papists with Men, and afford them other Aid and Assistance,
if the King should die, or be taken away. That he saw a Letter writ to Mr.
Evers, (for all the Jesuits Letters were returned to him) wherein were these
words, This night Sir Edmundbury Godfrey is dispatched. That he himself had
contributed 500 l. His Contribution for Arms, etc. 50. l.
for Arms, etc. to carry on the Design. That about the year 78. there was an
Indulgence published at all private Chapels, wherein whosoever was active for
killing the King, should have a free Pardon of all their Sins. That he was told
at Meetings, That the King being an Heretic, it was lawful to kill him; And
that it was no more then to kill a Dog; That he had heard, That about the time
the King should be killed, several Parties should be provided with Arms, and
rise all on a sudden at an hours warning, Armies ready at an hours warning.
and so come in upon the Protestants, and cut their Throats; And if any did
escape, there should be an Army to cut them off in their Flight; That he heard
the Pope's daily In come was 24000 l. a day. The Popes contribution 1000 l.
And that the same Pope (as he thought) had promised to contribute in the whole
1000 l. for the raising of Armies, and carrying on the above mentioned Design.

Mr. Prance his Deposition
THen Mr. Prance was produced, who deposed, Page 25. etc
That one Mr. Singleton a Priest told him, He would make no more to stab forty
Parliament Men, then to eat his dinner, which he was then at.

Dr. Oats his Deposition.
NExt Doctor Oats gave Evidence, Page 25. etc.
That in the year (76) he being then a Protestant, and Chaplain in the Duke of
Norfolk's Family, One Mr. Kemish and one Mr. Singleton Priests, advised him to
hasten betimes to the Church of Rome, for that the Protestant Religion was now
upon its last legs. That hereupon (having had before some suspicion of the
designs of the Papists, and growth of Popery) to satisfy his curiosity, his
feigned Conversion.
he feigned himself a Convert: was seemingly reconciled; presently admitted by
the Jesuits to do their business, entrusted in their secrets; and sent by them
in April (77) with Treasonable Letters into Spain. That e're he arrived at
Validolid, there were Letters got before him from England, wherein was
expressed; That the King was dispatched, which was a cause of great joy to the
Fathers there; But that this proved a mistake. That during his abode in Spain,
he found the Ministers of that Court were very ready to advance Money, which
Money was returned into England; And that the Provincial of the Jesuits of
Castile had also advanced 10000 l. That soon after this, The Provincial of
Castile contribution 10000 l.
he was present at a Sermon Preached to some Students, against the Oaths of
Allegiance and Supremacy, wherein likewise the Kings Legitimacy was villified
and abused; and it was declared, that his Religion entitled him to nothing but
Sudden death and Destruction. That returning into England in November following
and bringing Letters for Mr. Strange, he heard Mr. Keines say in Mr. Strange's
Chamber; he was mighty sorry for honest Will (meaning the Ruffian that was to
kill the King) that he had missed in his enterprise. [Here Mr. Oats thought
good to tell their Lordships. That the Papists were not so Zealous for the
destruction of the King, till the King had refused Coleman the Dissolving of
the long Parliament: Then he went on to acquaint them,] That in December he
departed from London to St. Omers, loaded with Letters from Strange and others,
importing the hope they had the next year to effect their Design. That being at
St. Omers he saw Letters out of Ireland, whereby he found that there, the
Talbots and other persons were very zealous in raising of Forces, and resolved
to let in the French King. That in February, several of St. Omers were employed
to several places in Germany and Flanders, to fetch and carry correspondences.
That in March, Pickering attempting to kill the King, the Flint of his Gun was
loose, and the King escaped, for which Pickering received a Discipline,
Pickering receive'd a Discipline.
and the other ( viz. William Groves) a Chiding. That in April he returned to
London; And that there was then a Consult held, first at the
White-horse-Tavern, and then afterward adjourned into particular Clubs, where
the Confederates did resolve on the Death of the King; Afterward a Promise of
30000 Masses
And that Groves should have 500l. for his pains; And Pickering (being a
Religious man) should have 30000 Masses. That in June he saw more Letters, and
heard new Proposals, wherein a Reward of 15000 l. was offered to Sir George
Wakemen for poisoning the King. That in July Mr. Strange very frankly told him
how London was fired, and how many of those concerned were seized, and
afterward discharged by the Duke's Guards and Order.

Mr. Jennison's Deposition.
AFter Oats, Page 32.
Mr. Jennison was called in, who deposed, That in frequent discourses with Mr.
Ireland (now Executed) he heard him often say, That it was necessary, for the
introducing of Catholic Religion, that the Government should be changed; And
that it was an easy matter to Kill or Poison the King. That he answered, God
forbid. That hereupon Ireland told him he would remit the Twenty pounds he owed
him, if he would go to Windsor, A Twenty pound Debt returned, for a Reward to
kill the King.
to assist to take off the King; But he expressed a great detestation of it.
Then Ireland desired him to name some Stout Courageous Irish-men, proper for
the Assasination; which he did, and Ireland approved of them. That he heard one
Mr. Thomas Jennison, a Jesuit, say, If C. R. would not be R. C. he should not
be long C. R. And that the said Jesuit added, If the King were Excontmunicated
or Deposed, he was no longer King, and it was no great Sin to take him off.
That about two months after, the said Jesuit told him there was a Design on
foot, and that the Queen, Duke of York, the Lords in the Tower, and greatest
Papists in England were in It. That there was a new Army to be raised, to bring
in Catholic Religion; And that He (the said Jesuit) would procure him from the
Duke a Commission in it, when the King was taken off. That he being surprised
hereat, the Jesuit told him he should receive the Sacrament of Secrecy.

Mr. Dennis his Deposition.
THe last Witness was Mr. Dennis, page 30
who deposed, That he saw Dr. Oats in Spain, where he seemed to be a man of
much business, and had a Bag of Money, some of which he lent him. That the
Archbishop of Tuam told him in the presence of Dr. Oats, That Mr. Plunket,
Primate of Ireland, was resolved to bring the French Power into Ireland; And
that there were several Collections of Money made in Ireland to support the
Plot.

This is the sum of what the six Witnesses deposed; to whose Depositions were
annexed, and produced in Court (in order to the same end) the sevcral Records
of Attainder of Coleman, Ireland, Whitebread, Langhorn, etc. That of Coleman
was read at length, and the others deposited on the Clerks Table, to be made
use of as occasion should serve.

The Papists Plea to the above-specified Allegations. 2.
THus far has been (as I may say) Indicted, Page 17.
Arraigned, and Tried, the Plot in general. My Lord Stafford (as the Managers
declared) is not hitherto proved, but only supposed a Party in the Conspiracy;
The Plot in general is directly charged upon the Papists in general, and they
must answer to the general Indictment; wherefore, though it be not my Design to
defend Popery, yet I think it very pertinent and necessary, before we enter
upon my Lord's special Charge and Defension, to insert here some of those many
things the Papists in general often did, and still do constantly allege
against the Premises, in vindication of their Innocence. If in this I shall be
accounted a Papist, or Popishly affected, it will only be amongst those who
love not to see Truth, contrary to their Interest; not to do Justice, though to
an Adversary. To proceed then.

The Papists plead, The Papists plea against the Plot in general.
That it is not the Clamor of the hainousness and horror of a Crime imputed,
but the Guilt and clear Couviction of a Crime proved, that renders a man
accountable to Justice, and punishable by the Law.

That as Treason is the worst of Crimes, so is the stain of Innocent Blood
(shed by Perjury) hard to be washed off.

That the bare positive Swearing of every person in every matter or manner,
hand over head, is no sufficient Conviction of another Guilt; for if so, it
would be in the Power of any six Knights of the Post to kill whomsoever they
pleased, though never so Innocent; and for what they pleased, though never so
absurd or impossible, by mere dint of Affidavit.

That false Accusations may be so laid, as that the contrary cannot possibly be
demonstrated by the Party accused; seeing no mortal man can distinctly prove
where he was, and what he did, said, or heard, every day and every hour of his
whole Life; Wherefore, to make justly valid an Accusation against another, the
Laws of God and Man require,

First, That the Accuser be a Credible Witness, that is, not tainted with
notorious Crimes or Villainies; for he that has lost a sense of moral Honesty,
has lost his right to moral Credit, and may be indifferently presumed to Swear
any thing.

Secondly, That the Accusation be strengthened with probable Circumstances;
Circumstances which bring along with them some appearance of Truth, distinct
from the bare Accusation it self; for otherwise, where the Balance is equal in
point of repute, between the Accuser and the Accused, it is as presumptive that
the one should be guilty of Perjury, as the other of the Crimes charged upon
him; And herein, the weaker the Credit of the Accusers are, the stronger ought
the presumption of Circumstances to be, as natural Reason and Justice dictate.

Now neither of these two essential Conditions are found in the Evidence given
of this pretended Plot.

As for the first Condition; What manner of men the Witnesses are who make
these Discoveries; how notoriously Infamous; how stigmatized with all sorts of
Felonies, Forgeries, Cheats, Debaucheries and Wickedness, many Intelligent
Protestants in their Consciences know; the Witnesses themselves have been
often forced to acknowledge, and several Courts of Judicature, can, upon Record
give public Testimony.

As for the second condition; there are not only no Circumstances confirming
the bare Oaths; But the whole series of the Evidence, is a mere bundle of Moral
imposibilities, contradictions, and nonsense. Here is a Plot (forsooth)
contrived by the Papists, at a time when they had least, or rather no reason,
to seek a Change; To kill the King, by whose merciful indulgence they lived in
Peace; To wade through blood to an uncertain liberty, which they already
sufficiently enjoyed; To overthrow the Government for the restablishing of
which they so frankly in the late Wars exposed their lives and for tunes; This
Plot must be managed by Persons of Quality, most remarkable peradventure of all
others for firmness of Loyalty, and now through age and infirmities, retired
from public business and weary of the world; The whole body of Roman
Catholics, (men, before this hour, of known worth, virtue, integrity, and
unblemished Reputation,) must all be involved by Vows, and Sacrements, in a
design so black, and execrable, That God and nature abhor to think on it. They
must hazard their Honor, their Estates, their Families, their Bodies, their
Souls, their All, in an enterprise, so desperate and sottish, that none but
madmen would attempt it, and nothing but a miracle could either effect, or
conceal it.

In this Plot are said to have been engaged for several years together diverse
Nations, England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, etc. (an
affront, shame and scandal unto the greatest Part of Christendom) wherein many
thousands of both Sexes, of different Interests, of all sorts, states and
conditions, must necessarily have been privy to, and partners in the Villainy.
Now, that none of all this vast number should have any remorse for so bloody a
Treason; None all this while the Worth, Wit or Grace to reveal it; No
intervening accident, no Levity, no disagreement of Parties, happen to detect
it, till at last Dr. Oats Captain Bedlow, and by degrees their other
Companions, raked out of Gaols, Whipped, Pillory'd, and one way or other branded
with Infamy, made this Grand Discovery, (good men) out of tenderness of
Conscience. This is somewhat hard to believe.

To prosecute this Plot the Witnesses attest there were huge Armies of Papists
( Dugdale mentions two hundred thousands) immediately to be raised; Page 70.
These numberless Swarms, were to be provided with proportionable stores of
Weapons, Ammunitions, etc. and all in a readiness for a general Massacre of
Protestants at an hours warning; Oats and the rest likewise affirm they were
well acquainted with all the most deep, and secret intrigues the Papists had,
of this nature; Yet after all, when it comes to it; They cannot show or direct
where these Millions of men, and Mountains of Magazines are; The Kings
Officers, after thirty months diligent scrutiny, could never find the least
footsteps of any such thing. And it is imposible they should or could be
invisibly dispersed or conveyed away upon so sudden and unexpected a
discovery, especially in the very nick of time when they were to be made use on.

We are farther told of hundreds of Sealed Commissions for all sorts of
Military Offices; my Lord Stafford (because no good Accountant) must be
Paymaster General; Diverse Patents granted for dignities of State; many Bulls
and Breifs for Ecclesiastical preferments; And God knows how many even Bushels
of Letters, and Pacquets, all containing most damnable Treason, sent
nevertheless up and down at randam, some by the Common Post. Others by such
Messengers as Oats, Bedlow, Dugdale and Dangerfield, who, as bosom
Councillors, were still privy to the contents of what they carried too and
fro, and became so dexterous in taking remarques, That they could exactly tell
(when their memories failed not for fear of contradictions) the particular
Dates, when, where, to whom, and from whom; Nay they could punctually recite
upon their singers ends, the very express words of almost every Letter; Oats
moreover declares, he was never a real Catholic, but only pretended to be so,
Page 123.
on purpose to make Discoveries: And he was so successful in this Stratagem,
that he gained from the Jesuits a Patent Coleman's Trial.
to be taken into the Consult. Is it possible then, that none of these men thus
circumstanced, could get or preserve one single Letter, one sealed Commission,
one scrip of Paper, one Original Writing, (a thousand manner of ways easily
compassed in such a conjuncture) whereby to credit their monstrous Evidence?
How came it about they did not at the first Discovery (having both time and
opportunity to do it) seize by surprise some of these Things, together with the
Persons, where they were lodged? Did all the Plotters burn their Commissions,
Bulls, and Briefs, as well as their Letters, as soon as they received them? Why
did not Oats show us at least his own Patent received from the Jesuits? Surely
it would have been of mighty force to strengthen his Testimony. Why did not the
other Witnesses also produce some of those Treasonable Letters, writ, (as they
said,) and directed to themselves? Nothing appear; nothing extant; nothing
feisible, but a few naked, harmless men, in their several private Chambers? And
this too, just when the Grand Design was to break into Action? What mortal man
can reconcile these endless Contradictions?

From these, and other the like grounds, the Papists would infer, That no
credit ought to be given to the bare Oaths of these men, swearing at this wild
incoherent rate. And they farther appeal to the Judgment of every impartial
conscientious man, Whether it be not more likely that a few Debauched Wretches,
of lost Consciences, and desperate Fortunes, allured by Gain, and encouraged by
Indempnities, should be induced out of Malice or Interest, to swear a Lie; then
that so many, so Noble, so Prudent, so known Loyal and Virtuous Persons, should
be guilty of so horrid, so bloody, so absurd, so morally impossible, and (in
all circumstances) contradictory a Design? Nay whether, if such Evidence be
allowed and countenanced, any man, either Papist or Protestant, can be long
secure of his Reputation, Fortune, or Life.

To what was argued from the acknowledged Letters of Mr. Coleman, Coleman's
Letters.
and others; It is answered, That those Letters indeed manifestly denote the
busy Designs and Activity of the Writers; yet are they withal so far from
confirming a Plot, such as Oats and his Companions pretend to discover, that
they directly evince the contrary. For, the whole subject and context of those
Letters bear a plain and open face of what the Authors intended; And the
Writers were Persons, who, (had there been a Plot.) were the most likely of all
others to have been the main Engines and Contrivers of it: Nevertheless, we do
not find one single world or syllable in them, from whence may be gathered any
such design; The substance of them being only some imaginary Conceits, and
overweening Policies of four or five aspiring men, willing to be Great, or at
least to be thought so; and desiring perhaps, in some measure, a liberty of
Conscience; yet without confronting, much less destroying the King or
Government. Wherein also (as far as appears by the Letters) they were nowise
seconded by the Catholics in general, nor much countenanced by those whose
Favorites they pretended to be; so that, upon the whole matter, these Letters,
rightly considered, are rather (as is said before) a manifest Vindication of
the Roman Catholics Innocense, then a Confirmation of the Plot.

Concerning the Death of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, there is nothing to fasten
that Murder on the Roman Catholics, Sir Edmundbury Godfrey's Murder.
but the bare improbable (though gainful) Oaths of two Infamous Persons: The
one ( viz.) Bedlow, notorious for Cheats and Misdemeanors: The other ( viz.)
Prance, self Condemned of Falsehood herein, by the testimony of his own Mouth;
for he once Swore he was an Actor in the said Murder; and soon after before the
King and Council, unswore what he had said, and Protested upon his Salvation,
he knew nothing of it. There are furthermore some remarkable and pressing
circumstances, which the Papists urge in their own defense herein; One is, that
Sir Edmnndbury Godfrey was esteemed by all, a moderate man, and particularly
Indulgent to Catholics. And it is not credible the Papists would Murder their
Friends; especially in a conjuncture of time, when it was to no purpose, not
could any ways Stifle the Discovery of the Plot already made; Nay, when they
could not but see such an Horrid Action, (if known) must needs draw the wrath
and detestation of the whole Nation upon them. The other is, that the whole
(though premeditated) series of this Murder, Page 20.
as it is related by the Witnesses, seems to be involved with innumerable
Absurdities, Contradictions, moral Impossibilities, and Pregnant appearences of
Perjury. The Scene of the Tragedy must be (forsooth) the public Yard of
Somerset House (a place, or rather thorow-fare, of continual intercourse)
within twenty Paces of the Common Guards, where Watch is kept night and day;
The Assassines, to effect their design, must feign a Quarrel, and call Justice
Godfrey out of the Street (a notable Policy) to keep the Peace, though none,
Passengers, Soldiers or Neighbors, perceived any thing of this Tumult. When
they had him in the Yard, they Strangled him with an Hankerchief, (a very
proper Instrument, studied and contrived beforehand, to strangle a Man.) After
the business was done, they let him lie exposed in this open place, half
living, half dead, above a quarter of an hour. At length they dragged him into
a Chamber in Doctor Godwin's Lodgings (a Room attested to be of daily use to
the Servants, never locked, but constantly obvious to all Comers and Goers;)
here they kept him two days, and then carried him through several Courts, into
several Rooms, and Apartments in Somerset House; And having thus (to no
purpose) tossed him up and down from Saturday till Wednesday, they finally
placed him (though stiff and Inflexible) in a Sedan, and carried him to the
Soho, and there set him astride on Horseback, to ride before Hill to the place
where he was afterward found. Bedlow deposes Sir Edmundbury Godfrey was
Throtl'd with a Cravat; Prance Swears it was with an Handkerchief; The names of
the Assassines cited by Bedlow, are Prichard, Welsh, Le Phaire, and other
Jesuits. But the Murderers nominated by Prance, are Green, Hill, Bury, Gyrald
and Kelly; and these two parties are quite different Actors; and as far as
apears by the Evidence, neither their Designs, nor Persons well known to each
other. Prance says, he saw the dead Body very plainly in a low Room, by the
light of a dark Lanthorn, but what was thrown over it, he could not tell; Nor
could he afterward when required, go to the Room where he said he saw it.
Bedlow tells us he refused to have any hand in the Murder, for which cause the
Jesuits, did not acquaint him who it was; yet they showed him the dead Body in
the presence of many, who neither knew him, nor he them; Prance himself further
declared, he never was in Bedlow company, till he came to Prison. The main
Assassines were ignorant of what reward they were to have; But Bedlow (though
no compartner in the Murder,) could tell there were Four Thousand Pounds
ordered, of which Two Thousand Pounds were proffered to him alone, if he would
but assist the rest to convey away the Corpse. This Murder is affirmed to have
been committed on Saturday, the twelfth day of October (78.) at nine a clock at
night; and the Body conveyed away on the Wednesday following, about Midnight.
In direct opposition to which, Hill, Green, and Bury (who were Accused, Tried
and Executed for this Fact,) produced these Witnesses. One Mrs. Tilden and Mrs.
Broadstreet, attested that Hill (who dwelt with them) never kept ill hours, but
always came in by Eight of the Clock; That he could not go out afterward,
because he waited at Table, and the Maid Catherine Lee locked up the doors, and
the Family went not to Bed till Eleven; That particularly he was at home on
Saturday night, when Sir Edmundbury Godfrey is said to be Killed; and on
Wednesday night when carried away. James Warrier attested, That Green (his
Lodger) was in his House and company on Saturday October the 12th. from seven
till after ten at Night, and that he exactly remembered it by his Work. The
three Sentinels, who Successively kept strict Guard on the aforesaid Wednesday
Night, at the great Gate at Somerset House (through which it is affirmed the
Body was carried out in a Sedan) declared there went out that way no Sedan at
any hour whatsoever, from seven a Clock that Night, to four the next Morning;
The Amplitude of which Testimony includes at least three hours immediately
before and after the time Sworn to by Prance and Bedlow. Eury's Maid attested,
That her Master came in that same Wednesday in the Dusk of the Evening; went to
Bed about 12. and could not well after that go out again, without her
knowledge; the passage to his Chamber being through hers. And it is most worthy
of observation, that this Bury was, and professed himself to be (both during
his Imprisonment, and at his very Death,) a Protestant of the Church of
England; Yet this Man, though after Condemnation he was proffered his Life, if
he would own the Fact; Nevertheless absolutely denied it to his last Breath.
And when the very Cart was drawing away from under him, he lifted up his Hands
and said, As I am innocent, so receive my Soul, O Jesus; wherefore if the last
Words of a dying Protestant, who might, but would not live, (by a false
accusation of himself or others,) may be credited; The Papists were innocent of
this Murder, and the forenamed Witnesses Perjured in their Evidence. As for
what is objected about a Letter sent from London to Tixall, etc. It is answered
(supposing such a Letter was really sent and received) That a Letter intimating
the Murder of a Justice of the Peace, might well be Writ from London on
Saturday (when Sir Edmundbury Godfrey was known to be missing) and arrive at
Tixall in Staffordshire, by the common Post on Monday following; Page 87.
And thereupon Dugdale might tell the news the self same day, Page 136.
to diverse Gentlemen at Tixall. What of all this? Where Is the Inference against
the Papists? Yet this is all some Gentlemen seemed to attest, (whilst others
denied,) and all can be necessarily deduced from the receipt of such a Letter;
But that this Justice of the Peace was Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, and that the
Papists had Murdered him, is proved only by the Common tract of Dugdales
peremptory Swearing, without any rational motive of credibility. Thus much of
Sir Edmundbury Godfrey.

As for the Narratives, Fireballs, Sham-Plots, etc.
and from them deduced Stories, of Firing the City, Burning the Navy,
Black-Bills, Fireballs, Sham-Plots, Wild-Irish, Spanish-Pilgrims, with other
the like innumerable Popperies, and known contradictions to wise men; though
they make a dreadful sound amongst the Mobile; yet carry along with them such
an excess of Gross and Ridiculous Nonsense; that to sober understandings they
only serve to demonstrate the Perjury of the Witnesses, and need no Confutation
in Equitable Courts (such as ours are,) no wise disposed per fas and nefas,
without appearance of Justice, to oppress the Innocent.

And whereas it is alleged, The Votes of both Houses of Parliament declaring
it a Plot.
as a main Argument of Popish Guilt, That the two Houses of Parliament have
declared it a Plot; and several Persons in several Courts of Judicature have
been Tried, Condemned, and Executed for it. The Papists answer (with all due
Submission to the Government, in defense of Innocence,) That it is not
Impossible, nor altogether without President, That a Lawful Authority
proceeding Secundum allegata and Probata, should be abused; and consequently
drawn into a Mistake, by the Malice and Perjury of Wicked Men. Those who make
it their study and Trade, to frame Artificial Lies, and have time, assistance,
and all imaginable encouragement and opportunity for it, may easily invent
plausible Stories (with more coherence then any hitherto devised,) such as may
amuse and deceive the most just and prudent Persons; especially in a
conjuncture, when a transporting Zeal to the Protestant, and (as Papists say) a
misconceived prejudice to the Catholic Religion, influenceth the Nation; Nor
have all been Convicted, who were Impeached and Tried upon the Plot, but as
some have been Condemned, so others Impeached upon the same Evidence, and in
the same Courts of Judicature, have been See the Trials of Wakeman, Corker,
Marshal, Earl of Castlemain, Sir Tho. Gascoin, Lady Powis, Tempest, etc.
acquitted, the wickedness and forgery of the Witnesses detected, and their
Depositions rejected, as unworthy of Credit. It is further hoped, the Wisdom,
Justice, and Integrity of the State, will at length discover the whole
Imposture, vindicate the Innocent, and Punish the Injury herein done, to God,
to the King, to the Nation, and to almost all Europe.

To the Instances given of Popish malice, and Bloodiness from former examples,
( viz.) Gunpowder-Treason, French Massacre, etc.
Queen Mary's Cruelties, the Powder Plot, the Irish Barbarism, the French
Massacre, etc. committed by Professed Papists. It is answered, that by the same
reason, and to as good purpose, the Traiterous Seditions, and Outrages in
Germany, France, Bohemia and Holland, Authorized and Fomented by Calvin,
Swinglins, Beza, and other Reformers; the late Bloody Wars in England, the
almost yesterday's Remonstrances, and Practices in Scotland; The even now
actual Rebellion in Hungary, raised and managed by Protestants, for
Protestanizm; But above all, that never to be paralelled, Hellish Murder of the
Lords Anointed, Our glorious Sovereign Charles the first, in cold Blood, by
outward form of Justice, on pretense of Reformation, might be imputed to the
Protestant Religion. For all these now mentioned Horrid Villainies were
committed by Protestants; Protestants who gloried in being more then ordinarily
refined, from Popish Errors and Superstitions. If it be said (as most justly it
may) the Church of England never taught such Practices, the same say, and
protest the Papists in behalf of their Church; But because mere recrimination
is no justification on either side; And for that, a full decision of this heavy
charge, depends much on the right understanding of Roman Catholic
Principles, in matter of obedience to God and the King; We shall treat of this
Subject apart by it self, when we come to examine the Principles of My Lords
Faith and Religion.

Reflections upon the several above cited Depositions of Smith, Dugdale, Oats
and Jenison.
LAstly, The above cited Depositions, respectively made by Smith, Dugdale,
Oats, and Jenison, in proof of the Plot in general, are liable also to diverse
remarkable Exceptions. And the Papists stick not here to say, they wonder how
so many and gross Incongruities, and Falsehoods, attested only by Infamous Men,
could pass for currunt Truths amongst Persons of Justice, Worth, and Prudence.
For instance.

Smith in his Deposition gives us to understand, That being as yet a
Protestant, but troubled it seems with some doubts in matters of Religion; he
applied himself for satisfaction to certain Priests in France; They to settle
his mind told him, They would shortly bring in their Religion into England,
Right or Wrong. (a notable argument to convince a well-meaning Protestant.) But
ne^^er this (as you may well think,) nor all the Jesuits could say, or do ^ould
prevail with him; so that he lived and studied with them several years, (a
likely story) remaining still a professed Protestant, At length the Jesuits
desponding (as well they might) of their own abilities, herein, sent him to be
converted by Cardinal Grimaldi, and he it was did the Feat, which none of the
Priests or Jesuits could compass. The Cardinal (to remove all Scruples from the
tender Conscience of his new Convert; and further to convince his Judgment in
the truth of his Religion,) entertained him one day with this Learned and Pious
discourse, ( viz.) That he had great assurances, the Popish Religion would
prevail in England, and that there was but one in the way, and that to
accomplish their designs, they must take him out of the way. Thus the young Man
being now well confirmed in his Faith, was made a Priest, and sent into England
with Instructions to teach his Contrymen, They were not obliged to obey
their King; and that to Murder him was a Meritorious Act. But the misfortune
was, that arriving in England, he quite mistook his Errand. And though he
continued firm in the belief of the Popish Doctrine and Principles; yet made it
his whole business to root out the Jesuits, (the Popes chief Emissaries,) and
dissuade Roman Catholics from sending Moneys to Colleges beyond Seas.

Dugdale tells us, All the Jesuits Letters containing Damnable Treason, and
sent for the most part by the Common Post, came to his hands, most of which he
saw and read, but could never produce one single Letter. He informs us also of
dreadful Oaths and Sacraments of Secrecy, administered to the Conspirators,
before they were made privy to any dangerous Design; yet with the same breath
declares, there were whole Armies both privy and ready, to a design no less
then of Cutting all the Protestants Throats, throughout the Nation at an hours
warning. Nay he assures us, there was a Free Pardon of all Sins Proclaimed
every where, at the Chapels to all Persons, Men and Women, whosoever would be
active in Killing the King, (a notable way of concealing Secrets.) Is it
possible this fellow should find credit in such gross, such palpable Forgeries.

Oats likewise relates, How that whilst he was Chaplain to the Duke of
Norfolk, the Priests attempted the utmost of their skill, to persuade him out
of his Religion, by telling him, The Church of England was upon it is last Legs.
Surely the Priests took him to be either a notorious Fool or Knave, for
otherwise they might doubtless have devised some more plausible and less
dangerous Argument to convert a Protestant Minister; Yet he feigned to be
convinced by their reasons, and was hereupon presently entertained by the
Jesuits, (the sottish careless Jesuits,) who on a sudden entrusted this
Neophite with all their concerns, made him privy to all their most Damnable
Intrigues; And in short, it is most certain, nothing of Treason, Murder, or
Villainy, was contrived or even thought on, by them, without him; By this means
he became acquainted, not only with the strange adventures of Pickerings loose
Flint, Whipping, Thirty Thousand Masses, etc. But also with the manner of
Firing the City, Introducing Chimerical Armies, French, Irish, Spanish, etc.
Mustered up in the Deposition; Nor is it a wonder the Jesuits should be so rash
in discovering their Secrets to Oats; Seeing he himself (if you will believe
him) here also deposes that some of them were so ^^sperately mad, as to Preach
a public Sermon before a company of ^^dents; wherein the Kings Legitimacy was
vilified and abused; and it was declared, His Majesty's Religion entitled him
to nothing but sudden Death and Destruction. I^ i^ credible a Jesuit or any
other in his wits, should publicly Preach such Black Treason to a Company of
Boys? But what shall we say of the Doctor's tender Conscience and Zeal, in
preserving the King? He tells us here, he only feigned himself a Catholic on
purpose to make Discoveries; (Alas good Man) It was to save His Majesty's life,
made him seem to the Papists what he really was not. Yet (O prodigious
Impudence) he owns at the same time, he was conscious for above a year
together, of the daily attempts made by Groves and Pickering to Shoot the King;
He hourly expected for several Months the horrid effects of Sir George
Wakeman's Poison; Ireland's Trial.
He was privy (as he ad's elsewhere) to the designed Assassination of the King
at Windsor; He knew the Ruffians were actually upon the Place, and ready for
the Villainy; He saw the Money sent to them for their encouragement, and every
moment waited to hear, the fatal stroke was given. Nevertheless this Man of
Conscience, whose watchful Eye so carefully guarded the King's Life, all this
while made no Discovery; Though he knew for certain, that the Pistols were all
ready, even at the King's Breast; The Cup of Poison at his Lips; And the Dagger
almost at his very Heart; Yet he never cried out Murder upon the Lord's
Anointed; never called for immediate Succor; never warned the King of his
Eminent Danger; never diverted the impending mischief; never so much as opened
his Mouth, to disclose any of these horrid Treasons, until such time as the
King might have been killed a thousand times over. Is this the Doctors
Vigilance? Or rather, is it not perfect Demonstration, that all he has Sworn
of the Plot, is damnable Perjury?

Jenison declares, that though he often expressed to Mr. Ireland, an horrid
detestation of Treason and Bloodshed; Yet Ireland (as if he had a mind to hang
himself) was still urging this conscientious Man to Murder the King; and when
he could not prevail with him herein, he would needs have him at last to
nominate some Irish Ruffians, whom he judged most proper for this Execrable
Villainy. And thus far indeed Jenison acknowledges, he condescended. Now one
would think a Man, who had taken so deep an Impression of horror and
detestation of Bloodshed, should have had some scruple in concealing so Hellish
a Design; and much more in nominating the very persons who were to effect it.
But that which seems above all most strange is, the mighty reward the Jesuits
proffered him, in case he would join with the Four Ruffians, in this Devilish
enterprise. Oats informs us, Sir George Wakeman was to have fifteen thousand
pounds to Poison the King, and Groves fifteen hundred for Shooting Him. Dugdale
also assures us, he had not much less promised for the like attempt; Yet when
these Jesuits come to beat the Price with Jenison (though a Man hard to be
wrought upon) they could afford him no more then twenty pounds; and this only
to be remitted of an Old Debt; a wonderful encouragement to a Scrupulous Man,
for so desperate and damned an Exploit.

To conclude this whole matter, The Papists aver, if the Justice and Equity of
their Cause be impartially considered, the Integrity of their Principles
rightly understood, their formerly experienced Loyalty regarded. The contrary
practices of their chiefest Adversaries remembered. The Infamy of the
Witnesses, and Inconsistancy of their Evidence duly weighed, there will remain
no color of proof, or even Suspicion of this fatal Plot, which has already
drawn so much Innocent Blood, and brought no small confusion both to Church and
State.

The Process against my Lord in Particular. 3.
AFter a long and accurate discussion of the Plot in general, The Court
proceeded to take cognizance of what in particular affected my Lord, Page 40.
etc.
the Prisoner at the Bar. In pursuance hereof, the Managers regarding in all
things a Methodical exactness, first demanded before they produced their
Evidence, That none of my Lords Council might stand near to prompt, or advise
him what he should say; or answer, as to matters of Fact, wherewith he was
charged.

Then they began by way of introduction to show, that they had made it out
there was a Plot. The first onset against My Lord.
That this Plot was a general design of the Popish party; That it was not
likely such a design could be carried on, without the Concurrence of Persons of
great Quality. That therefore it was to be presumed, my Lord at the Bar, a
Nobleman, and a Zealous Papist had a share in it; But what that share was, and
how far my Lord was engaged, was to appear from the positive Evidence.

It will not be expected that my Lord, one single Person of 68. years of age,
long imprisoned, no great Rhetorician, nor much versed in the Law, should take
all advantages, improve favorable circumstances, and keep equal measures, in
sharpness of Wit, and effluence of Speech, with his Opponents, who were ten or
twelve of the greatest Lawyers, and ablest Judgments of the Nation; Nor is it
any wonder, if my Lord confounded with the multiplicity of arguments;
astonished at the horror of the objected Crimes, discountenanced by the
Auditory; And (as he acknowledged) half stupefied with continual pleading, day
after day, without intermission; Did sometimes insist upon matters of less, and
omit matters of greater moment, in his own behalf; yet he seemed to manifest
much of candor and sincerity, in all his Comportment, and Addressing himself
to my Lords his Judges, before he began his Plea to the particular Evidence
against him; He spoke to this effect.

That he was much afflicted to see himself accused by so high an Authority, for
a Crime which above all others, My Lords Address. Page 25. etc.
he ever from his heart utterly abhorred; he renounced and detested with much
Exaggeration all Plots against the King and Government; He abjured all
Principles leading to such ends; And disowned all Authority upon Earth, which
might in the least pretend to absolve him from his Allegiance. He further
showed how faithful and affectionate he had been, both to the late King in his
Wars, and to this in his Exile; He declared he had timely notice of his being
Impeached, and thereupon might (if he would) have easily fled; He likewise
acknowledged, That after he was in the Tower, both the King and the House of
Lords had sent him word, That in case he would make a Discovery, though he were
never so Guilty he should have a Pardon; If therefore he had been really
conscious of his own Guilt, and might have secured himself by either of these
means, and would not, he ought to dye for his folly, as well as his Crime. He
professed he had always a natural abhorrence of Bloodshed, insomuch that he
could not wish the death, even of his Adversaries that Swore against him.
Lastly, He desired (as necessary to his defense,) Copies of some Depositions
made by the Witnesses before several Authorities, on several occasions; which
Copies after a long debate upon it, were granted.

Now begin the particular Depositions, of each particular Witness directly
against my Lord, upon which the House of Commons grounded their Impeachment.

To these Depositions as they severally occur, I shall adjoyn my Lords
immediate Answer; And to his Answer, the Mannagers reply, That so both
confusion and unnecessary Repetitions, inconsistent with a Compendium, may be
avoided; Furthermore, because the Mannagers in Summing up their Evidence, made
diverse ingenious Observations, and urged many Reasons to uphold their several
Charges, not mentioned in the body of the Trial. And also for that the Papists
afirm, there was more of flourishing Rhetoric, then strength of Argument in
the said Observations; the order of Law, not premitting my Lord, in the close
of the Trial to Rejoyn upon them. I shall (to give the best satisfaction I can
to all parties) annex here the plain Substance, both of the said Mannagers
Observations, and the Papists Answers, as they respectively occur, to each
particular Evidence.

Dugdale's Deposition against my Lord.
THe first Witness that gave Evidence to the particular Impeachment, was
Stephen Dugdale, who Swore:

That at a certain meeting held at Tixal in Staffordshire, about the latter
end of August, or the beginning of September; (78.) My Lord did (together with
the Lord Aston and others, Page 24. etc.
in the presence of Dug-dale) give his deliberate full consent, To take away
the Kings Life, and Introduce the Popish Religion. That on the 20th. or 21st.
of September (78.) in the forenoon, my Lord then residing at Tixal, sent for
him the said Dugdale to his Chamber, by one of his Servants, either his
Gentleman or Page, whilst he was dressing; That when he came in, my Lord sent
out his Servants, and being there alone together; my Lord offered him 500 l.
for his Charges and Encouragement, to take away the Kings Life, And farther
told him He, should have free Pardon of all his Sins, and should be Sainted;
For the King had been Excommunicated, and was likewise a Traitor and a Rebel,
and an enemy to Jesus Christ.

My Lords Exceptions.
TO this Deposition my Lord made several grand Exceptions. Dugdal 's Infamy and
Beggary.
The first was, That Dugdale was a Person of an Infamous Life. That he had
Cheated the Lord Aston his Master, and defrauded Workmen and Servants of their
Wages. That by his Extravagancies and Misdemeanors, he had run himself into
several hundred pounds Debt; for which he was thrown into Goal, and despaired
of ever getting out from thence, otherwise then by making the pretended
Discoveries. For proof of all which my Lord produced these Witnesses.

Mr. Sandbidge, An old Man, Page 94. etc.
and a Protestant attested, That Dugdale was a Knave, and notoriously known,
both by him and all the Country to be a Wicked Man.

Thomas Sawyer attested, Page 84. etc.
Dugdale went from My Lord Astons, involved in deep Debts; That whilst he was
Bailiff to My Lord Aston, he received and placed to My Lord's Account, several
Work-mens Wages, which he never paid to the said Workmen; Whereupon great
Clamours and Complaints were made of him in the Country; That being Arrested
for Debt, My Lord Aston would not own him for his Servant, at which Dugdale
Swore He would be revenged on him.

The same thing as to Dugdales sinister dealing, Page 87. etc.
His being in Debt, Imprisoned, and Disowned by the Lord Aston, were attested
by Sir Walter Baggot, Mr. Whitby, a Justice of Peace, and Mr. Phillips Minister
of Tixal.

From hence my Lord drew a second Iuference, ( viz) That had the Lord Aston,
and the rest been Guilty, (as Dugdale accused them,) It was highly improbable,
the said Lord should adventure to exasperate, discard, and leave to Goal and
Ruin, a man, at whose mercy they all lay, and who might to retreive his
desperate fortune, by making Discoveries, utterly destroy both their Designs
and them.

To confront the Testimony of the foregoing Witnesses, the Mannagers produced
others in favor of Dugdale; And as to the matters of his Debts and Beggary.

Mr. Noble, Page.145. etc.
Stephen College, (the Protestant Joyner, lately Executed for High Treason at
Oxford) and Mr. Boson a Lawyer, deposed, That at Dugdale's entreaty, they went
with him to the Tower, to assist him in adjusting his Accounts with the Lord
Aston, but could not accomplish it, by reason my Lord would not, (till the
return of a certain Counselor out of the Country,) let them see a Book,
wherein Dugdale said his Discharges were; And that Dugdale told them, my Lord
Aston was Indebted to him (things rightly stated) two hundred pounds.

To this my Lord Stafford replied, He should have something to say; And desired
the Lord Aston might be admitted to give an account of this matter; But it was
answered, That the Lord Aston stood Indicted for the same Treason, and could
not be a Witness.

Then my Lord desired Mr. Lieutenant of the Tower might speak what he knew.
Page 163.
Hereupon Mr. Lieutenant declared, That the Lord Aston would have come to an
account with Dugdale in his (the Lievtenants) presence; But that Dugdale put it
off, and said he would come some other time; but from that time to this, he
never heard of him.

UPon these Testimonies the Mannagers made these following Observations*
Page.175.
First, It was manifest from several Circumstances, that Dugdale went not away
from Tixal for Debt, (as seems here to be pretended,) but for fear of being
apprehended for the Plot, which argues he was then Conscious of his own Guilt
in that matter. Secondly, Whereas Sawyer attests, that Dugdale Swore he would
be revenged on my Lord Aston, because he would not own him for his Servant,
when Arrested for Debt; If this were true, yet seeing this Revenge was not
intended against my Lord Stafford, but against my Lord Aston; It is Impertinent
to be urged against Dugdale's present Evidence.

To which the Papists Answer. To the first, It is no wonder, if at a time when
Roman Catholics were universally suspected and persecuted on account of the
Plot; Dugdale though not Conscious of any Guilt, either in himself or others;
Yet being then a Catholic, and hitherto undetermined to set up for an
Evidence, was in some apprehensions of coming into trouble, and might
therefore withdraw upon that Score. But what is that to the present purpose? Is
it not also undeniably proved here. That Dugdale was in Debt: That for Debt he
was Arrested and Imprisoned: That for his Misdemeanors, and not for Religion he
was discarded by his Master; That at last Beggary had surrounded him, Revenge
possessed him, and Desperation Seized him. If this has been clearly proved,
it is no hard matter to judge what was his end and aim in making his
Discoveries; And my Lords further Inferences hereupon are Soild and Good* To
the second, The Evidence given of Dugdale's Revenge, was not produced as if the
said Revenge was chiefly intended against my Lord Stafford, but only to show
that Dugdale was now upon the point of bidding adieu to Conscience and Honesty,
And desirous to satisfy at once, both his Malice, and Penury; He contrived his
Plot (after the Model given him by Oats and Bedlow) wherein he Accused some
out of Revenge, and others, (amongst whom my Lord Stafford) as the most proper
Persons, to complete the Number of Actors in his Tragic Farce.

IN defense of Dugdale's Reputation in point of Honesty. Page.147.
Mr. Whitby declared, That Dugdale had been long my Lord Aston's Servant,
received my Lord's Rents, made his Bargains, and Governed the rest of the
Family: That he dealt honestly with him; That he had heard indeed some
Tradesmen complain he put them off without Money, and would not pay them: But
that my Lord would hear nothing against him.

William Southal a Coroner deposed, that he knew no ill of Mr. Dugdale, that he
was the Lord Aston's Bailiff, and had a good repute with all those People who
had dependence on the Family; But that he himself never had any business with
him. Then he (the said Southal) gave a large relation how he had persuaded
Dugdale (being then in Custody for Debt) to Discover the Plot; By putting him
in mind of his Duty and Allegiance to the King; and assuring him, If he would
make a timely Discovery, he should not only obtain his Majesty's Gracious
Paerdon, but also a Reward of Two Hundred Ponnds. By force of which Argument,
Dugdale at last assented to make Discoveries; And accordingly gave in his
several Depositions, first in the Country before two Justices of the Peace,
afterward before the Council; and lastly before the two Houses of Parliament.

Concerning this Southal, the Lord Ferrers informed the Court, Page 163.
That he had been very active against the King in the late Wars, and had the
Repute of a Pernicious Man against the Government.

To Impugn which Information, the Lord Brook declared in behalf of Southal,
Page 168.
that his Mother had employed him, and found him honest in their Affairs; And
Mr. Gower farther testified, That he found Southal extraordinarily zealous in
prosecuting the Papists.

UPon these Evidences, the Mannagers made these Observations, First, Mr. Whitby
not only declares, that Dugdale had dealt honestly by him; But that my Lord
Aston himself would hear nothing against him. Secondly, It is not always the
Stewards fault, if Workmen to great Persons sometimes want their Wages.
Thirdly, Mr. Southal an understanding and zealous man, had (with much
difficulty and strong Arguments,) the good fortune* at last to succeed, in
parswading Mr. Dugdale to make a fair and plain Discovery of the whole Plot, to
the great happiness, not only of Mr. Dugaale, but of the whole Nation

To which the Papists Answer: To the first, Though Dugdale perhaps dealt
honestly with Mr. Whitby, yet he might be a Knave, and deal dishonestly with
other People for all that. And if my Lord Aston refused to hear any thing
against him, this very refusal argues there were Complaints made of him; And my
Lord himself, in time both gave Ear to his Crimes, and Discarded him for them,
as is already proved. To the second, Those Stowards who receiving Moneys of
their Masters, to pay poor Laborers their Wages, shall (as Dugdale did)
Defrand them of it* the better to defray their own Extravagant Expenses, are no
honest Men. To the third, The Papists do not understand, to what purpose this
Testimony of Southal's is here produced; for it is granted, That Dugdale being
in Goal, and brought to extremity, did after much struggling and reluctance of
Conscience, abandon his Soul to Perjury; And conceiving fair hopes of Success,
by the prosperous adventures of Oats and Bedlow, by the present promise of 200
l. and by the persuasion of Southal, a notorious Cromwellian, at last plunged
himself into deep and horrid Oaths, not only incredible, but morally impossible
to be true.

THe second weighty Exception made by my Lord against Dugdale's Deposition was,
Dugdale's Perjury.
That he had directly and palpably Perjured himself, in diverse parts and
circumstances of his said Deposition. For instance of this,

First, Dugdale now Swears, He had an exact knowledge, and deep concern in the
Plot. He was not only a Confident, but an Assistant in raising Armies, Killing
the King, etc. Now my Lord proved by several Irrefragable Witnesses; That the
said Dugdale had before at sundry times, and on sundry occasions, with dreadful
Oaths and Execrations, professed he knew nothing of any such thing. The
Witnesses were these.

Sir Walter Baggot and Mr. Kinnersley, both Parliament Men, Page 87. etc.
Attested; That Dugdale being Examined before them, and other Justices of the
Peace, though he then took the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy in their
Presence, yet absolutely denied any knowledge of the Plot.

Mr. Whitgrave also a Justice of the Peace, Attested, that he earnestly Pressed
and Encouraged Dugdale to make a Discovery of what he knew; telling him, Now he
had taken the Oaths, they looked upon him as one of them; and that he would do
him all the Kindness he could: To which Dugdale answered, Truly for his part,
though he had the misfortune to Live amongst Papists, yet he never liked their
Religion. Then Mr. Whitgrave urged him home, saying, Sir you may do your self a
kindness, and oblige your King and Country: I am confident you know of this
Horrid Plot; pray do not stifle your Conscience with an Oath of Secrecy: Let it
come out; Dugdale replied, as he hoped to be saved, be knew nothing of it.

Thomas Sawyer Attested, That two or three days before Dugdale began to
Impeach, being then at Stafford under the Sergeants Hands for Debt, he took a
Glass of Drink in the presence of Sawyer, and said, Thomas, I wish this may be
my Damnation, and my Poison, if I know of any Plot or Priest.

UPon these Evidences the Mannagers made this Observation, Page 175.
( viz.) That Dugdale 's denying, and with Execrations forswearing any
knowledge of the Plot, is no manner of Objection; for he Forswore it at a time,
when he never intended to reveal it, and was in danger of his own Life; but
afterward he changed his mind, and discovered all to Southal, and others.

To which the Papists answer: It is very strange, so palpable a Perjury proved
upon Dugdale by so Substantial Witnesses, in the whole System and Essence of
his Testimony, should be so slightly evaded. Is it no manner of Objection to
prove that Dugdale is Forsworn in his whole Discovery? Must Credit be given to
the Depositions of a man, in a matter, whereof he himself with dreadful Oaths
and Execrations has often protested the contrary? Is the Conviction of Perjury
by the Testimony of his own Mouth nothing? Why? because out of fear in his
former Oaths, he never intended to Swear Truth. Is this a Rational answer? Nay
is it not rather perfectly demonstrative from what is already proved; that for
Fear, for Lucre, for Revenge, for Liberty, this man has actually Sworn to
express Coniradictions, and will not stick upon the same motives to Swear any
thing.

SEcondly, Dugdale had determinately Sworn at Sir George Wakeman's Trial (as my
Lord proved by two Substantial Witnesses, Page 74.
the Lady Marchioness of Winchester, and Madam Howard) that the Meeting or
Consult at Tixal, mentioned in the Deposition, wherein my Lord is said to have
been present, and Consenting to the Killing of the King; was held precisely in
the Month of August (78.) Now my Lord proved he never was at or near Tixal
during that whole Month; nor came thither till the 12th of September following.
This he showed by giving an exact Account where he was, every Week and Day
throughout that Month. The Witnesses who gave respective Evidence to each
particular time and place, were, the Marquess of Worcester, the Marchioness of
Winchester, Mr. Bonny, White and Bevan, Servants to the said Marquess.

UPon those Testimonies, page 147.
the Mannagers made these Observations: First, The two Ladies who gave Evidence
to Dugdale's words spoken at Sir George Wakeman's Trial, were Roman Catholics
and Relations to my Lord. Secondly, They did not agree in their Evidence with
one another. The Lady Marchioness saying, Dugdale Swore that my Lord Stafford
was to come down into Staffordshire in June or July, and was present at the
Consult at Tixal in August. Madam Howard saying, Dugdale Swore my Lord Stafford
did come down into Stafforashire in June or July; and was present at the
Consult at Tixal in August. Thirdly, The said Ladies having much concern upon
them for Sir George Wakeman the Popish Physician, they might easily mistake in
what they heard. Fourthly, in the Printed Trial; There are no such words of
Dugdale's mentioned.

To which the Papists answer: To the first, The two Ladies, though Roman
Catholics, are persons of that Quality and known Virtue, as admit of no
Comparison in point of Credit with the Witnesses produced against my Lord. That
to Vilify my Lord's Witnesses because Roman Catholics, is contrary to Law, and
denotes an Exasperated mind, willing to deprive Catholics of a Just Defense.
To the second, The different manner or Phrase the Ladies used in expressing
themselves in point of Circumstance, is not at all material, seeing they both
jointly agree, and determinately Attest; That Dugdale Swore my Lord was at
Tixal in August, and then and there present at the Consult. Which was the
Substantial thing wherein my Lord proves him Perjured. To the Third, A deep
concern occasioneth an Attention rather then a Mistake: And a pretense of a
mistake in a positive Witness, is an Evasion, whereby any Verbal Testimony
whatsoever may be eluded. To the Fourth, Catholics have Experience that many
considerable matters have been omitted, or otherwise inserted in the Printed
Trials, to the disadvantage of their Cause: And as those Printed Copies, though
pleaded, were never allowed to be good Evidence for them, so ought they not to
be alleged against them.

THirdly, page. 83. etc
Dugdale Swears in his Deposition: That at Tixal on the 20th. or 21th. of
September (78.) My Lord sent for him by one of his Servants to his Chamber, in
the Morning whilst he was Dressing; (which Servant also Dugdale Swears, was
either Mr. Furnesse my Lords Gentleman, or George Leigh his Page:) And that
when Dugdale came into the Chamber, my Lord sent out his said Servants; and
being thus with him alone, Offered him five hundred Pounds to Kill the King. In
direct opposition to these particulars, my Lord proved, by the Attestation of
the self same Servants, Mr. Furnesse and George Leigh; that he never sent for
Dugdale, never was with him alone in his Chamber; nor never dismissed his
Servants for that end, all that Morning. For the evincing of which,

Mr. Furnesse my Lords Gentleman Attested: page. 80, etc*
That he about eight a Clock that Morning, coming to my Lords Chamber, met
Dugdale in the Hall. Dugdale desired him he would Entreat my Lord to Intercede
to the Lord Aston his Master in his behalf, that he might go to Etching Race:
Hereupon Furnesse went into my Lords Chamber, and having spoken to my Lord, as
Dugdale desired, my Lord bid him be called in; accordingly Furnesse conducted
Dugdale into the Chamber; when he came in, my Lord asked him several questions
about the Race, telling him, he himself would bett Twenty Pounds for
Staffordshire sake; Then, after some discourse to this purpose, my Lord
Stafford told him, he would speak to his Lord for him; during all which time
Furnesse was present in the Chamber, together with my Lord and Dugdale, and
heard the discourse between them. When Dugdale had obtained his request, he
went out of my Lord's Chamber, leaving Furnesse still there; my Lord also as
soon as he was dressed went out of his Chamber to my Lord Aston, to ask him leave
for Dugdale; bidding Furnesse make himself ready to go to the Race. Furnesse
accordingly made himself ready about Nine a Clock, and coming down the
Back-stairs my Lord Stafford met him: Go (says he) to Etching-hill, and see
what Betts there are, and take Stephen Dugdale along with you to show you the
way, for I have asked his Lord leave for him to go: Upon this Dugdale having
now leave, went along with Furnesse to the Stable, and took Horse; Furnesse his
Horse was not ready, but he overtook Dugdale within half a Mile, and they
arrived at the Race together about twelve a Clock: My Lord himself (with other
persons of Quality) came to the Race not long after, and returned back to Tixal
about seven at Night.

The same Mr. Furnesse and George Leigh both Attested, that my Lord never sent
either of them for Dugdale; that he never bid them go out of the Chamber, or
absent themselves whilst Dugdale alone remained with him: No, nor did they know
that my Lord was ever alone with Dugdale, either that Morning, or in his whole
Life.

To Infringe the last Particle of this last Evidence, the Mannagers produced
these Witnesses.

Mr. Hanson Deposed; Page 132, etc.
That he once saw Dugdale with my Lord in the Parlour at Tixal; but durst not
be positive whether they were alone or not.

William Ansell Deposed, That passing through the Court at Tixal, he saw my
Lord walking with Dugdale; That he heard no Discourse between them; That there
might be more in the Company, but he saw no more: And lastly added, that
talking one day with Dugdale about the Plot, Dugdale answered: God Blast him if
he knew any thing of it.

UPon these Evidences the Mannagers made these Observations. Page 174.
First, My Lords two Witnesses, Furness and Leigh, were his own Servants.
Secondly, They were very positive in a matter hard to remember, (viz) That
Dugdale never was in my Lords Company: And therefore that easy Credit should
not be given to them, but rather to Hanson and Ansell, who both Swear, that
they have seen my Lord and Dugdale together.

To which the Papists answer: These common Sophismes and weak Objections made
to the Convincing Evidence here given by my Lord in Confutation of the main
matter laid to his Charge, argue the Mannagers at a loss for an Answer. To the
first, Whom could my Lord produce but his Servants, to contradict the Falsities
of a man that pretends to have heard him speak Treason whilst he was Dressing
in his Bedchamber? Are Ponest Servants, because Servants no good Witnesses? To
the second; Though it should be granted that at other times* and upon other
occasions, Dugdale might have been in my Lord's Company, either unknown to his
Servants, or not remembered by them, or even by my Lord himself, (which is the
utmost of what the Testimony of Hanson and Ansell can amount to) yet this does
not at all weaken my Lord's Evidence, nor clear Dugdale from Perjury herein:
For the chief things which my Lord*s two Servants well remembered, distinctly
Attested, and by most remarkable Circumstances fully proved; was, That my Lord
did not send either of them for Dugdale; nor was Dugdale alone with my Lord in
his Chamber, on the 21th* of September in the Morning: On all which particulars
Dugdale laid the Stress of his Evidence; and here it is, he is directly
Perjured.

FOurthly Dugdale at the forenamed Trial of Sir George Wakeman positively Swore
(as my Lord proved by two Witnesses, Mr. Gyfford and Mr. Lydcot, both present
at the said Trial,) That he the said Dugdale, having received a Letter on the
14th. of October, which mentioned the death of a Justice of Peace, did the same
day at an Alehouse in Tixal, impart the Contents of the said Letter to Mr.
Sambidge, Kinsman to my Lord Aston, And Mr. Philips, Minister of Tixal; And
that they answered, They heard nothing of it before. Now to confute this, my
Lord produced for Witnesses the same Mr. Sambidge and Mr. Philips.

Mr. Sambidge protested upon his Salvation, Dugdale never told him any such
thing; Nor did he ever hear of it, till the Friday or Saturday Sir Edmundbury
Godfrey was found at Bury-Hill.

Mr. Philips attested, That he never heard of it, either by Letter or Word of
Mouth, from Dugdale or any other, till the death of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey was
publicly known. To balance this Evidence, the Mannagers produced these
Witnesses.

Mr. Ansel deposed, That at the Alehouse, and day above named, he heard Mr.
Dugdale mention the death of a Justice of Peace; Mr. Sambidge and Mr. Philips
being then both in the House, but not in the same Room with Ansel, when Dugdale
told the News.

William Hanson deposed; That at the time and place aforesaid, he heard Dugdale
say, There was a Justice of Peace Murdered, that lived at Westminster; And that
when Dugdale told this News, Mr. Sambidge, and Mr. Philips were by, and might
have heard it, if they would.

Mr. Birch and Mr. Turton both attested, That about the fifteenth or sixteenth
of the same October, the news of Sir Edmundbury Godfreys Death, was spread
about the Country, and seemed to take its first rise from Tixal.

UPon these several Evidences, Page. 177.
the Mannagers made these Observations. First, Mr. Sambidge was something deaf,
and might not here when Dugdale told him the news of the Death of a Justice of
Peace. Secondly, Mr. Phillips the Parson* being perhaps very Studious in his
Employment, might be wanting in point of Memory. Page 175.
Thirdly, The other Witnesses produced in Confirmation of Dugdel's Evidence,
make it our, that he did impart the news at the time, place, and in the
presence of the parties abovementioned.

To which the Papists answer. To the first, If what the Mannagers allege be
true, then is Dugdale here also proved Perjured by the Mannagers themselves;
For he expressly Swore at the said Trial of Sir George Wakeman, That Mr.
Sambidge both heard and answered him. Saying, He heard nothing of the news
before. To the second, No honest man affirms or denies any past words or
actions, but according as he remembers; and to pretend want of Memory in a
direct Evidence, is the common Road, whereby to evade all humane Testimony. To
the third, The other Witnesses on behalf of Dugdale, do in no sort make out the
thing for which they are produced; For Ansel does not own, that Philips and
Sambidge were so much as in the same Room with Dugdale, when he mentioned the
death of a Justice of Peace. Hanson indeed (herein contradicting Ansel) tells
us they were in the Room, but could not say they heard, much less answered, to
the discourse of Dugdale; which is the chief matter of Perjury here charged
upon him. As for what Mr. Birch and Turton declared, concerning the Rumor soon
after spread of the death of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, it nothing at all
Enervates the present proof of Perjury, seeing it may well be true, there was
such a report, and yet false, that Dugdale had such a discourse with Sambidge
and Philips, as he positively Swears, and they both as positively deny. But
enough has been already said upon this Subject, where we treated of the Death
of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey.

FIfthly, Dugdale in an Information given upon Oath, Swore; That presently
after one Howard, Almoner to the Queen went beyond the Seas, he was told by
George Hobson, then Servant to the Lord Aston, That there was a Design intended
for the Reformation of the Government to the Popish Religion. Now it was owned
and acknowledged in Court, point blank contrary to this Information: That the
said Hobson was not Servant to the Lord Aston, nor known by Dugdale, three
years after the departure of the said Almoner out of England.

UPon this proof of Dugdale's Perjury the Mannagers made this observation, Page
178.
( viz) That Dugdale's words cited in the Information, are capable of two
senses, either they may import, Hobson told him there was a Design ever since
the Almoner went away; Or they may import, Hobson told him presently after the
Almoner went away, there was a Design; The first sense may refer to the matter
told: The second to the time when told: The words taken in the first sense,
argue no contradiction in Dugdale's Testimony.

To which the Papists answer: The words of the Information taken in their
plain, obvious and connatural sense, clearly import; Hobson related to Dugdale,
there was a Design, which relation Hobson made to Dugdale presently after the
time one Howard went beyond the Seas; Nor can any other construction be put
upon the words, without manifestly wresting them from their Genuine
signinification, as every impartial Reader may see; So that the proof here
given of Dugdales Perjury is unanswerable.

THe third main Exception made by my Lord against Dugdale's Deposition,
Dugdales Subornation of Oaths.
was, That he, being conscious of his ill grounded Evidence, had endeavored to
Suborn diverse Persons, to make false Oaths; That so he might strenghten his
own, by others Perjury. To make good this Exception.

Samuel Holt a Protestant, Page 90. etc.
attested, That Dugdale desiring to speak privately with him, told him, If he
would Swear that Walter Moore carried Mr. Evers away, he would give him Forty
Pounds; bidding him not be afraid to Swear for fear of my Lord Aston, for he
would hire him an Horse to get to London, and place him so, that where he now
got one Shilling, he should then get Five.

William Robinson attested, That meeting with Dugdale about a twelve month ago,
he the said Dugdale perceiving Robinson to be then Dejected and Poor;
endeavored to corrupt him, by giving him a Treat, and assuring him, He should
not want Money, if he would please to be ruled by him; Then he took an
Handkerchief out of his Pocket, wherein there seemed to be about ten pounds,
and bid him, If he wanted, take Money there. And lastly told him, He could
furnish him with Money, and put him in a way to get Money, if he would come in
as Evidence against my Lord Stafford; Which Robinson refused to do, not knowing
my Lord, or any thing of him.

John Morral a Barber, gave attestation in these words, Mr. Dugdale, the 6th.
of August last was twelve month, sent for me to the White Horse in Ridgley; and
there when I came to him, he told me, I knew as much of the Plot as he: I told
him, I was Innocent of the thing; He Swore, God dam him, I knew as much as he.
Then I told him, If he knew no more of it then I did, he knew no more then my
Lord Mayors great Horse did. Then he took me aside; Come ( said he) you are a
poor Man, and Live poorly, I can put you in a way whereby you may Live
Gallantly; I will give you Fifty Pounds in hand, if so be you will Swear
against Mr. Howard, Sir James Simmons, Mr. Herbert Aston, and other Gentlemen
of the Country; that they were at such Meetings, at Mr. Herbert Astons upon
the Conspiracy of the Plot.

To take off the Credit of the two first Witnesses in this matter, ( viz.) Holt
and Robinson (nothing material being objected against Morral or his Evidence,)
the Mannager*s produced Witnesses to prove they were Persons of evil reputation.

Against Holt, one Sampson Rawlins a Tailor Deposed, that Holt was a Drunken
lewd Fellow; That he heard him say, There were none but Rogues would take
Dugdale's part; That he stole some Bottles of Wine out of my Lord Astons
Celler; That he called him the said Rawlins Rogue, because he came up in His
Majesty's Service; and would have Murdered him, because he took Dugdales part.

Against Robinson, Page 138. etc.
the Earl of Macklesfield, and Mr. Booth a Parliament Man, both Deposed, That
Robinson was a Person of evil and profane Conversation, making a practice of
Cheating at Dice, Cock-fighting, etc. That he owned himself, upon Examination,
to be a Rogue; And had no other employment or Livelihood.

To these unquestionable Evidences against Robinson, my Lord replied, He knew
nothing of Robinson before; and added, It was very observable, That Dugdale
knowing, it seems his Friend and Comrade Robinson to be a Cheat, and then in
want, thought him a tool fittest for his purpose, the most easily prevailed
upon, and most proper to make a Knight of the Post. So that the two last worthy
Witnesses, did by their Evidence, rather confirm then lessen the belief of
Dugdale's Tampering with Robinson herein.

UPon these several Evidences, the Mannagers made these Observations: First, It
was not likely, that Dugdale a stranger to Robinson, should attempt to Suborn
him to Swear against a Person he knew not, and in a matter whereof he was
wholly Ignorant. Secondly, It does not appear, that Dugdale had any ill will to
Moore, that should induce him to Suborn Holt to Swear against him. Thirdly,
Both Robinson and Holt were Infamous Men; the one being a Common Cheat, the
other a Drunken Quarrelsom Fellow, and seeming to favor the Plotters.
Fourthly, Morral was but a Poor Barber, of no Reputation, and one who might
easily be brought to say what he did.

To which the Papists answer: To the first, Robinson was no Stranger to
Dugdale; He was (as the Earl of Macklesfeild and Mr. Booth attested) every
where about Staffordshire, remarkably known for Cheating at Dice,
Cock-sightings, Races, etc. (exercises also frequent with Dugdale himself;) Nor
is it material that Robinson knew not my Lord Stafford, nor any thing of him:
It was not Dugdale's* business to find out a Man, who to discharge a good
Conscience would Swear what he knew; But who to get Money would Swear what he
knew not; For which purpose Dugdale had good reason to think Robinson a very
proper Instrument. To the second, It is plain matter of Fact, that Dugdale
having accused and Imprisoned Moore for carrying away E^ers, but not able to
prove it, he would have hired Holt to make out his false accusation. To the
third, If Robinson and Holt were Cheats and Rogues, my Lord well inferred, they
were the more likely to be chosen by Dugdale for such Employments as he had for
them* Though for Holt, the greatest offense laid to his Charge seems to be,
that he Quarrelled with Dugdale's Witnesses, as thinking no honest Man would
take his part. To the fourth, Though Morral was Poor, yet it does not appear
but that he was so honest, as not to be Suborned to Perjury by Dugdale; And
therefore his clear and positive Evidence in this matter ought to stand good.
But let it be granted, what the Mannagers contest for, ( viz*) That because
Morral was Poor, Holt Quarrelsome, and Robinson Infamous; none of these three
Witnesses ought to be believed; What then will become of all the Kings
Witnesses? (as they term them,) What shall we believe or say of them? Are they
Persons of Repute, Riches, and Honor? Are they not rather the Scum and Refuse
of the Nation? Why must credit be denied to Beggars or Knaves, when they accuse
their Coequals in probable matters? without hopes of Gain? And yet the same
credit be allowed to the like Beggars and Knaves, when they Swear against
Persons of Honor, Moral impossibilities and contradictions upon large hopes
and promises of reward? This the Papists take to be hard measure.

TO Counterpoise in some sort this charge of Subornation laid to Dugdale. The
Mannagers alleged the like proceedings on my Lords side: To prove which,

Thomas Launder deposed, That my Lord Astons Friends had Summoned him up to my
Lord Astons Trial, to give Evidence against Ansel and Dugdale; and that he was
to have an Horse to ride on, and Money in his Pocket.

Simon Wright, Barber to Dugdale, deposed, That Mr. Plessington told him, If he
could find a way to take off Dugdale's Evidence, or Destory him, he should have
seven hundred pounds. And that the said Plessington and others, would have had
him Swear point blank, That Dugdale would have hired him to give Evidence
against Mrs. Price, and Mr. Tasborough.

My Lord at once to confound this man, by his own Testimony, and further to
detect the Subornation of Dugdale also in this matter; produced a Letter or
Paper, Writ and Signed by Wright himself to Sir James Simmons: In these words,

I can, I bless God* with a safe conscience declare, upon Oath; That Mr.
Dugdale has been unkind to me, in taking his opportunity of my poverty; By
reason of a private meeting of us two by his appointment; He did at that time
proffer, If I would Swear against You, and Mr. Gerrard, he would Protect me as
one of the Kings Evidence, and I should not want Money. And in the Hall at
Westminster, he said, if I did discover it that day at Mrs. Price 's Trial, he
would set me in the Pillory. This I have owned to his Face, and shall not go
back from this, and more, for fear, nor favor. So I rest as you shall find by
your Servant:

Simon Wright.


This Letter Wright acknowledged to be his own Hand word for word* But said,
Plessington and others had persuaded him to Write it. Thus the Man Swearing and
Vnswearing contradictions against himself; My Lord only replied, See what you
have under his own hand, I have no more to say to him.

UPon this diversity of Evidence, the Mannagers made this Observation, ( viz.)
That the Attempts made to Silborn Launder and Wright, were manifest Signs my
Lords Agents endeavored by Sinister ways to vindicate his Cause.

To which the Papists answer. It is not conceivable how the Evidence given by
Launder and Wright can draw the least suspision of Subornation on my Lord or
his Friends: For the Proposal made to Launder was by my Lord Aston's Friends,
and in behalf of my Lord Aston, and not of my Lord Stafford. Besides the words
understood with that Candor and Sincerity they seem to have been spoken by my
Lord Aston's Friends, import no more then this. That if Launder would like an
Honest man, give True Testimony of what he knew against Ansel and Dugdale, at
my Lord Aston's intended Trial at London; his necessary Expenses should be
born, and the convenience of an Horse provided for his Journey thither. Where Is
the Subornation here? As for Wright indeed, he is a person of that Matchless
worth, and has given so clear proofs, both of his own unshaken Integrity, and
Dugdale's Innocence; that he has highly d^^erved the Title, Credit, Dignity,
and other the Emoluments of an Associate to the King's Evidence. In fine, he
has said so much both for himself and Dugdale, the Papists know not what, or
how to say more.

THe last great Exception made by my Lord against Dugdale's Deposition was:
That Dugdale Swore in this very Trial, Dugdale 's Improbable manner of
Swearing. Page 22.
the Jesuits had Entrusted him with all their Letters, that there came to his
Hands whole Packets to and from several persons, in several places, all
containing most Damnable Treason; many of which, he said, he opened, read and
knew the Contents: Yet though the preserving two or three; nay, even one single
Letter, under the Authors hand, might have been so highly advantageous to the
proving the Truth, both of his own Evidence, and the whole Plot in general:
Nevertheless he could not produce one Scrip or Line to back his Assertion, or
clear himself from the Forgeries laid to his charge.

To obviate this Exception; the Mannagers brought in two Sisters, Elizabeth and
Anne Elder: These Sisters Deposed; That Dugdale coming one day to their House
with several Bundles of Papers in his Pockets and Breeches, desired them to
Burn them; saying, the Times were troublesome, and he being to Travel to diverse
places, if he were taken people would think him a Plotter, having all those
Papers about him: That hereupon Elizabeth Burnt all the Papers, except one
Book, concerning which Anne asked Dugdale, whether or no that also should be
Burnt? He answered no, lay that by, it may do good seven years hence; There is
no Treason in it. Elizabeth replied, Is there any thing of Treason in the
others? He said, Do you think there is? Elizabeth further Deposed; She did see
Mr. Dugdale take a Glass of Sider, and hear him say, and Wish it might be his
Damnation; and he might Sink in the place where he stood, if he knew any thing
of the Plot.

FRom the Testimony of these two Sisters, the Managers drew these Inferences.
First Dugdale 's Fears and Apprehensions in Burning so many Bundles of Papers,
denote there were matters contained in them, which if known, would have
Discovered the Plot. Secondly, When the Question was proposed to Dugdale,
whether his Little Book should be Burnt or no: He answered; No, There was no
Treason in it; which Ambiguous manner of Expression, argues there was something
of Treason in the other Bundles.

To which the Papists answer. To the first, it is not Credible; that Dugdale as
yet a Catholic should bring to an Alehouse, and deliver to two Women, in the
very heat of the Discovery of the Plot, his Pockets and Breeches full of
Papers, containing High Treason: Surely he might with more Secrecy and Safety,
have Burnt them in his Chamber. But in short, if what the Women Attest be True;
it is very easy to learn from the very words of Dugdale himself, the reason
why he brought, and caused to be Burnt those useless Writings, ( viz.) Not
because there was any Treason in them, but because the Times, (as he said)
being Troublesome, such Bundles of Papers found about a Traveling Papist,
though never so Innocent, would afford matter of Search, and Suspicion of his
being a Plotter. To the second, Why should we amuse our selves or others with
extorted Inferences drawn from Ambiguous Expressions here; none surely knows
Dugdale's mind better then Dugdale himself; we have his words Attested by this
very Witness, to declare his meaning, let him tell us in plain English his own
Sentiment in this Affair. I wish (says he) this may be my Damnation, and that
I may sink in the place where I stand, if I know any thing of the Plot. Now let
the World judge of Dugdale and his meaning.

Titus Oates's Deposition against my Lord.
THe next Witness that gave Evidence to the Impeachment against my Lord, Page
46, etc.
was Titus Oats, who Swore, That in the year (77.) whilst he remained in
Spain, and at St. Omers, he saw several Letters Signed Stafford, wherein my
Lord assured the Jesuits of his Fidelity and Zeal, in promoting the Catholic
Design. That in the year (78.) The said Oats being then in London, my Lord
came to the Chamber of one ^enwick a Jesuit now Executed, and there received a
Commission from him in Oats's presence, to be Pay- Master-General to the Army:
That upon a Discourse with the said Fenwick, my Lord said, he was of necessity
to go down into the Country to take account how Affairs stood there: And did
not doubt, but at his return Groves should do the business And further added,
speaking of the King; He has deceived us a great while, and we can bear no
longer.

My Lords Exceptions.
AGainst these Depositions, my Lord made these several Exceptions. The first
was grounded thus; It was not to be imagined, that so many and great
Conspirators, so well provided with Moneys, and Preferments, as Oats pretends;
all engaged in a Design so dangerous, so important to them to be kept Secret,
would or durst permit Doctor Oats their Cabinet Counselor, and Main Engine,
to be reduced to such an Extremity of Want and Penury, that he had not Bread to
put in his mouth. Yet my Lord was ready to prove in open Court, that at the
very nick of time, when this Oats would have men believe, he was most
Entrusted and Employed in carrying on the Conspiracy, just then he was in so
Poor and Despicable a condition, Page. ^28, etc.
so forsaken and contemned by all, for his Debauched Life; that he Begged at
Doors for Sixpence.

To this Doctor Oats himself answered, Page 130, etc.
he would save my Lord the trouble of proving any such thing; saying, a man's
Poverty was no objection against his Honesty; and as he had not Sixpence in
his Pocket when he began the Discovery, so has he often wanted Twopence since
the same Discovery; having Expended several hundreds of Pounds in His Majesty's
Service, more then he had received: To prove this he made a Calculation of Sums
given him by Great Persons, Sums allowed for taking of Jesuits, and Sums gained
by Printing of Narratives, of all which he said, he had nothing left.

UPon this Argument of my Lord's drawn from Oats Beggary etc. The Managers
made no Observations. Why they did not, is a Question; some say because the
Doctor himself undertook to answer it: Others affirm, because they knew the
more they stirred in it, the worse it would be; and so thought best to bury it
in Silence and Oblivion.

To the answer therefore given by Doctor Oats; the Papists reply, Poverty is
an Objection against Honesty in a person addicted (as Oats was) to Idleness,
Vice, and Debanchery: And though a man may be Poor and Honest too, yet the same
man at the same time, and in the same Circumstances Oats pretends to have been
in, could never be Poor and a Plotter too: Could he be Privy to all the Grand
Commissions? Could he be employed in all the deep and Damnable Consults? Could
he have at his mercy the Lives and Fortunes of all the Chief Conspirators? Men
Stocked with Banks of Money, sufficient (if we will believe him) to raise
Armies, and provide for two hundred thousand Soldiers? Could this man
nevertheless Starve in a manner for Bread? Could he Beg for an Alms at the
Papists Doors? Could he be rejected and contemned as an Idle Vagabond, by the
very persons who thus had put their Lives into his Hand? This is such a
Paradox, as none in their Senses will ever believe. But the most pleasant
passage (if there could be any pleasure in Bloody Perjury) This Oats affirms
in Langhorns Trial.
is his Miraculous way of spending great Sums out of nothing, in His Majesty's
Service: He confesses he had not Sixpence at the breaking forth of the Plot;
yet he Swears he is several hundreds of Pounds worse since the Discovery of it.
How came he then by all this Money? Why, he got it by way of Presents from some
great Persons, by taking of Jesuits, and Printing of Narratives: But did not
all these Gains accure unto him on the account of the Plot? On what other score
were these Presents made by Great Persons? Had he any other Trade or Livelihood
then that of the Kings Evidence? Is it not too manifest those Gifts were
bestowed on him as a Reward of Past, and Encouragement of Future Swearing?
Would to God such great Persons would duly consider the Dismal Consequences
which necessarily follow such Rewards:

THe second Exception made by my Lord against Oates's Evidence, Page 101.
was; That the said Oats had Perjured himself in two Depositions, directly
contradictory to each other: For proof of this, my Lord appealed to diverse of
the Lords themselves, who were present at both the said Depositons; amongst
whom the Earl of Berckley being required to speak what he knew: Attested, That
my Lord Chancellor did ask Doctor Oats at the Bar of the House this Question,
( viz.) My Lords desire to know if you can accuse any other person or persons
of what quality soever? And you are encouraged by their Lordships to Accuse
them. Oats his answer was, my Lords, I have no more to Accuse in Relation to
England: Notwithstanding which Deposition, he afterward in another (with
unspeakable Insolence) expressly Accused the Queen in a matter (as he thought)
of no less then High Treason, From hence my Lord concluded, if the first
Deposition was true, Oats was Perjured in the Latter: If the Latter was true,
he was Perjured in the First; so that which of the two soever is True or False,
he is guilty of Perjury.

UPon this Proof, Page 179.
the Managers made these Observations. First Doctor Oats having said much, and
having many things in his Head, could peradventure not remember on a sudden
this particular of the Queen. Secondly, The Evidence which Doctor Oats gave
afterward of the Queen was not positive, nor of his own knowledge, but words
which he heard spoken in a Room in which he was not himself; but coming in
afterward, he saw the Queen there. Thirdly, It might not be so clear to Doctor
Oats whether the Queen was a Person capable of an Accusation, so as to be
tried for Treason.

To which the Papists answer. To the first, It Is an evasion contradictory to
common Sense; that a man whose Business and Study it was to Discover a Plot
against the Life of the King, and who by several long premeditated Depositions,
had (as he said) discharged himself of all he knew should notwithstanding all
this while never remember the most Essential part. ( viz.) The Inhumane Murder
of the King, Designed and Consented to by his own Royal Consort. To the second,
Oats Depos^ed upon Oath he heard such words, and circumstanced them with such
particulars of Time and Place, as plainly denote he intended a full and home
Accusation against the Queen. And granted, his Evidence was not positive, yet
the matter was of such dangerous consequence, as ought not to to be concealed,
especially, at a time when he was upon his Oath, to speak all he knew, and when
he pretended by Discoveries to Save the Life of the King. To the Third, Though
Oats left to himself (...) be very Stupid, yet he could not be so ignorant as
not to know, that a Queen designing to Murder the King her Husband, is guilty
of Treason; and whether She was liable to a Trial or no. Oats was guilty of
Perjury; In that being Commanded and Encouraged by the Lords to make an entire
Discovery of all he knew against any Person of what Degree or Quality soever;
he expressly Swore, He had no more to Accuse in England. Indeed the Transcendent
Luster of the Queens Virtue, Innocence and Endeared Affection to His Majesty,
leaves no place for Calumny to six upon: And the bare Charge of so soul a
Crime, upon so Renowned a Goodness, is of it self Independent of other
Contradictions, a more then sufficient Conviction of Oates's Perjury.

THe third Exception made by my Lord against Oates's Evidence was; Oates's new
Porgeries. Page 102.
That though Oats in his several Depositions (particularly those taken before
the Privy Council, and House of Lords) did often affirm he had given an entire
and Faithful account, to the best of his remembrance, Of all whatsoever he
knew, as to the matters and persons concerned in the Plot: And though he had
then also time and opportunity to reflect and deliberate upon what might any
wise relate to my Lord Stafford in that affair; yet he never accused him of any
other thing, then only, That he had seen beyond the Seas some Letters Signed
Stafford, wherein the Writer had testified his zeal for the Catholic Design:
But when afterward consulting with himself, and possibly with some others, he
found this flamm of his would not amount to any thing material whereon to
ground an Impeachment, he Invented and Imposed upon my Lord a Commission of
Pay-Master-General to the Army; a device he never once thought on before. From
which proceeding my Lord argued; If there were such a Commission, received by
my Lord at Fenwick's Chamber, in such a manner as Oats relates; this
Commission being a matter of so grand Importance, and the Delivery of it
accompanied with so many remarkable circumstances in the very presence of
Oats. Page 25.
It is impossible that the said Oats, who (as he says) on purpose for
Discovery, had taken Notes and Memorials, even of Trivial Occurrences, should
forget, and by consequence omit a thing of this high concern in his former
Depositions. But if there were no such Commission, Page 126.
(as Most assuredly there was none) then is Oats Perjured in his present
Evidence: And verily (added my Lord) if it be permitted to this man daily to
frame New Accusations; If easy credit be given to all his Fables, and
whatsoever he shall from time to time Invent, may pass for good Evidence; Who
can be secure? At this rate, he may by deegrees Impeach the whole Nation, for
Crimes which neither he, nor any man else ever yet dreamed on.

UPon these Arguments and Inferences made by my Lord; the Managers would not;
and the Papists say, They need not make any remarks.

THe fourth Exception made by my Lord against Oats his Evidence, Oats his
Apostasy and Sacrilege.
was: That whereas Oats now declares, He never was really a Roman Catholic,
but only Feigned himself to be so; My Lord often and strongly insisted, Page
123.
That a Protestant of the Church of England, who convinced in his Judgment of
the Truth of his Religion, shall nevertheless, on what pretense soever Provoke
God, belie his own Conscience, and violate all Sacred things; So as to make a
solemn Abrenuntiation of his Faith and Church. To profess himself a Roman
Catholic, to live amongst them, to practice Religious duties with them, for
three years together; and this to such an height of Sacrilege, as frequently
to receive the Sacrament, and perform daily external Worship; to it, (which in
the Judgment both of Protestants and Catholics was to him, so believing
direct, and gross Idolatry) cannot rationally be supposed to stick at Perjury,
when Advantageous to him; And, ought not by the Law of God or Man, to be
credited or admitted for an Evidence against any one; But rather detested and
abhorred, by all good Men, as undeserving the name of a Christian.

UPon this pressing Inference the Mannagers made this following Observation:
Suppose Dr. Oats did out of Levity, or for want of being well grounded in his
own, turn to another Religion. It is hard, That the matter of changing his
Religion, when nothing else is laid to his charge, should disparage his
Testimony, seeing many who have changed their Religion more then once (Example
Mr. Chillingworth) are yet esteemed credible Persons.

To which the Papists answer: To change from a wrong to a right Religion, is no
disparagement; but Protestants will hardly allow Oate's first pretended change
to be such. However my Lord insisted not upon the changing but the seigning
Religion. Oats did not out of Levity or Conviction of Judgment (as Mr.
Chillingworth) turn from his own to another Religion. but remaining interiourly
of the same belief, he exteriously renounced what he so believed, and
Sacrilegiously practiced the direct contrary, than which nothing can be more
detestable. Nay he affirms, he often received the Sacrament* and took
dreadful Oaths of Secrecy in pursuance of most Bloody and Hellish Designs. If
this be true, what credit can be given to a Monster accustomed and insured (by
his own cofession) to such damnable Oaths. But if it be false (as indeed it is)
then is he Perjured in his Evidence.

Edward Turbervil's Deposition against my Lord.
THe last Witness that gave direct Evidence to my Lord's Impeachment, was
Edward Turbervil, who Swore, That in the year (75.) he was persuaded by his
Friends, to take upon him the Friars habit at Doway; That being weary of that
state, he left it, and came into England, for which he incurred the displeasure
of his Friends, and Relations, who (he said) discountenanced him, and could not
endure to see him; That hereupon he went into France, and Arrived at Paris, and
became acquainted with the now Prisoner, my Lord Stafford, by means of two
Priests, Father Nelson, and Father Turbervil; That after a fortnights
acquaintance, and promise of Secrecy, my Lord proposed unto him a way, whereby
as he said, he might not only retrieve his credit with his Relations, but also
make himself an happy Man; which way, at last my Lord told him in direct terms,
was, To take away the life of the King of England, who was an Heretic, and
consequently a Rebel against God Almighty; For circumstantial instances of
this, Turbervil Swore, That he had, during that fortnights acquaintance,
frequent access to my Lord at his Lodgings; That when he took leave of him to
come for England, his Lordship was troubled with the Gout, and had his Foot on
a Stool; That my Lord had appointed him to wait for him at Diepe in order to
his coming over with him in a Yacht; That accordingly Turbervil went to Diepe,
but that being there, my Lord writ him word, he had altered his resolution, and
would take his Journey by the way of Callice, and that he should hasten to
attend his Lordship at London; That hereupon he came into England, but soon
after returned again into France, because not being willing to undertake my
Lord's proposals, he was discountenanced by his Friends, reduced to poverty.
And thought himself not safe even amongst his own Relations.

My Lord's Exceptions.
TO this deposition my Lord pleaded in his defense, Turbavil's Perjury in seven
Particulars.
That Turbervil had Perjured himself in several parts of this, and other his
Depositions.

First, Turbervil here Swears my Lord made a Proposal to him in direct terms,
To take away the Life of the King. Now my Lord proved; That since the discovery
of the Plot, The said Turbervil did absolutely Forswear any knowledge he ever
had of any design, or any Plot whatsoever against the King's Person, Life or
Government; The Witnesses were these.

John Porter, Page 120 etc.
a Protestant, attested, That Turbervil told him several times, He did verily
believe, neither the Lord Powis, nor the rest of the Lords were in the Plot;
And the Witnesses that Swore against them, he believed were all Perjured, and
could not believe any thing of it. Porter Answered, If there was such a thing,
He ( Turbervil,) having been beyond Seas, must certainly know of it; Turbervil
replied, As he hoped for Salvation, he knew nothing of it, neither directly nor
indirectly, against the Kings Sacred Person, nor Subversion of the Government.
And he further added, Although I am a little low at present, and my Friends
will not look upon me, yet I hope God Almighty will never leave me so much, as
to let me Swear against Innocent Persons, and Forswear and Damn my self.

Mr. Yalden a Protestant and Barrister at Law, Page 122.
attested, That he heard Turbervil say, in an heat, these words, ( viz.) God
damn me, now there is no Trade good, but that of a Discoverer; But the Devil
take the Duke of York, Monmouth, Plot and all, for I know nothing of it.

To Confront these Testimonies, Page 152.
the Mannagers produced one Mr. Powel and Mr. Arnold, who deposed, That
Turbervil told them, He had much to say in relation to the Plot, but did not
name any particulars, fearing (he said) he might be discouraged in it.

UPon these Testimonies of Mr. Porter and Mr. Yalden, The Mannagers made these
Observations. First, It is not probable, that Turbervil designing to be a
Discoverer, should disable himself ever to be so, by Swearing Horrid Oaths, he
knew nothing of the Plot. Secondly, The Testimony of Porter and Yalden are
opposed by the contrary Testimony of Powel and Arnold,

To which the Papists answer: To the first, It is not improbable, but very
likely, that Turbervil as yet not fully resolved, to make Shipwreck of his
Conscience and Honesty, did often protest, He knew nothing of the Plot; And if
the positive attestation of two credible Witnesses may be admitted for good
Evidence: It is not bare probability, but just and solid proof that he did so;
And by consequence, his present Discoveries ought not to be regarded, otherwise
then as the new and gainful Inventions of a Perjured Man. To the second, The
Testimony of Powel, and Arnold has no manner of weight against my Lord's
Evidence, but rather compleats the charge of Perjury against Turbervil. For it
is granted, that Turbervil has said and Swore, both to Powel, Arnold, and the
whole House of Parliament, He knew much of the Plot. But this being directly
contradictory to the dreadful Oaths here attested by Porter and Yalden, and no
wise denied by Powel and Arnold; It follows by the Testimony of all the four
Witnesses, that Turbervil is guilty of Perjury.

SEcondly, Turbervil Swears: That during the Fortnights acquaintance with my
Lord at Paris, Page 109.
he had, by means of the Priests, frequent access to him, at his Lodgings
there. Now my Lord's Gentleman and Page, who both then constantly waited on
him, attested, They never once saw Turbervil there; And Turbervil himself
acknowledged in Court, He knew them not.

To qualify this Evidence, Page 151.
Thomas Mort was called, who deposed; That he being at Paris and desirous to
return into England; Turbervil told him, his Brother the Monk, had introduced
him into the savor of a Lord, by which means they might both of them have the
convenience of passage in a Yacht, which staid for my Lord at Diep. That
hereupon they went to Diep, but finding no Yacht there, Turbervil told him, If
they went to Calis, they might go over with my Lord from thence in the Yacht.
At last they light on a Fisher-Boat at Diep, and so came over in it; But that
this forementioned Lord was my Lord Stafford, or that he ever saw Turbervil in
my Lord's Lodgings, or Company at Paris, or elsewhere, he could not say.

UPon these Testimonies, the Mannagers made this Observation: ( v^z) The
Priests had such a transcendent Insluence over my Lord, as might gain
admittance for any whom they pleased, not only into my Lord's House, but also
into my Lord's Heart, without the privity or knowledge of his Servants. Now it
plainly appears by the attestation of Mort, that Turbervil, through his Brother
the Monk's means, was become my Lord's Favorite.

To which the Papists answer: It is not proved, either that the Priests had
such a Transcendent Influence over my Lord's House and Heart, or that Turbervil
through their means, became a Favorite? Mort indeed tells us, Turbervil told
him, His Brother the Monk had Introduced him into the Favor of a Lord; And
this Favor only, to come over with him in a Yacht. For the Truth of which also
he had only Turbervil's word, and the thing it self never performed. Must we
from hence infer, my Lord had given his Heart to the Priests, and they had
Introduced Turbervil into it? A strange Inference: But let it be granted, my
Lord had a real Friendship and Kindness for the Monks, what then? How is it
proved, they employed their Interest with him, in Traiterous Designs? Why?
Turbervil Swears it. Thus one Forgery is made use of to support another, and
nothing but proofless Fictions to make all out: Yet to come more close to the
present Evidence. Had the Priests Introduced Turbervil into my Lords
acquaintance and favor; this could not be done Invisibly to the Servants; some
body must needs see and know, when they came in and out; My Lord was then in
Lodgings, and had none but two Servants about him; Turbervil never pretends
either the Priests, or he, made a secret of their visits; Their accesses to my
Lord (he says) were very frequent, as the nature of the business, and
pretended intimacy with my Lord, seemed to require. The Condition of Turbervil
was also such, as might well render him desirous of the Servants acquaintance
and Friendship; especially being then (as he said) immeditrly to go over in the
Yacht with them, and to continue employed in my Lords Designs and Service at
London. Now that a Man in these Circumstaces, should not know these Servants,
nor be known, or so much as once seen by them; is Morally Impossible.

THirdly Turbervil Swears, That when he took leave of my Lord at Paris, to come
for England, his Lordship was troubled with the Gout in his Foot. Now my Lord
protested in the presence of all that knew him, he never had the Gout in all
his Life; His Servants also who then lived with him, Page 108.
( viz. Mr. Furness and Mr. Leigh) gave attestation, they never knew him
subject to that Infirmity; only several years since, he had been troubled with
the Sciatica, which my Lord confessed, and the Earl of Stamsord testisied; made
him sometimes formerly (though never at Paris) walk with a Staff.

UPon these Testimonies, the Mannagers made no Observations. But the Papists
Avouch, here is also direct Perjury proved upon Turbervil, by two Credible
Witnesses. And though the subject of the Perjury seems not to be matterial to
the main Accusation, yet he that shall wilfully Perjure himself in any one
Circumstance, ought not to be credited in the whole; Seeing Nature it self,
abhors the Testimony of a Man, who has once Invoked Almighty God to bear
Witness to a Lie.

FOurthly Turbervil Swears, That after his refusing to be a Friar, he was
discountenanced by the Lord Powis, and others of his Friends and Relations, so
that he durst not appear amongst them. Now my Lord proved, by several
Witnesses. That after his return from the said Friars, he was civilly treated,
and charitably entertained, by his said Friends and Relations. To make this
good,

John Minehead attested, That Turbervil after his coming from Doway, lay in the
House of the Earl of Powis, Page 113.
his former Master, and was courteously entertained, both by my Lord, and the
whole Family.

John Turbervil, Brother to the Deponent, attested, He never knew that any of
his Relations gave him an Angry word; but on the contrary, when he went to
Paris, his Sister bestowed on him Seven Pounds to bear his Charges; Upon which
he said, He would never trouble them more.

UPon these Testimonies, Page 181.
the Mannagers made these Observations, First, Though Turbervil might
peradventure (as Minehead attests) be civily Treated by my Lord Powis in
public, yet what Reproaches or unkind words might pass between my Lord and him
in private, Minehead might not hear. Secondly, It was no great Kindness in
Turbervil 's Relations, to give him Seven Pounds (as his Brother attests) never
to see him more; They rather purchased his absence, then did him a Kindness by
such a Favor.

To which the Papists answer: To the first, Groundless Surmises of private
unkindnesses, which none ever yet came to the knowledge of, nor Turbervil
himself so much as pretends, Is a strange way of clearing a Man in open Court
from the guilt of Perjury; To frame and fancy things that possibly might be,
and draw prejudicial Inferences from thence, as if they actually had been, is
unjust proceeding. To the second, Turbervil (as his Brother attests) never had
one angry word from his Relations; and when his Sister gave him Seven pounds,
it was not to purchase his absence, nor did they turn him away. But he himself,
ashamed it seems of his past misdemeanors, and confounded at the goodness of
his Friends. Said, He would never trouble them more.

FIfthly, Page 106
Turbervil in his Information given to the House of Commons Swore: That be came
to Live with the Lord Powis in the year (73.) and came into England in the year
(76.) But the next day after he had given in this Information, he altered the
aforenamed Dates; and instead of (73.) caused to be inserted (72.) And instead
of (76.) caused to be Inserted (75.) which Alteration, Page 180.
my Lord affirmed, included Perjury.

UPon this proof the Managers made this Observation: An Honest man may mistake
as to point of time in an Evidence given even upon Oath: And to Rectify such a
mistake the very next day after it was committed, denotes rather Tenderness of
Conscience then Perjury in Turbervil.

To which the Papists answer. No Honest man will positively Swear to what he
knows not: And it is argued, Turbervil when he gave in his Information,
certainly knew whether the matters and circumstances he then Swore to, were
True, or False, or Dubious: It the first, he is Perjured in the Alteration; If
the second, he is ^^jured in the Information; If the third, he is not a person
of Honesty and Credit, who will positively Swear without Hesitation to a thing
of which he is ignorant whether True or False? And therefore the Alteration
made upon second Though s^ cannot in such a Case be justly imputed to
Tenderness of Conscience, but to some, not before conceived Apprehensions, of
being taken Tardy in a Lie.

SIxthly, Page 112.
Turbervil in the Information given to the said House of Commons, and Exhibited
in Court, Peremptorily Swore: That my Lord came over out of France in the
Company of Count Gramount, by the way of Calais. In direct opposition to this
Information, my Lord proved, that he neither came out of France in the Company
of Count Gramount, not by the way of Calais; but by the way of Deep, a Month
after Count Gramount was in England.

The Witnesses who gave Attestation of this, Page 110
were Mr. Wyborne, who went over from England to Deep in the same Yacht which
fetched my Lord; and Mr. ^urness and George Leigh my Lords Servants, who came
with my Lord in the said Yacht from Deep to England.

UPon these Proofs of Perjury, Page 182.
the Managers made this Observation. When Mr. Turbervil Deposed, My Lord came
over by the way of Calais in the Company of Count Gramount; it could not be his
Intention to say this as a matter of his own knowledge, seeing he himself in
the same Affidavit tells us, He came away before my Lord, and had not his
passage with him: Put the words Heartily taken, are to be understood, That he
was informed, my Lord came over by the way of Calais in the Company of Count
Gramoun: Now that Mr. Turbervil was thus informed, is evident, as well by the
Letter which (he says) he received at Deep from my Lord, as also by the
asorementioned Attestation of Mort who says, That being at Deep, Turbervil
told him, if they went to Calais, they might go over with my Lord in the Yacht;
so that in the whole, Mr. Turbervil may be said to have been peradventure
something unwary in expressing himself, but not Perjured in his Evidence.

To which the Papists answer: To excuse a man from Pejury, by pretending an
occuls meaning and intention in the Swearer, not expressed in the words of his
Oath, is such an Evasion, as if admitted, would destroy the Integrity of an
Oath, and elude all proof of Perjury whatsoever: Turbervil Swears in down,
right terms, my Lord came over by the way of Calais in the Company of Count
Gramount, without any addition That he was Informed so. In which Oath he is
directly Perjured; for he Swears as an absolute Truth, and without Restriction,
what of it self is an absolute Lie, and what at best he could but Guess at, by
report and hera-say. It is true indeed, he contradicts himself in the sequel of
his Information, by saying He came away before my Lord, and had not his Passage
with him; but it is connatural to Perjury, to include contradictions; Wicked
Men are often blinded with Malice, Passion, or Interest; And no wonder to find
Incoherence of parts, in a Story divested of Truth. The only thing can be
collected of Probability in this whole matter is, That Turbervil being at
Paris, in an Indigent condition, and desirous to return home, got imperfect
Intelligence that an English Lord (whose name as yet he knew not) and a French
Count called Gramount, had a Yacht waited for them at Diep. And having also a
Brother then in Paris, he sought by his means to gain admittance for a Passage
in the said Yacht. This design of his he imparts to Mort, a Person in the same
condition, and who had the same purpose with himself. Hereupon Mort and he go
to Diep in hopes to find the Yacht there, but they failed of their expectation,
and Turbervil missing the Yacht, would have persuaded Mort to go in the search
of it to Calais; Whilst they were in this debate, they lighted on a
Fisher-Boat, and so came over in it into England. Thus much may be conjectured
from the Relation of Mort. But that Turbervil during his stay at Diep, reccived
a Letter from my Lord, intimating his intention of coming for England, by the
way of Calais, and that he should hasten to meet him at London, is a most
palpable Forgery; For neither could Turbervil, when required, produce any such
Letter, nor did my Lord come over by the way of Calais as Turbervil would have
us believe that Letter Imported. And indeed who can imagine, my Lord should
send word to his new Confederate at Diep, to hasten to meet him at London, when
he himself remained at Paris, (as has been proved) above a month after: and at
length also came not to Calais, but to Diep and from thence home, so that here
is nothing but contradictions in the whole course of Turbervil's Evidence.

SEventhly, Turbervil in the last mentioned Information positively Swore: Page
101.
That the Lord Castlemain was present at certain Fraiterous Consults at
Powis-Castle, several times within the years (72,) or (73) Now my Lord proved,
that the said Earl of Casilemain was never at Powis-Castle within the compass
of that whole time.

This was demonstrated by the Attestation of Mr. Lidcot a Protestant, and
Fellow of Kings-Colledge in Cambridge, who having Lived with the Earl Nine
years, and particularly Accompanied him in all his Journeys and Residences,
during those two above named years; gave this distinct account out of his Book
of Journals ( viz.) My Lord set forth from Liege to Paris January 1st. Page 116.
(72.) Stilo novo, where he remained three Weeks; and from thence arrived at
London January 24. Stil' vet, there he staid till May (73) from thence he went
to Liege again in June, and from Liege he set forth to London in August; and
returned back to Liege October the 3. Stilo novo (73.) where he remained till
January (74.) etc. Thus much to the charge of Perjury.

UPon this proof of Perjury the Mannagers made this Observation: Mr. Lydcot the
Fellow of Kings-Colledge (as he called himself) was indeed so out in his
Arithmatick, so mistaken in the year; And used the Roman style (or date) so
much more then the English. That they suspected he was not so great a
Protcstant as he pretended to be.

To which the Papists answer: That a solid Witness ought not be Railed out of
his Evidence, in a matter of Life and Death, Mr. Lydcot (however skilled in
Arithmatick, however great or little Protestant) substantially proved the Earl
of Castlemain, never was at, or near Powis-Castle, from the first of January
(72) till past December (73.) the inclusive time wherein Turbervil Swears, He
was at a Consult there. And it is strange, so weighty and convincing a proof of
Perjury, in a matter of so high and serious a concern, should be shifted off by
a trissing Jest.

LAstly, Turbervil 's loose manner of Life.
My Lord upon occasion made some Remarks upon Turbervil's Beggary, Loose manner
of Life, and diverse odd Circumstances in the course of his Evidence, which much
reflected upon his Reputation: To support it therefore, the Managers produced
these Witnesses.

Mr. Arnold, Page 154.
Jones, Hobby and Scudamore, Deposed; That they knew Turbervil, but for their
parts never heard, or saw any evil by him.

Mr. Matthews a Minister Deposed the same, as to Turbervil's Reputation; and
added: That Turbervil a little before he made his Discovery, owned himself a
Roman Catholic; but seemed to have a mind to quit that Religion, being
convinced by the Arguments Matthews gave him, of the Excellency of the
Principles and Practices of the Protestant Church; yet would never acknowledge
he knew one Syllable of the Plot.

UPon these several Remarques, the Mannagers made this Observation: The good
Character here given of Turbervil, by four Witnesses, show him a Man of much
Virtue and Integrity; And it ought to be considered as a farther addition to
his Praise, that he had the grace (though indigent) to refuse the proposal made
to him by my Lord, of Killing the King.

To which the Papists answer: It is no sufficient proof of Turbervil's Virtue
and Integrity, that four Persons say, They know no ill of him; He may be guilty
nevertheless of a Thousand Crimes unknown to them; few or none are so entirely
abandoned or detested by all Mankind, as not to find four Persons in the World
who will make a favorable report of them. But it is evident from what has
been already proved; That Turbervil was a man in all points completely equipped
for a Knight of the Post: For first, he was indigent; Secondly, he was horridly
addicted to Cursing and Swearing; Thirdly, he looked upon feigning Discoveries,
as the only way to get Moneys. All this is manifested by his own Words and
conversation with Mr. Yalden and Mr. Porter before mentioned; As I hope for
Salvation (said he) I know nothing of the Plot. The Devil take the Duke of
York, Monmouth, and all. God damn me, there is now no Trade good but that of a
Discoverer. Who shall ever want Witnesses, that can find men thus qualified?
And whereas it is said, he had the grace to refuse the proposal made to him, of
Killing the King. It ought first to be proved, otherwise then by his own
assertion; He had such a Proposal made, before the refusal of it can be justly
alleged as an argument of grace in him. Finally, It is very remarkable what
Parson Matthews the last of the Witnesses here Deposes, ( viz.) That though
Turbervil had a mind to quit the Roman Catholic Religion, being (as he said)
convinced by the Arguments Matthews gave him, of the excellency of the
Principles and Practices of the Protestant Church; yet he would never
acknowledge to the said Matthews, his new Ghostly Father, That he knew one
syllable of the Plot.

The sum of the whole Evidence, both for and against my Lord. 4.
IN this sort passed and ended the Particular Evidences, given as well by the
Mannagers against my Lord, as by my Lord in his own defense. After this the
Court required each Party to sum up their respective Evidence; And it being by
course of Law, my Lord's turn to begin; He performed it to this purpose.

First, He pleaded his Age, Page 163. etc. The sum of my Lord's Plea as to
matters of Fact.
his want of Endowments, his Exhausted Spirits and strength in this long Trial;
In consideration of which he hoped their Lordships (who were both his Judges
and Council,) would Pardon the many defects he must needs commit in Summing up
his defense: Then he Recapitulated the whole Evidence (already specified) as
well as his weak memory, and discomposed condition would permit. He reminded
their Lordships of the several points wherein he had proved the Witnesses
Forsworn: He recounted their sayings, and unsayings to the same things. The
various Contradictions, the moral Impossibilities, and Absurdities, as to
diverse (though beforehand studied) parts of their Evidence; Inferring from
hence, That he who will Forswear himself in one thing, is not to be credited in
any. He insisted upon the Infamy of the Witnesses, and Wickedness of their
Lives, especially the more the Atheistical Sacrilege of some of them,
acknowledged in open Court; He Inculcated their former Beggary, compared to the
present Encouragement, Carasses, and Allurements of Gain, and Applause, they
find in their new Employment. He alleged their Subornation of others, to make
good their Forgeries, their bare Oaths without any corroborating circumstances,
but what depended on the same Oaths; concluding, that such as will Swear Lies,
will never stick at Swearing of false Circumstances, to hancle those Lies
together.

And having thus summed up his Defense, Page 167. etc.
as well as a weak Old Man, harrassed and spent with five days pleading. And
(as he said) deprived of Sleep, could do on a sudden; He cast himself into
their Lordships hands, desiring them to remember how faithfully he had served
the King in the late Wars; How much himself, his Wife, and Family had suffered
on that account; How easily he might have prevented those Miseries, if he
would, as others did, have turned a Rebel; And consequently, how-unlikely it
is, he should now in his Old Age, and settled contented State, be guilty of so
horrid a Crime, proved only against him by the Incredible Stories of three
Infamous Men.

Then he proceeded to propose certain Points or Doubts in Law, which occurred
in his case, My Lord's Plea as to matters of Law.
concerning the manner of his Impeachment; the continuance of it from
Parliament to Parliament; Whether the Indictment contained an Overt Act,
necessary to a Conviction of Treason? Whether Men, who Swear for Money, ought
to be credited, or admitted for Witnesses? Whether the Plot, being supposed a
Plot of the Papists, was as yet legally proved so? Lastly, Whether there being
but one particular Witness to any one particular point, such an Evidence be
sufficient in Law.

WHen my Lord had ended his Queries, Page 199. etc. The sum of the Evidence
against my Lord.
the Learned Mannagers those dexterous Masters of Law and Eloquence addressed
themselves, to sum up the Evidence, and Illustrate the Proofs on their side.

That part which regards the especial matters charged by the Witnesses upon my
Lord in particular, I have already incerted in the body of the Trial, as the
said several matters respectively occurred; The other Arguments made use of to
enforce a belief of my Lord's Guilt, and advance the credit of the Witnesses,
take here (together with the Papists Answers) in short, as follows.

The Managers therefore argued, They had made it plain and apparent in the
beginning of the Trial, by the Testimonies of fix positive Witnesses; by the
Declaration of both Houses of Parliament; by Coleman's Letters; by the Trial
and Conviction of other Traitors; that there was a general Design amongst the
Papists, to introduce their Religion, By raising of Armies, murdering the King,
and subverting the Government.

THe Papists answer: It is clear and manifest from the Reasons given, and
Arguments answered, in the Preamble to this Trial; That there never was any
such general Design, any such Armies raised, etc. amongst the Papists. These
being the mere groundless Suggestions of Infamous Men, whom Lucre and Malice
instigated to Perjury against Innocent Catholics.

THe Managers farther argued, It was necessary this great Design of the Papists
should be managed by the greatest Persons amongst them: Now my L. Stafford was
a man whose Quality and Merit might well entitle him to an Office as great as
Play Master General to the Army; From whence they inferred, That the particular
Evidence given herein against my Lord, was highly credible.

THe Papists answer: It is a wrested Inference, and that also bottomed upon a
false supposition; For first, There never was (as is said before) any such
Design, nor by consequence any Armies or Officers, other then what were the
Chymerical product of Perjured Men. Secondly, Though there had been such a
Design in general, as is here pretended; it is a strangely far fetched
conjecture (surely not allowable in a case of Life and Death) that my Lord
Stafford because a Nobleman, must needs have a great, or indeed any part in it.
Great Offices (especially amongst Traitors) are not usually committed to the
best Born, but to the best Qualified for such employments. Now all the World
that knew my Lord, his Humor, his Condition, his Economy in Money matters,
will avouch, (so incongruous are the Witnesses in their Lies,) there was not
peradventure amongst all the Persons of Quality, Catholics in England, one
less proper then he for Play Master General to an Army. In fine, If there were a
Plot in general, it is no necessary consequence my Lord was Guilty. But if there
were none (as most certainly there was not) it is absolute demonstration my Lord
was Innocent.

THe Managers argued, Page 170.
They had amply proved by their Witnesses, That the Priests and Jesuits, in
their Sermons and Discourses, had justified the lawfulness, and incited their
Votaries, to the practice of Treason, Rebellion, and Murder of Heretic
Princes; Conformably hereunto, whenever my Lord undertook any Treasonable
Designs, it was still when the Priests and Jesuits were at his Elbow; still
when they were egging him on; still when they were giving him Ghostly Counsel;
when my Lord was amongst them, or but newly come from them, then it was he
uttered the Treason of Killing the King. These notable Circumstances must needs
(say they) render credible the Testimony of the Witnesses against my Lord.

THe Papists answer, Here are Traiterous Sermons and Discourses alleged; How
are they proved? Why, by the Oaths of the Witnesses that heard them. But the
Credit of these Witnesses are questioned; How is that made out? Why, by the
Traiterous Sermons and Discourses which they heard. Thus still the Question is
begged, and nothing proved but by bare swearing, peremptory swearing, of
infamous men, without any face of one single Circumstance to support their
Evidence, other than what depends on the same swearing: As if those that
stick not to swear a false Oath, should stick at Circumstances to second their
Perjury. Had the Managers flourished upon the Honesty of the Witnesses; the
Vprightness of their Lives; the Integrity of their Manners; their
dis-engagement from Self-interest; the Circumstances inducing a probability,
distinct from the bare Oaths, (things necessary to a legal Conviction) the
Trial would have had another appearence. It is therefore again urged, That
there are such Wretches as Knights of the Post. That men may, and often do,
break God's great Commandment, Thou shall not bear false Witness against thy
Neighbor. That wicked Persons, of lost Consciences and desperate Fortunes, are
most propense to commit this Crime. That this Propension is much augmented by
an assured prospect of Indempnities from Punishment, and advantage of Gain. And
consequently, the bare, and otherwise improbable, Oaths of such men, so
circumstanced, cannot (especially in matters of Life and Death) be credited
against honest and virtuous Persons; nay against whole Nations, without a
dreadful hazard of Injustice. But there will be a further occasion to speak of
these alleged Traiterous Sermons and Discourses, when we come to treat of my
Lord's Principles.

THe Managers still argued, Page 171, etc.
The three Witnesses were all express and positive in their Evidence against my
Lord.

THe Papists still answer, It is not positive swearing of evil, but probable
swearing of good men, should convict my Lord, or any other, of guilt,
especially in matters of High Treason.

THe Managers likewise argued, It was impossible there could be a Contrivance
amongst the Witnesses themselves to depose the same Crimes against my Lord,
Page 184.
seeing there was no intercourse between Oats and Dugdale; nor did they know
each other till long after Oates's accusation of my Lord; And it is as little
credible, they could concur in the same thing, unless the Evidence of both
were true.

THe Papists answer, Though there were no Contrivance arising from any
acquaintance or intercourse had between Oats and Dugdale, before their several
Discoveries, yet the latter might well take example and encouragement, from the
practice of the former; and so indeed it was; for Dugdale being involved in
Debts, and thrown into Gaol, cast about how to retrieve his desperate Fortune;
and hearing that Oats and Bedlow (men before sunk to the bottom of reproach
and beggary) had by Perjury and Impudence freed themselves from the Punishment
of the Laws, gained immense rewards, and now lived in a degree above the port
and expense of ordinary Gentlemen; he at last (yet not without frequent
anguish, and reluctance of Conscience) swallowed the alluring bait; and knowing
my Lord Stafford (whom he had seen at Tixal) was already in the Tower, and
accused by Oats of the Plot, he devised a like fabulous story of the Plot
also, making my Lord, and other Gentlemen, where he lived and served in
Staffordshire, the chief Actors in it. By which means Dugdale became Partner
with Oats and Bedlow, both in the Title and Profit of the King's Evidence.

THe Managers argued, Page ^^^
Oats and Dugdale were so ready in their Answers, when any Question was asked
them, and confirmed still their precedent discourses by their subsequent
replies; Nay, the whole frame and series of the Plot, though consisting of many
particulars, and attested by persons of no great natural capacities, is yet so
coherent in every part of it, that it is impossible the same should be false.

THe Papists answer, Oats and Dugdale were often so confounded, when any
Question was asked them out of the road; and their precedent discourses were
usually so inconsistent with their subsequent replies; Nay the whole story
(though studied beforehand, and the Authors all manner of ways encouraged and
assisted in their invention) is yet stuffed and involved with so many
absurdities, contradictions, and impracticable chymaera's, (as has been already
often and fully proved) that it is impossible the same should be true; for
Falsehood may, but Truth cannot be inconsistent of parts.

LAstly, the Managers having amply dilated and descanted upon each particular
Evidence and Argument, alleged, as well against my Lord, as in his defense;
and making even critical remarks upon whatever might be drawn either to the
advantage of the one, or prejudice of the other, (the substance of all which
has been already specified in its proper place.) At length they concluded,
with sharp and moving aggravations against the Popish Principles, (whereof also
we shall by and by, according to promise, give a distinct account;) And
insisting a while on this subject, with much accuteness of Wit, and seeming
applause, they closed up their Evidence.

THus, Answer to (...) Lord's Plea in matters of Law.
when there was a period put to proof in matters of Fact, there began a debate
as to matter of Law, concerning a doubt proposed by my Lord, (the other of his
Queries not being admitted disputable) ( viz.) Whether two Witnesses be
necessary to every Overt Act, in point of Treason? Page 190.
This Question being referred to the Judges, they determined it to the Negative.

After this, My Lord's particular Address.
my Lord petitioned the Court (as a peculiar favor) That he might offer some
things to their Lordships Consideration, the purport of which was, That he had
proved direct Perjury upon all the three Witnesses against him: That, Page 198.
as well at the instance of his Wife, Daughter and Friends, as out of sincerity
of Conscience, he would, in the presence of Almighty God, declare to them, All
that he knew: That he verily believed there had been in former times Plots and
Designs against the Crown and Government, (as the Gun-powder-Treason, etc.
owned by the Traitors themselves at their death) wherein some Roman Catholics,
as well as others, might be concerned; which Plots he from his heart (as both
his Duty and Religion taught him) detested and abhorred: That it was ever
indeed his opinion, That an Act of Comprehension for Dissenting Protestants,
and a Tolleration for Roman Catholics (yet so as not to admit them into any
Offices of Profit or Dignity) would much conduce to the happiness of the
Nation; But this not otherwise to be procured or desired, then by a free
consent of the King, Lords, and Commons, in Parliament assembled: That he never
read or knew of Coleman's Letters, or Consultations for Tolleration, till he
saw the Letters themselves in the Printed Trial: How far Coleman was Criminal
he did not know, but he believed he did that which was not justifiable by Law:
That, as to the damnable Doctrine of King-killing, If he were of any Church
whatsoever, and found that to be its Principle, he would leave it. That he knew
the disadvantage he was under, in being forced, alone, to stand a contest with
the Learned Gentlemen the Mannagers, who have those great helps of Memory,
Parts, and Understanding in the Law, all which he wanted. That therefore he
hoped their Lordships would not conclude barely upon the manner, either of his;
or their expressions. But seriously debating the merits of the Cause in it
self, would please to be his Council, as well as his Judges. That seeing he was
to be Acquitted, or Condemned by their Lordships Judgment; He knew they would
lay their hands upon their Heart, Consult their Consciences, and their Honors;
And then he doubted not, they would do what was just and equitable; That (with
submission to their Lordships) he thought it hard measure, and contrary to Law,
that any one should be Imprisoned above two years, without being admitted to
Trial; And that it was of evil consequence for any one to have Justice denied
him, so long till his Opponents had found occasion to gain their ends; That
however those large Allowances, and Rewards granted to the Witnesses, for
Swearing, might peradventure be an effect of His Majesty's Grace and Bounty;
yet it was not easily conceivable, how the hopes and promises of so great Sums
should not prove to dissolute, indigent Persons, strong Allurements and
temptations to Perjury. Finally, That the defense he had made, he owed it to
the worth and dignity of his Family; He owed it to his dear Wife and Children;
(at which words he was observed to weep,) He owed it to his Innocense; He owed
it to God, the Author of Life. That he confided, their Lordships would duly
reflect, what a dreadful thing Murder is, and the Blood of Innocents: And that
he verily believed none of the House of Commons, desired his Death for a Crime
of which he was not Guilty. That he hoped their Lordships would not permit him
to be run down by the shouts of the Rabble, (the Emblem of our past Calamity.)
It began in the late times with the Lord Stafford, and so continued, till it
ended in the Death of the King, the most execrable Murder, that ever was
committed; And where this will end (said he,) God knows. To conclude, He again
declared in the presence of God, of his Angels, of their Lordships, and all who
heard him, That he was entirely Innocent of what was laid to his charge; That
he left it to their Lordships to do Justice, and with all submission resigned
himself to them.

To this discourse of my Lords, the Mannagers returned for answer: That his
Lordships last Address was not regular, nor according to the due method of
proceedings; for if after his Lordship had summed up his Evidence, and the
Prosecutors had concluded theirs, he should begin that work again, and they by
consequence be admitted to reply, he might still rejoyn upon them, and so there
would be no end of proceedings. They therefore desired this Indulgence granted
to my Lord, might not serve for a future President.

The Conclusion of the Trial. 5.
HEre then the Lord High Steward wholly terminating all further process on
either side; The Court gave final Judgment; And the Lord High Steward
collecting the Votes, my Lord Stafford was Pronounced Guilty, by fifty five
Votes against thirty one.

When the Votes were passed, the Lord High Steward, declared to the Prisoner,
He was found Guilty of High Treason, whereof he was Impeached. To which my Lord
Stafford answered, Gods holy name be praised my Lord for it. Then the Lord High
Steward asked him, What he could say for himself, why Judgment of Death should
not be given upon him according to Law? He replied, My Lord, I have very little
to say; I confess I am surprised at it, for I did not expect it. But Gods will
be done, and your Lordships; I will not murmur at it. God forgive those who
have Falsely Sworn against me.

We are now come to the final Sentence of Death, Page 212. My Lord High
Steward's Speech.
For a Prologue to which the Lord High Steward made a short Pathetick Speech;
wherein after some reflections upon the Plot in general, he descended to my
Lords case in particular; And then advised his Lordship (as now a supposed
guilty Person,) to bething himself of the State and Condition he was in: His
Religion imputed to him as the C^^se of his Guilt.
of his Religion and Guides, that ('it is said) had seduced him: Of the
repentance due to so heinous Crimes: And concluded with an assurance to his
Lordship, That a true Penitential Sorrow joined with an humble and hearty
Confession, was of mighty power and efficacy, both with God and Man. He then
pronounced Sentence upon him, in these words.

The Judgment of the Law is, Page 21^. The Sentence.
and the Court does award it, That you go to the place from whence you came,
from thence you must be drawn upon an Hurdle to the place of Execution; when
you come there, you must be Hanged up by the Neck, but not till you are Dead,
for you must be cut down Alive; your Privy Members must be cut off; And your
Bowels Ripped up before your Face, and thrown into the Fire: Then your Head must
be severed from your Body, and your Body divided into four Quarters. And these
must be at the disposal of the King. And God Almighty have mercy on your Soul.

My Lord received this dismal Sentence, with a meek and resigned Countenance:
He declared in the presence of Almighty God, he had no malice in his Heart to
them that had Condemned him: But freely forgave them all.

He made one, and only one humble request to their Lordships, ( viz.) That for
the short time he had to Live a Prisoner, his Wife, Children, and Friends might
be permitted to come at him. My Lord High Steward told him, their Lordships had
so far a Compassion for him, They would be humble suitors to the King. That he
will remit all the punishments, but the taking off his Head.

Thus Sentence being passed the Lord High Steward broke his Staff, and my Lord
Stafford was led back from the Bar to the Tower. The Ax being carried before
him, (as the Custom is in such cases) with the Edge toward him.

SECT. III.
My Lords PRINCIPLES of FAITH and LOYALTY.
DOubtless the thing which most weighed to my Lord's prejudice; most advanced
the credit of the Evidence; And most influenced both his Prosecutors, and
Judges against him, was a pre-possessed Opinion of wicked Principles, supposed
to be held and practiced by my Lord, as the matter of his Faith and Religion.
It is by many taken for granted, The Papists hold it an Article of Faith, That
to Depose and Murder Kings, to Massacre their Neighbors, and destroy their
Native Country by Fire and Sword, (when the interest of their Religon requires
it) are acts dispensable by the Pope, and meritorious of Heaven. Now what thing
so wicked however, slenderly proved, will not easily be believed against Men so
Principled. My Lord therefore to clear himself, and his Religion from this
heavy, and (as the Papists say) injurious Aspersion, Page 54.
Protested and Declared in the presence of Almighty God, and their Lordships
his Judges; That he hated and detested such Principles, Page 53.
as he did Damnation to himself; And that he could not be more desirous of
Salvation, then he was cordial in hating such Principles. That he ever held
Treason to be the worst of Crimes, and knew no term ill enough to express it.
That he heard with horror the late wicked practices in Scotland. That he
acknowledged the King his lawful Sovereign, and knew no Person or Authority on
Earth, could absolve him from his Allegiance.

And least this might seem a merely extorted profession of a despairing Man; My
Lord endeavored to prove by several convincing Testimonies, he had ever been
Instructed and Educated in the same Sentiments, as the Established Doctrine of
the Roman Catholic Church.

His first Testimony was taken from places of Holy Scripture, Ibid.
particularly That of St. Math. 22. v. 21. Render to Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, etc. From the plain and clear sense of which, and other Texts of Holy
Writ, nothing (he said) in this world was able to remove him.

His second Testimony was taken from the Authority of the General Council of
Constance, Ibid
(to which all Roman Catholics are obliged to submit;) The 15th. Canon and
Definition of which Council is this: Quilibit Tyrannus potest and debet licite
and meritorie occidi per quemcunque Vasallum suum vel Subditum, etiam per
clanculares insidias, and subtiles blanditias vel adulationes non obstante
quocunque Praestito juramento seu confoederatione factis cum eo, non expectata
sententia vel mandato judicis cujuscunque Adversus hunc errorem Satagens haec
Sancta Synodus, exurgere, and ipsum funditus tollere, declarat and desinit,
hujusmodi Doctrinam erroneam esse in fide, and in moribus, ipsamque tanquam
Haereticam, Scandalosam, and ad ^raudes, Deceptiones, Mendacia, Proditiones,
Perjuria, vias dantem, reprobat, and condemnat. Declarat insuper and decernii
quod pertinaciter Doctrinam hanc perniciocissimam asserentes sunt Haeretici,
and tanquam tales juxta Canonicas Sanctiones puniendi. Englished thus, Every
Tyrant lawfully and meritoriously, may, and ought to be Killed by any Vassal or
Subject whatsoever; even by hidden Treacheries and subtle Flatteries or
Adulations, notwithstanding any Oath given, or confederation made with him;
Without expecting the Sentence or Command of any Judge whatsoever, ( which
clause is added in regard of the right of Supreme Temporal Monarchs, over
inferior Princes Subordinate to them.) Against which Error this Holy Synod
(industrious to withstand, and utterly to extirpate it,) does declare and
define, that this Doctrine is Erroneous in Faith and Manners, and the same as
Heretical, Scandalous, and opening a way to Frauds, Deceipts, Lies, Treasons
and Perjuries does dissaprove and condemn; It farther declares and decrees,
that those who obstinately maintain this most pernicious Doctrine, are
Heretics, and as such ought to be punished, according to Canonical Sanctions.

My Lords third Testimony was taken from the Annotations upon the 13th. Chapter
of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, Ibid.
in the English Catholic Edition of the new Testament, set forth by the
College of Divines at Rhemes! The words are these (upon the Text, He that
resists, etc. v. 2.) Whosoever resists, of obeys not his lawful superior,
in those causes wherein he is subject to him, resists Gods appointment, and
sins deadly and is worthy to be punished both in this World by his Superior,
and by God in the next Life. For in Temporal Government and Causes, the
Christians were bound in Conscience to obey, even their Heathen Emperors. And
(upon the Text, Bears not the Sword, etc. v. 4.) There were certain Heretics
called Begardi, that took away all Rule and Superiority; The Wickleffists also
would obey no Prince nor Prelate, if he were once in deadly sin: Some
Protestants of our time, care neither for the one, nor for the other; though
they extol only Secular Power, when it makes for them. The Catholics only
most humbly obey both, according to Gods Ordinance; the one in Temporal Causes,
and the other in Spiritual; in which order both these States have blessedly
flourished in all Christian Countries ever since Christ's time.

My Lords fourth Testimony, Ibid.
was taken from the censure of the Doctors of the famous Faculty of Sorbon, in
the University of Paris, against a Book of Anthony Sanctarelus, treating of
Heresy, Schism, etc. Particularly against the 30th. and 31st. Chapters of the
said Book. The censure of the Faculty my Lord produced in Court, and is as
follows.

Upon the first of April in the year of our Lord 1626. after Mass of the Holy
Ghost; the usual Assembly of Doctors being met in Solemn manner, in the Hall of
the Sorbon College, was heard the relation of the Masters of the same Faculty
deputed for that end, who declared, that in those two abovementioned Chapters,
these propositions were contained. That the Pope can punish Kings and Princes,
with Temporal Penalties, and Depose and Deprive them, of their Kingdoms for the
crime of Heresy, and free their Subjects from their obedience; And that it had
been always the custom in the Church; And for other causes also, as for faults,
if it be expedient; If the Princes be negligent; For the insufficiency, and
unprofitableness of their Persons; Likewise that the Pope has right and power
over Spirituals; and all Temporals also, and that both the powers, Spiritual
and Temporal are in him by Divine right; That it was to be believed, that Power
was granted to the Church and its Chief Pastors, to punish with Temporal
Penalties, (Princes) the transgressors of Divine and Humane Laws, especially if
the Crime be Heresy. They said likewise, that the same Sanctarelus did affirm,
That the Apostles were subject to secular Princes, de facto, non de jure; by
Fact, not by Right; Moreover, That as soon as the Pope is installed, all
Princes begin to be subject unto him. Lastly, they related that he, (
Sanctarelus) expounded the words of Christ, Whatsoever ye shall bind upon
Earth, etc. To be understood not only of the Spiritual, but of the Temporal
Power: That he imposes upon St. Paul, changing his words, by withdrawing the
Negation; and upon many, Authors cited by him. They related many other things
out of the said Sanctarelus, which seemed to them very well to deserve the
grave Animadversions and Censure of the Faculty. The matter therefore being
brought into debate by the Dean, the mature deliberations of all and every
Master being heard, the Faculty has dissapproved and condemned the Doctrine
contained in these propositions and other like expressions in the same
Chapters, as new; False, Erroneous, contrary to the word of God: drawing hatred
upon the Pontificial Dignity; giving occasion to Schism; Derogatory from the
Supreme authority of Kings dependant on God alone, hindering the conversion of
Heathen and Heretical Princes; disturbing the public Peace; Destructive to
Kingdoms, States, and Commonwealths; withdrawing Subjects from Obedience and
Subjection; and exciting to Factions, Rebellions, Seditions, and Murder of
Princes. Given in the Sorbon the 4th. of April 1626.

Taken out of the Archives of the foresaid Faculty, by me Secretary thereof,
the 26th. of September 1679. MASSIN.

MY Lords fifth Testimony, Ibid.
was taken from a little Treatise, writ (as my Lord said) by a Priest of the
Church of Rome, and entitled, Roman Catholic Principles, in Reference to God
and the King. The chief Contents of which Treatise; Because it in short
explains the abovenamed Principles, and clears the Objections usually made on
this Subject. I shall here insert in the Authors own Words, for the Readers
more ample satisfaction.

IS it not strange and severe, ( says this Author) That Principles, (of
Treason, Rebellion, Murder, etc.) and those pretended of Faith too, should be
imposed upon Men, which they themselves renounce and detest? If the Turk's
Alcoran should in like manner be urged upon us, and we hanged up for
Mahumetans, all we could do or say in such a Case, would be patiently to die,
with Protestation of our own Innocence. And this is the posture of our present
Condition; We abhor, we renounce, we a^^minate such Principles; We protest
against them, and seal our Protestations with our Dying Breaths. What shall we
say? What can we do more? To accuse men as guilty in matters of Faith, which
they never owned, is the same thing, as to condemn them for matters of Fact,
which they never did.

You press the Question, and say, some of our General Councils, several Papal
Decrees, and many of our Doctors and Divines, assert the forementioned
Principles. Sir, I have been instructed in the Articles of my Faith, and I
acknowledge the lawful Authority of General Councils: yet I profess I never
learnt, or found asserted in any of them, any such Principles. And I propose
unto you this plain and short Dilemma; Either the abovenamed Principles are
esteemed by us as matters of Faith, or not: If they be, what further can be
required of us, than to deny and forsake such a Faith? And this we constantly
do. But if they be not matters of Catholic Faith, nor owned by us as such, why
are Catholics, as Catholics, punished for them? why is our Religion
persecuted on that account? Let those, in God's Name, if any therebe, of what
Religion soever, who bold such Tenants, suffer for them: why should the
Innocent be involved with the Guilty? there is neither Reason nor Justice in it.

Hereunto some Persons (I hope out of zeal and misinformation, An Objection,
rather than malice) stick not to say, That Dispensations, and I know not what
Indulgences and Pardons, whereby to legitimate the Crimes of Lying and
Forswearing, when the Interest of our Church requires it, is a main part of our
Religion: and by consequence, the denial of our Principles, is no sufficient
Justification of our Innocence. I answer; First, It is in the highest measure
censorious in any one, to impose upon all our Ancestors, Answered.
and the greatest part of mankind, who are, or have been so long together
Members of our Religion, such an excess of Folly and Wickedness, as must needs
have perverted all Humane Society. Secondly, If we could lawfully deny the
Principles of our Faith when Interest requires, why have we lost our Estates,
our Liberties, our Lives for the profession of it? To what purpose are Oaths
and Tests devised to entangle us? How impertinently is the frequenting the
Protestant Church, and Receiving the Communion, proposed unto us, and refused
by us? Thirdly, Though many men may be induced to Lie, and Forswear, when they
have some hopes or prospect thereby of Temporal Advantage; yet, that persons
dying for their Conscience and Religion, (as diverse have done, and those no
Fools, even by the Confession of our Adversaries) should be so stupendiously
sottish and mad, either to imagine, that Lies and Perjuries, for concealment of
Treason, Murder, Massacre, and Destruction of others by Fire and Sword, should
be Acts of Virtue, pleasing to God, dispensable by the Pope, and Meritorious of
Heaven; or that, on the contrary, knowing and believing (as needs they must)
such Monsters and Horrors to be odious and detestable in the sight both of God
and Man, they should nevertheless, upon the very brink of Eternity, wittingly
and willingly, cast themselves headlong into an assured Damnation; and this at
a time when they might have saved both Bodies and Souls, by merely discharging
a good Conscience, in acknowledging the Truth, and becoming honest men. This, I
say, is Inhumane, and contradictory to all Sense and Reason to believe.

Now therefore, I come to what you so often, and so earnestly press me to, viz.
to satisfy the world, The intent of this Epistle.
and clear my self, my Fellow Sufferers, and my Religion, from the imputation
laid upon us, on pretense of such Principles, by a true and candid Explanation
of my Belief and Judgment in the main points of Faith and Loyalty, controverted
between Catholics and Protestants, as they severally relate to GOD and the
KING.

is termed the Roman Catholic Church; The Qualifications abovementioned, (
viz.) Unity, Indeficiency, Visibility, Succession, and Universality,) being
applicable to no other Church, or Assembly whatsoever.

9. From the Testimony and Authority of This Church, it is, that We Receive,
and Believe the Scriptures to be God's Word: And as She can Mat. 16. 18. 1 Timothy
3. 15. Mat. 18. 17.
assuredly tell Us, This or That Book is God's Word; so can she with the like
Assurance, tell us also the True Sense and Meaning of it, in Controverted
Points of Faith; The same Spirit that Writ the Scripture, Isai. 59. 21. Joh.
14. 26.
Enlightening Her to Understand, both It, and all Matters Necessary to
Salvation. From These Grounds it Follows,

10. All, and only Divine Revelations delivered by God unto the Church, and
proposed by Her to be Believed as such, are, and ought to be esteemed Articles
of Faith; and the contraty Opinions, Heresy. And,

11. As an Obstinate Separation from the Unity of the Church, in known declared
Matters of Faith, is formal 1 Cor. 11. 19. Mat. 18. 17.
Heresy; So a wilful Separation from the Visible Unity of the same Church,
What Heresy, and what Schism! How Matters of Faith are proposed by the Church.
in Matters of Subordination and Government, is formal Tit. 3 10. 1 Cor. 1. 10.
cap. 12. 25.
Schism.

12. The Church proposes unto Us Matters of Faith: First, and chiefly, By the
Joh. 5. 39.
Holy Scripture, in Points plain and Intelligible in it. Secondly, By Acts 15.
per tot.
Definitions of General Councils, in Points not sufficiently Explained in
Scripture. Thirdly, By 2 These. 2. 15. cap. 3. 6. 2, Tim. 2. 2.
Apostolical Traditions, derived from Christ and his Apostles, to all
Succeeding Ages. Fourthly, By her Jam. 2. 18. Gal. 1. 7, 8.
Practice, Worship, and Ceremonies, Confirming her Doctrines.

PARAGRAPH II. Of Spiritual and Temporal Authority.
1. GEneral Councils (which are the Church of God, What is the Authority of
General Councils
Representative) have no Commission from Christ to Frame New Matters of Faith,
(these being sole Divine Revelations) but only to Deuteronomy. 17. 8. Mat. 18. 17.
Acts 15. pertot. Luke 10 16. Heb. 13. 7. 17.
explain and ascertain unto us, what anciently was, and is received and
retained, as of Faith in the Church, upon arising Debates and Controversies
about them. The Definitions of which, General Councils, in matters of Faith
only, and proposed in such, oblige, under pain of Heresy, all the Faithful, to
a Submission of Judgment. But,

2. It is no Article of Faith to believe, An Explanation of the same Authority.
That General Councils cannot Err, either in matters of Fact or Discipline,
alterable by circumstances of time and place; or in matters of Speculation or
Civil Policy, depending on mere humane Judgment, or Testimony. Neither of these
being Divine Revelations Joh. 14, 16.
deposited in the Catholic Church; in regard to which alone, she has the 1 Timothy 6. 20.
promised Assistance of the Holy Ghost. Hence it is deduced,

3. If a General Council (much less a Papal Consistory) should undertake to
depose a King, and absolve his Subjects from their Allegiance; A Deduction from
thence concerning Allegiance.
no Catholic, as Catholic, is bound to submit to such a Decree. Hence also it
follows:

4. The Subjects of the King of England lawfully may, A second Deduct on
concerning the same.
without the least breach of any Catholic Principle, Renounce, even upon Oath,
the Teaching, Mantaining, or Practicing the Doctrine of deposing Kings
Excommunicated for Heresy, by any Authority whatsoever, as Repugnant to the
fundamental Laws of the Nation, Injurious to Sovereign Power, Destructive to
the Peace and Government; and by consequence, in His Majesty's Subjects,
Impious and Damnable. Yet not properly Heretical, taking the Word Heretical in
that connatural, genuine sense, it is usually understood in the Catholic
Church; Of the Oath of Allegiance.
on account of which, and other Expressions, (no wise appertaining to Loyalty,)
it is, that Catholics of tender Consciences refuse the Oath commonly call*d
the Oath of Allegience.

5. Catholics believe, The Bishop of Rome Supreme Head of the Church but not
Infallible.
That the Bishop of Rome is the Successor of St Peter, Mat. 16. 17. Luke 22.
31. Jo 21. 17.
Vicar of Jesns Christ upon Earth, and Head of the whole Catholic Church;
which Church is therefore sitly styled Roman Catholic, being an universal Body
Ephesians. 4, 11, etc.
united under one visible Head. Nevertheless,

6. It is no matter of Faith to believe, That the Pope is in himself
Infallible, separate from a General Council, even in Expounding the Faith: By
consequence Papal Definitions or Decrees, though ex Cathedra, as they term
them, (taken exclusively from a General Council, or Universal Acceptance of the
Church) oblige none under Pain of Heresy, to an interior Assent.

7. Nor do Catholics as Catholics believe, that the Pope has any direct, or
indirect Authority over the Temporal Power and Jurisdiction of Princes. Hence,
Nor has any Temporal Authority over Princes.
if the Pope should pretend to Absolve or Dispense with His Majesty's Subjects
from their Allegiance, upon account of Heresy or Schism, such Dispensation
would be vain, and null; and all Cathelick Subjects (notwithstanding such
Dispensation or Absolution) would be still bound in Conscience to defend their
King and Country, at the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes, 1 Pet. 2. v. 17.
etc.
even against the Pope himself, in case he should invade the Nation. The Church
not responsible for the Errors of particular Divines.


8. And as for Problematical Disputes, or Errors of particular Divines, in
this, or any other matter whatsoever, the Catholic Church is no wise
responsible for them: Nor, are Catholics as Catholics, justly punishable on
their Account. But,

9. As for the King Killing Doctrine, King-Killing Doctrine Damnable Heresy.
or Murder of Princes, Excommunicated for Heresy; It is an Article of Faith in
the Catholic Church, and expressly declared in the General Council of
Constance, Conc. Constable. Sess, 15.
That such Doctrine is Damnable and Heretical, being contrary to the known Laws
of God, and Nature.

10. Personal Misdemeanors of what Nature soever, Personal misdemeanors not to
be imputed to the Church.
ought not to be Imputed to the Catholic Church, when not Justifyable (...)
the Tenants of her Faith and Doctrine; For which Reason, though the Stories of
the Paris Massacre; the Irish Cruelties; Or Powder Plot, had been exactly true,
(which yet for the most part are Notoriously mis-related) nevertheless
Catholics as Catholics ought not to Suffer for such Offenses, any more then
the Eleven Apostles ought to have Suffered for Judas's Treachery.

It is an Article of the Catholic Faith to believe, No Power on Earth can
authorize Men to Lie, Forswear, Murder, etc.
that no Power on Earth can License Men to Lie, to Forswear, and Perjure
themselves, to Massacre their Neighbors, or destroy their Native Country, on
pretense of promoting the Catholic Cause, or Religion; Furthermore, all
Pardons and Dispensations granted, or pretended to be granted, in order to any
such ends or Designs* have no other validity or Effect, then to add Sacrilege
and Blasphemy to the abovementioned Crimes.

12. The Doctrine of Equivocation or Mental Reservation, Equivocat^on not
allowed in the Church.
however wrongfully Imposed on the Catholic Religion, is notwithstanding,
neither taught, nor approved by the Church, as any part of her Belief. On the
contrary, Simplicity, and Godly Sincerity, are constantly recommended by her,
as truly Christian Virtues, necessary to the Conservation of Justice, Truth,
and Common Society.

PARAGRAPH III. Of some Particular controverted Points of Faith.
1. EVery Catholic is obliged to believe, Of Sacramental Absolution
that when a Sinner Ex. 18. 21. 2 Cor. 7. 10.
Repents him of his Sins from the bottom of his Heart, and Psa. 32. 5. Pro.
28. 13.
Acknowledges his Transgressions to God and his Act. 19. 18. 1 Cor. 4, 1, Jam.
5. 16.
Ministers, the Dispensers of the Mysteries of Christ, resolving to turn from
his evil ways, Luke 3. 8.
and bring forth Fruits worthy of Penance, there is (then and no otherwise) an
Authority left by Christ to Absolve such a Penitent Sinner from his Sins: which
Authority Christ gave to his Joh. 20. 21. etc. Mat. 18. 18.
Apostles, and their Successors, the Bishops and Priests of the Catholic
Church, in those words, when he said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost, whose Sins you
shall forgive, they are forgiven unto them, etc.

2. Though no Creature whatsoever can make Tit. 3. 5.
Condign satisfaction, Of Satisfaction by penitential works
either for the Guilt of Sin, or the Pain Eternal due to it; 2 Cor. 3. 5.
This satisfaction being proper to Christ our Savior only; yet Penitent
Sinners Redeemed by Christ, may, as Members of Christ, in some measure Act. 26.
20. Jonas 3. 5. etc. Psa. 102. 9. etc. Psa. 109. 23. Dan. 9. 3. Joel. 2. 12.
Luke 11. 41. Acts 10. 4.
satisfy by Prayer, Fasting, Alms Deeds, and other Works of Piety, for the
Temporal Pain, which by order of Divine Justice sometimes remains due, after
the guilt of Sin, and Pains Eternal are ( gratis) remitted. These Penitential
Works are notwithstanding satisfactory no otherwise, than as joined and applied
to that satisfaction, which Jesus made upon the Cross; Indulgences are not
Remission of Sins, but only of Canonical Penances. Abuses herein not to be
charged on the Church.
in virtue of which alone, all our good works find a grateful 1 Pet. 2. 5.
acceptance in God's Sight.

3. The Guilt of Sin, or Pain Eternal due to it, is never remitted by
Indulgences; but only such 1 Cor. 5. 3. etc.
Temporal Punishments as remain due after the Guilt is remitted; These
Indulgences being nothing else than a 2 Cor. 2. 6. etc.
Mitigation or Relaxation upon just causes, of Canonical Penances, enjoined by
the Pastors of the Church on Penitent Sinners, according to their several
Degrees of Demerit. And if any abuses or mistakes be sometimes committed, in
point either of Granting or Gaining Indulgences, through the Remisness, or
Ignorance of particular Persons, contrary to the ancient Custom and Discipline
of the Church; such Abuses or Mistakes cannot rationally be charged on the
Church, There is a Purgatory or State, where Souls departing this Life with
some blemish are purified
nor rendered matter of Derision, in prejudice to her Faith and Doctrine.

4. Catholics hold there is a Purgatory, that is to say, a Place, or State,
where Souls departing this Life, with Remission of their Sins, as to the
Eternal Guilt or Pain Nu. 14. 20, etc. 2 Samuel 12. 13. etc.
yet Obnoxious to some Temporal Punishment still Remaining due, Or not
perfectly freed from the Blemish of some Pro. 24. 16. Mat. 12. 36. and Cap. 5.
22. 26.
venial Defects or Deordinations, (as Idle Words, etc. not liable to Damnation)
are Mat. 5. 26. 1 Cor. 3. 15.
purged before their Admittence into Heaven; where nothing that is Rev. 21. 27.
defiled can enter. Furthermore,

5. Catholics also hold, Prayers for the Dead available to them. Superfluous
Questions about Purgatory.
That such Souls so detained in Purgatory, being the Living Members of Christ
Jesus, are Relieved by the 1 Cor. 15. 29. Coll. 1. 24. 2 Mac. 12. 42, etc. 1
Jo. 5. 16.
Prayers and Suffrages of their Fellow members here on Earth: But where this
place is? Of what Nature or Quality the Pains are? How long each Souls is
detained there; After what manner the Suffrages made in their behalf are
applied? Whether by way of Satisfaction or Intercession? etc. are Questions
Superfluous, and Impertinent as to Faith.

6. No Man, Of the merit of good Works, through the merits of Christ.
though just, Jo. 15. 5. 16.
can Merit either an Increase of Sanctity or Happiness in this Life, or Eternal
Glory in the next, Independent on the Merits and Passion of Christ;
Nevertheless in, and by the Merits of Christ Jesus, Mat. 16. 27. Cap. 5. 12.
Cap. 10. 42. 2 Cor. 5. 10. 2 Timothy 4. 8.
the good Works of a just Man, proceeding from Grace and Charity, are
acceptable to God, so far forth as to be, through his Goodness, and Sacred
Promise, Truly Meritorious of Eternal Life.

7. It is an Article of the Catholic Faith; Christ really present in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist.
That in the most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, there is Truly, and Really,
contained the Mat. 25. 26. Mark 14. 22. Luke 22. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 23. etc. Cor.
10. 16.
Body of Christ, which was delivered for us, and his Blood, which was shed for
the Remission of Sins; The substance of Bread and Wine, being by the powerful
Words of Christ, changed into the Substance of his Blessed Body and Blood, the
Species or Accidents of Bread, and Wine still remaining. Thus,

8. Christ is not present in this Sacrament, according to his natural way of
Existence, But after a supernatural manner
that is, with extension of parts, in order to place etc. but after a
Supernatural manner, one, and the same, in many places, and whole, in every
part of the Symbols. This therefore is a Real, Substantial, yet Sacramental
Presence of Christ's Body and Blood, not exposed to the external Senses, nor
Obnoxious to corporeal Contingences.

9. Neither is the Body of Christ in this Holy Sacrament, Separated from his
Blood, Whole Christ in either species. Hence Communicants under one kind; are
no wise deprived either of the Body or Blood of Christ. Of the Sacrifice of the
Mass. Worship of Images wrongfully Imposed on Catholics. Yet there is some
Veneration due both to Pictures,
or his Blood from his Body, or either of both disjoined from his Soul and
Divinity, but all and whole Jo. 6. 48. 50, 51, 57, 58. Acts 2. 42.
living Jesus is entirely contained under either Species; so that whosoever
receives under one kind, is truly partaker of the whole Sacrament, and no wise
deprived either of the Body or Blood of Christ. True it is,

10. Our Savior Jesus Christ left unto us his Body and Blood, under two
distinct Species or Kinds; in doing of which, he instituted not only a
Sacrament, but also a Sacrifice; Lu 2^. 19, etc.
a Commemorative Sacrifice distinctly 1 Cor. 11. 26.
showing his Death or Bloody Passion, until he come. For as the Sacrifice of
the Cross was performed by a distinct Effusion of Blood, so is the same
Sacrifice Commemorated in that of the Heb. 13. 10.
Altar, by a distinction of the Symbols. Jesus therefore is here given not only
to us, but Luke 22. 19.
for us: and the Church thereby enriched with a true, proper, and propitiatory
Mal. 1. 11.
Sacrifice, usually termed Mass.

11. Catholics Renounce all Divine Worship, and Adoration of Images or
Pictures Luke 4. ^
God alone we Worship and Adore: nevertheless we make use of Pictures, and
place them in Ex. 25. 18.
Churches and Oratories, to reduce our wandering thoughts, and Enliven our
Memories toward Heavenly things. And farther, we allow a certain Honor and
Veneration to the Picture of Christ, of the Virgin Mary, etc. beyond what is
due to every Profane Figure; not that we believe any Divinity, or Virtue in
the Pictures themselves, for which they ought to be Honored, but because the
Honor given to the Pictures is referred to the Prototype, or things
represented. In like manner.

12. There is a kind of Honor and Veneration Respectively due to the Bible, to
the Cross, to the Name of Jesus, to Churches, to the Sacraments, etc. as Jos.
7. 6. Ex. 3. 5. Psa. 99. 5. Ph. 2. 10. Luke 3. 16. Acts 19. 12.
things peculiarly appertaining to God; And other sacred things.
also to the Jo. 12. 86.
glorified Saints in Heaven, as the Domestic Friends of God; yea, 1 Peter 2.
17. Romans 13. 7.
to Kings, Magistrates, and Superiors on Earth, as the Vicegerents of God; To
whom Honor is due, Honor may be given, without any Derogation to the Majesty
of God, or that Divine Worship appropriate to him. Furthermore,

13. Catholics believe, That the blessed Saints in Heaven replenished with
Charity, Rev. 5. 8.
pray for us their Fellow Members here on Earth; that they Luke 15. 7.
Rejoice at our Conversion; Prayers to Saints lawful.
that seeing God, they 1 Cor. 13. 12*
see and know in him all things suitable to their happy state; that God is
Inclinable to hear their Requests made in our behalf; Ex. 32. 13. 2 Chronicles. 6 42.
and for their sakes, grants Us many Favors; That therefore it is Good, and
Profitable to Desire their Intercession; And that this manner of Invocation is
no more Injurious to Christ our Mediator, nor Superabundant in it self, than it
is for one Christian to beg the Prayers and Assistence of Romans 15. 30.
another in this World. Notwithstanding all which, Catholics are taught not so
to Rely on the Prayers of Others, Yet so as not to neglect our Duties.
as to neglect their own James 2. 17. 30, etc.
Duty to God: in Imploring his Divine Mercy and Goodness: Romans 13. ^
in Mortifying the Deeds of the Flesh: in Romans 12. 2.
Despising the World: in Loving and Gal. 5. 6.
Serving God, and their Neighbors: in Following the Footsteps of Christ our
Lord, who is the John 14. 6.
Way, the Truth, and the Life: To whom be Honor and Glory for ever, and ever,
Amen.

THese are the Principles, These the Treasons, These the Idolatryes, and
Superstitions, which, though no other then what We have Received of our
Forefathers, and what the greatest part of the Christian World now profess: yet
have drawn upon Us poor Catholics in England such Dreadful Punishments. A
Conclusion from the Premises.
I Beseech you Sir, consider our Case, without Passion or Prejudice, and I am
confident you will see, We are not such Monsters, as our Adversaries Represent
Us to be: nor entertain such Principles, as are Inconsistent with our Duty to
God and the King.

You seem to say, This very Plot, with which We are charged, proves us Guilty
of wicked Principles. But, under Favor, You here commit a Vicious Circle in
way of Arguing: For first, here are wicked Principles alleged to make good the
Proof of a Plot: And these being denied, An Objection Answered.
the Plot is introduced to make out the wicked Principles: As if a Man should
say a thing, because he thought so: and give no Reason why he thought so, but
only because he said so; which instead of Proof, is to beg the Question.
Certain I am, Catholics both Taught, and Practis^d Principles of Loyalty, at a
Time, when the King and Kingdom felt the Dire Effects of contrary Persuasions.

In Fine, whatsoever is pretended against Us, it is manifest We suffer for our
Religion, and for our Religion wrongfully traduced. It is a farther Comfort to
Us, that our Sufferings (God be praised) are in some measure, Catholics suffer
for their Religion.
not unlike to those of Christ our Lord: For it was laid to his Charge, as it
is to Ours, that he was a Traitor to Lake 23. 2.
Caesar; That he perverted the People, and endeavovred the John 11. 48.
Destruction of Church and State: Nor were there wanting, then as now, Their
Sufferings not unlike to those of Christ our Lord.
an OATS and BEDLOE, Matt. 26. 60.
two false Witnesses to Swear all this.

Thus God, Romans 8. 29. Verse 17.
I hope, has Predestined Us, (as the Apostle says) to be conform to the
Image of his Son: to the end, that Suffering with Him, We may (through his
Mercy) be Glorified together with him.

Sweet Jesus Bless our Sovereign: Pardon our Enemies: Grant Us Patience: and
Establish Peace, and Charity in our Nation.

THus much of my Lord's Principles in Reference to God and the King; Whether
they be agreeable to Reason; and conformable to the Law and Ghospel of Christ,
I leave to the Impartial Reader to Judge.

SECT. IV. My Lord's Declaration before the House of Lords after his
Condemnation.
SOon after my Lords Trial, several of his Relations and Acquaintance, (some
out of zeal against Popery, and others out of kindness to my Lord,) were daily
urgent with him to make Discoveries of all he knew, as the only remaining
remedy whereby to save his Life, regain the Kings favor, and attract the
applause of the whole Nation. My Lord always replied, He was most willing and
ready out of a mere sense of Duty and Conscience (independent of any Temporal
advantage to himself) to discover with all imaginable Sincerity, the utmost
utmost of what he knew, either to the King, or House of Lords, when ever they
required it. The Lords being informed hereof, Ordered his appearance before
them the next day. When he came, and had audience granted, he made his
acknowledgments to this effect. That he thought it no crime in any Man to wish
his Neighbor might be of the same Religion wherein he himself hoped to be
saved; Nay to seek, and promote it by such ways and means, as the Laws of God,
and the Nation allow. That there had been at diverse times, and on sundry
occasions, endeavors used, and overtures made to obtain an Abrogation, or at
least a Mitigation of Severities against Catholics: But this to be procured no
otherwise then by Legal and Parliamentary means. That he himself went to Breda,
whilst the King was there, and propounded 100000 l. in behalf of the
Catholics, to take off the penal Laws. That after the King came in, there was
a Bill brought into the House, in favor of Catholics, but it was opposed by
my Lord Chancellor Hide. That there had likewise been framed by the Lord
Bristol and others, (in order to the proposing of them in Parliament,) several
forms of Oaths, contained in such terms as might fully express all Duty and
Allegiance to the King; yet not entangle tender Consciences with Clauses and
Provisoes, disagreeable to Faith, and no wise appertaining to Loyalty; but
neither did this succeed. That afterward he had offered some proposals, as
well to the Lord Chancellor at his House at Kenfington, as to the Duke of
York, concerning some lawful expedients, conducing to the good, (as he
thought,) both of Catholics and the whole Nation. And also about Dissolving
the long Parliament; the substance of which he likewise communicated to my Lord
Sbastsbury, who said, He doubted not, but that there would come great
advantages to the King by it. These he avouched were the chief, and only
Designs he ever had, or knew of amongst Catholics, for promoting their
Religion; Of more then these he protested before Almighty God and their
Lordships, he was wholly ignorant. But this Declaration not being satisfactory
toward the detecting any Damnable Conspiracy, the Lords thought sit without
any further Examination to remand him back to the Tower.

On this occasion, there run about both Town and Country an universal Rumor.
That the Lord Stafford had now made a full and perfect Discovery of the whole
Plot; And that the Papists could not for the future have the Impudence to deny
it, after the Confession (though to save his Life,) of so Honorable a Person;
But this proved a mistake. And by the way it was very observable, My Lords
Adversaries took this false Alarm with so much eagerness and joy, as
sufficiently denoted, they were not well assured of the truth of the former
Evidence given against him.

SECT. V. My Lord's Comportment and Exercise after Sentence.
THe greatest part of his time from his last Sentence to his final End, he
employed in serious Recollection and fervent Prayer, wherein he seemed to
receive a daily increase, both of Courage and Comfort, as if the Divine
Goodness (say the Papists) intended to ripen him for Martyrdom, and give him a
taste of Heaven beforehand. Indeed he behaved himself in all things like a
Man, whose Innocence had banished the Fear and horror of Death.

Some few days before his Execution he received a Letter, which because it is
foully suspected to have come from some College or Seminary beyond Seas, I
shall here set it down verbatim, to the end every one may see how the Priests
treat their Penitents, in the condition and circumstances my Lord was in.

My Lord,
THE Character I bear, gives me some Title, And the singular esteem I have for
your Noble and Truly virtuous Person and Family, gives me Confidence to present
your Lordship, in this your last and Grand Affair, with a Consolatory or rather
Congratulatory Letter. As I daily make my Supplication to God on your behalf;
so I hope I may make my Addresses to you on Gods behalf. You are chosen by the
King of Kings, to share with him in Immortal Crowns: You are called from an
Abisse of misery to the top of Felicity: You now pay a debt on the score of
Grace, which is due, and which you must shortly have paid to the course of
Nature. And herein my Lord, you are adorned with all the Trophies of Jesus's
Victory; He was Condemned of Luke 23. Matthew. 26.
High Treason by false Witnesses for the love of you: And you stand Condemned
of the same Crimes, by the like Evidence for the love of him. Yet you shall not
die my Lord: It Is a mistake of this blind World, you shall only pass from a
state of Romans 7.
Death to a state of Life; True Life, Eternal Life; you shall be Transformed
into him, whose Exodus 3. 14.
essence is to live; Coll. 1.
In whom, with whom, and by whom; you shall enjoy all that is Exodus 33.
good; all that is lovely; alt that is pleasant: And this enjoyment shall be in
all its fullness, altogether, all at once; without Interruption, without Bound,
Limit, or End.

The Omnipotent Creator^ of Heaven and Earth; The searcher of Hearts; The
dreadful Judge of Men and Angels: He who justly might otherwise peradventure
have cast you into Eternal Fire; From whose Sentence there is no Appeal. He, I
say, will now be forgetful of past Frailties, regard you with a merciful Eye,
with a pleasing Countenance, a loving heart, an open Arm, an endeared
affection; Millions of Laurels hang over your Head; Thousands of Millions of
Glories and Sweets, attend you, which neither 1 Cor. 2
Eye has seen, nor Ear has heard, nor has entered into the heart of man. The
Virgin Mother shall meet and conduct you to her beloved Son; The Apostles,
Martyrs, and Confessors, shall receive and accompany you; And all the blessed
Quires of Saints and Angels shall Celebrate your victory, and Luke 15.
Sing Halleluja's to their celestial King for his Inspeakable goodness to you.

My Lord, You were made for the enjoyment of God, and now you arrive at the
accomplishment of that End; you owe to God all you have, and all you are; And
now you restore to him all, both what you have, and what you are. O happy
Restoration, where the advantage is wholly yours, where Misery is turned into
Bliss, where Temporal into Eternal, where God is found, where Death ( as the
Apostle says) is Phil. 1. 21.
Gain. The Innocence of your Cause, The Dignity of your Religion for which you
Suffer, entitles you to the merits of the Cross, and Incorporates You to the
Blood and Passion of Jesus your Savior. 2. Tim. 2. 12.
If we shall be dead with him ( says St. Paul,) we shall live together with
him; If we suffer with him, we shall Reign with him. Hence our Savior himself;
He Luke 9. 24.
that loses his Life for me, shall save it. Again, If John 12. 26.
any Man will serve me, let him follow me. And where I am, there shall my
Servant be also. You are going to the Apoc. 19
Nuptials of the Lamb. God who is all good, is pleased to ^ John 3 2.
Impart himself entirely to you. Love has made him wholly yours; What need you
fear? What can you desire? He that dyed for the love of you, will now reap the
Fruits of his pains, and joy himself in you, with delights proportionable to
his own Goodness and Merits. You are Select from amongst Cant. 5.
Thousands for the Espousals of Love; Let nothing either past or present deject
you; nothing disturb you nothing retard you; John 14. 1.
Let not your heart be troubled, ( says our Savior) nor let it be afraid.

As for the Crimes for which you stand Condemned, God and your own Conscience
knows you are Innocent; All un-interested Men believe you so; Passion and
prejudice against your Religion, has advanced the credit of Perjured Persons,
and influenced your Adversaries to carry on your Death. Had you been no
Catholic, we all know, you had never been a Condemned Man; So that it is
palpably manifest you Die for your Religion, and for your Religion wrongfully
traduced. What greater comfort? What greater glory? What greater happiness, can
arrive to a true Christian? Matthew. 5. 11.
Blessed shall you be ( says our Savior,) when Men shall revile you, and
persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you Falsely for my sake;
Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in Heaven.

Concerning your real defects and frailties; Take courage; take confidence in
God, my Lord; I have already told you, what right you have to the Passion of
Christ; Your present Death, is more then a Pledge of future Pardon. Luke 7. 47.
Many sins are forgiven her ( says our Savior to Magdalen,) because she loved
much; to him that loves less, less is forgiven. Now what it is to love much,
he himself shows, saying, John 15. 13.
No Man has greater Love then this; That a Man lay down his Life for his
Friend. Hence the Spouse in the Canticles. Cant. 8. 6.
Love is strong as death, etc. And our Savior in express terms assures us.
Mat. 10. 39.
He that loses his Life for me, shall find it.

First therefore, acknowledge your faults, with a Penitent Heart, and firmly
believe what the Scripture avoucheth. 1 John 1. 9.
If we confess our Sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our Sins, and
cleanse us from all Iniquity. Next offer with a cheerful Heart your Life to
God; In satisfaction for your offenses; In union of the Sufferings of Jesus
Christ; In a Sacrifice of Love. And then doubt not in the least but that Dying,
as you do, in, and for the Profession of your Faith; Jesus has signed your
Pardon, and pronounced upon your Soul, those Life giving words. Thy Sins are
forgiven thee, Lu. 7. 48. etc. 50
Thy Faith has saved thee; Go in Peace.

Neither let any endearments toward your Wife, Children, Friends or Family
enfeeble your mind, check your Love, or imbitter your Joy. Remember that
Sentence of our Savior. Mat. 10. 37.
He that loves Son or Daughter above me, is not worthy of me. Again, Cap. 19.
29.
Every one that has forsaken Houses, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Wife, or
Children, or Lands, for my Names sake, shall receive an hundred fold, and
possess eternal Life; You cannot give God too much; You can bestow nothing on
him, but what you have received of him; and what, upon many accounts, is
infinitely due to him. But in reality, my Lord, you do not desert your Friends,
nor they you, by rendering your self and them to God, suffering for Jesus; He it
is stands Charged with the care of your Wife, Children, and Family; He
styles himself, Psalm. 63. 5.
The Father of Orphans, and Judge of Widows. As he Exodus 20. 5.
punishes to the fourth Generation of them that hate him; So he blesses, unto
thousands of them that love and follow him. Assure your self, my Lord, That for
this one Heroic Act, of giving your life Mat. ^ 10.
for Justice, for Innocence, for God, and Religion; you will not only secure to
your self everlasting Salvation, but draw upon all your Family and Posterity
thousands of Benedictions. The Justice of our Lord ( says David, Psalm. 103. 1^
upon the Childrens Children, of them that keep his Covenant. Again, Psalm. 112.
1.
Blessed is the Man that fears the Lord, that delights in his Precepts, his
Seed shall be powerful on Earth; the generation of the just shall be Blessed.
Lastly, that Sentence of Ecclesiastes will fittly appertain to you; Eccle. ^9.
His memory shall not pass away, and his name shall be preserved from
Generation to Generation. Nations shall declare his Wisdom, and the Church show
forth his Praise.

I shall not undertake to dictate unto your Lordship, what Prayers or
Elevations of heart, are most proper on this occasion; The Holy Ghost, whose
Spouse, whose Son, whose Temple, whose Victim you are, will inspire you with
better thoughts then I can suggest; I shall therefore here content my self with
some few Citations of sacred Texts, out of which you may upon occasion draw the
comfort of Devotion. Psalm. 27. 12.
Evil Witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity has belyed it self; I
believe to see the goods of our Lord in the Land of the Living. John 11. 25.
I am the Resurrection and the Life; He that believes in me, shall not dye for
ever. Jsa. 43. 1.
Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy name, thou art
mine. (...)
Do not fear, for I am with thee, do not decline, for my right hand has
sustained thee. Psalm 91. 14.
Because he has trusted in me, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because
he has known my name; He shall cry unto me, and I will hear him; I am with him
in Tribulation, I will deliver him, and will glorisie him, with length of days
will I replenish him, and will show him my Salvation. (...)
In perpetual charity have I loved thee; therefore I have drawn thee to me,
taking Compassion on thee. Psalm 77. 26.
My heart and my flesh has fainted. O God of my heart, my inheritance, God for
ever. John 16. 20
The World shall rejoice, and you shall be sorrowful; But your sorrow shall be
turned into Joy, and your Joy none shall take from you. Verse 33
Be confident, I have overcome the World. Psalm. 27. 9.
Be thou my helper, do not forsake me, neither despise me, O God my Savior.
Psalm. 31. ^
In thee O Lord have I trusted, let me not be confounded. John. 14. 19.
I live and you shall live; You shall know that I am in my Father, and you in
me, and I in you, Romans 8. 38.
Certain I am, that neither Death nor Life, etc. can separate us from the Love
of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Rom 14. 8.
Whether we Live or Die, we are our Lords. Phil. 1. 21.
To me, to Live is Christ, and to Die is gain. Verse 23.
I desire to be Dissolved, and to be with Christ. Psalm. 30. 5.
Into thy hands O Lord I commend my Spirit. Mat. 25. 34.
Come ye blessed of my Father, possess the Kingdom prepared for you. Luke 23. 43
This day shall thou be with me in Paradise.

The God of hope fill you with all Joy, Romans 15, 13.
and Peace in believing, that you may abound in hope and virtue of the Holy
Ghost.

Your Lordships most devoted Servant in our Lord. N. N.


THose hours he spared from Prayer or necessary repose, he bestowed part in the
entertainment of his Friends (though indeed none were permitted to come at him,
but under severe Provisoes and Restrictions) amongst whom he demeaned himself
with exceeding Sweetness, Candor and Alacrity of Spirit, Connatural to him
always; but more especially after he had an assurance of his Death; Insomuch
that he could not endure to see any in grief of dejection on his account. For
this reason his sad and disconsolate Lady (who alone touched his heart, and who
could no longer support the weight of her affliction,) was forced entirely to
absent her self, from him the day before his Passage out of this World.

Some moments likewise he allowed to give his last Adieu by Letters to his
nearest Relations; particularly to his aforesaid most Dear Lady, whose
incomparable virtue, and above forty years experienced constant affection to
him, had taken a deep impression in his Soul; But because the Letters
themselves express his mind and disposition better then I can describe it: Read
here these few Copies, which good fortune brought authentic to my hands.

To my most Dear and Kind Wife.
My Dear and most Kind Wife.
GOD of his Mercy and Goodness, The first Letter to his Lady.
I mest humbly beseech him to reward you for your extraordinary Kindness and
Love to me; I am sure, no Man ever had a better Wife in all kinds, then you
have been unto me; I am most heartily sorry, that I have not been able to show
how happy I have held my self, in the great blessing which God was pleased to
afford me in having you, not only for the great Family to which you are the
undoubted Heir; and Estate you brought me and mine; but for the great Love you
have always born me. I sincerely ask you Pardon with all my heart, for all that
I have done to give you any dislike; I know you will forgive me out of your
kindness and affection, you have so often shown unto me more then I deserved;
If I should repeat all the kindness and affection you have shown unto me, and
of all which I am most sensible, I should not know when to end: God reward you.
You were present this day when Mr. Lievtenent brought me word of the day of my
Death, I know the trouble it brought unto you. I do most willingly submit my
self to Gods Holy will, and since he know how Innocent I am, and how Falsely I
am Sworn against, I am most confident, that the most Blessed Trinity will,
through the Merits and Passion of our Savior Jesus Christ, grant me a place in
Heaven of happiness, to glorify God to all Eternity amongst his Angels and
Saints; the lowest place in Heaven being an happiness above all the Kingdoms of
the Earth. I give God most humble thanks, that I am absolutely quiet within my
self from being guilty even so much as in a thought, of that Treason I am
accused of, and never had a thought of any thing against the Person or
Government of his Majesty. And what I did toward the introducing of the
Catholic Religion, was no way but that which I thought to be for the good of
the Kingdom by Act of Parliament. I do ask of the Eternal and Merciful God,
most humbe Pardon for all my great Sins, hoping in the mercy of Christ Jesus,
through his most sacred Passion, to obtain remission of my Sins, and Life
everlasting in Heaven. God protect and keep you, and ours, in his holy grace.
My dear I beseech you, by the love you always bore me, afflict your self as
little as you can, for the unexpected, yet I doubt not, but blessed end of

Yours, etc.


To my dear and entirely loving and beloved Wife.
My most dear and loving Wife,
IT has pleased God of his infinite mercy, The second Letter to his Lady.
to bring me into the condition I am in; I take it for a mercy much greater
then I could deserve or expect. I am heartily sorry, That I have not been so
sensible of the blessing God was pleased to bestow on me, by giving you unto
me, as I should have been; for I do from my heart acknowledge, that you have
been a most kind loving Wife, as any man could have; and I was not worthy of
you: I pray forgive me of any and all things that I have ever done to displease
you. I have not now many hours to live, God send me to make a good end; I
humbly thank him, I have a great confidence in his mercy; And I do hope through
the merits and Passion of Jesus Christ our Savior, to obtain everlasting
happiness. I beseech God to reward you, and bless you, and send you all
happiness. I beseech you by the love you have always born me, to bear this my
end as well as possibly you can: And put my Innocence into the balance of my
Death. I pray God to bless all our Children, who I hope will be obedient to
you. I must not forget the Pains and Care, that my Daughter Winchester has
taken, in an extraordinary kind, and discreet way; I must likewise own, how
groundless that report was, that has been Spread abroad, That you, and she,
by your entreaty and persuasions, have kept me from Discovering my knowledge of
the Plot so much spoken of; when God knows I know nothing to Discover, and
shall as totally Die Innocent, as any Man ever did, not having in the least
ever had a Disloyal heart to his Majesty. God Preserve you, and ours, and send
us an happy meeting in Heaven, which is the hearty Prayer of him that Forty
Years had the Honor to bear Your name, and now is returned unto the name of

St. Stephen's day, 1680. My dear Mistress, Your most affectionate loving
Husband, William Howard.


Dear Harry,
GOD of his Mercy, Another to his Son Henry now Lord Stafford.
I am confident has brought me hither to let me see how vain all worldly
things are, and how we deceive our selves, when we think of any thing, but how
with Devotion we may duly serve him; I hope by the mercy of God to obtain
everlasting Salvation; The All-knowing God sees how Innocent I am, from the
Crimes I am charged with: it is a comfort unto me, that none of my Estate will
in any way be Forfeited, but all comes unto you, as if I had Died a natural
Death. I beseech God to Bless you, and make you happy in this World, and the
World to come; and the only way to be so, is never to leave truly serving God
upon no account whatsoever. I know you will carry your self with that duty to
your Mother, and love and kindness to your Brothers, as is sit for you to do;
So again beseeching God to Protect you and Govern you in Righteousness, I am

Your most loving Father, William Howard.


Good Child,
THE Condition I am in is such, For my Son John.
as I doubt not but that God has brought me into it for the good of my Soul,
his holy name be praised for it; I willingly and cheerfully submit unto it. I
beseech God to bless you, and send you eternal Happiness, which is the Peayer of

Your Affectionate Father William Howard.


Good Daughter,
I Know you will bear what happens unto me with Patience and Resignation: For
my Daughter Vrsula.
I thank God that I know my self in every kind Innocent; and that I have
confidence in Gods Mercies, and doubt not but through the Mercy and Passion of
our Savior, to obtain everlasting happiness. I Pray God bless You. I am

Your affectionate Father, William Howard.


My good Child,
THis is the last time I shall Write unto you, I pray God bless you. Your poor
Old Father has this comfort, For my Daughter Delphina.
that he is totally Innocent of what he was accused of, and confident of Gods
Mercy; and through the Merits of our Savior, I hope for Salvation, I take
great content in my Innocence, and willingly resign my self to Gods Holy will.
I am very much trovbled to leave my Wife, who has been so extraordinary a good
and kind Wife unto me, more then I could deserve: God reward her. So with my
blessing unto you, I am

Your most loving Father, William Howard.


HE writ also upon occasion, several little Papers or Notes, whereof I have
only these two or three Copies.

1680.
IN the Name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Upon Tuesday
the 30th. of November the Feast of St. Andrew, I was brought to my Trial in
Westminster Hall before the Peers, Lord Chancellor being High Steward; my Trial
continued until that day, seaven-night the 7th. of December; upon that day I
was found Guilty of High Treason and condemned to die. I give God thanks for
his great mercy and goodness that he has been pleased to think me worthy of
this Sentence, in satisfaction for my other great and heinous offenses which I
have committed; And I hope that through the glorious passion of our Savor
Christ Jesus, and through his precious blood and merits, he will be mercifully
pleased to receive my Soul into eternal Happiness, in his presence amongst his
Angels and Saints. I conceive this Sentence is fallen upon me upon the account
of the Religion that I am of; If I had numbers of lives, I would lose them all,
rather then forsake that Church, that I am of; and which I am well assured that
it maintains nothing but what is well warranted by the word of God. I do with
my whole heart forgive those Perjured men that swore so falsely against me; I
wish them no greater punishment then to repent, and to acknowledge the wrong
they have done me; I do also heartily forgive my Judges; and if any of them
have given their Votes contrary to their Consciences, God for forgive them, I
do it willingly.

HOw extremly should I think my self bound to the King if in this Condition
that I am brought into by the Perjury of Villains that swore falsely for gain,
Another Note.
His Majesty should be graciously pleased to grant me my life; But how
infinitely beyond that has His Divine Majesty showed his mercy and goodness to
me, so many times pardoning those great, and many offenses, which the least of
them deserved an Fternal punishment. And of his infinite mercy has been
pleased to preserve me thus long from his just Judgments; And has brought me
hither first a Prisoner, when I had not done any thing in the least by the Law
to deserve it; and now has pleased to bring me to my Condemnation: How
inexplicable are his Mercies unto me; And if I do not cordially and really
repent, having this great time to recollect my self, nothing can excuse me. Nay
even at this time when I am hourly looking to hear of the hour of my Execution,
I have time by his Omnipotent mercy to lay my Heart prostrate on the ground, to
beg his Pardon, and acknowledge his infinite mercy and goodness; God grant me
grace to reflect as I ought on all these assurances, and as I ought to do, love
his Divinity and nothing created independently of him; Nothing in this World
but the Holy Trinity deserving the whole love and Adoration of Mankind. God
give me grace to love him, and only him; And though I cannot do it so well as
otherwise I ought, yet I hope I do it what I can; And do firmly resolve by his
holy Grace I will to the uttermost of my power, so long as it shall please him
to give me my life, wholly and willingly to resign my self to his Holy will;
and doubt not by his Grace but to find more true delight in serving him, then
ever I did in the vanities of the World. All Glory Praise and Honor be given
unto him for all Eterni^^. Amen.

THere was likewise found in his Chamber, this following Prayer or Resignation.
Thou have said O Lord, he that loves Father or Mother, etc. more then me is not
worthy of me. I acknowledge most dear Lord, that I love my Wife and Children,
as much as a loving Husband and tender Father can love a most deserving Wife,
and most dutiful Children: but to show that I love thy Divine Majesty more than
them, and my own Life to boot; I willingly render up, and forsake both for the
love of thee; and rather then to offend thee, though by the contrary I may have
life and all worldly advantages both for my self and them. Receive therefore
Dear Jesus, this voluntary Oblation of both. Take us into thy protection. O
Helper in opportunities, in Tribulation. Be thou a Judge and Spouse to the
Widow; a Father to the Orphans, and Salvation to all our Souls. Psalm. 9 9.
I rejoice to have so dear a Pledge to Offer and present thee, for all thy
blessings, and benefits bestowed upon Us; and for thy sake, who offeredst thy
self for us to Death, to the most ignominious Death of the Cross. Receive
therefore Sweet Jesus, this poor Oblation of mine (though all I am able to
offer thee) in union of all the Oblations of thy most Sacred Life, Death and
Passion, and of all those Divine Oblations, which have been, are, and ever
shall be offered upon thine Altars, All which I Offer thee, and by thy hands to
thy eternal Father. O Father, look upon the face of thy Christ, and turn away
thy face from my Sins, O Holy Mary Mother of God; all ye Holy Angels and Saints
in Heaven make Intercession for me, Psalm. 84. ^. Ps;al. 51. 10.
that what I deserve not of my self, may by your Intercession be bestowed upon
me. Amen, Jesu. Amen. Grant and ratisie what I ask, for thy Names sake, Amen.

On Sunday the 19th. of December Mr Lieutenant of the Tower, came to him, and
told him, He was sorry, he must bring him the ill news that he must dye on the
29th. of this Month. To which dismal Message he undauntedly replied, I must
obey; Then added in Latin that Text of the Psalm Haec dies, etc. This is the
day which our Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it; After which
turning himself to his almost dead-struck Lady, Psalm. 181. 2.
he said, Let us go to our Prayers.

UPon this occasion also he writ a little Schedule containing these words; In
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Another Note.
This day Mr. Lieutenant came and told me, I must dye. God's Holy name be
praised; and I prostrate beseech him, to have mercy on my sinful Soul; And deal
with me, as his Omnipotence knows I am Innocent, of what was falsely sworn
against me; I do not doubt of Salvation through the Passion of our most blessed
Savior.

IT was truly a matter of wonder and astonishment to those who lived and were
conversant with him during this short remnant of his life, to see with what
Constancy and equal temper of mind he comported himself. What interior Quiet,
and serenity he seem,d to enjoy: What confidence he expressed in God; What
Charity to all, even to the worst of his Enemies. Death has usually an aspect
formidable to nature, especially when Treason and Murder sly in the face of a
guilty Conscience. A man who has warning and leisure deliberately to consider,
he is now upon the point of being just dragged out of this mortal State, before
the dreadful Tribunal of a severe Judge, who knows the Secrets of his Heart;
there to receive an Eternal Doom of Hell and Damnation for crimes detested by
God and Nature. This man surely can never die, without such Conflicts of
horror and despair as will almost prevent the hand of the Executioner; yet
there appeared in my Lord no other symptoms, then those of a most pleasing
Tranquillity, as if Innocence had Guarded him; As if the Injustice of others had
secured him; As if the Holy Ghost had fortified him. As if Christ Jesus had
united him to his Sufferings, and undertaken his conduct and defense.

THat very morning he was to dye, he writ a Letter to his Lady which afterward
he delivered on the Scaffold to a Friend there present, the contents whereof
are these.

My Dear Wife,
I Have, I give God humble thanks, slept this night some hours very quietly I
would not dress me until I had by this given you thanks for all your great Love
and Kindness unto me, I am very sorry, that I have not deserved it from you;
God reward you; Were I to live numbers of years, I assure you I would never
omit any occasion to let you know the Love I bear you; I cannot say what I
would, nor how well and many ways you have deserved. God of His most infinite
mercy send us an happy meeting in Heaven. My last request unto you is, that you
will bear my Death as well as you can, for my sake. I have now no more to do
but as well as I can (though not so well as I would.) to recommend my sinful
Soul unto the mercy of the Holy Trinity who through the Passion, Blood and
Merits of our Savor, I hope will mercifully grant me a place, (though the
lowest,) in Heaven, God grant it; And bless you and Ours.

St. Thomas of Canterbury's day 1680, past six in the Morning. Your truly
loving Husband William Howard


The Manner and Circumstances of my Lord's Final End.
WHen the hour appointed for his Death, drew near, he exspected with some
impatience the arrival of Mr. Lieutenant, telling his Friends that were about
him, he ought not to hasten his own death, yet he thought the time long till
they came for him. A Gentleman then with him in his Chamber put him in mind,
that it was a cold day, and that his Lordship would do well to put on a Cloak
or Coat to keep him warm; He answered; He would; for (said he) I may perhaps
shake for cold, but I trust in God, never for fear. After some time spent in
Spiritual discourses, at length about Ten a Clock, word was brought him, That
Mr. Lieutenant waited for him below; upon which he sweetly saluted his Friends,
bidding them not grieve for him; for this was the happiest day of all his Life;
then he immediately went down, and walked along by the Lieutenants Chair (who
had the Gout) through a lane of Soldiers to the Bars without the Tower. There
the Lieutenant delievered him to the Sheriffs, and they from thence Guarded him
to the Scaffold erected on Tower Hill. All the way as he passed, several
thousands of People crowded to see him; many civilly saluted him; and few there
were, amongst that vast number, whose hearts were not touched and mollified
with Compassion for him. Having mounted the Scaffold there appeared in his
Countenance such an unusual vivacity, such a ( Cheerfulness, such a Confidence,
such a Candor, as if the Innocence of his Soul had shined through his Body.
Nothing of that Mortal paleness, Nothing of those Reluctances, Convulsions, and
Agonies, incident to persons in his condition, could in the least be perceived
in him. He looked Death in the face with so undaunted a Resolution, as gave
many occasion to say; Grace had left in him, no Resentments of Nature. After a
short pause, viewing the People, and finding them attentive to what he should
say, he stepped to one side of the Scaffold, and with a Graceful Air, and
intelligible Voice pronounced his last Speech as follows.

My Lord's last Speech.
BY the permission of Almighty God, I am this day brought hither to Suffer
Death, as if I were Guilty of High Treason. I do most truly in the presence of
the Eternal, Omnipotent, and All-knowing God, protest upon my Salvation, that I
am as Innocent as it is possible for any Man to be, so much as in a thought, of
the Crimes laid to my Charge.

I acknowledge it to be a particular. Grace and Favor of the Holy Trinity, to
have given me this Long time to prepare my self for Eternity, I have not made
so good use of that Grace as I ought to have done; partly by my not having so
well recollected my self, as I might have done; and partly because not only my
Friends, but my Wife and Children, have for several days been forbidden to see
me, but in the presence of one of my Warders. This has been a great trouble
and distraction unto me, but I hope God of his Infinite Mercy will Pardon my
Defects, and accept of my good Intentions.

Since my long Imprisonment I have considered often what could the Original
Cause of my being thus Accused, since I knew my self not Culpable, so much as
in a thought; and I cannot believe it to be upon any other account then my
being of the Church of Rome. I have no reason to be ashamed of my Religion, for
it Teaches nothing but the Right Worship of God, Obedience to the King, and
due Subordination to the Temporal Laws of the Kingdom. And I do submit to all
Articles of Faith believed and taught in the Catholic Church, believing them
to be most consonant to the Word of God. And whereas it has so much and often
been objected, That the Church holds that Sovereign Princes, Excommunicated by
the Pope, way by their Subjects be Deposed or Murdered: As to the Murder of
Princes, I have been taught as a Matter of Faith in the Catholic Church, That
such Doctrine is Diabolical, Horrid, Detestable, and contrary to the Law of
God, Nature, and Nations: And as such from my heart I Renounce and abominate
it. As for the Doctrine of Deposing Princes, I know some Divines of the
Catholic Church hold it, but as able and Learned as they have Written against
it: But it was not pretended to be the Doctrine of the Church, that is, any
Point of Catholic Faith: Wherefore I do here in my Conscience declare, that it
is my true and real Judgment, That the same Doctrine of Deposing Kings, is
contrary to the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, Injurious to Sovereign Power,
and consequently would be in me or any other of His Majesty's Subjects, Impious
and Damnable. I believe and profess, That there is One God, One Savior, One
Holy Catholic Church, of which through the Mercy, Grace, and Goodness of God,
I die a member.

To my great and unspeakable grief, I have offended God in many things, by many
great Offenses, but I give him most humble thanks, not in any of those Crimes
of which I was Accused.

All the Members of either House having liberty to propose in the House what
they think fit for the good of the Kingdom, accordingly I proposed what I
thought fit, the House is Judge of the fitness or unfitness of it; and I think
I never said any thing that was unsitting there, or contrary to the Law and Use
of Parliament: for certainly if I had, the Lords would, (as they might,) have
punished me: so I am not culpable before God or Man.

It is much reported of Indulgences, Dispensations, and Pardons, to Murder,
Rebel, Lie, Forswear, and Commit such other Crimes held and given in the
Church; I do here profess in the presence of God, I never Learned, Believed, or
Practiced any such thing, but the contrary; And I speak this without any
Equivocation, or Reservation whatsoever: And certainly were I guilty, either my
self, or knew of any one that were Guilty, whosoever, that were so, of any of
those Crimes of which I am accused, I were not only the greatest Fool
imaginable, but a perfect Madman, and as wicked as any of those, that so
falsely have accused me; If I should not discover any ill Design I knew in any
kind, and so upon Discovery save my Life; I have so often had so fair occasions
proposed unto me; And so am guilty of Self-murder, which is a most grievous
and heinous Sin; and though I was last Impeached at the Lords Bar, yet I have
great grounds to believe, that I was first brought to Trial, on the belief,
that to save my Life, I would make some great Discovery; And truly so I would,
had I known any such thing of any ill Design or Illegal Dangerous Plot, either
of my self or any other Person whatsoever, without any Exception. But had I a
thousand Lives, I would lose them all, rather then Falsely accuse, either my
self or any other whatsoever. And if I had known of any Treason, and should
thus deny it, as I do now upon my Salvation, at this time, I should have no
hope of Salvation, which now I have through the Merits of Christ Jesus.

I do beseech God to bless His Majestly, who is my Lawful King and Sovereign,
whom I was always by all Laws Humane and Divine, bound to Obey, and I am sure
that no Power upon Earth, either singly or all together, can legally allow me,
or any body else, to lift up a Hand against him, or his Legal Authority. I do
hold that the Constitution of the Government of this Kingdom, is the only way
to continue peace and quietness; which God long continue.

Next to Treason, I hold Murder in Abhorrence, and have ever done, and do; And
I do sincerely profess, that if I could at this time free my self Immediately,
and Establish what Religion I would, and what Government I would, and make my
self as great as I could wish, and all by the death of one of these Fellows,
that by their Perjuries have brought me to the place where I am, I so much
abhor to be the cause of any Man's death, that I would not any way be the cause
of their Murder; how much less would I endeavor the Assassination of his
Majesty, whom I hold to be a Gracious a King as ever this or any other Nation
had; And under whom the People may enjoy their Liberties, as much as ever any
did; And if it please God to grant him Life and Happiness, according as I have
always Wished and Prayed for, I am morally persuaded, that he, and all his
Dominions, will be as happy and prosperous as ever People were; Which I beseech
God grant.

I do most humbly ask Pardon of the Almighty and All-merciful God, for all the
great Offenses I have committed against his Divine Majesty, and I know he would
not have the Death and Confusion of a Sinner, but that he may Repent and Live:
In that assurance I hope, knowing he never despises a Contrite Heart; And
though I have not so feeling a Contrition as I would, yet I have it as well as
I can; and I doubt not but that God will accept of the Good Will.

I do desire that all People will forgive me any Injury that I have done them
in any thing, either Wilfully or by Chance, and I do heartily forgive all
People in this World that have Injured me; I forgive even those Perjured Men,
that so Falsely have brought me hither by their Perjuries.

I do now upon my Death and Salvation aver, That I never spoke one Word either
to Oats or Turbervil, or to my knowledge ever saw them, until my Trial: And
for Dugdale I never spoke unto him of any thing but about a Footboy, or
Footman, or Foot-race; and never was then alone with him: All the Punishment
that I wish them, is, that they may repent and acknowledge the Wrong that they
have done me; then it will appear how Innocent I am: God forgive them! I have a
great Confidence that it will please Almighty God, and that he will in a short
time bring Truth to Light; then You and all the World will see and know what
injury they have done me.

I hope that I have made it appear, that I have some Conscience; for if I had
none, certainly I would have saved my Life by acknowledging my self Guilty;
which I could have done, though I know I am not in the least Guilty. And I
having some Conscience, make very ill use of it; for I throw my self into
Eternal Pain, by thus plainly and constantly denying thus at my Death, the
knowledge of what I am accused of in the least.

I have said thus much in discharge of my Conscience, and do aver upon my
Salvation, what I have said to be really true.

I shall say little of my Trial; and whether it were all according to the known
Law, I am too much a Party to say much of it; if it were not so, God forgive
him or them that were the cause of it.

My Judges were all Persons of Honor, who were all as much bound to Judge
rightly, as if they had been upon Oath upon what was legally proved; And not to
Vote but according as in their Consciences they were satisfied; And if any of
them did otherwise, upon any account whatsoever, I beseech God forgive them; I
do heartily.

I shall end with my hearty Prayers for the happiness of his Majesty, that he
may enjoy all happiness in this World, and the World to come; and govern his
People according to the Laws of God, and that the People may be sensible what a
Blessing God has so miraculously given them, and obey him as they ought. I ask
Pardon with a prostrate Heart of Almighty God, for all the great Offenses that
I have committed against his Divine Majesty, and hope through the Merits and
Passion of Christ Jesus, to obtain everlasting Happiness, into whose hands I
commit my Spirit, asking Pardon of every Person that I have done any wrong
unto: I do freely forgive all that have any ways wronged me; I do with all the
Devotion and Repentance that I can, humbly invoke the mercy of our Blessed
Savior.

I beseech God not to Revenge my Innocent Blood upon the Nation, or on those
that were the Cause of it, with my last Breath. I do with my last Breath truly
assert my Innocence, and hope the Omnipotent All-seeing Just God will deal with
me accordingly.

HIS Speech being ended, he delivered several Written Copies of it to the
Sheriffs and others near him, (one of which, Writ with his own hand, he sent to
the King,) Then he returned to the middle of the Scaffold, where, encompassed
by his Catholic Friends; He kneeled down, and reverently making the Sign of
the Cross, pronounced aloud, with exceeding Devotion, this following Prayer.

AGnosco (Domine Jesu) peccata mea, multa and magna, pro quibus timeo; sed
spero in misericordia and miserationibus tuis, quarum non est numerus: Secundum
igitur magnam misericordiam tuam miserere mei, and secundum multitudinem
miserationum tuarum dele iniquitatem meam. Si Peccata mea magnasunt, major est
misericordia tua: Si multae, infinitae sunt miserationes tuae: Si ego commisi,
unde me possis condemnare, Tu non amisisti, unde potes, and soles salvare.
Credenti in potentia tua and dicenti, Domine si vis, potes me mundare, tu
statim respondisti: Volo; mundare: Credo, quod ipse credidit; Spero quod ipse
speravit; Imploro quod ipse imploravit. Dic igitur animae meae, Salus tua ego
sum: Sana me, Domine Jesu, and sanabor: Salvum me fac, and salvus ero, and
misericordias tuas in aeternum cantabo. Ne projicias me igitur a facie tua, and
Spiritum sanctum tuum ne auferas a me: Sed read mihi laetitiam Salutaris tui,
and Spiritu principali consirma me. Tu dixisti, dulcissime Jesu, Convertimini
ad me, and ego convertar ad vos: Ego me, ex toto cord meo, ex tota anima, ex
tota mente mea, converto ad te; Converte te igitur misericordissime, ad
indignum famulum tuum quem pretioso sanguine redemisti. Tu dixisti, Omnis qui
confitebitur me, coram hominibus consitebor, and ego eum coram Patre meo, qui
in coelis est. Ego te, and Sanctam tuam Religionem Catholicam vivens confiteor,
and moriens, adjuvante gratia tua, confitebor: dignare me igitur suscipere, and
ponfiteri coram patre tuo, qui in Coelis est. In tha promissione, non in mea
justitia confido. Vitam quam dedisti mihi, libenter tibi reddo secundum
beneplacitum tuum: In manus tuas commendo Spiritum meum, qui moriens Spiritum
tuum in aeterni Patris manus commendasti. In pace igitur, in id ipsum dormiam
and requiescam, quoniam tu Domine, singulariter in spe constituisti me. Amen,
Jesu, Amen.

Englished thus.

I acknowledge (O Lord Jesus) my Sins to be many, and great, for which I am
afraid; but I hope in thy mercy, and commiserations which are without number.
Have mercy therefore on me according to thy great mercy, and according to the
multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out mine iniquity. If my Sins be great,
thy mercy is greater; If many, thy Commiserations are infinite. If I have
committed that, for which thou may Condemn me, thou have not lost that, by
which thou can, and art accustomed to Save. To him, that believed in thy
Power, and said, O Lord, If thou will, thou caust make me clean; Thou presently
answeredst, I will; Be thou clean: I believe, what he believed, I hope, for
what he hoped, I Implored what he Implored. Say therefore to my Soul, I am thy
Salvation: Heal Me, O Lord Jesus, and I shall be healed; Save Me, and I shall
be saved, and I will sing forth thy mercy for all eternity. Cast me not
therefore away from thy Face, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me; But render
me the joy of thy Salvation, and with thy Principal Spirit Confirm me. Thou
have said, O most Sweet Jesus, Turn to Me, and I will turn to You: I turn my
self to Thee with my whole Heart, with my whole Soul, with my whole Mind; Turn
thy self therefore (O most Merciful) unto me, thy unworthy Servant, whom thou
have redeemed with thy most Precious Blood. Thou have said, Every one who shall
confess me before Men, Mat. 10 3^
I will confess him before my Father which is in Heaven. I, Living Confess
thee, and thy Holy Catholic Religion, and through the assistance of thy Holy
Grace will confess thee Dying: Vouchsafe therefore to Receive and Confess me
before thy Father which is in Heaven. I confide in thy Promise, not in my own
Justice; The Life, thou have given me, I willingly render thee according to thy
good pleasure. Luke 23.
Into thy Hands I commend my Spirit, who Dying did commend thy Spirit into
the Hands of thy Eternal Father. In peace therefore, in that one thing, Psalm. 4.
will I Sleep and Rest; because thou, O Lord, have singularly Established me in
hope. Amen, JESUS, Amen.

TO this Prayer he adjoined several other Pious Ejaculations, wherein with
singular Compunction, and abundance of Tears; he Implored the Divine Mercy and
Pardon for his Sins past; He recommended his Soul to his dear Redeemer Jesus;
He blessed his Holy Name; And offered his Life to him, a willing Sacrifice of
Gratitude, Piety, and Love.

Remaining still on his knees, he again protested his Innocence with all the
asseverations a dying Christian is capable to make. Then rising up, he a second
time saluted the people and walking to each side of the Scaffold, Told them,
they had as good and gracious a King as ever Reigned. He earnestly exhorted
them to be faithful and constant in their Allegiance to him. And that no
pretense whatsoever should withdraw them from their Duty. He wished with a
feeling resentment that none might be less Loyal to His Majesty then he had
been. And it was very remarkable in him; He never seemed transported with any
fervours, or Ecstasies, but either in his Prayers to God, or in his expressions
of Loyalty to the King; Then indeed he was all Flame, and you might read in his
very Eyes, the tender Emotions, and Zeal of his heart. He likewise assured them
upon his Salvation, he knew no design the Duke of York ever had against the
King, But that he had behaved himself for ought he knew, as a loving Loyal
Brother ought to do; Then he again declared his own Innocence, and desired the
Prayers of all good Christians for him; He Prayed to God heartily to bless the
King, and preserve him from his Enemies; To bless the Nation; To bless, and be
with them all there present, especially the King's Loyal Subjects; He begged
Gods Mercy and Pardon for his Sins; He asked forgiveness of all, and forgave
all; beseeching the Divine goodness not to Revenge his Innocent Blood upon the
whole Kingdom; No, not upon those by whose Perjuries he was brought thither* to
whom he wished from his Heart no other hurt, then that they should repent, and
tell truth.

Whilst he thus professed his Loyaity, his Innocence, his Piety; Most that
heard him were touched with a sensible Compassion for him: Some, as he Spoke,
put off their Hats, and Bowed to him, in sign they Accorded to what he said;
Others by distinct Acclamations answered, We believe you my Lord; God bless you
my Lord: Pray God forgive him his Sins, etc.

In this conjuncture a Protestant Minister accosted him, saying, Have you
received no Indulgences from the Romish Church? Have you received no
Absolution? To which my Lord answered, What have you to do with my Religion?
However I do say, the Roman Catholic Church allow's of no Indulgences or
Dispensations, Authorizing Treason, Murder, Lying, or Forswearing; Nor have I
received any Absolution for such ends. Pray do not trouble your self, nor me.

Then turning from the Parson, he applied himself to his Friends about him,
whom he lovingly embraced, and with a pleasant Voice and Aspect, bid them
Adieu, for this World. Next he delivered his Watch, two Rings off his Fingers,
his Staff, and his Crucifix about his Neck, as Legacies to several Friends: He
desired the Sheriffs that such Persons as he nominated might have leave
(without the Executioners Intermeddling) to assist him, and take care of his
Body, which was accordingly done: And his Gentleman stripping him of his Coat
and Peruke, put on his head a Silk Cap, and accommodated his hair, Shirt, and
Waistcoat, for the Execution. And now being ready for Death both in Body and
Mind, he cheerfully submitted himself to the Block; before which first kneeling
down, and making the Sign of the Cross, he recommended himself with raptures of
Devotion to the Divine Mercy and Goodness; After this, he lay down as it were
to try the Block. And then (who could imagine it?) with a Stupendous Courage,
embraced the fatal Wood, as the dear Basis, or Point, from whence his Soul was
now to take its flight to Immortal Glory. The Heads-man put him in mind, that
his Shirt and Waistcoat came too high; Whereupon he raised himself up upon his
Knees, and bid his Gentleman put them lower. Whilst this was Performing, he was
heard continually to breath forth several Acts of Prayer, as Sweet Jesus
receive my Soul; Into thy hands O Lord I commend my Spirit, etc. When his
Gentleman had finished; He again laid down his head upon the Block, persevering
still in Prayer, and expecting the sudden and dismal arrest of Death, with a
courage (say the Papists) Divinely Elevated, a constancy more then humane. No
change in his Countenance; no Quaking, or Trembling in any one Joint of his
Body, could be discerned. Thus he lay, or rather quietly rested, upon the very
Brink, between Time and Eternity, a good space; Till at length finding the
Head's-Man delayed the Execution of his Office; He once more raised himself up
upon his Knees, and with an aspect, grave, (but still serene and Lively,)
asked, Why they staid? It was answered, For a Sign; What Sign will you give
Sir? He replied, None at all; Take your own time; God's will be done; I am
ready. The Head's-Man said, I hope you forgive me; He answered, I do. Then
Blessing himself again with the Sign of the Cross, he reposed his Head upon the
Block, never more to lift it up, in this Mortal State.

The Heads'-Man took the Ax in his hand, and after a short pause; Elevated it
on high, as it were to take Aim, and set it down again. A second time he did
so, and Sighed. The third time he gave the Fatal Blow, which severed my Lord's
Head from his Body, save only a small part of the Skin and Windpipe, which was
immediately cut off with a Knife.

The Body after Separation from the Head, Trembled a little, and Stirred no
more. The Head was received into a Black Silk Scarf, by two of my Lord's
Friends, and retained by them, till the Sheriff called for it, and commanded
the Executioner to hold it up to the view of the Multitude; The which he did,
at the four Corners of the Scaffold; Crying aloud, This is the Head of a
Traitor. But however the People had been formerly possessed with prejudice both
against my Lord's Practices and Principles; Yet now, they made no Acclamations
at the sight of the Bloud-dropping Head, nor seemed much taken with the Jollity
of the Spectacle; Some went away with Confusion and Remorse, for their past
hard censure of him; Others conceived strange apprehensions and fears of God's
Judgments ensuing Perjury, and Bloodshed. Some again said, My Lord was Drunk
with Brandy; Others said, Verily This was a just Man. Luke 23. 48.
The Papists who best knew his Innocence; And who looked upon themselves as in
some measure Parties in his Sufferings; beheld this whole Tragedy with most
tender Resentments. They regarded him as a Victime of Religion and Innocence.
They mutually accompanied him with their Prayers, and Supplications to God in
his behalf. They seemed to receive new Comfort and Courage from his Christian
Magnanimity. They Wept; They Smiled; They Sympathized with him, both in his
Dolours and Joys. They Blessed, and Praised Almighty God for his goodness to
Him, and to Them, in Him. They Glorified his Holy Name, who often shows the
strength of his Power, in the weakest Subjects. In fine, many did, (and still
do) believe, the peculiar grace, and presence of God's Spirit, had some Effect,
and Influence upon all in a manner that saw him; And few there were of his
Religion, who did not wish themselves in his Place.

No sooner was Execution done, but the Sun, (which before was obscured, and
secluded from our sight,) on a sudden dissipating the Clouds, sent forth it is
Clear and Illustrious Beams; Upon which accident, different Parties have since
made different Reflections; My Lord's Adversaries say, The Sun before srowned
at Popish Guilt, but seemed pleased when Justice was done. The Papists say, The
Heavens mourned and were ashamed, and unwilling to be Spectators at the
Shedding of Innocent Blood; but appeared in Joy, and Splendor, at the
Reception of a New and Glorious Inhabitant into their Celestial Mansions.

When the Head had been publicly exposed, it was returned back into the Silk
Scarf, held by a Youth that had waited upon my Lord, and so laid into the
Coffin together with the Body, vested. (For out of Modesty my Lord desired he
might not be stripped naked on the Scaffold.) In the Interim, diverse Persons
threw up their Handkerchiess, to have them dipped in my Lord's Blood, wherein
some were Gratified, and others had their Handkerchiefs thrown with Derision
over the Scaffold.

After this the Coffin was taken down from off the Scaffold by several Bearers,
and by them carried to the bounds of the Tower, where a Velvet Hearse Cloth
being spread over it, It was carried in order to it is Interment into the Tower;
A place (say the Papists) as it has been Enobled by his Sufferings, so will it
remain to future Ages, a Triumphal Monument of his Fortitude, and Victory.

Thus Lived, thus Dyed this Famous Nobleman, to whose memory I shall only add,
of my own; That if his Cause was Innocent, and his Religion wrongfully
Traduced, He is Happy, and we unfortunate by his untimely Death.

1 Ep. Cor. Cap. 15. Verse 54. Absorpta est Mors in Victoria.

AN APPENDIX, Containing some Remarques upon the late Trial of Stephen
College, In Relation to the Chief Witnesses against my Lord STAFFORD.
Here annexed for the more Ample Satisfaction of the Reader in that Particular.
HAving in some measure performed what I purposed, and promised in the front of
this Treatise; I might well have here put a stop to my Pen, had not an
extraordinary Accident, raised new matter of Reflections upon the King's
Evidence in point of Credit, and seemed to call me to a short Survey of it, in
the close of my Discourse.

The Judgments of the Almighty are incomprehensible; And St. Paul had good
reason to Cry out, Romans 11. 33.
as it were in an Ecstasy, O The depth of the riches both of the Wisdom and
Knowledge of God; How unsearchable are his Judgments, and his ways past finding
out; Who could ever have imagined, That the three direct and main Witnesses
against my Lord Stafford at his Trial, should all convene together at another,
of a quite contrary stamp; And this in so fatal a conjuncture, as to confound,
and destroy by open Perjury each others Testimony? My Lord (as you have seen)
endeavored to show the Infamy of the Witnesses: The Contradictions in their
Evidence: The Incoherence of parts: And Incredibility of circumstances,
throughout the whole Charge. To make out which he alleged many pressing
Arguments, and produced many Substantial Witnesses, both Catholics and
Protestants, in his behalf: Nothing seemed wanting, save only his Adversaries
themselves, against themselves, to complete his Evidence. And here it is the
Divine Goodness (say the Papists) who is the Defender of Innocence, and
Fountain of Truth, has wonderfully manifested what manner of Men, my Lord's
Accusers were, and what Credit ought to be given them; Even by the proper
Testimony of their own Mouths; Herein also fulfilling in some sort, what my
Lord himself (Prophetically) foretold in his last Speech, (viz.) I have a great
confidence that it will please Almighty God; And that he will in a short time
bring Truth to Light. Then all the World will see and know, what Injury they
(Oats, Dugdale, and Turbervil,) have done me.

To give a brief account of this affair, There are few who have not heard of
the late Trial of Stephen College, Surnamed the Protestant Joyner (a man very
active in the Death of my Lord Stafford, and a zealous defender of Dugdales
Honesty.) He was Impeached, Arraigned, Condemned, and Executed for High
Treason; In Speaking Treasonable Words; And having by a designed combination
with others, appeared in Arms to Seize the Kings Person at Oxford. The
Witnesses against him were, Smith, Dugdale, Turbervil, Haines, Mr. Masters,
and Sir William Jennings.

It is not my intent here, to Epitomize Colleges whole Trial; Nor to give my
Censure or Verdict upon it; But only to inform the Reader of some Passages
which chiefly relate to the main Witnesses against my Lord Stafford; And which
are now become the Subject of Surprise, and Astonishment to all Considering
Persons.

Please then to Note, That Stephen Dugdale, and Edward Turbervil, (two of the
Principal Witnesses upon whose Testimony my Lord was Found Guilty,) and John
Smith, otherwise called Narrative Smith, (who at my Lords Trial seemed the only
plausible Deponent, as to the Plot in General) gave respective Evidence against
this College at Oxford, as follows.

Stephen Dugdale Swore First. Page 18. etc.
Mr. College told him; That the King was a Papist, That he was as deep in the
Plot as any Papist of them all (which the Papists themselves also confess.)
That he had an hand in Sir Edmundbury Godferys death; That he was a Rogue; That
nothing was to be expected from him but Popery, and Arbitrary Government. And
that the Clergy of England were Papists in Masquerade, Secondly, That College
had framed several notorious Libels against the King to render him
contemptible. And raised Arms with intent to seize His Sacred Person at Oxford,
etc.

Turbervil Swore, Page 29. etc.
He heard College say; First. That there was no good to be expected from the
King. For that he and his Family were Papists, and had ever been such.
Secondly, That His Party would Seize the King, and secure Him, till he came to
those terms they would have of him. Thirdly, That the Parliament which cut off
the late King's Head, did nothing but what they had just cause for, etc.

Smith Swore; First. That College told him, Page 27.
There were Moneys collected to buy Arms and Amuniton to bring the King to
Submission to His People; Adding thereunto, That he wondered Old Rowley
(meaning the King) did not consider how easily His Fathers Head came to the
Block, which he doubted not would be the end of Rowley at last. Secondly, That
College had provided himself of a great Sword, Pistols, Blunderbuss, with
Back, Breast, and Head-Peice. And that he heard him say, The City was provided,
and ready with Powder and Bullets: That he would be one who should Seize the
King in case he secured any of the Members of Parliament. And that if any man,
nay even Rowley himself should attempt to seize upon his Arms, He would be the
death of him, etc.

In direct Opposition to these witnesses, College produced Titus Oats (the
third principal Witness against my Lord Stafford. And first Grand discoverer of
the Popish Plot) who gave attestation against the said several Witnesses, after
this manner.

AGainst Dugdale. Page 49. etc.
Oats deposed; That the said Oats discoursing upon occasion with Dugdale
concerning his being an intended Evidence against my Lord Shaftsbury and other.
Dugdale replied, There is no body has any cause to make any such report of me;
For I call God to Witness I know nothing against any Protestant in England. But
afterward Dugdale having Sworn matters of High Treason against College,
before the Grand Jury at the Old Bailey; and being hereupon charged by Oats, as
having gone against his Conscience and contrary to what he had declared to him.
Dugdale answered. It was all long of Colonel Warcup, for (said he) I could get
no money else; And he promised I should have a place in the Custom House.

In opposition to this Testimony, Page 50.
Dugdale Swore; Upon the Oath he had taken, and As he hoped for Salvation, It
was not true

Against the same Dugdale, Oats farther deposed. That Dugdale did confess he
had an old Clap; yet gave out he was Poisoned; viz. By the Papists.
which sham passed throughout the Kingdom in our Intelligences; But in Truth
(said Oats) it was the Pox: As I will make appear by the Dr. Lower.
Physician that cured him.

In opposition to which Dugdale protested, If any Doctor would come forth, page
50.
and say he cured him of a Clap, or any such thing; He would stand Guilty of
all that is imputed to him.

AGainst Turbervil also Oats gave Evidence in these words. Page 48.
A little before the Witnesses were Sworn against College at the Old Bailey, I
( Oats) met with Mr. Turbervil. I was in a Coach; But seeing Mr. Turbervil; I
stepped out of the Coach, and spoke with him; For hearing that he was a Witness,
I did ask him, whether he was a Witness or no against College? Mr. Turbervil
said, He would break any ones head, that should say so against him; for he
neither was a Witness; nor could give any Evidence against him. So after he
came from Oxon, I met with Mr. Turbervil again; And hearing he had been there;
I asked him, if he had Sworn any thing against College? He said, yes; He had
been sworn before the Grand Jury. Said I; Did not you tell me so and so? Why
(said he) The Protestant Citizens have deserted us; And God Damm him, He would
not starve. These very words he several times repeated; But when I asked him,
what he had sworn? he said; I am not bound to satisfy Peoples Curiosities.
Upon the word of a Priest (said Oats) what I say is true; As I am a Minister,
I speak it sincerely; In the presence of God; This Gentleman did say these
words to me; which made me afraid of the Man; And I went my ways, and never
spoke with him afterward, nor durst I; For I thought, He that would Swear and
curse, after that rate, was not fit to be talked with.

In opposition to all which, Turbervil swore, That he met Dr. Oats just at his
Lodgings; And the Dr. alighted out of his Coach, and spoke to him, and invited
him to come to his old Friends. For he told him; They had some Jealousy that
he was not true to them; And he farther told him; If he would come to the
King's Head Clubb, he should be received with a great deal of Kindness. But
never afterward (said Turbervil) did I speak with the Doctor a Tittle about
any Evidence; Upon my Oath (added he) I did not; And truly I always looked upon
Dr. Oats as a very Ill Man, and never would converse much with him.

AGainst Smith, Oats gave this attestation; Page 49.
( viz.) To my knowledge Mr. College and Mr. Smith had some provoking words
passed betwixt them at Richards Coffee-house. And Mr. Smith comes out, and
Swears, God Damm him he would have Colleges Blood; So when I met him, said I,
Mr. Smith, you profess your self to be a Priest, and have stood at the Altar:
And now you intend to take upon you, the Ministry of the Church of England;
And these words do not become a Minister of the Gospel, His reply was; God Damn
the Gospel. This is truth (said Oats) I speak it in the presence of God and
Man.

The whole substance of this attestation, Smith absolutely forswore, saying;
Not one word of this is true, upon my Oath. Then addressing himself to Oats.
It Is a wonderful thing (said he) you should say this of me, But I will
sufficiently prove it against you; That you have confounded the Gospel, And
denied the Divinity too.

THis is the Sum of the Evidence given as well by Dr. Oats against Dugdale,
Turbervil and Smith; as by Dugdale, Turbervil and Smith against Dr: Oats. From
which fatal manner of self-condemning and Perjuring each other; The Papists
(with two good consequence) draw these deductions.

Either Oats attesting these things against the aforenamed Witnesses, In the
word of a Priest; As he was a Minister of the Gospel, Sincerly; In the presence
of God and Man, etc. Did give true Evidence, or not; If he did; Then are
Dugdale; Turbervil, and Smith, both in their Testimony against College, and in
their several Oaths here against Oats, doubly forsworn. But if Oats did not
give here true Evidence (as the other three positively Swear he did not) then
is he guilty of manifest Perjury. So that from the reciprocal Testimony of each
other, in this matter; It is an undeniable demonstration; Either Oats (the
Pillar of the Plot,) or Dugdale, Turbervil, and Smith, (the joint Supporters of
it,) or Both, and All, are Perjured Men, and can justly Challenge no right of
belief, Page 50.
or credit to any thing, they ever did, or shall swear. Hence the Attorney
General in this very Trial ingeniously complained: It is an unhappy thing That
Dr. Oats should come in against these Men that supported his Evidence before.
And Mr. Sergeant Jefferies rightly inculcated to the Jury; Page 94. and 97.
If Dugdale Smith and Turbervil, be not to be believed, you Perjure (said he)
three Men, And (in them) trip up the Heels of all the Evidence and Discovery of
the Plot. In like manner: The Papists argue: If Oats also, be not to be
believed; the whole Fabric of the Plot Falls. What? Dr. Oats? the Quondam
Top-Evidence, The prime Discoverer; The Savior of the King, and Nation from
Popish Massacre; He swear false? He not to be believed? What Account shall be
given to God, and the World, for the Bloodshed, and the Severities used, upon
his Sole, or chief Evidence? Yet it is impossible, if Dugdale, Smith, and
Turbervil, Swear not false, Oats should Swear true; Or if he Swear not false;
They should Swear true; And as it is impossible, both should Swear true; So is
it next to impossible, (if either Swear false) the Plot should be true.
However, most assuredly one part of the Witnesses against my Lord Stafford
(without which the other could never have found credit,) are here, by their
very Compartners, proved Perjured Men.

IT is objected. They might all of them peradventure have sworn true before;
Though some of them for certain Swear false now.

The Papists answer: So might they all of them for certain have sworn false
before, though some of them peradventure swear true now. We are not to Judge of
Men's past, or future proceedings in order to Justice, by what they possibly
might be, but by what they probably were, or, will be; And to make a rational
Judgment herein, we have no other Rule to guide us in the knowledge of covert
intentions, then the Test of Overt actions. Seeing therefore these Witnesses are
proved actually Perjured; We have no rational ground to believe, but that upon
the same motives, and in the same concurence of Circumstances, they both did,
and will commit the same Crimes.

Men of lost Consciences, and desperate Fortunes, allured by gain, and
encouraged by Indempnities, regard not what, Page 45.
when, nor how they Swear. And my Lord Stafford had just Cause to say, If it be
permitted these Men daily to frame new accusations: If easy Credit be given to
all their Fables: And whatever they shall from time to time Invent, may pass
for good Evidence: Who can be secure? At this rate they may by degrees, Impeach
the whole Nation, (both Catholics and Protestants,) for Crimes which neither
they nor any Man else, ever yet dreamed on.

It is also objected by Colledge's Party; That Dugdale, Smith, and Turbervil,
are Papists in Masquerade; and now made use on to Sham off the Popish Plot, by
turning it upon the Presbyterians; Wherefore though credit may be given them
when they Swear against Papists, yet the same credit ought to be denied, when
they bear Testimony against his Majesty's true Protestant Subjects.

The Papists answer: First, Granted, that Dugdale, Smith, and Turbervil be real
Papists; how is it proved they were employed to Sham off the Plot? Why may not
Papists, be good Witnesses against the Presbyterians, in point of Treason,
without Suspicion of a Sham? Is Treason a thing so strange, and unheard of
amongst the Presbyterians? Or why should credit be given to the Witnesses when
they Swear against the Papists, (who are only charged with a Design to Kill the
King,) And Credit be denied to the same Witnesses, when they Swear against
those who actually Killed the King? Secondly, What the least Argument, or
Appearence, is there, that Dugdale, Smith, and Turbervil are Papists, or
Popishly affected? They profess the Protestant Religion; They frequent the
Protestant Church, They receive the Protestant Communion, They take all Oaths,
and Tests can be required of them, (as was acknowledged in this very Trial.)
They practice neither Fasting, Penance, nor other works of Supererrogation,
(the Symptoms of Popery.) Page 88.
They pursue their former Design of Swearing against the Papists, with as much
obstinacy, and violence as ever; (as was likewise proved in this Trial.) And is
it possible the Papists should employ, in their Shams and Intrigues, (if they
had any) the very Persons who at the same time make it their Trade and
Livelihood, to cut their Throats? Page 90.
Indeed if any of the Witnesses against my Lord Stafford be Popishly affected,
It is Dr. Oats, Whose present Disparagement of his fellow Evidence, look's
(said Mr. Solicitor General,) as if he were again returning to St. Omers.

Lastly, It is argued; The Jury, bringing in College Guilty of High Treason,
by that very Verdict, cleared Dugdale, Smith, and Turbervil of the Perjury,
charged upon them by Dr. Oats.

It is answered: First, The Jury brought in their Verdict against College, not
upon the sole Testimony of Dugdale, Smith, and Turbervil; but more especially,
upon the Evidence given by Sir William Jennings, and Mr. Masters, Persons of
known worth and honesty; As also upon pregnant proof made, (and acknowledged in
a manner by College himself;) That he by Combination with others, appeared in
open Arms, at an appointed time, and place, ready for, and Designing, public
Acts of Hostility, in the very presence of the King, yet without his Knowledge
or Authority; which by the Law is adjudged Treason. 2ly. The Papists do not
undertake to make good Oates's Charge of Perjury against Dugdale, Smith, and
Turbervil; Nor theirs, against him: But only to show, that the guilt of this
Horrid Crime lies amongst them; And consequently, whether it be charged upon
Oats, as the Chief Swearing-Master, and Original Author of the Plot; Or upon
Dugdale, Smith, and Turbervil, at his Pedants and Accessaries in the Imposture;
Or (as is most rational) upon Both, and All of them; It fallows, That the Lord
Stafford dyed by Perjury; And Roman Catholics have wrongfully suffered by
their Villainies, the loss of their Fortunes; their Estates, their Liberties,
their Lives.

Luke 19. Verse 22. Out of thine own Mouth will I Judge thee, Thou Wicked
Servant.

THus I have here Briefly and Impartially set down, what occur's to me on this
occasion; And now for an Appology to the whole Treatise: Seeing the Papists, as
well as all other Men, have a natural right, when Impeached, to defend their
Innocence, I hope it will not be Imputed a fault in me, to have Rehearsed some
of their Arguments, as they lay within the Limits, and Sphere of my Design. If
any Persons of Depraved Judgments, shall from hence draw sinister Reflections
upon the Justice of the Nation. I declare they abuse both the Government,
themselves, and Me, by such their unjust Paraphrase.
