Mellificium Chirurgiae. OR THE MARROW OF Many good AUTHORS.

WHEREIN Is briefly and faithfully handled The Art of Chyrurgery, in its four
parts, with all the several diseases unto them belonging. Their Definitions,
Causes, Signs, Prognostics, and Cures, both general, and particular.

AS ALSO An Appendix, wherein is methodically set down, the Cure of th^se
affects usually happening at Sea, and in Camp, with others necessary to be
known.

AND LASTLY, An Addition of several Magistrall Receipts, approved, and
heretofore kept secret.

Gathered first for private use, and now put forth for public benefit, by
JAMES COOK Lover of Physic and Chyrurgery.

Printed at London for Samuel Cartwright, at the sign of the Hand and Bible in
Duck-Lane. M DC XL VIII.

TO THE Right Honorable Francis Lord Brook, Baron Brook of Beauchamp-Court.
Right Honorable,
WAs I not fully persuaded of that Christlike spirit, residing in your bosom,
which was supereminent in your thrice honored deceased Father, and now
remaining in the Right Honorable your Lady mother, to acccept of small things,
from service reallized, presented. I durst not have presumed, to have prefixed
your noble name to so worthless a piece, much less have craved acceptance of
it. But that candor and sweetness has, as, emboldned me to pray acceptance,
so, encouraged me to beg patronage, of the poor and first labors of your
humble servant.

This, my self, and all I do enjoy, though it were ten thousand times more,
could not in the least measure, if subjected to your commands, be a sufficient
testimony of my thankfulness, for the least of those many high favors, by
which I am obliged to your noble Family.

Should I go to particularize, I might be voluminous, and that being done, yet
not be satisfactory, either in respects to worths, or my own affections, which
would ever be putting me on to do more and better.

But not to trouble your Lordship any longer; what I have, or may be wanting in
tenders of service, shall be faithfully improved at the Throne of Grace for
your eternal happiness.

Thus supplicating for pardon of boldness, and passing by of failings. As it
was my honor to be servant and Chyrurgion to your Noble Parents, so I humbly
petition to subscribe my self, Your Honors,

Most humbly devoted, in all duty, JA. COOK.

To the Reader.
IT may be accounted presumption by some, for him that is least able, and most
unworthy, to put himself to public view of those who are better proficients,
and more renowned in this noble Art. Let such know one talent is called for
improvement of, as well as ten; and as gifts are received, so they are to be
distributed, especially for public advantage. He knows this age is learned,
and acute, its matter of his rejoicing; God discovers himself so liberally,
knowing if this fall into the hands of those whose parts, though high flown, be
spiritualized, he doubts not, but they will be ready to pity failings, and
lovingly admonish, which shall be most cordially and thankfully received. If
otherwise they be improved to scorn and contemn, he mournes for that
miscarriage, and prays heartily that they may be sanctified.

The rest he has to say is this, as what is Printed, was for no private, but
public ends and advantage; so its to his poor ability, faithfully performed by
him who though he desires to be sheltered in God, and live above both the
praise and dispraise of men, yet requests leave to acknowledge himself
unworthy,

To the young Chyrurgion.
Brother,
BY way of preface, to discover the excellency of this Art, would be needless,
the utility of it I hope thou will find by putting in practice, what is
presented. Its a piece, providence put me upon some few years before our late
intestine broils, for help of memory, and to be a companion to converse
withal in spare hours, when abroad Which ends has been doubly answered by
the falling of such times, wherein such bloody work has been in the
Kingdom, which though unhappy otherwise, yet by continual practice I, and
consequently it has been advantaged. For my own part, besides the benefit by
it received, the methodizing of it, with addition of some observations and
medicaments, experienced I claim no interest in it. The Title page and Table
will discover what is therein contained, which I hope will be satisfactory the
rather, method in it being plain, breife, easy, yet full. I hope so far as
God has enabled me to see my own heart, neither applause, gain, nor other
selfe-advantage, was the end of publishing, but mainely, the glory of God, and
the help of those that stand in need, I have heard (in marches) complaints
that Authors already extant though good, were, as too great to be constant
companions, so of too great a price to loose: both which I hope will be removed
by this. I have endeavored so to suit it both for sea and land, that the young
beginner need for it, be neither troubled with chest or portmantue. For further
encouragement receive a catalogue of the Authors from whom collected, English,
D. Read, Parry, Mr. Woodal, Low. Latin, Sennertus, Zacutus Lusit, Hildanus, Ab
Aquapendente, Schenkius, Horstius, Carolus Piso, Paracelsus, Hartmanus,
Beguinus, Frambesarius, Fernelius, Minsicht, Poterus, Forestus, Guido,
Fontanonus, Pigraeus, Stockerus, Hollerius, Rulandus, Platerus, Wierus,
aventinus, Querceianus, Riverius, Fontanus, Beverovicius, and Johnstonus. Which
last may excuse me for epitomizing, though others works, besides thou have
thesecrets of practitioners, whose names are worthy to be mentioned, and
should; if it were not for fear of offending them, they came unexpectedly to my
hands, and are as freely set out forthy benefit. Thus thou see what has been
my labor and care for thy profit. If it be accepted of in good part by any,
it shall be thankfully acknowledged current satisfaction: and indeed for the
gain of such it is I have compiled it. As for other, though Iuniors in the
profession that think themselves so perfect, that they need no help, or
having bin taught by others, instead of thankfulness, throw dirt in their
faces: let them lay this down as being not intended for them, till they learn
more humility, and better manners. One thing more I shall beg of thee, that as
God has called thee out to be isntrumental to cure the distempers of others
bodies, so have regard to thy immortal soul, and look to those wounds wherein
thou may receive curing for thy better part: study humility, sobriety and
chastity, the contrary vices of the two latter with swearing and cursing, being
looked upon as the epidemicall sins reigning in the Artists, as also in the
Nation, for which may be expected a sharper deep cutting sword then yet we have
felt, and that feared, will end in ruin: give me leave to set down what is
writ for our learning, which the Lord set home effectually by his spirit to
thine, and my soul, to be both a curing and preventing remedy as there is
occasion, 1 Cor. 6.9.10. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit
the Kingdom of God, be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor
Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor
thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall
inherit the Kingdom of God. To conclude, it is my earnest desire to enjoy the
prayers of those who are interested in Christ; which shall (God inableing) be
answered with earnest breathings for thy eternal happiness by him who desires
to be accounted a brother, though unworthy.

Ad JACOBUM COOKUM Authorem, Epigramma.
LAudandi multum medici, celeberrime Cook,
Qui varios doctos composuere libros.
In quibus omne genus morborum gnaviter arcent,
Et variis servant corpora sana modis.
Nec minus interea (quae virtus laud vehenda est)
Evehimus reliquos compare laud viros,
Qui divina inventa solent Chirurgica, doctam
Colligere in methodum sedulitate pari.
In quorum numero cum sis gnarissime Cook,
O vir Apollinei spes opulenta chori,
Solvere grata tibi meritae praeconia laudis
Nos decet, ob pulchrae sedulitatis opus
Cuncta arcana simul quae tu Chirurgica pandis,
Quae Pater Hippocrates, quaeque Galenus habet.
Quaeque Aesculapius tenet, ac Avicenna, Machaon,

THE ART OF SURGERY.
PART. I.
SECT. I. CHAP. I.
PAssing by the Arguments that discover the excellency; we come to its self,
being the second part of the curative part of Medicine, (contained in natural
Philosophy) which teaches how diverse diseases of the body are to be cured by
manual operation. The parts of which are four: 1. To unite parts dis-joyned.
2. To separate parts unnaturally joined. 3. To remove things superfluous. 4. To
supply things wanting.


In the first is comprehended, 1. Tumors, the Solution, being gathered by
Reason. 2. Ulcers, Wounds, Fractures, and Dislocations, apprehended by Sense.

Of the first, Tumors, consider, 1. The Definition, viz. It is most frequently
a disease, sometimes a light affection, for the most part incident to the
Organicall parts, increasing their quantity above nature: by reason of
superfluous humors sent from other parts.

2. The Causes in general, are fluxion and congestion. The first, when a
humor offending in quantity, or quality, suddenly ceizeth upon a part. The
latter, when a humor is collected by little and little.

The special Causes are either external, or internal; The first is, all
outward things, which may cause Solution, whether non-naturalls, or of venomous
quality, the internalls are humors or flatuosities, and these are either
natural or unnatural; the first is either sincere, as Choler, etc. or mixed,
as some of the former, with Blood. 2. Unnatural, as water. The 3. General
thing is the differences, which are either simple, or compound. The simple are
either hot, as Phlegmon, and Erysipelas, or cold as Oedema, and Schirrhus, and
two more, which are Tumor. Aquos. and Flatuos. which are the offspring of
crudity, caused by weakness, or defect of natural heat. 2. Compound, which is
begotten of the combination of the former, and according to the predominancy of
the humor, arises the name, as if blood abound it is called Phlegmone
Erysipelatodes, etc.

Now for the general Indications of curing, they are taken either from the
matter or times of every Tumor.

In the first, Motion.
consider the Motion, and its Nature: for the former, its either flowing, or
received into the part.

The causes of Fluxion are two, Plethora, Causes.
and Cacochymia. The first is twofold, ad vasa, when the veins are only full,
and the body quick, etc. And this is either Pura, when the Humors are in due
proportion, or Impura, when there is excess of any Saving blood. Ad vires,
when there is such a fullness as causes sluggishnesse, this requires
bleeding; as Cacochymia purging.

As for Bleeding, Manner.
first, observe the manner, in fullness quoad vasa, draw what is convenient at
once, but in quoad vires, by repetition.

Secondly, Quantity.
the Quantity, in weakness, less; in strength, more; both which is discerned
by the Functions: as the weakness of the Natural, by the crudity of Urine,
and Excrements of the body. Of the Vital, by a weak and small pulse; as also
weak and thick breathing. Of the Animal, by defect in moving, and feeling. But
be diligent in distinguishing between weakness indeed, and oppression, by
reason of fullness, which makes dull and slow. For, as in the first, great
moderation is to be used. So in the latter, we may more freely evacuate.

Thirdly, The ends. As first Derivation, Ends.
which is a drawing of the humor to the parts adjacent of the same side.
Secondly, Revulsion, which is a drawing to the parts opposite, and this is used
when the matter flows slowly, or to prevent a disease; not having any place in
contagious Tumors.

In translation of humor flowing from any place, it must be dove either by
rectitude of parts, or of vessels, as if one bleed immoderately at the right
nostrell apply cups to the region of the liver, etc.

The second cause of Fluxion is Cacochym: which is not so much by reason of the
quantity as the quallity offending. Now this latter either moves from place to
place, or else rests where it first invaded. If it move, it is best abated by
bleeding; if it rest purge with proper medicaments.

The second Indicat is taken from the contagiousnesse, or not contagiousnes. If
not, the fluxion proceeds from three causes:

First, from the strength of the part sending, being burdened; in this case do
as in the second cause of Fluxion.

2. the Thinness of humor, in this, if we cannot use bleeding or purgation;
then must be used revulsion, by Cups without Scarif: Ligatures, Frictions,
bathing, Vesicatories, and Fontinels.

Thirdly, the Attraction of the part affected, which is caused either by
distemperature or pain, the first must be removed by contraries, only if with
it, there be joined patent passages: then apply astringents, as Bac. Mirtil,
ros. rub. Cort: granat. Querc. Balaust. Sumach, Sloes decoct in vin, rub. vel
aq. and aceto, or new Tanners woose rouling the part hard, or apply this upon
leather, rad. Torment. Bistort. Symphit. ros. rub. gallar. balaust. Malicor.
Sang. drac. bol. arm. santil. rub. cerus. ana i. cerae alb. iii. el. Myrtil. i.
M.f. Ceratum.

For pain, its caused either by solution or venomous quality; the first,
proceeds from hot, and sharp humors, which are to be encountered, with
Anodyns, or Narcoticks. If from the second, biting of vene mous beasts, etc.

First Scarifie, then apply cups, foment the part cum Theriae. dissol, in aceto
accerrimo, applying stupes wet therein, and above this. Pic. Naval. j. Sal.
Nitri s. Sem. Sinap. ii. Cepar. allii sub prun. cocti ana iij. assae faetid
sagapen ana iii. sterc. Columb. i. ss Aristol. rotund. Dictam alb. ana i. ol.
lilior. alb. s. f. Emp. Note the cups are to be applied with great flame, and
your stupes very hot, Pigeons applied are good, but the Actual Cautery is
best, after which Scarif: to the quick; not forgetting strong ligature, three
or four inches above the place bitten, withal administering inward Antidotes
for many days together, with some convenient decoctions; the same course take
with Tumors arising from contagious humors.

Now for indication from the times being four, beginning, increase, state, and
declination.

The first is, when the parts begin to swell, the action being not hindered,
for which apply repellers, remember to use slender diet, convenient evacuations
of the belly and bleeding. But note, that in six causes repellers are to be
omitted, as when the matter is malign, or critical, when the body is plethor.
or Cacochym. when humors flow to the Emunctories, if the part have little
natural heat, and when the pain is vehement.

The increase is when the part is stretched, and the symptoms are increased,
for which are to be used partly repellers, and partly discussers, the matter
being partly possessing, and partly flowing. But note, if the matter flow with
such force that it threatens corruption, or be thick and hot, as in a
Carbuncle, use scarif: and Leeches. Of discussing Medicaments there are three
sorts, which are severally to be applied according to the constitution of the
party.

The state is when its come to such degrees, as that it can go no further in
bigness, nor in symptoms, and the veins of the parts adjacent continue in
the same fullness, here we are to use Anodyns and discussives.

The declination is, when Tumor and symptoms abate, then strong discussives
are to be applied in necessity, using Diachyl. Mag. cum Gum. Mesu. vel ireatum.
Now because Tum: end not only by resolut: but by induration, corruption,
changing of the place, as also by maturation, we come to the cure of a Tumor
come to Suppuration.

CHAP. II. Suppuration.
FIrst considering when this is required; Suppuration.
and that is, first, when the humor is too plentiful, and natural heat
cannot rule it. Secondly, when its crude. And thirdly, when the matter is hard.

FOr spurious Tumors they are made from a mixture of the three other humors
with blood; therefore if choler abound, cool and moisten in a higher degree

contrariwise, Phyma
Phyma has more blood then choler, being a little red and painful, and much
elevated.

As for Furunculus, Furunculus.
its an inflamed pustle, with pain possessing the skin of the soft parts,
growing commonly to the bigness of a doves egg. For the cure of these if

SECT. II. CHAP. I. Ulcers.
WHich is a solution of unity from an inward cause eroding. The causes are
either Antecedent or Conjunct. The first are four.

First, Cacochymia, when any of the humors savouring blood is peccant in
quality.

Secondly, Contagion, this proceeds either from rotten vapors, as Phthysis, or
from lying with unclean or itchy persons, etc.

Thirdly, Distempers of the parts which are caused either by cold or heat.

Fourthly, all venomous stingings and bitings.

The Conjunct cause is when any humor is changed from its natural
temperature, whether by putrefaction, adustion, or commixtion of any thing
unnatural.

The differences of them are, either Simple or Compound: in the first, nothing
hinders from consolidation.

The Compound are either the mild or malign: The mild are either plain or
sinuous: The last either with or without callossity: The malign are either
less malign, as Herpes exced. Phagaedena: Some or very mal: as Cancer. If
internal, its discerned by the matter expelled as in Ulcers of the kidneyes
and bladder, there is purulent matter, in the urin, if in the lungs the matter
is cast out by cough, etc. As for externalls they are obvious.

In a body Cacochimall or dry and moist, as aged, children, and women,
dangerous; if critical, Apost. in the back or gren joints: most commonly
mortal if the place wherein the Ulcer is, be blackish, blew or gray, of round
figure, and painful, hard to cure: If bluish and pale, and party sick,
death. If complicate with a disease hard. If Tumors in Ulcers suddenly vanish,
without manifest cause it portends convulsion, if in the hinder parts, but
madness or plurisie if they were red and in the fore part: If hairs about the
Ulcer fall, look livid, where the bone is carious. If a flux of blood follow
after pulsation; if an Erysip appear the bone being bare, are ill, such as cast
out an oyley and thin matter that frets the skin, are hard: but Ulcers in a
body of a good complexion having soft Tumors, the quittor white, smooth and
equal, are easy.

General Cure. Cure.


In it observe first, that all Ulcers require desiccation.

Secondly, that in them there is four times:

First, Princip: when the quittor is thin and waterish.

Secondly, Aug-tum, when the quittor flows more sparingly and thicker.

Thirdly, statu, when there appears pus. and yet it is thinner.

Fourthly, Declin. when its white equally without smell.

The ways of curing are two.

First, removing Antecedent causes, as Cacochym. by altering and purging the
humors offending, Contagion by Alexiphar. Poison by Antidotes; the distemper of
the part by contraries.

Second is Artificial dressing, with which we meet with the conjunct causes
applying Medicaments according to the times. In princip. using suppuratives or
digestives, the quality of which are to be proportionated to the temperature of
the part.

But note, in two cases they are to be omitted. 1. In putrid, 2. In Rheumaticke

matter is white, and does not stink, and the cavity be without pain, and
remarkable Tumor, then agglutinate it S. A. in the manner of dressing, observe
these three thus:

First, lay upon the whole cavity, Empl ros. vel Emp. Cont. rup.

Secondly, insect the Medicament.

Thirdly, put in a leaden pipe short, shut up the pipe with an Empl. Snipt. and
above it a piece of sponge, and upon that a pledget of tow, letting from the
lower cavity to the orifice a boulster be applied, and above all a double
linen cloth, beginning your cowler at the bottom somewhat strait and toward
the orifice somewhat slacker.

Secondly, by opening when the matter cannot conveniently be discharged, and
that is done two ways:

First, by Causticke, and that when the cavity is lower, then the orifice,
either direct or oblique, but not very deep, yet though deep, if in the
breast, or the cavity be broad, you may either use causticks, or incision of
it; to open either first the lower end, or the whole cavity, the first is best,
if the sinus be enorme, or in a great joint, or there be great vessels,
tendons, or nerves in the way, upon which a great flux and lamenesse, the whole
cavity with a causticke.

Secondly, incision which is sooner done, with less pain, and easier cured,
which done, arm, pledgets, and dossets, with this alocs Hepat. ij. resin.

not till the second day at least.

CHAP. V. Fistula in general.
IS a sinuous ulcer, narrow and long, with callosity, having the quittor
virulent, ugly and stinking, pain small, unless in sensible part.

These are the differences with their signs, if plenty of matter, it not
passing to a remarkable cavity, there is more then one sinus; if matter be
various, diverse parts are affected, if it pass to the fleshly parts, the
matter is white, smooth, plentiful, if to a nerve, fatty and oleous; pain is
more, and motion is impared, being proved, is pricking; if to a vain and
Arteries, and coats not eroded, its redish, if Artery eroded, then the blood
comes bright with leaping, if a vein thick and black; if to the bone, the
matter is thin and yellow; if the smell be ill, and the bone hard without
slipping, the bone foul.

Prognostic.

No, Prognost
Fistul. is of easy curation, those that are shallow, and of short time, and
in fleshy parts in young and strong bodies, there is hope: If end in veins,
Arter, nerves, Tendon, blade, throat, breast, spina, joint, have sundry
sinuosities, and of long continuance, hardly cured. If in depending parts, and
nature, by them discharges superfluities, they do good, therefore heal them
not.

Curing general. Cure.


Secondly, which is either palliative or real, that palliative which for a
time dryes and shuts up the sinuosity by a thin skin, till humidity open it
again, and this is to be used when they help nature in discharging
superfluities; this is known if before their breaking open there be distemper,
and after ease.

First, in this a convenient diet as in Tumor Aquosus.

Secondly, purging either by decoct. or Ale, the latter being fit for those
that are aged and have weak stomachs. As thus, Guaiac. sarsap. ana iiij. rad.

In External cure, five things are observable.

First, Dilation, which is either by incision if the party bestrong, and it
superficial, being sure no cavities be left for fear of relapse; or by a
sponge prepared with Melilot plaster. Thirdly, by the Fistula Tent.

2. Intention is to remove the callus if it be not confirmed, it will in probing
be painful and bleed; now its removed either by Medicament or actual Cautery:
the first is of three sorts; the first is to be used to young persons its in a
fleshly part, and the callosity is small, as unguent Peti j. cum Turb. min. j.
The second is more strong, and are for strong bodies, etc. as ung. Apost. and
Turb. as before mixed. The last sort are Causticks, the more gentle is Turb.
mixed in greater quantity then before. The more harsh, as Realgar. alb.

these, if incision be sprinkle the callus with them, if by the sponge mix

draw a line with nicke between the glandule of the eye and the pupilla; then
make incision to the bone, dividing the parts incised with you nail till you

i.e. ss. at five a clock in the morning, four in the afternoon, at his
meals two pints, and the rest between. If the ending of the Fistula be lower
then the external orifice, a lower is to be made by incision, beginning at
the beginning of the next rib, Cure.
and not at the lower end of that above the which, the orifice shows it self,
for under is a vein, artery, and nerve couched.

First, divide the skin, then make way through the intercostal muscles, after
dry all this with a sponge, and put into the incision a swelling sponge; if you
pass no further then pleura, you need not fear, if you do, beware of the
diaphragma and pericardium. If with it there be a Marasmus or hecticke (use
cool and moystning diet, and of easy concoction) and the orifice be
inconvenient, you may pronounce them incurable or very difficult. For a Marasm:
its an immoderate dryness and consumption of the body by reason of the defect
of humidity substantial, of which there is two degrees:

The first, is in fieri in consuming.

The second, is in facto esse, or consummate.

In the first, the muscles begin to fall, the skin becomes flaggy, strength
and ability decay, and a manifest defect and impotency in the body in all the
faculties. Against this degree, contend with a moist diet.

If in the second degree the eyes grow hollow, the color of the skin fades,
the forehead dry and stretched, the eyelids heavy, temples hollow, and one
would think that the belly wants its contained parts, these are past cure.

Now Maras. is twosold, for one is accompanied with heat, and may be called a
dry Marasm. and the other accompanied with cold, and this is twofold; the one
natural which is decrepit old age; and the other unnatural, and is a decay by
reason of sickness, and does follow a burning or Hecticke fever, or else by
medicaments used in the curing of them, for the Hecticke does not only waste
the natural humidity, but the heat also, thence the heart becomes colder then
it ought.

Sign. Sign


In this case the pulse and breathing is small, weak, slow, and cold.

A Hecticke is an unnatural heat which seizing upon the solid part wastes
their moisture. Where note, as in the body there is a threefold moisture, viz.
the blood, a dewy substance and glutten. So there is three degrees of Hecticks.

In the beginning when the two first humidities begin to fail, the Hecticke
is not easily discerned, although the curation is not difficult; but if the
Radical moisture which keeps together the Terestriall substance of every
part be consumed as its easily discerned, so hardly cured, as long as the
moisture is somewhat plentiful, sufficient to entertain natural heat. The
body seems well colored, of a comely figure, of a decent quantity; but if
contrary, leave such a one to himself, unless he implore your help; then for
the Fistula it self, inject of aq. plantag. cum sir. ros. sicc. cover your
Tents and pledget with diachylon. sym. for the Maras: appoint broths of mutton,
veale, or chicken, wherein damask prunes, rasins stoned, currants washed and
bruised, Mallow flowers and roots, Marrygold, cinque foil, cowslip flowers,
and coalts foot leaves and flowers, have been boiled, gellyes are made of
young cockrels and veale, with a little mace and nutmeg; let him have between
meals almond milk made of the broth of chickens boiled with French barley,
use every morning and evening Ass milk, or Goats, or Cowes, milked through
the conserve of borrage or buglosse flowers, Calves, and Sheep feet stewed are
good with currants; sometimes let him eat pigs flesh, if he have mind to fish,
grant him Whiting-mops, Smelts, Perches, young Pickerels, Trouts, Sole,
Flounder and Plaice, sometimes Eeles, poched eggs, cum Butyr. S.S. and aq.
ros. are good for breakfast.

If a Hecticke be the cause of a Maras. then you must moysten and cool in the
broaths, then boil borrage, succory roots, sorrel, luiula, primrose, violets,
flor. bor. and buglosse, let his sallets be lettice, spinach, and purslaine,
boiled in chicken broth, use almond milk every morning, and even, as amygd. d.

CHAP. VIII. Fistula's of the back, belly and joints:
FOr the first, if the vertebr: be foul they are incurable, which only dress

and more extenuate, notwithstanding all means.

CHAP. IX. Belly.
FOr the second, of the Belly, they are of two sorts:

First, those in the groyne.

Secondly, those in the Ano:

The first falls out most often after venerall bubos or in Plethoricke and
Cacochym bodies, yet sometimes they are above the groine: If in these the guts
be eroded, they are incurable, therefore use an inject ex rub: vino in quo
par. alum. dissol: cum sir: Mirtin: lot the party observe to eat calves and
sheeps feet stewed, sheep and calves heads, Rice boiled in milk, wherein steel
has been often quenched, every morning and evening take a draught of Aligant
warmed with a white toste, keep the orifice open with a sponge until the gut
be consolidated, then proceed as in Fistula's in general, if they run only
superficially, the best cure is by incision.

CHAP. X. In Ano.
FOr that in Ano, it either peirceth into intestinum rectum, or not, if it do,
the excrement and wind will break forth with the matter, the injection and
probe will pass into the gut that you may feel the latter; it is hard of
cure, being the jakes of the body.

Cure, is either by incision, injection or deligation; the two former have
been sufficiently handled, which are to be used when it peirceth not
intestinum rectum, to consolidate use the Sir. Magistr: and pull. Cephalic. if
you cannot conveniently use the first, use the Troch: or the sponge; for the
last deligation, first dilate, then remove the callus, after bind it with
sealed thread, or silk twisted, put one end of the thread in the eye of the
probe, after thrust it in at the sinuosity into intestin. rectum, where have
your finger ready to receive the thread, and draw it out at ano if it be not
thick and long, you may bind it at twice, otherwise you must use sundry,
after its done, cure S.A.

CHAP. XII. Malign Ulcers.
NOw of Malign Ulcers, which are not easily cured, they have fierce causes,
extraordinary symptoms, and yield not to ordinary medicaments, these happen
when Cachexia has possessed the ulcerated part, and do corrupt the aliment
sent for nourishment thereof, this is done either by putrefaction, or a
venomous quality communicated.

Sign, Sign.
Of Malign Ulcers, great pain, plenty of virulent and stinking matter. The
first is, Herpes exedens.

CHAP. XIII. Herpes exedens.
ITs livid and uneaven, the middle heales, and lips remain sore, they appear
most often in old people in the leg at the beginning of the tails of the
Muscles, being very painful and rebellious, the lividity is caused by
melancholy joined, when its absent, the part is yellowish.

Prog. Not easily cured, the liver, Gall and porus bilaris, being out of frame,
and so they not able to evacuate the humor by the guts and urin, and therefore
they pass to the habit of the body by the veins and arteries. If Atra bilis
be added its more hard to cure.

first is an ulcer corrhoding skin and flesh, having the brims tumified, but

CHAP. XV. Cancer.
IS a Tumor unequally painful, hard, livid, and hot, having full veins in the
adjacent parts. In the beginning, being hard to discern, being no bigger then
a Pea, proceeding from Bil. Atra, begotten of yellow choler caused from a hot
distemper of the liver, weakness of the spleen, stopping of the Hemorod or
menstr. or from ill diet, as by hot things; showing themselves most commonly at
the end of Sumer, and in the harvest quarter.

Prog. None are of easy curation. Prognost.
If they possess any great cavity, as Matrix and Anus, deal not with them by
excision, causticke or burning. If they be great, and the party weak,
incurable: If in the outward parts and superficial, and be not of remarkable
bigness, they may by incision be cured.

Cure. Cure.

because its seldom presented to be cured, we pass it by, and come to
accidents that hinder cure, and these are either familiar to nature, or
estranged from it: of the first of these we will first speak, and in the
first of Superfluous flesh.

CHAP. XVII. Superfluous flesh:
WHich is abated with Turbith. M. ij. alum. usti j. Misce; if it be too hard
apply causticke, or cut it off, the last is best.

Corruption of the bones, the causes are either outward, as cold and heat
exceeding, or inward, as superfluous humidity, sharp and malign matter.

The signs are either sensible when the bone is black, feel rugged, if the
flesh above be spungeous, or of a livid color, if Tents reaching to the bones
smell, or intellectual, if quittor flow too plentifully be thin and stinking;
if it admit of skinning, and break forth again, if it be long in healing, and
rebel against proper medicaments, its soul.

Cure. Cure.
First, lay bare the bone, either by incision, causticke, or dilatation.

Secondly, scale the bone, cum pull. euphorb. excellent, if it be deep with some
instrument, sometime by actual cautery when humidity abounds and the bone
feels soft, pull. Cephalic is good, mum. sarcoc. ana s. euphorb. j.f. pull.

CHAP. XVIII. Of a discolored.
THe first is of four sorts, red, yellow, livid or black, red proceeds from
heat, or by blood offending either in quantity or quality. The first is known
if the body be plethoricke. The second, if it be too hot and fervid.

For the first, bleed, scarifie the part, and apply leeches, if it happen
through defect of Hemorod or menstr. procure their fluxion: The first by
applying the leeches: The second by using Elix. propriat. or pil pestilent
Arab. being taken sundry mornings. For the second, open Saphaen. in foot is
most apparent, exhib. calyb. medicament: for quality use cold and moist diet,
apply acet. ros. vel sambuc. and acetum.

Secondly, livid coming by corrupt and black blood settled in the part; for
this you are to scarifie, apply leeches, after foment. cum oxymet. dissol. in
aq. Card. bened. If it proceed from cold which is perceived by the temper of
the part apply this, a Turnip and a radish root, scrape these two, and add to
them of the powder of mustard seed, j. Caryoph. pull. iij. ol. lini and jugland.
q.s.f. Catap. which apply warm, this has cured diverse Gangreens.

Thirdly, black, which may either proceed from heat or cold, if from heat an
inflammation went before. If from cold lividity did proceed, which is a sign
of mortification, especially if no heat or feeling do remain.

In both these cases the parts are profoundly to be scarified, using a
lixiuum, wherein is decocted absinth. Centaur. Minas, Scordium Card. bened.
flor. Cham. aneth. flor. Melilot. after fill the incision of the
scarifications, with some of the medicament following using a feather, oxym.

CHAP. XIX. Varicous Ulcer.
WHich is the tumefication of the veins, by reason of superfluous gross
blood, it happens oftnest to those that have bad spleens to men rather then
women, its caused by thick and impure air, immoderate exercise, long standing,
thick wine, and gross food.

Prognost. Prognost.
If they appear in those that are mad by reason of melancholy, the grief

spleen, are not to be cured.

best is to take up the vein above and below, and upon it betwixt the
deligation, that the blood may be discharged out of it.

CHAP. XX. Vermous and lousie Ulcer.
WHich is known by a strange itching and pain in the part and stink: use
decoct. of dry Tobacco, excellent, or absinth. Centaur. M. Marrub. ana Mj. Coq.

CHAP. XXI. Particular Ulcers, first of the head.
WHich are of two sorts, moist and dry: the first are two, Acher and Favus, the
former is an ulcerous Tumor of the head in the skin, red and duglike, having
small holes, out of which issues a thin and ulcerous sanies; the latter is the
like, only the holes are larger, and the humor in thickness like honey. Note
they are contagious, and are caused of sharp and fretting humors, in both
there is an itching, and the Favus has scales, they are of hard curation.

For Cure, use the same diet prescribed in Cancer, if Plethor, and the head be
full of corrupt blood, bleed in both arms, under the tongue, and vena Frontis,
yea and the arteries of the temples. Purge first general, as Confec. Hamech.

till the party be healed: For particular evacuation, use neezing. Concerning
outward means, ol. Bombacinum, is excellent, as also water Cresses boiled in
axungia, both which is also good for Tinea, a thing like a cap spread with a
medicament made, ex pic. liquid. and Terbith. and applied for a month every day
once, or every second or third day, is good; so general means have gone
before; if children be presented, let the caps be so put on, that they may not
pull the medicaments off. Secondly, if they be malign, meddle not with them
till they be elder. Sulp. ij. sinapis s. staphyd. agriae. rad. bryon. ana j.

differ, only they are dry and crusty and commonly white; if this or other be
in children Decoct. folior. nuc. Jugland. ung. Enulat. cum merc. duplic. a
fontinell. in the hinder part of the head, is excellent.

CHAP. XXII. Ulcer of the ears and eyes.
OF the first of these, the causes, are either outward, as blows or falls; or
internal, as sharp humors sent from the brain, its sometimes with
excrescence of flesh.

Cure. First, purge, as Pil. aggreg. Aur. ana j. Troch. Alhand. diagrid. ana s.
spir. vit. q.s. and for. pil. four dos. two at five in the morning, four
hours after take broth.

Cure external, Cure.

is excellent, if it be foul, and worming, if they afford great store of
quittor, dress them once a day, if not, once in two days, if there be
excrescence of flesh; first administer the Pills, and then consume the flesh
with the Fistule powder, after inject this, vini alb. ij. Aegyp j. Mel. ros. s.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the eyes.
WHich have the same causes as before. In curing use good diet, bleeding,
purging, applying of the Seton or Fontin. the ulcers are either mild or
malign, and because opthal. are the forerunners of the ulcers of the
conjunctiva of it, we will first treat.

CHAP. XXIV. Opthalmia.
ITs a Tumor with pain, and horrible heat; of which there is three sorts.

1. Conturbatio, arising from outward causes or inward, and is not much.

2. Is real, and is always from an inward cause.

3. Is called Chymosis, when the inflammation is so great that it causes the
turning up of the eyelids, which often falls out to those that are very
plethorick, and have abundance of Pituitous humors. If it be from the stomach,
the desire to vomit, if from the head, there is a pain, if from the vessels
without the Cranium they will be full in the forehead, the Arteries beat, and
the eyelids be heavy; if within, the party often neezeth, and the nose
itcheth, if of blood, the face will be red, the veins full, if from
flatuosities, there will be singing in the ears, and tensive pain, if from
phlegm, the eyelids will in the night time cleave together.

Cure. Cure.
Use cold and moist diet, after a Glyster, let blood plentifully, if it be

CHAP. XXV. Ulcers of Cornea.
WHich are either superficiary or deep, caused of salt and nitrous humors.

Cure. Seeing all ulcers of the eyes denote a body Cacochyme, Cure.
its to be altered, but per epicrisin shunning all strong Catharticks. For
topicalls, you can have no better then what is prescribed page 64. l. 10. Those
that are malign may have the same, remembering to keep an exquisite diet, purge
once a week, as spec. Hier. s. diagrid. ij. Troch. alb. v. cum sir. August. f.
Mass. dos. j. in one pill. Alter your bread and beer, with proper seeds and
herbs, and use after meals a digestive powder, keeping the body open with
Glisters; for Cancers they are either to be extirpated, or otherwise, only
receive a palliative cure, with gentle medicaments.

CHAP. XXVI. Ozaena.
ITs a malign ulcer caused of sharp humors, eroding the part, being either
contagious, or not, the latter is from the Lues ven. both are hard to cure.

Use diet, and purging, such as may contemperate and take away the sharpness
of the humor, bleed, use cups cum scar. as also vesicatories and Font. if
necessary, purge twice a week with Extr. Rudii, as also Antimon. that purges
most by stool, which is excellent.

caused by an external instrument, incising in any part of the body. The
differences are in the cures. The general Prognost. are these: As,

First, some are dangerous, Prognost.
which are sometimes cured, but for most part cause death, as superficial
wound in the brain.

Secondly, difficilia, such as may be cured if well dressed, if not, remain
uncured, as some penetrating wounds of the breast.

Thirdly, malefica, such as leave a hurt after they are cured, as the Nerves
want motion, etc.

Fourthly, Lethalia, as those that pierce deep into noble parts, or divided
great vessels; Therefore in all

Prognost. Prognost.
Observe these four things.

First, the parts affected.

Secondly, the adjuncts of the wound, as bigness, situation, etc. symptoms,
or complicate, with other diseases.

Thirdly, the habit of the body.

Fourthly, the use of the part.

For the part it self consider: First, the dignity. Secondly, the substance.
Thirdly the temperature. Fourthly the situation. Fifthly, the quality: These
considered Prog. Prognost.
may be made surely. These premised, union is to be performed, which has two
intentions:

First, Agglutination.

Secondly, Concarnation. All fleshy part always and spermaticall parts till
the sixth year admit of the first, after the second is to be used: the causes
of union are two, efficient and isntrumental: the efficient are Nature and
Chyrurg: Nature is the chief, the Chyrurg: being a minister, and therefore is
to accommodate Nature, with both common and proper duties necessary to both
intentions. The common to both are first staying blood, and that's done eight
ways:

First, by applying pledget, with alb. ov. and posca.

Secondly, deligation of the vessel.

Thirdly, applying Gallen powder, using it thus, couch the vessel with your
finger, then cleanse the blood away with a sponge and red wine, after
besprinkle about your finger with powder, apply upon the place pledgets with
the same medicament, which keeping close down, fill the wound with pledgets or
dorsells armed, and upon them a double cloth wet in some astringent liquor,
rolling it up beginning below the wound, and at the wound run it three or four
times about, dress it not till the third or fourth day, then all is to be
taken away except the last, and new besprinkle it, and apply new pledgets: Thus
after the first you are to dress it every other day, until the place be
incarned, and no fear of a flux.

Fourthly, by injection.

Fifthly, by causing an escarr, cum umber and Call. viv. aeq. part. f. L. cum
alb. ov: and pil: lepor: this is also excellent in Amputation.

Sixthly, by opening a vein.

Seventhly, by setting them in cold water.

Eighthly, internal potions, as diascord. iiij. Phylon. perfic. s. diacod. i.
aq: pap: erratic: vel sper: ranar: iii: M. f p sumend, frigid: after taking,
keep quiet, and address himself to sleep, it may be given every twelve
hours: the two last are excellent in bleeding of the nose.

Second duty is to remove extraneous bodies, in which observe two things;

First, the kinds of extraneous bodies; as first they are so by accident, and
these are of three sorts: As first, soft, as contused flesh and clotted blood.
Secondly, hard, as bones and Cartilages; or Thirdly, mean, as pieces of
membranes, tendons and hair.

Secondly, extraneous of their own nature, which are either soft, as pieces of
garments; or hard, as steel, weapons, pullets, shivers of wood, gravel, etc.
these are to be removed, such as may be by washing, and the rest with forceps:
remembering things deep, painful, or difficult, (and yet the wound may be
cured) may remain, as also if the wound be mortal, or cannot be got out by
instruments, then apply the horned popyes, both the pimpernels and henbane, or
this litharg. lb j. ol. lb ij. Colopho. lb s. cerae iiij. amoniac. ari stol.

cret. aloes Hepat. squam. aeris, propol. ana vj. f. Emp. s. a. this is
excellent, as also against malign ulcers, dries moist bones, being answerable
in virtues to Paracels.

The natural temperature of the part is to be preserved, and being lost
restored, both which are to be done:

1. By a due ordering of the six nonnatnrall things.

Secondly, by applying apt medicament. Now the natural temper is the
convenient dryness of the part for siccum est sano proximum; therefore the
nonnaturall is to be ordered accordingly, as the air must be warm, diet cool
and slender, till the seventieth day be past, their drink may be this, aq.
Font. lb iij. vini alb. lb j. avenae mund. iiij. Coq. ad consumpt. lb j. Col.
add aq. ros. Coch. iij. sac. opt. iiij. For evacuations bleed, if the wound be
great or inflamed, if stitches be to be deep, pain much; if the body be
plethor or fevourish, if furious in Summer, or wound be in great joints, purge
with Cholagog in wound of the joints, stitches be deep, inflammation,
dilatation, incision, rasping of the bones, or an Erysip: Command rest, forbear
immoderate sleep, remove all perturbations of the mind, and chiefly avoid
Venus. As for the observation of excrements, Ichor is thin, and issues either
from the veins or wounded part; if from the first, its waterish, and thin,
without noisome smell, having color according to the humor predominate: if
from the wound it has an unpleasant smell: the second is sordes, this is
compact and viscous, and cleaves to the part: Third is pus which is white,
smooth, and equal.

The causes of these, are either efficient, which is either natural or
unnatural heat: The first begets good matter, the latter causes putrefaction,
and an ill smell: or material, and these are either contused flesh, which by
digestion must be turned into quittor: or a humor which most commonly
symbolizeth with the parts complexion, whether it be natural or accidental:
the first is good, the latter ill; the last duty is the removing of general
accidents, which accompany all sorts of wound, as pain and fainting: for the
first, either anodyns, as ung. alb. Camphor. ol. lilior. aneth. vel Cham. f.
Lt. if this prevail not, use Narcoticks, as ung. Pop. and alb. Camph. ana j.
ol. Hyoscyam and mandrag. ana js. Misce f. Lt. For fainting, use Confect. Aker.

We come to the last scope of a Chyrurgion, which is to unite, being performed
either Aggluti. the first or Concarn. the second intention. Now for the first,
three things offer themselves.

First, the brimmes are to be joined together.

Secondly, so to be kept.

Thirdly, Agglutinall medicaments must be applied.

In the first, let them be done by degrees.

Secondly, equally.

Thirdly, if stiff, foment with oil and water.

As for the second to keep them joined, is first by dry stitching, viz. when
pieces of cloth are applied, cum farin. volat. j. Myrrh. mastic. Sang. drac.
pull. ros. rub. gum. Tragac. f. pull. tenuis. cui add alb. ovi Nj. aq. ros. q.
s. ad consistent. mel. The cloth must be strong indented, and be applied four
hours before they be stitched, this may be used in women, eminent persons, and
to strengthen the other.

The next is stitching with needles, of which there are two kinds, as either
the brimmes are kept together with the thread, or else the needle is also left
in: of the first of these, there is 3. sorts:

First, is the glovers stitch, which is used in the wounds of the bellies and
great branches of aorta and vena Cava.

Secondly, when stitches are taken distant one from another.

The third is when the great muscles of the belly and Peritonaeum are wounded.

The second is when the needles are left in, which is used in the cure of the
hair-lip and in Trach, Arteria. Now the use of stitches is either to procure
quick agglut. or to retain the parts, though distant asunder, and this may be
used in wounds after the second intention.

Thirdly, to stay bleeding; and not in stitching wounds; stitches are to be an
inch asunder in long wound beginning at the ends, in short in the middle, the
last way is rouling. The medicaments to be applied are Lt. Arcei bal. Nigr.
Artif. as ol. olivar. Antiq. lb iij. ol. Terbint. Clar. lb ij. olib. pull. lb j.

agitando continue donec incorporentur deinde add vinum and misce and decoq.
donec vinum evaporet; this is excellent also to heal by Concarnation which is
by the second intention, and this is to be followed when substance is lost,
the bone is to scale, a great flux is feared, when wound is in the arme-pits,
or great joints, and cachochyme bodies, or troubled with contagious or
obstructive diseases: if superfluous flesh arise abate it. There happens upon
wounds,

CHAP. II. A Convulsion.
WHich is a contraction together of the muscles, or parts appointed for
voluntary motion toward their beginning; of which there is two sorts.

First, natural when one of two muscles appointed for motion is contracted,
the other being transversly wounded, as in the temporal muscle.

Secondly, unnatural, and this is twofold.

First, motus convulsivus, caused of a thin and halituous matter moving too and
fro, not long continuing.

Secondly, convulsio vera, is caused either of plentiful gross matter, or by
consent from a noisome vapor: of this there is four kinds* 1. Emprosthotonos,
i.e. when the neck and the rest of the body is drawn forward. 2.
Opisthotonos, i. e. when the whole body is drawn backward. 3. Tetanos, i.e.
when both back and fore parts are easily contracted. 4. Spasmus Cynicus, i.e.
when the mouth is pulled awry. The causes are three.


1. Fullness, discerned by the thickness and fleshinesse of the body, if the
vessels appear full, the pulse be strong, the party look ruddy, the wound
bleed little, and the urin laudable and plentiful.

oil, being added, optimum etiam est fovere occiput and cervicem aq. vit.

If from emptiness (which is rare) the signs are contrary to the former, in
this use only emolient glysters, baths, and anoint as in Feb. Hect. If by
consent it happens, three ways:

1. From a malign vapor, as in poisoned wound; in this dilate the wound, then
apply cups to it, in it put Mithrad. dissol. in spir. vini vel aq. There. parum
mercurii proper.

2. From pain, then use as Chap. 32. Sect. 3. If by cold; first keep the party

else escape. A Convulsion, after a wound is commonly deadly: if after raving or
immoderate bleeding, ill. If in the face use gargar. errhin. sternut. Cups, if
a fevor follows its incurable; if it proceed from choler to open the right
salvatell, is excellent: if from wind, the decoct. of Ebony forty days: if
from fullness, pil. faetidae Hier.

CHAP. III. Palsy.
WHich is opposite to the former, is when the parts are so loosened and weakened
that they are not fit for voluntary motion; the causes of which though many (
viz. cold air, immoderate Venus, narcotick medicaments, drunkenness,
especially by wine, yet more frequently from phlegm, the nerve being made
thicker and narrower, and so unapt to receive the Animal spirits. The
narrowness being caused either from obstruction by a thick tough humor, or by
compression, with a humor, or tumor contusion, a sudden luxation, a strait
ligature, or leaning upon a part cold, or by solution of unity, and that is,
when either divided by a wound, or sharp humor.

Signs. Signs.
Its a privation of motion, sometimes of feeling, which is either universal or
particular. If it possess one side of the face and body, then that side of the
brain and spina, is the cause; if one side of the face, then that side of the
brain; if the head be sound, and either side affected, it comes from the spin.
medul. of the same side; if the arms, the 5, 6, and 7, Vertebra of the neck is
affected; if the legs, its in the vertebra of the loins, and or sacrum: if any
particular part be paralytick, then the causes is in the sprig of some nerve
inserted in that part.

Prognost. Prognost.
If from a nerve transversly cut in sunder, incurable; if strong and proceeding
from an inward cause, in old persons in winter time, following an appoplexy,
wherein both motion and feeling is lost after strong and sudden luxation of the
vertebra, if the part be extenuated and color changed, its hard to cure, a
trembling after a palsy, the part hot, and fever follow, its good, as also if
the belly flux; but if the parties eye be weak on the side affected, its
incurable.

Cure. Cure.
Diet, dry and warm, instead of ordinary drink, use the decoct of Guaic. or
in the beer hang a bag of herbs which strengthen the nerves, forbear wine;
use clysters, if Plethor. ven. sect. on the sound parts by degrees, but
sparingly, after which, presently use frictions on the sound part, and lightly
upon the part affected. Use purging, as in cold affects of the head, every
fourth or fifth day; if the disease be contumacious, use these Pills once a
week, Mass. pil. faetidar. major. and Coch. Min. ana s. Troch. alhand. g. iiij.
but because the humor need pp. therefore betwixt every dos. of pills, for three
or four days before take three or four ounces of this following, every

affected part, let it be narrow and stay but a while, touch the stupid part
with quick nettles, foment with nervall herbs, after anoint with unguent,

threatens a gangreen, for then you are to go about to meet with the sy

expired, refrain from bleeding, purging, vomiting and clysters; the party must
sleep sparingly, and use a moderate diet, every morning, administer j. of some

CHAP. VI. De Sclopetorum vulneribus.
THe wounds are either malign, or not, if not, it need no other sign then the
patients own describing or others. If malign, then an ugly color will
appear, as if it tended to mortification, horrible pain, and pricking, great
inflammation, heaviness of the whole body, a sharp fever, fainting, raving,
and especially if no evident cause can be given for these accidents. If the
bullet be poisoned being cut, it will be of a violet color.

Prognost. Prognost.
If it be only in a fleshy part, the constitution good, the air favorable,
easily cured. If in the spermaticall parts, violently torn, if the body
cacochyme, the air hot and moist, and the wind south, if there be signs of
poison, fear of a gangreen, hard to be cured, and come slower to suppuration
then other wounds.

The symptoms of ordinary wounds are contusion, pain, inflammation,
convulsion, heat, palsy, sometimes a gangreen, and mortification, which may be
prognosticated. If it be long before it come to suppuration, the color of the
part inclining to yellow and livid, the pain and pulsation ceasing, and the
part stupid.

Cure. Cure.
First, remove extraneous bodies.

Secondly, draw out the bullet if it be easy to be done, if we fear a Tumor
which may corrupt the part, or if the weapon be poisoned, before you do it
observe the form of the body to be drawn out how deep it is in the part, with
the symptoms, if pain be great, extract it presently, if great flux be
feared, do it. In extraction, observe, if the weapon be poisoned or cankered,
do it presently: but if there be horrible pain, a convulsion, a fever or a
syncope: if the weapon be round; if the orifice be narrow by inflammation or
Tumor, if you have not a convenient instrument, defer it. Now for the way by
which they are to be drawn; it must be thrust out,

First, if it be almost through, if the figure of the instrument will not admit
the drawing, the same way as barbed arrows: if there be a fear of cutting
great vessels. The instruments are blunt hooks to lift up a vessel when the
weapon is to be taken out, a pair of hollow forceps, goose bills, ravens
bills, incising forceps; note this, that the patient be set in the same
posture in which he was when he was hurt, and search the weapon out with your
finger.

Secondly, use suppuratives, such as in contusions, as ol. Catul. or other
digestives, only forbearing, in case putrefaction be feared, and when its in a
nervous part, to hinder putrefaction, use unguent Aegyp. cum spir. vini, with
tents.

Thirdly, prosecute the cure as in other wounds, with convenient medicaments,
ol. Catulor. ol. lilior. alb. lb iiij. in quo Coq. Catul. N ij. nuper not. ad

instrumentis scindentibus factis, especially in wounds by shot.

In the dressing of these wounds observe these cautions: If the south wind
blow, and you fear putrefaction, use aq. vitae and vitriol. calcinat.

Secondly, use escaroticall medicaments.

Thirdly, Tents at first are to be made longer and greater that the wound may
be dilated.

Fourthly, if the contusion be great, and possess much of the adjacent parts
they are to be scarified to discharge the parts of congealed blood, which is
apt to putrify.

Fifthly, if there be any burning, use such medicaments as are fitting.

Sixthly, cooling and astringent medicaments after the first dressing, but
those that are Anodyne, Emollient and suppurative, as Micae panis Tritic. iiij.
lact. recent. lib. j. flor. Cham. Melilo. ana p. j. farin. Hord. and fabar. ana
j. Coq. omnia ad catap. tum ad. vitel. ovor. Nij. ol. viol. and ros. ana js.

Seventhly, its sufficient to dress the wounds in twenty four hours once,
unless much quittor flow, the party be feavourish, and feel great pain, then
dress it every twelve hours after digestion, which will be about the fifth or
sixth days, use mundificat. as Paracel. vel ex opio, after in carne s. a. If
soft spermaticke parts be wounded and torn, use this, Tereb. venet. ol.
Tereb. and hyperic. an^ ij. Turbith. flau s. tutiae, Euphorb. calc. viv. ana j.
Misce. If the hard spermat. parts, as bones, and cartilag. then praedict.
compos. Tereb. ol. Hyper. and Tereb.. pull. Cephal. j s. apply it warm, this
will suppurate and scale the bones.

If it be poisoned.

Then scarifie the brimmes deeply, apply ventosies, and exhibit Mithrid. and
Theriac. in aq. Card. b. fragar. vel. Ceras. nig. dressing the wound with this,
decoct. lupinor. ac lentium ana lb js. aceti lib. j sal. commun. alum. ana j.
virid. aeris s. Mel lib. s. Coq. omnia ad Mel. consistentiam ad. Theriac. s.
either apply this upon tents, or by way of injection, use it till fearful
symptoms cease, neither bleeding nor purging, till the force of the poison be
abated; but in ordinary wounds you are to bleed, if the party be plethorick,
and purge if cacochimick.

CHAP. VII. Wounds of the Head.
NOw for wounds in particular, and first of the Head, wherein something
general is to be set down; as first the aversion of humors, which either have
or are likely to procure sympt, this is done three ways,

First, by bleeding, either universal or particular; the first is performed by
opening a vein (if sufficient quantity did not flow from the wound, when
inflicted if the wound be great, and the party strong: if great inflammation
have invaded the part, or a fever seized upon the party. For the quantity, its
either to be done all at once or at diverse times; for the first way stop the
vein when the pulse app areth smaller and slower, the forehead sweat, the face
grows pale, when a pain on the heart grows on, with yawning, and desire to
vomit, or to go to stool: If at sundry times you draw blood, you must do it
till all symptoms as fever and inflammation cease, the veins to be opened
are the Basil. or Median, on the same side, if blood much abound; if not, the
Cephal. will serve, or veins near the wounded part, as in the forehead,
temples, and tongue.

Now for particular detraction of blood is from the part affected by
scarifying. To the lips of the wound, apply cups or leeches. If they will not
admit of bleeding, use strong frictions of the whole body.

Second thing is to purge with catharticks, clysters, or suppositories: the
first of these are to be exhibited when the party is lumpish, and has the head
ache, when a tumor or inflammation appears, when the body is Cacochym: so
there be strength, the matter prepared, and the body open and passable, these
are to be administered in the beginning lest strength decrease, fever increase,
and so hinder the ascent of humor to the head. The medicaments to be used, are
such as purge choler, yet gently, and the dos. not great, as lenit. vel diapru.
in decoct. of myrabal. vel sir. ros. ij. aq. plantag. iij. let the air be
temperate and thick, wine is not to be permitted to the fourteenth day, the
first seven days let him shun meat, and only live on panadoes, and after
meat, use conser. ros. antiq. let sleep be taken only in the night, unless
there be inflammation of the brain and menynges: if watching trouble, anoint
the temples with unguent. popul. inwardly use something that may cause sleep,
as lauda vel diacod. the room is to be kept dark; shun venery, and keep the
body soluble.

Prognost. Prognost.
In persons otherwise diseased, and children, hard to be cured. If a Tumor
vanish suddenly; a fever happen the eleventh or fourteenth day, its dangerous.
If the lips grow livid, reason fail, tongue look black and dry, its deadly;
those in the temples and sutures, are dangerous; but if the fever come on the
seventh day, and the lips tumifie a little, it is easy.

For pain and inflammation, farin. Hord. iiii. poscae vj. coq. ad Catap. ad.
ol. ros. ij. This asswageth pain, cooles, repells, and dryes, vel B^ Micae.
pan. alb. iiij. lac. rec. vj.f. Catap. add unguent. popul. ij. croc. ij. This
is excellent in hot and dry complexions; after applycation of the medicaments
put on a cap to cover the whole head basted with fine tow, not quilted, nor too
heavy, then roll with a rouler three inches broad, and a fathom and a half
long.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Head.
NOw for particular wounds of the head, and first,

A Contusion without Effusion of blood in parts above the Cranium.

In it there is a Tumor without a wound, and often blacknes and blewnes; in
this case shave the hair, then apply this medicament, alb. ovi Nj. ol. Myrtin.
and pull. ejusdem ana j. Misce. This is to be used till the part come to its
own temperature, or conformity, dressing the part twice a day: If after the
pain is gone, and the flux of humor ceased; a tumor remain, use this, Empl.
de mucilag. ij. oxycroc. and Emp. Melilot. ana j. ol. Cham and Aneth, ana ij.
f. ex his Ceratum s.a. If by this it vanish not but pain and fluxion of the
humor betwixt Cranium, and skin continue, then make incision, and after, if the
skull be sound, use this, sir. eros. rub. sic. and absinth. ana j. Terbinth.
s. irid. aloes Myrrh. mastic. and far. hord. ana s. Misce s.a. If the Cranium
be foul, then smooth it with a raspitory, and apply this excellent powder,
rad. irid. Gentian. Aristol. rotund. dictam fat. bor. ana s. aloes Hepat. sang.
drac. Myrrh. mastic. sarcocol. ana ij. f. pull. and after the scale is fallen,
cure S.A.

If by great contusion a gangreen shall ensue, as may be known, when the part
grows hard, livid, and black, then scarifie, apply cups, and use proper
medicaments; as for wounds of the same parts, whether they bare the Cranium or
not, a general method will serve.

CHAP. IX. Wounds in the Temporal Muscles.
CAll for some special consideration, in respect of fearful symptoms that
follow, they are inflicted three ways, a puncture, transverse, and length
ways; the two first, if deep, are dangerous, being accompanied with vomiting,
convulsion, and deep slumbering, and is hard to cure, being in continual
motion. If a puncture, be not too hasty to dilate, but the hair being taken
away, dress it, cum ol. hyper. and lumbric. and Empl. Paracel. or the last
alone.

If transverse, then stitch it, using Lt. Arcei. and above it Emp. Apodoldech.
vel Paracel. If according to length; first, stay the blood, then stitch it:
note that its better to cure wounds of the head by agglutin. then Concarnation.

CHAP. X. If the scull be foul or hurt.
WHich falls out three ways:

First, by the air, it having lain bare two hours, which you may perceive,
if rasped it bleed not, then use that instrument till it bleed, and perform
the cure by agglutination. Cure.


Secondly, if the first table be divided from the second, and cleave to the
cutis musculosa, then take it away, and cure either by Agglut. or Concarn.
which is most convenient.

Thirdly, when a portion of the whole cranium is divided, so that dura matter is
seen, this is to be reduced and there kept by bringing the lips of the wound
together, with so many deep and strong stitches as shall suffice, the wound
having been cleansed with either vino vel spir. ejusdem.

CHAP. XI. Wounds of the head with contusion.
OF which there are two sorts; either ordinary or extraordinary: for the
ordinary, which is without malign symptoms, dress thus.

First, wash them, cum spir. vini, in which infuse Myrrh. If it be great,
stitch it with needles, otherways the dry stitch will serve, dress cum Bals.
Arceivel lucatella, and if it be deep, keep a tent in the depending part,
until it yield laudable quittor, and then take it out, above apply Empl.
Basilic. viz. Empl. Betonic. iiij. gum. elim. in ol. ros. dissol ^. pull. rub.
ros. myrtillor. ana ij Call. Aromat. Angelic. Caryoph. ana j. Cer. q.s.f.
Emplast. If extraordinary, i.e. with a fever, inflammation of the whole head,
neck and shoulders, as also the breast, the brims be swelled, and of livid
color, casting out sharp, virulent and stinking sanies, the party feeling
great and pricking pain; then

First, draw out the malignity by deep scarifications, after apply either
leeches or cups, washing the wound with this, Theriac. Androm. ij. Mithrid. ^.
aq. Card. bened. ij. aq. vitae. Misce, let it be fomented hot, in all your
Medicaments, mix some Theriac. vel Mithri. till symptoms cease, after dress
with ordinary medicines.

Secondly, strengthen the principal parts; as Theriac. Land. Mithrid. ana j.

liviul. and pap. err. ana js. Misce, f. pot. To the heart apply this, aq.
Buglos. meliss. rosar. Cinam. ana js. acet. ros. vj. Croc. j. spec. diamarg.
frig. and laetificant Galleni ana ij. Misce f. Epithema. apply it warm with
double clothes.

Having handled wounds of cutis musculosa and some Fractures, we come to other
Fractures in the Scull.

CHAP. XII. Fractures in the Scul.
IN which observe some common things to all or most Fractures.

Secondly, things special.

For the first observe the signs and presages in Fractures.

For signs, they are taken either from sense or reason.

For sense, if the Fracture be not obvious, its found out either by the
finger, or by a probe, to both which it will feel rugged, but take heed you
take not the Suturs for Fractures.

For rational signs they are taken from diverse things, as if the person was
strong that did it, the instrument great or sharp, falls from on high, its
probable there is a Fracture. If the head was bare, the blow hard, the scull
thin and tender: If singing of the ears fall after the blow, swooning,
slumbering, dazzling of the eyes, bleed at nose, ears, eyes, and mouth,
vomiting, are signs of Fractures; those that follow these are, First, a
constant pain of the part wounded, so that the patient offers often to touch
it. Secondly, vomiting of choler. Thirdly, convulsion. Fourthly, a palsy of
one of the arms and legs. Fifthly, raveing. Sixthly, faultering in the speech.
Seventhly, deafness. Eighthly, imparing of the memory. Ninthly, dullness of the
understanding. Tenthly, weak judgment, hair stand up, cut in the wound.


Presages. Presages.


A fever before the thirteenth day in winter, and seventh in summer, is ill;
the wound livid, little quantity of matter, the skin dry and hard; tongue
black, avoiding unawares excrements, the sick raveing, the tongue pusled,
convulsion on the opposite part, and Apoplexy, is deadly, but if dura matter be
its right color, the flesh be red, the sick moving well his neck and jaws,
are good signs; give no absolute judgment till the hundred days be past; if
at the beginning of the cure the scul be blackish, and the body cacochymicall,
death ensues; Fractures in the Sutures or Temples are dangerous.

With a Wound.

And no fearful sympt. take none of the Cranium away, but dress it with Lt.
Arcei. vel Bal. Lucatel. with a feather, but if a fevor, convulsion, vomiting,
or palsy appear, open and dress it, S. A.

CHAP. XIV. Fractures in persons of ripe age.
IN which the incision is to be made thus, T. or after take up all to cranium
with a chizell or fingers, beginning at the points of the incision; take heed
your Section be not in the Suturs or temporal muscles, or Transverse a little
above the eyelid, keep all open with dorsels and pledgets, armed with
Astrictives, and so rest for twenty four hours, if no remarkable effusion of
blood be feared; the Cranium is to be opened the fourth day, unles ill
symptoms hinder, then the seventh and ninth day; some think the fourteenth
day; but let it be done as speedily as may be; the instruments to be used are,

First, the Raspatories, which are to be used in Fissures and seeds, when the
print of the weapon is narrow.

Second is the Trepan, which apply not upon Suturs, nor places a little above
the eyebrows, lower part of the scull, nor sinciput, nor in children under
seven years. In the use of which,

First, observe to take out the pin when you are come to the second Table.

Secondly, moysten it with oil, and the print with cold water, remove the
blood to see if it be cut equal, and when it begins to shake, lift it up with
a levatory, after which, take away the roughness with a scalper.

Thirdly, Terrebra or Gimlet, it serves for the raising of a depressed part;
first, making a hole in the Cranium with the pin of the Trepan, afterward
scruing it in.

Fourthly, Head-saw, may either be used to give vent in Fract. or to take of
some ragged piece of the Cranium.

After the application of the Trepan, apply a piece of Taffity or Satin, white
or crimson, moystened in Mel. rosar. and spir. vini, till the seventh day, nay
to end of the cure. I have used the same medicine fitly applied with good
success, being careful to foment the part with stuphs, well wrung out of
Sack as hot as may be endured, applying upon the part being fitly dressed,
Emplast. Paracel. betonic. aut Bassilic. and one of your stuphs upon that, and
after roll up the head. Observe that in Fractures of the temples apply the
Trepan above the temporal muscle, using a deterging injection, and a sponge
compressed, which will suck up the matter, after dressing embrocate the parts
adjacent with ol. rosar. chiefly in the neck where the jugular veins are; for
it asswageth pain, and contemperates the heat of the blood. If there happen a
flux of blood upon application of the Trepan or other occasions, apply Gallen
powder, which I found effectual when all other means failed, upon Mr. Timothy
Venner wounded at Rownton Heath near Chester in the head.

CHAP. XV. The Simple.
NOw because Fract. are either Simple or Compound, we begin with the Simple.

The Simple are three:

First fissura, which is either conspicuous, or not, the conspicuous are either
to the second table, or through both which must be dilated as far as it goes,
leaving a passage in the depending part for the matter and blood; that which is
not conspicuous, if you cannot find it by looking through a multiplying
glass, or the patients holding his breath, apply to the part suspicious, ink
made thin with vinegar, and if it leave any print after its made clean the
next day with a wet sponge; then follow it so far as it goes with the
raspatory, which being down, dress as after trepaning.

The second is a seeds, or seat, if it pass through both tables, no splint
hurt the meanynges, and may be made to discharge the matter its sufficient:
dressing it as before, but if the dura matter be offended, or the passage made,
be too narrow, it must be dilated by the raspatory.

The third contusion which happens most frequently to children sometimes with,
sometimes without a wound; the latter of which, with a seeds, I cured in one
John Roberts of five years old at Warwick Castle, only by the application of
Empl. Apodold. though he was troubled with vomiting and other bad symptoms.

CHAP. XVI. Compound Fractures
COmpound Fractures, are also of three sorts:

First, a depression, and in this the shivers are either quite separated, or
cleave to the rest, or both the last; of which I saw and cured a remarkable
one, with sad symptoms in the forehead of a Drummer of Captain Walfords, of
Colonel Bossiviles Regiment, it was long in curing and hard to cicatrise the
loose shivers, I removed and raised the rest, with the levatory, but in case it
cannot be raised by it, you are to use the Trepan as near the Fracture as you
can. The

Second is a vaulting, when the Scull is pulled upwards leaving a cavity
beneath. If it pass no further, then the second table, smooth the scull, and
heal the wound, S. A. If it pass through the second table, you must open the
scull in the depending part with the Trepan, then cure it, ex. L.A.

The third is Excision, i.e. when the part of the scull wounded, is altogether
separate from the whole, the ordering of which is set down p. 121, 122, and
123. as for complicated Fractures, which is when diverse are joined together,
follow the cure as has been prescribed.

In the Sutures there happens a depression, which must be cured as before.

Secondly, a separation, if it be large and ligaments torn though not seen,
there is danger of death.

Thirdly, a Collision is a contusion of the brims of the sutures in the cases
of fearful accidents, as a fever, vomiting, and a convulsion follow, then you
are to apply the Trepan on both or one side, as often as you dress the wounded
person cause him to bend down his head, and stop mouth and nose, laboring to
breath strongly, that so the sanies may be expelled.

CHAP. XVII. Fractures either without a wound; or in the contrary part to the
wound.
THe latter of these are either near the part wounded, or opposite to it.

The Signs of the first are these; Signs.


First, the side of the wound next the Fracture, will not ciccatrise when the
other does. Secondly, from that will an Ichorous and thin matter flow. Thirdly,
more matter then the wound can seem to afford. Fourthly, the flesh near to the
parts spungeous. Fifthly, the part will be feverish. Sixthly, with your probe
you may find the cut separated from the Scull.
7. Some tumor will appear in the part above the Fracture.

For the second a Contrafissura, its twofold; either in the opposite part, or
when the second table is Fractured, and the first remains whole, these are
hard to find, but it may be perceived by these signs.

First, if there be vomiting choler and fever, with other that belong to
Fractures, the party will put his hand often to it; if a Tumor appear, you may
be assured the Fracture is under, if no Tumor appear in the opposite part
then shave it, and apply this, Picis Navalis and Cerae^ana iij. Terebinth. j.
mastic. irid. pull. ana ij. f. Empl. S.A. draw it upon leather, and let it lie
twenty four hours; if after you have taken it away, the Cutis muscul. appear
in any place more moist, soft, and sweld, then the rest, its probable there is
the Fracture. As for this, and the other, the scull must be opened with the
Trepan, and cured, ex. L. A. If such patients dye, Chyrurgions are not to be
blamed.

Now for curing Fractures without wound, when you have perceived there is one
by signs formerly laid down, and no extraordinary symptoms appear:

First, shave the hair, then apply this, F^arin. Hord. aceti, and aq. and f.
Catap. in; winter make it with wine, adding pull. ros. Mastic. bacc. Myrt. and
al. rosar. to purge choler, Caryocost: elect. e succ. rosar. ana ij. sir. de
cicho. cum rhubarb. j. aq. end. ij.f.p.

Thirdly, let blood as often as need requires.

Fourthly, drop ol. Amygd. dull. into the ears and nose, the fourth day use
gangarismes made of Cephalicke herbs, and aq. Hord. mel. ros. and oxym. simp.
the seventh day, apply Emp. Palmar. Slotani cum ol. Rosar. if yet fearful
symptoms appear after the seventh day, open the scull and cure it, S. A.

CHAP. XVIII. Wounds of menynges and brain.
ANd first of dura matter, in which there is always a vehement pain with the
wound, if withal drowsinesse and sleepiness seize upon the patient, death
follows: for cure, if flux of blood, apply Gallen powder, after assuage pain,
cum ol. ros. warm applied, which continue till quittor be procured, after use
equal parts of Mel. rosar. and ol. rosati till digestion, after Incarne, cum
sir. and suc. ros. vel sir. Sanatiu.

The 3. thing is inflammation, then its red with a Tumor, sometimes so big that
it fills the hole in the Cranium, yea above often.

Cure. First, open a vein, use slender diet, Cure.
foment it with a decoct of Althaea sem. lini. faenugr. Groundsell fol. violar.
After apply ol. Ros. Myrtin. vel Cydon. if the Tumor increase open the passage
in the scull wider.

The fourth is a Tumor, if quittor be contained therein, which is discerned by
extraordinary white spots, then warily open it, that you touch not the brain,
then apply Mel. ros. and sir. e sicc. ros.

The fifth is Discoloration. If blackness be from the violence of the
concusion, it lasts but four days; in this case use ol. rosar. Mel. ros. vel
ol. ovor. cum aq. vitae and pull. Cephalic.

If congealed blood has occasioned it, use this, aq. vitae ijs. pull. gran.
Tinctor. ij. Croci ^j. Mel. ros. ijs. sarcocol. iij. lent. Coq. use it till
blackness be gone.

If from improper medicaments, cure it as contusion: If from Putrefaction,
which is discerned by the strong sent of the sanies, use this, aq. vit. js.
sir. absinth. and mel. rosar. ana ij. ung. Aegyptiaci js. Sarcocol. Myrrh.
aloes ana j. vini alb. potent. js. bullia. omnia leniter, Colent. ac serventur
ad usum vel aq. plantag. j. ung. Aegyp. js. merc. praep. j. Misce, after
stirring it apply it warm: If this will not do, but Tumor increase, the eyes
grow fiery, and moving, he toss and rave, its deadly.

CHAP. XIX. Wounds of the Pia matter and brain.
THese of necessity must suffer together, being so adhering each to other; and
though they be accounted deadly, the experience prove they are of curation. The
sign besides such forementioned in Fractures, are foming at the mouth,
darkness of sight, loss of reason, deafness, and palsy, etc.

Concerning the cure Authors require at first dressing for seven days to use
ol. ros. cum ol. Terebinth. mel. ros. and ol. rosar. ana j. aq. vit. ij. but
two eminent ones was only cured with mel. rosar. and spir. vini: one I saw at
Worcester after the battle of Poicke, the other I cured at Warwick, of which
Mr. William Thorpe, my Mr. had a fight for the rest of the medicaments, with
which they were dressed, was Emp. Paracel. and stuff wrung out of Sack with
fitting rouling.

CHAP. XX. Concussion.
NOw the accidents of the brain are diverse; the first is Concussion.

Its, if vehement, often deadly, always dangerous, deadly, as I observed in
one Mr. Symons, the Gentleman of the Ordinance in Warwick Castle, who going
forth to kill a Rabit, and having done it, was assaulted by the Keeper and his
man, the one of which with a blow struck him down without any remarkable
wound or fracture at all, and notwithstanding all methodicall means used, he
dyed. For the cure, its to be dressed, as in Fractures without wounds, bleeding
not to be neglected, clysters to be used, and purges fitting exhibited, anoint
the whole head, cum ol. rosar. and apply either Vigoes Corot. or Empl.
basilicon.

CHAP. XXI. Fungus.
ITs a Tumor sometimes hard without blood and small sense, otherwhiles soft of
exquisite sense, and an ill smell, beneath narrow, and above broad, and
sometimes increases to the bigness of a hens egg.

Cure. First, Cure.
use glysters ( Hildanus used a bag of Cephalicke herbs with water and red
wine decocted) and after apply this powder, rad. Caryoph. Angel Call. Aromat.
ana s. rad. Aristol. rotund. Iridis Guaiac. ana ij. salu. rorismar. major. ana
j. f. ex omnibus pull. or this, Sabini. ij. ocrae. j.f. pull. or Turb. flau. If
it grow to the bigness of an egg, bind it with silk at the root, and when
its fallen away, strew the former powders.

For a Tumor proceeding from flatuosity, use the method in Fungus, and apply
Emp. Basilic. upon it.

CHAP. XXII. Wounds of the eye lids.
FIrst, stitch them (especially if they be made transverse) after either use
this, bol. Arm. Ter. sig. ana ij. sang. dracon. sarcocol. ana j. and f. pull.
strew it upon the wound, or use Bals. Artificial. or Lt. Arcei Empl. Palmar. if
there be less of substance, be not too hasty to cicatrise, if the eye lid
will not come down, then you are to divide the cicatrise like a half moon and
cure it up again. Remember defensitives are to be used about the eye, lest
blindness follow, as also convenient ligatures.

As for those in the eye, Mr. Woodalls course is excellent, i.e. apply Hyperic.
upon the eye lid, and Emp. Paracels. laying upon the neighboring part frog
water, with cheese curds and rosewater, let both the eyes be rouled up: Here
general evacuation is not to be neglected, as purging and bleeding, as also
cups and glysters.

CHAP. XXIII. Wound of the lips.
IF they pierce not through, cure them as ordinary wounds if they do, cure
them as a hair lip; First, peircing the brimmes of the wound with a needle,
having on both sides a thin small piece of lead, after tw^^ the silk about the
end of the needle, then snip off the ends; this is to be done in the midst of
the wound, and at either end use an ordinary stitch, to these may be added the
dry stitch, especially to children, to the wound apply Bals. Artific.

CHAP. XXIV. Wounds of the Ears.
THese are either wholly cut off, or else in part divided; if cut off, apply
pull. Cephalic. and ung. de minio cum Empl. Paracel. and let the hair cover the
deformity, if only divided and small, use dry stitch, if great, use the needle
taking only hold of the skin on each side the ear, keep a tent in it.

CHAP. XXV. Wounds of the Nose.
IF only in the soft part, dry stitch will serve, to which apply unguent alb.
Camph. If the hard part, its either above in the bone, and then there is a
Fracture, or below in the Cartilage; if a Fracture, put into the nose fit
pieces of wood lapped in linen, and then reduce the bone, after put in small
pipes a little sharp above, and flat below, yet not too high, let these be
fastened by strings to the cap on each side. For the wound bring it together,
either by dry stitch or needle, and apply bol. Mastic. sang. drac. alum. usti
and alb. ovi, using fitting ligatures.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the Tongue.

parts and causes the party to breath easy.

CHAP. XXIX. Of the Oesophagus.
THe signs are difficulty of breathing, and swallowing, Hicket, vomiting of
choler, meat and drink, and if deep, the meat comes out. If it be wholly
divided, the cure is impossible, if near the mouth of the stomach, great and
transverse, its so also. If otherwise, first, stitch it, leaving an orifice in
the depending part, and cure it, as in Trach. Art. using after ordinary glyst.
without oil and sugar, nutritive ones, and a special diet.

CHAP. XXX. De Spinali Medul.
THe signs, palsy, convulsion, feeling lost, not being able to retain seed,
urin or excrements, sometimes a total suppression of them.

No less dangerous then the brain, if in the beginning, or wholly divided,
death ensues.

Cure. Cure.
If the wound pierce not to the Medul. its only in the muscles, and so dress
it as wound in fleshy parts, or in the bones also, and then dress as in the
head. If in part divided, then first pour in this, ol. Hyper. and de vitel.

CHAP. XXXI. De Thorace.
THese either penetrate or not, if they do, they have these signs, the mouth
and nose, being stopped, breath will break through with a noise, so that it
will move the light of a candle. If penetrating, they offend other parts, we
may know by those proper signs as if the

Heart.

Much blood gusheth out, an universal trembling, the pulse small and weak,
cold, sweat often swooning, and when the limbs grow cold, death is near.

Of the Lungs.

The blood is yellowish and frothy, cough insueth, difficulty of breathing,
pain in the wounded side, yet lying upon it, is at more ease, hard to cure.

Of the Midrife.

Having in the part raveing, breathing difficult, cough, sharp pain, a fever,
sometimes by vehemence of breathing, the guts and stomach is drawn into the
cavity of the breast through the wound. Its deadly.

Of the Vessels.

If the blood be powered into the cavity of the breast, breath difficult,
fever increasing, vomiting blood, afterward the breath will stink, appetite
lost, desire to sit up, fainting, it causes death.

Thus you have the Signs and Progn. Cure.
now we come to the Cure.

Of penetrating wound in the breast.

First, the patient is to be laid in naked bed with the wound downward that by
couching and holding his breath, the matter may be discharged till things be
ready, if he find no weight upon the diaphragma, nor fever or spitting blood,
use no tents but drop in Lt. Arcei, or Artificial Balsome, and upon it Diapal.
but if there be much blood in the cavity, after the blood is got out, use a
flammula dipped in the white of an egg, the greater part of it hanging forth
of the wound, this may continue for forty days, if former symptoms still
remain, instead of the flam. you may use a silver pipe, which, when the wound
runs, matter good and little, is to be taken forth; for injection, if you
have a mind to use any (for I have cured dangerous penetrating wounds without)
receive this, Ptisa. iiij. sac. rub. ij Mel. ros. j. Misce. This being cast in,
let him betake him to his former posture that it may all come forth; upon your
pipe apply a sponge wrung forth of aq. vitae, it does keep out the air, and
extract the quittor instead of the sponge, this Empl. is excellent, Resin. pini

Fractures.

SECT. IV. CHAP. I. Fractures.
WHich is a solution in the head, parts, and deprehended by sense, the causes
are the too violent assaults and strokes of all external things; the maine
differences are four, Long; Transverse; Oblique, and Shattered.

The Signs are inequallity, Signs.
as also feeling and hearing, a noise in the handling of the part, as also
pain.

Prog. Prognost.
In old persons, choleric, near the joints, head, of bones, oblique,
shattered, and with wounds and other great symptoms are hard to cure. In young
persons the middle of bones and transverse are easy.

Cure. Cure.
In which observe four things: First, restore the bones. Secondly, keep them
together. Thirdly, if wound or contusion be joined, look to it. Fourthly,
prevent or remove the symptoms.


Having all things in readiness, first, let two persons make extension by
little and little, yet strongly, that being sufficiently done, reduce the bone
to its natural situation; premising, you defer in case there be
inflammation, till it be past.

Secondly, for the keeping it, to gather up no roulers at all, only clouts,
splints armed with tow or paste-board and junckes made of straw or bents, with
caps and fillets; for in simple fractures, the right placing of the bones, and
keeping them so, is most part of the cure, rest also exceedingly conducing
thereto: for medicaments they are either outward or inward; for the first use a
plaster made of bole, fine flower, white of eggs, ol. of roses, and a little
camphire, or Cerae iij. resin. adip. ovin. ana j. f. Cerat. Emp. diapal. or de

osteocollae pp. vj. Misce lento igne cum modic. ol. ros. f. Empl. These
medicaments are to be applied three fingers above, and so much coming below
the Fracture. For inward means;

Use a thin diet every day or two, procuring a stool by clyster or
suppository; if a fever happen, use cooling julips; if that serve not, open a
vein on the contrary side. If it be needful for the procuring of the callus,
use this lap. ossifragi diligenter praepar. j. Cinam. electi iij. sacc. ij. f.
pull. subtiliss. dos. ij. in broth every morning fasting, two hours after. This
may be administered to children, and old, not to youth.

The member being bound up and situated, S. A. let it so remain till the third
day, unless symptoms hinder; in simple fractures it may continue till the
seventh, after that you may forbear, if nothing hinder; six or ten days, ever
being careful to resist accidents, you may know the bone to be well set;
first, if pain be assuaged. Secondly, if to your seeling it be not rugged or
bunchy. Thirdly, if it answer in length and thickness to the opposite sound
part. Be sure to view it often, being subject to fall out by inconsiderate
turnings and convulsive twitchings, which will be known by renewing of the
pain, and inequality in the part.

Thirdly, if therewith, a wound be joined you must so order it as that there
may be way for dressing of it, and yet care taken the part be kept steady;
which may be done by a strong cloth three or four times double, which may
once compass the part and the edges thereof overmeeting at the wound, and upon
it convenient splints, tied on with filliting with a wooden or iron case for
the part. Let the wound be dressed with lin. arcei, vel sir. e sicc. ros.
Terebinth. ana ij. pull. rad. irios, aloes, mastic. farin. Hord. ana s.
incorpor. and f. unguent. If the bone be foul, this will serve; otherwise,
you may have recourse where its more largely handled in ulcers. For their drink
aq. Coct. lb vj. sacc. iiij. succ. lim. j. Cinam. ij. Misce. The time of
consolidation is uncertain, for the most part the thigh requires forty or
fifty days, the arm thirty or forty.

Fourthly, for accidents, if there be a phlegmon, contused or gangreen, cure
them as in the proper Chapter; if heat, excoriations and itchings, use unguent.
Tripharmac. spread upon paper.

Thus much for Fractures in general, only observe first, the binding of the
part; if it be too hard, besides the patients complaint, there will be a hard
tumor about the part, if well, a soft tumor, if too loose, none at all.

Secondly, if on the third day, or after, the ligatures seem loose, its a good
sign.

Thirdly, if the fractured bone stand forth in any part, it must be there more
straightly pressed with boulsters and splints.

And lastly, after the seventh day, bind the part more strait; for then
symptoms are usually past.

Having delivered general notions, we come to particular observations
necessary to be known, in fractures of several parts: premising what has been
said in the general, may serve for Fractures in the arms, legs, and thighs,
the last of which requires the more care, in as much as the bone naturally of
it self is bowing; Fractures in the Cranium, and the nose have also been
already handled. We now come to them in the Jaws.

CHAP. II. The Jaws.
WHich is restored by putting your finger into the patients mouth, pressing
them on the inside, and out, till they be smoothly reduced in, which if it be
necessary, use some extension; if the teeth be shaken forth, put them into
their right places, tying them to the sound with a thread. The splints applied
are to be of sole leather, being divided at the chin, let the ligature be two
fingers broad with four ends, two being fastened to the crown of the cap, the
other to the same in the nape of the neck, you may know its well set by the
order of the teeth, feed upon liquid things; its united sometimes in twenty
days.

CHAP. III. Of the Collar bones.
THese are restored three ways: The first, is to draw the arm backward, and
shoulder forward, and the Chyrurgion with his hand restoring them.

Secondly, to put a clew of thread into the arm pits, and press the arm unto
the ribs, and so reduce them.

Thirdly, lay him upon his back, with a Tray under his shoulder with the
bottom upward, pressing down the shoulder till the end of the bones lying hid
fly out. I have done successefully by setting the patient low, and causing one
to set his knee against the shoulder, pulling it toward them, and so have set
them. Here observe, as also in Fractures of the ribs; if any splints of bones
cause pain with difficulty of breathing, then open the part and take them
forth. Here boulsters with splints, and good rouling is to be used, three
boulsters are necessary, one on each side, the third and thickest upon the
fracture. The rouler must be a hand breadth, and two else and a half long, and
is to run cross ways; the callus grows in twenty days.

CHAP. IV. Of the Shoulder blades.
THese may be fractured in the ridge, broad parts, as also in the Articulation.
Its known by a painful inequallity, perceived by feeling. If the broader or
thinner part be fractured, there is a cavity and pricking pain in that part,
and numnesse troubles the arm, if the fragments prick not, restore them, if
they do cause ill symptoms, open and take them out, and cure it, S. A.

Observe, if a Fracture happen in the Articulation, there is scarce any hope of
recovery.

CHAP. V. Of the Breast bone.
THis is sometimes fractured, otherwhiles depressed, the Fracture is perceived
by inequallity, and going in with noise at the thrust of the finger, spitting
of blood, difficulty of breathing and cough argue both. To reduce either, the
course is to be taken as in the collar bones, the Chyrurgion pressing the, ribs
on both sides, and set the bone with his hand; upon the part fitting medicines
to assuage pain, and hinder inflammation, with fit boulsters and ligatures;
this being near a noble part, is dangerous.

CHAP. VI. Of the Ribs.
WHich is either inward or outward; the first is deadly, causing a more
grievous pain then in the plurisie, and is increased after eating: the latter
is easily discerned by the inequallity and noise upon touching. The restoring
of them, if inwardly is, Let the patient lie on the sound side, and to the
fractured part apply this; Farin. Tritie.. Ie^byocoll. diss^l. in aq. feabios.

till he shall find himself better, and breath more easily. But if pricking
pain continue, you must make incision and take out the fragments that torment,
and cure it S. A. observing that a fit diet be prescribed, bleeding and purging
be used If it may be done without intision, then anoint the whole side, cum ol.

easily cured; if upon either a Muscous tumor happen, which may be perceived by
pressing, by no means neglect it, but if you can, resolve it by proper
medicaments. If it degenerate into an abscesse open it speedily, lest the
matter corrupt the bone, and so cure it; otherwise there happens consumption
and death.

CHAP. VII. Of the Backbone.
SOmetimes they are broken, other while bruised or strained on the inside,
which causes many malign symptoms, as palsy, etc. and after death. In this,
you must make incision, and pull forth the officles that offend; if you cannot
do this you are to apply Topics, ass waging pain and hindering inflammation;
If only the process be broken; if incision be not required, reduce them, and
so are they easily cured. After the same manner is restored, os sacrum or holy
bone.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Rumpe-bone.
THese are to be set by putting your finger into the patients fundament, and
so thrusting it to the fractured place. By this means the fragments may be set
in order, your other hand lying upon his back, the patient must keep his bed
all the time of the cure, and if he sit, it must be in a perforated seat.

CHAP. IX. Of the Hip.

cavity, and numnesse of the leg on the same side. If the splints of the bone
be quite off, they must at the first by incision be taken away, having a care
you hurt not the head of the muscles or vessels, If they be not broken off,
reduce them smoothly and proceed S. A. For the Whirlebone of the Knee.

CHAP. X. The Whirlebone of the Knee.
After reduction, the leg is to be kept in a straight posture, that so the
Knee may not be bowed, and fit medicaments ligat. and boulsters be applied.

CHAP. XI. The bones of the hands and feet.
BEing fractured, are to be restored by laying and setting them upon a smooth
table, and being extended, then reduced, only observe they are very painful
and require Anodyns, and the hand must after setting, always have in it a
Tenis-ball kept, left it lose the most fitting figure for the patients use and
benefit.

One thing observe, if upon a fracture you fear a gangreen, then instead of
your former prescribed medicaments, use clothes diot in a good lixivium,
wherein is boiled vulnerary herbs, as also for a time foment the part
therewith.

SECT. V. CHAP. I. Dislocations.
WE are now arrived at the last branch of solution in the hard part, Defin.
in which we shall follow this method; First, what it is, viz. Its the going
out of the bone from its proper cavity, and so hindering voluntary motion.

Secondly, Causes.
the Causes which are either 1. Internal, as excrementitious humors and
flatulencies, which I have seen in diverse. Secondly, external falls, strokes,
slippings, etc. to these adds Pareus a third, which is hereditary, and not
improbable.

Thirdly, Difer.
the differences are First complete, when altogether forth. Secondly, when not
altogether. Thirdly, when only distorted. The first of these are fourefold,
forward, backward, outward, inward; these again are either simple or compound.

Fourthly, Signs.
the Signs are a Tumor in the part whither its fain, and hollownesse in the
place from whence its come, also pain and privation of motion.

Fifthly Prognostics, in children, Prognost.
and those that are young, and simple, easy, but hard if compound, painful,
inflamed, if long forth, and the part be extenuated.

Sixthly the Cure, Cure.
in general; observe first, extension is to be made till there be free space
betwixt the dislocated bones, yet in some cases this is not needful, as you
shall see in the shoulder.

Secondly, force it into its proper seat, which is known by a popping noise,
ease of pain, and likeness of parts, these are all necessary in some joints.

Thirdly, apply fit medicines (yet note simple luxations need no applications
or ligations, but are happily cured without, as by experience I have found,
besides the constant practice of Mr. Hailes in Northamptonshire, who in his
time was most eminent and successful in his practice, with whom I had much
familiarity, by reason of a Cancer he had in his tongue, and chin.) If any be
necessary, such as are in Fractures may be applied.

Fourthly, use ligations.

And fifthly, keep it in a sitting posture; but these need not unless the
luxation be compounded.

Lastly, remove symptoms, as pain and inflammation, only observing that if
these happen together before setting, let it alone till they be removed, as in
the Treatise of Fractures. If it be old, then discussive fomentations must be
frequently used, and after this Catap. (having made gentle motion up and down,
too and again) rad. Althaeae vj Cucum. asin. iij. fol. malu. Althaeae ana Mij.

vj. lilior. ij. Misce, f. Carapl. and so with fit boulsters and ligatures, let
it be bound up conveniently. Yet after all this, when its performed, you will
find the motion of the part little or none, as I have observed.

Thus having done with generals, which must be both in Fractures and
dislocations, as far as is necessary carried to the particulars, we come to
them: and first of luxation in the Jaw Bone.

CHAP. II. In the Jaw Bone.
THis is either on one side or both, which if not speedily set, may procure
death. If only on one side the chin is drawn aside. If both, it hangs forward
toward the breast. To set them, put your thumbs lapped in linen into the
mouth, and with them press hard down the great teeth, and lift up the jaw
with your finger underneath. Thus I restored an old woman, which came by
yawning. Others put wedges of hassill or fur a finger thick, casting a band
about the chin, stand behind the patient, and draw the chin toward them, and
at the same time press down the wedges. After this, apply medicaments, if
necessary, as also ligatures; for diet use liquid things.

CHAP. III. Collar bones.
ITs hard to be known, and as hard to be cured, as also easy to be mistaken;
they may be dislocated, inward, outward, and side ways. The restoring of them,
is either by moving and extending the arm, or as is set down in the Fractures
of the same.

CHAP. IV. Of the Spondyls or Vertebra.
IF it be of the first next the head, in which the chin is fastened to the
neck, death follows, for those under all along are dangerous, and may be
either strained or luxated, and that to both sides, outward, and inward; the
last most dangerous. If above the neck there will be a great pain, difficulty
of breathing, and face look black, to restore which, the patient being set
low, let one lie with all his weight upon his shoulders, and the Chyrurgion
taking his head about his ears betwixt his hands, and so shake and move it to
every part till it be restored. Which being done, the pain will suddenly
cease, and they be freely able to turn and move their neck; if it be below
the neck, and inward, Mr. Hailes cured one thus; He took the party by both
hands, and cast them over his shoulder, and with his back parts gave a sudden
jerke, bending forwards, and so reduced it. If it be outwardly, lay them upon a
table with their face downward, having bound them about the flanckes with long
towels, as also under the armpits, then make extension without violence, and
with your hands laid upon the extuberation, force it in, taking care you hurt
not the processes: As for that from an inward cause, its absolutely uncurable,
unless they be done at first with great care and diligence, Hildanus says, if
the luxation be complete, its deadly.

CHAP. V. Of the Rumpe.
WHich being, dislocated, causes such an impotency in the leg, that he cannot
bring his heel to his buttockes, nor bend his knee, unless with great force.
The cure is performed as in a Fracture in the same part.

CHAP. VI. Of the Ribs.
IT causes if inward, difficulty of breathing, pain in bowing down, or
lifting up the body. To deliver from which the dislocation is speedily to be
restored, and if the rib fall on the upper part of the Vertebra, the patient
must hang with his arms upon some high door, and then the rib is to be
depressed down into its cavity; if it fall down on the lower part of the
Vertebra, the patient is to bend downward, setting his hand upon his knees, and
then press it in. If it be inward, its supposed incurable in these, as also in
the Vertebra's is to be used besides Empl. fomentations; as salu. Althaeae
stor. Cham. Melilot. and Hyperic. ana Mj. Coq. pro fom. after this anoint the
part cum l. Lumbric. irin. lilior. ana ij. dialthaeae. ung. Agrip. s. Misce.

CAHP. VII. Of the Shoulder.
FOr the restoring of which diverse ways are used, that which most commonly was
practiced by Mr. Hailes (whether dislocated inward, outward, or side-waies) was
this, he took the patients hand, and laid it in his neck, after with the right
hand pressed his arm close to the ribs, and after suddenly thrust the elbow
upward. This I have used, and as he, so I never failed. Some others, if inward,
do it upon a door, ladder or coulestaffe, upon two men's shoulders, in these
the patient is to be held by the arm, the head of the bone rightly placed on
the instrument, and he standing upon a stool is to be cast.

Of the Elbow.

This is hard to be reduced, unless speedily effected, whether it be backward,
or forward, or sidewayes, its to be set by setting the part into which the bone
is fallen upon your arm, and so endeavor to bend the arm; by which its
reduced, as also the wrist; this was the practice also of Mr. Hailes, but for
the wrist some take by the hand near the joint, the arm being held and so move
the hand upwards and downwards, or sidewaies till it be restored, this I have
practiced.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Thigh or Hip.
IF it be dislocated inward, the share and groines sweat* the buttocks are
wrinkled, they cannot extend the leg without pain, nor stand upon their toes,
their urin is suppressed. Cure.
For the restoring of which, lay the patient upon a bench or table, in the
midst of which, let there be a pin of wood pretty thick which must be lapped
with linen clothes; the patient is so to be situated that this pin be
between his legs near the head of the luxated bone, and after make extension
and force in the head of the bone to its place. Others use ligatures, by which
making extension, having a round thing in the groyne, they speedily with
violence bring in the patients knee, with leg inwards to the other, and so
force it to its cavity.

If outward.

This is easily perceived, and if new, as easily reduced, by laying the party
upon his face, and pressing it down with your hands into the right place.

If forward.

The patient is to be laid on his sound side, and by ligature just extension
being made with the hand, force in the bone.

If backward.

It must be reduced with extension after the same manner as when outward.
Observe that all dislocations of the thigh which are old, are hardly or never
reduced, and after all reducings of it, let there be rest commanded, it being
bound up, lest it recidivate.

CHAP. IX. Of the Whirle-bone.
IT may be dislocated upward, downward, or side-wayes, its to be restored to
its place by the hand, Cure.
the patient firmly standing, and so after medicines applied, let it, with
fitting boulsters, filling the ham, and ligatures, be bound up, and a case made
to strengthen it, and so command rest as long as is convenient. Which being
done, let the knee by little and little be bowed till it come to its proper
motion, to it apply Emp. Paracel.

CHAP. X. Of the Knees.
THey may be dislocated inward, outward, and backward, seldom or never
forward, you may know them by the debility of the joint, and he cannot bring
his heel to touch his buttocke; for the two first, after due extension enforce
them into their places; for the third, take the patients leg between yours, he
fitting upon a low stool, and so bring his leg forceably toward his buttocke;
if the last happen, lay him upon a table with his face upward, and force in the
bone.

For the dislocation of the fociles, heel, and ankles; what has been said may
serve, only symptoms are to be specially eyed, the bones of the hand,
singers, feet, and toes are to be reduced, as is set down in Fractures.

Thus having done with luxations; we come to some rare symptoms which happen
after both Fractures and Dislocations; as first, Atrophia or wasting of the
part.

CHAP. XI. Atrophia or wasting of the part.
ITs occasioned either by idleness of the part, too hard ligature, or as
Hildanus; by Tumor possessing a joint. If by too hard ligature, loose it. For
the first, use Frications for half an hour, and then anoint it, cum ol.

fifteen days; after for as long, ol. Catellor. lumb. ana ij. ol. Amygd. iij.

suspect the original of the nerves to be obstructed, then use strong
resolvers, as may be seen in palsy upon a wound; as for the last, Hild. used
first purging by phlegmagogues, after using the like decoct. and ointments, as
before. Note if by these means the part grow red, there is hope. Some apply
dropax. I cured one by frications, bleeding on the same arm, and unguent.

Thus having done with solution in hard parts, we shall put an end to the first
part of Chyrurgery by handling Combustions, Ecchymosis, and Gangreens, the
second frequently following Contusions, and the last may happen upon all
solutions.

CHAP. XIII. Burnings or scalds.
FOr the causes and signs they are obvious, the difference is only in the
quantity. Prognost.
The Prognostics are these: If it be small, and a body of good constitution,
its easy. If deep to the veins and Arteries in an impure body, and be in the
groynes, belly, eyes, and parts of the head, and in children, hard, if in the
intestines, death.

ITs an effusion of blood under the skin, and causes blacknes, it being caused

tend to a gangreen, cure as follows. Observe in all contusions of the joints,
Catap. are better then ointments.

CHAP. XV. Gangreen.
ITs a beginning or partial mortification of the soft part, the causes as you
have heard may be all sorts of solution, especially after wounds made by
gunshot, and great contusions, etc. But besides there are internal causes, as
from excess, or malignity of humors, as also cold, etc.

Signs. Signs.
If from inflammation, there is pain and pulsation, with a sudden changing of
fiery red, into livid and black, which being pressed returns not. If from
cold, a sharp, pricking, burning pain, and shining redness, seiseth suddenly
upon the part, after it turns livid, there is also a coldness and numnesse,
and as if shook with a quartane Ague. If from hard binding; its known by the
hardness of the part, little pimples and blisters rise upon the skin. If from
bits and punctures. Signs are as inflammation, and observe there may be
motion, though there be a gangreen, nay a mortification, if the heads of the
muscles be not affected.

Prognostics. Prognost.
If the malignity be not speedily withstood the part will perish, and will
also infect the ad^acent parts, and the rather, if the humor first take hold on
the bones, and inflammation proceeds from them, they are incurable frequently:
but if the muscles and nerves be not hurt the person young, and of good
constitution being well handled in the beginning it may be cured. If from an
afflux of venomous humors or of occult quality or abundance, as also in bodies
affected with a dropsy, hardly cured.

Cure Internal. First, Cure.
prescribe a convenient diet, cold and dry.

Secondly, if plethoricke, let blood, and purge.

Thirdly, use cordialls to strengthen internal parts against putrid vapors,

Secondly, revell or derive the humors from the part affected by cups, leeches,

Thirdly, bring the part to its natural temper by evacuating the blood, and
other humors in it incompacted. If little by scarification; if much by

cups, but rather leeches; after apply with stuphs, if the affect be

to gangreen. Here might be handled gangreens produced from various causes; but
its needless, if we consider the maine intention, which is to separate the
dead from the living, and hindering further progress. Besides, most Authors
are silent therein. Hildanus herein has done excellently, and some of his
imitators. I shall therefore conclude with one observation of Riverius, which
is this, being called to one, who through the ill opening of a vein, had a
gangreen possessed his arm, and ordinary means used, and yet not effectual;
he caused the scarification formerly made to be humected with spir. sulphur.
which cauterised the mortified flesh, after he fomented the whole part with
Spirit of wine, in which the powder of Aloes and myrrh had been infused; this
was applied very hot, then in great quantity he strewed the part affected with
the powder of myrrh and aloes, and upon it clothes dipped in the foresaid spir.
vini. In some hours by these, the arm in a miraculous manner came to its
native color, the tumor assuaged, the gangreen stayed, so that the next day
the mortified flesh separated from the living; after which, he applied a
digestive of the yolks of eggs, turpentine, and honey, and after proceeded
according to Art. If the means prescribed will not prevail, dismembring must
be used. But this belonging to the third part of Chyrurgery, we for present
shall wave it. And having run through the first Part, we come to the second
Part of Chyrurgery.

CHAP. I. The Second Part of CHYRURGERY.
WHICH is to separate parts unnaturally joined these being few, we shall for
brevities sake pass over general notions which might be premised, and come to
the particular operations, wherein may be observed what in the general is
omitted, only they are such as are received in the womb, or else accidental
after wound and ulcers, not carefully dressed. As after a wound in the eyelids
received at the siege of Banbury, which being not Art-like dressed, the
eyelids conglutinated, and so he delivered up as hopeless of his sight
recovery. But removing to Warwick to me, I dividing them, he presently
received that which he supposed lost, and so was cured S.A.

Sometimes also the eyelid may grow to the white which must be divided, care
taken you cut not the white, therefore put in your probe (being small and
smooth) betwixt the white and the lid, and so divide it with a crooked incision
knife, after which, use the white of an egg, with some rose water beaten
together, and applied upon a small pledget, which may hinder agglutination
again: as also it will be necessary, the Patient be often turning it up. Here
also fitting Collyrium is to be used, which you may find set down in the
effects of the eyes.

Gums.

And here the dividing of the Gums in children may be handled, which though it
cannot be called an unnatural union by reason of natures design, and so
generally happens to all; yet when that design comes to its period, and nature
endeavors to thrust out the teeth, and the gums, from some cause hinders to
the endangering of the life of the creature, then in some sense they may be
looked on, at least as continuing unnaturally joined, and speedy help to be
administered. Which is by dividing the gums with an incision knife, or a piece
of gold, in those places where the teeth bunch out with a little swelling; but
this must be done in time before mortal accidents, as consumption of the
body, and convulsion; by this means many may be preserved, which otherwise
may perish.

CHAP. II. Ancyloglossis, or tongue-tied, or Contraction.
ANd this as Horstius says, may either be by the default of the forming
faculty, or else accidental as in fevers. In children it hinders sucking or
speaking, and in men when accidental, it hinders volubility of speech, and a
right pronunciation. You may perceive it in either by the shortness of the
nervous ligament, which draws the end of the tongue inward. For the cure of the
first, the ligament must be divided broad ways (taking heed of the veins and
Arteries) in two or three places, and after by the Nurses finger dipped in Mel.
ros. often lifted up. If it grow together again, as it often happens, divide
it.

Sometimes you cannot effect this operation without great danger, then its most
safe to pass through a needle and thread, which tie daily straiter, till it be
broken; if by accident, as in fevers, then use things humecting and
mollifying, which is Horstius counsel in his Decads 4. Quest. 1.

CHAP. III. Ears.
THe passages of which may be unnaturally obstructed, and must be divided, the
membranes obstructing, are either external and obvious, or internal, and
scarce to be seen; the first may easily be divided, and afterward cicatrising
medicines lapped about a pipe applied. The second is dangerous, and is rather to
be eaten away by eroding medicaments, taking special care of the drum of the
ear.

CHAP. IV. Neck distorted.
THis happens most frequently in children from a defluxion, Cause.
arising from a cold and moist distemper of the brain, which falling into the
neck, Sign.
sometimes produces a great tumor, after which, a contraction and distortion.
If taken in time, Prog.
it may be cured, otherwise scarce perfectly.

The offending matter is to be evacuated, either with pills according to the
age and strength of the patient, as if in children very young, pull. Arthritic.
g. xv. Caryophyl. N. 1. cum aq. betonic. f. pil. or pil. Catholic. g. viij. vel
x. or pil. ex alo. ros. or mercu. dull. g. vj. diagrid. g. iiij. fol. Auri N. 1.
or a proper Apozeme. The pills may be administered every third or fourth day,
the Apozeme daily. In those that are elder the doses may be increased. Cure.
Also there may be used pil. Coch. vel de Agaric. Mesue. particular
evacuations are to be masticatories and Errhins, a Fontinell in the arm or
Coronall suture is good.

For Topics to the head, use lixivi. of Cephalicke herbs. Cephalicke powders,
proper Emplaisters, as Ceroneum. To the neck is to be used Emollient
fomentations, made of Mallows, Althaea, etc. Also unguents, Cataplas. or
Emplas. of the same property, as ung. dialth. ol. lumbricor. vulpini, Empl. de
Mucilag. Ciculae, etc. The flux being stayed, and the part affected
sufficiently mollified, boulster and a fit instrument is to be used, by which
the wrynesse may be amended. Some for this use cutting, of which operation I am
ignorant, yet know diverse have undergone it three or four times, with little
or no advantage.

CHAP. V. The Yard.
HEre are diverse affects to be handled, as first, the foreskin may stick to
the nut or glans, and then you are to divide it (as has been set down in the
eyelid sticking to the white) after with fit medicaments cured; but note, that
if it grow to in all places, its not to be meddled with.

Secondly, the glans may not be perforated, which is to be opened with a
lancet, and a small leaden pipe kept in till it be well.

Thirdly, its not rightly perforated, but only has a small hole near the
fraenum or ligament of the yard, so that the urin passes not in a right line,
neither can they procreate.

In this case extend the prepuce with the left hand, and divide the glans to
the hole, and use a pipe.

Fourthly, if its very little, the passage in children, in this rather use an
elderne pith compressed and anointed cum ung rosac. then incision.

And lastly, the fraenum or bridle may be too short, in which also the urin
and semen cannot come forth direct. This is to be divided with much dexterity,
and the wound cured, as others in the part.

CHAP. VI. Vulva.
IT may be shut up either by a membrane obvious, or else by the Hymen; the
first may be safely divided, the other is carefully to be performed. To this
end an instrument is to be used to dilate the vulva that your work may be
discerned, and so done, taking heed that you hurt not the parts with your
knife, after division, apply turunds dipped in the white of an egg and rose
water, as also clothes doubled dipped in the same, afterward symptoms being
assuaged, use a leaden pipe of sufficient bigness, length and thickness,
anointed cum unguent. diapompholygos. If it happen that by a wound or ulcer,
its joined, then after binding of them; (as for the stone) divide it, and cure
it as aforesaid.

CHAP. VII. The Fundament.
THis also may be unperforated in children, which is carefully to be divided a
little, and after dilated with speculum any, lest you hurt the sphincter
muscle, after division, use a leaden pipe anointed with some discussive unguent.

CHAP. VIII. Fingers and Toes.
THese may be so either from the womb, or after by accident as upon wounds,
especially burns, unless the former be joined by nerves, tendons and
vessels, let them, as also those by accident be divided. After with some
restrictive powder cast on to stay bleeding, apply this, the white of eggs
mixed with rose and Plantaine water, with oil of roses; to the wrist apply a
defensitive, and anoint the whole arm and hand, as also leg and foot with
ol. ros myr^illor and lumbricorum, and so roll it up. The second day, use this
digestive, Terebinth. lot. in aq. ros. and plantag. ^. ol. ros. and vitel.
ovor. ana ij. Croci s. vitel. ov. Nj. Misce, after incarne and cicatrise, S.A.
And observe that in all these operations, if necessity requires, use fitting
general evacuations. Having briefly passed over the second Part, we come to
the third Part of Chyrurgery.

SECT. I. CHAP. I. The Third Part of CHYRURGERY.
WHich is to remove things superfluous. And these are so either by their own
nature or by event; the latter are diverse: As first, a dead child detained too
long in the womb, to the endangering of the mothers life.

Secondly, the falling of the small guts into the Scrotum.

Thirdly, the amputation of a member.

Fourthly, the extirpation of any part, as the breast.

Fifthly, blood offending either in quantity or quality.

Those that are so by nature, are either somewhat familiar to nature, or
altogether adverse. Of the first sort, are first strumas and wens. Secondly,
Cataracts, those adverse to nature, are stones in sundry parts of the bodies:
of all which in order as briefly and methodically as we are able; observing
that under the former general heads, diverse particulars are contained. We
shall begin with things so by event; And

First, of the extraction of children dead or alive, also a Mole and Secundine,
whereunto we shall add the manner of bringing women to bed artificially and
safely with ease: as also the Cesarean birth, and lastly, cast in the cure of
some symptoms, which may happen upon some of these.

CHAP. II. Children dead or alive.
WE shall put the two first together, because a living child, if the body be
of too great a magnitude, or any part have extraordinary tumefaction, as
Hydrocephalos, etc. its the same way to be performed upon this account that one
may be saved. We shall not need to give the signs of a child living, because
manifest; those of a dead, are these:

If neither the Chyrurgions hand, Signs.
nor the mothers can perceive it move. If the water and secundine come forth,
its certainly dead. Again its more heavy in the womb, and falls that way the
mother inclines, great pain from the privities to the navell, with a
perpetual desire to make water, and go to stool, her privities are cold, and
from her womb filthy excrements are avoided, and her belly swells.

It being known, Prognost.
make speed to save the mother if her strength be good. But if not, which is
known by the smalnesse of her pulse, by her small, seldom, and cold
breathing, cold sweats, death-like countenance, and extreme parts cold. Let her
alone with a Prognosticke of death.

For to help, Cure.
First, all physical means having been used; and proving not availeable,
then its to be drawn forth by the hand, or if that cannot effect it, then by
instrument the first way was often successefully used by Hildanus. Thus first,
he gave a cordial composed of the waters of Cinnamon. Burrag. and Buglosse,
with Confect. Alkermes, then put the woman in a sitting posture, and his hands
being anointed with a L^. composed of the oils of white lillies, and the fat
of a hen and goose, and put it into the womb, and drew forth the dead birth.
In some, he used a bag of Emollients applied to the privities, and anointed
them with the foresaid ointment, sometime before the operations, and for
accident happening, after he gave eight grains of Bezoar in aq. Cinam. s.
vino distill. and Confect. alker. and wonderfully commends it.

If instruments must be used, which is difficult, the room being warm, place
her overwhart the bed with her hips up, and a hard boulster under them, and so
put her into a posture, neither altogether sitting nor lying along on her back,
her heels must be drawn up close to her hips, and with soft linen roulers
tied, as in cutting for the stone, to which for concissenes, we refer you.
Which being done cover the thighs and privities, with a warm cloth, then the
Chyrurgion having his nails pared, his rings off, his arms naked, (and they
and his hands well anointed with the foresaid ointment) gently draw the flappes
of the neck of the womb asunder, putting his hand up gently to find out the
situation and form of the child in the womb, if the head be toward the
orifice, then turn it gently the feet forward, If both come together, draw it
gently forth, if but one, tie it, and so go along till you find the other,
having put that up which you tied in the drawing forth; Let the woman hold her
breath, and have her mouth and nostrills stopped, that so she may be helpefull.

Others may help by pressing the belly. If it be so great that it cannot be
turned, then a hook is to be fastened either to the chinne, or rather to the
hinder part of the head, for so the wind and humors being let forth, it by
gentle pulling will be the easiler extracted, if the breast be affected,
fasten the hook about the channel bone, if it be lower, take hold of the
short ribs, or of pubes, if lower, put in a crooked knife, and cut them.

But note, these things are not to be done, unless the child be dead, and the
mother in great danger. And observe all the woman's privities must be well
anointed to make them the more slippery.

I shall conclude this dreadful operation with that saying of Sennertus, which
he has in Lib. 4. Part. 2. Sect. 6. Chap. 7. (and which may serve this Clymate
as well as that.)

Verum, in nostris regionibus nunquam aut certe rarissime foeminae tales
operationes admittunt, sed potius rem omnem Deo, and Naturae committunt.

Which amounts to this, That women will seldom or never admit of these
operations, but rather commit the business to God, and Nature. As for a Mola.

CHAP. III. A Mola.
WHich is produced from a great deal of blood cloying, Signs.
a little ill disposed seed. It is hardly known, especially till the fourth
month, after which, the motion of the Mole will be to that side; the woman
turns her to like a stone, with trembling and beating; the belly is sooner
great, and more hard then in a true birth, and more troublesome to carry.

Again, there appears no milk in the breast; there is also difficulty of
breathing, pain in the back and the groynes.

Take this for a Prognosticke, Prognost.
If upon the coming away of the Mole there be great flux of blood, its
dangerous. To extract it after its separated from the womb must be as is
handled in a dead child, only the instrument must be the Griffons talon.

CHAP. IV. Secundine.
THough it might have been placed after bringing women to bed; yet because it
may so fall out, it may come to handy operation, we shall do it here: there
is two ways of bringing it away, Physically, and Manually.

The first is rather to be defired, Cure.
and therefore I shall set down only Zacutus pull. praestantissimus (as he
calls it) Carabes tenuissime pulv. j. Castor. s. dictam pulegij. ana j. Cinam
j. borac. js. Spicaenard. j. Myrrh. js. rub. tinctor. j. Croc. g. vj. f. pull.
subtiliss. dos. js. cum sac. and vino alb. or this which I saw experimented.

Take sweet myrrh, ambar, and spermaceti, equal quantities to the quantity of
a js. in white wine posset drink; after it came forth, I beheld it, and saw it
had seated it self unto the womb.

One thing I forgot, which should have been set down in Mola, that after
endeavor to extract, and yet it proved fruitless by reason of a flux of
blood. Zacutus gave these pills, Euphor. j. f. pil. cum sir. Artemisiae four
times in the space of twelve days, three hours after supper, and they brought
away eight Moles.

If it must be done with the hand, it being anointed, is to be put up, and
finding the navill string, follow it till you come to the Secundine, and it
stick, then shake it gently, and when it is loosed, draw it out.

CHAP. V. Of the easy and safe bringing women to bed.
AS for the easy and safe bringing women to bed, though it be most fit for the
Midwife, yet it has fallen out to be the practice of the Chyrurgion, therefore
we shall give brief directions. It is not necessary to set down foregoing
signs, being so notoriously known to all.

When the time is come, put her in a convenient posture either in or upon her
bed, or in a stool for the same purpose, let her back be pretty high, her
legs wide, open and turned toward the hips, and if upon a bed, let her lean
over a staff placed overwhart the bed, or for a need upon a good-wives
shoulders. Let her not labor too much before her strong pain comes. If she
please she may stand up, and lean when the pangs come.

Let sometimes her belly, other whiles her loins be pressed downward,
remember your hand and her privities be anointed, cum ol. lilior. alb. Amygd.
d. vitel. ovor. and lumbric. ana s. pingued. Anser. Capon. ana j. Misce. After
this, far. faenugr. Cydonior. ana j. Croc. subtilis. pull. ij. aq. Artemis. j.

foresaid cases, as also if the water being come forth, has left the womb dry.

If the Infant come with its head forward presently following the flux of
water, it is good, and so you may receive it. If it come with the feet forward,
its difficult. If it come forth any other way its to be turned and drawn
forth by the feet, after it is borne, take away the Secundine (lest grievous
symptoms happen) as is before set down, then let her close her legs a
cross, lest she take cold, and roll up her belly with towells, and being laid
in bed, give her some Capon-broath, or Caudle of white wine and saffron added;
keep the curtain drawn, and door and windows shut; you may to facilitate
the birth, inwardly exhibit Confect. Alker. s. aq. Cinam. j. decoct. Agrimon.
and veronic. js. Sacchari. q. s. ad. Croc. gr. vj. Balsa. Not. is excellent, or
j. borac. in aq. Artemis. iij. sharp clysters may be here, if necessary,
used, and neezings.

After the child is brought to light, tie the navell with a double thread an
inch from the belly, not too hard or too slack, and two fingers breadth above
that, cut it off, and upon the Section apply a double linen cloth dipped in
ol. of Roses, or sweet Almonds, within few days after, that above the tie will
fall off.

If the child be weak, some apply this, vini maluatic. and aq. vit. part.

CHAP. VI. Caesarean Birth.
THis is to cut forth a living child, and though it be seldom in practice,
yet we shall touch at it. It has been commanded upon living subjects, by what
warrant I know not.

I hope all will acknowledge, to do it upon the dead to save the living, is
Christian. Yet the operation has also another profitable and necessary
intention, which is to behold the Site of the child in the womb, for those
that are exercised either in the producing of living, or extracting of dead
children.

It must be performed presently upon the mothers death, beginning your Section
at the breast-blade in a circular manner to the privities, or near it, not
touching the bowels. Then the womb being lift up is to be cut (lest you hurt
the child) with your knife; and the infant to be taken forth, which in
appearance may seem dead, but may certainly be known to be alive by the
beating of the Artery of the navell, and having taken air, will move all his
members. Because its weak, the Secundine must not be removed, but rather if
there be any heat in it remaining, be laid close to the region of the belly
to stir up that heat again in the Infant which seems to be decayed.

Having finished these hazardous operations, we at last come to the Symptoms.

SECT. II. CHAP. I.
OTher Symptoms might here have been handled, but they more properly belong to
the practice of physic, whither to we refer you; and come to the second part
of things superfluous by event; in which may be handled all kinds of Ruptures.
And here we shall set down such as are so in regard of similitude, as also
properly so; And begin with

Bronchocele. Bronchocele


It is a round tumor of the throat engendered of phegmatick humors betwixt the
Trachea Arteria, and the Cutis. Some of them covering the whole throat.

Sometimes they are hereditary, otherwhiles caused by the coldness of the air,
drinking water, and eating such things as cause phlegm and wind; the
differences may be according to the various matter therein contained.

Such as are hereditary are uncurable, as also those that are great and
inveterate: If small, or not of long standing, it is curable.

Cure. Cure.


For universalls, what is prescribed in pituitous tumors, are here diligently
to be observed. The cure external is either by Resolutives, Cauteries, or
Incision. It Is true in the beginning astringents must be applied, as Empl.
contra Ruptur. for resolvers, a fomentation of Dill. Chamomel, Melilot, etc.
boiled in white wine; or rather a Lixiv made of wine-lees burnt: after apply
Empl. de vigo cum Mercur. reduplic. vel Empl. diachil great, cum gum. Galb. et
Bdell. dissol. in aceto Scill. vel Empl. dia Sulphur. and Balsam. ejusdem.
Fluxing in this case is excellent.

If it cannot be resolved, then you must open it either by Cauteries or
Incision, but rather the latter; which being done, let the matter be speedily
evacuated; but if it cannot be done at once, then at diverse times, and keep
upon it some of the former Emplasters: Some pass through a needle and thread,
and keep it in as a Seton; if it be in Aristis, it is to be handled as
Atheoraema.

CHAP. II. Exomphalon vel Hern. Vmbilicalis.
IT is a Tumor of the navell, Exomphalon.
caused either by the relaxation or breaking of the Peritoneum.

Signs. Signs.


If the caul be in the Tumor, it is soft, and continues it is natural color;
If the intestines, it is soft, unequal, and returns with noise; If from blood,
it is like Aneurisma; If of flesh, hard.

Prognostic. Prognost.


If great, it is hard to cure; if of the guts, caul, wind, or water, it may be
cured; if from flesh or blood, it is not to be meddled with.

Cure. Cure.


If from the caul or guts, force them into their proper place, after which
apply this, bol. Arm. Sang. drac. Mastic. Sarcocol an. j. bislinga tegul. pull.
an. iij. resin. pin. is. alb. ov. and cerae, q. s. f. cerat. If it be large;
take up the skin after reduction, and bind it, and so let it fall, having first
cut it off to the Ligature; but before you bind it, pass through the needle
two or three times, or as often as it is needful, and after cicatrize it. If it
be fleshy, or from blood, it is uncurable; if water or windy they are to be
cured as shall be taught hereafter: You are to observe besides the medicament,
there are fit ligatures and boulsters to be applied, especially a girdle with a
bunch for the navill.

Bubonocele, Bubonocele
or Hern. Inguinalis.

It Is when the caul or intestines fall into the flank: if it be the O mentum,
it returns in easily: If the intestines, there is a noise in the pressing of
them.

Cure. Cure.


Of this we shall not need to write much, because it is the same with
Enterocele and Epiplocele, only differing in place and degrees; and therefore
only observe that emollient and discussive fomentations are to be used; after
which, if it be the intestines, and cannot be reduced, give 5 or 6 pricks with
a needle, which will dispatch the wind, and render them reducible; but if hard
faeces be in them that cannot be mollified, but the Patient is in danger of
death, then, if strength be sufficient, incision must be used as shall be
handled.

CHAP. III. Enterocele, and Epiplocele.
THERE is little difference in these, Enterocele. Epiplocele.
the place affected being the same, only the first is when the intestines fall
into Scrotum, the latter when the Caul. The causes of both these and the
former, are eating too much fruit, too much violence in exercises, and drinking
water, riding great horses, strokes, vomiting, coughing, great travel, falls.

Signs. Signs.


The signs of the first is great Tumor unequal, sometimes hard; if you assay
to reduce them, there will be a murmuring noise.

The signs of the latter is also inequality, but more soft and slippery,
neither does it tumefie more by strainings of the breath.

Prognostics. Prognost.


If the first be great, be inflamed, have continued long forth, are very
dangerous, if the part grow livid, and the excrements avoided at the mouth, and
abound, is deadly; if little, they may be cured; for the latter, it is hardly
reduced: And herein sometimes the Peritoneum is broken, otherwhiles only
relaxed: in the first, the tumor suddenly increases with sharp pain; in the
latter, tumefaction is by little and little and also small pains, yet pains
return so often as the tumor is renewed by the falling down of either the guts
or caul, which happen not the Peritoneum bring broken.

Cure. Cure.


General evacuations must here be used, good diet prescribed, after the
intestines or caul must be reduced, and then so conserved that they again
descend not, which requires long patience, otherwise little successful.

If there be need, first let blood, after purge cum diacath. vel purgans
Catholic. use glysters: Then assay to reduce if it be the guts, the Patient
lying on his back, his hips lying higher then his bead, put them up by little
and little with your hand, pressing most on the part where it descends. If by
abundance of wind the reduction is hindered, either give five or six pricks
into the bowels with a needle, or else for two hours make fomentation with
Aquavitae hot, and then put them up; if the saeces hinder being indurated, then
apply the Catap, of Pareus, which I experimented upon an ancient man, near 80
years old, who I found vomiting with such a stench, as I could scarce endure
it; yet though I prognosticated his death by the application of it, and casting
in a glyster made of the decoct. cum diacathol. and sale, beyond all
expectation either of his friends or my self, word was brought me his bowels
was of themselves reduced, though there was much out. I conceive the saeces
being mollified, the straining in his vomiting forced them up: the Catap. is
this, rad. Althea and lilior an. ij. Some. lini and faenugr. an. s. fol. malu.

afterward beaten and drawn through a searse (which I wanted;) add thereto
Butyr. S. s. and ol. Lilior. and Catap. apply it hot; before you apply it,
anoint the part cum ol. lilior. and Aneth. If, as it often happens, reduction
cannot be, because the process of the Peritoneum is not wide enough, then
incision is to be made, as after you shall hear; but if they be reduced
without incision, then use this fomentation for 15 or 20 days, Cort. granat.

it, and so bind it up. Fonseca exhibited, Chalyb prepar. j. cum diarrhod abbat.

As for Epiplocele being reduced, Epiplocele.
it is cured as the former, removing plasters every 7 day for a month or six
weeks together: Observe this, as they are to lie long, so their lying must be
so as their head and shoulders may be lower then their hips and fundament.

As was said before, if they cannot be put up, because the passage is too
narrow, or the faeces cannot be mollified, then incision is to be made after
this manner; lay the Patient upon a form or table on his back, being bound
thereto, make incision in the upper part of the Scrotum, touching not the guts;
then with your directory put in at the incision, and under the production of
the Periton. with your knife make incision so much as is sufficient for your
purpose up toward the belly, and after having made reduction, stitch up so much
of the Peritoneum, as shall seem sufficient, that by the passage being made
more strait, nothing may fall into Scrotum after cicatrization: This is not to
be done, unless strength be sufficient. Rupture.
If a Rupture will not be cured by these means by reason of the greatness of
the brokennesse, or relaxation of the Peritoneum, (and the patient will
undergo the danger) then we are to use the last help, which have diverse
differences, as to be done either with the extraction of the stone, or without
it; that without it, is either with the hurt of the seed vessels, or without;
that without hurt is double, either by incision or cautery: I shall only set
down that in Pareus. Pareus.
The Surgeon is to make incision about the share bone, into which he shall
thrust his directory conveying it long ways under the process of the
Peritoneum: And by lifting up, separate it from the adjoining fibrous and
nervous bodies to which it adheres; then presently draw aside the spermatick
vessel with the cremaster or hanging muscle of the testicle; which being done,
draw the process it self alone, aside, and take as much of it as is to lax
with small mullets perforated in the midst, and with a needle having 5 or 6
threads, which thrust through as near as you can to the seed vessels and
cremaster muscle, but the needle must also be drawn again into the midst of the
remnant of the process, taking up with it the lips of the wound; then the
thread must be tied on a strait knot, and so much must be left after the
needle is cut off as will hang forth of the wound; and it is not to be drawn
forth till there be sufficient concarnation (lest labor prove vain) then cure
it according to art. To conclude, observe, that you in children do not mistake
the stone not yet fallen into Scrotum for a Rupture, which I know have been the
fault of diverse who have brought their children unto me to be cured.

CHAP. IV. Hydrocele.
Which is a waterish tumor in Scrotum, Hydrocele.
which grows by little and little, sometimes distending the cod to a great
bigness; sometimes being gathered betwixt the two membranes that cover the
stone, caused either from falls, blows, etc. or ill diet, cold, distemper of
the liver, extinction of natural heat.

Signs. Signs.


It Is clear betwixt you and the light, not painful, heavy, hard; sometimes

if these prevail not, incision is to be made, and a tent put in armed with a
digestive, and upon it apply Emp Basiliconis: let the incision be some half
fingers breadth, and be kept long open till all the water be evacuated, in the
interim purging. Some uses to draw a string through like a Seton in the lower
part of Scrotum. If it be in the membranes, make incision into the Lid of the
Scrotum, taking heed to the Stone, and dress it, S. A.

CHAP. V. Pneumatocele.
THis is a windy tumor in the Scrotum, Pneumatocele.
generated by imbecility of heat in the part.

Signs. Signs.


It Is hard, light, round, suddenly engendered, resisting touch, the yard being

CHAP. VI. Sarcocele.
A Fleshy Tumor in the Scrotum caused from gross and viscid humors, Sarcocele.
it often corrupts the stone.

Signs. Signs.


It Is hard, unequal, and rough, painful, often accompanied with varices or
swollen veins; some not painful.

Prognostics. Prognost.


If in young ones, and in the beginning, it sometimes is cured; if it be big,
and got to the groins, it is dangerous, but it is always most hardly cured.

Cure. Cure.


Mathiol says, rad. anonidis taken in powder many months, has cured. If
medicines prevail not, then incise, first placing the sick in a fit posture: if
the string of the testicle be small, make incision into Scrotum to the Tumor,
then separate it from the cod, thrusting a needle with a strong thread through
it, and having tied the Dedrin, cut it off, cauterizing that which is cut, and
bringing forth the rupture, if any portion remain, cut it off, otherwise it
will come again; apply to it and neighboring parts repercussives; if
inflammation and dolor happen, let blood, and rest 5 or 6 days.

CHAP. VII. Cirsocele.
ITs a tumefaction of the veins in Scrotum, Cirsocele.
caused from gross melancholy blood.

Signs are evident, Signs.

CHAP. VIII. Hernia Humoralis.
It Is a Tumor generated by the confused mixture of many humors in the cod,
Hernia humoralis.
or betwixt the tunicles that cover the stones; if it continues long, it
corrupts the testicles.

Cure. Cure.


It sometimes suppurates, and otherwhiles resolves: Purging and bleeding is
here necessary; vomiting is good. Externally, apply this, a Catapl. made cum
vino art. flor. fabar. and ol. ros. vel Sambucin and parum cerae, so that the
whole may come to 2 lb. to which add oxymel 5, 6, 7, or 8. and boil it into a
body, if it tend to suppuration, make your incision in the side of the cod, and
cure it according to Art; only observe this, they often become incurable
Fistula's.

CHAP. IX. Any procidentia.
ITs the out-comming or turning over of the great gut, Any procidentia.
caused by the laxation of the Sphincter muscle, being most common to children:
Others, it is the coming forth of intestina recta.

Signs are needless, Signs.
it is caused of too much straining, fluxes, strokes, sitting on cold stones.

in the putting it up let the patient draw up his breath, when it is up, let it
be diligently wiped, and a swath about the middle to bring the ligature
betwixt his legs, and under it a sponge as before; when the patient goes to
stool, if he can, let him stand and take heed of too much straining.

CHAP. X. Vteri procidentia.
THe falling down of the womb being occasioned either by the relaxation or
breaking of the ligaments; Vteri procidentia.
the causes are immoderate exercise, carrying too great burdens, dray (...)

frequently over much humidity.

Signs. Signs.


Often both the urine and excrements are retained by the pressing of the womb

If after all this it cannot be cured, but its black and stinking, bind as much
as is necessary, and cutting it off, sear it with a cautery, for this may be
without danger, after cure it S. A.

Thus having concluded the second branch of things superfluous by event, we
come to the Third, and in it we begin with

SECT. III. CHAP. I. Amputation.
THIS is a dreadful operation, Amputation.
and a part may be subjected to it, notwithstanding the diligence of the
Surgeon, which being sphacelated, must necessarily be amputated, lest life
for want of it be removed.

In this four things are to be handled. First, the signs of a part subject
to such an operation. Secondly, the place where. Thirdly, the manner how.
Fourthly, how to conquer the Symptoms which usually follow the operation.

Signs. Signs.


If it look black, the part be thoroughly dead, and cold as a stone; if it
smell strongly, so that it can hardly be endured, especially if ulcerated; if a
sanies, moistness, viscid green, or blackish flow from thence; if void of
sense and motion, they are to be taken with these cautions: First, they may
say they have sense when they feel it not. Secondly, motion may remain, by
reason the head of the muscles are not affected; and yet the part be fit for
Amputation, which delay not.

Secondly, the place where; and this is either in the sound part, which ever
has been in most frequent use, and most practiced: Or, secondly, in the
corrupt part.

Thirdly, how it is to be done: and here is to be considered, what is to be
done before the operation; 2 In; 3 After. First, the body is to be prepared by
good diet; as, yolks of eggs, and bread tosted and dipped in muscadine. If it
be necessary, and time permit, which is seldom, use purging; but especially
thrice a day administer cordials; as j. of this at a time, Lap. Bazar oss. de

Secondly, have in readiness a saw with two heads, a good dismembring knife, an
incision knife, three or four rowlers of flannell, five or six yards long,
three great stitching needles, large clouts, and some lesser, pledgets of tow,
greater and lesser, dorsels and buttons, a large bowl with ashes, water and
vinegar bladders, and satchell for the member which prohibits blood, draws up
the muscles, and keeps the Saw from the flesh. Secondly, in the operation draw
up the muscles, then make a strong ligature, which strengthen with a strong
man's hands to ingirt the part, especially pressing hard upon the place of the
great vessels: This being done, with your dismembring knife speedily cut the
fiesh round to the bone; if it be in the leg, or below the elbow, with your
incision knife divide the flesh betwixt the bones; after with the back of your
knife, the Periostium being removed, with your dismembring Saw take off the
bone, as near the fiesh as you can: If the party be plethorick and strong, let
it bleed a little, then stay it, which is done three ways. 1. By powders that

appears) then with your rollers bind up the member, and so blood will be
stayed. Second way, is by applying the actual cauteries, which always have in
a readiness, apply them to the mouths of the veins, (having cleansed them from
clotted blood) once or twice at the most. The third is stitching, which is
troublesome and dangerous, in which the vessels are to be taken up, and after
bound. Above the place amputated (as if in the leg, upon the knee; if in the
thigh, near the groine; if in the arm, upon the elbow, etc.) is this

CHAP. II. The second way of Amputation. which is in the corrupt part.
THis is only to be performed when the Sphacelus or mortification has taken
up its limits, or else moves very slowly (and not when it moves speedily) here
purging may be admitted, and longer preparation made for the operation, which
is thus performed.

Having your instruments ready as formerly, with cauterizing irons both broad
and round, with two persons to hold both parts of the member strongly and
steady, then make Amputation as before, as near the sound part as you can, but
not too near: after the member is taken off, then with your Incision knife take
as much of the mortified flesh away as you can, and then superficially run over
the dead flesh with a cautery; as also therewith heal the end of the bone, and
after make fomentations for half an hour with a good lixivium (as described in
a gangrene) not too hot: which being done, apply woollen stuffes to the part,
warm; and so bind it up: The second dressing do the like, cutting off the dead
slough with scissers; and forgetting not to heat the bone. Thus do till the
putrid flesh fall, then dress it according to Art. At last in the

Fourth place, we are come to the Symptoms: As, 1 Syncope. 2 A Convulsion. 3

recited. Sometimes abscesse is produced; for which, and easing pain, medul.

As for the cutting of a finger or two, it is best done by cutting mullets,
which takes away the flesh and bone at once; with these may also be taken away
superfluous fingers. Thus having passed over these dangerous operations, we
come to that which is of no less consequence: Which is the

CHAP. III. Extirpation.
OF a Cancerous tumor or Ulcer possessing any part, Extirpation.
(and therewith, if it be necessary, the part it self, as the breast) the signs
of both which, with their prognostics are set down page 82. This operation is
not to be attempted where the Cancer has taken too deep rooting; as if it
enter into the pit of the eye, so far that the root cannot be come at; or if it
have entered into the mouth, and withal possesses the most part of the face,
when it has made its passage into the capacity of the breast, or adheres so
close that it cannot be separated; also if it be great, and in the armpits,
it is not to be touched; but if they be loose, or have not taken too deep
rooting, they may be taken away; which is usually performed two ways, either
by Causticks, or by Incision. I shall not speak much to the first, having said
something in the place forecited, only commend unto you a French experiment,
which is to be used if ulcerated, which is this, aq. fortis j. sublimat. crud.
iiij. Sal. Ammoniac. ij. Arsenic. j. ponatur in Alembicum et distill. ad
siccitatem: add. acet. distill. iterum donee materia ad pastae consistentiam
redeat. It Is thus to be applied, first wash the Cancer with hot wine and linen
clothes, rubbing it hard; afterward having a Plaster spread of the paste upon a
six doubled cloth, not altogether so big as the Tumor, apply it, and let it
there remain for 24 hours; this causes an eschar bigger then the medicine,
which brings away the Cancer; which is afterward to be cured S. A. He says it
causes several symptoms but such as are beneficial, as fever, vomiting, and
fluxes, if I forget not. This is worthy to be noted, though not so properly
here placed, that he cured really one, and palatively another with a medicament
composed with rose, plantain, and red poppy waters, and honey of roses. But we
come to Exterpation by way of Incision, which though it be proper for
ulcerated Cancers, yet more in such tumors: And this may be done either by
incision first, and then Cauterized, or else done both together: Or else by
Incision with application of astringents only; which is good, though the other
may seem more rationally proper unto this account; that the Cautery bridles
more the malignity of the matter; as also if any small portion of the Cancer
remain, it may come to fall with the Eschar. Your Cautery must be fitted to
the part you exterpate. If the Cancers be small, and not ulcerated, but are
loose, and may b^^ freed on every side from the flesh, then Incision, as shall
be declared, and astringent powders may serve; but this is to be observed
before these operations are attempted, the body is to be prepared with Apozemes
fittings, or magistrall Syrups dissolved in suitable water; and after purge, and
then sweat, and then purge again, withal opening a vein, and apply the
Leeches. Your Apozeme may be this, or the like, rad. Cichor. cum toto Mj. rad.

after which purge the body again; having thus prepared the body, make in
readiness pledgets, b^ulsters, and roulers, and needles, astringent powders as
in Sphacelu^ described, and Cauteries according as you intend to operate. If
you are to extirpate some off, or all the part, then take hold of it, either
with your left hand, or else with Forceps for that purpose, (made round in
compass) and presently excise it; which being done, speedily apply your
Cautery, having, as much as time and strength gives leave, pressed out the
blood which lies in the swollen veins: but you had better do it with a knife
for the purpose made red hot, and so do two works at once: after which dress
it up with medicines appeasing dolor, and cause the Eschar to fall, anointing
all the part cum ol. ros. and mirtill. Now you may know the Cancer is
exterpated, if after the Eschar is fallen quite, or become laudable, the pain
and symptoms be allayed, and when the flesh grows like grains of pomgranat.
The other way is this, first cut the skin, and separate it from the Cancer, as
also the parts to which it adheres, either with a knife, or rather if you can,
with your nayls; after which, either passing a needle and thread through it, and
so holding it up, cut it out, or else following the former course, with your
fingers pull it out; for thus may you know more assuredly you have not left any
remaining; after apply your astringent powder with white of eggs, vel farin.

passing a needle and thread through them, cut it off with either a knife or
pair of scissers, afterward cure it as a Hare-lip. To conclude, that Cancers
may be excised safely, is confirmed abundantly by Hildanus for the
encouragement of the young Surgeon. I shall briefly set down an observation
of my own: A poor man of Barford, near Warwick aged nee^ 80. came to me, with
an ulcerated Cancer on his left leg, the in side, upon the calf; after several
applications, and all fruitless, I resolved upon Extirpation; and therefore
according as his strength would bear, gave him for 3 or 4 days j. of pull.
solut. in mace ale; after which having passed through a needle and thread, I
took it off, being after in weight, as I take it, above a pound, I stayed the
blood with an astringent powder, and cured it; but after it broke forth lower,
and fell into the hands of a woman, who though she did what she could, the man
died.

SECT. IV.
NOw we are come to the last branch of things superfluous by event, which is
blood offending either in quantity or quality; which is done by opening a vein,
leeches, or cups with scarifications. Concerning how blood offends in quantity
or quality, and when, with the signs, we have set down briefly page.. and
therefore shall pass to those particular ways by which it is removed: And
first of

Phlehotomy.

THe opening of a vein by Incision: Phlehotomy.
In which consider, First, how to open a vein. Secondly, the ends why. Thirdly,
the persons upon whom. Fourthly, the time when. Fifthly, how to remove
accidents.

In the first, consider, that the patient be set in a light place, either so by
nature, or art; then make you ligature a little above the elbow very hard,
having before rubbed his arm well with your hand; after bid him gripe his hand
hard, with his thumb in it; then with your own hand bringing up the blood
beneath to the elbow, clap your thumb hard upon the vein to be opened, and
make your Incision acrosse, which is most usual, (though I have seen and
performed length ways) taking heed to the Artery under the Basilica, and the
nerve under the Median: after they have bled sufficiently, untie the ligature,
laying upon the orifice a little dry Lint, and upon that a plaster and a
boulster, and so tie it up; many only use the Lint and boulster, and think it
the best way. Observe, if after you have made the orifice, it presently spin
forth, and yet after stay again, then slacken your ligature a little till it
come more freely, and be sure his garment be not too strait about the place
where they are put up, lest that hinder. If your veins to be opened be in the
tongue or head, make your ligature in the neck. If in the hands or feet, it
must be done with hot water: Observe, if in the arm, the patient is to have a
staff in his hand, and thereon keep his hand in motion.

Secondly, the ends why, as also the time when, falls out to be the Physicians
share to appoint most commonly, yet we shall a little touch it. In general,
it is for the evacuating of blood offending in quantity and quality, and in this
sense it may be called an universal remedy or magnum remedium; more
particularly in a few things, (for it would be endless to name all) first, to
lessen the abundance of blood, as in plethorick bodies when troubled with
inflammations. Secondly, for diversion or revulsion. Thirdly, to draw down, as
in obstructio Men. Fourthly, for alteration, as in fevers, to take out the hot,
cool the rest. Fifthly, to prevent diseases imminent; noting this, you give a
glyster before bleeding, unless the body be open, but it is more safe in this
case to purge before; in brief, it is necessary in all humorall diseases,
especially if putrified, excellent in those that are from blood, and in those
wherein the breathing, speech, and voice is hindered, especially if done it
time.

Thirdly, for the persons upon whom, with which we may join the quantity; for
the first there is some controversy: Some say, from 7, yea 3, to 80. Others
from 14, to 80. I have done it with good success at 7. for the quantity, it is
to be according to the strength of the Patient, and greatness of the disease.

Fourthly, the time when. If it be only for preservation of health, then the
spring, and in a morning is, fittest though in autumn it may also be performed.
If it be to prevent diseases, then is the time most suitable when such diseases
reign; this is good when malignant diseases are abroad. If it be to cure, then
any fit opportunity is to be taken, which may be most useful, any hour day or
night, may be taken in the first; it is best to open a vein the Moon being in
the second Quarter; the 1 and 3 may be used, but the last Quarter is the worst.
Here may be added what veins are commonly opened: As in the head, vena frontis,
puppis, temporalis, Auricularis, ocularis, Nasalis, Labior. Ranul. and the
Jugulars, much commended by Hildanus and Zacutus. Hildanus Zacutus
In the arm the Cephalica, Mediana, Hepatica. In the hand the first betwixt the
thumb and first finger. 2 Salvatell. 3 Hurnis brac^ii situate in the middle
finger. The vein of the fundament: In the legs, paplita, saphena, seiatica,
medium, this is under the bending of the foot.

Fifthly, we come to the Symptoms: as first, if after you have struck the
vein, it begin suddenly to swell, apply a cloth dipped in cold water till it be
down. If a nerve be hurt you must apply things that ease pain; and when the
vein is closed up, keep the Orifice open and apply such things as in the cure
of punctured nerves. Sometimes there grow through some default Tumor, to which
apply a Catap. of Emollient and Anodines; these medicaments are so frequently
set down, that they need not to be repeated; if Syncop. then lay them upon
their back, or rub their lips with salt.

As for opening an Artery, it may safely be done first rubbing it that it may
appear the more; and after it is opened, and as much spirits as are sufficient
extracted, you may apply Gallen-powder, vid. page 15.

CHAP. V. Cupping-glasses.
THese are to be applied to several parts of the body; Cuppinp-glasses.
if it be possible, let general evacuations precede; if the blood be thick,
foment the part first with hot water, and rub it long with a hot cloth, then an
hour or two after apply them. Cuppings must go before scarification, though
they may be applied either with or without. If with scarification, it is to
evacuate; if not, to divert: they are applied to several parts: 1 In the neck,
to divert from the head, face, eyes, and mouth. 2 In the midst of it, for
shortness of breath, cough, etc. 3 Under the chin, and sides of the neck, for
pain and Ulcers of the mouth, Megrome. And 4 on the shoulders for diseases of
the throat. 5 Reins, for Apostumes and pains there, and in the Liver. 6 In the
Arm, for pains in those parts. 7 Thighs, to procure the courses. 8 Under women's
breasts to stop them. 9 To the Hypchond. to stay bleeding at the nose. And 10
to the navill, for the Cholick, they are to be applied with flax stuck in the
bottom, with soft wax, and set on fire, or having been dipped in hot water; for
scarifications, if the blood be thick, let them be deep; then the Cups are to
be applied again, and so both may be reiterated according to need. After you
have done, you may apply ol. rosar. cerat. ros. vel butyr. rec.

CHAP. III. Lceches.
THese are to be applied, Leeches.
where Cups cannot be set, as to Hemerods, vulva, gummes, lips, nose, fingers;
as also, they may be used to old sores in scarific. after Gangrenes: They are
to be applied handling them with a fine cloth, the part being made clean with
milk; if you would have them fall off, cast upon them salt; if you would have
them suck more then they are able, cut off their tails. You are to choose
those that are in clear water, whose heads are little, bodies small, red
bellyed, their backs rayed like threads of gold; they are to be kept 12 or 13
days before they can be applied. You may keep them a whole year, by changing
the water every 3, 4, or 10 days, adding some crummes of bread. Now to
conclude, if the blood be red, it is good; if it appear white, yellow, or
livid, it demonstrates phlegm, choler, melancholy, and those to be purged; if
it flow out gently and cleave to your fingers, it shows obstructions, and
therefore sweat; if it be thin, and long before it thicken, in which the fibers
presently vanish, it discovers crudity and weakness of the liver; if there be
spume or froth, it is a sign hot predominates in the humors; if the serous be
immoderate, it manifests the infirmnesse of the Liver, and weakness of the
Kidneys; if fat be in the blood, which is raw, it indicates those persons, if
they be fat, they shall grow more fat; if they be lean, it prognosticates
colliquation; if it be of bad smell, it a sign of great putrefaction and
corruption. Thus having done with things superfluous by event, we come in the
next place to those that are so of their own nature. And these are of two
sorts. First, those that are familiar to nature. Secondly, those altogether
adverse. Under the first of those is comprehended; First,

yet they differ; for the first is hard, the other is soft; the Ganglion moving
only to the sides, but Lupia every way; they are most commonly encompassed
with a Cystis, which is the cause of their motion; some of these are great,
others little.

The causes are blows, Causes.

The signs are in the distinction.

If they be great, use good diet, Cure.
and purge; if small and new, break them with your hands, (which I have done
successesully) I mean, the Cystis, and after rub it well; which being done,
apply a plate of Lead besmeard with Mercury for 10 days; it is to be applied
with a plaster, and so it will stick the better; this way has cured diverse,
though they could not be broken. Some advise to anoint before with this, R.

with a knife or cautery; and if the latter, after the membrane is wasted by
Egyptiac. vel pull. praecip. and alum. usti; then follow the cure ex L.A. When
they are very great, and cannot becured, by the foresaid means; they must be
taken away with handy operation, if so be they be not situated on, or near
great vessels, and cleave too close to the adjacent parts; then take up the
skin, and make incision, and with your directory drawn many times about betwixt
the skin and it, divide them even to the root, (your directory is to be thick)
then the former incision being made down to the root, make another incision
overthwart, which being done, draw the skin from the Cystis, (beginning at each
corner) to the root, with your singers covered with a fine linen cloth, or
else a rasor, if need require. And observe, though the vessels which feed it be
small, yet at the bottom they are great, and will cause a flux of blood, which
let be stayed as you have heard, first binding (if you can) the root of the
Wen with a piece of whipcord, or many threads doubled, and let the end hang
forth until it fall away of its one accord; this is to be remembered, so much
of the superfluous skin is to be cut off, and only so much left remaining, as
will cover the part which is to be stitched, and with a tent kept in it till
it be perfectly cleansed; if any of the Cystis be left, be sure it be eaten
away by fit medicines; after all which let it be cured S. A. Those that are
small at the roots, may be straightly tied, and so cut off. Those near the
jugular veins in the armpits, groins, and under the hambs, are very dangerous.

CHAP. II. Atheroma.
A Tumor in which is matter like Rice pottage, Atheroma.
or curds, it is long in figure, and with pressing it goes in slowly, and
returns not suddenly; it is soft, without pain, yet harder then Meliceris.

Meliceris.

It Is a Tumor sost, subtle, Meliceris.
and clear, it takes the impression easily, and returns as speedily, being
round in figure; the matter in it is like honey in color and confistence, and
besides a gravelly hard matter, the hardest of the three to cure.

Steatoma.

The matter in this is like greas, Steatoma.
it is hard in pressing, goes in slowly, and returns not hastily, being large at
the root; besides, the accustomed matter is sometimes found bones, cotton, and
such like.

The general signs of all is, Signs.
they come by little and little, without either pain or inflammation preceding.

The causes are strokes, falls, Causes.
violent exerci^es, great eating and drinking, plenty of phlegmatic humor
occasioned by ill diet. The places they possess commonly, are the hands, head,
joints, and diverse parts of the face.

In which we shall join them together, being no great difference; The first
is cured by incision and eating forth. The second, resolution with the former:
The last by incision only. For resolution; if it have place, use this: Labdan.

j. Amoniac. sulph. an. s. mise. But they are best cured by either Incision,
Cauteries, actual o^ potentiall. The Tumor being opened, and the Cystis
discovered, which will appear white, you must separate the same gently from the
flesh, and with your iustrument pluck it forth, with what is contained in them;
if there remain any portion of the bla^^er, eat away, as has been taughe, but
with disc^etion, for fear of inflammation; if you open it with the Cauteries,
make your orifice according to the magnitude of the Tumor, and evacuate the
matter by degrees, and after cure S.A. Sometimes they are complicated with
veins, nerves, and arteries, as also tendons, of which you must have a
special care, and be more dextrous in the operation.

CHAP. IV. Strumas, or Scrophulas.
MOst commonly possess the throat, Strumas, or Scrophulas.
being their Tumors in the glanduls, enclosed in a Cystis movable, and round
also, may be separated from the skin.

The cause is phlegm, Canse.
sometimes joined with melancholy, as also crasse and crude diet, drunking ill
waters, they are sometimes few, otherwhile many.

Those which are few in number, Prognost.

they break, by Cansticks; those that are hard, fixed, and malign; as also
near the Trachea, great and complicated with veins are dangerous, it
frequently possesses the hands, feet, elbows, and other parts which I have
seen and cured.

First, matter offending must be evacuated, diet of light digestion

suppurated, unless the part be subject to corruption.

CHAP. V. Cataract.
It Is the obstruction of the pupil of the eye by a hard and congealed humor,
Cataract.
this humor is the aqueous offending in quantity or quality; if in quantity, it
either by the increase or decrease of it, which is known by the dilatation or
constriction of the pupil; if from the quality, it is thickened and
condensated, and this vulgarly is called a Cataract.

If they be of the color of rusty iron, Cure.
or white like pearls, or an ashy green like Sea water, or chestnut, they are
curable; if of the color of chalk, black, or yellow, not. If from acute
Fevers, Peripneumony, Frenzy, and pain in the head, it is hard: if it be new,
and not confirmed, it may be discussed, otherwhise not. If ready To Couch, shut
the whole eye, and ^ub gently the lid of the ill eye; if spread and come round
again, it may be couched, otherwise not, Gal. 1. de Sympt. causis, Cap. 2.

River, prax. Med. Tom. 2. page 33. says, he cured some in principio, yea,
though fifty years aged, with universal evacuations, a sweating diet, and
vesicatories, without any external applications; in this first purge the whole
body, especially the head, is exactly to be evacuated, and the humor in the
pupil discussed, if you perceive it come from the stomach, vomit, if not purge

If it cannot be dissolved, then we are to use the needle, which is done thus,
turn the eye toward the nose, and thrust in the needle boldly in the middle
space betwixt the lesser corner and the horny coat, just against the midst of
the Cataract, bringing it from above downward beneath the Pupil, there keep it
for some short time; when it abides firmly, draw back the needle gently, after
apply the white of eggs, with rosewater, and a little alum; then bind up both
the eyes, and apply a restrictive on the forehead; let his head lie high, use
liquid meats; after the former manner dressing it once aday for 12 or 15 days,
moving the head and teeth as seldom as is possible. Let it be done in a
morning. It will be convenient after the Patient is well, to prevent
reciduvation, to use purges, and open a fontinell.

There are diverse other effects, which though it be not so proper, we shall
insert here, because we are treating of the eyes.

CHAP. VI. Oculi procidentiae.

macerated in vinegar, and dried and made into powder, and used; if these
prevail not, use manual opperation, which perform thus, keep the eye open with
speeul. oculi; then lift the nail up, with a little silver hook, taking hold
of the middle, after pass a needle and thread through to hold it up, then
diligently separate it, taking heed of Cornea and Adnata.

CHAP. VIII.
AS for Grando and Hordeolum Tumors upon the eye lids, Grando and hordeolum

resolution, maturation, or incision.

For Rhyas and Encanthes, Rhyas and Encanthes.

For the second, it is hardly cured if great and old, it must be by incision,
which is dangerous, if it cannot be taken a^vay cum alum. vel vitriol. usto;
take heed lest in your cutting you cause a haemorrbagia or blindness; for the
itching of those glanduls, use this, Tutiae praep. cum aq. ros. Misce.

CHAP. IX. Hudatis.
It Is a certain fatty substance lying under the skin of the upper eye lid;
Hudatis.
it is incident to children of humid natures.

If pressed, Signs.
it leaves a pit, it cannot be lifted up, the eyes look red, and flow with
tears, they cannot endure the light.

If it be new and small, Cure.
it may be cured by anointing it with fasting spittle every morning, or foment

forth, and if vehemence of pain hinder not, put in salt to consume the matter,
and dry and strengthen. Lastly, use alb. ov. cum aq. ros. the treadings only,
which are excellent in wounds, and all pains in the eyes.

CHAP. X.
IF things fallen into the eyes offend, either lick them forth, or with a piece
of a fine sponge tied to the end of your Probe, wipe them forth, moistening it
cum aq. ros. If there be great pain, apply defensatives to the forehead, use

you may apply rotten apple, cumlac Mulier, which eases pain admirably.

SECT. VI. CHAP. I.
THUS having put an end to things superfluous, which are familiar to nature;
we come to the last branch (of the third part) which is things adverse to
nature; as, stones in any part of the body, but especially in the bladder. For
stones in all other internal parts, they are not within the compass of this
operation with any safety, though some think those in the kidneys may bear it;
those that are in the external parts are with Tumor, and therefore may be
accordingly cured: Therefore we shall here briefly handle,

CHAP. II. Lithotomia.
HIldanus in his accurate Discourse concerning this Subject, Lithotomia.
before the operation, prepares the body by purging, bleeding, baths, etc. It Is
good, but yet good operators have performed their work either without, or
little; however, I shall briefly set down what is necessary. And begin with the
Causes

Which are either efficient, as the preternaturall heat of the inward bowels;
or material, which is a gross and slimy phlegm: It Is true, other humors with
this may be commixed, and salt and tartar may supernaturally add to the
coagulation.

There is with the urine mixed a crasse, viscid, and white humor, which
standing, cleaves to the urinall; pain in pissing, strangury, pain, and itching
at the end of the prepuce; much thirst, the Surgeon putting his finger at
the fundament, he may perceive a hardness, but the surest way is to search with
the Cathetar, being anointed cum ol. Amygd. d. in the putting of this, let the
Patient be in a stooping posture, leaning against something with his back, with
his knees a foot asunder, put it in gently, you shall know there is a stone by
an obscure sound.

In which consider; first, things to be done before: Secondly, in: Thirdly,
after.

For the first, having certain knowledge of a stone, then consider the
greatness; If it be very great, it cannot but procure death; the greatness is
known, if it has been long in generating, if there be a great weight, and by
putting you finger in the Fundament, before you go about the work, let the
body for certain days be prepared by keeping an accurate diet, using this for
his drink; Agrimon. ve ronic. an. M s. Liquir. s. incida^^ and decoq. in lb

stead of the bath be used, applied to the Perinaeum, and those parts.

The Spring time is the best for the operation, and it is more safely performed
on young then old.

Secondly, for what is to be done in having in a readiness Catheters, Probes,
Conductor, Itinerarium, Specula, Pincers, small hooks of all sizes, Astringent
powders, owlers, Spunges, and Cordialls. Let the Patient be placed on a firm
Table, with a sheet many times doubled laid under his buttocks, and a pillow
under his loins and back, so that he may lie half upright; with his thighs
lifted up, and his legs and heels drawn back to his hips; then having a strong
long Rowler of four fingers broad, use it thus, let it be rolled at both ends,
let an Attendant hold one side of the rowler very hard in the hinder part of
the Patients neck; and then go with the other end over the Patients left arm
hole, and under the left arm toward the right hip, and over the forepart of
the thigh, whence carry it below the knee, and thence bring it again to the
external part of the thigh, and so to the sole of the foot, and thence again
above the thigh; and so under the knee, and thence again upwards toward the
loins; then go up with it toward the left arm hole, that so thou may bring
it from under the left arm to the neck, where thou shall deliver that end of
the rowler to be held by the attendant; and taking the end which he holds,
thou shall bring, it over the right arm-pit, first forward, and then backward
under the arms toward the left thigh, that both ends of the rowler may meet
cross ways upon the back, whence thou shall carry it above the hip and thigh,
downwards to the knee, and above the shins, thigh, and under the sole of the
foot, and so again to the hip, and over the loins to the right arm hole, after
the form used on the left side, that both the ends of the rowler may be knit
together upon the neck, surely. Being thus bound, have two strong men on each
side of him, two whereof may hold him by the knees and feet, and two by the arm
holes and hands. After this, let the Surgeon thrust in his Directory for
that purpose, which will be a guide to him for making his incision; let it be
carried to the left side, and let him who stands on the Patients right hand,
with his left hand lift up his Scrotum; make your incision a fingers breadth
from the fundament, on the left side the Perinaum, not exceeding the bigness of
your thumb, for it is afterward enlarged with the Dilator. If the stone be found
great. If it be possible, let it be drawn out whole, if it cannot, it must be
broke: But after incision, before you take out your Directory, thrust in the
Conductor upon the Directory to the very stone; after take out the Directory,
that so the yard may be free. This done, thrust in the Hamulus by the open
side of the Conductor; the Conductor being drawn forth, then the stone to be
brought down by two of the fingers of the left hand put into the fundament, to
be caught by the Hamulus, and so drawn out, let some also crush the belly
gently to further the falling of the stone to the neck of the bladder. After
the great stones are drawn forth, then with your spoon cleanse the bladder of
the gravel and clotted blood; but this may be omitted, if the Patients
strength will not bear it, the orifice being to be kept open; the same way may
be extracted stones from women and children, only in women the fingers is to
be put in vulva, (unless in maids) and the Catheter may be strait. Children
may be held on a man's lap. As soon as the bladder is discharged, let the
ligature be unloosed, and the Patient laid in his bed, apply to the wound a
Tent armed with the white of eggs, and an Astringent powder, which put to the
very bladder, upon this a boulster dipped in the white of an egg, rose and
plantane waters beat together. Anoint the belly, navill, loins, and all the
parts about with this, ol. ros. viol. an. ij. Amygd. d. ovor. butyr. rec. an.

have not urin'd, as before, and so for three or four days, till danger of

(after anointing) a boulster as before, adding only a little rose vinegar.
after a while a silver pipe is to be used; and follow the cure according to
art.

Some symptoms here may be annexed, but those that are common to other wounds
shall not be handled: Yet this observe, a strict diet is to be observed, and
the belly kept open; and if the body be young and plethorick, a vein opened
after the third day, which prevents most symptoms, therefore first to be
handled, Is,

CHAP. IV. Retention of the stone in the yard.
THis is similar and proper to the former matter; if it can neither be driven
forth by the hand, nor forced back with your Catheter, or broken with a small
Piercer, it is to be cut forth, which is to be made not upon the ureter, but
near it, till you come to the stone, which if it cannot be thrust forth, is to
be drawn forth with an instrument with the handle; after handle the wound
according to artt, having care that proud flesh grow not inward, which to
prevent, use a wax candle, or a leaden fillet anointed cum vng. diapomphol.

PART. IV.
CHAP. I. SECT. I.
HAving passed over the 3 first parts of Surgery, we come to the last, which
is the supplying the defects of the body: And these are either of the body it
self, as the restoring of the Nose, Ears, and Lips; or of some other matter,
as the Eyes, Hand, etc. artificially made; the former of these are here never
practiced (though amongst the Bononians) they being so difficult and painful;
and if one did consider the preparations necessary, the symptoms that fall
out, the dangers that may happen by the least neglect, it would altogether be
left, considering therewithal that there may be other more easy way used. But
to come to the

CHAP. II. Restoring of the Nose.
FIrst scarifie the callous edges of the Nose, Restoring the Nose.
after make an incision on the arm into the muscle Biceps, as large as is
requisite, into which put the nose, and bind the Patients head unto his arm
for 40 days, which being agglutinated, cut as much out of the arm as may make
the nose, fashioning it in every thing accordingly; the Patient is only to be
fed with Panadoes and other liquid things; the Lips and Ears are to be taken
also from the same place; the last is the most dangerous, by reason of great
flux, the quantity of the flesh being more to restore the ear then any, and
therefore the incision to be more large. But to conclude, this first branch,
if ever patience be requisite in any operation of Surgery, then much more in
this, a man would be loath to be in little ease a day, much more a hundred; if
any would know more of these operations, let him peruse Gaspar Talicotius.

As for defects to be supplied by those things which are no ways of the nature
of the body; we shall take them in order, and begin with the

CHAP. V. Eyes.
WHich must be made of silver or gold, Eyes.
and inamelled, fit for the cavity; Two or three is necessary; these are to be
put in, or taken out at pleasure; the most exquisite is thought to be made in
France.

CHAP. IV. Nose.
BEing lost, Nose.
may be restored artificially, the matter of it may be gold, silver, paper,
and linen clothes glewed artificially colored, it must be bound and stayed
with little thread unto the hinder part of the head or hat, if there be any of
the upper lip wanting, it may also be added.

CHAP. V. Teeth.
IF they be broken, struck out of their places, or drawn, Teeth.
and so cause deformity, and hinder pronunciation; then you may have some made
of ivory, and put into the place, and fastened to the other with a silver wire
or silk.

CHAP. VI. Palate.
IT happens often that part of the bone of the Palate, Palate.
either by gunshot, or Lues Venerea is removed, so that the Patient cannot
pronounce his words distinctly, but obscurely and snuffling; to amend this,
there must be a gold or silver plate prepared, the thickness of a French
Crown, a little bigger then the cavity it self, in the form of a dish, in the
inner part of which must a little sponge be fastened; this sponge is to be
put into the cavity, which with the moisture coming from the brain being wet,
will cause it swell and fill the cavity; and so keep up the Palate, as if it
stood of it self.

CHAP. X. Tongue.
PArt of this may be cut off, Tongue. Pareus.
and so cause dumbness: Pareus has an observation of it, and how helped; the
sum of which is this: The tongue being part cut off, an instrument of wood was
neatly cut, having two parts; the upper part the thicknes of a Nine pence, the
lower as thick as a six pence; the upper part is to be held between the
cutting teeth, that it cannot come forth of the mouth, or be seen; the lower
part is to be put hard to the rest of his tongue, close to the membranous
ligament which is under it; and thus may they speak.

CHAP. VIII. Ears.
IF it be but in part gone, Ears.
then in that which remains make many holes, and with lead let them be
cicatrized; after having the rest of the ear artificially made, is to be
fastened by those holes; but if it be totally gone, another must be made of
paper or leather, artificially, and so with laces fastened to the top or hinder
part of the head on a cap; or else by a wire fitted from it for the hinder part
of the neck.

CHAP. VI. Yard.
THose that have them cut off close to the belly, Yard.
prepare a pipe made of wood or latin, let the hole which is through it be as
big as a finger, and a wide brink at top; which when you have need apply to the
Os Pectinis.

CHAP. IX. Hands.
IT sometimes happens by reason of some tendons and nerves being cut, Hands.
the hand cannot be lifted up; for which an instrument is to be made of a
strong plate of Latin, lined in the inner side with silk, or such lik, it is to
be placed on the wrist, that it may come to the palm of the hand, or first
joint of the singers, it must be tied on with strings: the instrument is to
come almost about the wrist; an instrument may also be made for the thumbs or
finger; if need be artificial hands may also be made, as also Legs, the
former are seldom of use, the other frequent; some of these are made fast in
the form of sound Legs; others small all downward from a little under the seat
where the stump of the Leg is to lie; they are to be tied on to the thighs
with fit boulsters, and small pillows for the knee to rest upon.

Thus by Divine assistance we have passed through the Four parts of
Surgery: And shall now speak something of Encearing and Embalming; and so
concluding our Surgery work, enter upon an Appendix.

SECT. II. CHAP. I. Encearing and Embalming.
ALL our former Discourse has had a living body for its subject, Encearing and
Embalming.
though hurt; Here we are to deal with it having paid its last debt to nature,
and having undergone its greatest encounter, is overcome by the King of terror,
Death, and so lies breathless; where it is not only a certain prognostic of
our following after, but also a monitor to prepare for the like condition, for
after death there is no place found for repentance; something might be said
for laudablenesse of it both from Authors, Jewish, Christians, and Heathen: I
set the Jew in the front, because as far as is discovered, they were the
first practicers of it; but we need not mention these, having (which is most
warrantable) Scripture instances.

For the first, there needs little to be discoursed for after the passages of
the body, is well stopped up, either with hurds alone, or dipped in the composition
prepared for the cear-cloth, and upon them clothes applied, dipped in the same,
and after lapped up in 1, 2, or 3 cearcloths, which may be either of sheets, or
new cloth made for that purpose; if but in one, cord the body before; but if
two or three, cord it upon the first. Some before the stopping of the passages
use sharp glysters of wine, vinegar, or salt water, and so hang up the body
with the hands, that so the excrement may issue out, and so renew the glysters.

But for Embalming, having all things in a readiness, as fit instruments,
spunges, stuffes, linnens, etc. then embowel the corpse, removing all the part
contained in the belly, breast, and head, letting them presently be buried,
(saving the heart, which is to be embalmed with the body:) Unless it happen the
Corpse to be embalmed be distant from the place its to be interred, and the
friends desire they may be brought thither, then follow this course, (which I
took with the bowels of the Right Honorable Robert Lord Brook) I caused the
Cooper to make a strong light barrel fit for to contain them, and to pitch it
within very well; which being done, I put in all the bowels, etc. into it, with
bran and some salt; then he putting on the head, I caused him to pitch it
well, after anointed the top with oils after described, and so it kept till
the time of his interring, without any offense, which was a month or six weeks
time. After you have freed the venters, and dried them clean from all the
blood with clothes and spunges, then you may wash them Cum acet. vini, in qu.
infund. absinth. rutae, colocynthid. add. alum. and good store of salt, and
some Aloes: the whole body may be washed with spunges dipped in Aquavitae and
strong vinegar; the venture is to be filled with this or the like: Calam.

APPENDIX.
CHAP. I.
HAving by Divine assistance (as we are able) finished the Art of Surgery,
we had thought there to have rested; but considering there was several
Diseases of the body, which seeming more properly to belong to the Science of
Physic, yet was such as wherein the Surgeon was frequently employed: And
again, diverse others which befell men at Sea, where Physicians seldom venture
themselves, and Chirurgions were only present; therefore we resolved for to
touch them as briefly as we could, and as well as poor abilities would permit.
And therefore shall they be here delineated, beginning with the French pox.

CHAP. II. De Morbo Gallico.
THe causes of this is diverse: Morbo Gallico.
as, 1 A specific or occult quality referred to God, at whose command this
judgment has followed the sin of whoredom. 2 Copulating with persons
infected. 3 By communicating of vapors.

In the beginning there is a lassitude and dullness over the whole body, Signs.
pain betwixt the joints, especially in the night; Buboes in the groins,
Pustles in the forehead, malign and callous Ulcers in the privities,
hoarsnesse, knots upon the bones, corruption of the bones before Ulcers appear,
pallat hangs down, falling of the hair, and chops in the hands and feet.

If it be newly taken, Prognost.
accompanied with few pustles, small wandering pain, the body be young, and in
good case, and the time of the year be seasonable, cure is easy; but if
inveterate, associated with fixed pain of the head, rottenness of the bones,
bad Ulcers in a body, maciated and weak, the cure has been diverse times
attempted without success, very hard, if not incurable, especially if the
party have a Pthisis or Hectic.

A good diet is to be appointed them first prepare the body, Sarsap. j.

purging let blood, says Zacutus; others before, either prepar. or purging, but
this is not to be admitted, if there be Bubo's suppurated. If there be
Pustulaes or Scabs, it is good to apply Leeches. After this, if you would cure
by sweating, then make this decoct. Lign. vitae, Sarsapar. an. lbs. Cortic.

If there need more inciding or concocting add. rad. Helen. vj. bacc. juniper.

dose; you may add Sulphur. Aurat. diaphor. gr. xij. The third day let him rest
from sweating, and purge with this: Mercur. d. sal. Antimon. gr. iiij. diagrid.
gr. viij. cum conser. ros. f. bol. vel pil. Cathol. j. Mercur. d. gr. x. Misce
f. pil. Then sweat again 7 days; and again omit one or two to purge, and so do
till you have cured. The second decoct is to be for ordinary drink. The time
of their sweating is to be two hours, if they be able; after which they are to
be dried with clothes, rubbing the whole side hard, and the pained softly; two
hours after let them dine sparingly, four or six hours after let them sweat
again.

Secondly, to cure by Salivation, you are to use either means inward or
outward. Inwardly, use these pills, praecip. rub. Cinabaris, an. j. Castor pull.

continue till the 7 day; in the mean time using nothing but posset drink for
beer, and mutton and veale for meat; panacea aurea is also excellent, which is
compounded of equal quantities of Croc. Metal. and mercur. d. which does not
only cause salivation, but also vomiting and purge, which I have used with
good success. Outwardly, is by fumigations of Cinabaris, which is by many not
approved of, unless it be for a particular member, to dry up ill conditioned
Ulcers.

Thirdly, by Emplast. and Unguents: for unguents, take this for use; Adipis
gallin. porcin. vacoini, an. iiij. ol. laur. ij. ol. lilior. iij. mercur. vivi

servetur in vase vitreaco ad usum. These are thus to be used, after general
evacuations, let the Patient be in a close room, or else where a stove is,
which is excellent, or it may be done in bed. If the party be strong, anoint
before eating; if weak, an hour before give some gelly at first; anoint only
the joints, as the wrists, elbows, knees, anckles, and shoulders, rubbing them
hard; after lapping them up warm with carded cotton, stuffs or brown paper.
After if the party be strong, anoint the Emunctories, and the whole spine of
the back, shunning the noble parts. In strong bodies anoint twice a day, 6
hours after meat; ( Hild. but once, Hildanus.
and that 3 or 4 hours before dinner:) if weak, once a day, or giving a day or
two to gather strength; when they begin to flux, cease your Unction. As for
plasters, they are seldom in use, unless for particular parts: This is to be
observed, that Apostemes and Ulcers are to be mundified, and carious bones
removed, before the cure can be perfected.

Observe, accidents are carefully to be withstood, and universal means used.

CHAP. VII. De Scorbuto.
IN which we shall be as brief as may be, Scorbuto.
and apply our selves to be as profitable as we can to the Sea Surgeon.

It Is a disease wherein the Spleen is affected, being depraved of its proper
use, which is, not rightly concocting the proper aliment; or, an ill habit of
the body arising from a melancholy humor; yet that crude, serous, ichorous, and
associated with phlegm possessing the whole body, especially the Hypochondria,
offending not only in quantity, but quality, being peculiarly corrupted, the
external causes, especially at Sea, being salt meats, want of fresh clothing,
nastiness and foulnes of Cabins, being long time at sea, and ill air.

Signs are many, Signs.
a general lasiness and il disposition of all parts and faculties saving the
stomach, which is often better then ordinary; discoloring of the skin, with
darkish blew spots, especially the thighs, swelling of the legs and thighs,
stinking breath, spitting, difficulty of breathing, especially when they move;
tumor, putrefaction and blecding of the gumms, looseness of teeth, coldness and
stiffness of the sinews and legs, cramp, Atrophia of the thighs and legs,
fever, the pulse and urine various. Many more might be added, as great
swelling tumors of the thighs, etc.

Good diet is necessary, Cure.
but at Sea cannot especially in long voyages be obtained, therefore where they
touch, all necessary provision is to be made that is to be had; being sure
they take with them such comfortable things as may be useful, as wine, sngar,
spices, etc. which as there is need, are to be called for by the Surgeon,
who as he is to be careful about the sick, so also to see who is missing,
and to be frequently asking of the health, that so the disease may be timely
taken, and great danger prevented; seeing withal their Cabbins be sweet. It Is
controverted whether purging should not precede bleeding, all holding a glyster
should be first given; with submission, I think, a bole before is better, for
by that means the stomach and first ways will be cleansed from those
crudities which after bleeding may be drawn up, if not purged away. Elect.

bol. the next day, if there be strength bleed first the Hemorods, then arm, but
not too much. The next day after, humors should be begun to be prepared, but
this at Sea seldom used, though it may be performed for 3 or 4 days, cum
Cremor. Tar. vel Tartar. vitriol. in aq. Melis. absinth. and sir. Scelo^yr b.
Foresti. For purging, it must rather be gentle, and often reiterated, then
strong; those in use at Sea, are these; Pil. Euphorb. Ruffi, Cambogia, Aquil.
laxativa id est Mercur. dull. (especially if there be a fullness or swelling; as
also pil. Tartar. Quer. Let your dose be according to the strength of the
Patient. After the exhibition of the purge, prepare for the Patient an oatmeal
cawdle of beer or Wine, with the yolk of an egg, and a little butter, and given
to drink, or some broth made of currants and raisins, with some nutmegs, mace,
etc. for his ordinary drink, barley water is not amiss, with some few drops of
Cinnamon water, or juice or syrup of Lem. or ol. vitriol. and Sacchar. In his
drink may be infused dried wormwood.

For specific medicines, these are in use. Sir. vel. potius Succ. Limon.
Tamarinds, Lymes, Oranges, Turnips; these are excellent preservatives,
especially the juice of lemons, as also Turnips, which may be extracted after
baking, and with Sugar sweetened or boiled into a syrup. Syrup. scelotyr. is

is good, as many drops as will make a cup of beer, water, or rather wine a
little sower: and observe, some of all the former things may be added to your
purges; Diatrion piperion first and last is good; as also Theriac. diatessar.
Land. conser. ros. absinth. cum ol. vitrioli, green Ginger, rosa so^is, aq.
absinth. etc. To sweat after purging, use Theriac. Land. CC. usti. Aurum vitae
diaph. sal. ahsinth. etc. Here is a description of an Aurum vitae much praised
and used, having had many testimonies; Q. V. Auri d^ssol. in aq. regis deinde
affunde ol. Tartar. donec aq. regis lb j. albescat postremo post decantationem
aq. regis, aq. Pura ablue sedimentum deinde calcina. S. A. dosis gr. ij. ad s.
This is good in the Plague, and all diseases wherein sweating is necessary.
Urine, if necessary, is also to be provoked.

Extreme costiveness being an ordinary associate, use Glysters, Supos. Purges;
especially Mercur. d. A glyster may be framed of a decoct. of the roots of
Althaea, Sem. Lini. and faengr. vel fursur. to a pint, of which add Hier. pic.
ij. Sal. Com. Coch.. also broth from the beef kettle with the foresaid things
in stead of hier. picr. pull. arthritie. j. If you find a stoppage, let a fine
ragg dipped in oil be carried up with your pipe, as far as you can, and then draw
back your pipe a little, and so deliver it: If there be inflammation or
excoriation in the bowels, use a glyster composed only brann and dear, or
swines fat, for 2 or 3 days, then adding acatiae j. vel gallar. ij.

Having briefly done with the disease, we come to the symptoms which are not
all necessary to be treated of, as Horstius well observes; for the disease
being cured, many of them will vanish; (some reck on up 43, others 23.) We
shall begin as he, so also Woodall, with those

CHAP. VIII. Of the mouth.
AND here Lotions are to be sharp and astringent, if the gums be much tumefied,
stink, and be putrified, then first lance them, after rub them well with a cloth

CHAP. X. Ulcers.
BEcause in this disease the body is diversely affected, therefore the medication
of the Ul^ers may require the like, if there be a hydropicall inflation of the
whole body, then Ulcers will require more desiccation, as ung. diapomph. de
Minio, rub. desiccativ. alb. camphor. cris usti Secretum: If the body be
consumed, then use Basilic. L^. Arcei, ung. Nicotian. and observe where
obstructions of Liver and Spleen remain, there the Ulcers are difficult of
curation. This is much to be admired, that after the disease has been of long
continuance, yet coming on shore, without much ado has cured them; and
observe, few diseases happen to Seamen, but what the Scurvy has a part in,
therefore a preservation from this, would free them from the danger of most
other diseases. We shall conclude this only, describing some proper medicines
which may be for use when you come to land in any place. decoct. Hord. lb j.
vin. albi, iiij. rapha. agrestis minutim concisi, ij. fol. cochlear. M iij.
contusa and expressa sine coctione in Saccum transferantur de quo mane and
vesperi cyathus assumatur. vel absinth. granor. juniper. contusorum, an. Mj.
lac. caprin. lb iiij. coq. ad. 3 partis cons. colaturae add. croc. pull. j.
denu^ ebulliant fervore uno aut altero secund^ colentur. Give of it 3 times a
day^ morning, noon, and at going to bed. For want of goats, milk, sheep, or
cowes, will serve; Wierus saith^ this has cured an infinite: or take Scurvy
grass, stamp and strain it with posset drink made of thinn scummed milk,
turned with red or white wineger, using only so much as will turn it. Let the
Patient drink of it half a pint every morning fasting for 14 days together,
forbearing strong beer, salt meats, milk, fruit, and cheese, letting the drink
at meats be whey if it can be had, or else small ale; if the teeth be loose,
for 2 or 3 mornings brooklime.

CHAP. XI. Fluxes of the Belly.
Diverse are these Fluxes; Fluxes of the belly.
Fernel. reduces them to 4, Caeliaca, when the excrements are cast out white,
light, and equal, says Hild. or when the Aliment received, is east out crude
and imperfectly concocted. The causes are, first obstruction of the Liver,
Spleen, and Mesaraicks, which hinders distribution of the Chylus. 2 The
weakness of the retentive quality. 3 Too much gurmandizing, as also eating
green fruit; hence children are frequently troubled with it. The 2 is,

CHAP. XII. Lienteria.
When the meat is cast out as it was received, Lienteria.
and is caused either from a crude pituite, and glutinous humor in the stomach
and intestines; and so the expulsive faculty is above measure stirred up, or
from the weakness of the retentive faculty, which is frequently deadly: These
two only we see differ in degrees, and therefore may in cure be put together.

If there be strength, first give a vomit, as Sal. vitriol. ij. vel gum.
cambog. gr. xij. vel Aquilae vitae 1. gr. Mercur. vitae gr. iiij. After which,
if he can, let him sleep fasting; if not, give him a little aq. Cinam. but
rather let that alone, and the next day give him a gentle purge with rhab. and
myrob. vel pil. mastic. then corroborate cum aq. cinam. and give conser. of
slowes, or quinces; or of this; conser. ros. antiq. vj. Theriac. opt. ij. Mivae
cydon. q. s. f. opiat. de qua capiat. s. mane. drinking nothing upon it;
outwardly to the stomach you may apply a bag of wormwood, Mints besprinkled
with rose water and vinegar. Here Mitbrid. nutmegs, diatrion. piper. diatessar.
are good; if need be, laudanum is to be exhibited; if flux continue, and rest
be wanting, Dos. gr. iij. external gum. Tachamahaca. is excellent.

CHAP. XIII. Diarrhaea.
THis is 3 kind, and is most frequently, Diarrhaea.
if not always Symptomatical, and therefore beneficial to the body. If it be
not of too long continuance. Some define it to be a waterish flux, and sometimes
mixed with humors and slime; in others, all humors are cast out, especially
choler, yet corrupted, without pain.

This is not to be presently stayed, Cure.
but rather let alone 4 days at least, or till the Patient is sensible he
grows weak, then you may administer a purge; as, rhab. torref. ( i. e. dried as
Tobacco) ij. or the infusion thereof in aq. Card. vel. vin. aut aq. S. vel
rhab. electi j. Myrob. citri. s. Santal. citri. and rubr. an. s. infund. in aq.
plantag. in express. dissol. rhabar. pull. s. sir. rosar. j. Vomiting here may
be beneficial, sometimes to revel and evacuate the morbifick matter; and if
strength be present, and blood abound, open a vein; Yet in the beginning. After
purging, use this Glyster, Hord. integri, p. ij. furfur. macri, and rosar. rub.
an. p. j. Liquir. ros. and passul integra. an. j. coq. ad lb j. in colat^
dissol. Sacc. alb. j. and vitel. ovor. Nij^ f. Enema. Apply warm clothes to
belly and fundament; and if these prevail not, use Laudanum: thi^ opiat is
good, conser. ros. antiq. s. Cydonior. cond. j. pull. Tormentil. j. bol. Arm. s.
cum Saecc. f. bol. which reiterate often.

CHAP. XIV. Dysenteria.
It Is a bloody or purulent dejection with pains and torments of the belly,
Dysenteria
proceeding from an ulcer of the intestines, caused from acrid and biting
humors, i.e. all kinds of choler and salt phlegm; this comprehends under it all
kind of bloody fluxes. Hildanus reduces them to 4 kinds: Signs.
1 As when blood comes forth sincere; and this happens after dismembring, or
obstruction of the Menses, or Hemorods. To cure which, if the sick be plethorick
and strong, open a vein, and repeat it, and let the diet be sparing and thin.
The 2 kind is, when the flux is like water, wherein flesh has been washed;
after 3 or 4 days purge with the infusion in diarrhea, of rhei, Myr. etc.
after give diarrhod. abbat. Troch. de rhab. 3 Kind, is, when that which is
ejected is black; these are improperly called Dysenteries; therefore we come to
the 4 kind, which is the proper.

The causes and signs are already handled, Prognost.
we come to some Prognostics. Sometimes it is contagious and kills many, if
from adust choler, deadly; if it happen after long diseases; if upon it come a
dropsy, blew spots behind the ear, if not appeased by fit remedies; if there
come like pieces of flesh, a hicket; after long continuance of the Flux great
thirst, deadly; if there be belchings, changing of the Excrements to the
better, proceed from choler, it is good.

This happening as well at Land as at Sea, Cure.
we shall therefore prescribe first what diet, and what of it may be had at
Sea, may be taken. Those things are to be used that are of good norishment,

two spoonfuls, and as much Sugar as will sweeten it, and let the Patient drink

given in your glyster is excellent: Take heed of forcing the belly when you go

It Is a pain in the Colon, and is either from wind, phlegm and choler;
sometimes the worms and hardness of the excrements; as also inflammation of the
bowels.

If wind, it is easy cured, Signs.
the pain is especially on the left side, the belly is extended, there is heard
a murmuring noise. If of phlegm, there is a biting and pricking pain; in the
former is also vomiting, nauseousnesse, as also a retention of the Faeces. If
from choler, there is great dryness, immoderate heat, vomiting choler, the
urine fiery, and mouth bitter. If from inflammation, there is burning fever, a
sharp heat in the bowels, often vomiting choler, insatiable thirst, loosnesse,
suppression of urine.

If it give not place to fit remedies, Prognost.

beginning with an emollient glyster, after which a carminative and discussing.

CHAP. XVII. De Iliaco dolor. Iliacuo dolor.

THis is a miserable disease, and herein the Patient dies miserably, in the
vomiting of his own excrements; the pain is in the small guts, below the navil,
says Zacutus. Others above, and toward the right side, urin suppressed,
coldness of the extreme part, and whole body, and great difficulty of breathing.

If there be with it a distillation of urin, Prognost.

they stink much, as also the wind which is discharged upwards and downwards,
it is ill and deadly; if the pain remove, it is of less danger.

It Is caused either of hardness of the excrements, inflammation, or winding of
the bowels.

For the first, Cure.
give emollient glysters made of the decoction of Althaea Malu. viol. etc. or

not, set a pair of bellows to the fundament, and blow therein wind, and after
cast in an emollient glyster with Troch. alhandal. bullets besmeared with

CHAP. XIX. Arthrididis Curatio.
ARhtritis is the Gout, Arthrididis curatio.
a general denomination, therefore comprehends all pains in the joints,
though there is and may be several names given according to the joint
affected, yet all may receive cure from this, except that commonly called
Sciatica, which shall next be treated of.

It Is caused from sharp, salt, and serous humors, inordinat diet; sometimes
it is hereditary, the humors have in them an occult malign quality.

It Is generally hard to be cured. Cure.
Three things herein is to be performed. 1 To hinder the matter flowing to the
affected part. 2 To remove that impacted. And 3 to ease pain in the mean time.
For the first of these: 1 It Is most fit to open a vein, if there be plenty, and
phlegm abound not. If the right arm be affected, open one in the left; if the
right foot, then the right arm, etc. if there be strength take enough at once,
if not, reiterate it, taking less. For purging, it is to be used not only at
the beginning, but after: but observe first, they are to be strong, otherwise
they will rather move then evacuate humors, and that which is moved will fall
upon the part, and cause more pain. 2 When you purge, apply defensitives to the
part, and rowlers wet in oxycrate. 3 In your purges let there be some
specificks, vomiting is also exceeding good in those that can easily vomit, but
it must be gentle and after purge. The purges are these, Pull. Arthriticus.
fol. Sen. Turbith. gum. Hermod. diagrid. oss. Human. calcinat. an. s. f. pull.
subtle. dos. j. You may frame it into an Electuary with Sugar dissol. in a
convenient water, as aq. Ivae arthritic. elect. Caryocostinum, pil. Cath. j.
Zalapium diaphaenic. diacartha. After purging use Diaphoreticks. Yet here is to
be noted, if the Gout invade with a Fever, hot Sudorificks are not to be
administered but such as are temperate; as Cor. Cer. crud. vel usti in aq. Card.
ben. vel ipsum. Receive a preparation of it which is excellent. Take Hearts horn
and burn it white, after which extinguish it in Eldern vinegar, do thus 6
times, dosis j. ad ij. it causes sweat more then Bezoar. Here also may be nsed
Antimon. diaphor. and Aurum vitae. but in diuturnall affects, and where a Fever
is absent, you may use the decoct. of Sarsapar. China, Sasafr. adding some
cooling herbs; and after sweating take some broth altered with the same herbs,
viz. Cicbor. endiv. acetos. borag. Ruland.
Ruland commends this as tried, Centaur. min. Mij. rad. Asari, ij. bull. in aq.

Herinus advises to fweat with a decoct of Sarsap. for 40 days, but you had
then best intermit every 3, 4, or 6 day, and purge. Forestus highly commends
rad. Forestus.
Bardanae boiled in Beer, and administered hot: Baths are good in the beginning
of the Fluxion. Betwixt times of purging give Juleps that do cool and
thicken, yea, if necessity be, exhibit Narcoticks, the fittest is Theriac.
recens often reiterated, s. vel j. cumtamillo bol. opt. Landau. Parac. is also
good.

Now because pain is most in this, therefore such things as ease pain is to be
applied; as milk warm used with stuffs, or rather milked upon the part, or a

latter; in the use of which, one in Leieestershire did not only grow so famous
as to commence Doctor-frog, but also got a good estate, the receipt where of was
communicated to me by a near friend of his, which here take with the use. Take
the spawn of Frogs in it is season, fill an earthen pot, therewith cover it well
with a slate or tyle, and set it in the ground half a foot deeper then the pot
is high, covering it with earth; let it stand for 2 or 3 weeks, in which time
its turned to water, then strain it, and keep it in bottles; which use thus;
heat upon a Chaffingdish of coals very hot, as much as is needful, and with
woollen stuffs bathe the pained part very well, and as hot as can be endured,
after dip a Scarlet cloth or red in it hot about the grieved part, and upon
that a dry cloth, and so go to bed. If need be, dress it so again the next
morning.

For a Narcotick, in case of necessity to be used, receive this; Spir. viniper
croci infusionem flauescentis, iiij. Camphor. j. bull. parum dcind. dissolve
opii j. eoque liquore pars dolens illinatur: Tutum, and efficacissimum est
remedium. For repellers, unless in the very beginning, and flux be hot, they
are not proper alone, therefore to be mixed with Anodynes. For derivation
after sufficient evacuation of the body, the Leeches to the part affected
especially if the veins be swoollen is exceeding good. Resolvers may be used
in various forms; as ol. Castor. Scorpion, ol. cerae, ol. ex ossibus humanis:

which Varandaeus cured a great and contumacious tumor of the knee, which other
Physicians could not effect, with purgings, sweatings, and outward aphlicatis
ons; note this, that men being of various temperament, and also humors, that
especial care be had to the choice of proper medicaments.

Sometimes in the Gout there happens knotty bunches, which if they be old are
of hard curation, if new, may be thus conquered. Use first emollient decoct.
for Foment. after use ol. Ranar. which is this, ranar. fluviat. Nxij.

lead thin beat, and besmeared with brimstone, and quicksilver is excellent, if
applied a month together.

ALthough this may be comprehended under the former, yet because of the

strong purges are to be given, both Galenicall and Chymicall. Rondelet commends
vomiting rather then purging after sufficient evacuation. For externals, at the
first use such as resolve, beginning with those more gentle, and less hot

If the pain be pertinacious, apply vesicatories on the hip, make fontinels
either in the hamb, or outside of the leg; and if you suspect it to proceed
from a Catarrh, make another in the occiput, or behind the ears, which is
excellent in all effects from distillations. Through the whole cure glysters
are to be frequently used; as vini generos. lb s. ol. nuc. and rutac. an. iij.
ol. Terebinth. s. Misce f. Enem. use it as often as pain requires. If the pain
proceed from choler or hot humors, then the pain is more sharp and pricking,
and every other day worse; the body is lean, he is of bilious constitution,
young; if the time be hot, the pain is more hot and sharp. Therefore it is fit
to let blood; use purger of choler sometimes gentle, otherwhile strong, by
adding diagrid. let julep be cooling, glyster the like, with molifying, bath
with milk, noting that you are rather to incrassate then open. If the pain be
extreme, use Narcot. inward especially diacodium, which eases pain, hinders
fluxion, and incrassates the humor; for outward Medicines use to anoint with
ol. ros. Lilior, viol. Cham. amygd. d. and Catap. ex Lactue. solan. Endiv. far.

causes a consumption, for which use nonstantly a decoction of Lig. sanct. and
rad. Sarsapar, which is exceeding effectual in this desperate case.

and it may be doubtful whether the Sword or it have cut off most. If we
consider what havoc it made, not only in Armies, both sides can testify, but
also in Garrisons throughout the Kingdom; which sufficiently evinceth the
contagiousnesse thereof.

If the Causes be inquired after, Causes.
an Army will answer for one, where there being so much filth and nastiness in
diet, worse lodging, unshifted apparel, can hardly continue long without
contagious diseases; but this is not all, the malignity of the air, joined with
its intemperature, may be another; but that which is the chiefest, is the
finger of God. If you would have a definition wherein internal causes are
involved, receive this; It Is a putrid continued Fever, both malignant and
contagious, which arises from pituit and choleric humors heaped up and
putrified in the stomach; and first ways, i. e. intestines, midriff, and parts
adjoining, whence follows a notable alteration of the blood in the liver and
whole body.

Signs are many, Signs.
sudden loss of strength without evident cause, and therewith, sometimes
swooning and frequent faintness, pain in the head, stomach, and joints,
dejection of the appetite, singing of the ears, and difficulty of hearing
sometimes, vomiting frequently, fullness of the stomach, pulse sometimes weak,
quick, and intermitting, other whiles strong, as I have often observed; as also
spots of several colors, large, and in abundance.

Horstius in lib. de Feb. p. 54. advises first to make a strong purge, Cure.
as Mechoac. opt. j. Cremor. Tartar. s f. pull and exhib. cum brodio pisorum.
And this in the very beginning, unless there be inclination to vomit, then to
provoke it, and after to let blood. But with submission, being there is a great
deal of malignity in it, and that so fiercely assaulting the spirits, it is good
first to exhibit some good Alexiteria to expel this malign Diathesis; For this
I have found (which is others experience as well as my own) that if presently
upon complaint made, a Cordial was given, and sweat provoked, has, in not
many hours given a delivery from the distemper, which may well be, as one
says, by discussing and expelling Miasma, and Inquinamentum putredinale,
before it has formented or assimulated the whole mass. And by this means only
was cured that fatal disease the Sweating fick: This was the course which I
took, before I was privy to others method, which by Gods blessing so well
succeeded, that of 700 and above Soldiers, and many inhabitants, there was
very few dyed, though few escaped the disease; and many of the Inhabitants died
under hand of others, though very able. Upon a complaint, I prescribed and gave
them a Cordial, then if the stomach was full, or they inclined to vomit, I
gave one, if not a purge, and after let blood. I have with good success let
blood first, and presently after giving a Cordial, and then as before. The
Cordial usually was compounded of aq. Card. b. acetosae, Scabios. Angelie.

nauseousness, pain, heat, bitterness, and sadness was removed. For purges, I
gave strong at the first, more gentle afterward; as pull. Arthritic. j. in aq.
Endiv. iij. add. Elect. diaph. iij. and Sir. rosar. j. or infusions with
Electuaries; sometimes with these I administered Cordialls. For bleeding, I did
in most take away largely, especially in those the quantity of whose blood
distended the vessels, and was burdensome to nature; for if fullness of blood
be dangerous, how much more when it is corrupted; wherefore as Gallen says,
Lib. 11. de Method. med. It Is most safe in all putrid Fevers to let blood. This
may be done till the 4 day, the Hemorhods may be opened after. Nay, I have let
blood in and after the 6 day, though they have been full of spots, this may be
done if there be ingens Morbus and virium robur. Only this is to be noted,
where Cacochymia prevails above Plethora, the quantity must be sparingly
diminished, and the quality amended. If a reason be demanded, why we let blood
when the spots appear, the answer is this, because they being symptomaticall
rather then Critical, and only putrid vapors, then the matter it self, do
discover abundance of putrefaction within, fit to be in part drawn out by
phlebotomy.

Hence I conceive, the spots appearing, and so daunting the Physicians from
bleeding, was the cause of the death of so many inhabitants, for they have
wondered how I durst do it. Vesicatories applied to the wrists I have found
ever excellent, if applied in time. I used that of Horstius, which is this,
Cantharid s. Terebinth. ij. oliban. Myrrh. mastic. Camphor. an. s. ol. ros.
cer. an. q. s. f. Empl. They may be applied safely at any time, except on a
Critical day: The diet is to be thin, meat not to be allowed; nature having
enough to do to eoncoct the morbifick matter, and therefore cannot be safely
taken off from that employment to concoct meat; therefore give broths altered
with the shavings of Hearts horn, and cool herbs, as Sorrel, Borage, and opening
roots; for exchange, use water-grewel, pannado, caudle, mace ale, or small
beer, bread, and nutmeg boiled together, and sweetened with Sugar. In hot fits
forbid not the moderat use of beer if warm, least the preternaturall heat prey
to much upon the radical moisture; if it be not well boiled, posset drink is
better, wherein Hearts horn is decocted, unto which add Spir. vitriol. The
decoction of Hearts horn in the Calenture is good, adding thereto some Alker.
and Sir. Acetos. citri. For preservative, I never used for my self any other
then wormwood beer; but for the common Soldiers, they may take a lesser
quantity of the former Cordials, or eat rue and sage with bread and butter, the
rue and sage they may smell to; an infusion of the two former in wine vinegar
with wormwood, is a good preservative. For Diaphoreticks in this disease, which
I had almost forgot, beside those Cordials set down, Essentia auri, or CC. ust.

CHAP. XXII. De Dolor Dentium.
RIverius Tom. 2. Sect. 5. Cap. 1. Dolor. Dentium.
upon Galens assertion in his lib. 5. de compos. med. cap. 8. and 16. de usu
partium cap. 2. as also lib. de ossibus, cap. 5. makes this conclusion; dolor
igitur non solum nervulis et membranulae interiori, sed etiam ipsi dentium
substantia contingit. Which in brief amounts to this, That the pain is not only
in the small nerves and membranes, but also in the substance of the tooth,
though it be controverted; I shall not oppose it. It Is caused from the flowing
in of humors which are cold and pituit, or else hot, serous, salt and sharp into
the parts aforesaid, as also the gumms; most commonly from the head, sometime
from the inferior parts; it is also caused from wind, and then the pain is most
cruel, and almost unsufferable, as also from the worms. For signs, they need
not be set down.

First, Cure.
the pain is to be eased, if it be much, by Narcoticks; as cum opiigr. ij. cum
croc. aequali part in bombac. indita vel pil. ex opio and Theriac. Andromac.
Ol. Buxi some think has a stupefactive quality, and is excellent.

Secondly, the humor offending is to be evacuated by bleeding, if it be from a
cold cause take away the less, unless there appear signs of Plethora, and
then more may be drawn. If it be from a hot cause, which may be known by the
intensnesse of pain, and the constitution, then take away liberally, for upon
experience, as in all pains, so especially in this its most excellent. It Is to
be done on the same side: the next day, if the humor be hot, purge with
Potions, but other-wayes with Pills; if pain continue, use Cups with
scarifications upon the shoulder blades, but especially Vesicatories under the
ears; to stay Fluxion, apply to the tempies Emp. contra Ruptur. or make a
plaster of alume, gals, and some pitch; or Nucum cupress. ros. rub. sem.

If it be from a hot cause, then distill into the ear vinegar; in a cold the

nettle, with a little nutmeg and saffron in equal parts of red wine and
vinegar, and hold hot in the mouth is good; and though it may at first seem to
increase the pain, yet within a little while it will give ease; Masticatories
is good: Stop them if they be hollow with oil of Cloves, Camphyre, Thyme; or
ol. Caryoph. j, solue Camphorae gr. viij. and use it. If there be worms, then
Aloes j. Campbor. s. aq. vitae s. Misce. If these will not prevail, then they
are to be drawn either with Pulicans or Percers, deviding first the gum with
the Fleame. Others draw them out by Medicaments, this bearing away the bell,
Elleboraster the leaves of it being beaten, and the tooth rubbed with it,
covering the rest lest you touch them, with wax. To conclude, some burn the
hollow teeth with a wire fit, and others burn them in the ear, which have both
been very successful. For the mending of their blackness after they be
scaled, if it be necessary, then use the ashes of Tobacco, or powder of Tyles,
adding some cloves, nutmegs, and mix them with honey.

CHAP. XXIII. Immoderate bleeding at the Nose.
It Is a Symptom rather then a Disease; Immoderate bleeding at the Nose.
now every Symptom has its Morbus; and that is either Organicall, which is
twofold, viz. the opening the mouths, or rarifying of the vessels; or Common,
which is also twofold, viz. the breaking or erosion of the same. The cause of
these is blood, Cause.
either exceeding in quantity, which opens the mouths or breaks the veins; or
else in quality, and so it rarifies or erodes them: These have also their cause,
viz. Outward, and that either immediate, as blows, falls, and wounds, etc. or
Mediate, and immoderation in the six Nonnaturalls, which heateth, attenuateth
and increases the blood. It Is sometimes Critical, otherwhiles Symptomaticall;
the first being either with a Fever, and this must be warily dealt with;
sometimes without, when nature being over-burdened labors to exonerate it self,
and this is good. Symptomaticall, happen especially in Chronicall diseases.

If by opening the mouths of the vessels, Signs.
the nose bleeds plentifully (as also when they are broken) the face is red,
the veins distended. If by erosion, there is ill habit of body, and it gusheth
out violently. If from rarefaction, it comes slowly, and thin. If caused from
Liver, Spleen, Head, there is pain in those parts. If from the womb, the Menses
are stopped, and it may be good.

If it flow much, Prognost.
be of color pale, livid, green, or brownish, if from debility of the brain.
If it be sudden and violent, and accompanied with swoonings, and cold of
extreme parts, mortal; if from the womb hard to cure.

Here bleeding is necessary on the same side it bleeds on, it must be by
degrees, often stopping the orifice a while together, but it must be done
warily; this I have found prove effectual, when the Patient has been given
over as forlorn. Either before or after this is to be used frictions, ligatures
of the extreme parts; Cups upon the same side of the Hypochondries; the nose
bleed, or a vein opened in the feet is good. Forestus.
Forestus applied the Cups to the feet, and found it effectual. Zacutus,
Zacutus.
when nothing else would prevail, applied an actual Cautery to the soals of
each foot. Apply to the forehead and temples a plaster made of gypsum with
vinegar and aq. Sper. ranar. or bole. Cast cold water upon the face
unexpectedly. To the nose, apply upon long tents some of the powder prescribed
to stay bleeding, mixed with the white of an egg, and juice of plantane, burn
their own blood under their nose. Inwardly take this, diascord. iiij. philon.
Persic. j. Sir. pap. alb. j. aq. papau. err. aut potius Sper. ranar. iij. take

often, and mixed with other Medicines. For the temples, etc. hog dung applied
to the temples and smelled to, Ass dung used as the other, nay given in broth,
drinks, and formed into tablets with Sugar, but amongst the rest, says
Riverius this is the most present remedy, Spicae Nardi j. in powder with broth,
plantane water, or other fit liquor. Many use a dried toad, bloodstones, etc.
but a special Friend of mine told me, when upon a Flux at the nose all means
had been used by 3 or 4 Physicians, and he given over, he himself being well
skilled in Physic prepared a purge and took, and by that he had had a stool it
was stayed. Indeed Riverius advises to an inveterate flux to purge once a week
with this or the like; Tamarind. s. fol. plantag. Mj. coq. ad iiij. in colat.

CHAP. XXIV. Haemorhods diseases.
TO these veins do happen especially two distempers, that is, Hemorhods.
their immoderate flowing and suppression; with the latter is associated pain,
inflammation, and Tumor. For the first, it is not necessary to set down the
sign^s. The Cure

Is to be attempted not suddenly, Cure.
but when they have continued long, strength begins to fail, the lively color
of the body decays. For cure, bleeding is to be drawn by repetition from the
Arm; for it is certain Phlebotomia in omni sanguinis profluvio revulsorium est
remedium. Here Frictions and Ligatures, and Cups are necessary to be used, and
these often repeated. Purge gently choler, after incrassate the blood, and
bind up the veins by fitting juleps, opiats. These Pills also may be used;
pil. de Bdell. j. Troch. de carab. and de Ter. Sigil. an j. cum Mucilag. sem.
Cydon. extrac. cum aq. ros. f. mas. Pilular. of which take j. twice a day
before dinner and supper. For Topics, a fomentation of mullen boiled in Smiths
water, or red wine is excellent. Vng. Comitissae is good, anointing with it the
Hemorhods and back. What is used in the bleeding of the nose may be here
beneficial; this Syrup is highly commended; Succ. plantag. verben. depuratae

dos. iij. Three times a day, in the morning, four a clock afternoon, and three
hours after supper; take it cold.

CHAP. XXV. Hemorrhodes.
IN the suppression of them, Signs.
being pain is most commonly sharp, It Is after general evacuation in the first
place to be minded, yea, before, Cure.
bleeding is here required in the Arm first, after in the Foot; Cups are to be
applied to the sides and hips, Lenitives are here to be used; for stronger
exasperates the pain. To contemperate the acrimony of the humor, use Emulsion
of the four cold Seeds. Outwardly, to ease pain, ol. Buxi; or ol. Lini. s. ol.
Buxi, j. and apply with it oil of eggs stirred long in a leaden Mortar.
Unguent. populeon, vel vitel. ov. unius, conquassetur been in ol. ros. vel
Amygd. add. Croci, j. and anoint the place with it; vel cum herb. Linaria cum
floribus coct. cum adipe porcin. cui express. and parumper refrigerato vitel.
ovi permisce. Apply this with either common or Cotton wool. For discussing of
the Tumefaction, and ease pain, use the roots of Leeks having been roasted under
the Embers, and mixed with butter. Balsam. sulphur. made of flower of
brimstone, and Spirit of Terebinthine is excellent to ease pain; discuss the
Tumor, and cleanse the Ulcers of those parts. A common Catapl. made of milk,
white bread, oil of roses, yolks of eggs and saffron is good. To waste and dry
them up, use a fume of brimstone. The Leeches applied to the internal
Hemorhods is good: A half bathe of warm milk, whereto is added oil of Poppies
lb j. oil of Violets lb s. is excellent; when these prevail not, make an issue
in the thigh.

CHAP. XXVI. Scabs and Itch.
THE latter is frequently the Praeludium to the former, Scabs and Itch.
though the first is the greater affect, and so requires precedence in handling.

It Is a Tumor with the distemper and exulceration of the skin: Sometimes it is
Symptomaticall, otherwhile Critical. It Is caused from corrupt blood, mixed
with burnt choler and salt phlegm produced by diet occasioning the same;
especially if it happen the Liver to be very hot, or contagion.

In generals; First, Cure.
the diet must be amended. Secondly, the humor contemperated and evacuated, and
the liver reduced into it is former condition, by the frequent use of Sir.
Coral. vel potius tiuctura ejusdem, and Conser. Cynorrhod.

It Is sometimes humid, and is from salt phlegm, this is more easily cured then
the dry, therefore first give a Lenitive bole; as, Catholic. s. pull. Sen. s.
Misce: Then if the humor be hot, and blood be plentiful open a vein; after
purge with this, which I have known effectual. Take Seny an ounce and half,
the seeds of Aniss, Fenel, of each two drachmes, Agrimony, Violet leaves,
Fumitory, Scabious, Strawberry leaves, Mallow flowers, Borage, Buglos, of each
a handful, Cream of Tartar, half an ounce, Rosemary half a handful,
Clarified whey 3 quarts, boil them till a quart be wasted, then strain it,
and put to it whites of eggs, and then after 2, or 3 walmes, let it run through
a Cotton bagg of it self. Dos. half a pint in the morning, and so much at 4 a
clock afternoon. You may increase the quantity, or decrease, as you see it
work, that you may have 3 or 4 stools aday, taking heed of cold; This is
excellent, not only in this but dry Scab and Itch. After the body is
snfficiently purged, provoke sweat cum Essentia auri, Spir. gnaiac. CC. usti.
pp. Antim. diaph. vel Spir. ebuli, s. aq. Fumariae, ijs. Misce exhib. For
Topicall; baths are good, Cortic. rad. frangul. rec. rad. Lapath. acuti

to the consumption of the humidity, after strain it strongly; add Styrac.
liquid. j. Misce, and reserve it for use: To iiij. of this, may be added Alum.
usti, Tartari, Sulphuris, an. ij. stir it long in a Mortar, and make an
Unguent more effectual; the former without addition is good for this dry Scab,
Itch, and Malum Mortuum.

For the Itch, after purging, bleeding, and sweating, you may use Unguent.
Enulat. compo. and anoint in the palms of the hands, wrists, arm pits, bought

CHAP. XXVII.
NOw because I have frequently made mention of Issues or Fontinels, Issues and
Fontinells.
I shall here briefly discover how they are made, and so put a cou^^^ to our
Appendix. We shall pass by the benefit which comes by them, which you may
gather scattered up and down the whole Book. For the places, they are used in
the head, neck, between the Scapulas, on either side the back bone, and these
are supposed by the ablest to be best for distillations or rheummatick Diseases
proceeding from the head, In the sides, for Empyema, Arms, thighs, legs, etc.
they are either made by Actual or potential Cauteries, or by incision, the
last being most in use. If you desire to do it with a Potentiall Cautery, take
Paraus velvit one, which apply thus; First apply a plaster to the place of
Diapalma, wherein a hole is made answerable to the bigness you desire to have
the Issue, (the place being before marked out with Ink) then put in the
Caustic, and upon it another Plaster, then a little boulster, and upon all
roll it with a fillet; I have known it work its Effect in half an hour
without pain; after scarifie the Eschar, and put in a Pease and a Plaster, and
so bind it up. If you would use an Actual Cautery, use those that are made in
Boxes. If by Incision, then having marked the place with Ink, take up the skin,
and another holding one side, make your incision with your Lancet; which being
done, put in a little ball made of thick dry Eldern pith, (or of Gentian root)
let it be pressed hard together, and put in, upon it apply an Ivy leaf, and
upon it a linen boulster, wherein let there be a shilling so bowed, that it
may being rolled upon, make the harder compression upon the place, so dress it
every 24 hours till it be formed, and then use Pease; Some use Artificial
Pease made of Empl. Melilot. Cautharid. Heleb. nigr. Agaric. Hermodact. Gentian
and Cerae. alb. In stead of an Ivy leaf, you may use Empl. Diapal. Some
advise with a straw to race off the Cuticula, and upon the place apply a Pepper
corn with a Compresse. For Setons, they are made with a needle for that
purpose, but I find few that are willing to have this used.

Thus having passed over (by Gods help) the Appendix; we shall discover some
Magistrall receipts under the name of an Addition, and so put (by Gods
assistance) a final conclusion to the whole.

ADDITION.
Balsame.
TAKE of the best high country White wine a pint, Balsame.
Oil olive the eldest 3 pints; put thereto of the leaves and flowers of
Valerian, Carduus benedict. St. John's wort, of each half a pound, Comfrey roots
cleansed a handful. Let them be bruised and infused for 24 hours, then boil
them in a pipkin till the wine be consumed, continually stirring of it, then
strain it, after adding Terpentine (washed in damask rose water till it be
white, and the water clean drained out) a pound, wax half a pound, shred. Boil
them at a gentle fire altogether a quarter of an hour, after take it from the
fire, and let it stand a night to cool, in the morning make holes to the
bottom, and power out the wine and water which may remain, then set it on the
fire again, and put to it black Balsame an ounce, Oliban. 4. and Myrrh 3
ounces, Dragons blood an ounce; let them boil till the Olibanum and Myrrh be
dissolved. After take it from the fire, and let it cool, putting it in a glass
close stopped, and set it in the Sun for 21 days; so keep it for use, it will
last 30 or 40 years, it is excellent in all wounds. If it be said, this is
before set down. I answer, this in something differs; and besides the young
Surgeon has hereby this benefit to see how they both are made.

Lucatella's Balsam^
TAke of Sallet oil 3 pound, Lucatella's Bal.
(some wash it in a basin with a quart of red Rose water, stirring it till it
be white) Venice Terpentine a pound, washed in a pint of Sack (some in a quart
of claret) till it be white, of Betony, Bays, Rosemary, Tutsan, of each a
small handful, let them be cut very small; let these infuse together for 24
hours, and then boil them, Sack and all, for a matter of three hours, then
strain them, and add of Bees wax half a pound, of oil of St. John's wort 3
ounces, oil of Nutmegs, of Cloves, natural Balsame, Storax, Spermaceti,
Myrrh, of each 2 ounces, oil of Mace, Mummi, Camphire, of each an ounce, Oris
roots, Alkenet, red Sanders, in powder of each an ounce and half, Sang.
draconis as much; boil them altogether again for a matter of 7 or 8 hours,
then strain it, and let it cool for a night. In the morning, making holes in
the balm, and so pouring forth the water, (which is almost as precious as the
balm) then set it on a gentle flre, and when its dissolved, add to it of
Pearl, Amber grise, and red Coral, of each a dram, of leaf gold a book,
stir them together till they be cold, and reserve it for use. Others make it
only of the like quantities as is set down of Oil, Terebinth, Sack, Wax, and
an ounce of red Saunders, thus compounding it. First dissolve the Wax upon a
gentle fire, then add the Terpentine, stirring them till it be dissolved, then
add the oil, and Sack, letting them boil a quarter of an hour; then standing
till morning, take out the water and dross, boil it again a quarter of an
hour, then put in the Sanders.

Virtues.
It Is excellent for all green wounds, staying the blood also, if applied cold,
and bound hard on: for burning and scalding anointing it with a feather, and
put fine Lawn upon it. It Is good for bruises, stitches, Sciatica: For the
Colic ij. given in white wine; as also for worms, being given every morning;
it cures the shrinking of the sinews, ripens all Apostumes, and heals them;
cures Cancers and Ulcers; also Aches, cold Tumors, Palsy, and Apoplexy, and
cold diseases of the brain. This the simple is said to do, then much more the
magistrall, being of Dr. Burge's framing: Every one may use which he lift, the
lesser I have used with good success in wounds, etc. Others say, it is good for
the headache, the Temples and nostrils being anointed; against poison and
surfets given in Sack; as also the Plague, Fistulaes, Small pox, Measlles;
draws forth broken bones, or any putrefaction, eases pain, and hinders
inflammation in wounds.

Balsame.
TAke of the red and ripe Seeds of Woodbind (especialy the wild, Balsame.
which are ripe in September) a Peck or more, and set them in horse dung close
for 8 days, in the body of a Still, after put on the head, and distill it in
Bal. pour on the water again, and set it again in the dung 24 hours; then
distill it in ashes, after separate the oil per Bal. whose force is admirable
in the cure of wounds, surpassing that of Egypt or India, says my Author.
