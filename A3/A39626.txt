Five Merry wives of Lambeth OR, The Carpenter Cornuted.
Five wanton wives at Lambeth lived I hear
Which loved good Wine, good Ale, and eke good cheer,
And something in a corner they would take
For which they went abroad to merry make
And what they did, if you will but draw near
The full conclusion you shall quickly hear.
Tune of, I am a Jovial Bachelor, etc.


COme Lambeth Wives and gossips all
here is for you good Ware,
This pretty jest did late befall
described to a hair;
The merry Wives of Windsor was
a jovial crew, and free,
But not to be compared to these
if you will credit me,
Five wanton wives at Lambeth lives
and they would merry be,
The Gardener touched the Carpenters wife
a little above the knee.
These merry Wives to Dullige Wells
their progress needs would take
And on they put their rostmeat cloathe
as fine as hands could make.
To say each had their private friend
I should not tell a lie,
Their gammerships for to attend
O lie good Women lie,
Five wanton, etc.
There christened names I understand
was Sarah, Sue, and Mary,
And Nan, and Nell can plainly tell
nothing to the contrary,
Perhaps you may not know them well
but its all one for that,
Where e're you meet them yan may git
a bit to serve your Cat,
Five wanton, etc.
^^e Dullige water did not please
their pallets worth two straws,
^^se it made them ill at ease
(...) rumbled in their maws:
It was not liquor for their turn
him thence they do remove,
(...)ere to laugh, and not to mourn
(...) drink a cup in love:
Five wanton wives at Lambeth lives
and they would merry be,
The Gardner caught the Carpenters wife
a little above the knee.
Into the bell at Camberwell
they came and called for Sack
Whereas one of them chanced to fall,
down flat upon her back
But yet such harmless falls as these:
will never break her bones
Because she fell so much at ease
and got no hurt by stones
Five wanton wives, etc.
A dinner strait provided was
which cost them just five pound,
Whilst every lusty lively lass
took of their glasses round:
It was not half so bad as lose
their coin at Cards and Dice
Yet such a shot I do suppose,
might well a served them twice.
Five wanton wives, etc.
Great store of dainties there they had
and diet rarely dressed,
With wine to make their heart full glad
and liquor of the best
They eat their meat and drank their Sack
and made no more ado
Such dinners Poets sometimes lack,
would I had been there too
Five wanton wives, etc.
But he that did this merry plot
unto their grief discover,
Did show himself more like a sot
then any faithful lover:
As you may understand the same
if that you mark me well,
Because you know it is a shame
to kiss, and after tell
Five wanton wives, etc.
One of them a Carpenters wife
her husband is a Quaker,
Which made her use a Gardener
sometimes as her partaker:
This Gardener took from her a Ring
I think the sot was blind,
He had better took the the other thing
and left the Ring behind
Five wanton wives, etc.
This Ring he gave unto his wife
who something did misdoubt,
She came unto the Carpenter
to sift the story out,
He had no sooner seen the Ring
his wife was wont to wear:
But was born mad, as any thing
his patience could not bear
Five wanton wives, etc.
With that the Gardiners wife cried out
if this your wives Ring be*
For certain I will slit her nose
since she has wronged me,
My husband has full twenty pound
upon her vainly spent:
With feasting of her whoreish chops
In mirth and merryment
Five wanton wives. etc.
And thus the business was disclosed
which caused the neighbors laughter
Great mirth there was it is supposed
at what did follow after,
But if you would informed be
what after did befall,
Ask greasy Joan the rumpwoman
and she will tell you all,
Five wanton wives at Lambeth lives
and they would merry be.
The Gardener caught the Carpenters Wife
a little above the knee.
