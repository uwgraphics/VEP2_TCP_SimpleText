Two Speeches spoken at Oxford by the Right Honorable Edward Earl of Dorset,
before His MAJESTY, and the Lords of His Privy-Councell.
My Lords,
I Am now by the death of the Earl of Manchester, through His Majesty's
special favor invested with the keeping of the Privy Seal, an Office of
which I have had long the reversion, and by the possession of it I am entitled
to one of the supremest places of judicature in the kingdom; made Judge, ex
officio, of the second Court of Conscience in England, namely, the Court of
Requests instituted by that Solomon of our Nation, Henry the seventh for the
ease and relief of the Subject, tired with the tedious process of suites in
Chancery: And surely, in the Earl of Manchesters time, the Court of Requests
had few less suites depending in it, through the industry and equity of the
man, then the Chancery it self. So perfectly was he skilled in all the
nicities of the Laws, having passed through all the signal offices of the
gown in this kingdom. And surely, my Lords, it will be a hard matter for me,
who am not so well versed in the Laws, to govern that Province so exactly as
my Predecessor; yet sure I shall make it the supreamest end of my endeavors,
to perform my charge, though not with so much Law as he did, yet with as much
conscience. Conscience, which as it is the fountain from which all good Laws
are derived, ought to be used in administration of those Laws; and that I
shall not fail in, but faithfully accomplish the trust imposed on me by His
sacred Majesty, and perform right to the Subject, according as right it self
shall direct me.

My Lords, I could never like the over-severity of those Judges, who by a
modest tyranny, authorized by custom, strive to lengthen their rule over
wretched men, by an infinite process of formal orders, detaining the Causes
of Clyents so long in their Courts, till that which should rectiifie and settle
the breaches and cavils in men's estates the Law it self, consumes them: Very
many persons of good ability beginning suites for slight matters, in the mere
Law costs expending the best part of their fortunes. And is it not a thing much
to be lamented, that the Law, which ought to be the repressor and composer of
injuries, should prove to the party injured a greater injury then the injury it
self? That the cure of a disease should carry in it a more lingering and fatal
malady then the disease it self? Surely Judges and too many such there are or
have been, forget that Goddess, under whose suffrage they should pronounce
sentence, I mean justice; when they suffer the poor Clyents to be so grated,
as it were to powder by the Lawyers. Themselves, though they dare not openly
prostitute fair justice, virgin whiteness, yet do they adulterate her purity
by proxy, having their Factors to vent that commodity, which indeed should not
be bought for silver or gold, Justice; but now, Quantum quisque sua nummorum
servat in arca,
Tantum habet and legis. --
no penny, no Paternoster; no Coin, no Law: A hard case when people must pay
for that which is their right, or else be oppressed with injury, so that that
Devil money, has usurped the seat and heavenly countenance of that Angel
Justice. The Egyptians in their Hieroglyphics deciphered justice under the
figure of an Elephant; the nature of that beast for his strength being aptest
to carry great burdens: intimating thereby, that on the back of justice all
the weight of the Commonwealth should be imposed, it being the only supporter
of its welfare. But weak must that pillar be which has so infirm a basis to
rely on, as is injustice, nor can there be a more eminent wrong to the Subject,
then to make poor men from the furthest parts of this kingdom, coming to
London about Law-businesse, wait there, or come up thither Term by Term for
diverse years; no, nor a greater detriment to their estates. I was once in
mind therefore (if it had pleased God, that we who are servants to his
Majesty, had continued at London) to have made it a motion to the High Court of
Parliament, for passing a definitive sentence with His Majesty's consent
against this tedious prorogation and delaying of suites; but the more are the
times to be lamented, that this, nor any Law else of consequence for the good
of the Subject can be enacted, by reason of these civil uncivil wars and
differences betwixt His sacred Majesty, and His High Court of Parliament. Were
those reconciled by a fair and happy unity, I should with much joy and
alacrity of spirit enter upon this honorable office, and manage it so, as I
should discharge a good conscience to God, the duty of a true subject to my
Prince, and the honesty and integrity of a Judge, to those who have Causes
depending before me. But I should seem too much my own Trumpet, did not your
selves, my Lords, in your candid dispositions believe what I have uttered;
which when it shall please God and His Majesty, that I have occasion, amply, as
my predecessor did, to execute my office, I shall by my actions give
warrantable proof to what I have now uttered.

Another SPEECH spoken by the said Earl to His MAJESTY when he was instituted
President of His Council.
THe favors your Majesty in your Royal bounty has so frequently conferred
upon me, so far transcend the meannesse of my desert, that certainly I begin to
accuse my modesty for accepting them, and should absolutely condemn it,
without allowing it the benefit of its Clergy, did not your Majesty's sacred
commands acquit it, which must needs prevail above all respects of my self
upon my obedience, and adapt my weakness and inabilities for my employments in
your Majesty's service, which has, and ever shall be, the only center of my
intentions: Your Royal goodness, like the Suns vertuall beams, actuating my
dull capacity for the discharging any place your gracious bounty shall cast
upon me. And though your Majesty might have found out other Noble men my Peers,
who would have complied this charge of President of your Majesty's Council
with more dexterity; yet I dare boldly promise for my self, that none amongst
them should have performed it with more care and fidelity. The Council of
Kings are in the hands of the Almighty; and those that are of their Councels,
ought to regulate their thoughts and actions so for the service of their
Masters, as they shall not be esteemed mere Politicians, working in the
gentleness and suavity of their natures for their own ends, but aiming
perpetually at the common good, which must needs conduce to the good of the
Sovereign. Councellers that err out of this path, are rather to be termed
seducers, and as such should be punished, being indeed mere Achitophels,
crafty and malicious. And I must needs here deplore the present condition of
your sacred Majesty (in my sorrow for your Royal disasters I express my
humble gratitude for your bounties;) your high Court of Parliament, from which
you are departed hither, being of a settled opinion, as appears by their
Declarations, that all the machine of evils, that like so many furies fly
through your Highness Dominons, have taken their original from the
persuasions of bad Counselors; if any such there be, or have been about your
sacred Majesty, I shall most humbly pray for their removal or conversion from
such sinister practices, and think my self (my integrity shall gain a
remission for my boldness) engaged in duty and conscience to inform your
sacred Majesty, that till such Counselors be removed from your gracious ears,
there will never be any hopes that the distractions of your Kingdoms can be
settled, the wounds of which it has so long bled be imbalmed, much less
perfectly cured: For how can your Parliament, the grand and supreme Council of
your Kingdom, comply with the desires of your Majesty, when they conjecture
whatever they shall desire of your Majesty for your peoples welfare shall be
thwarted and nullified by the intimations of some few private cabinet
Counselors, which was the reason I conjecture of their humble addresses to
your Grace for the settling the election of your Counselors in the power of
the Commonwealth, namely, in the trieniall Parliament. The Counselors to
Kings, if they should have the misfortune to prove ill ones, having the
Subjects safety at their mercy, by the Royal authority which is then most
splendent, when it is most concurrent with the peoples prosperities, and
employed for their defense, and patronage against the oppression of evil
Counselors; who by their subtle and malignant practices, do oft-times, as it
were, transform the hearts of their Sovereigns from their native and genuine
candor and sweetness; by that means rendering their rules odious to their
Subjects: Oderunt quia metuunt, they always detest what they are afeard of,
every man naturally hating that which they conceive will hurt them: but your
Majesty's own wisdom, and the excellent skill your Royal knowledge has in
discerning and defining dispositions, must of necessity secure your reign
(which heaven long continue over us) from the disease of such pernicious
Counselors; it being impossible that your gracious disposition (though it may
be deluded sub apparentia bo^^) with the Angel-like a pearance of these furies,
that it should again be deceived by their devices; so that if there have been
any such Counselors that have formerly incensed your Majesty against your
Parliament by mis-conceits and jealousies, I doubt not now their advices are of
no validi y in your gracious judgment; for mine own part, with the tender of
my life to your Majesty's service, I prostrate my self in all humility at your
Royal feet for your gracious favors toward me, and crave pardon for my
boldness, which I am confident, your Majesty will grant, knowing it merely,
to be progressive from my integrity and duty.

FINIS.
