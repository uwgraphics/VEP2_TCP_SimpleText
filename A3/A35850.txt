The Word of the Lord, To his beloved City New-Ierusalem, come from God,
clothed with the excellency of the Glory of his Love; and is the Bride the
Lambs Wife, with the Flowings of the tender compassionate bowels of the Lord
Jesus, to all the Mourners in Sion, and the afflicted desolate People, who
wait for his coming as for the Morning, and has not satisfaction in any
thing but in the enjoyment of his sweet and comfortable presence.
OH Jerusalem, thou beloved amongst the People, who art become the beautiful
Bride the Lambs Wife; Oh how did he seek thee in the day of thy Devorcement,
when thou wast weeping in the barren wilderness, as a desolate widow, who had
not any to comfort thee, when thy greatest mournings and breakings of heart
were thy greatest comfort? And the more thou drunk the tears that was shed for
the want of him, was thy greatest satisfaction: Oh the weary days thou had
upon the Earth, because thy languishing soul knew not where to meet with thy
beloved, neither did thou know how to walk in the steps of the Flock of thy
companions, who was comforted with his presence, whom thy soul wanted: Then was
he near unto thee (though thou knew it not) enlivening the desires that was
toward his Name. And in the acceptable day he sent forth whom he had ordained,
to declare unto thee the glory of his love, in the light of his own life, in
which he has covered thee this day as with a wedding garment, and in it thou
appears comely in his sight, and acceptable in his presence. And for thy sake,
O Jerusalem, thou City of the Living God, what has been endured? how many
innocent Lambs have suffered? it is hard to be expressed, to bring glad tidings
unto thee of him whom thy soul thirsts after? How have the striplings sent
out in Gods Authority, run too and fro in the earth, willing to spend, and be
spent, in all services of love, to persuade thee to forsake all that has
entangled thy mind, and hindered thee from the innocent life of thy beloved.
Thy mighty men, with many of the Sons and Daughters of glory, has sealed their
living testimony with their blood, in the patience and sufferings of, the L^mb
of God, that thou may be affected with the excellency of the glory of him
whom thy soul desires.

And now the Lord God requires of every particular Son and Daughter of Sion,
To Watch and Pray, that not any enter into temptation; and all that have any
stain upon their garment, come to the Fountain which is opened for Judah and
Jerusalem to wash in, which is the heart breaking love of God manifest in the
light of the Covenant, and sealed up to the soul in the blood of Jesus.

Oh come away, come away, out of all your thoughts, desires, doubts, and
unbel^ife, which would turn you aside from the enjoyment of the dear love of
God in Christ Jesus: Let not any stand afar off, because of your littleness,
lameness, blindness, weakness, and infirmities, who cannot live at peace,
until you be healed with the blood of the Lamb.

Arise, arise, you necessitated people, in the light of the Lord, give up to
the drawing spirit of Life in the light of Jesus Christ, he will carry thee
(that cannot go) in the Arms of his Compassions; he will cause the Lame to
walk, and thou that art sensible of thy blindness, to recover thy sight; yea,
he will heal thee of all thy infirmities, who in the Light waits as a little
Child to be ordered and guided in the washing and sanctifying Spirit of the
Lord Jesus, who is become a Husband to the desolate Widow, and a repairer of
the breaches, and a restorer of the desolate places, in whom the fatherless
has found mercy this day, for his names sake.

Oh! what shall I say of the unspeakable love of God in Christ Jesus the
Husband of the Bride, the Lambs Wife? Oh ye Sons of the glorious day, read,
and feel in the deep tastes of the unsearchable love. And you Handmaids of
Glory, drink of the inexpressable Ocean, which flows in the Light over all
opposition. This is the Son of the Fathers love, who has been a man of
sorrows, and acquainted with griefs, He was wounded for our transgressions, and
by his stripes are we healed, and this is the work of the Lord: Let all Crowns
be thrown down before him, for he alone shall have all the glory, besides him
there is no other. Therefore in the measure of him, let every Son, Daughter,
and servant of God watch, and diligently hearken to his Council, and what ever
the natural man most inclines to, when the temptation besets you, judge your
selves, look up to the Lord, and resist the Devil with boldness in the first
assault, and the Lord God will give you Dominion over him, and the bond of
iniquity shall not have power over you, and in his holy authority, every one
stand in Dominion upon the head of the first man, with all his excellency and
glory, that in perfect freedom every particular Reign, in the measure of the
Light, over every thought and desire that is contrary to the will of God, that
in his eternal will, you Sons and Daughters of the most high, you all dwell in
the holy faith, which will evidence to you beyond your sight, and will arm you
against all the fiery darts of the Devil: And you shall tread down Satan under
your feet, and in the triumphing Dominion, through the blood of the Lamb, and
word of your testimony, you shall overcome, and continually drink of the Rivers
of pleasures which is the presence of the Lord Jesus, our Light Life, and
righteousness for ever; for he is become our Husband, and we are as the wife
of his bosom, in the delight of his glorious love; Let the Mourners in Sion
rejoice, and the afflicted among the people be glad, and fear the Lord. And
let not any say, The Lord regards me not, who desires salvation in uprightness
of heart; for what ever thou hungers and thirsts for in his life, thou art the
Heir of it, and the Lord will satisfy thy hunger with his refreshings for his
names sake: And this is the portion, of them that are least in their own Eyes
amongst the people, The Lord has spoken it.

And all you Inhabitants of the City of the great God, whom the Lord has
prospered in your living testimony, in what he has called unto, blessed be the
Lord God for you who retains the sencibility of your nothingness in self, and
so becoms poor with the poorest, and weak with the weakest, and truly makes
self of no reputation, but humbles it to the Cross, and does not serve self,
but the Lord and his people, with all his gifts and ornaments, with which he
has adorned you, because of the savor of this Ointment which you have in
Christ, causes the souls of all the upright in heart to praise the Lord for
you; Oh your steadfast valiant unwearied travells, labor and sufferings for the
Lord, causes the hearts of his people to be enlarged with Hallelujahs, and high
praises in the holy assembles of his Saints, you know your reward is with you;
and woe to them that devise mischief against you whom the Lord has blessed.

Oh Sion^ Children, from the least to the greatest, love the Lord Jesus Christ,
and let not a thought of the heart have any power that would draw from the
Light, Life, and Love of the Lord Jesus; Let the day of the Resurrection arise
upon you, which will set your souls in perfect love, above all unbelief and
infidelity. Oh drink, drink, drink, to the full satisfaction of your souls of
the cup of his salvation, for it is freely handed to all that love him, and
thirsts for his mercies, and trample and tread down the self working spirit,
that all be bound down in silence, and kept in the death that would move in any
exercise to utter words rashly before the Lord; but in the resurrection, light,
power, life, and innocent birth enter the Kingdom, and Reign in the Dominion
thereof. Oh, here my dear friends, let us comfort and consolate our souls
together, for this is our beloved, and we have waited for him, and now is he
come with power, and great glory, to deliver his Captives, and establish them
in his glorious freedom, where the evil one shall not prevail against them,
and to marry the soul unto himself, who has waited for him as for the
Morning; And all in the Marriage union feel his power abounding to lead in the
daily Cross, to stand over all that would draw from the sweet union, that is in
the footsteps of the flock of his Companions, who walks in the Light; and stir
up the gift of God in you, in all faithful obedience, to meet together in true
watchfulness to wait in the Light: And as your hearts are filled with the
heavenly power of the Lord, and broken in the sense of the over commings of his
life, and moved in the forceable strength thereof, in any exercise, in your
Families, or in the Assemblies of his people; quench not the Spirit, of the
Lord, but be obedient, and keep within the bounds of a broken heart and a
contrite Spirit, which is a Sacrifice acceptable in his presence: And all feel
the love of God enlarging your hearts one to another, that the strong may bear
the burden of the weak, and in the pure life of love, you may grow fruitful
Plants in the Vineyard which Gods right hand has Planted, etc.

And as for our little Sister, (which is scattered amongst the people in the
Nations) that has no breast of Consolation, her broken Cisternes has failed
her: What shall we do, in this day she shall be spoken for, which is come upon
us, though at present she cannot draw near, but mourns at a distance, and cries
in secret for want of the enjoyment of the God of our salvation? Oh let your
Bowels open to her, and let your hearts breathe unto the Lord, that he may
seal his Counsel unto her, and cause her to walk in the Light of the Lord
with us, whom he has raised to be the first fruits amongst many brethren, to
bear his glorious testimony over and above the heads of all the wrath of the
Children of men, that withstands the Appearance of God, who will cause them to
bow before his Glory; in the day he will clear the innocence of his beloved
people; which shall smite the hearts of them that know him not, neither by
Sword, nor Spear, nor strength of the Arm of Flesh, but with the breath of his
mouth, and the brightness of his coming, which shall spread his fame over the
Nations, to gather our Brethren from far, and Sisters from the ends of the
Earth; yea, the mighty shall bow to his Scepter, and the Nations that are saved
shall walk in his Light, with us, whom he has made as dear unto himself as the
Apple of his Eye; and though a woman may forget her sucking Child, yet the Lord
will not forget any that fear him; but he will lead through all tribulations
with joy in his heavenly power, until we have finished our course with
gladness, to the glory of the name of the Lord for ever. And this is the
Portion, and the Lot of thy Inheritance, thou beautiful Bride, the Lambs Wife,
against whom, every tongue that is lifted up shall fall into judgment, and the
weapons formed against thee, shall not prosper; for the Lord has made thee a
burdensome Stone to the Nations, and the praise of the whole Earth; and the
desires of the people shall be to the name of the most high God, who dwells in
the midst of thee, and has displayed his Banner of Love over thee, and has
turned his fury away from thee, and never any more shall thou want the fresh
springs of Life who loves the Light, and bathes thy soul in the Ocean of his
inexpressable mercies: The Lord will keep thee in the safety of his power, and
the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against any of the Sons and Daughters who
walk in the Light of thy City, O Jerusalem, in whom there is no more curse, but
the Throne of God, and of the Lamb is in thee, and his servants does serve
him, and they do see his Face, and his Name is written in their Foreheads, and
there is no Night there, neither need of Candle, nor light of the Sun, for
the Lord God gives them Light, and they do Reign for ever, as the Lord has
spoken.

Given forth in York Castle, the 19. of the first Month, 1663. Through your
Brother and Companion in the tribulation and Kingdom of patience in the Lord
Jesus, W. D.
Let this be sent abroad to be read, in the fear of the Lord, in the holy
