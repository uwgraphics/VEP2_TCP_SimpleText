THE CASE OF THE Rope-makers of London, And other Ports in the Kingdom of
England.
FOREIGN Cordage and Yarn Imported, pays a Duty of 5 s. and 8 d. per Cent. But
upon Exportation draws back 5 s. and 4 d.

For carrying on the late War, the Duty on Hemp Imported was advanced from 8 d.
per Cent. to 2 s. per Cent.

All Cordage made in England pays (upon Exportation) 6 d. per Cent.

So that the Duty upon Hemp Included, English Cordage (upon Exportation) pays 2
s. and 2 d. per Cent. more than Foreign Cordage. By Reason whereof, New
England, and other of his Majesty's Plantations, are supplied with Foreign
Cordage, so much Cheaper than that made in England can be afforded.

Again, During the late War, abundance of Journey-men and Apprentices being
Impressed into His Majesty's Service, Masters (to supply their places) were
forced to let many Young Men into their Trade.

By Reason whereof, and Masters not being now able to find Vent for their
Cordage, are forced to turn off their Journeymen; who, for want of Work, are
reduced to extreme Poverty; and many of their Wives and Children forced to tak^
Alms of the Parish.

Wherefore the Ropemakers Petition, That the Draw-back may be taken off upon
all Foreign Yarn and Cordage.
