CHARLES R.

WHereas it appears by an Inquisition lately taken before one of His Majesty's
Coroners of His County of Middlesex, upon view of the Body of Sir Edmund-Bury
Godfrey Knight, one of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the same County,
That the said Sir Edmund-Bury Godfrey was in a Barbarous and Inhumane manner
lately Murdered, by persons whose names were to the Jury unknown; The Kings
most Excellent Majesty out of His Royal Inclination to Justice, and to the
intent that so Horrid and Detestable a Murder may be with utmost Severity
punished, whereby all others may be deterred from Committing or Attempting such
Bloody and Wicked Crimes, does, by this His Royal Proclamation, Strictly Charge
and Command, all His Judges, Justices of the Peace, and other Magistrates, and
all His Officers, and other His loving Subjects, That they do use their utmost
diligence in their several Places and Capacities, to Find out and Discover the
Murderers of the said Sir Edmund-Bury Godfrey; and if they make any
considerable Discovery by whom the said Murder was Committed, to give speedy
Information thereof to one of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State; and
likewise to use their utmost Endeavor to Apprehend the Murderers: And as a
Reward to such as shall make a Discovery of the Murderers, His Majesty is
graciously pleased hereby to Promise, to any Person or Persons, who shall make
such a Discovery, whereby the said Murderers, or any of them shall be
Apprehended, the Sum of Five hundred Pounds, which shall be immediately paid
down, upon sufficient Testimony, that such Persons or Person Apprehended, are,
or is Guilty of the said Murder: And if any one of the Murderers shall
Discover the rest, whereby they, or any one of them shall be Apprehended, such
Discoverer shall not only be Pardoned his Offense, but shall in like manner
receive the said Reward of Five hundred Pounds.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Twentieth day of October1678. in the
Thirtieth year of Our Reign.
