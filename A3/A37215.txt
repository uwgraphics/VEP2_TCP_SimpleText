The Nature of the drink Kauhi, OR Coffe, and the Berry of which it is made,
Described by an Arabian Physician.

OXFORD, Printed by Henry Hall, in the year of our Lord, 1659.

BUN is a plant in Yaman, which is planted in Adar, and grows up and is
gathered in Ab. It is about a cubit high, on a stalk about the thickness of
ones thumb. It flowers white, leaving a berry like a small nut, but that
sometimes it is broad like a bean; and when it is peeled, parts in two. The
best of it is that which is weighty and yellow; the worst, that which is black.
It is hot in the first degree, dry in the second: it is usually reported to be
cold and dry, but it is not so; for it is bitter, and whatsoever is bitter is
hot. It may be that the scorce is hot, and the Bun it self either of equal
temperature, or cold in the first degree. That which makes for its coldnsse is
its stipticknesse. In sum it is by experience found to conduce to the drying
of rheumes, and phlegmatic coughes and distillations, and the opening of
obstructions, and the provocation of urin. It is now known by the name of
Kohwah. When it is dried and thoroughly boiled, it allayes the ebullition of the
blood, is good against the small pox and measles, and bloody pimples; yet
causes vertiginous headheach, and makes lean much, occasioneth waking, and
the Emrods, and asswageth lust, and sometimes breeds melancholy. He that would
drink it for liveliness sake, and to discuss slothfulness, and the other
properties that we have mentioned, let him use much sweet meats with it, and
oil of pistaccioes, and butter. Some drink it with milk, but it is an error,
and such as may bring in danger of the leprosy.
