THE Dissenter's Description OF TRUE LOYALTY.
True Loyalty it does not stand
In things that many take in hand,
To Swagger, Curse, to Damn and Roar,
And Drink a Thousand Healths and more;
Nor to devise Confounding Oaths,
Which God, and King, and Subjects Loathes;
Nor Drinking till they Reel and Stagger,
Then Wound or Stab with Sword or Dagger.
Though such cry out Huzza, the King,
They Are easily brought to another thing;
Their Brains unstable, their Hearts are hollow,
And that that is ^ppermost they will follow;
Believe them no, they have no Faith,
Believing not what Scripture says:
For such Men will turn with the Wind,
They Will leave the^r God and King behind,
To serve their Lusts and Pleasures dear,
Being sometimes there, and sometimes here,
Always Swimming with the Tide,
Playing Jack on every side;
Such Roaring, Huffing, Bouncing Boys,
They Bluster much, and make a Noise
As if the only Men they were,
That for the King took special care;
But in the end it will be known
Such hurt his Int^rest, and their own:
But Loyal Men do truly Love
The King, and Him that is above,
They keep themselves from every thing
That does offend their God and King,
And always have a careful Eye,
Not to offend the Majesty
Of him who Rules on Earth below,
Or him that does our Secrets know;
For they that truly fear their God,
Do know the King has Sword and Rod
To punish them that evil do,
And are content it should be so;
They also know God gives him Power,
To which they are subject every hour;
Not from the fear to fell his Wrath,
But from Allegiance and true Faith.
When good he does to them impart,
Love is returned from very Heart;
His Declaration shows them well
No Prince in Wisdom does excel,
In Valor and true Piety,
A happy Nation made thereby;
For Liberty to this Land he brings,
And fames his Name above most Kings.
They Are nothing like those sordid Sots,
Who run from Discontents to Plots,
Nor like such Fools, who run such strains,
To rule all with their addled Brains,
Who over a mess of Coffee prate,
Do sit and judge the things of State;
But in what is right he takes Contentment,
And what is amiss prays for amendment;
In mean while knows his Duty sure,
That what is amiss he must endure;
Such Subjects always Live at rest,
They hear, and see, and say the best;
Whose Tongues are bridled with a Bit,
They may not run beyond their Wit;
Such Subjects sure the King will please,
Who keep him, and themselves at ease;
Such Subjects are to him a Crown,
The more of such, the more Renown;
Such Loyalty has substance in it,
'Twill never hurt the Government;
God send such Loyalty in Streams,
As Blessings great upon King JAMES.
That he may nourish them, and they
May for his VVelfare ever Pray,
Vive Le 'Roy.
