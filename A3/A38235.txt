EIGHT RESOLUTIONS TO EIGHT QUERIES LATELY Proposed to seduce all true lovers
of their Country and Parliaments, and conscientious Soldiers in the ARMY.
Resolved upon the first question.
THat it is very unlikely, that a whole well-minded and well-meaning Army
should after so long experience, be so far deluded as to carry on the
ambitious or pernicious designs of any. That it is arrogance or weakness to
suspect the Soldiers of so much ignorance: and hardly honest or charitable to
suspect any of their Commanders either of ambitious or pernicious designs, of
whose piety and public virtue, the whole Land has so eminent testimony: That
all who have religious and specious pretenses in their mouths, have not the
like real intentions in their hearts, is manifest in the Querist, who vents
his own gall against the Army, by comparing them with Hazael, and the
Anabaptists of Germany, though his own conscience and their Letters,
Declarations, and Actions, cannot but acquit them of any evil intentions: but
that all appearance of Religion is to be suspected of Hypocrisy: shows little
conscience or integrity in the suspector: and if there be any reality, actions
doubtless are the best demonstrations: stopping the mouths of all gainsayers,
except such Rabshekahs, whose corrupt interests binds them to rail against
Innocence it self.

Resolved upon the second Question.
That when an Army, dutiful and meritorious (above example) which the envious
Querist omitted) find themselves (after all their faithful services)
extremely neglected in sundry respects, frequently slighted and reproached:
upbraided of baseness, and cowardice in open Parliament; after that, censured,
and publicly declared Enemies to the State: when they had seen diverse of the
Army adjudged to death, for things done as Soldiers in service of the
Parliament: And in this evil conjunction and malevolent influence of all
Authority, both Parliamentary and elsewhere, against them, being Voted to
disband. it behoved them to renumerate for what end they had taken up Arms; to
consider whether the people enjoyed their Liberties, or that themselves should
be in safety when disbanded; it behoved them to consider, whether those Voted
them down, that Voted them up; and into whose hands they were required to
deliver their Sword? Whether they were likely to preserve them or destroy them
with it, and finding their danger eminent, and the people yet in bondage; they
had dealt like mad men, to have given the Sword into those mad men's hands, who
before they had it, abused both Army and people in a most violent and desperate
manner; and the case being plainly and manifestly thus: The Soldiers are to be
justified in overruling their own General, and Officers, in seazing the King,
the Commissioners attending him, and removing them, as seemed best to their
honest purposes, though without the Parliaments privity.

As for those high affronts of their privileges and power, endeavors to
overawe; ^f not to force the Parliament (with the like fawning aggravations of
the Querist) following in this question: Believe it, Parliaments, and all other
Authorities in the world must be taught new Lessons, they must not pr^sume as
they have seemed to do, that they are chosen into Authority as into an
inheritance of their own, wherein they may play the spend thrif^s, and abuse
their Families without control: but they must know Authority is a trust, for
the good of those that trust, nor must they think to blind men's eyes with old
Knaves tales and traditions; That the people cannot, nor ought to judge of
their own safety or freedom; all forsooth is referred to them, and the people
must be content with their carving, with their interpretation, if the people
cry out for bread, for freedom, and they give them a stone, and Vote that
stone to be bread, why the people must not say it is a stone: if the people cry
out for fish, for redress of the most gross and palpable grievances: and they
give them a Scorpion, and Vote that that Scorpion is a Fish, if any be so bold
as to say it is a Scorpion; then to the Fleet, to Bridewell, to Newgate,
New-prison, or Tower with such factious, seditious persons, away with all such
out of all Offices, and employments: its not fit such fellows should live, that
dare presume to reply upon Parliaments: these were the mischiefs we were
fallen into, and thus the Court Doctrines are turned Parliamentary, and
defended by this most reverend Father of delusion, this Querist: but he and his
Patrons will in short time see that honesty is the best policy, and that all
this twisting together of corrupt policy, is indeed but spinning of Hemp for
the use of the owners thereof.

Resolved upon the third question.
That although Jack Cade, nor Jermine, Piercie, Goring, or the King (Sir you will
remember with whom you rank his Majesty one day) or any other might not at any
time, offer any enforcement upon Parliaments in things that were manifestly
unjust, as the Querist takes for granted: it will not follow, but that as
Parliaments may turn tyrants, even so as tyrants they may lawfully be
proceeded against, as lawfully as Parliaments may prosecute tyranny in
whomsoever: And whatever this learned Querist would have the world believe,
Tyranny is not so difficult a thing to be judged of, but that it is more
visible to be seen, than his Foxes ear through his sheeps skin, and that
you will say is visible enough, Sir their unjust actings no more condemn the just
proceedings of the Army, then their just actings justify the unjust
proceedings of those ye mention.

Resolved upon the fourth question.
That the Querist mistakes the Army to be sick of his disease, and so proposes
the disbanding of the Army for their cure.

Indeed its very like it would be an absolute cure unto him, and to many more
that are heart-sick of his disease; but all Doctors are not agreed, some being
of an opinion they must undergo another kind of cure; as for the Army, God
has hitherto been their true and great Physician, and doubtless they are
better stablished then to leave his saving Counsels, for such Machivilian
Mountebanks; All your care for Ireland, or to prevent broils at home, or
speeding the just demands of the Army, and all the affrights you invent for
London, all your censurings of disobedience, with the rest done to your
Commination of damnation, is in effect no more but this: Disband, or we and
our accomplices are in a desperate condition: Is not that the meaning? though
it be Sir, yet be not so desperate, do not wound your conscience more and
more; do not persist to provoke your strong opposers; all your hopes are built
upon your deluding the Citizens, by these Queries, truly it will not do; they
are generally too wise to be wrought upon, by such simple Sophistry, into a
desperate engagement against so faithful, so just an Army, that under God has
preserved them, their wives, children and families, from utter destruction: Be
better advized Sir, and trust yet in God, with him there is mercy, and this his
Army are not cruel: Cease to do farther evil, learn to do well; Retract
your Queries, and make amends for this your ill spent time, by doing some real
and eminent good for the Commonwealth, bring forth fruits worthy of
Repentance, and you will yet find comfort in the day of your Visitation.

Resolved upon the fifth Question.
That it is not as the Querist supposes, that because the Army have their
swords in their hands, therefore they are unjust and not to be trusted; Some
persons in all states must have the sword, and it is happy when wise and good
men get it, admit the Major vote of Parliament now had it, were it safe for the
People except they had another Armed force to balance them? truly it may be
so, and may be happy for the People they have it not; this is certain, those
members of Parliament that first raised this Army are really of that opinion,
and rejoice that the Army refuse to disband, as seeing themselves, the Army,
and all the well affected in the land utterly inslaved or destroyed, if it were
otherwise: have patience for a little while, and you shall see the Army will
willingly disband, they have but a little work to do, and they have don, and
all your wire-drawne suggestions will come to nothing, your jealousies will
vanish, in the mean time you might do well to give the Army a visit, believe
it, the air of it might do you abundance of good, Nay its a converting Army,
those chaplin Officers and Soldiers, though they have not so complete
Antimagisteriall principles as your self and others of your tribe, yet they
have others that are far better, and of which you have a great deal more need
of: Why they have converted whole Countries, no place where they come but
rejoice in their society, they are so full of God, and so full of all kind of
goodness, those only are jealous of them that have not known their conversation,
certainly were you amongst them, these old wormeaten threedbare aspersions of
German Anabaptists, which the Romanists twit the Common Protestant withal, and
they the Puritan, or Presbyter, and the Presbyter the Sectaries, all these
toys would soon be purged out of you, and you would become wholly new inside
and outside, you would admire the true Christian love and unity that is amongst
them, impossible to be disunited: What Is now your grief, through the
indisposition of your mind, would then be your rejoicing, therefore cease this
Juggling, and amongst them quickly, and all old scores will soon be forgotten.

Resolved upon the sixth Question.
That the Querist persists either to trouble his head with false fantastic
fears which transport his understanding, or else he wilfully supposes in
this Querie (to deceive the Reader) what the Army are not troubled at, for
admit any of their friends in the House have been unduly elected, have they
said they have not, or have they don any thing to continue them there? no, and
it were time enough for an honest man to tell them and the world of it when he
sees it: for by this vile liberty of supposition, a cunning Sophister has too
great an advantage to abuse the most guiltless people in the world, If they
have don such things (as he conclusively queries to their extreme
discouragement) why does he not put them into away of accusation and trial,
and so do the public some honest service: for this is most unworthy, and
savours more then of common malice.

Your supposition also concerning Mr. Peter's shows, you hunt all corners for
matter to please and humor a seduced party, pray Sir does not every man's
understanding give him, That Cornwall and Wales are as likely, or more likely
to make undue elections then any other parts of this Nation; you might very
well have spared Master Peter's name in this as in your other conceit, of his
getting more by the Wars then any two Presbyterian Ministers, you mean
happily, more trouble, pains and sickness, and therein you are right, but if
you mean wealth, sure you will not say he has gotten more than two such as
Doctor Burges: and yet in the fit you were in when you indicted these Queries,
you might be pardoned for saying any thing, being in the heat of blood, you
shall have your book for this, but beware the next offense may cost you dear:
you do ill service to your friends in touching upon this string, it makes men
to seriously cast their eyes upon the Assembly of Divines, of whom, strange
things are daily told at the Committee, for the dispose of Benefices (commonly
called the Committee for plundered Ministers) you say you hear of no complaint
or Petitions against the unjustnesse of elections in Cornwall or Wales* and
now ag^i^e you wrong your party, thus to occasion the people to look back upon
their dealing in the House with Petitioners, and Petitions, to say no mo^e:
there has been sad work about Petitions, such as England nor any other Nation
never heard of, which shows the tyran^y of Parliaments to be the worst of any:
and yet you seem to be gr^^ved that there are any in the House, or out of the
House, that do oppose them, doubtless you have a share amongst them, and it
were pity but you should still share, and speed as they do that are so well
pleased with their doings.

Resolved upon the seventh Question.
That if the Independent party or any of them are guilty of those evils (by
the querist hear again suggested) neither the Army nor any others, do desire
they should be acquitted, but that they should suffer according to their
demerit, nor do the Writings, or Declarations of the Army, in the least
pretend, to protect them or any in their evil doings: but still this way of
quaere or supposition, is a most ungodly way of aspersion reflecting upon all,
when happily few or none are guilty.

As for the Armies listing and recruite, therein they have don nothing but what
was lawful for them to do, and suitable to the work they intend, which is to
defend themselves, and those they have hither to preserved, from the violent
oppression of evil and wicked men: and not as you suppose to carry on some
desperate and destructive designs in England: No Sir, the most desperate and
destructive design in England is to bring in the Scots and foraigne forces,
wherein you and yours are the designers, and not the Army. And you that in this
Q^ere are so provident in saving of charges, did not when time was, show your
selves so thrifty toward your dear brethren; to them you were liberal
enough and could be content to afford them much more, might you have had your
wills, when as this Army in your esteem is scarce worthy of Bread: all things
grow dear forsooth if they come near you, and the poor fail not to be put
in mind of it by your impious dissembling care: When at other times they must
hang or starve whilst you ruffle and flourish up and down in your bravery, and
fare delitiously every day; for shame leave this gross partiality and
dissimulation, or you will mar your credit and spoil your trade, you will not be
able at this rate to deceive once a week: this overdoing will make every man
beware of you, you will ere long be enforced, though much against your nature,
to live by honest courses.

Resolved upon the eight Question.
That if the Armies late proceedings had been qualified with their disbanding
it had gone ill with all the honest well-affected party in the Kingdom: their
obedience to so destructive commands, had been a sin equal to self
destroying, no doubt they might as well destroy all the honest party in
Parliament, City, and Kingdom, as to give up their sword to those they
evidently saw would destroy them: and if they had done it, they had then indeed
with a bleeding witness, eclipsed and nullified all their former merits, glory,
and esteem in the eyes of all the world, and drawn perpetual scandal upon
the profession of Religion, as if Religion were a besotting of mankind to a
subjection unto Tyrany and opression, if cloaked with the name of Authority,
when as the voice of true Religion declares after this manner if thou do well
fear not, if thou do evil then fear, strongly implying, that all authority
that is just is for the punishment of evil doers, such as really hurt their
neighbors, and for the praise of those that do well: otherwise the Magistrate
bears the sword not only in vain but to evil purpose, the authority that is
of God must be evidently se^n by its goodness, that which is of the Devil by
its badnesse, cruelty, and injustice, now indeed there are a sort of men that
when they get Authority into their hands call evil good, and good evil, and
accordingly exercise the same, for the suppression of those that do honestly,
and live quietly, and to the praise and encouragement of a sort of base
informers, that vex and molest their neighbors without any just cause, that
countenance all kind of injustice, cruelty, and oppression: That betray their
trust, violate the liberties of the people and pervert the ends even of
Parliaments themselves, but let them remember, he that sits in heaven, laughs
them to scorn, and that for all these things they must come to Judgment, and
then vain will be the help of man, all the art and sophistry in the world will
be then to little purpose, and then what would they, (such sicophants as you
are) give for a good conscience, that might undauntedly appear before the
righteous, Judge of all the earth, believe it Sir, you are exceedingly
transported with an evil understanding, or an evil Conscience, and you had
need consider things more seriously then you have done, assure your self God
expects another account of those parts and abilities of yours: the expense of
them thus, is not to his glory, nor his peoples good, therefore look to it in
time, and spend the remainder of your hours to better purpose: you see all
your labor bestowed in your queries are to your own and your parties
prejudice, ministering occasion to a more clear openning of your delusion,
whereby the people you would deceive, become more strongly armed against your
deceit, and when you think you have them, they are either not for you or
against you, believe it, it is a very tedious thing to maintain Injustice, to
propose to live by a corrupt profession, a man were better never be borne, or
beg his bread; it is impossible you can have any comfort in it, waking you have
nothing but fear, sleeping you have no rest, and in death you will find
nothing but horror: make you therefore the ninth Resolution: and be resolved to
turn unto the Lord with all your heart, and to forsake the ways of malicious
and froward men.

FINIS.
