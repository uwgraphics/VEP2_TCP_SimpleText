ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL. A POEM.

-- Si Propius stes
Te Capiet Magis --
The Second Editon; Augmented and Revised.

TO THE READER.
It Is not my intention to make an apology for my Poem: Some will think it needs
no excuse: and others will receive none. The design, I am sure, is honest: but
he who draws his Pen for one party, must expect to make enemies of the other.
(...) Wit and Fool are consequents of Whig and Tory; and every man is a Knave
or an Ass to the contrary side. There Is a treasury of Merits in the ^hanatick
Church, as well as in the Papist; and a Pennyworth to be had of Saintship,
Honesty, and Poetry, for the Loud, the Factious, and the Blockheads: But the
longest Chapter in Deuteronomy has (...) Curses enough for an Anti- Bromingham.
My comfort is, their manifest prejudice to my Cause, will render their
judgment of less Authority against me. Yet if a Poem have a Genius, it will
force its own reception in the World. For there is a sweetness in good Verse,
which tickles even while it hurts: And, no man can be heartily angry with him,
who pleases him against his will. The commendation of Adverversaries, is the
greatest triumph of a Writer; because it never comes unless extorted. But I can
be satisfied on more easy terms: If I happen to please the more moderate sort,
I shall be sure of an honest party; and, in all probability, of the best
Judges; for, the least concerned, are commonly the least corrupt: And I confess
I have laid in for those, by rebating the Satyr, (where Justice would allow
it) from carrying too sharp an edge. They who can criticize so weakly, as to
imagine I have done my worst, may be convinced at their own cost, that I can
write severely, with more ease than I can gently. I have but (...) at (...)
men's Follies, when I coud have declaimed against their (...); and other men's
Virtues I have commended, as freely as I have (...) their (...). And now, if
you are a malicious Reader, I expect (...) (...) return upon me, that I affect
to be thought more impartial than I am. But if men are not to be judged by
their Professions, God (...) (...) Common-wealths-men, for professing so
plausibly for the Government. (...) cannot be so unconscionable, as to charge
me for not (...) of my name; for that would reflect too grossly upon your own
party, who never dare, though they have the advantage of a Jury to secure them

If you like not my Poem, the fault may possibly be in my writing (though it is
hard for an Author to judge against himself;) But, more probably, it is in your
Morals, which cannot bear the truth of it. The violent, on both sides, will
condemn the character of Absalom, as either too favorably, or too hardly
drawn. But they are not the violent whom I desire to please; The fault, on the
right hand, is to Extenuate, Palliate and Indulge; and, to confess freely, I
have endeavored to commit it. Besides the respect which I owe his Birth, I
have a greater for his Heroic Virtues; and David himself could not be more
tender of the Young man's Life, than I would be of his Reputation. But, since
the most excellent Natures are always the most easy; and, as being such, are
the soonest perverted by ill Counsels, especially when baited with Fame and
Glory; it is no more a wonder that he withstood not the temptation of
Achitophel, than it was for Adam not to have resisted the two Devils, the
Serpent and the Woman. The conclusion of the Story I purposely forbore to
prosecute, because I could not obtain from my self to show Absalom unfortunate.
The Frame of it was cut out but for a Picture to the wast; and if the Draught
be so far true, it is as much as I designed.

Were I the Inventer, who am only the Historian, I should certainly conclude
the Piece with the reconcilement of Absalom to David; And who knows but this
may come to pass? Things were not brought to an extremity where I left the
Story; there seems yet to be room left for a Composure, hereafter there may
only be for Pity. I have not so much as an uncharitable wish against
Achitophel, but am content to be acc^s'd of a good natured Error; and, to hope
with Origin, that the Devil himself may at last be saved. For which reason, in
this Poem, he is neither brought to set his House in order, nor to dispose of
his Person afterward, as he in wisdom shall think sit. God is infinitely
merciful, and his Vicegerent is only not so, because he is not Infinite.

The true end of Satyr, is the amendment of Vices by correction; And he who
writes honestly, is no more an enemy to the Offender, than the Physician to the
Patient, when he prescribes harsh Remedies to an inveterate Disease; for those
are only in order to prevent the Chirurgeon's work of an Ense Rescindendum,
which I wish not to my very enemies. To conclude all, If the Body Politic have
any Analogy to the Natural, in my weak judgment, an Act of Oblivion were as
necessary in a Hot, distempered State, as an Opiate would be in a raging Fever.

To the unknown Author of this Admirable Poem.
I Thought, forgive my sin, the boasted fire
Of Poets Souls did long ago expire;
Of Folly or of Madness did accuse
The Wretch that thought himself possessed with Muse;
Laugh't at the God within, that did inspire
With more than humane thoughts, the tuneful Quire;
But sure it is more than Fancy or the Dream
Of Rhimers slumbring by the Muses stream.
Some livelier spark of Heaven, and more refined
From earthly dross, fills the great Poet's mind.
Witness these mighty and immortal lines,
Through each of which the informing Genius shines.
Scarce a Diviner flame inspired the King,
Of whom thy Muse does so sublimely sing.
Not David's Self could in a Nobler Verse
His gloriously offending Son rehearse,
Tho in his Breast the Prophet's fury met,
The Father's Fondness, and the Poet's Wit.
Here all consent in Wonder and in Praise,
And to the unknown Poet Altars raise.
Which thou must needs accept with equal joy,
As when Aeoenas heard the Wars of Troy;
Wrapped up himself in darkness and unseen,
Extolled with Wonder by the Tyrian Queen.
Sure thou already art secure of Fame;
Nor want new Glories to exalt thy Name:
What Father else would have refused to own
So great a Son as God-like Absalon?
To the unknown Author of this Excellent Poem.
TAke it as earnest of a Faith renewed,
Your Theme is vast, your Verse divinely good;
Where tho the Nine their beauteous strokes repeat,
And the turned lines on golden Anvils beat,
It looks as if they struck 'em at a heat.
So all serenely great, so just, refined,
Like Angels love to humane seed inclined,
It starts a Giant, and exalts the kind.
It Is spirit seen, whose fiery Atoms roll
So brightly fierce, each syllable's a Soul:
It Is minature of man, but he is all heart;
It Is what the World would be, but wants the art.
To whom even the Phanaticks Altars raise,
Bow in their own despite, and grin your praise.
As if a Milton from the dead arose,
Filled off his rust, and the right party chose.
Nor, Sir, be shocked at what the gloomy say,
Turn not your feet too inward nor too splay;
It Is gracious all, and great; push on your Theme,
Lean your grieved head on David's Diadem;
David, that Rebel Israel's envy moved,
David, by God, and all good men beloved.
The Beauties of your Absalom excel,
But more the Charms of Charming Annabel;
Of Annabel, than May's first morn, more bright;
Cheerful as Summers Noon, and chaste as Winters Night.
Of Annabel, the Muses dearest Theme,
Of Annabel, the Angel of my dream.
Thus let a broken Eloquence attend,
And to your Masterpiece these shadows send.
ABSALOM and ACHITOPHEL.
A POEM
IN pious times, ever Priestcraft did begin,
Before Poligamy was made a sin;
When Man, on many, multiplied his kind,
Ever one to one was, cursedly, confined;
When Nature prompted, and no law denied
Promiscuous Use of Concubine and Bride;
Then, Israel's Monarch, after Heavens own heart,
His vigorous warmth did, variously, impart
To Wives and Slaves; And, wide as his Command,
Scattered his Maker's Image through the Land.
Michal, of Royal blood, the Crown did wear;
A Soil ungrateful to the Tiller's care;
Not so the rest; for several Mothers bore
To Godlike David several Sons before.
But since like slaves his bed they did ascend,
No True Succession could their seed attend.
Of all this Numerous Progeny was none
So beautiful so brave as Absolon:
Whether, inspired by some diviner Lust,
His Father got him with a greater Gust;
Or that his Conscious destiny made way,
By manly beauty to Imperial sway.
Early in Foreign fields he won Renown
With Kings and States allied to Isreal's Crown;
In Peace the thoughts of War he coud remove,
And seemed as he were only born for love.
What ever he did, was done with so much ease,
In him alone, 'twas Natural to please
His motions all accompanied with grace;
And Paradise was opened in his face.
With secret Joy, indulgent David viewed
His Youthful Image in his Son renewed:
To all his wishes Nothing he denied;
(...)
What faults he had (for who from faults is free?
His Father coud not, or he would not see.
Some warm excesses, which the Law forbore,
Were construed Youth that purged by boiling o'r;
And Amnon's Murder, by a specious Name,
Was called a Just Revenge for injured Fame.
Thus Praised, and Loved, the Noble Youth remained,
While David, undistutb'd in Sion reigned.
But Life can never be sincerely blessed;
Heaven punishes the bad, and proves the best.
The Jews, a Headstrong, Moody, Murmuring race,
As ever tried the extent and stretch of grace;
God's pampered people whom, debauched with ease,
No King could govern, nor no God could please;
(Gods they tried of every shape and size
That God-smiths could produce, or Priests devise;)
These Adam-wits, too fortunately free,
Began to dream they wanted liberty;
And when no rule, no president was found
Of men, by Laws less circumscribed and bound;
They led their wild desires to woods and Caves;
And thought that all but Savages were Slaves.
They who, when Saul was dead, without a blow,
Made foolish Isbosheth the Crown forgo;
Who banished David did from Hebron bring,
And, with a General Shout, Proclaimed him King:
Those very Jews, who, at their very best,
Their Humor more than Loyalty expressed,
Now, wondered why, so long, they had obeyed
An Idol-Monarch which their hands had made,
Thought they might ruin him they could create;
Or melt him to that Golden Calf, a State.
But these were random bolts, No formed Design,
Nor Intrest made the Factious Crowd to join:
The sober part of Israel, free from stain,
Well knew the value of a peaceful reign:
And, looking backward with a wise afright,
Saw Seames of wounds, dishonest to the sight:
In contemplation of whose ugly Scars,
They Cursed the memory of Civil Wars.
The moderate sort of men, thus qualified,
Inclined the Balance to the better side:
And, David's mildness managed it so well,
The Bad found no occasion to rebel.
But, when to Sin our byast Nature leans,
The careful Devil is still at hand with means,
And providently pimps for ill desires:
The good Old Cause revived, a Plot requires.
Plots, true or false, are necessary things,
To raise up Commonwealths, and ruin Kings.
The Inhabitants of old Jerusalem
Were Iebusites, the Town so called from them;
And their's the Native Right --
But when the chosen people grew more strong,
The rightful Cause at length became the wrong:
And every loss the men of Iebus bore,
They still were thought God's enemies the more:
Thus, worn and weakened, well or ill content,
Submit they must to David's Government:
Impoverished, and deprived of all Command,
Their Taxes doubled as they lost their Land;
And, what was harder yet to flesh and blood,
Their Gods disgraced and burnt like common wood:
This set the Heathen Priesthood in a flame;
For Priests of all Religions are the same:
Of whatsoever descent their Godhead be,
Stock, Stone, or other homely Pedigree,
In his defense his Servants are as bold,
As if he had been born of beaten Gold.
The Jewish Rabbis tho their enemies,
In this conclude them honest men and wise.
For 'twas their duty, all the Learned think,
TO espouse his Cause by whom they eat and drink.
From hence began that Plot, the Nation's curse,
Bad in it self, but represented worse.
Raised in extremes, and in extremes decry'd;
With Oaths affirmed, with dying Vows denied.
Not weighed, or winnow'd by the multitude;
But swallowed in the mass, unchew'd and crude.
Some Truth there was, but dashed and brewed with Lies;
To (...) Fool^, and puzzle all the Wise,
(...) did equal folly call,
(...), or believing all,
(...) Rites the ^ebusites embraced;
(...) were recomme^ded by their taste.
(...) mus^ needs be good,
(...) once for Worship and for Food.

So (...) was used, (the Sacri^icers trade,)
Fools are more hard to conquer than persuade.
Their busy (...) mingled ^ith the Jews;
And (...), for Convert^, even the Court and Stews:
Which Hebrew Priests the more unkindly took,
Because the Fleece accompanies the Flock.
Some thought they God's Anoint'd meant to slay
By Guns, invented since full many a day.
Our Author swears it not; b^t who can know
How ^ar the Devil and Iebusites may go?
This Plot, which failed ^or want of common sense,
Had yet a deep and dang^ro^s consequence:
For, as when raging Fevers boil the blood,
The standing Lake soon floats into a flood;
And every hostile humor, which before
Slept quiet in its Chann^^s, (...) o'r;

Of these the (...)
A Name to (...)
For close (...)
Sagacious, (...), and (...)
Restless, unfixt in Principle and Place;
In Power unpleas'd, impatient of Disgrace.
A fiery Soul, which working out its way,
Fretted the Pig^y-Body to decay;
And o'r informed the Tenement of Clay.
A daring Pilot in extremity;
Pleased with the Danger, when the Waves went high
He sought the Storms; but for a Calm un^it,
Would Steer to nigh the Sands, to boast his Wit,
Great Wits are sure to Madness near allied;
And thin Partitions do their Bounds divide:
Else, why should he, with Wealth and Honor blessed,
Refuse his Age the needful hours of rest?
Punish a Body which he coud not please;
Bankrupt of Life, yet Prodigal of ease?
And all to leave, what with his Toil he won,
To that unfeather'd, two legged thing, a Son:
Got, while his Soul did hudled Notions try;
And born a shapeless Lump, like Anarchy.
In friendship false, implacable in hate:
Resolved to ruin, or to Rule the State.
To compass this, the Triple Bond he broke;
The Pillars of the public Safety shook:
And fitted Israel for a Foreign Yoke.
Then, seized with Fear, yet still affecting Fame,
Usurped a Patriot's All-atoning Name.
So easy still it proves in factious times,
With public Zeal to cancel private crimes:
How safe is Treason, and how sacred ill,
Where none can sin against the peoples will:
Where Crowds can wink; and no o^^ence be known,
Since in another guilt they find their own.
Yet, Fame deserved, no Enemy can grudge;
The Statesman we abhor, but praise the Judge.
In Isreal's Courts never sat an Abbethdin
With more discerning eyes, or hands more clean:
Unbrib'd, unsought, the Wretched to redress;
Swi^t of Dispatch, and easy of Access.
Oh, had he been content to serve the Crown,
With virtues only proper to the Gown;
Or, had the rankness of the Soil been freed
From Cockle, that oppressed the Noble seed:
David, for him his tuneful Harp had strung,
And Heaven had wanted one Immortal song.
But wild Ambition loves to slide, not stand;
And Fortunes Ice prefers to Virtues Land:
Achitophel, grown weary to possess
A lawful Fame, and lazy Happiness;
Disdained the Golden Fruit to gather free,
And lent the Crowd his Arm to shake the Tree.
Now, manifest of Crimes, contrived long since,
He stood at bold Defiance with his Prince:
Held up the Buckler of the peoples Cause,
Against the Crown; and sculk'd behind the Laws.
The wished occasion of the Plot he takes;
Some circumstances finds, but more he makes.
By buzzing Emissaries, fills the ears
Of listening Crowds, with jealousies and fears
Of Arbitrary Counsels brought to light,
And proves the King himself a Iebusite:
Weak Arguments! which yet he knew full well,
Were strong with People easy to Rebel.
For, governed by the Moon, the giddy Jews
Tread the same track when she the Prime renews*
And once in twenty years, their Scribes Record,
By natural Instinct they change their Lord.
Achitophel still wants a Chief, and none
Was found so fit as Warlike Absalon:
Not, that he wished his Greatness to create,
(For Pol^titians neither love nor hate:)
But, for he knew, his Title not allowed,
Would keep him still depending on the Crowd,
That Kingly power, thus ebbing out, might be
Drawn to the dregs of a Democracy.
Him he attempts, with studied Arts to please.
And sheds his Venom, in such words as these
Auspicious Prince! at whose Nativity
Some Royal Planet ruled the Southern Sky;
Thy longing Countries Darling and Desire;
Their clowdy Pillar, and their ^uardian Fire:
Their second Moses, whose extended Wand
Divides the Seas, and shows the promised Land:
Whose dawning Day, in every distant age,
Has exercised the Sacred Prophets rage:
The peoples Prayer, the glad Diviners Theme,
The young men's Vision, and the old men's Dream!
Thee, Savior, Thee, the Nations Vows confess;
And, never satisfied with seeing, bless:
Swift, unbespoken Pomps, thy steps proclaim,
And stammering Babes are taught to lisp thy Name.
How long will thou the general Joy detain;
Starve, and defraud the people of thy Reign?
Content ingloriously to pass thy days
Like one of Virtues Fools that feeds on praise;
Till thy fresh Glories, which now shine so bright,
Grow stale and tarnish with our daily sight.
Believe me, Royal Youth, thy Fruit must be,
Or gathered ripe, or rot upon the Tree.
Heaven, has to all allotted, soon or late,
Some lucky Revolution of their Fate:
Whose motions, if we watch and guide with skill,
(For humane good depends on humane Will,)
Our Fortune rolls, as from a smoth descent,
And, from the first Impression, takes the bent:
But, if unseiz'd, she glides away like wind;
And leaves repenting Folly far behind.
Now, now she meets you, with a glorious prize,
And spreads her Locks before her as she flies.
Had thus old David, from whose Loins you spring,
Not dared, when Fortune called him, to be King,
At Gath an Exile he might still remain,
And Heavens Anointing Oil had been in vain.
Let his successful Youth your hopes engage;
But shun the example of Declining Age:
Behold him setting in his Western Skies,
The Shadows lengthning as the Vapors rise.
He is not now, as when on Jordan's sand
The joyful People thronged to see him Land,
Covering the Beach, and ^lackning all the Strand
But, like the Prince of Angels from his height,
Comes tumbling downward with diminished light;
Betrayed by one poor Plot to public Scorn,
(Our only blessing since his cursed Return.)
Those heaps of people which one Sheaf did bind,
Blown off, and scattered by a puss of wind:
What strength can he to your designs oppose,
Naked of Friends, and round beset with Foes?
If Pharaoh's doubtful Succor he should use,
A Foreign Aid would more incense the Jews:
Proud Egypt would dissembled Friendship bring*
Foment the War, but not support the King:
Nor would the Royal Party ever ^nite
With Pharoah's Arms, t'assist the Iebusite;
Or if they shoud, their Interest soon would break,
And, with such ^dious Aid, make David weak.
All sorts of men, by my successful Arts,
A^^orring Kings, estrange their altered Hearts
(...) And it is the general Cry,
(...), Commonwealth, and Liberty:
(...) Champion of the public Good,
And to their Arms a Chief of Royal Blood;
(...) hope, and what applause
(...) gain by such a cause?
Not (...) alone, that gaudy Flower,
(...) but solid Power:
(...) limited command,
(...) Love of all your native Land,
(...) Tit'e, long, and dark,
Drawn (...) the moldy Rolls of Noah's Ark.
What c^nn^t ^raise effect in mighty Minds,
(...) ^ooths, and when Ambition blinds!
(...) of Power, on earth a vicious weed,
(...) from High, is of Caelestial seed:
(...) And when men aspire,
(...) too much of Heavenly Fire.
(...) too covetous of Fame,
(...) of Angels Metal in his frame;
(...) was led from Virtues ways;
Made dr^nk with Honor, and debauched with praise.
Half loath, and half consenting to the ill,
(For Loyal B^ood within him strugled still)
He thus replied -- And what pretense have I
To take up Arms for public liberty?
My Father Governs with unquestioned right;
The Faiths Defender, and mankinds delight:
Good, gracious, just, observant of the Laws;
And Heaven by wonder has espoused his cause.
Whom has he wronged in all his Peaceful Reign?
Who sues for Justice to his Throne in vain?
What millions has he pardoned of his Foes,
Whom just revenge did to his wrath expose?
Mild, easy, humble, studious of our good;
Inclined to mercy, and averse from blood;
If mildness ill with stubborn Israel suit,
His crime is God's beloved Attribute.
What could he gain, his people to betray,
Or change his right, for arbitrary sway?
Let haughty Pharaoh curse with such a Reign,
His fruitful Nile, and yoke a servile Train.
If David's Rule Jerusalem displease,
The Dog Star heats their brains to this disease.
Why then shoud I, enco^raging the bad,
Turn Rebel, and run popularly mad?
Were he a Tyrant who, by lawless Might,
Oppressed the Jews, and raised the Iebusite,
Well might I mourn; but Natures hely bands
Would curb my spirits, and restrain my hand:
The people might assert their liberty;
But what was ^ight in them, were crime in me.
His ^avour (...) me nothing to require;
Prevents my wishes, and out-runs desire.
What (...) I expect while David lives?
All but (...) Diadem he gives;
And that: But there he paused; then sighing, said,
Is (...) for a worthier Head.
For when my Father from his toyls shall rest,
And (...) the number of the blessed:
(...) shall the Throne ascend;
Of (...) Line where that shall end.
His Brother, though oppressed with vulgar spite,
Yet dauntless and secure of native right,
Of every Royal Virtue stands possessed;
Still Dear to all the Bravest, and the Best.
His Courage Foes, his Friends his Truth Proclaim;
His Loyalty the King, the World his Fame.
His mercy even th'offending Crowd will find;
For sure he comes of a forgiving kind.
Why should I then repine at Heavens decree;
Which gives me no pretense to Royalty?
Yet oh that Fate, propitiously inclined,
Had raised my Birth, or had debased my mind;
To my large Soul, not all her treasure lent,
And then betrayed it to a mean Descent.
I find, I find my mounting spirits bold,
And David's part disdains my Mothers mold.
Why am I scanted by a niggard Birth?
My Soul disclaims the kindred of her Earth:
And made for Empire, whispers me within;
Desire of Greatness is a Godlike sin.
Him staggering so when Hells dire Agent found,
While fainting Virtue scarce maintained her ground,
He pours fresh Forces in, and thus replies:
The Eternal God, supreamly good and wise,
Imparts not these prodigious Gifts in vain;
What wonders are reserved to bless your Reign?
Against your will your Arguments have shown,
Such Virtue's only given to guide a Throne.
Not that your Father's mildness I contemn?
But manly force becomes the Diadem.
It Is true, he grants the people all they crave;
And more perhaps than Subjects ought to have:
For lavish grants suppose a Monarch tame,
And more his Goodness than his Wit proclaim.
B^t when should people strive their Bonds to break,
(...) not when Kings are negligent or weak?
(...) him give on till he can give no more,
The thri^ty Sanhedrin shall keep him poor:
And every (...) which he can receive,
Shall cost a ^imb of his Prerogative.
To ply him with new Plots, shall be my care;
Or plunge him deep in some expensive war;
Which, when his Treasure can no more supply*
He must, with the remains of Kingship, buy.
His faithful Friends, our jealousies and fears,
Call Iebusites; and Pharaoh's Pentioners:
Whom, when our fury from his aid has torn,
He shall be naked left to public scorn.
The next Successor, whom I fear and hate,
My arts have made obnoxious to the State;
Turned all his Virtues to his overthrow,
And gained our Elders to pronounce a foe.
His Right, for sums of necessary Gold,
Shall first be pawned, and afterward be sold:
Till time shall ever-wanting David draw,
To pass your doubtful Title into Law:
If not; the people have a Right supreme
To make their Kings; for Kings are made for them.
All Empire is no more than Power in trust:
Which when resumed, can be no longer just.
Succession, for the general good designed,
In its own wrong a Nation cannot bind:
If altering that, the people can relieve,
Better one suffer, than a Nation grieve.
The Jews well knew their power: ever Saul they chose,
God was their King, and God they durst depose.
Urge now your Piety, your Filial Name,
A Father's right, and fear of future Fame;
The public good, that universal call,
To which even Heaven submitted, answers all.
Nor let his Love enchant your generous mind;
It Is Natures trick to propagate her kind.
Our fond Begetters, who would never die,
Love but themselves in their posterity.
Or let his kindness by the effects be tried,
Or let him lay his vain pretense aside.
God said he loved your Father; coud he bring
A better proof, than to Anoint him King?
It surely showed he loved the Shepherd well,
Who gave so fair a Flock as Israel.
Would David have you thought his Darling Son?
What means he then, to Alienate the Crown?
The name of Godly he may blush to bear:
It Is after God's own heart to cheat his Heir.
He to his Brother gives Supreme Command;
To you a Legacy of Barren Land:
Perhaps the old Harp, on which he thrums his Lays:
Or some dull Hebrew Ballad in your praise.
Then the next Heir, a Prince, severe and wise,
Already looks on you with jealous eyes;
Sees through the thin disguises of your arts,
And marks your progress in the peoples hearts.
Though now his mighty Soul its grief contains;
He meditates revenge who least complains.
And like a Lion, slumbering in the way,
Or sleep-dissembling, while he waits his prey,
His fearless Foes within his distance draws;
Constrains his roaring, and contracts his paws:
Till at the last, his time for fury found,
He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground:
The prostrate Vulgar, passes o'r, and spares;
But with a Lordly rage, his Hunters tears.
Your case no tame expedients will afford;
Resolve on death, or conquest by the Sword,
Which for no less a Stake than Life, you draw;
And Self-defence is Natures eldest Law.
Leave the warm people no considering time;
For then Rebellion may be thought a crime.
Prevail your self of what occasion gives,
But try your Title while your Father lives:
And that your Arms may have a fair pretense,
Proclaim, you take them in the King's defense:
Whose sacred Life each minute would expose,
To Plots, from seeming friends, and secret foes.
And who can sound the depth of David's Soul?
Perhaps his fear, his kindness may control.
He fears his Brother, though he loves his Son,
For plighted Vows too late to be undone.
If so, by force he wishes to be gained;
Like women's leachery to seem constrained:
Doubt not; but when he most affects the Frown;
Commit a pleasing Rape upon the Crown.
Secure his Person to secure your Cause;
They who possess the Prince, possess the Laws.
He said, and this Advice above the rest,
With Absalom's mild nature suited best;
Unblam'd of Life (Ambition set aside,)
Not stained with cruelty, nor puffed with pride.
How happy had he been, if destiny
Had higher placed his Birth, or not so high!
His Kingly Virtues might have claimed a Throne;
And blessed all other Countries but his own:
But charming Greatness, since so few refuse;
It Is juster to lament him, than accuse.
Strong were his hopes a Rival to remove,
With blandishments to gain the public love;
To head the Faction while their Zeal was hot,
And popularly prosecute the Plot.
To farther this, Achitophel unites
The malcontents of all the Israelites:
Whose differing Parties he coud wisely join,
For several ends, to serve the same design.
The best, and of the Princes some were such,
Who thought the power of Monarchy too much:
Mistaken men, and Patriots in their hearts;
Not wicked, but seduced by impious arts.
By these the springs of Property were bent,
And would so high, they cracked the Government.
The next for Interest sought t'embroil the State,
To sell their duty at a dearer rate;
And make their Jewish Markets of the Throne:
Pretending public good, to serve their own.
Others thought Kings an useless heavy load,
Who cost too much, and did too little good.
These were for laying honest David by,
On Principles of pure good Husbandry.
With them joined all the Haranguers of the throng,
That thought to get Preferment by the ^o^gue.
Who follow next, a double danger br^ng,
Not only hating ^avid, but the King*
The Solymaean Rout; well versed of old,
In godly Faction, and in Treason bold;
Cowring and quaking at a Conqu'ror's sword,
But losty to a Lawful Prince restored;
Saw with disdain an Ethnic Plot begun,
And scorned by Iebusites to be outdone.
Hot Levites headed these; who pulled before
From the Ark, which in the Judges days they bore,
Resumed their Cant, and with a zealous cry
Pursued their old beloved Theocracy.
Where Sanhedrin and Priest enslaved the Nation,
And justified their spoils by inspiration:
For who so fit for Reign as Aaron's Race,
If once Dominion they could found in Grace?
These led the Pack; the not of surest scent,
Yet deepest mouthed against the Government.
A numerous Host of dreaming Saints succeed;
Of the true old Enthusiastic breed:
Against form and order they their Power employ;
Nothing to build, and all things to destroy.
But far more numerous was the herd of such,
Who think too little, and who talk too much.
These, out of mere instinct, they knew not why,
Adored their Father's God, and Property:
And, by the same blind benefit of Fate,
The Devil and the Jebusite did hate:
Born to be saved, even in their own despite;
Because they could not help believing right.
Such were the tools; but a whole Hydra more
Remains, of sprouting heads too long, to score.
Some of their Chiefs were Princes of the Land:
In the first rank of these did Zimri stand:
A man so various, that he seemed to be
Not one, but all mankind's epitome.
Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong;
Was every thing by starts, and nothing long:
But, in the course of one revolving Moon,
Was Chemist, Fiddler, Statesman, and Bussoon:
Then all for Women, Painting, Rhiming, Drinking;
Besides ten thousand freaks that di'd in thinking.
Blessed Madman, who coud every hour employ,
With something new to wish, or to enjoy!
Railing and praising were his usual theams,
And both (to show his judgment) in extremes:
So over-violent, or over-civil,
That every man, with him, was God or Devil.
In squandring wealth was his peculiar art:
Nothing went unrewarded, but desert.
Beggered by fools, whom still he found too late:
He had his Jest, and they had his Estate.
He laughed himself from Court; then sought relief
By ^^rming parties, but could never be Chief:
For* spite of him, the weight of business fell
On Absalom and wise Achitophel:
Thus, wicked but in will, of means bereft,
He left not Faction, but of that was left.
Titles and Names 'twere tedious to rehearse
Of Lords, below the dignity of Verse.
Wits, Warriors, Common-wealthsmen, were the best:
Kind Husbands and mere Nobles all the rest.
And, therefore in the name of dullness, be
The well hung Balaam, and cold Caleb free.
And canting Nadab let oblivion damn,
Who made new Porridge for the Paschal Lam^.
Let friendships holy band, some names assure:
Some their own worth, and some let scorn secure.
Nor shall the Rascal Rabble here have place,
Whom Kings no Titles gave, and God no Grace:
Not Bul^-fac'd Jonas, who co^d Stat^tes draw
To mean Rebellion, and make Treason Law.
But he though bad, is followed by a worse,
The wretch, who Heavens Anointed dared to c^rse.
Shimei, whose youth did early promise bring
Of zeal to God, and hatred to his King;
Did wisely from expensive sins re^rain,
And never broke the Sabbath, but for gain:
Nor ever was he known an Oath to vent,
Or curse, unless against the Government.
Thus heaping wealth by the most ready way
Among the Jews, which was to cheat and pray;
The City, to reward his pious Hate
Against his Master, chose him Magistrate:
His hand a Vare of Justice did uphold;
His Neck was loaded with a Chain of Gold.
During his Office, Treason was no Crime;
The Sons of Belial had a glorious Time:
For Shimei, though not prodigal of pelf,
Yet loved his wicked Neighbor as himself:
When to or three were gathered to declaim
Against the Monarch of Jerusalem,
Shimei was always in the midst of them.
And, if they Cursed the King when he was by,
Would rather Curse, than break good Company.
If any durst his Factious Friends accuse,
He pact a Jury of dissenting Jews:
Whose fellow-feeling, in the godly Cause,
Would free the suffering Saint from humane Laws.
For Laws are only made to punish those,
Who serve the King, and to protect his Foes.
If any leisure time he had from Power,
(Because it is Sin to misimploy an hour;)
His b^siness was, by writing, to Persuade,
That Kings were Useless, and a Clog to Trade:
And, that his noble Style he might refine,
No Rechabite more shund the fumes of Wine.
Chaste were his Cellars; and his Shrieval Board
The Grossness of a City Feast abhorred:
His Cooks, with long disuse, their Trade ^orgot;
Cool was his Kitchen; tho his Brains were hot.
Such ^rugall Virtue Malice may accuse;
But sure 'twas necessary to the Jews:
For Towns one bur^t, such Magistrates require
As dare not tempt Gods Providence by fire.
With spiritual food he fed his servants well,
But free from flesh that made the Jews Rebel:
And Moses's Laws he held in more account,
For forty days of F^sting in the Mount.
To speak the rest, who better are forgot,
Would tire a well breathed Witness of the Plot:
Yet, Corah, thou shall from oblivion pass;
Erect thy self thou Monumental Brass:
High as the Serpent of thy metal made,
While Nations stand secure beneath thy shade.
What tho his Birth were base, yet Comets rise
From earthy vapors ere they shine in Skies.
Prodigious Actions may as well be done
By Weaver's Issue, as by Prince's Son.
This Arch-Attestor for the public good,
By that one Deed Enobles all his Blood.
Who ever asked the Witnesses high race,
Whose Oath with Martyrdom did Stephen grace?
Ours was a Levite, and as times went then,
His Tribe were Godalmighty's Gentlemen.
Sunk were his eyes, his voice was harsh and loud,
Sure signs he neither choleric was, nor proud:
His long chin proved his wit; his Saintlike grace
A Church Vermilion, and a Moses's face;
His memory, miraculously great,
Could Plots, exceeding man's belief, repeat;
Which, therefore cannot be accounted lies,
For humane wit coud never such devise.
Some future Tr^ths are mingled in his Book;
But, where the witness failed, the Prophet spoke:
Some things like visionary slights appear;
The Spirit caught him up, the Lord knows where:
And gave him his Rabinical degree
Unknown to Foreign University.
His judgment yet his memory did excel;
Which peic'd his wondrous Evidence so well:
And suited to the temper of the times;
Then groaning under Jebusitick crimes.
Let Israel, foes suspect his heavenly call,
And rashly judge his wit Apocryphal;
Our Laws for such affronts have for^eits made:
He takes his li^e, who takes away his trade.
Were I my sel^ in witness Corahs place,
The wretch who did me such a dire disgrace,
Should whet my memory, though once forgot,
To make him an A^pendix of my Plot.
His zeal to Heaven, made him his Prince despise,
And load his person with indignities:
But zeal peculiar privilege affords;
Indulging latitude to deeds and words.
And Corah might for Agag's murder call,
In terms as course as Samuel used to Saul.
What others in his Evidence did join,
(The best that coud be had for love or coin,)
In Corah's own predicament will fall:
For witness is a common name to all.
Surrounded thus with friends of every sort,
Deluded Absalom, forsakes the Court:
Impatient of high hopes, urged with renown:
And fired with near possession of a Crown,
The admiring Crowd are dazzled with Surprise,
And on his goodly person feed their eyes:
His Joy Concealed, he sets himself to show:
On each side bowing popularly low:
His looks, his gestures, and his words he frams,
And with familiar ease repeats their Names.
Thus, formed by Nature, furnished out with Arts,
He glides unfelt into their secret hearts:
Then, with a kind compassionating look,
And sighs, bespeaking pity ever he spoke:
Few words he said; but easy those and fit:
More slow than Hybla drops, and far more sweet.
I mourn, my Countrymen, your lost Estate;
Tho far unable to prevent your sat:
Behold a Banished man, for your dear cause
Exposed a prey to Arbitrary Laws!
Yet oh! that I alone coud be undone,
Cut of from Empire, and no more a Son!
Now all your Liberties a spoil are made;
Egypt and Tyrus intercept your Trade,
And Iebusites your Sacred Rites invade.
My Father, whom with reverence yet I Name,
Charmed into Ease, is careless of his Fame:
And, bribed with petty sums of Foreign Gold,
Is grown in Batsheba's Embraces old:
Exalts his Enemies, his Friends destroys:
And all his power against himself employs.
He gives, and let him give my right away:
But why should he his own, and yours betray?
He only, he can make the Nation bleed,
And he alone from my revenge is freed.
Take then my tears (with that he wiped his Eyes)
It Is all the Aid my present power supplies:
No Court Informer can these Arms accuse;
These Arms may Sons against their Fathers use,
And, it is my wish, the next Successor's Reign
May make no other Israelite complain.
Youth, Beauty, Graceful Action, seldom fail:
But Common Interest always will prevail:
And pity never Ceases to be shown
To him, who makes the peoples wrongs his own.
The Crowd, (that still believe their Kings oppress)
With lifted hands their young Messiah bles^:
Who now begins his Progress to ordain;
With Chariots, Horsemen, and a numerous train:
From East to West his Glories he displaies:
And, like the Sun, the promised Land survays.
Fame runs before him as the Morning Star;
And shouts of Joy salute him from afar:
Each house receives him as a Guardian God;
And Consecrates the place of his abode;
But hospitable treats did most commend
Wise Issachar, his wealthy western friend.
This moving Court, that caught the peoples Eyes:
And seemed but pomp, did other ends disguise.
Achitophel had formed it with intent
To sound the depth, and fathom where it went:
The people's hearts, distinguish Friends from Foes;
And try their strength, before they come to blows
Yet all was colored with a smooth pretense
Of specious love, and duty to their Prince.
Religion, and Redress of Grievances,
Two names, that always cheat and always please,
Are often urged; and good king David's li^e
Endangered by a Brother and a Wife.
Thus in a Pageant Show, a Plot is made;
And Peace it self is War in Masquerade.
Oh foolish Israel! never warned by ill,
Still the same bait, and circumvented still!
Did ever men forsake their present ease,
In midst of health Imagine a desease;
Take pains Contingent mischiefs to foresee,
Make Heirs for Monarchs, and for God decree?
What shall we think! can people give away
Both for themselves and Sons, their Native sway?
Then they are left Defensless, to the Sword
Of each unbounded Arbitrary Lord:
And Laws are vain, by which we Right enjoy,
If Kings unquestioned can those laws destroy.
Yet, if the Crowd be Judge of fit and Just,
And Kings are only Officers in trust,
Then this resuming Covenant was declared
When Kings were made, or is for ever barred:
If those who gave the Scepter, could not tie
By their own deed their own Posterity,
How then coud Adam bind his future Race?
How coud his for^eit on mankind take place?
Or how coud heavenly Justice damn us all,
Who never consented to our Fathers fall?
Then Kings are slaves to those whom they Command,
And Tenants to their Peoples pleasure stand.
Add, that the Power for property allowd,
Is mischeivously seated in the Crowd:
For who can be secure of private Right,
If Sovereign sway may be dissolved by might?
Nor is the Peoples Judgment always true:
The most may err as grossly as the few.
And faultless Kings run down, by Common Cry,
For Vice, Oppression, and for Tyranny.
What Standard is there in a ^ickle rout,
Which, flowing to the mark, runs faster out?
Nor only Crowds, but Sanhedrins may be
Infected with this public lunacy:
And share the madness of rebellious times,
To marther Monarchs for imagined crimes.
If they may give and take whn ever they please,
Not Kings alone, (the Godheads Images,)
But Government it self at length must fall
To Natures state, where all have right to all.
Yet, grant our Lords the people Kings can make,
What prudent men a settled Throne would shake?
For whatsoever their sufferings were before,
That change they covet makes them suffer more.
All other Errors but disturb a State;
But Innovation is the blow of Fate.
If ancient Fabrics nod, and threat to fall,
To patch the flaws, and buttress up the wall,
Thus far it is duty; but here fix the mark:
For all beyond it is to touch our Ark.
To change Foundations, cast the Frame anew,
Is work for Rebels who base Ends pursue:
At once Divine and Humane Laws control;
And mend the parts by ruin of the whole.
The Tamp'ring World is subject to this Curse,
To Physic their Disease into a worse.
Now what relief can Righteous David bring?
How Fatal it is to be too good a King!
Friends he has few, so high the Madness grows;
Who dare be such, must be the peoples Foes,
Yet some there were, even in the worst of days;
Some let me name, and Naming is to praise.
In this short File Barzillai first appears;
Barzillai crowned with Honor and with Years,
Long since, the rising Rebels he withstood
In Regions waste, beyond the Iordans Flood,
Unfortunately Brave to buoy the Sat;
But sinking underneath his Master's Fate,
In exile with his Godlike Prince he mourned;
For him he Suffered, and with him Returned.
The Court he practiced, not the Courtier's art;
Large was his Wea^th, but larger was his Heart;
Which, well the Noblest Objects knew to choose,
The Fighting Warrior, and Recording Muse.
His bed could once a Fruitful Issue boast,
Now more than half a Father's Name is lost.
His eldest hope, with every Grace adorned,
By me (so Heaven will have it) always mourned,
And always honored, snatched in manhoods prim^
B' unequal fates, and providence crime;
Yet not before the Goal of Honor won,
All parts fulfil^'d of Subject and of Son;
Swift was the Race, but short the time to run.
Oh narrow circle, but of Power divine,
Scanted in space, but perfect in thy Line!
By Sea, by Land, thy matchless worth was known;
Arms thy delight, and War was all thy own:
Thy force, infused, the fainting Tyrians prop'd:
And haughty Pharaoh found his Fortune stopped.
Oh ancient Honor, oh unconquered hand,
Whom foes unpunished never coud withstand!
But Israel was unworthy of thy Name;
Short is the date of all immoderate fame.
It looks as Heaven our ruin had designed,
And durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind.
Now, free from earth, thy disencumbred Soul
Mounts up, and leaves behind the Clouds and starry Pole:
From thence thy kindred legions may thou bring
To aid the guardian Angel of thy King.
Here stop my Muse, here cease thy painful slight;
No pinions can pursue immortal height:
Tell good Barzillai thou can sing no more,
And tell thy soul she should have ^^ed before;
Or fled she with his life, and left this Verse
To hang on her departed Parton's Hearse?
Now take thy steepy flight from Heaven, and see
If thou can find on earth another He;
Another He would be too hard to find,
See then whom thou can see not far behind:
Zadock the Priest, whom, shunning power and place,
His lowly mind advanced to David's Grace:
With him the Sagan of Jerusalem,
Of hospitable soul, and noble stem;
Him of the western dome, whose weighty sense
Flows in fit words, and heavenly Eloquence.
The Prophets sons by such example led,
To Learning and to Loyalty were bred:
For Colleges on bounteous Kings depend,
And never Rebel was to Arts a friend.
To these succeed the Pillars of the Laws,
Who best coud plead, and best can judge a Cause.
Next them a train of Loyal Peers ascend:
Sharp judging Adriel, the Muses friend,
Himself a Muse; -- In Sanhedrins debate
True to his Prince; but not a Slave of State.
Whom David's love with Honors did adorn,
That from his disobedient Son were torn.
Iotham of piercing wit, and pregnant thought,
Indu'd by Nature, and by Learning taught
To move Assemblies, who but only tried
The worse awhile, then chose the better side;
Nor chose alone, but turned the balance too;
So much the weight of one brave man can do.
Hushai the friend of David in distress,
In public storms of manly stedfastness;
By foreign Treaties he informed his Youth;
And joined experience to his native truth.
His frugal care supp'y'd the wanting Throne,
Frugal for that, but bounteous of his own:
It Is easy conduct when Exchequers flow,
But hard the task to manage well the low:
For Soverereign Power is too deprest or high,
When Kings are forced to sell, or Crowds to buy.
Indulge one labor more, my weary Muse,
For Amiel, who can Amiel's praise refuse?
Of ancient Race by Birth, but Nobler yet
In his own worth, and without Title great:
The Sanhedrin-long time as Chief he ruled,
Their Reason guided, and their Passion cooled;
So dextrous was he in the Crown's defense,
So formed to speak a Loyal Nations sense,
That as their Band was Israel's Tribes in small,
So fit was he to represent them all.
Now rasher Charioteers the Seat ascend,
Whose loose Carriers his steady Skill commend:
They, like the unequal Ruler of the day,
Misguide the seasons, and mistake the way;
While he withdrawn at their mad labor smiles,
And safe enjoys the Sabbath of his toyls.
These were the chief, a small, but faithful Band
Of Worthies, in the Breach who dared to stand,
And tempt the united Fury of the Land.
With grief they viewed such powerful Engines bent,
To batter down the lawful Government.
A numerous Faction with pretended frights,
In Sanhedrins to plume the Regal Rights.
The true Successor from the Court removed:
The Plot, by hireling Witnesses improved,
These Ills they saw, and as their Duty bound,
They showed the King the danger of the Wound:
That no concessions from the Throne would please,
But Lenitives fomented the Disease:
That Absalom, ambitious of the Crown,
Was made the Lure to draw the People down:
That false Achitophel's pernicious Hate,
Had turned the Plot to ruin Church and State:
The Council violent, the Rabble worse:
That Shimei taught Jerusalem to curse.
With all these loads of injuries oppressed,
And long revolving in his careful Breast,
The event of things; at last his patience tired,
Thus from his Royal Throne by Heaven inspired,
The God-like David spoke; with awful fear
His Train their Maker in their Master hear
Thus long have I, by native mercy swayed
My wrongs dissembled my revenge delayed:
So willing to forgive the Offending Age;
So much the Father did the King assuage.
But now fo far my Clemency they slight,
The offenders question my forgiving right.
That one was made for many, they contend:
But it is to Rule, for that is a Monarch's end.
They call my tenderness of Blood, my fear:
Though manly tempers can the longest bear.
Yet, since they will divert my Native course,
It Is time to show I am not good by force,
Those heaped Affronts that hauty subjects bring,
Are burdens for a Camel, not a King:
Kings are the public Pillars of the State,
Born to sustain and prop the Nations weight
If my Young Samson will pretend a Call
To shake the Column, let him share the Fall
But oh that yet he would repent and live!
How easy it is for Parents to forgive!
With how few Tears a Pardon might be wo^
From Nature, pleading for a Darling Son!
Poor pitied Youth, by my Paternal care,
Raised up to all the height his frame coud bear:
Had God ordained his fate for Empire born,
He would have given his Soul another turn:
Gulled with a Patriot's name, whose modern sense
Is one that would by Law Supplant his Prince:
The Peoples Brave, the Politicians Tool;
Never was Patriot yet, but was a Fool.
Whence comes it that Religion and the Laws
Should more be Absalom's than David's Cause?
His old Instructor, e're he lost his place,
Was never thought indu'd with so much Grace:
Good Heavens, how Faction can a Patriot paint!
My Rebel ever proves my peoples Saint:
Would They impose an Heir upon the Throne?
Let Sanhedrims be taught to give their own.
A King's at least a part of Government;
And mine as requisite as their Consent:
Without my leave a future King to choose,
Infers a Right the present to Depose:
True, they Petition me to approve their Choice!
But Esau's hand suit ill with Jacob's voice.
My pious Subjects for my safety pray,
Which to secure they take my Power away.
From Plots and Treasons Heaven preserve my years,
But save me most from my Petitioners.
Unsatiate as the barren Womb or ^r^ve.
God cannot grant so much as they can Crave.
What then is left but with a jealous Eye
To guard the small remains of Royalty?
The Law shall still direct my peaceful Sway,
And the same Law teach Rebels to obey:
Votes shall no more established Power control,
Such Votes as make a part exceed the whole:
No groundless Clamours shall my Friends remove,
Nor Crowds have power to punish e're they prove:
For Gods, and Godlike Kings their Care express,
Still to defend their servants in distress.
Oh that my Power to saving were confined;
Why am I forced, like Heaven, against my mind,
To make Examples of another kind?
Must I at length the Sword of Justice draw?
Oh cursed Effects of necessary Law!
How ill my Fear they by my Mercy scan,
Beware the Fury of a patient Man.
Law they require, let Law then show her face;
They coud not be content to look on Grace,
Her hinder parts, but with a during Eye
To tempt the terror of her Front, and dye.
By their own Arts it is righteously decreed,
Those dire Artificers of Death shall bleed.
Against themselves their Witnesses will swear
Till Viper-like their Mother Plot they tear:
And suck for Nutriment that bloody gore
Which was their Principle of Life before.
Their Belial with their Beelzebub will fight;
Thus on my Foes, my Foes shall do me right:
Nor doubt the event: for factious crowds engage
In their first Onset, all their Brutal Rage;
Then, let 'em take an unresisted course,
Retire and Traverse, and delude their force:
But when they stand all breathless, urge the fight,
And rise upon 'em with redoubled might:
For lawful Power is still Superior found,
When long driven back, at length it stands the ground.
He s^^d. The Almighty, nodding, gave consent;
And P^als of Thunder shook the F^rmament:
Henceforth a Ser^es of new time began,
The m^ghty Years in long* Procession ran:
Once more the G^dli^ David was Restored*
And (...) knew their Lawful Lord.
