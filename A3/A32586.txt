By the King.
A PROCLAMATION For the Restraining all His Majesty's Subjects but the
East India Company, to Trade to the EAST INDIES.
CHARLES R.

WE being sensible how much it imports the welfare of this Our Realm, That the
Trade to the East Indies be Maintained and Encouraged, and that the present
East India Company have for diverse years last past managed and carried on the
same to the Honor and Profit of the Nation; And being given to understand that
some of Our Subjects minding more their particular gain than the general good,
have of late presumed to Trade into those Parts upon their private account, and
that other of Our Subjects are preparing and fitting out Ships for that
purpose, which if permitted, will soon destroy the said Company, and endanger
the losing that whole Trade to the Nation, as it happened in the late
licentious Times, when by laying open the said Trade, it was almost lost, and
had been wholly lost, had it not been retrieved and recovered by the great
Industry and Charge of the said Company, who are still at vast Charge and
Expense to Preserve and Maintain the same: Which attempts of the said Private
Traders, We apprehend may arise as well from their ignorance of what Liberties
and Privileges We have Granted to the said Company touching the said Trade,
and of Our Royal Prohibition therein to all other Our loving Subjects, as also
of the Law, That none of Our Subjects ought to Trade or Traffic with Infidels,
or Barbarous Nations not in Amity with Us, and who are not holden by any League
or Treaty, have therefore thought fit by this Our Royal Proclamation to Declare
and Publish, That We by Our Letters Patents bearing Date at Westminster the
Third day of April, in the Thirteenth year of Our Reign, have Granted to the
said East India Company, the whole and entire Trade of the said East Indies,
and of all Places where any Trade is to be had from the Cape of Bona Speranza
to the Streights of Magellan, and have thereby straightly Prohibited all other
Our Subjects, of what Degree or Quality soever, to Visit, Haunt, Frequent, or
Trade, Traffic, or Adventure by way of Merchandise, into or from the said
East Indies, or any the Places aforesaid, without the License of the said
Company, upon pain of incurring Our High Displeasure, and the forfeiture and
loss of the Goods and Merchandises, as also of the Ship and Ships, with the
Furniture thereof, wherein such Goods or Merchandises shall be brought or found
Trading or Trafficking contrary to Our said Prohibition. And that all Offenders
in the Premises may be rendered altogether inexcusable, We have thought fit to
Publish and Declare Our Royal Pleasure to be, And We do hereby strictly
Prohibit and Forbid all and every of Our loving Subjects Whatsoever, except the
said Company and their Successors, and others Trading by the said Companies
License, to Trade into, Visit or Haunt the said East Indies, or any Part,
Creek, Haven, or Place within the said Companies Charter, upon pain of Our High
Displeasure, and of being proceeded against as Contemners of Our Laws and Royal
Authority, and also of incurring the Forfeiture and Loss of the Goods and
Merchandises, and the Ships or Vessels with their Furniture, which shall bring
or carry the same to or from the said East Indies, and all other the Places
within the Limits of the said Charter by Us Granted to the said Company. And to
the end Our Will and Pleasure herein may be the better observed, We do hereby
also strictly Require and Command Our Governors, Deputy-Governors, Admirals,
Vice-Admirals, Generals, Judges of Our Courts of Admiralty, Commanders of Our
Forts and Castles, Captains of Our Royal Ships, Provost Marshals, Marshals,
Comptrollers, Collectors of Our Customs, Waiters, Searchers, and all other Our
Officers and Ministers Civil and Military, by Sea or Land, in all or every Our
Foreign Dominions and Plantations, and also all and singular Captains and
Commanders of Ships Employed, or to be Employed in the Service of the said
East India Company, to be Aiding and Assisting to Attack, Arrest, Take and
Seize for Our Use, the Ship or Ships, Vessel or Vessels, with their Furniture,
Goods, Wares and Merchandises of all and every Our Subjects, other than the
said Company and their Successors, and such as shall be Employed or Licensed by
them, which they shall find on Sea or Land, within the Limits of Our said
Charter Granted to the said Company, according to the Tenor of Our Royal
Charter Granted to the said Company, and to proceed to Condemnation thereof in
any of Our Courts in Our said Foreign Dominions and Plantations, upon pain of
Our High Displeasure, and as they will answer the contrary at their perils.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall this Sixteenth day of November 1681, and in
the Three and thirtieth Year of Our Reign.
GOD SAVE THE KING.
