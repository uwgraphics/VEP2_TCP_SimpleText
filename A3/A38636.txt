AN ESSAY Toward the Clearer Discovering Of the True Beginnings, Durations and
Endings, of each Particular KING in Judah and Israel; and the Two LINES
thereof, Compared and Adjusted, according to the Scriptures Referring
thereunto; and, in Order to Understanding of the Reference of those 390, and 40
Days, Mentioned Ezekiel 4th. v. 5, 6.

Upon Enquiry thereinto, and Examination thereof, I Premise 2 or 3 things. (1.)
That Rehoboams and Jereboams Reigns must Begin much together; Else the 18th of
Jeroboam's could not be the First of Abijahs, and his 20th the Beginning of
Asa's, KINGS of Judah. (2.) That there is a Dispute with some, whether Jehoram,
Jehosaphat's Son, and King of Judah, did Reign 8 years or 4? some say the
latter, (and 4 more only with his Father. But to clear, that there must be 8 to
him alone (or 4 more to his Father and him, which amounts to the same Number of
Years.) I offer this; That Jehu (King of Israel) and Athaliah (Q. of Judah)
Began to Reign at the same time, (for Ahaziah of Judah, and Jehoram (or Joram)
of Israel, their next Predecessors, fell together by the same hand, viz. of
Jehu, 2 Kings 9.24. and 27 verses.) See Chap. 11. 4. and 12. 1. (3.) Whereas
some give 29 years to Amaziah (King of Judah) and 52 to Azariah (or Vzziah) his
Son, I allot 11 years less (to one or the other) as appears by what follows:
And so lets proceed to see how the years of each Line of Kings concur herewith;
first to Athalia and Jehu; and afterward to the end of the Line, whilst the
Kings of Israel did jointly continue with the Kings of Judah, and so at last,
to the remainder of the Kings of Judah ending in Zedekiah; when the Kings of
Israel had ceased in Hoshea before.

he is said to Reign; 11 years is to be reckoned to his Fathers 29. And so he
Reigned solely (2 Kings 14. 23. with 15. 28.)

too large to Insert here.

Reigned (v. 17.) 10 17 Pekahiah. Began the said 50th of Ahaziah, and End ed his
52d, 2 Kings 15. 23. and 27. Reigning (v. 23.) 2 11 Jotham. Began the Beginning
of the Second Pekah (King of Israel) and Ended his 17th, 2 Kings 15. 32. with
16. 1. and Reigned Alone (Chapter 15. 33.) 16 years. And from the ground here
mentioned (and Pekah's Reign in Israel) it seems he Reigned about 4 Years with
his Son Ahaz, and so called the 20th Jotham, which some conceive (it may be)
because of his 4 years before in his Fathers time, as Viceroy, 2 Kings 15. 5.
for otherwise he Reigned about 16. But, I rather think about 4 more was with
his Son aforesaid, (which made his 16 Alone to be the 20th) who, being King
with his Father, Began the 17th of Pehah, and so continued together to Pekah's
20; (when Ahaz Alone, and Hoshea also as Tributary Began) which Harmonizes, as
thus appears; Pekah began about the 1 year before Jotham, 2 Kings 15. 27 And
Jotham's 19, with Ahaz's 16, and Hezekiah's 6, make 41. So Peka's 20, and
Hoshea 21, in all (who slew Pekah and Reigned in his stead (makes the same
number 41. Now, since these 4 last years was Current, I allow but 3, and Ahaz
16 complete (or 35 between 16 18 Pekah Began the 52d, Ditto; Ending the 20th of
Jotham, and the 3d or 4th of Ahaz (2 Kings 16. 1.) then Reigning with his
Father: which was his First Alone (as appears by Hoshea's Absolute Reign of 9
years, Begun with the 12th of Ahaz, 2 Kings 17. 1.) and, whose 3d (of his 9th)
Ended about his 15th complete, for then Hezekiah Began, 2 King* 18. 1.)
otherwise the 17th of Pekah, taking in his 20th, would not be 4, and his 12 to
Hoshea's First, and 3 more, would not make 19. But taking Pekah's 20th to be
Ahaz's First Alone, and his 12 to the First of Hoshea's 9 and 3 Mo^ to his 3d,
makes 15 complete. Pekah Reigning (Chap. 15. 27.) 20 3 19 Hoshea Began the last
Jotham (and First of Ahaz Alone) as Tributary, (slaying then Pekah) and so
continued to Ahaz's 12, and thence Began his 9 Years more Absolute, (see 2
Kings 15. 30. with 17. ^.) Now his 9 (last years) could not be from the 20th of
Jotham, when he slew Pekah, and Reigned in his stead; for they Began in Ahaz's
12th, who must Then Begin Alone; Therefore, as said from Jotham's 20th, and
consequently Hoshea, as Tributrary KINGS of Judah Times of their Reign, with

3d Year, the latter end, and so his 9th (when the Kings of Israel ceased (by
their Captivity) was -- 6 All these Kings hitherto amount to -- 252 But it may
be Objected; I have allowed the whole 98 years of the Kings of Israel, to make
up their Total 253, to Adjust with Judah's so many years, to the 6th of
Hezekiah. Whereas, 3 of those 98, I have granted to be taken off, to Adjust
them with the first Division of Judah's 95. And therefore here is 2 years short,
in the 2d. Division; to make up the years of the Kings of Israel, to accord
with Judah's 25^ aforesaid. This I Acknowledge; and Answer in the General,
first; That the greater Confusions in the Kingdom of Israel (there being 4
Kings therein, in about One years space, 2 Kings 15.8. ^8.) Calls for the years
of Israel's Kings to Accommodate with Judah's; Rather than Judah's with
Israel's; the Line also of the 390 being carried through the Kings of Judah,
and not of Israel's (though I have made use of them, as a Collateral Proof to
the Times of some of the Kings of Judah, which are more disputable,) and more
Particularly; some have Allowed Inter-Regnums among the Kings of Israel: I
shall only now Instance what I note my self; Between Jehu and Jehoahaz (his
Son.) If we Allow Athaliab 7 years, and then to Joash (succeeding her in Judah)
his 23d Current, there is 29 years, when Jehoabaz, the Son of Jehu, Began to
Reign; whereas I have allowed Jehu 28. (here one allows an Inter-regnum of 2
years,) and so as to some others (as Menahem, see 2 Kings 15. 17. with v. 22.
from 39 to 50, is above 10 years,) which I shall leave to others, of greater
Abilities, (that may also have greater helps than I have had) to find out to
their own, or others Satisfaction. Thus, if rightly done, here is a pretty fair
Agreement. And so I proceed with the Remainder of the Kings of Judah, till the
last ceased, when their Captivity of 70 years was Begun. And 6 of Hezekiahs
being already set down, the Remainder is (Reigning 29. 2 Kings 29.) 23 14
Manasses, Reigned, 2 Kings 21. 1. 5^ 15 Amon, Reigned, v. 19. 2 16 Josiah,
Reigned, Chap. 22. 1. 31 17 Jehoahaz, Reigned, Chap. 23. 31. -- Monohs 3. 18
Jehojakim. Reigned, v. 36. 11 19 Jehoiachin, Reigned, Chap. 24. 8. -- Months 3.
20 Zedekiah, Reigned, v. 18. and Chapter 25. 2. 11 The Total of all the Kings of
Judah from Solomon -- is -- 385 Now here is near 5 years short of the 390. in
Ezekiel. 4. Therefore if we Begin them (according to KINGS of Judah. Times of
their Reigning, with the Kings of Israel. with Scriptures proving them. Junius)
at the 27th of Solomon, when he Degenerated into Sensuality, Loving Strange
Wives, contrary to the Word of God, 1 Kings 11. 1. 4. and thereby into
Idolatry, v. 9, 10, 11. and Against whom the Lord stirred up 3 Enemies in his
days, v. 14. 16. and if we take his 27th to his 40th Inclusive, there is -- 16
Years; which makes up the Number of-385 Years, 6 Months. To be -- Which is
beyond our Sum; But take out the 11 years of Zedekiah's Reign, 401 and 6
Months. 11. At which time of Jehoachin, the 70 years Captivity did Begin, as is
Apparent, and there is 390 Years 6 Months so near our Sum.

But, Against this Reference it may be Objected; That Ezekiel Prophesied this
after Jehojachin's Captivity, and therefore the Siege in his Reign and
Captivity thereupon, cannot be the Reference of the 390 Days.

To which I Reply: The Occasion and End of Ezekiels Prophesing thus, was to
Consirm what Jeremy had before Prophesied of the 70 Years Captivity and
Destruction of the City and Temple, in order to Convince some (both in
Jerusalem and Babylon) that Jeremy was a True Prophet, and others withstanding
him were False Prophets (see Jer. 28. beginning, and Chap. 29, 8, etc. and ver.
24, etc.) As also to strengthen the Captives (already in Babylon) some of which
at least, might begin to Repent, that they had hearkened to Jeremy, and yielded
to the King of Babylon, Jeremy having Prophesied as aforesaid: Whereas both
Temple and City stood still now 5 years after. Therefore Ezekiel here lays
before them (it may be) both the Time to the Captivity (now already begun from
the first Siege and Surrendering of the City) and the Duration of the after
Siege and Taking of the City and Destruction of it, together with the Temple;
as a further Confirmation that what Jeremy had Prophesied, and was in part
fulfilled, should fully be Accomplished by this Siege of the City, which he
Typically Represented to the (it may be) with the time of its Continuance. And
we need not account it improbable that the ^90 may have such a Twofold
Reference, both to the time of the Lords (...) bearing with (...) their bearing

21. 2. But it may be said, If Both may be Included in the House of (...) Why
then is the House of Judah Particularly Expressed after with the ^^ days* To
which I Answer, It may be upon a double account. (1*) Because the Kingdom of
Judah was continued longer than that of Israel (2.) As it had also a more
Peculiar Respect from God* in part expressed, by the Prophets Right side, when
Israel's was signified by his Left, v. 4. 6. the Lord therefore not only
Bearing longer with it, 1 Kings 15. 4. But also more graciously striving with
them by the Ministry of Jeremy, which, from the 13th of (...), to the (...)
end of that Kingdom in (...)'s Captivity, was much about 40 years, (though some
refer those 40 years to the 40 or Manasses Ill Reign) wherein, God in a special
manner Bore with the House of Judah. And whereas a late Writer, in his Line of
Time, makes these 40 years Consequent to the 390, and not Included; I see no
ground for it; but rather, (as Mr. (...) not Additional, though Distinct from the
other Number, and which (...) Writer therefore makes the 390 years Reach to the

Appear, that Types or Visions did cease, till Ezekiels? Was not (...) and
Josiah (especially) some Adumbration and Shadow thereof? And had not (...) and
Jeremy (Between those times mentioned, many Visions, of at least Prophetical
Discoveries of it? Isa. 32. 33. Chap. 44. 26, etc. Jer. 23. 5. 6. 7. Chapter 25.
12. and 29. 10. Chap. 30. 8, 9, 10. with other places.

Now, as Solomon's Kingdom, Temple, and the Glory of the Jenish Church, did
soon Decay, and Gradually Degenerate, until at last, All were Seized by the
King of Babylon; 390 years from Solomon's 27th to Jeconiah's Captivity (and
very nigh that time from Solomon's Death to Zedekiah's Captivity, when Temple
and City was Destroyed) which things were Types: So did the Spiritual Glory of
Gospel-Temples (as also did that Emblem of Christ's Temporal Kingdom afterward
in Constantine, etc.) Pass Away, by Degrees, (25 years After the Resurrection,
says that aforesaid late Writer) until they fell into that Antichristian
Apostasy and Captivity Begun about 390 from Christ's Birth (as some have fixed
it, on Other Grounds; though others, about 425 from Celestin's Claiming Temporal
Power too; which was about one year more from Christ's Death.) Now whether
these 390, Ezekiel. 4., Chapter may not Indigitate the Time of Antichrist's Rise, I
leave to Consideration. Since as the 70 years Captivity were Typical of
Antichrist's 42 Months (or 1260 days.) And 70 being Multiplied, first (...) by
3, and then again by 6 (Both Mystic Numbers) makes ^260 (or 42 Months) which
Number 6, is more Remarkable in this matter, As Used with Respect to Trials,
and Greater Judgments, viz. Troubles (Job 5. 19.) 6 Slaughter-men, (Ezekiel. 7.2.)
6 (First) Trumpets, Introducing Antichrist and other Plagues: and 6 things the
Lord Hates (Prove. 6. 16) All which, (with the 7th there also) are Remarkably in
the Papacy; as Also making up that Number of the Beast (Rev. 13. 18.) 666.
Consisting of 3 Six's, whether Applied (as some) to Numeral Letters in Romanus,
or (...), Or because 666 is the Square Root of 25 (that Noted Unfortunate
Number) so much found in the Papacy: Or, whether because the Beast was
Installed under Ph^^as in 6^6, which (says some) was the 666th Year from the
Beginning of the Roman Empire. Now this 666 made up of Six's, and of 3's (or 3

of his first Beginning with his Father will be Jeroboam's 15th and not his 4th
as I here make it. And how to Answer this, I confess, I know not; unless by a
double beginning of Jeroboam, one with his Father about 12 years, and so his
27th and 15th may be the same. Or unless, we may conceive that Amaziah might
live 11 years longer then the 15 mentioned, 2 Kings 14. 17. that being capable
(I humbly judge) of being understood with reference to the time of his being
King, (or living as King) somewhat like hereunto see in 2 Chronicles. 16. 1. and 22.
2. in which last the 42 years of Ahaziah's Age was meant of the Kingdom (of his
Fathers, the House of Omri) compared with 2 Kings 8. 26. And so after this 11
years of Azariah with his Fathers 29 he might continue after the same manner,
(or under Protectors) whilst his Father lived, (or if then Dead, because of his
Minority, till he was solemnly Crowned or Confirmed about 11 or 12 years after
in the 27th of Jeroboam, and so be said to Reign then; see 2 Kings 14. 21. It
is not said as of some others that when the Father Dyed the Son Reigned in his
stead. But all the People took Azariah and ma^e him King, etc.

The Reader may note, After I had drawn out this Scheme of 390 years, from the
27th of Solomon to Jehojachins Captivity; I saw Mr. T. A's Chronology, who
makes it (Litera^^^ 431,) but 420 years Complete from Solomon's Temple Begun,
to its Destruction in Zedekiah's Captivity (where he Begins the 70 years, with
a Mistake, I judge) now he begins those 390 years from the 4th of Solomon, I
with his 27th, he carries them to the End of Zedekiah; I to Jehojachins* Now
between the 4th of Solomon and his 27th is 23; and between Jehajachins and
Zedekiah's last is 11, both make 34, which, makes with the 390th, 424, which
are but 4 years difference from his 420 Complete, and 4 we differ in Jehoram's
Reign, (King of Judah) he Allows him but 4 (alone) instead of which I have
Allowed 8, and submit that, and the Whole, to Examination. But if
notwithstanding what I have offered the 390 days, or years, be thought more
properly Referrable to the Final Captivity, at the Destruction of City and
Temple, 11 years After; I cannot (at present) see any way how that can be done,
but by Allowing Azariah 52 years besides the 29 of his Fathers, or an
Interregnum of 11 years (in Effect the same thing) which also will necessitate
a like Interregnum in Israel; which I see no ground for; the time of the Kings
in both Kingdoms so much Harmonizing in this Account I have given; Both of the
Particular Beginnings of each Line of Kings, one with the other; and of the
Total Sum of years of each Kingdoms Continuance, Adjusted one with the other,
to their respective Periods. And so I shall with that Supplication end. O send
out thy Light and thy Truth, Psalm. 43. 3. both in this, and other more
Important Matters.

FINIS.
