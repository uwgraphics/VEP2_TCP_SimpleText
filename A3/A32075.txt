BY THE KING.
A Proclamation prohibiting the assessing collecting or paying any Weekly
Taxes* and Seizing or Sequestring the Rents or Estates of Our good Subjects, by
color of any Orders or pretended Ordinances of one or both Houses of
Parliament.
WHEREAS diverse Orders or pretended Ordinances have been contrived in the name
of one or both Houses of Parliament for taxing Our Subjects and leavying Monyes
to support the Rebellion; All which and all other ways of imposing upon Our
People to whatsoever intent or purpose, without Our Royal assent are clearly
unlawful, and unwarrantable, and so by several Proclamations and otherwise
have been declared by Us, And We do hereby declare the same unto all Our good
Subjects; and in particular by Our Proclamation of the eight of March last, We
did forbid (amongst other things) the Assessing. Collecting, and paying the
weekly Tax imposed upon Our good Subjects, and their Estates by one of the
said pretended Orders or Ordinances (which in three Months exceeds the Svmme
of the great Subsidy of 400000 l.) And nevertheless We are given to
understand the same is forceably levied, and by Color thereof diverse of Our
good Subjects imprisoned, and destrained, and great Violence, Spoil, Rapine
And Plundering committed upon them, and their Estates in diverse Counties and
places of this Our Kingdom; And that by another pretended Ordinance, the whole
Estates real and personal of diverse of Our Subjects most of them not named,
but described, and distinguished by marks of Loyalty, are ordained to be Seized
and Sequestered for maintaining a War against Us, and their Tenants discharged
of their Rents, and protected against forfeitures penalties, and damage with
other clauses importing power to dissolve Contracts, and make and mar Laws
at Pleasure, which We are informed is also endeavored to be executed; And all
which (whatsoever is pretended) do tend apparently to the Destruction of Us and
Our Posterity, (whose lives have been attempted to be taken away) the
subversion of the Established Protestant Religion the Laws of the Land and the
Liberties and Propertyes of Our Subjects, and the utter Ruin of Our whole
Kingdoms. We do therefore strictly charge and Command all Our loving Subjects
whatsoever not to submit to the said pretended Orders and Ordinances, or any of
them, or to the weekly Taxes imposed as aforesaid, or to any such seisures or
Sequestratious as aforesaid nor to presume to be assistant thereunto, by
Assessing, Taxing, Levying by distress, or otherwise or Collecting any such
weekly Taxes or making any such Seisures or Sequestrations, or by information
or procureing books of Account, or Rentalls or by any other ways or means
giving any intelligence of any such Estates real or personal, or values
thereof, But to their utmost power to resist all such Acts of injustice and
Violence. And We do hereby command the Tenants and Debtors of all Our Subjects,
whose Estates are intended to be seized and sequestered to pay their Rents and
Debts to their Landlords and Creditors, notwithstanding such seizure or
sequestration. And We do farther prohibit all person, as well Aliens as
Denizens that they presume not to intermedle in the buying, receaving disposing
the Goods or Cattle of any of Our Subjects, that shall be seized, sequestered,
distrained, or taken from them by pretense of the said Orders, or Ordinances
for such weekly Taxes, or such seisures or sequestrations as aforesaid, or
otherwise plundered. All which does tend to the aid, and assistance of a War
against Us, which by the known Laws of the Land are Acts of high Treason; And
We do declare, and publish* That to adhere to Our enemies giving them aid and
Comfort, is high Treason nominally declared by the Statute of the 25. of Edward
the 3d^ and that We intend to give Order for seizing the Estates of such as
shall Rebelliously disobey Us herein, to the intent they may remain in safe
Custody, until the Offenders can be brought to Legal trial, which shall
speedily proceed as they shall be apprehended, and delivered into the hands of
Justice; And We do hereby will and Command, the Tenants and Debtors of those,
who shall execute, or be a assisting unto, or shall voluntarily submit unto the
said Orders or Ordinances for the said weekly Taxes, or such seizures, or
sequestrations as aforesaid, that they not only forbear to pay their Rents, or
Debts, but detain the same toward the maintenance of the Peace of the
Counties, and Reparation of such as have suffered by the violence of the Army
in Rebellion against Us: Such course being already taken against such as have
according to their Allegiance assisted Us; and as We have declared, That
whosoever should loose his life in this Our defense, the Wardship of his Heir
should be granted by Us, without Rent or Fine so on the other side, we do
publish and declare, That whosoever shall excecute or be assisting to, or
voluntarily shall submit unto the said orders, or Ordinances shall receive no
benefit by Our Instructions of Grace, But We will be fully answered to the
utmost which shall be due to Us by Law, and dispose of such Wardships as shall
seem best to Us, Willing and commanding all Sheriffs, Majors, Bailiffes,
Justices of Peace Constables, and other Our Officers, and loveing Subjects
whatsoever, upon their Allegiance, and the severest pa^nes that by the Law may
be inflicted upon them, not only to obey and observe carefully these Our
Commands, but to be aiding and assisting to the utmost of their power, to all
such persons as shall require their Assistance or protection in this behalf
and to resist and repel by force of A^mes, all such as shall oppose this Our
Legal Command. And Our Will and Command is, That this Our Proclamation be read
in all Church^^ and Chappells in this Our Kingdom.

Given at Our Court at OXFORD, the seventh day of April, in the nineteenth
Year of Our Reign. God Save the KING.
