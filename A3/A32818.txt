BEING A Practical Discourse on S. MATT. vii. 12.

By Benjamin Camfield Rector of Whitwel in Derbyshire.

London, Printed by A.C. for H. Eversden under the Crown Tavern in
West-Smithfield. 1671.

TO THE READER.
Christian Reader,
I Have often thought of the Divine Wisdom and Goodness, in making the most
necessary things plain and easy to us, and the things that are plain and easy
most necessary. The ensuing Treatise is a pregnant Instance of both, presenting
to thy view the most common and acknowledged Rule of Righteousness, which yet I
fear is more customarily worded up and down the Christian World, than duly
weighed and considered of. I am sure the practice of it, according to its just
extent, would prove an happy Instrument of the best and purest Reformation that
ever yet the World was acquainted with, and one of the likeliest Expedients I
can think upon for the healing of the sad Breaches and Divisions now among us.
Did we all walk according to this Rule, wherein we profess to be agreed, we
should sooner come to agree in those things wherein we as yet differ. I will
not here detain thee longer, than till I have conjured thee to read with heed
and conscience the following Pages; and then I doubt not but thou will meet
with somewhat to satisfy thee, that neither my Labor, nor thy own, has been
spent in vain: This Conclusion undoubtedly thou will make to thy self, That
nothing can be more lovely and reasonable than the Christian Religion, which
prescribes such a Rule as this; and nothing therefore more inexcusable than the
Lives and Practices of those Professors who conform not to it. And when once
thou have made this fruitful Inference within thy own thoughts, I am content to
leave thee unto those Convictions, to persuade a Conversation answerable, or to
the severe and unavoidable checks and reproofs of thy own Mind, if thou do
otherwise. It was the saying of Protagoras, and repeated again by Plato, That
Man is the measure of all things. Thus in his Body he is the Measure of other
Measures, the Inch, the Yard, the Ell, the Pace, the Furlong, the Mile, being
all measured at first from his Digit, Hand, Foot, Cubit, etc. But it holds no
less as to his Soul likewise, in reference unto Morality: God has made him the
measure of his own Actions toward others, and referred him to himself, as the
Standard of his Duty.

The Method of the Book it self will be sufficient direction to thee in the
reading of it to the best advantage; viz. First, That thou understand this Rule
aright. Secondly, That thou meditate well on the Equity of it. Thirdly, That
thou apply it distinctly to the several Acts of thy Life. And that it may
prevail the more effectually, Lastly, Enforce it carefully upon thy self by our
Blessed Savior's Argument annexed to it. Upon each of these Heads I have
discoursed with faithfulness and plainness, and now recommend the success of my
Endeavors, and thy Perusal, to his Blessing who alone gives the Increase.

Thine in our Common Savior, B. C.

THE Comprehensive Rule OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, Do as you would be done by.
S. MAT. VII. 12. Therefore all things, whatsoever ye would that men should do
unto you, do ye even so to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets.


SECT. I.
THe Words are part of those excellent Discourses which dropped from our
Blessed Lord and Savior, in his Sermon upon the Mount; where in imitation of
Moses, as a Prophet like unto him, he delivered with authority such wholesome
Laws as were to oblige the Christian World, and rescued the Morality of those
before delivered from all the corrupt Interpretations and Glosses of the
Scribes and Pharisees; in all which most certainly he spoke, as never man spoke.

Super Matthew. Hom. 18.
In this Verse, as S. Chrysostom notes, Praeceptorum suorum fecit grande
compendium, He drew up all his Precepts into a remarkable summary; and
therefore he subjoyns, For this is the Law and the Prophets: i. e. in that
learned Fathers Paraphrase, Quaecunque lex and prophetae sparsim in omnibus
praeceperunt scripturis in hoc compendioso continentur praecepto, quasi
innumerabiles arborum rami in una radice, ibid.
Whatsoever things the Law and Prophets have commanded here and there in all
the Scriptures, are virtually contained in this compendious Precept, as the
innumerable Branches of Trees in one Root.

But, before we can consider the words entirely in themselves, it must be
noted, that the Illative Particle in the beginning [therefore] puts us in mind
of their dependence, making them plainly an Inference from somewhat that went
before. For I am not of their mind, who think it most probable, illucionis
particulam esse supervacuam, Vide Eccles. Expos.
that this word of inference is here redundant, superfluous, in vain, and to no
purpose. The only question to me is, what particularly we should refer it to.

(1.) Some, I find, look back as far as the Precepts of Charity and Mercy
delivered Chap. 5. forbidding of Revenge, commanding all the expressions of
Love, and that even to our Enemies, from ver. 39. to the end. To countenance
this, they tell us, that S. Matthew seems not so punctual an observer of
Method, as S. Luke may be thought to be, who undertakes in his Preface to
Theophilus, Having understood all things from the beginning (...) exactly, S.
Luke 1.3.
(...) to write in order, distinct and distribative, as those who write an
History with judgment. So Beza. The word may be rendered, consequentially, serie
perpetua, in continued rank, as one thing follows another. Yet the Learned
Grotius thinks it no more than sigillatim, in particulars, and one by one;
observing that S. Luke, as well as the other Evangelists, has more than once
ob rerum cohaerentiam, for the affinity and coherence of things, and their near
relation to each other, knit and conjoined together such matters, as were
temporibus discreta, differenced in the times of speaking of them. Not to
engage my self in a decision of this critical difference, most certain it is,
that S. Luke gives us this comprehensive Precept of the Text among those of
Christian Charity, which S. Matthew relates Chap. 5. placing it in the middle
between them. S. Luke 6.27.
He had said before, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, 30, 31,
32, 33.
etc. give to every man that asks of thee, ( i. e. without respect of his
quality, be he friend or foe, so he be a subject needful of thy charity) and
from him that takes away thy goods ask them not again: It should be rendered,
and from him that takes thy goods exact not, i. e. exercise not a pinching
Usury upon such as take thy Goods on Loan, (Charity and Liberality consisting
especially in these two things, giving and lending freely.) Then it follows,
And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
Whereupon he proceeds further in the same subject: For if ye love them which
love you, what thank have you? Quam mercedem habebitis? quasi dicat nullam;
neque enim istud facere virtus est, sed non facere scelus est: neutri debetur
quicquam, ubi par relatum est pari. Erasm. Enchir. mil. Christiani. p. 149.
i. e. what reward can ye expect? for sinners also love those who love them.
And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners
also do even the same. And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, (or
borrow) what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much
again, or that they may borrow as much again; i. e. that they may at another
time borrow as great a sum. But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend,
hoping for nothing again (or distrusting nothing) and your reward shall be
great, and ye shall be the Children of the Highest, for he is kind to the
unthankful and to the evil, etc.

Now it is very useful for us to observe here, that this Rule, [As ye would men
should do unto you, likewise do ye also unto them] enforces upon us true
Christian Charity, and that to our very enemies, the Rule being not [What
others do to you,] but [What ye would others should do to you;] of which more
Sect. 3. Sect. 12.
afterward: And upon this account it is not unfitly ranked among these
Precepts.

Nevertheless it may well be questioned, whether S. Luke's relation respects
the same time with that of S. Matthew: (1.) Because we find him not so
precisely mentioning our Blessed Saviors Sermon in the Mount; and (2.) Because
the words of this Precept are somewhat varied, and the later Clause, as well as
the Particle of Inference, omitted. It may therefore be conjectured, that these
two Evangelists have not respect to what was delivered at one and the same
time, it being very likely, that as our Blessed Savior did more than once
inculcate the Precepts of Christian Charity upon his Disciples, so he might in
like manner more than once deliver the sum of them in this Golden and
Comprehensive Rule. Nor is it at all probable, that S. Matthew's Inference in
this seventh Chapter should extend as far back as to the later end of the fifth
Chapter, the other Chapter that comes between treating of other Subjects: And
therefore,

(2.) I shall rather choose to refer it to what is comprised in the foregoing
Verses of this seventh Chapter.

Two things there are especially, which our Blessed Savior instructs them
about.

(1.) He cautions them against rash censures of others. Judge not, Chapter 7.1, 2,
3.
that you be not judged; for with what Judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged;
and with what Measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why
beholdest thou the mote that is in thy Brothers eye, but considerest not the
beam that is in thine own eye? etc. Whereto it may seem a conclusion not
altogether impertinent, Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men
should do unto you, do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the
Prophets. He before calls off their thoughts from others to themselves; and in
this conclusion he warns them to afford the same measure to others wherewith
they serve themselves: q. d. None of you are willing to be censured and judged
rashly of by other men; what therefore you would not have others do to you, do
not ye offer unto them; and so judge them not without cause, censure them not
unadvisedly. This I conceive to be good sense; but cannot say, it is properly
meant and intended by our Blessed Savior, or his Evangelist, in this
Inference. For,

(2.) Between that and the Text there follows another Discourse, wherein our
Blessed Savior urges his Disciples to the great Duty of Prayer, and confirms
their hopes of receiving from God what they pray for, if not always in kind, at
least always for their good, from the 7 verse to this 12. Ask, says he, and it
shall be given you; Ver. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one
that asks, receives; and he that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks,
it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if his Son ask Bread,
will he give him a Stone? or if he ask a Fish, will he give him a Serpent? If
ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to your Children, how much more
shall your Father which is in Heaven give good things to them that ask him? --
And now immediately upon this it is added, Therefore all things, etc.

With this coherence then it may be considered by us, as a necessary Condition
to be carefully heeded and observed by us, that our Prayers to God may be
effectual: As if he had said more at large, You may be sure of speeding with
God in your Prayers, if you be not your own hindrances: There will be no defect
in his goodness, which is far beyond that of any earthly Parent to his
Children. The only obstacle will prove in your selves, viz. if you are not
rightly disposed to receive good things from him; and therefore, that you may
be thus rightly qualified for speeding with God, all things whatsoever ye would
that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them; for this is the Law and
the Prophets. Or, as some read it by an Hebraism, (of which Sect. 4.
hereafter) Whatsoever ye would to be done unto you, (even by God himself, as
well as men) be ye prepared according to your power to do unto others. Non
solummodo nolite judicare, sed and omnia quaecunque vultis -- and tunc
impetrabiliter poteritis orare. Super Matt. Hom. 18.
-- Not only, judge not others rashly; but also whatsoever ye would, etc. and
then you may be sure to ask and have, to pray and obtain. So S. Chrysostom. That
they might pray successfully, Christ puts them upon pious endeavors; for these
two must go together, as Hierocles well admonishes: (...). Hierocles.
What we work and endeavor, we should also pray for; and what we pray for, we
should also work and endeavor that it may speed. Our Lord would demonstrate,
Vide Citat, in Catena D. Thornae.
says S. Chrysostom, that men ought both superius inquirere auxilium, to seek
help from above; and quae a seipsis sunt simul infer, and to contribute in
like manner what they can themselves: and therefore after that he had said,
Ask, seek, knock, he plainly teaches men themselves to be studious and
diligent, and therefore subjoyns, All things whatsoever -- And again, says he,
Non simpliciter dicit omnia, sed addidit ergo: He says not barely, All things
whatsoever; but he adds a Therefore to it: q. d. Si vultis audiri, cum illis
quae dixi and haec facite; If you would be heard of God, mind this with the
rest that I have spoken of, All things whatsoever --

A good Disposition and Life must accompany our Prayers, to render them
acceptable and successful. The Sacrifice of the wicked, Prove. 15.8.
says the Wise man, is an abomination to the Lord; but the Prayer of the
upright is his delight: and, Chap. 28.9.
"He that turns away his ear from hearing the Law, his Prayer shall be
abomination. Impeditur orationis effectus per impiam conversationem; The effect
and success of Prayer is hindered by a wicked life and conversation. S. Jam.
5.16.
The effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous man, says S. James, avails
much. It must not only be fervent and importunate, (such as is intimated by our
Saviors Phrases of asking, seeking, and knocking) but it must be also of a
righteous man, that it may avail much. Isa. 1.15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
When ye spread forth your hands, says God unto the wicked, I will hide mine
eyes from you; yea, when ye make many Prayers, I will not hear: your hands are
full of blood. And therefore that such may pray successfully, the direction is,
Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine
eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed,
judge the fatherless, plead for the widow: Come now, and let us reason
together, says the Lord. -- Particularly, there must be a disposition of
goodness and charity toward others, that we may our selves obtain good things
from God. Prove. 21.13.
Whosoever stops his ears, says Solomon, at the cry of the poor, he also shall
cry himself, but shall not be heard. To this sense S. Augustine enlarges upon
the Text. God, Vide Citat. in Caten. D. Tho.
says he, had promised that he would give good things to them that ask: But
that he may own us his Beggars, let us in like manner look upon ours; and that
we may know what we ought to bestow on our Neighbor asking of us, (begging
Alms of us) to the intent that we in like manner may be heard in what we crave
of God, we may consider from this, what we would that others in a like case
should bestow upon us, and ideo dixit, omnia ergo -- And for this cause our
Blessed Savior said, Therefore all things --

One thing more I find suggested by the ordinary Gloss upon that of the
precedent Verse: How much more will your Heavenly Father give good things to
them that ask. For which S. Luke reads, S. Luke 11.13.
"The Holy Spirit. Whereupon, says the Gloss, Omnium bonorum spiritualium
distributor est Spiritus Sanctus, ut opera charitatis impleantur: unde subdit,
Omnia ergo quaecunque -- The Holy Ghost is the distributer of all spiritual
goods, to the end that the works of Charity may be fulfilled; and thence he
subjoyns, All things therefore whatsoever --

The Holy Spirit given by God is within us a Principle of Goodness, a Principle
of Good Works: Wherefore, since God is so ready to bestow on us his Holy
Spirit, and therewith all spiritual Goods, upon our Prayers unto him, we should
for that very reason show forth the fruits of that good Spirit in all goodness
our selves, in such good Works as are the result of this General Rule here
prescribed, "Therefore all things --

Therefore, viz. that you may not pray without success, that you may show your
selves rightly disposed and qualified for prevailing with God in your Prayers,
and that you may bring forth fruit becoming of that great gift of the Holy
Ghost obtained of God by Prayer. --

But so much shall suffice to have spoken of that Illative Particle, and the
dependent Sense of the Words on the account thereof.

SECT. II.
WE will now look upon them as absolute and complete in themselves, as an
entire Map of Christian Duty, without that Fragment of bordering Virtues
decyphered in the word of Inference, Therefore. And, setting aside that
Particle, we have considerable in the words,

(1.) A General and Comprehensive Rule of Life; All things whatsoever ye would
that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them. And,

(2.) The enforcement of this Rule or Precept; For this is the Law and the
Prophets.

Of both which I shall treat by Gods help in their order.

I begin with the General and Comprehensive Rule of Life, as it is here laid
down.

Wherein we may observe more distinctly,

(1.) Regulatum or Regulandum; the Actions ruled or to be ruled hereby, viz.
our own Actions, and our own Actions toward other men, i. e. our Neighbors:
[Do ye even so to them.]

(2.) Regulam, the Rule it self; and that is, [All things whatsoever ye would
that men should do unto you, -- ]

Concerning the former I have only two or three things briefly to suggest.

(1.) We are prone enough to prescribe to other men, to oversee, and order, and
appoint their Actions: We are generally willing enough they should act by Rule
toward us: But our Blessed Savior here calls his Disciples thoughts home to
themselves, and gives them every one the special charge of directing and
managing their own Actions aright: Quae dicis aliis, dic tibi ipsi, ut audias.
We are principally concerned to regulate our own Actions: We are every one to
amend our own ways, to sweep before our own doors, as we are wont to speak. And,

(2.) The Actions here ruled are such as concern our Neighbor, such as have
respect and reference to our Neighbor, i.e. to all other men with whom we live
and converse; for so we are taught in Holy Writ to reckon every man our
Neighbor. S. Paul significantly puts (...) for (...). Romans 13.5.
He that loves another has fulfilled the Law of loving his Neighbor. In our
Actions toward one another we are not left without Law and Rule; we may not do
as we list, as it seems good in our own eyes. Nay,

(3.) Together with our outward Actions, our Will it self is to be ordered by
the Rule here prescribed; for it must be always remembered, that the Laws of
Christ are spiritual, and reach also to the inward man. -- Scelus intra se
tacitus qui cogitat ullum, facti crimen habet. -- To will, covet, resolve, and
intend, is, in the account of our supreme Lawmakers and Judge, to do. The
Thoughts, Desires, and Affections of our Souls ( i. e. our inner man) are
reputed and censured by him as our Actions: So that, what we may not do, we may
not will to do, we may not design or resolve to do, we may not approve or allow
of, we may not joy or delight in. -- But I proceed now to the later and
principal Point, the Rule it self whereby we are to square both our Choice and
Practice: All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so
do ye unto them. (...), even so in all things, as ye would that men should do
unto you; or, as S. Luke has it, (...), likewise, in like manner do ye unto
them. -- This Positive plainly includes in it a severe Prohibition of doing
that to others, which we would not they should do unto us. So pious Tobit
instructed his Son; Tobit 4.15. Quod ab alio oderis fieri tibi, vide ne tu
aliquando alteri facias.
(...), Do that to no man which thou hate. See that thou do not that to
another, which thou art unwilling another should do unto thee. Admit not of
that in thy self, Quod damnaturus sis in aliis, in te ne admiseris.
which thou condemnest and reprovest in another. This Prohibition, I say, is
included in our Blessed Savior's Precept. Abstinentiam mali ponit per
operationem boni, Hom. 13. ad Pop, Antioch.
says S. Chrysostom. He expresses the Negative by the Affirmative; the
abstinence from Evil, by the doing of Good. So do ye, -- so, and not otherwise,
-- so, and not the contrary. Fac quod vis pati, as S. Augustine abbreviates it:
Do as thou would suffer; i. e. as thou would be done by or to. Quod vis
tibi fieri, fac alteri: Whereto the Negative should ever-more be added for
illustration sake, Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris: Do not to
another what thou would not have done unto thy self.

A double saying there is of the Son of Sirach, pertinent to be here remembered.
The one Ecclus 31.15. Judge of thy neighbor by thy self: The other chapter 4.31.
Let not thine hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou should
give.

Aelius Lampr. in Alex. Sever.
It Is, recorded of the good Emperor Alexander Severus, though no Christian, that
when he saw any of his Soldiers trespassing and committing spoil in the Fields
of others, he would take them up smartly, to this purpose; Visne hoc in agro
tuo fieri, quod alteri facis? Would thou have this done in thine own Field,
which thou have done to another? Proclaiming that he had often heard of the
Christians, and commanding it to be published by the voice of a Crier, when he
corrected or punished any, Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris; Do not
that to another, which thou would not have done to thy self. A Sentence
which he is said to have been so much in love withal, that he caused it to be
written in his own Chamber, and over the Seats of Judicature, as most worthy to
be continually studied by himself, and read by others.

It were certainly to be wished that it were written on the Tables of all our
Hearts, or rather revived as much in our frequent thoughts, memories,
affections, and practice, as it is clearly written and engraven naturally on
the Tables of our Hearts. For, to say the truth of it, this Precept of our
Blessed Savior is no more than a plain Law of Nature, obliterated by evil
habits and custom, revived and brought to light again by Christ. A Law of
Nature, I say, it is undoubtedly, whereof we may find clear footsteps among
the Heathens, and which takes hold immediately on the conscience of every one
that duly considers of it. I will give you some Instances to this purpose out
of the Gentile-writings.

Diogenes Laertius tells us in the Life of Aristotle, that he, being asked,
Diog. Laert. in Vita Aristot.
(...); How we should demean our selves toward our Friends? made answer,
(...), As we would desire and wish them to demean themselves toward us. And a
like Resolution thereunto I find given by Simplicius upon Epictetus, That we
then do right, if we so use our Friends, (...). Simplic. in cap. 37. Epictet.
as we are willing they should use us.

The Athenian Isocrates, that most excellent and ancient Rhetorician and
Philosopher frequently glanceth upon this Rule. Among his Admonitions to young
men, in that worthy Oration of his (...), he gives this for one: Manage thy
anger toward those that offend, (...). -- (...). Isoc ad Dem^n.
in like manner as thou would judge becoming in others toward thy self
offending. And again, Be thou such toward thy Parents, as thou would wish
thy Children should be toward thee. And again, Hereby will thou very much
inhance thy Reputation, if it shall appear that thou do not those things thy
self, which thou would reprehend in others doing of the same.

And in his Royal Guide, his Writing I mean to King Nicocles: (...). Ad Nicocl.
So carry thy self, says he, in thy familiar converse toward thy Inferiors,
as thou would judge fitting and worthy in thy betters toward thy self. And
elsewhere, (...). Id.
says he, Do not ye those things to others, which ye are angry when you suffer
or receive from others.

Homer in his 23 Iliad brings in Achilles thus taking up of Ajax and the King
of the Cretians, who fell to evil and harsh words each against the other,
forbidding them to use such uncivil and reproachful Language, by this Argument,
-- (...), Hom. Iliad. ^.

(...).
Because, says he, it is no ways becoming; for you your selves would reprehend
and blame another, whosoever he be, that should do the like.

Stobaeus quotes this memorable Passage from Hierocles, which indeed is a rare
Paraphrase on our Blessed Savior's Rule; Sic cum unoquoque agas, Stob. Sermon.
84.
tanquam tu illius, ille tuam personam induerit: So deal with every one, as if
your Persons were exchanged, he in your place, you in his.

It Is the determination of the Venusian Poet, -- aequum est
Peccatis veniam poscentem reddere rursus. Horat. l. 1. sat. 3.

It is but equal, that he who craves pardon at another hand, should himself be
ready to give the like to another.

Seneca in his grave Books De Ira hat^ many Passages looking this way. The
chief that I have observed are these tha^ follow.

Non est prudentis errantes odisse: alioquin ipse sibi odio erit. Cogitet quam
multa contra bonum morem faciat, quam multa ex his quae egit veniam desiderent.
Jam irascetur etiam sibi. Neque enim aequus judex aliam de sua aliam de aliena
causa sententiam fert. Nemo, inquam, invenitur qui se possit absolvere, and
innocentem quisque se dicit respiciens testem non conscientiam. Quanto humanius
mitem ac patrium animum praestare peccantibus and illos non persequi sed
revocare Sen. de Ira, l. 1. c. 14.
It is not the part of a prudent man says he, to hate those that do err an^ do
amiss: Otherwise he must be hatefu^ to himself. For, let him think how many
things he has committed again^ good manners; how many of thos^ things he has
done himself need pardon. Now then he must be angry als^ with himself; for, no
equal Judge pronounces one Sentence in his own Cause and a contrary in another
Man's. None I say, is to be found that can altogethe^ absolve himself; and
whoever pronounces himself innocent, speaks more wit^ respect to other
Witnesses, than his ow^ Conscience. How much more human^ is it therefore to
show a meek and fatherly mind toward those that offend and not to persecute,
but to recal^ them? -- Thus in his first Book And he brings to my mind that of
the Apostle, Gal. 6.1. Brethren, if a Man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
spiritual restore such a one with the spirit of meekness, considering thy self,
lest thou also be tempted. To the same effect also he discourses much in his
second Book. -- If we would, says he, Si volumus aequi omnium rerum judices
esse, hoc primum nobis suadeamus, neminem nostrum esse sine culpa: hinc enim
maxima indignatfo oritur. Nihil peccavi, nihil feci. imo nihil fateris.
Indignamur aliqua admonitione aut coercitione nos castigatos; cum illo ipso
tempore peccemus quo adjicimus malefactis arrogantiam and contumaciam. Quis est
ille qui se profitetur omnibus legibus innocentem? Ut hoc ita sit quam angusta
innocentia est ad Legem bonum esse? Quanto latius officiorum patet quam juris
regula? Quam multa pietas, humanitas, liberalitas, justitia, fides exigunt quae
omnia extra publicas tabulas sunt? Sed ne ad illam quidam arctissimam
innocentiae formulam praestare nos possumus: alia fecimus, alia cogitavimus:
alia optavimus, aliis favimus: in qui busdam innocents sumus, quia non
successit. Hoc cogitantes aequiores simus delinquentibus, cedamus
objurgantibus, utique nobis ne irascamur -- Dicetur aliquis male de te locutus.
Cogita an prior feceris, cogita de quam multis loquaris. Cogitemus, inquam,
alios non facere injuriam sed reponere: alios pronos facere, alios coactos
facere, alios ignorantes: etiam eos qui volentes scientesque faciunt ex injuria
nostra non ipsam injuriam petere. Aut dulcedine urbanitatis prolapsus est, aut
fecit aliquid non ut nobis obesset, sed quia consequi ipse non poterat, nisi
nos repulisset. Saepe adulatio dum blanditur offendit. Quisquis ad se
retulerit, quotiens ipse in suspicionem falsam inciderit, quam multis officiis
suis fortuna speciem injuriae induerit, quam multos post odium amare caeperit,
poterit non statim irasci, utique si sibi tacitus ad singula, quibus
offenditur, dixerit: Haec and ipse commisi. Sed ubi tam aequum judicem
invenies? Is qui nullius non uxorem concupiscit, and satis justam causam putat
amandi, quod aliena est, idem uxorem suam aspici non vult: and fidei acerrimus
exactor, est perfidus: and mendacia persequitur ipse perjurus: and litem sibi
inferri aegerrime calumniator patitur. Pudicitiam suorum servulorum attentari
non vult, qui non pepercit suae. Aliena vitia in oculis habemus: a tergo nostra
sunt. Inde est quod tempestiva filii convivia pater deterior filio castigat.
Nihil alienae luxuriae ignoscit, qui nihil suae negarit: and homicidae tyrannus
irascitur: and punit furta sacrilegus. Magna pars hominum est quae non peccatis
irascitur sed peccantibus. Faciet nos moderatiores respectus nostri, si
consuluerimus nos; Nunquid and ipsi aliquid tale commisimus? nunquid sic
erravimus? expeditne nobis ista damnari? L. 2. de Ira. c. 27. and 28.
become Equal Judges of all things, let us persuade our selves this in the
first place, that there is none of us without fault. For hence arises our
greatest indignation. Thou say, I have sinned in nothing, I have done nothing
amiss: nay, Thou confessest nothing. We are angry that we are chastised with
any admonition or restraint, when at that very time we sin by adding arrogance
and contumacy to our evil deeds. Who is he that can profess himself innocent as
to all Laws? Or though it be so, how narrow an innocence is it to be good as
far as the Law of Man reaches? How much wider is the rule of our Duties, than
that of the Law? How many things do Piety, Humanity, Liberality, Justice,
Fidelity require, which are not in the public Tables? But yet we cannot so
much as clear our selves according to that most narrow form of innocence: We
have done otherwise, we have thought otherwise, we have desired otherwise, we
have favored otherwise, (or, as his words may possibly be rendered, We have
done one thing and thought another, we have desired one thing and favored
another:) in some things we are innocent for want of success. While we think on
This, let us be more equal to those that offend; let us yield to those that
chide and reprove us; to wit, that we may not be angry with our selves. -- It
will be said, some one has spoken evil of thee, defamed thee. Think with thy
self whether thou have not done the like before; think of how many thou art
wont to speak. Let us think, I say, that some do not do an injury so much as
return it; that some do it willingly, others constrainedly, others ignorantly:
or that even those who do it wittingly, may not aim at the injury it self in
our injury: He either failed out of excess of Courtship, or did somewhat not to
hurt us, but because he could not speed himself unless he had repelled us.
Oftentimes Adulation, whilst it flatters, offends. Whosoever shall consider
with himself and recall to his mind, how often himself has fallen into a false
suspicion, how many of his well-meant services Fortune has clothed with the
appearance of injury, how many he has begun to love after his hatred, he will
be able to refrain his anger; to wit, if he shall thus silently discourse to
himself, as to the particulars wherewith he is offended; Even I my self also
have committed the like. But where will thou find so equal and impartial a
Judge? He that covets every man's wife, and thinks it ground enough to love her
because she is another, the same man yet will not suffer his own wife to be
looked upon. He is a most severe exacter of faithfulness in others, who is
himself perfidious. He punishes other men's lies, who is himself guilty of
Perjury, etc. We have other men's vices before our eyes, whilst our own are
behind our back. Thence it is that the Father, who is himself worse than his
Son, does yet chastize the Son's seasonable Banquets. He will give no pardon to
another Luxury,, who denies none to his own. The Tyrant is angry at the
Murderer; and he that is himself sacrilegious, punishes Thefts in others. A
great part of Men there is, who are not angry so much at the Sins as the
Sinners. Now a respect to our own selves will make us more moderate to others;
if we shall debate the Case with our selves to this purpose, Have not we also
our selves sometimes committed a like offense? Have not we so erred? Is it
expedient for our selves that these things should be condemned and punished in
others? -- His discourse all along turns upon this hinge, That we ought not to
afford that measure to others, which we our selves will not admit of.

He speaks yet more expressly in the third Book: Let us, says he, Eo loco nos
constituamus, quo ille est cui irascimur: nunc facit iracundos iniqua nostri
aestimatio: and quae facere vellemus pati nolumus. Lib. 3. c. 12. Omnes
inconsulti and improvidi sumus, omnes incerti, queruli, ambitiosi. Quid
lenioribus hulcus publicum abscondo? Omnes mali sumus. Quicquid itaque in alio
reprehenditur, id unusquisque in suo sinu inveniet. Quid illius pallorem,
illius maciem notas? Pestilentia est. Placidiores itaque invicem simu Mali
inter malos vivimus. cap. 26.
suppose our selves in his place and stead, whom we are angry at: Whereas now
an unequal esteem of our selves makes us wrathful against others; and those
things which we would do, we will not suffer. And to the same purpose he adds
afterward, We are all heady and improvident, all fickle, querulous, ambitious.
Why do I hide a Public Sore with too gentle Words? We are all bad. Whatsoever
therefore is reprehended in another, that may every one find in his own bosom.
Why do thou set a mark on this man's paleness, and the others leanness? It Is a
common Plague. Let us therefore be more favorable one to another upon this
account. We are bad our selves, living among bad Neighbors.

Yet once more the same Seneca, in his 47 Epistle, commending Lucilius for
using of his Servants in a familiar manner, enlarges on that occasion to this
effect:

Servi sunt? imo homines. Servi sunt? imo contubernales. Servi sunt? imo
humiles amici. Servi sunt? imo conservi. Si cogitaveris tantundem in utrosque
licere fortunae. -- Vis tu cogitare istum, quem servum tuum vocas, ex iisdem
seminibus ortum, eodem frui coelo, aeque spirare, aeque vivere, aeque mori? Tam
tu illum ingenuum videre potes quam ille te servum. Mariana clade quam multos
splendidissime natos Senatorium per militiam auspicantes gradum fortuna
depressit? Alium ex illis pastorem, alium custodem casae fecit. Contemn nunc
ejus fortunae hominem, in quam transire, dum contemnis, potes. -- Haec
praecepti mei summa est, sic cum inferiore vivas, quemadmodum tecum superiorem
velles vivere. Quoties in mentem venerit, quantum tibi in servum liceat, veniat
in mentem tantundem in te Domino tuo licere. -- At Ego, inquis, nullum habeo
Dominum. Bona aetas est; forsitan habebis. Senec. Epist. 47.
Servants do we call them? yea, they are Men, Companions, humble Friends,
Fellow Servants; if we bethink our selves that we are alike exposed to the
power of Fortune. -- Do but consider that he, whom thou stylest thy Servant or
Slave, has the same Original with thy self, lives and breathes under the same
Heaven, and at last dies like thy self; and thou may change Names and Titles
with him. How many Noble Persons has the fortune of the Wars depressed, and
turned into Shepherds and Cottagers? Go now, and despise a man of that Rank and
Condition, which thou thy self may pass into, even while thou art despising
of him. The sum of my Instructions is this, That thou so live with thy
Inferior, as thou would thy Superior should live with thee; and as often as
thou shall think Vide Eccles. chap. 7. ver. 21, 22.
what power thou have over thy Servant, think also that thy Lord and Master
has the same power over thee. -- But thou replyest, it may be, I have no Lord
or Master. It Is well: but thou know not how soon thou may have one. --

The Reader may see more to this purpose, Epistle 95. where he delivers this as
the Summary of our mutual duty each to other [formula humani officii] to
consider, that we are all Members of one great Body, akin by Nature, having the
same Rise and End, and therefore obliged to mutual love and sociable demeanor,
to all equity, and innocence, and helpfulness, and to retain that Golden Saying
in our Hearts as well as Mouths, Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto: i.
e. I am a Man, and therefore neither think my self free from any accident that
befalls other men, nor desire to be excused in any duty which becomes humanity.

The Stoics indeed generally in their Writings have many things of this
nature, and determine it to be proper unto man from his heart to love other
men, and wish them well, as allied to him by Nature both in Body and Soul,
(...), etc. Vide quae Gatakerus noster in suo ad M. Antoninum praeloquio e
Stoicis congessit; and ipsum Antoninum passim.
and made for a mutual subserviency each to other.

And take this farther taste out of some others.

Pliny in the 12 Epistle of his 9 Book, Heus tu, nunquamne fecisti quod a patre
corripi possit? fecisti, dico. Non interdum facis, quod filius tuus, si repent
pater ille, Tu filius, pari gravitate reprehendat?

Cato in his excellent Precepts De Moribus, which are learnt commonly by
Children, but worthy the most serious consideration of Men, has these
remarkable Sayings that touch upon the Point in hand.

In his short Precepts this; Patere legem quam ipse tuleris; i. e. as Erasmus
Scholles upon it, Whatever Condition thou prescribest to others, use the same
thy self toward others. And in his Disticks, these.

Quae culpare soles, ea tu ne feceris ipse:
Turpe est Doctori, cum culpa redarguit ipsum L. 1. Did. 30.
i. e. By no means do the thing thou art wont to blame: It Is a disgrace to a
Teacher to reprove himself by a contrary practice.

Alterius dictum aut factum ne carpseris unquam,
Exemplo simili ne te derideat alter. L. 3. Did. 6.
i. e. Carp not at another words or doings, lest thou instruct him to deride
thy self by a like example.

Cum fueris servos proprios mercatus in usus,
Et famulos dicas, homines tamen esse memento. Did. 44.
i. e. When thou have bought Servants for thy own use, and call them thy
Slaves, yet remember that they are Men: and so (as Erasmus notes) in this equal
with thy self.

And among the Sentences of the famed Sages of Greece, I have noted these,
ascribed to Pittacus and Cleobulus.

Pareto legi, quisquis legem sanxeris: i. e. Obey the Law which thou thy self
establishest.

Quae feceris parentibus, eadem a liberis expecta: i. e. Expect the same from
thy Children, which thou do to thy Parents.

Ne geras imperium, priusquam parere didiceris. Pittacus. i. e. Rule not, till
thou have first learned to obey.

Res amici diligas and perinde serves, ut tuas: i. e. Love and preserve the
Concerns of thy Friend, as thy own. And,

Quod oderis alteri ne feceris. Cleobulus. i. e. Do not to another what thou
hate.

And then (to search out no more) inter Mimos Publii, these seven.

Ab alio expectes, alteri quod feceris: i. e. Expect from another what thou
shall do to another.

Beneficium dare qui nescit, injuste petit: i. e. He unjustly craves a
Courtesy, who knows not how to do one.

Etiam qui faciunt, odio habent injuriam: i. e. Those very Persons hate an
injury to themselves, who do it to others.

Homo qui in homine calamitoso est misericors, meminit sui: i. e. The Man who
compassionates another calamity, remembers himself.

Habet in adversis auxilia, qui in secundis commodat: i. e. He finds help in
his adversity, who affords it to another in his prosperity.

Homo semper in sese aliud fert, in alterum aliud cogitat: i. e. It Is the guise
of men to give different judgments for themselves, and for others.

Illo nocens se damnat, quo peccat, die. Publius. i. e. The injurious man is at
the same time self-condemned.

Which how they appertain to this Argument, will appear more evidently and
fully upon the perusal of the sixth Section.

Diverse other Sayings might be quoted from the Heathen Writers, by those that
have been more diligent in their observation; but from those inserted it
sufficiently appears, that this Rule of our Blessed Savior's is a clear Branch
of the Law of Nature, and among those Principles which every one reflecting on,
as he ought, may read in his own breast and conscience, if it be not strangely
corrupted and defaced by gross ignorance and stupidity, sensuality, or some
other wicked and perverse habit and custom of sinning. So that in this case
Christ might well say to his Disciples, as elsewhere he does to the Pharisees,
Yea, S. Luke 12.57.
and why even of your selves judge ye not what is right? Our Savior, as S.
Chrysostom observes, Hom. 13. ad Pop. Antioch. super ista verba, Quae cunque
volueritis --
teaches here, Nihil nostram transcendens Naturam, nothing beyond our Nature,
but what he had long before imprinted on our Conscience: Ex nobis ipsis scimus
quid facto opus sit; We know from our selves what we should do unto others.
Nemo sanus sibi non been cupit; There is no man in his right wits, but wishes
himself well: and therefore, Nemo non habet domi regulam; There is no man but
has a Domestic Chaplain preaching of his duty, a Rule within himself for his
demeanor toward others. Voluntas tua sit lex; Let thy own will, says he, be
the law of thy actions, even thy own will of receiving from others. Would
thou have courtesies done thy self? do them to another. Would thou obtain
mercy? have mercy on thy neighbor. Would thou be commended? commend
another. Would thou be loved? love thy neighbor. Would thou have the
precedence? yield it first to another. Tu sis judex: Tu sis vitae tuae
legislator: Be thou thus thy own Judge; be thou the Legislator for thy own Life
and Conversation. And again, Quod odisti, alii ne facias; Do not that to
another, which thou hate: for this later Rule will enable thee to avoid that
which is evil, as the former to do that which is good. Do thou hate
contumelious usage thy self? offer it not to another. Do thou hate to be
deceived thy self? deceive not thou another. And generally in all cases, says
he, if we retain in memory these few words, Voluntas tua sit Lex; that we make
our choice for our selves the Law of our Actions toward others, we shall need
no other discipline or instruction. -- To this effect S. Chrysostom. Loco supra
citat.


And Salvian having quoted this Precept of our Blessed Savior, Whatsoever ye
would that men should do unto you, do ye also the same to them in like manner;
proceeds thus upon it: Hujus sententiae partem tam been novimus, ut nunquam
praetereamus: partem sic praetermittimus, quasi penitus nesciamus. Nam quid ab
aliis praestari nobis velimus, optime novimus; quid autem ipsi aliis debeamus
praestare nescimus. Atque utinam nesciremus! minor esset ignorantiae reatus --
Nunc autem in hoc major offensa est, quod partem sententiae sacrae pro
commodorum nostrorum utilitate diligimus, partem pro Dei injuria praeterimus.
-- Tantum abest ut aliorum commodis aliquid cum propria incommoditate
praestemus, ut omnes vel maxim nostris commodis cum aliorum incommodo
consulamus. Salvian. lib. 3. De Prove.
-- One part of this Sentence we know so well, as never to pass it by; the
other part we so pass by, as if we were altogether ignorant: for we know very
well what we would others should do unto us; but what we our selves ought to do
unto others, we know not: And I would to God we knew not! the guilt of our
ignorance would be the less. -- But now in this our offense is the greater,
that we love part of this holy Sentence for our own profit, but omit the other
part injuriously toward God. So far are we from benefiting others with our own
loss, that we do all chiefly consult our own benefit with the damage of others.
--

Add hereunto This of the Learned Grosted Bishop of Lincoln above 400 years
since, in his Treatise De Cessatione Legalium. -- Manu formatoris nostri in
ipsis cordibus nostris veritas scripsit, Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri non
sacies. Hoc antequam lex scriberetur nemo ignorare permissus est, unde
judicarentur and quibus non est data lex. Sed, ne sibi homines aliquid defuisse
quererentur, scriptum est and tabulis quod in cordibus non legebant. Non enim
scriptum non habebant, sed legere nolebant. Oppositum est oculis eorum, quod in
conscientia videre cogerentur, and quasi forinsecus admota voce Dei ad
interiora sua homo compulsus est. -- In cogitationibus enim impii interrogatio
erit, and ubi interrogatio ibi lex. Sed quia homines appetentes ea quae foris
sunt etiam a scipsis exules facti sunt, data and conscripta lex, non quia in
cordibus scripta non erat, sed, quia tu fugitivus eras cordis tui, ab illo qui
ubique est apprehenderis, and ad teipsum intra te vocaris. Propterea scripta
est lex, quae clamat eis qui deseruerunt legem scriptam in cordibus, Redite
praevaricatores ad cor. p. 100, 101.

Hitherto in the general: Now for the more full and perspicuous handling of
this Excellent and Comprehensive Rule, I shall follow this plain method.

First, To state and explain the true and genuine meaning of it.

Secondly, To examine and search into the Grounds and Foundations of Equity
upon which it is built. And,

Thirdly, To make an Induction of those special acts of Virtue which it prompts
us to, and those Sins and Vices hereby most properly forbidden and reproved.
But,

SECT. III.
FIrst, It is requisite that we understand this Rule of ours aright, being
liable unto some mistakes, if we are not duly cautioned against them. In order
therefore to the explaining of it, and that so as the meanest Capacity may
truly comprehend it, I shall proceed,

(1.) Per remotionem, negatively, and by way of removal of those false Rules
which men are apt enough to substitute in the room of this. And,

(2.) Per positionem, to declare positively what this Rule of ours imports, and
what we are to observe in order to the right understanding of it.

By the first I shall show, what it is not; by the second, what it is.

Most men in the world observe either no Rule at all, or else some false and
crooked Rules, in their Actions toward others: And therefore it will not be
amiss here to glance at some Particulars which are too frequently put in the
room of the Prescription in the Text.

(1.) Then the Rule is not thus laid down, [All things whatsoever other men
would have you do to them, let them do even so to you.] We are willing enough
to hear of other men's duties, as I before also intimated, even whilst we most
neglect our own. We are apt enough to exact our right of other men, whilst we
refuse our selves to do what is right and just unto them. We are prone enough
to say to others, Do as you would be done by; we like it very well in the
practice of others; but the Law here runs not in that form, Quaecunque sibi
fieri voluerint -- Let others do as they would be dealt withal: but it calls
upon every one of us especially to regulate our own Actions, and to mind our
own duty. Much less is it,

(2.) [All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, let them do
unto you.] Our Wills and Pleasures are not the rule and measure of other men's
duties toward us. It does not follow that other men do us wrong and injury
nakedly because they displease and offend us, because they do unto us what we
would not have them. This indeed is more or less the corrupt humor of us all:
We are too prone and willing to make our Wills and Pleasures the Law and Rule
of other men's Actions; and every thing that offends us, that is contrary to our
humor or fancy, is censured forthwith as unjust and unlawful in our
Neighbors, upon the same account.

(3.) The Rule is not, [Do ye unto others all things whatsoever they would have
done unto them.] Men are very apt to covet more than what is their share, more
than belongs to them: And were we bound to do unto every man as he wills and
desires, we should quickly undo our selves, and turn all things into confusion.

(4.) The Rule is not, [All things whatsoever ye will, do ye unto others.] It Is
not Omnia quaecunque vultis, and there a stop; follow the sway of your own
inclinations and lusts. That were to license all manner of iniquity, and to set
open such a floodgate to sin and injuries, as would quickly overwhelm and drown
the World. Quod libet, licet. And, Sic volo sic jubeo, stat pro ratione
voluntas, will not be admitted of here. Our own Will absolutely is not the
measure of our Actions toward others; but it is it self to be ruled by
somewhat else. An Action is not therefore just and warrantable, because we will
it; but our Will must have some Reason or Rule to justify its choice and
determination by.

(5.) The Rule is not, Omnia quaecunque potestis, [Do all that ye can to
others,] all things that ye are able or have power to do, all things you have
an opportunity to do. Power of it self justifies nothing, but must be ever in
conjunction with Justice and Goodness, that all the acts and effects of it may
be warranted. Men may not wrong the weak, because they are stronger; nor the
poor, because they are richer; nor the ignorant and simple, because they are
more learned and cunning; nor any that are under them, because they are in
Authority above them, and have a Sword able to defend their Injustice against
all Disputers. Nay,

(6.) It Is not Omnia quaecunque jure potestis, [Do all that you can do with a
specious pretense of Law to countenance what you do.] Summum jus summa injuria.
The rigor of the Law proves often great injustice; and a man may wrong his own
Conscience by prosecuting of the Law to the height and utmost upon his
Neighbor. Such is the Quod si populorum jussis, si principum decretis, si
sententiis judicum jura constituerentur, jus esset latrocinari, jus adulterare,
jus testamenta falsa supponere, si haec suffragiis vel scitis multitudinis
probarentur. -- Cicero de Leg. l. 1.
imperfection sometimes of Humane Laws, and such the many Arts and Tricks in
the execution of them, the shifting of Courts, the Demurs, the tedious manner
of Process, and the like, that it is in the power of many legally to undo
others, sometimes in the recovery of their own right and due: And the poorer
sort, though they should certainly in the issue be protected from the violence
and wrong intended them by others, yet are sure, like the silly Sheep running
in a Storm for shelter to an Hedge of Thorns and Brambles, to leave their
Fleece for that Protection. We must nor do all to others which we may by Law
possibly defend the doing of. Every one should keep a Court of Chancery in his
own Breast, to mitigate the rigor and severity of the Law, which cannot provide
against all particular inconveniences and abuses. They are not Humane Laws
which are the immediate and adequate Rule of our Conscience and Practice; but a
good Conscience should evermore regulate us in the prosecution of the Law upon
others.

(7.) And lastly, The Rule is not, Omnia quaecunque fecerint vobis, [All things
whatsoever other men have done unto you, do ye even so unto them;] requite
others according to their doings: By no means. Say not, Prove. 20.22.24.29.
I will do to him as he has done to me: Say not thou, I will recompense evil,
I will render to the man according to his work. Thus Solomon advises,
agreeably to the Precepts S. Paul gives us, having learnt them first of his and
our Master Christ: Recompense to no man evil for evil. Romans 12.
Dearly beloved, avenge not your selves: Be not overcome of evil, but overcome
evil with good. We cannot justify the doing others an injury, because they
have done us one first; the grieving of others, because they have grieved us:
Whereof Seneca pronounces, Qui dolorem regerit, tantum excusatius peccat; He
that returns grief for grief, sins only the more excusably; i. e. he sins,
though he has some pretense for it. But Maximus Tyrius the Platonist goes
higher, Dissert. 2.
(...): If to do an injury be an enormity, to return one is the like. Nay, he
rises yet a step higher, (...): He that avengeth himself, seems guilty of the
greater injustice: for, says he, the former ( viz. that did first the wrong)
incurred a reprehension as his only reward; which this avenger by imitation of
him, doing of the like, takes away upon himself; (...), he bears away his
reproach. The like Argument Lactantius makes use of to prove, Lactant. l. 6.
that it is not less evil [referre injuriam quam inferre] to return an injury,
than to do one: For, says he, whosoever labors to return an injury, eum ipsum
a quo laesus est gestit imitari, glories in imitating his evil doings by whom
he was injured. It Is not what others have done to thee, but what thou would
have them do unto thee. Ask thy self then, when thou wast wronged and injured
by another, whether thoughtest thou him to have done well or ill in so wronging
or injuring of thee? And if ill, why should thou attempt the like? Why
should thou be ambitious of his guilt, seeing especially thou have had a
more real savor and taste, if I may so speak, a more feeling sense of the evil
of such an injury, than one that has not received it? It is therefore well
determined by a Reverend Divine, Dr. Jackson on the Creed.
That whoever harh been most hardly dealt with himself, sins most in dealing so
with others, doing what he is most unwilling to have done to himself, and the
evil of which doing he is himself most sensible of. -- Another fault therefore
cannot be our justification for doing of the like: nay, we are so much the more
condemned, as we judge and censure it a fault in others so to have done unto us.

But, some may object, is there not a visible Justice in the Law of Requital?
for any man to suffer quod prior ipse fecerit, the same which he has done?
Does not Nature it self dictate that this is equal, for a man to be rewarded
according to his doings?

-- nec lex est justior ulla
Quam necis artifices art perire sua.
There cannot be any thing more just than this, that one should be taken
himself in the snares which he has laid for others.

All this is yielded, as most certainly true and unquestionable; and no man can
deservedly complain for undergoing himself what he has first done to others.
But then it must be considered, that private persons are not made Judges by God
in their own concerns, have no commission to execute Vengeance. We know who
has said, Vengeance is mine: I will repay it, says the Lord. And he has
appointed his peculiar Ministers and Avengers under himself, to execute wrath
upon him that does evil. The injury of requital of injuries is not in him that
suffers, but in him that does it without warrant and commission from God, only
to satisfy his own grieved mind, and make another smart as he has done him
already.

The Jews themselves, though in their Public Judgments a Lex talionis were
allowed, Exodus 21.24, 25.
viz. Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning
for burning, stripe for stripe: yet in their private conversation and
deportment each toward other, revenge was plainly forbidden them; Levit. 19.18.
Thou shall not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy People;
but thou shall love thy Neighbor as thy self: I am the Lord. Mutual revenge is
forbidden, as a Branch deducible from this Law of Nature, Thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self: of which more by and by. The Prohibition here is clear
and positive,, Thou shall not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children
of thy People: i. e. Thou shall not be mindful of wrong, to requite it: For
that is properly to avenge, to do to others as they have done to us. So we find
it expressed in the Vengeance God commissioned them to take of Babylon, Take
vengeance upon her, Jer. 50.15.
as she has done do unto her. And that none might mistake this for any rule of
self-revenge, or private revenge, it is called in the words immediately before,
the vengeance of the Lord, that Lord to whom vengeance belongs, to whom
vengeance belongs, as the Psalmist reduplicates. Whereas the Law, as we have
seen, is express to the Jews, in reference to their private relation and
converse each with other, Thou shall not avenge nor bear any grudge against the
children of thy people: i. e. Thou shall not return injuries, nor keep them in
mind. The Hebrew Doctors expound it to this purpose. To avenge, say they, is to
deny a good turn to one who has formerly denied it to him; and to be mindful
of a wrong, is to do a good turn to one who formerly would not do so much for
him; but at the doing thereof, to upbraid with his former unkindness, in such
like words as these, I will not deal with thee as thou have dealt with me. And
both, say they, were here forbidden: And according to this explication their
Law required them both to forgive and forget injuries. -- Now look what was
thus the mutual duty of the Jews each to other, our Blessed Savior requires
from us to all men, having taught us to esteem every man as our Neighbor, whom
we are to love as our selves. He requires, I say, the same good disposition in
us toward all men, which among the Jews was restrained more to their own
Contrymen, the Children of their People. See, says S. Paul, 1 These. 5.15.
that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is
good, both among your selves, and to all men. Thus had he learned Christ,
having been instructed in the Truth, as it was in Jesus. S. Mat. 5.39, 40, 41.
I say unto you, says Christ, that ye resist not evil, or that ye avenge not
evil: But whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other
also, (an expression of patience) and if any man will sue thee at the Law, and
take away thy Coat, let him have thy Cloak also; and whosoever shall compel
thee to go with him a mile, go with him twain. So far would Christ have his
Disciples from the Principles of Retaliation, that he enjoins them patience
under supportable and tolerable injuries (such as those here mentioned) if they
cannot right themselves without revenge, rather than to oppose violence to
injustice. It was well advised by Seneca, Percussit te? recede: referiendo enim
and occasionem saepius feriendi dabis and excusationem. Sen. de Ira, l. 2. S.
Hieron. citat. in Cat. D. Tho. in S. Mat. 5.
Has another stricken thee? Give place: for by striking him again thou will
both administer occasion of, and excuse for his striking often, his repeated
blows. And therefore, as S. Hierom notes, Dominus noster vicissitudinem tollens
truncat initia peccatorum; Our Lord and Savior in taking away the return of
contumelies and ill turns, cuts off the beginnings and occasions of sin. It was
never questionless his design to license the injuries of others, Si potes malum
sine tuo malo vel eff^gere vel de^ellere, nemo te vetat facere: sin minus, cave
dixeris, facere sarius est quam pati: si potes, emenda, vel beneficiis obruens
vel mansuetudine vincens: sin aliter, praestat alterum perire, quam utrumque
praestat te patientiae lucro ditescere quam mutua talione mali malos ambos
fieri. Erasm. Enchir. Militis Christiani, p. 150. and similia p. 206.
or to forbid his Disciples the innocent defense of themselves, or recovery of
their right and due; much less to take away from Magistrates, and those in
Authority, the power of securing the good by the punishment of evil doers: but
only to root out all principles of Revenge, by a strict injunction of Christian
Patience. The Rule then we are to be guided by, is not, What others have done
to us; but rather, What they ought to have done to us.

It concerns indeed Public Persons to see Justice executed upon Offenders,
such as should make them as unwilling to do wrong, as others are to suffer it,
the better to discipline them to the practice of this Rule in the Text: and in
so doing, they are so far from breaking, that they well observe that Rule
themselves, doing that for the good, welfare, and security of the Society and
Community wherein they live, which they would desire to be done for themselves
in the like case. A Judge or Magistrate must not look on himself as a private
person, but, Romans 13.
a Minister of God for the punishment of evil doers, and the praise of them
that do well, yea bearing and representing the person of the Community whose
good he is obliged to seek and serve; and therefore he is to do that for the
benefit of the Community, whose great interest it is to have the Laws observed,
and Offenders punished, which he understands in such a case might be reasonably
required of him. Private revenge indeed should not be satisfied, under the
cloak and color of doing Justice; but neither must the Offices of Justice be
overturned and disclaimed by us, whilst we speak against Revenge. The
correction of notorious Offenders is both an office of charity unto them, to
bring them to repentance; and of goodness and justice to the Society wherein
they live, for the warning of others not to do the like, and for the securing
of the innocent: Yet this is no warrant for private persons to snatch the
Magistrates Sword to avenge their own quarrel, or to appeal unto the Magistrate
out of any principle of Malice or Revenge, to wreak their spleen upon such as
have done them wrong, in order to a requital.

In good turns indeed, and benefits, gratitude suggests a retribution; Quid
retribuam? Psalm. 116.12.
Nature teaches the very Publicans and Sinners to return love for love, good
will for good will, courtesy for courtesy: And thus far to observe the Rule
of doing to others as they have done to us, would reform the World, by the
removal of that horrid Vice of unthankfulness from men, whereby they are ready
sometimes to requite good with evil, or prove forgetful and neglective of the
good turns others have done unto them. To these therefore it is seasonable to
say, Do to others the same good you have received from them; be not evil to
those who have been exceeding good and beneficial unto you; return not hatred
to them for their good will and love to you. -- But then in injuries and evils,
curses and imprecations, ill words and actions, we must take heed how we
retaliate, and do to others as we suffer from them: Say not thou, I will do to
him as he has done to me, I will render to the man according to his work.

SECT. IV.
THus much in the Negative, what the Rule is not: I proceed, secondly, to a
more positive declaration of what it is: [All things whatsoever ye would that
men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.]

That we may understand and conceive of this Rule as we ought,

(1.) We may compare it with that other Summary of the Second Table, which
acquaints us with the genuine and inward Principle of it, Thou shall love thy
Neighbor as thy self. And therefore we are wisely instructed in our
Church-Catechism, in answer to that Question, What is thy duty toward thy
Neighbor? to join both these together; My duty toward my Neighbor is, to
love him as my self, and to do to all men as I would they should do to me. The
former of these is styled by S. James, S. Jam. 2.8.
the Royal Law according to the Scriptures. Lex Regia, the Royal Law, that is,
say some, Vide Drusium in loc. and Prove. sacra.
the Law of Christ our King; to which purpose the Syriack reads it Legem Dei,
the Law of God: The Royal Law, say others, for its eminency, a most excellent
Law: The Royal Law, say others, because, like the King's Highway, it is plain,
without windings and turnings, rubs and hindrances, common to all, and belongs
to every one in particular as well as to all: The Royal Law, lastly, say
others, because of its latitude and extent, upon which all other Laws depend,
which takes in and comprehends all other Laws in it self. This is the Royal
Law, the Law of Laws, Thou shall love thy Neighbor as thy self: And this
prescribes affectum eundem, the same affection and disposition to our Neighbor
as to our selves; as the other we are considering of prescribes officia eadem,
the same offices toward our Neighbor as we desire in him toward our selves,
i. e. the same fruits of Love toward our Neighbor, as the love we bear to our
selves suggests to us to wish, expect, and look for from him. (...). Arist.
Rhet. lib. 2.
The Philosopher's definition of Love is, To will such things to another as we
conceive good, without self ends; and to promote and do the same according to
our power. Whereby if we measure the loving of our Neighbor as our selves, it
must needs run into this we are upon, All things whatsoever ye would that men
should do to you, do ye even so unto them. Amoris tui erga proximum mensura es
tu ipse: singulos sic dilige, quomodo tu ab iis diligi velles, si esses illorum
loco. Camero.
Thou art thy self become the measure of thy love toward thy Neighbor, as
Camero has it: so love thou others, as thou would be loved by them if thou
were in their place and stead: i. e. Love thou others with the same sincerity
wherewith thou love thy self, and give proof of this love by doing the same
to them as thou would desire they should do to thee in the like condition.
The Law refers us to our selves, because we are naturally inclined to
self-love, and in our own interest and concerns plerunque rectius videmus quid
aequum sit, Grot. in loc.
we do for the most part see more rightly what is equal; at least, we are not
apt to wrong our selves. Salust.
Nemini suae injuriae leves videntur; No man thinks his own injuries light.
Camerarius.
Sua quisque maxima esse judicat mala; Every one judges his own evils
greatest; every one is concluded truest to his own interest and concerns.

So then to love our Neighbor as our selves, is the soul and life of this
Precept, to do to our Neighbor as we would be done by our selves: And thus the
Rule before us prescribes, not only to our outward actions, but to our inward
affections also. There must be an agreement between our heart and practice, our
will and doings. What we are to do to our Neighbors, the same we are to wish,
intend, love, desire, choose, resolve upon; and what we ought not to effect, we
may not inwardly covet or delight in without transgression. Quid refert mala
non facere quae affectu concupiscis? Quid refert bona foris agere, quibus
diversa fiant intus? Erasm. Euchir. Mil. Christ. p. 119.
The Laws of Christ reach to the Principles of our Actions, as well as to the
Actions themselves; to the hidden and invisible, as well as to the open and
visible part of them; to the fountain, as well as to the streams; to the cause,
as well as to the effects. Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self; and, All
things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto
them, have the same reference each to other as the cause and the effect, as the
fountain and the strram, as the inside and outside of one and the same Duty.

(2.) We may farther enlarge our conceptions by viewing together this
Affirmative Precept, and the Negative that is deducible from it, and (as has
been said before) to be referred unto it: for every positive Precept includes a
double Prohibition in it. (1.) Of the omission of the duty required: And, (2.)
Of the commission of the contrary evil. Whoever commands the doing of any good,
forbids at the same time the neglect of that good, and the evil opposite unto
it. He that injoyns us to do well, does as certainly bid us cease to do evil,
and includes withal somewhat more in his Injunctions, than if he had nakedly
bid us cease to do evil. A negative Religion only will not serve our turns; we
must be also positively good: and yet so we cannot be, without ceasing first to
be evil, this being the beginning of our wisdom, stultitia caruisse. The
positive Precept then is the more perfect and entire, as including both the
Prohibition and Command in it self: And thus we are to interpret the Rule of
the Text, by supplying it with its Negative, that is, the advice of Tobit to
young Tobias, Do that to no man which thou hate; what thou would not that
men should do unto thee, do not thou thy self that unto them.

(3.) To prevent all mistakes and misapplications of this Rule to Practice,
there are two or three things farther to be noted by way of caution about it.

(1.) In the general we must remember, that this Rule may never be so
understood or applied as to contradict or subvert any other of the more
particular Laws and Appointments of Christ, Quod tibi bonum praestari velles,
idem debes ipse alteri praestare in eisdem circumstantiis, quoad fieri potest
citra tertii alicujus injuriam. Quod malum tibi fieri nolles a faciendo illud
alteri ipse debes abstinere quoad fieri potest absque tertii alicujus injuria.
Dr. More Enchir. Eth. p. 22.
or the Order established and approved by him. We are to conclude, that it is
not at odds with any particular Laws of Charity and Justice, being indeed
designed only for a brief and universal comprehension of them, and as a fence
and security to them; that we transgress not at any time through inordinate
love of our selves; but since we are every one presumed to be hearty
prosecutors of our interest and concerns, we make this our pattern, example,
and square in our dealings with others, as sincerely to have respect unto their
good as our own, that we have not a measure and a measure, unjust balances, one
for our selves and another for our neighbors; it having been generally
observed in the World, Homo in se aliud fert, in alterum aliud cogitat.
Laberius.
that men have one judgment for themselves, and another for their neighbors,
so as to condemn others at the same time, and in the same things, wherein they
acquit and justify themselves; and deem that evil in others toward them,
which they continually practice themselves toward others; and that good in
others toward them, which they deny continually unto others. To prevent now
this undue bias of self-love and self-seeking, Christ requires us to use the
same measure to others as to our selves, as sincerely to love others as our
selves, and do for them as we desire they should do for us: To sell as we would
buy: for, Prove. 20.10.
Diverse weights and diverse measures are both of them alike an abomination unto
the Lord. This now being the purpose of the Rule, to prevent or remove that
grand prejudice which makes us swerve and decline from the particular Precepts
of Order, Justice, and Charity toward our Neighbor, we cannot, we must not at
any time so understand or apply it as to cross and oppose any of those Precepts.

(2.) Therefore when our Blessed Savior says, All things whatsoever ye would
that men should do unto you, he must be understood only de voluntate regulata
and ordinata, of a well-ordered and regulate Will, a Will following the
dictates of right Reason and Religion, and consequently only conversant about
things truly good and meet to be done; and therefore whether we add the word
[bona] or no, as some Latin Versions have done, [ quaecunque bona -- Whatsoever
good things ye would that men should do unto you] it is most certain that we are
so to understand and conceive of it, as to exclude omne maleficium, every evil
work or thing from being the object of our will. It Is S. Augustines
Observation, De Civ. Dei, l. 14. c. 8.
that Voluntas non est proprie nisi in bonis, in malis cupiditas dicitur; Will
is proper to good objects, but we call it Lust in evils. And, Hoc loco modo
quodam proprio voluntas posita est, quae in mal^ accipi non potest: In this
place (says he) Will is to be taken in that proper manner as not to be
conceived of that which is evil. None in his right mind wishes to himself what
is evil and inconvenient: we must not imagine that our Savior refers us to our
corrupted and vitiated Wills; but he supposes them according to their natural
and true state and temper, not according to what they may prove by degeneracy,
evil habits and customs; as they should be, as they were made by God and
appointed to be, and not as they are through our default and corruption; as
they are in the best of men, and not in the worst: for, specimen naturae --
capiendum ex optima natura; and as Bishop Andrews somewhere observes, the
Scripture often speaks of things, not as they are corrupted, but as they ought
to be. The sense of the Rule then is clearly this, ut aliis praestemus ea,
Grot. in S. Mat. 7.
quae ratio dictat non inique nos ab aliis postulaturos; That we do unto others
such things as reason dictates we should not unjustly desire from others our
selves. Whatsoever ye would,] i. e. reasonably and regularly.

(3.) There must be considerata personarum mutatio, a considerate change of
persons; that is, we must suppose other men in our condition, rank, and place,
and our selves in theirs; and so deal with every one, as if we had exchanged
persons and conditions with them: Vt recte judicemus persona mutanda est,
idemque statuendum in altero quod in nobis aequum simus existimaturi, Id. ibid.
as Grotius speaks: That we may judge aright, the Person must be changed, and
we must determine the same for another which we would judge equal for our
selves were we in his room. If it is bitter unto thee to bear an injury (says
Lactantius) and he that does it seems unjust in thy account, Lactant. l. 6.
transfer in alterius personam quod in te sentis, and in tuam quod de altero
judicas; remove that by way of supposition to another person which thou feel
in thy self, and that to thy own person which thou judge of another, and thou will presently understand tam Te injuste facere si alteri noceas, quam Alterum,
si tibi; That thou thy self do as much unjustly in injuring of another, as
another in hurting thee. We should therefore, as he speaks, in aliis hominibus
nos ipsos cogitare, cap. 10.
in nobis alios, think of our selves in other men, and of others in our selves,
a due respect being had to the several circumstances and distinctions of our
qualities and conditions: That is, So obedient should we be to our Governors,
as we desire and expect those under our Government should be unto us; so are we
to honor our Parents, as we would desire our Children should honor us; be so
respective to our Inferiors, as we desire our Superiors should be to us. Of
which, with many other Instances, hereafter.

Lastly, The scope and meaning of the Rule will be as clear and full as may be,
if we add one Observation more to what has been said. The learned Dr. Hammond
notes, Pract. Cat. p. 299.
That [Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you] by an Hebraism imports
[Whatsoever ye would have done to you] i. e. by whomsoever, and so by God or
Christ as well as Man. We may observe indeed many instances in the New
Testament, wherein the third person Plural is put to express a passive sense:
Thus S. Luke 6.38. S. Luke 6.38.
Give, and it shall be given unto you, good measure, pressed down, and shaken
togerher shall men give into your bosom; (...), shall they give into your
bosom, is all one with (...), shall be given unto you. Again, chapter 12.20. chapter
12.20.
where we read not amiss in the English, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall
be required of thee, it is in the Greek (...), this night do they require thy
soul of thee. Again chapter 16.9. chapter 16.9.
where it is said, Make to your selves friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness, that when ye fail they may receive you into everlasting
habitations; it is probably no more than, that ye may be received into
everlasting habitations. And to name but one place more, chapter 23.31. chapter 23.31.
when it is said, If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in
the dry? (...) is no more in sense than, If these things be done in a green
tree. -- And thus now if we read also the third person Plural in the Text in a
passive sense, the words will run thus, [All things whatsoever ye would have
done to your selves, or to be done to your selves:] And accordingly the Latin
Style of this Precept generally runs, Quod tibi fieri vis; which, if we follow
it, extends, as has been said, to whatsoever we desire or wish to our selves
from God or Christ as well as from Men, that to the utmost of our power we be
ready also to do the same unto others. Whether the Hebraism will enforce it
here, or no (the word (...), men, being expressed before the Verb Plural, which
I find not in the original of any of the other Instances) sure I am, the
Illative Particle ushering in the Text, whereof I have before discoursed,
fairly suggests this sense unto us, inferring this our duty toward men from
our expectation of good things from God, as has been showed. The general
Inforcement of those particular Precepts of Charity and Mercy wherewith S. Luke
conjoyns this of the Text, and which are easily to be deduced from this, is the
Divine Pattern toward us, Be ye therefore merciful even as your Father is
merciful: S. Luke 6.36.
And it is the Petition of our daily Prayers, Forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive them that trespass against us: And of all Petitions in the Lords
Prayer, our Blessed Savior bestows a Comment upon none but that, to fix and
engage our thoughts the rather upon it; For, S. Mat. 6.14, 15.
(says he) if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
Father forgive your trespasses. And we are given more than once to understand,
that we must expect the same measure from God our selves, as we mete to others:
Of which more hereafter. This sense we may the rather embrace, Optime hoc
exemplum Principi constituam, ad quod formetur, ut se talem esse civibus quales
sibi Deos velit. Expedit ergo habere inexorabilia peccatis atque erroribus
numina? Expedit usque ad ultimam infesta perniciem? Ecquis regum erit tutus?
Cujus non membra Aruspices colligant? Quod si Dii placabiles and aequi delicta
potentium non statim fulminibus persequuntur, quanto aequius est hominem
hominibus praepositum miti animo exercere imperium and cogitare utrum mundi
status gratior oculis pulchriorque sit sereno and puro die, an cum fragoribus
crebris omnia quatiuntur and ignes hinc atque illinc micant? Atqui non alia
facies est quieti moderatique imperii, quam sereni coeli and nitentis. Crudele
regnum turbidum tenebrisque obscurum est inter trementes and ad repentinum
sonitum expavescentes, nec eo quidem, qui omnia turbat, inconcusso. Sen. de
Clem l. 1. c. 7.
because even the Heathen Seneca has mounted to this pitch also: Speaking of
that mercy which becomes a Prince, he thus proceeds. I may very well set this
Example before a Prince to imitate, viz. That he show himself such to his
Citizens, as he would have the Gods to be unto himself. Is it therefore
desirable or expedient, says he, for him to have the Deities inexorable, as to
his sins and errors, and so provoked to, and resolved upon the utmost
destruction? Who among Kings would then be safe? If therefore the Gods are
placable and equal, and do not presently persecute the faults of those in Power
with Thunderbolts, how much more is it reasonable that a man set over men
should exercise his power with a meek mind, and think with himself whether the
state of the world be not more grateful to the eyes, and beautiful, in a serene
and clear day, than in Thunder, Storms, and Tempests? etc. --

Thus that Morallist excellently. And there is a Proverb that has much in it,
expressing the good temper that ought to be in men toward others of their own
kind; Homo homini Deus, such a man is a God to another. We should all study
then to be such our selves toward others, as we desire to find God to our
selves.

The result of all is this, That our desires of doing good and not evil unto
others, be such as may fitly become an equipoise to our desires of receiving
good and not evil from God or others: That we be disposed to wish and do the
same good unto other men, which we piously desire from God, or reasonably
expect from other men in a like condition our selves. Calvin. cit. in Expos.
Eccles. in S. Mat. 7.
Regnaret perfecta aequitas, si activae charitatis tam fideles essemus
discipuli, quam acuti sumus passivae doctores, as Calvin well phraseth it;
Perfect equity would obtain in the World, were we once as faithful Disciples of
active Charity, as we are acute Teachers of the Passive: i. e. Were we as ready
to do good as we are to receive it, and as unwilling to wrong others as we are
to suffer injuries our selves.

I have said what may suffice for the explaining of this Rule. I am engaged,

SECT. V.
SEcondly, To an Inquiry into those Grounds and Foundations which support it:
Those Truths, I mean, which it presupposes and relies upon. And them I shall
refer to the following Heads.

(1.) Every man is here presupposed to have an entire love and regard to
himself. He must needs first love himself, who is obliged to love his Neighbor
as himself; and it is a man's love to himself that makes him to will good and
not evil from others to himself, which is here made the pattern and measure of
his demeanor toward others. We need not any Precept from God for the loving
of our selves, which is a Principle that Nature has taught every Creature,
viz. a self-love and desire of its own preservation and happiness, and
thereupon an inclination and appetite toward what is good, agreeable, and
convenient, with an aversation and declination from whatsoever appears
otherwise. And yet so it is, that man oftentimes mistaking himself, hates
himself indeed instead of loving himself. Men look upon their Bodies as
themselves, which are little more than the case and outside of themselves; and
these they love inordinately, and hereby prove real haters of, and enemies to
their Souls, the better and chiefest part of themselves: for it is the Mind, and
Soul, and Spirit which is principally the Man, and whosoever loves not that,
loves not himself: Ephesians. 5.29.
No man ever hated his own flesh, (says the Apostle) but nourishes and
cherishes it. No man, to be sure, in his right wits; no man, unless he were
mad and distracted, alienated and estranged from himself: And yet it is too
common a sight (which we have every where almost before our eyes) to behold men
that hate their own Souls, instead of nourishing and cherishing of them:
though, the truth is, of these persons too we must say, they are not
themselves; Gal. 3.1.
they are (...), fools and besotted; they are (...), bewitched; and whenever
they do return to themselves, when they do resipiscere, grow wise again, they
will lament and exclaim against their own madness. Who, understanding and
loving of himself, would continually stab and wound and injure himself? Yet so
does every sinner by his transgressions: Prove. 8.36.
He that sins against me, says the Divine Wisdom, wrongeth his own soul;
all they that hate me love death. There is no such injury and hurt to a man's
self as sin.

True it is, Christ commands all his Disciples (...), S. Mat. 16.24.
to deny themselves, to abandon and disown themselves in some cases as Parents
are wont to serve their ungracious Children; and, they that are Christ's, Gal.
5.24.
says S. Paul, (...), have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.
Nay, says our Savior, S. Luke 14.26.
If any man come after me, and do not (...), hate his own soul, i. e. his own
life, he cannot be my Disciple.

But all these and the like expressions import no more than not to sin, to
mortify sin, to abandon the occasions and temptations of sinning, to lay down
our lives and part with our temporal conveniences, rather than to sin: And
this is enjoined us, that we may not, in the truest sense, (...), S. Mat. 16.26.
damnifie and injure our souls, lose our own souls, wrong our own souls; so
that no more is here called for but what the most real love of our selves
engages us to. He that submits to some present pain and grief, in order to the
recovery and continuance of a long health and pleasure, does certainly therein
discover not an hatred, but a love of himself: And he that is willing to
undergo some temporal damage, yea, and the loss of his own life, in order to an
eternal and glorious happiness, keeps most undeniably constant and true to this
principle of self-love. Whoever then is a lover, chuser, and embracer of sin,
though set off with the greatest outward allurements and conveniences, is
really an hater and wronger of himself: And whoever hates, abandons, and
forsakes his sins, though never so much to his outward loss and damage, is in
truth a lover of himself. He that is unwilling to leave his sins, to be
disturbed in his sins, to be reproved for his sins, so far wants love to
himself. He that is willing to be tempted to sin, to be flattered in sin, to be
gratified and farthered in a course of sinning, is in like manner so far
wanting in a true love to himself: And he that loves not himself, is not yet
prepared for doing unto others what he would have others do unto him; because
he wills such things from others, which are indeed prejudicial and hurtful to
himself. -- Some there are who take pleasure in the corrupting and debauching
of each other, se invicem turpitudine illicitae voluptatis oblectare, as S.
Augustine speaks; De Civ. Dei, l. 14. c. 8.
to gratify each other in some base aund unlawful delights. -- Now the Rule
before us cannot be so understood as to warrant their wickedness, because they
do unto each other as they would be done by themselves, inasmuch as their Wills
are not set upon such things as are truly good and reasonable, but really
prejudicial and hurtful to themselves. Corrupted man may not thus reason, I
desire not my self to be checked for my sins, and therefore I will not blame or
reprove any others; I desire my self to be served and accommodated with all
means and opportunities for the accomplishing of my lusts, and therefore I will
also farther others in the like; I love my self to drink to excess, and
therefore I will make others drunken also, etc. Remarkable is that Precept in
the Law, Thou shall not hate thy Brother in thy heart, Levit. 19.17.
thou shall in any wise rebuke thy Neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him. Vide
Ainsworth in loc.
Some of the Jewish Writers, it is true, expound it to this purpose; That when
one man sins against another, he should not inwardly hate him hereupon, but
make it known to the Offender, and say, Why have thou done thus to me? tell him
freely, plainly, and roundly of it: And so it is much-what the same with that of
our Blessed Savior, S. Luke 17.3.
If thy Brother sin against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
But then others as warrantably take the words in a greater extent; He that
sees his Neighbor sin, says Maimonides, or walk in a way not good, is
commanded to admonish him to do better, and to certify him, that he sins
against himself by his evil deeds, as it is written, Rebuking thou shall rebuke
thy Neighbor, which is the Original of this Law in Leviticus. The Hebrew word
is noted to signify, to rebuke with conviction of argument, by words to show
what is right, and refel the contrary. But that which I chiefly observe here,
is, that this is enjoined as an Office of Love to our Neighbor; Thou shall not
hate thy neighbor in thy heart; thou shall in any wise rebuke thy neighbor,
and not suffer sin upon him: or, as it may be rendered, lest thou bear sin for
him, i. e. become guilty of his sin, and so partake of his punishment. -- To
keep others from sin, is to keep them from doing the greatest mischief to
themselves, and so an undoubted office of the truest love: and on the other
side, to solicit persons unto sin, or to sooth them up in their sins, is to
do them the greatest injury, and so to hate them in our hearts. Thus therefore
we may not do to others, though we should vitiously covet that others should do
so unto us, because this will of ours arises not from a true love to our
selves, but from a perverted love, a blind and mistaken love, a love which is
really and effectually the greatest hatred: Such a false love as this deceives
many, and is too common in the world.

Erasmus intending to show how men abuse the words of Love and Hatred, Jam
amoris and odii vocabulis vide quam mundus abutatur. Cum adolescens insanus
puellam deperit, id vulgus amorem appellat, cum nullum verius sit odium. Verus
amor vel suo dispendio commodis alienis consulere cupit. Ille quo nisi ad suam
voluptatem spectat? Igitur non illam sed semetipsum amat, quanquam ne se quidem
amat: nemo enim alium amare potest, nisi se prius amarit, sed recte: nemo
quenquam odisse potest, nisi se prius oderit: verum been amare nonnunquam been
odisse est and recte odisse amasse est, etc. Erasm. Enchirid. Mil. Christiani,
p. 135, 136.
discourses thus: -- When a Youth is mad of a young Maid, that the common
people call Love, when as there is not a truer hatred. True love consults
another benefit, though with his own loss. But what does this fond Youth look
at, save his own pleasure? He loves not her therefore, but himself: nay, he
loves not indeed himself; for none can love another, unless he first love
himself, and that aright: none can hate another, unless he first hate himself.
But then to love well is sometimes to hate well, and to hate well is to love
well: Therefore he that for so small an advantage by his flatteries and gifts
lays snares for the Maid, that he may deprive her of that which is her best, to
wit, her integrity, her modesty, her simplicity, her good mind, her fame, does
this man, think you, hate or love her? Certainly there can be no hatred more
cruel than this. So when foolish Parents indulge their Childrens Vices, men say
commonly, How tenderly do these Persons love their Children! But rather, how
cruelly do they hate them, who whilst they give way to their own affections,
neglect their Childrens salvation? For what other thing does our most envious
enemy the Devil wish us, than that here sinning with impunity, we should fall
into eternal punishment? Again, Men call him a gentle Master, and a merciful
Prince, who either connives at, or favors certain wickednesses, that they may
sin the more licentiously, being left without the dread of punishment. But what
else does the Lord threaten by his Prophet to those whom he thinks unworthy
of his mercy? And I will not visit upon your daughters, says he, when they
commit fornication, etc. And what did he promise to David? I will visit, says
he, with the rod their iniquities, and with stripes their sins; but my mercy
will I not take away from them. -- In Christ all things are made new, and the
names of things are changed. He that loves himself amiss, does bear a deadly
hatred to himself. He that misplaceth his mercy is cruel. Well to take care of
a man's self, is to neglect himself. Well to hurt himself, is to profit himself.
Well to destroy himself, is to preserve himself. Thou will then show a care to
thy self, if thou shall contemn the desires of the flesh. Thou will do that man
a courtesy, whose vices thou shall be cruel against; if thou shall slay the
sinner, thou shall save the man; if thou shall destroy what Man has done
amiss, thou shall restore what God made. -- Thus far Erasmus, whose words I
have translated hither, as a pertinent illustration both of that pretended love
which is so common among men, and that genuine and sincere love to our selves,
which the Rule I am speaking of presupposes and is built upon.

(2.) This Rule presupposes farther a continual converse with our selves, a
living in the daily exercise of consideration and self-reflection, that we may
not act toward others rashly and unadvisedly, but upon a true understanding
and compare of another condition with our own; that we may know what we should
expect from other men, and so what they in like manner may reasonably challenge
and require of us. The Rule is wholly and altogether in vain, if men never give
themselves to consider, or live at such a rate that they are indisposed for the
exercise of self-reflection. It is in vain, as I said, to prescribe to any,
that they would do unto others as they would others should do unto them, if
they never reflect upon their own thoughts and desires, if they never take time
impartially to suppose themselves in another state, and make another case
their own. This Prescription therefore of our Blessed Savior supposes men to
live a sober and temperate life, in the free exercise of their reasonable and
deliberate thoughts; not so to immerse themselves in the cares of the world, or
a multitude of employments; not so to drown and besot themselves with sensual
entertainments, to make their souls heavy with drunkenness and excess; not so
to transport themselves with passion and lust, as to indispose themselves
wholly for consideration, or the unbyassed and unprejudicate application of it,
for the squaring and direction of their actions. God having made us reasonable
Creatures, and written certain Laws of equity upon the Tables of our
Conscience, expects from us that we should find time to reflect and consider
with our selves, and keep our selves in a temper capable of inferring from our
own thoughts the Principles of our doings, that we may even of our selves judge
that which is right: and we shall never act according to this Rule of doing as
we would be done by, unless our thoughts continually hold a looking-glass
before our eyes, or present a balance to our hands, for the due pondering and
weighing of our own state and condition and other men's together, that so our
own rational desires and expectations from others, may regulate our actions
toward them. This Law of Christ, you see, clearly presupposes much of
self-converse, and such a way of life as may dispose us thereunto; that we
never so devote our selves to any drudging Employment, as to hinder the making
of a pause now and then with our own thoughts; and that we lead not such a
brutish course, as to be left incapable of consideration to any good effect or
purpose, never to understand what is fitting for our selves to desire of
others, never to mind and observe the case of others, or never to be like Men
or Christians affected therewith; like those mentioned in the Prophet Amos,
Amos 6.1, 3, 4, 5, 6.
who are at ease in Sion, and secure in the Mountain of Samaria; who put far
away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near; that lie upon
beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat lambs out of
the flock, and calves out of the midst of the stall; that chant to the sound of
the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music like David; that drink
wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are
not grieved for the affliction of Joseph: That is, Who lay to heart no more the
troubles of the Posterity of Joseph, than his Brethren did his in particular,
when they cast him into the Pit, and sold him to the Merchants, never minding
or careing what became of him; but indulge themselves in the mean while to all
excess of riot, even whilst other of their Brethren languish under want and
oppression. Such persons as these, who live in jollity, and spend their time in
pleasure, to the satisfaction of the flesh, do usually cast off all
thoughtfulness about others, who are in misery and adversity: that is, they
never consider the hardships and calamities that others undergo, and so what
they would look for at others hands were they in their case.

These two are the more general Suppositions which the Rule of the Text
builds upon, to wit, our natural and genuine love to our selves, and our
living in the due exercise of thoughtfulness and consideration, self-converse
and reflection, that we may know upon every occasion what we should reasonably
desire of others for our selves.

SECT. VI.
THere are yet three things farther, which do more particularly declare the
Foundation and reasonableness of this Precept to us, viz.

1. See Dr. Jackson's excellent Sermons on the Text, l. 11. c. 32. 33.
The actual equality of all Men by Nature, and of Christians by Grace.

2. The possible equality of Condition in all: And,

3. The immovable Standard and Rule of Justice, which gives all to expect from
God and Men here, or at least from God hereafter, accordingly as they have
measured unto others.

We all stand upon equal terms by Nature, as we are Men of the same kind; and
by Grace, as Christians.

Possible it is, we may our selves be in the very same condition with others:
And,

Certain it is, that we shall our selves either here or hereafter receive the
same measure we mete to others with: And therefore,

In all these laid together we have a firm ground for the Precept now
considered of, that whatsoever we would should be done to us, we do the same to
others. Of each of these Heads briefly.

(1.) All men have an equality by Nature. Nihil est unum uni tam simile tam
par, quam omnes inter nosmet sumus. Cicero de Leg. l. 1.
Though they differ much from each other in their places and stations in the
world, yet it is but as so many Figures of the same denomination would do in
different places, one suppose in the Unites, another in the Tens, another in
the Hundreds, another in the Thousands, etc. We are all of the same kind,
partakers of the same reasonable and religious nature: We are all consanguinei,
descended from one common Parent: We are all originally of the same dust, and
shall be resolved into the same again: We are all made and preserved by one and
the same God. -- Omnibus ille idem pater est. I may here well demand with the
Prophet, Have we not all one Father? Mal. 2.10.
Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against
his brother? q. d. Partial and treacherous dealing is unaccountable between
them who stand related each to other as fellow creatures of the same God, as
fellow-brethren of one and the same Father. Job 31.13, 14, 15.
If I did despise the cause of my manservant, or of my maidservant, when they
contended with me, (says Job) what then shall I do when God rises up? and
when he visits, what shall I answer him? Did not he that made me in the womb
make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? or, as the margin reads, Did
he not fashion us in one womb? The rich and the poor meet together, Prove. 22. ^
(says Solomon) the Lord is the Maker of them all. Prove. 29.13.
And again, The Lord enlightneth both their eyes. "God (says the Apostle Paul)
that made the world, Act. 17.26.
and all things therein, has made of one blood all Nations of men for to dwell
on the face of the earth. And, says the Psalmist of these Inhabitants of the
earth, The Lord fashioneth their hearts alike. Psalm. 33.15.
So that we may well conceive what others would desire of us, Alterius animum
de tuo metiaris. Lactant.
by what we our selves desire of others; and there is great reason we should be
to others such as we would have them be toward our selves, Prove. 27.19. As in
water face answers to face, so the heart of man to man. Wisd. 7.6. All men
have one entrance into life, and the like going out.
even upon this account I am speaking of; in as much as we are partakers of one
and the same humane Nature, joint possessors of the same Earth, Fellow-Citizens
of the same World, Brethren of the same Descent, Branches sprouting from one
and the same Stock. All men are valuable to us, in that they are homines,
Lactant.
and idem quod nos sumus, men, and the same that we our selves are. When God
injoyns us to love one another, it is, as S. Chrysostom somewhere observes,
Ecclus 13.15. Every beast loves his like.
little more than that natural Law, quam Leones and Lupi servant, which even
Lions and Wolves keep to, not to devour Creatures of the same kind with
themselves: -- saevis inter se convenit Vrsis. The savage Bears do yet agree
with each other. (...). -- Theocr. Idyl. 9.
Where there is nothing else to tie and oblige us unto others, their communion
and participation of the same nature with our selves is sufficient. Humanitas
summum inter se hominum vinculum, as Lactantius speaks. Est aliquid quod in
hominem licere commune jus animantium vetet, quia ejusdem naturae est cujus tu.
-- Sen. de Clem. li. 1. c. 18.
To this purpose Seneca well notes, that there is somewhat unlawful toward man
upon this common right with other living Creatures, even because he is of the
same nature with our selves. And therefore Aristotle, when he was accused for
relieving a notoriously wicked man, made this rational Appology for himself,
(...). That he had not respect to the manners, but to the man: And again,
(...). That he gave not to the man as so qualified; but relieved Humanity in
him, considered the Nature more than the Person. Thus far we have an actual
equality with each other as men, in as much as we are all of one and the same
kind, fashioned alike as to the frame of our Bodies and the general
inclinations of our hearts, partakers, as of the same flesh and blood, so of
the same reasonable souls; descended from the same Adam, having one and the
same Creator, and bearing the same Divine Image; born alike into the world,
(...) Phocyl. Poem. admon.
and passing alike out of it, and to be raised alike again after Death to
Judgment.

But then beyond this the Christian Religion equals us much more, in as much as
we are thereby made capable of the same happiness, and redeemed and purchased
by the same Savior, who tasted death alike for every man, and gave himself a
ransom for all. Tantum hoc cogita, frater est in Domino, cohaeres in Christo,
ejusdem corporis membrum, eodem redemptus sanguine, fidei communis socius, ad
eandem gratiam and felicitatem futurae vitae vocatus: quemadmodum Apostolus
dixit, Unum corpus and unus spiritus, sicut vocati estis in una spe vocationis
vestrae, unus Dominus and una Fides, unum Baptisma, unus Deus and Pater omnium.
Alienus esse qui potest quicum tibi tam multiplex intercedit unitatis copula?
Erasm. Enchir. Mil. Christ. p. 143, 144.
And we, as Christians, are farther equal, in that we are united in the same
Sacraments, in the same Faith and Hope, Disciples of the same Lord and Master,
Believers of the same Gospel, Baptized with the same Water, Participants of
that one Loaf and one Cup, which is the Body and Blood of Christ, sanctified
with one and the same Spirit, enriched with the same Grace, Fellow Members of
the same mystical Body, one only holy and Catholic Church, and Joynt-heirs of
the same Promises and Glory. -- Who now art thou, whether Man or Christian,
that vauntest and preferrest thy self above others, or refusest to walk by the
same Rule toward them, which thou art ready to prescribe them toward thy self?

This is the first Particular, The Actual Equality of all Men by Nature, and of
Christians by Grace: Upon the account of which we should, as S. Paul advises,
be of the same mind one toward another, and be kindly affectioned one to
another, with brotherly love, in honor preferring one another, Romans 12.

(2.) Possible it is for every man to be in the same state and condition with
any other. As with the People, Isa. 24.2.
so with the Priest, or Prince; as with the Servant, so with his Master; as
with the Maid, so with her Mistress; as with the Buyer, so with the Seller; as
with the Lender, so with the Borrower; as with the taker of Usury, so with the
giver of Usury to him, says the Prophet. Quod cuiquam contigit, cuivis potest;
That which has happened to another, may happen unto thee. We should all thus
reckon with our selves, that being Men, we may possibly undergo whatsoever
other Men have undergone, or do undergo. We are liable to the same imfirmities,
and the same afflictions, and the same temptations with others. 1 Cor. 10.12,
13.
Let him that thinks he stands, says the Apostle, take heed lest he fall:
There has no temptation taken you, (...), but such as is vulgaris and frequens
inter homines, common unto men. And again, in his Epistle to the Galatians,
(which I before occasionally mentioned) Brethren, Gal 6.1.
if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one
in the spirit of meekness, considering thy self, lest thou also be tempted. Det
ille veniam facile, cui venia est opus, as Seneca has it; Let him be ready to
pardon, who himself stands in need of pardon: verse. 2.
Bear ye one another burdens, and so fulfill the Law of Christ. Again, when S.
Paul presses unto Christian Charity, I mean not, says he, 2 Cor. 8.13, 14.
that other men should be eased, and you burdened: but by an equality, that
now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their
abundance also may be a supply for your want, that there may be equality:
Putting them in mind in the time of their fullness, that a time of want might
come unto them also, wherein it would be as desirable for them to partake of
the abundance of others, as it was now seasonable for others to partake of
theirs. -- Remember, Hebr. 13.3.
says the Author to the Hebrews, them that are in bonds, as bound with them;
and them which suffer adversity, as being your selves also in the body: In
corpore iisdem malis obnoxio; as being your selves clothed with the same frail
and mortal flesh, and subject to the same evil and sad accidents, liable to the
same bonds and adversity which they suffer under. This is a natural Principle
of compassion and sympathy with others, whatever their condition be, that ours
may be the same. Romans 12.15.
Rejoice therefore with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep. --
It Is possible, (...). Hesiod. He that requiteth good turns is mindful of what
may come hereafter, and when he falls he shall find a stay, Ecclus 3.31.
Dishonor not a man in his old age, for even some of us wax old, chapter 8.6. Help
thy neighbor according to thy power, and beware that thou fall not into the
same, chapter 29.20. Many Kings have sat on the ground, etc. chapter 11.5, 6. When
thou have enough remember the time of hunger, and when thou art rich think upon
poverty and need, etc. chapter 18.25, 26. Remember my judgment, for thine also
shall be so: yesterday for me, and to day for thee, chapter 38.22. (...). Phocyl.
I say, that the condition of another may be the same hereafter with ours, and
ours the same with another; and therefore we are in every state of life so to
carry it toward others, as we would desire them, when the case is altered, to
do toward us. Thou who art a Servant, may be a Master: Thou whou who art a
Master, also a Servant: Thou who art a Parent, have been a Child; and thou who
art a Child, may be a Parent: Thou who art rich, may become poor; and thou
who art poor, may, by God's blessing, become rich: Thou who art well in
health and ease, may be sick and pained; Thou who art young, may be old and
decrepit; Thou who art beautiful, may be deformed, etc.

We are all liable to variety of changes in the world, and may possibly
exchange relations and conditions with other men; and therefore should now do
to others as we would then have them do to us. That is the second Particular.

(3.) And lastly, It Is the dictate both of Nature and Scripture, That we are to
look for the same measure from God and Men, either here or hereafter, wherewith
we mete unto others. The Heathen Cicero quotes it from an ancient Poet, -- Qui
alteri exitium parat, 2 Tuscul.

Eum scire opportet sibi paratam pestem ut participet
Parem. --
He that prepares destruction for another, should know that a like Plague is
prepared for himself to partake of: And Seneca asks the Question, Quae injuria
est pati quod prior ipse feceris? Wherein art thou injured, if thou suffer
but what thou have first done thy self? A guilty Conscience naturally suggests
unto the sinner to expect evil in the same manner and measure wherein he has
done it; and it is a peculiar Attribute whereby Almighty God is known unto us,
The God to whom vengeance belongs, to whom vengeance belongs,
reduplicative; and he will certainly repay it, in making the evil of punishment
commensurate to that of sinning, and doing to men as they have dealt to others.
How readily did the guilty minds of Joseph's Brethren acquit God for a just
retribution upon themselves, revenging their carriage toward their Brother:
Genesis 42.21.
We are verily guilty, say they, concerning our brother, in that we saw the
anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is
this distress come upon us. Adonibezeck in like manner, when his thumbs and
great toes were cut off, Seventy Kings, Judge. 1.6, 7.
says he, having their thumbs and great toes cut off, gathered their meat
under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. Instances of this kind
there are very many, had I time now to collect them. He made a pit and dug
it, Psalm. 7.15, 16. See Ecclus 27.26.
says the Psalmist of the wicked man, and is fallen into the ditch which he
made; his mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing
shall come down upon his own pate. And Solomon has forewarned sinners what
they must expect; Prove. 1.21.
They shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own
devices. And again, Prove. 5.22.
His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with
the cords of his sins. Woe to thee that spoilest, Isa. 33.1.
says the Prophet, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and
they dealt not treacherously with thee: when thou shall cease to spoil, thou
shall be spoiled; and when thou shall make an end to deal treacherously, they
shall deal treacherously with thee. To the same effect the Prophet Micah,
Micah. 3.4.
Then shall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them; he will even
hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in
their doings. S. Mat. 7.1, 2.
"Judge not, says our Blessed Savior, that ye be not judged: for with what
judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall
be measured to you again. And in the foregoing Chapter, chapter 6.14, 15.
If ye forgive men their trespasses, Compare this with Ecclus 28.1, 2, 3, 4. He
that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord. -- He shows no mercy to a
man which is like himself, and does he ask forgiveness of his own sins?
your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their
trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your trespasses. To which
purpose you may peruse at leisure that excellent Parable of the Lords recalling
his Pardon upon the Servants severity toward his Fellow Servants, S. Mat. 18.
But instead of many Texts, I may well refer you to that general Admonition of
S. Paul to his Galatians, Gal. 6.7.
Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he
also reap. It Is a frequent Proverb among all Nations: Cicero has it in his
second Book de Oratore; Prout sementem feceris, ita and metes; Men shall reap
for quantity and quality as they have sown, of the same kind, and in the same
measure. Job 4.8.
They that plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap the same, says Eliphaz: Prove.
11.18.
"But to him that sows righteousness, says Solomon, shall be a sure reward.
2 Cor. 9.6.
"He which sows sparingly shall reap sparingly, and he which sows
bountifully shall reap bountifully, says the Apostle. It Is very remarkable
that S. James having mentioned the Royal Law, Thou shall love thy Neighbor as
thy self, as comprehensive of all particular Duties toward our Neighbor, thus
enforces it, So speak ye, and so do, S. Jam. 2.12, 13.
as they that shall be judged by the Law of Liberty, ( i. e. the
abovementioned Law of Christ, who has made us free, See Prove. 21.13. Blessed
are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy, S. Mat. 5. Rev. 14.13. 2 Cor.
5.10.
and the Law which is given to us as Freemen equally respecting all:) For he
shall have judgment without mercy that has showed no mercy; that is, He shall
reap as he has sown. The Works of good men are said to follow them; and, We
must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, says the Apostle, that
every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to what he has
done, whether it be good or bad. A pat Example to illustrate this, we have in
the Parable of Dives and Lazarus, S. Luke 16.19, 20, etc.
where the rich man, who denied Lazarus the crumbs of his Table, begs in vain
for a cooling drop from Lazarus his finger; and Father Abraham gives him this
then unwelcom Memento, Wherewith a man sins, by the same also shall he be
punished. Wisd. 11.16.
Son remember that thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things, and
Lazarus likewise evil things: but now (the Tide is turned) "he is comforted,
and thou art tormented.

Nothing but an hearty and Evangelical Repentance can interpose between us and
the due recompense of our sins: (...).
nothing, I say, but that Gospel-Repentance, which may engage the Mercy and
Grace of God to mitigate the rigor of his Justice for us, by pleading the
Merits of a dying Savior as abundant satisfaction.

We are then to do the same things to others, which upon substantial and
Scripture grounds we hope to receive our selves: And if we do otherwise, Quam
temere in nobis legem sancimus iniquam! Horat.
How rashly and unadvisedly do we our selves make a Law to punish our selves,
and prepare Scourges for our own Backs?

These now I conceive to be the chief Grounds which the Equity of the Principle
before us is supported by, in so much as,

(1.) We stand upon so equal terms by Nature and Grace with each other: And,

(2.) It Is very possible for us to change Relations and Conditions with others:
And,

(3.) We have all the reason in the World to expect and look for the same
measure we mete unto others, to be paid home in our own Coin.

We should therefore do unto others in all things even so as we would desire
our selves to be dealt withal.

SECT. VII.
THat which now remains, is by retail to give in the chief Particulars that are
comprised under this General Rule, Dolus latet in universalibus.
Generalia non punguut.
the better to reduce it into practice: For it is as a Fountain from whence our
particular Duties toward our Neighbors, Epictetus notes it as the cause of
all evils unto men, (...), not to skill the adapting of common and general
Notions to particular cases. Epictet. Enchirid.
as so many Streams, are derived; or as a common Root, from whence, as so many
Branches, they naturally sprout forth.

The Principal Heads I shall here discourse upon are these seven.

(1.) This Rule obliges us to all sincerity, uprightness, and integrity of
behavior each to other.

(2.) To unplume and divest our selves of pride, arrogance, and haughtiness,
and to be clothed with humility.

(3.) To an universal innocence and harmlesness.

(4.) In case of offense committed, or wrong and injury done, to make
restitution or amends.

(5.) To a respective obedience, submission, and reverence to our Superiors and
Governors.

(6.) To all the positive acts of Justice: And,

(7.) To all the dispositions and Practices of Love and Charity.

In all which Points now I shall only be as a Remembrancer to the Reader's
Conscience, in what that naturally speaks and suggests unto him.

First then, I say, this Rule challenges from us all uprightness, sincerity,
and integrity in our behavior and dealings. S. Augustine well refers it ad
simplicitatem cordis, Cit. in Catena D. Thomae super Evang.
to singleness of heart; for, as he adds, nemo velit quenquam duplici cord
secum agere, there is none that would have another deal with a double heart
toward himself. We are all for sincerity in other men's dealings and converse
with our selves. The Hypocrite is a Creature hateful not only to God but Man;
so that he spoke the general sense of Mankind, who said, (...), Homer. I^^.

(...).
That he hated him like Hell, who spoke one thing and did another. Smooth
speeches, demure looks, humble gestures and courtships, are not Oratory
sufficient to procure our love and liking unto any, whom we know thereby only
to serve his own ends upon us, and seek our ruin and mischief.

Who would welcome a treacherous Judas, though approaching with an Hail Master,
and kissing him? Who would welcome a dissembling Joab, speaking friendly on
purpose that he may smite the more unsuspectedly under the fifth rib? Every one
detests and abominates a known Liar and Hypocrite: He that works deceit,
says David, Psalm. 101.7.
shall not dwell in my house: he that tells lies shall not tarry in my sight.
Agreeable whereto was the practice of Constantius the Father of Constantine the
Great. Lib. 1. de vita. Constable c. 16.
Eusebius relates it with a memorable Preface; (...). The story this:
Constantius, though himself no Christian, propounded this Experiment among his
Courtiers and Judges, That if they would sacrifice to Idols, they should abide
in his Palace, and enjoy their Honors and Preferments: but if they refused,
they should be excluded and banished from his Presence and Employment. His
Court hereupon was divided, some rather choosing to forsake all than to
sacrifice unto Idols; others preferring their Offices and Honors before their
Christianity. But he in the issue having made the discovery which he chiefly
aimed at, commended the sincere and resolute Christians, but condemned the
hypocritical, as persons unworthy and unfit to be admitted by him unto a place
of Honor and Trust, who would be so unfaithful to their God: For how, says
he, will they be ever faithful to their Prince, (...); Eusebius. ibid.
who have been found so persidious and unconstant to their God, whom they ought
to esteem much better and above their Prince?

Of these Hypocrites therefore he cleared his Court, and advanced the other
Confessors to places of the highest consequence. There is no gilding or varnish
which can make treacherousness and perfidiousness appear lovely. Now it is easy
to infer hence, that we should not be that in this particular unto others,
which we can by no means approve they should be to us. Romans 12.9. (...).
Let love be without dissimulation, says S. Paul: And S. Peter to the same
purpose, Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth, 1 S. Pet.
1.22. (...).
through the Spirit, unto unfeigned love of the Brethren; see that ye love one
another with a pure heart fervently, or durably.

That which is counterfeit is not at all valuable; nay, when once it appears
(as Cheats seldom deceive long, Shows and Colors will wear off, Lies are but
for a short continuance) most detestable and odious.

The love we bear to our selves is uncounterfeit and sincere; such therefore
should be that we bear to others. We do unfeignedly prosecute our own interest
and concerns; so therefore should we do other men's. That was the commendation
S. Paul gave Timothy, in his Epistle to the Philippians; Phil. 2.20, 21.
I have no man like-minded, says he, who will naturally care for your state;
for all seek their own, none the things that are Christ's. They seek their own
heartily and sincerely, the things of Christ and Christians in pretense and
show only: but good men, such as Timothy was, do naturally care for the
concerns of Christ's Members, as for their own; (...), genuinely, and without
dissimulation.

True indeed, men do sometimes, through their folly, and ignorance, and
depraved affections, flatter and deceive themselves, impose upon and delude
themselves: but who would do so upon design, and wittingly? who consonantly and
agreeably to the Principle of Self-love? -- We desire others should be to us
really what they seem to be; so therefore should we our selves be to others.

This sincerity I am speaking of, is not so much any single Virtue, as the
groundwork and life of all, without which they are not that they are taken
for. Counterfeit Gold is not Gold: Counterfeit Pearl is not Pearl. In like
manner, counterfeit Goodness is not Goodness: but Vice becomes the more
vicious, by hiding of her self under the garment of Piety. Simulata sanctitas
duplex iniquitas.

We have no love to our Neighbor at all, if it be not sincere: yea, says
Solomon, He that hates, Prove. 26.24, 25, 26, 28.
dissembleth with his lips, and lays up deceit within him: when he speaks
fair, believe him not; for there are seven abominations in his heart. Whose
hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be showed before the whole
Congregation. A lying tongue hates those that are afflicted by it, and a
flattering mouth works ruin.

Salvian gives us this pertinent description of false Friends and dissembling
Mourners, Ad Eccles. Cathol. l. 3.
that often surround the Beds of dying Persons, waiting like Eagles for a
Carcass to prey upon. Thou see, says he, their forced Tears, their
counterfeit Sighs, their feigned Trouble, not inwardly desiring thy recovery,
but expecting when thou will be gone: Vide defixos in te and quasi accusantes
tui obitus tarditatem omnium vultus; See all their Countenances fixed upon
thee, and accusing, as it were, the slowness of thy departure: Non te sed
patrimonium tuum diligunt; It Is not thee, but thine Inheritance which they
love. And therefore he cautions us well against the flatteries and
blandishments of such: Gladii sunt, jugulatores tui, and quidem ferreis atque
hostilibus gladiis tetriores; They are, says he, killing swords, and worse by
far than the iron weapons of Enemies: For these are open, and seen by every
one; but unwary ones see not the other: These being seen are more easily
avoided; but the other slay by their treacherous secrecy: These none are
willing to be hurt by; but many are ambitious of the other, loving to be
flattered: These whoever is assaulted with, suffers both fear and grief; the
other kill men with delight, and do in a manner tickle them to death; They die,
as it is said of some, laughing.

But most certain it is, That all deceit and flattery and hypocrisy would soon
vanish out of the world, did men observe this Golden Rule, to do to others as
they should choose to be done by; did they once love their Neighbor as
themselves.

Secondly, The same Rule reads us a Lecture of Humility, and gives a fair
occasion to declaim against Pride and Arrogance: For who is there that allows
and approves of the proud man's carriage toward himself? Who is there to whom
high looks, insolent answers, contemptuous neglects, a lofty and scornful
carriage in other men, are not burthensom and grievous? Who is there to whom
the humanity, courtesy, and respect of the humble, is not grateful and
acceptable? Pride is a most unsociable Vice: No man cares for bearing the proud
man company. He must set Laws to all he converseth with: He must be pleased,
and observed, and humoured, or it is impossible to preserve quiet; and no man
loves to be confined to so much observance. He can be content to abuse and
deride others, to make a mock and jest of them; but will not endure the least
reflection upon himself. He will contradict every one, but none may gainsay
him: And if any cross or offend him, he becomes inexorable; nothing will
suffice but revenge, and that in the highest degree: A word misplaced shall
forfeit the man's life. Pride is made up of self-admiration, and despising or
disdaining of others; an overweening esteem of a man's own excellency, and a
supercilious undervaluing of others: And both these dispositions are at great
odds with that temper which is fitted for comfortable and delightful Society
with other men. So far is every one in love with himself, that he cannot endure
to be trodden under foot, nor will he patiently suffer another to insult over
him. It Is irksom unto every body to converse with such who are continually
boasting of themselves, and disparaging or detracting from others: Terent.
Qui nisi quod ipsi faciunt nihil rectum putant, who like nothing but what they
do themselves, and are continually blaming or finding fault with other men.

The proudest man that lives is yet a professed enemy to his Brother Pride,
treads on Pride with greater pride, and cannot endure his darling and beloved
sin in another. Vide Casaub. ad Theoph. Charact. p. 353.
Pride, I find, was a vice of so odious and ignominious a name of old, that
Tarquin for many Vices together received the Title of Superbus, as
comprehensive of all; Tarquin the Proud. This was their execratio postrema, the
greatest Curse they could load his Memory with. Hominem, libidine praecipitem,
avaritia caecum, immanem crudelitate, fruore vaecordem, vocaverunt Superbum,
and putaverunt sufficere convitium: They called him Proud, and thought this a
Reproach big enough to take in his other ill qualities of notorious Lust, and
Avarice, and Cruelty, and Rage. We Christians have not a word including more of
malignity in it, than that of Devil; and yet Pride, we know, made him such,
transformed him, of an Angel of Light, into a Devil: So S. Chrysostom speaks;
Homil. quomodo fratrum peccata reprehend.
(...).

How many, nevertheless, be there herein ambitious of the Devils Likeness and
Image? There is a Generation, Prove. 30.13.
O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up: They seem to
forget the dust out of which they were raised, and into which they must return:
They forget that they are Members of a Community with others, and that other
men are of the same kind and make with themselves: They are apt to reckon
themselves made on purpose to domineer over others, and others made on purpose
to be their Slaves and Vassals: They dote on themselves as Gods, and are angry
at every one that will not fall down and worship them: If there be a Mordecai
in the Gates, that will not bow and do humble reverence, he shall be devoted to
the Gallows, and his Kindred to destruction. If the poor and mean man have a
Request to prefer, he must wait all opportunities, from time to time dance
attendance, and at length, it may be, be discountenanced with a surly look, or
peevish reply, or receive possibly his own just Dues with a Curse and Rebuke,
if not a Blow, for being so saucy and presumptuous as to seek the maintenance
of his Charge and Family, from those who have rioted with his Moneys. Let such
men think of themselves as they please, we must needs resolve with Solomon,
That Proud and haughty Scorner is his name, Prove. 21.24.
who deals in proud wrath, or the wrath of Pride. -- But what a blessed
Reformation would the Rule I am upon introduce in this point? How soon would
humility, meekness, friendliness, affability, humanity, take the room of pride,
and haughtiness, and moroseness, those most unsociable dispositions? Men would
respect the Dignities of Humane Nature and Divine Grace in the meanest: Nothing
would be done through strife or vain glory, Phil. 2.3.
but in lowliness of mind men would esteem others better than themselves: They
would live and love together as Brethren, being pitiful and courteous. 1 S.
Pet. 3.8.
There is not a more obliging quality than this in the world. We all desire
others should approve themselves humble, and lowly, and respective in their
words, and actions, and gestures toward our selves; and therefore we are
engaged to divest our selves of arrogance, to put off pride and insolence
toward others, to be "clothed with humility, 1 S. Pet. 5.5.
and wear it as our Badge, by which we may be known; for so the Apostle's word
(...) is thought to import: Nothing certainly more becomes us, as Men, or
Christians, than this Garb.

This inclination is so much and so commonly taken notice of in men, viz. a
love and desire to be respected, that the best Politicians are wont to make
their advantage of it, gaining upon the affections of the People by crouching,
and humbling themselves in their deportments to them. And Rehoboam the Son of
Solomon lost ten Tribes irrecoverably, by his neglect of this piece of Policy:
He hearned not to the advice of the Old men, who spoke to him, saying, If thou will be a servant to this people this day, 1 Kings 12.6, 7, etc.
and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words unto them, then
they will be thy Servants for ever. But he closed with the rash and heady
Counsel of the Young men that grew up with him, who spoke unto him, saying,
Thus shall thou speak unto this People, who spoke unto thee, saying, Thy father
made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter to us; thus shall thou say unto
them, My little finger shall be thicker than my fathers loins; and now whereas
my father did lade you with an heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: My father
has chastened you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

This Counsel now took with him, and he answered the people roughly after this
fashion: Whereupon the incensed people, headed by Jeroboam, make a revolt from
him, and rebellion against him, saying, What portion have we in David? neither
have we inheritance in the Son Jesse: To your tents, O Israel. Now see to thine
house, David. Had this King listened to the aged, whose passions were tamer, and
their judgments better instructed by long observation; or had he duly weighed
his Fathers Maxim, Prove. 15.1.
A soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up strife: Had he
condescended a little to these discontented people; had he showed himself
humble and courteous, and relieved at least their heavy burdens and grievances
with mild and gentle words; he had prevented this Revolt: But his rough Answers
raised those Winds and Tempests, which all his Power could never after charm
down or allay again. So deeply is that Principle rooted in men, they cannot
endure to be slighted, and trampled on with the foot of Pride. That Traitor
Jeroboam took hold of this advantage of disgust given by the King to the
People, and easily tempted them by his smoother Promises into an open and
unappeasable Mutiny and Rebellion; in like manner, we may presume, 2 Samuel 15.1,
2, 3, etc.
as Absalom insinuated himself into the Peoples favor, by courteous speeches,
and salutations, and flatteries, complaints of others misgovernment and abuses,
and declarations of what relief he would afford them were he but once in power:
O, says he, that I were made Judge in the Land, that every man which has any
suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him Justice! And it was so,
that when any man came nigh him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand and
took him and kissed him. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
Psalm. 10.10.
"He crouch- and humbles himself, as the Psalmist speaks, that the poor may
fall by his strong ones. The like Observations to which have occasioned our
Proverb, Full of Courtesy, full of Craft: and we have seen enough of this kind
of Practice, with the Effects of it, in the Demagogues and Popular Orators of
later Times, who have scorned no servile fawnings in order to the compassing of
their own Designs.

But my aim is not here to countenance the Arts of Flattery and Craft, Words
smoother than butter, Psalm. 55.21.
and softer than Oil, whilst War is in the heart: No, these are already
banished by the former Particular, which required all sincerity, uprightness,
and integrity in our behavior toward others. I have given these Instances
only to show how much people are in love with Humility in the carriage of
others toward themselves, since the very shadows and resemblances of it have
been of so noted influence; and how much, on the other side, they hate Pride
and Insolency in others to themselves, since a few rough and harsh words and
answers have been able to effect so much mischief. So that if we will deal with
others as we desire they should deal with us, it is certain, we shall learn from
hence the Practice of Humility.

SECT. VIII.
THirdly, This Rule trains us up to an universal Innocence, that we do wrong to
no man, but in the Language of the Apostle, Phil. 2.15.
Be blameless and harmless, the Sons of God without rebuke, though in the midst
of a crooked and perverse Generation.

Now wrong we may do to others either in their Persons, or Relations, or
Possessions, or Good Names and Reputation; and in reference to each of these we
are taught Innocence: that Innocence, or Negative Justice, Pythagorean Justice,
which, as Hierocles Hierocl.
defines it, consists (...). In abstaining from what is another, and not
hurting of another, nor raising ones own Profit and Gains from another Misery
and Calamities.

First, We must not wrong or injure the Person of our Neighbor, because we
would not that any other should wrong or injure ours. Now a Man's Person, you
know, consists of these two parts, Soul and Body; in either of which he is
capable of receiving wrong and injury: and therefore, in reference unto both,
we are obliged by this Rule before us, to preserve and maintain Innocence.

(1.) Then we may not wrong and injure the Soul of another: And that we do
aither in the natural sense, as often as we grieve and offend another mind,
occasion the trouble of his thoughts, and the disquiet and discomposure of his
spirit, that sorrow of heart, whereby, as Solomon speaks, Prove. 15.13.
the spirit is broken; or in the spiritual sense, as often as we make others to
sin, whereby they wrong their own Souls in the highest degree, and hazard their
eternal loss and punishment.

We must not, where we may avoid it, vex and disturb the mind of our Neighbor,
give our selves to cross and displease others; for we would not that others
should do so to us. Thus to do, is an apparent wrong and injury; for when once
the mind is broken with grief, and vexed with disquiet, the man is exposed to
great temptations, and unfitted for the cheerful serving of God, or enjoyment
of himself. It Is a chief part of our happiness to be at ease within our selves,
contented and pleased in our own minds, tranquil and calm in our thoughts; and
this we rob another of by wilful offenses. It Is a devilish piece of malice and
spite, of which we can give no tolerable account, to delight our selves in the
affliction and trouble of another Soul. We are not willing others should
provoke us, we should not therefore, as the Apostle speaks, "provoke one
another. Gal. 5.26.


But the chiefest sort of Offenses is, when we cause others to sin: This is
that scandal which the Holy Scripture denounces so heavy and severe a Woe
against the Authors of; Woe be to that man by whom such offenses come! Sin is
indeed the greatest injury of the Soul, the disease and the death of the Soul;
the spiritual death and torment of that, which can never undergo a natural
death or destruction; the eternal undoing of that, which can never cease to be.
It Is sin only which separates the Soul from God the Fountain of Life and
Happiness: It Is sin only which breeds the Worm that dies not, and kindles the
Fire which cannot be quenched: And therefore the greatest hatred we can show to
another, is to be a means either of his committing sin, or continuing in it
unrepented of, as I noted also before from Leviticus 19.17.

True it is, in propriety of speech we cannot make another man to sin, we
cannot force any man to sin. Sin, as it is the greatest wrong unto the Soul, so
it is also at the sinners choice, whether he will admit of it or no. Voluntas
non cogitur: And so in this case, Nemo laeditur nisi a seipso. Every sinner
stands accountable for the injury he does himself.

But yet we may be capable of doing very much toward the determining of his
choice, toward the tempting of him into sin, or the encouraging of him in it:
And whenever we do that willingly, upon the occasion whereof our Neighbor is
drawn and moved to consent unto sin, or continue in it, we are so far guilty of
his sin: We bring the guilt of another sin, and of the wrong redounding to him
by it, so far upon our selves, as we are Authors or Accessaries; for here, as
in case of High Treason, both Principal and Accessory are deemed alike guilty.
Now many are the ways Divines reckon up, whereby we may become accessory to the
sins of others, reputed authors and occasions of their sins.

If we are Superiors in Authority over them, by commanding them to sin; by
"decreeing of unrighteous Decrees, Isa. 10.1.
in the language of the Prophet Isaiah. Thus was Nebuchadnezzar guilty of the
Peoples Idolatry, Dan. 3.4, 5, 6.
by commanding that a Golden Image should be set up, and that all at the sound
of a Trumpet should fall down and worship it. 1 Samuel 22.18.
Thus was Saul guilty of killing the Priests, whom Doeg slew at his command. 3
Sam. 11.15.12.9.
Thus David of Vriah's death, by commanding Joab on purpose to put him in the
front of the Battle. Or else by toleration, permission, or connivence at others
sins, not restraining of them when we may. 1 Samuel 3.
Thus Eli became guilty of his Sons wickedness, because he restrained them not:
And the wicked Kings we read of in the Old Testament, of the Peoples Idolatry,
who destroyed not their High Places, those Nests of their Idols.

But all men may become partakers, instruments, and means of others sins, by
counselling, advising, provoking, urging, persuading, alluring, or enticing
them to sin; by assisting and helping them in their sins; by giving their
consent and furtherance; by going before them with a bad example; by undue
silence, and not reproving men for sin, as we have opportunity; by commending
and pleading for their sin; by justifying of, or flattering them up in their
sin; by bringing up an evil report on the ways of Religion, and affrighting
others from Goodness and Virtue, by threats or reproaches.

I should be over-large in giving you particular Instances of all those Heads
and Methods whereby directly or indirectly we may become the causes of other
men's sins, of their profaneness and irreligion, of their drunkenness and
uncleanness, of their Sacrilege and Idolatry, of their Schism and Disorder,
etc. of all those sins whereby our Neighbors Soul, as well as our own, may be
eternally ruined.

Yet how often, alas! do men offer this greatest of wrongs and injuries to
others, under pretense of Good-fellowship, Love, and Kindness?

Nor will it boot any here to allege, that they are willing others should do
as much by them. I have before prevented this Exception; and they have
certainly neither a right Judgment, nor a regular Will, nor any true love for
themselves, who profess themselves willing to sin, and unwilling to leave sin,
i. e. willing to damn themselves.

(2.) We may not wrong or injure the Body of our Neighbor; viz. either by
Stripes or Wounds maiming of it, or hurting of its Senses; by drawing men to
such courses as are prejudicial to their Health and Strength; and in the
highest degree of all, by Murder, that crying sin of dispatching our Neighbor
by violent hands our selves, or the employment of bloody Assassinates, or some
more secret means and conveyances. Now in all these cases we may take a true
and impartial estimate of the wrong and injury accruing to another, by
supposing our selves in his place, rank, and condition. We are here capable, to
be sure, of judging uncorruptly; for we seldom fail in loving of our Bodies, or
in valuing the injuries inflicted upon them. What a rate do we set upon our
bodily health and ease? upon any of our Limbs and Senses? How much are we
readily willing to part with, either to secure or to recover them? But then we
stake all to save our Lives: Skin for skin, Job 2.4.
yea all that a man has will he give for his life. -- Who is there willing to
be put to pain himself? to lose an Eye, an Hand, a Leg, etc. himself? to be
mangled or murdered himself? And therefore in all these and the like cases, we
have a Principle within us rebuking us for the wrongs of this nature which we
offer to our Neighbor, and telling us plainly, that we ought not so to do.

Secondly, We are farther instructed hence, not to wrong or injure another in
his near Relations, which are indeed a part of himself; suppose the Husband or
Wife of another, and the Children of another.

Apparent wrong and injury is done to the Husband or Wife of another by
Adultery, bringing of them thereby to the guilt of that horrid sin of Perjury,
and breach of their Marriage Vow and Covenant; taking away that which Husband
or Wife concerned do or should esteem most precious, viz. the Love and
Faithfulness of each other; and it may be robbing of the right Heirs of their
due by a Bastard and unlawful Brood, the Children of the Adulterer or
Adulteress, besides many other inconveniences.

Nor will it here excuse the adulterous Wife, that possibly her Husband might
be consenting; or the adulterous Husband, that his Wife possibly might yield
thereto, and so they do no more than they are willing to suffer: for in this
case their Wills are irregular: This their willing speaks their corruption the
more, but the wrong and injury no whit the less. No man disposed as he should
be, is willing that another should wrong him in assaulting the Chastity of his
Wife: no man rherefore should attempt another in that kind. No Woman disposed
as she should be, is willing that another should draw aside her Husband to
unlawful Embraces; and therefore she should not entice or allure or admit of
the Husband of another.

Next, as to the Children of others, I will instance in two Particulars.

The former respects those who have the care and charge of the Nursing and
Education of Children committed to them; they are to take great heed that they
wrong not those committed to their care, by denying or withholding from them
any thing fit or convenient, Food or Lodging, Instruction, Correction, or
Encouragement; by negligence or indiscretion. These should ask themselves what
care and conscience they would desire and expect in others toward their own
Issue? and so deal with the Children of others left to them. Believe it, it is a
great and considerable wrong, that is often done both to Children, and Parents
in those Children, by the ignorance, or sloth, or baseness and dishonesty of
Nurses, Guardians, Schoolmasters, and others that overlook them in their
Infancy and younger years, who are concerned in their Education, and the
forming of their Minds and Manners, or training them up to some Trade and way
of Life.

The later shall be of the Children of others grown up, and ripe for Marriage;
I mean, the stealing or forcing away of such, without the privity and consent
of their Parents. Musculus in his Comment upon S. Matthew's Gospel makes this
very application of the Rule: It Is, says he, Muscul. in S. Mat. c. 7. 12.
disputed sometimes about clandestine and stolen Marriages, such, to wit, as are
made without the knowledge and against the will of Parents, whether they be
just and valid; and here some demand a clear word of God, whereby they are
forbidden, and that out of the New Testament: for neither the Law of Moses, nor
the Law of Caesar will satisfy them. Now therefore, for their resolution,
interrogent illi seipsos, number velint sibi tale quid fieri; Let them ask
themselves impartially, whether they would have any such thing done to
themselves; whether they are willing their own Daughter should be fraudulently,
and against their liking, taken away by one whom they would by no means admit
of for their Son-in-Law: Certe nequaquam hoc volunt; Assuredly, says he, they
would in no wise. Why therefore do they not see, according to our Saviors
Rule, that it is unlawful for them to do so to others? Why do they not see that
here is a Word of the Lord, a Law of the Lord, the sum to wit of the Law and
Prophets, whereby such a thing is forbidden? Is not this plain Scripture? Is
not this the Word of God, which Christ here avoucheth to be the Law and the
Prophets, That we should do unto others as we would our selves in a like case
be dealt with?

Thirdly, By the same Rule we must not wrong or injure our Neighbor in his
Goods and Possessions, either openly by force, or covertly by fraud, being our
selves unwilling to be so served. We should neither rob nor defraud our
Neighbor, Levit. 19.13.
if we observed this Precept. We all censure this wickedness in other men: we
say to our Neighbor, "Thou shall not steal; and give the name of Thief as an
Epithet of reproach. Nathan therefore took this wise course with King David, to
make him in the issue accuse, condemn, and sentence himself in the person of
another, whose case he had first propounded in a Parable: 2 Samuel 12.1, 2, 3,
etc.
There were two men, says he, in one City, the one rich, and the other poor;
the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds, but the poor man had nothing
save a little Ew-lamb, which he had bought and nourished up, and it grew up
together with him and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drink
of his own cup, and lie in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter: And there
came a Traveller to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of
his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come to him, but took the
poor man's Lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him: Whereupon,
says the Text, David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said
unto Nathan, As the Lord lives, the man that has done this thing is worthy to
die, and he shall restore the Lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and
because he had no pity. Now after this, Nathan needed no more to satisfy and
convince David of the wrong done in taking the Wife of Vriah, than to wish him
to suppose the case he had already judged his own: "Thou art the man, says he,
-- mutato nomine, Horat.
de te Fabula narratur. -- And David readily acknowledges upon it, "I have
sinned against the Lord. There cannot be a more effectual course to make a true
estimate of the evil of those wrongs we do at any time to others, than thus to
consider of the case as represented to us in a Parable of other men, that we
may in the issue and result apply the same Sentence unto our selves, which we
should readily pronounce upon a like offender.

It Is plain and evident, that those malicious spirits, who delight in mischief
and spite, who give themselves to the prejudicing of their Neighbors without
any regard to their own benefit, nay, and sometimes to their own damage also,
act not by this Rule I am speaking of. He that lets his Cattle into his
Neighbors Field of Corn, to spoil it, by devouring or trampling of it; He that
sets fire to his Neighbor's House or Barn; He that wilfully hurts his
Neighbors Beasts or Goods, is yet unwilling that another should do so by him.
Did men act as they would choose for themselves, all these malicious wrongs, to
be sure, would cease, yea, and all the oppressions, and cozenage, and
usurpations, and extortions in the World, which men are tempted to, in order,
as they imagine, to some private gain. 1 Kings 21.
Honest Naboth might have kept his Vineyard and Life together, had his
neighboring Prince Ahab, or Jezebel his Queen, dealt thus with him. Abraham's
Servants might have kept their Masters Well, Genesis 21.25.
which was violently taken from them, had the Servants of Abimelech walked by
this Law toward them. There would be no room left for such complaints and
charges as frequently abound in the Writings of the Prophets: Isa. 1.23.
Thy Princes are companions of thieves: every one loves gifts and follows
after rewards; they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the
Widow come before them. Isa. 3.14, 15.
-- "The Lord will enter into judgment with the Ancients of his People, and the
Princes thereof, (such as he had before spoken of) for ye have eaten up the
Vineyard, and the spoil of the Poor is in your Houses. What mean ye that ye
beat my People to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor, says the Lord God
of Hosts? And again, chapter 5.7, 8.
The Lord looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but
behold a cry. Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field,
till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the
earth! i. e. Who care not what desolations they make, or how many they ruin,
so they may raise themselves. To the same purpose another Prophet; Ezekiel. 22.27,
28, 29.
Her Princes in the midst thereof are like Wolves ravening the Prey, to shed
blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain; and her Prophets have
daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them;
and the people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and
have vexed the poor and needy; yea, they have oppressed the stranger
wrongfully. -- And another Prophet; Mich. 3.1, 2, 3.
Hear I pray you, O Heads of Jacob, and ye Princes of the House of Israel; Is
it not for you to know Judgment? who hate the good, and love the evil; who
pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones: who
also eat the flesh of my People, and flay their skin from off them, and they
break their bones, and chop them in pieces as for the pot, and as flesh within
the Cauldron. And another, Her Princes within her are roaring Lions; Zeph. 3.3.
her Judges are evening Wolves (waiting for, and greedily catching at and
devouring of their prey) they gnaw not the bones till the morrow: i. e. Their
only mercy is, that they devour not all at once, that they make not a full and
utter consumption of them, that they swallow not flesh and bones together. And
yet another; Ye who turn Judgment into Wormwood, Amos 5.7.
and leave off Righteousness in the earth. 6.12.
And again; "Ye have turned Judgment into gall, and the fruit of Righteousness
into hemlock: that is, as I conceive, the Law, which should have been the
remedy of injustice and wrong, a comfort and relief to the oppressed, into the
greatest instrument of bitterness, of doing them wrong and injury. -- But this
Rule would leave no more room for these and the like complaints: There would be
ground no longer for the taunting Proverb mentioned by Habakkuk, Hab. 2.6.
He increases that which is not his: Congregat non sua: He gathers from his
Neighbors heaps. None would invade another property by usurpation: None would
exact beyond right and due, by color of their Places and Offices: None would
take advantage of their Neighbors present necessities, to pinch and undo them
by a griping Usury: The Traveller might pass securely on the Highway, without
fear of Robbers: The Merchant might fail securely on the Seas, without dread of
Pirates: Every one might sleep securely at his own home, without dreaming of
Thieves: The laborious Tenant would no more be ruined by over-rack'd Rents
under an unreasonable Landlord: The Poor would be no more cheated by their rich
and potent Neighbors, removing the ancient Landmarks, enclosing their Common
from them, and excluding them from their right and due: Tradesmen would no more
be bankrupt by the Engrossers of Monopolies: We should hear no more of
Sycophantizing Publicans, S. Luke 19.8.
who drive a trade of Injuries, and under the cloak of Public Authority and
Commission, enrich their private Coffers with the spoil of the Needy: We should
hear no more of those who falsify the Balances by deceit, Amos 8.5, 6.
that they may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, yea,
and sell the refuse of wheat: -- i. e. who raise their own Estates purely out
of the necessities and miseries of others: The Shopkeeper would cast away his
diverse Weights and Measures, and no longer vend his corrupted Wares for sound,
or take an unconscionable Rate for the Buyers ignorance and simplicity: No man
would go beyond, 1 These. 4.6.
or defraud his Brother in any matter: The common Instrument of Merchandise and
Traffic, our Coin and Money, would be no more corrupted by Counterfeits and
Clippers, to the general prejudice: The painful Labourer would not famish for
want of his Hire, withholden by those from whom it is due; nor any be cast in
Prison themselves for Debt, whilst others withhold that unjustly from them
which would enable them to pay: We might safely commit our richest Treasure,
even untold Gold, as we speak, to the custody of any Neighbor, without a
jealousy of the hazard or impairing of it: There would be none to steal and
pilfer, nor any Receivers of Goods known to be stolen: for in this case, The
Receiver (as we say) is as bad as the Thief, and is also a Thief; to hold the
Sack, and to fill it, being, a like crime: There would be no Family pestered
with domestici fures, false and unfaithful Servants, who purloin and waste
their Masters Goods, turning them to their own, in stead of their Masters gain;
or those Sons of sloth and idleness, who, as Solomon notes, "are brethren unto
great wasters: Prove. 18.9.
The Goods of the Church would be secure from Sacrilege; the Parsons Tithes,
from stealth or plunder; and every man's Estate from being diminished by craft
or power: The poor and rich, the weak and mighty, the ignorant and learned,
might dwell together at case and quiet, without the least suspicion of a wrong
or injury from each other.

SECT. IX.
FOurthly, The same Rule engages us not to wrong or injure another in his Good
Name and Reputation; for that we value above all worldly Treasure: It Is better,
says Solomon, Eccles. 7.1. Prove. 22.1.
than precious Ointment, and rather to be chosen than great Riches. What will
not men venture on for the sake of Fame, and Glory, and Reputation? How highly
do they resent whatever seems to entrench upon their Honor? And who would
willingly forfeit the good thoughts and opinions of others, the good words and
reports of others, the favor and friendship of others, the repute of his Place
and Dignity?

A man's Credit and Good Name is eminently valuable upon this account among
others, because it is the chiefest means of his doing good in the World. None
much cares for that which comes from one of an ill Name: His counsel and advice
is not regarded, his checks and reproofs little heeded. It Is no mean prejudice
therefore, to those especially who are in any Public Office of Trust or
Authority, to have their Good Names bespattered or taken from them. And if once
we esteemed of our Neighbors Credit as of our own, we should be extremely wary
of detracting from his Reputation, by any of those ways of defamation which are
too ordinary in the World.

1. We should not bear false witness against him, if called thereunto. A man
that bears false witness against his neighbor, says Solomon, Prove. 25.18.
is a Maul, and a Sword, and a sharp Arrow: i. e. He does him as much mischief
as if he struck his Head with a Maul, wounded him with a Sword, or pierced his
Heart with a sharp Arrow. Whom would it not grieve to have his Good Name, and
Life, it may be, with it, taken from him by a suborned or malicious
False-witness?

2. We should not slander and backbite our absent Neighbor by false
accusations and detractions: That is the familiar practice of too many, who are
(as Plautus his Phrase is) mures nominis alieni, as Mice to other men's Good
Names, who do corrodere famam alienam, nibble continually at, and take away
from the Reputation of others. Sometimes they do this out of ill will and
revenge, sometimes out of envy, sometimes out of ambition to appear themselves
more beautiful, by representing others as deformed; sometimes out of vanity. At
some times you shall have them publishing the private and secret faults of
others, amplifying and aggravating of them with many a black circumstance; and
not contented, it may be, with doing once so, repeating the matter, and going
over again and again with it. Sometimes they will do the feat more
undiscernedly, by Libels; which are not unfitly defined to be Lies with Bells
added to them to ring them up and down the Country. Lord Verulam.
Sometimes they will preface the matter with some shows of sorrow, and good
affection to the Party they are speaking of; such as S. Bernard thus describes:
You may observe, says he, great sighs introducing the Relation; the man speaks
tanquam contusus and cum quadam tarditate, dimissis superciliis, voce
plangenti, -- as if he were confounded, and ashamed of the matter, and loath to
deliver it, making some stops, casting down his eyes, with a mournful tone he
tells you, Vehementer doleo, quia vehementer diligo, I am very sorry for him,
because I very much love and honor him: Et sic egreditur maledictio; so he
prepares the way for his designed Reproaches, and makes them enter the deeper
in the belief of those that hear him. Sometimes you shall have them commending
a Person with a spiteful But after it, which shall cut the throat of their
Commendation, and prove it to be nothing else but a politic cloak for their
own maliciousness. Sometimes they will have a more secret conveyance still,
which yet shall be no less effectual to their Neighbors discredit, by
whispering and tale-bearing, and insinuating evil suspicions and surmizes,
first to one and then to another, concerning him. These and the like are the
common tricks of slandering tongues, wherewith they smite and wound their
Neighbors Good Name, and thereby, as the Psalmist has it, "cut like a sharp
Razour. Psalm. 52.2.
But who would choose to be dealt with thus himself? to have all his secret
lapses and infirmities proclaimed abroad upon the house top, heightened and
aggravated to the utmost? to have many tales and forgeries spoken of him behind
his back; and the good he has at any time done undervalued, perversely
interpreted, and misrepresented?

3. We should not disgrace our Neighbors to their faces, by contumelious and
opprobrious speeches, clamorous outcries, railing accusations, querulous
expostulations before others, cruel mockings, taunts, and derisions, laughing
them to scorn, and showing that we undervalue and slight them, (whether by
words, or gestures, or actions, it matters not) as if they were fools, or
unworthy of any regard or honor from us. We cannot endure this practice in
others toward our selves.

4. We should not countenance any who make it their employment to go about with
odd reports, and rumors, and whispers, to undermine the credit of other men;
for in this case, as was intimated before, No Receivers, no Thieves. Were there
none that had itching ears to hear with delight of other men's imperfections,
faults, and miscarriages, there would be fewer reporters of them, and we our
selves, I am sure, would not like that other men should cherish and countenance
any who so injure us.

5. We should not harbor evil surmizes and suspicions of others, without cause;
much less judge rashly of them, and pronounce unadvisedly upon them, determine
of their thoughts and intentions, which we know not; construe doubtful matters
to the worst, without regard had of circumstances; or be ready and forward to
believe our selves, and hand down to others, every slanderous accusation we
have at any time heard concerning them: For we would not have other men think
evil of us without ground or reason; we would not have them judge boldly and
severely of our thoughts and intentions; we would not have them make the worst
of all our actions; we would not have them believe every flying report
concerning us; we would not have them report with confidence what they chance
to hear at any time of us, whereby our interest in others good opinions, our
Good Name and Reputation may be endamaged. We are therefore in all these cases
indispensibly obliged to preserve the same innocence toward other men.

Were this Rule practiced as it ought to be, there would be no profane Chams,
Genesis 9.
taking pleasure in the disclosing of their Fathers nakedness: There would be
no blaspheming Shimeis, railing at, 2 Samuel 16.
and cursing others to their face: There would be no traducing Hamans, Esther
3.8.
accusing others falsely behind their backs: There would be no informing Zibas,
2 Samuel 16.
to steal away the good affections and esteem of any from their truest friends,
by sinister and unworthy suggestions.: There would be no slandering Sanballats,
to disperse abroad defamatory Letters concerning the innocent: Neh. 6.6.
There would be no cursed Doegs, Psalm. 52.
whose tongue devises mischief, and loves words that may do hurt: There would
be no libelling Jehoashes, 2 Kings 14.9.
to lessen the worth and repute of others by Parables and Comparisons.

Had this Rule been observed, John the Baptist for his Abstinence had never
been censured to have a melancholy Devil within him; S. Mat. 11.19.
nor our Blessed Savior, for his eating and drinking, S. Luke 7.34.
to be a winebibber, and friend to Publicans and sinners: Act. 28.4.
S. Paul had not been thought a murderer, because the Viper cleaved to his
hands; nor yet the suffering Galileans, S. Luke 13.1.
or those on whom the Tower in Siloe fell, upon that score only sinners above
the rest.

In a word, There cannot be a better protection against the injuries of a false
or malicious Heart or Tongue, than this.

And thus now I have declared the third Particular somewhat largely, that we
are trained up by this Rule to an universal Innocence toward others, not to do
them any wrong or injury in any capacity, in their Persons, Souls, and Bodies;
in their Relations, in their Goods and Possessions, or in their Credit and Good
Name. Thus he that loves another as himself, and consequently does to another
as he would be done by himself, has fulfilled the Laws that require this
Innocence from us: For, this, says S. Paul, Romans 13.9, 10.
Thou shall not commit Adultery, Thou shall not kill, Thou shall not steal,
Thou shall not bear false witness, Thou shall not covet; and if there be any
other Commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou
shall love thy Neighbor as thy self. Love works no ill unto his Neighbor;
therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law.

Fourthly, In case of wrong and injury done unto another (as who is there that
in all points, and at all times preserves innocence?) this Rule enjoins us to
make, as we are able, Restitution or Reparation, Amends and Recompense for the
wrong and injury we have done; for so we all desire and expect that others
should do to us. Where the Party is disabled to make a real satisfaction, there
is yet a reparation due by humble and penitent confessions and acknowledgments:
but where the Restitution may be in kind or value, these alone will not
suffice. Zacheus his resolution is fit for our imitation, If I have wronged any
man by cozenage, S. Luke 19.8.
forgery, and falsehood, I will restore fourfold; at least I will restore
according to what I have wronged him of. It were not difficult to show, that
there is no true repentance without this, and consquently no forgiveness of the
wrong and injury done, to be looked for at Gods hand, according to S.
Augustine's saying, Non remittitur peccatum nisi restituatur ablatum: But the
Motive I have now to urge is, because every one looks and desires that this
restitution be made unto himself, that there be a satisfaction and amends for
the wrong and injury done him; and this satisfaction must be according to the
wrong done.

If therefore thou have wronged thy Neighbors spirit by wilful vexation and
grieving of him, thou art bound to make him the amends of an acknowledgment,
and the supplies of what comfort thou art able to administer. -- If thou have
wronged his soul by enticing him to sin, or being a means of his continuance in
sin, thou art obliged to make him reparation according to thy power, by
provoking him to repentance, and using all those good methods of inviting him
to Virtue and Goodness, which are fittest to countermine the ill methods and
arts of sinning thou have formerly prescribed him. -- If thou have prejudiced
him in his Body, or any part or member thereof, thou art obliged to make him
satisfaction according to the value of that loss he has thereby sustained. --
If thou have taken away his Goods, thou art obliged to restore them. -- If the
spoil of the Church, the Inheritance of Widows and Orphans, the Hire of
Laborers be in thine hand, thou art obliged to part with it. -- If thou have
spread false reports of thy Neighbor, thou art bound to unsay them. -- If thou
have blasted his reputation, thou art engaged to do what thou can to set him
right again in the esteem of others, etc.

He that has wronged and injured another, and makes him not some amends for
the wrong done, declares that he is still of the same disposition, and likes
and approves well enough of the wrong and injury that he has done him. He that
withholds any thing that is another from the right Owner thereof, which he had
unjustly gotten and procured from him, justifies himself in his unrighteous
usurpation and theft: and whoever does any of these things, deals not with
others as he is desirous to be dealt with.

Some injuries there are which admit not of a restitution, which cannot be
undone again: Sometimes also the Offender is utterly disabled for making any
competent and real satisfaction; and there the wrong doer stands obliged to a
supply of confessions and acknowledgments, repentance and godly sorrow.
Sometimes the person wronged is not in being, and then the restitution is due
to the Heirs of his Body and Fortunes, or, if he have none, to the common Heirs
of every good man's Charity and Abundance, the Poor, I mean, and Indigent. But
whoever he be that have wronged his Neighbor, is unquestionably engaged to
make him some amends, by the profession of his sorrow for the injury done, and
his resolutions of doing so no more, and witnessing to the reality of that good
profession by a present return of what he has unjustly taken away, and making
reparations, as he is able, for the damages another has sustained through his
injustice.

Innocence in the first place is to be preserved, and no wrong done; but in
case of a miscarriage, there lies a necessity of repentance, restitution,
compensation, and amends upon him that has done the injury: for this is that
which we every one desire from others.

SECT. X.
FIfthly, This Rule obliges us to a respective obedience and submission to all
our Superiors, because this is the temper that we like, and wish, and commend
in all that are under our selves.

Notwithstanding the great equality between us all by Nature, as we are Men,
and by Grace, as we are Christians, before spoken of; we are yet by the Will
and Providence of God, in compliance with the necessities and convenience of
Society, ranked, disposed, and ordered into several degrees and stations, some
above others. Order can never be in Families and Kingdoms, Church or State,
without Government; and Government is in vain, and impossible indeed, without
Obedience and Subjection. Now this Virtue, which is so necessary to the
well-being of the World, I am to recommend from the Rule discoursed on; and the
more effectually to do it, I will briefly run through the several sorts and
degrees of Superiority and Authority which we are by this Precept engaged in
our several places to be submissive and obedient to. And,

(1.) I begin with that which is first in Nature, the Authority of Parents over
their Children. Many are the complaints and lamentations we have heard from
Parents about the obstinacy and rebellion of their Children. Many
heartbreaking sighs, many cutting thoughts, many tears of sorrow have had this
original. The most ungracious Children themselves, when they afterward live to
become Parents, demand and expect reverence and obedience from the Fruit of
their own Loins; loath, and execrate, and punish, what in them lies, the
undutifulness and disobedience of their own Children, when they will not be
ruled by them, when they refuse their lawful Commands, resist and rebel against
their corrections, or dispose of themselves in the World without and against
their consent and liking. How many, otherwise dear enough in the estimation and
affections of their Parents, have yet upon this last account only been
abandoned and cast off in utter displeasure, so as never to be owned and
regarded more, because they took not their advice along with them, or made them
not privy to their matching in the world? I will not deny, but the extremities
and rigours of some Parents in this case may seem a little to entrench upon
Humanity; but yet these are undeniable documents that every one approves,
wishes, and looks for the obedience and submission of his Children in all
respects. Let those therefore who are Children remember their obligations unto
this obedience, dutifulness, and submission to their Parents; because, if ever
they live to be Parents, they would desire the same from their Children: Let
them be as dutiful, submissive, and obedient to their Parents now, as were they
Parents themselves, they would wish their Children should be to them. Had
thou Children thy self, thou would expect they should go and come at thy
bidding, they should observe thy beck, they should be awed with thy presence,
they should humbly ask thy Blessing, and in case of a default they should beg
thy pardon, and kiss the rod wherewith thou chastisest their folly; that whilst
they are at thy provision, they should rest contented with what Clothing,
Food, and Maintenance thou judge to be fittest for them; and when they are
entering themselves into the World, they should take thy consent and counsel
with them, in the choice of that way and course of life they design, or that
Consort they intend a Marriage with: and therefore thou art beyond dispute
concerned in these Particulars to give proof thy self of thy obedience to thy
Parents.

The undutifulness of Children toward their Parents is oftentimes requited by
God in kind by the heavy Plague of undutiful Children.

(2.) I will next instance in the Authority of Masters over their Servants.
What, I pray, is the good quality that every Master wishes and looks for in
his Servant, but Obedience? Servorum hic contemptus maximus est, Salvian, l. 2.
si non faciant quod jubetur: This is the greatest contempt Servants are
capable of, not to do what is commanded them; for the very notion of a Servant
speaks dependence upon the will and pleasure of another. Let Servants therefore
suppose themselves a while in their Masters place, and put the question home to
their own Conscience, what kind of Servants they would then wish to themselves;
and such let them be to their own Masters. This would speak out to them as
fully as the express command of the Apostle, Ephesians. 6.5, 6, 7.
Servants, be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh,
with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as unto Christ: not with
eye-service, as men-pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of
God from the heart, with good will doing service as to the Lord, and not to
men. -- For who would allow of such a Servant, the motions of whose labor, and
industry, and obedience kept pace and time only with his Masters eye; whose
duty and diligence are ruled wholly and altogether by his Masters observance,
who does not his work out of love and conscience, but fears more to be taken
idle and negligent, than to be so indeed? -- This would speak out as much as
the Exhortation S. Paul commissions Titus to give Servants, Tit. 2.9, 10.
That they be obedient to their own Masters, and please them well in all
things, not answering again, not purloining, but showing all good fidelity,
that they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Savior in all things. -- For who
is there but abominates unfaithfulness, crosness, saucy replies and answering
again in Servants; when in stead of doing their duty cheerfully and
conscionably, they parley, and mutter, and debate upon the Commands given them,
or echo back the last words of their Masters Admonitions and Reproofs, as if
they intended to fling them in his face again?

(3.) Come we next to the Authority of Princes over their Subjects, and
Magistrates over those who are under their respective Jurisdictions; where
indeed the case is so much the same as between Father and Children, Lord or
Master and Servants, that both the same Names are communicated to them, and the
same Commands interpreted of them.

Could Subjects but once impartially suppose themselves in the place of their
Princes, having a charge from God to provide for the welfare and security of
the People, and that charge clogged with many difficulties in the performance
of it, with many an interruption to their private ease and quiet, with many an
hazard of their Life and Persons, they would certainly learn to think the
Obedience of Subjects highly reasonable: and, whereas an upstart Generation
has been very eager to snatch from their Prince all manner of Power about the
ordering of Religion, they would questionless be of another mind.

Religion is the chiefest Policy in order to a Kingdoms happiness; Religion is
the chiefest means of God's Honor in the World; Nothing moves men so violently
as Religion does: Nothing therefore can do more harm and mischief than false
persuasions about Religion, false Doctrines spread abroad under the color and
pretense of Religion. How then can any Prince give account of himself to God,
whose Minister he is in the World; or how can he secure the Honor of God, and
the Interest of his People, yea the Crown upon his own Head, where the Power of
Commanding and forbidding in Matters of Religion is denied him, or taken from
him? Certainly no considering Subject would be willing to this, were he in his
Princes place. What good Parent would not take it ill to be abridged of the
Power of Religiously Educating his own Children? What good Master would not
take it ill to be restrained from this in his Family? And yet the furious
Zealot will deprive his Prince of that poor degree of Authority, which himself
is willing to usurp as a Father or Master, nay, it may be, where himself is
neither Father nor Master, in his Princes Dominions. The conscientious Rebel
(such I mean who pleads Conscience for his Obstinacy and Rebellion) labors to
salve all by the distinction of Civil and Religious Obedience: Obey his Prince
he will in Civil Matters, (though here too sometimes 'twere well if he were
more civil in his Obedience) but in the Matters of Religion, says he, what
has the Prince to do to command? Every one must follow the light of his own
Conscience. A most dangerous Principle, that tends to the undermining and
subversion of all Order in Societies. And it is very observable, that the most
eager Asserters of this universal and unbridled Liberty to Private Spirits in
Matters of Religion, whenever themselves have mounted into Authority, have
seen a plain necessity of curbing and restraining it by Laws and Power.

If then Subjects were once disposed to do to their Princes as themselves, were
they in their room and stead, would desire to be done unto, they would
questionless approve themselves most ready and dutiful, not only in Civil
Obedience, as it is called, to the expense both of their Blood and Fortunes for
the Public welfare, upon their Princes commands; but in a Religious Obedience
also, welcoming and observing the Public Orders for God's Worship and Honor,
which are not plainly contrary to some Divine Command, they would stick at the
doing nothing enjoined them, but that the doing whereof were apparently sinful,
the transgression of some known Law of God: and were the matter it self
doubtful, they would judge it equal for the weight of Public Authority to turn
the Scale; they would determine, that in such matters where they must venture
to err on the one side or on the other, 'twere best for them to take the surer
side; that side, I mean, which, besides the equality and probability of Reasons
to counterbalance such as are laid against them, has the overweight of
Authority, requiring Obedience, by virtue of God's general Command, in all
things that are not manifestly sinful: For certainly the Public Peace and
Quiet cannot be upheld and provided for with a more limiting determination.

The same Rule obliges inferior Magistrates to be as truly obedient to the
Supreme, as they expect the meanest Subject should be to them. Inferior
Magistrates stand in a double capacity, the one of Governors, the other of
Subjects. Governors they are, according to the extent of Power communicated to
them over those that are under their Charge and Jurisdiction: but Subjects they
are themselves still, in reference to the Higher Powers by whom they were sent,
and from whom they receive their Commission and Authority. It Is in an Army no
less a Crime for any Officers to oppose and disobey their General, than for
Common Soldiers to oppose and disobey their respective Officers; and it is no
less a Crime for the General himself to oppose and disobey his Prince, from
whom he has his Commission, than for any of his Officers to oppose and disobey
him: Nay, the crime of disobedience is still the higher, according to the
eminency of the Authority disobeyed and opposed. And the truth is, that which
aggravates the contempt shown to the meanest Officer in a Kingdom, is the
violation of some or other degree of Authority communicated from the highest,
though through diverse hands, unto him. There is no man but expects as much to
be obeyed himself by the Officers whom he commissions and employs, as they can
do by any over whom some measure of Authority is delegated to them. A Nobleman
justly looks for as true observance from the Steward of his Household, as he
does from the meanest Servant under him.

Were this Lesson therefore of doing as we would be done by, inwardly digested,
there would be no danger at all of the Rebellion of Subordinate Powers against
the Supreme and Sovereign, nor indeed of any Subjects against the Subordinate
Powers sent and placed by the Supreme over them.

(4.) My next instance shall be in the Authority of Priests and Ministers over
their People, Spiritual Pastors over their Flocks, the Congregations committed
to their care, inspection, and government. And here I will not meddle with that
share of Authority which is derived purely from the Supreme Magistrate to them;
wherein yet they are as dutifully to be obeyed, as any other Officers
commissioned and employed by the Prince: but with that spiritual Obedience
which is due unto them, by virtue of their spiritual Authority derived from
Christ himself. Such as that which S. Paul commends in his Corinthians toward
Titus, and which endeared Titus his affections unto them: 2 Cor. 7.15.
His inward affection, says he, is abundant toward you, whilst he remembers
the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him; viz.
out of reverence to his spiritual Function, Power, and Authority.

It Is not now an external Reverence I am pleading for, the Cap and Knee,
courteous Salutations, good words, an outwardly respectful demeanor toward
Gods Clergy. It Is usual with People to suspect such Pleas as the issue of their
Author's pride and ambition; and he is of a poor, mean, and unworthy spirit,
who sets any great value upon those trifles and formalities. Bu^ the thing I
aim at is more substantial and weighty; something without which our Office
loses much of its proper effects and success in the World; somewhat, by the
denial of which our People offend God, and wrong their own Souls, transgressing
these and the like plain Commands and Exhortations of Holy Writ; 1 These. 5.12,
13.
We beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor among you, and are over
you in the Lord, and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love for
their works sake. Hebr. 1^.17.
"Obey them which have the rule over you, and submit your selves; for they
watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with
joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you. Mal. 2.7.
"The Priests lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the Law at his
mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts. 1 Cor. 4.1.
"Let a man so account of us as of the Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the
Mysteries of God: I might add, as Ambassadors of Christ; for so the Apostle
elsewhere, 2 Cor. 5.20.
Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us,
we pray you in Christ's stead. -- Be the person of the Minister what it will,
his Authority is to be considered and reverenced: That of our B. Savior
extends to the very worst; S. Mat. 23.2, 3.
The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses Seat, all therefore whatsoever they bid
you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works, for they say
and do not. The Vices of their Persons you must beware of; but the Authority of
their Place and Function is still to be heeded by you.

It has been almost the ruin of the Protestant Church, upon a deadly dislike
of Popish Tyranny, to cast off this yoke of Ch^istian Obedience; and it was
several years since considerately pronounced by a grave and reverend Divine,
now with God, That an open, Dr. Jackson, l. 2. c. 9.
malapert, scoffing disobedience to all Ecclesiastic Power, professed by the
meanest, and countenanced by many great ones of the Laity, is a sin that to all
that know Gods Judgments, or have been observant to look into the days of our
Visitation, cries loudest in the Almighties ears for vengeance on this Land. --
We, I confess, of the Clergy do sometimes, by our vain and sinful lives, too
much forfeit our credit and Reputation among the People, and expose our
Authority to the contempt and despising of the disobedient, when we live in
such sort as he on whom Sir Thomas More jested, That he would not for any good
hear him say the Creed, lest he should take it for a lie coming out of his
mouth. But whatever be, as has been said, our personal miscarriage, that will
not absolve our People and Hearers from the guilt of their disobedience, in
contemning or disobeying that Authority from whence we have our Commission, and
in the Name whereof we propound Divine Truths to them. Thus far at least they
ought to obey, to believe what he delivers in the Name of God for a Divine
Truth, as such, unless they know the contrary, or till they have taken the
pains to examine it; to set about the Duties which he calls them to, and to
shun and avoid the Sins he warns them of; remembering that he is to them the
Messenger of the Lord of Hosts, the Ambassador of the living God, speaking in
Christ's stead; and so the contempt of their slighting of, and disobedience
unto him, will be interpreted as done unto Christ himself; for so he has said
of and to his Ministers, S. Luke 10.16.
He that hears you, hears me; and he that despises you, despises me; and
he that despises me, despises him that sent me.

It Is ordinary for People here to make the Exception against their Teachers
Life; or to pretend, that he may go beyond his Commission; or to allege, that
they are not convinced there is any express command from God for such things as
he delivers, and presses on them in God's Name, etc.

But it is well replied here, Vide D. Jackson ut ante, l. 2. c. 9.
That although a man should know a Constable, or some greater Officer,
pretending Commission from the King, to be a notorious lying Knave, or
treacherous Companion, yet were it not the safest way to tell him that he lied,
when he charged him to obey him in the King's Name, nor to make a scoff of his
Authority, or to reply he would not believe he had any, because he might abuse
himself and it at other times: If so he do at this time, he may answer it
before his Betters hereafter; but in the mean while it were best for the Party
commanded to obey him, till he be certain that he did either feign Authority
where he had none, or else abuse it in this particular. And if Officers should
not be obeyed in the King's Name, until men sought out the truth, whether they
had a lawful Commission, or but a counterfeit one; or whether they did not
exceed and go beyond their Commission, the King's Majesty would want a great
deal of necessary Service, and the Commonweal be at an ill pass for the
continuance of Public Peace.

Now, as my Author excellently adds, did most men fear God as much as men, or
the Son of Man, the Judge of quick and dead, as much as earthly Judges, they
would not so often withdraw their neck from the yoke of Christian Obedience
(being charged to undertake it in Christ's Name, and as they will answer it at
that dreadful day) upon such silly exceptions as they do. Be the Minister as
they list to make him for his life, it has pleased God to make him his
Messenger, his Officer to demand Obedience of them; and shall it serve their
turn to say, We will not believe that God sent him with this Message; or sure
he goes beyond his Commission; when they know nothing to the contrary, but only
will take occasion from his Person to discredit his Doctrine, if it control
them in the pursuit of worldly affairs, or cross and gainsay their humors and
pleasures.

Thou reply, it may be, thou see no evidence that Christ commands thee.
But do thou absolutely and infallibly know that he does not call thee at this
time to try thy Obedience in this particular? If not, how will thou answer thy
Judge, when thou shall appear before him, why thou out of the stubbornness of
thy heart did more respect thy private gain or humor, than his heaviest
displeasure? Should thy answer stand for good, when thou shall say to his
Messenger, it is more than I know that Christ commands me, then should the
damned be justified at the day of Judgment, when they shall truly reply, they
knew not that ever Christ did supplicate to them sub forma pauperis, Lord, when
saw we thee an hungered, or a thirst, or a stranger, etc. Most of them
questionless had less probabilities to believe this in their life time, then
thou have now to persuade thee of this particular: For thou might have known
that God had commanded thee by thy Pastor, unless thy bad desires and corrupt
affections had made thee blind. But neither shall theirs nor thy ignorance
herein help; for ignorance, which is bred of bad desires, corrupt affections,
or greedy appetites, brings forth hardness of heart and infidelity; so that
seeing thou shall not see, and hearing thou shall not hear, nor understand the
warnings for thy peace, because thou have formerly shut thine ears at thy
Pastor's Admonitions, or raged at his just Reproof; and the Law of God binds
thy Soul, upon greater penalties and better hopes than all the Laws in the
World beside could bind thy Body (even upon the hope of everlasting life, and
the penalty of everlasting death) to lay aside all carnal self-love, and all
worldly desires, for the finding out of the true sense and meaning of it, as
well as to obey it when thou have known it; and when any point of Doctrine or
Practice in general or particular is commended to thee by thy Pastor, God's
Word does bind thee to search with all sobriety and modesty the truth and force
of all the motives and inducements which he shall suggest unto thee, all
private respect laid aside, lest thou become a partial Judge of evil thoughts:
and if thou can not find better Resolution, it binds thee to rely upon his
Authority, and that so much the more, as thou have more persuasion of his
fidelity and sincerity also.

I have digressed the rather in this point, because I look on this as a chief
and principal reason why we so much beat the air, why the Laborers in Gods
Harvest do gather the wind, why Paul does plant and Apollo water to no purpose,
viz. We are not believed and received as the Stewards and Dispensers of the
Mysteries of God, as the Messengers and Ambassadors of God, sent and appointed
by him to teach his Will and press his Commands, to reprove, and admonish, and
exhort in his Name. No more is allowed to a Minister by the generality of
People, than what they would to a stranger, to any inconsiderable person in the
World, who ought to be believed and observed by them, in whatever carries the
express face and stamp of a Divine Command visible in its Countenance.

But that whereby I am to press this Obedience here, is the Rule of our Blessed
Savior. Were you in our stead, had you, as we have, the care of instructing,
informing, and admonishing others committed to you; did you watch for their
souls, as they that must give account; were you appointed the Ministers and
Vicars of Christ among them, you would certainly expect they should reverence
your Authority, they should hearken obediently to your Doctrine, they should
never dare to reject or slight it, but upon clear evidence to the contrary;
they should set themselves about the doing those good things in particular,
which in the Name of God you recommend to them in order to their eternal Good,
and decline those evil and vicious courses in particular, which you reprove
them for, and admonish them to leave and forsake. You would not take it well,
that ignorant Persons should give you the lie in Points whereof they are no
capable Judges. It Is true both of Scholars and Christians, Oportet discentem
credere, Learners must at first believe and receive on trust what is delivered
to them, till they are able themselves to gainsay upon knowledge, and evince
the contrary. What Schoolmaster would not severely rebuke and chastise the
sawciness of that Child who should oppose the Rules he understands not, in
stead of receiving and admitting of them on his Teachers Authority? What Pilot
would not condemn and chide those pragmatique Passengers, who having themselves
no skill in Wind and Weather, in Stars or Compass, should yet boldly intrude
into his place, and teach him how to steer the Ship.

Men do not certainly as themselves would be done by were they in their
Ministers stead, when in a doubtful and ambiguous matter, which themselves are
not able to examine or look into, his Authority may not determine, or at least
move them to an impartial weighing of those Arguments, and Motives, and
Considerations which in Gods Name he propounds to them; when his Reproofs and
Counsels can find no entrance; when they will not so much as draw near to the
place appointed for their instruction by him, or if they are there, trifle away
their time in other matters than a diligent attention to what is spoken to them
by the Messenger and Ambassador of the Living God.

Prove. 25.12.
As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover
upon an obedient ear, says Solomon: But it is the disobedient ear that renders
all Reproofs impertinent and misplaced, makes them lose their grace and
efficacy.

Why do we preach, if not to be believed and obeyed by our Hearers? And woe is
to us if we preach such things as are not fit to be believed and obeyed by you.
But obeyed we cannot be, unless we are first believed, and believed we cannot
be understandingly, unless we are first heard and attended to. So then you must
give proof of your Obedience, first by coming to Gods House, where you may be
instructed; and when you are there, by reverent attending on the Teacher, and
not rejecting what he offers to you from God, without full and clear evidence
to the contrary; and when you are gone home, by an impartial examination of
that which seemed at the hearing of it most doubtful to you, and a practice
according to whatever goodness you have been persuaded and directed to. And all
this is no more than what is most just and equitable in order to your own good
and salvation, a due you owe to the Authority of your Ministers Place and
Office, and what, if you could once suppose your selves but in his room and
stead, you would judge most fitting to be done.

Were the Ministers of God obeyed and reverenced by us, as by virtue of this
Rule they ought to be, the disorders and exorbitances of private spirits would
soon be reduced to an humble compliance with all good, useful, or innocent
Appointments; and the highest Censures of the Church would strike more dread on
People than they now do: Men would be afraid of being sentenced by the
Ministers of Christ as cut off from the Communion of Saints, and so all visible
Title unto Heaven.

(5.) I will instance a little in the Superiority and preeminence of the
Ancient above the Younger, according to that Law of God given to the
Israelites, Thou shall rise up before the hoary head, Levit. 19.32.
and honor the face of the old man. These are in a special manner the Image of
God, as he is the Ancient of Days; their long life has learnt them much
experience, and that experience is the way to wisdom: There is wisdom with the
Ancient, Job 12.12.
and in multitude of years is understanding: And therefore some veneration, the
signs and tokens of reverence, are a natural due to old men. It Is a woeful
degeneracy which the Prophet Isaiah points at, when he says, The child shall
behave himself proudly against the ancient, Isa. 3.5.
and the base against the honorable: A degeneracy 'twere happy the World had
never been acquainted with. There is no aged person but thinks he deserves some
reverence from the younger; we our selves, when we come to be old, shall expect
as much, and therefore most shameful it is we should need to learn this piece of
good manners: But most of all abominable, that any should despise and mock at
the ordinary infirmities which attend upon Age, especially in their own
Parents. It Is extremely unworthy, when they will not give the Ancient leave to
speak, or sport at their useful Admonitions, till they come by years to see
their own folly; but more odious still, when they revile them for the
weaknesses incident to their Age; and most inhumane and barbarous, when they
will not bear and relieve, as they are able, the infirmities of those aged
Parents who brought them into the World, pitied and provided for them when they
were weak and unable to provide for themselves, and gave, it may be, that Staff
out of their hands, whereby they are at last, in the decay of their Age, beaten
themselves.

Whoever they are that deal thus with the Ancient, may look themselves
hereafter to be so dealt with by Youth of an insolent and rude behavior; and
then they will remember sadly this wickedness of their youth; this sin of their
youth will take hold of them. Hearken to thy Father that begat thee, Prove.
23.22.
says Solomon, and despise not thy Mother when she is old. This we should
learn of our selves, if we considered what we our selves, after so long a life
in the World, should expect from Youth, our own Children more especially.

But whilst I speak of this, what must we conclude of such Novellists both in
Church and State, who despise and disparage, oppose and rise up against
whatever Constitutions the Wisdom of the Ancients have made, for Decency and
Order, Peace and Devotion, the promotion of Piety, and the security of the
Common Welfare and Happiness? This is Pride notorious, and beyond all Appology.

I might proceed farther to urge the respect of reverence which we owe to any
others that are above us in the gifts of Mind, or the outward good things and
Riches of the World; but it shall suffice to have instanced thus far, by way of
declaration of the fifth Particular.

SECT. XI.
SIxthly, The same Rule obliges us to all the positive Acts of Justice toward
others since we desire and expect that others should be so just to us.

The Negative part of Justice, i. e. To do no wrong or injury unto any, has
been already spoken to under the notion of Innocence. The Positive Acts of it
come here to be considered of, whereby we do suum cuique tribuere, render unto
others that which is right and due; according to that of the Apostle, Romans
13.7, 8.
Render unto all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom
custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor; owe no man any thing, but to
love one another.

I will instance,

First, In the distributive part of Justice, that which concerns chiefly such
as are in Authority and Eminency over others, in the distribution of Rewards
and Punishments where they are needful.

(1.) This Rule will train them up to the Rewarding part of Justice. It Is the
great defect in Distributive Justice, Charron of Wisdom, p. 399.
as it is commonly practiced in the World, that it punishes only, and
rewards not: It Is lame of this Right hand, and enclineth only to Punishment.
The greatest favor men usually receive from it is Indemnity, a Pay too short
for them that deserve well. But this is that which every one naturally desires
and expects, that his good works toward the Public, his usefulness and
subserviency to the Common Good, be answerably acknowledged and rewarded.
Gratitude is an undoubted branch of Justice; and Seneca Seneca.
brands the contrary Vice for intolerable and unsociable: Grave vitium
intolerabile, quod dissociat homines. Now men in Place and Authority are the
Dispensers of the Public Thanks and Gratitude for Good offices and Deserts,
and therefore stand obliged accordingly to distribute Honors and Rewards for
the encouragement of Well-doers. There is none that deserves well, but, though
he act not purposely and only for Reward, and can be content to do well though
he miss of it, yet he reasonably hopes and expects some grateful return
proportionable to the degrees of his Merits.

(2.) This Rule leads also to the Punishing part of Justice, when there is need
for it. At the first view indeed it may seem otherwise; for what Malefactor is
there who desires to be punished, who would be punished if he could help it?
And therefore one would think, if the Judge dealt by him as he would be done by
himself in his case, he should spare and acquit him, in stead of condemning and
punishing of him. But here we must call to mind what was premised in the
explication of our Rule, to wit, that we are to understand it of no other Will
but that which is regular and well-ordered, and complies with the Dictates of
religious and sober Reason. Now if the desires and expectations of the
Malefactor were such, he could not but will the Corrections and Punishments
which are for his own amendment, or for the Public good, the warning and
safety of others. Punitive Justice is really a Branch of Goodness, aiming at
the Offenders reformation where the case will allow it, and the Common Good, to
caution and terrify others from imitating so bad an example, lest they share
in the like shame and punishment. It may be so, I confess, that the Common Good
may prove inconsistent with the Private and Particular Good of the Offender. A
Murderer or Traitor, for instance, that has forfeited his Life to Justice; the
Common Good requires that Justice smite him with her Sword; his Particular
Good, that he have a longer time of Repentance vouchsafed him; and were the
Judge in his case, he would no question wish the later for himself. What
therefore must he do here? I answer, What he can, to promote the real good and
repentance of the Offender; but yet the Common Good is far more valuable and
desirable than any Private and Particular Interest; and Public Persons, men in
Authority, are to look on themselves as Representatives of the Society, whose
Good they are to serve, and must consequently do for it whatsoever they should
reasonably expect to be done for their own security. Now it is unquestionably
for the good and benefit of the whole Community, that insolent, stubborn, and
notorious Offenders be put to open shame and punishment. A private and personal
pity in this case is the public wrong and damage. Magistrates therefore are
not to weigh so much what they would desire themselves were they in the
Offender's room, as what they should reasonably desire and expect, were they in
the place of the whole Community and Society whose good their Office is
designed to serve. He that spares a notorious Offender, gives him liberty to do
more wrong and injury, and countenanceth many to follow his example, in hopes
of the like impunity, to the great prejudice of the common welfare. He that
spares a Murderer, entails Gods Curse upon the Land; and he that spares a
Traitor, winks at a notorious Murderer, and declares but little value for the
Public Safety, bound up in the Life and Welfare of a King or Sovereign. -- But
then, besides this, the execution of Justice is the best means to secure the
common practice of this excellent Rule, which has so great an influence upon
the Public welfare; and it is the Magistrates charge and duty, in order to the
Common Good, to teach Offenders, who have certainly broken the Rule by doing
wrong and injury, how ill they have done, by making them to suffer and smart
for it, and so to warn others not to follow them in so doing. As no body
therefore is willing to be wronged, so he is to discipline others not to be
willing to do wrong, by inflicting those Punishments which the Offender is as
unwilling to undergo, as the Party offended was to suffer the wrong done. It
were better, no question, for Offenders, if such Punishments and Corrections
were more constantly inflicted, whereby they might be brought in time to
repentance and amendment; and 'twere better for the whole Community, if the
punitive acts of Justice were more impartially applied than they are.
Certainly, could a Child choose reasonably, he would rather ask the wholesome
severities of Discipline from his Parents, than a fond indulgence of that
Liberty which is like to prove his bane and undoing: And therefore when
Children are grown up to years of maturity and understanding, they find reason
to bestow thanks both on their Parents and Masters for this part of Nurture as
well as any other. And there is as little question but, would Mastistrates, and
those who are in Authority, listen to the cry of the Community, to the cry of
Church and State, they would be more vigilant and diligent in the inflicting of
punishment upon the Transgressors of the Laws than they are, for the security
and promotion of the Common Good and Welfare. -- I proceed,

Secondly, to the Commutative part of Justice; those Offices, I mean, which
concern Commutations, Contracts, and Agreements, with the like Instruments of
Humane Converse. And here I will declare in like manner by Instances how the
several Branches of Justice are deducible from the Rule before us. And,

(1.) It Is a common due we owe to all men with whom we are linked together in
Society, to speak the truth; Putting away lying, Ephesians. 4.25.
to speak every man truth with his Neighbor, as the Apostle has it. Speech is
the Key which unlocks and opens our Minds and Thoughts to each other, the chief
means of all our converse and intercourse each with other: but lying altogether
frustrates and disappoints the ends of Speech: In stead of acquainting others
with our mind and thoughts, it deceives and misinforms them; and silence is
more sociable than untrue speech. We desire other men should speak the truth to
us, to inform and satisfy, and not to cheat and delude us; and therefore we
are obliged our selves to speak the truth, and not to lie unto others.

(2.) The same Rule trains us up to all Justice in Buying and Selling, so that
the Tradesman shall neither by an under-price, below what the rest of his
Occupation can live by, gain away their Custom from them, nor yet inhance the
price of any Commodity above the value of it, that I mean for which it may be
sold, and which is the ordinary Rate of it; so that the Buyer shall have a
valuable matter for the Money which he gives, and the Seller also a valuable
Price for that which he parts with, but neither of them make their Gains out of
each others Losses. Every honest man would so buy as the Seller might live by
him, and have a moderate and ratable consideration for his Art, and Pains, and
Hazards; and every one that sells justly can desire no more.

The Rule of Justice in all Commerce and Traffic in the World is aequalitas
accepti and redditi, an equality of proportion between what is received and
what is returned, that there be a valuable given for a valuable, which cannot
be secured more effectually than by the Rule we are upon; The Buyer to suppose
himself in the Sellers place, and the Seller again in the Buyers, the
difference of circumstances allowed for. The one is to sell, not as himself
buys, for he cannot live without some gains; but as he would reasonably desire
to buy were he in his Customers room, i. e. for moderate and conscionable
gains: And the Buyer again should willingly give those moderate and
conscionable Allowances which the thing he purchases, rated together with the
Pains, and Hazard, and Art of the Seller is valuable for; i. e. such as were he
himself in the Sellers room he would desire from another.

(3.) The same Rule obliges us to all Justice in the performance of our Words,
Promises, Covenants, Contracts, or Oaths. He that promises to another (be it
by word of mouth or writing, it matters not) conveys away a Right and Title
unto that which he promises; but is deeper still engaged to the performance,
if he have called God in as a Witness to the Contract and Promise made by him.
The good man's character is, Psalm. 15.4.
that though he swears to his own hurt and damage, he changes not: So
regardful is he of those Promises he has sealed by Oath, that he will perform
them, though it be to his own prejudice. And certainly this Rule will train us
up to make Conscience of the same, to keep our Promises, to perform our
Covenants, to make good our Words and Oaths; for this we desire and expect
from other men: we build upon their Words, we trust to and rely on their
Engagements, Bonds, and Covenants; we look they should stand to their
Agreements; we brand it for the highest injury and wickedness, for any that
have given us the greatest security upon earth, I mean an Oath, to show
themselves persidious and perjured together. But it is a shame to speak how much
the Christian World degenerates in this Point: Famous was the instance of that
eminent Heathen the Roman Regulus, who being taken Prisoner of his Enemies the
Carthaginians, and obtaining leave of them to go home to Rome, to treat with
the Senate for a Commutation, or exchange of Captives, with promise if he sped
not, to return again; first gave weighty Reasons to the Senate to dissuade them
from the Commutation, and then returned back himself unto cruel usage, rather
than he would falsify and violate his Faith and Promise. -- But we must renew
the Psalmists complaint, Psalm. 12.1, 2.
Help Lord, for the godly man cease, the faithful fail from among the
Children of men; they speak vanity every one with his Neighbor, with
flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. -- They lie in their
hearts, when they promise, and after their promise made lie again to men in
their performance; they esteem their words but as wind, and their Covenants in
writing little more than scribbled Papers, wherein they are not concerned. In
the exacting of their Debts from others they are like the Servant in the
Parable, who finding his fellow servants that ought him an hundred pence, S.
Mat. 18.
laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what thou owe,
despising his submission, slighting his entreaties, stopping his ears to his
Requests, using no forbearance, but casting him forthwith into Prison till he
should pay the Debt. -- But when they should come to discharge their own to
others, good words at best are their present payment, Sir, have patience with
me, and I will pay you all; Forbearance is the thing they intentionally drive
at, but the payment of all goes slowly on. Now, did men as they would be done
by, they would not only in cases of apparent necessity forbear others upon
their requests, as themselves in the like cases would desire to be forborne; but
would as faithfully and seasonably pay their Debts to others, as they desire
other men should discharge theirs to themselves. Every one would look upon the
violation of his own Word, Promise, or Oath, with as evil and censorious an
eye, as he does on the unfaithfulness of others.

Here let me drop a Remarque upon the notorious injustice of such who have
plighted their Faith to each other in the solemn Promises and Precontracts of
Matrimony. For either of them to fail, without a mutual Release, is an injury
the Heathens would blush at: And they need no more to excite them to be honest
and punctual each with other, than the consideration of what the one Party
expects and desires from the other. How ill would he that breaks his Faith have
taken it, should she have broken hers first? And the same may be said of the
Woman. Besides that in this case the injury is valuable not only according to
the prejudice resulting from this unfaithfulness, but according to that degree
of affection which the Party is engaged in with whom the Faith is broken. -- To
this I will yet add one other. I would to God it were especially laid to heart
by men, how indispensibly they stand obliged to their Sovereign by virtue of
the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance sworn by them; and that all Officers
would impartially consider how strongly they are engaged by the respective
Oaths taken by them at their entrance upon their Offices, and then, I am sure,
a discharge of the same would be looked upon as an undeniable Branch of
Justice, which they would as readily set themselves about, as they require and
expect any others should do about the performance of what they swear to. But
because of the monstrous breach of Oaths, this horrid dishonesty, injustice,
and perjury, the Land mourns.

(4.) The same Rule teaches us to be true and faithful in all our Trusts; for
that we desire and expect from others our selves. Now,

(1.) Every man's Calling and Office is his Trust. We expect men should be both
skilful and faithful in their Callings and Employments; and therefore such
should we approve our selves to be.

(2.) He that leaves another a pledge of his Fidelity in the performance of his
Contract, as a Trust to be returned again upon the performance, may after that
performance challenge the same in the nature of a Depositum, to be rendered and
restored again without hurt or impairing; for thus we expect other men should
deal with us.

(3.) He that commits his Secrets to another to be concealed, admits him to a
Trust which he is not to violate. "Discover not the secret of another, Prove.
25.9.
says Solomon. This disclosing of Secrets, however common it be in the
babbling Age wherein we live, is the highest affront and injury to Friendship
imaginable, the bane of Amity, and no man is willing to be served so himself.
It Is supposed always, that nothing is to be communicated by way of Secret,
which tends to Treason and Conspiracy; for in this case to conceal is to
partake of the Guilt, and become a Partner in the Iniquity.

(4.) The Executors and Administrators of the Goods of the Deceased have a
great Trust lying upon them, by virtue of the Will of the Deceased; and the
Will of the Deceased has always been esteemed a most sacred Band of Fidelity.
The last Trust we can leave with any, is the Execution of our Will and Pleasure
when we are gone hence; and though the Parties that have left the Trust are in
no capacity, it may be, of taking cognizance of the performance, yet we may
reckon with our selves, that God takes so much the more notice of it, and will
exact so much a stricter account at the hands of those who are concerned: And
they who presume to rob the Dead, or thwart their last Will and Pleasure,
should, methinks, have the Ghosts of their departed Friends continually
haunting of their Phansies, and upbraiding them with their injustice,
unfaithfulness, and breach of trust? Who would be thus dealt with himself? Nay,
it would add to the dissatisfaction of our Spirits at our decease did we not
confidently rely upon the faithfulness of others in the observing of our last
Appointments.

Of the same nature are Feoffees entrusted with the Conveyance of Lands unto
Pious uses; only their injustice is the more aggravated by the injury they do
the Poor, and their impiety toward God, as well as their contempt and
unfaithfulness to the Wills of the Dead.

(5.) To these might be added Tutors and Guardians, who are entrusted with the
Persons and Estates of others during their Minority. Governors and Protectors
in like manner with their Infant Prince; and they who become Sponsors and
Sureties to the Church at the Baptizing of Infants, to see to their Instruction
and Education in order to a Virtuous and Christian Life.

The violation and breach of Trusts is an inexcusable Branch of Injustice,
which we our selves would be most ready to exclaim against in others; and
therefore Fidelity in every Trust committed to us, is a piece of Justice we are
by this Rule to charge our selves withal.

Lastly, to mention no more, It Is a point of Justice to render Tribute and
Custom to our Governors, in order to their Honorable Maintenance, and for the
defraying of the great Expenses of their Place, and the supplies of the
emergent necessities of their Government; to render Tribute and Custom, as well
as Fear, Honor, and Obedience; and this we should expect and look for our
selves, were we in their room.

But this may possibly be referred to the peformance of our Contracts and
Oaths, or the payment of our Debts, or that Obedience I spoke before of as due
to our Superiors: And therefore I will add no more of it.

SECT. XII.
SEventhly, To draw toward a Conclusion, We are by this Rule obliged to all
the acts of Love and Charity unto others; and this I shall demonstrate, as I
have done the foregoing, by several Instances that are most properly to be
referred unto, and ranked under this Head. And,

(1.) I will begin with the common act of Love and Charity, I mean, Pity and
compassion toward, sympathy and fellow-feeling with the afflicted and
distressed; a due consideration of, and being affected with the sufferings and
calamities of others. Heb. 13.3.
Remember them who are in bonds, says the Apostle, as bound with them; and
them which suffer adversity, as being your selves also in the body; i. e. as
being your selves Members of the same Body, and dwelling in like manner in a
Body subject to the very same evils and calamities: So remember them therefore
in their bonds and adversity, as you would desire your selves in a like case to
be remembered. It Is natural for us in the time of affliction to covet and be
pleased with the pity and commiseration of others; the yearning of their bowels
and expression of their compassion toward us, is as a Cordial to our spirits,
and eases us in a great measure and degree of our burden: But on the contrary,
it is a vexation and trouble, sometimes beyond other troubles, not to be
regarded and sympathized with. In such cases we are ready to sigh forth the
Churches Lamentation, Lam. 1.12.
Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by the way? Behold, and see if there be
any sorrow like to my sorrow, wherewith the Lord has afflicted me in the day
of his fierce anger. We are apt to cry out with Job, Jod 19.21.
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends; for the hand of God has
touched me. Nothing cuts and wounds more, than when others, in stead of
condoling our state, add affliction to our affliction, by their cruel
hard-heartedness; neglects, disdains, and derisions: We then complain with the
Psalmist, Psa. 69.20, 21
Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness, and I looked for
some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
They gave me also gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to
drink; i. e. vexation where I expected comfort. That was the great aggravation
of Job's trials, Job 19.13, 14, 15.
He has put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily
estranged from me; my kinsfolk have failed me, and my familiar friends have
forgotten me: they that dwell in mine house count me for a stranger, I am an
alien in their sight. -- We bear those common desires of being pitied by others
in our calamities and sufferings, about us, which will upbraid and reprove us,
if we do not in like manner take pity upon others.

Such was the sympathy of S. Paul's spirit with all the Churches of Christ,
that he said of himself, Who is weak, 2 Cor. 11.29.
and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not. Quae Ecclesia adfligitur
and ego non adfligar? Grot. in loc.
Quis est cui offensa objicitur in via pietatis, ut non ego urar? What Church
is afflicted so, as I am not afflicted for and with it? Who is there
scandalized in the way of Piety, and I am not extremely troubled for it? for so
the word [burn] is taken figuratively pro animi cruciatu, for vexation of
spirit. Vro hominem, in Terence is as much as, I vex or nettle the man.

The good Courtier Nehemiah was very inquisitive after the state of his
Brethren the Jews left in Captivity, Neh. c. 1.
and of Jerusalem; c. 2.
and however he was himself of a cheerful temper (for he had not been
before-time sad in the King's presence, as he says of himself) yet, when he
heard of their great affliction, reproach, and misery, his heart was sorrowful,
and his countenance changed, and he sat down and wept and mourned certain
days, and fasted and prayed before the God of Heaven. These were the
manifestations of his compassionate disposition.

But they are inhumane with a witness, who, in stead of sympathizing and
condoling with, deride and make a mock of others sufferings, as if it were an
accession to their joy that others were troubled. Rejoice not, Prove. 24.17, 18.
says Solomon, when thine enemy falls, and let not thine heart be glad when
he stumbleth, lest the Lord see it, and it displease him.

(2.) The Apostle says, Rejoice with them that rejoice, Romans 12.15.
as well as Weep with them that weep: And the same Rule will train us up to
both, as well to delight in, Bonis proximi congaudere and de tristibus dolere.
and be glad of the happiness of others, as to commiserate them in their
afflictions: for we therefore condole the misery of others sincerely, because
we wish them well; and whom we wish well unto, we shall take pleasure
proportionably in the well-doing of, we shall be glad to hear the tidings of
their felicity. Thus most certainly we would have other men to do to us. S.
Luke 15.
The man in the Parable that found his lost Sheep, not only laid it on his
shoulders rejoicing, but, when he came home, called together his friends and
neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my Sheep which
was lost. The woman also that had found her lost piece of Silver, called
together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found
the piece which I had lost. The Father, in like manner, of the Prodigal, after
his return commands his servants to bring the fatted Calf and kill it; and, Let
us eat, says he, and be merry; for this my Son was dead and is alive again,
was lost and is found.

So far would we have others from envying and repining at our happiness, that
we desire they should congratulate and rejoice together with us for it. Did we
therefore regard other men as our selves, their happiness would be esteemed by
us as part of our own, after the same sort as each Member shares in the health
and welfare of any one in the Body. 1 Cor. 12.25, 26. Unius corpoporis membra-
ut intelligamus nos ipsos accepisse beneficium cum beneficium praestitimus
proximo, nos laesos cum nocitum est fratri. Erasm. Enchir. Mil. Christ p. 145.
That Is S. Paul's observation, The members should have the same care one for
another, and whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one
member be honored, all the members rejoice with him. The practice of this Rule
would put out the envious eye, and rid the world of those many discontents and
murmurings which Persons of an inferior rank, degree, and desert are too apt
oftentimes to entertain against those that excel them, or are preferred before
them. This would be a rare expedient to add to the happiness of every one, by
all the accessions of happiness which accrue unto any; because it would
discipline every one to rejoice and take pleasure in the happiness of another,
which many now wax lean and pale with discontent at. It would instruct men,
Erasm. Ench. Mil. Christ. p 14^.
as has been said, Omnium commodis perinde ut suis aggratulari, omnium
incommodis non secus quam suis indolere; to congratulate the good fortunes of
others as their own, and lay to heart their calamities no otherwise than their
own.

(3.) The same Rule obliges us to the Charity of an hearty forgiveness of all
those injuries and wrongs which others, through infirmity and passion, have
done unto us, or for which they profess themselves sorrowful. This is that we
all desire and hope for from God Almighty our selves, and miserable were we
without the assurance of it; and yet we are given to understand, that there is
no grounded expectation of this from God, unless we forgive others also; S.
Mat. 18.35.
Our Heavenly Father will never forgive us, if we from our hearts forgive not
every one his brother their trespasses. Nor is this limited to once, or twice,
or thrice, or seven times; but, ver. 21, 22.
as Christ said unto Peter, Till seventy times seven, i. e. toties quoties, as
often as he shall chance to offend, and ask forgiveness at thine hands. And
this is the measure we not only hope for from God, but wish our selves from
other men also. We often through infirmity, passion, and humane frailty, offend
others; and in these cases we would not have them implacable and unappeasable
upon our acknowledgments: We would not have them over-severe and rigorous in
exacting satisfaction at our hands; and therefore we should pardon others upon
easy terms, who often need it our selves. These two should always go in
conjunction, -- hanc veniam petimus, dabimusque vicissim, That we be as ready
our selves to forgive others, and be reconciled to them, upon the same
considerations of equity we would desire our selves to be accepted on in their
condition: And therefore,

(4.) As a good step and means to this forgiveness, the same Rule will lead us
to all charitable censures of other men's failings, and whatever qualifying
interpretations their actions and offenses are capable of. S. Luke 6.37.
Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be
condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. Let equity evermore hold the
balance wherein you weigh other men's transgressions, and cast in all the grains
of allowance that a charitable mind will admit of. I mean not that we should at
any time call evil good, more than we may call good evil; but where the fault
is most censurable, Adjuvant and haec, ne dolori mentis obsequare, si commode
collectis rhetorum circumstantiis pariter and tuum incommodum extenues and
alienam eleves injuriam, his ferme modis. Laesit, sed facile resarcietur, tum
puer est, rerum imperitus, adolescens, mulier est; alieno fecit instinctu,
imprudens, probe potus, aequum est ignoscere. At contra, graviter quidam
laesit, sed pater est, frater, praeceptor, amicus, uxor. Par est hoc doloris
illius vel charitati vel authoritati condonari. Aut paria faciens injuriam cum
aliis illius in te beneficiis compensabis, vel cum tuis in illum offensis
exaequabis. Hic quidem laesit, sed alias quam saepe profuit? Illiberalis est
animi benefactorum oblivisci, injuriolae meminisse. Nunc me offendit sed
quoties a me offensus? Ignoscam illi, ut mihi meo exemplo ignoscat and ipse
delinquenti. Erasm. Enchir. Mil. Christ p. 204.
let the committer of it have all the just excuses that the circumstances of
his state will allow of: Let his ignorance, his unwariness, his mistakes, his
passions, his age, his good meanings, be all considered: Let Charity thus
interpose on his behalf; The matter, it may be, is not so bad as report speaks
it; the man's heart and tongue kept not pace together; passion and earnestness
transported his language beyond the bounds of his thoughts and meaning; or he
meant well, possibly, in that which has now in the issue proved otherwise; or
he knew not well what he did, and he testifies as much by his after-sorrow for
the miscarriage, that he designed not the wrong out of any spite or malice.

These, and the like, are the mitigations wherewith we desire others should
lessen our offenses: We would not have them judge rashly of the thoughts and
purposes of our minds, which they know not; and as favorably as may be of our
miscarriages, which they know: And therefore thus should we be minded and
disposed toward others. We should put on bowels of mercies, Col. 3.12, 13.
kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering, forbearing one
another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any,
expressing that Charity which is not suspicious, but apt to believe the best, 1
Cor. 13.
and hope the best; not Eagle-eyed in others faults, but ready to overlook and
cover a multitude of infirmities and imperfections; that Charity which the
Members of the Body bear to each other: See Ecclus 19.13, 14, 15, 16. It may be
he has not done it. -- It may be he has not said it. -- Many times it is a
slander. -- There is one that slippeth in his speech, but not from his heart.
-- And who is he that has not offended with his tongue?
for if one Member chance to hurt or wound the other, all care is taken
presently for the cure of that hurt or wound, but no man delights to vex that
Part or Member which occasioned the sore.

(5.) The same Rule commands from us all expressions of kindness and good will
one to another, friendly and amicable words and salutations. Ephesians. 4.31, 32.
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and clamor, and evil-speaking, be put away
from you, says the Apostle, with all malice; and be ye kind one to another,
tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has
forgiven you. Prove. 16.24.
"Pleasant words, says Solomon, are as an Honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and
health to the bones. Courteous and loving salutations, the expressions of
mutual good wishes, take away the jealousies and suspicions that are apt
otherwise to grow in the minds of men each touching other; and produce,
strengthen, and increase mutual benevolence. Prove. 15.1.
A soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger.

The affected silence, and scrupling at the ordinary Salutations, Good-morrows,
and forms of well-wishing among us, which some vail over with the pretenses of
Religion, look too like a clownish, proud, fantastic and unsociable
surliness. It Is strange that any should boggle at such wholesome forms of Speech
as are commonly used by good Christians to show their mutual Love and Piety
together: God be with you, God speed your work, God bless you, God give you a
good morrow, etc. They forget the Curse pronounced by the Psalmist upon the
enemies of Sion, Neither do they which go by say, Psalm. 129.8.
The blessing of the Lord be upon you, We bless you in the Name of the Lord.
They forget that of Boaz to his Reapers, "The Lord be with you; Ruth. 2.4.
who answered him again, The Lord bless thee. They forget also the command of
Christ to his Disciples, S. Luke 10.5.
When ye come into an house, first say, Peace be unto this house; the usual
form of the Jewish Salutations.

But look, as this friendliness of words is opposed to a dogged, surly,
clownish, and unsociable silence; so also to that cursing and evil speaking
which is too commonly heard in the world. Romans 12.14.
Bless, says the Apostle, and curse not. A good word, we say truly, is as
cheap as a bad one; and, to be sure, to the hearer it is always more acceptable,
and to the speaker more accountable. Who is there that desires not, that likes
not well of the friendly wishes, and kind words, and courteous salutations of
others? Who is there that loves to be railed at or cursed himself?

As for the Imprecations frequently to be observed in the Psalms, that of
Venerable Bede is fit to be remembered by us; Citat. in Cat. D. Tho. Luc. 6.
Prophetae per imprecationem quid esset futurum cecinerunt, non optantis voto
sed spiritu praevidentis, The Prophets of God by their Imprecations declared
what was to be, not with the wish of their private desires, but with the Spirit
of Prophecy, foreseeing what God had appointed for his enemies. They are not so
much the Prophets Curses, as their Predictions, foretelling what Curses shall
befall the ungodly, in the form of Imprecations: See Dr. H. Pref. to Ps. 32.
And most of them might be qualified by reading them in the Future-tense,
rather than the Imperative-Mood.

But there is a generation of Vipers, whose mouths are upon all occasions, upon
every slight provocation, full of Curses; the poison of Asps is vented from
their lips: To these it is seasonable to apply that of S. Chrysostom, Citat. in
Cat. D. Thomae, S. Luc. 6.
Homo es, aspidum venena non evomas, nec vertaris in belluam: est tibi datum
os, non ut mordeas, sed ut aliorum vulnera sanes. Remember that thou art a Man:
Belch not forth the poison of Asps, neither be thou turned into a Beast: Thy
mouth is given thee not to bite and devour others with, but to heal their
wounds. -- There is no man but entertains the uncharitable wishes and
imprecations of others toward himself with a great disgust and aversation; and
therefore he should not use or reply the like to others.

(6.) The same Rule obliges us to pray unto God on the behalf of others; for
if we are disposed as we should be, we cannot choose but will and like well of
the Prayers of others unto God for us, in such cases especially wherein we
stand most in need of the Divine help and aid. Prayer is, as Bishop Andrews
calls it, radius charitatis, the ray or beam of charity. There is none so poor
and unprovided in the world, but he can pray for others; and that is the
chiefest way oftentimes wherein we are capable of benefiting others, by
engageing of God by Prayer for his Blessing on them. This is the common Charity
we may and ought to expect each from other. Christ has taught us to say, Pater
noster, Our Father, that we might include others with our selves. Parents
should pray for a Blessing on their Children, and Children again for a Reward
and Blessing upon their Parents. Ministers should pray for a Blessing on their
People, and People again for a Blessing on their Ministers. We are all engaged
to pray one for another; and then claim a peculiar right to the Prayers of each
other, when we are surrounded with temptations and difficulties, or fallen into
trouble and distress. None that understands himself, and how necessary and
beneficial a practice Prayer is, and what a treasury of Blessings it procures
from God, but would desire the Prayers of others on his own behalf, and
therefore is engaged upon the same account to pray for others. -- But then,

Lastly, True Love and Charity rests not in good Words, and Wishes, and
Prayers; but constrains men to do the best they can for the benefit of others;
not only been loqui, and been velle, but benefacere: And indeed without this we
do but feign and dissemble, when we pretend good will to others.

Who would choose to be served and put off with fair speeches and good words
only, when it is in the power of the speaker at the same time really to help and
relieve his case? S. James 2.15, 16.
If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you
say to them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, notwithstanding ye give
them not those things which are needful to the body, what does it profit? says
S. James. This Rule therefore engages us, as we have opportunity, to do good
and communicate, as we are able, for the relief and supply of others; that as
we desire the abundance of others may be be a supply for our want, 2 Cor. 8.14.
so our abundance may be a supply for the wants of others. And thus we are
trained up to all the acts of Liberality, Almsgiving, and Beneficence, and that
according to our Neighbors necessity both in Soul and Body, in the inward and
outward Man. It Is a Golden Rule of Chrysologus, Petr. Chrysol.
Quomodo vis, quantum vis, quam cito vis misericordiam tibi fieri, tam cito
aliis, tantum, taliter ipse miserere; Look how thou would have mercy shown
to thy self, after what manner, in what measure, with what speed and dispatch;
do it in the same manner, and with the same measure and speed to others.

Show thy self merciful to the Soul of thy Brother, in order to his eternal
happiness, by reproving his sins; but with the reproofs of Charity, not the
reproaches of Pride; by admonishing him to leave and forsake his evil courses;
by restoring him in the spirit of meekness; by relieving his ignorance,
convincing him of his errors, resolving his doubts, counselling and advising
him in the way which he should choose, confirming and strengthening of him in the
ways of well-doing, and comforting of him in all his troubles and distresses.

Show thy self merciful to the Body and outward Man of thy Brother, by
relieving his wants, giving drink to the thirsty, food to the hungry, clothes
to the naked, lodging to the stranger and destitute; by purchasing liberty for
the captive, and the means of health for the sick or maimed; by giving money to
the poor, or lending freely to those who are reduced to extremities; by
standing up on the behalf of the Orphan and Widow: for these are the things
thou would desire of others in a like case; these are the good turns thou
would wish for from other men.

And see thou do them with the same cheerfulness and bounty, proportionably to
thy condition, as thou would wish, like well of, and commend in any other
toward thy self.

It Is an excellent admonition of Lactantius touching Charity, Lactant. l. 6.
Quoties rogaris, tentari te a Deo creed, an sis dignus exaudiri; As often as
thou art asked and entreated of others, believe that thou art tried, whether or
no thou art worthy thy self to be heard of God, nay, and of others also in a
like estate.

The through practice of this Rule would make us all in our places as famous
for the works of Mercy as Job's Character, who was able to speak thus of
himself; Job 29.12, etc.
I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to
help him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I
caused the widows heart to sing for joy. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was
I to the lame. I was a father to the poor, and the cause which I knew not I
searched out; and I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of
his teeth.

He that could do the least, would yet help somewhat, as I said before, by his
comfortable Words and Prayers, the afflicted and necessitous: To be sure he
would by no means add to their burden sorrow and vexation; like Job too in
this particular, whose reply to his miserable Comforters was, Job 16.4, 5.
I also could speak as you do, if your soul were in my soul's stead: I could
heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. But I would strengthen
you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.

The poor and afflicted would need no other Advocate than this in the breasts
of those whom they apply to for relief, to answer all their Objections against
Charity, and to draw forth the cheerful Contributions of their Liberality and
Bounty. Do but to us as you would desire your selves to be dealt with in our
condition; and make no other excuses for the withholding or maiming your
Charity toward us, than you would have others make to you in a like estate.

There can be no question but this Precept enjoins us all the acts of Love,
Charity, Benevolence, Mercy, and Liberality toward others.

The only doubt to be resolved further is, Whether it exact our love also to
our Enemies? For that you know is the Gospel-Command, That we should love our
Enemies; that is an Instruction S. Paul takes out of Solomon, If thine enemy
hunger feed him, Romans 12.20. Prove. 25.21.
if he thirst give him drink: That was a Precept also in the Law, Exodus 23.4, 5.
to bring back an enemies ox going astray, and to help up his ass lying under a
burden.

Now many are so nobly resolved, as we are apt to speak, that they disdain to
receive a Courtesy from an Enemy; they will rather starve, than be fed by an
Enemy; rather die, than be preserved by an Enemy. It may therefore seem
questionable whether this Rule will oblige to Love, and Goodness, and Charity
toward an Enemy, doing to him as we would our selves receive from him.

But the resolution is easy and clear enough: For who does not commend the
nobleness and generosity of an Enemies kindness? who does not praise and extol
this in an Enemy? and therefore must needs adjudge himself obliged to imitate
what he admires the excellency and loveliness of. To do good to others, as Men,
is good and commendable in it self; and so to whomsoever the good be done,
friend or foe: But to do good to ones Enemy heightens the degrees of Charity;
for if it be a more blessed thing to give than to receive, according to our
Saviors Axiom, our Reason must needs infer, that it is still the more blessed
and praiseworthy to do good to those from whom we have received evil our
selves. -- And as for what was principal in the Objection, the unwillingness of
some to receive kindnesses from their Enemies, I question not but some deep
degrees of suffering and extremity would quickly tame and subdue that pride and
haughtiness of their Spirits.

Besides, the Rule of our Blessed Savior (as Reverend Dr. Jackson well
observes) is, That we do that for every man, which we would have any man do for
us; and not only that to this or that man, which we expect from them alone.

Nor yet merely so; but, (as was noted in the Explication) That we do that to
every man, according to our Abilities, which we desire to receive our selves at
God's hands; and woe were our case, if he had not loved us whilst we were
Enemies; loved us so then, as to preserve us in our Being till by his Grace we
were made friends, and so admitted unto greater Blessings. -- It is not
therefore to be wondered that S. Luke S. Luke 6.
places this Golden Rule amidst the other Commands of Love (as I suggested in
the beginning) and that Love to Enemies, whereby we may become merciful, as our
Father also is merciful.

And thus now, as briefly as the copiousness of such a Subject would well
allow, I have run through the chief Heads of those Virtues we are engaged by
this Rule to be zealous followers of; and intimated by the way those contrary
Vices we are to shun and abhor: And, I think, I may well conclude this
Induction with S. Paul's heap of Universals, Finally, Phil. 4.8.
Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest or
venerable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any
virtue, and if there be any praise, think of these things. (...), reason your
selves into these things, and that from the Premises already laid down.

SECT. XIII.
I Pass to the second part of the Words, where my stay will be much shorter,
the Enforcement of this Golden Rule, of this General and Comprehensive Precept,
For this, says Christ, is the Law and the Prophets.

Hoc lex vatesque docent, Castalio in loc.
haec legis vatumque summa; This is that which the Law and Prophets teach, and
this is the sum of the Law and Prophets. This Rule is established by the
Authority of the Law and the Prophets, and it is in it self a fruitful Epitome
of the several Precepts delivered in the Law and Prophets. Quae in illa aut ab
istis dicta; The things contained in the Law, or spoken by the Prophets, are
summarily comprised in this Saying.

The Law and the Prophets stand for all the Old Testament, for which also
sometimes is put Moses and the Prophets: Thus S. Luke speaks of our Blessed
Savior, S. Luke 24.27
that beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all
the Scriptures the things concerning himself. Where we have express mention of
all the Scriptures, and them divided into these two parts, Moses and the
Prophets. To this purpose Abraham replies unto the Rich man in torments,
concerning the provision made for his Brethrens escaping of them, S. Luke 16.29.
They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them. And when S. Paul would
clear himself from Heresy and Irreligion to the Jews, he proffesseth his
belief of all things written in the Law and the Prophets. Act. 24.14.
The Scribes and Pharisees had much in their mouths the Law and the Prophets;
the Law and the Prophets were read daily in their Synagogues: Act. 13.15.
and yet so blind were they in their practice, as to overlook that which was
most considerable in the Law and the Prophets. The better therefore to infore
this excellent Rule of Life, our Blessed Lord and Savior tells his Disciples,
That this is the Law and the Prophets: i. e. This (1.) is that which they
undeniably call for: This is indeed (2.) the sum of that Duty they require: And
this (3.) they put a special Emphasis upon, above all external and ceremonial
Observances whatsoever.

Under this threefold Gloss I shall endeavor to give you an account of our
Blessed Saviors Argument, For this is the Law and the Prophets.

First, This is that which the Law and the Prophets do unquestionably and
undeniably call for. The foundations and grounds of this Rule are there clearly
expressed; the Branches to which it extends self are there commanded and
enjoined. This Rule has the Authority of the Holy Scriptures to back and
enforce it. So far is Christ from disparaging the Law and Prophets, that he
establiseth his Precepts by them: S. Mat. 5.17.
Think not, says he, that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets; I am
not come to destroy, but to fulfill; q. d. I came not to abrogate or take away
the binding power of the Law and Prophets, but my self to fulfill what they
prescribed; and not only to enjoin it upon my Disciples, but to fill up and
explain the true sense and meaning of that in my Ministry, which was more
darkly shadowed and adumbrated only by them. The Jewish Laws are usually
distinguished into Moral, Judicial, and Ceremonial.

The Moral Law is the Law of Nature revived, the Law leaning on eternal and
never-failing Principle and Rules of Equity: And this is so far from being
destroyed by Christ, that he has ratified and improved it.

The Judicial or Civil Law is that which respects them as a particular State,
Body, and Society, separate and distinct from the rest of the World; this stood
in force so long as their Commonwealth and Government remained: but
appertaining unto them in particular, cannot reasonably be thought to oblige
others, further than the natural and real equity of its Precepts agrees with
the Circumstances of other Governments.

The Ceremonial or Ecclesiastical Law is that which prescribes the Religious
Rites and Ceremonies of their Church, which were but Types and Shadows of
something more perfect to succeed them; and Types and Shadows do of their own
accord cease and vanish, when the Substance or Body is introduced: So that the
nature of these Laws set a bound and limit to their obliging Power; and Christ
has not so much dissolved and destroyed, as fulfilled them.

The Law and Prophets are as authentic and divine as ever, and as fit to
oblige us to those Laws, which are built on eternal Principles of Equity; and
so extend themselves as really to us, as ever they did to the Jews. But as for
those other Laws which respected their peculiar Polity in Church and State, and
so were for a certain People, Place, and Time, they are to have their Obliging
Power determined according to those mutable Circumstances.

We must reverence and receive the Holy Scriptures as well of the Old as the
New Testament, for the infallible Word of God, speaking to us with a Divine
Authority, and commanding both our belief and obedience. Si scire vis quid
tenendum sit (says Salvian excellently well, Salvian. l. 3.
speaking particularly of providence) habes sacras literas: perfecta ratio est
hoc tenere quod legeris; If thou would know what is to be holden and
embraced, thou have the Holy Writings for thy direction; and it is perfect
reason to hold and embrace that which thou shall there read. Plus est Deus quam
omnis humana ratio: humana dicta argumentis ac testibus egent, Dei autem sermo
ipse sibi testis est; quia necesse est quicquid incorrupta veritas loquitur
incorruptum sit testimonium veritatis; God is more to thee than all Humane
Reason: Men's words want Arguments and Witnesses; but the Word of God is it self
sufficient Witness to it self: for it is necessary that whatsoever uncorrupted
Truth has spoken, should be an uncorrupted Testimony of Truth.

It Is S. Augustine's Prescription, never to be forgotten by us, S. Aug. contra
Faustum Manich. l. 11. c. 5.
Canonicae Scripturae serviat omnis fidelis and pius intellectus; Let every
faithful and pious Understanding submit it self to the Canonical Scripture; and
therein if any thing shall at any time appear like an absurdity, non licet
dicere, author hujus libri non tenuit veritatem, we may not say, the Author of
this Book missed the Truth, but aut codex mendosus est, aut interpres erravit,
aut tu non intelligis, either the Print or Writing is faulty, or the Translator
and Interpreter mistaken, or thou understandest not: and though we find the
same Truths in other men's Writings as in these, long tamen est impar
authoritas, the Authority is infinitely greater here. Contra Crescon.
And again, speaking elsewhere of the Canonical Books of the Bible, he adds,
Quos omnino judicare non audeamus and secundum quos de caeteris literis vel
fidelium vel infidelium judicamus; These we may not presume or dare at all to
judge; but according unto these we judge of other Writings, whether of
Believers or Infidels. And yet again, Ep. 19. ad Hieron.
in an Epistle of his to S. Hierom; I for my part, says he, have learned to
yield this reverence and honor to those Books only which are called Canonical,
most firmly to believe none of their Authors scribendo aliquid errasse, to have
erred any thing in their writing; but I so read others, that, be they never so
eminent for Piety or Learning, I do not therefore think it true which they
write quia ipsi ita senserunt, because they have so thought and judged, but
because they are able to persuade me of the truth of it vel per illos authors
canonicos vel probabili ratione, either by those Canonical Authors, or some
probable Reason.

A Scripture should be more to us than any Reason; provided only, that we
mistake it not, that we misunderstand it not, that we misapply it not: for we
can have no greater confirmation than Divine Authority. We must therefore take
heed lest at any time we prove irreverent Rejecters of the Word of God, or any
thing propounded to us out of the Holy Scriptures.

Abraham prefers the voice of Moses and the Prophets before the testimony of
one arising purposely from the dead, for the warning of the living. S. Luke
16.31.
If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, says he, neither will they be
persuaded though one arose from the dead. But if once the Law and the Prophets,
Moses and the Prophets find credit, the Old Testament will usher in the belief
of the New, as well as the New confirm and strengthen the belief of the Old.
Had you believed Moses sayings, S. John 5.46.
you would have believed me, says Christ, for he wrote of me. Why! what wrote
he of Christ? This expressly, God shall raise up unto thee a Prophet like unto
me, Deuteronomy. 18.15.
of thy Brethren, according to thy desire; and I will put my words into his
mouth, and whosoever will not hearken unto the words which he shall speak in my
Name, I will require it of him.

I urge the venerable estimation and reception of the Holy Scriptures, from the
force of our Blessed Savior's Argument, For this is the Law and the Prophets.
He backs his Golden Rule and Precept with that Divine and Infallible Authority,
which whoever are found despisers and contemners of, will be sentenced as
rejecters of the Testimony and Commands of God himself; for the Holy Scripture
is no other than his Voice, who has the most absolute Authority over both our
Faith and Obedience. And were there no other Reason or Account to be given of
this Prescription of Christ's, it were abundant proof, That it is Gods
peremptory Command, made known in the Law and Prophets. But then,

Secondly, We may further paraphrase the meaning of our Blessed Savior's
Argument thus; This is the sum of all that the Law and the Prophets require at
our hands. To that purpose S. Chrysostom, See Sect. 1. p. 1.
as I noted in the beginning; The whole Law, in S. Paul's language, (...), Romans
13.9.
is sum'd up into this Sentence, as into an Head, Thou shall love thy Neighbor
as thy self. To this Head he refers expressly all the Commands of the Second
Table that respect our duty to others. For this, says he, Thou shall not
commit Adultery, Thou shall not kill, Thou shall not steal, Thou shall not bear
false witness, Thou shall not covet; and if there be any other Commandment it
is briefly comprehended in this saying, (...), in this namely, Thou shall love
thy neighbor as thy self; which I have showed before to be the inward and
vital Principle of our Savior's Rule. Sect. 4.
To this Second Table therefore some limit and confine the Text. Intelligendum
est de lege and monitis spectantibus mutua inter se hominum officia. Grot. in
loc. Videtur autem hoc praeceptum ad dilectionem proximi pertinere non autem ad
Dei: cum in alio loco duo esse praecepta dicat, in quibus tota lex pendet and
prophetae: cum autem hic non addit tota lex, quod ibi addidit, fervavit locum
alteri praecepto quod est de dilectione Dei. S. Aug. de Sermon. Dom. cit. in Cat.
D. Tho.
It Is to be understood, says Grotius, of the Law, and those Monitions in the
Prophets which concern the mutual Offices of men one toward another. S.
Augustine in like manner: This Precept seems to belong to the Love of our
Neighbor only, and not the Love we owe to God; since that in another place
Christ says, that there are two Commandments upon which hang all the Law and
the Prophets. Now since he adds not here the whole Law, or all the Law, which
he adds there expressly, he has left room for the other Precept of the Love
of God to be supplied.

The Text he refers to is that of S. Mat. chap. 22. where our Savior being
asked, S. Matthew. 22.36. -- 40.
Which is the great Commandment of the Law? answers, Thou shall love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind: This
is the first and great Commandment: And the second is like unto it, Thou shall
love thy Neighbor as thy self. On these Commandments hang all the Law and the
Prophets. (...).
They conspire and meet together in these two; to these two they are reducible.
The Jews themselves called these Summas magnas, Vniversalia magna; the great
Sums, and the great Universals. The first, of the Love of God, can by no means
be omitted; for our Obligations to him are antecedent to all other, and most
considerable. We must therefore have a special respect to the first and great
Commandment: But yet the second too, says Christ, is like unto it, being as
universal and extensive as the former, Quia actus non externos tantum sed in
ternos praecipit and vim suam quam latissime extendit, and priori necessario
nexu cohaeret; propter quam cohaerentiam a Paulo dicitur, de posteriori, quod
Christus de duobus dixit. Grot. in loc.
reaching both the inward and outward man, and inseparably connected with the
former; for which coherence or connection sake, says Grotius, that is spoken by
Paul of this later, which Christ said of them both. For so far may that Phrase
of his reach in his Epistle to the Romans, chap. 13. ["And if there be any
other Commandment,] viz. not only of the Second, but of the First Table.

-- Ut sit vivum ac sensibile corpus, and agnitio Dei necessaria est quasi
caput, and omnes virtutes quasi corpus. -- Vide Lactant. l. 6.
It must needs be granted, that these two great Commandments have that mutual
dependence and tie each to other, that the one necessarily, as it were,
includes, and carries the other along with it. The love of God includes the
love of our Neighbor, and the love of our Neighbor presupposes the love of
God. 1 S. John 4.20.
If a man say, I love God, and hates his Brother, he is a liar, says S. John;
for he that loves not his Brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom
he has not seen? chapter 3.17. How dwells the Love of God in him?
The love of God then includes the love of Man; and the love of Man is used by
the same Apostle as a plain demonstration of our love to God; Beloved, chapter 4.
v. 7, 8.
let us love one another; for Love is of God, and every one that loves is born
of God, and knows God: He that loves not, knows not God, for God is Love.
-- S. Augustine therefore in another place gives a Comment upon the Text
different from his former; (and indeed in his former we may observe that he
spoke but dubiously, and by way of conjecture, with a Videtur only) Therefore,
says he, Ideo Scriptura tantum delectionem proximi commemorat, cum dicit,
Omnia quaecunque -- quia qui proximum diligit consequens est ut and ipsam
praecipue dilectionem diligat. Deus autem dilectio est; consequens est ergo, ut
praecipue diligat Deum. S. Aug de Trin. cit. in Cat. D. Tho sup. Evang.
the Scripture commemorates only the love of our Neighbor, when it says, All
things whatsoever ye would, -- because he that loves his Neighbor, by
consequence must love especially Love it self. But God is Love: And therefore
it is consequent from hence, that he love God especially.

All the Law, Gal. 5.14. (...) --
says S. Paul to the Galatians, is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou
shall love thy Neighbor as thy self. Here is tota Lex, all the Law, in answer
to S. Augustine's former scruple: The whole Law, and that fulfilled in this one
word or sentence, Thou shall love thy Neighbor as thy self.

To this Precept then of the Text we may in a sort refer all the Commands of
the Law and Prophets, even totum hominis, the whole Duty of Man.

The Precepts in the Law and Prophets concern either our Duty to our
Neighbors, to our selves, or unto God.

Now the Offices which respect our Neighbors are here most expressly enjoined,
as has been declared in Particulars. And then,

The Duties respecting our selves are here necessarily presupposed, in as much
as we are presumed to love our selves aright, to be rightly disposed our
selves, that so we may become fit measures of Love and Duty toward others. And
then,

The Duties we owe to God must needs be in like manner included, because we can
neither love our selves nor our Neighbor aright without the love of God.

But besides this, the disposition which this Rule calls for, and works us up
to, naturally leads to the Duties of the First, as well as the Second Table.
For,

(1.) The scope and intendment of it is, that we be as ready to do good, as we
are desirous to receive good; and consequently, we must needs be as ready to do
that for God which he requires of us, as we desire God should be ready to do
for us that which we expect from him; as ready to obey his commands, as we are
to desire a blessing from him.

(2.) The meaning of the Rule is, that we would do to others whatsoever we
would judge reasonable our selves to be done to us were we in their place,
whatsoever we judge befitting their state, quality, and condition; and
consequently, we are necessarily obliged from hence to do all that toward God,
which our Reason and Understanding, rectified by Divine Light, judges becoming
Creatures toward their Creator, Preserver, Redeemer, and continual Benefactor;
Creatures so related unto God as we are, according unto every relation wherein
we stand, whatsoever becomes us as Subjects to our Heavenly Sovereign, as
Servants to our Heavenly Master, as Children to our Heavenly Father.

It Is reasonable, all men being Judges, that the chiefest Good have our
chiefest love and delight; that Truth it self have our firm belief; that
Omnipotence have our chiefest fear and trust; that he from whom we are, and
upon whom we depend, be glorified by us in every capacity, in Body and Soul,
which are his; and that we offer not any such lazy, unbecoming, and irreverent
Devotions and Services to him, which we would blush to bring before our Earthly
Governor.

The Prophet Malachi argues upon this foundation: Mal. 1.6, 8, 14. Deus quoniam
utramque personam sustinet and Patris and Domini; and amare eum debemus quia
filii sumus, and timere quia servi. Lactant. l. 4.
A Son honors his Father, and a Servant his Master: If then I be a Father,
where is mine Honor? and if I be a Master, where is my Fear, says the Lord of
Hosts? And if ye offer the blind for Sacrifice, is it not evil? And if ye offer
the lame and sick, is it not evil? Offer it now to thy Governor, will he be
pleased with thee, or accept thy person, says the Lord of Hosts? And then he
concludes, But cursed be the deceiver, which has in his Flock a Male, but
voweth and sacrifices to the Lord a corrupt thing; for I am a great King,
says the Lord, etc.

He that sits down and considers with himself, what God is, and how he is
related unto God; what God has done for him, and what he expects from God,
will forthwith find within himself an indispensible obligation to all the acts
of Love and Religion toward God, as unquestionably due by the common and
natural Laws of Justice and Gratitude to that excellent Being and Majesty, from
which he has received so much, and expects so much.

This Rule then will plainly oblige us to hate all hypocrisy and double
dealing toward God, which we abominate in men toward our selves; and to be
sincere and upright, before him especially, to whose all-seeing eye all things
are dissected, naked, and open.

To humble our selves in the presence of so Glorious a Majesty, and not to be
vainly puffed up in our minds, since we loath Pride in others, and in those
chiefly whom we have raised to that degree of excellency which they partake of,
when they exalt themselves against us.

To detest in our selves, that disobedience toward God, which we cannot our
selves endure in our Servants and Inferiors. If we weak men, says devout
Salvian, Si nos, qui homunculi imbecilli sumus, contemni tamen a servis nostris
omnino nolumus, quos etsi nobis servitutis conditio inferiores, humana tamen
sors reddit aequales: quam inique utique coelestem Dominum contemnimus, qui cum
homines ipsi simus contemnendos tamen nos a nostrae conditionis hominibus non
putamus? Nisi tanti fortasse consilii ac tam profundae intelligentiae sumus, ut
qui pati injurias servorum nolumus, subditum injuriis nostris Deum esse
velimus, and quae ipsi toleratu humano indigna credimus, Deum a nobis digna
haec tolerare credamus. Salv. p. 79.
will not suffer our selves to be despised by our Servants, who, though
inferior to us in their condition, are yet in a sort equal with us by Nature;
how unjustly do we despise our Heavenly Lord, who being men, do yet think, that
we ought not to be contemned by men of our own nature? Unless it may be we are
of so profound an understanding, that we, who will not suffer the injuries of
our Servants, would yet have God subject unto ours; and can believe that God
will take that well of us, which we think unworthy and unfit to be born with
among men.

And then, since God is beforehand with us in doing of us good, and we are not
able to make him any amends, to benefit him by ought we do, we must needs be
trained up to all possible ways of grateful acknowledgment, thanksgiving and
praise, for his goodness, cheerfulness in his Service, and doing good to
others, the poor and needy, whom God has appointed as his Receivers of that
real good and advantage from us, which he by reason of his All Sufficiency is
not capable of, but yet reputes and accepts of as offered and done to himself.
Prove. 19.17. S. Mat. 25.


There is no danger, you see, of extending the Rule to the utmost. This is the
Law and the Prophets; upon this hang all the Law and the Prophets; in this they
conspire and meet together; to this they may be reduced; in this one saying
they may be comprised and summed up, as in a Comprehensive Head; this is their
quintessence. Micah 6.8.
He has showed thee, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of
thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? And
this thou will be sure to do, if thou do that unto God and Men, which thou
desire to be done unto thy self.

Thirdly, One Gloss more may yet be added. This is the Law and the Prophets; i.
e. This Rule of Moral and Eternal Righteousness is that which they principally
urge, and in reference unto which, in compare with which, they slight and
undervalue all Rites and Ceremonies of Religion, all External Devotions and
Performances whatsoeves. Thus whereas the question was proposed in the Prophet
Micah, Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, verse. 6, 7.
and bow my self before the High God? Shall I come before him with
Burnt-offerings, with Calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with
thousands of Rams, or with ten thousands of Rivers of Oil? Shall I give my
Firstborn for my transgression, and the fruit of my Body for the sin of my
Soul? The Answer is that beforementioned, He has showed thee, O man, what is
good, -- what is eternally good, good in it self and for its own sake, more
eminently good than all outward Oblations and Performances, even the most
costly and precious of them. When this is wanting, God abhors and loathes all
the Pomps and Formalities of Religion: To what purpose is the multitude of your
Sacrifices unto me, Isa. 1.11. to 18.
says the Lord? I am full of the Burnt-offerings of Rams, and the Fat of fed
Beasts; and I delight not in the blood of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of
He-goats. When ye appear before me, who has required this at your hands, to
tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblations, Incense is an abomination unto
me. The New Moons and the Sabbaths, the calling of Assemblies, I cannot away
with it: It is iniquity, even the Solemn Meeting. Your New Mons and your
appointed Feasts my Soul hates; they are a trouble unto me, I am weary to bear
them. And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea,
when ye make many Prayers I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. Wash
you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes:
Cease to do evil, learn to do well; relieve the oppressed, judge the
fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now, and let us reason together, says
the Lord. -- q. d. Otherwise than upon these terms I will have nothing to do
with you, I will not accept of any Offering or Service at your hands.

Jer. 6.20.
To what purpose comes there to me Incense from Sheba, and the sweet Cane from
a far Country? Your Burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your Sacrifices
sweet unto me. They are God's own Words to a People that rejected the
Moralities, which are the chiefest part of his Law, and sought to make a
Compensation by their Ceremonial Worship.

So he speaks by another Prophet; I hate, Amos 5.21, 22, 23, 24.
I despise your Feast-days, and I will not smell in your Solemn Assemblies.
Though you offer me Burnt-offerings and your Meat Offerings, I will not accept
them, neither will I regard the Peace Offerings of your fat Beasts. Take thou
away from me the noise of thy Songs, for I will not hear the melody of thy
Viols. But let Judgment run down as waters, and Righteousness as a mighty
stream.

Jer. 7.22, 23.
I spoke not to your Fathers, says he by the Prophet Jeremiah, nor commanded
them in the day when I brought them out of the Land of Egypt, concerning
Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices; but this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey
my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my People. The thing God
first and principally called for was their Obedience; 1 Samuel 15.22.
Behold to obey is better than Sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of Rams.
Hos. 6.6.
"I desired Mercy, and not Sacrifice, says the Lord; and the knowledge of God
more than Burnt-offerings: A Lesson which our Blessed Savior set the Pharisees
to con over; But go ye, S. Mat. 9.13.
says he, and learn what that means, I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice.

The same thing is most significantly expressed by the Prophet Isaiah, in his
description of a true and counterfeit Fast: Isa. 18.5, 6, 7.
Is it such a Fast that I have chosen, a day for a man to afflict his soul? Is
it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under
him? Will thou call this a Fast, and an acceptable day unto the Lord? Is not
this the Fast that I have chosen, to lose the bands of wickedness, to undo the
heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
Is it not to deal, thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that
are cast out into thy house? when thou see the naked that thou cover him, and
that thou hide not thy self from thine own flesh.

As for those who satisfy themselves in certain Religious Duties externally
performed, and yet delight in their abominations, doing that which is evil and
unrighteous, God says farther by that Prophet, Isa. 66.3.
He that kills an Ox, is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a Lamb, as
if he cut off a Dogs neck; he that burns Incense, as if he blessed an Idol.

I will close these Quotations with that of S. James; S. Jam. 1.27.
Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the
Fatherless and Widow in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from
the world. Those that savored of Judaism placed their Religion in Vestures,
Vide Erasm. Par. in loc.
and Phylacteries, and choice of Meats, and Washings, and long Prayers, and
other Ceremonies (not to be despised as monitory signs of Religion only.) But
that true Piety and Religion which God calls for, and best approves of, is to
be placed in somewhat else: It Is rooted in the heart, and to be otherwise than
thus expressed in the Life, in the worthy Offices of Charity, and a
Conversation untainted with worldly lusts.

Here must be the proof of a pure and undefiled Religion; and this the Law and
Prophets command and call for, before and above all external Rites and
ceremonial Observances, That we preserve Innocence, do Justice, walk in Love,
and act to others as we would be done by our selves. This signanter and
emphatically is the Law and the Prophets. And,

Thus much the Scribe wisely noted upon our Blessed Savior's rehearsal of the
two great Commandments: Well, S. Mark 12.31, 32. To do justice and judgment is
more acceptable to the Lord than Sacrifice, Prove. 21.3. See Ecclus 31.1, 2, 3.
Master, thou have said the truth; for there is one God, and there is none
other but he: and to love him with all the heart, and with all the
understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love
his Neighbor as himself, is more than all whole Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices.

By all these Sacred Bands then we are to look on our selves as indispensably
obliged to the obedience of this Law in all the Branches of it: And we can none
of us henceforward plead ignorance of our duty, since we are instructed from
within our selves, what things it will become us to do. Those who cannot read
the Law and the Prophets, who want Learning, or leisure, as they pretend, for
it, have yet this Summary of them in their own Consciences; and, if they live
not conformably to it, are left without all apology, and cannot choose but be
their own Condemners; in that knowing the judgment of God, Romans 1.32.
as the Apostle speaks, (that they which commit such things are worthy of
death) they not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. Romans
2.1, 3.
Therefore, as he proceeds, thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art,
that judge; for wherein thou judge another, thou condemnest thy self; for
thou that judge do the same things. And think thou this, O man, that
judge them which do such things, and do the same, that thou shall escape
the Judgment of God? ver. 21.22.
Thou which teach another, teach thou not thy self? Thou that preachest a
man should not steal, do thou steal? Thou that say a man should not commit
Adultery, do thou commit Adultery? Thou that abhorrest Idols, do thou
commit Sacrilege? -- Ex ore tuo; out of thine own mouth shall thou be
condemned. I will end all wit^ another sentence of S. Paul, Romans 14.22.
Happy is he that condemns not himself in that thing which he allows.

FINIS.
AN INDEX OF THE CHIEF HEADS OF THE DISCOURSE PRECEDENT.
SECT. I. OF the Illative Particle [Therefore] as referrible, (1.) To the
Precepts of Love and Charity, chapter 5. (2.) The Prohibition against rash judging,
chapter 7. 1, 2, 3. (3.) Most probably to the Discourse about Prayer, from ver. 7.
The effect and success of our Prayers hindered by an evil Life. A further Note
from the ordinary Gloss. From p. 1. to p. 14. SECT. II. The Division of the
Words absolutely considered. The Sub-division of the first Part, viz. The
General and Comprehensive Rule of Righteousness. That it is a Law of Nature,
acknowledged by many of the Heathens as most equitable; the Emperor Severus,
Aristotle, Simplicius, Isocrates, Homer, Hierocles, Horace, Seneca, etc. The
same confirmed by S. Chrysostom and Salvian. The Method to be observed in
speaking to this Rule. P. 14. to p. 36. SECT. III. The Explication of the Rule
negatively, showing, That it is none of those things which some mistake for it,
in seven Particulars. (1.) All things whatsoever other men would have you do to
them, let them do so to you. (2.) All things ye would that men should do to
you, let them do to you. (3.) Do ye to others all things whatsoever they would
have done to them. (4.) All things whatsoever ye will, do ye to others. (5.)
All that you can. (6.) All that you can do with a specious pretense of Law.
(7.) All things whatsoever other men have done to you: Where, of Private and
Public Revenge. P. 36. to 53. SECT. IV. The Positive Explication of the Rule,
(1.) By comparing it with that other Summary of the Second Table, Thou shall
love thy Neighbor as thy self. (2.) By balancing together the Affirmative and
Negative part of it. (3.) By certain Cautions about it. We must not conceive it
in contradiction to any other particular Laws and Orders of Christ. It Is to be
understood of a well-ordered and regular Will. There must be a considerate
Exchange of Persons and Circumstances. Dr. Hammond's enlargement of it to what
we expect from God as well as Men. A Quotation from Seneca to that purpose. The
result of this Explication. P. 53. to 68. SECT. V. An Enquiry made into the
Foundations of this Rule. Two things presupposed in it. (1.) That every man
has a true love and regard to himself. And (2.) That he live in the exercise
of Consideration and Self-reflection. P. 68. to 81. SECT. VI. The
reasonableness of the Precept farther evinced, in three Points. (1.) The actual
equality of all men by Nature, and of Christians by Grace. (2.) The possible
equality of Condition in all. And (3.) The unmovable Standard and Rule of
Justice, which gives all to expect from God and Man here, or at least from God
hereafter, as they have themselves measured unto others. P. 81. to 97. SECT.
VII. An Induction of the Duties we owe to others, reducible to this General
Rule, in seven Particulars. The (1.) Sincerity, uprightness, and integrity of
Behavior, without guile and hypocrisy. (2.) To unplume and divest our selves
of Pride, Arrogance, and Haughtiness, and to be clothed with Humility. P. 97.
to 114. SECT. VIII. (3.) An universal Innocence and harmlesness. That we do no
wrong or injury to any, (1.) In their Persons, Soul, or Body. (2.) In their
Relations. (3.) In their Goods and Possessions. P. 114. to 133. SECT. IX. A
continuance of the same Head, That we are not to wrong others, (4.) In their
Good Name and Reputation, by false-witness-bearing, backbiting, contumelious
speech, countenancing Tale-bearers, harboring evil surmizes, etc. The (4.) In
case of wrong and injury, to make restitution, amends, and satisfaction. P.
133. to 146. SECT. X. (5.) A respective Submission and Obedience to all our
Superiors: Children to their Parents, Servants to their Masters, Subjects to
their Prince, Inferior Magistrates to the Supreme, People to their Ministers.
A Digression of the nature and moment of that Obedience. The Younger to the
Ancient. P. 146. to 173. SECT. XI. (6.) All the Positive Acts of Justice. (1.)
Distributive, in rewarding and punishing. (2.) Commutative, enlarged by these
Instances: (1.) Putting away lying, and speaking the truth. (2.) Equality in
Buying and Selling. (3.) Performance of Words, Promises, Covenants, Contracts,
and Oaths. (4.) Faithfulness in Trusts. Several Trusts specified. (5.) Rendering
Tribute and Custom as due to our Governors. P. 173. to 190. SECT. XII. (7.)
All the Acts of Love and Charity; Particularly, (1.) Pity and Compassion to
those in misery. (2.) Joy and delight in others Happiness. (3.) Forgiveness of
Offenses. (4.) Charitable censures of others failings. (5.) Friendly and
amicable words and Salutations. (6.) Prayer unto God for others. (7.) Doing the
best we can for their real Relief and Supply, by our Liberality and Bounty.
That this Rule engages us to love our Enemies also. P. 190. to 212. SECT. XIII
The second part of the Words, viz. Our Savior's Argument for the enforcing of
this Rule. What meant by the Law and the Prophets. A threefold Gloss on the
Argument. (1.) This is that which the Law and the Prophets do unquestionably
and undeniably call for. (2.) This is the sum and substance of all that the Law
and Prophets require: Where it is demonstrated, That the Rule includes our Love
and Duty toward God, as well as to our Neighbors. (3.) This is that they
principally urge, before and above all External Rites and Ceremonies of
Religious Worship. The Conclusion. P. 212. to
THE END.
