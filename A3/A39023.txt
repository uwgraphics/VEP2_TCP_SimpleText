An Excellent New Playhouse SONG Called, The West-Country Fairing Or* Dicks
Present to Doll Under the Barley Mow.
It Was when the Sheep were shearing,
and under the Barley Mow,
Dick gave to Doll a Eairing,
as she had milk'd her Cow.
Quoth He I fain would wed thee,
and though I cannot woo,
I Have hey pish, hey cock, hey and hey for a Boy,
sing, shall I come kiss thee now,
sling, ah! shall I come, shall I come kiss thee now,
I long sweetheart to Bed thee,
and merrily Buckle too,
with hey pish hey cock, hey and hey for a Boy,
Sing, shall I come kiss thee now,
sing, ah! shall I come, shall I come kiss thee now
Doll seemed not to regard him,
As if she did not care,
Yet simper'd when she heard him,
Like any Millers Mare,
And cunningly to prove him,
And value her Maidenhead,
Cried, fie nay pish, nay fie, and prithee stand by
For I am too young to Wed,
For I am too I am too young to Wed,
(...) said she never could love him,
(...) or any Man else in Bed.
(...) fie pish fie, nay prithee stand by,
(...) I am too young to wed,
(...) I am too* I am too young to Wed.
Like one that's struck with Thunder,
Stood Dicky to hear her talk.
All hops to get her under,
This sad resolve did balk,
At last he swoar, grown bolder,
He Would hire some common-Sow,
For hey pish hey and hey for a Boy,
Sing shall I come kiss the now,
Sing shall I come shall I come kiss thee now,
In loving Arms did fold her,
Ere sneak, and cringe and cry,
With hey pish hey cock hey and hey for a Boy,
Sing shall I come kiss thee now,
Sing ah! shall I come, shall I come kiss thee now,
Convinced other coy Folly,
And stubborn Female will,
Poor Dol grew malancholly,
The Grift went by her mill
hope she cried you are wiser,
Then credit what I have said,
Tho I cry, hey fie, and pish, and prithee stand by,
That I am too young too wed,
That I am too, I am too young to wed,
Bring you the Church adviser,
And dress up the bridal Bed,
Then try, tho I cry fie and pish and prithee stand by
If I am too young to wed,
That I am too, I am too young to wed.
