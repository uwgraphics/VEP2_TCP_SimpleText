BY THE KING.
HIS Majesty taking into His consideration the great vanity and excess in
Apparel, now in use in several sorts and degrees of people, and the great
wast and consumption of Gold, and Silver therein, (at all times very unfit, and
hurtful to particular Persons, and to the Kingdom, but in these times most
insufferable) has taken into His care to provide for the Reformation thereof
in as timely, and as convenient a way as may be, and has thought fit to begin
with His Court, and Armies. And does therefore hereby straightly charg, and
command all Persons of what degree or quality soever, That they or any of them
do not within His Majesty's Court, or Armies, or any the Quarters thereof,
wear on or about there Persons, any Lace-Embroidery, Fring, Riband, Buttons,
Claspes, or Buttons and Loops, of Gold or Silver, or mixed with Gold or Silver,
Cloth of Gold, or Cloth of Silver, or any Cloth or Stuff mixed with Gold or
Silver, or any Embroidery or Lace, called Bone-lace, of Silk, or any Lace
called Bone-lace, or other Laces, Purles, Cut-work, or Needle Work made of
Linnen-threed, nor use or wear any Lace-Embroidery, Fring, Riband, Buttons, or
Buttons and Loops of Gold or Silver, or mixed with Gold or Silver, upon any
Saddle, or Furniture of Horse, from and after two Months from the publication
of this His Proclamation, as they tender His displeasure. In which His Majesty
does not intend to include the mark of Honor, used by the Knights of the Order
of the GARTER, and worn by them upon their Clokes. And of the observance of
this His Proclamation, His Majesty will see there shall be strict notice, and
account taken.

Given at His Majesty's Court at Oxford, the ninth day of June, in the
Nineteenth year of His Reign.
God Save the KING.
