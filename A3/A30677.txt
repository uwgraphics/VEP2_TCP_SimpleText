To the Reader.
CHristian Reader,
when I considered the necessity of Knowledge, and the danger of Ignorance; I
thought it was my duty to teach and instruct those under my charge, especially
in the Fundamental points of Religion; and therefore I set upon the needful,
though much neglected duty of Catechizing, as the likeliest way to ground my
people in the Truth, and to establish them against Error. But after diverse
years experience, I found not the desired effect of my labors; many
(especially of the elder sort) complained, the Catechism that I taught (which
was the Assemblies) was too hard, and long, that they had not time to learn it,
nor memories to retain it. Now to leave these men without excuse, I have drawn
up the chief heads of Religion, in as short a compass and plain a manner as I
well could; not that I would hereby discourage any from learning the other
(which questionless is well worth their labor, it being the exactest that is
extant) but my desire is to encourage those to learn this, which otherwise
would learn none at all: if thou reap any benefit by it, Bless God with me, who
remain

Thine for thy souls good, E. B.
