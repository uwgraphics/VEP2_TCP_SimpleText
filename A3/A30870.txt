To the READER.
I Think it fit to acquaint thee that several Ciphers and other Papers of
Secret Writing which were many years since plundered from the Author of the
following Tracts, came shortly after to my hands, and have lain long by me to
little purpose; for notwithstanding his Publication of the following Discourse
thereof, my great pains to make some progress therein came to nothing until he
in his second Edition gave the Learner Directions how to proceed: Since th^n I
have made out his methods, and thereby understand his ingenious Con^rivements
of the Alphabets, and how he thereby Ciphers and Decyphers secret Concernments;
and in the first place I lead thee by the hand from familiar Examples, and the
beginnings of that Art (as I find them in his Papers) to the sublime
curiosities thereof, which in my opinion will be to thee a service very
acceptable; and being I have no ends beyond the kindness I owe to common
capacities, and the public, I hope to meet with a general pardon both from the
great Masters of that rare Art, and from all others, and the rather, because I
conceive it cannot be prejudicial to matters of State for every ordinary person
to be able to conceal his own Concerns in a Character only legible to himself,
and that no man in a condition where the managery of the Pen is requisite, but
may have occasion to lay by something secretly to prevent intrusion into his
private affairs. I mean well to all, and so consequently have the less to
account for: but however I am concluded, I shall shortly (if I live) be

Thy more useful Friend G. B.

ACcording to my undertaking I shall Illustrate this Art in its Originals by
easy Examples (of which I lately thought my self as ignorant as any that are
to learn) and from thence show how the Authors Contrivements from time to time
still rendered the same more intricate and recluse to the Inquisitor, till Art
(in the Conclusion) shut Art (in the disquisition) out a doors.

First write down the Alphabet thus a b c d e f g h i k l m n o p q r s t u w x
y z

Now suppose I were to send the Watchword (or any other secret) to a
Confederate, viz. God with us. To change the Letters of those words into
contrary Characters not to be understood (in case of interception) but by the
Confederate; I agree with him upon a Clavis or Key, so called because those
Letters are to be thereby first eypher'd, locked, or infolded to distract the
sense; and then to be decypher'd, unfolded or unlockt and made legible to the
Confederate only, viz.

Let the Clavis or Key be 2 3 4 5 -- which must be placed over the secret to be
cypher'd, locked, or infolded thus 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 2 2 34 5234 52 God with us


God with us and continued, if the clause were longer, so long as there is a
Letter to be locked, as will hereafter be more perspicuous.

Then I begin and say the second Letter from G (forwards toward the right
hand) is I the third from O is R the fourth from D is H the fifth from W is B
the second from I is L and so proceeding in that order, those words will be
comprehended in these Letters irhblxmau

Then the Confederate to unlock those Letters must place the Key over them 2 3
4 5 2 3 4 5 2 thus viz. irhblxmau and say the second Letter from I (backwards
toward the left hand) is G the third from R is O the 4th. from H is D etc. by
which means the intended sense is easily understood, which without the Key
cannot be legible to any but the Confederate; and so by different Keys, and one
of the following Ciphers a correspondence may be maintained with all manner of
persons or every man may infold his own secrets thereby at pleasure.

Another Easy and familiar way thus:

Set down the Alphabet twice, first in a direct order then indirectly or in
verse, viz.

a b c d e f g h i k l m n o p q r s t u w x y z z y x w u t s r q p o n m l k
i h g f e d c b a

And to lock the former words ( God with us) take each Letter opposite to the
Letters to be locked, viz. for G an S for O an L for d a W etc. and the Letters
in the words to be locked will be comprehended in these Letters slwdqfreg then
to unlock them for s take G for L an O for W a D and the words will be soon
returned to their first predicament. But the Author not much applauding this
method as conceiving it not sufficiently secure against an artificial
scrutitiny, I shall quit that and touch upon his next which is more safe and
concise.

In his second Edition between the first and second Ciphers, page 54. he lays
down an easy method for unlocking the lines affixed to those Ciphers (and some
of those that follow^ and I must confess my self much delighted in those
Contrivements, but because they are (by his directions there) obvious to the
meanest capacities, I only hint that method and proceed to his next which is
more ready and pleasant, and shall demonstrate the same by his sixth Cipher,
page 61. and afterward more concisely by an excellent Cipher of his now in my
custody. But before I show the order of the work, I must frame that sixth
Cipher a new, for I conceive he has purposely disordered the Letters in their
ranks to perplex the inquisitor.

t l m n o p q r s t u m n o p q r s t u w n o p q r s t u w x o p q ^ s t u w x
y p q r s ^ u w x y z

Admit the words to be locked the same as in the former Examples, viz. God with
us, and the Key to be 975 836412 and the work will stand thus 975 836412

God with us then (by the left hand square) say the 9th. from g (in the first
line toward the right hand) is Q the 7th. from O is w the 5th. from D is I and
so proceed, and those words will be represented in these Letters, viz. q
wiemamwu, where note that the words which consist of 9 Letters are represented
by 7 for w represents o and u and m represents I and H and q and i and e and a
and u represents g and d and t and S which is very difficult if at all possible
to be discovered if intercepted. To unlock those Letters the work must stand

975836412

thus, viz. q wiemamw u then look q in the outermost line in the square on the
right hand and the 9th. Letter from that toward the left hand (in the same
square) is g the 7th. from W is O the 5th. from i is d and after that order
those Letters will be b^ought to their first predicament.

This Cipher and the Example from thence cannot but be highly delightful to the
Learner, but that which I formerly mentioned to be in my Custody, and which I
shall next insert will, by the Example illustrating the same, appear a very
rare Curiosity.

Under this Cipher I found the Example set down, but no Directions thereon, nor
could I possibly find out the contrivement till I met with the Authors
Directions in the second Edition of the following Tracts, as I formerly hinted.

The method is the same as in the last, viz. beginning at the utmost line
toward the left hand, I say the 9th. from D (toward the right hand in a
direct line) is N the first from I is K the 8th. from I is R which produces
the letters above specified, then to unlock them begin at the utmost line on
the right hand and say the 9th. from N (toward the left hand in a direct line)
is D the first from K is I the 8th. from R is I, and by that method the letters
will be restored to their first sense; and I conceive he holds this Cipher
sufficiently safe for enfolding any secret, and proves that 50l. worth of Paper
will not contain the variations in a Clavis of 8 places.

You may now find the Clavis to the 6 Cipher (the inward sense being Honos alit
Arts) to be 77873655295394 which is locked and unlockt by the last method, by
which the Key to the inward sense in the 7th. Cipher may be most easily found
out, and the words locked and unlockt likewise.

The 9th. Cipher I find to be a variety of another nature, and the words to be
infolded by a literal Clavis (a Key of Letters) viz. thus performed deadeade
ade homicida est the words are to be locked are homicida est, and the Clavis is
de a, look H in one of the lines opposite to the Capitals C D and the next
letter under it is t, then look O in one of the lines opposite to the (...) E
f, and the next letter under it is D, do so in the rest and the words to be
locked will be represented by the letters tdzunnyrgi, to unlock which set the
Clavis over them, and look t in one of the lines opposite to the Capitals C D
and the next letter under I is H, then look D in the lines opposite to the
Capitals E f and the next letter under D is O and so in the rest.

Amongst those Papers so falling into my hands as aforesaid, are several Tables
and Squares in order to distinct compliances by a Diurnal, a Bill of petty
Expenses, Letters of common discourse and the like, too crabbed for my
capacity; also two papers, the one containing a discourse of the power of
Numbers, and the other of Secret Writing by Waters and Juices, both which are
inserted as follows.

The word CAROLUS may be made differently out of these Letters 3583 1808 times
and no more

ssssssssssss
Here are 7 different letters each 12 times repeated, the rule to know the
varieties is this:

Set down the Number 12 seven times, and multiply those 7 twelves continually,
the product gives the varieties required.

Quod sat sit (sors) da, sed ne post tu rap^ de me;
Sin te sic men's fert, vae m^! nec fas neque jus vis.
This Distick is variable 1144000727777607680000 ways, the words rape and
neque standing always as they are. But if they change places (as they may
once) then the former number of varieties will be doubled thus
2288001455555215360000. Those written in all varieties according to 6 Verses or
3 Disticks in the depth of an inch, each Verse 3 inches long, would fill a roll
of Paper of 3 inches breadth 62444484876533760000 feet long, whose weight would
make 99857918246056 of our ordinary Cart loads. The length of that roll will
compass

The Body of the Earth*

492769766939

times about.

The Sphere of the first stars according to the greatest allowance of it 8212

times about.

Upon the sphere of the fixed stars that roll would make Meridians and
Pa^alle^s to every degree and of minutes besides Circles of Longitude and
Latitude upon the same sphere, to every degree and 1/10; of minutes, with
Almicanthars and Azimuths above the Horison to every of a degree and circles of
position to every degree both above and below the Horison.

The superficial quantity of it would cover all over the face of the Earth 3055
times the just sphere of the ^ when she is in her Perig^^m.

If the former roll were rolled up close together, the Semidiameter of the flat
made by it would exceed the Semidiameter of the Earth by 10826 miles.

The same paper would be worth 7592043421779142 allowing 50 sheets for 6d. id
est 8 sheets for a penny.

The Ink that should write the varieties would load 27159778763 Carts and would
fill a pool of 1 74 /100 foot depth as broad as the whole Mediteranean Sea, or
a pool as broad as all England, whose depth is 42 65 / 100 feet, which Ink
(according to the ordinary price of 3d. per pint) would be worth 5741577230
5623 l. or the former quantity of Ink would make up a River of two miles
breadth and 47 feet depth, whose length would compass the whole Globe of the
Earth,

And if for these two words ( Rape and Neque) were placed 4 short
Monosyllables, then the former varieties would yet be made 12 times so many,
namely, 26976017466662584320000 which would be the greatest number of varieties
that could possibly be in one Distic.

The rest of the Discourse is in shorthand and Algebraical Characters, which I
cannot make out.

Invisible Writing by Waters, etc.
DIssolve Vitriol in boiling water, and when it is clear write therewith, dry
the same gently at the fire (or let it dry at leisure, which it will soon do)
and the writing will be invisible; when you would return it boil Galls in white
wine; dip a feather in the liquor and wipe it over the writing, and it will
suddenly burst ^ d 43. page of the foll^^^^g (...).
out like lightning from a cloud.

Dissolve Allom in water and write upon white linen or sarcenet, the writing
will immediately vanish and not so much as a hair stroke appear. To return the
w^iting dip it in water, the linen will be darkened and the Letters be legible
(and invi^ble again when the linen's day) or hold it to the fire and it will
produce the same effect, but then the letters will vanish no more.

Write upon a stone with the fat of a Goat dissolved, the letters when dry will
be illegible; dip the stone in distilled Vinegar and the writing will be
apparent.

Pulverize Galls and Virriol and the gum of Juniper, strew it on your paper and
rub it hard thereon with a cloth, then polish it with a Boa^s tooth or have of
a knife, write your secret upon that paper with fair water or spittle, and the
letters by degrees will appear black and legible, the sooner if you wear the
paper at your breast between your shirt and doublet.

Write with the juice of Citrons, Orenges, Lemons, Onions, or any other sharp
juices, hold your writing to the fire and their acrimony will be presently
discovered, and will show forth those Colors that they would upon the tree
when they are ripe. If you write with the juice of sour Grapes the writing will
appear black, juice of Cherries added to Calamus will produce a green, to
Sow-bread a red, etc.

Pulverize Sal Ammoniack and dissolve it in water, when the water is clear
write therewith and the writing will be soon invisible, hold it to the fire and
it will immediately grow black and legible.

Take distilled Vinegar, the white of an Egg, and Quicksilver, stir them well
together, write what you would have concealed, and to return it scorch the
paper upon a hot fire-shovel till it look blackish, and the writing will appear
white and legible.

Soak Gum Traganth in water and therewith mingle white Lead, spread it all over
your paper, write thereon with a point of Iron or Silver, and you cannot
discern what is written but by holding the paper between your eye and the light
of a candle.

Write upon the hidden parts of the body, viz. Back, Arms, or other Limbs with
Urine or distilled Vinegar, and you may return the writing by gently rubing the
places with the ashes of burnt straw or paper.

Tithymals. If you make letters with Fat, Tallow, or any fatty substance, or
with Gum or Milk of a Fig Tree, the dust of cole or burnt paper will return the
writing. Pliny says the Milk of Tithymals will do the like, Ovid confirms
this, admonishing Maids in his Art Ama^di, how they may safely write to their
sweethearts.

Tuta quoque est, fallitque oculos ^ lacte recenti
Littera, carbonis polline tange, leges:
Fallit and humiduli quae fiet acumine lini,
Et feret occultas pura tabella notas.
Write with new Milk its safe, unseen, but read
The writing with cole-dust laid on full right:
Moist slax will write as if that none had been,
And Letters on your paper pass the sight.
Dissolve Gum Arabic, or Gun Traganth in water, let the water be clear and you
may write upon crystal or glass, and the ashes of burnt straw or paper will
return the writing.

Rub your paper with a liquor made of Goats Suet and Turpentine dissolved, when
you write lay upon that another paper smeared with fat, write thereon with an
Iron or Silver point, and the impression thereof will be upon the first paper
invisible till you strew dust thereon.

Stir the white and yolk of an Egg together that it may be liquid as Ink, write
your secret therewith, then dry the paper and write over those Letters (with
s^^aw-dust or Lamp black ground with Vinegar) any common discourse; and when
you would return the first writing scrape off the second, and the first will
appear white.

With any of the former waters you may write upon an Egg, a smooth board, or
Ivory, as upon paper; and you may convey a Letter in an Egg thus. Put the Egg
in sharp Vinegar three or four hours, when you find it soft open the shell with
the edge of your knife, then roll up your Letter in a small roll and put it in,
afterward soak the Egg in cold water and the shell will grow hard as formerly.
If you find that part of the shell you open subject to discovery, mix a little
lime and gum and you may stop it neatly.
