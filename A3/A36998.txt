A NEW COLLECTION OF SONGS AND POEMS.

By Thomas D'urfey, Gent.

LONDON: Printed for Iosoph Hindmarsh, at the Black Bull in Cornhill: 1683.

A Song made to a Tune, by the command of a Lady of Quality.
^
AT the foot of a Willow close under the
^
shade, Young Celion and Silvia one evening
^
were laid, the Youth pleaded strongly for
^
fruits of his Love, but honor had forced
^
her his flame to reprove, she cries, where is
^
the Luster when Clouds shade the Sun? or
^
what is brisk Nectar the taste being gone?
^
in flowers on the stalks sweetest Odours do
^
dwell, but if gathered the Rose is, it loses
^
the smell.
II.
Thou fairest of Nymphs the bold Shepherd replied,
If ere thou will argue, begin on Love's side;
In matters of State let dull reasons be shown,
But Love is a power will be swayed by his own;
Nor should a Coy Beauty be counted so rare,
For scandal can blast both the Chaste and the Fair;
Most fierce are the joys Love's Alembick does fill,
And the Roses are sweetest when put to the Still.
The Bully, a Song in the Fool turned Critic, set by Mr. Lock.
I.
ROom, Room, Room for a man oth' Town
That takes delight in roaring,
That daily rambles up and down,
And spends his Night in Whoring;
That for the Modish name of Spark
Dares his Companions rally,
Commits a Murder in the dark,
Then sneaks into an Alley.
II.
To every Female that he sees
He swears he bears affection,
Disdains all Law, Arrests, or Fees,
By help of a protection;
At last intending worser wrongs
By some resenting Cully,
He Is decently whipped through the Lungs,
And there is an end of Bully.
A Song in Madam Fickle, set by Mr. Turner.
1.
BEneath a shady Willow, near
A River's Purling streams,
Astrea careless of her Sheep
With folded Arms lay fast asleep,
Possessed with Golden Dreams,
Her working faculty's supplied
What drowzy sleep denied:
For often she would smile, and sigh, and grasp the Air,
Thinking her much loved Celadon was there.
2.
But as this sleeping harmless Maid
Lay rapt in silent joy,
Possessing all that could be sought
In fettered senses happy thought,
Her Swain came Fishing by:
He eager to enjoy the bliss,
Awaked her with a Kiss;
She Blushing rose, and cried unhapy Fate,
Ah Celadon thou now art come too late.
A Song on Dorinda going in a Barge up the Thames.
1.
BRight was the Morning, cool was the Air,
Serene was all the Sky,
When on the Waves I left my dear,
The Center of my Joy;
Heaven and Nature smiling were,
And nothing fad but I.
2.
Each Rosy Field did Odours spread,
All Fragrant was the shore;
Each River God rose from his Bed,
And sighed and owned her power:
Curling their Waves they decked their head,
As proud of what they bore.
3.
So when the fair Egyptian Queen
Her Hero went to see,
Cidnus swelled over his Banks in pride
As much in love as he:
Cidnus swelled, etc.
4.
Glide on ye waters, bear these Lines
And tell her how distressed,
Bear all my sighs ye gentle winds
And waft 'em to her Breast,
Tell her if e're she prove unkind,
I never shall have rest.
Celia's Victory, a Song made at Epsom, and set by Mr. Farmer.
I.
BOast no more fond Love thy power,
Or thy passion sweet and sower,
Bow to Celia, show thy duty,
Celia sways the world of Beauty;
Venus now does kneel before her,
And admiring Crowds adore her.
II.
Like the Sun that guilds the Morning
Celia shines, but more adorning;
She like fate can wound a Lover,
Angel like too can recover;
She can kill or save from dying,
When the Ravished soul is flying.
III.
Sweeter than the blooming Rose is,
Whiter than the falling Snow is;
Then such eyes the great Creator,
Chose as Lamps to kindle Nature;
Cursed is he that can refuse her,
Ah hard fate that I must loose her.
Chloe's Complaint, a Song set by Mr. Farmer.
I.
LOng I Have been wounded, but never durst
complain,
Long, long have been fettered yet still hug the
Chain;
Long cruel Parents have tortured my Love,
And Fate long has strove the dear flame to remove;
But still like a Rock against the Tide and the
Wind
I fix, let the Torrent prove never so unkind;
And whilst my Silvander pursues his desire,
I still bear the Tinder and he the Fire.
II.
The wise may dull Reasons and Morals propose,
And clog my sick fancy with Precepts like those;
But ah how in vain how vainly they preach,
Great Love surmounts all that their reason can
teach;
Love the great Agent that Nature employs,
The God of our Passions and source of our Joys;
Without whom we soul-less and wretched should
prove,
For Mortals are Beasts till refined by Love.
A Song set to an Excellent Tune of Monsieur Baptist.
I.
BId the Spring that is now a coming
Keep the Virgin Budds from blooming;
Bid the Deer forbear the Fountains,
Or the Snow the Tops of Mountains;
Bid the Stormy Winds leave blowing,
Or the Sea its ebb and flowing;
All these wonders may be doing
Far sooner than to move,
To move,
To move
My constant Love.
II.
So short is our life's sweetest minute,
That we lose it whilst we win it;
For if lasting were the Passion,
Who! ah! who would heed Salvation?
All the Joys that Heaven Created,
All our sorrows are abated;
The dear bliss makes every Lover rated
A Deity and more,
And more,
Much more
By Beauties power.
IMMORTAL LOVERS.
^
IMmortal Lovers smile, and run your
^
hap-py Races, possess the pleasing toil of
^
languishing Embraces, let Zealots prate
^
of Joys above, they know not how nor
^
where, we know a Paradise in Love and
^
take no further care.
A Song Sung to the King and Queen upon Sir John Moor's being Chosen Lord Mayor.
I.
ALl Hail to great Caesar, Loved Monarch,
That Three Mighty Kingoms do sway,
All Hail Gloriana,
The Lands Arcana,
The Brightest Planet in Loves Milky way.
II.
Long, long have the story's of Plottings and
Treasons
Assisted our fears,
The Whigs and the Tories in Mutiny join,
Like a new Civil War:
But now Ignoramus
No more shall shame us,
Dissolved and quelled by a Loyal Lord Mayor.
III.
No more shall the furies possess the dull Crowd
With Distraction and Care,
No more shall the Jurys excuse 'em High Treason
To show what they dare:
No more shall Professors,
Affront the Addressors
Since London now has a Loyal Lord Mayor.
IV.
Then welcome Great Caesar, and welcome the Praetor
That now rules the Chair,
Our hearts with a pleasure do Crown the swift Minutes
Of this happy year:
For it is strange in the City,
The more is the pity,
To see, to see a Loyal Lord Mayor.
The Second Song in Sir Barnaby Whigg, to the Tune of the Delights of the
Bottle.
I.
FArewell my loved science my former delight,
Moliere is quite riffled, then how should I write;
My fancy's grown sleepy, my quibling is done,
And design or Invention alas I have none;
But still let the Town never doubt my Condition,
Though I fall a damned Poet I Will mount a Musician.
II.
I got fame by filching from Poems and Plays,
But my Fidling and drinking has lost me the Bays;
Like a fury I railed, like a Satyr I writ,
Thersites my humor, and Fleckno my wit;
But to make some amends for my snarling and lashing,
I divert all the Town with my Thrumming and Thrashing.
The Serenade, a Song in the Injured Princess or a fatal wager, set by Captain
Pack.
I.
THe Larks awake the drouzy morn,
My dearest lovely Chloe rise,
And with thy dazzling Rays adorn
The Ample World and Azure Skies:
Each eye of thine out-shines the Sun,
Though decked in all his light,
As much as he excells the Moon,
Or each small twinkling Star at Noon,
Or Meteor of the Night.
II.
Look down and see your Beauty's power,
See, see the heart in which you reign;
No Conquered slave in Triumph bore
Did ever wear so strong a Chain:
Feed me with smiles that I may live,
I Will never wish to be free;
Nor ever hope for kind Reprieve,
Or Loves grateful bondage leave
For Immortality.
A Song to a very Beautiful but very Proud Lady, set by Mr. Farmer in two
Movements.
I.
CHloe, your scorn abate, kind beams discover,
Frowns purchase all men's hate, but gain no Lover;
Nature and Feature designed you rare.
But whilst you are proud you are not fair;
Nor can the joys of Passion prove,
For Pride is still a foe to Love.
II.
To Courts where Tyrants sway, who will venture thither?
Or who will put to Sea in Stormy weather?
Faces and Graces no luster own,
When shaded by disdainful frown;
Never to the Sun had the Persian bowed,
Had he hid his bright Glories behind a Cloud.
Second Movement.
But when the Bottles roll about and Glasses,
Plague on all Intrigues, and pox on charming faces;
But when the Bottles roll about and Glasses,
We know no disdain, nor value Charming faces;
Let the puney Lover sigh and whine and moan,
Like a fluttering drone, make an Insect humming;
Beauty here we see, more bright than any she,
Never out of humor, kind and always coming.
Scotch Song in the Royalist, made to a Pleasant new Tune.
I.
Two bonny Lads were Sawney and Iockey,
Blithe Iockey was loved but Sawney unluckie;
Yet Sawney was tall, well-favour'd and witty,
But Ise in my heart thought Iockey more pretty;
For when he viewed me, su'd me, wooed me,
Never was Lad so like to undo me;
Fie, I cried, yet almost died,
Lest Iockey should gang, and come no more to me.
II.
Iockey would Love, but he would not Marry,
And Ise had a dread least I should miscarry;
For his cunning Tongue with Wit was so gilded,
That I was afraid my heart would have yielded;
Daily he blessed me, pressed me, kissed me,
Lost was the hour methought when he missed me;
Crying, denying, and sighing, I Would woo him,
But ah! much ado had I to gang fro him.
III.
But cruel Fate robbed me of this Jewel,
For Sawney would make him fight in a Duel,
And down in a Dale with Cypress surrounded,
Ah! there to his death poor Iockey was wounded;
But when he thrilled him, felled him, killed him,
Who can express my grief that beheld him!
Raging, I tore my Hair to bind him,
And vowed, and swore, I Would never stay behind him.
Kingston Church, a Song.
I.
SWeet use your time, abuse your time
No longer, but be wise;
Your Lovers now discover you
Have Beauty to be prized;
But if you are Coy you will loose the joy,
So Cursed will be your Fate,
The flower will fade, you will die a Maid,
And mourn your chance too late.
II.
At Thirteen years and Fourteen years
The Virgins heart may range,
'Twixt Fifteen years and Fifty years
You Will find a wondrous chance;
Then whilst in Tune in May and June,
Let Love and Youth agree;
For if you stay till Christmas day
The Devil shall woo for me.
The Mistress, a Song made to an Excellent Scotch Tune.
COme all ye smiling Loves
That grace the Throne of Beauty,
Adorn the virdant Groves
Where Charming Celia lies;
To her the Virgins round
Pay homage, zeal and duty,
With Heaven her face is Crowned,
And Fate sits in her eyes.
II.
A Thousand Shepherds wait upon her,
Thousands she refuses still,
Though at her feet they ly,
And languish pine and die;
A too too rigid point of Honor,
Which her virtue uses still,
Makes wretched all the Plains,
And Murders all the Swains.
III.
See where Loves Monarch goes
To watch the Dazzling Creature,
For fear her eyes should close,
And shroud the World in shades,
Possess her with my Woes,
Thou mighty God of Nature;
Tell her the sweetest Rose
The Blast of Time will fade.
IV.
Inspire her to believe my Passion,
And receive the truest Love,
That ever found a part
In any Virgins heart;
Ah! tell her Pride is out of fashion,
Beauty should divinely prove,
Like Heaven that mercy pays
To the meanest wretch that prays.
A Song made to a Tune for the L. G.
SHining Stars are Celia's eyes,
Sweet Roses bloom in either Cheek,
Love from those his flame supplies,
From these does sweet Odor seek;
Every Grace that decks her face
Shows her of more than mortal race;
Every charm does so control,
That she like Heaven forms the soul;
Soft as down each outward part,
But, ah! no Marble like her heart.
To Astrea.
I.
HOW long my dearest Astrea, how long
Must Celadons Love be delayed?
You know that my passion though vigorous and strong,
If kept from fruition will fade
And perish like flies in the shade;
And when Icy Age does our Battlements storm,
Our wishes can give us no power to perform.
II.
The blosoms that now on the stalk looks so gay,
Is withered often by an ill Air,
The Beauty that now looks splended as May,
Will perish through sickness or care,
Such destiny follows the fair:
Then use your best Minutes to Love and be kind,
For time never leaves any Beauty behind.
A Song in the Royallist to the King, set by Doctor Blow.
^
THE great Augustus like the

Weeds with splendour shon; yet all the

Fruits of his bright influence was an ill

Odor, nauseous to the sense; long

slighted they his grace and love, his

rude Ancients that affronted Jove, because

A Panegyric on their Royal Highnesses, and Congratulating his Return from
SCOTLAND.
WHen the most high Eternal Son of God
Through famed Judea in Procession Rode;
The Loyal Publican with zealous have
Climbed up a Tree to view him as he past;
And with a look that did his joy relate,
The Mighty Savior did Congratulate;
So amongst the Crowds that with impatience Strove
T'express their fealty and faithful Love,
I and my throbbing heart with equal flames
Panted and pressed to meet the Godlike JAMES,
Welcome then mighty Sir, welcome as peace
To Conquered Nations, or to sick men ease;
Welcome as what you bring us, Loyalty,
A fruit which in our Isle we rarely see;
In th'barren North it blooms to storms exposed,
But in our Sunny Climate never grows;
Here fertile Nature makes the Commons Kings,
And from her fatness rank Rebellion springs;
Damned Lust of English men, that never repented
Their Treason, nor with Blessing were contented.
Black was the day and blasted was the year
When the Cursed factions full of wretched fear;
Sought the true Heir of England to exclude
Only because he was too Great and Good;
Two Epithetes that never yet could suit
The sordid mind of your true English Brute;
Loud Tempests roared as if designed to cross
The Royal Mandate and not let him pass,
Whilst weeping Floods seemed to mourn our loss;
And as each Element then bore a part
In grief, even so did every Honest Heart;
But now the happy hours are fully blessed,
The Land with the full store of Heaven Possessed;
The Season smiles and each propitious ray
For his return their secret joy display;
The Flowers that did in private Clossets keep,
And during the Winter of his Absence sleep
Bloom out, and a gay fragant Robe put on
To bless and welcome in the Rising Sun;
Laetamur, The Motto of the medal.
is the word, a word which late
As mighty hopes did mighty joy create;
When the famed Motto with applause was put
To the Effigy of the Grand Patriot;
Nearest their hearts, where late their Georges hung,
The Palefac't Medal with a silver Tongue
Was placed, whilst every wearer still expressed
His joy to Harbor there so famed a guest;
The wretch that stamped it got immortal fame,
'Twas coined by stealth like Groats at Brumicham:
Whilst each Professor with exalted voice,
Cries Englands saved, and now let us Rejoice.
But though seditious Tenets they pursue,
We have a cause of joy solid and true,
And therefore let us cry Laetamur too.
For Mighty YORK's returned, returned to Reign
Over hearts, and move in his Great Sphere again;
It Is in his face you see the Rising Sun,
T'other's a Comet blazing over the Town;
Portending mischiefs, seeming to explain,
The former Tragic Scene designed again;
Fly then ye Loyal Natives, fly with zeal,
Embrace his knees and your true joy reveal;
Prove your Affection to your Injured Prince,
Give him your hearts, for you had his long since,
Aid his true cause, oppose the Rebel power,
And never part with your loved Hero more.
And hail bright Princess best of thy fair kind,
An Angels body with an Angels mind,
Beauteous as are the Virgin Saints above,
That sit and smile on the Right hand of Jove:
And good as the first state heaven formed 'em in,
E're that Angelick Sex knew how to sin;
How when she comes, shall we our Crimes atone?
How shall we meet the Justice of her frown?
That doing no offense was forced away
With her dear Lord a cruel fate to obey,
And sacrifice her Joy, her Peace and Fame
To a cursed branded thing without a Name,
Down her fair face the liquid Treasures rolled,
Then taking on her Royal Partner hold,
England farewell, she cried, thou hated shore,
And may I never see thy baseness more:
But she comes back and nobly may despise
The Pigmy malice of her Enemies;
Disdain and Anger in her forehead sit,
Yet both so calmed and tempered by her wit,
That with a modest smile she strives to oppose
Revenge, and only pities all her Foes.
Return then and forgive, and may your Name
Charm the wide Globe as does your Hero's Fame:
Long may ye love, and still may ye appear
Teeming, as to our joy you prove this year,
Your Pregnant veins are framing wondrous things,
Oh Glorious Passion that creates young Kings!
The illustrious Infant struggles in the Womb,
As if he knew his Royal Fate (...) come;
And silently mourns that so long a space
'T will be e're he begins his Glorious Race:
But when as the divinest gift of Heaven,
The Princely Babe is for our comfort given;
May every heart conspire with every Tongue
TO implore his years may be renowned and long,
That he may merit his brave Fathers name,
And rival Virtue with his Mothers fame.
Methinks I see our great Augustus stand,
With the fair Princess smiling in his hand;
High Grandeur mixed with joy adorns his face,
Whilst blushing duty hers does sweetly grace:
Their Eyes are fixed and mingling glories seem
Like the Suns Rays reflecting on a Jem,
His awful light then on his Brother shines,
Who with a silent modesty inclines
To hear his welcome, and with humble grace,
Fixing his Eyes upon his Monarchs face,
His willing knees with Loyal duty bend
To his dear King, his Brother and his Friend,
Who in his arms does the loved Favorite hold,
And speaks a Gracious welcome from his Soul.
Thrice happy Scotland, well did thou begin
To make atonement for thy former sin;
When thou with joy a Virtue did embrace
By brooding Factions driven from this place,
Well was the much wronged Prince received by thee,
And well ha^^ thou reformed thy Loyalty;
Yet to his goodness thou thy fame do owe,
For thou had faithless bin had he been so;
But as the Thracian Bard with Charming strains,
Drew the wild Savages from Woods and Plains,
Controlled their Brutish rage where e're he came,
And made the fiercest Wolves and Tigers tame;
So mighty Prince thy virtue did oppose
The close designs and malice of thy Foes,
And made a Nation famed for Treachery
Bow to thy Loyal Principles and thee;
Whilst England's left with its King-killing race,
A nest of Rebels as it ever was.
A Song in the Fond Husband in the praise of Marriage, set by Mr. Turner.
I.
UNder the Branches of a spreading Tree,
Silvander sat from care and danger free;
And his inconstant roving humor shows
To his dear Nymph, that sung of Marriage vows;
But she with flowing graces Charming Air,
Cries fie, fie, my dear give over,
Ah, tempt the powers no more,
But thy offense with penitence repair;
For though vice in a Beauty seem sweet in thy Arms,
An Innocent Beauty has always more Charms.
II.
Ah, Philida! the angry Swain replied,
Is not a Mistress better than a Bride?
What Man that universal yoke retains,
But meets an hour to sigh and curse his chains?
She smiling cries, change, change that impious mind,
Without it we could prove,
Not half the joys of Love,
It Is Marriage makes the feeling bliss divine:
Then all our life long we from scandal remove,
And at last fall the Trophies of honor and Love.
An Epitaph on Dorinda.
IN this cold Monument lies one,
That I know who has lain upon;
(The happier he) whose sight would charm,
And touch would frozen Hermits warm:
Lovely as the Dawning East,
Was this Marbles frozen guest,
As Glorious and as bright as day,
As Odoriferous as May;
Whom I admired as soon as knew,
And now her memory pursue
With such a superstitious lust,
That I would ravish even her dust;
She all perfection had in store,
Beauty, as if designed a Whore;
Or, as if Nature in her face
Designed dull virtue to disgrace;
Civil she was and young, and wise,
And in her calling so precise,
That industry had made her prove
The kissing School-mistress of Love:
But Death Ambitious to become
Her Pupil leaves his Ghastly home,
And seeing how we used her here,
The rawbon'd Rascal Ravished her;
Who pretty soul resigned her Breath,
To practice Letchery with Death.
The Third Song in the Royalist, Sung by Mr. Bowman.
I.
NOW now the Tories all must droop
Religion and the Laws,
And Whigs of Commonwealth get up,
To top the good Old Cause:
Tantivy Boys must all go down
With haughty Monarchy;
The Leather Cap must brave the Crown,
And hey Boys up go we.
II.
When once the Antichristian crew,
Are crushed and overthrown,
We Will teach the Nobles how to sue;
And keep the Gentry down;
Good manners has an ill report,
And tends to Pride we see,
We Will therefore cry all breeding down,
And hey then up go we.
III.
The Name of Lord shall be abhorred,
For every man's a Brother,
What reason then in Church or state
One man should rule another?
When we have Pill'd and Plundered all,
And levelled each degree,
We Will make their Plump young Daughters fall,
And hey then up go we.
IV.
We Will down with all the Versities
Where Learning is professed,
Because they practice and maintain
The Language of the Beast;
We Will exercise within the Groves,
And teach beneath a Tree,
We Will make a Pulpit of a Cask,
And hey then up go we.
V.
What though the King and Parliament
Do not accord together,
We have most cause to be content,
This is our Sunshine weather;
For if good reason should take place,
And they should once agree,
Zoons who would be in a Roundheads case,
For hey Boys up go we.
VI.
We Will break the Windows which the Whore
Of Babylon has Painted*
And when the Bishops are run down,
Our Elders shall be sainted;
Thus having quite enslaved the Town;
Pretending it to free:
At last the Gallows claims its own,
And hey Boys up go we.
A Seranade, Sung at Tunbridge.
LOok down fair Nymph and see,
The tenders of a Lovers duty,
Whose heart till now was free;
From snares of sweet enchanting Beauty:
Like Bedlam Tom, I range and sue,
Around the streets all night I rove,
For pity then look down and view
The victim of Almighty Love.
Second Movement.
Like Spirits we wander in dead time of night,
Huzza, Huzza, we roar and we fight;
With Bagpipe and Drum,
We rant our way home:
But see the Watch comes to oppose our delight.
CHORUS.
Charge, charge, hey we scowre,
Through the Billmen in Flannel,
And down drops a Constable into the kennel.
A Song in Madam Fickle.
I.
HAppy is the Man that takes delight
In Banqueting his senses,
That drinks all Day, and then at Night
The height of joy commences:
With Bottles armed we stand our ground,
Full Bumpers crown our Blisses,
Then Roar and Sing the streets around
In serenading Misses.
II.
By blessings free and unconfined,
We prove without reproaches;
There Is no bliss like a frolic mind,
Or pleasures like Deboaches:
Whilst rambling thus new joys we reap,
In charms of Love and Drinking;
Insipid Fops lie drowned in sleep,
And the Cuckold he lies thinking.
The Rapture, a Song set by Mr. Farmer.
I.
AS on Serena's panting Bre
The happy Strephon lay,
With Love and Beauty doubly blessed
He past the hours away:
Fierce Raptures of transporting Love,
And pleasure struck him dumb,
He envied not the powers above,
Nor all the joys to come.
II.
As painful Bees far off do rove,
To bring their Treasure home,
So Strephon ranged the Field of Love,
To make his honny Comb:
Her Ruby lips he sucked and pressed,
From whence all sweets derive,
Then buzzing round her snowy Breast;
Soon crept into the hive.
A Song in the Night Adventures, or Squire Oldsap, set by Mr. Graboe.
I.
CLose in a hollow silent Cave,
Young Damon sleeping lay,
Himself one hour from grief to save;
And from the scorching day,
He Celia loved, whose Face and Wit
Did every Shepherds sense control;
Whose flowing hair was Loves soft net,
Whose every glance a heart did get:
And every smile a Soul.
II.
But see what Balm Love's Monarch keeps,
To ease a Lovers pain,
As he in this dark Mansion sleeps,
It fiercely began to rain:
Fair Celia roving through the Farm,
A straying Lamb from hurt to save,
Which found, she folds with her white Arm;
And then to save her from the storm,
Strait slipped into the Cave.
III.
The drowzy Swain began to smile,
To see his Heaven so nigh,
She blushed and feared, and all the while
The Lamb stood bleating by:
No breath is left her to complain,
She Is now a Captive by surprise,
And fears approaching joys and pain;
Thus at the mercy of the Swain,
The Charming Virgin lies.
A Scotch Song, Sung in the Virtuous Wife.
I.
SAwney was Tall and of Noble Race,
And loved me better than any eane;
But no he liggs by another Lass,
And Sawney will never be my Love again:
I gave him fine Scotch Sarke and Band,
I put 'em on with mine own hand;
I gave him House, and I gave him Land,
Yet Sawney will never be my Love again.
II.
I robbed the Groves of all their store,
And Nosegays made to give Sawney one;
He kissed my Breast and feign would do mere,
Good feth me thought he was a bonny one:
He squeezed my fingers, grasped my knee,
And Carved my name on each green Tree,
And sighed and languisht to ligg by me;
Yet no he wonot be my Love again.
III.
My Bongrace and my Sunburned Face
He praiz'd, and also my Russet Gown,
But no he doats on the Copper Lace
Of some lewd Queen of London Town:
He gangs and gives her Cruds and Cream,
Whilst I poor soul sit sighing at heam,
And near joy Sawney unless in a dream;
For now he near will be my Love again.
Another Song written at Epsom on Beauty.
BEauty, thou Throne of Graces,
Bright Queen of charming Faces;
Thou Soul of endless Passion,
Thou Tyrant of the Nation:
Thou God that do inflame us,
Thou Fury sent to damn us;
How happy should we be
Proud foe were not for thee?
II.
Numerous shining glories,
Adorned my Lovely Chloris;
Her Face was sweet as Summer,
Her Pride did well become her:
Her voice from Jove was given,
Each Angel flew from Heaven,
And smiling clapped his wing,
For Joy to hear her sing.
III.
My Soul was still admiring,
This falser than a Siren;
I strongly did besiege her,
But never durst disoblige her:
But she like Frosty weather,
Nipt all my Buds together;
And thinking me untrue,
My fond heart did undo.
Another made to a pleasant Tune.
I.
When to Paradise the Soul is brought,
The brightd wellers all flock to it;
In the eternal rosy Groves it is sought;
Fair she Saints, and Virgins woo it,
Angels, Cherubins still pursue it:
Breathing Love with Charming voice,
Angels, Cherubins still pursue it;
Singing Halelujahs of Celestial joys.
II.
When fair Celia made my heart her prize,
Every sinew felt a pleasure,
Each kind look from her obliging Eyes;
Swelled my joys beyond all measure:
Love, ah! Love is the only Treasure,
Joy and blessing of the brave and wise,
Give me love and life enough and leisure;
I Will never envy what the fool enjoys.
A Song to Cloris.
^
NO silly Cloris tell me no such
^
stories, true generous Love can never
^
undo ye, when I desert ye, let affected
^
virtue charm e-ve-ry Fop that now does
^
pursue ye; search all humane Nature,
^
try every Creature, Ransack all Complections,
^
every face and feature; and
^
when e're I dye you will too late descry,
^
none ever yet did love so well as I.
II.
Curse on Ambition,
What a blessed Condition
Lovers were in, not awed by that Demon,
Then cruel Cloris,
Careless of vain Glories,
Would reap more Bliss than pride e're could dream on;
We should have no dying,
No faint denying,
Sighings or repulses when the soul is flying.
Mammons triffling toys
She would then despise,
And own our Love the center of her joys.
A Song to Astrea.
I.
YOU say I am false, and I freely confess,
Had you bin less Charming my flame had bin less;
But Love, cruel Tyrant, my pain to renew,
Though I Am fickle to most, makes me constant to you.
II.
I play like a fly with the beams of your Eye,
And buzzing around it at last there I dye;
Sometimes brave my fate and break your strong Chain,
But one pretty glance takes me Prisoner again.
III.
Then never believe that Astrea can find
Her Celladon faithless if she be but kind,
For my heart like a Taper this quality gains,
That whilst it has matter gives luster and flames.
An Epithalamium Sung at the Marriage of the Lady W --
I.
JOY to the Bridegroom! fill the sky
With pleasing sounds of welcome joy;
Joy to the Bride! may lasting bliss,
And every day still prove like this:
Joy to the, etc.
II.
Never were Marriage joys divine,
But where two constant hearts combine;
He that proves false, himself does cheat,
Like sick men tast's but cannot eat:
He that, etc.
III.
What is a Maidenhead? ah what?
Of which weak fools so often prate?
It Is the young Virgins pride and boast,
Yet never was found but when 'twas lost:
It Is the, etc.
IV.
Fill me a Glass then to the drink,
And its confusion here I Will drink;
And he that balks the health I named,
May he dye young and then be damned:
And he that, etc.
A Catch.
NOW Interest sways the State,
Gets store of Coin and store of curses,
The Clergy too of late,
Do crow'd their conscience in their Purses:
Since then Religion's grown a cheat,
And each black Robe with Vice is lined;
Let Love and Wine our bliss create,
And make us ever young and kind.
A Song in the Fond Husband.
NO more cruel Nymph my passion despise,
Or slight a poor Lover that languishing dies,
Though fortune my name with no Titles endu'd;
Yet fierce is my passion and warm is my blood:
The Love of an Emperor no greater can be,
And Enjoyment's the same in every degree.
II.
But vigorous and young I Will fly to thy Arms,
Infusing my Soul in Elyzium of Charms;
A Monarch I Will be when I lie by thy side,
And thy pretty hand my Scepter shall guide:
Thus charmed with each other, true Rapture we will prove,
Whilst Angels look down and envy our Love.
The Clowns Courtship, a Song made and sung to the King at Windsor, to an
excellent Scotch Tune.
I.
QUoth John to Joan, will thou have me?
I prithee now wilt, and Ise Marry with thee:
My Cow, my Cow, my House and Rents,
Aw my Lands and Tenements:
Say my Joan, say my Joaney, will that not do?
I cannot, I cannot, come every day to woe.
II.
I have Corn and Hay in the Barn hard by,
And three fat Hogs pent up in the sty;
I have a Mare and she is cole black,
I ride on her Tail to save her back:
Say my Joan, etc.
III.
I have a Cheese upon the shelf,
I cannot eat it all my self;
I have three good Marks that lie in a rag,
In the nook of the Chimney instead of a bag:
Say my Joan, etc.
IV.
To marry I would have thy consent,
But faith I never could Complement;
I can say naught but hoy gee hoa,
Terms that belong to Cart and Plough:
Say my Joan, etc.
The Storm, a Song in Sir Barnaby Whigg.
BLow Boreas blow, and let thy surley winds
Make the Billows foam and roar,
Thou can no terror breed in Valiant minds;
But in spite of thee I Will live and find the shore:
Then cheer my hearts and be not awed,
But keep the Gun-room clear;
Though Hell's broke loose and the Devils roar abroad,
Whilst we have Sea-room, here boys never fear;
Hey how she tosses up, how far,
The mounting Topmast touched a Star;
The Meteors blazed as through the Clouds we came,
And Salamander-like we live in flame;
But ah we sink, now, now we go
Down to the deepest shades below:
Alas where are we now? who, who, can tell?
Sure it is the lowest room in Hell,
Or where the Sea Gods dwell;
With them we will live, with them we will live and Reign,
With them we will laugh and sing and drink amain;
But see we mount, see, see, we rise again.
Second Movement.
Though flashes of Lightning and Tempests of Rain,
Do fiercely contend which shall conquer the Main;
Though the Captain does swear,
Instead of a Prayer,
And the Sea is all fired by the Demons o'th Air;
We Will drink and defy the mad Spirits that fly,
From the deep to the sky;
And sing whilst the Thunder does bellow:
For Fate still will have,
A kind Fate for the brave,
And never make his Grave of a Saltwater wave:
To drown, drown, never to drown,
No never to drown a good fellow.
A Song in the Virtuous Wife, set by Mr. Farmer.
LET the Traitors Plot on, 'till at last they are undon,
By hurting their Brains to decoy us;
We whose hearts are at rest, in our Loyalty's blessed,
What Demon or power can annoy us?
Ambition like Wine, does the senses confound,
And Treason's a damnable thing;
Then let him that thinks well see his brimmers go round,
And pray for the safety and life of the King.
CHORUS.
Let Caesar live long, let Caesar live long,
For ever be happy and ever be young;
And he that does hope to change King for a Pope,
Let him dye, let him dye, whilst Caesar lives long.
Tony: A Ballad made occasionally by reading a late Speech made by a Noble PEER.
I.
LET Oliver now be forgotten, his Policy's quite of doors,
Let Bradshaw and Hewson lie rotting like Sons of Phanatical Whores:
For Tony's grown a Patrician,
By Voting damned Sedition,
For many years famed Politician;
The mouth of all Presbyter Peers.
II.
Tony a Turncoat at Worcester,
Yet swore he would maintain the Kings right,
But Tony did swagger and bluster,
And never drew Sword on his side:
For Tony like an Old Stallian,
Had still the Pox of Rebellion,
And never was sound
Like a Camelion,
Still changing both his shape and his ground.
III.
Old Rowley returned (heaven bless him)
From exile and danger set free,
Sly Tony made have to address him,
And swore none so Loyal as he:
The King that knew him a Traitor,
And saw him squint like a Satyr,
Yet through his Grace
Pardoned the matter,
And gave him since the Purse and the Mace.
IV.
And now little Chancellor Tony,
With honor has feathered his Wing,
And careful scrap't up the Money,
But never a Groat for the King:
But Tony's luck was confounded,
The Duke soon smoakt him a Roundhead,
From head to heel
Tony was sounded;
And Y -- k soon put a spoke in his Wheel.
V.
But Tony that frets in his Passion,
Like Boy that has netled his breech,
Did late in the house take occasion
To make a most delicate speech:
He told the King like a Croney,
If e're he hope't to have Money
He must be Ruled, Oh fine Tony!
Was ever Potent Monarch so schooled?
VI.
The King Issues forth Proclamation,
By Learned and Loyal Advice,
But Tony declares to the Nation,
The Council will never be wise:
For Tony Rayles at the Papist,
Yet is himself an Atheist,
Though so precize
Sneaking and Apish:
Like holy Quack or Priest in disguise.
VII.
But destiny shortly will cross it,
For Tony grows Gowty and Sick,
In spite of his Spiggot and Fawset,
The Statesman must go to Old Nick:
Yet Tony's madder and madder,
And M -- blows like a Bladder,
And others too,
Who grow gladder,
That they Great Y -- k are like to undo.
VIII.
But now let this Rump of the Law see
A Maxim, and so we will part,
Who e're with his Prince is so saucy,
It Is feared is a Traitor in's heart:
Then Tony cease to be Witty,
By buzzing Treason in the City,
And love the King,
So ends my ditty:
Or else may thou swing like a dog in a string.
The Generous Lover, a new Song, set by Mr. Tho. Farmer.
^
THE night her blackest Sables
^
wore, all gloomy were the skies, and
^
glittering Stars there were no more, than
^
those in Stella's Eyes, when at her Fathers
^
Gate I knocked, where I had often bin, and
^
shrouded only by her smock, this An-gel
^
let me in.
II.
Fast locked within my close Embrace,
She trembling lay aff^am'd,
Her swelling Breasts and glowing Face,
And every touch enflamed:
My eager passion I obeyed,
Resolved the Fort to win,
And her fond heart was soon betrayed
To yield and let me in.
III.
Ah! then beyond expressing*
Immortal was the Joy,
I know no greater blessing;
So much a God was I*
And she transported with delight,
Often prayed me come again,
And kindly vowed that every night
She Would rise and let me in.
IV.
But ah! at last she proved with Bearn,
And sighing sat and dull,
And I that was as much concerned
Looked then just like a Fool:
Her lovely Eyes with Tears ran over,
Repenting her sweet sin,
She sight, and cursed the fatal hour
That e're she let me in.
V.
But who could cruelly deceive,
Or from such Beauty part?
I loved her so I could not leave
The Charmer for my heart;
But Wedded and concealed her Crime,
Thus all was well again:
And now she thanks the blessed time,
That e're she let me in.
RESOLUTION.
I.
LOng did I Love to my Torment,
But Phillis grew Proud and Cruel,
Slighting all means of preferment,
I Languisht my life away,
Jealousies doubts and despairs
Did hourly increase the Fuel;
Sighs and a deluge of Tears
Wore out the tedious day:
But now I know what the worst of Love is,
I Will leave it quite over, and I Will languish no more,
Let the Amorous Cully despair;
My Love I will lend, to my Bottle and Friend,
And still live as free as Air.
II.
Charming and bright as a Goddess,
Was Phillis when first I Loved her,
Now she is Proud and Immodest;
Ah pity 'twas her Crime,
Though she too dearly did love it,
She Would rail when e're I moved her:
Scorn of a blessing they Covet,
Damns Women before their time;
Why should a Man that has sense and honor,
Dote on a snare that the Devil made fair,
As a Plague to the best of Mankind
They Love, Fawn and Pray, and yet hate the next day;
There Is no joy like Wit and Wine.
Love's World: A Copy of Verses Translated out of the French of Astrea, Written
by my Uncle Durfe.
I.
GReat Artist, Love, the sure Foundation laid,
And out of me another World has made;
The Earth is my Fidelity, which stands
Immovable by any Mortal hands;
And as this World upon the Earth is founded,
So this on my fidelity is grounded.
II.
If any fits of jealousy do make,
The Earth of my fidelity to shake,
And cause my solid constant heart to tremble,
Imprisoned Winds exactly they resemble:
Which being in the pregnant Womb enclosed,
Makes me and the whole Globe be discomposed.
III.
My Tears the Ocean are, as soon you may
Empty the Sea, as them dry up or stay;
My sighs so many storms are, which rebel
And make this Sea to bubble and to swell;
And my Eyes flowing Rivulets do glide,
Paying their constant Tribute to this Tide.
IV.
The Air my Will is, pure Serene and free,
And always waits on my fidelity;
The Wind is my Desire, and rules my Will,
Which by the stronger gust is moved still;
And as in Caverns we do see the wind,
So my desire is in my heart confined.
V.
The Fire Invisible mixed in the Air,
Those secret flames which burn my heart up, are;
And as this Element no Eye can see,
Even so my flames within me smothered be;
But as all fire some nourishment does crave,
So must mine dye or nourishment must have.
VI.
My Hopes the Moon is, which does still increase
Or else diminish always more or less;
And as fair Silvia, I do find it true,
I have no light until supplied by you;
So she no bright perfection ever won*
'Till beautified with glories from the Sun.
VII.
The Sun is your Incomparable Eye,
Which other Planets does so far outvie;
That as the Sun life to the World does give,
So Lovers dye unless you bid 'em live;
It Is day when you appear, and it is night,
Obscurely dark, when you are out of sight.
VIII.
The Summer is my Joy, when you do please,
To shine upon me and my passions ease;
The Winter is my Fear, when you withdraw,
And my despairing doubts deny to thaw;
And then alas, what fruit can Autumn bring,
When I can find no flowers in my spring?
The Hornpipe.
^
BUT when the Bottles roll
^
a -- bout and Glasses, plague of all
^
Intrigues, a Pox on charming Faces:
^
Let the Pu -- ny Lo-ver sigh, and whine,
^
and moan like a fluttering droan,
^
make an Insect humming, Beauty here
^
we see, more bright than any she,
^
ne -- ver out of humor, kind, and always
^
coming.
The Caterwauling, a Song made at Epsom alluding to an Intrigue there.
TWO Cats were playing by a Well side,
And one of these two Cats fell in,
The Cat that was left most bitterly wept,
Because she was the other Cats Cozen Jermain.
II.
But e're she could hide her sorrows, and wipe
The Tears from her fair sweet Eyes that fell,
Malicious Fate brought another fierce Cat,
To see her bemoan her dear Love in the Well;
Some time this Cat in a Window had sat,
And seen her bemoan her dear Love in the Well.
III.
This Cat of mode did the the other Cat keep,
And had given her many a Rich Tabby Gown,
Deserted his Spouse, to feast her with his Mouse,
And made her outbrave all the Cats in the Town;
Her Champion was, in all Chances befell her,
And had often fought for her in Garret and Celler.
IV.
But now his heart with jealousy burns,
His Eyes he inflames, and his Claws does whet;
The loving Pur to loud howling he turns,
And Lyon-like stares on the other poor Cat:
Ah! false one, cries he, what a plague did you want,
To howl for this Fool, and desert your Gallant?
V.
Have I so long bin your Cully and Fop,
And kept my poor Wife so long from Town?
Spent all my Estate to keep you at your rate;
Every Tooth in your head has cost me a Pound,
And am I thus Jilted by a Cat-Whore,
Go, go, you are a Puss, and I Will see ye no more!
A Song in the Night Adventures, or Esquire Oldsap, set by Mounsieur Graboe.
I.
HOW frail is Old Age to believe
Their sinews can ever be strong,
Or think, that a heap
Of diseases can reap
The pleasures of him that is young.
Cho. He plunges in care let him do what he can,
So wretched a thing is a doting Old Man.
II.
His life has been spent in Deboach,
'Till he comes to be sixty or more,
And so wenches on
'Till his vigor be gone,
And then the old Letcher gives over.
Cho. A passion that is sickly can never last long,
And an Old doting Fool is far worse than a Young.
A Drinking Song.
I.
COme fill the Glasses until they run over,
Wine is the Mistress we ought to adore;
Women are pretty Fantastical toys,
Fit to please foolish and ignorant boys:
But Wine, Wine, it is Wine alone that affords the true joys;
It Is Wine, it is Wine alone that affords the the true joys.
II.
Wine keeps out envy and grief from our hearts,
Wine keeps us from blind Love and his darts;
We never at Fortunes Injustice complain,
Nor are we troubled for Celia's disdain:
But all, all, all our Cares are drowned in Champaign,
All all our Cares are drowned in Champaign.
III.
Come fill the Glass and I Will drink a new health,
Which shall not be to my Wit or my Wealth,
Or to my Mistress, to his, or to thine,
But to a Creature more rare and divine:
Come here, here, here, to the best --
I mean the best Wine;
Here, here is to the best, I mean the best Wine.
A Catch by another hand.
THough the Town be destroyed, since our selves we enjoy,
Where e're we reside we will make a new Troy;
When weary of one place our minds compass all,
Thus Man's the great World, and the Globe's but the small.
CHORUS.
Then drink your Veins full, and whilst waters glide
About the dull Earth, let Wine be your Tide.
Then drink your Veins full, and whilst waters glide
About the dull Earth, let wine be your Tide.
Another.
I.
SOme Thirty or Forty or Fifty at least,
Or more, I have loved in vain, in vain,
But if you will vouchsafe to receive a poor guest,
For once I will venture again, again.
II.
How long I shall be in this mind, this mind,
Is totally in your own power;
All my days I can pass with the kind, the kind,
But I Will part with the Proud in an hour.
III.
Then if you will be good natured, and civil, and civil,
You Will find I can be so too, so too;
But if not, you may go, you may go to the Devil,
Or the Devil may come to you, to you.
The Libertine: A Song set to a Tune called Farmers Maggot.
WHilst Love Predominates over our Souls,
A Pox on Counsel from tedious Old Fools;
Reproofs of the Churchmen but whet us the more,
Whilst liberty Teaches,
And appetite Preaches,
No wealth like a Bottle, no joy like a Wh --
Long Tales of Heaven to Fools are given,
But we put in pleasure to make the Scale even;
Thus Kissing, and Wenching, and Drinking brave Boys,
We drive out Collicks
By nightly Frolicks,
And drown short Life in a Deluge of Joys.
II.
We choose our Misses by goodness of Face,
And hate your formal Fops like a long Grace;
The Minions of Fortune we slight and reprove,
It Is she is the Fairy,
That proves most Airy,
And Courts our acquaintance with passion and love:
Let the Zealous Mizer think he is wiser,
That late kept a Wench, but now is preciser;
Whilst we sit and Revel here free from mishaps,
With Girls as willing,
As we for a Shilling,
And fear naught, but Duns, bad Clarret and Claps.
Another Song Translated out of the French of my Uncle D'urfe.
I.
THis restless River that does run,
Wave after wave as it begun;
Is like the sorrows that do flow,
Upon my Soul, woe after woe.
II.
As that compelled by Nature wanders,
Murmuring it self into Meanders;
So I oprest by Fortune rove,
Murmuring against my Fate and Love.
A Scotch Sung, sung at the Artillery Feast.
^
WOONS, what no is the
^
mat -- ter! good feth it is won -- d'rous

strange; the Whiggs do keep sike a

clatter that nean can pass the Exchange.
^
They cry bread it is pity, their numbers

are no more, the Duke does dine in the

City, and muckle they fear his power.
^
They begin the awd trick again, and
^
Cabal like awd Nick a-gen, Feast
^
three hundred pound thick again, sike a
^
height they soar: Ah bonny London, thour't
^
undone if e're thou art in their power.
II.
The wise Old E -- with the Spiggot,
That never knew rest or ease,
Ods bread is grown sike a Bigot;
The Nation has his disease.
More I think I could name ye,
That make this raree show,
Bold George, and Politic Iemmy;
Converted by Doctor TO.
Both the Sheriffs there should ha bin,
Then how merry they would ha bin,
Met for National good again,
As they were before,
Ah bonny London,
You Are undone,
If long thou art in their power.
III.
More to show us what Ninnys
Are all Rebellious beasts,
The Cuckolds sent in their Guinnys,
To make up this Godly Feast.
Never caring or thinking
What Insolence was done,
Or that their Plotting and Drinking;
Should e're be opposed so soon.
But when they knew they were barred again,
They sent out the Black Guard again,
All our Bonfires were marred again;
Slaves did shout and roar:
Ah bonny London,
You Are undone,
If e're thou art in their power.
IV.
Right and Royalty Governs,
Which Rebels would overthrow,
They once were fatal to Sovereigns;
Ah let 'em no more be so.
But to baffle Oppression,
Inspired by Fate divine,
Defend the Crown and Succession;
And keep it in the Right-Line.
Every Soldier will fight for it,
Each bold Genius will write for it,
And the Whigs hang in spite for it,
Losing Regal power:
And bonny London,
They Are undone,
That thought to usurp once more.
The Spinning Wheel, a Pastoral, made at New-Hall, and Sung to the KING at
Windsor.
I.
UPon a sunshine Summers day,
When every Tree was green and gay,
The Morning blushed with Phoebus ray,
Just then ascending from the Sea,
As Silvio did a Hunting ride,
A lovely Cottage he espied;
Where lovely Chloe Spinning sat,
And still she turned her Weel about.
II.
Her Face a Thousand Graces crown,
Her Curling hair was lovely brown,
Her Rolling Eyes ah hearts did win,
And white as down of Swans her skin;
So taking her plain dress appears,
Her Age not passing sixteen years,
The Swain lay sighing at her foot,
Yet still she turned her Wheel about.
III.
Thou sweetest of thy tender kind,
Cries he, this never can suit thy mind,
Such Grace attracting noble Loves,
Was never designed for Woods and Groves*
Come, come with me to Court my Dear,
Partake my Love and Honor there;
And leave this Rural sordid rout,
And turn no more thy Wheel about.
IV.
At this with some few modest sighs,
She turns to him her Charming Eyes;
Ah! tempt me Sir no more she cries,
Nor seek my weakness to surprise,
I know your Arts to be believed,
I know how Virgins are deceived;
Then let me thus my Life wear out,
And turn my harmless Wheel about.
V.
By that dear panting breast cries he,
And yet unseen divinity;
Nay by my Soul that rests in thee,
I swear this cannot, must not be;
Ah cause not my eternal woe,
Nor kill the Man that loves thee so;
But go with me and ease my doubt,
And turn no more thy Wheel about.
VI.
His Cunning Tongue so played its part,
He gained admission to her heart;
And now she thinks it is no sin,
To take Loves fatal poison in;
But ah too late she found her fault,
For he her Charms had soon forgot;
And left her e're the year ran out,
In tears to turn her Wheel about.
Advice to the City: Sung to the King at Windsor, to a Theorbo.
I.
REmember ye VVhiggs what was formerly
done,
Remember your mischiefs in Forty and One;
When friend opposed friend, and Father the Son,
Then, then your Old Cause went rarely on:
The Cap sat aloft, and low was the Crown,
The Rabble got up and the Nobles went down;
Lay Elders in Tubs, ruled Bishops in Robes,
Who mourned the sad fate
And dreadful disaster, of their Royal Master
By Rebels betrayed.
CHORUS.
Then London be wise and baffle their power,
And let 'em play the Old Game no more;
Hang, hang up the Sh --
Those Baboons in power,
Those popular Thieves,
Those Rats of the Tower,
Whose Canting Tales the Rabble believes;
In a hurry
And never sorry
Merrily they go on:
Fie for shame, we are too tame, since they claim
The Combat:
Tan tarra rarra, Tan tarra rarra,
Dub a dub, let the Drum beat,
The strong Militia guards the Throne.
II.
When Faction possesses the Popular Voice,
The Cause is supplied still with Nonsense
and Noise;
And Tony their Speaker the Rabble leads on,
For he knows if we prosper that he must run;
Carolina must be his Station of ease,
And London be rid of her worsest disease:
From Plots and from Spies,
From Treasons and Lies
We shall ever be free,
And the Law shall be able, to punish a Rebel
As cunning as he.
CHORUS.
Then London be wise and baffle their power,
And let 'em play the Old Game no more;
Hang, hang up the Sh --
Those Baboons in power,
Those popular Thieves,
Those Rats of the Tower,
Whose Canting Tales the Rabble believes;
In a hurry
And never sorry
Merrily they go on:
Fie for shame, we are too tame, since they claim
The Combat:
Tan tarra rarra, Tan tarra rarra,
Dub a dub, let the Drum beat,
The strong Militia guards the Throne.
III.
Rebellion never wanted a Loyal pretense,
These Villains, swear all is for the good of
their Prince;
Oppose our Elections to show what they dare,
And losing their Charter arrest the Mayor;
Fool Ie -- was the Captain of the Cuckoldy
Crew,
With Ell -- and Iea -- and H -- the Jew;
Famed sparks of the Town
For wealth and renown,
Give the Devil his due,
And such as we fear, had our Sovereign bin
there,
Had arrested him too.
CHORUS.
Then London be wise and baffle their power,
And let 'm play the Old Game no more;
Hang, hang up the Sh --
Those Baboons in power,
Those popular Thieves,
Those Rats of the Tower,
Whose Canting Tales the Rabble believes;
In a hurry
And never sorry
Merrily they go on:
Fie for shame, we are too tame, since they claim
The Combat:
Tan tarra rarra, Tan tarra rarra,
Dub a dub, let the Drum beat,

A Song, Sung to the King at his Entertainment at my Lord Conways at Windsor.
I.
WHen Godlike Caesar from his Throne,
Decends to taste of Mortal Joy,
And from his awful hand lays down
The dazzling Rains of Monarchy:
The Queen of Love and Beauty flies,
To calm his frowns and cares release;
Brim full of liquid Love her Eyes,
And Breast like the white land of Peace.
II.
Then, then an equal power they show,
In Union all true bliss relies,
He carries Thunder in his brow;
She killing Lightning in her Eyes:
Yet only hurtful to her foes,
Whose brutal Malice she would tame,
Over others it divinely grows,
A Glory in a Lambent flame.
III.
In Love is our Eternal rest,
Salvation there does chiefly lie,
In Caesar's pleasure we are blessed;
In his content depends our joy:
So Jove and Pregnant nature prove,
The blessings they for us designed;
Since from their everlasting Love
Springs all the joys of human kind.
The Court Star: A Poem, on the Duchess of --.
I.
WE all to Conquering Beauty bow,
Its Influence I admire,
But never saw a Star 'till now
That like you could inspire:
Now I may say I met with one,
Amazes all Mankind,
And like Men gazing on the Sun;
With too much light am blind.
II.
Like the bright Genious of your Race,
You spread your Influence,
Your one Sex borrows from your Face;
And ours from your sense:
Pardon me, since my thoughts I raise,
With this blessed Theme delighted,
For since all loudly speak your praise,
Then when should I not write it.
III.
The glittering Temple of our God,
Is decked with forms divine,
But amongst all the heavenly Crowd,
Is never a Face like thine;
The strictest zeal Apostate stands,
When so much Grace they view,
To heaven they trembling lift their hands;
But Eyes and hearts to you.
IV.
Calm as the tender moving sighs,
When longing Lovers meet;
Like the divining Prophets wise,
And like blown Roses sweet:
Modest yet Gay, reserved yet free,
Each happy night a Bride,
A Mein like awful Majesty,
And yet no spark of Pride.
V.
The Patriarch to gain a Wife,
Chaste, Beautiful and Young,
Served Fourteen years of painful life,
Yet never thought 'em long;
Ah! were you to reward such cares,
And Life so long could stay,
Not Fourteen, but Four Hundred years;
Would seem but as one day.
VI.
Thus when eternal kindness flowed,
E're wretched Adam sinned,
Heavens bounteous hand on him bestowed;
A lovely Female friend.
I know not how he prized that life,
But this I Am sure is ture,
If a true blessing be a Wife,
She then must be like you.
