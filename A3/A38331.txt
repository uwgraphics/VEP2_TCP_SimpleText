TO THE Kings Most Excellent Majesty, The HUMBLE PETITION of the LORDS
SPIRITUAL and TEMPORAL Whose Names are Subscribed.
May it please Your Majesty,
WE your Majesty's most Loyal Subjects, in a deep sense of the Miseries of a
War now breaking forth in the Bowels of this your Kingdom, and of the Danger to
which your Majesty's Sacred Person is thereby like to be Exposed, and also of
the Distractions of your People, by Reason of their present Grievances, do
think our selves bound in Conscience of the Duty we owe to God and our Holy
Religion, to your Majesty and our Country, most humbly to offer to your
Majesty, that in our Opinion, the only visible way to preserve your Majesty and
this your Kingdom, would be the calling of a Parliament, Regular and Free in
all its Circumstances.

We therefore do most earnestly beseech your Majesty, that you would be
graciously pleased with all speed to call such a Parliament, wherein we shall
be most ready to promote such Councels and Resolutions of Peace and Settlement
in Church and State, as may conduce to your Majesty's Honor and Safety, and to
the quieting the Minds of your People.

We do likewise humbly beseech your Majesty, in the mean time, to use such
means for the preventing the Effusion of Christian Blood, as to your Majesty
shall seem most meet.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc. W. Cant. Grafton. Ormond. Dorset.
Clare. Clarendon. Burlington. Anglesey. Rochester. Newport. Nom. Ebor. W.
Asaph. Fran. Ely. Tho. Roffen. Tho. Petriburg. T. Oxon. Paget. Chandois.
Osulston.

Presented by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York Elect, the
Bishop of Ely, and the Bishop of Rochester, the 17th. of November, 1688.
