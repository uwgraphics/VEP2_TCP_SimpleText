HERE is something of Concernment in Jreland, to be taken notice off: by all
Officers and Soldiers, and others in Authority and all sorts of People
whatsoever, a Warning and a Charge to you is, that you stand Clear and Acquit
your selves like men (for ever) Never to be uphoulders of those Priests as you
tender the Everlasting good of your souls; have no fellowship with them,
neither come you near their Tents, for the Lord has a purpose to destroy them,
And his Controversy is against them, and all that takes their parts.
FOr here are many young Scholars lately come over into Jreland young Priests
sent from Oxford, and Cambridg, and these young Priests the Committee of
Priests Siting at Dublin have approved of them, here they come and Challenge
the tenth part of our goods, they say is now their own, and where they can
find an old ruined Mass-house, then they get an Order for the repairing of it;
And if any for Conscience sake should refuse paying toward the mending of the
Popes old houses, then the evil Justices of the Peace, which the Land is full
of, grants forth their warrants to distrain, and take away Peoples goods,
because they cannot pay rates for the repairing of the Papists Mass-houses, as
lately a widow woman at Dublin had much goods taken from her, because for
Conscience sake she could not pay toward the mending of St. PATRICKS Church so
Called; and a friend at Rosse had his Coat taken off his back for not paying
toward the mending of an old Mass-house in the County of Wexford, and diverse
others might be instanced in the Nation: Now when this young Priest has gotten
his Mass-house finished, then he has three or four Parishes laid together, to
maintain himself with the tenths thereof, he cares not now, he has gotten
four or five Parishes (perhaps) not four Protestant families in them all,
which Tithes formerly used to serve four or five Popish Priests very well,
will now scarcely serve this young Protestant priest which makes the Papists to
wonder what great Bellies the Protestant Priests have gotten, that they must
have four times more then their Priests used to have; So that these Priests
lately come over, are never like to convince the Papists with sound Doctrine,
their lives and conversations are so bad, that the Papists beholds what
devourers they are, that one of them must have as much as four of theirs; So
judge you the wickedness of these young Priests is so great, that the Papists
now abhors to come at their own Mass-houses; therefore now there is an Order to
compel them to hear these Priests in Jreland once a week, or else they must
pay half a Crown, and then they shall be dispensed withal, and here the
Papists sees you again, what manner of Christians you are, that can pardon
People for money, like them at Rome, but the Light is come that has made you
manifest praised be the Lord for ever; who will remember your wickedness, and
your sins are before him, and the Lord will recompense the evil that you have
done upon your own heads, and those that sent you hither shall not escape that
gave every one of these young Priests a great sum of money for their
transportation, which is a shame to the Nation; and a shame to the Protestants
that their Priests should be such great eaters; and have such great sums of
money to bring them over, when many poor families in England are like to starve
for lack of bread.

Now these are unlike the first planters of the Gospel, they used to travel
from City to City; and from one Country to another publishing the Gospel
freely, from house to house eating what was set before them these had no
certain dwelling place as these young Planters have; who will not publish their
Gospel without money, nor pray nor sing without money, who makes Insurrections
and Mutinies in all Nations where ever they come or go, their fruits makes
them manifest in all places* my soul abhors their wicked practices, and the
spirit of the Lord is grieved with their Abominations, and he will ease
himself of his Enemies, and aveng himself on his Adversaries, and this is the
word of the Lord to the Priests of this Nation.

And the two places Oxford and Cambridg from whence these Scholars come who
makes Ministers, the thing which is seen conserning them is: They are like two
woods full of of Black trees, which are Blackned over with smoke and a few
leaves hanging drooping on the tops of them, like unto trees at the fall of the
leaf, and they stand as it were in a quagmire, which is made up with the fat
of the Nations, and the Exactings of poor people, and wringing of them, like a
great heap of miery soft Earth; And when the wind blows the quagmire puffs at
the bottom of it, and there is but little moss grows on the trees because of
the smoke, and these trees bears noe fruit, but a few droping leaves, as it
were in the end of Summer, So they stand as the shaking off with a great wind,
whose leaf fads, and so as they are carried out of that quagmire and wood and
bank undrest, they are planted in the Country like starved trees in the
forest, beaten with winds and weather, dried with the bark on, and some moss
on them, and scarcely leaves: Now these be the fuel for the fire, which
cumbers the ground fruitless trees that the Nations and the Earth has layen
like a wilderness, and these trees have not borne fruit, and their leaf fads
and falls, and the fruitful trees of the field begin to clap their hands who
bears the fruit, whose leaf never fads nor falls, that are by the River side,
and the smoke of these two woods before mentioned have almost smoked off all
the Bark of the^, for they have scarcely the out side of them, nor leaves but
are droping down continually, and they must all drop off and appear bare, for
they have not any to cover them, and all the work and intention of their
moddell is, to get money to make Ministers, which they have lately put forth in
Print; Are these like the Apostles in this? have not they thrust our Christ and
denied the faith, and let Christ have no Room but in their mouths to talk of
him? had ever Christ any Room but in the manger amongst the professers, and
them that lived in lipp service, and their hearts a far off from God? had not
the great professors Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, in the days of old, the great
talkers of Christ, and he had no place amongst them, but in the Manger in the
Stable; Are not you making Ministers and beging of the Gentry? and frighting
their evil Consciences if they will not give it you, and the highest when you
have made them is but Hebrew Greek and Latin, which is but natural; and so is
but a natural man, and the natural man receives not the things of God, though
he has Hebrew Greek and Latin, and though they may talk of Christ in those
Languages, yet will they put Christ in the Stable and in the Manger, and let
him have no Room in the Synnagogues as the Jews would not, but were al full of
wrath and rose up against him and put him out, and do not you Ministers put out
of your Synnagogues, and put into prison, if they should not put into your
mouths, surely people will be wise and not spend their money any longer for
that which is not Bread.

THE END
