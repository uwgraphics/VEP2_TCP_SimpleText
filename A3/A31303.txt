A CATALOGUE of the NAMES of those HOLY MARTYRS WHO WERE Burned in Queen MARY'S
Reign.
AS ALSO, The Particular Places where, with the Years and Months, and several
of the Days, when they Suffered.
I Am sorry we have now the sad Occasion to refresh our Memories with the
inhumane instances of the Cruelty of those Popish times; for as the
Incomparable Virgil says (though upon another Subject), Quis talia fando
temperet a Lachrymis? but yet, since we had even like (our Royal Sovereign, and
the whole Protestant Nation, if it had not been for the most gracious
timeing-Providence of God) to have been made a hasty Sacrifice to the
rapacious, devouring lusts of those bloody men of Rome; and still know not into
what hands we may fall, or how soon, if the infinite mercy of Heaven, the pious
zeal of the King, and the loyal unity, servent prayers, and diligent
circumspection of all true Englishmen, do not defeat their damnable and hellish
Machinations, and prevent their horrid Treacheries. What can be more seasonable
at such a time as this, than to present you with a short and true account of
those holy and blessed Martyrs, who suffered in the days of Queen Mary, only
for the Testimony of a good Conscience, and because they would not come over to
their Anti-scriptural, and Idolatrous ways of Worship. And if so many lives
were then taken away, and made a prey to the rage of their Religious pretenses,
Lord! what rivers of blood would now run down our streets! and how many
thousands of Souls should endure the utmost torments of their insatiable
Butcheries, should we ever have again a Popish Prince to rule over us! nor let
any of our Dignified Clergy think to escape, for they may see here, if they
please, they neither spared Bishop nor Archbishop that was not a Votary to the Sea of Rome; and I hope, whatever the Calumnies of some may be, we have none
but who do scorn to bow their knee to Antichrist.
