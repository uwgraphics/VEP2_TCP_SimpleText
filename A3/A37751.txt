THE PREFACE.
IT was about three or four years since, that this Work was begun; for I having
given my mind much to Geography, and notwithstanding that I had made a
considerable Progress in those kind of Studies, I found in the reading of
History, News, and such like, that my memory would often fail me in knowing of
Cities and Towns, where they were, and to whom they belonged (as it does often
still, even in those places that I have frequently read of) especially those of
inferior Note, many of which are usually left out in the common Geographies:
And this made me go about to compile this Index, as a thing that might prove as
much for my own use, as the Publick's, always intending never to go without it,
when once finished.

In the making of it, I found it far more laborious than I at first imagined;
and it was so extremely tedious and troublesome (especially to me who am
naturally averse to such Pains-taking) that at those times I set to it, I might
have found as much pleasure in digging or threshing by the day, as in making
this Index; so that had I not this last year met with some Encouragement from
several good Judges, and further considering it might prove very useful, even
to the best of Geographers, I should have wholly thrown it by, and left a great
part of it unfinished.

As for the use of this Tract, it is made in a Pocket-Volume, partly designed
for all such as frequent Coffee-Houses, and other places for News; by which any
City, Town, or Castle of Note in Europe, that is wanted, may be readily known
where it is, who it belongs to* the Situation, Distances, etc. and partly for
the true understanding all Modern Histories, especially all those of our last
Century, which without such helps as these, can be of little Use to those that
are not extraordinary well-skilled in Geography. The Title was given me by a
very eminent Person, whom I forbear to name.

To give a particular Account of this work; it is a Collection of between two
and three thousand Cities, Towns, and such like, placed Alphabetically; in
every one of which, are these following Particulars, in as much as the Subject
would permit, or might be convenient or necessary to the Perfection. 1. Is
mentioned the Name: 2. Some Epithete as it deserves: 3. In what Country or
Kingdom it is: 4. In what Province, or lesser part it is: 5. In what County, or
any other Subdivision it is: 6. If it be the Metropolis, or chief of any of
these: 7. If it be a Patriarchal City: 8. If it be an Archbishopric: 9. If it
be a Bish^prick, and under what Archbishop it is: 10. If it be an University,
with a more proper Epethite; 11. If it be an Imperial or Hance Town: 12. If it
be a Parliament City, Generality, Dukedom, Earldom, etc. 13. What Emperor,
King, Prince, or Potentate it is subject to: 14. What Battle or other great
Action it is famous for, with the time it was done: 15. Upon, or nigh what
River, Mountain, etc. it stands: 16. The Distance on English Miles from some
other Places of Note: And, 17. The Longitude and Latitude.

The Number of Places are very great and considerable, and I believe will prove
sufficient for any Man's Curiosity; for I have left out none of Note, or could
any ways deserve a Name in such an Index; yet the Reader is not to expect to
find every little Place that is sometimes mentioned in the Gazettes and
News-Books, for that would be a Work of vast Difficulty, and little Use, there
being often some Places named no better than Villages, which are never
mentioned twice: But yet I question not, if strict Examination be made, but
here will be found more than would have readily been imagined in so small a
room; and that it might be the more full, I have not set down any out of
Europe, because they are not of such Use; neither have I mentioned any in
England or Ireland, but five or six of the chief of each: For England, the
Reader may see Adams and Spelman; and for Ireland, my Description of that
Kingdom.

As to the Names and Spelling of Places, I have taken such care, that I believe
no man can easily miss of a Place for not knowing the true way of spelling of
it, (an Error which has bred great Confusion, and given Discouragement to many)
for here is set down all the different ways of spelling, inasmuch as could be
conveniently, which may be found in their Alphabetical Order, with Directions
to See for the Place required. But more than this, I have also set down in
their proper Places how they are called in France, Germany, Holland, Spain,
Turkey, etc. So that it will serve for the French, Dutch, or any other
Countrey's Gazette, as the English; a thing extremely necessary: For most
Persons are very apt to mistake when they hear of Bergen, Luyck, V^isingen, and
St. Gravenhaage, instead of Mons, Liege, Flushing, and Hague; Wien and Offen,
instead of Vienna and Buda; and Grichisch-Weissenburg, and Stamboul, instead of
Belgrade and Constantinople.

If any Place be very famous for any Battle, or great Action, or any other very
remarkable thing, it is here put down, though it be never so small a Place; as
Lutzren, Sennif, Flerus, etc. All Places have mostly their proper Epithets as
they deserve, and sometime two or three; as, large, small, fair, beautiful,
rich, magnificent, strong, neat, City, Town, etc. and likewise more
distinguishing Marks; as, Archbishopric, Bishopric, University, Dukedom, etc.
But for a better distinguishing of greater Places, here are given different
Characters or Letters, so that the Cities of the first Rank may well be known
from those of the second Rank; and those of the second from the rest. All the
Metropolisses of Provinces (besides several others of equal Deserts) are mostly
reckoned of the second Rank, though possibly they do not always deserve to be
called so.

For the better perfecting the Work, I have put in no Place whatsoever, without
telling who it is subject to; and for the better preserving a Method, even
those that are out of all doubt, such as in France or Spain, where it is
supposed that every man knows to whom it belongs.

For the finding of a Place in the Maps, (which was one great Design of this
Index) here are such plain Marks and easy Directions given, that I could not
possibly imagine a way more perspicuous in so small a room, which are done
these four ways, 1. By setting down, not only in what Country, Kingdom, and
Province, but also in what County, Territory, or any other Subdivision it
stands in. 2. By telling its Situation, that is, upon or nigh what Rivers,
Brooks, Lakes, Mountains, etc. and the Borders of what Countries and Provinces
it stands. 3. By showing its Distance from other Places of Note, with its
Situation, in respect of East, West, North or South; and this will be a
considerable Help to any Person, when he has not Maps at hand, for the making
of him conceive whereabouts it is. 4. By giving its Longitude and Latitude,
which is the surest and quickest way of all, if the Maps be true and good.

As to the Distance of Places, I must desire the Reader to take Notice, that I
have followed no Book whatsoever, not in one place, but have measured 'em every
one my self, according to the best Maps I could procure; the Miles I always
make use of, being exactly the 60th part of a Degree in the Equator, which
will mostly agree with our common computed Miles. Notwithstanding my own
measuring, I cannot always promise the Reader certainty, 1. Because the best
Maps have many Faults, and particularly those of Greece, Servia, and other
Parts of Turkey, as all modern Travelers complain of; but those of the
Low Countries, France, and Germany might be truer, if the Ingravers were not so
hasty, and would keep closer to their Copies. And, 2. Because in the measuring,
I may possibly sometimes have mistaken in Mile in Twenty, which I look upon as
no great Fault. Another thing I advertise the Reader of, is, The Distances are
not taken according to Roads or Highways, but according to the Situation in
Maps, as to Longitude and Latitude; and I never reckon two Places the further
off, for having Rivers, Lakes, Seas, or Mountains between.

I show the Distance of a Place sometimes from three or four others, sometimes
more, and sometimes less; if it be an ordinary Place, the Distance is sometimes
given only from one City, if that be of great Note; as, Ostia from Rome, and
Bavay from Mons; sometimes from two Cities, as, Niville from Mons and Brussels.
The Distance of great Cities (I mean the chief of Provinces, and some others
that are reckoned of the Second Rank) are most commonly given from those of
equal Note, or the same Rank, though at a good Distance, and also from the
Metropolis of the Country, though never so far off; as for Instance, Mantua in
Italy, and Munster in Germany; but for the Chief of a Country, as London,
Vienna, Paris, and Constantinople, the Distance is given from those, and only
those of the same Rank; as in London the Distance is given from all the chief
Cities in Europe; and Vienna, the Distance is given from Buda, Cracow, Rome,
Amsterdam, Paris, London, and Constantinople; so likewise the rest.

For the Longitude and Latitude of Places, I must acquaint the Reader, that I
have calculated 'em all according to F. de Wits newest Maps; so that by the
help of those Maps, and Place may be found with great ease and quickness:
sometimes perhaps I may have mistaken Minute or two. The first Meridian,
according to him, begins at Teneriff, one of the Canary Islands; but in
Sanson's and Berry's Maps, the first Meridian is made at Ferro, two Degrees
more West than Teneriff: So that if any Place be sought for in their Maps,
there must be two Degrees allowed in the Longitude; so for Instance, what is
there 20 and 30, must be reckoned as 18 and 28.

If this Book should fall into the Hands of some that do not know what
Longitude and Latitude is, this is to let 'em know, that in all Maps, the top
is the North, the bottom the South, the right hand the East, and the left the
West; (or at least should be so) the Distance from the West to the East, is
Longitude; and from the South to North, is Latitude; all which may be easily
seen by the Figures that are in the Sides, Tops and Bottoms of every Map.

That all these things that I have spoke of, might be easily put into so small
a Volume, and that it might want nothing that could with any probability,
satisfy any curious Enquirer, I have explained all things by Abbreviations and
Figures, and with a Character for that Purpose: So that if every thing had been
done at length, the Book must have been at least three times as large; which
would have made it of far less Use, and lost it much of the Original Design,
which was Multum in Parvo.

In short, all things are so well ordered, and Subject and Design so good, that
I could not have possibly invented any thing so small, of more general Use the
Public than this, or that is more probable to please; not that I deserve one
Word of Commendation, for any Person that had a small Skill in Geography, might
have done it as well as I, with the same Pains

I shall only say thus much more, That I have not designed this only for the
present Times, (neither shall I ever write because of the Times, again, except
I could do some signal Service in Church or State) but this is a thing which
will be as necessary many years hence as now; and will be of standing Use to
succeeding Ages.
