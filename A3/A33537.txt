THE COCK-CROWING AT THE Approach of a Free-Parliament OR
Good news in a Ballat
More sweet to your Palate
Then Fig, Raison, or stewed Prune is.
A Country wit made it
Who never got by the trade yet.
And Mad Tom of Bedlam the Tune is.
[1]
MOre Wine Boy; To be sober
Is sottish, in my opinion,
When so ne^^e we do see
The day that will free
Three Kingdoms and a Dominion.
CHORUS.
Then of with your Pots,
English, Irish, and Scots,
And loyal Cambro-Brittains,
From Lobster like jump
And the Head-playing Rump
You Will some have an acquittance.
[2]
Though Monck's mind ly's not open
To every eye that is busy,
A free Parliament
Is in his intent
No Noll, nor Lambert is he.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[3]
A Parliament untainted,
(Away with secluded Members:
New flames it might make,
^
^
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[4]
A Parliament of Members
That in blood and estate are no small Boys;
The divellish Rump-elves
Are for none but themselves,
Those will be (like God) for us all boys.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[5]
Such a Parliament more happy
Then Fishes will create you,
Though no trade you do drive
But to tipple and swive,
You Will be plump in flesh and estate too.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[6]
No Canaan to old England,
Were it rid of the Red-coate Philistian
Good Wine and a Cunny
Exceed Milk and Honey
In the sense of Cavalier Christian.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[7]
A Hound and a Hawk no longer
Shall be tokens of a Disaffection,
A Cock-fight shall cease
To be breach of the Peace,
And a Horse race an Insurrection.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[8]
The Stages to their freedom
Shall be restored soon after,
And Poets like Lictors
Shall scurge our Afflictors
And make our old sufferings our Laughter,
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[9]
Will, Pryn shall be the Master
OF the Revells (for's contrition,)
His Histrio-mastyx
Was one of his rash-tricks
Ever his early circumcision.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[10]
We Will preach and pray 'th out canting
In a language heaven know's better
Then Ah Lord repeating
And Hum and Ha bleating
With Calves of the Lips in the Letter.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[11]
We Will no more to enslave us
Wear Chains, but to boast our Riches,
We Lobsters will eat,
And not be their meat,
When the right Rump weare's the Breeches.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[12]
All Nations shall adore us*
(...) (...)ble,
The Dutchmen shall fear us,
^
And all to Mi(...) here us;
And the French cry votre tres-humble.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[13]
The Citizens shall flourish,
Lord Mayors, when the office expires,
Shall a Knighthood obtain,
If they are not of the strain
Of Excise, nor Church-land Buyers.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[14]
This London had effected
Ever now, and honor had got so,
But for Knaves Ireton
And Tichburn were known,
When the Drugster's Son was not so.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[15]
Each Year shall bring a Harvest
To the Plough-man, who was vexed ill
When but every fourth year
By the Tax-Calendar
It came like the Bissextile.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[16]
His Rent he shall pay duly,
Nor to spend shall he want his groat ever.
His Landlord shall be
Of his beer to him free,
And of's flesh to his Wife and his Daughter.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[17]
But now my serious fancyes,
A project is concocting,
When God shall have sent
A true Parliament,
What a Rope we shall do with this mockthing
Cho,
Then of with, etc.
[18]
Like Mare with dock to the Manger,
To show it no cheat at all is.
It like one does appear,
But it is none and where
The Head should have been the Tail is,
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[19]
Or we will send for the God of Lorrell,
Who cook't so neatly the Peak-feast,
And Hell Carbonado
It with little a-doe
To make the Devil a breakfast
Cho. Then of with, etc.

[20]
We read of a Rump in Saint Austin
Which (before this of ours) out-went all;
It sounds did let fly
As articularly
As it had had in it a Lenthall,
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[21]
But never poor Rum was firked
Like this by wits, and by no wits.
Nor ever was game
So fit as this same
To enter and flesh young Poets.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[22]
More good things I could utter
But now I find by a token,
That the Play will begin,
And good fortune come in
Ever the Prologue be quite spoken.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[23]
Charles Waine's ore the new Chimnie,
The Sun's near our Horizon,
The Fowls of the night
Are taking their flight,
Ever Cheshire Prey they seiz on.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[24]
We Will drink and pray no longer
For the King in mystical fashions
But with Trumpet's sound
His health shall go round,
And our Prayers be Proclamations.
Cho.
Then of with, etc.
[25]
Now Jockey, Teag, and Shenkin,
Pray no more to St. Andrew
To Patrick, or Davie,
But St. George, who, to save 'ee,
Against Dragon Rump like a man-drew.
Cho.
Then of with your pots
English, Irish, and Scots
And loyal Cambro-brittaines,
From Lobster-like Jump,
And the head-playing Rump
You Will soon have an acquittance.
FINIS.
