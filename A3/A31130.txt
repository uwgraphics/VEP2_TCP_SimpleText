THE CASE OF THE Children of Coll. John Burke, Commonly called Lord Bophin.
THE said Colonel Burke's Six Sons are brought up in the Protestant Religion,
the Two eldest of them are now at School in Eaton-College; and His Majesty
being sensible how much their Education in the Protestant Religion would
conduce to the Establishment of the Protestant Interest in Ireland, and how
good a President it was, has hitherto ordered a Maintenance for them out of
their Father's Forfeiture.

NOW so it is, that the said Colonel Burke's Forfeited Estate is to be
disposed of by the Bill relating to Irish Forfeitures, and as yet no Provision
is therein made for the said Childrens Maintenance, but are left exposed to the
utmost Want.

IT is therefore humbly hoped, That the Honorable the House of Commons will so
far Encourage the Increase of the Protestant Religion, as to provide Bread for
the Protestant Children of a Great and Noble Family out of their Father's
Estate.
