An Excellent New Hymn To the Mobile, exhorting them to Loyalty The Clean
contrary Way.
A popish Libell. 7. June. 1682.
^LEt Us advance the Good Old Cause; Fear not Tantivitiers, whose Threatenings
are as Senseless, as ^Our Jealousies and Fears; It Is We must perfect this Great
Work, and all the Tories Slay, ^And make the KING a Glorious Saint, The clean
contrary way.

[2]
It is for Liberty we Plot,
And for the Public Good,
By making Bishops go to Pot,
And shedding Guiltless Blood;
We Will Damn the Orthodoxal Beast,
And their Adherents Slay;
When these are down we shall be Blessed,
The clean contrary way.
[3]
When We the KING have Bankrupt lain,
Of Power and Crown berest him,
And all his Loyal Subjects Slain,
And none but Rebels left him;
When we have quite undone the Land,
By IGNORAMUS sway;
We Will settle the SUCCESSION, and
The clean contrary way.
[4]
It Is to Preserve His Majesty,
That We against Him rise,
The Righteous Cause can never Die
That Is Managed by the Wise;
The ASSOCIATION's a Just Thing,
And That does seem to say,
Who Fights for Us, Fights for the KING
The clean contrary way.
[5]
RELIGION still must be the intent,
The Nations Peace and Good,
The Privileges of PARLIAMENT
So Rarely Understood.
We Will pull the Laws and Reason down,
And Teach Men to Obey
Their Sovereign, and the Rights o'th Crown
The clean contrary way.
[6]
Our Properties we will upwards set,
By Imprisonment and Plunder,
And Needy Whigs Preferment get,
To keep all TORIES under:
We Will keep in Pension O and P
To SWEAR, and to BETRAY
The Intrest of the KING, To Advance
The clean contrary way.
[7]
What tho the KING be now misled
By the Old Popish Crew;
He Will find our Honesty has sped;
And give us all our Due:
For We (He knows) do Rail and PLOT,
REBELLION to Obey,
And that We stand for Peace and Truth,
The clean contrary way.
[8]
And now my Noble Countrymen,
You cannot doubt my Zeal,
That have so True and Loyal been
To KING and Commonweal;
And if at last We chance to Hang
For what We Do or Say;
Our Comfort is, to Heaven We Gang
The clean contrary way.
