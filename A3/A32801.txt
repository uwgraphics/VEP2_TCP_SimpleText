THE DIVINE TRINUNITY OF THE Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: OR, The blessed
Doctrine of the three Coessentiall Subsistents in the eternal Godhead without
any confusion or division of the distinct Subsistences, or multiplication of
the most single and entire Godhead, Acknowledged, believed, adored by
Christians, in opposition to Pagans, Jews, Mahumetans, blasphemous and
Antichristian Heretics, who say they are Christians, but are not. Declared and
Published for the edification and satisfaction of all such as worship the only
true God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, all three as one and the self same God
blessed for ever.

By FRANCIS CHEYNELL, Minister of that Gospel which is revealed from heaven by
Father, Son, and holy Spirit in the holy Scriptures of truth.

Academiae OXONIENSI: Electorum Senatui Reverendo, D. Dri. Reynoldes (...)

Quis Poetarum, Apolog* cap. 46.
quis Sophistarum qui non omnino de Prophetarum font potaverit? Nulla sine
sapientia suscipienda est Religio, Lactant.
nec ulla sine Religione sapientia probanda. Varii sunt disciplinarum sapores,
ingeniorum gustus; tota autem Christianorum salus in credendo, colendo, nec non
obediendo consistit. Doctrina nostra Christum auctorem laudat, Christumque
parat defensorem. Epiphan*
Noluit magnus olim Epiphanius, ut Christiani (...) gestarent, sed solo
Christianorum nomine contenti satis gauderent. Valete flosculi, and quicquid
est facundiorum deliciarum; nec medicamentis opus est, nec lenociniis ut
benevolentiam masculam, virilem, Academicam aucupemur. Haud aliter de rebus
Theologicis judico, quam de rebus Philosophicis judicabat Cicero. Cicero l. 3.
de finibus.
Istiusmodi res dicere ornate puerile est, plane aurem and perspicue expedire
posse, docti and intelligentis viri. Deum testem laudo me illis nec conscribere
nec vigilare qui in Theologicis conjecturas venari mallent, quam Scripturas
amplecti. Nostrum enim est Theologiam antiquam and pene antiquatam antiquitati
Primitivae restituere, and Doctrinae capitibus vetustis gratam quandam
novitatem, obscuris lucem, dubiis fidem, vel quasi postliminio superaddere. In
quo quidem opere quantopere desudandum sit, viri ut diffusissimae eruditionis,
ita sapientiae prope incomparabilis satis norunt. Nec Argumentum majus esse
potest, nec Praelector minor: quis enim ego qui tot clarissimis viris de
Academia nostra, imo de tota literarum Republica optime meritis succederem, vel
munus in hoc incomposito rerum statu infirmus obirem? Eheu nec fictis lachrymis
dolendum studiorum decus saeviente bello non mediocriter spretum jacuisse, Nec
inficias ivero in tam occupato vitae genere meditationes nostras satis acerbas
nec dum ad gustum Academicum satis maturuisse; and certe tantarum dimensionum
opus si non immensum, non adeo tumultuaria opera deproperari debet, ut officio
simul deesse (aliud quam hoc agens) and publico minus prodesse saltem
prudentibus videar.

In cogitationem autem sensim deveni, quantum mihi honoris Electorum Senatus
immerenti habitum iverit, quem dignati est is (R^verendi) ad functionem non
tantum in Academia, sed and in Ecclesia Dei tam celebrem obeundam vocatione
solenni honestare; quibus antem rationibus hanc difficilem scribendi provinciam
imo necessitatem deprecatus sim, probe norunt quibus imbecillitas nostra satis
not a est; At at de pudore nostro been subrustico (unico tenuitatis meae
praesidio) amici hac ex part nimium diligentes cogentibus amoris nec non
prudentiae machinis tandem triumpharunt. Omnibus itaque testatum volo quanti
piorum doctorumque auctoritatem facio, cum adversus judicium meum, and ultra
posse meum cum bono Deo hac in re Reverendorum decretis, amicorum monitis
paruerim saltem, si non satisfecerim. Sed nihil uti spero (Electores
ornatissimi) splendori nominis vestri been magni detrahet benevolentia vestra,
vel tenuitas nostra; non enim Sol eo minor est, quod loca lustret humilia, and

To the Worshipful FRANCIS ROVS Esquire The learned Provost of Eaton College.
SIR,
IT was the sad complaint of Hilary in his time, That there were as many Creeds
as Wills, Periculosum nobis est tot nunc Fides existere, quot voluntates, dum
aut ita Fides scribuntur ut volumus, aut ut volumus intelliguntur. Hilarious.
and every one presumed to alter the wholesome Form of sound Words, or else
wrest it to a corrupt sense. And you know the sense of a Creed is the Creed. In
these days of Libertinisme, men account it a kind of bondage to confine
themselves to a wholesome Form of sound words, though they are Verbis
consecratis utendum Quintil.
Consecrated words, and therefore such as cannot be condemned.

The Devil has set good men at variance about saeculal affairs, Private
interests and public rights, and in the mean time robs or cheates us of what
is spiritual and glorious, the purity of truth, the power and beauty of
holiness. We live in sad times, in which Atheism pleads for protection and
intolerable errors contend for a toleration. They who blaspheme Christ and his
Gospel in jest, The judgment of God upon scoffing Atheists.
are Atheists in good earnest (as Lucian and Rablais were) but God will plead
his own cause, if we will not. Lucian (as Suidas relates) was torn to pieces
with dogs, and Rablais died drunk with Wine and Atheism: We have good cause to
suppress and bewail the very first risings of natural Atheism; we must not
suffer any black suggestions or hovering thoughts which relish of Atheism to
roost and nestle in our hearts; In anima dicuntur esse, quae sunt in ea per
modum quietis; reliqua potius dicuntur esse ab anima, quam in anima, Vide
Bonavent. lib. 2. did. 38.
These extemporary thoughts, are sins which do proceed from us; but O let them
not be familiars, and inmates which lodge, and dwell within us. I fear that
Atheism may soon become a National sin in England, if there be an indulgence
(worse then any at Rome) vouchsafed to irregular fantasies, and appetites
under pious pretenses. They who deny the God head of Jesus Christ, and the Holy
Ghost, hope to escape censure in England, if they can have the favor to be
called devout Familists, although their blasphemy and wantonness does declare
them to be sensual Socinians, and beastly Atheists. The Socinians and
Familists have even already shamed the more modest Mahumetans. D. Pocockii
specime^n Hist. Arab. page 21. Annot. page 218. and 219.
Mr. Pocock (the learned and ingenuous Professor of Hebrew and Arabic in this
University, in his notes upon Gregory the Arabian Phaenix) assures me that the
Al Hayetians acknowledge the incarnation of the Eternal Word, and that we shall
all be judged by this Incarnate Word at the last day. The more moderate Turks
would stop their ears at the hearing of such blasphemies against Christ, as has
poisoned this English air. Some Mahumetans hold that Christus est Deus de novo
ortus, as the Socinians say, he is Deus factus, Subordinatus, etc. And the
Mahumetan-Sectaries talk just like our Familists, D. Pocock^ Annot. page 219.
Antinomians: etc. as will be evident to any one that will pursue M. Pococks
choice and learned Annotations. Licitum pronuntiant vino and scortationi
indulgere, and reliqua quae lege vetita sunt perpetrare; omittenda esse
censent, quae lege mandata sunt, page 261.
and oratione^. I am ashamed to English that with my pen, which some
Professors have translated in broad and foul English by their gross neglect
of duties, contempt of ordinances, and bold practice of abominable lewdness; I
will not mention their dreams of a Fantastical Hell, and Heaven. But sure I
am our Familists, Sunt ex Al^shiisqui hominum (...) statueru^t. vide D.
Pocockii Annot. p. 264.
and their Alshii speak the same Dialect, when they discourse of their being
Godded with God, and salute one whom they reverence with this Atheistall
complement, Tu est Tu, id est, Tu es Deus. Sir, you are what you are, you are
God! Henry Nicholas, the Father of the Family of Love, said of himself, I am
God. A man would think that our Familists had met with some Mahumetans at
Poland, or Constantinople, and some of the worst of them also. For All Gazalius
a precise and learned Mahumetan would teach them better langnage and behavior
also; He says that cleanlynesse is a part of Faith, and the Key of Prayer,
that we must have pure minds, clean hearts and hands. But enough of that.

Sir, Being encouraged by the Committee, for regulating this University, to
undertake a service which I even tremble to repeat, and you being Chaireman of
that Committee, I conceived my self obliged to present you with this Treatise.
When the University was pleased to elect me the L. Margarets Professor of
Divinity, the revenue due to that Professor by a grant made under the great
Seal of England 3io. Caroli, Apr. 20. 1649. This Act shall not extend to the
revenues of any publik professor or reader in either of the Universities. Ad
laudem and honorem sanctae and individuae Trinitatis, ac Fidei and
Christianorum augmentum.
was settled by special Act. And the University did purchase the lease of the
House and Meadows in Worcester, which belong to the said Professor, and would
(if they might have had the common privilege of leaseholders) have bought the
inheritance of the premises outright for ever; but the University is denied the
benefit of the lease and the common privilege aforesaid. The House and
Meadows are sold to others, and no revenue paid to the Professor. I desire
that the University may be righted, and that my successor may not suffer as I
have done. Sir, notwithstanding these discouragements, I conceived it my duty
either to read or write for the propagation of the Christian Faith, and honor
of the blessed Trinity according to the first Grant. I consulted the University
and your self, and you both concurred that rebus sic stantibus, it was better
to write then read, and that it did most conduce to the propagation of the
Christian Faith; Finally, that it was most requisite that I should write in
English, because since the beginning of the year 1645. 1645
there have been many blasphemous books to the great dishonor of the blessed
Trinity printed in England. But I have found the task far more difficult,
because there are many Socinian subtiltyes which will hardly bear English, and
I could not but take some notice of them, either by a Formal answer, or else
by a confirmation of that deep truth which they do with no less blasphemy,
then subtilty reject, deny. I have been forced sometimes to express my mind
in Latin in the margin, merely upon that account; but the plainest reader may
if he please to read the 4. 5. 8. and 9. Chapters, understand as much of this
mystery as is necessary to be known; and I am confident that the happy union
between the Mystery of Faith, and the practical Mystery of godliness is as
plainly represented in this little Treatise, as in any of the ancient or
modern Divines; for I have faithfully endeavored to give you the strength and
Quintessence of both in a familiar way with many experimental observations of
mine own, which I shall now reveiw and practice in my most retired condition.
But before I retire, give me leave to speak a word for my Brethren who are
eminent for all manner of learning, sound in the Faith, holy in their life, and
peaceable in their conversation; if men of such qualifications know not how to
rest in the present unsetlednesse of public affairs, and yet are ready to
perform all lawful things required of them for the defense and preservation
of the true Religion and public Liberties; why may not such be still employed
for the promoting of such a just Accommodation and Reformation as may
effectually advance the grand public interest, the power, purity and growth of
Religion in this land? you cannot look upon these men as enemies, and dare not
deal with them as the worst of Infidels (whom Christian See Weemse vo. 3.
Expos. of the judicial Law, cap. 15. Faithful Presbyterians described and
commended.
Princes have sometimes banished from their dominions) if you desire to have the
same common friends and enemies with Jesus Christ. Now which is the more
tolerable penalty, to be outlawed or banished, is not hard to determine. If
you look upon them as Presbyterians, it is no dishonor to them to be true to
their Principles in the midst of changes; it is a sign that they were never
friends to the Fortune of the Cause, but to the Cause it self; forgive them if
they know not how to pursue a new interest without new light or direction from
the word of God. Besides they are such Presbyterians as all godly and prudent
Independents will close with in the highest and sweetest acts of
Church Communion. For I am confident that no wise and godly men will
Practically separate from us in those very things in which they do Doctrinally
agree with us, Grounds of an happy union between godly men of both persuasions.
because that Text which they do so often cite, Philip 3. 15, 16. is
Demonstratively clear in this very point, and does manifestly condemn all
causeless Separation from lawful Communion with the godly members of
Reforming Churches. Si vultis vivere de Spiritu Sancto, tenete charitatem,
amate veritatem, desiderate unitatem, ut perveniatis ad aeternitatem.
Godly Presbyterians and Independents do. 1. Receive the same Officers,
Pastors, Teachers, Ruling Elders, and of the same qualification required in
the Rule set forth by the Parliament. 2. Admit Members of the same
qualification held forth by the Assembly, namely visible Saints, who being of

the Rules of Faith and Life delivered in the Word. Aug.
3. Desire that the above mentioned Officers should be incorporated in one
Eldership, Godly Independents do acknowledge Parochial Churches to be true
Churches of Christ.


Godly Independents do acknowledge that Parochial Churches (wherein Ministers
and others endeavor to remove all things justly offensive, that so all
ordinances may be administered in purity) are true Churches of Christ. 2. They
retain Communion with these Parochicall Churches by baptizing their Children,
and receiving the Lords Supper there, as occasion serves. And if occasional
Communion with us be lawful, constant Communion with us would not be sinful.
as to Sister-Churches, whenever they are offended at any irregular
administrations in as a means to humble them, and as an ordinance of God to
reduce them. Much more might be added: But it is clear from these premises,
that prudent and godly Independents cannot conceive themselves obliged



2. Nor can they say, that they are enforced to gather new Churches out of true
Reformed Churches; for a circumstantiall difference cannot be a sufficient
ground for leaving of all ordinary Communion with true reforming Churches. The
prudent and godly Presbyterians have set no bounds to themselves in their
Reformation but the Word of God; and therefore if the Independents will set
forth a complete Model of their whole Church Way, and Church Order, fully,
freely, and clearly, and prove it by plain Texts out of the holy Scriptures,
we shall thankfully receive whatsoever they shall convincingly impart. And I
shall be bold to say, Statesmen and Swordmen have kept godly Presbyterians and
Independents at too great a distance upon reasons of State.
that there had been a judicious, affectionate and practical Accommodation
between us (notwithstanding some speculative differences in notionall Ideas) if
there had been no interposition of Statesmen, or Swordmen, when the Committee
of Accommodation had sadly considered and reviewed all material Arguments on
this side, and on that; And if you set aside all reasons of State and saecular
considerations, I do not see why men who agree in the substance of the Service
and Worship of God, in the Directory according to the Preface, in the
Confession of Faith set forth by the Assembly, and in the Doctrine contained in
the Confessions and Writings of the reformed Churches, should not mind the same
thing, and walk by the same Rule, that there might be a Practical Communion
between us in all points wherein there is a Doctrinal Agreement, and we might
go hand in hand to heaven together, with meekness of wisdom, and sincerity of
love. Caveats for men of both persuasions
Let men of both persuasions beware of such a superstitious tenderness as does
usually arise from some unconscionable error, and unmortified lust, because it
is no privilege, but a judgment to be given up to error or lust; and from
such ensnaring liberty, which is indeed perfect bondage, good Lord deliver us.
No man is obliged to follow the Positive Praescript of an erroneous conscience
in any point or case whatsoever: Differences of Judgment did not extinguish the
relation of membership amongst the Romans and Corinthians. And it is certain
that the Substantials of Church Government must not be changed in every age
acording to the graduall differences of light in several persons and
Congregations. An expedient desired for an happy union between Presbyterians
and Independents Dum propter haec alter alteri Anathema esse caepit, nemo pene
Christi est. Hilarious.


We humbly desire that there may be a strict and mutual obligation
condescended to in some expedient by all godly men of both persuasions for
mutual edification, and for the preservation of all the Churches in these
Dominions in truth, godliness, and peace, that we may not pass unchristian
censures upon our Christian Brethren.

Let all private quarrels then fall to the ground, and let us mind the common
interest of the Lord Jesus, Caveats for Statesmen
and seriously promote it in our respective places in faith and love. And let
all Statesmen beware

1. That they do not fall into the same spiritual or civil evils which they
themselves have condemned in the King and Prelates. Remonstr. December. 15. 1641.


2. Beware of ERASTIANISME which does overthrow all Church Government,

3. Take heed of CIVIL SCEPTICISME which does overthrow the Fundamentals of
public Faith, and public rights, and plucks up all Civil Government, by the
roots.

4. Beware of Familisticall Polytheisme; the Familists affirm that there are
as many Christ's, as many Gods manifested in the flesh, as there are Saints on
earth. But to us there is but one God, Jer. 2. 11, 12, 28.
and one Lord Jesus Christ; it is enough for blind Pagans to talk of many Gods,
and many Mediators.

5. Beware of Atheism, the great Monster Ephesians complain of none but
robbers of Churches, and blasphemers, Acts 19. 37. But we have cause to
complain of them, and Apostates, Idolaters, Atheists, and what not?

Cotton is afraid that the Antichristian Whore will steal in at the Back-doore
of a Toleration. The Magistrates of England are engaged by the Oath of God to
root out whatsoever is contrary to sound Doctrine, and the Power of Godliness.
That man is seduced by a private Spirit (as you observe well in your Orthodox
Book) who lusts after envy, after Sects and Divisions; Catholic Charity, C.
1. p. 11, 12.
but the holy Spirit is a Catholic Spirit, a Spirit of Catholic Faith, and
Catholic love, an unreserved and universal Love to all that believe and love
the Lord Jesus Christ.

Let us then all hold fast the wholesome form of sound words in faith and
love. For they who waver against the credit of their own testimony, L. in Test.
Dig. de Testibus.
are not (as the Civilians say) to be heard or regarded, because they have lost
their credit. We are reserved for some service in this declining Age; and
therefore it does become us to be Orthodox Saints, steady Christians, that our
Posterity may imitate us, and see those glorious days, which some conceive are
come already, because they have attained a little vainglory in this Age of
vanity. The Writers of this present time, who seem to contradict one another
concerning the light and glory of these unhappy days, may as easily be
reconciled as Sophocles and Euripides were concerning the goodness of women.
Sophocles being asked the reason why he did always represent women in his
Tragedies as very good, whereas Euripides did ever represent them as very bad?
answered, that be and Euripides did not at all contradict one another; for
says he, I do ever represent women just as they should be, and Euripides just
as they are. In like manner some Writers represent these times just as they
should be, and others represent them just as they are. But I must needs condemn
those, who draw a crooked conclusion from the corrupt doctrine and manners of
this untoward and crooked generation, and infer that there is no Church of God
in England, because Antichristian and blasphemous Seducers are multiplied
without number, and favored in the Land, though all the Magistrates and godly
of the Nation are by one confederate Body, obliged by solemn Oath to root out
Idolatry, Blasphemy, Heresy, Schism, Profaneness, and whatsoever else is
contrary to sound doctrine, and the power of Godliness.

1. It is not denied that there is a fry of Achans in the Land. 2. The sins
condemned Foster-fathers of them. 3. We pray that they who have Mark. 16. 15.
Luke 24. 47. and therefore we are true and faithful to the King of Saints, and
Commonwealth of Israel. 5. There are thousands in England whose hearts bleed at
their eyes for the abominations of the Land; men that do seriously endeavor to
save themselves and others from this untoward generation, according to Peter's
direction, Act. 40. 6. The house of Jacob was the Church of God, and yet there
were foul faults, Incest, and murder found amongst his Sons. The Lord persuade
and encourage the Fathers of this Nation to be as zealous against the sins of
the Nation, as Jacob was against the sins of Reuben, Simeon and Levi. I must go
backwards here, Genesis 9. 23.
as Shem and Japhet did. I have not time to mention other things, but let all
such as have the power and bowels of Fathers, take heed that they do not
persecute or offend one of those little ones who believe in Christ, Mat. 18. 6.
much less undo one of those great ones, who have much of Christ, and his
Spirit reigning in them. Believe it Sir, there are a company (I put my self out
of the number) of Select men in Oxford; I know not whether there be, all things
considered, the like in the World again, men able and willing to promote the
Commonwealth of true Religion, public Liberty, and ingenuous learning for the
Commonweal and good of mankind in all Nations; for they are acquainted with
all necessary Arts, Sciences, and Languages, and dare throw the Gauntlet to the
proudest Champions in the Antichristian World. Some few of these may perhaps be
complained of by some Weathercockes, who can rather turn then crow, some
froward children who bite their mothers breasts, or vipers who would eat a way
to their own preferment through their mothers Bowels. It is not for want of
pride or ignorance that these afflict your doors and ears with unnecessary
complaints, which they prove just as Erucius did his against Roscius, who when
he was asked who told him so, he answered, No body; and when it was demanded
how the accusation would be proved, answered, In truth I know not. What is this
(says Tully pro Sexto Roscio) but to abuse the Laws and Judges, to object what
you cannot prove, nay, do not so much as endeavor to prove? It may be you will
reply as Hazael did, Am I a dog that I should be accessory to any grievous or
unrighteous Decree? You know what Hazael did; and you know that Asa was a good
man, and yet a Persecutor. But I hope that as you have been zealous for the
Reformation, so you will be zealous for the preservation of the University,
which is the earnest desire and prayer of

Sir, Your thankful Servant Fr. Cheynell.

To the Reader.
I must entreat you not to mistake the Printers oversights for my dictates. I
was seldom here to overlook the Press, and can only glance over the Book now
with a running eye. I leave it to your candor and judgment to correct ordinary
slips, but before you set your self to read, be pleased to correct these 3.
places.

In the Margin, page 28. b read thus, Actus divini considerati secundumid quod

The God of wisdom bless our endeavors. The grace of Christ, the love of the
Father, and Communion of the holy Spirit is the best portion; let us all beg it
for our selves, our friends, and our posterity in these evil days, and the
Lord send us a gracious return of all our Prayers at the Throne of grace, that
we may all find grace and mercy in this time of need.

CHAP. I.
The Godhead is Spiritual, Infinite, Incomprehensible.
WE read of the eternal Godhead in the Book of the Creature, Romans 1. 20. and
therefore I prize Philosophy because it is subservient to Divinity; nay that
Philosophy which manifests the Eternal Power and Godhead of our great Creator
is indeed and Truth, nothing else but Natural Divinity: This Natural Divinity
is called The truth, Romans 1. 18. and it is a Divine Truth, because it does
declare (...), all that can be known of God by the light of nature, Romans 1. 19,
20. I subscribe to that of Clemens Alexandrinus: We ought not to swear
allegiance to any sect of Philosophers, whether Stoics, Epicures, Platonists
or Peripatetiques, but we must select and embrace whatsoever is true and
faithfully delivered concerning God by any Sect Proverbia etiam non Christianis
familiaria apud Tertullianum, Deus videt Deus reddet, si Deus voluerit, quod
Deus dederit, Deo commendo, Deus inter nos judicabit, etc. id ipsum de
monstrant. Summum illud and aeternum neque mutabile neque interiturum. Tacitus,
(...). Thales (...). Philemon.

Nec vero Deus qui intelligitur a nobis alio modo intelligi potest quam men's
soluta quaedam and libera segregata ab omni concretione mortali, omnia sentiens
and movens. Cicero. Plato in Phaedro and lib. 10. de legibus. Vide Clem.
Alexand. lib. 1. Stromat. Genesis 9 6. Jam. 3. 9. Romans 2. 14, 15.

Vide sis dicta Poetarum apud Stobaeum ab. H. Grotio emendata. Aquin. Contra
Gent. R. de Sabunde de Theologia Naturali. A. S. Eugubinus de perenni
Philosophia. G. Pacardum de Theolog. Naturali. P. Mornaeum. Aug. de Civit. Dei.
Theodoret. de curand. Graec. affectibus Clem. Alexand. Basilium, etc.


; and the Truth selected out of all Sects is not vain Philosophy, but Natural
Divinity. There is something of the Image of God and Law of Nature written in
our hearts and consciences, as is evident by common experience and plain
testimonies of the world of God, and therefore the Scripture does not condemn
all Philosophy, but vain Philosophy, Colos. 2.

These natural notions of the eternal Godhead should excite us to enquire
farther after God as the Apostle shows in Acts 17. ver. 27. because though our
natural notions concerning God are true, yet they are such imperfect and
obscure notions, or rather hints, that we are by reason of the corruption of
our nature, very apt to abuse them, and therefore we must regulate them by the
Word of God.

The (...), uti Antiphanes Socraticus. (...) Xenophon.
Godhead is Spiritual, and therefore invisible; the Professors of Wisdom
became fools, when upon a clear sight of some invisible things of God they
changed the glory of God into a visible Image made like unto corruptible man,
and unreasonable creatures; such Images are both Artificial and Real lies; for
by making Images of God, these learned Fools changed the truth of God into a
Lie, and then adored and worshipped their own lies, Romans 1. 20, 23, 25.

The Godhead is Infinite, and the Immensity of Gods perfection cannot be
measured by any created understanding. God is great, and his greatness is
unsearchable Tunc digne Deum aestimamus cum inaestimabile^ dicimus. Haebreorum
Deum (...) vocat Lucianus. Dion Cassius (...) ineffabilem and inconspicuum.
Theologia notitias naturales excolit, and confirmat. Deus elegit stulta mundi
ad confusionem Philosophiae. Tertul. Praescript. adversus Haereticos Theologia
non subjicitur Philosophiae sed praeficitur. Catechismus negat Philosophi^m non
Philosophia Catechismum, Lu^her. Vera Philosophia est naturalis Theologia;
concurrit gemina patefactio, naturalis and supernaturalis, gemina authoritas,
gemina lux. Haec itaque loquendicausa de ineffabilibus diximus ut fari aliquo
modo possemus quod effari nullo modo possumus. Vide Aug. de Trinitate lib. 7.
c. 4. Qui vult sapiens fieri in Aristotele, stultificetur ante in Christo.
Lutherus. Tunc stultus Plato cum suis discipulis, etc. Tertul.
, Psalm. 145. 3. The greatness of God is not a greatness of Bulk and Quantity,
but of Perfection and Excellency; he is great in Power, and his understanding
is Infinite, Ps. 147. 5. and therefore his understanding is unsearchable, Isa.
40. 28 when men and Angels search farthest into Gods perfection, they do most
of all discover their own imperfection, for God will make them know that the
secrets of his wisdom are double to that which they behold, and that it is
impossible by our most accurate disquisition to find out the Almighty unto
perfection, Job 11. 6, 7. but we may find him out unto salvation in the holy
Scriptures.

If we sum up all that the Philosophers and Schoolmen can attain to in their
discourses of this first Principle, it will amount to no more then this; Men
and Angels can never comprehend that perfection which dwells in God; for the
perfection of God is Infinite, and therefore ^ncomprehensible.

Let Schoolers examine t^is brief account, Deus est ^ns, Ens entium, Essentia
Essentiarum, Ens purum, Ens Simplex, Ens simpliciter Simplex, Ens Absolutum,
Ens Necessarium, Ens Absolute necessarium. Ens Primum, aeternum, independens,
perfectum infinitum, infinite perfectum, and proinde immensum. Let us therefore
study, believe and embrace the holy Scriptures, which may satisfy and save us.

I confess I have been very much taken with some discourses in Aristotle's
(...). Nihil praestantius Deo; ab eo igitur Mundum regi necesse est. Cicero.
Vide que Operum initio extant apud Hesiodum. Si Deus est animus nobis ut
ca^mina ^^cunt, etc.
Metaphysics concerning the spiritual and eternal efficacy of the first
Principle, first mover or prime understanding, whose very Essence, Substance,
Nature and Being is a spiritual and Eternal Self-efficacy, from whence it was
easy to demonstrate the Self-sufficiency and All Sufficiency of this Eternal
understanding, and from thence to infer that this Eternal Spirit, whose very
Being is Efficacy (or as we say a pure Act) should be effectually obeyed and
sincerely worshipped with pure and spiritual worship.

I shall not examine those passages which are usually cited out of Plato,
Iamblichus Trismegistus and others upon this subject, because it is clear to me
that those glorious mysteries which they did either discourse or treat of were
discovered to them by an Hebrew light. Vide Just. Mar. Protrep. Lactan. Eusebius.
de praeparat. Evan. Aug. de Civit. D^i, de doct Christiana Hiera^ym. Epistola
ad magnum oratorem Mar^il. F^cinum. Alcin. de doctrina Platonis. B^ssarion.
Va^es. de Phil^^. Sacr. l. S. Fugubinum, Lemnium, Al^iedium, Philonem Iudaeum

Exodus p 94. Gat^k. lib. p. 262. Amel. Pl^ton, Justin. Martyr. Apol. 2. Tertu^.
Apol. c. 44.
Plato was not called the Atticising Moses in vain, Clemens Alexandrinus and
diverse others have said enough of that, and saved me the labor of a learned
Digression upon that subject; and it is conceived that Christians have inserted
such passages into the works of Heathens.

The Platonists say Lumen est umbra Dei, Deus est lumen luminis. The Aposile
says God is light, and in him is no darkness at all: That is, God is
perfection it self without any imperfection at all, 1 John 1. 5. God is a pure
Act, God is one Single Infinite Perfection. And therefore as Vid. Senec. l. 7.
Natural. Qu. De Deo etiam vera dicere periculosum est.
Seneca said, we had need compose our whole man into an Argument of Modesty
when we discourse of the nature of God, lest we speak any thing rashly, or
affirm any thing that is untrue.

The works of God are great, and his thoughts (Decrees and Counsels) very deep,
Psalm. 92. 5. Who then is able to sound the depth of his natural perfection,
whose immense perfection is like a Sea (if there were any such) which has
neither banks nor bottom; who can sound a bottomless depth, or define an
infinite perfection? God is near us, nay in us, and yet far off from us;
there is an infinite distance between his excellency and our infirmity Excedit
supereminentia Deitatis humani eloquii facultatem. Veri^^s enim cogitatur Deus
quam dicitur: Et verius est quam cogitatur. August. de Trinit. lib 7.
: he is far off from our senses and from our understanding; and therefore
instead of begging longer time as the Philosopher did, I will conclude as the
wise man does, Eccl. 7. 23, 24. All this have I proved by Wisdom: I said I will
be wise, but it was far from me; That which is far off and exceeding deep,
who can find it out? Heraclitus put forth a pretty Riddle. If (...).
Heraclitus (...), etc. Philemen.
you do not hope for something above hope, you shall never find out that which
can never be found. It is safer as the Poet said, to believe and worship God
then to pry into him. Nam praeter ipsum quaerere acquires nihil. How much
Raymundus de Sabunde, A. Steuchus Eugubinus, Pacardus and others would have
found without the help of the Scripture, let such as are spiritually judicious
judge.

CHAP. II.
GOD is the First, Eternal and Independent Being, the Fountain of all Being
and Well-Being, and therefore cannot but Be, Exist, and persist in Being.
IT is a Rule generally received in the Schools, that all creatures Omnes
creaturae plus habent non-Entis. qua^ Entis.
have more of imperfection and nothingnes, then they have of Being or
Perfection. But all Being, the whole of being is in God. God is principium
totius esse, the fountain of all Being, and wel-being, the only self-being.

God is the Deus solus est (...), quia se, and per se est, a quo, in quo, per
quem and propter quem sunt quaecunque sunt; omnia quippe Deus aut in tempore
sustentat in ipsis, aut aeternum in se.
First, Eternal and Independent Being, and therefore can have no Cause of his
Being without himself, or above himself, because he was before, and is above
all Causes, (...).
Isa. 44. 6. God is the First and the Last; he is everlasting, and therefore
can have no Efficient or Final Cause; and it is utterly impossible that God
should have any Matter or Form, or any thing answerable to either, because it
is impossible that any thing should set bounds to his Boundless Being, (...).
and infinite perfection.

God is (...) says the Philosopher, and (...) says the Divine, but we must
(as the Schools state the point) understand both Sensu Negativo, because God
has his Being not from any other, but from himself; and God is said to have
his Being from himself, because his very nature and Essence are necessary Qui
v^re, necessario and absolute est essentia primo and per se est, imo a seipso,
and per seipsum existit, and proinde non potest non existere. (...). Rev. 1. 4
Vide Hieronym. Epist. ad Marcel. de X. Dei nominibus.
, and therefore we cannot conceive the Divine Essence to be void of existence;
it is utterly impossible that God should not exist, because the Divine Nature
is a pure Act, an absolute, necessary, eternal, infinite, independent, single
Being. We must not conceive that God was first in a naked Power of Being, and
was afterward reduced unto actual Being by his own effectual Power, as if
his Existence were really distinct from his Essence, or did virtually flow
from, and consequently depend upon his Essence, as its proper cause. For it is
manifestly absurd to conceive this pure, infinite and eternal Being not to be
in Act, since it is a pure Act. God does declare the incomprehensible purity of
his infinite and single Being in that amazing and yet edifying text, I am that
I am, (...). Sept.
Exodus 3. 14. as if he had said there is nothing in your God which is not God;
my Attributes do not differ from my self, my Being is absolutely necessary,
every way perfect, altogether pure, single and infinite. I do therefore
conclude as Hierome, Vid. Heronym. ad Ephesians. c. 3.
That the very nature of God is being it self, and therefore he ever was and
cannot cease to be; he cannot borrow his Being from any thing, who gives Being
and wel-being to all things. The absolute and independent necessity of the
Divine-Being does demonstrate its eternity, and therefore Omnia tempo^a
conjuncti de Deo dicta aeternitatem connotant. Rev. 1. 8.
all the differences of time are untied by the Talmudists, to connote the
Eternity of God in that text, Exodus 3. 14. according to that excellent
Commentary made by the Apostle, Rev. 1. 8. God is the Almighty, which is, and
which was, and which is to come. Hence it is that some have thought fit to
translate that text, Exodus 3. 14. according to the full scope of the Future
amongst the Hebrews, I am that I am that I was, and that I will be. For the
Future Futurum trium temporum differentias ^n se continet. (...). Qui erat, qui
est, and semper est, uti Epiphanius contra Archonticos. Futurum perseverantiam
essendi denotat and independentiam.
amongst the Hebrews, points at all differences of time past, present and to
come; but others observing the strict and proper signification of the Future,
translate it thus, I will be that I will be. The Angel of the waters does unite
all differences of time in that grateful acknowledgement, Rev. 16. 5. Thou art
righteous O Lord, which art, and wast, and shall be, because thou have judged
thus. And Jesus Christ, (who is one and the same God with his father,) is the
same yesterday, and to day, and for ever, Heb. 3. 8. The Rabbines upon Exodus 3.
14. Ainsw. on Exodus 3. 14. D. Riv. on the same place
express themselves after this manner, The blessed God said unto Moses, say
unto them, I that have been, and I the same now, and I the same for time to
come, etc. or as others more agreeable to the Chaldee Paraphrase, I, he that
is, and was, and hereafter will be, has sent me unto you. But enough of that;
it is now time to conclude that this first and independent Being cannot be
measured in it self, because it is infinite, nor in its causes, for it has
(...). Romans 11. 36.
no causes, but is from it self, of it self, by it self and for it self; for as
the Apostle says, All things are of him, and through him, and to him; to him
be glory for ever. Amen.

CHAP. III.
God has sufficiently and graciously revealed himself in his holy word for our
edification and salvation.
THis incomprensible God, who is of himself and for himself, cannot be made
known to his creatures but by himself: Men and Angels cannot know him any
further then he is pleased to reveal himself unto them.

The word of God is pure and perfect, it does fully discover Gods mind and our
duty. The Scriptures Dogmata Theologica non sunt vera quia Ecclesia ita
testatur, sed quia Deus ita testatur in Scripturis aeternae veritatis.
direct us in all points of faith, in all parts of worship, and in all passages
of our life and conversation; there is the whole body of Religion, and the only
right way to salvation sufficiently and graciously revealed unto us by God
himself; for God is the Author, Object, End of true Religion, and is the only
happiness and salvation of his chosen People, and therefore God alone can
direct us how to serve and enjoy his own blessed self, in an acceptable and
comfortable way, for his glory and our own everlasting satisfaction.

The Jesuits tell us that the Scriptures are but a partial Rule, and that we
must be beholding to some unwritten word or tradition for the proof of some
points, which are necessary to be known and believed for our everlasting
salvation. Some instance in the Doctrine of the Trinity, others in the Worship
of the Holy Ghost. The Papists do generally acknowledge that it is necessary
for the attainment o^ salvation to believe the number of the Persons of the
Trinity, and their consubstantiality, because no man can be saved who does not
believe in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, in all three as in the only true
God, one and the self same God blessed for ever; but some of them deny that
this mystery is sufficiently revealed in the written word, and therefore I
shall make it my business to confute them, and all that adhere unto them in
the following Treatise. The saving knowledge of God in Christ is revealed by
the Spirit speaking in the Scriptures of truth; nay Father, Son and Holy Ghost
do all join in revealing to us the saving mystery of faith and godliness,
that by the grace of Christ, the love of God, and Communion of the Holy Ghost,
we may have a glorious fellowship with all three as one God, the only true God,
whom to know is life eternal, John 17. 3. we are taught by the father to come
to Christ for salvation, John 6. 45. we are taught by the son, John 1. 18. Heb.
1. 2. we are taught by the Spirit, Heb. 3. 7. Rev. 2. 29. and 1 John 5. 6. the
Spirit does bear witness after an especial manner to this saving truth: it
is the spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth: yet all three
(and therefore the whole Trinity, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,) do
join in bearing record, and their record is written, for it stands upon Record
in the Gospel, and their Record is a saving Record, and there can be no other
Record produced to prove that Christ is our Savior, 1 John 5. 7, 11, 12, 13,
20. John 20 31. if we study the Scriptures Vide Nazian^. lib. 5. de Theologia.
Epiphanium Apostolicos redarguentem. Chrysostom. in 1 Cor. cap. 2. Basilium in
Ethicis.
, believe, apply them, worship and act according to them, we shall be saved by
our faith in the written Trinity; in Father, Son and Holy Ghost, without the
help of any unwritten tradition whatsoever; for the holy Scriptures are able to
furnish the Man of God unto Perfection, and make the simple wise unto
salvation, 2 Timothy 3. 15, 16, 17. Cyrillus lib. de Trinit. and persona Christi.
a Wegel. edit.
Cyrill in his Book of the Trinity and Person of Christ, put forth not long
since by Wegeline, says that he would not speak or think any thing of God, but
what is written in his Word. Clemens Alexandrinus Vide Clem. Alex. stromat.
lib. 7. (...).
says that we ought to make good every point in question by the Word of God,
because that is the surest, nay that is the only Demonstration; he speaks of
Theological Demonstration, nothing can be embraced with a divine faith, but
that which is delivered to us upon Divine Testimony; and we are to seek for the
Testimony of God, nowhere but in the written Word of God, and therefore Basil
disputes after this manner, Whatsoever is not in the written Word of God is not
of faith, and whatsoever is not of faith is sin, and therefore it is a sin to
obtrude any Doctrine upon the conscience as an Article of faith, which is not
written in the Vide Basil. Ascet. Reg. 80. (...). Nihil est de fide nisi quod
Deus per Apostolos and Prophetas revelavit, aut quod inde evidenter deducitur.
Bellarm. l 4. de verbo Dei c. 9.
Word of God, Putean is bold to say, that if Basil his meaning was according to
his words, he was a Hugonot, that is as we use to say, a Puritan.

When I read what the Papists write on this Argument, I stand amazed at their
blasphemies, and am unwilling to stain my paper with the repetition of them;
they who have read Canus, Hosius, Costerus, Eckius, Gautierus, Charronaeus,
Stapleton, and the rest of that rabble, will not wonder that the Socinians call
the Doctrine of 3. Persons and one God into question, when the Papists who were
baptized in the name of the Trinity, and profess that they believe the
equality of three distinct Subsistences in the same divine Essence, do yet
notwithstanding in their writings grant as much as the Socinians need prove,
namely that the Doctrine of the distinction and equality of Persons in the same
Divine Essence cannot be proved but by unwritten Traditions, by the testimony
of the Church of Rome, etc. and yet diverse Papists undertake to defend the
doctrine of the Trinity against the Socinians, though they know that the
Socinians do not at all value traditions or the testimony of the Church of
Rome; and therefore though diverse Papists write against the Socinians, yet they
do promote Socinianisme by their vain doctrine of unwritten traditions.
Stapleton is not ashamed to deny that it can be proved out of Scripture that
the Holy Ghost is God, or that he is to be worshipped.

But Salmeron Vide Salmer. in 2 Epist. ad Timoth. Disput. 4.
deserves commendation in this point; The Scriptures says he, are therefore
said to be written by divine inspiration, because they instruct us in divine
mysteries, concerning the Unity of God, and Trinity of Persons.

Photius Phot. Biblioth. (...)
in his Bibliotheca shows, that Ephraeni did not dispute of the consubstantiall
Trinity out of the Testimonies of Fathers, but out of the Holy Scriptures;
Justin Martyr, Athanasius, Basil, Irenaeus, Cyrill, Cyprian, Tertullian,
Epiphanius, Theodoret, and many other of the Fathers did assert the doctrine of
the Trinity, and some of them did confute the Valentinians, Eunomians,
Sabellians, Photinians, Arrians, Macedonians. Samosatenians, etc. out of the
Holy Scriptures. The Nicene Synod did urge Scripture for the maintenance of the
truth, which they declared in the Confession of their Faith; and the Synod
which met at Constantinople did the like, as is most evident to such as have

Records. Athanasius confounded the Arians by clear Testimonies of Scripture,
and in his Book of the Decrees of the Nicene Synod, he says that the true
disciples of Christ, do clearly understand the doctrine of the Holy Trinity
preached by divine Scripture. I shall not trouble or amuse the Reader by
quotations out of Cyrill, Ambrose, Hilary, Augustine, Nyssen, Nazianzen, or any
of those Worthies but now mentioned, whose labors have been ever famous in the
Church of God; yet I must not omit one pregnant proof out of Augustine, who
appealed from the Nicene and Ariminensian Synods, and challenged Maximinus to
dispute with him about the great point of consubstantiality out of the
Scriptures. Bellarmine himself is forced to confess that Augustine had good
reason to do so, because that point is clear by Scripture; but then we must
likewise consider what Augustine says upon this Argument, that Quod express
non habetur in Scripturis, potest tamen inde evidenter deduci. Vocabulum in
Scripturis non legimus; rem cui hoc vocabulum recte adhibitum est, fideique
sensum invenimus. Vide Augustinum Epist. 174. ubi contra Pascentium Arianum

the thing (or sense of any word) may be in Scripture though the word it self
be not to be found there, though the words Trinity Trin-unity, Consubstantial,
are not found in Scripture, yet that which is signified by those words may be
clearly proved by the holy Scriptures. These three are one; I and my Father are
one; Behold a Trinity Trin-unity, Consubstantiality, and all quickly proved.

That Rule is of great concernment and very pertinent to the point in hand,
which Augustine delivers in his third Book and third Chapter against Maximinus
the Arian. Out of those things which we read in Scripture we may collect some
things which we do not read, and so both understand and believe the thing which
is delivered in other words in Scripture, then those which we are now forced to
use, that we may confirm the Orthodox Christians, and refute the gainsayers.
But I am weary of this task, and therefore call upon my Reader to join with me
in searching the Scriptures that we may find out the truth; for reason cannot
demonstrate or comprehend these mysteries of faith; and the Rule is, Rationum
fulcro dissoluto humana concidit authoritas.

CHAP. IV.
This single and Eternal Godhead does subsist in Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
without any multiplication of the Godhead.
WHen Greg. Nyssen. contra Eunom. lib. 1. (...), etc.
Gregory Nyssen undertook to confute the artificial blasphemy of Eunomius, he
desired that the true God, the Son of the true God, and the Holy Spirit would
direct him into all truth. I have likewise implored the Divine assistance of
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, that I may open this Mystery of the single
Godhead in three distinct Subsistences, with faith and prudence, perspicuity
and reverence. I consider that the Godhead is Spiritual, and therefore I desire
to avoid all carnal expressions in a Treatise of this nature.

There is a twofold knowledge of God, Absolute, and Relative; the Absolute
knowledge of the Eternal Power and Godhead is in part discovered by the works
of God, as has been shown in the first chapter; but the Relative knowledge of
God (I speak of inward relations between the three Subsistences) is not, nay
cannot be attained unto by the light of nature; no example can illustrate, no
reason Angelical or humane comprehend the hidden excellency of this glorious
Mystery, but it is discovered to us by a Divine Revelation in the written word,
and therefore our faith must receive, and our piety admire what our reason
cannot comprehend. It is fit therefore that this Grand Mystery of the Divine
Trinunity should be soberly explained, that it may be steadfastly believed, and
reverently applied in all Evangelical administrations.

We read of the Godhead, the Nature and Subsistence of God in the holy Job 12.
16. Pro. 8. 14. Isa. 28. 29. Gal. 4. 8. Phil. 2. 6. Col. 2. 9.
Scriptures. 1. The Godhead, (...) Romans 1. 20.(...) Coloss. 2. 9. (...) Acts
17. 29 I am not at leisure to play the Critique upon the words, it is enough
for my purpose simply to declare the truth in the most plain and simple manner.

2. The Nature of God is held forth to us in the holy Scriptures, which forbid
us to give Divine honor to any of those things which are not Gods by Nature,
Gal. 4. 8 For the Apostle in that place reproves their Idolatry, and tells them,
that when they knew not God (that is the only true God who is God by Nature,
because truly God) they did service to them which by Nature are no Gods; from
whence it is easy to conclude that the only true God whom we ought to serve,
is God by nature: and we read of the Divine Nature, 2 Pet. 1. 4. of which all
that are regenerate are said to be partakers, because they bear his Image; for
else it is evident that there is an infinite distance between God, and grace,
which is not only finite, but imperfect also, and if it were perfected is but
an accident; Nay, there is an infinite distance between the Nature of God, and
nature of man in respect of Excellency, even then when the two natures are most
intimately united as they are by an Hypostatical union in the person of the
Lord Jesus.

3. This only true God, The Subsistence of the Godhead. (...).
who is God by nature, does subsist. And if we will seek after him, we shall
find that he does not subsist very far from any of us, Act. 17. 27. But the
Godhead does not subsist out of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. For all the
fullness of the self-same Godhead is in every one of the three: and therefore
the name of God is attributed to every one of the three, in holy Writ. The
three divine Subsistences.


1. To the Father. Romans 7. 25. Rom 8. 3.

2. To the Son. Act. 20. 28. Tit. 2. 13. 1 Timothy 3. 16. 1 Timothy 6, 15, 16.

3. To the Holy Ghost. Act. 5. 3, 4. Ps. 95. 3. 8, 9 compared with Heb. 3. 1
Cor. 3. 16, 17, Heb. 1. 1. compared with 2 Pet. 1. 21. 1 Cor. 12. 5, 6. And
when the name of God is specially attributed to the Father (in regard of order,
and that gracious dispensation which is by consent of all three vouchsafed for
our salvation) the Son and Spirit are not excluded, as we shall prove at large
in this very Chapter.

1. The eternal Godhead does subsist in the Father; 1. The Subsistence of the
Father.
for we read of his subsistence, Heb. 1. 3. Christ is the express image of his
Fathers subsistence or person, as we do commonly translate the word: but I do
not hear that any but gross Atheists have been so bold as to deny the
subsistence of God the Father; and therefore I need not superadde any thing to
so plain a Text.

2. The same Godhead does subsist in the Lord Jesus, 2. The Subsistence of the
Son.
who is equal to the Father, because he does subsist in the nature of God,
Phil. 2. 6. The word (...) is best rendered subsisting, in that place; because
there is a comparison there between two subsistences or persons, the Father and
the Son; and therefore the Son counts it no robbery to be equal with the
Father, (...).
because he subsists in the nature of God. He has the same Divine nature, the
same Godhead with the Father and all the fulness of the Godhead dwells truly,
Vide D. Davenant. in Coloss. 2. 9.
really, bodily in the Son; for Body is opposed to shadow. Nay it may be
rendered thus: The Godhead dwells personally in the Son: for (...) does many
times signify a person; and therefore some learned men take (...) to be as
much as (...): All the fullness of the Godhead dwells really in the subsistence
or person of the Son, Col. ^. 9. Christ is the illustrious brightness of his
Fathers glory, the lively character of his Fathers subsistence or person, Heb.
1. 3. Christ is not the character of his own subsistence, but of his Fathers
subsistence; and therefore the Son has a peculiar subsistence distinct from
the subsistence of his Father. Christ is the express image of his Fathers
person, and therefore the person of the Son is distinct from the person of the
Father; for no person is the image or character of it self. Concerning the word
Subsistence or Person, I shall speak fully in the two next Chapters, and make
it evident that the Divine subsistences or Persons do infinitely excel the
subsistences or persons of Men and Angels. In the mean time I shall clearly
prove, that the Godhead does subsist in the Son, and Holy Spirit.

The Godhead does subsist in Jesus Christ, who was before the beginning, Jesus
Christ is truly God.
Ioh. 1. 1. [Was] does note what is past; and therefore had his being before
the beginning of time: And that his eternal being is a divine being, is clear,
because eternal, and because it is not only said, that he was with God before
the beginning, but he was God; and therefore it does clearly follow, that Jesus
Christ is the same eternal God with his Father; for it is impossible that
there should be more then one God, as I shall clearly demonstrate before I
conclude this Chapter.

I wonder at the impudent blasphemy of some who pretend to be Saints, in these
days of error and vanity; and yet are bold to affirm, that they themselves
are as well, and as truly God, as Jesus Christ; because it is said that they
have their being in God, Act. 17. 28. are partakers of the Divine nature, 2
Pet. 1. 4. and are one with Christ, Joh. 17. 21, 22, 23, 26.

I shall entreat the men of this persuasion is over all God blessed for ever,
Romans 9. 5. God manifest in the flesh, The Divine titles of Jesus Christ, prove
his Person to be divine, and one of the natures united in his person to be
divine.
1 Timothy 3. 16. The blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of
lords, who only has immortality, etc. to whom honor and power everlasting is
ascribed, 1 Timothy 6. 16. He is the great God, Tit. 2. 13. The true God, 1 John
5. 20. Dares any mortal man lay claim to these titles and this honor? To
which of the Saints or Angels did God say at any time, Thou art my son, the
heir of all things, the illustrious brightness of my glory, and lively
character of my person Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, and all the
Angels of God shall worship thee, Heb. 1. These things are so clear and plain,
that I am even almost ashamed to write more upon this Argument; and yet I am
encouraged and even provoked to proceed. Jesus Christ was the Wonderful Child;
a Child, and yet a Father, the Father of Eternity Isa. 9. 6. En infantem
aeternitatis Patrem, En parvulum optimum maximum, Deum maximum.
; a Child, and yet a Counselor, the wisest of all Counselors, for he is
Wisdom it self; a Child, and yet a God, a mighty God. Isa. 9. 6. Certainly
this one Text is sufficient to put them to the blush who presume to compare
themselves with the Lord Jesus, the mighty God.

Jehovah Christ is Jehovah and therefore he is God. Ehie Jehova and quod ex eo
contractum est I^h ab Haja vel hava (Esse) derivantur, Essentiam infinitam
notant. Nomen itaque Jehovae (cui reliqua duo sunt aequalia) Deo proprium est.
Gomarus oper. par. 3. disp. 2. de Deo vero.
is a Title proper and peculiar unto God, Isa. 43. 11, 12. Jehovah is the only
Savior, the only God and Psalm. 83. 18. That men may know that thou whose name
alone is Jehovah, art the most High over all the earth.

But the Lord Christ is Jehovah; and therefore the Lord Christ is God. Jehovah
sits on a Throne in majesty and glory, Isa. 6. 1, 3, 5, 8. but the Lord Christ
is this Jehovah, as the Apostle assures us. Ioh. 12. 41, 42 The Lord Christ is
that Jehovah to whom every knee must bow; as appears by comparing Isa. 45. 21,
22, 23, 24, 25. with Romans 14. 9 10, 11, 12. and Phil. 2. 6, 9, 10, 11. The like
is clear by comparing Psalm. 102. 19. 22, 25, 26. with Heb. 1. 10, 11, 12. Once
more, compare Number. 14. 26, 27. with 1 Cor. 10. 9, 10. and Number. 21. 6. And hence
it is that Christ is so gloriously described, Rev. 1. 5, 6, 7, 8. He is Alpha
and Omega, the beginning and the ending, which is which was, and which is to
come, the Almighty. And therefore he is Jehovah. For the Apostle does in that
place, and so to the end of that Chapter, insist upon these and the like
expressions which do comprise in them the sense and meaning of that divine and
glorious Title of Jehovah. I might farther insist upon this argument, and show
that the Title of Lord so often given to Christ in the New Testament, does
answer to the Title of Jehovah in the Old Testament. And as some Reverend
Divines conceive, the Apostles did purposely use the title of Lord, that they
might not offend the Jews with the frequent pronouncing of the word Jehovah.
Thou shall fear Jehovah thy God, Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Deuteronomy. 10. 20. is rendered by the
Apostle, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, Mat. 4. 10. And so Deuteronomy. 6. 5.
Thou shall love Jehovah thy God, is rendered Matthew. 22. 37. Thou shall love the
Lord thy God. I hope no Saint will presume to arrogate the Title of Jehovah to
himself; for he whose Name alone is Jehovah is the mighty God, the most High
over all the earth.

Jesus Christ is Immanuel, Jesus Christ is Immanuel
God with us, Matthew. 1. 23. that God who took flesh and blood, 1 Timothy 3. 16.
and that God who redeemed the Church with his own blood, Acts 20. 28.

The Ancients insist much upon that proof John 16. 15. All things that the
Father has are mine, compared with John 10. 30. I and my Father are one, and
John 10. 37. If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; for from hence
they do conclude, that Christ has the same divine nature and Godhead with the
Father; they both have the same divine and essential Titles and Attributes,
and perform the same inward operations in reference to all Creatures
whatsoever; and therefore Epiphan. contra Apostolicos. Vide Cyril. lum in Ioh.
cap. 3. and 8. Hiuro. in Zach. 2. Ambr. l. 5. de fide cap. 4. Aug. contra
Pascen tium; nemo igitur jam calumniaturde verbo; et si enim verbum ipsum in
Lege scriptum non reperitur, res tamen reperitur, ego et Pater unum sumus
Epist. 174.
they did farther infer, that they had reason to use the word
Consubstantiall; for though the word is not in Scripture, yet the sense and
meaning of it is Orthodox and Canonical, because evidently deduced from these
Texts and some other Scriptures which we have insisted on before. I shall add
one Scripture more, to make it yet more clear; compare John 17. 10. with John
16. 15. All (...). John 16. 15. (...). John 17. 10. Vide D. Glassium in Explic
orat. Christi. (...).
things that the Father has are mine. John 16. 15. Father, all mine are thine,
and thine are mine. John 17. 10. that is, Whatsoever does belong to the Father
as God, does belong to Christ; for we speak not of Personal, but Essential
properties, Christ does lay claim to all that is natural, to all that belongs
to the Father as God, not to any thing which belongs to him as the Father, as
the first Person of the blessed Trinity. In the 17 of John Christ proves that
the Apostles were his Apostles because they were his Fathers Apostles, and
given by the Father to him ver. 9. but he gives a more general reason for it
ver. 10. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine: It is a general rule
expressed in the Neuter gender, and therefore cannot be restrained to the
Apostles, as the Socinians would limit the speech of Christ; but it must be
taken in its full extent; but that I may give full weight and measure pressed
down and running over, consider that the other text John 16. 15. has a double
note of universality, and therefore is very Emphaticall for the proof of the
point, All things whatsoever thut the Father has (as God) are mine (...), etc.
Epiph. Contra Sabellium
, But the Father has an eternal Godhead, infinite power and Majesty; and
therefore says Christ, they are mine. Epiphanius disputing against the heresy
of Sabellius expounds this Rule thus, All that the Father has is mine; the
Father is God and I am God; the Father is Life and I am Life; for whatever the
Father has is mine. For the clearer demonstration of this truth, let us now
descend to particulars. 1 The Attributes of God. 2 The works of God. 3 The
worship of God, are all ascribed and given to Jesus Christ, that we may
confess and acknowledge him to be God, the true God, the mighty God, the self
same only God with the Father and the holy Spirit.

1 The Attributes of God are ascribed John. 1. 1. Divine Attributes are
ascribed to Christ. 1 Eternity.
In the beginning was the Word; [was] notes some former duration, and therefore
we conclude that he was before the beginning, before any Creation or Creature;
for it is said that he was God in the beginning, and his divine nature whereby
he works is Eternal. Heb. 9. 14. He is the First and Last, Revel. 1. 17. hence
it is that he is called the Firstborn of every Creature, because he who
created all, and upholds all, has power to command and dispose of all, Micah
5. 2. from the days of Eternity. John 17. 5.
as the Firstborn had power to command the family or kingdom, Coloss. 1. 15,
16, 17. Compare Isa. 44. 6. with Revel. 22. 13. and Prove. 8. 22, 23. and with
my margin.

2. Jesus Christ is omnipotent, 2 Omnipotence.
Phil. 3. 21. he is called by a Metonymy the Power of God, 1 Cor. 1. 24. He is
the Almighty, Revel. 1. 8. He made all things, John 1. 3. Coloss. 1. 16, 17.
Psalm. 102. 26. compared with Hebr. 1. 8. 10 John 1. 10. He upholds all things,
Heb. 1 3. Coloss 1. 17.

3. Jesus Christ is unchangeable, 3 Immutability.
Hebr. 1. 12. cited out of Psalm. 102. 26, 27.

4. Christ is Omniscient John 2. 25. 4 Omniscience.
He is the Searcher of hearts, Rev. 2. 23. He knows all things, John 21. 17. He
is the wisdom of the Father, 1 Cor. 1. 24. He does of himself know the
Father, Mat. 11. 27. and does according to his own Will reveal the secrets of
his Fathers bosom, and therefore is called The Word, all the treasures of
wisdom are in him, Colos. 2. 3.

5 The Immensity of God belongs to Christ; 5 Immensity.
for he is not contained in any Place, who was before there was any Place,
Prove. 8. 22.
and did create all Places by his own Power, Ioh. 1. 1. 3.
John 1. 1, 3. whilst he was on earth in respect of his bodily Presence, he was
in the bosom of the Father, which must be understood of his Divine Nature and
Person, Matthew. 18 20.
John 1. 18. He did come down from Heaven, and yet remained in Heaven, Matthew.
28. 20.
John 3. 13.

II. Christ does perform the Works of God, 3 Divine works.
such proper and peculiar, such divine and supernatural works as none but God
can perform; John 2. 19 21.
he did raise the dead by his own power at his own pleasure. John 5. 21, 28,
29. John 11. 25. He is called the resurrection and the life, because he is the
author of both: whatsoever the Father does, the Son does likewise. Horsum
profuit personae dignitas, ut irae infinitae onus sustineret, and sufficiens
(...) esset.
Ioh. 5. 17, 19. He wrought miracles, he has the same Nature and power with
the Father, and therefore does the same works: He does regenerate our Souls,
pardon our sins, save our souls; he has appeased the wrath, and satisfied the
justice of God, by his divine Mediation; he gives Temporal, Spiritual,
Eternal life. 2 Cor. 5. 17. John 6. 38. 40. Isa. 53. 4.


III. Divine Honor is due to Jesus Christ For, Act. 20 28.
1. All the glorious Angels are Heb. 9. 12. 14. 26.
Heb. 1. 6. 2. All true Christians are described by their calling on and
believing in the name of Christ, Divine Honor due to Christ.
Act. 9. 14. John 1. 12. 3. All are obliged to give the same honor to Christ,
Romans 10. 14. 1 Cor. 1, 2.
which they are required to give to God the Father, Joh. 14. 1.
Ioh. 5. 23. 4. Examples every way warrantable, Psalm. 2. 12.
because agreeable to these precepts, To. 10. 11.
are frequent in the Word, Act. 7. 59. 60. 1 Cor. 1. 2. Rev. 22. 20.

5. Baptism is administered in the name and to the honor of Christ, Mat. 28.
17. 18, 19, 20.

6. At the day of Judgment every knee must bow to him, and acknowledge him to
be equal to his Father, Isa. 45, 21, 22, 23, 24. 25. compared with Romans 14.
10, 11, 12. Phil. 2. 6, 9, 10, 11.

7. All that are justified do believe in him; and they who do believe in him
shall not be ashamed, Romans 3. 25, 26. 1 Pet. 2, 6, 7.

8. The Apostolical benediction so often repeated in the Epistles.

From whence I argue, since God will not give his glory to another, because he
is true, Isa. 48. 11. and cannot because he is just; it follows, that though
Christ be a distinct person, yet he is not a distinct God from his Father, but
one and the same God with him, God blessed for ever. Much more might be
produced upon this argument: That which has been said, is abundantly
sufficient, if God set it home upon our spirits by his own Spirit: but if men
will not be persuaded by these Scriptures, neither would they be persuaded
though one should rise from the dead. In the next place I am to demonstrate the
Divine Nature, Person, Titles, Attributes, Works, Worship of the Holy Ghost.

3. The same eternal Godhead does subsist in the Holy Ghost, who is God
blessed for ever. The Holy Ghost is a spiritual and infinite substance,
subsisting with peculiar properties, and acting according to the counsel of his
divine will. The Apostle having distinguished between the Spirit, (...). 1
Cor. 12. v. 4. 11. (...). Romans 8. 6.
and the gifts of the Spirit, shows that the Spirit it self, That one Spirisl,
That one and self-same Spirit, does work and distribute all those excellent
gifts according as he pleases, 1 Cor. 12. 4. Now, 1. these particularising and
indigitating terms, That one, that same Spirit. 2. The wi^^ of the Spirit. 3.
The discriminating energ^ or efficacy of the Spirit, do all demonstrat^ the
subsistence of the Spirit, and peculiarity (...) his Subsistence. When the
Spirit of truth (...) come, He will guide John 16. 13. he says no^ It, but He,
and therefore does not speak (...) an Attribute, but a Person, He etc. which is
the more to be observed, because the word in the original which signifies
Spirit^ is of the Neuter gender, and yet our Savior speaking of the Spirit,
says He, to point out the peculiar subsistence or person of the Spirit, When
He the Spirit of Truth, etc. John 16. 13. (...). Joh. 16. 13
and therefore we ought to take special notice of that expression; and all
those notes of particularity, 1 Cor. 12. applied to the Spirit, do show that he
is a particular, and undivided substance, one Spirit, the same Spirit, the self
same Spirit, one and the self same Spirit, 1 Cor. 12. form the 4. v. to the 12.
1. The Divine Nature and Person of the holy Ghost.
And that this spiritual particular undivided substance is a divine substance
is evident, because it is said that the same Spirit who does work all in all is
the same Lord, and the same God. 1 Cor. 12. 5, 6. and Lord in the new Testament
does answer to Jehovah in the old, 2. Divine Titles.
as has been proved above in this very Chapter: when Peter drew up a charge
against Ananias, he puts this question to him, Why has Satan filled thy heart
to lie to the holy Ghost? thou have not lied unto men, but unto God, Act. 5. 3,
4. The black and unpardonable sin is after a more special manner committed
against the Godhead subsisting in the Holy Ghost, and the peculiar office and
dispensation of the Holy Ghost, then against the Father or the Son; and that
sin is in some respects pronounced the most grievous sin, Mat. 12. 32. If the
Holy Ghost were only the Power of God, as Socinians love to dream, that sin
would not be so highly aggravated; for it is not the highest and foulest
aggravation of sin, to say it is committed against the Power of God. The
Father, Son and Spirit have but one Power, as they have one and the same
nature; and therefore the Father is said to work in the Son, and by the Spirit;
and hence it is that Christ is called the Power of God, Christus est Potentia
Dei (...). Spiritus Sanctus est potentia Dei (...) vide Gomarum Disp. de
Trinit. Tom. 3. Disp. 7. and 8.
1 Cor. 1. 24. and the Holy Ghost is called the Power of the most High, Luke 1.
35. because the Power of the Father, (who is called the most High in opposition
to the highest of creatures,) does reside in, is exercised and made manifest by
the Holy Ghost, and especially manifested in that Omnipotent Work of the
Conception of our Lord and Savior; the very shadow of the Holy Ghost makes a
Virgin to conceive; this miracle speaks him God.

The Holy Ghost is Jehovah, Divine Titles which prove the Nature and person of
the Spirit to be Divine.
the great God, and King above all Gods, as is evident by comparing, Psalm. 95.
3, 6, 7, 8, 9. with Heb. 3. 7, 9. The Spirit of Jehovah is the God of Israel, 2 Samuel 23. 2, 3. The People rebelled against Jehovah, and tempted him in the
Wilderness, Deuteronomy. 6. 16. Numb. 14. 26, 27. Deuteronomy. 9. 7, 24. now that is meant
of tempting and rebelling against the Holy Ghost, as well as against God the
Father and Jesus Christ, as is clear, if you compare Isa. 63. 10. Heb. 3. 7,
9. with the places alleged. The Holy Ghost is that Jehovah who made the New
Covenant with his chosen People, Number. 12. 6 Heb. 1. 1. 2 Pet. 1. 21. 1 Cor. 3.
16. 17. 1 Cor. 6. 19. compared together 1 Cor. 12. 5, 6.
Ierem. 31. 31. compared with Heb. 10. 15, 16. The Holy Ghost is that Jehovah
who spoke by Isaiah the Prophet; compare Isa. 6. 8, 9. with Acts 28. 25, 26. we
might argue in like manner, from Levit. 19. 2. etc. compared with Heb. 9. 7, 8.
and several other places, Number, 12. 6. Heb. 1. 1, 2 Pet. 1. 21. 1 Cor. 12. 5, 6.

The Omnipotence of the Spirit is clearly proved, 3. Divine Attributes. The
Omnipotence of the Spirit.
because he works all in all, according to the counsel of his Will, and
works miracles, which transcend not only the common course and order, but the
whole power of nature, 1 Cor. 12. 6, 9, 10, 11. such are the raising of the
dead, Romans 8. 11. the regeneration and sanctification of our souls, Tit. 3. 5.
1 Cor. 6. 11. and therefore he is called the Holy Ghost, 4. Divine works of the
Spirit.
because the Father and the Son do according to Divine dispensation sanctify us
by the operation of the Holy Ghost. Moreover the Holy Ghost did teach the
Prophets and Apostles, and lead them into all truth, he overshadowed the
Virgin, etc. John 16. 13. Acts 2. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 11. and 2 Pet 1. 21. The holy
Ghost is the great God and Creator of all things Psalm. 93. 3. 5. Heb. 3.

The Holy Ghost is Omniscient; The Omniscience of the Spirit. (...) Romans 9. 1.
1 Cor. 2. 10 11. Joh. 16. 13.
for he knows the deep things of God, and the secrets of men; he inspired the
Prophets and Apostles, and moved them to reveal the mysteries of faith and
godliness, 1 Cor. 2. 10. 11. and 1 Pet. 1. 11. 2 Pet. 1. 21. Romans 9. 1. Rev. 2.
23.

The Holy Ghost is Omnipresent, The Omnipresence of the Spirit.
he dwells in all Saints as in a Temple, he repaires, adornes, beautifies his
Temple, and acts in every single Saint, Romans 8 9. 2 Timothy 1. 14.
as the spirit of disobedience acts in Children of wrath: we cannot fly from
the presence of the spirit because he is Omnipresent, 1 Cor. 3. 16 Romans 8. 26
27.
Psalm. 139. 7.

By what has been already written, it is evident that the Holy Ghost has the
titles and attributes of God, 1 Cor. 12. ^^
he does perform works proper to God; 1 These 2. 13 Vide Basilium. lib. de
Spiritu Sancto.
and that devine Honor is due unto him, I shall clearly prove because it is
denied by the blasphemous wits of this discoursing age. Vide Nazianzen.


The Holy Ghost who spoke by Isaiah the Prophet, Orat. 37 and testimoniorum
exame^ de Deita^e Spiritus Sancti inventes.
is worshipped by the Angels of God, as is most evident by comparing Isa. 6. 3.
9. with Acts 28. 25. 26 The whole Church of God is exhorted to worship the Holy
Ghost as the Great God, Petrum Damianu^ lib. 3. Epi 1
as Jehovah, as our Make; to how down and kneel before him, that is, to give
him divine worship both inward and outward, because he is our God, as appears
by comparing, Psa. 95. 3. 6. 7. with Heb. 3. 7, 8. 9. The Apostle gives divine
Honor to the Holy Ghost when he appeals to him as to the searcher of hearts,
Romans 9. 1. and the Holy Ghost who speaks to the Churches, joins with the son
of God (who speaks to them also) in searching of the heart and reins, Revel.
2. 17. 18. 23. and all the Churches are commanded to hearken to both as unto
God blessed for ever. Our souls and bodies are said to be the Temples of God
because they are the Temples of the Holy Ghost; and therefore we are commanded
to worship and glorify the holy Ghost with our souls and bodies; for the spirit
does dwell in his Temple that he may be worshipped in his Temple. The Temple is
a profane place, if there be no worship there; and it is, must be, pure, holy
and spiritual worship, and sacrifice, such as the holy spirit delights in;
else the Temple will be defiled, destroyed. Compare, 1 Cor. 3. 15. 16, 17. 1
Cor. 6, 19, 20. 2 Cor. 6. 16. 18. and 2 Cor. 7. 1. The Church is blessed in the
name of the Holy Ghost as in the name of God, 1 Cor. 6. 19, 20.
and the communion of the holy spirit is spiritual and saving as well as the
special grace of Christ, Romans 12. 1. 2.
and love of the Father, 1 Pe^. 2. 5.
as appears by that solemn Apostolical benediction, 1 Cor. 3. 16, 17.
2 Cor. 13. 14. and the beloved Disciple proclames the spirit to be the
fountain of grace and peace as well as the Father of Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 2. 18.
22.
and therefore does beg grace and peace of the Spirit of grace (who does purify
and pacify our hearts) for all the Churches, Revel. 1. 4. The holy Ghost does
regulate all Churches and Church-affaires. Acts 13. 2. 4 Acts 15. 28. Acts 20
28. Baptism is administered in the name and for the Honor of the holy Ghost.
Matthew. 8 19 The holy Ghost does bestow upon us, and work in us those spiritual
and glorious blessings which are sealed in or conveyed by Baptism, and
therefore we are more especially Baptized by the holy Ghost. Matthew. 3. 11. John
3. ^. 6, for we are born of the spirit, regenerated, washed, renewed by the
spirit, who purifies the soul as water does the body, Titus 3. 5, 6.

The violation of the Honor and worship of the Holy Ghost is most severely
punished, Vide Aug. cont. Maximinum.
Mark 3. 29. Hebr. 6. 4 Hebr. 1^. 28. 29. and therefore there is special care
taken in the holy Scriptures both for the preservation and vindication of the
honor of the Holy Ghost; Acts 7 51. Isai 63. 10. Ephe. 4 30 Heb 3 7, 8 Galath.
5. 18. 25. Rom 8. 12 13. 14. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 19.
we must not grieve, vex, resist quench the Holy Ghost, that is, we must not
displease him, we must not disobey him, we must obey his dictates, his motions,
we must be quickened, taught, led, ruled, governed by him: we must attribute
all the glorious Titles to the Holy Ghost given him in Scripture, of which we
have so largely discoursed; we must acknowledge him to be the Spirit of Truth,
and therefore must believe in him; the spirit of supplication, the spirit of
grace and holiness, and therefore love him and pray to him: we must either
renounce our Baptism in his Name, 1 Cor. 12. 13. Matthew. 3. 11. John 3 5.
or else we must confess that we are obliged to believe in him, reverence,
love, obey, glorify him with all inward and outward worship: for we are
debtours to the Spirit* to live to the Spirit, and glorify the Spirit of
regeneration who works in us the instrument of Justification, that there may be
an effectual application of Christ to our souls; though Christ make the
purchase, the Spirit of adoption makes the assurance, he seals us up to the day
of redemption, and therefore good reason have we to offer up our souls and
bodies in a spiritual sacrifice to him; for these temples were made for
sacrifice; Romans 12. 1, 2. 1 Pet. 2. 5, Now if God who will not give his glory
to another, because he is true and just, gives all this glory to the Holy
Ghost, it concerns us to glorify him.

If there were not all this and a great deal more to be said for the honor of
the Holy Ghost, yet it were an invincible argument to me if I could only say
that the Holy Ghost is God, and therefore to be worshipped as God with Divine
worship; The Holy Ghost is one with the Father and the Son, one God, and
therefore all three are to be worshipped with the same Divine worship. It were
enough for such men as have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy
Ghost, or no, Acts 19. 2. to talk as the filthy dreamers and blasphemous
Heretics of this rotten age usually do, who belch out the language of Hell
against the Spirit of Grace; and I cannot but wonder that subtle Jesuits,
Arminians and Socinians who pretend to study and search the Scriptures, should
say that there is nothing to be found in Scripture concerning the worshipping
of the Holy Ghost.

That the Spirit acts according to the Counsel of his Divine will, has been
sufficiently proved; only it must be considered that as Father, Son and Spirit
have but one Nature, so they have but one Will.

Concerning the Peculiar and Personal properties of the Holy Ghost, I shall
treat when I come to speak of the distinction of these subsistences.

For conclusion of this chapter I am to prove that the Godhead does subsist in
Father, Son, and Spirit, all three without any multiplication of the Godhead.

The Father and the Son are but one God, John. 10. 30. The unity of the Godhead.
I and my Father are one. The Father Deus unus, t^ inu^us, solus, unicus,
simplicissime unus, unicissime unicus. The Father Son and Holy Spirit all three
are but one only God. 1 John 5. 7 John 10. 30 Unitatem essentiae contra
Arianos, Trinitatem personarum contra Sabellianos tuemur. Tres substantias esse
dixerunt, Subsistentium personas per Substantias edocentes, non Substantiam
Patris et Filije^ Spiritus Sancti diversitate dissimilis essentiae separantes
ex c^n^il. Anti^chen. Hilar. de Synodo adversus Arianos.
, Son and Spirit, all three are but one God. 1 John 5. 7. There is but one God.
Ephesians. 4. 6. Deuteronomy. 6. 4. Isa. 44. 6. 8. Isa. 45. 21. 22. Nay there can be but
one God; there can be but one most Perfect being, one infinite Perfection; the
most perfect being is the most single being, and therefore Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost are all three but one only God; they are Consubstantiall, Coequall,
Coeternall, they have one Nature, Mind, Will, Power, Godhead: Some b of the
Ancients who meant well, said there were three Substances, but they meant three
Subsistences or Persons, as Hilary expounds them; for, says he, They did not
intend to assert three different essences.

Hence it is, that such as were more wary in their expressions, did use the
word Subsistence, and said that there were three subsistences, but one
substance or essence in this divine Trinunity. This is the first of all the
Commandments, to acknowledge one only God, Mark 12. 29. As there is but one
Mediator to intercede, so there is but one God to justify, and intercede unto
for justification. 1 Timothy 2. 5. Rom 3. 30. Gal. 3. 20. It is one and the same
God who commands heaven and earth, Deuteronomy. 4. 35 39. Isa. 37. 16. The gods of the
heathens were false gods, dunghill-gods, or devill-gods: Magistrates are but
mortal gods; they must die, and rise to judgment, and hold up their hand at
the tribunal of Jehovah, Psalm. 86. 8, 9. 10. Psalm. 82 6, 7. 1 Cor. 8. 6. I
prove this point at large, because I perceive by Mr. Fry his sad account, we
are much misconstrued in this weighty point, as if by acknowledging three
distinct subsistences, we did create two new Gods, and affirmed Jesus Christ
and the Holy Ghost to be two distinct Gods both from the Father and from one
another. But we are no We do not only acknowledge a Trinity, but a Trinunity in
opposition to the error of the Tritheites. Vnum and Trinum de monstrant
trinunum Deum simplicissime unicum. 1 I^h. 5. 7. Hi tres sunt unus ille Deus,
trinunus Deus, Infinitum, hoc est, sum and absolute perfectum, non potest
esse nisi unum. Si ^nus potest emnia, quid opus est pluribus diis? omnia autem
potest Deus trinunus. Deus est trinunus, est unus absolute, trinus relate; unus
quoad essentiam, trinus quoad subsistentiam.
Tritheites: We acknowledge a Trinunity, as well as a Trinity in opposition to
the error of the Tritheites; we believe the Unity of the Godhead; and I never
read of the Trinity of the Godhead in English, until I read it in the Title of
Mr. See Mr. Fry his Answer to the Charge of Blasphemy and Error etc. p. 20* 22.
Fry his Opinion, which he delivered to the House, and has since printed and
published to the world.

Deus ita est unus, ut etiam ^it solus, and ita solus ut non possit esse alius.
En naturam infinitam summe^ unam, and unicissime unica^.
We do believe that God is one, most singly and singularly one, and an only one:
The unity of the Godhead is not a generical, or a specifical unity, but a most
singular unity, which I need not call a Deus non tam unus numero dicendus est,
quam unicus. Pater and filius sunt unum potius, quam unus. Ioh. 10. 30. Sunt
inquies unus Deus, imo potius sunt idem unicusque Deus.
numerical unity, as some do; I had rather call it the most single singular and
perfect unity, as some profound Divines do, who have told me what I have read
in others, that I had need be very curious in the delivery of this weighty
point. All the three Persons have one and the same single and infinite Godhead,
and therefore must needs mutually subsist in one another, because they are all
three one and the same infinite God. Three consubstantial, coessential,
coeternal, coequal Persons, are distinguished, but not divided, are united,
Personae coessentiiales and in se m^tuo subsistentes inconfuse uniuntur, and
indivise discernuntur.
but not confounded; united in their (...).
one nature, not confounded in their distinct subsistences; nay though their
subsistence is in one another, yet their subsistences are distinct, but their
nature most Natura divina est singularissima, and simplicissime uni^a.
singularly the same; nay the divine nature is as Non minus individuum est
essentia divina quam persona. D. Al^ing. Problem.
singular as any one of the single subsistences, and yet whatever is proper to
the Divine nature is Natura divina est simplicissime singularis, and tamen
communis Patri, Filio and Spiritui Sancto. Nec mirum, cum ^it simplicissime and
perfectissime infinita.
common to all three of these Divine subsistences; and the Divine nature does
not subsist out of these three Divine subsistences.

But the more we deliver concerning the unity of the Godhead, the more
advantage do the Socinians hope to gain for the justifying of their blasphemous
dreams: for ^f this unity of the Godhead be not only ^otionall but real, and
God is most singly and singularly one, and an only one, as has been proved;
why then say they, We will be bold to urge an invincible argument to prove that
God the Father alone is God, and therefore neither Jesus Christ nor the Holy
Ghost is truly and properly God by nature. God the Father alone is the only
true God; but neither the Son nor the Holy Ghost is God the Father. Ergo,
neither the Son nor the Holy Ghost is the only true God. For the proof of this
Proposition, That the Father alone is the only true God, they cite some of
those places which I have alleged to prove the unity of the Godhead; 1 Cor.
8. 5, 6.
but they lay most weight upon John 17. 3. 1 Timothy 2. 5 Ephesians. 4 6.
Behold, say they, a plain acknowledgment from the mouth of Christus ipse dicit
patrem suum esse illum unum solum verum Deum eti^m respectu sui. Seipsum namque
ibidem nominat atque a Patre distinguit. So^inu^ in tract. de Deo, Christo, and
Spiritu Sancto. Catechis. Racoviens. cap 1. p. 37. Socin. libro quod Evangelici
etc.
Jesus Christ: Joh. 17. 13.
Christ does acknowledge his Father to be the only true God, and therefore
does exclude both himself and the Holy Ghost; for there is but one only God,
and God the Father alone is that only true God.

These subtle Heretics are guilty of a pitiful piece of Sophistry in the
drawing up of this argument, which is more full of blasphemy then wit: for
observe,

1. Our Savior does not say, John 17. 3. opened at large.
[That we may know En structuram Grammaticam [ut cognoscant Te illum solu^
verum Deum] non autem [ut cognoscant solu^ Te, illum veru^ Deum.]
Thee only to be the true God] but [That we may know Thee the only true God:]
For as Athanasius said well, We must know Jesus Christ to be the only true God
also; because Christ, and so the Holy Ghost also, is En structuram logicam,
particula exclusiva Solum non cohaeret cum subjecto, sed cum praedicato, pater
est ille Deus, qu^ solus verus Deus est.
one and the same God with the Father; all three Persons are the only true God;
for though they Distinctionem personalem concedimus, essentialem negamus. Hi
qui tres sunt personaliter, sunt unum essentialiter.
differ in subsistence, they do not differ in nature, they have all of them one
and the same singular Godhead, the self-same divine nature; the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, are but one and the same infinite Spirit, one Jehovah, one God, who
is the only true God, God blessed for ever.

Now it does not follow that the Father, Son and Spirit do differ Essentially,
because they differ personally: for these three are ^ne, 1 John. 5. 7. One God,
who is the only ^rue God. The Non enim sensus est, solus verus Pater est Deus,
sed Pater est sol^s ve^us Deus praeter quem non est alius Deus.
Father is the only true God; behold, the praedicate in that proposition is
not personal, but essential, and ^very Essential Predicate belongs to all
and ^very one of the three persons, because they have one and the same Divine
Essence, and therefore the Apo^^le says these three are ^ne. 2. Observe how
the 17. of John and ^. verse is expounded by John himself, Deus est unus et
trinus, sed nonsecundum idem, est unus essentiali^er Trinus Personaliter;
contradictoria enim non affirm^ntur de eodem, si ei tribuantur secundum idem.
In essentia Divina est alius et alius, non aliud et aliud, alius enim est
Pater, alius Filius, alius Spiritus Sanctus, hi tres autem sunt potius Vnum,
quam V^us. 1 I^han. 5 7. Unus vero Deus, non alius Pater est; alius non
Essentialiter, sed Personaliter. vide Augustinum de side ad Petrum cap. 1. et
de haeresibus. cap. 41. vide D. Solomon, Glassium in orat. Christ. (...) Johan.
17.
^ John 5. 20. And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an
understanding that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is
true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and Eternal life. Now
add, John 17. This is life eternal to know thee the only true God, etc. and
then put all together thus, This is life Eternal that they might know thee the
onley true God and Jesus Christ whom thou have ^sent. [The only true God] for
as John himself expounds This Jesus Christ is the true God and Eternal life. 1
John 5. 20.

3 Observe that John himself expound^ this also of the Spiritus Sanctus est
(...) non relate qua persona procedens, sed absolute qua Deus est per Essentiam
perfectissimam a se ipsa existentem; est enim Spiritus Elohim patri filioque
coessentialis et coaequalis. Genesis 1. 2.
Holy Ghost; for, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one only God, 1 Ioh. 5. 7.
These three are one; and therefore i^ does not at all follow that the Son and
Spirit are not the true God, because the Father is the only God; for they are
all three one and the same God, who is the only God, the only true God.

4. Observe that I do not (as some learned men do) only affirm that the word
[onely] is put there to Particula exclusiva [Solum] (...) non reliquarum
Trinitatis personarum sed fictitiorum numinum usurpatur, ita ut excludat ea
tantum quae extra naturam divinam sunt, et a Patre res essentia diversae sunt;
eadem autem natura divina est in Patre, Filio et Spiritu Sancto.
exclude false gods, but I say it does also deny Jesus Christ, and the Holy
Ghost to be different Gods, other gods from God the Father, because they are
one and the same God with the Father, as is evident in those two places 1 John
5. 7. 20. cited before.

Those learned men do well to exclude false gods, the Socinians do ill to
exclude the Son and Spirit who are the same God with the Father; [onely] does
exclude every false god; but the Son and Spirit, are (as the Father is) the
only true God, blessed for ever.

The term [onely] does not exclude any Divine person, but it does exclude all
and every one of the creatures; Vt cognoscant Te, qui es ille Deus, qui solus
verus est, quoniam illa est sola Deitas vera, quae est in Patre, and si^ non
excluditur Filius, qui est in Patre unus idem que Deus cum Patre and Spiritu
Sancto. Ioh. 1. 1. 1 Io. 5, 7.
because every Divine person has the same Divine nature, but no creature is
capable of the Divine nature, unless we do understand it as 2 Pet. 1. 4. is to
be understood, of the image of God, or having such an interest in the Divine
Attributes, that God will exercise and put forth his wisdom, power, and all,
for their everlasting good, and be himself their all sufficient reward,
portion, and objective happiness. And it is to be observed that the terms
Only and True, are both applied to the same part of the Proposition, namely to
the Praedicate alone.

5. This is life eternal, to know thee: But the Text says, This is life
eternal to know Jesus Christ also; that is, this is the way and means for the
obtaining of eternal life, and this is the Vita aeterna hi^ inchoati^^ habetur
cognoscendo Deum per fidem, habetur autem in coelis perfect cognoscendo Deum
per visionem. Verba de (...) vitae intelligenda. vid. Cyril. lib. 2. in Johan.
Hilar* lib. 9. de Tr^n. and lib. 5. contra Julian. Ambr^s. lib. 5. de fide.
beginning of eternal life, to know, believe, love and obey Jesus Christ. But
eternal life is perfected by knowing of God in heaven, not by faith but by
sight. Now Vita aeterna est solummodo in vero and aeterno Deo, in summo bono,
uti Ambrosius cont. Arianos.
eternal life does not consist in the knowledge, belief, or love of any mere
creature; and therefore the Godhead of Jesus Christ is proved out of this very
Text, which they urge (who deny his Godhead) to justify their blasphemy in the
denial of it.

6. Eternal life does consist in knowing of Jesus Christ, whom God has sent
to be our Mediator; and this eternal life will be perfected in heaven, when
the mediation of Christ will have an end: and therefore it is the knowing of
and believing in this Mediator as God satisfying for us, which makes us happy;
for he does perfect the work of Mediator as God by his eternal Spirit, that
is his divine nature, Heb. 9. 14. and by the blood of God, Act. 20. 28. By the
sufferings of the Lord of glory, 1 Cor. 2. 8. for he obtained eternal
redemption for us by virtue of his eternal spirit, Heb. 9. 12. 14.

7. To know Jesus, that is, to know him as a Savior, as one that saves us from
our sins, is to know him as a God, as one God with his Father, as the true God
and the only God; according to that which we read Isa. 43. 10, 11, 12, 25. that
ye may know and believe and understand that I am he; Isa. 43. 10, 11, 25.
compared with Heb. 1, 2, 3. 1 John 1. 7. Act. 4. 12.
I even I am O Jehovah justitia nostra. Jer. 23. 6. Ps. 68. 18, 19, 20.
compared with Ephesians. 4. 8. Isa. 8. 14, 16. compared with Rom 9. 30, 33.
Jehovah, and beside me there is no Savior. And Isa. 45. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.
There is no God else beside me. A just God and a Savior, there is none beside
me. Look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and
there is none else. -- to me every knee shall bow. -- in Jehovah have I
righteousness. -- In Jehovah shall the seed of Israel be justified. Compare
this with Romans 14. 10, 11 and the Socinians may as safely conclude that the^e
is no other God but Jesus Christ, as they man conclude that there is no God but
God the Father, from the 17. of John. But they and we ought to conclude from
these and the other Scriptures mentioned before, that Secundu^ Philosophum
lolus. them est quod non cum alio, and ideo tantummodo ^xcludit (...) quod
a^etatem d^cit; Filius auten^ non est alius a P^re nessentia, sed tantu^ in
p^^sona. Lyra us in lo^^m.
Jesus Christ is not a different God from his Father, but is one and the same
God with him. These exclusive and restrictive Terms [One, and Alone, etc.] do
not then exclude any of those three who are one in nature and essence, though
they differ in their manner of subsistence: for I cannot conclude from that
^ext, 1 Cor. 8. 6. To us there is but one God, the Father, etc. that the Father
only is God; no more then I can conclude from the words following in the very
sam^ verse [and one Lord Jesus Christ] that Christ only is Lord, and so exclude
the Father from Lordship as the Socimans would exclude the Son from the
Godhead. 1 Timothy 6. 14, 15, 16. is urged by some to prove, that Jesus Christ only
has immortality: but they dare not conclude from thence, Vide Aug. Traect.
105. in ohan. Athanas. d^sp^t. co^^a Artum in Council. Nicen. Nazianz. orat. 36.
Ambros. lib 5 de fide. Basil. lib. 4. cont. Eunomium. Cyp^ian ^. 2. advers.
Iudaen sad Quriaum.
that God the Father is not immortal. I read Mat 23. 10. One is your Master,
even Christ: but I must not conclude that the Father is not our Master; for the
Father teaches, Ioh. 6. 45. and the Holy Ghost was Doctor, Master, Teacher even
to the Apostles themselves, Ioh. 14. 26. Ioh 16. 13.

If that Text 1 Timothy 6. 15, 16. be meant, as some conceive it is, of God the
Father; yet I find the same Titles given to Jesus Christ, Rev. 19. 16. and
therefore I conclude, That both are one and the same immortal God and King, 1
^im. 1. 12, 16, 17. 1 John 5. 20.

I read, 1 Cor. 12. 4. That the same God works all in all. and v. 11. that
one and the self same Spirit works all: but I dare not conclude from thence,
that the Spirit only is God, and that the Father and the Son work nothing at
all.

From these and many other such like expressions, we may safely conclude -- 1.
That these terms [one, and only] are not always universally exclusive in the
Scripture sense, if all circumstances be duly considered and the Scriptures
rightly compared, 1 Cor. 9. 6. I only and Barnabas; The word [only] does not
exclude Barnabas, but include him; Barnabas was joined with Paul; but Jesus
Christ is more nearly joined with the Father. Vide D. Glassium in cap. 17.
Johan.
Ioh 8. 9. Jesus was left alone; but the woman was with him, all that were for
her condemnation are excluded. 1 King. 12. 20. There are two exclusive terms;
[There was none followed the house of David but the Tribe of Judah only] and
yet the Tribe of Benjamin adhered to David, as you may read in the next verse
But surely the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are more closely united then the
Tribe of Judah was with the Tribe of Benjamin. Deuteronomy. 1. 36. None should see the
good Land save Caleb, but Iosuah is joined with him v. 38. and therefore he was
not excluded. You see here is some union or conjunction still between the
persons that are included; but there is the highest union, nay, unity between
the Father, Son, and Spirit, because these three are one in nature, and that
nature most simply single, and singularly one.

2. When the term Only, or any the like term is applied to the Divine nature,
or to any Divine vid. Aug. de Prae l^st. ^^nct. cap 8. Q^icquid est ess^ntiae
divine and d^nomin^^ionis ab^ a, non ^nus de Filio and ^piritu Sancto, quam de

, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost being one in nature, cannot be divided or
separated by that exclusive term, though there is a personal difference
between them, and a special order and dispensation to be observed amongst
them, as we shall hereafter prove. But the intent of the Holy Ghost is to
exclude all that are not Gods by nature, as the Apostle speaks, Gal. 4. 8. from
the Godhead, and from laying any claim to the natural Attributes of God, or
pretending to do any work that is proper and peculiar to God. The true and
living God is opposed to Idols, 1 These. 1, 9. But Jesus Christ and the Holy
Ghost are to be acknowledged and served as one^ rue and living God with the
Father. The living God, the God of truth, and King of eternity, is opposed to
those counterfeit Gods, Jer 10, 11, 12. And therefore when the Apostle says
There is no other God but one, 1 Cor. 8 4. He tells you whom he does exclude,
such as are but conceited gods, so called and so reputed, equivocal gods, v. 5,
6. The Lord Jesus and the Holy Ghost are God by nature, the same God with the
Father, and therefore they are not excluded. In like manner, when it is said
that Jehovah alone did lead the people in the wilderness, and cond^ct them
unto Canaan, that exclusive particle is put to exclude strange gods, such as
were then idolized, but were indeed no Gods, as is most evident, Deuteronomy. 32. 12.
So Jehovah alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him: but these
strange gods who are here excluded, were no gods, as is clear by comparing the
16. and 21. verses of the same Chapter.

I have already proved that the title of Jehovah is given both to Christ and
the Holy Spirit, and therefore when it is said, Jehovah alone did lead them in
the wilderness, the Son and Spirit are not excluded; for the Spirit did
instruct and guide them in the wildernese, Nehem. 9. 20. and the Spirit did
instruct their teachers also; but they rebelled against the Spirit Isa. 63. 10.
And Jesus Christ the Angel of Gods presence was present with them to guide them

therefore by the same reason the Father is the onley true God and the Son and
Spirit are the very same only true God also. When our Savior presses that
Text Mat. 4. 10. Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou
serve; he does not exclude himself, or the Holy Ghost; for both are to be
worshipped with divine worship, as has been already proved at large in this
very Chapter. Isa. 37. 16. Christus est deus in Propitiatorio super Cherubim

Jer. 23. 6. Romans 14. 10, 11, 12. John 20. 28.
Many other proofs might be produced from other Scriptures, and diverse other
arguments colle^ed from the 17. of John, to prove that Jesus Christ is not
excluded from being the same only God with his Father. To know Christ who is
God, and anointed of God, Heb. 1 8, 9 Psalm. 45. To know Christ whom thou have
sent; E^go he was a divine Person before he was sent to take the humane nature,
and he had eternal glory with his Father before the world was, John 17. 5. Na^
his calling of God Father, makes him equal with God; nay, he is not only
equal to, but one with his Father, Ioh. 5. 18. Ioh 10. 30. Moreover, if the
Father have not a divine and eternal Son how is he a divine and eternal Father?
Finally, if the Father Son, and Holy Ghost are not all three the same true God,
there is no God, for these three are one, and therefore all three are one God,
or else there is no God at all: from whence it will follow, that if we will be
Socinians, we must be Atheists. The Son and Spirit have the same nature with
the Father; and therefore if his nature be divine, so is theirs.

CHAP. V.
The Manner of GOD'S Being or Subsisting in the Father, Son and H. Ghost, is
the best manner of Being that is or can be, and the single Godhead is thereby
thrice illustrious throughout the wo^ld.
HItherto we have contended for the truth of this Divine Being or Subsisting:
2. The Excellency of God the Father.
Now ^e shall demonstrate the excellency thereof. God is made known to us as the
everlasting Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and is to be adored and En cultum
proprie Evangelicum, concord^, Deum ac Patrem Domini nostri Jesu Christi
concorditer colimus, uno ore uti Christianos decet glorificamus.
worshipped as the Father of our Lord Jesus, Romans 15. 6. Ephesians. 1. 3. 2 Cor. 1.
3 If God had been the Father of men and Father of Angels only, and not the
Father of our Lord Jesus, he would not have been so exceeding glorious as now
he is: for Angles have but a sinite excellency; but when he begets a Son equal
to himself, without any change in himself; and the begetting of this glorious
Person, is as eternal as the divine nature it self; This mystery is exceeding
glorious and admirable, and like the Godhead incomprehensible. Moreover, the
Lord Jesus Christ his own Son, 2 The Excellency of God the Son.
Romans 8. 32. and his only Son begotten by eternal generation, Ioh. 1. 14. being
the En Patris Hypostasin in filio refulgentem: En Filii Hypostasin eum a Patre
distinguentem.
illustrious brightness of the Fathers glory, and the express character of
his subsistence, is so exceeding glorious, that the most glorious Angels above
are commanded to adore and worship him, Heb. 1. 3, 4, 5, 6. For to which of the
Angels said God at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?
And therefore when he brings his first-begotten, and his only begotten Son into
the world, he says, And let all the Angels of God worship him. Behold how the
Godhead shines gloriously not only in one single Person, but in Father and Son
both, by this manner of subsistence; that every tongue may confess Jesus
Christ to be God and Lord, to the glory of God the Father. And therefore the
Father is not lessened or robbed of his glory, by the glory of his coequal Son,
Phil. 2. 6. 11. but there is a pious acknowledgment made of this glorious
mystery, which does very much redound to the glory of God the Father. For by
this means God the Father is acknowledged to be the First personal Principle
subsisting of himself, and by himself; for he received not his subsistence from
any other, and he gives subsistence unto two glorious Persons equal with
himself. The Socinians seem to be very zealous for the glory of God the Father;
and therefore they deny the Godhead of Christ and the Hol^ Spirit, to the glory
of God the Father, as they pretend: but the Scripture teaches us the contrary,
namely to confess the Godhead of Christ and the Holy Spirit to the glory of
God the Father For it does exceedingly redound to the glory of the Father, that
he gives subsistence unto two glorious Persons who are equal to himself, and
yet receives no subsistence from them, or any other. For as the Father has
life in himself, so has he given to the Son to have life in himself, Joh 5,
26. There is a subsisting life given to the Son by an eternal generation; and
the Vitam d^d^t Pater Filio ver* subsist^ntem non Alicnat. one, sed
Communicatione.
Father has life in himself, and self-subsistence also. And yet on the other
side, it is no dishonor to the Son to be begotten of the Father, and to
receive subsisting life from the Father; John 5. 21.
for the Son has life in himself also, John 5 18.
and being God of himself, Joh. 10. 30.
quickens whom he will by his divine power even as the Father does; for he has
the very same power and will which the Father has, because they have both one
and the same divine nature; John 1. 33. 34.
and therefore the Jews did conclude a^ight, when they said, that our Lord
Jesus made himself equal with God by saying he was the Son of God, Ioh 5. 18.
It is no dishonor to Jesus Christ to Qui accipit vita^ subsistentem, accipit
vitam independentem: dare vitam non arguit ullam causalitatem, accipere vitam
non arguit ullam dependent an^; and pr^inde in Deo non ^^noris perfectionis est
esse Filium, quam esse Patrem. Pater enim necessitate naturali generat filium,
filius eandem naturam ^abet cum Pat^e non ex gratia vel indolgentia Patris; non
est enim precatio Deus; atura divina in filio est incausata, independens, and
per (...) eadem natura divina quae est in Pa^re; ipsa etiam subsistentia quam
accipit filius est sibi naturaliter de bita.
receive subsisting life in such a glorious way from the ^ather, as that he is
equal with the Father, nay one with the Father, and therefore is to be
worshipped with one and the same worship with the Father, with divine and
spiritual worship, inward and outward worship the worship of our bodies and
souls, of our whole man. For all men are bound to honor the Son, as they
honor the Father, Joh. 5. 23. And let all Socinians take special notice of
what follows: He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father which
has sent him; Joh. 5. 23. ^et them not then pretend, that they dishonor the
Son (by denying his Godhead) to the glory of God the Father; for the Father
will maintain and vindicate the honor of his first-begotten, and only begotten
Son. And let them diligently consider that Text in the 2. Epist. of John. 2
Epist. Joh. ver. 9.
Whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not
God; he who abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the
Son. It is for the honor of our great Ruler Jesus Christ, that he was begotten
from the days of Eternity, Mic. 5. 2.

Finally, III. The Excellency of God the Holy Ghost. Deus est Personaliter
spiritus Sanctus.
it does much redound to the glory of the Father and the Son, that both do
concur to give Subsisting life to the Coequal Spirit by Eternal Spiration. The
Father and Son do both breathe forth this glorious Spirit. The Spirit of
Elohim, of both Persons, Genesis 1, 2. The Spirit that proceeds from the Father,
Ioh. 15. 26. is sent by Christ from the Father, and the Spirit is given by
Christ. Temporalis operationis Sigillum, aeternae spirationis fignum, Johan 20.
22.
Christ breathed upon the Apostles, when he gave the Holy Ghost to them, to
show that the Spirit was breathed forth by himself as well as from the Father,
Ioh. 20. 22. And he is often called the Spirit of the Son. The Holy Ghost does
receive of that which is Christ's, as well as the Fathers, Ioh. 16. 14, 15. and
Christ is glorified by the Spirit, Ioh. 16. 14. as the Father is glorified by
Christ. For Christ receives from the Father, and the Spirit from Christ, what
they both reveal to the Church of Christ. Nor is it any dishonor to the
Spirit to proceed from the Father and the Son in such a glorious way as to be
equal with them, nay one with them 1 Ioh. 5. 7. For all the Churches of Christ
are obliged by the first Sacrament of Christianity, to honor the Holy Ghost
with their bodies and souls, which are his Si ex lignis and lapidibus templum
Spiritui facete juberemur, quia cultus hic so^^ Deo debetur, clarum esset
divinitatis ejus argumentum* nunc ergo quanto clarius istad est, quod non
Templum illi facere sed nos ipsi esse debemus? Augustine. ad Maximin. Epist. 66.
holy temple as they honor the Father and the Son. The Spirit of ^ehovah is
the God of Israel. 2 Samuel 23. 2, 3. Subtracta subsistentia Spir^tus S^ncti De^s
^esincret esse Personal^ter Spiritus Sanctus; and proinde ista s^b^actio est
impossibilis, imo ipsa etiam supposi^io su^ilis, quia tanta est tam essentiae
divinae quam personarum perfectio ut nec pauciores nec plures esse possint.
The Holy Ghost, as he is one God with the Father and the Son, has an infinite
essence, which does exist of it self* though as he is the third Person, he has
not subsistence from himself, but by Emanation, Procession, Spiration from the
Father and the Son; and yet both concur to build a Temple to the Holy Spirit
that he may be worshipped as God. These three, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, do
take mutual delight, content, and satisfaction in one another; The distinction
between them is not Tres personae divinae non disti^guuntur secundum esse
Absolutum, sed per proprietates Relativas d^gno^^untur; and proinde distinctio
est tantum Respectiva, and Modalis.
Absolute, but Relative only they do mutually subsist in one another, and all
of them subsist in the same glorious Godhead, which Godhead dwells equally in
its fullness in all three, and is as truly the nature of the Holy Ghost, as it
is the nature of the Father and the Son. And this Divine nature is infinite,
not Deus immensu est non voluntatis liberate sed naturae necessitate; essentia
divina est tota intra omnia, tota extra omnia, nusquam inclusa, nusquam

in the Word and the joint concurrence of all three in every work that is
properly Divine, the Godhead is made thrice (...), Naz. orat^ de Bapt. 4.
illustrious thorowout the world, and yet the Godhead remains singly and
singularly one in all three Subsistences.

Finally the (...).
Natural and Infinite perfection of the Godhead requires this wonderful
Communication of Subsistence by the Father as the First Personal principle to
the Son, and by the ^ather and the Son to the Holy Ghost. For it is most
certain that God is not capable of any other being, or any other manner of being
or subsisting then what he has, for he has the Quiquid De natural est
perfectissimu^ est; aeque necessariu^ est esse tres personas Deitatis, quam
est, essentiam divinam esse unica^, and proinde aeque perfectum est unum atque
alterum, quia utru^que natural and proinde substantiale; ipse etiam respectus
inter personas divinasest substantialis, naturalis, mutuus, simultaneus,
necessarius, aeternus, in singulis autem singularis.
best being that is, nay the best that Can be, because the being of God and the
manner of being or subsisting of the Godhead in these three, Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, is infinitely perfect, and there can be no better being, or manner
of being or subsisting then that which is perfect, infinite, and infinitely
perfect. The Father did not Arbitrarily beget his Son, nor did the Father and
the Son Arbitrarily concur in breathing forth the Holy Ghost, but the
Natural and infinite perfection of the Godhead did require this wonderful
communication of it self, because such is the Natural perfection of the Divine
Nature or Godhead, that it could not be fully communicated, unless subsistence
were communicated by the Father to the Son, and by both to the Spirit for their
mutual, Eternal, Infinite satisfaction and delight; and therefore the Father
did not beget his Son, nor did the Father and Son breath forth the Spirit
Arbitrarily, but Naturally and Necessarily, though Voluntarily for the Eternal
satisfa^^ion of all three Susistences, that the whole Godhead might be in every
one of these three according to its infinite Divina essentia ad suam summam
perfectionem sine personisesse ne quit, nec personar^ una sine altera obintimam
relatione^. Bisterfell contra Crellium lib. 2. Sect. 1. cap. 4.

another, mutually possess, love and glorify one another from everlasting to

of the Persons, the third as well as the first, being God by Qui natura Deus
est, verus Deus est: qui verus Deus est, natura Deus est.
Nature, Gal 4. 8. and not by the mere favor of any one or more of the
Coessentiall persons. And therefore both the generation of the Son and
breathing forth of the Spirit must needs be Q^icquid Deo natural est aeternum

Eternal, because both are Natural: for whatsoever is Natural unto God must
needs be Eternal: but because the Father is the first Omnia a Patre tanquam

by the Son, John 5. 19. in regard of the Fathers Self subsistence, his order of
subsisting, and his communicating f subsistence to the Son and Holy Ghost,
though all things in the world are wrought by the Spirit also as has been
shown: And hence it is that the Name of God is most John 1. 1. John 17 3. Romans

look upon the Son, admire and bless the Father, look upon the Father and

know, believe and obey all three coequal persons, subsisting in the same most
single Godhead, and have access to the Father through the Son, and by the
Spirit with reverence and confidence, zeal and love.

CHAP. VI.
The Divine Subsistence being the most excellent Subsistence that is or can be,
the word Subsistence or Person cannot be attributed after the same manner to
God, Angels and Men.
IT is not my business at this time to make any Metaphysicall distinction
between the Persons of Men and Angels; b^^ I desire to distinguish between
created an^ uncreated Persons* because uncreated Persons subsist in one single
and infinite ess^nce* It may seem strange to some Metaphysical wits that one
Person, and much more th^^ three distinct Persons should subsist in o^^ single
and undivided essence; but these discoursing wits do not distinguish betwee^
created and uncreated Persons. 2. (...) ground their faith on scholastical
subtiltie^* 3. Do not study the Holy Scriptures wi^^ humility and faith, and
beg a blessing o^ their studies by fervent Prayer* (...). Phil. 2. v. 6.
For they might read in the Scriptures of a divine Person subsisting in the
divine nature. Phil 2. 6. Being in the form of God, etc. That is subsisting in
the Nature of God, because it presently follows, that therefore he thought it
no robbery to be equal with God; for Persons that are coessentiall (...) needs
be coequall; Christ and his Father do both subsist in the same divine essence,
for Christ is the express image of his Fathers subsistence, and he and his
father are one, one in essence, John 10. 30. Heb. 1. 3. We find this
interpretation was received in the time of Justinian. Edict. de Fide. (...).
Justinian the Emperor, and therefore it is not an interpretation lately
coined. Because it is said [who being in the form of God,] the Holy Ghost does
demonstrate the Hypostasis or Subsistence of the Word in the Essence of God.
And because it is said that he took upon him the form of a servant, it
signifies that God the Word, [that is God the Son,] is united with the Nature,
not the Subsistence or Person of man. He did subsist in the nature of God, but
he did assume the nature of man, and therefore Christ has a divine
subsistence, no humane Person; no humane Solis personis divinis ob infinitam
and simplicem Essentiam convenit in Essentia subsistere. Nulla enim persona
Angelica vel humana subsistit in Natura vel essentia.
Person subsists in the nature of man; nor does the Person of an Angel subsist
in the nature of an Angel; but the divine Person of Christ does subsist in his
Divine Nature, nay all the three Persons do subsist in the single and infinite
nature of God. From whence I conclude that there is not only a manifest, but
an infinite difference between created and uncreated Subsistences or Persons;
And I speak of Persona proprie est quid concretum ex essentia intelligente and
Personalitate.
Persons, rather then Personalities, because those abstract notions are not
very well understood by the most discoursing men; for even they acknowledge
that Abstracta faelicius intelliguntur mentione Subjectorum. Intellectus potius
de Concretis omnia praedicit quam de Abstractis* quia actiones sunt
Suppositorum.
Abstracts are not well, or not happily understood, unless you descend to the
consideration of their subjects. My purpose therefore upon most mature
deliberation, is, 1. To distinguish between created and uncreated Persons. 2.
To treat of uncreated Persons rather then Personalities, that is to treat of
the three Persons not abstracted from, but subsisting in the divine nature. I
will not speak simply of the Son, as a Son in that abstract relation, or of the
Son as a Person, or as the second Person, by abstracting his Personality from
the Divine Nature in which he subsists; but I desire to speak of Jesus Christ,
as subsisting in the nature of God, according to that expression of the
Apostle, Phil. 2. 6. who subsisting in the nature of God. For I am resolved to
follow the Scripture, and I do not think it safe to abstract the incommunicable
Subsistence of Christ, from the Divine nature in which he subsists, least I
fall into vain speculations, as many learned men have done. Now if you take in
the Divine Nature of Christ, (and there is the same reason of all three
Persons, because all have the same Divine Nature) there will be I say not only
a manifest, but an infinite difference between the Person of Christ, and the
Person of the most glorious Angel in Heaven. Created Persons.
They who have long studied the most refined and curious part of Metaphysics,
when they come to discourse of the distinction between a singular Nature and a
Person, are forced to confess that they do confine their speech to created
Natures and Persons, because De Natura and Personis divinis ex lumine rationis
fer^ nihil dici potest; mysterium de Deo Trinuno universam transcendit
Philosophiam.
there is even almost nothing evident to them by the light of reason,
concerning the Divine nature and uncreated Persons. And therefore on the other
side, it well becomes me to confine my discourse to uncreated Persons, because
there is so vast a difference between them, and the most excellent of all
created Persons; only something I must say of created Persons, that by
comparing them with uncreated Persons, I may demonstrate wherein they agree,
and wherein they differ.

Boethius relates, that when there was an Epistle of the Council of Chalcedon
read, in which there was this Orthodox Position, That Jesus Christ is a single
Person, and yet there are two distinct natures in his single Person; Boethius
desired the learned men then present, to assign the difference between a
singular Nature, and a Person, and no man, says he, was able to tell me the
difference, or to declare what a Person was. But though Boethius smiled at the
ignorance of others, yet he was not wise Vide Ch^^nitium ^e Trinitate c. 4.
enough to conceal his own; for he defines a Person thus; A Person Persona est
naturae rationalis individua Substantia* Boehbius l. de duabus naturis and una
persona Christi*
is the undivided substance of a rational nature. I am not at leisure to
reckon up the defects of this imperfect definition. Vasquez is bold to say that
Aristotle knew not how to distinguish a Person from a singular nature. And
there is no doubt but very Philos. distinctionem naturae and Personae vix
intelligebant, quia nihil de mysterio Incarnationis audiebant.
wise men have erred grossly in this point for want of studying, ^* The state
of the soul in its separation from the body. 2. The humane nature of Christ
assumed without any humane person. 3. The difference between the Divine Nature,
and Persons which subsist in it. I believe Aristotle did not study the first so
exactly as he should have done; and I am sure he knew nothing of these two last
most considerable points. I shall not stand to show the vanity of Laurentius
Valla. lib. 6. Elegant. In Deo poni personam, quod vere Deo sit triplex
qualitas, tales qualitates statuo in Deo and has dico esse personas.
Laurentius Valla, who seems to forget all his Elegancies when he comes to
discourse of a Person, and draws his arguments from the flourishes of an
Orator, or the several passions, humors, relations, conditions, or offices
of men that are personated upon a Stage; and therefore this Whiffler deserves
to be hissed off from his stage, for he does only make sport for Atheists and
Familists by such ridiculous discourse. And he is sufficiently absurd, when he
stoops so low as to say, that a Person is a Quality, and that there is a triple
Quality in God. And Vide sis Soaligerum in oratione de verbo Inepti satis
inepte disserentem. in Epist. p. 374.
Scaliger showed his Critical skill in Divinity to purpose, when he was so
foolish as to say that a Person does not signify a substance, but a quality.
Bellarm. lib 2. de Christo. cap. 5.
Bellarmine is Orthodoxe in this point, and proves at large that the word
Person does usually signify a Substance, in very approved Authors both sacred
and profane. Well may we then say, that the Church of God has not offended the
curious ears of such as are the great Masters of language the Orators, An
uncreated Person.
Civilians, Grammarians and others, when they say that a Divine Person does at
least connote the Substance or Nature of God; and the self-same substance being
in all three persons, it does not follow as Gostavius, or Mr. Fry would have
it, that there are three Substances in the Godhead, because there are three
Persons subsisting in the Godhead; for the substance or nature is the same in
all three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And we speak of the substance
of the Persons, when we describe them, not that we may show wherein they
differ, but that we may show wherein all three Persons agree. And if we should
abstract the Personality of these uncreated Persons from their Divine Substance
or Nature, when we describe them, we should seem to rob them of their Divinity
even in the very description of them. We must not say that a Divine Person is a
mere Nulla persona est purus (...) sive existendimodus, and mera proprietas,
vel relatio; Trinirate^ imprudenter tollunt qui Patre^ Filium and Spiritu^
Sanctum tres existendi modos definiunt; sunt enim Personae Coessentia^es
relative Propriety, or a pure manner of being, existing, or subsisting: for
every person is God, and all three Persons but one Jehovah, one God. They do
imprudently destroy the divine and coessential Trinunity, who affirm the Holy
Trinity to be nothing else but three Proprieties or three manners of
subsisting. For what is that consubstantial Trinunity, of which the Ancients
speak, but the single and infinite substance or essence of three Divine
Subsistences or Persons? If you leave out the Divine Essence or Substance out
of the definition, how is it a Consubstantial or Coessential Trinunity? The
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all three do Ca^olus Magnus apud Genebrardu^ cap.
20. Liturgiae; Pater prima, est divinitatis persona in qua* caeterae duae
naturaliter manentes existunt.
naturally subsist in the same divine and undivided nature. I must therefore
describe Divine persons as divine persons, when I am to put a difference
between them and uncreated persons; and if I describe them as Divine persons, I
must not abstract their personal proprieties from their divine nature, though
what is Quicquid Patri proprium and peculiare est, Patri sano modo natural
dicitur; est enim perfectio Rela^iva Patri qua sic natur^liter debita, tanquam

Personal may in some sense be affirmed to be naturally due to that particular

Proprieties or Characters whereby the Father, Son and H. Ghost do appear even
to our weak understanding, to be three distinct Subsistences; the whole and
undivided (...), quicquid tribus commune est cum pr^prietate habet peculiari.

after a different manner in every one of the three. The Father is God
subsisting after that peculiar manner, which is proper to the Father: Now that
peculiar manner of subsisting superadded to the Divine nature, does make a true
distinction between the Father, and the other two Subsistences, but it makes no
Composition at all, either in the Father, or in the Godhead. Hence Vide
Bisterf. de uno Deo, etc. lib. 2.. 1. cap. 4. Essentia divina est modo
substantiali modifica^a; Subsistentia enim est modus substantialis, qui ab ipsa
essentia divina separari nequit, imo persona divina est ipsam et essentia

it is that diverse profound and Orthodox writers maintain, that A divine Person
is nothing else but the very Divine Essence it self modificated. Give me leave
to explain this abstruse notion a little, by giving an instance in the 1.
Personal Principle, God the Father.

God the Father is the first Person of the Godhead distinguished from the Son
and Spirit (who are one and the same God with him) by his peculiar manner of
subsistence, singular relation, and incommunicable properties.

Here is, as they love to speak, the (...). Persona divina est ipsamet natura
divina peculiari modo se habens.
Divine Essence modificated with a peculiar manner of subsistence, a singular
relation and incommunicable properties. What this peculiar manner of
Subsistence, singular Relation, and incommunicable Properties are, I shall
demonstrate when I come to treat of the distinction of these 3 Divine
Subsistences in the very next Chapter. I hope I need say no more to prove, that
A Divine Person does at least connote the Substance, Essence, Nature of God;
and therefore it will not be safe to abstract the Personality of an uncreated
Subsistence, from that single and infinite Nature which is one and the same in
all three Subsistences. I do not find the most raised Persona direct denotat
subsistentiam, consequenter connotatnatura^. Vasquez. Persona est individuum
subsistens vivum, intelligens, incommunicabile, independendens, non sustentatu^
ab alio nec pars alterius. (...). Persona est suppositu^ intelligens Persona in
Concreto naturam includit, quia Persona naturam participat, and personalitas
est substantiae sive naturae modus Substantialis and separabilis, rarissime

subsistens* incommunicabilis, and independens.
Metaphysical wits very forward to define or describe a Personality; but they
speak of a Person in concreto, of a Subsistent rather then a Subsistence; and
of a Suppositum, rather then an abstract Suppositality. The imperfect
Definition of Boethius is commonly too commonly received in the Schools; and
he says, a Person is an undivided substance. They who have studied the point
more exactly, and correct his definition, do all agree that a Person is an
undivided substance, an understanding substance, a complete, incommunicable,
independent substance, which does not depend upon any thing else by way of
inhaesion, adhaesion, union, or any other way, for its sustentation. This is
the general and Persona conficitur ex essentia and proprietatibus distinctivis

F^st. S. Trinitatis.
common opinion. I know there are some private opinions, as I may call them,
concerning the Formality of a Person; which I shall but point at, and easily
confute with the light and gentle touch of a running pen. It is very absurd to
say that a Person is made complete in his subsistence by any Persona subsistit
per se; accidentia autem sunt in alio; ex natura Substantiali and accidentibus
non potest fieri unum per se. Vide Ferrariens. contra. Genesis 4. c. 39.
accidents or any formality arising from an heap of accidents, because a Person
is the most perfect substance, and therefore cannot be made complete by any
accidental subsistence; there is a manifest contradiction in that ridiculous
expression. Aristot. Categor. cap. 5.
Aristotle says that singular substances do subsist (...) most properly,
principally, perfectly; To subsist by its self, is the most perfect kind of
subsistence; and that cannot be said to subsist by it self, which does subsist
by an heap of accidents. Others say that a person is completed by a mere
Complementum Personae dicit negationem unionis co^municationis and dependentiae
tum aptitudinalis tu^ actualis, ut omnes parts tam integrantes quam
essentiales ipsaque etiam anima separata a ratione Personae excludantur. Vide
Joannem de Neapoli in Quodlibet.
Negation, but Subsistence is positive, though Subsistence may be described by
some expressions that are negative. The second person of the Trinity does
supply and perform all that an humane person can perform to the humane nature
of Christ. Now to say that the Divine person of Christ does supply the room of
a Vide Suarez. Disp. 34. Sect. 2. n. 8.
Negation, and do all that a Negation can do, is to say it does very little or
nothing at all. Finally, some say that a person is completed by the Existentia
communicabilis non potest este Subsistentia Personalis. Tria sunt in Supposito;
Natura, Existentia, and Subsistentia, sive Personalitas. Pantusa. Natura humana
existit in persona divina sine propria personalitate, non sine propria
existentia. Vasquez. Natura existens producitur non tantum in supposito proprio
sed and in alieno, uti patet de natura humana in Christo; non est enim in

Substantialis incommunicabilis and Independens, naturae intellectivae,
integrae, and completae conveniens. Anima rationalis separata habet Modum per
se, quem non habebat in corpore, sed est incompleta, and habet non tantum
obedientialem sed and Aptitudinalem dependentiam, quia ex natura sua est forma
materiae, and proinde non habet perfectissimum modum subsistondi per se.
Existence of its nature. But it is clear that a soul in the state of
separation does exist, and yet that soul is not a Person, nay never was a
Person at the first instant of its creation or union. And it will be most
absurd to say, that the humane nature was assumed by Christ, and hypostatically
united without or before the existence of that nature, because it was united
before it had any humane subsistence, and consequently before it had any
existence, if that subsistence be nothing else but existence, as these
Discoursers suppose. But it is high time to leave pursuing of these wanderers;
For it is clear, that Subsistence is a Positive and Substantial Mode, because
the most perfect manner of being, which we express as well as we can, when we
say, A Person does subsist by it self, without union unto, or dependence upon
any thing else for its sustentation; nay, that it is incapable of any such
union, though it be for the present in a state of separation. And therefore the
Schoolmen usually say, Quod subsistit per se, nec est nec esse potest in alio,
ullo modo; quia subsistere per se sumitur pro perfectissimo modo subsistendi
per se. It is evident by what has been said, that even created persons are
defined by their substance or nature which is in stead of a Genus when we
define a Person in Concreto; and when we speak o^ the Formality of a Person, we
say it is a substantial mode, and the most perfect manner of subsisting; and
therefore a created person is not completed by any quality or accident
whatsoever. Now if a created person be a substance, and the Formality of a
created person be substantial, I have no ground to abstract a Divine Person
from the Divine Substance or Essence, because a Divine person cannot be
separated from the Divine nature; as the humane nature may be from an humane
person; and though a Praecisive abstraction does not lay any ground either for
a Rational negation, or a real separation; yet if the Divine Nature be not
considered and taken notice of in the description of every Divine Person, men
will be apt to conceive that the Divine Nature and Persons may be separated.
The Scripture does not present any such abstract notion of the Father, Son, or
Holy Ghost unto us, but teaches us to consider them as Divine Persons, that is,
Persons that have a Divine nature; for else we should make a Non est Trinitas
modorum, sed personarum coessentialiu^ trinu^ itas.
Trinity of Modes, no Trinunity; a Quod excipiunt Trinitate^ igirur fore sine
Deo, ex eadem insulsitate nascitur. Vide Calv. Instit. lib. 1. cap. 13. Sect.
25.
Trinity without God or Godhead, and give our adversaries cause to say what
they have said, without cause, contrary to their own principles as well as
ours; E^ Trinitatem sine Deo! for even they themselves acknowledge the first
Person of the blessed Trinity to be God. It is our wisest course therefore to
describe every Person as a Divine Person, as God, and acknowledge all three
Persons to be one and the same God, according to the Scriptures. For we must
not only consider three Personalities, but three Nam Deus ita se praedicat
unic^ esse ut distinct in tribus personis considerandum proponat quas nisi
tenemus, nudum and inane duntaxat Dei nomen sine vero Deo in cerebro nostro

Persons, and the same single Godhead in all three Persons, and all three
Persons in the Godhead. I must not treat of the first Person simply as a
Father, but as a Divine and Eternal Father, as God the Father, Romans 15. 6.
Ephesians. 5. 20. Coloss. 2. 2. Joh. 17. 3. For God is to be so considered as he is
to be worshipped by us, and we are not to worship an abstract Personality
without reference to the Godhead. We must consider what is Common, as well as
what is Incommunicable; we must treat of that which is Absolute, as well as of
that which is Relative; and whilst we speak of a Trinity of Persons, we must
not forget the Unity of the Essence, that so we may not hold forth a Trinity of
Modes without Vide Calvinum Melanct. Oecolampadiu^, Bucanura, D. Altingium, D.

the Godhead, or tempt weak heads to dream of a Trinity of Gods. Judicious Mr.
Calvin did not think fit to discourse much of Created Persons, and therefore
described none but a Divine Person; and he would not adventure to abstract an
uncreated Personality from the Divine nature in which every of the three
uncreated Persons does subsist. In our most accurate definition of any created
nature, which we are best acquainted with, we judge it reasonable to take in
that which the nature defined has common with other natures, as well as that
which is proper to it alone. And certainly it is very fit, in our description
of every Divine Person, to take in the Nature which is common to all three
Persons, and not only what is proper and peculiar to any one. I call a Person
(says Calvin) a Subsistence in the Essence of God. And then he descends to
take notice of the Relation of a Divine Person to the rest of the co-essential
Persons, and his distinction from them by some incommunicable property. It will
be a very dangerous attempt then to treat of the Divine Persons in such
abstract expressions as do only hold forth some curious notions about the
relation of these persons to, The Godhead is not to be abstracted from the
persons or the persons from it The Godhead described, not abstracted. De
omnibus and sing^lis and solis his tribus personis tota Deitas perfecta and
omnibus numeris una dicitur.
and distinction from one another, without taking notice that all three Persons
(...) coeternall and coequall, because coessential* If we will discourse
soberly of the Godhead, we must speak of it as one single infinite perfection
common to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to all three, and none other The single
Godhead, the whole Godhead is i^ every single person, and it is common to a^
three in a singular and glorious way. For the divine nature is not communicated
to these Three, as a Genus to its Species, for it i^ undivided and indivisible;
nor as a Speci^^ to its Individua, for it is not multiplicable nor as a Totum
or whole to its parts, for the Godhead has no parts, it is impartible, and as
has been said, indivisible; nay the Godhead is not communicated so to any one
Person, as a created nature to^ created person, which may be separate^ from a
created subsistence; for the Divine Nature cannot possibly be separated from
all, or any one of the Divine Subsistence^ or Persons. And therefore we must
no^ discourse of the Godhead in such a Notional way, as if the Godhead did
exist out o^ the three Persons without any relative subsistence; for that is
clearly to dream of some strange Absolute God, The strange God idolized by some*
who is neither Father, Son, nor Holy Ghost. When we describe the Godhead
according to our be^ understanding, we dare not abstract it from the three
Persons; but say, that*

The Godhead is one single, The single Godhead.
spiritual, infinite Essence, in which the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost do
subsist.

And when we describe a Divine Person, it is absurd to abstract the Personality
from the Divine Nature; for how can you describe a Divine person, if you do
abstract his Personality from his Divinity. Every single Person is God, nay
every single Person is the Godhead, the Nature, the Essence of God, considered
with that subsistence, relation, and propriety which is peculiar to that
Person. Every single Person is God of himself, How the three Persons are one
God.
Deus non est per alind Deus. Finally, ^ake all the three Persons together, and
^hey are nothing else but one God; and ^hey are one God, not Absolutely

but Relatively considered with those peculiar relations, and incommunicable
properties whereby ^he three Persons are distinguished from one another. When

essentia ^um distinctis relationibus personalibus considerata.
name of God is taken Essentially or Commonly in Scripture, we say it does
belong to all three Persons, because it is spoken without any determination or
restriction to any one particular person, as John 4. 24. God is a Spirit, Mat.
4. 10. Mat. 19. 17. There is none good but God. These places must needs be
interpreted of all three Persons; for it is certain, that Christ did not by
these speeches exclude himself or the Holy Spirit from being good, or being
worshipped. And when the Name of God is taken personally or singularly in
Scripture, we say it is understood of one Person by a Synechdoche, because
though the other Persons may be excluded from what is proper and peculiar to
any one Person, because it is personal, and therefore incommunicable, yet they
cannot be excluded from any thing that is essential, because the same Divine
essence is common to all. Now the Title of God is essential; and what has
been said of that, is true of all Essential Titles and Attributes: but Personal
relations, properties, and actions, are all peculiar, as we shall show at large
in the next Chapter.

All that I need infer from hence for the present is, That when we describe
the Divine nature, we should not abstract it from the three Persons; and when
we describe a Divine Person, Created Personali* t^es not abstracted.
we should not abstract him from the Divine Nature. When the Scripture speaks
of Created persons, it does not abstract the personality from the singular
substance or nature. When the Apostle says, 2 Cor. 1. 11. that thanks shall be
given by many persons, he does not mean many personalities, but many humane
singular substances; thanks should be given by a multitude of men, particular
men. Actiones sunt suppositorum, non suppositalitatum. In like manner when we
read that Christ is the Character of his Fathers person, How Christ is the
Character of his Fathers Person.
Heb. 1. 3. the word is Subsistence; the meaning is not, that the Son is the
character or express image of the Fatherhood of the first Person; for Christ
does not beget a Son, as the Father does; but Christ is the image of the
Subsistent, (that is) of God the Father, and not of the mere Subsistence or
Personality, as it is abstracted from the Divine Nature.

Jesus Christ has two natures in one single person: The Person of Christ is
single and Divine.
now that person is a Divine person, the second person of the Godhead; and if I
describe the person of Jesus Christ, I may abstract his person from his humane
nature, and not mention that nature, which does infinitely differ from his
Divine person: but I must not abstract the person of Christ from his divine
nature, Christus non solum officio Deus est, ut blasphemant Sociniani, sed
Natura Deus est; coesse^tialis enim filius est. Con^equens est, si in Deum
credius, and in me cred^re debeatis, quod non esset conseque^s si Christas non
esset Deus. Johan. 14 1. (...) non est Patri peruliaris, sed tribus personis
Co^munis.
because he has no other then a divine person, which cannot be separated from,
(and should not be described without consideration, and mention of) the divine
nature. For this Second Person is not barely considered as a person, or as a
second person, but as a divine person, as the second person of the Godhead, as
the natural, coessential, coequal, coeternal Son of God as his own Son, his
first begott^^ Son, his only begotten Son. Romans 8. 32. Ioh. 1. 14. And
therefore he must be considered as God, the true God. God blessed for ever,
Ioh. 1. 1. 14. 18. Romans 9. 5. 1 Ioh. 5. 20. and therefore he must be described
as God (...) himself; for the Son is Jehovah, as has been proved and we are
obliged to believe in the Son as well as in the Father, Ioh. 4. ^. Jesus Christ
is one and the same God with the Father. Now Papists and Socinians wi^^ both
confess, that the Father is (...) God of himself; and therefore it will follow
that the Son The unbegotten Nature of the only begotten Son.
is God of himself. If the Godhead of the Son were begotten, and the Godhead of
the Father unbegotten, there would be two distinct Godheads in the Father and
the Son, the one begotten, and the other unbegotten. Take it thus the^ in
brief: The second Person The second Person of the Godhead.
of the Godhead is the only begotten Son of God subsisting i^ the unbegotten
nature of God* because he is the natural and coessentiall Son of God the
Father, and therefore has one and the same unbegotten nature with the Father;
the subsistence of the Son is begotten, but the divine nature of the Son is
unbegotten. The Divine ^erson of the Holy Ghost.


The Holy Ghost is an infinite Spirit, coessential with the Father and the Son,
and not a mere Subsistence proceeding from both; and yet he is distinguished
from both by his personal relation and incommunicable property.

These grounds being laid for a foundation, Certain Conclusion^ concerning
Divine Persons.
it is easy to build on, and infer -- 1. That the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, are not mere Personalities, but Divine Persons. 2. A Divine Person is
not a Quality or any other Accident, but an infinite Substance subsisting after
the most perfect, and glorious manner that is, or can be. 3. The Divine nature
being infinite, does contain all manner of perfection within it self, both
Absolute and Relative; and therefore the relations which are between the Divine
Persons, are natural, perfect, divine. 4. The Divine Nature cannot be
separated from all* or any one of the Divine Persons. 5. These three Divine
Persons are one and the same God, one Infinite Spirit; and therefore they are
Coessential, Coequal, Coeternal. 6. These three Divine Persons are
distinguished (as shall be shown in the next Chapter) but cannot be divided or
separated either from the Divine Nature, or from one another, because they do
al^ three subsist in the Divine nature, and in one another; for they have one
and the same single and infinite nature, and are one infinite Spirit, the same
omnipresent God. 7. The The Word Subsistence explained.
word [ (...) sumitur pro re per se Subsistente, pro supposito intelligente,
pro divina Dei Patris Subsistenria, Heb. 1. 3. F^lius est imago Personae
Patris, est enim filius essentiae ejusdem cu^ Patre, non imago essentiae.
Subsistence] is a consecrated word, which as we find upon record in the holy
Scripture, is fit to be made use of when we speak of that Divine manner of
being which the Father, Son and Holy Ghost have in the Godhead and in one
another. The heathen Orator could say, Verbis consecratis utendum; He meant
words that were consecrated by the use and approbation of Classical Authors;
but I mean, words consecrated by the Holy Ghost. The word (...) which we render
Subsistence, and by way of Analogy, PERSON; has many (...) in Scripturis

Nazianz. etc.
other significations; but when it is used on this occasion, upon this subject,
we may after so many disputes about this Argument, easily understand the
proper, and consecrated importance of the word. We may take warning by the
mistakes of others, and avoid those rocks on which others have suffered
shipwreck. Some who understand that (...) did signify essence, were offended
with such as said there were three Hypostases in God; because according to that
signification of the word, to say that there are three Hypostases in God, is to
say that there are three Essences in God and consequently, that there are three
Gods. It is readily acknowledged that the (...) significat naturam vere
Subsistentem and per se subsistentem hoc est modo perf^ctissimo subsistentem.
word (...) does sometimes signify the nature or essence of a thing, not the
generical or specifical nature in their latitude and abstract universality, but
the nature Hypostatica Emphaticis opponuntur, quia omnia Hypostatica veram
habent essentiam. (...). Aristot.
truly existing, and subsisting in the world. This acception of the word may,
all things duly considered and soberly expounded, be admitted, with some grains
of allowance for the infinite difference which is between created, and
uncreated Subsistents. For if Hypostasis be described in concreto, for which we
have with invincible reason contended all along this Chapter, then (...) est
Essentia divina charactere hypostatico insignita, sive proprio subsistendi modo
distincta. Magnum discrimen est inter Personam and proprietatem Personae:
proprietas Patris Absoluta, est esse (...), Respectiva esse Pa^rem; Persona
autem Patris est Deus filium gignens in unitate essentiae ingenitae.
Hypostasis does connote the Divine Nature, and signifies not an Abstract
Subsistence, but a Complete Subsistent. When I say that Jesus Christ is the
Character of his Fathers Subsistence, I do not (as I have formerly shown)
understand it thus, that Jesus Christ is the Character of his Fathers Abstract
Personality, but he is the Character of God the Father; I take in the Divine
Nature. But you must then consider that the glory of the Trinunity must be
preserved in this acception; for there is not a new nature in every one of the
Three but the Divine nature which is connoted in these three Hypostas^s is the
very same; there is the glory of the Mystery which dazles the eye of carnal
reason; And therefore whatever we say on this argument, must be taken cum
granosalis and expounded (...), because of the infinite difference between a
finite and infinite nature, and between created and uncreated persons, as I
shall (God willing) show at large before I conclude this Chapter. Three Persons
may, and do subsist in one and the same Infinite Nature: and therefore though
every (...) significat naturam Absolutam Communem: (...) significat Naturam
subsistentem cum proprietatibu^ Relativis and distinctivis
Hypostasis does connote the Divine nature, yet all ^ here connote one and the

subsist. To subsist, is (as Aristotle the great Interpreter expounds it) to
have the most perfect manner of Being by it self, that a Substance the best of
Beings can attain to; and it is very proper to say, that the Father Son and
Holy Ghost have the most perfect manner of Subsistence in the Divine nature
that is or can be. The Divine (...) apud Craecos Logicos Personam significat,
and (...) non raro essentiam, sed vocum earum in Theol. jam fixa est and

Nature considered with all Absolute and Relative Perfection in Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, does most truly, properly, and perfectly subsist; for there are
three illustrious Subsistences in that one undivided infinite Nature; The
Divine Persons do most perfectly s^bsist.
and therefore the Godhead thus considered, does subsist Aristot* Categor.

most perfect Substance; God is the most single and singular Substance, and he
is the only Infinite spirit, the best of Spirits, and therefore he must needs

will be bold to infer, that these three Persons only do perfectly subsist by
themselves, though in Clamamus, siquis tres Hypostases, aut tria (...) hoc est

How there are three in on^. and one in three.
one another; for they have one Independent, Spi^itual, Infinite Nature, which
is of it self, and is complete in it self, because Infinite in Perfection, and
therefore contains all absolute and Relative perfection in it self: but when we
speak of the Relative perfection, we speak of (...). Athan^s. Symb. Naz. orat
37. Sophron. act. 11. Council. Oecum. sexti. Damas. Anasta^. Syn.
three in one, because the Relative properties are distinctive: and when we
treat of the Absolute perfection, we speak of One in Three, one Essence in
three Persons, who do all three subsist with their Relative and Incommunicable
properties, in that most perfect and single Essence. This is that Divine
Trinunity which contains all Absolute and Relative Perfection, And therefore
has the most perfect and excellent Subsistence, that is, or can be, Finally,
though these three Persons do mutually subsist in one another, yet they are
said to subsist by themselves,

as Accidents do exist in a Subject; for Accidents exist in another, because of
their imperfection; but these subsist in one another, because of their
perfection, because they have the same single infinite nature, and are one
infinite and omnipresent Spirit.

2. They subsist mutually in one another; the Father subsists in the Son, Ioh.
14. 10, 11. as well as the Son in the Father; and therefore this subsisting in
one another does not argue any imperfection, but does demonstrate the infinite
perfection of all Three Subsistents: but there is no mutual inexistence of an
accident in a subject, and a subject in that accident or any other.

3. These three Subsistents have one and the same spiritual, Hypostases
dicuntur, nulla tamen est in divinis personis suppositio vel subjectio, sed
coessentialis aequalitas. Vide Aquin. p. 1. q. 39. art. 1.
independent, infinite nature, which is complete of it self, and in it self;
and the whole Creation does not afford one Example to illustrate, much less to
parallel these three illustrious Subsistences in one undivided Nature. And it
is impossible it should: for, this one undivided Nature in which these three
glorious Persons do subsist, is an infinite nature, and there can be but one
Infinite; and therefore the Socinians seem to have lost what they do so much
idolize, their Reason, when they desire us to illustrate this Mystery by an
Example.

4. These three Subsistents are Coequal, because Coessential. The Fathers upon
some of these considerations did agree to use the phrase of three Hypostases
and one Essence, though the word Hypostasis was not so plain and familiar at
first, especially to Latin ears, and therefore Hieronymus Epist. 57. Novel.
lum a me homine Romano nomen exigitur -- Interrogamus quid per tres Hypostases
posse arbitrentur intelligi. Tres Personas subsistentes aiunt. Respondemus nos
ita credere. Non sufficit sensus, expressum nomen efflagi^ant -- and quia
vocabulanon ediscimus haeretici judicamur Hieron. Epist. 57. si quis tres
subsistentes personas non confitetur Anathema sit.
Hierome complains that some were too rigorous in imposing that word without
expounding of it to such whose judgment was Orthodox, though their skill but
small in the Greek.

To conclude my discourse upon this word Subsistence, be pleased to consider
that we read of the Nature of God, we read of the Subsistence of the Father,
and we read that these three, Father, Son and Holy Ghost are one; having these
two words [Nature and Subsistence] in Scripture, we are prompted by the Spirit
speaking in the word to explain this Mystery thus; The Father, Son and Holy
Ghost are three in Subsistence, but one in Nature. No Mystery can be explained
with less Violence and more Sobriety; for we are precise in keeping to the
very words of Scripture in explaining this grand Mystery to the plainest of
men; and therefore they were sentenced of old that did not believe this plain
truth.

IX. We have no reason to be offended with the Use of the word Person,
Concerning the word Person.
when we treat of this Argument, if we add a fit Epithet, and say the Father
is a divine Person, or an uncreated Person, and say the same of the Son and
Holy Ghost* The word Person signifies the most excellent kind of Subsistent, an
understanding Subsistent, as is acknowledged by all the Masters of Language,
sacred and profane, as has been proved; and that place 2 Cor. 1. 11. is very
clear; of all the derivations of Persona, that pleases me Persona quasi per se
Sonan^ fic non nemo. Persona quasi per se una; sic Criticoru^ facile principes
Persona quasi a verbo (...) vel (...) quasi cinctum quid, vel (...) quasi
habens aliquid circa corpus.
best, Persona quasi per se una; because it does express the unity and
excellency of a personal subsistence. Per se notes the excellency, because
subsistere per se notes the most excellent kind of subsistence. Nay, the word
(...) quamvis substantiam prim^m significat, tam animatam quam inanimatam,
P^^sona vero, tantum substantiam singularem intelligentem qualis Deus, Angelus,
homo.
Person does express more excellency then the word subsistence alone, does
import, for it is proper to say that a Beast does subsist, Uncreated Persons.
but it is absurd to say that a Beast is a Person because a Person is an
understanding subsistent. But neither of these Magna prorsus ^opia humanum
laborat eloquium. Dictum est tamen tres personae, non ut illud diceretur, sed
ne taceretur omnino. Non enim rei in, effabilis eminentia hoc vocabulo
explicari valet. Aug. lib. 5 de Trinitate cap. 9.
words does express the excellency of that subsistence which the Father, Son
and Holy Ghost have in the Godhead. And therefore we do not only say that these
three are Persons or Subsistenc^s, but we say they are uncreated Persons,
Divine Subsistences, Persons subsisting in the Divine Nature, Persons of the
Godhead, that so we may take in all the excellency which these words
Subsistence and Person do afford; and then by other Epithets superadd that
excellency which is proper to Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and leave out all
that imperfection which is in created persons and subsistences. The word
Subsistence is in the Scripture; Heb. 1. 3. The word Person is in Scripture
applied to men, 2 Cor. 1. 11. who have a more excellent subsistence then
beasts* An understanding subsistence; and therefore both (...). Damascen. in
Dialog. cap. 43. Nazianzen. orat. 31. in laudem Athanasii.
Greek and Latin Fathers did at last agree to use the word Person, because it
signifies an understanding subsistent. And if you add divine or uncreated
Person, then there is no danger of any mistake; unless men will be so vain as
to say the word Vocibus non semper cum respectu suae originis, sed ex recepta
consuetudine utendum. Anti-Trinitarians aequivocate in abusing the various
significations of the word Person.
Person does sometimes signify a visible shape, an outward form or appearance,
the countenance or gesture of a man, or else some office, relation, or quality;
and say that we do make three shapes, countenances, etc. in the Godhead; as
Sabellius, Servetus, and such bold Atheists as have sucked in their poison, are
wont to say. We do therefore vindicate the Church of God from these insolent
and groundless aspersions, and freely declare what we mean by Person, namely
an understanding Subsistent. Every of the Three Divine Persons has an office,
and has a relation; but no Divine person is an Office, or a mere Persona
significat Relatione^ prout est Subsistens in natura divina. Aquin. p. 1. q 39.
art. 1. In creaturis relationes sunt accidentales, and proinde accidentaliter
insunt, relationes autem in Deo sunt subsistentes, and ipsamet essentia divina,
Aquinas ibidem. Pater non genuit meram nudamque relationem, sed correlatum,
Filium subsistentem, nec non coessentialem.
Relation; but the Godhead does contain all relative as well as absolute
perfection within it self, as has been said. How a divine Person is said to
take upon him two several Persons.
God, as represented to us in Scripture, does as it were take upon him the
person of a displeased Father, and sometimes of a well-pleased Father; but we
do not say there are three such Persons in the Godhead: for one Divine Person
may sustain the person of a well-pleased Father at one time, and the person of
a displeased Father at another. And if any man will be so ridiculous us to
conclude from thence, that then one person may be two persons; I hope he will
see his own vanity, and be sensible of the equivocation, by considering what
has been said already in this very Chapter.

When we say, God does take upon him the Person of a well-pleased Father, we
speak (...) after the manner of men; just as when we speak of the eyes and
hands of God, but we must be understood Locutiones Impropriae Dei essentiam non
exprimunt, sed ejus notitiam tenuitati nostrae accommodant.
(...) after such a manner as becomes the infinite dignity and pure majesty of
God.

If men do not wilfully mistake, Unwritten words hold forth the written truth.
they may then know what we mean by Person, when we say there are three
uncreated Persons in the Godhead. The word Person is in Scripture; and if it
were not, yet as long as the thing signified by it is there, we have no reason
to account that Voces tanquam consecratas omni jure judicamus, si earum
conjugata, and Synonyma in Sacra pagina reperiantur. Si enim talibus vocibus
sensum mentemque Scripturae exprimentibus uti non liceret, nec explicare
Scripturam pro concione liceret, neque in alias linguas vertere.
word, or any other such like, an Exotic word, because we find it very proper
and pertinent to the point in hand, in the sense which we have so often
declared, that there might be no mistake, but a full agreement in such an high
and weighty point. Temere non sunt inventa nomina quae per evidentem
consequentiam mentem Domini in Scripturis loquentis fideliter exprimu^t;
cavendum est ne vocabula repudiando, ipsam repudiemus veritatem, superbaeque
temeritatis simul and haereseos arguamur.
It is out of question, that we may expound the Scripture by words and phrases
which are not in those very letters and syllables to be found in Scripture, as
long as we do not affect a needless curiosity in inventing new and obscure
phrases* and a rigid superstition in defending them; for that would not conduce
to edification; but beget or foment an endless contention. Our expressions
must be sober and plain; grave and useful, such as may hold forth the godly
and prudent simplicity of the Scripture. That is all that needs be said for the
use of such words and phrases as are fit and necessary to be used in this and
diverse other obscure points.

There are some that mistake the Attributes of God for Persons, Persons are not
Attributes as Sabellius dr^am't.
and they make more then three persons; and therefore I shall not go about to
reckon up the innumerable absurdities which follow upon that one mistake. Vno
absurdo dato, mill sequuntur. I read, indeed, that Sabellius conceived the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be different Attributes of God: But the
Orthodoxe Christians desired him to remember that there were more then three
Divine ^ttributes, and pressed him to acknowledge, that A Trinity of persons do
subsist in the unity of the nature of God; Unwritten words hold forth the
written truth.
and then they would close with him and give the right hand of fellowship unto
him.

The fraud and subtilty of Arius, Sabellius, and the rest of the old
Heretics, gave the reverend Doctors of the Church cause to use the words Cum
Scriptura testetur tres dici quorum quisque in solidum sit Deus, nec tamen
plures esse Deos, nimis morosum est de voce contendere, cum res in aperto sit.

Trinity, Coessential, Consubstantial, and the like, that they might more
clearly and fully manifest this profound and glorious mystery: And they who
did wrangle about these Words, did indeed deny the Mystery and thing it self;
and therefore did but manifest their pride, fraud, obstinacy, for the
maintenance of their damnable Heresy, when they quarrelled with those eminent
Writers, for making use of Hi^ar. lib. de Synodis. Inane enim est calumniam

unwritten words and phrases, upon so just and necessary occasion, that the
written truth might be more clearly explained and fully defended. It is not in
the judgment of any man, any fault at all, to make truth plain; unless in the
deluded judgment of such who are enemies to truth. Now we have removed the
rubbish, we begin to build.

A Divine Person is a Spiritual and Infinite Subsistent, A Divine Person
described.
related indeed to those other uncreated Persons, which subsist in the same
Divine Nature with it, but distinguished from those Coess^ntial persons by its
peculiar manner of subsistence, order of subsisting singular relation* and
incommunicable property. In these few line there is matter enough to fill many
sheets, and I am to treat of the distinction of persons at large in the next
Chapter.

A Divine Person is Spiritual, The description of a Divine Person explained and
confirmed.
for God is a Spirit, the Father of Spirits, the Spirit of Spirits, an infinite
Spirit, and therefore has life, the best of lives, nay is life it self in
perfection, and therefore we read of the understanding and will of God; an
understanding life is the best life that we are acquainted with; and the life
of God is a subsisting life, every one of the Divine persons is subsistent, and
therefore, every one of them has subsisting life. We may then safely conclude,
that every one of the Divine persons is a spiritual and infinite Subsistent: I
say Subsistent, to show that I do not abstract the Subsistence of the person
from the Divine Nature in which the person does subsist; herein all the three
Persons do agree.

Moreover, every Divine Person has some Relative perfection, for they are
mutually related to one another.

Finally, every Divine Person has some peculiar and incommunicable property.
But if we come to treat of any peculiar manner of subsisting, or the Order of
subsisting, or that singular relation which is proper ^o every one of the
three, or any certain ^ncommunicable property, whereby any one person is
distinguished from the rest, ^hen we must leave treating of what is common to
all three persons, and show wherein these Coessential persons differ, or
whereby it does appear to us, that they are distinguished. We will therefore
for Orders sake enquire, Three distinguishing questions propounded which are in
their order to be stated and resolved.


1. What distinction there is between the Divine Nature, and the Divine
Persons, Father, Son and holy Ghost.

2. What difference there is between ^reated and uncreated persons.

3. How these three uncreated persons are distinguished from one another.

This question concerning the Distinction of the Divine Vox Nat^rae a ^ascendo
derivatur, sed pro quavis essentia usurpatur; vocibus enim non semper cu^
respectu suae originis, sed ex recepta co^suetudine utendum. Hypostases in
divinis non dicunt aliquam suppositione^ vel subjectione^ sed aequalitatem
coessen^ialem.
Nature and these three most glorious persons which subsist in it, is the most
difficult point in all Divinity, and therefore I humbly beg the assistance of
all these glorious persons, that I may conceive and write judiciously and
reve^ently of this profound and glorious My^^erie of Faith. I remember that
excellent ^peech of judicious Calvin; Non minori ^eligione de Deo nobis
loquendum quam cogitandum sentio; quicquid autem de Deo a nobis cogitamus
stultum est, and quicquid loquimur insulsum. What ever we think^ or speak of
our own heads concerning God, will be like our selves unsavourie, foolish and
vain. No language is rich enough, no words are significant enough to declare
this profound Mystery, which the understanding of men and Angels cannot
comprehend, nor the tongue of men and Angels express; if all the Saints and
Angels in heaven and earth should sit in Council and communicate their notions
to one another about this Argument, they would acknowledge this Mystery to be
not only inexplicable and unspeakable, but unconceiveable and incomprehensible.

1. Concerning the Distinction which is between the Divine Nature, The
difference between the divine Nature* and Persons.
and a Divine Person, it is to be considered that I have most studiously
declined the describing of a Divine Person in abstracto for the reasons
mentioned above, and I might add many others; but it is enough to say that the
most cleanly Abstraction does but suggest an inadaequate Conceit of a Divine
Person; The Inac^^quade conce^t of a divine Person
and when you abstract the nature of God from the personalities, men are apt to
dream of some strange God that is neither Father, Son nor holy Ghost, and so to
create a new God, or to conceive that the Divine Nature may, as the humane
nature of Christ does subsist in alieno supposito.

2. They who deny the Trinity, must if they be not worse then Turks or
Socinians acknowledge, The Socinians engaged to state the point in question.
that God the Father does subsist, and therefore they are engaged to show the
difference between the Essence and Subsistence of the Father, as well as we
are, who believe the Trinity. But there is no greater a distinction between
the Person of the Father, and the Nature of the holy Ghost, then there is
between the Person of the Father, and the Nature of the Father; for the Nature
of the Father and the holy Ghost is one, and the same Divine Nature, which is
as impossible to be divided, or multiplied in two or three Persons, as it is in
one single and undivided person, because the Divine Nature is single and
infinite, and the Divine Persons do mutually subsist in one another, and all
three Persons subsist in this single and undivided Nature, which is
indivisible, immultiplicable and most purely and singularly one and the same
infinite perfection in all three Persons, and there can be but one most single
absolute and infinite Perfection.

3. The Divine Nature is subsistent, necessarily and perfectly subsistent; the
most perfect manner of subsisting by and of it self is due to the most perfect
Nature.

4. The Divine Nature is not indifferent to subsist in the Father, Divina
natura salva omnimoda perfectione Dei non potest carere aliqua personarum
divinarum.
Son and holy Ghost, or out of them; for in regard of its infinite Perfection
and actualitie it can neither subsist without, or otherwise then in the Father,
Son and holy Ghost; because the Divine Nature cannot subsist without all, or
any of that Relative perfection, which shines in these three glorious persons,
who do all subsist in the same Divine Nature, and yet mutually subsist in one
another with all Relative Perfection. The reason is most clear, because the
Divine Nature being infinite in perfection must needs contain and comprehend
all Relative as well as all absolute Perfection.

5. God is not compounded (as Angels are) of Nature and Subsistence; for
whatsoever does belong to the Perfection of God, does belong to the Nature of
God, and therefore God does not subsist by the superadding of any thing or
manner of a thing, any. Modus that is (as the Schools speak) Extraessential,
or really distinct, and separable from the Essence and Nature of God. And we
have formerly shown, that the Essence of God is intrinsecally necessary, and
infinitely perfect, and therefore the most perfect manner of subsisting by, and
of it sel^ is due to the most perfect Nature.

6. Although Men and Angels are not able to comprehend, Deus est idem quod sua
essentia vel natura; de Deo loquentes utimur nominibus concretis ut
significemusejus subsistentiam, and utimur nominibus abstract is ut
significemusejus simplicitatem. Quod ergo ^icitur Deitas vel vita, velaliquid
hujusmodi esse in Deo referend^ est ad diversitatem quae est in acceptione
intellectus nostri, and non ad aliquam diversitatem rei. Aqin. Sum. p. 1. q. 3.
art. 3. in corpore Art. and resp. ad primum. Est de essen ia cujusliber

much less express this incomprehensible Mystery, yet we may set satisfactorie
bounds to our thoughts and discourses by the Analogy of faith; for the
Scripture says that the Father and the Son are one, and that all three Persons
are one, and therefore we do conclude that as the infinite Perfection and
Actualitie of the Divine Nature does require three Subsistences, because this
infinite Perfection does contain all Relative, as well as all absolute
Perfection, so does the single and most singular Nature of God, require that
these three glorious Persons subsist in the Unity of the Godhead. Now we are
sure that the One-nesse, or singleness of Gods Nature does well agree with the
infinitness of his Nature, because there can be no multiplication of that which
is infinites; there cannot be two or three infinites, and therefore we must
needs conclude, that these three Subsistents are one infinite God subsisting
with all absolute and Relative Perfection. This is the Sum and Substance o^ all
that can be said a part rei as we use to speak; but because we are not able
distinctly to apprehend the absolute and Relative Perfefection of God, God does
make himself known to us in a way most suitable to our weak apprehensions in
representing himself to be an eternal Father, and then we are ready to enquire
after and willing to hear of an eternal Son; Now according to our weak manner
of conceiving we must needs apprehend that there is a Divine Relation between
the eternal Father and his coeternal Son, and conclude that these two are
distinguished from, and in a well qualified Sense opposed to, one another with
a mere Relative Opposition, for there can be no contrary Opposition between
the Persons; but this Relative and friendly Opposition assures us, that the
Father is not the Son, and that the Father did not beget himself, but did beget
his Son; But then we consider again, that this Son is an eternal Son, and
therefore is God, and we are sure God did not beget another God, for the Power
of God is not nay cannot be exercised about any thing repugnant to the Nature
of God, and nothing is more repugnant to the Godhead then a Plurality of Gods;
and therefore we must conclude, that the Father and Son are one, and the same
God; Now we are come to the Mystery which faith must receive, and reason
admire.

7. We may best resemble all that difference which is between the Essence of
God and the Divine Subsistences, by considering the transcendent Affections of
Ens simpliciter and the Attributes of God, (...).
who does infinitely transcend not only a Praedicamental Substance, but a
Metaphysical Entity, as the most Metaphysical men who are sound in the Faith*
do honestly confess.

1. Concerning the transcendent Affections of Ens, The transcendent affections
of Ens.
which are unum, verum, and bonum; we say, these three affections, and Ens in
latitudine, do not make four things really distinct; and yet we say they are
real and positive affections; for our Metaphysical science has too much
serious Majesty, to be pleased with the pretty fictions of Reason, when our
understanding has got leave to play, and recreate it self with its own
artificial inventions. The thing is most clear and evident to all at the very
first proposal, because the things which God has made, are not beholding to
God only for their Entity, and to us for their goodness; for the things do not
cease to be good, when our understanding cease to work; but the things are
truly and really good, whether we think them to be so, or no.

Moreover we say, that these Positive and real affections of Ens do not make
any composition at all in Ens transcendently considered, because then the most
simple and uncompounded Being would lose its Being. For Simplicity would be
repugnant to Entity, if that Entity it self did involve any Composition. And
therefore it is agreed on all sides, that this proposition, Ens simplex est
Ens, is a true proposition. Finally, from what has been said it is reasonably
and commonly inferred, That Entity, Truth, Goodness, and Unity, make but one
Real thing, though they do all four differ quoad modum significandi; Because
the thing adaequately signified by all those four words is but one Real Thing,
namely the very Entity of Ens transcendently considered. For when I say, Ens
est unum, this Praedicate Vnum does not superadde any new Entity, but does
imply and connote the very Entity of Ens. Nay more, if you ask these
Metaphysical men, what this transcendent Unity is; they will not answer, that
Unity is Indivision, but Unity is the very undivided Entity it self; not that
Unity alone does signify simply and adaequately the same that Ens does in tota
latitudine, as Res or Aliquid do; for Unity does not signify Truth and
Goodness, which are the two other transcendent affections of Ens, but Ens in
its complete compass and adaequate signification does import Entity, Truth,
Unity, and Goodness also. Truth is a single affection of Ens, and therefore it
does signify or rather connote Entity under an inadaequate conceit or notion*
for it does represent Ens not in its full latitude, but as considered with
respect to the understanding. If we may now make so bold as to compare the
Essence of Essences with these Metaphysical notions, we may in some weak
measure resemble that difference which is between the Essence of God and Divine
Subsistences, at least in some few particulars: For if when we compare
creatures with creatures, there appear to be some dissimilitude even in the
most apt similitude, and no similitude runs (as we say) upon four feet; it is
not to be wondered at, if this comparison be rather a resemblance, then an
illustration. When Divine revelation has gone before, Rations praecedences
minuunt, rations subsequentes augent fidem.
and we have built upon that as the groundwork and foundation by a serious
faith, these Metaphysical notions may be subservient helps in a subordinate way.

1. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, do all Three really, positively, truly
subsist in the Divine Essence; and yet these three Subsistences, and the Divine
Essence, do not make four, no nor two things really distinct; even as Entity,
Truth, Goodness, and Unity, do not make four things really distinct, as you
heard but now, but are one real thing and no more.

2. Ens is not compounded of Entity, and its three Affections; nor is God
compounded of the Godhead and three Subsistences; nor is any one Person
compounded of the Divine Nature and Subsistence.

3. As Truth is not Goodness, nor Goodness Truth, nor either of them Unity,
and yet all three are Entity; so the Father is not the Son, nor is the Son the
Father, nor is either of them the Holy Ghost, and yet all three are God, for
they are all three but one God subsisting with all absolute and relative
perfection, as has been shown.

4. Every one of the three Affections of Ens, does connote Entity: Every one of
the three Subsistences does connote the Godhead, the Divine nature, as has
been proved at large.

5. Not any one of the three Affections of Ens does, nor do all three together
super-adde a new Entity; not any one of the three subsistences does, nor do all
three together super-adde a new Deity, a new Divine nature, or Godhead: For Ens
Ens est unum, verum, bonum. Ens est essentia unicum, affectionibus autem
trinu^, trinum and unum, Ens trinunum. Unum est quod prius de unoquoque ente
cognoscitur: Verum quod proxime cognoscitur; intellectus enim est prior
potentia, quam intellectus; and verum dicit ordinem ad intellectum; bonum ad
voluntatem. Denique si res sit ficta, non est bona; and proinde bonitas
quodammodo fundatur in veritate; omnes autem tres passiones sunt a part rei.
Entitas quoad significatum intrinsecum; entitas est bonitas and e converso.
is one; Ens est trinum, non triplex, trinum et unum Ens trinunum: Deus est
trinus non triplex, trinus et unus, Deus trinunus; This instance does in some
measure resemble the mystery of the Trinunity.

6. No affection of Ens can be really separated from Ens: Nor can one of the
Divine Persons be separated from the Divine Nature, or the Divine Nature from
any one of the Divine Persons, or any one of the Persons from either of the
other two.

7. All the Affections of Ens are distinguished, but none divided: all the
three Subsistences are distinguished, but they cannot be divided.

8. Truth and Goodness which are two of the Affections of Ens, are
distinguished by their several and peculiar relations; Truth has relation to
the understanding, and Goodness to the will: The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
are known to be distinguished by their several and peculiar relations; and if
it be not unreasonable to say that there is in Entity three affections, and two
relations in ente simplicissimo, without any Composition in, or Multiplication
of the Entity, why should it seem unreasonable, or at least why should it seem
incredible that there are three subsistences and several relations in the
Godhead, without any composition in, or multiplication of the Godhead?

9. One affection, nay all the affections in abstracto, do but inadaequately
represent Ens, unless you take notice of the Entity it self, as well as the
three Affections. One single Subsistence, nay all three Subsistences in
abstracto, do but inadaequately represent God, unless you take notice of the
Godhead in which they subsist; and therefore this praecisive abstraction of the
Subsistences from the Divine nature, is but an inadaequate conceit of God, as
has been demonstrated above in this very Chapter: for we must not dream of a
Trinity of Modes, but assert and believe the glorious and Coessential
Trinunity. The Father is truly God, that God who is the only true God; but the
Father alone does not Una subsistentia divina non plane prastat idem quod
praestat altera; est enim inter per^onas divinas differentia relativa numerica
Nec est essentia divina bis aut pluries id quod est, per tres subsistentias.
Nam per subsistentiam Patris essentia divina est Pater, non Filius: per
subsistentiam vero Filii nec Pater est nec Spiritus Sanctus: non itaque bis est
Pater, vel bis Filius, vel bis Spiritus Sanct^s; nec possibile est ut eodem
respectu essentia divina sit Pater, quo est Filius. Tanta autem est essentiae
divinae perfectio, ut una subsistentia ipsi non possit esse adaequata. Per
subsistentiam itaque Patris divina essentia adaequate est Pater, non vero
adaequate Deus. vid. Bisterfeld. lib. 2. sect. 1. cap. 5.
adaequately represent God to us as he is described in the Holy Scriptures. It
is true that the Divine Essence is by the Subsistence of the Father adaequately
the Father; but as God is represented by that Divine subsistence only, he is
not Deus Trinunus, he is not Father, Son and Holy Ghost; the Father alone is
not all those three Witnesses who are one God. And therefore the acute
Socinians with their precise abstractions do but suggest an inadaequate conceit
of God: that only true God whom we worship, does not subsist only in the Person
of the Father. We worship God subsisting with all Absolute and Relative
Perfection in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; for these three are that one God who
is the only true God blessed for ever. This is the adaequate representation of
God in the Scriptures of truth. And we are resolved to regulate all our
Metaphysical notions by the holy Scriptures, that we may make the highest of
Sciences to acknowledge the supremacy of that Divine science which is nowhere
to be learnt but in the Word of God; for the purest In quibus ratio estintegra,
religionis nostrae mysteria cum ratione consentiunt: in quibus corrupta, cum
ratione pugnant mysteria, ut rationem corrigant potius quam superent. In
omnibus enim mysteria supra rationem sunt omnino re, ratione, and ^odo.
reason must be elevated by the Word and Spirit of God, for the discovery of
this mystery.

10. These affections of Ens represent the manner of that Being which Ens has
as it is transcendently confidered; and the three Divine Subsistences do
represent that manner of Being which God has as he is most Deus est essentia
univoce sive Ens entium, transcendens transcenden^ium, and proinde essentias
non solum Physicas, sed and Metaphysicas omnes infinite omnibus modis superat;
and proinde discrimina multa incidere ne mireris propter similium istorum
inaequalitatem maximam.
transcendently considered, namely as subsisting after the most glorious manner
with all Absolute and Relative Perfection. It is the manner of a transcendent
Entity to be one, and true, and good, and it is the manner of Gods being to be
one God in three Subsistences; These three are one single God, there is no
Composition or Multiplication imaginable in this single and infinite being.

I was bold to adventure upon this enquiry because so Veritatem convenienter
Naturae ex sacris Scripturis asserimus; exiguum autem lumen tam est simile
maximo, ut prout natur^^ unum sunt, ita conjunctione in unm transeant, and in
majore ac perfectiore minus sorbeatur, vide I unium Trinit. defens. 1
many reverend learned Orthodox and pious Doctors of the Church have declared
that the Divine Essence differs from the Divine subsistences as the manner of
the thing does from the thing it self; and the Persons differ from one another,
tanquam modi a modis. I conceived that there was something more in the
expression then was commonly known. Moreover I considered that if there might
be so great simplicity or singleness in a Created and finite Entity,
notwithstanding there are three affections and two relations which do affect
that Entity, it seemed to me somewhat easy to believe that there are three
subsistences in one infinite Godhead without any composition in, or
multiplication of the single Godhead. Finally I perceive that some youthful
towering wits are drawn away from the simplicity of the Gospel by some froathy
speculations presented to them as most sublime curiosities and Curandum est
quod mentem errantium occupat, tumor rationis humanae ina^i Philosophiae

Metaphysicall notions; and therefore I humbly submit what has been said to
the judgment of the learned, and conclude this discourse with the same prayer
wherewith Augustine shuts up his books of the Trinity, Domine, Deus unus, Deus
Trinitas, quaecunque dixi in hoc libro de tuo agnoscant et tui; si quid de meo,
et tu ignosce and tui. O Lord, who art one God, O God, who art a whole Trinity
of Persons in the Godhead, what ever I have said (in this discourse) of thine,
let all that are thine acknowledge, what ever I have said of mine own, Lord let
it be pardoned by thee and thine.

infinite, because they do signify and declare the infinite Perfection,
Happiness, Majesty and glory of God; and to speak higher yet, these glorious
Attributes though they be very many, are nothing else but the single undivided
indivisible Essence of God, we may be instructed, but are even Quanto diutius

words to express it, especially in English, but indeed the most rich and
copious languages are only happy in the confession of their penury when we
come to treat of this argument, because the mystery of the Godhead does
transcend all our eloquence, and teaches us to admire and adore with silence
what we cannot express without a manifest demonstration of our ignorance.

2. The imperfect manner of signifying is easy to be observed in our most
significant words, and therefore we must confess that the Excellency of God
does transcend the significancy of the most significant words in the most rich
and copious tongues.

we are in the Visio quae caelestis Reip. cives beat, non fit per principia

body. If any man desire to know a reason why he cannot readily apprehend these
divine Mysteries, let him consider the perfection of the mystery, and the
imperfection of his own reason, and he has a sufficient reason, a reason from
whence he may draw a most invincible argument against idolizing of his own
reason, so far as to make his reason judge of the mysteries of faith.

Let us then prudently consider that we are not able to apprehend the
Intellectus finitus quod est simple^ and infinitu^ unico simplicique actu non
capit.
infinite and impartible Essence of God but as it were by parts, by many
incomplete and inadaequate conceits and apprehensions. The most profound and
serious Accipiendo Perfectionem p^o re ip^a quae perfecta est, non sunt in
divinis plures perfectiones Attributales; omnia enim in divinis quae sunt
Communia tribus non plurificantur, sed sunt unum simpliciter and una simplex
Essentia. Biel 1. Sent. did. 2. quaest. 2.
schoolmen have fairly expressed this truth: there are not (say they) many
Attribut all Perfections, nay there is but one Perfection in God; for all the
Essential Attributes of God are nothing else but that single and undivided
Essence which is singularly and altogether the same Essence in all three
subsistences. Nay, to speak properly the Div^ne Essence is one single infinite
perfection, and we cannot say that Perfection is in the Essence of God; but
rather that the highest Proprie and de virtute sermonis loque^do non est
concedendum quod in Deo vel divina Essentia sit perfectio, sed perfectio summa
est omnibus modis divina essentia ipsa ab ea penitus indistincta. Biel. 1.
Sent. did. 2 quaest. 2.
perfection, even infinite Perfection is the Essenc^ of God; it is every way
his Essence, and no way at all distinguished from it. Finally, if by Attributal
Perfections you mean the Conceits or Signs of Perfection, they say these Signs
do indeed signify the Divine Essence, but the Signs themselves are so far from
being the Essence of God, that they do not all of them signify the same Divine
Essence after the same way and manner of signifying; for it is clear, that some
of the Attributal Terms are affirmative, some are Multi termini Attributales

negative, some are absolute, some connotative, and relative. For observe that,
when the Perfection of God is declared per viam negationis, by Vide Basil. lib.
1. contr. Eunomium.
negative Expressions, as when we say God is immaterial, incorporeal,
invisible, immortal, immutable, immense, and the like, we intend to remove all
imperfection from the ^ssence of God, and leave his pure Essence single and
alone, because it is one single and infinite Perfection; we deny that there is
any thing in God which might make him like to the Creature in imperfection: For
what ever there is which betokens matter, change, privation, or imperfection,
we deny that to be in God, because God is one entire, infinite Perfection, and
therefore we say as I^dor. Clarius Orat. 5. tom. 1. page 21.
Isidore Clarius does, that in these negatives there does lay hid, not only a
positive but an infinite Perfection, and what is infinite, must needs be
single; you see still the Perfection is a single Perfection. And when the
Perfection of Go^ is declared per viam eminentiae, as the Schools speak, by
attributing all Perfection which we find in the Creatures unto God, after we
have removed all imperfection, we say the perfection Attributa illa quoad rem
significatam magis proprie Deo quam creaturis attribuuntur; accipiendo autem
perfectiones Attributales prosignis vel conceptibus* perfectionem significa^t,
sed imperfecto modo significant, and proinde modus significandi creatu^ is
proprie conv^nit, perfectio significata Deo convenit, sed secundum modum
Eminentiorem. Vide Th, page 1. quaest. 13. art. 2. 3. 6. Zanch. de Natura Dei.
cap. 8. quaest. 3.
signified is most perfectly and properly in God; but the manner of signifying
of that Perfection by Attributes taken from the Creatures, does somewhat
relish of that imperfection, which is in the Creature; and therefore we say
such Attributes in respect of the imperfect manner of signifying do not clearly
hold forth that single and infinite Perfection which is in God; Hence it is
that reverend Divines have laid down so many rules as Cautions to direct us in
this weighty point.

1. A finite and compounded understanding cannot apprehend the glorious
perfection of a single and infinite Essence, but by distinct proprieties or
Attributes.

2. The Essential Attributes are all of them common to all the three Persons of
the Godhead, and to them Omnes proprieta tes Dei no^ possunt creaturis
communicari, quia sic multiplicaretur ess^n ia: necaliquae, quia sic
divideretur.
only.

3. These Essential Attributes are not distinguished from the Divine Essence,
but are the very Divine Essence or Godhead it self.

4. All these Essential Attributes are infinite and eternal, because they are
the infinite and eternal Essence of God.

5. These Essential Attributes do Attributa Divina non distinguuntur actualiter
in reipsa, neque a Dei Essentia neque inter se, quia perfectio Divina est
simplici^er infinita. vide Irenaeum l. 2. contr. haeres. cap. 8. Just. Mart. q.
144. August. de Civ. Dei l. 12. cap. 2. Hen. quodlibet. l. 5. q. 1. Durand.
Ocham. in 1. d. 2. q. 2.
not differ from one another, because the Essence of God is single,
uncompounded, undivided, indivisible, and one of these Attributes does
Essentially praedicate of the other. The power, wisdom, goodness of God, are
single, eternal, immutable, infinite.

6. These Essential Attributes do differ from one another, The Eminent
Distinction ^f Divine Attributes.
only according to our weak apprehension; for our finite and compounded
understanding not being able to comprehend what is single and infinite, does
frame different conceits of the properties of God, according to the different
objects and effects of these Attributes. Now because our understanding does
ground all its conceits upon the several Objects and Effects of these
Attributes, Plures enim sunt conceptus objectivi virtualiter distincti qui
respondent pluribus conceptibus formalibus realiter distinctis. Conceptus autem
objectivi non sunt varii realiter, actu, in se, sed eminenter and virtualiter
in effectibus distincti.
we say, the Difference is not purely Rational, or a mere fiction of reason,
but we call it a virtual or eminent Distinction, framed by reason upon the
grounds aforesaid, for the help of our weak understandings. For we must
consider, that this Virtual Distinction is not a Perfectiones omnes creaturarum
quatenus sunt in Deo nihil aliud sunt, quam ipsamet creatrix Essentia Dei. Vide
August. lib. 4. Genesis ad lit. cap. 24. lib. 4. de Trinitate. Anselm. Monolog.
cap. 34. 35.
Real Distinction; because it does not import, that the Attributes of God are
actually many, or really different; but it signifies, that the infinite Essence
of God does eminently contain all real Perfections which are many indeed in the
Creatures; but all Perfection in God is but one single and infinite Perfection,
which single and infinite Perfection in regard of its Deus sola and sua
eminenti virtute omnes creatas perfectiones creaturis communicate, and quicquid
est perfectionis in creaturis eminen^er continet.
eminency, and our weakness cannot be expressed by one single Act, or by one
Formal and adaequate Conceit of ours, because we do apprehend things according
to those several Objects about which they are exercised, and those several
Effects which are by their Virtue and Influence really produced. Now Nullus
effectus est infinitus, and proinde nullus effectu^ est Divinae Virtuti
adaequatus.
no Effect in the world is adaequate to the infinite Virtue and eminent
Perfection of the Divine Nature, and therefore we cannot apprehend the eminent
and infinite Virtue of the Divine Nature, but by considering of those many
Objects and manifold Effects in the world, which do all represent the eminent
and infinite Virtue of the Divine Nature; and hence it is that we call it a
virtual and eminent Distinction, whereas indeed it is rather an Eminence
Em^nens and v^rtual^^ dist^nctio in ^e, non est distinctio sed eminentia; est
^amen respectu nostricon cipiendi virtutem eminentem secundum distinctos
respectus ad diversa obj^cta and effectus distinctos.
then a Distinction, because the Divine Nature does eminently contain all
Perfection in its infinite Perfection, and the Divine Virtue does manifest it
self upon diff^rent Objects and various Effects; and therefore our weak
understanding frames different concei^s of it according to those different
Objects and Effects, and consequently gives so many different Attributes to
God. And God has so far condescended to our weakness in Scripture, as to
declare his single Perfection by several names and Attributes, answerable to
those different Objects and Effects, in which the eminent and infinite Virtue
of God does gloriously shine throughout the world. I have insisted long upon
this virtual and eminent Distinction, that I might by so many several
expressions beat this grand Mystery into the heads of the meanest Christians.

7. When one Attribute of God is abstractly considered from the rest of the
Attributes, All the Attributes are included in every Attribute.
that Abstraction must be purely Praecisive, not Exclusive; I must not consider
Gods Justice alone, so as to exclude his mercy, or any other of the Divine
Attributes, from being comprehended within the single and undivided Perfection
of the Divine Essence. When the Justice of God is considered abstractly, and
the Abstraction is purely praecisive, Q^odlibet attributum divinum est
infinitum simpliciter in genere en^is, and proinde essen^iam divinam and
reliqua omnia Essentialia Attributa^ in sua Essentiali ratione includit. Vide
Caietan. de ente and essentia, cap. 6. quaest. 12. Communicable Attributes.
all the Attributes of God are at least implicitly included within the
abstract Consideration of Divine Justice; for Divine Justice is Essential
Justice, infinite Justice; God is just by his Essence, not by any Virtue, or
good quality; and he that is just by his Essence, is perfectly just,
infinitely just; you see that infinite Perfection is employed, and infinite
Perfection is Essentially all Perfection, and therefore all the other
Attributes of God are employed, when I do consider one single Attribute within
an Abstraction purely praecisive; for there is the same reason of all other
Attributes of God; because God is essentially good, wise, merciful, etc. as
well as just.

8. The Attributes which are called Communicable Attributes, are as truly the
single and undivided Essence of God, as those Attributes, which we call
incommunicable; for if we speak properly and strictly, no attribute of God can
be communicated to a Creature, any more then the Divine Essence it self, Isa.
42. 8. Matthew. 19. 17. 1. Tim. 1. 17. For all the Attributes of God are his
Name, his Perfection, his Glory, his Essence, his Godhead; and if any of the
Attributes were communicated, the Essence of God must be multiplied, divided,
or distracted from it self; The communicable Attributes are infinite, and there
cannot be more infinites then one, and therefore they must all signify one
single and infinite Perfection. For if any of the Attributal Perfections were
finite, then the Perfection of God would be made up of many Perfectio simplex
and infinita non est ex multis and finitis perfectionibus conflata.
finite Perfections; and God would not be Perfectiones quae sunt in creaturis
distinctae sunt in Deo simpliciter and unite; perfectio enim divina est
infinita, and proinde simplex and uniciss^ma.
infinitely perfect in himself, of himself, and by himself, but by some finite
Perfections superadded to his Essence, which is utterly repugnant to the single
and infinite Perfection of God. Yet true it is, that some Attributes of God are
said to be communicable by Quicquid est perfectionis in creaturis Deo
attribuitur, salva Analogia quae inter Deum and creaturam perfectissimam semper
intercedit. Perfectio creata ut sicnon est Formaliter in Deo seclusis
imperfectionibus creaturae; nam seclusa omni imperfectione non remanet Formalis
perfectio creaturae ut sic. Vide Suar. Metaph. Disp. 30.
Analogical Accommodation, not in respect of the properties themselves, which
are all infinite, but in respect of the Effects of those properties; there is
something in the Creature by the bounty of our Creator, and Grace of our
Redeemer, which does after a weak manner resemble the Perfection of God, and
therefore we are said to be partakers of the Divine Nature, 2. Pet. 1. 4. when
we bear the image of God in righteousness and holiness of truth. Nomen
Analogum nulla^ natural communem rebus Analogis significat.
For we are still to remember that God is to be known per viam eminentiae, when
we make an Eminent Distinction between one Divine Attribute and another, or
ascribe any of the Perfections which are found in the Creatures by way of
Attributal Perfection unto God. For In his quae non mole magna sunt idem est
majus esse, quo^ melius esse. Aug. Trinit. lib. 6. cap. 8.
God is not great in quantity, or good by a quality, but by his own infinite
Essence. We must remove all imperfection from God, that we may know him per
viam negationis; and therefore we say mercy and goodness are not Nulla
perfectio creata est in Deo Formaliter secundum adaequatam rationem quam habet
in creatura, sed eminenter tantum, quia imperfectio includitur in intrinseca
ratione and conceptu creaturae; S^pientia creat^ est accidens, Sapientia creata
est finita, and imperfecta. Perfectio itaque est in Deo Formaliter secundum
proprium conceptum Dei.
accidents in God, his understanding and his will are not faculties, his anger
and hatred are not passions, his many Attributes are but one single Perfection;
the Perfections which are in the Creature are imperfect, but the Perfection of
God is infinite. Finally we must consider God as the cause of all Perfection in
the Creature, that we may know him per Viam Causalitatis.

These grounds being laid, let us consider what great difference there does to
ou^ weak understanding appear to be between the Divine Attributes, whether they
be compared with the Divine Nature, or with one another, and yet that indeed
and truth there is no real difference between the Attributes and the Divine
Nature, or between the Divine Attributes themselves, and we shall more easily
conceive what great difference there is between the Father, Son and holy Ghost
without any Essential difference between them.

The holy Scriptures speaking to our weak capacity, describe God and his
Attributes after such a distinct manner to us, that we cannot but conceive,
that there is some ground even in the word of God for this virtual and
Distinctio non est Pura fed eminens, quia formatur and fundatur in verbo Dei
quod distinct de iis loquitur ad captum nostrum. D. Alting. Problem. part. 1.
Pr^b. 10. page 49. D. Voet. page de unica and simplicissima Dei Essentia. Vide.
Wallaeum. Gomarum.
eminent Distinction between the Attributes, as will-be most evident to any
that observe the usual phrase and language of the Scriptures in these and the
like places, Exodus 34. 6. 7. 1. Tim. 1. 17. Psalm. 103. 8. 9. 10. 1. Tim. 6. 15.
16. But it is as clear that God does herein graciously condescend to our
weakness, because we know that the Divine Nature is ^^ngle, and infinite, and
therefore does con^ain in it all Actual Perfection eminently, and all Deus est
ex seipso Ens essentialiter sum perfectum and proinde ess^n^ia divina
includi^omnem possibilem per^ectionem; nam perfectiones illae, quae sunt in
Deotant^m eminenter prout in ipso, sunt Formalissime de conceptu Essentiali
Dei. Vide Suarez. Met. Disp. 30. Sect. 6. ^dcir^o ne quae^amus qui sit, cu^ sit
omnia, and super omnia, and p^aeter ^mnia, (...). Vide Iul. ^ calig. Exercitat.
365. p. 2. de D^o.
possible Perfection both singly and ^ctually, because all true and pure
Perfection is most Formally included in the Nature and Essence of God; and
therefore this eminent Distinction grounded on the Phrase of Scripture, and
upon visible Ob^ects and Effects, gives us no ground at all ^o conceive, that
the Divine Nature is not one single infinite perfection, because the Scripture
speaks distinctly of God, and of his several Attributes, only to teach us to
apprehend the impartible perfection of God by degrees rather then parts,
because we cannot apprehend it altogether. Our conceits of God are inadaequate,
and collected by way of Analogy from the perfection of the creatures; but we
must consider that what the creatures do perform by many and distinct
qualities and acts, God does perform by his own Essence which is one most
single* and most pure act. And therefore we conclude that this distinction is
not really grounded upon God himself, upon his Nature, or Essence, but upon the
Effects of God. The objective conceits or things conceived, are not really or
actually different in themselves, but virtually and ^minently in the several
Effects, Egresses, Terminations of Gods eminent virtue, and single power, which
is every way boundless and infinite, and therefore never works according to
its full and adaequate virtue. The Hanc distinctione^ vocant rationis
ratiocinatae virtualem aut Emin^ntem. Nonnulli autem distinctione^ appellant ex
Natura Rei Formalem, non Actu, sed virtute, aut Eminenter. Vide sis Rhadam
Controvers. inter Thomam and Scotum part. 1. Contro. 4.
Scotists do indeed seem to say more, because they say that this distinction
of the Attributes is Formal and ex natura Rei; but then they come off again
in their explication of these terms, and say that their meaning is that they
are distinguished Formally, not Actually, but Virtually and Eminently, and
therefore we mean the same thing. For the divine Essence is not only a single
Quicquid in Deo est essentiale unum est: a prima autem unitate omnis
differentia, omnisque numerus abesse debet*
Unity, but the first Unity, which is incapable of any difference or number
whatsoever; only we cannot by a Pluribus conceptibus Formalibus inadae quatis
realiter destinctis unam eandemque essentiam simplicissimam divisim vel potius
gradatim concipimus. Conceptus autem ejusmodi Analogice desumimus a rebus
creatis, quae per multas distinctasque qualitates praestant ea, quae essentia
divina per se.
single act comprehend Gods single perfection, because our understanding is
finite, and his perfection is infinite.

But it will be said that the Attributes of God have to our apprehension not
only different, but contrary effects: the Justice of God does punish, and the
mercy of God does spare.

The answer is easy: The justice of God is not contrary to the mercy of God.
the Effects are to our apprehension contrary, nay they are contrary in
themselves, but the Attributes are not contrary; for the Attributes do both
belong to the same God, nay they are the same God; and these Attributes do not
overthrow, but preserve one another. Now we readily grant that the Effects are
really different, nay contrary; but we deny that the Attributes of Justice and
Mercy are really different, or contrary in themselves.

Finally, we grant, that according to our manner of apprehension, it is very
improper to say that the Attribute of Gods mercy is the Attribute of his
Punitive Justice, because the terms are here taken in Istae propositiones
falsae sunt in sensu Formali quae significant aliquid Deo convenire secundum
eam rationem secundum quam vere non convenit; ex. gr. misericordia divina
punit, justitia divina miseretur: attributum Justitiae punitivae est attributum
misericordiae: intelligere est velle: voluntas intelligit: intellectus vult,
voluntas est intellectus. Verae autem sunt istae proposi^iones in sensu
Identico acceptae, quia essentia divina est simplicissima, and proinde res illa
quae est voluntas intelligit; res illa quae est misericordia punit. Vide D.
Vo^tium. Select. Disput. p. 1. de unica and simplicissima Dei essentia.
sensu formali, as we use to speak, and therefore that manner of predication is
improper; yet if you take the terms in sensu identico, the thing is true,
because Mercy and Justice are the same thing, the same Essence. We may say that
the same God, the same Essence, which is mercy it self, does punish; but it is
very improper and absurd to say that God does forgive by his punitive Justice,
because God who speaks distinctly of his own: Attributes in his word, that he
might help our weak understanding, will not give us leave to speak so
confusedly of his glorious Attributes, as to puzzle the understanding of our
weak brethren.

What I have said concerning the Justice and Mercy of God, might Consideratis
considerandis, be applied to his other Attributes; and I might discourse in
like manner concerning the understanding and will of God, concerning the Acts
and Decrees of God, and enquire whether they are distinct from the Essence of
God? that so we may the better understand the distinction which is between the
Divine Subsistences and the Divine Essence, by comparing the Divine Attributes,
Acts, Decrees, Subsistences and Essence altogether; but I shall be brief in
that.

IX. The Decrees of God, The Decrees of God.
which we, according to our weak apprehension, are apt to conceive as many, are
but one single and Deus in seipso semper agit intellectu and voluntate ut purus
Actus.
pure Act in God; nay, to speak strictly, they are nothing else but De
actionibus Dei quas Decreta vocamus rotunde dicimus, Decreta Dei secundum
perfectionem quam dicunt in Deo esse necessaria, aeterna and essentialia.
Decreta autem quoad speciem, terminationem and extensionem ad externa esse
libera, nec deo estentialia esse, nec ipsum Deum. Voluntas enim divina libere
terminatur ad creaturas sine ulla sui mutatione, vel reali additione; accedit
autem externa quaedam denominatio, and respectus rationis ex part Dei in ipso
decreto jam libere terminato fundatus, ex part creaturae in ipsa futuritione
seu existentia illius.
God himself decreeing; for the Divine Essence is one pure and single Act. In
Deo non distinguuntur Esse Posse and Operari, The Decrees and Acts of God, his
knowing, willing, etc. are not many in their own Absolute nature, for they are
the Nature of God considered as a pure and Vital Act; and hence it is that we
say the Decrees of God (in their Absolute Nature, or as they are considered
with reference to Gods own uncreated truth and goodness) are all Essential
and Necessary, they did not begin to be, they cannot cease to be; God did not
begin to know or love himself, he cannot cease to know his own Almighty
power, or to love his own uncreated goodness.

The Decrees of God upon this account, and in this consideration, are not
capable of Voluntas and volitio divina una est and simplex; nec multiplicitate^
aut divisionem and distractionem, nedum oppositionem, nec prius and posterius
aut successionem, nec dependentiam causalitatis and effectus aut cujuscunque
alterius ordinis admittens; haec autem omnia rebus volitis competere possunt;
res autem volitae a voluntate and volitione divine realissime and infinite
distinguuntur; de rebus enim externis libere volitis loquimur. Vide Maccovium
Miscell. qu. Disp. 17. 20. 23, 24, 25, 26. Voetium. ubi supra.
multipicity, or division, opposition or succession, dependence or order. For
here is nothing but one pure, vital, eternal, unchangable Act, which is God
himself, knowing and loving of himself for himself. Take it all thus in
brief, in a few short conclusions.

Pure Act, The Acts of God.
and therefore he cannot but Actus divini considerati secundum id sunt, quod
nil differu^t ab essentia divina, and proinde nulla est in illis vel mutatio,
vel libertas, sed summa necessitas. Sicut enim Deus non potest non esse, sic
neque potest non velle, non intelligere. Imo actus divini considerati secundum
respectum quem dicunt ad objectum Primum ac principale, ad ipsissimam nimirum
Dei essentiam, sunt etiam necessarii; quia Deus non potest non essentiam suam
scire, and tanquam summum bonum amare.
Act vitally; Vital acts considered with out reference to any object.
he must needs understand, and will; here is no such Liberty or Mutability as
Vorstius dreamt of, opposed to unchangable necessity; for as God cannot cease
to be because he is the first, necessary and Independent Being, and his
necessity of being speaks his infinite perfection: so he cannot cease to Act,
because he is a pure Act; he must needs act vitally, who is life it self; he
must needs know and will because he is the best life, and purest Act; and this
necessity speaks his purity and perfection also.

Vital Acts considered with reference to Gods Essence.
they cannot be distinguished, because Gods Essence is a Pure Vita divina est
intellectu, voluntate, and potentia actuosa. Deus novit seipsu^ ut primum and
infinitu^ objectum, amat seipsum necessario, necessitate naturae, sed absque
coactione, quia non potest nolle gloriam suam, aut seipsum negare.
Act. The self-same divine Essence is both the Act, and Object in these
immanent Actions, which do not pass out of God toward, and therefore have no
relation at all to, or denomination from, any Actus immanentes nullum dicunt
respectum ad, quia non transeunt in objectum externum.
external, Object. God does know and will all things within himself naturally,
and necessarily; it is his nature to love himself; here is no distinction
imaginable.

3. Personal Acts (such as the begetting Personal Acts.
and breathing forth of the Spirit) are not arbitrary, but necessary and
natural Acts, and therefore aeternal; now acts that are absolutely necessary
Actus Personales sunt aeterni, and proinde horu^ est absoluta necessitas absque
potentia ad oppositum.
sine potentia ad oppositum, as we use to say, being natural and aeternal, are
nothing else but God acting in, and by some one or more of the three Divine
Subsistences. Nothing that is eternal can be out of God, and there is nothing
in God that is not God, and therefore I need say no more of those Personal Acts
in this place, because I am to treat of them at large in the very next Chapter.

4. The Intrinsecal Acts of God which out of the Godhead, Intrinsecal Acts
considered with reference to extrinsecal Objects.
are the will of God, or the Essence of God considered after the manner of an
Act of his will, Esentia ex se actuosa (as the Schools speak) concepta per
modum actus volendi. If this Act be considered in it self, it is nothing else
but the will or Essence of God, because it is an intrinsecal Actus intrinseci
in Deo connotantes respectum ad extra sunt ipsa Essentia Dei concepta per modum
actus, sed relativi, and quidem ad extra. Omnia enim novit Deus quae sunt extra
se, substantias, and accidentia. Genesis 1. 31. Universalia, and singularia, Psalm.
33. 13 14. Job c. 1 and cap. 2. Magna and parva. Matthew. 6. 25. bona and mala.
Psalm. 33. 15. Genes. 6. 5. interna and externa. Matthew. 6. 4. praeterita. Isa.
38. 3. futura. Isa. 41. 23. praesentia: possibilia denique 1. Sam. 23. 11. and
impossibilia. Tit. 1. 2. Omnia etiam libere vult extra se, quaecunque nimirum
statuit vel permittere vel producere; non enim quicquid potest facit.
and vital Act. But now if this Act be considered as Relative, and as related
to some thing that is out of God; we say this Act is not necessary, but free in
respect of all those things which God decrees to produce or permit in the
World; for God does Arbitrarily decree to permit or produce this, and not that,
according to the Counsel of his own will, it being as truly and fully in his
power to permit or produce that, as this: both were alike possible, but this is
made future, and will in the fulness of time be present in Act by virtue of
the free decree of God; for all Creatures are produced and do exist by the will
of God. It is most evident that the will of God is the same whether it act upon
himself or something that is out of the Godhead.

Extrinsecal Relations.
and the Creature, whether in futurition, or existence, is extrinsecal.

6. The Denominations grounded upon Extrinsecal Denominations.
or relation of the will of God toward the Creatures, is extrinsecal also.

7. These Actions of God which are Extrinsecal Actions.
then in Actus excrinseci s^nt a Deo effective, non sunt in Deo Subjective^
God, as to create, govern, redeem or the like, are called extrinsecal, and
therefore the Denomination of God from them must needs be extrinsecal.

8. We have no ground to conceive that The single Essence.
Relations, or Denominations.

9. Though the Objects which God does Necessity and Liberty.
and their production is successive, yet the will of God is the self same, and
is one single and pure Act: the Power of willing and the Act of willing are not
distinct in God; nay God does will his own happiness necessarily, and the
happiness of men and Angels freely by the same will; (...) natural and (...)
liberum no^ constituu^t diversas potentias in Deo.
necessity and liberty do not make distinct Powers or wills in God.

10. There is no Potentia Executiva in No Potentia Executiva in God.
and therefore all those conceits of Vorstius concerning any Change or
Composition in God by several Acts or decrees are but mere dreams, and vain
conceits, though they be now published to the World, not with less blasphemic
then impudence in this licentious age.

It is evident by what has been said that the eminent Virtue of God
(notwithstanding its several Objects, Egresses, Terminations, Relations,
Denominations and Effects) is one single and infinite Perfection. This will be
the constant result and Conclusion of all sober debates, and Christian
discussions. For if the Perfection of God be not single, then it must be
compounded: but it cannot be compounded either of things that are finite, or of
things that are infinite; the Perfection of God cannot be compounded of finite
things, because it is infinite; for many nay all finite things cannot make up
one infinite; and God cannot be compounded of many infinite things, because
there can be but one thing that's infinite, and that is God. And therefore since
Gods Perfection is his Essence, and his Essence is single, uncompounded,
undivided, indivisible, it must needs follow that whatsoever is in God, is God,
and God is (as has been often shown) one single infinite Perfection. This is
our first Principle, and last Conclusion into which all our debates, and by
which all our doubts about this Argument may and ought to be resolved.

X. The Distinction between the Divine Nature and Persons may be considered,
The Distinction between the Divine Nature and Persons.


1. In respect of predication; the Divine Essence is predicated of every
Person, because every one of the three Subsistences is God, nay is the Divine
Nature considered with this or that Personal Propriety and Relation
respectively. But one Person is not predicated of another, the Father is not
the Son, nor is the Son the Father, or the holy Ghost.

2. In respect of Communication, the Divine Nature is not only communicable
but communicated to all three Persons; but it is of the Formal Reason of a
Person to be incommunicable.

3. In respect of Relation. The Divine Nature does indeed eminently contain
all absolute and relative Perfection; but the Formal Distinctio in Deo nascitur
ex relationibus pr opriis sive personalibus quales sunt paternitas, filiatio,
spiratio, processio; quaedam enim relationes sunt omnibus personis communes
quales sunt Identitas fundata super Vnitatem Essentiae, similitudo fundata
super Vnitatem Attributorum, and aequalitas fundata super unitatem magnitudinis.
Relations whereby the Persons are not only distinguished from, but opposed to
one another, cannot be Essential under that consideration, because they are
peculiar to the several Persons, and not common to all three Persons, as the
Essence and Nature is. Peculiar and distinctive Relations are not essential,
because the Persons who are relatively distinguished, are not essentially
distinguished. The Divine Nature of the Father is Essentia and paternitas
virtute and eminenter Formalem distinctionem continent, quia ita se habent ac
si Formaliter distinguerentur.
not his Father-hood: for if it were, then every one of the three Persons would
be God the Father, all three Persons would be one Person, which is a manifest
Contradiction.

4. In respect of Generation and Procession; the Divine Essence does not beget,
nor is it be gotten, it does not proceed; and yet the Father does beget, the
Son is begotten, and the holy Ghost does proceed; the Person of Christ is
begotten, but his Divine Nature unbegotten.

5, In respect of number; the Persons are three, the Divine Nature most simply
single, and singularly one.

6. In respect of Order; there is an Order to be observed amongst the Divine
Persons; the Father is the first Personal Principle, the Son the second, and
the holy Ghost who is breathed forth by the Father, and the Son, is the third;
the Scripture says there are three, and does commonly reckon them in that
Order; and we have no ground to reckon the holy Ghost before the Son because he
proceeds from the Son; but the Divine Nature being a single Unity, and the
first Unity, is as incapable of Order as it is of Number.

XI. Notwithstanding all these and some other distinct Considerations, I shall
be bold to make this Peremptory Determination; The three Divine Subsistences
are not really distinguished from the Divine Nature, or Essence. The Scripture
says, Christ and his Father are Ego and Paterun^^ sumus nempe ^ssentia,
Potentia and Gloria. Ergo Christus dedu^it fidem nostram ad hoc fundamentum,
^mirum ut ipse sit unus cum Patre Deus -- necesle habemus ut videamus in
Christo Deitatem, in facie ejus personam Patris, cum sit Character Personae
ipsius; in facie ejus gloriam Dei, cum sit splendour gloriae ipsius: in manu
ipsius manum and potentiam Patris; denique in illo ^otam Dei Patris majestatem.
Rolloc. in Ioh. 10. 30.
one, Ioh. 10. 30. and that all three are one, 1. John 5. 7. Essentially one,
and therefore really one. I have said enough above to prove all three Persons
to be essentially one. The three Persons are one God subsisting with all
possible Perfection, Relative as well Absolute in one pure Act ex part Rei.
The three Divine Persons do not differ from the Divine Nature, as an humane
Person does from the humane Nature singularly considered: for a singular humane
Nature may be separated from an humane Person as is evident in the Incarnation
of our Lord and Savior. But the Divine Nature cannot subsist in alieno
supposito; the Nature of God cannot subsist in any other or any fewer then
these three Persons, who are one and the same God; And therefore the Divine
Nature does not differ really from the Persons, tanquam res a re, as we say,
nor tanquam res a modo separabili; they do not differ really either way; nor do
the Persons differ really, that is realiter separabiliter from one another, as
shall be proved, when we come to speak of the Distinction of the Divine Persons
in the next Chapter.

XII. The Distinction between the Divine Nature and three Divine Subsistences
is not a groundless Conceit or a mere fiction of reason, because it is
grounded on the Credimus tres esse H^postases nobis in Scriptura significatas
per nomina quae relationem significant. Non est enim Pater nisi Filii, nec
Filius nisi Patris, nec Spiritus nisi Spirantis. Itaque relationes quidem ipsas
habemus in divinis literis. Chami^r. de Canon^ lib. 9. cap. 10.
Word of God. For our apprehension of God must be agreeable to that Divine
Revelation, which God has vouchsafed us of himself in Scripture. Now it is
most clear and evident, by what has been said in this whole Discourse, that
the holy Scriptures teach us to conceive distinctly of some things in God,
which are not really distinguished in him. And therefore Mr. Fry may do well to
consider, and retract that rash Censure which he passes upon this Doctrine of
God, when he says that the Doctrine of three distinct Persons or Subsistences
in the Godhead is a chaffie, gross, Carnal and absurd Opinion, in the Title
and 22. page of his blasphemous book; For this distinction is not only
grounded on a Haec distinctio habet fundamentum non tantum in effect is aut
phraseologia Scripturae, quia fuit ab aeterno. Nam ab aeterno Essentia fuit non
tantum Communicabilis sed Communicata, persona autem incommunicabilis; persona
filii, genita, essentia ingenita.
Phrase of Scripture, but is eternal.

XIII. The Distinction between the Divine Nature and Persons is an Eminent
distinction; I have told you above, what we mean by that expression. The
Persons are the Essence of God, and not any thing separated or divided from it;
every one of the three Persons is a Person of the Godhead, nay every one of the
three Persons is the Godhead considered with some particular property and
relation; and the Godhead being absolutely single, we must conclude that the
Divine Nature and a Divine Person is the same Essential Real thing, though
they are Eminently distinguished by sundry considerations, as has been shown.

But it is objected that every one of the three Persons is a Substance, The
grand objection.
and if there be three substances subsisting in the Godhead under sundry Formal
considerations, then there will be three Divine Substances, three Substantial
Relations and Properties, and therefore the Godhead will be compounded by these
three Substances, substantial properties and relations, or else there will be
three substantial and formal Gods.

To this grand objection, I make these few returns by way of answer.

1. Every one of the three Persons is a Substance, a Divine Substance, The
Answer.
but they are the same Divine Substance, because they are the same God: these
three are one, they are unum, one divine substance, one God; they are all three
divine Persons, but they are Coessentiall Persons, and (...).
Inessentiall persons of the same Godhead.

The peculiar relations do distinguish, but they do not compound, Peculiar
Relations do destinguish, but not compound.
for they do not super add any new Entity, much less any new Godhead, because
all these relations are Natural, eternal, and therefore they are God; Absolute
and Relative perfection in God, are but one single perfection.

1. The parts or extremes wherewith any thing is compounded must be really,
Compositio described by its several requisites.
or at least Modally and Separably distinct; for all created Natures and
Persons being compounded, are not only Modally, but separably distinct.

2. The parts compounding must be united by some Quae actuex natura rei
distinguuntur, non possunt inter se uniri nisi per actionem causae efficientis:
nulla autem causa essiciens prior Deo est; ergo.
efficient cause, and one of the parts must be a mere power or passive
potentiality, that is capable of farther perfection; and the other an Act to
make that power Essentia in creatis est divisibilis and perfectibilis; persona
enim creata actuat et perficit essentiam perfectibilem; personalitates autem
increatae non sunt actus naturae divinae ut sic and praecise consideratae eam
perficientes vel informantes.
perfect and complete.

3. There must be by virtue of this union and perfection some dependence,
multiplicity and change. Now it is clear that the nature of God in which the
persons subsist is not capable of these imperfections; for,

1. There are no compounding parts in God.

2. The persons are not made one person by their Inessentiali subsistence, but
remain three distinct Persons.

3. The Persons are not separably distinct from the divine nature, or from one
another.

4. The Persons do not Essentia in creatis est imperfectae actualitatis and
proinde perfectibilis. Essentia autem divina non habet se ad modum potentiae
perfectibilis, nec persona divina ad modum actus naturam divinam infinitam
simplicissimam perficientis. Ratio quidditativa, and ratio Relativa in Deo
tanquam diversae rations Formales a nobis concipiuntur, sed ambae illae
rations Formales sunt in Deo secundum ultim^m unitatem and actualitatem
propriam. Nihil enim perficit essentiam divinam in actu quidditativo praeter
ipsissimam essentiam; nihil perficit personam in esse Personali praeter
propriam Subsistentiam, nihil perficit personam in esse Relativo praeter
propriam relationem: Pater per ipsam paternitatem perficitur in esse Relativo.
perfect the divine nature, for it is infinitely perfect of it self, and the
three Persons are by virtue of the same divine Essence Essentially the same
God, and really one, as has been laid. The divine nature is not like a created
nature, which is (imperfectae actualitatis as we say) so imperfectly actuated,
as that it is capable of farther perfection; for the divine nature has no
weak, imperfect, defective, Passive Potentiality in it, and therefore cannot be
contracted, determined, actuated by any personal properties or relations. If
God be Essentially considered, he has a singular existence of himself by his
own Essence, and has most perfect unity and quidditative or Essential
Actuality, because his Essence is the most perfect Essence that is, or can be.
If God be Persosonally considered, he has the most perfect personality that
is, or can be, and every person has a perfect, proper and peculiar
subsistence, which is not capable of any farther perfection in Esse Personali.
Every person is complete in Esse quidditativo per essentiam, in esse Personali
per propriam subsistentiam. I need say no more on that Argument, because I have
upon several occasions said so much already.

III. The Essence of God is not multiplied by sundry considerations of the same
Essence.

IV. The three Formal considerations are not In Deo est essentia and tres
relationes, sed non sunt tres essentiae relativae. Propri^ta. tes personales
praecise and formaliter sumptae non uniuntur inter se, and in se: nam unio in
and cum essentia est in aliquo tertio.
Essential, but Personal considerations, and we grant that there are three
Formal Persons in, and of the Godhead; but it will not follow from thence that
there are three Gods, for these three Persons are one God.

V. A. divine Person may be presented to our most serious thoughts under a
threefold consideration, as learned Vide Junium contra Bellarminum, Controv.
2. lib. 1. Praefat. Ut res planior sit, id praemittendum est personae
considerandae triplicem rationem esse; Communem in essentia qua Deus est:
Singularem Absolutam in Persona qua subsistit in unitate Essentiae; and
Relativam in distinctione and ordine personae unius ad alteram.
Iunius observes.

1. The first consideration of a Person is Common or Essential, because the
same divine Essence is common to all three Persons; when a Person then is
considered as God, we call this an Essential or Common consideration, because
the persons are Ratione Communis Deitatis and communium essentialiumque
attributorum, nulla distinctio cogitari debet, sed tantum ratione Personae and
proprietatum personalium.
no way distinguished under this first consideration, but are one thing, the
choycest and chiefest of things, and are one with the most single and singular
kind of unity: Father, Son and spirit are one Jehovah, one God and the same God.

2. The second consideration is Personal, and yet Essentia notat naturam
divinam cum proprietatibus communibus: Persona notat naturam divinam cum
proprietati bus did inctivis, sive istae proprietates sint Absolutae, sive
sint Relativae; habere subsistentiam a see quid Absolutu^: (...) est quid
Positivum Nomen autem Personae, nomen Relativum communiter dicitur
originationis aut originis respectum includens, quo Pers^na divina a se, vel ab
alia subsistentiam habere significatur. Habere autem subsistentiam a se,
quantum m^hi videtur non dicit respectum ad aliud, vel alium.
Absolute, whereby the person is considered as subsisting in the Unity of the
divine Essence. This consideration is more singular, because every person has
its proper and peculiar subsistence; for the Father does subsist of himself,
but the Son has subsistence from his Father; Now the selfsubsistence of the
Father is proper, peculiar, personal, that is, proper and peculiar to his
person, and yet this self-subsistence is Absosolute, for his self-subsistence
is not his Fatherhood, and therefore it cannot be esteemed Relative. But though
this consideration is more singular, because every person has his peculiar
subsistence, yet herein all three persons agree, that they do all three subsist
in the unity of the same Godhead, though every person has his proper
subsistence, and his peculiar way of subsisting; here are indeed three
subsistences under this consideration, and yet but one divine Substance,
Essence, Nature, Godhead, because all three do subsist in the Tres sunt in
eadem natura divina indivisa Coexistentia Coessentialiter subsistentes; tres
enim personae inconfuse uniuntur and indivise discernuntur.
Unity of the same Godhead; for we must still keep our eye fixed upon that
Text, These three are one.

3. The third Consideration is Relative in the order of one person to, and
distinction of one Person from another. Est aliquid in persona Ab solutum quod
est Proprium, est aliquid in Deo relativum quod est Commune. Identitas,
similitudo, aequalitas, mutua praesentia personarum inter se propter inconfusam
in se mutuo comprehensionem, sunt relationes ad intra omnibus personis
communes; relationes aute^ distinctivae sunt propriae.
This distinction of persons is to be handled at large in the next chapter; our
point in question here in this chapter does not concern the distinction of one
person from another, but the distinction of all three persons from the divine
Nature.

Now, they who speak most largely of the distinction between the persons, and
say it is in some sense a Omnis distinctio essentialis est realis, sed omnis
distinctio realis non est essentialis. D. Voetius.
Real distinction, do yet confess that the real distinction which they treat
of is not Personae divinae non differunt realiter essentialiter, nec realiter
separabiliter, sed proprietatibus realibus personalibus; tales autem sunt istae
reales proprietates quae essentiae divinae non superaddunt novam entitatem.
Vide D. Alting. Problem. X.
Essential, and therefore still here is an Essential union of the three
persons under all these three Considerations. We do still make much of that
Text, and hold it fast for our direction and support, 1 John 5. 7.

VI. This Argument will be best answered by showing the vast difference between
created and uncreated persons, and I have with a great deal of patience waded
through all these perplex disputes, that I might make way for the clearing of
this grand Mystery, and glad I am that I am now got within sight of it, though
I have had as hard a passage as Hanibal had over or through the Alps, and yet
I have made my

II. Concerning the difference between created and uncreated persons, The
difference between created and uncreated Persons.
we may observe that

1. All created persons have a finite and dependent Nature.

2. They have a Compounded Nature.

3. They have a different Nature. 7. Observations concerning created Persons.


4. They have a different understanding, will, power.

5. They have a different place and presence.

6. They have different Accidents, and are distinguished by an heap of
Accidents.

7. Humane Persons with whom we are best acquainted, may differ in time also;
one humane person may subsist a long time after another is dissolved.

Having laid down these Positions, let us now make the comparison, and observe
the difference between created and uncreated persons.

1. All created persons have a finite and dependent Nature, 1. The infinite
Nature of uncreated Persons.
but the nature of all uncreated persons is Independent and Infinite; this one
difference is an infinite difference, The difference between created and
uncreated Persons is Infinite.
and surely if there were no other difference, that wonld suffice to discover
and overthrow all the Arguments of Socinians and Familists. I do often admire
that the acute Socinians who pretend to be wholly ruled by reason, should have
no more reason in them then to argue after this absurd manner. Three humane
persons are thus and thus distinguished, Ergo if there be three divine persons,
they must be thus and thus distinguished also, even just as humane persons are.
Is not this a gross fallacy Vide Nazian, orat. de Spiritu Sancto. Damasc.
orthod. sid. lib. 3. c. 5. Athanas. Dialog. de Trinitate and in Mat. 11.
Nazian. orat de pace Orat. 37, and 51.
, because of the imparity and infinite Absurdum est personas coessentiales and
infinitas ad creatarum quae finitae and diversae essentiae sunt modulum
redigere.
inaequality? if the divine persons must be called into question, let them be
tried by their Peers. They say they cannot comprehend this Mystery; I say the
reason is because it is a Mystery; and if they cannot comprehend it, they may
the better believe it to be incomprehensible. The single Nature of these three
persons is infinite, and if men wonder that they cannot comprehend what is
infinite, it is because they do not consider that they themselves are finite.

2. The nature of these three glorious subsistences is Independent; the nature
of all created subsistences is dependent Natura creata est depende^s; persona
creata est Independens, quia non est in alio per dependentiam ab illo tanquam
sustentante.
, and therefore it is no wonder if a dependent nature do subsist in its proper
person, and depend upon its proper person for sustentation; but the divine
Nature does not depend upon the three subsistences for its sustentation or
subsistence; but all three persons do subsist in this Independent and infinite
Nature. Philip. 2. 6. subsisting in the Nature of God; so the Scripture
expresses it, and we must apprehend and believe these holy Mysteries according
to the holy Scriptures, because no man has seen God, and God is the only
all-sufficient Witness concerning his own essence and subsistence, concerning
himself; and therefore we must not think or speak otherwise of God then
according to the Scriptures of truth, in which God has sufficiently and
graciously revealed himself, John 1. 18. Matthew. 16. 17. Matthew. 11. 26, 27. The
Scriptures direct us how to distinguish uncreated persons from created persons.
Our finite and dependent Nature does subsist in a created person, but uncreated
persons do subsist in an Infinite and Independent Nature; there is a manifest
difference. Our nature indeed does subsist in the divine and uncreated person
of the Son of God, but that is not according to the common course of nature,
there is a peculiar reason and another Mystery in that wonderful subsistence;
And yet even in that wonderful Mystery our dependent Nature does subsist in a
person, Cum humanitas Christi consequuta fuerit personalitatem propria infinite
perfectiorem, nonest cur propriam personal^tatem amplius appeteret. Si enim
adhuc inclinaretur ad propriam perso^alitatem, vi quadam detineretur in verbo,
and ita status illius esset violentus, and quasi contra naturam. Cajetanus.
which notes its dependence; and our Nature is more satisfied and quieted by
subsistence in a divine, then in an humane person, because it has a more
glorious sustentation, and is more powerfully upheld by that divine and
uncreated person. The divine person of Christ does subsist in his divine
Nature, and the humane Nature of Christ does subsist in his divine and only
person.

III. All created persons have a compounded and divisible nature, The third
difference.
but uncreated persons have a single undivided and indivisible nature. The
Socinians, Arminians and Vorstians of this age do not love to hear any
discourse of the single Nature of God, in Father, Son and Holy Ghost; this
Doctrine, they say, is Philosophical, Scholastical, Metaphysical, and therefore
there is nothing which concerns Faith, Piety, or manners in it.

But it is most clear and evident that all the glorious Attributes of God are
united by an Eternal bond which cannot be dissolved, and we have invincibly
proved, that they do all signify but one single and infinite perfection. If
you take away the singleness of Gods being, you take away his Incommunicable,
unchangable, incomprehensible, independent and infinite perfection. This point
is excellently discussed and opened by (...). Damascen. Orth fid. lib. 1. c. 4.
Damaseene. Composition (says he) does beget strife, strife may well cause a
separation, and separation dissolution, which all who know any thing of God,
will acknowledge to be repugnant to the perfection of the Godhead. The learned

spiritual nature out of their Catechism, that they may more securely deny the
Coessentiall Trinunity of Father, Son and Holy Ghost; and therefore I do insist
upon this difference between created and uncreated persons, because if the

nature be overthrown; All the Eglisem. contra Vorstium.

first matter of last difference and the like; nor such a singleness as is in
Angels, or the souls of men, for theirs is but a Comparative singleness, there
is some kind of composition even in the most glorious Angels. God is not
compounded of a Nature, Non de^emus proprietates Dei ab essentia ejus vel
cogitatione scpara^e, quia in essentiae forma and vir^ute omnes continentur,
and Deus sine proprietatibus ejus cogita^i non potest. D. Wallaeus de Deo. page
127.
Atrributes, and Relations, as has been shown, nor is any of the Divine
Persons compounded; nor can the Godhead be said to be compounded of three
Persons; for though the Persons be distinguished, they do not compound, nor can
they be compounded. Distinction connotes perfection, because it is opposite to
confusion: but Composition denotes multiplicity and imperfection; we must then
consider that

1. The Essence of God is most Essentia divina non est i^ poten^ia, quia est
paras actus, non est perfectibilis, quia omnes perfectiones complectitur.
perfect, and therefore nothing can be added to it to make it more perfect,
because it is infinitely perfect.

2. Whatsoever is compounded may be dissolved into the parts whereof it is
compounded; The Godhead cannot be dissolved, because it cannot be changed.

3. Whatsoever is compounded, must needs be dependent both in being and in
working. But God is Deus non depender a subjecto a ^a ^sis vel internis, vel
externis, a principio quocunque priori aut superieri.
Independent. Ergo.

4. The parts compounding are Essentia divina non est in se composita, nec
aliquid ipsi componibile, nec ipsa alicui componibili. Essentia aeterna nec
s^ipsa nec ulla realia posterior esse potest.
before the whole that is compounded; but God is the Former of all things, and
therefore nothing can be before God. The divine Essence cannot be later then it
self, or later then any thing else, because it is the first and eternal being.

Now if neither of the Nature or Attributes Proprietates De^ non minus (...)
sunt quam ejus essentia^ (...) non essent ipsissima Dei essentia sim^l (...)
Joh, 5. 26. est vita; Joh. 11. 25.
of these uncreated persons, nor the persons themselves be compounded, nor God
compounded of the Nature and Persons; here is another very great difference
between created and uncreated persons, who have life, and are life it self,
because they are one single perfection.

Three created persons have three different Natures, The fourth difference.
but these Unius personae in creatae tota est essentia divina, sed non solius.
three uncreated Persons have the self same most single and singular nature.
Three created persons may have the same specifical nature, but they have not
the same singular nature; created persons in respect of their specificall
nature which is universal, are (...) of like nature, but in respect of their
singular nature they are (...). But now these uncreated persons are (...) in
respect of their Singula sunt in singulis, and omnia in singulis, and singula

una, quia tota est in singulis. August. ubi supra.
singular Essence: Look how many Tot sunt sustantiae singulares quot personae
creatae.
created persons there be of the same species, so many singular substances
there are of that species. For, a Essentia creata est finita, circumscripta,
imperfecta, divisibilis, perfectibilis: per differentiam enim individualem sive
personalem contrahitur, perficitur. Essentia partibilis per parts and
separatim inest singulis individuis Angelicis and humanis. Essentia autem
divina est perfecta infinita simplex, and proinde eadem etiam numero and
individuo (quod aiunt) tribus personis communis citra omnem multiplicationem,
divisionem aut separationem; eadem quippe natura singularis est tota in
singulis personis divinis.
finite nature cannot be communicated to several proper persons of the same
species without a multiplication of singular natures or substances, because
every finite nature is imperfect and divisible. The humane nature is
communicated to Paul, Peter and John: Now these three persons are three men,
for they have three distinct singular natures, though they have one universal
nature; and no wonder, for their nature is imperfect and divisible; their
universal nature is unum multiplicabile. But the nature which is common to
these three divine Persons is not universal but singular; it is unum
immultiplicabile, because the divine nature is infinite, and that which is
infinite cannot be multiplied; the unity of the divine nature is real Unitas
specifica non est rei sed rationis extra men tem enim nostram non est unitas
naturae humanae in personis diversis sed pluralitas. Unitas autem essentiae
divinae est realis, and singularissima, quia ita Deus est unus ut etiam sit
solus, and ita solus ut non possit esse alius.
and most perfectly singular. The same singular nature, the whole nature being
of bound less perfection is really and eternally communicated to all three
persons without any division of the nature, separation of the persons or
composition of nature and persons: the persons are distinguished, but not
separated; and if we speak properly and strictly, the divine Persona
multiplicatur and proinde distinguitur; essentia autem divina nec distinguitur,
nec multiplicatur.
Nature, as it is common to all three persons, is neither distinguished nor
multiplied; for the nature is not distinguished from Unitas ad essentiam
proprie pertinet, distinctio autem personarum non ad essentiam proprie and per
se, sed ad rationem in essentia respicit. Iunius contra error. Samosat.
it self, nor are the persons distinguished from one another by the Nature, or
natural properties, but by personal properties, Essential Attributes are
common but Personal Attributes are Incommunicable.
which are not naturally common to all three, as the Attributes are (which we
call Natural, because they are Essential,) for these personal properties are
naturally peculiar and incommunicable, and yet they do nor superadd any new
Nature; because the divine Nature does contain all Relative as well as
Absolute perfection in it; and the Godhead considered with all these
incommunicable properties is but one single Godhead, as has been shown: this

The fifth difference between created and uncreated Persons.
a different Will, a different Power, because they have a different Nature. But
uncreated persons who have one and the same undivided and infinite Nature, must
needs have one and the same Understanding, Will and Power. For, we cannot
comprehend God as one pure vital act, but as his life is actuous Vita Dei est
actuosa intellectu, voluntate, and potentia.
or active in his Understanding and Will, in his Essential and Almighty Power.
Now, what is Quod essentiae proprium est hypostasibus commune est.
Essential, that must needs be common to all three persons.

Whatsoever the Father is as he is substance, as he is life, as he is eternity,
as he is perfection, as he is God, the same is the Son of God, and the Holy
Ghost, as Augusti^ does frequently discourse. When the Quicquid dicitur de
praedicato essentiali, dici^ur de Subjecto.
Attribute or praedicate is Essential, whatsoever is affirmed of the Attribute
or praedicate, that must needs be true of the subject, as the Philosopher and
all that have any reason in them, do unanimously conclude. The Essential power
of God is the very Essence of God; God does Act by, and of himself, and not by
any faculty or power superadded to his Essence; Christ is called the Filius
(...) dicitur ab Epiphanio contra Marcellianos haeresi* 72 page 358. (...)
inquit Basilius de Filio contra Eunomium lib 2 page 339.
power of God, and the Holy Vide D. Go^ari Diatriben de Christo (...) and D.
Voe^ii notas in select. Disp. D. Voetii par. 1. page 442. 445. 449.
Ghost is called the power of the most high. 1 Cor. 1. v. 8. 24. Luke 1 35. to
show that they have the same Essential power that the Father has Christ says,
that none can take his sheep out of his hand, because none can take them out of
his Fathers hand; for says he, I and my Father are one, John 5. 28, 29, 30. We
have one nature, one hand, that is one Power. For the hand of God can be
nothing else but the power of God. And therefore since all the three divine
Persons are one God, because they have one and the same divine Nature, th^se
three are Omnes tres personae sunt Coessentiales, and proinde essentialiter
unum sunt; tres enim person non sunt tres essentiae, sed ipsissima and
unicissima essentia, quia simplicissima. Personae autem Coessentiales sunt
coaequiles; licet enim filius and Spiritus Sanctus vitam, potentiam, omnia
habeant a Patre, omnia habent per naturam, nihil per gratiam.
one with the most perfect and singular manner of unity. Finally, since the
Power of God is the Essence of God, it must reeds follow that all three persons
have the same power, because they have the same divine essence, and they have
the self-same essence by nature, not by mere indulgence or grace.

But then some who have a great mind to cavil, The grand objection.
tell us that we do but equivocate when we say these three Persons have the
same Essential Power, because we do conceal the other member of the
distinction, which is Relative or Potentia divina distinguitur in Personalem
and Essentiale^ Personalis est qua Pater generat filium, etc. Essentialis est
quae co^munis est tribus personis. Potentia Patris videtur esse Activa, quia
Pater est gignens; generatio autem filii videtur esse Passiva, quia filius est
genitus Psalm. 2. 7. Joan. 1. 14. There is no Passive Generation in the Son of
God. The divine Essence of Christ is not changed, or begotten. The Answer.
Personal Power. Now it is impossible, say they, that these three should have
the same Personal or Relative power, because the Father does beget a Son as he
is God the Father, as he is the first personal principle, and not simply and
absolutely as he is God; But the Son has not power to beget himself, or to
beget another Son, because there can be but three divine Persons, and there is
but one of the three called a Son in Scripture. Moreover, the Son is begotten,
and therefore his power is rather a Passive then an Active power. But the power
of the Father whereby he did beget his Son is an Active power. Nor did the Holy
Ghost breath forth himself by his own power, for he did not proceed from
himself, but from the Father and the Son; and therefore though there be but
one Essential power, it should seem that there are three Personal or
Relative powers truly distinct in the Godhead.

This Argument is the most plausible Argument which is urged by them, and
therefore it must be most warily answered.

1. We do not equivocate in this or any other point, but do readily acknowledge
that God the Father does beget a Son as he is God the Father, and not simply
and absolutely as he is God; because this eternal generation points at a
personal property considered after the manner of a vital Act. But then as
this personal property and relation does not differ really from the divine
Essence, so this personal power of begetting does not differ really from the
Essential power, because God does beget a Son in the unity of his own divine
Essence; his Son is Nullu^ horum alium aut praecedit aeternitate aut excedit
magnitudine aut superat potestate August. lib. 6. de trinitate cap. ultimo.
equal to him, and therefore not Ideo non est Pater major filio, quia aequalem
sibi genuit. Originis enim quaestio ista est, quis de quo sit; aequalitatis
autem qualis aut quantus sit. Aug. Cont. Max. l. 3. c. 18.
essentially Pater non genuit filium exse per seminalem rationem, nec extra se
per Physicam productionem, sed in se, hoc est in unitate essentiae genuit.
Philip. 2. 6.
different from him, John 5. 18. 26. John 10. 30. Nulla fuit mutatio
essentialis in filio, cujus essentia est immutablis.

2. We deny that there is an active Power in the Father, Potentia passiva est
propria materiae, ex qua producitur genitum. In deo autem nulla est generatio
Materialis. In passiva generatione genitum a non esse ad esse producitur;
Filius autem semper actu exticit; genitus non est gignente posterior, quia ab
aeterno genitus.
and a passive Power in the Son in respect of generation, because a Passive
power notes materiality and imperfection; but this eternal generation cannot
be material, for God is a Spirit infinitely more spiritual then the most
glorious Angel. Pater genuit filium and filius genitus est -- spiritualiter,
immutabiliter.

3. The two words of begetting and being Generatio considerata respectu filii
geniti est filiat^o sive proprietas filii; generatio aute^ respectu Patris est
Communicatio vitae subsistentis; per hanc autem communicationem filius est unum
cum Patre ab aeterno. Mich, 5. 2. non sunt itaque duae generationes sed duae
personae gignens, and genita. Vide D. Alting. Problem. XI. par. 1.
begotten which are used in Scripture do not point at two different powers, an
Active and a Passive, but at two different persons; the Father who did beget,
and the Son who was never unbegotten, Micah 5. 2. for he was of old, from the
days of eternity.

4. It was not in the power of the Father to forbear the begetting of his Son,
because the Son is Ens Quod est in potentia gignentis, id non semper extitit,
sed potest esse vel non esse. Filius autem semper exticit imo non potest non
esse, quia est (...) Ens sum necessarium non minus quam ipse Pater.
sum necessarium, as well as the Father, the Son is (...), God of himself,
and not God by participation, nor a different God from the Father, but the same
God with the Father, and therefore an Independent, Eternal God, who did not
begin to be God, who cannot cease to be God, but has life in himself as well
as the Father, John 5. 20. and has the self-same divine life, divine nature,
divine power which the Father has; and therefore the Schools conclude well
that the Father and the Son have the Eadem essentia quae in Patre est
paterni^as, in filio est filiatio; eadem potentia generat Pater, filiusque
generatur. Habetitaque silius eandem potentiam quam Pater, sed cum ali^
relatione; Pate^ ut commuicans, filius ut accipiens, Johan. 5. 26. (...)
generare est dare potentiam, (...) generari est acci^ere potentiam vide. Aquin.
Sum. part. 1. qu. 42. art. 6.
same power, but with a different relation; but these different relations do
not superadd a new Essence, a new divine Nature; and they who have the same
Essence, must needs have the same power, because the Power of God is not
distinguished from the Essence of God, and the Father does communicate the same
Essence and Power which the Son receives.

5. There is the same reason of the Son and Holy Ghost; for these three are Non
potest autem qui accepit ei qui de^it esse i^^qual^^, qu^^ (...) accepit ut
esse^ ^qualis. Aug. lib. 3. cont^a Maximinum. cap. 14.
equal, nay one, Essentially one, one God with the most perfect kind of unity,
as has been shown: and some that are Metaphysical acknowledge that nothing is
simply Id solum (...) unum est, quod simplicissimum est; Solus itaque Deus
s^mpliciter unus est in quo nihil omnino est quod Deus non est. Vide Fonsecam

4. (...) 1. (...). 2 (...). 3. (...). 4. (...). 5. (...). 6. (...). 6 Kinds of
Unity. All the three persons have the same Power.
Aristotle discoursing of six kinds of unity says that things may be said to
be one*

1. in respect of Continuity, because they are one Continued body.

2. In respect of their Subject, as two accidents in the same subject.

3. Because they are under the same Genus.

4. Because they are of the same Species.

5. Because they have the same definition; but then he concludes that all these
are but imperfect kinds of unity, if compared with the last unity, which is

6. When a thing is one in respect of its single and indivisible Essence. Omnia
habet filius a Patre, sed Pater and filius unum sunt: filius itaque nihil
accipi^t ab ilio, qui est a Filio aliud; filius enim est idem cum Patre
unicusque Deus.


Now the Father and Son are one, John 10. 30. The Father, Son and Pater and
Filius spirando communicant vitam subsistentem Spiritui Sancto per quam
Spiritus Sanctus est unum cum Patre and Filio. 1 Joan. 5. 7. Spiritus itaque
spiratus vitam accipit subsistentem, nec non potentiam Coessentialem; eandem
itaque potentiam habet Spiritus, sed cum diversa proprietate sive ratione
personali.
holy Ghost are one, 1 John 5. 7. and they are one after the most perfect
manner, they are one in respect of the most single and indivisible Essence,
because the divine Essence is most single and perfectly one. And therefore
since Patres dicunt essentiam generare* hoc est essentia relative accepta,
essentia cum modo and proprietate personali considerata generat, hoc est Deus
Pater generat Filium.
Essence and Power are not distinguished in God, it follows undenyably that
these three who have one Essence, have one and the same power, but with
different properties and relations.

This truth will be more evident when we have discoursed of the distinction of
these three divine persons, of which we are to treat in the next Chapter.

VI. Created Persons have a different place and presence, The sixth difference.
but Uncreated Persons are omnipresent, they cannot be separated or divided
from one another in respect of place or presence, but do subsist in one
another. The Father did Essentia non generat essentiam quia est unica,
simplicissima: persona non generat personam extra essentiam, quia essentia
infinita extra se fundi non potest.
beget the Son in the unity of the divine nature, and the Son does subsist in
the nature of God, Phil. 2. 6. and all three persons subsisting in the Tota
natura divina est in tribus personis, tota in singulis singularissime unica,
servatis tum essentialibus essentiae, tum relativis personarum in unitate
essentiae proprietatibus.
same single and omnipresent nature, they must needs subsist in one another.
The divine nature of the Father is in the Son, and therefore the Father is in
the Son; the divine nature of the Son is in the Father, and therefore the Son
is in the Father, and the like may be said of the Holy Ghost, for the divine
nature of the Holy Ghost is in the Father and the Son. These three glorious
persons are distinguished from one another, and yet they do subsist in one
another. They do subsist in one another without any contraction (...), propter

(...) in sent, did 19. q. 2. Thom p. 1. q. 42. at^. 5. John 14. 10, 11.
Damascen taught the Schoolmen to speak; when Philip desired Christ to show him
the Father, our Savior answers, He that has seen me has seen the Father,
John 14. 9. because he is the Image of his Fathers Person, and the illustrious
brightness of his Fathers glory; nay, because the nature of his Father is in
him, and the person of his Father is in him; and therefore he calls upon Philip
to believe that his Father is in him. John 14. 10* Beleevest thou not that I am
in the Father and the Father in me? as if he had said, I wonder you should not
believe this truth, it is a special Article of your faith if you be a
Christian: and it is a very plain Article, for you have some sensible
Arguments to confirm your faith in this point, both from my words, and from my
works; you may hear the Father speaking in me, and see my Father working in me.
The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of my self, but the Father that
dwells in me, he does the works. Joh. 14. 10.

And then he presses the point home upon him by a Peremptory Injunction in the
11. verse. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else
believe me for the very works sake. Philip might hear what was truly divine in
the saving words of Christ, and see what was divine in the miraculous works of
Christ, and by the words and works (and Spirit of Christ making both
effectual) he might be brought to believe this necessary point, that the
Nature of God the Father, and the Person of God the Father is in Christ. The
nature and Person of God the Father is in Christ. John 10. opened. John 10. 38.
Give me leave to insist upon this point, for there is more in it then we can
well observe at first view, and therefore our Savior did press this point
home very frequently, and require that men would expressly believe it, John
10. 38. believe the works -- but to what end? Why, that ye may know and
believe that the Father is in me, and I in him. This is the end of Christ's
working so many miracles amongst them, to bring them to believe that he and the
Father did mutually subsist in one another. Credit operibus, believe my works
says he, they speak me to be God, and the Son of God, and therefore I am not
guilty of blasphemy, because I say I am the Son of God, and equal to God, for
I am God, I and my Father are one God; and if you believe that I and my Father
are one God, John 10. from the ^5 v. to the 39.
you must believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me. This is the
sum and substance of our Saviors discourse from the 25. verse of the tenth
chapter of John to the 39. verse of that chapter; and our Savior did enter
into this discourse at the request of the Jews, who came round about him, and
desired him not to hold them in suspense any longer, but to tell them plainly
whether he were the Christ or no. John 10. 24. all then who believe Jesus
Christ to be the Christ, the true Messiah, the only Savior, and an all
sufficient Savior, must believe, confess and acknowledge this truth, That the
Father is in Christ, and Christ in the Father. From what has been spoken it is
clear and evident, that this is a point of life and death, as we say, a
fundamental point, a point necessary to salvation, and therefore our Savior
did so often insist upon it. In the 8th. of John, John 8, 16. 18, 29. John 14.
10, 11, 21. John 10* 38 John 16* 27. 30. 32. Joh. 17* 21 The sixth difference
between created and uncreated persons.
our Savior tells them more then once, that he was not alone, and therefore
his testimony of himself was not a single testimony, but his Father who was
with him and in him did bear witness with him, and of him, John 8. 16. for I am
not alone, but I and the Father that sent me; I am one that bear witness of
my self, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me, v. 18. And he
that sent me is with me, the Father has not left me alone, v. 29. This point
is difficult to believe, that Christ who is man is very God, the same God with
the Father, a different Person from the Father, yet subsisting in the Father,
who is the only true God; but as Rollock says well, though this point be most
Ut autem difficillimum sit hoc credere, and naturam long ex^perat: ita
necessarium est adeo ad salutem, ut sine fide illa non sit salus. Hinc sequitur
quod cum a natura alienum sit, and tamen necessariu^, oportere nos ex natura
exire and supra na turam efferri, ad hoc ut videamus Deum in Christo
habitantem. Rolloc. Co^. in Johan. 14. v. 10, 11
difficult, yet it is most necessary, and therefore we must beg the spirit of
God that we may get above nature, and see the Father in Christ, and Christ in
the Father, for the natural man does not relish, receive or perceive the
things of God, 1 Cor. 2. 14, Our Savior told his Disciples, that when the
Spirit was poured out more plentifully upon them, then they should know him to
be in his Father. The Father will give you another Comforter even the Spirit of
truth, and at that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, John 14. 16, 17,
20. and in the sixteenth of John the Spirit had convinced the Disciples of this
weighty truth; for they say, By this we believe that thou came forth from
God; Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? Behold the hour comes, yea is
now come, that ye shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me
alone, and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me, John 16. 30, 31,
32. In these and diverse other places our Savior does declare this truth unto
us, that he is in his Father; and if it were not a weighty truth of very great
consequence and high concernment, he would not insist so much upon it; it is
the mutual in-subsistence, and Coessential Deus est ubique totus in seipso:
^uo^modo ubique si in seipso? ubique quia nusquam est absens: in seipso autem
quia non Continetur ab eis, quibus est praesens; anq^^a^ sine eis esse non
possit. August. Epist. 57. ad Da^danum.
Omnipresence of the Father and the Son.

And the Spirit being Qui ubi que est in seipso est; qui in seipso est, in
omnibus sibi Coessentialibus necessario est, volens tamen gaudensque.
Coessentiall with the Father and the Son, must needs be in them both, from
whom he proceeds in the unity of the Naturae est in tribus personis non (...)

Divine Nature; for it is clear that an infinite Nature cannot be poured forth
beyond it self, because it is boundless, and therefore when we read 1 Cor. 2.
11. What man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man, which is in
him? Even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God, (we may
safely Spiritus Dei dicitur esse in Deo, 1 Cor. 2. 11. qui tamen est Deus ipse,
1 Cor. 6. 20. nempe ad intimam inexistentiam trium personarum in seipsis

add) which is in God, because he did proceed in the unity of the divine In
processionibus divinis nulla est partitio (...), vel (...) quibus tribus modis
res creatae producuntur, quia eadem natura singularis simplex, indivisibilis

indivisible and boundless nature. The Holy Ghost has the same Nature with
the Father and the Son; and a Nature of infinite and boundless perfection*
cannot be communicated to any thing that is not infinite, to any thing that is
not it self, because there can be no other infinite thing but it self, there
can be but one infinite, and every one of the three glorious persons is one and
the same infinite God; upon these grouds we may answer many questions.

If you ask Where God was before the World was made? I answer, that he was
then, just where he is now, in himself (...) seip^^ ^bique est Deus noster

divisionem, sed per infinitatem simplicissimam.

If you ask where the Father was; I answer, in the Son; if you ask where the
Son was; I answer, in the Father: If you ask where the Spirit was, I answer, he
was both in the Father and in the Son, and they both in him. God Ante omnia

was in all three persons, and all three persons in the Godhead, and in one
another, and so they do, and will remain to all eternity, because they are
Coessentiall, because they are one omnipresent and eternal God. The Godhead is
not shut up in the narrow circle of the universe, the whole Godhead is in the
world, and the whole Godhead is out the world, for the world cannot contain
the true God, who did create, and does uphold the world, and the single Godhead
cannot be divided; and therefore we must not conceive that part of the Godhead
is in the world, and part of it out of the world, but the whole Godhead is

every where, it is not included in any place, or excluded from any place; the
heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him, 1 King. 8. 27. his perfection
is higher then heaven, and deeper then hell, Job 11. 8.

From what has been said, it is most clear, that since the Essence of God is
omnipresent, and the self same indivisible Essence is in Father, Son and Holy
Ghost, all three must needs mutually subsist in one another; though the persons
be distinguished, they cannot be Tres personae sunt (...) quia (...), and non
tantum (...). Tres homines quibus una competit definitio, sunt tantum (...),
quia natura eorum est finita, and divisa; non enim tota esten^ia patris crea^i
sed part tantum filio communicatur, and hypostase^ eorum sunt separatae. Non
sunt itaque ejusdem naturae indivisae, ejusdem naturae singularis, and proinde
licet communi ratione homines dicantur, tamen reipsa non sunt unus homo.
Personae autem divinae (...) sunt propter unius communis, and tamen sing^laris

Spiritus Sanctus.
separated, divided or contracted; and therefore this sixth difference between
created and uncreated persons, is so remarkable, that I need not go about to
prove that humane persons are separated as well as distinguished; tot sunt
humanitates quot homines; and it is most certain that Angelical persons have
a limited presence, because they have a finite essince. But it is otherwise in
divine persons, for the Father works in the Son, and by the Spirit the Father
subsists in the Son and in the Spirit, and cannot be separated from these
Coessentiall and Omnipresent persons, who do subsist with him (as they are both
from him) in the unity of the Godhead.

I need say no more concerning Angels then what is commonly said, Angeli sunt
Alicuoi Definitive; sunt enim in suo Vbi non per operationem vel
circumscriptionem, sed per Designationem Definitivam, Angels are naturally
somewhere; though they are not in any place by extension of parts yet their
finite nature is contained within certain bounds and limits. Hence Immensa Dei

of which we have spoken; and ^ime or Duration, of which we are to speak. It
will not be necessary or useful to discourse of every particular; but that
which I intend to insist upon under this head is, That Created Persons are
distinguished from one another by an Personae creatae differunt intelligentia
voluntate, potentia, essentia, operatione, locorum intervallis imo propria
accidentium congerie. Vide Gomarum de Trinitate Tom. 3. page 24.
heap of Accidents, and therefore it will be sufficient for the making good of
this seventh Difference, to show that divine Persons are not distinguished by a
Congeries, or heap of Accidents, because there is no Accident at all in God.
For the being of God is infinitely perfect, and singularly single, as has been
proved; and therefore it is infinitely below the single perfection of God to be
compounded of a substance and accidents for the adorning or perfecting of his
glorious being. Relations are not Accidents in God. The Personae divinae non
dicuntur Relativae propter essentias Relativas, sed propter modos sive
proprietates Relativas, quae quidem proprietates non differunt realiter
essentialiter, imo nec realiter separabiliter ab essentia divina. Personae
autem divinae sunt extra omne genus omnemque dependentiam.
reltion of one Coessentiall person to another is agreeable to the Essence of
God; it is a necessary relation which did never begin to be, and cannot cease
to be.

The relation of God to the creature cannot be real, because it is such a
relation as might not have been; but there is no real thing in God which might
not have been.

2. There can be no real relation between two extremes, one of which two
extremes is unchangeable, and the other might not have been.

3. God was not in any passive Potentiality or Power, before he did create the
world, to receive any real act, because he is really a Vide Metaphys. Fonsec.
lib. 5. cap. 15. Sect. 7.
pure act; and it is evident that a new real relation is a kind of act whereof
the pure, single, perfect and unchangeable essence is incapable.

4. Our weak understanding comparing God with the creatures, is apt to frame
many denominations, which according to the manner of signifying, seem to import
as if God were in potentia Vide Scotum, Estium etc. in 1. sent. did. 30. omn^s
(...) respectiva concipitur in Deo ad creaturam est tantum secundum rationem,
and modum concipiendi nostrum, quia divina natura est Absoluta in se, and ab
omni ordine creaturarum independens, sive creaturae existunt sive non. Vide
Suarez. Disp. 47. Sect. 15. Number 25.
ad multa; yet if we do consider the thing signified, as we ought in a way
agreeable to the pure, single and infinite Perfection of God, we shall find
that these are but extrinsecall denominations. This point is much beaten upon
by the most acute Schoolmen, and Writers of Metaphysics, and therefore I need
not insist upon it; only observe that when I say created persons are
distinguished by a heap of Accidents, I do not mean that a person is made
complete in his subsistence by any Accident, or an heap of Accidents, for I
have refuted that conceit, in this present chapter page 73. I hasten to the
eighth Difference.

VIII. Humane Persons with whom we are best acquainted, The eighth Difference
betw^ene created and uncr^ated Persons is in respect of their different
duration.
may exist in a very different time as well as in different places; some lived
before, some since the flood: some before the Incarnation, others since the
Death and Resurrection of our Lord and Savior; but herein all agree that time
is the measure of them all; their duration is very imperfect, their duration is
not always contemporary, never Coessentiall. But all three uncreated Persons
are Coeternal, because they are Coessential, because they have the same divine
eternal Essence: Angels are said to have an eternal duration, but they are not
Aecernitas proprie dicta est increata; duratio itaque Angelorum non est vera
aeternitas. Aeternum dicitur quod est extra terminum, and ex se incapax
termini, quia in sua intrinsecaratione infinitatem in durando includit.
eternal in the same sense that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are Eternal.

1. Because they were created, Coloss. 1. 16. and therefore did begin to be,
Angels are not coaeternall with God.
they have not (as the Schools say) an interminable or interminated duration a
part ante.

2. If they had been created from eternity, yet they could not have been
esteemed Coeternall with their Creator, who did create them out of nothing,
and did not beget or breath them forth in the unity of his own divine Essence.

3. There can be no less then an infinite difference between the finite,
dependent, Aliud est esse aeternum, aliud sempiternum, quia omne aeternum est
immutabile. Richard. Victor. lib. 2. de Trinitate. c. 4. Ratio aeternitatis
consequitur immutabilitatem sicut ratio temporis motum. Th. p. 1. qu. 10. art
2. c.
changable, defective duration of an Angel, and the infinite, independent,
immutable duration of these three uncreated, and all creating persons, who are
one independent, unchangeable, eternal, infinite God the eternity of the three
glorious persons is interminable, indefectible, immutable.

4. If Angels had been created from eternity, yet they would not have been
essentially Deus est aeternus, imo and sua aeternitas; Deus enim est infinita
perfectio, and proinde simul, and ex se, atque immutabiliter habet totam
perfectionem suam, ratione cujus ex se sit sufficiens ad coexistendum omni
durationi, quantacunque illa sit; and proinde sicut Deus est sua essentia and
perfectio, ita est sua aeternitat. Vide Suarez. Metaph Disp 50. Sect. 4. Th. p.
1. qu. 10, a. 2.
or intrinsecally eternal, because their essence does not include any
repugnancy to an actual beginning.

5. If Angels had been created from eternity, yet God might have annihilated
them afterward, and then they had actually ceased to be.

6. Although they were not actually annihilated, yet the very Est in Angelis
potentia Obedientialis ad corruptionem, quae natural^s dicipotest, quia in
natura Angelorum quae a creatore dependet (...) desinere posse ad nutum
creatoris fundatur. Omnis enim potentia Naturalis est quae in rerum naturis
fundatur. Vide si^ Suarez. Disp. 43. Sect. 4. n* 2.
possibility of being annihilated is enough to prove their duration terminable,
changeable, defectible; and therefore though they had been created from all
eternity, they would not have been coeternall with their maker, nor would three
Angels have been coessentially coeternall with one another.

7. If Angels had been created from eternity, they would have been eternal,
not by any intrinsecall or natural duration, as has been proved; and
therefore they would have been eternal only by an Si Angeli ab aeterno creati
essent a Deo, non sequeretur eos esse Deo coaeternos per durationem
intrinsecam, sed potius ab aeterno esse, and aeternitati coexistere per
denominationem extrinsecam a Dei aeternitate sumptam; durarent enim ex
aeternitate, non tamen duratione quae sit aeternitas, quia aeternitas est
duratio per se, and abintrinseco necessaria, independens, immutabilis, quae
nullam variationem aut successionem admittit neque in esse, neque in propriis
and internis actibus aut motibus; vel per internam capacitatem, vel extrinsecam
potentiam. Angeli non sunt Deo coaeterni, multo minus aequaeterni, sed sunt
potius aeviterni quam aeterni.
extrinsecall denomination, taken from the Eternity of God.

8. Upon consideration of the Premises, many Reverend Doctors of the Church
conclude, that Angels are eternal only a part post; and they are eternal a
part post, not by their own nature, but by the free favor and appointment of
God; and therefore there is an infinite difference between the duration of
these three uncreated persons, and the duration of the most glorious Angels in
Heaven. Angels are Unum est primum, alia dependent igitur. Ergo sua natura
omnia praeter unum corruptibilia. Tame^si enim sunt entia absoluta a subjecto
and a termino: tamen haud sunt absoluta a causa. Sunt igitur per aliud, and ab
alio; at omne dependens ab eo, a quo dependet, si est voluntarium principium,
mutari potest; ergo ipsae quoque mentes immateriales etsi ponantur, a
Peripateticis coaeternae Deo, tamen ut a Primo pendent a Primi nutu deponi
possunt ab ea essentia, in qua sunt ab illo constitutae. Vide Scalig. exerc.
307.
mu^able, and God is free Agent both in respect of Creation, and in respect of
preservation; and therefore God and Angels are not Coeternall as the
Peripateticks dreamt. God did voluntarily engage himself to create and preserve
Angels by his own Decree; and therefore that subordinate aeternity which they
have a part post, is vouchsafed unto them by the free and undeserved favor of
God. For (as Damasc. Orth. fid. lib. 2. cap. 3. and 12. Just. Mart. qu. 13, 14.
Hieron. contra Pelagium lib. 2. Cyrill. 8. These. c. 2 Angelus auem non potest
destrui per Physicam corruptionem, quia non componitur ex partibus Physicis.
Viri itaque gravissimi ideo dicunt Angelos natura incorrupti^iles esse, quia
Angelus non habet aliquid intra naturam sui corruptivum.
Damascen says well) whatsoever had a beginning would soon have an ending, if
he who gave a beginning to it by his infinite power should think fit to suspend
his upholding and preserving influence, or put forth his Almighty and
irresistible power against it in a destructive way.

I will not take this fair occasion to speak of the acts or motions of Angels
to make this difference seem greater; for that which has been said is
su^^^cient to make it evident that Angels do not coexist with God the Father
with the same duration wherewith God the Son and God the Holy Ghost do coexist
with him; because these three coessentiall persons are Coeternall; they are all
three one God, who is his own Essence, his own Eternity; The Scripture calls
the God of Israel the Eternity of Israel, 1 Samuel 15. 29. and (...). Aristot.
lib. 11. Metaphys. cap. 7.
Aristotle calls him life it self, the best life, an Eternal life, that has
neither beginning nor ending, nor succession; and therefore it is evident that
he did not believe God to be subject to Id enim Deus est (inquit Aristoteles)
and proinde Deum ipsam vitam esse intulit; aeternitatem ae vum continuum,
aeternumque vocat sine successione, sine terminis.
change or variation. God is (says (...) dicitur (...). Legimus etiam (...)
apud Aristot. 1. de Caelo text. 100. (...) inquit Phavorinus, (...), aevum

Heb. 5. 9. 1 John 3. 9. 1 Pet. 1. 20 23, 24* 25.
he) a self-sufficient and eternal life. God is truly self-sufficient, because
he is alsufficient, he is infinite in perfection, and therefore infinite in
duration; his infinite perfection and duration is nothing else but but his
infinite Essence; and this infinite Essence is the self-same in all three
Coessentiall, Coeternall and Coequall persons, as has been proved. And
therefore we have good cause to rejoice and triumph in this glorious difference
between created and uncreated persons.

Give me leave to sweeten this dispute with some devotion. We have an
everlasting Father, an everlasting Savior and an everlasting Comforter: and we
have good cause to lay a charge upon our immortal souls to bless and praise
all three Coeternal persons, for their eternal love, our eternal redemption
and salvation. Praise the Lord O my soul, while I live will I praise the Lord;
whilst I have any being will I sing praises to my God, and put confidence in
him, for with the Lord there is plenteous and eternal redemption. But O put
not your trust in Princes, nor in those sons of men in whom there is no
salvation, for their breath goes forth, they return to their first earth, and
in that day all their thoughts and counsels perish. Happy is he that has the
God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God, which made heaven
and earth, the sea and all that therein is, which keeps truth for ever; read
and consider the six first verses of the 146. Psalm* there is a great Emphasis
in the sixth verse, which keeps truth for ever. O let us declare it to the
following generation that ^his God is our God for ever and ever, and he will be
our guide even unto death, Psalm. 48. 13, 14. Happy it is for us that we are
redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, who offered up himself by by his
eternal spirit, his divine and eternal Nature, Heb 9. 14. that he might bring
in everlasting righteousness, Dan. 9. 24. obtain eternal redemption, and
purchase an eternal inheritance for us, Heb. 9. 12. 15. Happy, thrice happy it
is for us that we are born of incorruptible seed, which will abide in us for
ever: for we are born of the eternal spirit, who will perfect his work in us,
and be our everlasting Comforter. Finally, all three uncreated Persons will be
our all-sufficient and satisfactory portion and reward for ever-more.

IX. Three Created persons have different actions and operations, The ninth
difference between c^eated and unc^eated Persons.
because they have different singular natures, different powers, etc. as has
been shown in this very chapter. All actions of Father, Son and Holy Ghost
upon the creatures are undivided, nay indivisible; how Personal Actions ad
infra differ, I am to declare at large in the next chapter, where I am to show
how these three glorious persons who cannot be divided, are truly distinguished
from one another; only before I conclude this chapter, it will be requisite to
note, that though the Son cannot be said to beget himself, yet he is not
Passive in that eternal generation, as has been proved above; the divine
nature which is communicated to the Son by generation, is the nature of the Son
as well as of the Father: the Father does necessarily beget the Son in the
power of that Nature, and in the unity of that self-same single and indivisible
Nature; and that divine Nature which is communicated to the Son, Christus est
(...) non (...)* est enim filius a Patre, Deus a seipso.
is not begotten by the Father, but is of it self; and therefore we say that
Christ is God of himself, though he be not a Son of himself, but of the Father
by eternal generation, because the Father is the first principle of subsisting
life.

I might proceed to treat of other differences: that common Rule, Actiones sunt
suppositorum, See Mr. Estwicks learned Treatise in confutation of Mr. Bidle,
page 41.
is true of divine actions and uncreated Persons; but it is manifest that there
are many actions of the soul of man, both when it is in a state of union with,
and when it is in a state of separation from the body, which cannot be properly
and truly called actions of a person, but I shall not descend so low, as to
take notice of such differences.

The nine differences which have been insisted on are all considerable. And
from them all we may safely conclude that the word Subsistence or Person cannot
be attributed after the same manner to God, Angels and men. A divine Person is a
Spiritual and Infinite Subsistent, which must not be considered as abstracted
from, but as Subsisting in the Divine Nature, and as related to those other
Coessentiall persons, from which he is sufficiently distinguished by some
Personal and Incommunicable property; And therefore Subsistence is attributed
to God after the most excellent and glorious manner. A Person signifies the
most excellent kind of Subsistent, an understanding subsistent, as has been
shown; but then an uncreated person, a divine person does infinitely excel
and transcend the person of the most glorious Angel in Heaven; and therefore we
must remove all those imperfections from our thoughts, which are in created
persons, when we meditate or discouse of these divine and uncreated persons,
that we may think and speak according to the Analogy of faith.

CHAP. VII.
The three Uncreated, Divine, and Coessentiall Subsistents are sufficiently
distinguished, though they cannot be divided.
WE are now come to treat of that profound Mystery, (...). Athan s. ad
Scr^pionem.
at which men and Angels stand amazed. How can three be one? (says the
Disputer of this world) or one be three? Can one be distinguished again and
again from himself? O bold fools, (says Athanasius) Why do you not lay aside
your curiosity, and enquire no farther after a Trinity, then to believe that
there is a Trinity? The Scripture says there is but one God, and the Scripture
says that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are this one God; and yet the
Scripture says, that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three, three and yet
one: three Persons and yet one God. We have shown above that the Godhead
cannot be multiplied; now we are to show that the Persons are distinguished,
and what kind of distinction there is between these three divine and uncreated
Persons.

1. These divine and uncreated Persons are sufficiently distinguished to our
apprehension, Trinitatis divinum dogma est; In Deo sic est ut dicit; in
Scriptura sic dicit ut est; in Ecclesia sic creditur ut Scriptura dicit. Iunius
contra errores Samosit.
who ought to judge, believe, speak, worship, according to the Word of God.

2. These uncreated Persons were truly distinguished from one another before
there was any Scripture, any world; for the Coexistencie and distinction of
these glorious Persons is eternal, and therefore this distinction cannot be
grounded upon the mere phrase of Scripture; it is the true intent of God in
several plain expressions of Scripture, to declare unto us the distinction of
these divine and uncreated Persons. I shall prove this point fully and clearly
by certain steps and degrees.

The Divine Persons distinguished by their proper names.
The Father, the Son, [or the Word] and the Holy Ghost [or Spirit] Now that we
may not be Tritheites or Sabellians, let us consider that these three names do
not signify three different Natures, Negamus Deum esse unicam personam tribus
nominibus appellatam contra Praxean Sabellium, etc. Negamus tres personas
divinas esse tres Deos contra Tritheitas ad unum omnes. Vide Tertull. contra
Praxean. Calvinum contra Servetum. and Aug. Haeres. c. 41.
and yet they do signify three different Persons, for it is evident that one
Person cannot be praedicated of another, the Father is not the Son, nor is the
Son the Father; the Holy Ghost is not either of them, nor is either of them the
Holy Ghost; and therefore they are three distinct Persons of the Godhead.

The divine Persons are equal, and therefore distinct.
and therefore they are distinct; It is most absurd to say that the same Person
is equal to himself. But the Son is said to be equal to the Father. Philip.
2. therefore the Son is not the Father. See the Treatise of Reverend Mr.
Estwick in his Refutation of Mr. Bidles Arguments page 89. 92. 93.
We do usually say that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are equal in power, to
note a distinction of Persons; but then when we speak strictly, we do not say
the power of the Persons is equal, but we say the power of the Persons is the
same, to note the unity of their Essence. We say the Persons are equal in
power. goodness, wisdom, etc. to note that one person does not exceed another
in degrees of wisdom, power, etc. because it is impossible that there should be
any degrees in that which is infinite; and the power, wisdom, etc. of all the
three Persons is the same infinite perfection, because all three have the same
infinite Essence. And therefore when we look upon Power in a common notion, as
referred to the divine Essence which is common to all three Persons, we say it
is the same power. But when we look upon power in a singular notion as it is
communicated after a singular manner to this, or that person, we say this
person is equal to that in power, the Father equal to the Son, the Spirit
equal to both, to note the distinction of the Persons, and not the distinction
of the Power, because the self-same Almighty Power is communicated to the
several persons in a several way; Power is in the Father of and from himself
[that is] not from any other Person; the same power is communicated to the Son,
but it is communicated to him by eternal generation, and to the Spirit by
eternal procession; the ^ame power then is communicated to different coequall
persons in a different way, as we shall more fully declare before we conclude
this seventh chapter.

Divine Persons distinguished by their Number.
The nature of God is the first Entity, the first Unity, and therefore it is
incapable of number, because it is most singularly single, and actually
infinite. Deitas est perfectio infinita simplicis sime unica Unitas ad
essentiam pertinet, distinctio vero personarum non ad essentiam propie and per
se, sed ad rationem in essentia pertinet. Iunius contra errores Samosat.
It is not proper (if we speak strictly) to say that God is one in Number; we
should rather say, that God is one, and an only one. Deus non est unus Numero,
sed unicus. But the Persons of the Godhead are three in number: the Scripture
speaks expressly of three These three, 1 John 5. 7 Pater auditur in voce,
Filius manifestatur in Homine, Spiritus dignoscitur in columba.
1 John 5. 7.

If any man in Athanasius his time asked how many persons subsist in the
Godhead, they were wont to send him to Jordan; Go say they to Jordan and there
you may hear and see the blessed Trinity; or if you will believe the holy
Scriptures, read the third chapter of Matthew, the 16 and 17. verses, August.
for there*

1. The Father speaks in a voice from Heaven, Matthew 3. 16, 17.
and owns his only begotten Son, saying, This is my beloved Son, etc.

2. The Son went down into the water and was baptized.

3. The Holy Ghost did visibly descend upon Jesus Christ.

In the fourteenth of John we have a plain Demonstration of this truth. John
14* 16, 17.
I [saith the Son] will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Comforter, John 14. 16, 17. May we not safely conclude from hence that the
Spirit is a distinct Person, Another Person from the Father and the Son? for
the Text is clear, the Son will pray, and the Father will give Another
Comforter; we know the Holy Ghost is not Another God, he is the same God with
the Father and the Son, and therefore we must confess that it is meant of
Another Person; he shall give you Another Comforter, even the Spirit of truth,
verse 16, 17. And again, in the 26. verse of the same Chapter. But when the
Comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of
truth. What can there be more express or clear? The Scripture teaches us to
reckon right, and we see the divine Persons are reckoned three in Number: One
Person is not another, there are diverse Persons, there are three Persons, the
number numbered, the Persons numbered are named by their distinct and proper
names, the number numbering is expressly set down in sacred Records. We are not
more exact in any accounts then we are in reckoning of witnesses, whose
testimony is produced in a business of great consequence, and high concernment.

Now in the great question about the Messiah, witnesses are produced to assure
us, that Jesus Christ the Son of the Virgin, and the only begotten Son of God,
is the true Messiah, the only all-sufficient Savior of his people from their
sins. And there are three Witnesses named and produced for the proof of this
weighty point.

Now, one Person that has three names, or two Persons, and an Attribute of one
or both Persons cannot pass for three Witnesses in any fair and reasonable
account; we are sure God reckons right, and he reckons Father, Son and Holy
Ghost for three Witnesses, and he does not reckon these three and the Godhead
for four (as they do who dream of a Quaternity) because these three are one
and the same God blessed for ever. Let us then be exact in observing, since the
Holy Ghost is so exact in making of the account. In the eighth of John the
Pharisees object that our Savior did bear record of himself, and did conclude
from thence that therefore his record was not true, John 8. 13
John 8. 13. Our Savior answers in the next verse. Verse 14.
Though I bear record of my self, yet my record is true; for I am not alone,
Verse 16.
but I and the Father that sent me. Verse 17.
And it is written in your Law, that the testimony of two men is true. I am one
that bear witness of my self, Verse 18.
and the Father that sent me bears witness of me. It is most clear and
evident by this discourse that our blessed Lord did make a fair legal just
account; for he cites the Law concerning the validity of a testimony given in
by two witnesses; and then he reckons his Father for one witness, and himself
for another. I am one says he, and my Father is Another; I and my Father make
two sufficient Witnesses in a just and legal account. There is Another (says
he) that bears witness of me, John 5. 32
and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true, John 5 32.
There is Another says he; he does not mean another God; for when he speaks of
his power and Godhead, John 10 30
he says, I and my Father are one, John 10. 30. Christ and his Father are one
God, but Christ and his Father are two distinct Persons, for they are reckoned
as two distinct witnesses; and one Person must not be reckoned for two
witnesses. There is Another that bears witness, John 5. 32. 37.
John 5. 32. and the Father himself, v. 37. bears witness of me. Well then,
Christ is one witness, the Father is another, and the Holy Ghost is a third
witness, 1 John 5. 7. we see the Holy Ghost speaks as plainly in this point as
we do when we teach a child to tell one, two, and three. For there are three
that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost: and these
three are one. If we peruse the Scriptures diligently as we ought, we shall
find that these Witnesses are three Persons, who are one and the same blessed
God. They are one in nature, though three in subsistence, to show that these
three Persons are not to be reckoned as three men are, who have three distinct
singular natures really divided and separated; for these three glorious Persons
subsist in one another, and have one and the same single undivided and
indivisible nature; and they are three Witnesses, three Persons truly distinct,
John 1. 14, 18. cap 5, 3^, cap. 14, 16.

Divine Persons distinguished by Inward and Personal Actions.
by their inward and personal actions. The Father did from all Eternity
communicate the Vita Dei est essentia vivens, vita subsistens, quae vita ut in
Patre a nullo est, sic in Filio a Patre est
living Essence of God to the Son, in a most wonderful and glorious way; Now
it is clear that the Father did not beget himself; and therefore the Son is
another Person truly distinct from the Father, and yet equal to the Father,
because he is begotten in the Unity of the same Godhead, and has life in
himself, John 5. 26. the living Essence of God who is life it self being
communicated to him by an eternal generation. The unbegotten Father is clearly
distinguished from the only begotten Son. But I dare not say as some do, that
the Father is Active, and the Son Passive in this eternal generation because
this generation is eternal. For Nihil simpliciter aeternum dici potest fuisse
in potentia, and proinde generatio aeterna non est distinguenda in activam and
passiva^.
nothing which is eternal, can be truly said to be in a Passive Power to any
thing, much less can it be said to be in a Passive Power to be. The Son has
life in himself, is life it self, has life essentially, and as he is the same
Essence with the Father, is of himself, and has all that is essential from
that very Essence; but that Essence is communicated to the Son by the
Communicatio est Essentiae objective, quia est id quod communicatur: Patris
autem Active, quia Pater generando Essentiam communicate.
Father, and therefore the Son is said to receive all from the Father. But then
we must consider that the Son receives nothing from the Father as from an
external cause but as from an intrinsecall Principle rather the cause, for the
Son does not depend upon the Father as an Effect upon its Cause; And I call the
Father Filium a Patre, imo ex ipso Patre, and in ipso Patre genitu^
intelligimus est enim Filius Consubstantialis, Coessentialis, and proinde Patri
coaequalis. Si Filius sit par Deo, par Patri ergo est ei coaequalis: si unum
cum Patre, ergo etiam Coessentialis, 1 Johan. 5. 7.
an Intrinsecall Principle of the Sons Subsistence, because the Father does
beget the Son of, and in himself in the unity of the same Godhead; their Divine
Nature is one and the same, and their Persons are Coequall and Coeternall*
because they are Coessentiall. This is the very Mystery of Mysteries which
corrupt and wanton Reason derides, but prudent Faith admires and adores.

The Socinians tell us, The Grand Objection.
that they cannot believe, that the Father did beget a Son of his own
substance, because God is eternal and unchangeable; the single essence of God
is indivisible, and being most singularly one is incommunicable; part of the
Divine Essence could not be communicated (say they) to the Son, because the
essence is impartible, indivisible; and the self same whole Essence cannot be
communicated, because it is most singularly one, and therefore incommunicable.
Essentia quae est una Numero est incommunicabilis.

To this grand Objection I shall return a plain Answer out of pure Scripture,
The plain Answer.
and deliver it in certain Propositions or Conclusions, that the Answer may be
more direct, clear and satisfactory.

Conclusions concerning the eternal generation.
1. The Father did beget his Son; the Father himself bears witness to this
truth, and his witness is full, and clear, and true. Jehovah has said unto
me, Psalm. 2. 7.
Thou art my Son, Hebr. 1. 5.
this day have I begotten thee, Psalm. 2. 7. Nay, the Father declares this truth
to men and Angels as a Practical truth that they may direct and regulate their
worship according to this Mystery. The Apostle proves that Christ is more
excellent then Angels, because he has a more excellent Name then they; For,
unto which of the Angels said he at any time, thou art my Son, this day have I
begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a
Son, Hebr. 1. 4, 5. Here Is a double proof of the point, he has a more
excellent name, because he is the Son of God in a peculiar sense, and has the
divine nature communicated to him, as shall be fully proved ere we conclude
this point; for the name of Son is not an empty Title, he has the divine
nature of his Father in him. Now that he is the Son of God, is testified again,
and again, says the Apostle, verse 5. And he begins the sixth verse thus, And
again, etc. You see how he does inculcate this point, how he beats upon it
again and again; and the reason is, because this truth is Fundamental both of
Faith and Worship, as is most evident in the sixth verse of that chapter. And
again when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he says, And let
all the Angels of God worship him, Hebr. 1. 6.

You see this Mystery of the unbegotten Father, and the only begotten Son is
held forth to men and Angels in order to worship that their worship may be
directed to Jesus Christ as the Son of the living God, and to God the Father,
as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. God declared this truth after a
glorious manner from heaven, that it might be more diligently considered.
Matthew. 3. 17.
And lo a voice from heaven, Matthew. 19. 5.
saying, this is my beloved Son Matthew. 3. 17. when he was bapt^zed: and the
like we read of when he was transfigured in the presence of the Disciples in
the holy Mount. And the Apostle does take notice of these solemn declarations
from heaven, and lays them down as Fundamentals of the Christian Religion, 2
Pet. 1. from the 16. verse to the twentieth. All the glorious Miracles wrought
by our Savior, John 5. 36 and his resurrection from the Dead bear witness to
this fundamental truth, that Christ is the first begotten, and the only
begotten Son of the living God; be pleased to compare, Acts. 13. 32, 33. with
Romans 1. 4. and it will be evident that he was not made, but only declared to
be the Son of God at the time of his Resurrection.

2. The Father did beget his Son from before his works of old; I (says the Son
who is the wisdom of the Father) was set up from Revel. 1. 18. Colos. 1. 15.

Proper or Natural Son of God; he spared not his own Son, or his Proper Son;
Romans 8. 32. God is the Father of Christ, his own Father, John 5. 18. the Jews
did well understand the importance and force of that expression, for say they,
in that he said God is his own Father, he has made himself equal with God;
and therefore that Phrase does import that he is the Natural and Coessentiall
Son of God, else he could not be Coequall with his Father, John 5 18. Philip.
2. 6. All those Texts which prove that Christ is God, and that there is but one
God, do prove that Christ is the Natural and Coessentiall Son of God. God has
but one Coessentiall Son, to whom he has given to have life in himself, John
5. 26. because the Divine Nature, which is life it self is communicated to the
Son by this eternal and ineffable generation. It is proper to living creatures
to communicate their nature by generation in their low and imperfect way; but
the great God who is not subject to imperfection, does after the most glorious
and perfect manner beget a Son in the unity of his own living Essence, who is
therefore called the Son of the living God, that is the Natural and
Coessentiall Son of God, who has the same Divine Life, Nature, Essence with
the Father; and therefore Peter is so highly commended for confessing that
Christ is the Son of the living God; Blessed art thou, says our Savior for
flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in
heaven; upon this fundamental truth, Christ has built the Christian Church as
on a Rock, Matthew. 16. 16. 17, 18. He who has life in himself is the Natural
and Coessentiall Son of the living God: he has the same Will, Power, Nature,
Essence, Life with his Father, John 5. 18, 26. John Totam habet essentiam

4. The Father did beget his Son without Generatio divina est omnis materiae
motus mutationis nec non successionis expers,
motion after a most glorious and wonderful manner; there can be no change,
motion, or succession in this eternal and most perfect generation. The Essence
of God is spiritual, John 4. 24. and therefore the Son is not begotten of the
Fathers seed, or any material substance, because God is a single and pure Act,
who does beget a Son within himself Essentially one with himself and therefore
his Son does not subsist out of himself, John 14. 10. John 10. 30. for an
infinite nature cannot be poured forth beyond it self. There can be no
essential change in the Son by this generation, because the generation is
eternal, and the nature which is communicated by generation is unchangable;
the Father did unchangably beget his Son, and his Son is unchangably begotten,
there is no shadow of changing or turning either in the Father of lights, or
the Son of righteousness, because they are one and the same unchangable
Jehovah, James 1. 17 Malach. 3. 6. They are too Homo generat modo physico,

carnal and base who make an unworthy and odious comparison between the
material generation of a weak man, and this more then spiritual and
supernatural generation. The eternal and unchangable Father does beget an
eternal and unchangable Son according to the perfection of his eternal,
unchangable, infinite nature. The Father does beget his Son naturally, and
therefore in a way agreeable to his unchangable Nature; if the Son were not
necessarily begotten, his being would not be necessary, and then his Essence
would not be divine.

Jesus Christ is called the Son of David according to his humane nature: but
the Lord of David, and the Son of the living God according to his divine
nature, as appears by our Saviors discourse with the Pharisees, Matthew. 22.
from the 41. verse to the 46. And the Jews sought to kill Christ because he
called God his proper Father, as appears by the original text; for our English
translation does omit that most observable Emphasis; the words are (...), John
5. 18. and Christ is called Gods proper Son; (...), Romans 8. 32. and the Apostle
gives the reason why he is called the proper Son of God in a more excellent way
then the most glorious Angel is the Son of God, because Christ is begotten by
the Father, but the Angles were only created by him; observe the words of the
Apostle, For unto which of the Angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,
this day have I begotten thee; so that the proper reason why he is called the
proper Son of God, is, because he is begotten of God; there is the most
excellent reason why Christ is said to obtain a more excellent name then
Angels: Christ was begotten in the unity of the Godhead, and therefore he alone
is properly the Son of God with a supereminent excellency. The Angels are not
such excellent sons as Christ is.

1. Because Christ is begotten of God, v. 5. 2. Worshipped by Angels with
divine honor, worshipped as God, v. 6. 3. He has the Throne, Scepter, Kingdom
of God, v. 8. 4. He has the sovereign and proper Title of God, v. 8. 5. The
Attributes of God, eternity, v, 8, 10, ^1, 12. 6. He sits at the right hand of
God, v. 13.
All these excellencies are due to Christ as the proper Son of God, Hebr. 1.
whereas the Angels the most excellent sons by creation are but ministering
spirits.

From the^e proper and excellent reasons we infer that Christ is the only
proper or natural Son of God, John 1. 14 vindicated

We, says John, beheld his glory As of the only begotten Son of God. The word
[As] is not assimilative, but declarative, and demonstrative in that place, for
it does declare to us that the glory of Christ is agreeable to his divine
nature, he being the only natural Son of God, because he is the only begotten
Son of God; just as if when we see a King sitting in his Royal robes on his
Throne, with a Crown on his head and a Scepter in his hand, we should say now
we see him as a King, that is, now he is like himself. his state is agreeable
to his Majesty; even so was the glory of Christ which the Apostles beheld
agreeable to the majesty of the only begotten Son of God, John 1. 14. and
therefore the word [As] was not inserted tanquam terminus diminuens to diminish
the glory of the only begoten Son of God; for the word [As] is left out in the*
18. verse of this very chapter, The only begotten Son which is in the bosom of
the Father, John 1 v. 18. The Scripture does abound with several expressions to
the same purpose. But we are specially to observe that the only begotten Son of
God is propounded to us as the object of saving Faith, and therefore this point
ought to be diligently studied and considered by us. For so God loved the
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him
should not perish but have everlasting life, John 3. 16. The Socinians
observing how much it concerns us to stand steadfast, and not yield one whit of
ground in this point, have tried their wit to deceive and seduce us, and
therefore they object. Object.


Isaac is called the only Son of Abraham, Genesis 22. 2. 12.

To this we answer without any great study, Sol.
That Isaac was the only Son which Abraham had by Sarah: he was the only
begotten Son of the Promise; though Ismael was the son of Abraham by Hagar, the
bondwoman, in an unworthy and dishonorable way; (...). Greg. Naz. Orat 23. in
laud^ Heronis vere filiu^* quod and solus (sit filius), and solus (Patri
filius) and si^gulari modo fili us, and soli Filius, non filius simul and Pate^.
and therefore this example will not serve the turn, we reject it, for its
impertin^ncy and dissimilitude. Christ is the only begotten Son of God, he is
Absolutely and Simply considered his only begotten Son, and not only in some
respect as Isaac was the only son of Abraham Christ (as Gregory Nazianzen said)
is truly the Son of God, he alone is the Son, and the only Son of the Father,
and his son in an only or singular way, and he is the son only, he is not the
Father also, or the holy Ghost Jesus Christ is the proper Natural true son of
God, begotten by the Father without a mother in the unity of the Godhead, from
all eternity, equal to the Father, one and the same God with the Father, as
the Scripture sets it forth; and therefore we conclude that he is simply and
absolutely the only begotten Son of God, a more excellent son then all the
other sons of God, not only more excellent in degree, for gradus non mutat
speciem; but a super-excellent son, who does differ from all his other sons,
plusquam genere aut specie, because he is one God with the Father. Jesus Christ
is truly the Son of God, because he is the true God, 1 John 5. 20. begotten of
the Father, Heb, 1 5. begotten without a mother, Hebr. 7. 3. begotten from the
days of eternity, Micah. 5. 2. a son equal to his Father, who begot him, John
5. 18. Phil. 2. 6. The Son of God, Matthew. 16. 16. the first begotten, and the
only begotten Son of God, the natural and proper Son of God; for he is as the
Father is, God by nature, Gal. 4. 8. and therefore naturally, necessarily,
eternally begotten of the Father in the unity of the Godhead; and therefore
there is more then a graduall, nay more then a specificall or genericall
difference between this and all other sons of God; we see by all these
various expressions, and by those divine and glorious Attributes which are
ascribed to Christ in Scripture, that God has wonderfully declared his love to
us in sending his only begotten to redeem us according to that of the Apostle,
1 John 4. 9. In this was manifest the love of God toward us, because that God
sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him. When
our Savior called God his Father, the Jews did very well understand that he
meant it in a proper and peculiar sense, and therefore told him that he did
make himself equal with God, John 5. 17. 18. and that being but a man he made
himself God, John 10. 33. And though the Jews accused him of blasphemy, and
endeavored to stone him as they pretended for his blasphemy, yet our Savior
does not excuse his speech, or say he meant it in a Metaphorical sense, but
does defend it by many arguments both in the fifth and in the tenth chapters of
Saint John, though he did thereby endanger his life; he says he is equal to
the Father, nay one with the Father, John 5. 18. John 10. 30. and when the High
Priest asked him whether he was the Son of the blessed, Mark 14. 61. our
Savior answers; I am: there is a punctual and positive affirmation of it, v.
62, 63. and you may easily know in what sense the High Priest meant it, by his
renting of his clothes, and condemning our Savior to death for blasphemy, v.
64. And yet our Savior did not endeavor to allay their heat and rage with any
retractation; he would not say that he spoke Metaphorically, for he spoke
properly, he meant that he was the proper and natural Son of God, who had the
same nature and power with the Father, and therefore was able to do, and
actually did the same works with his Father. And the Jews did understand him
so, and therefore urged the Law against him, and condemned him to death for
blasphemy, John 19. 7. The Jews answered him, We have a Law, and by our Law he
ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. Mark the reason, because
he made himself the Son of God; If our Savior had not meant that he was the
proper and natural Son of God, a Son equal to the Father, and one God with
the Father, the Jews would not have accused him of blasphemy.

Moreover the Jews do generally hold that those words of the second Psalm,
Magistri nostri quicquid hoc Psalmo canitur de rege Messia interpretati sunt:
sed secundum verborum sonum, and ob refutationem haereticorum convenit, ut eum
interpretemurde ipso Davide, Heb. bib. mag. cum com. Rab. edit. a Bombergio
Venetiis. Rabbi Solomon. com. in Psalmum secundum.
This day have I begotten thee, are meant of the Messiah, as Rabbi Solomon does
acknowledge in his commentary upon the place. Whatsoever says he is sung in
this Psalm, our Masters have interpreted of King Messiah; but (says he) and
he whispers it as a secret) in regard of the sound of the words, and for the
refutation of Heretics (for so the Jew calls us Christians) we think fit to
expound it of David himself. Here Is a Jew would feign conceal a confessed truth
from Christians, and there are some others it seems that would conceal this
malicious concealment, for these words are expunged out of the great Hebrew
Bibles set forth at Basil, but they are to be found in the Hebrew Bibles set
forth with the Commentaries of the Rabbis at Venice by Bombergius, or else I
had not insisted upon the words; I hope the detecting of this fraud may be very
useful, but I must hasten to some other arguments.

The Socinians t^ll us that there are five Causes of Christ's sonship assigned
in Scripture, which arr all temporal causes, and therefore they see no reason
why we should assert, or they believe this eternal generation of the Son of
God, since Christ may be called the Son of God upon another, and far
different account. We desire to know whether every one of these five causes be
total or perpetual causes; if they be every one a total cause, then there
will be as many sonships as there are causes, no less then five sonships; for
that rule is certain, where there is a total and sufficient cause in act,
there the effect must needs follow. If they be partial causes, then the causes
which succeed in order, do not produce their complete effect, until the last
cause be in act; this we premise, that the vanity of this invention may be more
evident in the whole contexture of their discourse. I shall now give them leave
to speak their mind freely, and fully. ^. The first false cause.


1. The first Cause of this Divine sonship is (as they conceive) the Conception
of Christ by the Holy Ghost, whereby (say they) Christ is said to be begotten
of God in an excellent and peculiar way; and they urge that testimony of the
Angel, which stands upon Record, Luke 1. 35, to make good their conceit; And
the Angel answered, and said unto her: The holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and
the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing
which shall be borne of thee shall be called the Son of God. These words of the
Angel have reference to the prophecy of Isaiah mentioned in the 31. verse of
this first of Luke. The words of Isaiah are, Behold a Virgin shall conceive and
bear a Son, and shall call his name Immanuel, Isaiah 7. 14. they shall call
his name Jesus, Matthew. 1. 21. he shall be called the Son of the highest, the
Son of God, Luke 1. You see the words are different, and therefore we must have
special respect to the thing signified. Observe then

1. That the Prophet did foretell two particulars.

First, that a Virgin should bear a Son.

Secondly, that the Son born of her should be called the Son of God. The Virgin
doubts of the first particular, and enquires how that could be without the
knowledge of a man? The Angel informs her, that she should conceive after a
peculiar and admirable manner by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost; and from
thence infers the second particular, that she should bring forth a Son, who was
to be called the Son of God; and he gives the very same reason which was given
by Saint Matthew, because it was so foretold by the Prophet Isaiah, Matthew, 1.
20, 21, 22. for the particle [Therefore] Luke 1. 35. is not to be referred to
the conception of Christ as the Cause of this divine sonship, but to the
Prophecy of Isaiah recorded Luke 1. 31. for all this was done that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet Matthew. 1. 22.

2. They shall call his name Immanuel, God with us, and therefore he, the same
person shall be called the Son of God; this is an higher reason then that which
the Socinians allege.

3. The Socinians put a Fallacy upon us by assigning that to be the Cause which
is not the true Cause, Fallacia non causae, quum non causa pro causa ponitur.
[he shall be called] that is declared and acknowledged to be the Son of God.
This Declaration or manifestation of the Son of God in the flesh was temporal,
1 Timothy 3. 16. but his generation was eternal, Micah 5. 2. The Son of God was
sent, manifested, incarnate, in the fullness of time, Gal. 4. 4. but he was the
Son of God before his Incarnation, and therefore his Incarnation is not the
cause of his divine sonship, the effect cannot be before the cause, but the
divine sonship of Christ was before the world was. The Holy Ghost is never
called the Father of Christ, and he could not be the principle of the
subsistence or the Word, and therefore not the Cause of this divine sonship.
The Apostle states the point, and puts it past all dispute, Romans 1. 3, 4.
Christ was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, but determined and
declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness
by the resurrection from the dead; from whence it follows directly that Christ
is not properly the Son of God according to the flesh, but is in that
consideration rather to be called the Son of David as we observed above,
because Christ came of David as concerning the flesh; but the eternal Son of
God, is God blessed for ever, Romans 9. 5. When the Jews said that our Savior
blasphemed, because he made himself God, John 10, 33. Christ asks them whether
they did accuse him of blasphemy, because he said he was the son of God? v. 36.
whereby he declared that he was the Son of God according to his person which is
truly divine; believe (says he) that the Father is in me and I in him, v. 38.
The force of his answer is evident: I am in the Father, and the Father in me,
and therefore I am a divine person; I am the Son of God, and therefore the
divine nature is communicated to my person, I am begotten in the unity of the
God. head, I am in the Father, and therefore if it be no blasphemy for me to
say that I am the Son of God, it is no blasphemy at all to say that I am God,
because the divine nature is communitated to the natural and proper Son of
God; there is the proper reason why Christ is called the Son of God, because the
divine nature was communicated to him by an eternal generation.

Socinians why Christ is called the Son of God, The second false cause. John
10. 35. 36. explained and vindicated.
is the sanctification of Christ, for which they cite John 10. 35, 36. Behold
say they the second cause of this divine sonship plainly set forth unto us,
Christ has obtained an excellent portion of the Spirit, he is sanctified and
sent with a divine power into the world to save mankind.

To which we answer, that here is the same fallacy obtruded again, because 1.
Christ was the Son of God before he was sent into the world. 2. God did not
give the spirit by measure to him, John 3. 34. 3. Christ proves in that tenth
chapter of John, that he is one with his Father in power, and therefore in
nature, as appears

1. Because he does the same works that his Father does, v. 37.

2. Because he is in his Father, and his Father in him, v. 38.

3. Because he is the Natural Son of God, and therefore might truly call
himself God, v. 33. 36.

4. Because they themselves called Magistrates Gods, upon a cheaper account;
only in regard of their Commission and Office; much more might he call himself
God, because he was sanctified without measure, had an higher office and
Commission, being sent to do the work of God, to satisfy the justice of God,
and save the elect of God, which he could not have done if he had not had the
Nature of God, and been thereby fully enabled to perfect this work of God. The
Argument is grounded upon the infinite distance, and imparity between the
office of a Mediator, and the office of a Magistrate; between the only
begotten Son of God, who is one with his Father, who begot him, and the Sons of
men who are but the Deputies of God.

III. The third Cause which they assign of this divine sonship, The third
false cause. Matt. 3. 1^.
is the special love of the Father to this excellent Son, Matthew. 3. 17.

To this we answer, that God did not make Christ his Son because he loved him,
but he loves him because he is his Son, a Son equal to himself, one with
himself, the express Image of his person, the illustrious brightness of his
glory. That very place which they cite makes much against them: God does from
heaven own Christ for his proper and natural Son in that very place, Matthew. 3.
17. God said not so to the best of Angels, Hebr. 1. 4. 5 To which of the Angels
said he at any time, Caelitus clamavit Pa^er Hic est filius ille meus, u^
testatum faceret hunc esse proprium suum naturalem fil^um, e numero aliorum
filiorum eo ipso exemptum.
Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee? that one place is sufficient to
discover the fraud of the Socinians in this point.

The fourth false cause.
because when Christ was raised from the dead he was as it were begotten again
from the dead, Acts 13. 32, 33.

To which we answer, Genui Ps. 2. prop^ie significat generationem aeternam.
Genui Act 13. significat Metonymi ce, hoc est genitu^ patefeci ho^ie, cum te
excitavi a ^m r^uis, R^m. 1. 4. explici^e dicuntur verba ista Psalm. 2. de
generatione, implicit and consequenter autem resurrectioni accommodantur;
consequenter inquam non ratione consequentis sed consequentiae. Vide D. Gomari
Analys. Epist. ad Hebraeos page 299.
that Christ was the Natural and Proper Son of God before his Resurrection,
only he was declared to be the Son of God by his Resurrection, according to
that of the Apostle, Romans 1. v. 4. Declared to be the Son of God with power
according to the spirit of holiness, (that is his divine nature) by the
resurrection from the dead. Christ was not made but declared to be the Son of
God by his Resurrection. His divine sonship lay hid under the form of a
servant before; only they who had spiritual eyes did discern it, John 1. 14.
we have seen, and beheld the glory of the only begotten Son of God. Moreover it
is observable that the Apostle endeavors to make the mystery of Christ's divine
sonship manifest in the thirteenth of the Acts, not simply by his Resurrection,
but by the manner of his Resurrection, and the state whereunto he was raised.

1. For the manner, he was raised by his own Almighty and most glorious power
in an irresistible way; he did offer violence to all the forces of death and
powers of the grave, because it was not possible that he should be holden of
them, Acts ^. 24. when he came to declare himself to be the Son of God with
power, Romans 1. 4.

2 For the state whereunto he was raised, he did not rise to return to the
grave again, as Lazarus did, but he raised himself to an immortal life. And as
concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to
corruption, Acts 13. 34. Romans 6. 9.

Now, God by raising Christ after such a manner, to such a state, did declare
him to be his only begotten Son, of whom David speaks in the second Psalm, and
therefore it was evident by the Resurrection of Christ, that God had fulfilled
his promise by sending his only begotten Son to be a Savior unto Israel, that
we might have forgiveness of sins and all sure mercies by him who died for our
sins, and rose again for our justification; this is the scope of the Apostles
discourse in the thirteenth of the Acts from the 23 verse to the 39^ The second
Psalm is cited here by Accommodation to make good a remote and Implicit
consequence; as those words, I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, etc. are cited to
prove a resurrection by an Implicit consequence, Matthew. 22. 31, 32. Thou art my
Son, mine own proper Son, whom I own for my only begotten Son by raising thee
to a never dying life.

The fifth Cause which they assign, The fifth false cause.
is the Exaltation of our Lord and Savior to glory, and the conferring of a
Name and Power upon him above all creatures; for the Apostle, as they conceive,
speaks of this sonship, Hebr. 5. 5. So also Christ glorified not himself to be
made an High Priest, but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I
begotten thee.

I cannot but admire that the acute Socinians should cite every place where the
second Psalm is named, to prove that there are so many several causes of the
divine sonship of Christ; but I do more admire that they should cite this Text
of all the rest; for if their fifth argument have any force in it, does
overthrow and disprove their four first arguments. If Christ was not begotten
before his exaltation to glory, then he was not the Son of God before his
exaltation; for surely these men of reason, will easily grant that the effect
cannot be before its proper and complete cause was in its causall actuality, or
actual causality.

The words of God in the second Psalm are so often repeated, to teach us to
keep our eye constantly fixed upon the divine sonship of Christ when ever we
discourse of his conception, birth, resurrection, transfiguration, exaltation
to glory, and conclude that the self-same person who was begotten of God from
the days of eternity took our flesh, dyed for our sins, and rose for our
justification; for this is that great and fundamental truth which runs quite
through the Gospel, That the Son of Mary who did and suffered all for us, is the
proper, the natural Son of God, the only and All-sufficient Savior of his
people from their sins. We must not part with this truth, for this is all our
salvation.

It was very proper for the Apostle to speak of his divine sonship when ever he
spoke of him as a Mediator, as a Priest, etc. because he could not have
undertaken or gone through with any such office unless he had been the Natural
and Proper Son of God equal to God; and therefore we do readily grant, that
the divine offices of Christ do declare and make manifest the divine sonship,
and nature of Jesus Christ, and this truth is most evident from the connection
of the seven and eight verses of the second Psalm.

I have with the more patience and content waded through this large and deep sea
that I might come to the haven, where we desire to be; That we might come to
take harbor and sanctuary in the merit and satisfaction of Jesus Christ, who
is the natural and proper Son of God.

In the next place I am to prove the eternal procession of the Holy Ghost,
whereby I shall make the distinction of the Persons more clear and evident,
and therefore I hasten to the discussing of that mysterious, but useful point.

The Holy Spirit is not called a spirit because of his spiritual nature only,
Concerning the Procession of the Holy Ghost. Spiritus dicitur non respectu
spiritualis essentiae, sed Incommunicabilis subsistentiae, quia a Patre and
Filio una quasi spiranti^bus procedit.
for the same spiritual nature is common to all the three blessed Persons; but
he is called a Spirit upon a special and peculiar reason because he is breathed
forth by the Father and the Son. The Holy Ghost is called the Spirit which is
of God, 1 Cor. 2. 1^. (...). The Spirit who proceeds from the Father is sent
by the Son from the father, John 15. 26. The Greek Church acknowledges that the
Spirit does proceed from the Father by the Son. All things that the Father has
are mine, says our Savior, John 16. 15. But the Spirit did receive all from
the Father, and Christ and his Father are essentially one John 10. 30. the
Spirit is said to receive of the Son, and to glorify the Son, John 16. 14.
Whatsoever things the Father does, the Son does; and as the Son can do nothing
without the Father, so the Father can do nothing without the Son; not that
there is a defect of power in either, but an unity of power and nature in both*

The divine nature of both the Father and the Son was communicated to the
Spirit by this eternal spiration, and therefore he is sent by both, and he
receives of both, and he glorifies both, and he is the Spirit of both the
Father and the Son. He is called the Spirit of the Father, Matthew. 10. 20
because he proceeds from the Father John 15. 26. and he is called the Spirit
of the Son of God, Gal. 4. 6. the Spirit of Christ, Romans 8. 9. the Spirit of
Jesus Christ Phil. 1. 19. the Spirit of Christ, 1 Pet. 1. 11. because he
receives of Christ, is sent from Christ, is breathed forth by Christ; the
Father and the Son breath forth the subsistence of the Spirit with one and the
same spirati on. When Christ breathed upon his Disciples, he said, Receive ye
the Holy Ghost, to show that he had power to dispose of the Spirit, who did
from all eternity breath forth the Spirit. The Holy Ghost was breathed forth
necessarily by both; I say, necessarily, because eternally there was a double
and eternal necessity of it both in respect of the persons breathing, and the
person breathed. The spirit was not breathed forth as a creature, but as a
divine person, a person of the Godhead; he was breathed forth by Procession,
and subsists in the unity of the Godhead; he proceeds from both, and yet in
both; for one divine person cannot subsist out of another, but all three
subsist in the same undivided and infinite nature.

But the Socinians tell us that the Holy Ghost is nothing else but the power
and virtue of God the Father. In what sense the H. Ghost is the virtue and
power of the Father.


To which we answer. That the Spirit is the natural virtue of the Father no
more then he is the natural virtue of the Son, or of himself; for the virtue
of God is the essence of God; the Holy Ghost is his own essence, and all three
persons have one and the same essence; The Holy Ghost who proceeds from the
Father, is called the Power of the Father, Luke 1. 35. because the spirit works
as he proceeds in order; the Father works in the Son and by the Spirit. But the
Spirit who proceeds from the Father is distinguished from the Father; the
Spirit did not breath forth himself, or proceed from himself. The H. Ghost does
not speak of himself, John 16. 13. but the Father speaks of himself, because he
is of himself, he is begotten of none, proceeds from none of the divine
persons, is sent by none of them. The holy Ghost does receive of Christ, is
sent by Christ; therefore the Holy Ghost is not the Father, but clearly
distinguished from him, John 16. 14, 15. John 15. 26. John 14. 16, 17, Matthew.
3. 16, 17. Matthew. 28. 19. 2 Cor. 13. 14. and in diverse other places. The
Father and the Spirit are personally distinguished, but they are essentially
one, 1 John 5. 7. they are one in Power, Nature, Will, and yet are three
Persons, three Witnesses who deliver one and the same divine testimony; (...) 1
Cor. 2. 11 (...) 1 Cor. 2. 12. 1 Cor. 12. 5* 6. Acts 5. 3. 4. 1 Cor. 3. 16, 17.
The testimony of the Holy Ghost is as divine as the testimony of God the
Father. The Witness of God is greater, verse 9. must refer to the Witness of
the Father, Word and Spirit, verse 7. though the testimony of the Father be
specially insisted on in the following words; for all the three Witnesses in
heaven give one and the same testimony, and that testimony is divine. The H.
Ghost is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit which is of God, Romans 8. 11* 14. 1
Cor. 12* 3. Isa. 6^ 1. Isa. 63. 14.
the Spirit of Elohim, Genesis 1. 2. the Spirit of Jehovah, Isa. 11. 2. the Spirit
which is Jehovah and the God of Israel, as has been proved at large in the
fourth chapter from the 31. page to the fortieth. The distinction between the
Father and the Spirit will be more evident when we come to treat of the
personal properties; The Socinians are so confounded in this point, Vide
Eniedin. in Explicat. loc. v. and N. T. p^g. 288. 289. Ca^e chis. Racov. cap.
6. Ostorod Instit. c. 4. Smalcium in (...). Graweri. p. 6. Smalcium contra
Wi^k. vesp. ad cap. 15.
that they are forced to acknowledge that the Holy Ghost is no Accidental
virtue, no finite substance, no creature, but the uncreated and substantial
virtue or power of God, because whatsoever is in God, is the substance of God;
as Eniedinus confesses. And Smalcius acknowledges that it may be granted that
the Holy Ghost is God, because whatsoever is naturally in God may be called
God. But I shall prove that the Holy Ghost is not only God, but a person of the
Godhead distinct from the Father and the Son. Jesus Christ is called the Power
of God, 1 Cor. 1. 24. and the Holy Ghost the Power of God, Luke 1. 35, Luke 24,
49. The Son is a distinct Person from the Father; and the Holy Ghost is as the
Ancients used to call him, the Personal virtue or Power of the Father
proceeding from the Father, by whom he does declare and put forth his power; 1
Cor. 12.
and therefore the Spirit is said to work and distrioute all gifts and graces
as he will; Father, Son and Holy Ghost have one and the same Will and Power;
still we must bottom upon that truth, These three are one, 1 John 5. 7. That
this Procession of the Holy Ghost is mysterious, and for the manner of it
unsearchable we do readily grant; and therefore I shall not presume to define
after what manner the Holy Ghost is breathed forth from the Father and the Son;
but we are sure that it cannot be any corporeal procession. The Ancients did
constantly distinguish between Procession and Generation; but the eternal
generation of Christ being spiritual, Non omne quod procedit Nascitur, qua^vis
omne procedat quod nascitur. Vide August. contra Maximin. lib. 3. cap. 14.
the procession of the Spirit must needs be spiritual; for the Spirit is not
only Essentially a Spirit as the Father, and God the Son are, but he is
Personally a Spirit. The more perfect and spiritual this procession is, the
more evident it is that the Spirit was breathed forth in the unity of the
Godhead. They who say the Son does proceed from the Father* use that term
[Proceed] in a general and very large signification: 1. The manner of the
divine Processions.
but then they say that the Son did proceed by Generation, the Spirit by
Spiration thereby endeavoring to distinguish the manner of proceeding. 2. They
say the Son did proceed from the Father alone, 2. The Principle.
and therefore is aid to be sent by the Father only; but the Holy Ghost did
proceed from the Father and the Son both, and therefore is said to be sent by
the Son as well as the Father, Luke 24. 49. John 15. 26. John 14. 26. John 16.
14. but Christ is sent by the Father only, because he is of the Father only,
and was not begotten of the Spirit; and the Father is not sent by any because
he is of himself; hereby they endeavor to distinguish the Principle of these
Divine processions. 3. The Son did proceed as the second person, 3 The Order.
the holy Ghost as the third person of the Godhead, and hereby they endeavor
to distinguish the order of these divine processions. We know this divine
procession is 1. Spiritual. 2. Eternal, because divine. 3. Immutable; this
procession is not a change of the Spirit from not being to being, Pater and
filius spirando spiritu^ naturam divinam communicant spiritui, ita ut tribus
Deitatis personis communis sit: non est haec Ali^natio sed Communicatio.
or from an imperfect being to a more perfect being. We know that procession
cannot be a motion from one place to another, for the Spirit is omnipresent,
fills all places, and therefore cannot change its place. 4. Necessary. The
Father and Son did from all eternity breath forth the Spirit in the unity of
the Godhead, not by any alienation of the Godhead from themselves, but by an
unspeakable communication of the same divine Nature to a third person of the
Godhead; And this communication is natural, and therefore necessary it is, but
not Involuntary; the Father and Son did not breath forth the Spirit by any
Coaction or Compulsion: Spiritus Sanctus procedit nonvoluntate ut Scholastici,
and post eos Catechismus Romanus ambigue docuerunt, sed necessitate naturae
qu^admodum and filius natura genitus est. Paternon spirat sine filio, non ob
defectum potentiae sed ob unitatem essentiae. Spiritus Procedit ab utroque
subsistit in utroque quia est coessentialis utrique, 1 Johan. 5. 7. and proinde
haec aeterna Spiratio non est contingens sed necessaria; nec libera est nec
Involuntaria. Neque enim necessitas haec vim infert, nec voluntas novum
concilium desig^at ex deliberatione superveniens. Vide Athanas. Basilium,
Cyrillum, Nazianzenum, Theodoretum, Damascenum. Vide Gomarum, D. Alting^um,
Maccovium, Zanchium, Tilenum, Crocium, Stegmanum, Polan. Syntag. lib. 3. de
Trinitate cap. 6.
and yet we cannot say that the Father and the Son did Arbitrarily or freely
breath forth the Spirit as all three persons did create the world; for they did
create the world with such liberty and freedom as that they might not have
created it; but they did Naturally and necessarily breath forth the Spirit, and
could not but breath him forth: this inward and personal Act is Natural; such
is the perfection of the Godhead that it must needs be communicated to all
three persons; and such is the coessentiall unity of the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost, as that all three do necessarily and naturally subsist in the self-same
entire and infinite Godhead. True it is, that the will of God is the Nature of
God, but nature is a more comprehensive Word, and therefore according to our
manner of apprehension and in strictness of speech, it is more proper to say
that the Father and the Son did breath forth the Spirit by the perfection of
their Nature, then to say they breathed him forth of their own will, or by some
Arbitrary Decree; for then it will follow that there might have been but two
persons of, and in the Godhead, that the holy Spirit does exist and subsist
Contingently, and by consequent that the Spirit is no person of the Godhead.
The acute Samosatenian whom learned Iunius confutes, desired to know whether
the Holy Ghost was produced by an action of the Will;


Iunius answers; Iunius Cathol. Doct. de Trinitdefen. contra Samosat. page 36
Spiritus Sanctus procedit Naturalite^, hoc est action Naturae, non autem
voluntatis. Periculos^ dicitur spiritum procedere natura quide^ sed per
actionem voluntatis: Non procedit action voluntatis proprie, sed secundum
actionem voluntatis procedere dicitur, id est secundum eamactionem, vel potius
secundum eum modum quo naturaliter procedunt voluntas and charitas. De hac re
igitur possemus tacere, and rem Scholasticis defendendam permittere, aut ad
libros eorum reijcere.
If you oppose the will of God to the nature of God, we cannot say that the
Spirit does proceed from the Father and the Son by their will but by their
nature, because the Father, Son and Spirit are Coessentiall; for as the Father
did beget his Natural Son by his Nature, so do the Father and the Son breath
forth the coessentiall Spirit by their nature; nor is it safe to say, says
Iunius, that the nature of the Father does breath forth the Spirit by an action
of his will, but rather according to that manner (the infinite distance being
observed between what is humane and divine) after which the will does proceed
in man: and this says he is but a weak resemblance of the Schools, which we
are not bound to defend. For the Nature of God is pure, single, infinite, and
therefore we must not follow those resemblances too far which are grounded
upon the distinction of the understanding and the will in creatures, because
even that point is very disputable, and the most single and perfect nature of
God does infinitely transcend the perfection of Angels. I believe you are, as I
am, willing to get out of the dark. But enough of that, for we read that the
Saints are begotten by the will of God, James 1. 18. But we must not conceive
that Christ is begotten, or the Spirit breathed forth after the same manner as
we are regenerated: the Spirit is breathed forth in a Connaturall and
Coessentiall way in the unity of the single and entire Godhead; but we are
regenerated by the graces of God.

The spirit does proceed equally from the Father and the Son; for the unity of
the divine nature, and equality of divine persons cannot be maintained if that
principle be denied. Peter Lombard and his adherents did mince the point with a
very dangerous distinction: that the Spirit does proceed principally from the
Father, and less principally from the Son. But it is clear and evident that
the Holy Ghost being a Coessential person has the self-same divine nature and
essence entirely communicated unto him which is in the Father and the Son,
without any Alienation of it from them, or Multiplication of it in him; and
therefore the Spirit does not proceed from the Father and Son as they stand in
Relative opposition, but as they are essentially and naturally one; and
therefore the Spirit did proceed from both equally, aeque primo ac per se, as
we use to say. The Spirit does receive from Christ, John 16. 14, 15. but the
Spirit being God could not receive any thing but subsistence from the Father or
the Son. The Spirit does glorify the Son, John 16. 14. no otherwise then the
Son as God does glorify the Father: because the Son did receive his
subsistence from the Father as the Spirit receives his subsistence from the
Father and the Son.

We must carefully distinguish 1. Between the generation of the Son, and
procession of the holy Spirit, though as we have shown above, the Son does
proceed, if you take that word in a general notion. The most exact Critics will
not take upon them to distinguish between (...) and (...). Yet because we want
words to express our selves, the reverend Doctors of the Church thought fit to
appropriate Procession to the Holy Ghost for distinction sake; and the
Scripture says that Christ is the only begotten Son of God; God the Father is
never called the Father of the H. Ghost; nor is the H. Ghost called the Son of
God. Moreover, the Schoolmen have given advantage to the enemies of the Trinity
by discoursing of Divine Processions at large in a general notion; and for
these reasons I did endeavorto distinguish the Procession of the Son from the
Spirit in this Chapter, in respect of the Manner, Principle, and order of
Procession.

2. We must carefully distinguish between the Eternal Procession of the
Spirit, and the Temporal Mission of the Spirit; but the Natural and Eternal
Procession of the Spirit may be evinced by the Temporal Mission of the Spirit.
The Greek Church does acknowledge, 1. that the Holy Ghost is God; and 2. that
he is one and the same God with the Father and the Son; and from hence we infer,

1. That the Son did not send the Spirit by way of Command as if he were
greater then the Spirit.

2. That the Son did not send the Spirit by way of Counsel and Advice, as if he
were wiser then the Spirit; and therefore the only reason why he did Temporally
send him, is, because the Spirit did Naturally and Eternally proceed from him,
and receive his glorious subsistence of him. I might discourse more largely
upon this subject; Vide Athanasium 1. Dialog. de Trimtate Damasc. n. de fide
Orthod. Modom Curiositati imponat Lector, nec molesta* and perplexas
disputationes cupidius quam par sit sibi accersat. Calv. Instit. lib. 1. cap.
13.
but I consider what Athanasius, Damascen, and diverse other reverend Divines
who did long study these mysterious points, have after many perplexed debates
acknowledged. The Son (say they) was begotten* and the Spirit proceeded; this
we are sure of, because it is written; if you enquire after the manner how the
one was begotten, and how the other did proceed, we answer that the Son was
begotten* and the Spirit did proceed eternally, unchangeably, unspeakably.

Those places of Scripture which are spoken of God in the Old Testament are
said to be spoken of the Son, and the Spirit in the New Testament, and
therefore do by consent of both Testaments, declare that the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost are one and the same God; for instance, The sixth of Isaiah is
spoken of Jehovah, the God of Israel, whom the Mahumetans, Sabellians and
Arrians do acknowledge to be the true God, but this is spoken of Christ says
Saint John, chap. 12. 41. These things said Isaiah when he saw his glory and
spoke of him. But the Holy Ghost has his share in this prophecy, Acts ^8. 25.
therefore they who believe both ^estaments, must conclu^e that the Father, Son
and the Holy Ghost are one and the same God.

Finally, the Personal actions and properties of these three declare them to
be distinct persons; therefore it is easy to conclude that Father, Son and H.
Ghost are three distinct persons, and yet one and the same God.

That the Spirit is a person of the Godhead, has been proved in the fourth
chapter of this Book; That he is a distinct person from the Father and the Son,
is most clear by that which has been said both in that chapter and in this*
and all those places might be heaped up which prove the personal appearance of
the Spirit, when he did assume the shape of a Dove, and appeared as in Tongues
of fire, Scriptura Neutro Antecedenti relativum masculini generis statim
subjicit* Johan. 15 26 (...) non (...): item Johan. 16, 13. 14. Ephesians. 1. 13, 14.
his teaching, leading, acting, ruling, comforting, distributing of gifts and
the like, together with the several phrases of him in Scripture, and frequent
joining him with the Father and Son as their equal in power and authority in
bestowing all spiritual and eternal blessings do evince the same. The notes of
distinction Another, even the Spirit; These three, etc. The change of the
gender in relative Articles, which must necessarily be referred to the Spirit,
is very considerable. But I have said more then enough upon this point, and
therefore proceed to make the distinction of these three uncreated

V. These uncreated persons are sufficiently distinguished by their Order. The
uncreated Persons distinguished by their order.
The Scripture does most commonly place the Father first in order, the Son
second, the Holy Ghost third, when all three are named; and by the inward and
personal actions (which have been mentioned) it does appear, that, this is the
Natural Order of these uncreated Persons; for the Son cannot be placed in
Order before the Father, because he is naturally begotten of the Father; the
Holy Ghost cannot be placed in order before the Son, because he does naturally
proceed from the Son: Vide Basilei Magni Epistolam quae in scribitur (...).
Edit. Basil. Gr. p* 330.
this is the proper and natural order. Basil the great in his (...) complains
that some in his time did place the Son in order before the Father, and the
Holy Ghost before the Son, that they might gain some advantage by that device.
Basil tells them that he had received order from the Lord to Baptize in the name
of the Father Son and Holy Ghost, and therefore was resolved to preserve that
order (...) inviolable, notwithstanding any devices or attempts for to prevent
it. When the Witnesses in Heaven are reckoned up in a business of the highest
consequence, they are reckoned in this very order* 1 John 5. 7. The Father, the
Word, and the Spirit. But it is confessed that sometimes it is most agreeable
to the scope and purpose of the Holy Ghost to place the Son before the Father*
as appears 2 Cor. 13. 13. Gal. 1. 1. and hence it is likewise, that the Holy
Spirit is sometimes placed before the Son, as Revel. 1. 4, 5. and sometimes
before the Father and the Son, 1 Cor. 12 4, 5, 6. But the natural order does
not overthrow either the equality or coeternity of the Persons, nor does that
order of Enumeration which is pro instituto, overthrow the natural order, and
both do sufficiently prove the distinction of the three uncreated Persons.

VI. The Divine Persons are sufficiently distinguished by their Personal
Properties; The property of the Father is to subsist of himself, Pater (...) a
Doctoribus Orthodoxis dicitur Negative, quia a nullo est sed a ^eipso, and per
seipsum ab omni aet^rnitate subsistit.
that is, to receive subsistence or subsisting life from none but himself. I
shall not enter into that sad dispute whether this Personal Property be
Absolute or Relative? whether (...) does not import something as Omnis
proprietas increata per negationem explicata funda^ur in aliqua perfectione
positiva
Positive and absolute as (...)? It is pleaded that the self subsistence of
the Father is not his Fatherhood: and that that rule is beyond dispute, Habere
subsistentiam a se non dicit respectum ad Aliud, vel Al^um; And therefore I
humbly offer it to the consideration of the learned, whether that self
subsistence whereby the first person is d^stinguished from the Son and the
Spirit be Absolute, or Relative? I will not take upon me to determine any thing
in so deep a point, or suffer my reason to wax wild and wanton in discoursing
of so great a mystery: and therefore though there be something hinted which may
amount to a videtur quod sic in the behalf of the less common opinion in the
142* age of this book: and it is clear that all three Persons are nothing else
but the Godhead considered with all absolute and Relative perfection, yet I
conceive it safest to wave that point, and conclude with that learned divine,
Nos fidelem ignorantiae professionem temerariae assertioni praeferendam
judicamus. Whether then this self-subsistence be Absolute or Relative, it is
enough for our present purpose to prove that the first Person of the Godhead is
distinguished by his self-subsistence from the blessed Son and holy Spirit. The
self-subsistence of the Father is Incommunicable, It is proper and peculiar to
the first Person to have subsistence from none but himself* and to be the
first Personal Principle which gives subsistence to the other two coessentiall
and coequall persons. The Son receives subsistence from the Father, the Spirit
receives subsistence from the Father and the Son, as has been proved above;
and therefore this self-subsistence does make a very remarkable, and undeniable
difference between the Father and the two other uncreated Persons.

Some learned men have from hence inferred, that because the Father alone has
subsistence from himself, therefore the Father alone is God of himself.

But the consequence is absurd, for they do not distinguish between the Essence
of God and the peculiar subsistences, in the Godhead. The Essence of God is
(...). and is one and the same in all, and every one of the uncreated Persons:
it is (if I may so speak) a self-essence and essence it self a self-Deity,
because every one of the Persons is truly, properly, essentially God, God
himself; and therefore if the Essence of the Father be a self-Deity, so is the
Essence of the Son and Spirit. The Divine Essence of the Son is not begotten,
caused, produced any more then the Essence of the Father; the subsistence of
the Son is begotten, but not caused; the Divine Essence is communicated to the
Son, but it is not begotton by the Father; for the Father does communicate that
self same Divine and entire Essence, which is in himself, by begetting the
personal subsistence of the Son in the Unity of the Godhead from the days of
eternity. Christ is not God by grace, but by nature; and the Will of the Father
did not precede and produce the Godhead in Christ, but accompany and approve
the natural communication of the Godhead to Christ, even as his Will does
approve his own natural and eternal goodness; and therefore Christ is both his
natural Son, Vide Genebrardum lib. 1. de Trinitate
as has been proved, and the Son of his love, Coloss. 1. 13. Genebrardus was
too blame to fall foul upon Calvin and Beza, and other reformed Writers whom
he condemns as guilty of a new Heresy called Autotheanisme, because they said
that Christ was God of himself, but he was not the Son of himself. Calvin and
Beza did not deny that the Godhead was from all eternity communicated to the
Son by the Father; only they say,

1. That the Godhead which is communicated is in it self, of it self truly,
properly, essentially Divine; because the selfsame Godhead is in the Father
and Son whole and entire in both.

2. Because the Godhead which is communicated, is not begotten; the unbegotten
Godhead is communicated to the only begotten Son by an eternal generation.

3* Because the Godhead which is communicated, Solus Pater est (...) id est
anullo superiore Numine Essentiatus sed a seipso Deus. Val. Genesis P^o the 8. 12.
40. and ultima.
is not caused, produced, created by the Father, as Valentinus Gentilis dreamt.
And therefore Genebrardus, Canisius, Gifford, Stapleton, Faber Fevardentius,
and the rest are extremely mistaken, when they say that Calvin and Beza deny
that the Father did beget his Son in the unity of his own divine essence; For
the meaning of Calvin was plainly this, The Son has the selfsame divine
nature with the Father, they are Coessential: one and the same God who is the
only true God, God of himself, not God by participation, or creation, but God
by nature and essence; for Calvin speaks in opposition to Valentinus Gentilis,
who denies the Son and Spirit to be coessentiall with the Father, but says the
Father did essentiate the Son with another manner of essence then his own
divine essence, namely with a created and produced essence. Gentilis says, the
Father only is truly God, because he only has an increated Godhead, and the
Son has not the self-same Godhead with the Father.

I had not said so much on this Argument but that I find Papists, Arminians,
Socinians, and some bitter Lutherans do all join their forces to abuse Calvin,
Beza, Viret, Farrell, Simler, Volanus, Gualter, Bullinger, Lavater, the
Orthodox Helvetians, and many other reformed Writers upon this Argument. Some
say these reverend Divines are guilty of Heresy, Blasphemy, Atheism, because
they say Christ is God of himself, though they clearly mean that he is one God
with his Father, and that the Godhead which is communicated to the Son by
generation is an unbegotten Godhead, a self-Deity. If any one desire to read
more upon this Argument, he may consult Valentinus Gentilis, and all that write
against him, especially Calvin, and the rest of the Reformed Writers named but
now: he may read the Ancients, with whom Arminius was not well acquainted; for
if he had read them, he would not have said that the word (...) is not to be
found in the writings of the Fathers.

They who are taken with Platonical raptures may read Dionysius, Plato's
corrivall; Maximus Pachymerius and the rest, will give them some light therein.
Athanasius, Basil, Epiphanius, Nazianzen, Damascen, speak the same thing either
(...) or (...); to whom I might add Justin Martyr, Anastasius and Cyrill; as
for Origin, I know his writings have been extremely corrupted by the iniquity
of his Antagonists, and yet there are many things that are excellent in him,
which I am in charity obliged to conceive to be his genuine and proper
judgment, and to impute many of his errors to the fraud, ignorance, or malice
of such as made too bold with his Works, or else to a kind of liberty of
speaking, which good wits are not free from, when they have no adversary in
sight who is like to call them to an account for their irregular phrases.
Bellarmine is as modest, Bellar. l. 2. de Christ. c. 19.
as we could expect such a sophister to be; only he did not take notice of the
controversy between Calvin and Gentilis; but we will pardon that error; for we
know the Cardinal was not at leisure, and therefore did many times pass
sentence upon the Protestants for expedition sake before he had heard their
cause. Gregory de Valentia is very ingenuous in this point, Greg. Valent. part.
1. disp. 2. quaest. 1. punct. 1. page 718.
and makes a fair Apology for the Autotheans. If any desire to take a shorter
cut, I shall refer them to three most eminent Divines who have studied this
point exactly, and are very critical both in state of the question, and their
phrases, Chamier, Gomarus and Voetius; and now, I crave leave to proceed
without beging pardon for this necessary digression, because I hope it may be
very useful to learned men.

It is now easy upon the due consideration of the premises to state the point
right. It is proper to the Father to have,

1. The Godhead without any communication of it to him from any other uncreated
Person.

2. To have subsistence from, and of himself as he is the first Person, and
the first personal Principle of giving subsisting life unto the other two
Coessentiall Persons. For the first uncreated Person cannot receive subsistence
from any person, because he is the first person in order, though all three be
equal in respect of dignity and duration; there can be no person in order
before the first Person to communicate his Godhead, or give personal
subsistence to him either by generation or spiration, and this must needs be a
Characteristicall and distinctive property which declares the subsistence of
the Father to be incommunicable. For though all three uncreated persons do
subsist in the Godhead, Eadem essentia est in Patre (...), in Filio (...), in
Spiritu Sancto (...).
yet self-subsistence is proper to the Father; the Father alone is the first
personal principle of subsisting life; the Father is distinguished from the
Son, because the Father is unbegotten, and because he did beget the Son; the
Father is distinguished from the Spirit, because he did breath forth the
Spirit. But I have said enough of that when I treated above of the inward and
personal actions. I need not take notice of their nice exception who say the
Father is not his own Father, and therefore cannot be said to be begotten of
himself, or to have subsistence from himself; yet because some take advantage
thereby to censure the reverend Doctors of the Church, (...). Hesychius Suidas.
I shall stop the Critics mouths with one Criticisme out of Hesychius and
Suidas, To be begotten of ones self (says Hesychius) is to be begotten of
none. God is said to be begotten of himself because he is unbegotten; and
Suidas concurs, and does either transcribe or subscribe. No man ever dreamt
that the Father did beget either his Godhead, or his own personal subsistence:
for the Godhead were no Godhead if it were begotten; and we know the Father is
not his own Father though Synesius and some such Poetical wits who meant well
have adventured upon such dangerous expressions. -- (...).
It does imply a contradiction that any thing should be the cause of it self,
or its own effect, for the cause is before the effect, Vocis sono (...)
negativus terminus est sed reipsa affirmat. D. Gerrard de Tribus Elohim. cap.
8. Sect. 50. page 175.
and nothing can be before and after it self; and there is a friendly
opposition between correlates; the Father cannot be his own Son. But
notwithstanding all that has been alleged by these Critical disputants,
still it holds good that the Godhead was not communicated to God the Father by
any person created or uncreated, and the first person did not receive his
personal subsistence from any other person by generation, spiration, or any
other way. But I must not dwell upon this Argument.

VII. The uncreated persons are sufficiently distinguished by their personal
and inward relations; The Persons distinguished by their inward Relations.
but we must not conceive that there are as many Persons in the Godhead, as
there are Relations; for the Father is related to the Son and to the Spirit;
Spiratio non est fundamentum relationis personalis hoc est propriae and
peculiaaris; relatio autem distinguit vel qua propriavel qua opposita;
paternitas and spiratio, Item filiatio and spiratio non opponuntur, non sunt
proprietates peculiaries and incommunicabiles, and proinde non distingunt;
relationes dicunt, sed non Personales proprias and oppositas. Vide Tho. part.
1. quest. 30. art. 2. An distinctio inter essentiam and relationem s^t Realis,
formalis, vel rationis. Vide Biol. 1. s^nt. did. 2. qu. 11. and did. 26. qu.
1. art. 3. Vide Basilium etiam contra Eunomium. lib. 2. p. 134.
and the Son is related to the Father and to the Spirit; and the Spirit is
related to the Father and the Son. But there is a friendly opposition evidenced
by some Relations which do help together with the Actions, Order and Properties
above mentioned to demonstrate some kind of distinction between the Persons;
The Son as he is a Son, is Relatively opposed to the Father who begat him; and
so the Spirit as proceeding by spiration is Relatively opposed to the Father
and the Son who did both join in breathing forth the holy Spirit; Relations
distinguish as proper, and opposite.

I might discourse concerning the Order of these persons in working, as well as
of their order in subsisting; something might be spoken of the peculiar manner
of their working ad extra: and much might be said of the Incarnation of the Son
to declare him to be distinct from the Father and the Spirit; and something of
the effusion of the Spirit; but I have said enough to evidence that these
uncreated Persons are distinguished; What kind of distinction there is between
these three divine and uncreated Persons.
what kind of distinction there is between them, I am now to show, and that I
may be brief and plain in the opening of this weighty point, I shall lay down
the truth clearly in some few Propositions.

1. The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are Christ and his Father are one, Trinitas
est. unus solus immensus naturaliter Deus, praeter quem non est alius Deus.
Vide Fulgentium de fide Orthod.
John 10. 30. and all three are Essentially one, 1 John 5. 7. The Synod of
Calcedon determined, that Christ was Coessentiall with his Father according to
his Divinity, and Coessential with us according to his Humanity; but the
natural Union between us and Christ does only prove a specifical unity; but
Christ and his Father have one and the self-same Divine and undivided Essence.
He must acknowledge more gods, who holds that the Son and Spirit have another
or different kind of Godhead from the Father. Essentiam divinam exinanire ut
distincti onem personarum demonstre mus est impium; essentiam aute^ in ipsa
distincti one complecti absurdum.
The Arrians did divide the Nature of the Trinity, and the Sabellians did
confound their Persons; but Christians acknowledge and maintain that there are
three Persons, and but one single divine nature in the blessed Trinity; only
the second person did assume the nature of man that he might heal our nature,
and save our persons.

2. These three Divine Persons are not distinguished realiter separabiliter:
That is, they are not so distinguished, Iunius contra Samosaten.
as that they can be divided or separated one from another, as created Persons
and In illa Trinitatis natura sic totum unum est ut nihil ibi possit separari
vel dividi: sic totum aequale est ut nihil ibi majus aut minus valeat inveniri.
These three Coessentiall persons are omnipresent, they do all three subsist in
the self-same omnipresent nature; nay, they do all three subsist in one
another, without any contraction, commixtion, or confusion, as has been proved
at large in the 161, 162. and the following pages of this Book. These
Coessentiall subsiste^ts cannot be separated, or divided any more then their
indivisible and infinite Essence can be divided or multiplied.

3 These three uncreated Persons are truly distinguished; this proposition is
fully proved already in this very chapter: Fulgentius lib. de fide Orthodox. ad
Donatu^.
I know it will be expected by some, that I should say that these three Persons
are distinguished Really; but I shall humbly desire them to consider, that some
have by that expression taken occasion to exercise their wanton wits in
cavelling against this deep and glorious mystery to the great prejudice of this
weighty truth. If they be really distinguished, say some, then they differ
essentially, or tanquam res and res, then they may be separated, say others,
then there are three Gods, say a third. It is too well known what sport
Atheists have made upon this advantage; and truly it is much at one whether men
do profess themselves Atheists or Tritheites; for he who does believe that
there are three Gods, may when he pleases, believe that there is no God at all.

Vorstius presses those that call the distinction between the Persons Real
after this manner; Q^id quid est aliquid seu quod habet aliquam entitatem seu
formalitatem inquit Vorstius habet essentiam.
If the three persons be really distinguished, then they are tres Res, three
real things; for the multiplication of persons is real, and therefore the Son
being really distinct from the Father, and the Spirit from both, they must
needs have three essences really distinct. And if they are tres Res, then
either three substances, or three Accidents; Consequetiam negamus.
but the Reformed Divines cannot says Vorstius grant, that they are three
accidents, because they deny that there is any accident in God; Tum enim in
creatis subsistentia and suppositalitas quia non sunt nihil sed aliquid
haberent essentiam; and consequenter essentiae esset essentia and hujus rursum
essentia, and sic in infinitum. Vide Eglisemnium in Crisi, page 20, 21. vide
etiam Bis^er^eldium, Smiglecium, Stegmannum, ^esterum in examine Metaphys.
Phot^ianae. D. Voetium de unica and simplic. Dei natura, p. 236. Wendelinum,
etc.
and if they be three substances, then there are says he three Gods.
Valentinus Gentilis and some Ministers of Transylvania reason much after the
same manner. I know not whether Master Fry did ever read any of their writings,
but sure I am he has conversed with some of that persuasion, or else, his
carnal reason is of near kin to theirs.

For upon this very ground Mr. Fry does adventure to explode three distinct
persons or subsistencies out of his Creed, See M. Fry his blasphemy and error
blown up and down the kingdom with his own Bellows, p. 22, 23.
but he will never be able to explode them out of the Godhead: he may sooner
explode himself out of the number of Christians; for if he take away the Divine
Person of Christ, he takes away the foundation of christianity. But having
showed him his danger, I desire to satisfy his reason, awaken his Faith, and
settle his Conscience in this weighty point: Si hic ratio quaeritur, non est
mirabile: si exemplum poscitur, non est singular, Aug. Ep. 3. and li. 15. de
Civ. Dei. cap. 13. lib. 15. de Trin. cap. 7. and Job. Damas. Orth^ fid. lib. 1.
cap. 9,
if he will deny his carnal reason, and not require any example, to illustrate
a mystery above reason, and beyond example: Master Fry will tell us news
indeed, if he can make it good, That any Ministers or Members of the Church of
God in England do make Jesus Christ a distinct God from God the Father. M. Fry
his Bell. 22.


2. He may do well to publish those reasons, Personae divinae Realiter
distinguntur quia Scriptura alium dicit Patrem, alium filium, alium Spiritum
Sanctum. Johan. 5. 32. Johan. 14. 16. and quia Relative opponuntur: atqui
opposita, qua talia, non possu^t esse idem; no^ tamen distinguuntur
essentialiter: omnis quidem distinctio essentialis est realis, sed non e
contra. Personae ita sunt realiter idem cum essentia divina ut tamen Relative
inter se opponantur; ad haec non sint praedicata Essentialia; distinguuntur
itaque ab essentia divina ex natura rei eminenter. Vide D. Voet deunica and
simplicis. Dei essentia, p. 234, 235, 236.
which move him and the others he speaks of, to be of that opinion.

3. He does acknowledge that these three, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost are equally God, page 21. Let him consider his own confession [these
three] what are these three? are they three Gods? No, that he does abominate:
are they three Accidents, no, that is absurd; are they three substances? if so,
then created or uncreated; not created, for that he says none will affirm:
are they three uncreated substances? No says he, for then they would
consequently be three Gods, p. 23.

I hope by this time he sees how easy it is to retort his own Argument; and
if this retortion may help him to answer it, I shall be glad that I have
retorted it.

His only answer ought to be, I do believe that these three are three
Subsistents in the same single and infinite Godhead, Phil. 2. 6. Joh. 10. 30. 1 John 5. 7. Heb 1. 3.

Vorstius, Valentinus Gentilis, the Transylvanians require some more curious
answer; but I shall be as plain, and as brief as the weight and depth of this
Mystery will permit me to be; I remember that Aristotle says, Aristotle Ethic.
lib. 1.
He does make a truth sufficiently plain, who brings such proofs as the point
in question will bear.

Now it is most evident that supernatural Mysteries cannot be expounded
according to the rules of Art. Pater Filius and Spiritus Sanctus sunt tres Res,
and non sunt tres Res diverso respectu: tres Res respectu relationum
oppositarum. non sunt tres Res secundum essentiam. Wendelin. Christian,
Theolog. lib. 1. cap. 2. page 105. Proprietates Personales essentiam divinam
nec componant, nec multiplicant, personas autem faeliciter distinguunt. (...),
Justin Martyr.


Some return this answer, That if by Tres Res, three real things, you mean
three persons; there are three Real persons in the Godhead; they are not made
three by a fiction of reason, they are declared three by the plain words of
Scripture; but they were three before any Scripture was written, even from the
days of eternity. But if by Tres Res, three real things, you mean three
Divine Essences, we do deny that three persons are three Divine Essences, or
three Gods; for these three persons are but one God blessed for ever.

If you ask others, Non distinguuntur (...) hoc est essentia, sed (...) hoc
est Formaliter, sive (...) Personaliter. vide Dama^cen. lib. 1. de side Orthod
Modi in divinis non sunt separabiles, sunt autem reales, and modi reales
distinguunt realiter quamvis modaliter. Nonnulli distinguunt inter esse Patris,
and esse Patre^. Inter esse Quidditativum and esse Personale. Personalitas
divina est realis; distinguuntur itaque Realiter quia distinguuntur
Personaliter. Relationes in divinis non componunt sed distinguunt: relationes
autem reales realiter distinguunt. Proprietates reales proprie simul and
realiter distinguunt.
they will say that these three are one Being, but they are three proper and
peculiar manners of being subsisting in the same Godhead. They have one
essential subsistence say others, but they have three Incommunicable manners
of subsisting. Some express it thus, these three are Really distinct, but not
Essentially; Modally, but not separably; Truly, but Relatively; Formally, and
yet but Personally. Others that mean the same thing, say they are
distinguished Secundum esse Personale, non secundum esse Quidditativum.

They then that say the persons are Really distinct, should explain themselves
warily according to some of these or the like safe expressions: namely that by
really 1 they do not mean essentially.

2. They do not mean separably.

3. That by really they do mean that the Relations and personal properties,
whereby the three persons are known to be distinguished, are real relations
and real properties, and not fictions of reason.

The Relations are opposite, the properties incommunicable, and much might be
said of the personal actions to the selfsame purpose; but I must hasten.

Some do adventure to call this distinction natural, Richardus Bonavent. and
Ioh. de Rip; personas distingui dicunt per proprietates Absolutas primo, and
per Relationes Originis ex Consequenti. Discrimen (...) tantum sinxerunt
Noetiani. Epiphan. Haeres. 57. Distinctio personaru^ naturalis esse videtur,
licet non sit essentia lis inter Patrem and Filium naturalem intercedit enim
relatio naturalis. Personae per nihil quomodocunque distinctum a personis
primario distinguuntur. Frustra sunt autem qui ideo personas eodem modo
distinctas esse somniant quo primo diversa distinguuntur; illa enim
essentialiter distinguuntur. Vide Biel. 1 Sent. did. 24. and 26. (...). Vide
Greg. Nyssen. contra Eu- Eunomium lib. 1. Athanas. Basil, Eunomium cont. Naz.
D. Alting. Gomarum, Gerrard. Voetium, Maccov. Wendeli. Glassium, Rhadam,
Capreolu^, Becanum, Eglis^mnium in Crisi, Meisuerum, Iunium, Calovium.
but that is a very dangerous expression, it must not pass without some
favorable grains of allowance, nor can it then pass unless it be seasoned
with some grains of Salt, and be mollified with some fair and Orthodox
Interpretation. By natural distinction, they mean Relative, because say they
the relations which are between these uncreated persons are not only real, but
natural also. The Relation between God the Father and his own natural Son is
a natural relation, grounded upon a natural and personal act^on; namely, the
eternal generation of the Son. The Greek Fathers speak much of the Familiar
and proper Emphasis of this natural Relation between the Father and the Son.

By natural distinction then they do not mean an essential distinction, as
if the three uncreated persons did differ in nature; but natural, in that
sound and Orthodox sense recited above.

I had rather leave my Margin to relate the curiosities of others, then to
perplex a mere English Reader with any Scholastical difficulties. I have said
enough for the explication of those terms which are most usual, and yet
likely to give offense to such as do not understand the importance of them. I
shall therefore conclude this point with Fulgentius his Commentary, which is an
excellent Contexture of some pertinent Scriptures for the proof of the point.
Vide Fulgentium lib. de fide Orthod. ad Donatum.
When you read (says he) of Father, Son and Spirit, understand that there are
three persons of one essence, omnipotence, eternity, etc. For our Savior
says, I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me Ioh. 8, 16. And
concerning the spirit he says, And I will pray the Father, and he will give
you another Comforter, even the spirit of Truth, Joh. 14. 16, 17. Moreover he
commanded his Apostles to baptize all Nations in the name of the Father, Son
and Holy Ghost. And the equality of the Persons proves the unity of the Nature,
Phil. 2. 6. John 5. 18. and from hence he concludes that there are three
Persons, and not three Natures in the blessed Trinity.

From what has been said, it is evident that these three uncreated Persons are
truly distinguished, but they cannot be divided; and it is not so safe to
express the distinction of uncreated Persons by Terms of Art; They who say
the distinction is Natural, Vide D. Voetium de unica and simp. Dei natura page
235. En Mysterium quod nec capit Ratio, nec demo^strat exemplum Sola enim
revelatione divina nititur, and proinde fide divina suscipiendum est and
pieta^e suspiciendum. Vide D. Alting. de Cognitione Dei Relativa.
Incomprehensibilis rei imaginem in rebus creatis frustra quaerin us. Aug. lib.
15. de civ. Dei cap. 13. (...)* Damas. Orth. fid. lib. 1. c. 9
Real, Absolute, or Relative, do deny that the distinction is Essential, or
that the Persons are separable. They who speak most tenderly, say it is Modall,
Formal, Personal. They who say it is Natural in respect of Personal
Relations and Natural Actions, confess that it is Supernatural and
Mysterious, because the Unity of the Godhead is unquestionable; the Trinity of
Persons subsisting in that Godhead admirable; both put together undeniable and
inexplicable, and yet most necessarily and highly credible.

They who say the Persons are Formally distinct, do mean that they are truly
distinct; they do not conceive that the distinction of the uncreated Persons is
grounded upon a mere fiction of reason, or upon the weakness of our
apprehension, as if we did conceive one Person to be three Persons, because he
is called by three names, as Praxeas, Sabellius, and some others dreamt. Nor do
they believe that this distinction of these three uncreated Persons is only
grounded upon the phrase of Scripture: but they do acknowledge that there is a
true and proper, not an improper and figurative distinction between these
uncreated Persons; nay, they all confess that this true and proper distinction
is an Eternal distinction; it was from, and it will last to all eternity, and
therefore is not grounded only upon some offices and external dispensations
which have respect unto the creature.

CHAP. VIII.
The Grand Mystery of three Divine and Coessential Subsistents in the single
Godhead is not Problematicall, but Fundamental.
ALL points of Doctrine revealed in Scripture are profitable, and precious
truths; and every man is obliged to receive, believe and embrace every truth
made known to him in, and by the holy Scriptures; Because all truths contained
in Scripture are of equal credit in respect of the Authority of the Revealer;
but all truths are not of equal necessity, weight and importance in respect of
the Nature and Matter of the points revealed. There is a vast difference
between the nature, matter, weight and importance of these two Propositions;

1. Paul left his Cloak, Books and Parchments at Troas, 2 Timothy 4. 13.

2. Jesus Christ is God and man, the only Mediator between God and man, the
only and All-sufficient Savior of his people from their sins.

The first of these Propositions cannot be refused, because it is grounded upon
clear Scripture, and he who rejects a point of the least concernment, which he
knows to be revealed in Scripture, does not indeed and truth believe and
embrace any truth at all, no not truths which are of the highest concernment,
upon the right ground and true reason, namely because God has revealed them to
us in the holy Scriptures of truth.

A Fundamental point is of such high concernment, Fundamental points
described.
that whosoever is ignorant of it is condemned for his mere Negative
Infidelity; and whosoever does refuse to believe it, is condemned for his
Positive Infidelity, because he rejects a truth delivered upon the Authority of
God, and a truth so highly credible, that it is necessary to be known, and
believed for his own salvation. Our Faith, Piety, Hope, Charity, Salvation, are
all grounded upon these necessary and Fundamental truths.

Those truths or points of Doctrine are Fundamental, without the plain and
express knowledge whereof we can neither savingly believe in Christ, nor
rightly worship God in Christ to the obtaining of eternal life.

The Grand Mystery of three Divine and Coessential Subsistents in the single
Godhead, is a Fundamental point.

I desire to make this point very plain.

1. For the satisfaction of the weak. 2. Information of the ignorant. 3.
Conviction of the obstinate. 4. Edification of the meek and humble.
It is most clear and evident that it does highly concern Christians to
acknowledge

1. A Deity against the Atheists. 2. The Unity of this Deity against the
Pagans. 3. A Trinity in this Unity against Turks, Jews, Heretics, both
Ancient and Modern.
We must 1. Know. 2. Believe. 3. Acknowledge. 4. Worship. 5. Obey. 6. Trust to,
and depend upon three Persons, and one God.

Our blessed Lord in that excellent prayer of his which is most largely
recorded, John 17. says, That this is life eternal to know the Father the
only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he has sent, ver. 3. This Text has been
opened and vindicated at large in this Book already from the 44. page to the
54. and therefore I shall make quick work now, and desire you but to compare
this Text with 1 John 5. 20. We are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus
Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life; both texts tell us that it is
eternal life for to believe that the Father and the Son are the only true God,
and therefore this is a fundamental point; And the Scripture speaks expressly
that these three, The 1 John 5. 7. opened and vindicated at large.
the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost are one, one God; for the witness or
testimony delivered by these three is the witness of God, 1 John 5. 7. 9.

But it is objected by some that the words, The grand exception.
These three are one. 1 John 5. 7. are not to be found in some ancient Copies,
and therefore it will not be safe to build a point of such weight and
consequence upon such a weak foundation.

To which we answer, The answer.
It is true that these words are not to be found in the Syriack Edition, Si
Syrum caeterosque sequimur, vel hiatus admittitur, vel (...) qnae imprimis
elegans turbatur. Mihi qui talem primo usurparunt in S^cris licentiam (...)
videntur. Heinsius, in locum.
but they who speak most modestly, do acknowledge that the Syriack Edition is
not Authentic. Learned Heinsius is much offended with that Edition, as
appears by his Annotations upon, 1 Ioh. 5. 7. And if we consult the
Scriptures, and compare this Text with the following Verses, and with some
other places of Scripture, which are more plain, and then add the testimony
and Interpretations of the ancient and Reverend Doctors of the Church,
concerning the words in question, we shall be able to pass a right judgment
upon the point in hand.

1. The equality of the Number of witnesses suites very right, three witnesses
on earth, and three in heaven.

2 The opposition between the quality of the witnesses, witnesses on earth, and
witnesses in heaven: and yet their sweet harmony and agreement in one
testimony; all six bear witness to one and the same truth.

3. The diversity of the very nature of those three who bear witness on
earth, and the unity of their divine nature who bear witness in heaven, is
very considerable, and it is excellently expressed in the variation of the
Phrase, These three are one, ver. 7. and these three agree in one; namely, in
one testimony, ver. 8. Though their Nature be different, yet their Testimony is
the same.

But it is objected that the Complutensian Bible says of the heavenly
witnesses that these three agree in one, Bib. edit Complut. (...) v. 7.
ver. 7. I humbly offer this satisfaction to pious and learned men; That we
have good reason to believe, that there is an imprudent addition in the
Complutensian Bible, rather then an omission of so many ancient and approved
Bibles; and therefore it is fit that that addition should be expunged out of
that one Copy, by the concurrent testimony of so many Copies. Moreover it is
clear by the joint testimony of other Copies, that the words (...) are omitted
in the 7 ver. and the words (...) belong to the eight verse, and therefore
there is an inexcusable omission, and an imprudent transposition in that Merces
satis fallaces vendit officina Chr. Plantini Antverpiae in editione 1584 excusa
and cum Bib. Ar. Mont. vulgat.
corrupt edition. But then it is farther objected, that these words These three
are one are wanting in some other Greek copies; for answer I proceed in my
observations.

4. If we look upon the Scripture account in other places, we shall find it
exactly agreeable to the account in this place, 1 Ioh. 5. 7.

In the eighth of John our Savior pleads that two witnesses in Law were
sufficient for the proof of any point, Joh. 8. 17. Joh. 8. 17* 18.
and in the tenth verse says he, I am one, and my Father that sent me is
another: they are two witnesses, and yet but one God; Joh. 10. 3
I and my Father are one, Joh. 10. 30.
Joh. 10. 30. One in power, and therefore one in nature. He speaks not of the
spirit, because Christ was not yet glorified, nor was the Spirit yet manifested
by that eminent* and glorious mission and effusion which was to follow after
the Ascension of our blessed Lord. But he did foretell that the third witness
was to be sent from the Father by the Son, Joh. 15. 26.
Joh. 15. 26. But when the comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
the Father, even the spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he
shall testify of me. I might add to these testimonies all other places of
Scripture, wherein all the three witnesses are named together, and then produce
all the places which have been formerly cited in this book to prove the
coessential Trin-unity of those heavenly witnesses.

5. The copulative [And] in the beginning of the verse, 1 John 5. 8.
1 Ioh. 5. 8. does very fitly connect the whole seventh verse with the eighth,
as they are printed in our ordinary translation.

6. Hierome does assure us that the words in question were expunged by the
Arrians, because these few words do hold forth an undeniable proof of the
divine and Coessentiall Trin-unity of these heavenly witnesses. And diverse
other learned and judicious men conceive that these words were blotted out in
the time of Constantius and Valens the Emperors who were sworn enemies of the
blessed Trinity, and professed Patrons of Arrianisme.

7. The Heretics did blot out those words, Vide Ambros. lib. 3. de Spiritu
Sancto. cap. 11.
Ioh. 4, 24. God is a spirit, as Ambrose assures us: and therefore this
practice of expunging such words in the Scripture as did refute their errors
was too common amongst the Heretics of old, Jurati veritatis hosts lucem hanc
non tulerunt ideoque eraserunt. Vide Heinsium in 1 John 5. 7.
as we might prove by witnesses enough, if that were our business.

8. These words, 1 Ioh. 5. 7. are to be found in copies of great antiquity and
best credit.

9. This Text is cited by the Ancient Fathers, Athanas. Tom. 1. page 91, 92.
93. Cyprian lib. de Unitate Ecclesiae Paxillus de Monomachia. Calovius lib. de
Fide Patrum ante Concilium Nicenum. See Mr. Estwicks learned discourse of the
Godhead of the holy Ghost. Dr. Alting his Vindication of this Text in his
con^utation of the Racovian Catechism.
by Athanasius in his dispute with Arrius at the counsel of Nice, and Arrius
never denied it for to be Scripture, which certainly he would have done, if
there had been any doubt made of it in the Primitive times.

It is cited by Cyprian also in his book de Vnitate Ecclesiae. Paxillus in his
book de Monomachia proves by an induction of the learned Doctors of the Church
both before and since Athanasius, that the Doctrine of the Coessential
Trin-Unity of these heavenly witnesses was generally received by all that were
esteemed Orthodox and pious in the Church of Christ. Calovius also in his Fides
Patrum ante Concilium Nicenum, gives in a Catalogue for the satisfaction of all
that desire resolution in this weighty point.

10. These three heavenly witnesses are one in Power, nature and Will; all
three bear witness to the same truth, and their testimony is divine, 1 John 5.
9. And the truth which they bear witness to is a fundamental truth, a saving
truth, that we may believe on the Son of God and have eternal life. 1 John
5. 11, 12, 13. And if the authority of any one of these three heavenly
witnesses be called into question, all may be questioned upon the same grounds,
because their testimony is of equal authority; their testimony is personal
and divine; and if the testimony and authority of these witnesses were not
divine, our faith which is built upon their testimony and authority, would not
be a divine Faith. Quale est testimonium, talis est fides. All three heavenly
witnesses join with one consent and Will in propounding this fundamental
truth, and therefore if we do not believe and embrace it, we give the lie to
all the three witnesses in heaven, 1 John 5. 10. And if we do believe that
Jesus is the natural Son of God, in and by whom all believers have eternal
life, then we must acknowledge that Jesus Christ is one God with his Father,
the true God and eternal life, 1 John 5. 20. Christ is God Attributive, Joh.
1. 1. Subjective, Act 20. 28. 1 Timothy 3. 16. This one proposition, That Jesus
Christ is the natural and proper Son of God, is that Fundamental Confession of
Faith upon which the Christian Church is built, Mat. 16. 16, 17, 18. Thou art
Christ the Son of the living God: This is the Rock upon which Christ has so
firmly built his Church, that the gates of Hell shall never prevail against it,
or this fundamental truth. We are all built upon Christ, through the Spirit
for an habitation of God, Ephesians. 2. 20, 21, 22. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; all
three join in laying this foundation, and all three are one and the self-same
great God, who is the only true God blessed for ever, as has been fully proved
already in this book, and therefore I may be the briefer in the discussion of
this weighty point.

The Form of Baptism does contain in it a short Creed, or Rule of Faith, Mat.
28. 19. And when the ancient Fathers speak such high things of the Creed, they
understand it of this short Creed which is part of Canonical Scripture, and
not of that form which is commonly callled the Apostles Creed. In like manner
when they expound Ephesians. 4. 5. One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, they say, there
is one Faith and one Baptism, because the sum of our Faith is contained in the
form of Baptism.

When Epiphanius has reckoned up all the Heresies in his Anaceph. he opposes
this one Scripture, Mat. 28. 19. to them all, to show that he looked upon the
Doctrine of the Trinity as a Breviary or at least prime fundamental of the
Christian Faith, Irenaeus lib. 1. cap. 2.
and Eusebius Pamphilus does the like. Tertullian de Praescript. c. 14 and 20.
I might produce many pertinent places out of Irenaeus, Tertullian, Athanasius,
Basil, Nazianzene, Augustine and others to make good this useful observation,
Athanas. Epist. ad ubique Orthodox and Orat. C. G. Sab and contra (...).
That the prime Fundamental of the Christian Faith is contained in the Form of
Baptism, and founded on Mat. 28. 19. It were easy to show upon what occasion
other See Dr. Usher his Sermon (...) the Unity of the Faith.

And it is as easy to prove that the Doctrine of the Coessential Trin-unity
was for the matter and substance, if not in express terms, in terminis
terminantibus as we say, constantly maintained

1. In public Confessions of Faith composed, explained, confirmed by the
first General Councels, published by the decrees, and edicts of pious
Emperors, and ratifyed by their civil sanctions from time to time. I need not
instance in the Nicene Creed, or that Creed which was composed by Athanasius
who studied this point, defended and suffered for it above forty years: The
Confession published by the Synod of Constantinople does not differ in
substance from the other Creeds concerning this grand mystery of the blessed
Trinity. I am not willing to expatiate upon this Argument, because I should
then be engaged to cite very many testimonies of the Ancients, which would
swell up my book beyond its due proportion. But if any man desire to read more
upon this Argument for his own satisfaction, Vide Parkerum de Desc. ad inferos
Dr. Usher his learned Sermon of the Unity of Faith. D. Voet. de Symbolo
Apostolico. D. Gomarum de Symbolo, de Trinitate* Glassium, Zanchium de
Trinitate.
and has not so much time as to peruse the ancient Records, he may read Master
Parkers book de Desc. ad inferos, more especially his fourth book; The learned
Sermon of Reverend Doctor Usher, concerning the unity of Faith, who gives a
brief and satisfactory account of the ancient Confessions of Faith with a
special reference to Baptism. Doctor Voetius, Gomarus, and the rest who have
written de Symbolo Apostolico, or of the mystery of the Trinity. The juggling of
the Arrians is so plainly set forth in the most faithful writers of
Ecclesiastical story, that I need not relate how they made use of their
interest at Court, and all their carnal policy in every considerable place to
pack Councels, forge or corrupt Creeds, seduce all sorts of men, who were led
more by interest then Scripture, and then to evade, or comply with subtle
distinctions, mental reservations, equivocations, and such unworthy shifts for
to save themselves from censure in a time of Reformation.

2. The Catechismes of the Ancients hold forth this doctrine; the Catechumeni
were trained up in the knowledge of it. Lucian who lived in Trajans time,
Lucian. in Philopat.
brings in a Christian Catechizing the heathens in the Doctrine of the Trinity.

3. The form of Baptism strictly observed in the Churches notwithstanding the
great ignorance and contention in the East, and the grand Apostasy in the West;
does sufficiently prove that this Doctrine of the Trinity had taken deep root
in the minds of men, and that they were by the providence and special grace of
God very diligent and faithful in communicating of it to their posterity from
time to time.

4. The Doxology, or as some call it, the Hymn of glory does evince the same,
and therefore the Arrians endeavored to make an alteration in the Doxology and
instead of saying, Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
Holy Ghost, they said, Glory be to the Father, By the Son, and In the Spirit;
from whence we may observe by the way, that if we suffer the Fundamental
Doctrine of our Faith to be corrupted, we shall not be able to preserve the
Fundamentals of our worship pure, and incorrupt.

5. The Form of Apostolical Benediction which stands upon record, 2 Cor. 13.
14. does clearly hold forth the Doctrine of the Trinity to be a Fundamental
both of Faith, and Worship; And all who desire the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the love of God, the communion of the Holy Ghost, for their everlasting
comfort and salvation, must believe and adore all three as on^ God blessed for
ever.

6. All who believe in God are commanded to believe in Christ as God, as one
and the same God with the Father. Ye believe in God, believe also in me, Joh.
14. 1. They are commanded to honor the Son as they honor the Father, Joh. 5
23. And therefore the Doctrine of the divine person of Christ as Coessential
with his Father is a Fundamental both of Faith and worship.

7. The Doctrine of the incarnation of the Word, the natural and proper Son of
God; the Doctrines of Christ's satisfaction, Divinitas Christi est ipsum
Fundamentale hujus dogmatis; est enim Articulus fidei necessarius necessitate
finis respectu communionis internae and invisibilis cum Christo, hoc est cum
Dei gratia and gloria: nec non respectu communionis Ecclesiasticae in visibili
caetu.
of our Redemption, and justification by Christ as an all-sufficient Savior,
are Fundamental Doctrines necessary to be known, believed and embraced for our
eternal Salvation; for we know the blood of a mere man cannot give
satisfaction to the justice of God for those gross affronts, injuries and
abuses which have been offered by man to the infinite Majesty of God. The
Church of God is purchased with the blood of God, Act. 20. 28. And if Christ
has not redeemed the Church with the blood of God, then the Church is not
redeemed; your Faith and our preaching are both vain, because you and we are
yet in our sins; for then God has not received satisfaction for our sins, nor
a sufficient ransom for our souls. If the Son of God did not take flesh, then
was not God manifested in the flesh; then the whole mystery of godliness which
should be without controversy great and precious in the eyes of Christians,
will be cheap, and vile, and of no account; for the whole mystery of
godliness, 1 Timothy 3. 16. depends upon the manifestation of God in the flesh;
Now the divine person of the Son took flesh; the person of the Father was not
incarnate.

8. It is not enough to believe that the Son of Mary is risen from the dead; we
must believe that the Son of God is risen, Romans 1. 3, 4. It is Jesus our Lord
that rose for our justification, Romans 4. 24, 25. Romans 10. 9.

9. It is not sufficient to believe that there is a man sitting at the right
hand of God; we must believe that Jehovah sits there, Psalm. 110. 1. Mat. 22.
43, 44, 45. And the like must be said of our Advocate, he must be such a one as
can plead the worthiness of his person, the merit of his obedience and
sufferings, one who is able to save us to the uttermost, Heb. 7. 25. 1 Ioh. 2.
1. 2 One who can plead with some Authority and Majesty; Father, I will that
they also whom thou have given me, be with me where I am, Ioh. 17. 24. He
speaks with Authority, I will: he speaks like a Coessentiall and Coequall
person; and it is for the glory of the Father, to believe that the Father is in
the Son, and the Son in the Father, that the Son is Lord, equal to the Father.
Ioh. 14. 10, 11. Phil. 2. 6* 11. Many arguments more might be collected from
diverse places of Scripture cited above in the fourth chapter of this book, and
I shall enlarge upon this argument in the ninth Chapter.

10. The Holy Ghost is the same God with the Father and Son, the same object of
divine Faith and Evangelical worship, the same Author of the Scriptures, and
all-saving Grace, Mat. 28. 19. 1 Cor. 12. 6. 11. 2 Cor. 13. 14. Through the Son
and by the spirit, we have access to the Father, Ephesians. 2. 18. All Church
administrations are to be performed in the power of the Holy Ghost, and are
made acceptable by the merit of the Lord Jesus Christ. If we will hear the
Spirit speaking in the Scriptures to the Churches, if we feel the Spirit
Sanctifying of our hearts, if we do not desire to undermine the foundation of
the Christian Church, and so overthrow the Church of Christ, if we do not
renounce our Christian Faith, and our Baptism the Sacrament thereof, if we do
not reject the fundamental blessing (the best portion of our selves and little
ones) the grace of Christ, the love of God and communion of the Spirit, why
then, I beseech you, as the Apostle does, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake and
for the love of the Spirit, Romans 15. 30. and for the glory of God the Father,
Phil. 2. 11. that you will believe, adore, embrace, love and obey the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, as three Divine and Coessentiall Subsistents in the single
Godhead, as one God blessed for ever, the adaequate object, and Author of
your Faith, hope, love and happiness.

I do not desire to obtrude any thing upon the acutest disputant as
Fundamental that is curious or unnecessary. Nay there are many things
necessary for the maintenance of ^his truth, and refutation of contrary errors,
when we are to deal with subtle Heretics, which I do not set before the
common people as food fit to nourish them: and for that reason I do desire
them, Dogma de Trinitate notat non tam negativam and Elencticam Theologiam quam
Positivam; and Theses Principales non tam modu^, and (...) ho^um G^amatice,
Rhetorice, and Logice dogma illud explicandi quam ipsam rem explicatam, non tam
formam ac modum per Philosophicas and Logicas notiones, distinctiones, and
Axiomata dogma hoc contra Pseudo-rationa^^os quoscunque tutandi, eorum
subtilitates persequendo, and ad absurdum redigendo. D. Voetius de Trinitate,
page 467.
that they will look upon much of my sixth chapter, and of some other chapters
in this book, as ^t for the direction of young Scholars in this weighty point;
for I find young wits apt to be seduced by Logical subtilities, or rather
fallacies, Metaphysical notions, Poetical raptures, nice distinctions and vain
curiosities, from the simplicity of the Gospel of Christ; and therefore I have
taken some pains in diverse chapters, but specially in the margin for the
direction of hopeful youths, who have been too often entangled and ensnared by
Socinian fallacies, and at last tempted into loud and hideous blasphemies. We
do therefore lay down these plain truths as necessary to be known and believed
for the maintaining of saving communion with God.

1. That God is. For he who comes unto God must believe that God is. Heb. 11.
6.

2. That there is but one God. Deuteronomy. 6. 4.

3. That the Father Son, and Holy Ghost are this one God* because they are all
three Coessentiall subsistents in this most single Godhead, 1 Cor. 8. 5. 6.
Phi. 2. 6. 1 Io 5. 7 Ioh. 10. 30. Mat. 3. 16, 17. Mat. 28. 19. Act. 5. 4. 1
Cor. 12. 6. 11. 2 Cor. 13. 14. Ioh. 15. ^6. Rev. 1. 4. 5.

Reverend Calvin was not so morose and austere in this point as to contend
about unnecessary words, Vide Call. Inst. lib. 1. cap. 13. Sect. 5. and Colonii
Anal. Praph. Instit. pa. 36.
or curious phrases, so there were such words used as did fitly and fully
express the whole mystery of Faith in this weighty point, and sufficiently
refute the damnable errors of Arrius and Sabellius. If men will but
acknowledge 1. That the Father, Son and Spirit are one God and the self same
God. 2. That the Son, is not the Father, nor the Spirit the Son; but that these
three are distinguished by special Relations, Incommunicable and unchangeable
properties, so that there is a Trinity of Coessentiall Subsistents in the
selfsame Divine Essence, we are all agreed.


Arrius would acknowledge that Christ is God, Vide Apologiam Voidovij and
Ostorodi ad decret. in illustr. D. D. Ord. Belg. an. 1598. Non negamus Dei
gratia veram filij Dei divinitatem, sed falsam imaginariam, and quam nusquam
Sacrae Literae, agnoscunt. Smalcius etiam Zelum suum in propugnanda vera
divini^ate Jesus Christi praedicat in libro de divinitate Christi cap. 25.
bu^ not Consubstantiall, or Coessentiall with his Father, for he did deny
Christ to be the same God with his Father. And in like manner the Socinians
will say, that they acknowledge and maintain the true Divinity of the Son and
Holy Ghost; but they do deny that the Son and Spirit are one and the same God
with the Father; and affirm, that the Reformed Churches who believe that all
three persons have the self same Godhead, do ascribe a false and imaginary
Godhead to the Son and Spirit, which the Holy Scriptures do no where
acknowledge or declare. And this is the true reason why the Orthodox Doctors of
the Church have been so unanimous, especially of late years in maintaining
this Proposition, --

Pater, Filius and Spiritus Sanctus sunt (...). The Father, Son and Holy Spirit
are one and the self-same God. On the other side Sabellius acknowledged, Dicit
Sabellius patrem, Filium and spi^itum nihil in Deo distinctum sonare.
that the Father Son, and Holy Ghost are one God; but if you say that the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three different subsistents, then he cried out
as M. Fry does, that you acknowledge three Gods; the best way to avoid these
(says judicious Calvin) is to say That there is a Trinity of Persons in one
and the same essence of God. Dic tres esse, vociferabitur te nominare tres
Deos. Dic in una Dei Essentia Personarum Trinitatem: dixeris uno verbo quod
Scripturae loquuntur, and inanem loquacitatem compresseris. Call. inst. l. 1 c.
13 sect. 6. Vide D. vo^t^um de necessitate, and utilitate dogmatis de SS.
Trinitate page 467, 468. D. Crocium Synt. nec non Gomarum.
For we must needs acknowledge the unity of the Divine nature, because we read
that the Father, Son and Spirit are one; and we must acknowledge the Trinity of
these Coessentiall Subsistents or persons, because we read that they are three.
Now the Trinity and unity make a Coessential Trinunity; and if the unity of the
Godhead, and Trinity of the Subsistents, or persons be acknowledged, we shall
not wrangle about curious phrases, or unnecessary words. The most judicious and
moderate men amongst the Orthodox Doctors of the Church agree in this. Learned
D. Davenant in his Letter to M. Dury.
The learned and Reverend Doctor Davenant in his judicious exhortation to
Brotherly Communion between the Protestant Churches, teaches us how to
distinguish between points that are fundamental, and Problems or Propositions
that are not Fundamental, and when he comes to reckon up Fundamentals, he
instances in the Trinity, and expresses himself after this manner;

That God is one in Essence, three in Persons distinguished betwixt themselves;
That the Son is begotten of the Father; That the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of
the Father and the Son; That these three persons are coeternall and coequall.

All these (says he) are deservedly determined and ranked amongst the
Fundamental Articles. Now if any should contend that all those things which
are disputed of the Schoolmen, of the manner of proceeding and begetting, are
also fundamental, and necessary to be determined on one side, verily he by
this his rash judgment, would gain no favor with Christ.

But it is objected by some, who do acknowledge Christ to be God, that they
have no reason to close with us, when we say, That Jesus Christ is Coessentiall
with God his eternal Father, because we do impose a new word upon them, and so
make a new Fundamental of our own Inventition; to which I answer: 1. That if
we make an old truth plain by a new word, they ought to forgive us that
injury. 2. We explain our new Term. 3. We save them the trouble of an
artificial and tedious deduction; for as soon as they do but understand the
word, they must necessarily embrace the sense, and acknowledge that though the
word seem new to them, yet the Doctrine is old; for if the persons be of a
different Divine Essence, then there would be more Gods then one. 4. We do
hereby secure them against the subtilty of pernicious Heretics who endeavor
to seduce them into damnable Heresies; For if the Father, Son and Spirit have
not the same Divine Essence, then either there will be more Gods then one, or
else the Son and Spirit are no Gods at all, but such petty inferior Gods as
the Socinians make them. 5. No man that has a sound brain, and a single eye,
can conceive that there are diverse Gods in the same Essence, and therefore the
expression is necessary and safe. The Father, Son and Spirit are three
Coesential subsistents in the same single Godhead, they are all three one and
the selfsame God, who is God by nature, the only true God blessed for ever;
in this Faith we will live, and in this we will dye, as it becomes Orthodox
Christians, who were b^ptized in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.


CHAP. IX.
This Grand Mystery of Faith has an Effectual influence into the Practical
Mystery of Godliness and Power of Religion.
IT is the great design, and faithful endeavor of sincere Christians to
attain unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the
acknowledgement of the Mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ, Colos.
2. 2. They who have but a Form of Godliness (...) a kind of painted powerless
shadow of piety may look upon the Doctrine of the Trinity as a School-point, a
mere speculative Doctrine which men receive by Tradition from their
forefathers; but they who live in the spirit, and walk in the spirit, Gal. 5.
25. have a life that is hid with Christ in God, Colos; 3. 3. hid from formal
men, as colors are hid from blind men; and these spiritual Christians do
account the love of the Father, 2 Cor. 13. 14.
the grace of Christ, and the communion of the Spirit to be their Heaven upon
earth; They receive Jesus Christ, so as to live by him, walk in him, and live
to him, Colos. 2. 6. Phil. 1. 21, 1 Ioh. 5. 12, 2 Cor. 5. 15.

What is a Godly life? but a life of faith, and love, of joy and thankfulness,
of self-denial, and devotion; of patience and obedience, hope and
perseverance, victory, and triumph. This is the life of God, or that godly
life, to which the Ephesians were all strangers till they had learned the truth
as it is in Jesus, Ephesians. 4. 20, 21. And how come we to be quickened to this
Godly life? but by being begotten of the Father, Iam. 1. 17, 18. borne of the
Spirit, Ioh. 3. 6. and hearing the voice of the Son of God, Ioh. 5. 25, 26,
When we have learnt of the Father, and are drawn by the Spirit, we come unto
the Son, who is the way, the truth, and the life, Ioh. 6. 44, 45. Ioh. 14. 6.
And how is this Spiritual life maintained, but by the Supply of the Spirit of
Jesus Christ? Philip. 1, 19.

Let us take the whole frame of a godly life to pieces, and view every part and
Spring, and wheel and pin, and then put it together again, and then we shall
be able to judge what effectual influence these three Coessentiall persons
(considered as one and the same God, or as three distinct persons subsisting in
the single Godhead) have into the Practical Mystery of Godliness, and Power
of Religion.

The Doctrine of Godliness contains 1. Our Faith in God. 2. Worship of God.
3. Obedience to God.


1. Our Faith in God. I have spoken of this grand Mystery of Faith, and shown
that it is necessary to be known and believed in the eight Chapter at large;
But I shall now treat of it in a more practical way. Adam in his Innocence was
bound for to believe in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, who are one Almighty
God, Creator, Upholder and Governor of Heaven and Earth, Self-sufficient and
All-sufficient, blessed in, and of himself, the only cause, and adaequate
object of the blessedness of his creatures. Adam was created by all three;
after the Image of all three; for God said, Let us make man in our Image, after
our likeness, Genesis 1. 26. and therefore we cannot conceive, but that all three
were revealed to Adam, that he might know and believe in all three; surely Adam
was better Catechized then Jews, Turks and Pagans are in this great point, and
therefore did know, believe and Worship all three. There is no question but he
entered into Covenant with all three; and therefore believed in all three; I
cannot believe that two of the Divine Persons had no worship or service from
Adam their creature before his fall; And doubtless Adam knew whom he believed,
and whom he worshipped as his Almighty Creator, and All-sufficient God. Adam
under the first Covenant was bound to believe in the second Person as God, but
not as God-man, (...). Mercur. Trismegist.
the Mediator betwixt God and sin full man. Adam did owe the right of
subjection to all three, from whom he received the Honor of Dominion. The
world was made for man, man for the honor and glory of Father, Son and Holy
Ghost; Adams original righteousness did incline and enable him to believe in
all three; and surely Adam understood that severe rebuke which was given him
presently after his fall, Genesis 3. 22. And the Lord God said, Behold the man is
become as one of [us] But because I will forbear disputes, I will not proceed
further upon this Argument.

God the Father is the object of a Christians faith.
God the Father is pleased to be our Tutor, to condescend so far as to teach
us; and oportet discentem credere; Scholars must believe their teachers. It is
written in the Prophets, and they shall be all taught of God; Every man
therefore that has heard, and has learnt of the Father comes unto me, Ioh.
6. 45. We must believe the Record that God the Father gives of his Son, 1 Ioh.
5. 10. When we look upon God as the father of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, and look upon him as our God and Father in Christ, these near and dear
relations do encourage us to believe him, and believe in him, to believe his
truth, to believe his love; his fatherly and tender bowels do persuade and even
constrain us to fix our belief and place our confidence in God the Father.

The heirs of Promise have good encouragement to believe their Father, who
gives them all they have and hope for, when he declares the immutability of his
Counsel in a faithful promise, and confirms it by an unchangeable Oath, Heb.
6. 17, 18. Surely the Father will not deceive his own children of their
Inheritance which he has made over to them by promise and Oath; this is the
ground of all our hope and comfort; we may safely cast Anchor here, Heb. 6. 18.
19. In the Old Testament, the Covenant runs in the names of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob; but in the New Testament it runs in the name of Christ; there we read
the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; but here we read, God our Father, the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that is our God and Father in Christ, and
for Christ; our Father because Christ's Father. Grace be to you, and peace from
God our Father; and blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
has blessed us with all Spiritual blessings in heavenly things in Christ,
Ephesians. 1. 2, 3. We cannot but look up with Faith and confidence to the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ and our Father as the fountain of all blessing, the
fountain of grace and peace and glory. This dear Fatherly relation of God to
Christ, and in Christ to us, is sometimes darkly intimated and but hinted, and
sometimes clearly and fully expressed to encourage our Faith. The Disciples
were very sad because they heard our Savior speak of going to his Father: go
says Christ, to my brethren and say unto them, Ioh. 20. 17. What should Mary
say for their consolation? was it enough to tell them my Lord is alive, and
calls you his brethren? no, that were too dark an intimation, and therefore
our Savior gives her her message in words at length; Go to my brethren, and
say unto them I ascend unto my Father, and your Father and to my God, and your
God, Joh. 20 17. here is an Evangelical ground of faith, hope and comfort in the
time of the saddest distress. The great Argument used to encourage poor
trembling believers to come to Christ when they have interrupted their
fellowship with God the Father, Christ and the Holy Comforter by any grievous
wounding sin is this: If any man sin* we have an Advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the Righteous. God is a Father both to us and our Advocate;
therefore renew the sense of your justification by faith at a Ihrone of Grace;
you see our faith is encouraged in the saddest trials by this Argument. The
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is the Father of mercyes, and the God of all
comfort, 2 Cor. 1. 3. the fountain of grace and peace, Rom 1. 7. Gal. 1. 3.
Jesus Christ make it his o^^inesse to persuade poor tempted soul^s to believe
that his Father loves them, and ^ears good will to them. The Father himself
loves you, Ioh. 16. 27 and Christ gave himself for to deliver us from sin and
the World, Death and Hell, according to the will of God and our Father, Gal. 1.
4. And God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten etc.

II. God the Son is the object of our Faith, Ioh. 3. 16.
Ioh. 14 1. Ye believe in God, believe also in me; even the very Jews did
believe in God; they who are Christians indeed believe in Christ also. For this
end the whole Gospel was written that men might be persuaded to believe that
Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, Joh. 20. 31, and that the belief of this
grand point is necessary and effectual unto salvation is presently declared in
the very same verse, and that believing ye might have life through his Name
I0*^0. 31. And this is the record that God has given to us eternal life, and
this life is in his Son. He that has the Son has life, and he that has not
the Son has not life. These things have I written to you that believe on the
name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye
may believe on the name of the Son of God, Ioh. 5. 11, 12, 13. And if God give
us an understanding to know this, the knowing of, believing and living in Jesus
Christ the Son of God, the true God, will be effectual unto life eternal. And
we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that
we may know him that is true: and we are in him that is true, even in his Son
Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. 1 Ioh. 5. 20. It is for
want of spiritual understanding if we do not discern that all our hopes of
salvation are built upon the Sonship and Godhead of Jesus; we must believe in
Christ as he is the natural and proper Son of God as he is the true God, the
self-same God with the Father.

1. 1 John 5. 5.
We must believe in Christ as he is the Natural and Proper Son of God, Act. 8.
37.
because this is exactly answerable to that dear and fatherly relation of God
the Father, Mat. 16. 16
of which we have discoursed so largely in this chapter. 1 John 2. 22. 23, 24.
ver.
For as we are encouraged to believe in God as the Father of Christ, so are we
encouraged to believe in Christ as the natural Son of God: and therefore I
have purposely insisted on such Scriptures as do evidently demonstrate this
truth, That we are to believe on the name of the Son of God and to have life
through his name, 1 John 5. 11, 12, 13, 20. Joh. 20. 31. We are to believe in
Christ as a Mediator, that our faith and hope may be settled in God; Who by him
do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, that your Faith and hope
might be in God, 1 Pet, 1. 21. Now the great encouragement to believe in Christ
as an all-sufficient Mediator is this, Jesus Christ is the natural Son of God;
and therefore if Christ will but present us to his Father, we are confident
that the Son of God, his natural Son, his proper Son, his only begotten Son
will prevail with his Father for us; his relation to God, and his interest in
God does assure us that the intercession of our High Priest will be
irresistible, undeniable. Christ glorified not himself to be made an
High Priest, but he that said unto him Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten
thee. As he says also in another place, Thou art a Priest for ever, after the
order of Melchise dech, Heb. 5. 5, 6. We must for the understanding of this
Scripture compare three places together, Psa. 1^0. 1. 4. Psa. 2. 2, 7, 8. Heb.
7. 25, 28. The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my right hand -- Thou art a
Priest -- Psa. 110. 1. 4. The Lord said, Thou art my Son, ask of me, Psalm. 2.
7, 8. Ask what thou will, I can deny thee nothing, thou art my Son, it is thy
birthright to be a Priest, and it is proper for a Priest to ask, and
intercede. Other Highpriests were men of infirmity, but the Son who is
consecrated and perfected for evermore, is able by his powerful intercession,
to save those to the uttermost who come unto God by him, Heb. 7. 25, 28. Nay
all the offices of Christ are grounded on his Sonship; his kingly power, Psalm.
2. I have set my King, etc. Thou art my Son, ver. 6, 7. His Prophetical power
is grounded on his Sonship also, Mat. 17. 5. And behold a voice out of the
cloud, Mat. 17 5.
which said, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him. I
have promised that ye shall be all taught of God, and therefore I send my own
natural Son to teach and instruct you; he is the great Prophet and Tutor of
the Church; hear ye him, and believe in him; for he is the true Messiah who is
to teach you all things, and I have sent him on purpose for to instruct you.
And this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he has sent, Joh. 6.
29. Joh. 6. 29.
But enough of this, Joh. 7. 29.
because I have spoken something of it already in the seventh chapter of this
book, Joh. 5. 23*
and clearly proved that Christ could not have gone thorough with any of his
divine Offices, Joh. 6* 68.
Joh. 17* 8.
Joh. 16. 27.

2. We must believe in Christ as God, the self-same God with the Father. When
we know Christ to be God, Romans 1. 21.
we must glorify him as God by believing in him. Now I have by many undeniable
Arguments proved Christ to be God, and therefore I may safely conclude that we
ought to believe in him as God; for cursed is he who believes in an arm of
flesh. When Peter preached to Cornelius, he told them that Jesus Christ was
Lord of all, Act 10. 36. Judge of all, ver. 42. And that all the Prophets gave
witness to him, Act. 10* 36 42, 43.
that through his name, whosoever believes in him, 2 John v. 9.
shall receive remission of sins, ver. 43. Phil. 2. 11,
I need say no more but this: He that abides in the Doctrine of Christ, Ioh.

Joh, 14. 13. And the Son is to be glorified in all them whom the Father has
given him, John 17. 10. and Christ is to be glorified by their believing in
him, Joh. 17. 23. And the Father himself loves them, because they believe in
the Son, Joh. 16. 27. And he who honors not the Son, honors not the
Father, Joh. 5. 23. The great mystery of uniting the soul to Christ by Faith
(Ephesians. 5. 32.) and making of it one Spirit with the Lord Jesus* 1 Cor. 6. 17. is
a main Fundamental of the mystery of Godliness, as shall be proved clearly
before I conclude this chapter.

III. God the Holy Ghost is the object God the H. Ghost is the Object of a
Christian's divine Faith.
The Holy Ghost speaking in the Holy Scriptures does teach us to believe not
only in the Father, and in the Son, but in himself also. It is the Spirit that
bears witness, because the Spirit is truth, 1 John 5. 6. There are three
that bear witness in Heaven, 1 Ioh. 5. 6.
but here is special testimony given of the Spirit, 1 Pet. 1. 11. 12.
that we might be moved to believe the spirit, Act. 5. 32.
who is to testify the whole truth concerning the Father, the Son and himself.
It is the Spirit (says he) whose special office it is to bear witness, and
therefore there is this special testimony given of him that the Spirit is
truth; and then it follows, that the Spirit is one with the Father, and the
Son; one in nature, one and the same God with them both. These three are one, 1 John 5. 7. and the witness of God must without controversy be received,
unless we will make God a Liar, as the Apostle reasons the point from the 9th
verse to the 12th. The Spirit is Truth, the Spirit is God; therefore the Spirit
is the object of Divine faith; he that tells a lie to the Holy Ghost, Act. 5.
3, 4*
tells a lie to God, Acts 5. 3, 4. He that then gives the lie to the Holy
Ghost, gives the lie to God; The testimony of the Spirit is a Divine testimony,
1 Cor. 2. ^, 4, 5.
1 Cor. 2. 1. 4. the demonstration of the Spirit, a divine demonstration, the
power of the Holy Ghost, a divine power. Paul says his Preaching was not with
enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power;
that our faith might not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
The wisdom, power, testimony of the Spirit, are all of them divine; the
wisdom of the Spirit is infallible, the power of the Spirit is irresistible;
and therefore our most divine faith is built, and does stand fast grounded and
established upon the wisdom of the Spirit, because the wisdom of the Spirit
is the wisdom of God, All three divine persons teach; 1 The Father.
1 Cor. 2. 4, 5. We read in the Prophets, that all the children of God shall be
taught of God, Esaias. 54. 13. of all three persons; for the Father teaches,
Mat. 16. 17. Mat. 16. 17.
Ioh. 5. 45. Ioh. 5. 45.
and the Son who came out of the bosom of his Father, Mat 11. 25.
and yet remained in the bosom of his Father teaches, 2 The Son.
Heb. 1. 2. Ioh. 1. 18,
But the Father and the Son, Mat 11. 27
especially since the Ascension of Christ, Ioh. 15. 15.
and the effusion of the Spirit, Luke 4. 18.
do teach the children of God all his Elect by the holy Spirit. Act. 1. 3.
And therefore the Apostle showing how God does teach his Elect after a more
peculiar manner, 3 The Spirit teaches after a more peculiar manner.
so that even babes in Christ, those whom he calls little children, are
preserved even in seducing times, 1 Ioh. 2. 20.
and led into all necessary truths, 1 Cor. 2. 10, 11, 12.
notwithstanding all the diligence and subtilty of those many Antichrists, 1
Cor. 12. 3.
who are industrious to deceive; he says, they have an unction from the Holy
one, 1 Cor. 12. 13.
and know all things; all things necessary to be known and believed for the
obtaining the remission of sins, 2 Cor. 3. 8.
etc. ver. 12. Gal. 3. 2.
But more especially he shows that the Spirit does teach them to continue in
the Son and in the Father, Pro. 1. 23.
ver. Isa. 59. 21.
24. Isa. 30. 21.
and therefore in the Doctrine concerning the Father and the Son, Psa. 119. 102.
as it is more expressly set down in the 9th verse of the second Epistle of
John. 1 Ioh. 2. 27*
And then he shows that the Spirit should abide constantly in them, 2 Ioh. v.
9.
to give them clear and certain direction in all necessary points, 1 John 2.
27. But the anointing which ye have received of him abides in you, and ye
need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all
things, and is truth and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall
abide in him, or it. Ye shall abide in Christ and abide in the truth, which
has been taught you by the Holy Spirit; and the teaching of the Spirit is
clear and certain; for says he, the spirit is truth and is no lie. Here is
the peculiar teaching of God; the Spirit teaches us to believe in himself,
as well as in the Father and the Son. And the Spirit was sent by the Father in
the nam^ of the Son for this very purpose. Moreover it is evident that the
Spirit does not only teach Babes in Christ, but he taught even the Apostles of
Christ. But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost, Ioh. 14. 26
whom the Father will send in my name, Act. 2. 3. 4.
he shall teach you all things, Ioh. 16. 13.
Joh. 14. 26. Nay the Holy Spirit did endite all the Holy Scriptures, and
inspire the Prophets, Apostles and all the holy men of God in the writing of
them. The Scriptures were not written by the will of men, but by the motion of
the Holy Ghost. 1 Pet. 1. 11
2 Pet. 1. 21. 2 Pet. 1* 21*
where the motion of the Holy Ghost is opposed to the will of men, to show that
the motion and will of the Holy Ghost is the motion and will of God. Many other
places and arguments might be superadded; but for the better instruction of
ordinary Readers, I shall draw out my Arguments into rank and file.

The testimony of the Spirit is the testimony of God, 1 Cor. 2. 1. 4. 1 Cor. 2.
1. 4.
The wisdom of the Spirit, the wisdom of God; 1 Ioh. 5. 6* 10.
and the power of the Spirit the power of God, 1 Cor. 2, 4, 5. 13. The teaching
of the Spirit is the teaching of God; Ihe will of the Spirit is the will of
God, 2 Pet. 1. 21. 1 Cor. 12. 6. 11.

2. The Spirit is the Author of the Scriptures, Tim. 3. 16. 1 Pet. 1. 11, 12.
Revel. 2. 29.

3. The Spirit is the Interpreter of the 1 Cor. 2, 7* 10, 14, 15.
and his interpretation is clear, certain and infallible. The Spirit discovers
the hidden wisdom of God; the wisdom of God in a mystery, the deep things
of God, which could not have entered into the heart of man, if the Spirit had
not revealed them; and therefore the deep things of God, ^ Cor. 2. 10. are
called the things of the Spirit of God ver, ^4. and things which are
spiritually discerned, and therefore they are such things as the Spiritual man
by the help of the Spirit is able to perceive, discern, receive, and to say
with truth and comfort, Now I have the mind of Christ, now I know the things
that are freely given me of God, 1 Ioh. 3. 24*
because the Spirit has revealed them to me. 1 Cor. 2. 12.
Consider the discourse of the Apostle quite throughout the Second chapter of
the first Epistle to the Corinthians, Ioh. 6. 69.
Isa. 30. 21*
and this point will be very clear. 1 Cor. 2. 15.


4. The Spirit is the Author of Faith, he Cor. 2. 8, 9, 10. 1 Cor. 2. 8. 9. 10.
Ephesians. 1. 17, 18. Ephesians. 1. 17. 18.
He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself. 1 Ioh. 5. 6.
10.
The Spirit is called the witness, 1 Ioh. 5. 6. 10. And the Apostle assures us
that none can say, with faith and full persuasion of heart, 1 Cor. 12. 3.
that Jesus is the Lord, till he has been taught to say so by the Holy Ghost,
Jude v. 19.
1 Cor, 12. 3. 1 Cor. 2. 14.


They who are sensual and have not the Spirit, Jude ver. 19. do slight the
testimony of the Spirit; because the world cannot receive the Spirit, or the
things of the Spirit: It is a natural man's pride and folly to account those
things below him which are above him; for he does account spiritual wisdom
foolishness, whereas indeed it is too excellent for him to understand because
he is a mere natural sensual man but these spiritual things are spiritually
discerned; he does not receive them, The true reason why men do^ not believe in
the Spirit and adore the Spirit.
he cannot know them, 1 Cor. 2. 14. This is the true reason why men do not
believe in the Spirit, and adore the Spirit, because he is the Spirit of Truth,
whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him,
Ioh. 14. ver. 17. 1 Ioh. 3. 24*
But says Christ to his Disciples, 1 Cor. 2. 12.
ye know him for he dwells with you and shall be in you, Romans 8. 9.
Ioh. 14. in the selfsame ver. and Act. 5. 32.

5. The Spirit is the Supreme Judge of truth, Judicium discretionis non arguit
Officium Judicis.
even of controverted truths in matters of Religion; we need not speak of a
Private judgment of Discretion, such as spiritual men may pass by the help
of the Spirit and word of truth; nor of that Public and ministerial judgment
which may be passed in greater or lesser Synods where Pastors and Elders are
assembled by the Ordinance of Christ, Legislator judicat (...).
and therefore may pray in faith for the direction and assistance of the Holy
Ghost in all their Ministerial determinations. Minister Publicus (...)
Christianus privatus (...). Vide Reverend. Dr. Davenant de judice ac Norma
fidei. cap. 3. p. 3. learned Dr. Reynolds Confer. with Heart c. 2. 4, 5, 6.


But I speak of the supremacy and Sovereignty of Judgment, which belongs to
the Holy Ghost. True it is, that Christ is King and head of the Church, and
therefore he is our master, Doctor, Lawgiver. Mat. 23. 10. Iam. 4. 12. But the
Father has sent the Spirit in the name of Christ to teach us the meaning of
the Word of Christ, and to lead us into all truth and holiness by the holy
Scriptures of truth. The Spirit did indite the whole Scripture; and it is
agreeable to the light of nature, that he who made the Law should expound it.
Vide Aug. lib. de doctrina christiana and Enchir. ad Laurentium.
This Holy Spirit is a public Spirit, he governes the whole body of Christ,
the whole Church, and speaks in the whole body of the Scriptures and every part
thereof, and if we do compare one place of Scripture with another, we shall by
comparing of Spiritual things with Spiritual, Doctrina nostra est publica,
quia est Doctrina Spiritus sancti in Scripturis public loquentis.
come to understand the saving wisdom which the Holy Ghost teaches; which
things we speak (says the Apostle) not in the words which man's wisdom
teaches, but which the Holy Ghost teaches, comparing spiritual things with
Spiritual, 1 Cor. 2. 13. The Holy Ghost speaking to us in plain places, Vide
Optatu^ contra Parmen. lib. 5. in Prin. and Tertul* de Anima Quis revelabit
quod Deus texit? P^aestat per Deum nescirc quia non revelaverit, quam per
hominem scire quia ipse praesumpserit. Caeli mysterium doceat me Deus ipse qui

does discover to us all that is necessary to be known and believed for our
eternal salvation, and does thereby give us so much light as that we may
sufficiently understand hard places, if we pray as we should, compare and
search the Scriptures as we ought in the Spirit of Faith, and modesty, Iam. 1.
5. Ioh. 5. 39. Mat. 7. 7. 1 Ioh. 5. 14. Romans 2. 2. 3. and practice what we know
before, Ioh. 7. 17. Phil. 3. 15, 16. for we shall at least learn so much
wisdom as not to expound hard places of Scripture in any sense that is
contrary to the mind of the Spirit clearly delivered in plain places of
Scripture. If we expound hard places according to the Analogy of Faith clearly
delivered in other places, though we should mistake in the application, yet the
Spirit does so far interpose as to keep us from falling into heresy. And if we
meet with no plain places to expound an hard place by, there is then no danger
of heresy; because all things necessary to salvation are set down clearly in
the plain places of Scripture. This conference of Scriptures is an excellent
means to bring us acquainted with all Book-cases, the determinations which the
Spirit has made in Scripture, Damasc^ de orth. fid. lib. 1. cap. 1* 2. Aug. de

and left there upon Record in those sacred Rolls (which are the treasury of
the Church) for the direction of the Saints. And whether we make use of this
ordinance in our private reading, or in the public ministry, the spirit does
deliver his judgment authoritatively and infallibly in the holy Scriptures,
and we may come to be acquainted with the mind and judgment of the Spirit by
both Ordinances. Thine eyes shall see Nos Ecclesiae Ministerium in honor
habemus, internas persuasiones sine externo verbo tanquam Satanae ludibria
cavemus; ex Scripturis sapimus, cum Scripturis sentimus, propter Scripturas
credimus: Whitaker de Authoritate Script. lib. 1. cap. 10. prope finem. and

thy teachers, And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying, This is
the way [this and not that, behold a clear direction] walk ye in it, continue,
and go forward in it, do not forsake it; when we are wavering and even turning
out of our way on one hand or the other, when ye turn to the right hand, and
when ye turn to the left, Item de Catechis. rudibus. cap 3, 4* 6, 7, etc.
then, even then does the Spirit resolve us, and put us out of doubt; when we
are disputing, and even yielding up the truth in a controversy, we have a
clear, certain, and infallible direction from the holy Spirit, Isa 30, 20, 21.
Isa. 30. 20, 21.


The Holy Ghost does exhort the Jews to compare the dimmer light of the
Prophers with the cleerer light of the Apostles that so the Sun of
righteousness may shine in its strength with its healing beams into their
hearts; Verbum Dei est lux, lucerna, lumen ad Deum dirigens i^ Agendis,
Credendis, Sperandis, amandis.
and then tells them that no Prophecy of the Scripture is of private
interpretation, because Prophets spoke [as the Apostles also did] not as the
will of man did move, or the fancy of man direct; but according to the mind and
will of the Holy Ghost. Psalm. 19.
And therefore since all the Scriptures were endited, Psalm. 119.
2 Pet. 1. 16* 19.
all are to be expounded by the Holy Ghost speaking in the Scriptures thus
compared; Vide Chamier. de Veritate Canonis, Interior Magister docet, Christus
docet, inspiratio ipsius docet. Aug. Tract. 3. in Epist. Johan. Non dicit

for the Holy Ghost did move all the Holy men, Apostles as well as Prophets to
write, and teach them what they should write. And though we have no
extraordinary revelations now by a voice from the excellent glory for our
direction, yet we have that which is better, the writings of the Prophets and
Apostles to compare together; the Prophesies be dark, yet they are sure, more
sure then those voices, which may be more easily counterfeited; and though the
Prophesies be dark, yet the Spirit who did endite them, will if you compare
them with the writings of the Apostles, Chamier de Interpret. lib. Canon.
give light to both, and deliver his judgment as clearly in all necessary
points as if it were written with a Sun-beame; this I take to be the scope of
the Holy Ghost in that excellent discourse, Dr. Reynold, in his learned
conference with Heart chap. 2. Divis. 2. page 46. Mr. Hildersham in his 145
Lecture upon the 51 Psalm. page 697. Dr. Alting. Loc. com.

consulted the most judicious and experienced writers upon that place, though I
cite but few in the margin, because I have not time to peruse them again.

True it is that we are not to believe every spirit, and therefore are
permitted to try the spirits whether they be of God or no, 1 John 4. 1. But in
this trial the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scriptures is the suprem Judge, and
the Holy Spirit does condemn all erroneous and fantastical spirits, Erroneous
and fantastical spirits are condemned by the Holy Spirit. Vide D. Whitak.
controv. 1. de Script. Interpret. qu. 5. cap. 4, and de Authoritate Scripturae
lib. 1. cap. 10. in calce capitis.
who forsake old truths, and pretend to follow New Light. The holy Spirit does
constantly teach the same truth in the holy Scriptures; for he does not change
his mind, or contradict himself. We (says the Apostle) having the same spirit
of Faith according as it is written, I believed and therefore have I spoken, 2
Cor. 4* 13 Ingenue fatemur non esse nunc novas revelationes expectandas, sive a
summo pontifice sive a Concilio sive ab Ecclesia tota. Canus lib. 2. cap. 7.
we also believe and therefore speak, 2 Cor. 4. 13. The same spirit does lead
all the faithful into all truth necessary to salvation, not Absolutely, and at
once, but by degrees. For we see the Apostles themselves were for a time guilty
of gross errors Mark 10. 37, 41. Act. 1. 6. But the faithful cannot
obstinately hold and continue in such odious and damnable errors as do
directly overthrow the foundation of Faith; And for the time in which they do
err, they hearken to their own spirits so far as they are carnal, and do
not as they ought, search, and pray, and wait for the direction of the Holy
Spirit. Ma^k 10. 37, 41.
It is not the Spirit of Faith which speaks in them, Act. 1. 6. (...). Aristot.
Ethic lib. 5. cap. 7. Non eritijs matutina lux. Isa. 8. 20. Judices ejus lu^i

when they dissent from such as receive the public Testimony of the Holy
Ghost speaking in the holy Scriptures. And therefore the Spirit teaches us to
try the spirits and doctrines of men by the Scriptures, if they speak not
according to this Word, it is not because they have new light from the spirit,
but because they have no light, no morning light, heavenly light conveyed unto
them in that point wherein they dissent, Revelatio mihi in conscientia mea
facta est Privata ex part Subjecti, Publica vero ex part Objecti.
or they have not as yet received it; the spirit has not as yet sealed that
portion of truth to their consciences, or writ it in their hearts. For the
spirit does not whisper one thing in private to my conscience, and declare the
contrary in his public Testimony delivered in the Word. Behold (says the
wisdom of God) I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words
unto you Pro. 1. 23* Pro. 1. 23.
For this is the Covenant of God, Ecclesia Instrumen taliter commovet sed non
sola movet; movent ipsae Scripturae movet Spiritus, and Principaliter movent.

that his Word and spirit should go together, and the spirit should deliver his
public Testimony Authoritatively as it becomes his supremacy and sovereignty
in the holy Scriptures. This is my Covenant with them says the Lord, my spirit
that is upon thee, and my Word, etc. Isa. 59. 21. Isa. 59. 21.
And by attendance on the ministry of the Gospel in the Church of Christ we
receive the Spirit, Non potest Deus nisi per Deum intelligi, sicut nec honorem
a nobis Deus nisi per Deum accipit -- non cogitando aut dispatando veritatem
homo assequi potest, sed audiendo ab eo qui solus docere potest, Hilarious de
Trinitate lib. 5. Vide D. Whitaker de Sacra Scriptura controv. 1. qu. 3. c. 8.
Gal. 3. 2. By hearing the doctrine of Faith preached in the Gospel they
received the Spirit, and therefore the ministry of the Gospel is called the
ministration of the Spirit, 2 Cor. 3. 8. And for these reasons we try the
doctrines and Spirits of men by the word of God, because the Spirit who is the
Author of Scripture does every where agree with himself, and there is a
friendly relation between the truth of the party witnessing, Judicium practicae
Discretionis a dono coele sli pendet, ex infuso lumine Spiritus Sancti oritur,
non ex privato sensu aut phantasmate, and ad normam verbi exigitur simul and
dirigitur. Distinguit itaque D. Davenantius inter Iudicium Discretionis, and
Iudicium Praecipitationis. Non ad enthysiasmos itaque fanaticos, vel asslatus

and the truth of the thing witnessed. We do readily acknowledge that the world
does look upon this public testimony of the Spirit in the word as a private
testimony, and are apt to scoff at them who receive it, as at men led by their
own private spirit; but the true reason is because this testimony of the Spirit
is not manifest to them who have not the Spirit. But it is so manifest to them
that have had this public testimony sealed up to their consciences, that they
will hold fast this testimony though it cost them their lives. I saw under the
Altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the
testimony which they held. Rev. 6. 9. The testimony which they held is no other
then that public testimony which the Spirit delivers in the Word, and had
privately sealed up to their Spirits. They were slain for the Word of God, and
for the testimony which they held according to that Word. They were Martyred
because they gave testimony of that truth, which they had learnt in the Word of
God.

I am willing to dwell longer upon this subject, because it is Fundamentum
Fundamentorum, and therefore we will for our better satisfaction descend from
handling the point in. General unto some very weighty points in particular,
and show how the Spirit does persuade the hearts and consciences of men to
receive his testimony in particular controversies, which have been raised and
disputed by men of great wit and Spirit.

they do as diverse Heretics have done before them, urge visions, miracles,
traditions, successions, prudentiall motives, and sometimes Councels, Fathers,
and for a fairer pretense, the holy Scriptures. But when they are beaten off
from their pretending to Councels and Fathers by our learned Whitaker, Jewel,
Abbot, Usher, Rainolds, not to name Chamier and other Worthyes, what lamentable
shifts do they make when they are pressed to stand to the public testimony
and judgment of the Holy Ghost delivered in the holy Scriptures? We do
therefore in compassion to their poor souls entreat them to hearken to the
Spirit of Christ, and not to the Spirit of Antichrist; 1 Cor. 2. 13. Ephesians. 6.
16. 17.
because the right sense of the Scripture expounded by the Scripture is the
sword of Gods Spirit where with all heresies whatsoever are overcome by all
those good soldiers, who add the shield of Faith to the Sword of the Spirit.
But when men neglect the Scriptures, and idolize humane inventions they spend
their strength in vain, The Popes Infallible Supremacy tried by the Holy Ghost.
and are like the blind men of Sodom who wearied themselves to find the door.
The great point of the Popes Infallible Supremacy can never be proved by the
Original, Universal and Perpetual Tradition of the Church of Christ in all
Ages; no, nor by the unanimous consent of all learned men now living in
communion with the present Church of Rome.

The Sorbon Doctors cannot believe that the Popes of Rome are not subject to
the sins and passions of other men; and if the succession of Popes which they
brag of were to be tried by Fame, Celebrity, Antiquity, Consent; it is most
evident to all that are acquainted with pure antiquity, and impartial History,
Read the Protestation of learned Protestants, repeated by Bp. Jewel, and Doct.
Rainoldes in his conference with Heart, 8 cap. first Division, page 393.
that the Supremacy of the Popes and Papacy would be sufficiently condemned;
but if the Popes infallible Supremacy come to be tried by the Holy Ghost,
speaking in the holy Scriptures, the Popes and Papacy will be infallibly
condemned by the Supreme Judge.

The learned Vide Francis. Pic. Mirandul. Theor. in expos. Theor. 4ti. Thom.

Papists do not agree concerning the Infallible Propounder of Fundamental
points; for

1. Some say that the Popes proposal ex Cathedra is sufficient; but Gal. 1. 8.

2. Others say a Council without the Pope

3. Others, the Pope and Council both together; it seems the Pope is not sent
as Peter, to strengthen his brethren, but his brethren must be sent for to
strengthen him.

4. Some say both together is not sufficient, either in point of manners, or
matter of Faith, unless the acceptance of the Church Universal be superadded.

5. We are not able to reckon up the number of those who deny the infallibility
of the present Church and Pope of Rome.

6. They cannot give us in a perfect Inventory of all Vide Formam juramenti

I need say nothing of the Papal Reservations, Provisions, Mandates, and all
postnate Dictates, and Decrees which Bishops and Metropolitans, are by their*
Oath made to the Pope at their confirmation, obliged to observe. Nor will I
trouble my Reader with the distinction of Supremacy of knowledge in resolving
Church questions (because that they say belongs to the Fathers, Gratian.

who excelled the Popes in expounding of Scriptures) and Supremacy of Power to
decide Church causes. For this latter Supremacy, is that which Popes and
Cardinals and all must live by in the Court of Rome; and the former Supremacy
is purposely claimed for the support of this. But it was a long time before the
Popes presumed to challenge the power of deciding all the greater causes of the
Church thorowout the world; For the Bishops of Rome were at the first but
Bishops within their own City; then Metropolitans within their own Province,
afterward Archbishops or Patriarks over Metropolitans within their Princely
Diocese; and last of all their pride and policy being crowned with success
did swell them up to be Popes and Lords over all the Christian, or rather
Antichristian world.

The Ecclesiastical and Temporal Supremacy or Sovereignty of Popes is
condemned by Reason and History, D. Usher, Jewel, Rainolds, Whiker* Abbot,
Davenant, Bilson, Chamier, Gomarus.
by Fathers and Councels as others have proved at large; let us not therefore
be put off with that ridiculous piece of Sophistry, which is so common; The
Pope is infallible and supreme Head of the Church, and Lord of the World,
because the Scriptures mean so; Vide. Aenc. Silv. de gestis Basil. Council.
lib. 1. laco. Almain. de authoritate Ecclesiae cap. 8. Summi Poncifices suas
fimbrias nimis extenden^es alios Papas adducunt in teste^.
and the Scriptures mean so, because the Pope says so; who does not see that
the Scriptures are only put in for a mere stale? and therefore the Argument had
been as strong if they had proved the Popes Infallible Authority and Princely
Supremacy, by an ipse dixit at first. The Pope says he is Infallible, ergo he
is so. I am not at leisure to hear what the Pope who has endeavored to
dethrone Christ, and depose the Holy Ghost, says in his own behalf at Rome;
for if he once bring this great question to be resolved in his own Consistory,
he will soon bring all causes to be decided there also where he himself is
Plaintiff, Ask a thief or his fellow whether he be a thief. Vide ^. nullus
D. de testibus L. omnibus C* co. 4. 9. 2. and 3. c. si testes.
Witness and Judge; only in prudence and modesty he has entertained a company
of Cardinals (who are to divide the spoils with him) for his Grand Inquest.

The Popes Supremacy is unwritten, and therefore he is a fit Judge to decide
all controversies amongst the Traditionaries, whose faith is not written in
either Testament.

But since the Pope does strive with the Holy Ghost for the Chair, and Christ
for the Throne; let us hear what Christ and the Holy Ghost do both speak in
the Holy Scriptures of Truth, and we shall quickly decide this grand
controversy, and many more. Christ is the only Pastor of his Church, he is to
continue so and have no successor.

We find in holy Scripture, Christ is the only Head of his whole Church, Ephesians.
1. 22. Col. 2. 19. Ioh. 10. 16. Per pastorem unicum intelligimus Christum non
Papa^ Oecume^cum, Ioh. 10. 9. 14. 16 26, 27, 28. Sic per Davidem intelligimus
Christum, Eze. 37. 22, 23. 24. Ezekiel. 34. 23. 1 Pet. 2. 25. Heb. 13. 20
that Christ is the only Head and Savior of his whole Church, Ephesians. 1. 22.
Colos. 2. 19. he does and will continue with his Church always, even unto the
end of the world, to give life, sense and motion to it, and to rule and govern
the whole, and every member of it, by the effectual council and working of
his Holy Spirit.

The Apostles were but Ministerial Heads, or Principal Members who had a
pre-eminence over the inferior members for perfecting of the Saints by the
work of the Ministry, 1 Cor. 12. 21. 28. First Apostles: this eminent ministry
or Headship did belong to all the Apostles, and not to Peter only; the power of
remitting and retaining sins was given to the other Apostles as well as Peter,
Io. 20. 21, 22. 23. We deny not Peter to be the first Apostle in time, as
Andrew was the first Disciple; and therefore Peter is first reckoned, Mat, 10.
2. Nay we will not deny him to be most eminent in grace, Cuncti claves regni
Caeloru accipiant ex aequo. Hieronym advers. 10. vin. lib. 2. Vt Plato Princeps
Philosophorum, ita Petrus Apostoloru^ Hieron. adver. Pelag. lib. 1.
and for both reasons grant him to be first in Order: but we deny that he was
chief in dignity or Supreme in power; Because we know the Apostles had all
equal power; For Christ sent them all as his Father sent him: they had all of
them power to open heaven to believers, and shut it against unbeleevers. The
power of the Keys was given upon the confession which Peter made in the name
of all the rest, Mat. 16. 16. 18. as he was wont to do, Ioh. 6. 69. The
confession was common to all, the promise common to all, the performance common
to all, Ioh. 20. 21, 22, 23. I need say no more but this.

1. The Papists do entitle Peter to Vide Glos. extravagant. Ioh. 22. Potestas
summa Pap. six. 4. Sac. Cerem. eccles. Romans lib. 1. sect. 7. Leo's Sermons,
Epistles, Rhemish annot, in Mat. 16. 18.
But Peter and the rest of the Apostles were joint foundations built on Christ
the only proper head and foundation, Ephesians. 2. 20.

2. They entitle the Pope to that power Peter, but Peter had no successor in
his extraordinary and Apostolic power, the Pope is no Apostle; Vide Annot.
Romae excus. in Cyprian. De aequalitate. Apostolatus qui cum Apostolis
morientibus cessavit nec ad Episcopos transijt.
and when Peter speaks of his ordinary power, he tells the Elders that he is
their Fellow-Presbyter. I who am also an Elder exhort the Elders, Vide Comarum
part 3. Disp. 22. de Petri Apostoli and Papae Romani r^pug. Dr. Raynolds in
his conference with Heart Chap. 6. Division 3. page 209. 210, 211, 212.
1 Timothy 5. 1. But that Peter was an ordinary Bishop of one City, First of
Antioch for seven years, and then of Rome for twenty-five, cannot be proved by
Scripture, no nor by any credible Historian. I know they rely upon Eusebius his
testimony. But it is enough for me to reply, that Eusebius his History does
dissent from his Chronicle, and his Chronicle does dissent from Scripture.

who can challenge the Supreme Sovereignty of deciding controversies by an
infallible Sentence: It is the Spirit that makes the word to be effectual. 1
Cor. 3. 7. As Christ works by his Spirit he has no Vicar; for he himself is
with his Disciples always to the end of the world, Mat. 20. Christ himself
does Baptize with the Holy Ghost: he himself did open the heart of Lydia.

4. The Pope challenges this power over Paul was the Apostle of the Gentiles by
the appointment of the Holy Ghost, and Peter's own consent, Romans 11. 13. Act.
13. 2. Gal. 2. 9. Paul was chief and labored more abundantly then any in this
service.

Peter did never claim or exercise any such power over the Princes and
Kingdoms of the world as the Pope does, Lu. 22. 25, 26. Mat. 20. 25, 26.

Peter had desired and usurped any Supremacy over the rest of the Apostles, he
had thereby degraded himself, and been last of all, Mark 9. 34, 35.

If the vices of Popes may make them Supreme or their errors infallible, Vna
vetula potest esse perfectior ac major ipso Papa perfectione Gratiae and
amplitudinc Virtutum. Turrecrem In Summa de Eccles. lib. 2. c. 82.
we are able to prove that by fraud, violence and such like black arts, they
have usurped a power over the consciences of men to lead them unto Heresy,
Antichristianisme, Atheism; For by endeavoring to prove their Infallibility
by the Scripture, and then venting gross errors as infallible truths upon the
authority of the Pope and Church, they have tempted some to believe neither
Church nor Pope nor Scripture; The Pope has told them that they had as good
believe nothing as not believe all; and therefore it is to be feared, that too
many believe nothing at all. Let us then to the Law and the Testimony, The Law.
and let Christ and his Spirit be heard speak in them, and we will proceed to
trial with the Papists upon what points they please. The First Table.
We will try all their new Tutelar Gods, whether Angels or dead men, or their
breaden God in the Mass by the 1 Command. Their picturing of God and
worshipping of him by pictures by the Second Commandment.

Their Superstitious benedictions, Magical Incantations, exorcismes, and all
those helps to salvation, which salt, wax, spittle, bells can afford, by the
third Commandment; and so I might proceed to the Holy Days, Masses, etc. or
try their Popes usurpations, the cruelty of their Inquisition, their allowance
of Fornication forbidding to marry, their equivocations, rebellious
concupiscence by the Second Table We will by the Gospel of Christ try the
Doctrine of Justification by works, The Second Table. The Gospel.
their public prayers in an unknown tongue, their denying of the Testament of
Christ's blood to the people; we will examine whether there be more sacrifices
of Christ then one? whether they that dye in Christ rest from their labors? I
might proceed to examine their Doctrine, concerning the Offices and benefits of
Christ; concerning the nature and use of faith, and the Doctrine of the
Sacraments, and the rest of the points in controversy between us and the
Papists. And truly when I do read such questions as these I cannot but think
of those Texts, 1 Timothy 4. 1. 2, 3. Now the Spirit speaks expressly, etc. the
Spirit does so expressly condemn these seducing and erring Spirits, that
whosoever will be persuaded by the evident demonstrations of the Spirit, and be
overruled by his positive definitions in Scripture, will confess that the
Papists were very wise in offering to be tried by unwritten Traditions, or the
Pope and his adherents, in all points in question. It is clear that the Popes
have taught for Doctrines the Commandments of men. He that reads the Epistles
to the Romans and Galathians, 1 Cor. 14. Chap. the second Chapter to the
Colossians, the second Chapter of the second Epistle to the Thessalonians; and
the plainer places of the Book of the Revelation, will acknowledge the Spirit
does speak expressly.

The Pope must therefore be beholding to his Schoolmen to defend his Doctrine,
The grand Pillars both of Popery and the Papacy.
and to his Canonists to keep up his Discipline, and pretend no more to
Scriptures or pure Antiquity for his Justification.

If the Anti-Scripturists would but hearken to the Spirit speaking in the
Scripture, Anti-Scripturists.
they would say the Spirit has magnified both Law and Gospel, and made them
honorable, precious and glorious in our eyes.

I will not insist upon those many convincing arguments whereby the Scriptures
are undeniably proved to be the word of God, but humbly desire all men to
consider whether the true reason (why those Arguments do not effectually
persuade obstinate men) be not clearly this, The true reason why men do not
believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God*
because men do undervalue the testimony of the Holy Ghost, and resist, vex,
grieve, or quench the Holy Spirit, whose office it is to seal up this and all
other saving truths to our consciences and hearts.

True it is that the law of God is written in our hearts by nature, The Law.
but our nature is corrupted, and we are blinded with pride, passion,
prejudice, with self conceitednes and self-love, and therefore it is
requisite that the wrath of God should be revealed from heaven against pleasing
gainful sins; nay, unnatural sins, Rom 1. 18. to the end of the Chapter. The
Gospel.
Moreover, it is to be sadly considered that the Gospel is not written in our
hearts by nature, nor can it be found out by any artificial Demonstration, but
it is discovered to us by Divine Revelation, Romans 1. 16, 17.

I know many learned men have used the testimony of humane Authors in a
Secondary and subservient way to confirm our Faith in this point: but it is
clear that we must rest our Faith upon the Authority of God in this and all
other points, or else our Faith will not be a Divine Faith.

God swears by himself, because he is the greatest, The prime and infallible
Truth bears witness to it self.
and does bear witness to himself in his word; Nay, to his Word, in his Word,
because he is the truest, for he is indeed the prime truth, the only
Infallible Truth. And hence it is that the Scriptures are called the
testimonies of God, and the testimony of the Spirit is so often produced, 1
Pet. 1. 11. Act. 5. 32. 1 Ioh. 5. 6. It is no shame to adhere to the Testimony
of God in the weightiest point, Psalm. 119. 31, 46. Hence it is that the Penmen
do so often show their Commission and cry thus says the Lord. And hence it is
that God does so often own the Scriptures for his word. This is my word says
God, this came from my inspiration says the Spirit. 2 Timothy 3. 16. 2 Pet. 1.
21. This is my writing says Jehovah, I will own it, and stand to it. I have
written to him the great things of my Law says God, Hos. 8. 12. The Scriptures
are the Oracles of God Romans 3. 2. They contain the counsel of God, Act. 20. 27.
God has given us sufficient assurance that the Law was written by his own
finger, and all other books by his spec^al command and inspiration. All
Scripture is given by inspiration of God, 2 Timothy 3. 16 Prophecy^ame not in old
time; the word is (...), it came not at any time by the will of man but Holy
men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, 2 Pet. 1. 21. Our
Savior gives a full testimony to Moses, David, the rest of the Penmen of the
Psalms, and all the Prophets; Luke 24, 44. God has sealed the testimony of the
Penmen by miracles on men and devils, we need not expect new miracles to
confirm this Old Testament and ancient Gospel; both are confirmed by the old
miracles which stand upon Record in both; But if any man preach a New Gospel,
we may well call upon him for new miracles. Nay the very preservation of the
Scriptures in despite of Tyrants, Heretics and Devils is a convincing
miracle. In a word, the Testimony of the Penmen is sealed

1. By the Oath of God, 2. By the blood of Christ, 3. By the testimony of the
Spirit, 4. By the Efficacy of the Spirit.
The Testimony and Efficacy of the Spirit is that sweet Subject which I am now
more especially engaged to insist upon; the Testimony of the Spirit to the
heart and conscience of every true believer in particular is a convincing
Testimony.

But it will be said, that this is such an Argument as none can take notice of
and therefore altogether insufficient to persuade other men to believe, to whom
no such Testimony has been vouchsafed.

1. I answer. This is an Argument indeed whereby I cannot convince others: but
this is an Argument which makes all other Arguments effectual to convince me.

2. The Efficacy of the Spirit in the word upon the hearts of enemies is very
considerable. Their minds are enlightened, their judgments convinced, their
consciences awakened, Heb. 4. 12, 13.
terrifyed, their hearts smitten, because the very thoughts of their hearts are
strangely and unexpectedly discovered, 2 Cor. 3. 6.
their souls embowelled, 2 Cor. 2. 16.
and their marrow as it were melted in their bones by this almighty spirit
speaking, testifying, working in and with the word: the very letter kills them,
the very savor confounds them, though bold Athiests scoff at the word, and do
in their Jovial fits blaspeme the spirit; yet sometimes their hearts quake
their joints tremble, even as Belshazzars did at the very sight of the
handwriting, when they do but glance their eye upon some startling Text. Their
consciences do often join with the word and spirit against themselves against
their wills; for though they be self-willed, yet they are after some
soule-searching Admonition self-confounded and selfe-condemned men, Tit. 3. 10,
11. And though the malice of some men be too strong for their wit, reason, and
conscience; yet it is not too strong for the spirit in the Word; all the powers
of Hell in them are over-powred by this good Spirit; all the strongholds of
Satan batterd, and they themselves so confounded, that they seem to be even
damned already, they think themselves in Hell above-ground, when they are
stung and bitten, they fall into the passion of the heart, and are taken with
such Hellish convulsion-sits that they do even foam at mouth, Act. 7. 54.
and gnash with their teeth, Rev. 11. 10
they are cut to the soul, Act. 5. 39.
and tormented in their conscience, they cry and howl and fight against the
Spirit, but all in vain; for even they are outwitted and over-powred, who are
not converted by this stinging Efficacy of the Almighty Spirit.

What shall we say to these things? If Idols have been overthrown, Oracles
silenced, Devils convinced by the Majesty of the Spirit in the holy Scriptures,
and so over awed by the Spirit that they have been forced to confess, nay
believe these truths at which they tremble; then surely those bold theists are
worse then devils who do not tremble at the Word because they do not believe
the Spirit.

3. Look upon a soul in its Agony and Pangs, in its Throws and conflicts at
its first conversion, or in its After-throws upon some sadrelapse, and observe
how the wit is captivated, reason conquered, conscience confounded, heart
broken, and will turned, nay all the powers of corrupt nature overpowred and
overturned by the word and spirit of God; And then you must needs cry out, O
the divine Efficacy of Scripture, which turns a Lion into a Lamb, a Goat into a
sheep; a man, a Beast, a Devil into a Saint, and persuades Philosophers and
Courtiers, Emperors and soldiers, Publicans and Harlots, Mariners and
Politicians to embrace a Religion, and run a course clean contrary to the
carnal and Divelish wisdom of their proud reason, contrary to the stubborn
resolutions of their perverse wills; in a word, contrary to their very nature,
education, custom, contrary to dictates of policy and reasons of state,
contrary to their passions, lusts, interests friends Companions. O victorious
spirit! What aileth what aileth thee, O thou man of war, and pride, thou
Secretary of nature, and Advocate of the Devil to h^ng the head and weep, to
resign thy estate, lay down thy Commission, and thy Arms, burn thy
Conjuring-books, and sacrifice thy dearest life in the maintenance of that
truth which thou have formerly contemned? I must cry as he did (...). This is
the power of the Word: Behold the Efficacy of the Spirit in the word conquering
and triumphing over the subtilty and obstinacy, the pride and malignity of
carnal men. The promises of God are better then all the proffers of Satan: the
devil shows us the glory of the world: the Scripture shows us the vanity of
the world, and the conscience is convinced by the word and Spirit, that the
reversion of Heaven is infinitely better then the possessions of earth: all the
kingdoms of the world and glory of them are not worth one days Communion with
Jesus Christ, nay one days comfort from the Gospel and Spirit of Jesus Christ.
Good reason have we then to believe the Spirit. Angels admire, and Devils
tremble at the Majesty of the word, Saints believe, obey, adore the Majesty of
the Spirit speaking in the word of truth and life, of grace and glory.

The Familists might learn by this sad discourse to believe the Spirit of God
speaking in the word of God, The Familists.
and not believe their own natural, carnal, fantastical spirits which
contradict the word and spirit of God. The Familists did learn of the Papists
to call Orthodox Protestants Scripture men, to scoff at them as
Scripture-wise, and to say as Stapleton and diverse others do, H. Nicolas (...)
the Gosp^l of the ^ingdome. Dr Rainolds Confe^^nce with Heart cap. 1. divis 2.
page, 60. 61 H^^lets Epistle in Queen Elizabeth.
that the most diligent conference of Scriptures is the ready way to the most
damnable errors. That the fountains of Greek and Hebrew are neither pure, nor
necessary; and the like. And yet Howlet in his Epistle to Queen Elizabeth did
lay the sin of the Family of love to the charge of the Protestants. But Dr.
Raynolds our learned Champion in his conference with Heart, does vindicate the
Protestants, and make it evident that such as were godly and learned in the
Scripture, did detest Harry Nicolas that imp of Satan and master of the Family
of Love, and therefore they could not lay the Families sinto our charge as if we
did foster that venomous vipers brood (I keep to the Doctors own expressions
that you may see how the zeal of that meek Moses was enflamed in this contest)
which did march into the field with Papists to strengthen their hands against
Protestants.

The Anabaptists likewise might learn from hence to make the spirit speaking in
the word the Judge of their pretended Revelations, The Anabaptists.
if they were not too conceited of their own inventions, and apt to fall in
love with the dreams of their own feverish brain, with their weak arguments,
but strong delusions.

The Arminians the constant enemies of the Grace of God should consider that
the Pelagians the advocates of Free Will and corrupt nature, The Arminians

were confounded with those plain Scriptures which were urged by the Councels

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; should consider that the Arrians were overthrown
by the Scriptures in the Nicene council, and by the godly Pastors of the
Church, who instead of broken Scriptures (which the Arians urged with as much
fraud as the devil did, Mat. 4.) produced plain Scriptures and the whole Series
of both Testaments, and so did invincibly refute their blasphemous errors.

The Libertines who claym a liberty of publishing damnable Heresies and
blasphemies under pretense of Prophesying, The Libertines
might learn, that where the Spirit of the Lord is, 2 Cor. 3. 17*
there is liberty, 1 Cor. 12. 3*
true liberty, but no where else; for he who protends to speak by the Holy
Ghost, 1 John 2, 22, 23.
and yet denies Jesus to be the Lord, does at once blaspheme Christ and the
Holy Spirit, and is an Anti-spiritual Liar, an Antichristian Blasphemer, and
has neither Father, Son nor Spirit dwelling in him. For he who speaks by the
Spirit does acknowledge Jesus to be the Lord, The Enemies of the Trinity are
Antichristian.
1 Cor. 12. 3. And he who denies the Son has not the Father. Who is a liar but
he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist who denies the Father
and the Son; whosoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father, 1 Jo. 2.
22, 23.

In like manner, every Spirit which confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in
the flesh, is not of God but of Antichrist, Dr. Sibs his judgment concerning
liberty of Prophesy.
1 John 4. 2, 3. This is that Vorstian liberty which has undone so many
Nations already, and is now Idolized in England under the name of Liberty of
Conscience, by such as have neither Conscience nor liberty. Reverend Dr. Sibbs
did exceedingly cry out against this kind of Liberty in his time. Dr, Sibs his
Epistle before Mr. Baines his Commentary upon the Ephesians*
He would not have way given to Vorstian lawless licencious liberty of
prophecy: that every one so soon as he is big of some new conceit, should
bring forth his abortive Monster; for then the Pillars of Christian Faith will
soon be shaken, and the Church of God which is an house of Order, will be^ome a
Babel, an house of Confusion. The doleful issues of which pretended Liberty,
we see in Polonia, Transylvania, and in Countries nearer hand.

I might proceed, but this is sufficient for a taste; and if I should but name
all the errors of this age and not confute them, I should abuse my Reader, and
therefore I desire to stop in time, and beseech all that are spiritually minded
to hea^ken to the Spirit speaking in the word. A^ Exhortation to believe the
Holy Spirit.
Beloved believe not every spirit, but believe the Holy Spirit, who is the
Author of the Scriptures, the Author of Faith, the Judge of Controversies, the
interpreter of the Scriptures, the Doctor and comforter of the Elect, and he
will lead you into all necessary truth for your present edification and
everlasting Salvation.

The Holy Spirit will assure you that the Scriptures of truth were all written
by his own Authority, The Spirit does testify that the Scriptures are the lord
of God.
and you may safely set to your seal, when you have received the infallible
testimony of the Holy Ghost. We are witnesses of these things (says the
^postle) and so is the Holy Ghost also, Act. 5. 32. We shall never receive the
word, The Testimony of the Spirit supports our Faith in time of Temptation
as the Word of God, with joy, reverence, submission and assurance of Faith,
specially in times of ^ffliction and temptation, unless we receive the
witness of the Spirit, and ground our Faith upon the wisdom and evident
demonstration of When we look upon the word of God, and consider, Arguments for
the Holy Scriptures. See Mr. Hildersham upon the 51 Psalm and the seventh
verse, his 145. Lecture. Mr. Ball his larger Catechism. Master Hieron of the
Dignity of the Scriptures. Reverend Mr. White in his book newly Printed called
the way to the Tree of Life, the second and third chapters.


1, The wonderful consent of all those Holy and selfe-denying men that penned
it. 2. The mavelous fulfilling of all the strange Prophecies in the fulness
of time appointed by God. 3. The Admirable Providence of God in preserving the
Scriptures notwithstanding all the rage and malice of Heretics and
persecutors. 4. The supernatural Miracles wrought for to confirm it. 5. The
Harmonious testimony that the Church, Martyrs, Saints, have in all ages given
to it. 6. The Antiquity, Majesty, Efficacy of it. 7. The divine and heavenly
matter contained in it, 1. Mysteries above reason, Ps. 119. 129
1 Cor. 2. 9. 2. Commands contrary to our corrupt nature, sent to all Nations,
and even to the greatest and proudest of men. 3. Threats beyond the strength of
man to inflict* or the capacity of man to comprehend an hard heart, a seared
Conscience, and yet a trembling Spirit, a reprobate mind and sense, a spirit of
madness, giddiness, horror or slumber, an everlasting worm, eternal fire,
torments with the devil and his Angels. 4. Promises and rewards beyond the
power of man to bestow, or wisdom of Angels to comprehend, 1 Pet. 1. 12.

confounded, the obstinacy of man's heart subdued, all the pride of humane glory
stained, and the Scriptures appear to be the word of God. The Testimony of the
Spirit mak^ all other Arguments effectual for our conversion unto true Faith.


But now all these Arguments and many more which I could name, will not be
effectual for our regeneration and conversion, until the Spirit be pleased to
set all home upon the heart by his own irresistible efficacy, and seal this
truth to the Conscience by his own infallible testimony. But when the Spirit
speaks to and works upon our spirits, Vide Scholasticos de dono Discernendi

then we do assent and consent, to all the proposals of God; our very thoughts
are captivated and subdued unto the obedience of Christ, 2 Cor. 10. 5. Our
Conscience is convinced swayed and undeniably obliged to believe what is
promised, allow what is commanded, our will made willing to chose both, the

The divine Testimony of the Spirit is the true ground of justifying Faith; but
Historical Faith which may be in Devils Jam 2. and Temporary Faith which may
be in Reprobates, Luke 8. are not truly grounded on the Testimony, wisdom,
Authority, Revelation, or demonstration of the Spirit. We read of a Revelation
of flesh and blood, Mat. 16. 17. And the demonstration and Revelation of the
Spirit. 1 Cor. 2. 4. 10. 14, 15. Ephesians. 1. 17. A man who has nothing but sense
and Reason in him may have an Historical or a Temporary Faith; but he who does
upon the divine Testimony of the Spirit believe that Jesus is the Christ, he is
born of God, of the Spirit of God, and has the witness in himself, 1 John 5.

Spirit is not understood by us until we are renewed in the spirit of our mind,

therefore the Testimony of the Spirit is not received but by our renewed
Spirits, Romans 8. 16. Before we are Regenerate, we receive divine truths only
because we judge them reasonable, or because we find them in the Scriptures,
Tam certo scimus novum instrumentum esse divinum ac Judaei sciebant vetus
instrumentum esse Divinum. Joh. 9. 29. Joh. 5. 47. Joh. 5. 39. Our want of
Christ. The worth of Christ*
and we believe the Scriptures upon an Humane Testimony, and therefore only
with an Humane, not a Divine Faith. But the Spiritual man believes all upon
the testimony of the Spirit, and does constantly beg the direction of the good
Spirit. O thy Spirit is good says David, teach me, lead me, quicken me by thy
Spirit, Ps. 143. 10, 11. Finally, this good spirit discovers to a man before he
believes, 1. His want of Christ, 2. The worth of Christ.


His want of Christ by reason of 1. His heinous sins which are inexcusable,
damnable. 2. His Spiritual wants which are innumerable. 3. His present misery,
and slavery, which are unspeakable, unsupportable.


The worth of Christ, because he is an All-sufficient Savior, and only
Savior; the Spirit discovers the treasures of Free grace, the mysteries of
Divine Faith, which even Angels admire, the unsearchable riches of Christ, the
fullness of God, able to satiate the soul with heavenly, glorious, everlasting
happiness, and even infinite content. Then the soul is convinced by the
Spirit of God, The truth and goodness of the Covenant of Grace.
not only of the truth, but goodness of the Covenant made by God with man in
Christ, and that there are better things laid up for believers in Christ, then
any are or can be bestowed by Satan upon his greatest Agents, and dearest
favorites, the darlings of the flesh and world, and upon this account the
soul is persuaded by this demonstration of the spirit, to close with Christ,
and deny itself, to have no ability, wisdom, righteousness, will of its own,
but to seek wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption in Christ. 1
Cor. 1. 30. In a word to deny its own will, and take the will of Christ for its
rule and compass, to do or suffer any thing for Christ, to lose or sell all
for him.

The good spirit persuades us 1. To prize Christ highly, Psalm. 119. 103, 111,
112, 127, 128, 140.
even above all the kingdoms of the world, and glory of them. 2. To believe in
Christ steadfastly. 3. To love Christ deerly, Phil. 3. 8.
better then our selves, We must prize and love Christ above all things, and
cleave to him for evermore.
or dearest friends, better then worldly treasures, sensual joy, or any
carnal contentments whatsoever. 4. To follow Christ fully that we may enjoy
him eternally, as our Crown, our happiness, our heaven. And to this end and
purpose to set up the word of God in our Consciences as our only rule for to
direct us Psalm. 73. 26, 28.
1. In all points of Faith, 2. In all parts of worship, 3. In all passages of
our life and conversation: that we may cast out the world, the Devil, nay flesh
and self and all to make room for Christ.



Now when the Spirit has by its own evidence, Faith in all three persons.
testimony, authority, wisdom and efficacy wrought Faith in the soul, to
carry it into the arms of Jesus Christ, (...).
Christ does bid it welcome, Romans 5. 2.
embraces, kisses it, and takes this young believer by the hand, Ephesians. 2. 18.
and puts him into his Fathers bosom. Joh. 14. 6.
And when we are thus brought to believe in Father, Heb 7. 25.
Son, 1 Pet. 1. 21.
and Holy Ghost, then we are fitted and prepared to worship and obey all three
glorious persons as one God blessed forever. And therefore, I may now proceed
to speak of the worship of all three, and then of our obedience to all three.

This grand Mystery of Faith has an effectual influence into our
Gospel Worship. The worship of the divine Trin-unity.
He takes the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in vain, and does not make
that Holy use which he should of the Titles, Properties, works and Ordinances
of all three, who does not with Knowledge, Faith, Reverence, sincerity and
spiritual joy worship all three; for this is true Gospel Worship. And
therefore, The fourth and fifth chapters of this Treatise must be compared with
this ninth chapter.
I would entreat my Reader diligently to consider what I have delivered in the
fourth, and fifth chapters of this Treatise concerning the divine Nature,
Titles, Properties, works of all three in order to worship for the glory of the
thrice illustrious, and yet single God head; and then if he will study the
scope of the first Table of the Holy Law of God, and the substance of
Gospel Worship, he will acknowledge that every one who believes in all three
persons will find his Faith obliging and inclining him to worship al three
glorious persons as one God blessed for ever.

God the Father is to be wo^shipped with Divine worship.
I have touched this point already, and because it is not much controverted by
our grand enemies, I shall not insist long upon it.

All the knowledge of God which we gain by the Scriptures of truth, See learned
Mr. R^ndoll his great Mystery of godliness.
is revealed to us on purpose for our direction in the worship of God; we must
not worship God according to our own devices, but according to that discovery
which God has made of himself to us in his Holy word, Dr. Downham on the
Lords Prayer.
not only in respect of his divine nature (as when our Savior says God is a
Spirit, Mr. Burroughes of Gospel Worship, and Gospel-conversation.
and from thence concludes, that God is to be worshipped in Spirit and truth,)
but in respect of the Divine Persons also.

We are to worship God, as a Creator, as the first of Causes, Mr. Thomas
Goodwin his Triumph of Faith.
last of Ends, best of Beings, to whom we owe our Being, and our well-being;
but we must worship God the Father as God, and look upon him as the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and as our Father reconciled to us in Christ; this is
that worship which becomes the Gospel; Distinguendum est inter objectum
considerationis, and objectum Adorationis; inter objectum, Adorationis
materiale and Formale. Pater enim qua Pater abstracta ratione Deitatis non est
adorandus; ipsa enim Deitas est ratio Formalis Adorationis.
and therefore we ought to worship God the Father considered after this
Evangelicall manner, that he may be glorified, we moved and affected with those
endearing expressions, O God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our
Father in him. Such expressions as these do beget in us,

1. Holy boldness mixed with Reverence. Ephesians. 3. 12. (...)*


2. Christian confidence; our Father will supply the wants of his children out
of his rich treasure, for he commands Heaven and earth.

3. Filial Love, and cheerful obedience, which are even con-naturall to our
new man upon due consideration of this sweet relation between God and us, Ier.
3. 19.

4. A thankful acknowledgement of Gods fatherly bounty, even unto admiration;
Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be
called the sons of God, 1 John 3. 1. Nay heirs of God, Romans 8. 17. What are we
vile wretches, worms and no men, yea by reason of our filthiness, Dogs, and
Devils, that we should be adopted into the family of God, married to the Son
of God, and made co-heyrs with the Lord of glory! When the Spirit of a man is
raised by such thankful acknowledgements unto an Holy admiration, then it is
brought into a Gospel frame, and by such high and sweet thoughts of Gods
fatherly love and bounty fitted for filial and Gospel Worship.

But it will be said that the whole Trinity is our Father, In what sense the
whole Trinity is our Father.
and therefore all three persons are to be worshipped under that fatherly
consideration, and in that dear Relation.

To which I answer,

essentially, though all creatures are excluded, yet all the three Divine
persons are included, because they are coequal, they have one nature, will and
worship; they are one and the same God, and they are one Father also in
opposition to Images, Ier. 2. 27. Jer. 2. 27.
To Saints, Is. 63. 16. Isa. 63. 16.
Doubtless thou art our Father, Deuteronomy. 32. 6
though Abraham be ignorant of us, Jer. 31. 9.
and Israel acknowledge us not. Thou O Lord art our Father, our Redeemer, thy
name is from everlasting. And in opposition to all creatures, Mat. 23. 9. and
in the Lords Prayer, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are all called upon as our
Father.

The word Father is sometimes taken personally, and attributed to a single
person of the Godhead. More frequently, and more peculiarly to God the Father,
who is the first Principle of subsisting life (even in respect of his own
natural and Co-essentiall Son, as has been proved at large in this Treatise)
and is to be reckoned first in order; and finally in regard of our Adoption and
the mysterious and divine Economy and dispensation vouchsafed for the
salvation of man; and yet these peculiar notions do not exclude the other
persons from being God, as has been proved above in the fourth chapter, nor do
they exclude them from being our Father in the common notion of Father in
opposition to creatures and Idols; Christ is our Father
nay all three persons have a Fatherly care of us, Isa. 9. 6. Heb. 2. 13, 14.
and love to us, and therefore Christ is called our Father, Isa. 9. 6. and Heb.
2. 13, 14. And it is the proper office of the Holy Ghost to Regenerate us, The
Holy Ghost is our Father.
as it is of the Father to Adopt us; but then the Father does Adopt us in
Christ who is a Father to us, though a Son to God the Father, and the holy
Spirit is the Spirit of Regeneration and Adoption, and therefore all three
Co-essentiall persons are our Father.

Steven directed his to the Lord Jesus, Act. 7. 59. Lord Jesus receive my
Spirit.

We may direct our Prayers expressly unto two of the divine persons. Now God
himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you, 1
These. 3. 11.

Cor. 13, 14.

because the Persons are in one another; the Father is in the Son, and they are
all three coessentiall, coequall; They are one God, and therefore are to be
worshipped with that self same religious and divine Worship which is due to
their single and undivided Godhead.

When we direct our prayer to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, God the
Father considered as our Father in a peculiar way.
the term Father is taken in a peculiar notion, not in the common notion, and
the Apostle directs his prayer after this peculiar manner, Ephesians. 3. 14. For this
cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the
whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named. God the Father looks upon us poor
worms as part of his Family, nay, as his dear children whilst we are here on
earth, as well as he looks upon his other children, the glorious Saints* who
are made perfect in heaven. Evangelicall encouragement to Gospell-worship.
Oh what a quickening consideration is this, to bring us upon our knees at a
Throne of grace before Christ's Father, and our Father, that we may have a
child's Portion, and be prepared for that place which Christ is now preparing
for us! We are part of the Family numbered amongst those of the best rank; Ioh.
20. 17. Ephesians. 3. 14.
we are children, and have the same Father that Christ and the Saints in heaven
have. John 20. 17. Ephesians. 3. 14. and therefore shall come to be Coheires with
Christ and them. Here is heavenly encouragement unto Gospell-worship, and
Gospell-conversation. 1 Timothy 1.
2. 2 Timothy 1. 2.
Tit. 1. 4.
Phile. 1. 3.
Romans 1. 7.
It is no wonder then if that Gospell-worship be frequently performed to God
under this endearing consideration and in this sweet and comfortable relation.
1 Cor. 1. 3.
The Apostle wishes us grace and peace from God our Father, 2 Cor. 1. 2.
and the Lord Jesus Christ, Gal. 1. 3.
Romans 1. 7. and in like manner 1 Cor. Phil. 1. 2.
1 3. 2 Cor. 1. 2. Col. 1. 2.
Observe that solemn form of thanksgiving. 2 Cor. 1. 3. 4.
Blessed be God, Col. 1. 3.
even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of mercies, Ephesians. 1. 2, 3.
and the God of all comfort, 1 These. 1. 2.
2 Cor. 1. 3. 2 These. 1. 2.
Oh how willingly and cheerfully do we run to the God of all mercies and
comfort in a time of temptation and affliction! Joh. 16. 27.
2 Cor. 1. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 3.
For the Father discovers his bowels of mercy on purpose to invite us to him.
The Father himself loves you, John 16. 27. All spiritual glorious eternal
blessings, our Election, Redemption, Salvation, are ascribed to this Father of
all grace, mercy, comfort, glory. Christ redeemes us according to the will of
God and our Father, Gal. 1. 4. John 10. 17, ^8. Blessed be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
heavenly things in Christ according as he has chosen us. Ephesians. 1. 3, 4* 11.
Much more might be said to this purpose; but this may suffice: It is now time
to proceed to my next Point, which is, that

2. Divine Worship is due to the second Person of this Coessentiall Trinity,
Divine Worship is due to Jesus Christ as God.
to Jesus Christ our Lord and God. There is but one immediate formal proper
Adaequate and Fundamental reason of Divine Worship or Adorability (as the
Schools speak) and that is the Sovereign Supreme singular Majesty, independent
and infinite excellency of the eternal Godhead. There is a peculiar and
singular esteem, Faith, Love, and Worship due to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
who are one God, the only true God. These three are the only Object of
Religion, and therefore the only Object of religious Adoration. There is but
one kind of Divine Worship, and that Worship and all degrees of it is due to
this one God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; this truth is made good against the
Papists as well as against the Socinians, and diverse others, whom I need not
name, the Ubiquitists and Arminians, by a clear stating of the point in
Controversy, and invincible demonstrations to confirm the Truth.

First, The rise of this Controversy.
For the clear stating of this Point we must look a little into the rise of
this Controversy, and consider how far it has been discussed by Learned men,
and stated by such as are Orthodoxe, and prudent men, since the Socinians,
Ubiquitists, and Arminians have endeavored to make the question more
perplexed, and the truth more obscure.

The Papists are deeply engaged to prove The Papists.
their distinctions are so well known that I need not to insist upon them.
Cultus latriae, duliae and hyperduliae precatio est directa vel indirecta.
Absoluta aut relativa; Suprema vel subalterna; transitoria velfinalis;
oblatoria aut extra oblationem. Card. Perron. in responso ad Regem M. Britan.
l. 5. c. 20. Smigl. de Monstris Arrianorum. c. 9. Vide sis Caje^anu^, Suarez.
Valent. in Thomam. part. 3. q. 25. art. 1. and 2.
Cardinal Perron exceeds them all for sophistical distinctions, which he who
is at leisure may read in his fifth Book, and twentieth Chapter of his Answer
to King James. But Smiglecius being engaged against the Socinians, states the
Point right; he distinguishes between Christ's Natural Power, as he is the
Natural and Coessentiall Son of God, and his Delegated Power which he has as
Mediator, and concludes that Christ is to be worshipped as he is the Natural
Son of God with Divine Worship, because his Natural Power is his Divine
Nature. But (says he) Christ is not to be worshipped in the second
consideration with Divine Worship. Doctor Rainolds in his Book de Idololatria
Romana has abundantly refuted all that the Papists bring to excuse their
Idolatry, and proves clearly, that It is Idolatry to give Religious honor to
any Creature; I shall not therefore trouble my Reader with any set-dispute upon
that Argument.

The Socinians tell us that The Father is the only Absolute Supreme Independent
God, but Christ is a Dependent and subordinate God: 2. The Socinians.
And therefore may be worshipped as he is Mediator with a Relative and
subordinate Worship, Vide ^rellium de uno Deo Patre sect. 1. sect. 36, 37.
which they are not afraid to call Divine Worship. But they confess that they
worship the Father only as the supreme Cause, the First Efficient, and the last
End: Socin. c. prae^. Wie. Volket. instit. l. 4. c. 11.
But they worship Christ as the second or middle Cause of our Salvation, and
the intermediate end of Religion. The ground and formal Reason of this
subordinate Worship is (as they conceive) Christ's mediatory Office, Socin. de
Adorat. Christi cum Christiano. Franken. and Fran. -- Dav. and Antithes.
Francisci -- Davidis, Ostorod. Instit. cap. 10.
the new subordinate Godhead, and Lordship over us bestowed upon him for his
obedience unto death, which they say, is the Mediate, as his Exaltation is the
Immediate Cause of this Subordinate glory.

The Arminians.
endeavor to excuse and gratify the Socinians; Remonst. Apolog. c. 2. and 16.
p. 153. Rhapsod. l. 1. c. 9.
for they deny that our grand Argument taken from the Divine Honor and Worship
of Christ, does sufficiently prove his Nature to be Divine, and Christ to be
one God with his Father. This Argument, say they, is not invincible, and
irrefragable, nay, they call it a leaden Argument, because this Divine Honor
is given to him by his Fathers gratification in time.

Vbiquitists
That the Divine Majesty, Worship, Glory, Omnipotence, Omnipresence of the Son
of God are communicated to Christ as man: but enough of that.

Orthodoxe, Judicious Doctors of the Church have given the Enemy too much
advantage by their unwary expressions in this Point: and the vigilant Enemy
has taken that advantage and made a very unhappy use of it, to the great
prejudice of Christianity. Vno absurdo dato mill sequuntur; Error parvus in
Principio fit magnus in Fine. I do therefore entreat the most accurate and nice
Reader at his best leisure to read Iunius, Chamier, Polanus, Polyander, Pareus,
Camero, Maccovius, Cluto, Beza, Heidan, Die, Zanchius, Voetius, Altingius,
and other sat Writers upon this Point, who have observed every turn, ward,
shift of the Enemy, and have given a very fair account of all.

For the present State of the Question be pleased seriously to consider these
plain and weighty conclusions following.

Divine excellency, infinite Majesty, and Perfection, is the Formal and
Adequate ground and reason of Divine Worship. Roman. 1. 21. ad 25. Lactant.
Instit. l. 1. c. 19. Si honos idem tribuitur aliis, ipse comnino non colitur,
cujus religio est illum esse unum ac solum Deum credere.
For by Divine Worship we do acknowledge and declare the Infinite Majesty,
Truth, Wisdom* Goodness and Glory of our blessed God. We do not esteem any
thing worthy of Divine Honor and Worship which has but a finite and created
glory; because Divine Honor is proper and peculiar to the only true God, who
will not give his glory to any other who is not God. God alone is the Adequate
Object of divine Faith, Hope, Love, and Worship; because these graces are all
exercised, and this worship performed in acknowledgement of his infinite
perfection, and independent excellency; Cyprian. ad Fortunat. de exhort. mart.
c. 2. Tertul. de Idol. c. 1. Idololatria Dei honorificentiam usurpat, and
vendicat creaturae. Ambros. in Epist. ad Ephesians. c. 5. Gr^g. Nyss Orat. in
laudem Bas. mag. Gr. Naz. Orat. in Christi Nativit. Aquin. in Epist. ad Ephesians.
cap. 5. lect. 3.
and therefore no such worship can be due to any thing below God: But the most
glorious and excellent Creatures are all below God, and therefore that point is
clear.

The same Divine worship is due to all three divine Persons.
as has been proved in the fourth Chapter of this Treatise; and therefore one
and the same worship is due to all three, because they are Coessentiall,
Coequall, Coeternall; they have one and the same divine nature, excellency,
perfection, and essential glory; and therefore the same acknowledgement is due
to all three both from men and Angels. There is not one kind of divine honor
due to the Father, and another to the Son, nor one degree of honor due to the
Father, and another to the Son; for there can be no degrees imaginable in one
and the same excellency, which is single because infinite; and what is infinite
does excel and transcend all degrees and bounds. And if there be no degrees in
the ground and Adaequate reason of Divine Worship, There are no degrees in the
Ground of Divine Worship. Joh. 10. 30 John 5. 23 Phil. 2. 6, 11.
there can be no ground or reason of a difference of degrees in the Worship it
self. The Father and Son are one, John 10. 30. one in Power, Excellency,
Nature; one God, and therefore are to be honored with the same Worship, John
5. 23. All men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father; every
tongue must confess that Jesus Christ who is man, is God also, and therefore
equal to his Father. And it can be no robbery, no derogation to the Fathers
honor for us to give equal honor to him, and his coequall Son, who subsists
in the form of God, in the nature of God, Phil. 2. 6, 11. You see the Divine
Nature, the infinite Excellency of Jesus Christ, is an undeniable ground of
this coequall honor, and therefore the Worship due to Christ as God, the same
God with his Father, is the very same Worship both for kind and degree which is
due to the Father.

3. This Divine Honor was due to Jesus Christ, before there was any creature
to give him his due. Christ was Adorabilitas est Attributum Dei absolut^^, sive
essentialis proprietas. Adoratio autem supponit aliquam creaturae actionem.
Deus sine Adorabilitate non est Deus, fuit autem Deus ab aeterno sine actuali
adoratione. Vide Zanchium ^b. 1. de incarnatione. Voetium qu. An Christus qua
mediator sit adorandus.
Adorable, Worshipable, that is worthy of Divine Worship before there was any
man or Angel to adore, to perform actual Worship, that Divine Worship which
was due to him for his infinite excellency from all eternity.

4. When Jesus Christ was declared to the world, God did command even the most
glorious Angels to worship him, as his natural and coessentiall Son, who was
begotten from the days of eternity in the unity of the Godhead. For when he
brought in his first-begotten, and only begotten Son into the world, he said,
And let all the Angels of God worship him, Heb. 1. 6.

5. If man had never fallen, never stood in any need of Christ's blood, yet all
men would have worshipped the natural and coessentiall Son of God, as one and
the same God with his Father, and therefore with the same Divine Worship* as
soon as his Godhead had been sufficiently revealed to them from heaven, or else
that very neglect would have been their fall and ruin.

The difference be^ween the Motives to and Formal Reason of Divine worship.
by his active and passive obedience, and glorious benefits which we receive
thereby, are excellent motives to excite us to give that Divine Worship to
Jesus Christ, which is due unto him for his own infinite excellency; but his
infinite excellency, is the Formal, Proper and Adaequate Ground, Reason and
Cause of all the Divine Worship which we perform to Jesus Christ, and that for
these reasons.



as Christ is, Unicum tantum est Religionis and religiosae Adorationis
objectum, unus nempe verus Deus, Pater Filius and Spiritus Sanct. Vide Molin.
in novitate Papis. Riv. Dec. ad pri. Praecept.
and that Office which is not common to all three Persons cannot be the Prime,
Immediate, Proper, Formal cause, Ground or Reason of that Divine Honor and
worship which is due to all three as one God blessed for ever; nay no Office
whatsoever can be the proper cause of Divine Honor.

Omnis Ratio Formalis in Objecto natura prior est omni action in objectum
illud tendente: passio Christi autem posterior est Adorabilitate, imo and ipsa
adoratione filii Dei.
before his Incarnation, Passion, etc. and therefore this Divine Honor is not
bestowed upon him as a reward of his Active or Passive obedience; for no
worship or thing can be before its Formal Cause.

4. Because Jesus Christ is a Mediator according to both Natures, and
therefore according to his humane nature as well as his Divine Nature; but all
the honor due to Christ according to his Divine Nature was due from all
eternity, and there is no Divine Honor due to him for and by reason of his
humane nature, or any perfection which does truly and properly belong to Christ
as man. He who was borne of Mary, is to be adored with Divine worship, but not
for that reason, because he was borne of Mary, but because he is God, the
Coessentiall and Eternal Son of God; We must distinguish between the Material
and Formal Object of worship. Maturam humanam assumpsit persona divina, and
divinae suae naturae univit; manet itaque unica Christi persona duabus constans
naturis. Totam Christi personam itaque adoramus, non totum Personae; natura
enim assumpta est creatura: totum Personae duas Christi naturas significat.


1. The Material Object of worship is Christ, who is both God and man, the Son
of David, the Son of Mary, the Son of God, the Mediator and Savior of his
people from their sins.

2. The Formal Object discovers to us the Prime Formal Adequate ground and
reason of his Divine worship; Vide C^ DD. Prof. Leidens^^ Censura Confess.
Remonstr. cap. 16. In adoratione objectum Formale and causa propria seu
Terminus (ut Scholae loquu^tur) est divina tantum natura quae hujus cultus per

de recta fide lib. 1.
the Coessentiall and Eternal Son of God, who is one and the same God with the
Father and the holy Spirit, he is worshipped for his infinite and Divine
excellency. Christ is worshipped as God with this Divine worship; his Mediatory
Office, servile suffering, cannot be the Prime and Immediate Foundation, the
ultimate and terminating object of divine worship due to the Father Son and
holy Ghost; and therefore we must conclude that the Formal and Proper reason of
the Divine worship due and given to Jesus Christ our Mediator, is the divine
nature and infinite excellency of our Mediator, which alone is of it self and
for it self capable of Divine worship. I should make a tedious digression if I
should declare what great Cyrill of Alexandria, Noble Athanasius, the Ephesine
Council of old, and very learned and accurate Writers of late have delivered
upon this Argument with great dexterity and circumspection. They would not be
mistaken as if they did divide the two natures of Christ, or remove any
glorious adjuncts from the Eternal Word, the second Person of the Godhead; and
yet desire you to put a difference between that which Christ assumed by the
most free Decree of God, and grace of Hypostaticall union, And that which
belongs to him as he is one God with the Father and the Holy Ghost.

Finally, they entreat you to put a difference between the Gracious Motives to
worship Christ, and the Prime, Formal, Adequate Proper ground and reason of
that worship, as I have done, and profess that they worship their whole
Mediator with one entire worship which is not mixed but purely Divine, and
therefore is not founded upon any Temporary Office, Service, Benefit, nor any
external denomination or relation, but upon his infinite Excellency, his
Eternal Godhead.

And if these considerations will not give men satisfaction, Zan. de. 3.
Elohim. l. 3. cap. 12.
I hope to satisfy them farther yet before I conclude this Chapter. For the
point is to me very clear and plain. If Jesus Christ were worshipped as
mediator, so that his mediatory office or actual mediation should be laid as
the first foundation, The fourth Argument empr^ved and enforced
or assigned as the formal reason of our worship, then this fourth argument,
which I am still improving and enforcing for the proof of the point will
plainly discover that the Mediation of Christ having respect to the humane
nature, will make the humane nature at least in part the ground, reason and
cause of this divine worship, which I leave to all sober Divines to consider,
before they admit. And it is farther to be considered that Jesus Christ as
Mediator does condesend to an office and employment which does subject him to
God as an Head: Vide Chamier. Panstrat. Tom. 2. lib. 1. c. 4 Junius Defens. 2.
de S. Trinitate Sect. 7. page 88, 89 Christus est aequalis Patri secundu ^n
Deitatem personamque divinam, Christus ut (...) lecundum voluntariam gratiae
dispensationem Pa^ri subjectus est -- and page 100. propter certas causas se
ul^ro demiserit salvo naturali jure ut Dispensative inferius regnum procuret
per gr^tiam.
The Head of Christ is God, 1 Cor. 11. 3. And hence it is, that he is called
the Servant of God, in respect of that service which he was to perform as
Mediator, Isa. 42. 1. 2. 3. 4. Nothing is more clear then that there are some
offices to be performed by Christ as a Mediator, which cannot be performed by
Christ as God, because they do import some subjection, as prayer unto God does,
though it is true that Christ being the natural Son of God does intercede
after an Authoritative manner. We may for the farther clearing of this point
resolve that grand question, what the meaning of that request is, when we say
Lord Jesus pray for me; the great doubt is whether this request be presented to
Christ as God, or as man.

The Answer is, Prayer directed unto Christ as God.
that if we look upon this Petition as a Duty performed by us, This duty of
Prayer is directed unto Jesus Christ as God; Vide D. Voetium de Adoratione
Christi pa. 5 36. Distingue ipsam Petitionem Formaliter ut est actus noster, a
repetita. Petitio dirigitur ad personam Mediato^is and ea terminatur in qua
Deitas habet se ut Ratio Formalis illius tendentiae seu motus cordis nostri in
Christum. Res Petita est actio Christi Mediatoris qua mediatoris, agenda sc.
secundum naturam human^m quae est Immediatum precationis subjectum.
for all Divine worship is due to God alone, as has been proved. But if we
look not upon the Duty of Prayer, but the matter of this Prayer: it is clear
that the business which we recommend to Christ is to be performed by him as man;
for it is proper to him as man to pray to the Father; yet because we desire him
to intercede in an Authoritative way to the Father, we do likewise request him
to intercede as it becomes the Natural and Coessensiall Son of God. And
therefore if we look upon the whole business of Intercession, we conclude that
he does intercede (...) as it becomes God-man; because he is our Mediator
according to both Natures, Divine and Humane. But then we must remember to
reserve what is proper and peculiar to each Nature, for though we grant that
there is a Communication of all properties belonging to both Natures unto the
Person of Christ, yet we must not attribute any thing to the humane nature
which is proper and peculiar to the divine; and it has been undeniably proved
that Divine worship is proper and peculiar to the Divine Nature.

relation and external denomination arising from thence cannot be the Prime,
Fundamental and Immediate Ground, Formal reason, or Adequate cause of Divine
worship; for if Christ had not been God, he could not have been capable of that
Office, because nothing could satisfy the justice of God but the blood of God;
and what ever arises from the free Decree of God, was not necessary in it
self; but sure I am, Divine worship must be founded upon what is Absolutely
necessary and Infinitely perfect; and therefore not upon external Relations or
Denominations, but upon the Godhead it self.

actually mediate as God-man.

to himself, his Father and holy Spirit as to one God blessed for ever, in
whom all our blessedness does consist; and therefore our Faith does not rest
Simply and Finally in Christ as he is our Mediator God and man, but as he is
one God with the Father and the holy Spirit. For by the Ministry and Mediation
of Christ as God-man, we are brought to believe in God, tht our faith and hope
might be in God, 1 Pet. 1. 21. Christ is God by Nature, he is Mediator by
Institution, Christus est Deus Natura, Mediator aute^ instituto O eco nomico,
and dispensatione voluntaria. Nemo igitur Deum Patrem adit si^e mediatore: ac
ne Christum quidem, cum idem sit Mediator and Deus. Junius de S. Trinitate
Defens. 2. page 114. D. Voet. De Adoratione Christi page 5 29. Christus non est

ubique cap 31.
by a voluntary and gracious dispensation unto which he did condescend for our
salvation. And upon this account learned Iunius told the subtle Samosatenian,
That Jesus Christ as Mediator brings us to himself as God. And Doctor Voetius
says that Christ as Mediator is an Inferior cause, in whose Name, and by
whose Mediaation we make toward God our chiefest good, in whom we believe, and
whom we do worship and adore as the first cause and last end, John 14. 6. And
Christ is said to save them to the uttermost by his Intercession who come unto
God by him, Heb. 7. 25.

We worship Christ and pray unto him, says judicious Pareus, as one God with
the Father and the Spirit the only true God; and this worship is Absolute and
Divine; for it is the Absolute worship of the Godhead. But then we call upon
God in the name of Christ, because he is our Mediator, and we desire for to be
heard for the satisfaction and intercession of that Person who is God-man.

But the Socinians conclude that if Christ be not to be worshipped with Divine
Honor as Mediator, then there is only a Subordinate Honor and worship due
unto him.

To which we answer, that Christ may be considered four manner of ways.

1. According to his Godhead and Divine Person; Christ considered four manner
of ways 1. As God. The Essential infinite Glory of Christ.
and it has been proved at large in this treatise, that there is Divine
Honor due unto the Godhead and Divine Person of Jesus Christ; and this is his
Essential infinite glory,

2. Christ may be considered as Mediator according to both natures, as God-man
(by a gracious condescension and personal union) Mediatory glory due unto him,
As Mediator.
which is more illustrious in regard of its manifestation since the alteration
of his condition from a state of Humiliation to a state of exaltation;
Proprietates utriusque naturae toti Personae in concreto vere competunt. Filius
hominis, qui est persona duabus constans naturis est omnipraes^ns, aeternus,
adorabilis, adorandus, nempe secundum naturam divinam cujus haec sunt idiomata.
Adoramus Deitatem Incarnatam, ipsa autem Deitas est proprium and Absolutum
divinae Adorationis Objectum.
this glory does outshine all the glory of Saints and Angels in Heaven, but it
is different from that Natural and Essential glory which is common to Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, as one God. For, that essential glory cannot be
Communicated to the Humane nature, no not since its Assumption, and Christ's
exaltation. Christus regnat secundum naturam divinam Principaliter, secundum
Humanam Instrumentaliter, secundum personam denique Absolutissime in natura
utraque qdsuum opus est consummantem. Iunius de Trinitate.


This Mediatory Honor is very glorious, because Christ sits as a King at the
right hand of the Majesty on high, and every one must confess that our Royal
Mediator is not only man but God also; yet we must acknowledge that since the
exaltation of our King, the glory of his divine nature, his essential glory, is
only more manifested whereas it was eclipsed before in the state of Humiliation;
and the humane nature assumed is only more perfected and not transubstantiated
into the divine. The Humane nature is still a creature, though it has gained as
much glory as it is capable of by the Grace of personal union, and glory of
exaltation; and being a creature cannot be capable of divine and infinite
perfection, which is the Formal object of divine Adoration; Humanitati Christi
nec per (...), nec per (...) communicata sunt Idiomata divina, quia Idiomata
divi^^ sunt ipsissima Deitas; humanitas autem Christi non fit Deitas Christi
nec per gratiam unionis, nec per gloriam exal^^tionis. Humana enim natura
charismata accepit gloriosa, non Idiomata divina. Vide Wendilin. Christian.

^olan. Syntag. lib. 2. cap. 31. Agit Christus secundum Humanitatem ut
instrumentum assumptum in unitatem Personae. Iunius de Trinitate.
even as the divine nature of our Mediator notwithstanding the personal union,
is not capable of any humane imperfection; For there is a preservation and
distinction of the two natures, notwithstanding their intimate and inseparable
union in one person. The natures are united, (...) as the Greek Church of old.

The actions performed by our Royal Mediator, flow from a double principle in
this single person, because this person does consist of two natures, and each
nature performs its proper work; the divine nature does what is divine, and
the humane nature what is humane; and therefore though the person be but one,
and the effect one, yet there are two different actions of two different
natures united in one person for producing of one and the same glorious effect,
and we are to give to each nature what is properly due unto it. Finally the
Kingdom which is administered by our Royal Mediator God-man, in a glorious way
is but a dispensatory kingdom, not his natural kingdom, an inferior and
temporary kingdom, not his Sovereign essential eternal kingdom; Omnia
inquit Paulus Ecclesiam compellans, vestri sunt, nimirum ut corporis, vos autem
Christi ut capitis, Christus vero Dei ut Patris qui misit ipsum, etc. -- Una
est Essentia, Majestas and gloria Dei Patris and Christi secundum Christi
Deitatem, personamque divinam; Pater tamen Christ caput est secundum
dispensationem gratiae and naturae humana in Christo veritatem. Vide Junium de

nunquam traditurus esset, nunquam Regni Naturalis u^sum Plenu^ esset
recepturus. Iunius ubi supra segmento 12. p. 100*
and therefore even in the very Administration of it our Mediator God-man, is
in respect of order, and that gracious dispensation unto which he condescended
for our Salvation, employed in a kind of Subordinate way; and when he has
accomplished that work for which he undertook this Royal office, he will
refigne this Dispensatory kingdom, and become subject (as man, and as head of
that body which he has purchased) to his Father, himself, and the Holy Spirit,
as one God blessed for ever, that God may be all in all, 1 Cor. 15. 28. For as
we are Christ's, so Christ is Gods, 1 Cor. 3. 23. in that safe sense and
subordinate way which we have but even now declared, that the Divinity of
Christ (which humbled, and as it were emptyed itself in the Administration of
this subordinate, temporary and dispensatory kingdom, yet with the
preservation of its natural and eternal Right) may be more gloriously
manifested by the full possession, use, and enjoyment of that natural, divine,
eternal kingdom, which does belong to Father, Son and Holy Ghost. For all
three Co-essential and coequal persons reign with the same power, Judicium
respectu vario commune est Sanctae Trinitatis and Christi singular. Commune
respectu communis principij agentis, Patris, Filij and Spiritus Sancti;
singular autem respectu Christi; 1. Respectu Principalis termini secundum
naturam divinam illius. 2. Respectu naturae humanae ut Instrumenti adunati in
unitatem Personae (ut ita dicam) singularissimum. Iun. de Trinitate, page 98,

scilicet operante quod verbi est, and carne exequente quod carnis est. Leo.

humana quod humanum est. Wendelinus.
Majesty, and glory in the unity of the divine Essence and common acts, in all,
and over all, infinitely and immutably from everlasting, to everlasting;
although the natural reign of Jesus Christ will not be so fully and gloriously
manifested until he has resigned his dispensatory kingdom, and brought all
his Elect, notwithstanding all their wants, sins, infirmities, temptations,
trials, enemies, safe to Heaven. This dispensatory kingdom is administered
principally by the Godhead, Instrumentally by the manhood, Absolutely and
perfectly by the person of Christ acting in a divine way as God, and humane way
as man, that the properties of each nature may be reserved as peculiar to each,
even whilst he does mediate, reign and judge, according to both; and
therefore divine honor is still reserved as proper and peculiar to the divine
nature of our Mediator, who is God-man in one person. This definite and
dispensatory kingdom is changeable, terminable; it did begin with the first
foundation, and will end with the perfection of the Church of God. Christ was a
Mediator from all eternity in the Ephesians. 1. 5. 6
Decree of God* He was actually given to be a Mediator as soon as Genesis 3. 15
Rev. 13* 8.
necessity required, he was manifested in the flesh in the Gal. 4. 4, 5
fullness of time, and will 1 Cor. 15. 28, 1 Cor. 15. 25.
cease to be a King in this Mediatory and Dispensatory Kingdom when he has
finished his work, and saved his Church. (...) est Apote lesma Personale
Mediatoris Mat. 28. 18, 19. collat. cum Marc. 16. 15* 16. and est potestas
subordinata Act. 2. 36. 1 Cor. 15. 25, 27. Act. 5. 31. (...) Sive Omnipotentia

auctoritate, tamen filius minor non est cui unum cum Patre esse donatut.
Hilarious lib 9. de Trinitate, Pater Filio tantum donat esse, quantus ipse est.
Idem.
Now nothing is more clear then this, that Christ is now subject to his Father
in all respects, in which he shall be declared to be subject when he gives up
his Dispensatory Kingdom; and we are not to worship Jesus Christ with divine
Worship as he is subject to his Father, but as he is equal to his Father, as
he is indeed one God with his Father and the holy Ghost.

Christ may be considered as Head of that Body unto which he has united
himself, Christ considered as Head of the church.
and which he has purchased with his dearest blood; and so we know Christ the
Head, and his body the Church make up one Christ mystical. Christ mystical.
The glory of Christ as an Head is exceeding great, and is excellently
described, Ephesians. 1. 20, 21, 22, 23. Christ is set at Gods own right hand in
heavenly places far above all principality, Quoties Christi nomen inter
argumentandum producitur duplex fallacia cavenda est. 1. Vna utrum de Persona
Christi agatur in se an vero in mysterio.
power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named not only in this
world, but also in that which is to come. And has put all things under his
feet* and gave him to bethe head over all things to the Church, which is his
body, the fullness of him that fills all in all. Now Christ mystical the Head
and body, whole Christ mystical is to be subjected to God, when the Mediatory
and Dispensatory Kingdom is resigned; and therefore if you take Christ ^s the
Apostle does, 1 Cor. 12. 12. for the Head and body, for Christ mystical, we
say that Head and Members are to be subject to Father, 2. Altera si de Persona
Christi agatur inse, utrum secundum totum Personae, an vero secundum hanc aut
illam naturam. Jun. de Trinitate page 101. Vide D. Alting. Loc. com. part. 2.

Christ considered as man.
and we are bold to say that there is an eminent and transcendent glory
vouchsafed to the Humane Nature of Christ by the grace of Personal union, The
habitual and Dispensative glory of the humane nature of Christ.
and the glory of its Exaltation. The glory of Christ's divine Nature was more
manifested, but the humane Nature of Christ was fully perfected by his
Exaltation; and therefore the humane Nature was exalted in a peculiar sense.
Vide D. Alting. loc. com. part. 2 de communicatione proprietatum, nec non
Wendelinum. Nec honorem a nobis Deus nisi per Deum accipit, etc. Hilarious de
Trinitate. l. 5
No nature not the nature, of the most glorious Angel, was ever so highly
preferred in these two respects.

1. In respect of Personal union with the Godhead, Christus humanitatem non a
natura habuit ab aeterno quia Filius Dei est, sed ex voluntate assumpsit ad
dispensationem salutis nostrae; atque haec humanitas non in se proprie gloriam
divinam habet, sed* in persona ex unionis gratia: in se vero divinae proximam
ex habituali gratia, Angelorumque gloriam longissime superantem. Gloria itaque
humanitatis est habitualis and dispensativa per personalis unionis gratiam.
Vide Iunium de S. Trinitate Defens. 2. page 69, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102.
Acts 2, 36.

2. In respect of Royal mediation between God and Man; none but Christ the Son
of Mary was ever so highly honored as to be taken into the Society, and
fellowship of the Mediatory Office with the Son of God. For there is but one
Mediator between God and Men, the Man Christ Jesus. 1 Timothy 2. 5. who is God as
well as man. Nec honorem a nobis Deus nisi per Deum accipit.

But it is most evident that the humane Nature remains a creature still even
after its Assumption, and Exaltation, and therefore we hold fast our first
conclusion; That the divine and infinite excellency of the Coessentiall Son of
God is the prime and fundamental ground, the formal reason and cause of that
divine Worship which is due to our Mediator Jesus Christ; Christus est
servator confirente Socino.
Jesus Christ our only Savior by Doctrine, merit and efficacy, by confirmation
and Communication. True it is, that the Majesty of God considered in it self is
terrible, 1. Annunciatione quia est Propheta.
it is a light not to be approached unto, and therefore the Word was made man,
that we might have encouragement to come unto God, 2. Confirmatione vitae
inculpa^ae exemplo, miraculis, passione, nec non resurrectione.
not only by the mediation of a man full of grace and truth, but by the
mediation of him who is God blessed for ever: because a mere man, though free
from corruption, and filled with Grace could not by reason of such natural
infirmities as are not sinful, perform the Office of a Foundation, Head, and
Spouse in upholding, 3. Communicatio^e, quia credentibus pro data sibi
potestate vitam aeternam communicate. Nos autem, ulterius agnoscimus Christum

1. 10. Heb. 9. 14. 15.

That Jesus Christ and the holy Spirit are one and the same eternal God with
the Father, has been proved at large in this Treatise, and therefore divine
Honor and Worship is due to Christ and the Holy Spirit as well as to the
Father himself, because all three are Co-essentiall, Co-equall, and Co-eternall.

When the seven Electours of the Empire met at Franckford about the election of
Maximilian the second, Vide Hist. de Maxim. 2. in Romans Regem. Elect. hist.
Simonii Schardi. Tom. 3.
some of them being strict Protestants went out of the place of Worship when
the Mass began, because they would not be present at that Idolatrous service,
but came in again when they sang Come holy Ghost eternal God. We being then
convinced by clear Scriptures that Christ and the holy Spirit are one and the
same God with the Father, we must glorify all three Persons as one God blessed
for ever.

1. We must not do any divine service to them who are not Gods by nature. The
object of divine worship. Gal. 4. 8. 1 These. 1. 9, 10. Acts 5. 59. 2 Cor. 13.
14. Mat. 28. 19.
Gal. 4. 8. But the three divine Persons have the selfsame divine nature, and
therefore the very same divine Worship and Service both for kind and degree is
due to all three Co-essentiall Persons. We must not conceive otherwise of God
then he has revealed himself in his Word: For then we shall not worship the
true God, but a mere fantastical Idol of our own brain. Ye worship ye know
not what says Christ of the Samaritans: Ioh. 4. 22. the Samaritans served
their own Gods, who were not Gods by nature, but false Gods. 2 Kings 17. 29. 33.

2. Nor must we give Father, The divine kind of Worship.
Son and Holy Spirit the only true God, any other kind of Worship then what is
prescribed in his Word. 2 Chro. 15. 3.
Israel is said to be without the true God when they were without the Law,
without a Priest to teach them how to Worship God according to his Law. 2 Chronicles. 15. 3. Now for a long season Israel has been without the true God, and
without a teaching Priest, and without Law. The divine kind of worship
prescribed both in Law and Gospel is spiritual Worship, Divine worship is
Spiritual Worship.
Mark. 12, 33. Heb. 12. 28. Psalm. 51. 6, 16. Deuteronomy. 6. 5. 1 Cor. 5. 8. 1 Chronicles,
28. 9. Phil. 3. 3. Ioh. 4. 23, 24.

3. The Worship of God is either Natural or instituted Worship. Instituted
worship has been changed.
The instituted Worship has been changed, for it was different before the Law,
under the Law, and under the Gospel. But the natural worship and service of
God is perpetual and eternal, it is to be continued in heaven, both by Saints
and Angels for evermore.

Natural Worship is due to Jesus Christ and the holy Spirit, Natural worship
is unchangedble.
because they have one and the self-same divine nature with God the Father.
Angels are called upon to give this Natural Worship to Jesus Christ. And let
all the Angels of God worship him. Heb. 1 6.

4. Instituted Worship is subservient, Instituted Worship is subservient unto
natural worship.
as I may so speak to this natural worship* for when we worship God with those
mean helps and actions which he himself has appointed and ordained, we must
worship him in spirit and truth. The benefit of divine institution*
All Ordinances of Christ are means of grace to beget knowledge, faith, hope,
love, self-denial, gratitude, humility, sincerity, reverence, zeal, and all
other graces in the soul, and to increase them in us, that we may exercise all
these graces upon every opportunity, and give God that Natural, Spiritual,
Divine Honor, which is due unto his singular Majesty, infinite excellency,
independent perfection, and eternal Godhead, in knowing, esteeming, admiring,
believing, loving, obeying God that our souls may be delighted and satisfied
with God as the chiefest good, as the Crown of all our joys, an All-sufficient
portion of our souls for evermore. This is the full scope of the first Table
of the Law, The scope of the Law and sum of the Gospel.
and this is the sum of the Gospel. If the first Table of the Law did
discover to us

1. The object of worship, 2. The means of worship, 3. The time of worship; and
did not also prescribe, require, enjoin 4. The manner of worship, we should be
at a loss; the Law would not be a perfect rule. Our worship would not be
agreeable to the nature and will of God; God would be defrauded of his natural
spiritual divine worship; and therefore when our Savior does deliver the full
scope of all the four first Commandments by reducing them to one Commandment,
The Scope of the four first Commandments.
he says, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, Mat. 22. 37. 38.
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, this is the first and great
Commandment, Deuteronomy. 6 4, 5.
Mat, 22. 37, 38. Deuteronomy. 6. 4, 5. This Spiritual worship is taught us in every
Commandment of the first Table, if we look upon the inside and spiritual
compass of those Commandments discovered to us by Moses, the Psalms,
Prophets, and the New Testament.
1. In the first Commandment we are spiritual worship also; The Spiritual
compass of the first commandment. Isa. 43. 10. Deuteronomy. 4. 39 Jer. 24. 7. Mic 7.
18. Ps 89. 6, 7. 2 Chronicles. 20. 20. Deuteronomy. 6. 5. Mat. 10 37 Romans 15. 30. Psalm. 2.
11. Revel. 5. 1 Thessalonians. 5 17. Psalm. 43. 4.
because we are required in mind, heart, will, affection and the effects of all
these to take the true God, Father, Son, and Holy* Ghost, God in Christ by the
assistance of the Spirit to be our God, to know, esteem, admire, trust, love,
reverence, adore, and serve him with hope, humility, self-denial, patience,
joy and thankefulness, zeal^ and constancy. This is the inside and spiritual
compass of the first Commandment.

or affections. The Papists will grant that we are by the use of Ordinances
(and as they dream Images also) to carry our hearts to God and Christ in
obedience to the second Commandment. Deu. 4. 15, 16, 17* 18. 23, 24.
The more learned Papists will confess that it is a sin against the first
Commandment to terminate our worship in any Image, Isa. 40. 17, 18, 25.
because no Image is Jehovah. Act. 17. 29
But they worship Images Relative (though not Terminative) as visible helps to
devotion to carry their hearts to God in worship; Q^am siguram ponetis ^i qui
Spiritus est. Hier. in Isa. c. 40.
and it is clear that the Jews and Heathens of old intended no more, Damas. de
Imag. l. 1. and 2.
and therefore there is as much to be said for Heathenish and Jewish as there
is for Romish Idolatry. Vide^ Dr. Rainold de Idololatria l. 2. Mr Shepherd in
his Treatise of the morality of the Sabhath. Mr. Balls larger Catechism.

ad Cor. Hom. 20. What is meant by Love and Hatred of God in the second
Commandment.
This then is the great sin of the Antichristian Worshippers at Rome (who
endeavor to defend this Relative worship of Images) that they conceive, that
the heart of man will be better carried to God and Christ by humane inventions
(such as Images, Crucifixes, Relics, etc.) then by divine Institutions; and
this sin is called an hatred of God in the second Commandment. And in the very
letter of this Commandment we are directed how to express our love to God,
namely, by seeking of him, and closing with him in his own Ordinances, and
institutions with an ingenuous contempt of humane inventions in divine worship,
and service; and though legal Ordinances are not only changeable, but actually
changed and abolished; yet there is something moral and unchangeable in this
second Commandment, which is attendance upon, and observance of the
Institutions and appointments of God. The immutable Law of the second
Commandment.
It is an immutable Law that we should give God that worship which is due unto
him, express our says in him, and love to him by a spiritual use of such
means and Ordinances as he himself should from time to time appoint. The due
acknowledgement of Gods immensity, and infinite Majesty in our attendance on
the Instituted means of worship is clearly opposed to the Image Worship in the
40th. Chapt of Isaiah, and first Chapter to the Romans; and therefore the
inside and compass of this second Commandment is spiritual, though the words
of it are so comprehensive as to take in ceremonial as well as Evangelicall
worship. For Reverend Divines have made it clear, that though the second
Commandment be moral in regard of its substance and general nature which
contains the immutable Law above mentioned, yet in regard of its particular
application to those significant Ceremonies, Sacrifices and Sacraments which
God did appoint, we say, Mr Shepherd of the morality of the Sabbath.
all Ceremonial Institutions are referred unto, and comprehended under the
second moral Commandment of God. See Mr. Shepherd in his excellent Treatise
of the morality of the Sabbath. page 24. 40, 41.

The third commandment.
Properties, Works, and Ordinances of God with Spiritual understanding and
affection, with faith, reverence, love, joy, sincerity and thankfulness in
thought, word, and life.

The fourth Commandment.
If then we find the Titles, Properties, Works of Jehovah given to Christ and
his holy Spirit in the Old and New Testament, we must conclude that Christ and
his holy Spirit are to be worshipped in the same Ordinances with the same
spiritual and divine worship, which is due to God the Father.

Christ and assistance of the Spirit, The Scope of the Law and Gospel.
that we may rest upon Christ for justification, walk and grow up in Christ in
the progress of our sanctification for our everlasting satisfaction. Two
dangerous Rocks.
Our business therefore is to avoid those two dangerous Rocks upon which so
many split and suffer shipwreck in this tempestuous age, namely the Rock of
neglecting duties in the course of our sanctification, and the Rock of resting
in Duties which overthrows our justification. Beware of neglecting duty, or
resting in duty.

and Gospell-Conversation, that he may come to be enriched with the
unsearchable riches of Christ, and filled with all the fullness of God. For this
Cause (says the Apostle, and well he might) I bow my knees unto the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ; mark the strain, it is purely Evangelicall: that he
would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with
might by his [Spirit] That [Christ] may dwell in your hearts: Here are all the
three co-essentiall Persons; but how may this be obtained? And to know the love
of Christ which passes knowledge: to know it in my heart, to believe it with
my heart, to feel it in my heart, because the love of God is shed abroad in my
heart by the holy Spirit. But what shall I gain by this? Why the Apostle goes
on; That ye may be filled with all the fullness of God. Ephesians. 3. 14, 16, 17,
19. The great design of the Apostle was to be found in Christ, having the
righteousness which is of God through the faith of Christ (without pleading his
own righteousness, which is of the Law) for his justification; And to have a
Spiritual and Practical knowledge of Christ grounded upon a deep and
affectionate experience of the virtue of Christ's Death, and Resurrection in his
own soul, Phil. 3. 9, 10. that he might be thereby encouraged and provoked to
press forward in the course of Sanctification, toward the mark for the prize of
the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, v. 14. that his faith might act in all
holy services. Justifying Faith is the Principle of Evangelical worship Rev. 1*

The hearts of true believers are golden vials full of odours and incense,
faith and love, sincerity and zeal, selfe-denyall and thankfulness, humility
and godly reverence: and the belief of their redemption by the blood of Christ
moves them to acknowledge the divine power of their Redeemer, The divine power
of our Redeemer is acknowledged by Saints and Angels
and to give him divine worship. The Angles, Elders, People all join, even ten

mystery of Godliness, the Art of living unto God; this is the Lesson which all
Members of the Church universal must learn; the four beasts (who join with
Angels and Presbyters in adoring the Lamb) are (as learned Mr. Mede, and diverse
others conceive) the Catholic Church of Christ in the four quarters of the
world professing and embracing the Doctrine of the four Evangelists; these
Beasts are full of eyes, full of the knowledge of the mysteries of Christ, and
their spiritual experimental knowledge moves them to worship Jesus Christ. Mr
Mede makes this Interpretation the Key to open very many Types in the book of
the Revelation, and doubts not but every one who does seriously perpend the old
Castrametation in the wilderness, and compare it with the Apocalypticall Types,
will subscribe to this Interpretation.

I know diverse learned men do conceive that the four Beasts are four Angels,
and some presume to name Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Vriel.
the Angels; but I cannnot embrace their opinion, because I find that the
Chorus is made up of Angels, Beasts and Elders; and these three sorts are
clearly distinguished, Rev. 5. 1^. And I beheld and I heard the voice of many
Angels round about the Throne, and the Beasts, and the Elders That the Angels
do join with the Beasts in worship is granted; That the Angels do protect these
Beasts with eyes in all quarters of the world, The four Beasts represent the
Church universal. Formae quatuor animalium diversae collectionem novae
Ecclesiae ex quatuor orbis plagis diversisque nationibus, populis, linguis
significant. Pareus in Com. in c. 4. Apocalyp.
East, West, North and South, is likewise granted. But that the Beasts are
Angels, that is it which is, and must be denied, and therefore I do conceive
that Mr. Mede is in the right, and the good man was sorry that he had not time
to clear that point at large; and therefore I am the more willing to proceed
upon this Argument, and perform that service to the Church, which he would have
done with more dexterity. Let us then consider,

1. That upon Christ's mediation his Father earth for his possession; The
Promise made to christ.
Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen, etc. Psalm. 2. 8.

Let us consider that promise made to the Church the mystical body of Christ,
Is. 43. The Promisemade to the Church universal.
Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art
mine; -- I am Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel thy Savior; -- Since
thou wast precious in my sight thou have been honorable, and I have loved
thee, -- fear not, for I am with thee; I will bring thy seed from the East, and
gather thee from the West. I will say to the North give up, and to the South
keep not back, bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the
earth, even every one that is called by my name. This is the substance of the
seven first verses of Isa. 43. Behold the Church universal gathered from all
parts of the world, into one mystical Body, that all may be united unto Christ
the Head by faith, and to one another by love, that so they may all join in
believing, adoring and obeying the Lord Jesus, his Father, and the Holy Spirit.

For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, The fulfilling of these
Promises.
whether we be Jews or Gentiles, bond or free, and have been all made to drink
into one Spirit, 1 Cor. 12. 13. Christ did grace the solemnity of his
triumphant ascension, with that choice gift of the ministry, for the edifying
and perfecting of Saints, till we [All] even all the members of the Church
universal, come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of
Christ, Ephesians. 4. 8, 11, 13. Christ mystical is deficient until the Saints are
gathered from all quarters into the unity of Faith, and knowledge of the Son of
God, because this is a fundamental point; for Christ built his Church upon
that Fundamental Confession, The foundation of the catholic church.
thou art Christ the Son of the living God, Mat. 16. 16, 18. and other
foundation can none lay, 1 Cor. 3. 11. And the superstruction must be agreeable
to the foundation, that we may attain unto the measure of the stature of the
fullness of Christ, every part making some considerable supply for the increase
of the body, by growing up in all things into Christ the Head, Ephesians. 4. 13, 15,
16. Christ is the only Head and Mediator, The coessentiall Trinunity
acknowledged by the catholic church in Gospel Worship.
and therefore Jews and Gentiles both have access through Christ by one
Spirit to the Father, Ephesians* 2. 18. Here Is an acknowledgement of the blessed
Trinunity made by the Catholic Church in Gospel Worship. And the Apostle
directs his Epistle to the Church of God at Corinth, with all that in every
place call upon the Name of Christ our Lord both theirs and ours, 1 Cor. 1. 2.
and concludes his second Epistle with The Grace, etc. 2 Cor. 13. 14.

Presbytero^um and Animalium positus est Templum aut Tabernaculum. Quid aliud

Presbyters and Saints full of eyes in the book of the Revelation. These four
beasts were in the midst of the Throne and round about the Throne, Revel. 4. 6.
The Form of the Throne is quadrangular, and one beast placed in the middle of
every one of the four sides. Mr. Mede shows how these four Beasts observe
what is done by God in the four quarters of the World; and how they speak in
order upon the opening of the four first seals, Rev. 6. and the 7 first
verses; and a voice proceeds from the midst of the four Beasts, Revel 6. 6.
Finally, the Virgin-church, Revel. 14. sings the same song that the four
Beasts did, which is called a New Song, sung in the praise of the Lamb and his
Father; And in some copies which are of credit, we read that the Virgins had
the Habentes nomen Agni. Primasius, Aretas, Andreas, Syrus Interpres, etc. Vide

Father on earth as the Angels do in Heaven; according to that request in the
Lambs Prayer, the Lords Prayer, Our Father which art in Heaven, let thy will

Gospel Worship from Christ and his Angels.

In a word, when the Redeemed Virgins and noble Conquerours come to sing their
triumphant Song, that Song does contain the Scope of the Law, The scope of the
Law and substance of the Gospel in the Book of the Revelation. The Testimony
of Jesus, and the Spirit.
and the substance of the Gospel; for they are to sing the Song of Moses, and
the Song of the Lamb. Rev. 15. 3. And they who sing are such as do keep the
Commandments of God, and the testimony of Jesus, Rev. 12. 17. And the
testimony of Jesus is the Testimony of the Spirit, delivered in the Word to the
Churches of Christ, Rev. 2. 7, 11. all three persons do deliver the same
testimony, Rev. 19. 10
1 Ioh. 5. 7. Rev. 11. 19.
but the Son and the Spirit do most eminently join in delivering their
testimony, Rev. 2. 11, 18, 29. Rev. 3. 1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 21, 22. Rev. 19. 10.

The Spirit does encourage them to believe his Testimony, and follow the Lamb:
and the Martyrs are slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony which
they held, Rev. 6. 9. and they overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
word of their testimony, Rev. 12. 11. The testimony of the Spirit, and the
testimony of Jesus, Rev. 12. 17. And when the Spirit has encouraged them to
love Christ better then their lives, The Martyrs are conquerors by the
Testimony of the Spirit and the blood of the Lamb.
Rev. 12. 11. and they have overcome by the testimony of the Spirit and the
blood of the Lamb, then the Spirit does pronounce them blessed. Blessed are the
dead which die in the Lord -- yea says the Spirit. Rev. 14. 13. The Virgin
Church is begotten, Wooed, persuaded, governed, upheld, comforted by the Spirit.
The Church is begotten, instructed, persuaded, governed, upheld, comforted by
the holy Spirit, as Babylon is the habitation of Devils, and the hold of every
foul spirit, Rev 18. 2. It is the Spirit which wooes the Church, and persuades
her to be the wife of the Lamb, and to make her self ready for the marriage.
And the Spirit and the Bride say come, Rev 22. 17. The Prophecy, blessing and
Communion of the Spirit.
And that we may look upon this whole Prophecy as coming from the Spirit as
well as the Lamb, the Angel assures us that the Testimony of Jesus is the
Spirit of Prophecy. Rev, 19. 10. The love of the Father, 2 Cor. 13 14.
and the grace of the Lord Jesus is communicated to us by the holy Spirit; Rev.
1. 4. 5. compared with Rev. 22. 21.
and therefore although the grace of the Lord Jesus is alone expressed in the
close of this Book of the Revelation, yet the love of the Father, and
Communion of the holy Spirit must needs be understood according to the Prayer
in the beginning of the Book. Rev. 1. 4, 5. Grace, etc.

3. The Spirit is worshipped in this Book Grace be to you and peace from the

brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; worship God. This is the testimony
of Jesus, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve,
Mat. 4. 10. The Book of the Revelation does contain diverse clear testimonies
against worshipping of Angels, I am of them (says the Angel) that keep the
saying of this Book; worship God. Rev. 22. 9. And therefore that place Rev. 1.
4. must needs be understood of the holy Spirit. For God will not give his glory
to another, Isa. 42. 8.
and good Angels will not take it from him, Why the holy Ghost is called seven
spirits.
but protest against this Will* worship, as Idolatry. The Holy Ghost is called
seven Spirits by an usual Metalepsis of the effect for the cause: he does pour
forth various gifts: seven is a note of Perfection, and the holy Spirit, one
and the same Spirit is given to all the seven Churches, Gratiam precatur septem
ecclesiis, quibus singulis unum eunde nqque spiritum sanctum quasi septem in
solidum tribuit.
every Church has so much of the holy Ghost as is necessary; and it runs as if
every one of the seven Churches had seven Spirits, because every one has
enough of the Spirit for their Sanctification and Salvation. The Apostle
therefore begging grace and peace from this Co-essentiall Trinunity, The
worship of the Coessentiall Trinunity.
the Father, the seven Spirits, and Jesus Christ, does sufficiently instruct us
in this mystery of Evangelicall Worship. Votum Gratiae and pacis univoce
concipit (...) D. Parei Com. in Apoc. c. 1. Deus Trinunus gratiae Pacisqque

Some object, that then the Spirit will be set before the Son; but the answer
is easy, that there is a Metathesis in the words; and it is observable that
the Son is sometimes named before the Father. 2 Cor. 13. 14. and sometimes the
Spirit is named before the Son, as Rev. 1. 4. 1 Pet. 1, 2. and sometimes the
natural order is observed, the Father is named first, the Son second, and the
Holy Ghost third; The natural order is not overthrown when the Father is named
after the Son, or the Spirit before the Son: Nor is the equality of Persons
overthrown when the natural order is observed; And therefore that objection is
not considerable.

Natural worship is due to the Holy Ghost because he has the same divine
nature with the Father and the Son. Natural worship is due to the Holy Ghost
the Creator of the New Creature.
That divine Faith is due to the Spirit has been proved at large. That divine
love is due to him is clear, Romans 15. 30. I beseech you for the Lord Jesus
Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit. The Spirit is the Author 1 Cor.

by the Communion of the Spirit we have Communion with the Father and Son in
Gospell-worship; we are the Temples not only of the Holy Ghost, but of the
Co-essentiall Trinunity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all three do dwell in
us, walk in us, All three co-essentiall Persons dwell in the Temple of the holy
Spirit.
and abide in us. For when we receive the Spirit of truth, he abides with us,
dwells in us, persuades and enables us to love God the Father, and the Lord
Jesus, and then all three Co-essentiall Persons make their abode with us, as is
clearly held forth to us. Ioh. 14. 16, 17, 23. 2 Cor. 6. 16, 18. 1 Cor. 3. 16.
Ephesians. 3. 16, 17. But if a man have not the Spirit of Christ he has no saving
interest as yet in Jesus Christ. Romans 8. 9. He who is not the Temple of the
Spirit is no Son of God, or member of Christ.
because he is not as yet the Son of God by Regeneration or Adoption, he is not
a member of Jesus Christ, he is not the Temple of the Holy Ghost: He does not
worship this Co-essentiall Trinunity as he ought to do in Spirit and in truth.
He who has the Spirit in him, does worship the Spirit in spirit and truth,
because the Spirit is the Power of the Highest, (even as Christ is the Son of
the Highest) a Personal Power, Luke 1. 32, 35. compared. The Spirit is the
spirit of Elohim, Genesis 1. 2. The Spirit of Iehova, Isa. 11. 2. The God of
Israel, 2 Samuel 23. 2, 3. The spirit of God, and the spirit which is God, 1 Cor.
2. 11. 12. Acts 5. 3, 4. This point has been sufficiently proved in the fourth
Chapter, and therefore I need say no more, considering that the Socinians have
no Arguments which are considerable, when compared with these plain places of
the Holy Scriptures, and those many places and proofs which have been formerly
produced in this Treatise.

If any desire to have their Arguments (such as they be) answered at large, he
may read Mr. Estwicks learned Treatise concerning the Godhead of the Holy
Ghost, lately published. I proceed to the third part of Godliness, The third
part of Evangelicall godliness.
which is Obedience.

3. Obedience is due to the Father, Son, Obedience is due to all three Persons.
because they are Co-essentiall, because they are one God blessed for ever.

Obedience is due to God the Father. This truth is generally acknowledged by
all that are not Atheists; Obedience is due to God the Father.
the Jews and Socinians subscribe to it. If we do acknowledge God the Father to
be the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our Father in him, the inference
will be immediate, clear and strong, that we ought to honor and obey our
heavenly Father. For how shall God put us among his Children, unless every one
of us say unto him, my Father, my Father, I do obey thee, and will not depart
from thee? But I said, how shall I put thee among the Children, and give thee a
pleasant Land, a goodly Heritage of the hosts of Nations? And I said, Thou
shall call me my Father, and shall not turn away from me. Jer. 3. 19. And when
God speaks to them as to Children, they presently submit: Return ye backsliding
children, And I will heal your backslidings; they presently reply, Behold, we
come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God, Ier. 3. 22. A Son honors his
Father -- if then I be a Father where is mine honor? Mal. 1. 6. Mal. 2. 16.
Mat. 12. 50. Mat. 23. 9.

When God is considered under this endearing relation of a Father, we yield* a
filial obedience unto God, Filial and Foederall Obedience.
we perform a foederall obedience, a sincere and Evangelicall obedience. 2
Cor. 7. 1.
I (says Jehovah) will be your God, Tit. 2. 14.
I will be your Father; Having these Promises (says the Apostle) let us
cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh, 1 John 4. 16, 19.

As we are to worship God in this Fatherly relation, Mat. 12. 50

Whosoever shall do the will of my Father, Hos. 3. 5.
etc. Mat. 12. 50.

That all three Co-essentiall Persons are our Father, Ezekiel. 16. 63.
has been proved already in this very Chapter, 1 John 4. 10.
page 326, 327. and that God the Father is our Father in a peculiar
consideration, page 328. and therefore I need not insist longer upon this
Point, since the Scriptures are clear, so clear that even very Cavillers
confess this truth. Christ himself as man obeyed the Father, John 4. 34.

and subdue our hearts unto the obedience of himself, as well as to the
obedience of the Father and the Lord Jesus. Act. 5. 3, 4, 32.


We are debtors to the Spirit: 1 Cor. 3. 16. 17.
We are his Creatures; The spirit of Elohim did form and fashion the rude
Mass, 2 Cor. 13. 14.
out of which all things were made, Genesis 1. 2. The renovation of all things by
continued propagation is ascribed to the Spirit; Rev. 1. 4.
Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, We are debtors to the spirit. The spirit is our
Creator.
they are created, and thou renewest the face of the earth. Psalm. 104. 30. Our
souls are breathed into us by this Spirit of life. Genesis 2. 7. Job 33. 4. The
Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty has given me life.
The spirit fits us for all services.
The soul is enabled and adorned with all abilities by the Spirit, that it may
be qualified for all manner of service. In respect of Counsel and Government,
Numb. 11. 25. In respect of resolution and action. Judge. 14. 6. But that which
is most endearing, The spirit of Regeneneration and Adoption.
is, that the Spirit is the Spirit of Conviction, Regeneration, Conversion,
Sanctification, Edification, and Consolation. 1. Pet. 1. 2. 2 These. 2. 13. Gal.
5. 22. 1 Cor. 12. 8, 9. The Spirit is the God of all comfort, it is his
special office to comfort mourners. The Spirit fitted the man Christ to be our
Mediator.
The Spirit fitted the man Christ to be our Mediator; as is most evident,
because

1. The Spirit formed the nature of man of the substance of the Virgin after an
extraordinary manner, Luke 1. 35. compared with Gal. 4. 4. for the service of
the Lord Christ.

2. He sanctified the humane Nature which Christ assumed after such a perfect
manner, that it was free from all sin in the very moment of conception, Luke 1.
35.

3. He united this pure humane nature with the divine in the same Person, the
Person of the Son of God, Luke 1. 35. compared with Heb. 10. 5. a body have
thou fitted unto me by the holy Ghost. christus est Messiah Messiarum Christus
Christorum. Joh. 20. 31.
Our Savior was anointed with the Spirit above measure, that he might be a
fit head and Mediator for us, that we and his whole Church might receive of
his fullness, graces answerable to his graces, Dona ista absolute^ and in se
finita fuere, sicut and ipsa Christi natura finita est; nostri tamen respectu,
sunt absque mensura. Vide D. Alting. exp. Catech. part. 2. and page 170, 171.
Ioh. 1. 16. Ioh. 3. 34. Ioh. 1. 14. Isa. 61. 1. Psalm. 45. 7. compared
together. Act. 10. 38. Luke 2. 40, 52. Mat. 3. 16, 17. Ioh. 7. 39.

If we consider how the Spirit has manifested his divine power in garnishing
heaven and earth, Job. 26. 13. in anointing Christ and Christians. 1 Ioh. 2.
27. in ordering and regulating Church-affaires, and enabling Ministers for all
Church Service, that the Elect might be gathered, converted, perefected, saved
by the efficacy of the Spirit in all Ministerial Dispensations, we shall see
reason enough to acknowledge the divine power of the Spirit, by all spiritual
and heavenly obedience. 1 Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13. Isa* 6. 1. 9. Act,
28, 25. compared.

If we harden our hearts against the Precepts and Exhortations of the spirit
speaking in the Word, Wilful disobedience to the spirit is a soul step
toward the unpardonable sin.
if we vex, grieve, resist and quench the Spirit, we are in a ready way to
that black and unpardonable sin of doing despite to the Spirit of grace; and
therefore unless we mean to proceed to total and final disobedience, it
highly concerns us to obey the holy Spirit, Sincere obediense to the effectual
call of the spirit is a good evidence of our Election.
and answer the many calls and motions of the Spirit by sincere obedience, that
our effectual Vocation may evidence our Election, and the Spirit may seal us
up unto the day of Redemption; for the same spirit is the Spirit of
Sanctification and Adoption, the spirit of Revelation, Mortification,
Vivification, Consolation. The Spirit quickens, moves, enables, enclines,
persuades us to believe in Christ, and to love one another, to keep all the
Commandments of God; Now this spirit of faith, Comfort for such as find the
spirit of Sanctification in them, though they do not feel or bear the spirit
of Adoption.
love, and obedience is the Spirit of Sanctification; and if you find the
spirit of sanctification in you, be of good comfort; though the spirit of
Adoption seem to withdraw, yet he is certainly present, nay, is not idle or
silent, he speaks by his real works, and sweet fruits; for the spirit of
Sanctification is the spirit of Adoption, it is one and the self-same spirit.
This is his Commandment, That we should believe on the Name of his Son Jesus
Christ, and love one another as he gave us Commandment. And he that keeps
his Commandments dwells in him, and he in him, and hereby we know that he
abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us, 1 Ioh. 3. 23, 24. And
hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of
his Spirit. 1 Ioh. 4. 13. And therefore if there be a spirit of faith, We
should rejoice in, and be thankful for our obedience to the Spirit.
love, and obedience in you, rejoice in it, lift up your heart to God in
thankfulness for it; God be thanked that ye (who were the servants of sin) have
obeyed from the heart that for me of Doctrine which was delivered unto you by
the holy spirit. Romans 6. 17. Be much in supplication and thanksgiving, and the
spirit of Supplication will be a spirit of Adoption, an oil of gladness; Heb.
1. 9. The spirit will teach you to cry Abba, Father, with comfort, Gal 4. Rom
8. The spirit will fill your souls with all joy, and peace in believing, and
in obeying; the joy of the spirit shall be your strength, the comforts of the
Almighty, Romans 14. 17.
even all the comforts of the Kingdom of God (which consists in righteousness,
and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost) shall be all-sufficient to revive and
support your dejected spirit. All your fears and discomforts shall be
dispelled, your wants supplied your wound, soars, infirmities healed, and you
at last filled with all the fullness of God. Mal. 4. 2. Ephesians. 3. 19.

Believe in the spirit, obey the spirit, and ye shall be sealed with the
spirit, Ephesians. 1, 13. I beseech you by the tender mercies of God, by the meekness
and gentleness of Christ, by the joy, and for the love of the Spirit, that you
consider what has been said, that ye receive this wholesome Word as it is in
truth the word of God, the word of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, but
testified after a more especial and immediate manner by the Holy Ghost that it
may work effectually in all you who believe it, The right manner of Obedience
to God.
1 These. 2. 13. Even unto spiritual and sincere obedience to Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost; and that it may be so, we must have a care to obey after the right
manner; for Amazia was too blame, though he did that which was right in it
self, because he did it not with a perfect heart. 2 Chronicles. 25. 2. Let us
imitate our Savior, who did all as he was commanded, Ioh. 14. 31. Let us have

1. High thoughts of the Majesty and greatness of God.

2. Sweet thoughts of the rich grace and infinite goodness of God.

3. An entire and an universal respect to all the commands, and every work of
God, Ioh. 6. 28, 29. Every work which God has given us to do, Ioh. 17. 4. and
ordained for us to walk in, Ephesians. 2. 10 For every command of God must have a
divine authority over our consciences and hearts. Psalm. 119. 6. and then Christ
will account us his friends, John 15, 14.

4. A more especial respect to the weightiest and greatest duties of Religion,
such as God has more especially enjoined: for instance,

1, The duties of inward worship and obedience, Mat, 22. 37, 38. the most
reserved and intimate duties of Religion.

2. Duties of judgment, mercy, and fidelity toward all men, Mat. 23. 23. Love
to our enemies, Mat. 5. 44. 45.

3. Duties of our particular callings and special relations, Psalm. 101. 2, 8.
public duties, and family duties, Zach. 12. 12, 13. 14.
especially such as are most private, Mat. 6. 6. Zach, 12. 12.

4. The great work of Faith which is the sum of both Testaments, Act. 26. 18
because all judicious and zealous love, Heb. 9. 14.
all sincere and 2 Pet. 1, 3, 4.
uniforme obedience springs from faith, John 6. 29. Ephesians. 3. 19.
This is the work of God; Joh. 6. 29.
and unbelief is the work of the Devil; Ephesians. 6. 16.
faith purifies our heart by applying the blood of Christ to our souls. Act.
15. 9.
Heb. 9. 14. 1 John 4. 16, 19.


The weighty matters of Law and Gospel may be referred to those four Heads
above mentioned; Magnes amoris amor.
observe that excellent Scripture: God has chosen the poor of this world
[rich in faith] and heirs of that kingdom which he has promised to them that
[love him] Iam. 2. 5. 1 Timothy 1. 5.
Faith and love will make us constant in the performance of all the other
weighty matters required of us both in Law and Gospel, James 2 5.
and we have proved at large that faith and love is due to all three Persons. 1 John 5. 3, 4.
We must perform all our duties

1. As to a Father, a divine Father, as has

2. In the name of Christ.

3. In the strength of the spirit.

4. At the command, and for the glory of 1 Cor. 8. 6.
for all things are of the Father, 1 Cor. 12. 6, 11.
by the Son, and through the spirit.

5. With a willing mind, a perfect heart, 1 Chro. 28. 9.
and faith unfeigned.

6. With all self-denial, 1 Timothy 1. 5.
diligence, constancy.

7. With an humble desire that we and Christ according to the tenor of the
Covenant of grace.

Let us now put all together again, and observe what a sweet harmony, The whole
mystery of the co-essentiall Trinunity reduced to Practice.
exact Symmetry, and glorious uniformity there is in this whole mystery of
Faith, this mystery of the Co-essentiall Trinunity as reduced to practice by
its effectual influence into the mystery and power of godliness.

Beloved Christians, I look upon my self as the least of Saints, and greatest
of Sinners, unworthy to be accounted a Member, but far more unworthy to be a
Minister of Jesus Christ, because I know more evil by my self then I know by
any member of Christ; but I thank God our Father, Christ Jesus our lord, and
the co-essentiall Spirit the same God, who works all in all, 1 Cor. 12. 6.
that I have obtained mercy, and ability of all three for to be faithful, The
Evangelicall Ministry.
and to be counted faithful by them all; for they have all three in some
measure enabled me, for that they counted me faithful, putting me into the
Ministry; for I am a Minister of that Gospel, which is revealed from heaven by
Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and I am a Minister accordidg to the gift of the
grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power; unto me I
say, who am less then the least of all Saints in this grace given, that I
should preach the love of the Father, the grace and unsearchable riches of
Christ, the sweet Communion, peace and joy of the holy Ghost, which is
unspeakable and full of glory.

Be pleased then to take a view of the whole mystery of faith and godliness,
and observe how this Co-essentiall Trinunity of Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
who are one God blessed for ever, is the adequate Object, Author, End of all
Religion.

1. Look upon the Grand Mystery of our Election unto Grace, Peace, and Glory,
The grand mystery of our Election by Father, Son, and Holy Ghost reduced to
Practice. Sicut ergo caetera praedicanda sunt, ut qui ea praedicat obedienter
audiatur: ita praedestinationem suo tempore and loco praedicandam esse, ut qui
obedienter haec audit, non in homine ac per hoc nec in seipso sed in Domino

believe, love, worship, obey Father, Son, and holy Ghost. Elect according to
the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit, unto
obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: grace unto you and peace
be multiplied. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, etc. 1
Pet. 1, 2, 3, 4. God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through
sanctification of the spirit, and belief of the Truth, whereunto he called you
by our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ -- Now our
Lord Jesus Christ himself and God even our Father, etc. 2 These. 2. 13, 14, 16
Here is the freewill of the Elect; but Blessed be the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
heavenly places in Christ according as he has, Ephesians. 1. 3, 4, 5, 13. ver.
chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and
unblameable before him in love, Col. 3. 12.
etc. Ephesians. 1. 3, 4, 5. Joh. 15. 16.
Our thankfulness should be shown for this free Grace* 2 Timothy 1. 9.
to all three Persons in our thanksgiving, believing, obeving, as is clear
from these places and so our prayers should be answerable to our faith, love,
and thankfulness* and therefore it is observable that in the very same Chapter
the Apostle makes his address after this model, That the God of our Lord
Jesus Christ the Father of glory may give unto you the Spirit of Wisdom, and
Revelation in the acknowledgement of Christ, Ephesians. 1. 17. and so 2 These. 2,
16. Rev. 1. 4, 5. 2 Cor. 13. 14. many other places may be urged which contain
the mystery of faith, worship, and obedience, and if Christ and his Spirit be
not always named in them, yet the benefits of Christ, the gifts, graces,
fruits, comforts of the spirit (which are named) do direct us to both.
Moreover, when the name of God is used Quoties Deinomen Indefinite ponitur, non
minus Filium and Spiritum, quam Patrem designat -- retineatur u^itas essentiae
and habeatur ratio ordinis. calvin instit. lib. 1. cap. 13. sect. 20. Joh. 14.
10. Joh. 15. 26. Joh. 10. 30. 1 John 5. 7.
indefinitely, all three Persons must be understood to be comprehended in that
essential Title, because they are one and the same God. Finally one Person
does subsist in another, and the same honor is due to all three, because all
three have the same divine Nature, which is single because infinite, and
therefore there is enough discovered to prevent all scruples in the
upright-hearted, and Cavils in the contrary-minded. Read the third and fourth
Chapters of the Epistle to the Colossians, and there you will see a very
pregnant proof of this point. Colos. 3. Pia sanctorum vigilantia non est ex
ipsorum arbitrio sed ex dono gratiae in ipsis per gratiae media exuscitato.
Colos. 4. (...). Coloss. 4. 12. Confitemur neminem immerito perdi, neminem
merito liberari. Prosp. The Epistle to the Ephesians. Fides est medium ad
salutem, and tamen ipsius electionis Effectus.
Put on therefore as the Elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies,
kindness, humbleness of mind -- above all these things put on charity; let the
peace of God rule in your hearts -- do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
giving thanks to God and the Father by him; What ever you do, do it heartily as
to the Lord. And then the sum of all their requests is, That they may stand
perfect and complete in all the will of God. This takes in the full scope of
Law and Gospel; whatever belongs to faith, worship, or obedience; whatever is
just, and equal, or well-pleasing unto God. Col. 3. 20. Col. 4. 1. And the
Epistle to the Ephesians runs parallel with this to the Colossians. Impius
sensus qui putat beatiorem esse hominem, cui Deus nihil dedecit, quam cui
universa^ in Christo per Spiritum Sanctum secun^um electionem ^ratuitam (...)
i^. (...) 11 5 7 Mat. 20. 16 Matthew. 24. 22, 24. electi sumus non meriti prae
rogativa, non fati necessi^are, non te^^ritate f^rtunae, sed alti^dine
divitiarum sapientiae and scientiae Dei quam non aperit sed clausam miratur
Apostolus. Aug. Prosper* Eulgentius.
Ye are elected and therefore ye must be holy before all three Coessentiall
Persons by whom ye were elected; ye must believe the Word of truth as the truth
is in Jesus, that ye may be sealed with the Spirit, and filled with all the
fullness of God; ye must bow your knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;
you must study the unity of Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God; ye
must keep the unity of the Spirit, ye must grow up into Christ in all things,
ye must not grieve the holy Spirit whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
Redemption, but maintain a fruitful fellowship with God in Christ by the
communion of the holy Ghost; for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
righteousness and truth; ye must be filled with the Spirit, giving thanks
always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ; ye must do whatsoever is right or equal, Ephesians. 6. 1. (...) this is
right, just, and equal. Put on the whole armor of God, take the sword of the
Spirit, the shield of Faith, pray always with all prayer and supplication in
the Spirit. Peace be to the Brethren, and love with faith from God the Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus
Christ in sincerity. I need make no inferences, the words are so plain, that
they prove the point in terminis terminantibus, as we use to say.

Consider the discourse of the Apostle in the Epistle to the Romans, The
Epistle to the Romans.
where the Apostle has even lost his reader in the depth of this Mystery of
the eternal counsel of Father Son and holy spirit; Amori Patris aeterno,
gratiaeque Spiritus singulari nobi^ in Christo destinatae totum Salutis
adscriptum videmus in Epistols ad Romanos: Contumeliam reddit justitia, honorem
donat indebitum gratia. Aug.
he puts this question to all the busy disputants, who has known the mind of
the Lord, or who has been his Counselor? and concludes that of him, and
through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever. Amen. We
have mercy from him, faith and repentance from him by an effectual vocation
according to his purpose of election. Romans 8, 28: 29. Romans 9. 11. 15. 16. 18,
23, 24, 29, 30. Romans 10. 20. Romans 11. 2, 5, 6, 7, 29, 30, 32. 36. We have
mercy, grace and glory from all three, and therefore all honor and glory be to
all three for ever Amen. And the Apostle does beseech the God of patience, and
consolation, the God of hope, and the God of peace, Epist. 105.
to fill them with all joy and peace in believing that they may abound in hope
through the power of the Holy Ghost, Epist. 59. de bono Persev. Ench. ad Laur.

in righteousness and peace, and joy in the Ephesians. 5. 9.

because fruits of our election by God. The Apostle writing to the Church of
the Thessalonians, which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ,
begs grace and peace for them from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ;
Quae sit liberae discretionis in concilio Dei causa supra facultatem humanae
cognitionis inquiritur and sine fidei diminutione nescitur, modo con fiteamur
neminem immerito perdi, nemine^ merito liberari.
remembers their work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope in our
Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father, and then concludes their
election of God because the Gospel came to them in power, and in the Holy
Ghost; for they received the Word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy
Ghost. The Apostle exhorts them in every thing to give thanks, because it is
the will of God in Christ Jesus, and bids them beware of quenching the Spirit;
and beseeches the Spirit, who is, undeniably, the God of Peace, and by special
office our Sanctifyer and Comfor^er, to sanctfy us wholly. The very God of
peace sanctify you wholly, etc.

And the Apostle discourses in like manner in the second Epistle to Timothy;

iniquity, be sanctified that he may be meet for the masters use, and prepared
unto every good work.

I instance in some dark expressions, on purpose to show that even in them
there is by interpretation an acknowledgment, August. Ep. 105.
That we are elected by Father, Son and Holy Ghost to Grace, Peace and Glory,
and therefore ought to admire, believe, worship, love, obey all three Persons
as one, and the same God, blessed for ever; we must be holy before them in
faith and love.

and therein our abominable sin, and the intolerable curse due unto it.

1. Our sin which we committed in Adam the first sin, it was a sin of cursed
atheism, divellish pride, unbelief, rebellion, apostasy, a sinning sin,
because it did disable, pollute, infect, poison both our souls and bodies with
original and damnable corruption; all sins against Father, Son and Holy Ghost
proceed from this root of bitterness.

2. The curse due to this sin is intolerable, unavoidable, it is the curse of
an Omniscient and Omnipotent God; a temporal, spiritual, eternal Curse, the
Curse of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Men and Angels cannot help us, we
cannot be pardoned, Redeemed, Sanctified, Adopted, Comforted, Saved, but by the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost; still this doctrine of the Coessentiall Trinunity,
must be preached and applied for our spiritual and eternal good, as will
appear by our following discourse.

much more every Sacrament-day should be a sealing day, a sanctifying day, an
edifying, saving Sabbath. God does upon such days take as wholly off from our
own business, Eheu nec fictis lachrymis dolendaest ista profanatio quae sub
praetextu Libertatis Christianae in diei Dominici celebratione^ tanquam torrens
irrupit.
that we might make it our only business to serve and enjoy God by maintaining
an holy Communion with God in Christ by the effectual working of the holy
Ghost for a whole day together, that we may in the close of the day attain the
end of our Sabbath-service which is a rest of complacency, sweet content, and
full satisfaction in the arms and bosom of a Father, a Savior, and a
Comforter; this, this is to enjoy a Christian Sabbath.

The heathens knew something of a Sabbath. Sabbathu^ inter omnes mortales
celebre. Vide Theophil. Antioch. lib. ad Attolycum. Joseph. lib. 2. adversus
Appion. Phil. Iud. lib. 2 de vita Moysis.


The Jewish Holy days were Appendices to the fourth Commandment, The Jewish
Holy days.
and therefore might be well taken off again, the moral Commandment remaining
entire. For it is granted, that they are taken off from the second
Commandment, and yet that remains entirely moral; and I believe it will be
clear to any man that studies the point that the Jewish holy days did belong
most properly, and directly to the second Commandment; Indirectly and but
Reductively to the fourth, because they were at most but Appendices to the
fourth Commandment: But even Jewish Holy days, and the most solemn services
upon them did in their Primary and Principal Institution, as Wallaeus himself
does acknowledge; point at Christ and his benefits; and the point is clear by
the Epistle to the Hebrews, and more especially by the ninth and tenth
Chapters of that Epistle, Heb. 9. 10, 11, 14. Heb. 10. 1, 4, 9, 10. Luke 4. 18,
19. 1 Cor. 5. 7. Vide Aug. Ep. 68. ad Casulanum. Chrysostom. Homil. 10. in cap.
2. Genesis Phil. Iudae. lib. 3. de vita Moysis. Theod. Trad quaest. in Genesis
The Sabbath was instituted before the Law was given on Mount Sinai, but the
fall of man defaced the whole work of the first Creation, and therefore it is
no wonder if Christ the Lord of the Sabbath require us to keep a Sabbath in
remembrance of the new Creation by the work of Redemption, which was actually
finished by the Resurrection of our blessed Lord upon the first day of the
week. For Christ entered into his Estate of Rest in the day of his Resurrection,
though he did not enter into his place of rest in the third Heavens till the
day of his Ascension, and the place is but accidental in respect of the State
of rest, and rest it self. The Will of our Lord was the instituting cause, the
Rest of our Lord the moving cause. When God rested from the work of Creation he
was refreshed, Exodus 31. 17. and when Christ rested from the work of Redemption
he was refreshed, and his Father took delight in the work of the new Creation,
which he could not take in the old Creation, See Master White of the morality
of the 4th. Commanment. Dr. Twisse, Mr. Cawdry, and Mr. Palmer, Mr. Shepherd,
Dr. Ames Medulla Theol. Dr. Lakes Theses.
which was so defaced, that he did repent of it, Genesis 6. but God will never
repent that he sent his Son to redeem, or his Spirit to sanctify his Elect,
but Father, Son, and Spirit will be refreshed and satisfied with all the sweet
fruits of this new Creation and Renovation by the death, resurrection, and
Spirit of the Lord Jesus. Mat. 17. 5. Ioh. 19. 30, Isa, 53, 10, 11. Romans 4. 25.
Romans 8. 33, 34. Romans 11. 29. Heb, 7. 21, 22.

The approved practice of the Primitive Christians declares the Doctrine of the
Apostles, The grounds of sanctifying the Lords day.
and the Doctrine of the Apostles shows what was the Command of Christ the Lord
of the Sabbath concerning the sanctification of the first day of the week,
which is therefore called the Lords day, and the Christian Sabbath.

The Jewish Sabbath was the Holy day or Sabbath of Jehovah as Creator, The
Jewish Sabbath. Isa. 58. 13. The Christian Sabbath.
and all three Co-essentiall persons did create us. The Christian Sabbath is
called the Lord's Day, since the Lord Christ has been declared to be the Son of
God by his resurrection, Romans 1. 4. and the Lord of all, Romans 14. 9. Mat. 28.
17, 18.

The Ministry and Sacraments under the new Testament are appointed by Christ,
The Evang^licall Ministry.
and therefore used by virtue of the second Commandment though the outward
worship be changed, and in like manner the Sabbath appointed by Christ must be
observed by virtue of the fourth Commandment though the day be changed,
because this is the general scope both of the second and fourth Commandments
that we ought to observe all the Institutions of God from time to time. The
scope of the second and fourth Commandments.
We are then obliged both by Law and Gospel to observe the Lords day, and we
may with confidence expect a blessing upon our observation of it; Rabbi Agnon
dicit hanc benedictionem transire super sanctificantes Sabbatum ante legem in
Sina datam. Cognitio and celebratio Dei Creatoris, and consideratio seria
operum Creationis ac Redemptionis ad Ceremonia^ referri nequeunt. D. Waelleus
de Sabbatho. page 583.
for he who sanctified the day did bless it also, that is, annexe a blessing
to the sanctification of it; Read Peter Martyr upon the second of Genesis, and
the fourth Commandment, when God rested from the works of Creation he
appointed a Sabbath, although he did not rest from works of Providence; and in
like manner Christ has appointed a Sabbath upon his resting from the work of
Redemption by price, although he does not rest from the work of Redemption by
Power till all his Enemies be vanquished and his Elect saved.

These grounds being laid it is most evident, How the Lords day is to be
sanctified unto Father Son and holy Ghost.
that we are to keep a spiritual rest to Father, Son, and holy Ghost upon the
Lords day. We are not only to draw near to the Ordinances, but to God, and
Christ in them by the power of the holy Spirit, because all spiritual
Communion with God in Christ is maintained by the power of holy Ghost. 2 Cor.
13, 14. And our Communion with God upon the Lords day ought to be more
immediate and eminent, How Christians do enjoy God upon the weekdays.
more spiritual and heavenly than at other times. Christians do enjoy God, not
only in his Creatures providence and works of their callings according to the
variety of their occasions, but also in acts of Immediate worship and service
even upon the week days; but we are to do God some more eminent service on the
Lords day, we should not content our selves with week-dayes-prayers, and
praises, our holiness and communion should be extraordinary upon this solemn
day,

1. Eminent for the degree of it; there should be a Sequestration of our minds
and hearts from the world, Eminent holiness and Communion, Read Mr. Shepherds
excellent Treatise upon this Subject in his fourth part of the sanctification
of the Sabbath.
and a consecration of them to the blessed Trinity in the highest degree, and
after the most immediate manner in all exercises of Religion with admiration,
confidence, love, reverence, delight, and thankfulness, that we may come as
near to God (who comes down on purpose to meet us in his Ordinances with a
full blessing) as it is possible for Creatures that are clothed with flesh. We
must abstain not only from servile works, but servile thoughts, cares,
affections; The Sacrifice was doubled on the Sabbath to show that our holiness
should be redoubled on that day, Number. 28. 9. The Sabbath was called holiness,
Exodus 31. 15. and the Holy of Jehovah, Isa. 58. 13. to show that we should be
exceeding Holy upon this Holy day. We should be transported beyond flesh and
the world, and have our conversation in heaven that day; for the day requires
some transcendent holiness.

Restorative; for we contract much soil, Restorative Communion
abate the vigor of our graces by converse with the world upon the week days,
and now there should be Restauratio deperditi: We should sadly review our
experiences, and failings all the week, and make up all our defects upon this
acceptable day, this season of Grace, when God sits in state, and scatters
treasures of grace amongst hungry, and thirsty Saints that are poor in Spirit,
and wait for spiritual Alms at a Throne of Grace.

3. Constant Communion; we should Constant Communion
as well as public all the whole day together; It is lawful for us on the week
days to go about our worldly occasions after we have been at prayer, but we
find that when we have been well warmed by Family duties, we are apt to catch
cold again presently, when Company or worldly businesses break in upon us, but
we must keep our hearts in a Sabbaths days frame all the Lords day, yea, and at
night also; when our bodies are wearied in service, we must not be weary of
Service, but our hearts must be panting and working after more of God, and
Christ, and the holy Spirit.

4. Soule-satiating Communion, we must Soule-satiating communion.
enjoyment of Christ, and walking in the Spirit all the day. We must enter into
the rest of our beloved, and take a sweet complacency in the fruition of God,
in the glimpse of his glory, in the taste of his love, in the kisses of his
mouth, in all the testimonies of his favor, in all the love tokens sent us from
heaven. The joy of the Lord must be our strength, and in this strength we must
go forth and mortify our corruptious, resist temptations, and go about our
worldly business all the next week with heavenly minds.

I cannot stand to speak directly and fully to the particular duties of the
Sabbath; Extraordinary duties
or extraordinary duties of Evangelical fasting, and Christian Feasting, for
all which there should be a serious preparation, in all which there must be a
prudent sequestration of our minds and hearts from the world, that theremay be
an entire consecration of them unto God, and a sincere sanctification of all
these times to Father, Son, and holy Ghost, as it becomes the Sons of God, the
Members of Christ, and Temples of the holy Ghost. We should get oil into our
vessels, dress and trim our Lamps, that we may meet the Bridegroom of our
souls in his appointed walks, in his own Ordinances and exercises. I should
say something likewise of our Penitential meltings before God; Penitential
meltings.
Thus in brief then, when our conscience has been wounded by the Spirit of
bondage, and is renewed by the Spirit of Regeneration, it will in due time be
pacified by the spirit of Adoption, but even then the soul will melt into
tears, nay, then it melts most kindly, and laments most affectionately; O I
have sinned against the tender mercies of the bowels of God; I have kicked my
Father upon the Bowels; I have made a sport and pastime of those sins, which
let out the heart blood of my dear Savior; I have grieved, vexed, and even
quenched the holy Spirit my sweetest Comforter; I have sinned against all
three, and so trebled all my sins; I fear I have (says the Soul in its
agony) even done despite to the Spirit of grace, and trampled on the blood of
the Son of God; but I have learnt to submit, and believe, to rejoice, and
tremble, to weep, and wait; for I wait upon a Father, upon him whom my soul
loves; the spirit of faith and love has taught me to come with a broken heart,
and a bleeding conscience to a Father, to a Savior, to a Comforter; I desire
to keep the wound open by renewed Confessions, and sprinkle the clensing blood
of Christ upon it by a lively faith. Oh it is sovereign blood, and must be
fiducially sprinkled by a special application; and it is the spirit which
makes this special application, and administers reviving Cordials to broken
hearts, and fainting souls in their swowning fits.

The sad condition of the most ingeneous sort of unreg^nerate men.
When the most Ingenuous and refined sort of unregenerate men come to see, that
notwithstanding all their Civility and Formality they are in the gall of
bitterness by reason of their impenitence and unbelief, their opposition to
the power of godliness, their undervaluing of the mercies of God, the love of
Christ, graces and comforts of the holy Spirit, and feel these sins set home
upon their hearts and consciences with stinging aggravations, they are even
fired out of their natural estate, and by the preventing grace of the Spirit
made sensible of sin, and hungry after grace and mercy. The dreadful
impressions of Gods infinite Majesty, and damning wrath make all the sensual
impressions of sin to be remembered with proportionable and self-condemning
horror. But when the most glorious treasures of Gods sweetest mercies, and
richest grace, folded up in his fatherly bowels, are opened to these ingenuous
men, and the Spirit has touched their hearts to lament after Christ; then this
ingenuous soul will cry out, Oh what restless agonies, what stinging worms,
what unquenchable floods of flaming brimstone, how many Hells are there
treasured up in one Hell for such a wretch as I am, who have undervalued the
riches of Gods mercy, the love and merits of Christ, the graces and comforts of
the Spirit; heaven and earth may be astonished, men and Angels amazed at my
prodigious madness in undervaluing Christ and Heaven: In the midst of this
agony and conflict, prudent astonishment, and spiritual horror, the holy
Spirit urges invincible Arguments which are sweetly compulsive to persuade and
constrain the soul to long for Christ. For when the Spirit has made the
threats both of Law and Gospel effectual to humble us, he fills the soul with
despair of mercy if it continue in its former estate, in the gall of
impenitence, and bond of unbelief, but withal it does assure the soul that
there is plenteous redemption, and eternal salvation treasured up in Christ
for penitent believers. Motives to Faith and true Repentance.
Then the spirit opens the mystery of free Grace contained in a Covenant sealed
with the Oath of God, and blood of Christ; he reveals the eternity,
excellency, sweetness, freeness, fullness, infiniteness of Gods mercy and grace,
Christ's love and merits as so many motives and encouragemets unto faith and
repentance. The Spirit sets a Pardon and a Crown before us, acquaints us with
the all-sufficient righteousness and unsearchable riches of Christ, and his own
free and effectual grace, unspeakable comforts, and glorious joys, and then
convinces us that we want this grace to sanctify us, this Pardon and
righteousness to justify us, this Crown, and these joys to enrich and
satisfy us. And upon this discovery the soul is encouraged to give credit to
the holy Ghost to believe the love of the Father to depend upon Christ's
satisfaction, and apply his righteousness, to prize the love of the Father, the
merit of Christ, the grace and comforts of the Spirit above a World; in a word,
to sell all for Christ, and give up all to Christ, resolving to be ruled by
himself and his spirit for evermore. Now the soul has a new life put into it,
it hungers and thirsts for a more intimate Communion with Father, Son, and holy
Ghost, and this hungry soul sucks whilst the breast is open till it has
filled it self with substantial nourishment and reviving Cordials. This devout
soul becomes (as Chrysostom styled Saint Paul) an insatiable worshipper of
Father, Son, and holy Ghost, it desires to grow in grace, to press on toward
perfection, to have Father, Son, and holy Ghost to come sup with it, dwell in
it, rule in it, that it may be enriched with the unsearchable riches of Christ,
and filled with all the fullness of God.

This converted soul does after these Penitential meltings, The great
difference between an ingenuous man and a gracious man.
Fiduciall breathings after Christ, and obedientall closing with Father, Son,
and holy Ghost, differ as much from it self (when it was most ingenuous before
its conversion) as an Angel does from a Devil. For the most ingenuous and
refined sort of unregenerate men have nothing in them, which is more excellent
then common grace, and common grace leaves them in the state of Nature under
the power of sin, and in the very suburbs of Hell wholly at the command of
Satan; and if any man think otherwise, let him take heed that very thought
does not nail him fast to that unregenerate and cursed estate for evermore.

Believe it Brethren, that Historical faith, and Natural wisdom do but
excite some pang of self-love, which makes us very solicitous how we may stop
the mouth of our convinced conscience with some kind of ingenuous Civilities,
and outward formalities without any penitent acknowledgment of our sinful and
cursed estate, any prudent esteem of Christ, whose blood, merit,
righteousness, and grace ought to be prized above a world. We never seek
Christ in earnest till he has first sought us, found us out, and brought us
home by his preventing, quickening, saving grace. And when Christ dwells
conquering and reigning in the soul, the soul is not content with civilities
and formalities with common grace, or some low degree of special grace, but it
aims at grace in perfection; the heart is kindly broken by Faith and Love, How
far an unregenerate man may be changed.
the soul is humble, thankful, zealous, merciful, diligent, constant in
serving Christ, and Christians upon all occasions. Civil and Formal men may
by legal terrors be brought to some kind of Devotion, they may by an
Historical says be brought to some kind of admiration of the Gospel, to many
good wishes and velleities, nay, to a Reformation in many particulars, but
because they undervalue the love of the Father, the grace of Christ, the
Communion of the Holy Ghost, and consequently the power of godliness,
notwithstanding all their terrors, wishes, admiration, reformation, and
hankerings after Christ and Heaven, they perish in their unbelief, because they
never had any hungry and thirsty desires, restless desires after Christ, (such
as would not be satisfied without him,) wrought in their souls by the light of
the Gospel, power of the Spirit, serious and seasonable offers of Christ. They
never come to a deliberate choice and thankful acceptance of Christ to be
their Savior, Husband, Priest, Prophet and King; but did indeed choose rather
to be Satan's bondslaves, then Christ's spouse, they would not make a prudent
exchange of Satan's fetters for Christ's yoke, and therefore are but dancing to
hell with their fetters, in the fairest path that they can possibly find to the
chambers of death; they could never be persuaded to be content with Christ
alone as their all-sufficient portion, and therefore refused to sell all for
him, and give up all to him, but did upon mature deliberation, and in cool
blood reject Christ, resist his Spirit, refuse a pardon of sin, and Deed of
Heaven, purchased and sealed with the Heart-blood of God; and this very
consideration will sting the conscience and torment the soul of these
everlasting Bedlams, when they lie in chains of darkness, cursing themselves to
all eternity, and blaspheming God for torturing of them in the angry flames of
hellish brimstone.

But that this mystery may be yet more freely discovered; take any man that is
not guilty of the black and unpardonable sin of trampling on the blood of
Christ, and doing despite to the Spirit of grace, and let him be one of the
most desperate villains that ever served the devil, and I dare encourage this
wretch, whom hell and Satan do even gape and groan for, to go to Christ for
preventing grace, that the Holy Spirit may set home the curses of the Law, and
the more severe threatenings of the Gospel, upon his obdurate heart in a saving
way, and beseech him to knock early at Heaven-gate, the sooner the better,
because God gives Christ and his Spirit, a Pardon and a Crown, as Fathers give
lands to their children, only because they will give them, he gives all Freely
and Royally. Christ has gifts for the rebellious also, God shows mercy and
gives grace to them that do deserve neither grace nor mercy. And if the spirit
do open the eyes and heart of this man, that the sense of his own devilish
bruitishnesse may move him to enquire after God and Christ, Prove. 30. 1, 2, 3.
and gives him present support from falling under the weight of his own sin, and
Gods curse into despair, after illumination, conviction, terrors, before he
come to hunger after Christ, submit to him, and close with him, as an
all-sufficient Savior, and an only Savior; The Conversion of notorious sinners.
This trembling soul may in the midst of cares, and hopes, and terrors, be
encouraged and enabled by a Spirit of Regeneration, with all humility, joy and
thankfulness to accept of Christ, and rest upon him for righteousness and
life, by a faith of Dependence, Adherence, Recumbence, and to submit and melt
with Evangelical repentance at a Throne of grace; and when his heart is thus
broken by faith and love, which do cast out unbelief, self-love and slavish
fear which tends to despair; this even now very black soul, but now purified
by the Spirit of Regeneration, and revived by the Spirit of Adoption,
sprinkling the blood of Christ upon his conscience, and shedding the love of
God abroad in his heart, will be encouraged to call God Father, and Christ
Savior; the Father will meet, embrace, adorn him, wipe off his tears and
filth, and kiss that prodigal mouth, which came from feeding with swine and
kissing of harlots; Christ will bid this soul welcome, it shall be thrice
welcome to this Co-essentiall Trinunity. The grea^est sinners are welcome to
Christ when they turn and submit to him.
For God who brought his pardoning mercy, preventing and effectual grace to us
when we looked not after him, will surely bid us welcome when we come unto him
with a prudent care, a lively faith, a Son-like reverence, a penitent
indignation against our sin and lusts, melting affections, and yearning bowels
toward him, and flaming zeal in his service, and for his cause. He who ran
and called after us when we looked not after him will not reject us when we
come unto him out of tender respect, and hearty love to him and his service; He
that has the Spirit, shall have Son, and Father also.

Let all churlish Nabals, proud Pharisees, politic Gallios, scoffing Ishmaels,
impenitent Formalists, No meritorious Praeparatives.
and unbeleeving Atheists consider what has been said, and look upon
themselves as guilty of eternal death, let them hear with wonder and
amazement, let them believe and tremble, and let all the enemies of the grace
of God, Pelagians, Papists, etc. know that all preparatives are wrought by the
Word and Spirit, and that it is one great preparative to abhor the thought of
all meritoriousness in all or any of those preparatives which make way for the
infusion of faith; for faith is the free gift of God, and though there be many
necessary preparatives to drive us to Christ, yet there are no meritorious
Qualifications in us to bribe God, allure Christ, or deserve grace. The Spirit
works when, where, and as he pleases, and he who does not prize the love of the
Father, the grace of Christ, and Communion of the Holy Ghost above a world is
not as yet acquainted with the mystery of Faith, or the Power of Godliness, he
has neither Father, Son, nor Spirit in him.

CHAP. X.
Christians who have a lively sense and sweet experience of this grand mystery
of Faith, and practical mystery of Godliness, are afraid to hold Communion
with such as pretend to be Spiritual Christians, and yet deny the divine
Nature and distinct subsistences of Christ and his holy Spirit.
IT is observed by a great States man, That he who follows Truth too near at
heels, may have his Teeth heat out; but I had rather lose my teeth than not
teach, and profess the truth. He who presses this point in this Licentious Age,
wherein Scepticks in the highest points are called Seekers, and Heretics good
Christians, had need beg the promise of the Father, Luke 24. 49 Magnitudo animi
ad praedicandum ^vangelium necessaria ex alto promittitur. D. A^ting.
that he may be endued with virtue from on high, that is, a magnanimous and
more then an Heroical spirit to preach the truth. We must not fear the face
of man in the cause of God; if the Devil might set up his Church in England,
wherein Heresy is instead of a Preacher, profaneness and ungodliness instead
of Ruling Elders, yet I must be bold to say, that these Seekers whom the
Reformers called Libertines, are as the Fathers called them, but Nullifidians,
and Atheists, professed Atheists; for They are Atheists, who will not believe
and adore the only true God, Father, Son, and holy Ghost; and such are the
Seekers whom I am to deal with; who deny the Lord Christ to be God; and I
shall easily discover that this is Atheism; An etiam Abnegatio Christi quae

whether reigning Atheism or no, let the Socinian Seekers and Deifyed Atheists
judge. Whosoever transgresses and abides not in the Doctrine of Christ [hath
not God;] he who abides in the Doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and
the Son. The second Epistle of John the ninth verse, Who is a liar but he that
denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist that denies the Father and
the Son. Whosoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father, 1 Ioh. 2. 22,
23, 24. He who has not the true God, Father, Son, and holy Ghost for his God,
is an Atheist; for if he do acknowledge a false God, a false God being no God,
it must still be granted that no man can be excused from Atheism by his
acknowledgment or worship of any thing that is not God; I speak of such
speculative Atheism as does commonly run into practical Atheism, and may
consequently end in direct and downright Atheism, or at least such affected
Atheism, as will permit that Radical and Seminall Atheism which was borne
with them to sit quietly in their hearts as on a Throne, so that they have no
actual belief of the true God which does amount to an historical belief;
much less any that can effectually overpower or dethrone their natural
Atheism. And yet I believe these Atheistical Libertines can never fully blot
out all the natural notions of a Godhead written in their hearts by the finger
of God, Vide John. Junium in Refutatione Praelect. Socini cap. 2. and D. Rivet.
in Psalm. 10.

for the devils themselves have not attained to any Atheistical (...) or (...);

the Devils believe and tremble; but enough of that; the Socinians are Atheists
Interpretative at the least.

It is not enough for Christian Communicants to attain to the first principle
of natural Theology, and confess that there is a God, but they must acknowledge
the first principle of Christianity, which is indeed Supernatural Divinity, and
acknowledge, that Father, Son, and holy Ghost are the only true God; for else
we go no farther then Pharaoh that grand Seeker did, when he asked, who is
Jehovah that I should obey his voice? Exo. 5. 2. or then the Samaritans and
Athenians did, who worshipped they knew not what. Ioh. 4. 22. Act. 17. 23. The
Turks, the Pagans, the Jews do acknowledge that there is a God; Vide Arist. de
coelo lib. 1. cap. 3. Aug. in Psalm. 44. Senec. Epist. 1. 7. Damas^. de Orth.
fid. lib. 1. c. 1. Ciceron. de natura Deorum.
unless then we do intend to hold Church Communion with Pagans, Jews,
Mahumetans, we must require somewhat more of those, whom we admit unto
Christian Communion than a bare acknowledgment that there is a God, or that the
Father is God. For he who does deny the Godhead of the Son, does deny the
Father also, and consequently has no God at all for his God, as has been
proved already from the ninth verse of the second Epistle of John, The Father
and his coequal Son are to be honored with equal honor.
and 1 John 2. 22, 23, 24. He that honors not the Son as highly as he
honors the Father, he does not honor the Father, who sent his co-equall Son
to give us life. Ioh. 5. 21, 23. We must acknowledge the Son to be equal to
the Father, for this redounds to the glory of God the Father. Christian
communion with the Father in his natural Son by their co-essential spirit.
Phi. 2. 6. 11. We can have no Christian and spiritual Communion with God the
Father but in his natural Son, and by their Coessential Spirit, as is manifest
by comparing these Texts together, 1 Ioh. 1. 3. 1 Cor. 1. 9. 2 Cor. 13. 14.
Rev. 1. 4, 5. Mat. 28. 19, 20. Ephesians. 2. 18, 22. 1 Cor. 12. 3, 6, 8, 11, 13.
and by the full scope of all my practical Discourse in the ninth Chapter of
this Treatise. This is life eternal, etc. John 1 7 3. 1 John 5. 6, 7, 11, 12,
13, 20. The largest bounds of Christian Communion.
When Saint Paul does enlarge the bounds of Christian Communion as far as he
can, he writes thus; Unto the Church of God which is at Corinth, to them that
are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be Saints, with all that in every
place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours. We can
have no Christian communion with such as deny the Godhead of Christ.
1 Cor. 1. 2. We cannot maintain any Christian Communion with such as deny the
Godhead of Christ; for they must (as Francis David, and David George, etc. did)
deny that Christ is to be worshipped with divine faith and love, because (as
they blaspemously said) he has not the same divine nature with God the Father;
Vide Epistolas Martini Seidelii Silesii apud Socinum de Adoratione Christiad
versus Christian -- Francken. and Franciscum Davidis. Catechis. Racov. The
Socinians are blasphemous and Idolatrous Heretics.
or else they must say as Socinus, who wrote against Francis David, said, that
Christ is to be worshipped with divine worship; and then they will if you put
their principles together (as you may see them together in that Racovian
Alcoran the Racovian Catechism) be found to be even the very best o^ them, but
a pack of Blasphemous Idolaters, With whom We ought not to hold Communion. For
whilst they do blasphemously affirm, that Christ is a mere man in glory, and
the Son of God only in a metaphorical, not any proper sense, We must draw
these conclusions, The best of the Socinians maintain,

mere man in glory, a very Creature and no more: The Family of love. H.
Nicolaus Familiae Caritatis: Pater dixit, Ego sum Deus. Vide Theodor.
and therefore they are blasphemers; and so are all they who say, that they are
as much God as Jesus Christ; for these are high swelling blasphemies, such as
the Deified Atheists of the Family of love (with whom I fear Mr. Fry has had
too much acquaintance) do usually vent to the great dishonor of Christ and
Christianity. Cornhert in Specimine injustitiae Deificati Hen Nicolai Praefat.
Mr. Fry his Bellows. page 16.


2. That a mere man, a very Creature Mr Fry his proud blasphemy.
and therefore they are Idolators. Master Fry must prove, that he himself is
to be worshipped with divine Honor also, or else he cannot make good his proud
assertions in his blasphemous Pamphlet; or else he must say as David George
did, that Christ is not to be worshipped with divine Honor.

Now then the question is, The grand question concerning Christian communion
with blasphemous Idolaters, seducing Heretics, and base Apostates.
What respect is to be shown, or Communion ought to be held with blasphemous
and Idolatrous Heretics, who are Seducers also, and do zealously endeavor to
poison souls, as it does well become Apostatizing Renegadoes?

They who are acquainted with Ecclesiastical Writers, Vide Gomarum, Voetium,
Zanchium, Polanum de Trinitate. Jod.
know what respect was shown, or Communion held with Arians and others, who
did deny the Godhead of Christ, though they did maintain that Christ was to
be worshipped with divine Honor; Coc^ Thesaur. Cathol. lib. 1. Goldast. in
Imperial. constit. Tom. 3. Elmenhorst. com. ad Gennadium.
I shall not tell long stories of Cerinthus, Ebion, Photinus, Arius, and their
adherents; but it is clear and evident that the Arians were condemned because
they were a pack of blasphemous and Idolatrous Heretics, Seducers, Apostates,
upon the grounds which I shall presently relate and such as are above
mentioned; They did deny the divine nature of Christ, and yet acknowledged that
Divine worship was due unto him. But I had rather produce proofs then
tell-stories, and therefore I shall give you the true grounds and reasons why
they are rejected from Christian Communion, and why even civil respect is
denied to such, who upon mature deliberation, after more admotions then one,
deny the Godhead of Christ, and the holy Ghost.

I shall begin with Christian Communion, The Reasons why Socinians are rejected
from Christian communion
because that makes most for my purpose.

1. These vain men are rejected from Christian Communion for these reasons.

1. Because they do not agree with Christians in the common unity of the all
who are come into the unity of the Faith, The common unity of the Christian
Faith.
are come into the knowledge of the Son of God. Ephesians. 4 13. And into the
knowledge of the holy Ghost, because these are the Baptismall Principles of the
Doctrine of Christ. Acts 19. 2, 3. Heb. 6. 1, 2, 4. Mat. 28. 19. Ioh. 14. 17. 1
Cor. 2. 1, 4, 12, 13. 1 Cor. 12. 13. Ephesians. 4. 4, 5, 6.

2. They do not agree with Christians The Adequate object of Divine and
Evangelical worship
Son, and holy Ghost are the Adequate object of Divine and Evangelical worship,
of Divine Faith, Hope, and Love 1. John 5. 6, 7. 2 Cor. 13. 14. Rev. 1. 4. 5.
Mat. 28. 19. Ioh. 14, 1, Ioh. 5. 23. Romans 15. 30. 1 Cor. 3. 16, 17. 1 Cor. 6.
19, 20. 1 Cor. 12. 6, 8, 11. They who deny the Trinity are apt to close with
Jews and Turks.
They may well go join with Pagans, Jews, Mahumetans in worship, who say that
Christ is a mere man. Mahomet did collect his Alcoran with great dexterity out
of such common Principles as that he might take in Jews and Christians. Vide
Epistolas Seidelii apud Socinum de Adoratione christi. Videl. de Deo synagogae.
lib. 1. cap. 2. socinismus ex Mahumetismo oritur, and in eundem resolvitur.
Stegman. Photin. Socinismus est recta ad Judaismi, Turcismi, nec non Atheismi
via. Exempla dabant Neuserus and Pafradus viri non indocti, quorum ille
minister in Palatinatu, hic praeceptor Classicus Scholae Marpurgensis. Vide D.
Voetii Antidota Generalia adversus Socin. page 437. 438. Abrah. Calovium^
And Socinus he followed Mahomets inctructions; he says, Arians and Calvinists
may be both saved, so they do but live morally. Barlaeus says, that Jews may
be very pious toward God in their Religion, though they do deny and reject
Jesus Christ; as Videlius shows in his Book de Deo Synagogae. And this, as
Barlaeus is pleased to call it, is accounted the most accurate Divinity of the
high flying Mercuries: Beza in his Epistle to Petrus Statorius has given our
great wits a fair warning. I have read of one Nuserus a Minister in the
Palatinate, who did first fall away to the Socinians, and deny the Trinity, and
afterward turned to the Turks, and did solemnly profess himself to be a
Mahumetan at Constantinople. And the like is written by Authors of good credit,
concerning that Schole master, who fell away to Judaisme, and wrote Letters
from Thessalonica, that the reason why he went off from the Christian
profession was because he could not digest the mystery of the Trinity. We that
are Christians, worship the only true God, Father, Son, and holy Ghost; and
therefore we must be true to our Religion, and beware of such impostors, who
would seduce us to worship a mere man instead of the great God, and our
Savior Jesus Christ.

My heart rises with just indignation against Mr Fryes blasphemous Pamphlet, Mr
Fryes blasphemy.
when I read there, That according to his understanding of the word subsistence
he may be said to be God too, as well as Jesus Christ, page 16. I know he will
wrangle about the word subsistence; but that word is found in Scripture, and
applied unto the Father, Heb. 1, 3. and we read of the being, or subsisting of
the Son in the (Form, that is, the) Nature of God; (...). Phil. 2. 2.
he thought it not robbery to be equal with God. Sure Master Fry ought to
think it robbery to make himself equal with Christ in subsistence, when Christ
is equal to his Father, and has no humane, but a divine subsistence only,
Error Personae fatalis error est.
which does uphold the humane nature which Christ has assumed; and all
Christianity is built upon the divine subsistence of Christ God-man as has
been shown, and shall be yet more clearly manifested.

In like manner, they that receive not the holy Ghost, cannot be received by us
whose happiness it is to believe, adore, obey the spirit, as has been shown at
large.

3. They do not agree with Christians The substance of the Gospel, and the
Covenant of Grace.
Whatsoever we receive in point of Religion ought to be received upon the
credit of all three Persons, but more especially upon the Divine Testimony of
the Spirit of Christ, the holy and eternal Spirit sent down from heaven. 1
Pet. 1. 11, 12. 1 Corinthians. 2. 1, 4, 5, 12. 13. They then who do reject the
Spirit, and deny his testimony to be divine, because his nature (as they
blasphemously maintain) is not divine, do indeed reject both Testaments, and
therefore reject the whole Gospel and Covenant of Grace. The Contents of the
Covenant of Grace.
Moreover this Covenant is made by all three Persons, for the Covenant does
contain the love of the Father, Gal. 5. 5.
the grace of Christ, 2 Cor. 13. 14.
and the Communion of the holy Ghost. Ephesians. 2. 18.
The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ does enter into Covenant to be our Father
in the Lord Christ; The Covenant is established upon the satisfaction and
Righteousness of God-man; Socinismus est haeresis pestilentissima, divinitatem
Christi spiritusque abnegans, viamque per propriam vitae obedientiam ad coelum
affectans. Socinianism overthrows the Covenant of Grace. Socinismus divinam
Christi essentiam, personam, satisfactionem negans, objectum fidei cultusque
tollit, Christianismum evertit.
and therefore they who deny the Godhead of Christ, must rest upon their own
righteousness and obedience for justification, and salvation, as the Socinians
do, and then Christ will profit them nothing, because they overthrow the New
Covenant and are fallen from Grace. Gal. 5. 4, 5. The Covenant is sealed with
the blood of Christ, who is not only the Son of Mary, but the natural Son of
God. This is the substance of the Gospel, the same Person is God and man, The
Son of Mary is the true Messiah, the Lord Christ, the only Son of God, equal
to his Father, the Head and Savior of the Church, the true God, the blessed
God, the great God, the mighty God We are redeemed with the blood of Christ,
the blood of God, the blood of Christ who is God. The Covenant is to quicken
and cure us.

1. To quicken us, We are quickened and cured by Christ, and his spirit
according to the tenor of the Covenant of Grace.
for we were dead before the Medicine came, and Christ and his Spirit raise us
from death, and give us a spiritual life.

2. To cure us, for when our Physician has restored us to life, he can more
easily restore us to health.

In the Covenant God promises to give us himself, The Spirit is given by
Covenant as a bond of union.
his Son, and his Spirit. The bond of the Faederal and mystical union on Gods
part is the Spirit, and on our part Faith, which is wrought in us by the same
Co-essentiall Spirit. And Christ is the only Mediator of this Covenant.

1. We have but one Mediator and surely of this Covenant. Christ God-man is
the only Mediator of the Covenant. Christ is God and man in one subsistence or
Person.
1 Timothy 25. 1 Cor. 8. 6.

2. This one Mediator is God and man in one Person: the Son of man. Mat. 16.
13. the Son of God ver. 17. Romans 1. 3, 4. Romans 9. 5. Heb. 7. 3. Ioh. 8. 58.
Acts 20. 28. 1 Ioh. 1. 1. Ephesians. 4. 10. Joh. 3. 13. Ioh. 6. 62. Ioh. 1. 14.
Phil. 2. 6. He for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, even he
himself and not another person; he also himself took part of the same flesh and
blood whereof we are partakers, Heb. 2. 10, 14.

I hope by this time it is evident that the Covenant is made in Christ the
natural and co-essentiall Son of God, The high importance of this truth.
who is God and man in one Person, and therefore we cannot close with them who
will not close with this saving Truth; for this is an Article of everlasting
life. Mat. 16. 16, 17, 18. Ioh. 17. 3. 1 Ioh. 5. 20. Ephesians. 4. 13. I humbly
entreat Mr. Fry to consider what has been said, that he may repent and retract
his unhappy opinion, namely, That the word subsistence holds forth no more of
Christ his being in the Godhead then may be affirmed of every Creature, Mr Fry
in his Bellows printed at Addle-hill. page 15, 16, 17.
That whatsoever the head did partake of, that did the members also. And that
according to his understanding of the word subsistence, M^ Fry himself might be
said to be God too as well as Jesus Christ, p. 15, 16. This is the unsavory
breath of Mr Fry his blasphemous Bellows printed at Addle-hill in February
1648. If his confutation be as public as he thought fit to make his
blasphemous error, (which he accounts but a molehill, page 17.) he may thank
himself.

I might add many other reasons, but I must be brief.

The nature of christian Communion
in the Son, by the Spirit; but I have said enough of that already in this very
Chapter, 2 Cor. 13. 14.
and handled it practically and at large in the ninth Chapter of this Treatise.
Ephesians. 2. 18.


The Sacraments of communion
which they who do deny the Trinity overthrow, as has been proved.

Christian Baptism.
God the Son, and God the holy Ghost, who are all three one and the same God,
the only true God blessed for ever; and therefore they who do not believe and
worship God the Son, and God the holy Ghost as the same God with the Father,
Mat. 28. 19
do indeed renounce the Faith and Baptism of Christians; Ephesians. 2. 18.
they take away the Adequate Object of Christian Faith, 2 Cor. 13. 14.
and Evangelical Worship. Act. 2. 38, 39.
God promises to be a Father, 2 Cor. 6. 18
Savior, and a Comforter to us; he seals his promise to us by Baptism and
fullfils his Promise by giving us his Son for our Savior, 2 Cor. 7. 1.
and his Spirit for our Sanctifier and Comforter; Rom 8. 15
for he shows himself to be a Father to us in Christ by sending the spirit of
Regeneration and Adoption into our hearts; Gal. 4. 5, 6
We are regenerated by the spirit of God, adopted into the Family of God,
married to the Son of God, that we may be heirs and coheires with Christ the
King of Heaven, and Lord of Glory; and all this is to oblige and encourage us
in the belief, worship, and service of Father, Son, and holy Ghost.

2. In the Sacrament of the Lords Supper sanctify the Name of Christ the
natural Son of God, and the name of the Co-essential Spirit; The Lords Supper.
the everlasting counsels of Gods Fatherly love, the riches of his free grace,
all the treasures of the Covenant and Spirit of grace, all the sufferings of
our crucified Redeemer the Lord of glory, are in this great Ordinance evidently
set before the eye of our faith, that by the grace of Christ, assistance and
fellowship of the holy Ghost, we may have a more intimate Communion with God;
for this sweet Communion with the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is by the
Communion of the blood of God, (Acts 20. 28. compared with 1 Cor. 10. 16.) and
of the Spirit of God. 2 Cor. 13. 14 This is the grand Ordinance for the
highest, The growing, saving communion
sweetest, strongest Communion with the Father in the Son, and by the spirit
that can be attained to whilst we are clothed with flesh. The Gospel is
appointed both for the begetting and increase of grace; this Ordinance is
annexed to the Gospel, that the Gospel and this Ordinance both together may (by
the power of Christ and his holy Spirit) be effectual according to the Counsel
of Gods will for bringing of lost Sinners into a saving communion, nay, a
growing, thriving communion with Father, Son, and holy Ghost, that we may come
to be enriched at last with the unsearchable riches of Christ, and filled with
all the fullness of God.

The mystery of the Trinity is made even sensible to us in the h^ly Sacrament.
setting his co-essential Son Jesus Christ apart in his secret and eternal
Counsel for to be the Surety and Savior of his chosen people: This is the
great mystery, which the very Angels desire to look into, and which will be the
subject of all the praises and Hallelujahs both of Saints and Angels to all
eternity in the highest heavens.

2. When we see the bread broken and

3. When the Bread and Wine is distributed The special application
Now this special Application is made by the assistance and communion of the
holy Ghost.

And therefore this mystery of the Co-essentiall Trinunity must be acknowledged
by all who are admitted to this sacrament, because this is the greatest
confirmation of the great Bond of the highest Communion which we can have with
Father, The highest communion
Son, and holy Ghost, and with the most precious Christians, who are sound in
faith and holy in life.

We can never understand the Presence, Sacramental knowledge.
Institution, and mind of Christ in this Ordinance, unless we believe the
cursed condition of men in their natural estate, the divine nature and person
of Christ, the greatness of the price that was paid for the satisfaction of
Gods justice, and appeasing of Gods wrath, who did not spare his own
Co-essential Son, but manifested his hatred against sin, and love to his Elect
in not sparing his Son, but breaking his body and shedding of his blood, that
we might be redeemed by the blood of God; this is the mystery which is made
sensible in the Sacrament, and is really evident to the eye of faith,
Sacramental mysteries are spiritual and yet real.
Gal. 3. 1. And whosoever looks upon these great mysteries of the Gospel as
fancies, and does not believe them to be real things truly exhibited, really
presented to believers in a Sacramental, mystical, Joh. 6. 55, 63.
spiritual way in this Ordinance, has not yet learnt the truth as it is in
Jesus; and is not prepared for such high Communion. We Christians do not come
with hungry and thirsty souls longing after farther Communion with Christ for
mortifying of our lusts, Sweet communi^n for hungry Souls.
and increase of all our graces by his spirit, until we believe this grand
mystery of Faith; and we are then experimentally acquainted with the mystery of
Godliness when we have been made drink into one Spirit with Christ and his
Members, when we look upon him whom we have pierced by our sins, and
acknowledge him to be the natural and Co-essential Son of God; there can be
none of those fiduciall breathings after Christ, Penitential meltings before
him, or obediential closings with him, as is evident by our ninth Chapter
until we do in some measure believe this mystery of Faith, and understand the
substance of the Covenant of grace, which is sealed in this Sacrament by God,
and must be actually renewed by every good Communicant; our Meditations, Faith,
Love, Repentance, Joy, Thankfulness, will not be rightly placed or exercised,
if this grand mystery of Faith and Godliness be rejected by us.

6. I might argue from all the Offices of The Offices of Christ.
do utterly disable Jesus Christ from being a Mediator, a Priest, a Prophet, a
King, for the saving of his people to the uttermost.

They who deny the divine Essence and Person of Christ, do deny his
satisfaction to be all-sufficient in our behalf. They depose Christ from that
spiritual and heavenly kingdom which he has by Nature; and render him
incapable of that Mediatory Kingdom, which is delegated to Christ, God man by
the Decree of the Co-essentiall Trinunity. But I have said enough of that in
the former part of this Book.

I pass on to enquire what civil respect Concerning civil respect.
2 Ioh. 9. 10, 11. contains a very full and satisfactory answer; Whosoever
transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God; he that
abides in the doctrine of Christ he has both the Father and the Son. If there
come any unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house
neither bid him God speed. For he that bids him God speed, is partaker of
his evil deeds.

But that this point may be more clearly stated, and all mistakes prevented, be
pleased to consider,

1. That such Points of Religion and Worship as are necessary to be known and
believed for the maintenance of Christian, The question stated in some few
conclusions concerning the rejecting of such as are unblameable in their life,
when they grow obstinate in singing against conscience.
spiritual, saving Communion with Father, Son, and holy Ghost, are clearly
delivered in the holy Scriptures of truth.

2. That if men who were formerly unblameable in their life and conversation,
be seduced into any error which does contradict, or subvert such Fundamental
Points, they ought to be instructed with the spirit of meekness in a Christian
and brotherly way.

3. They are to be admonished with all faithfulness and meekness of Wisdom
twice or thrice, that they may understand the importance of the truth which is
denied, the danger of the error maintained, the sad consequences of both, that
if their conscience be not feared, they may return from their beloved and
damned errors.

4. If after all this meekness, patience, and forbearance, all Christian
instructions, and brotherly admonitions, they do (as men that are judicially
blinded for sinning against conscience)

1. Persist in their error.

2 Reject and revile the truth of God in these high and necessary Points.

3. Fall from the grace of God, frustrate the grace and Covenant of God,
evacuate the death of Christ, depose Christ and his Spirit from their Throne
and Godhead.

4. Seduce and poison others. Mat. 21. 38.

5. Deny and overthrow the foundation of divine Faith, Hope, Love, and
Justification by Faith, and the Adequate object also of all Christian Faith,
Evangelicall Worship, and sincere Obedience;

These bold Atheists (for they deny the only true God, Father, Son, and holy
Ghost) may without any scruple be rejected from Christian Communion. Tit. 3.
10, 11.
For there is certainly some lust or other which hinders them from seeing the
truth, He who persists in ^ dangerous error after two admonitions wisely and
faithfully dispensed, is condemned of himself, that is, of his own conscience.
Read Reverend Mr Cotton his Answer to Mr Williams p. 26, 27. and so m^o p. 35.
or professing that they do see it, and therefore it may be taken for granted
that these men are obstinate, self-condemned men, men that combine with their
Wills and Lusts against their own conscience, and clear shining Scriptures.
And therefore these men cannot complain that they are punished for their
conscience, when they are indeed punished for sinning against their conscience;
because they are condemned by their own conscience.

But it will be said that there are scarce any such men to be found as I have
described. Ob.


To which I answer, Sol.
Be pleased but to consider what has been delivered in this very Chapter
already, No man ought to be punished till he sins against conscience.
and compare it with the foregoing Chapters, and with the many blasphemous
Pamphlets which do pass up and down without control in this licentious Age
(in which men adventure upon the very language of hell under pretense of
exercising their Christian Liberty, and speaking according to their New Light)
and this Point will be too clear. For we do already grant that no man ought to
be troubled for following the dictates of his conscience rightly informed, but
for following of pernicious errors which are contrary to his own conscience,
unless he be judicially blinded by God for his customary sinning against light
of conscience in former times.

2. Nothing is more common then for men to speak out of the abundance of that
natural Atheism which lurkes in their hearts contrary to the dictates of
their natural conscience.

3. Though conscience may be quiet whilst men are exercising their wits to
maintain some error which is contrary to those mysteries of faith, which
transcend natural reason, and are repugnant to the corruption of reason,
especially, if they (are engaged in multitud^ of business, connived at by such
as sit at stern, and) do thrive and prosper in the world; Conscience will
speak when it may be heard.
Yet conscience will find a time to speak when it may be heard, and then it
will scourge these Merc^rial vapourers with Scorpions, and set all their
errors and blasphemies in order before them with stinging aggravations,
Quidisputat contra internum sensum and natural conscientiae dictamen, est
Heraeticus Interior.
and prove them to be Inward Heretics.

4. We must distinguish between speculative Atheists, 4. Atheists.
such as Libertines and Enthysiasts usually are; Vide Beza^. A^not. ad Ephesians. 2.
12. 1 The. 4. 5, Tit 1. 16. Ps. 10. 11, 13.
and Practical Atheists, such as sensual men are known to be; for I am bold to
call these Heretics Atheists who deny the Son and holy Ghost to be God after
frequent instructions, and wholesome admonitions in cool blood and studied
discourses; ^sal 14. Psalm. 36. Job 21. 14, 15.
for I do not speak of such as talk vainly and blasphemously also in the heat
of disputation, or in a sudden Paroxysme of Temptation. 1 Cor. 15. 32, 34.
But he who does upon mature deliberation, A subverted Heretic. Tit. 3. 11.
(...) is quite thrown ess from the foundation, and turned upside down. See Mr
Cotton against Mr Williams, cap. 13. page 30.
after the application of so many gracious remedies (with such meekness of
wisdom as has been said) deny the Godhead of Christ after it has been made
plain to him, that if he hold this error he does overthrow the Foundation of
the Christian Faith, and deny the Adequate Object of Evangelicall worship,
because he does but believe in a Creature, and so trust in an Arm of flesh;
and that he does worship a mere Creature, and therefore is an Idolater; that a
mere Creature cannot satisfy the infinite justice of God for the sin of man,
and consequently that we are not redeemed, The punishment of subverted and
self-condemned Heretics.
and cannot be justified by Christ, if he be (as they blasphemously say he is)
a mere man in glory; Finally, that if all his faith be carnal confidence, and
all his worship Idolatry, it is impossible for him to be saved if he continue
in that vain faith and worship all his life.

Of such a man as this, who has made a profession of Christianity, and lived
in an external conformity, it is no breach of charity to say, Tit. 3. 9, 10,
11.
he is a subverted and self-condemned Heretic, 2 John v. 9, 10, 11.
an Apostate-Idolater, Blasphemer, etc. and therefore we may safely reject him
from Christian Communion, and deny all civil respect unto him: for it is to be
feared he is of their strein who said, -- Mat. 21. -- 38. This is the heir,
etc.

The Princes and states of Germany in their 100 grivances, Erastus and some
others would have Church Censures passed upon Heretics, Apostates, etc. but
they desired that profane persons and scandalous livers might be spared; a
Doctrine fit to be preached amongst Atheismus dicitur Synecdochice Cyclopismus,
quod Cyclopum instar nullam pietatis, and honestatis curam habeant. D. Voetius
de Atheismo. page 117.
Cyclopes, men that have no sense or care of piety, a Doctrine fit to usher in
Atheism, or Popery. For they say the Aen. Syl. de gestis Council. Basil. l. 1.
Pope may be deposed for Heresy, but not for a profane or scandalous life.
Grot. Annot. in. Luc. 6. 22. The Atheistical Syncrctisme.
Grotius on the other side, and some of his followers would have scandalous
persons excommunicated, but those (whom the reformed Churches have convicted of
Heresy) spared. But I fear that there are too many in England who would have
all the poison of Erastus and Grotius put together in a Directory for Church
Government, that men might hold what they list, and live as they please. What a
strange Syncretisme, what a promiscuous Communion, what a Church shall I say,
nay, what an hell would there be in such an Atheistical Communion as these
Mercuriall Grandees affect.

If we had but another Cassander, and another Acontius to compose a new
Confession of Faith; another Erastus, and another Grotius to join their
malignity together to make a new Directory for Church Government, the devil
would then have good hopes to reign visibly in England in heretical, profane,
and scandalous combinations.

I believe some may wonder to read what I write of Acontius; but those words
did not fall as a blot upon the man from my running Pen, and therefore I am
ready for more reasons then one to give a fair and an ingenuous account of
this deliberate and premeditated Censure.

Acontius came forth of Italy (as Alciate, Acontius detected.
Blandrate, Gibrald, and both the Socinus's, Laelius, and Faustus did) and
lived in the time of Socinus the Elder and Younger also; the Elder Socinus died
1562. and printed nothing; about three years after his death, Acontius
published his Book of Stratagems, in which he gives the right hand of brotherly
fellowship to the Socinians. In the year 1565.
When the followers of Socinus did begin to seduce, up starts Acontius and
pleads for seducers. When the Arminians do enlarge the bounds of communion so
far, as to take the Socinians into Christian Communion, Vide Remonstran. Apol.
p. 11. and Respon. ad Profes. Leydens. page 65.
they constantly urge the authority of Acontius in their Apology, and in their
answer to the Reverend Professors of Leyden. Acontius thought fit to lay aside
the ancient Confessions of Faith, and compose a new Creed, which Socinians may
subscribe. He came into England under a fair pretense of being banished for
Christ's sake; but certainly his greatest danger was of being called into
question for his intimate confederacy with such as were no great friends to
Jesus Christ. Judicious Pareus looked upon him as a sneaking Solicitour for the
Socinians, and as fast a friend to them as Bonfinius himself. The Learned
Professors of Leyden, Peltius, Videlius, Voetius, and a whole Synod of
discerning Reformers, have set a brand upon him. His Book of Stratagems printed
in the year 1565. was printed again in the year 1610. And as I remember, in
the year 1616, I find that he himself was living in the year 1613. In the
year 1631. his Book was printed here at Oxford, but generally condemned by
such as were learned and Orthodox at that time in this University; they thought
it more fit for the fire, then the Press.

About the beginning of March 1647. Acontius translated into English and
printed in England 1647.
there was some part of his Stratagems (translated into English) published in
Print at London; I confess I was amazed at it, but could not learn who was the
Translatour of it. We were at that time required to look after all books that
were pernicious or dangerous. and I did complain to the reverend Assembly
sitting at Westminster, that there was such a Book lately published, dedicated
to both Houses of Parliament. to the General, and Lieutenant General of all
the Forces raised for the defense of the Commonwealth, and recommended to the
Parliament, Army, and City as a Book fit to direct them how to distinguish
truth from error in that Juncture of time.

Moreover, the Translatour in his Epistle to the Parliament acknowledged, that
the Book never endeavored to speak English before; but if his essay did find
acceptance, it was his intention to go in hand with the remaining Books; which
all who have read, know, The third Book of Acontius which is now in English, is
very dangerous. Acontius perused by a committee of the Reverend Assembly at
Westminster, March 164^.
contains the quintessence of those poisonous dregs which are in his third
Book (now Englished) not so generally observed by unwary Readers. Whereupon the
Reverend Assembly chose a committee to peruse the Book, and report their
judgment of it to the Assembly with all convenient speed. Upon perusal of the
Book we found that the Author was recommended by Peter Ramus, but we did not
much wonder at that.

1. Because the Book is written with much Art, Why P. Ramus did commend
Acontius.
and the malignity of it very closely couched.

2. There are many plausible pretenses, fair insinuations, 2 Pet. 2. 3. (...).
and diverse religious expressions in it. The man was master of his Passions as
well as Art, Colos 2. 4 (...).
or else he had not been such an excellent Agent and Sollicitour in so bad a
cause, and so complete a Courtier as indeed he was.

3. Acontius spent a great part of his time in the study of the Mathematics,
he was excellent in the Art of Fortification, and therefore Peter Ramus might
set the higher price upon him.

4. He has many excellent passages which are of great use against the Papists.

But that which we admired at, was, that a member of our own Assembly should
recommend the Book. It was therefore desired that Mr Dury might be added to
that Committee. When Mr Dury came amongst us, and saw that he had given too
fair a Testimony to that subtle piece, he dealt as ingenuously with us as we
had dealt with him, and assured us that he would be ready to make his
Retractation as public, as his Recommendation had been made without his
consent, Aliudest scribere uni, aliud omnibus.
because he clearly saw that they practiced upon his passionate love of peace
to the great prejudice of truth, and that he was merely drawn in to promote a
Syncretisme beyond the Orthodoxe lines of Communication. For in all Syncretisms
and Interimismes between Protestants and Papists, or between the Reformed, and
the Lutherans, the Socinians were ever banished out of the lines of Christian
Communication. And therefore Dr Voetius does in the very same breath commend Mr
Dury sor^ leaving out the Socinians in his Proposals for peace, and condemn
Acontius for taking of them into his Syncretisme; his words are these,

Si percurrantur Historiae, and sexcenti libelli (ut vocantur) Pacifici (quorum
Catalogi editi cum consultatione Cassandri, and nuper cum libello Iohannis
Duraei de pace Ecclesiasticat inter Evangelicos procuranda) non invenies
communi pace quae petitur, aut praetenditur, D. Voet. Tract. de necessitate,
and utilitate Dogmatis de Sacrosancta Trinitate. p. 494, 495.
Anti-Trinitanos comprehendi. Fidem etiam faciunt illa, quae anno 1635

offerentibus, Vnus and solus Tractatus Acontii imprudentioribus nonnullis
imposuit, etc. Dr Voet. de necessitate and util. Trin. page 494, 495.

That acute and learned Divine does in very many places set forth Acontius in
his right colors, and says the Arminians made great use of him, and that he
was but one remove from a Voet. de Atheismo part 3. page 160. Quamlonge autem

Socinian, or guilty of a Socinian Syncretisme at least, because he does
exclude the Sabellians only, and does not obscurely include the Photinians
within the compass of his Sabelliani ab Acontio extra novum ipsius Catholicum
Symbolum and communionem seu Syncretismum collocantur, quia statuunt filium

Snake lurkes, which does not hiss, but sting; for this moderate man did never
say, that it was necessary for our Salvation to know and believe that the
Father, Son, and holy Ghost are one and the same God who is the only true God
blessed for ever. And yet it is his maine business and design in his third
Book, which is now in English, and in his seventh, which I hope will never be
Englished, to show what are the only points necessary to be believed for the
attainment of Salvation. But Acontius is not very modest when he comes to pass
sentence upon the Ancients who were rigidly Orthodoxe, and faithfully severe in
requiring men to believe those grand Articles of Faith which are necessary to
Salvation. For when he discourses of the faith of the man sick of the Palsy,
he says, Credebat enim (ut par est) hominem eum qui Jesus diceretur, etc. For
he believed (in all probability says the Translatour) that that same man whose
name was Jesus came from God, and was in favor with God; and therefore he
hoped that by this means he might recover his health. But that he knew all
those things which the Church has for a long time accounted as Articles of
Faith necessary to be believed to salvation, how likely a matter it is, I leave
it to every man to judge. Read Acontius in Latin p. 115, 116. in English page
79.
There are likewise many other Texts to the very same purpose.

Concerning the faith of Abraham he speaks somewhat like an Arminian, and an
Anabaptist, but concludes like a Socinian, that Abraham did believe

1. That he should be the Father of many Nations.

2. That the Nations should be happy by his seed.

3. Somewhat concerning the Land of Canaan.

But (says he) of those points of Religion which it is judged every body is
bound to know upon pain of damnation, we read not a word. Yea, and the mystery
of Salvation it self by his seed is very closely and obceurely promised.

I know Acontius does acknowledge Christ to be the Son of God, and to be God,
and so do the Socinians in some sense, as we have shown: But then Acontius
qualifies all with a pretty diversion.

Many things (says he) may be reckoned up, Acontius in English page 70.
which that we might be saved, ought both to be, and to be performed: As that
our sins were to be abolished, Per hominem peccati omnis expertem, virtute
immensa^ pr^ptereaque Dei filium itemque Deum, and similia. Acont. Strat. page
103.
and that by a man void of all sin, and of infinite virtue and power, and he
therefore to be the Son of God, yea, God and the like. And then he presently
mixes some things of less consequence, and concludes thus.

Doubtless that it may evidently appear to us that these things are likewise
necessary to be known, Acontius in English p. 70, 71.
either we must have a plain Text of Scripture that shall pronounce,
Whatsoever is necessary to be done, that also (to attain salvation) must
necessarily be believed. -- But there is no Testimony of Scripture that I know
which pronounces, that what ever ought to be done ought to be believed.

By this one taste you may plainly see, that though it should be granted
necessary unto salvation, that Christ should be God, abolish sin, etc. yet
Acontius will not grant that this is necessary to be believed for the
attainment of salvation; and therefore he left it out of his Catholic Creed,
and Syncretisme, and yet condemns the Sabellians, who did not deny the Godhead
of Christ, but said that he was one God (and somewhat which they should not
have said, or believed, that he was one Person) with God the Father. You may
hereby understand the modesty of the man and cry out as he did, Ein modestiam
satis peorfrictam, usque ad os impudentiae perfrictam. But if his seventh Book
(which the Translatour durst not adventure to English till he saw how this
would take) had been translated, I need not have said any more for the
discovery of this subtle Sir. Judicious Pareus Epist. ad N. N. Martii. 1.

Pareus, and the Synod of Lublin were able to detect him for all his courtship

Trinitate. p. 495.
Voetius does assure us, that if the Reformed Churches had taken Acontius his
third and seventh Books into their consideration, they would have rejected*
Acontius from Communion with them, unless he would have declared himself more
plainly, and made it evident, that coming out of Italy under pretense of
Reformation he had not brought the same errors with him which Alciate,
Blandrate, Gribald, or Socinus the Uncle, and the Nephew brought from thence.

They who are acquainted with Ecclesiastical Writers can readily declare what
difficulties they wrestled with, Vide Acta concilii Niceni, Council. Syrmiensis,
anno 357. utriusque Arimine^sis, anno 358. Athanasium de Synodis Oratione 2.

and what persecutions they did undergo rather then they would consent to any
Syncretisme with the Arians when it was obtruded, or yield to any agreement,
when it was offered to them upon plausible and tempting conditions. They who
have read the Acts of the Nicene, Syrmiensian, and both the Ariminensian
Councels, Athanasius, Hilary, Epiphanius, Nicetas, Socrates, Sozomen,
Theodoret, Augustine, know this to be as clear as if it were written with a
Sunbeame. Was there not an Anathema denounced against Liberius by great Hilary
for yielding to such a Syncretisme with the Arians, as Acontius did propound
for an Accommodation between Christians and Socinians? pardon the harshness of
that expression; I am not in passion, or in haste, but follow the example of
the Orthodoxe Doctors of the Church, who did use the name of Christians in
opposition to the Arians, to show that they did not acknowledge the Arians for
to be Christians, because they denied the true Christ, who is God-man, the only
Mediator and Savior of his people from their sins.

modesty, and moderation, as well as piety and learning, but they never offered
to conclude a peace with any of these new Arians; they would not admit any into
Christian Communion with them, unless they would subscribe the Confessions of
faith received in the four first general Councels. They who deny the Godhead
of our Savior, and the holy Ghost, are Antichristian, Antispiritual men; their
Idolatry in worshipping Christ, whom they look upon as a mere Creature, their
impiety in denying worship to the holy Ghost, their horrid blasphemies to the
dishonor of Christ and Christianity, their poisoning of souls, disturbing of
Christian Societies, should be laid to heart by all Christian Magistrates, all
Ministers and Members of Jesus Christ; and therefore this Acontian Syncretisme
is abominable.

Upon these and diverse other considerations I was desired to make a report to
the Reverend Assembly concerning the danger of translating and Printing of
Acontius in English; the heads of the report were briefly these.

The Report made to the Reverend Assembly. March 8. 1647-48.
By Mr Cheynell.

We humbly conceive,

THat Acontius his Enumeration of Points necessary to be known and believed for
the attainment of Salvation is very defective. Variatur fides, auge, tur vel
diminuitur -- non ratione primae v^ritatis, quae est unica inomnibus, sed ex
part credendorum, dispositionum, personarum, and temporum. Reyn. Pant. de Fide

1. Because in the Creed which Acontius framed there is no mention made either
of the Godhead of Jesus Christ, or of the Godhead of the holy Ghost. And

2. Although Acontius does acknowledge Christ to be truly the Son of God,

is in our judgment clearly expressed in the holy Scriptures, 1 John 5. 7, 20.
compared with Joh. 17. 3.

We do therefore conceive, Regula fidei pusillis magnisque communis

Doctrine which he mentions, are the only points which are necessary to be known

and did not hold forth or mention the points aforesaid as necessary to
salvation.

And we esteem him to be the more worthy of censure, because he lived in an
age when the Photinian Heresy was revived, and yet spared the Photinians,
though he condemned the Sabellians.

Finally, Acontius does cautelously decline the Orthodox expressions of the
Ancient Church, in the four first general Synods; and does deliver his Creed
in such general expressions, that as we conceive the Socinians may subscribe
it, and yet retain the worst of their blasphemous errors.

The promises being humbly presented, we leave it to the judgment of this
Reverend Assembly,

Whether Acontius his Stratagems was a Book fit to be translated into English,
and recommended to the Parliament, Army, and City to direct them how to
distinguish truth from error in this juncture of time?

Upon these few heads of the Report I discoursed somewhat affectiontely, and
freely, according to the weight and moment of the Point in Question. And
thereupon the reverend Assembly did unanimously desire the Prolocutor to
persuade me to print something about that Argument, as soon as the heat of our
employment at Oxford was over for the satisfaction of the Kingdom. I am very
willing to obey the Commands of that Assembly famous for learning and piety,
even to the admiration of those great Scholars, whose hearts were once
espoused to another Interest. If the debates of that Reverend Assembly upon
several Articles of Faith were printed and published to the world, all
ingenuous enemies of piety would blush at the remembrance of those bitter
censures which have been passed upon men of whom this Age is unworthy. But I
must hasten, for my Book begins to swell beyond its just proportion, and I am
called away to another service, which cannot be performed at any other time.

Acontius has invented very pretty diversions instead of Excuses to abate our
zeal against the most dangerous errors; Acontius his third Book of Stratagems.
he says, that Heretics do not intend to make Christ a liar; the controversy
between them and us is not concerning the truth, but concerning the meaning of
the words of Christ.

To which I answer, that he who believes the words of Christ in the sense of
Antichrist, and rejects the sense of Christ, and his Spirit, is not a
Christian, but is indeed and truth Antichristian. See D. Reynolds his learned
conference with Heart.
The sense of Scripture is the Scripture, and therefore if men be permitted in
these great and weighty Articles to impose a new sense upon the Church of
Christ, they do clearly impose a new Creed, a new Gospel upon us, and deserve
that Anathema. Gal. 1. 8, 9. though they should pretend to Apostolical
authority, or Angelical purity. Although we or an Angel from heaven preach any
other Gospel unto you, then that which we have preached unto you, let him be
accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other
Gospel unto you then that you have received, let him be accursed. Grotius in
Pietate Ord. p. 13. etc. Hic ego optima fide profiteor, neminem me nosse in
omni Hollandiae Conventu, qui non istis opinionibus, and omnibus, and singulis
dicturus sit Anathema. Christus est (...), credis vel non? si non, Arianus es,
Christianus non es. Vide etiam Nicet. Thesaur. Orthod. Fid. lib. 4. haeresi 32.
Athanas. ad Serap. Orat. 2. Disp. 1. and 2. contra Arianos. Photium in Epitome.

Grotius in the days of his modesty refused to solicit in the behalf of the
Socinians, and professed that he did not know a man in the grand Assembly in
Holland, that would not pronounce the Socinians accursed. The distinguishing
question, which was then put, was the old question, Do you believe that Christ
is God by nature? If you do not, you are an Arian; and if you be an Arian, you
are no Christian.

Acontius reckons up some things as necessary to believe which are expressed in
Scripture, and some other things which are necessarily inferred from what is
expressed, but he does not reckon up the Godhead of Christ, or the holy Ghost
in his Catalogue of things that are plainly expressed, or necessarily
inferred, as is most evident by his whole discourse in his third Book which is
now in English.

Finally, the Socinians take away the right foundation of faith, hope, worship,
justification, as has been proved, and lay a wrong foundation; they bring in a
new Christ, a mere man, and a new Gospel, a new Judge in the highest matters
and mysteries of Religion, their own reason, which they might infallibly know
to be not only fallible, but corrupt. They deny the true causes and means of
salvation, and the right application of them; Their impiety in not worshipping
of the Spirit; Their Idolatry in worshipping one whom they esteem to be a
mere man, and refusing to be washed and purged with the blood of the Covenant,
will justify all that reject them and their Confederates from Christian
Communion.

I am not at leisure to handle the Magistrates duty in this point; nor are many
of them at leisure to consider all that is fit to be considered in that weighty
point; but for the present satisfaction of such as know not how to study in
these busy times, Whether seducing Heretics, and blasphemous Apostates may be
punished.
I shall point at some unquestionable truths for the ending of that unhappy and
fatal Controversy in the Church of Christ.

1. There is no warrant given in the Word to any Minister of the State, or
Officer of the Church to molest, oppress, or persecute any man for
Righteousness sake; No man is to be punished till he is unconscionable.
does certainly persecute the Lord Jesus Christ. Saul, Act. 9. 4, 5
Saul, why persecutest thou me? I am Jesus whom thou persecutest; it is a fit
Text to be preached on this twenty second of February 1649. But I am now
learning another Lesson, which is to suffer persecution patiently for
righteousness sake, and pray for such Benefactours, who do besides their
intention, and against their will, make Christians happy by endeavoring to
make them miserable in their outward man by an unexpected persecution. Yet I
could not but take notice of the seasonablenesse of this truth, and put down
the day, the month, and the year, as the Prophet did. Ezekiel. 8. 1. And it came
to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the
month, as I sat in mine house, and the Elders of Judah (the Princes of the
people) sat before me, etc. The great Statesmen were at leisure now in the
time of the Captivity to hear the Prophet; if they would have heard, believed,
obeyed before, they had never gone into Captivity; for the misusing of the
Prophets, and despising of their message was the sin against the most
Sovereign remedy; The Highway to Captivity.
and when there was no other remedy, then God sent them away Captive, etc. 2 Chronicles. 36. 16, 17. Let all such consider this, who are poasting on in the
highway to Captivity.

2. No man ought to be punished for unconscionable as to despise good
information, reject prudent and faithful admonitions contrary to the doctrine
of godliness and all good conscience: Non tantum (...) sed and (...);
haereticus post unam alteramque admonitionem repellendus itaque est eversus
haereticus, ut qui suopte judicio sit condemnatus.
for of such a man the Apostle says not only that he is perverted, but he is
subverted, Tit. 3. 10.

3. The Ministers of God, the Civil join together and uphold one another in
the discharge of their several duties, that they may be in a capacity to
revenge all disobedience, and execute the judgment that is written, Romans 13.
4. 2 Cor. 10. 6. I Cor. 4. 21. Deuteronomy. 13. 10, 11.

Wolves that subvert whole houses. Tit. 1. 11. Churches, Gal. 5. 10, 12. Act.
15. 24. States and Kingdoms; and therefore they must be driven from the
sheepfold, lest the very vitals of Christianity be corrupted, Religion
destroyed, many souls poisoned, God extremely dishonored, the Church and
State endangered, as is fully declared unto us in the holy Scriptures of truth.

Zach 13. 6. as M. Cotton does observe in the ninth Chapter of his Answer to Mr
Williams, page 20, 21. Moreover, it is most clear that God does make use of
the Magistrate as his Minister and Instrument for the overawing of the people
by inflicting exemplary punishment on such as do speak lies in the name of the
Lord, What kind of persons are to be punished.
blaspheme the name, truth, person of Christ, and seduce (or thrust) men away
from the only true God, Father, Son, and holy Ghost. Deuteronomy. 13. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.

The Moral equity of this Command is very evident for the punishing of such as
do entice men from the true Religion, The moral equity of the command for
punishing Seducers: Deuteronomy. 13. compared with Zac. 13. and Romans 13.
because there is a reason given which is of general and perpetual equity. Thou
shall stone him, Because he has sought to thrust thee away from Jehovah thy
God. It is now certainly as great a fault to seduce men from Father, Son, and
holy Ghost; nay, a greater fault now, because it is a sin committed against
clearer light. 1. The general equity of this Ordinance.
And it is of general and public concernment to have such great examples
made in a nation to make the generality of men affected with an awful regard
of the truth, 2. The general concernment of it.
goodness, Majesty, and Justice of God. For this is Gods ordinance to strike
the people with such a reverence as shall at least restrain them from this
sin. And all Israel shall hear and fear, and shall do no more any such
wickedness. Deuteronomy. 13. 11. The Lord is acquainted with the frame of our hearts
and spirits, 3. The spiritual efficacy of it according to Gods Decree.
and he does propound such remedies as are proper and suitable to our
distempers; and he who does ordain such remedies will make them effectual by
his own Spirit, who does often sanctify legal terrors, and outward
afflictions, and makes them subservient to spiritual purposes, and therefore
these outward weapons are spiritually used, and are of a spiritual efficacy
according to the Counsel of Gods will.

When the Magistrate as a Minister of God draws the Sword in the cause of God
for the honor of God, The Magistrate must act as a Minister of God according
to the Ordinance of God.
according to the Ordinance of God expressed in the thirteenth of Deuteronomy
compared with the thirteenth of Zachary, and the thirteenth to the Romans, the
Sword that is thus drawn is not the Sword of Gideon only, the Sword of man, but
the Sword of God.

And it is certainly most proper to restrain them by the Sword, who will not
be restrained by any other Ordinance of God; men that have seared consciences
have strong passions; and exemplary punishments will work effectually upon the
passion of fear in a self condemned man, when no spiritual Physic will work
upon him, because all wholesome admonitions are rejected by him.

Carnal men are ready to pursue a new interest without any new Light, or
direction from the Word of God, and there is no way to balance these men who
are swayed by worldly hopes, Unconscionable men must be restrained by the Sword.
but by affrighting them with legal terrors from all those sins, unto which
they are tempted by self interest in this tempting age, Men that will not
berusled by Law or Gospel, or conscience rightly informed by both but do indeed
sear their consciences, and harden their hearts both against Law and Gospel,
must be restrained by the Sword, because they are unconscionable; Shame and
fear will work upon men that have any manner of ingenuity remaining in them.

VI. We must distinguish between the Object The Object and end of the
Magistrates power.


1. The immediate Object of the Magistrates Power is external, the body and
outward goods of his Subjects.

2. The immediate end of the Magistrates Power, is to preserve and promote the
peace and welfare of a Nation in its Civil Society; but the ultimate end is
for the support and furtherance of Godliness and honesty. No Christian
Magisrate ought to aim lower in any Nation, unto which the means of Grace has
been offered by the special providence and favor of God; Put all together and
you have the Adaequate end of the Civil power of Christian Magistrates over
all in their Dominions, who have given up their names to Jesus Christ. The
Apostles themselves, and the Churches planted by them, begged this favor of
God for Kings in their time (when you know who they were that Governed the
World) that God would so far overruled their Rulers, See Reverend Master Whites
way to the Tree of life concerning Humane Authority. Mr. Cotton in his bloody
Tenent washed white. cap. 70.
that the Christians might lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness
and honesty. 1 Timothy 2. 2. But it is readily acknowledged that there are some
Magistrates who are ignorant of truth and godliness, and therefore are not
able to perform the whole duty of Magistrates: But our next conclusion is;

VII. All Magistrates ought to study the truth and worship of Jesus Christ,
that they may be instructed in the Principles of Christianity, Magistrates must
study Fundamental Truths.
and damnable errors, that they may not by following their own blind and
erroneous consciences countenance Heresy and Apostasy, and Persecute truth and
fidelity.

Be wise therefore O ye Kings; be instructed ye Judges of the earth; serve the
Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling; kiss the Son least he be angry and
ye perish from the way, etc. Psalm. 2. 10, 11, 12. compared with Deuteronomy. 17. 17,
18, 19, 20. and 1 Timothy 2. 2.

And surely it is then no great task for any Magistrate who has given up his
name to Christ, to learn the Principles of the Christian Religion, whereby he
hopes for to be saved, that he may be able to judge and punish such Blasphemous
and seducing Heretics as endeavor to subvert the Christian faith.

VIII. God does freely reveal and communicate Godly Mgistrates a instructed by
God in all necessary Truths.
and their Subjects everlasting good. Hezekiah did prevent the Priests and
Levites, and for ought we read, the whole Church also, in discovering the right
way of Reformation in matters of Religion after that general Apostasy in the
days of Ahaz; read 2 Chr. 29. from verse 4. to verse 12. And it is generally
conceived, that David was the first that did discover that great disorder in
carrying the Ark of God in a Cart: read the fifteen first verses of I Chron.
15, and take special notice of the 2, 12, 13, 15. verses. None ought to carry
the Ark of God but the Levites, for them has the Lord chosen to carry the
Ark of God: and to minister to him for ever, etc.

IX. Christian Magistrates have no other Moses, The rule of all Christian
Magistrates
and such as have expounded Moses in the Scriptures of truth. This one
Proposition fully explained and confirmed would put an end to this unhappy
controversy between all judicious and ingenuous men. We cannot in equity
extend the Law of Moses to such as never entered into any Covenant with God, nor
to any that are led away in their simplicity before they have been better
instructed and admonished once and again; nor to such as do in a Christian and
Peaceable way dissent from their brethren in points of less consequence; But
we extend the Law of Moses to seducing Apostates, blasphemous Heretics, and
Idolatours, who are obstinate against light and admonition, and poison others,
or endeavor to poison them with Doctrines which do subvert faith and holiness
in heart or life, Deuteronomy. 13. 10.
that they may be punished according to their several demerits.

I need not say any thing of such disturbances of the Civil peace as tend to
the destruction of the lives or souls of men. Arius in Alexandria una
scintilla fuit, sed quia non statim oppressa est, totu^ orbem ejus flamma de
populata est. Hieronymus. Mirabatur se totus mundus factum Arrianum.
Hierome tells us that because Arius who was but a spark of fire in
Alexandria, was not quenched presently, he kindled a flame which devoured
almost the whole Christian World. And yet it is clear that the Church had done
their part against him, for he was twice excommunicated out of the Church of
Alexandria, as Socrates, Sozomen, and diverse others of the Ancient Writers
relate. And therefore when spiritual Instructions, admonitions, Censures, will
do no good upon these self-condemned persons they are even ripe for Civil
Censures. When the Wolves come into the Sheepfold, the Sheep run to the
Shepherd; the Magistrate is a Civil Shepherd, (as is confessed by all) and
the Civil Shepherd has some dogs at his command to hunt away these Wolves, at
least out of the Sheepfold, least they worry and destroy the Sheep.

X. A Toleration of seducing Apostates, Constantius, Valens, Julian, and
others, who were Patrons of seducing Apostates and blaspheming Heretics.
Julian the Apostates Design.
Julian thought that a Toleration of Heresies, and a suppressing of the
Schools of learning (that none of the Christians might be able to confute
them) was the most speedy and effectual course to blot the Christian name from
under Heaven. For this Sacrilegious Liberty (as Julianus desertor Christi, and
inimicus, Haereticis libertatem perditionis permisit, and tum Basilicas
haereticis reddidit, quando Templa Daemoniis. Eo modo putans Christianum nomen
posse pertre de terris si unita^i Ecclesiae, de qua lapsus fuerat, invideret,
and sacrilegas dissensio^ nes liberas esse permitteret. Epist. 166. Toleration
of Heretics in Doctrine, and Idolatours in worship made the world
Antichristian; See Reverend Mr. Cotton in his answer to Mr. Williams his Bloody
Tenent. Chap. 61. page 131. 132.
Augustine does well observe) would soon overthrow the power of Christianity.

The Toleration of Blasphemous Heretics, Seducing Apostates and gross
Idolatours has too often introduced a persecution of Saints. The toleration of
seducing Apostates, has often introduced a b^ter persecution of Orthodoxe
Saints.
Apostates are of all others the most keen and bloody Persecutours, witness
Julian. And when subtle Seducers are tolerated, they will quickly be
countenanced, employed, preferred; and then woe be to all Orthodoxe Saints, I
mean men ^ound in the Faith, Vide Athanas. Apolog. Socrat. Hist. lib. 1. cap.
25. lib. 2. cap. 22.
holy in life, and peaceable in their conversation. The toleration of Seducers
made the world turn Arian, as Ecclesiastical writers show; and the Toleration
of Seducers made the world Antichristian, Vict. de per. sec. vandal. lib. 3.
Eusebius. in vita Constable. lib. 3 ca. 4. Sulpit. Sever. Sozon. ^v^gr. Pau Diacon.
Baron. Annal. Hieronym orat. de non crad. Basil.
as Mr. Cotton proves. And how the Christian world has been, not only shaken,
but even broken by the Arian, and E^tychian persecutions, by the insurrection
of the Macedonians in Greece, and by the Antichristian wars and persecutions
for many hundred years, is evidently proved by sad and experimental
demonstrations. When King James did tolerate Papists, he did persecute
Puritans, as they then called men that were seriously and invincibly pious.
When Seducers get head, they strengthen their party by force, as well as fraud,
and oppose such as dissent from their damnable errors, as the Circumcellians
did with Clubs and Swords, or as Zedekiah did Micaiah with his fists. Muncer,
Becold etc. who were so tender and careful to preserve the Tares, would not
suffer the wheat to grow till harvest.

XII. We must distinguish (as judicious Davenant did) between tolerable and
intolerable errors; simple, Heretics are not pun^shed for Simple Error.
and complicate errors, as others speak: There are corrigible and incorrigible
Heretics, some Heretics are but perverted and they are teachable, Esterror
amoris, est and Amor erroris. Errores sunt vel praeter, vel circa, vel contra
fundamentum. Est error pervertens est and error, animam subvertens, fidem ever.

others are subverted, men that are smitten with a Spirit of Obstinacy,
impenitent and self-condemned men, condemned Formally by their own conscience,
or Virtually by their proud and stubborn contempt of Christian admonition, and
their voluntary rejection of plain truths, that they may enjoy their beloved
errors and their haereticall lusts; men whose lives are as full of Atheism as
their assertions of blasphemy; Seducing Heretics, who endeavor to thrust away
others from the belief or worship of the only true God, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost. The Calvinists do not say that any one ought to be put to death for
simple Heresy; as the reverend and learned Professors of Leyden show in their
censure of the Arminian confession. And on the otherside the Lutherans Vide

grant that seditious blasphemous seducing Heretics Idolators and Apostates
are when they grow incorrigible, to be punished with death, as well as
Sorcerers, Traitors or Adulterers. Let them name one of us (says Ergo si
potest, vel unum nominet qui aut omnes Haereticus censuerit interfi^iendes, aut
ita sibi pla^u^it ut alios omnes diversum (...) pro Haereticis habuerit. Vide
Bezam contra ^elli^m, and Monfortium* Et Tract. de Haer^^eis (...).
Beza) if they can, who says that all Heretics ought to be put to death, or
that calls every one Heretic who dissents from him in some pro^itable, but not
Fundamental points. Servetus (says Calv. in opuse. de Serveto.
Mr. Calvin) might have saved his life, if he had been a modest Heretic. Mr.
Cotton often in his (...) to Master Williams his bloody Tene^t. p. 1^6. 181.
Master Cotton approves the Decree of the Senate of Geneva for punishing of
Servetus with death. No judicious Protestant will affirm that errors are to
be confuted with fire, and faggot, but with meekness of wisdom expressed in
faithful instructions and admonitions: our reasons are spiritual, and if the
Magistrate draw the sword in Gods name, it is not to punish simple error; but
to smite some intolerable error, that is, twisted and complicated with
blasphemy, Apostasy, Obstinacy, or some such sins as are eminent in Seducing
Heretics, and destructive to the Souls, Religion and Peace of Christians.
Some erroneous persons have the itch, and some the plague; some of them are
melancholic, and some of them are mad, and mad men must be bound, or at least
not permitted to walk abroad without their keeper. The itch and the plague are
both infectious, but they are not both alike dangerous; and nothing is more
clear in point of Civill-government, then that Magistrates should not suffer
any to go about with plague-sores running on them. Seducing Apostates,
Blasphemous Heretics, and gross Idolators do not only subvert Order and
Peace, but Faith and Piety, they infect, nay poison souls.

XI^I. The glory of God, the good of Irresistible motives to quicken
Magistrates to dloe their duty.
the happiness of Christian societies are irresistible Motives to quicken the
Magistrate to act (against such dangerous persons as we have described
according to the law of judgment, and their different demerits) in Faith and
Love.

1. In Faith; for the Christian Magistrate does not act like himself, if he
does not perform acts of Civill-justice in Faith. And it is clear that if
there be no moral equity in any of the judicial Laws in the Old Testament,
and there are none at all extant in the New: the Christian Magistrate cannot
perform any act of Civill-justice in Faith, But it is indeed too evident to be
denied, What Laws are of perpetual obligation.
that

All divine laws which concern the punishment of Moral transgressions, are of
perpetual obligation, Vide Piscator. in Exodum.
and therefore still remain in force according to their substance and general
equity, abstracted from special circumstances, Typical Accessories, and the
old forms of Mosaicall Polity, For

1. These divine Laws are not expired in their own nature.

2. They are not repealed by God.

3. The authority of the Lawgiver is the same under both Administrations, old
and new; the consciences of Christians as well as Jews, are subject to his
sovereign and perpetual jurisdiction.

4. The matter of the Laws is Moral, and very agreeable to the Dictates of
nature, as does appear by the several Laws and Decrees of Heathens. Dan. 3.
29. Ezra. 7. 23. 25, 26, 27. Ezra. 10. 3. 5. 8. compared with Numb. 15. 30, 31.
Levit. 24. 15, 16. Deuteronomy. 13. 8, 9. Zach. 13. 3, 6. Seducing, poisoning, slaying
of Souls is by the law of Nature and Nations the worst of injuries.

5. The reason of these divine See Master Palmer and Mr. Cawdrey of the
Sabbath. Chap. 2.
Laws is immutable, and that reason is sometimes expressed and declared: But
it is not necessary that there should be any express ratification of every
Moral Law in the New Testament, which is plainly delivered in the Old.

6. These divine Laws are Independent on the will of Man, and therefore
indispensable man's authority.

II. The Magistrate is to act in Christian Love and charity against these
dangerous men. It is mercy to drive away the wolf, and cruelty to spare him:
there must be so much Fatherly love shown to the souls of Christians to the
^^ttle flock, as to preserve them from Wolves and Foxes. He who loves Christ,
the Christian religion, the souls and peace of Christians, will not bear the
sword in vain; his head, heart, hand, bowels will keep time in working
according to the written Rule.

XIV. The Happiness of Civil societies etc. according to the nature and
measure of their offenses. In all Civil States whose Acts are recorded in
sacred or profane stories, the Magistrates were to have a care not only of
Justice and Honesty, but of that Religion also which they esteemed divine for
the good and happiness of their Civil state, though it is no wonder if the
Heathens did misapply this zealous instinct of nature, to the maintenance of
Superstition and Idolatry, of a false Religion and false Gods. Socrates,
Theodorus and Protagoras, famous Philosophers, were all three condemned at
Athens by the Law against Irreligion. But let us look into Christian states.

When the means of Instruction and Reformation have been vouchsafed to a people
that are in Covenant with God, and they corrupt the truth and worship of God;
the Lord does not only punish degenerate Churches, but even Civil states,
Princes and People for this Spiritual Pollution. The Turk was let loose from
the River Euphrates to punish the worshippers of Imamages, Rev. 9. 14. 20. The
flourishing of Religion, is the flourishing of the Civil state; and the decay
of Religion, the decay and ruin of the Civil state according to the ordinary
dispensations of God. When Christ had rode through the Roman state on the white
horse of his Gospel of grace, and was rejected, then followed the Red horse of
War, the black horse of Famine, and the pale horse of Pestilence and other
deadly plagues, Rev. 6. from the 2. to the 8 verse. Can any Christian state hope
upon Scripture grounds, that it shall enjoy honor, health, riches, peace,
safety, settlement, if Faith and Piety be overthrowen by the indulgence of that
state, if Seducers be permitted to poison souls, to teach damnable Doctrines,
and persuade men to deny the Lord that bought them, to deny his divine nature
and subsistence, his Offices and the efficacy of them; nay, his very Redemption
by way of purchase, by way of proper and alsufficient satisfaction as the
Socimans do? The patience and bounty of God acting as it were by Praerogative
is gloriously manifested in our days, but surely no Christian state can be
secured by a council or an army which permits men to live without Christ,
without God in the world, without any spiritual communion with God in his
Coeternall Son by his Coessentiall Spirit. Woe be to us if we neglect so great
Salvation as is yet offered to us in this day of Grace.

XV. The Church as a Church has no Kings 18. 40.

XVI. We must distinguish between Christian Forbearance, vouchsafed to weak
Brethren, that they may live quietly in all godliness and honesty: and
Antichristian indulgence extended to blasphemous Heretics and seducing
Apostates, that they may live quietly in all ungodliness and dishonesty to the
infection and seduction of others. The Kings shall be rewarded for burning*
and God praised for judging the seducing whore. But judicious Mr. Cotton. is
afraid that the Antichristian Whore will steal in at the Back-doore of a
Toleration.

XVII. Gospel-dispensations are as spiritual they who plead for the Toleration
of these obstinate persons in hope of their conversion, do indeed proclaim a
general

XVIII. They who permit men to deny supernatural Principles, do permit them to
overthrow the Gospel, which is not written in our hearts by nature as the Law
is. And yet it should be considered that they who deny the Gospel, do
consequently sin against the light of nature, because they make God a liar by
rejecting the testimony of G^d concerning his Son. 1. Ioh. 5. 10. They who did
seduce men from the belief and worship of God as revealed in the Old
Testament, were to die the death; and yet the Old Testament is as divine and
supernatural a Revelation as the New Testament it self. And it is clear that
God did reveal himself in Christ, even in the Old Testament, for there is
much Gospel in the Law, and the Prophets; An Indulgence to such as deny
supernatural principles, permits men to be Anti-Scripturists.
because all the Law and the Prophets bare witness of Christ, and Moses (says
our Savior) wrote of me. If then there be an indulgence granted to such as
deny supernatural truths, men may overthrow both the Old and New Testament,
and be Antiscripturists without control: nay it will if this absurdity be
granted, clearly follow, that the Magistrate may punish such severely who deny
the truths which are wrote in Aristotle, but must not touch them who deny all
the supernatural mysteries of Faith Written in the Book of God; Blush ye
Heavens, and be ashamed O Earth at the Atheistical libertinisme of this
licentious age. Seducers who did thrust men out of the way which the Lord
commanded them by his written word to walk in, Mr. Burroughes Heart-divisions.
page 35.
were put to death, Deuteronomy. 13. 5, 10. though they were directed by a
supernatural Revelation, to walk in that way Reverend Mr. Buroughs does
often acknowledge in his Irenicum, that such as profess Christianity, are
justly punished for sinning against the common light of Christianity, For it is
not conscience, but the Devil in the conscience which moves Christians to
maintain errors against the light of Christianity, errors that are
destructive to the Christian Religion; and if any man has a mind to be an
Advocate for the Devil, I dare not be an Advocate for him; only I desire him to
beware how he hearkens to the Devil in Samuels mantle, and beseech him to cry
mightily to him who alone can cast out Devils, to cast the Devil out of his
conscience, The very attempt of killing a Soul deserves Death. See Master.
Cottons Tenent washed white. page 175.
and place himself there as on a Throne, that he may rule the conscience, and
command the whole man by his Word and Spirit.

XIX. He that by seducing seeks to thrust men away from the belief and worship
of the only true God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, does deserve to be punished
for his very attempt and endeavor to subvert souls, though he does not
prevail with one soul to depart from God. Because he has sought to thrust
thee away from Jehovah thy God Deuteronomy. 13. 10. The very murtherous attempt of
killing a soul by abusing, an Ordinance of God, corrupting of Religion,
telling lies in the name of the Lord, fathering our own damnable lies upon the
holy spirit, is a Capital crime.

Buroughs in his book of Heart divisions, page 23. 24.

I have much more to deliver upon this weighty point; but I remember what Hugo
