A SATYR AGAINST IN-JUSTICE: OR, Sc -- gs upon Sc -- gs.
1.
A Butchers Son (Judge) Capital,
Poor Protestants for to enthral,
And England to enslave, Sirs.
2.
Lose both our Laws and Lives (we must)
When to do Justice, we entrust
So known and errand Knaves, Sirs.
3.
Some hungry Priests he once did fell
With mighty Strokes, and them to Hell
Sent furiously away, Sirs.
4.
Would you know why? The reason's plain;
They had no English nor French Coin
To purchase longer Stay, Sirs.
5.
The Pope, to Purgatory sends
Who neitheir Money have (nor Friends;)
In this he is not alone, Sirs.
6.
Our Judge to Mercy's not inclined,
Unless Gold change Conscience and Mind,
You are infallibly gone, Sirs.
7. His Father, once exempted was
Out of all Juries; Why? Because
He was a man of Blood, Sirs.
8.
And why the Butcherly Son, forsooth,
Should now be Judge and Jury both.
Cannot well be understood, Sirs.
9.
The good old man, with Knife and Knocks,
Made harmless Sheep and stubborn Ox
Stoop to him in his fury.
10.
But the Bribed Son, like greedy Auff,
Kneels down and worships Golden Caff;
And so did all the Jury.
11.
Better had been at Father's Trade,
An honest Livelihood to have made,
In hampering Bulls with Collers,
12.
Than to thy Country prove unjust,
First sell, and then betray thy Trust
For so many hard Rix-dollers.
13.
Priests and Physician, thou did save
From Gallows, Fire, and the Grave;
For which we cannot endure thee.
14.
The one can never absolve thy Sins,
And the other, though he now begins,
Of Knavery never can cure thee.
15.
But lest we all should end thy Life,
And with a keen-whet Chopping-knife,
In a thousand pieces cleave thee,
16.
Let the Parliament first him undertake,
They Will make the Rascal stink at Stake;
And so like a Knave let us leave thee.
FINIS.
