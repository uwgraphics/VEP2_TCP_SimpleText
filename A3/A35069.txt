POEMS BY HVGH CROMPTON, The Son of Bacchus, and God-son of Apollo. BEING A
fardle of Fancies, or a medley of Music, stewed in four Ounces of the OIL of
EPIGRAMS.

Aut prodesse volunt, aut delectare Poetae.

London, Printed by E. C. for Tho. Alsop, at the two Sugar-loaves over against
St. Antholin's Church at the lower end of Watling-street, 1657.

To my well affected, and no less respected Friend and Kinsman, Colonel Tho.
Crompton.
Right Honorable,
TO make a large pair of gates to a little Cottage, were to throw the house out
at the windows, and reduce order into confusion. My wits are little, my
leisure little, my Book little; and therefore, (for the sake of correspondency)
my Epistle shall be little: and all these being summed up together, in little
time the product will prove to little purpose. My Muse is illegitimate, and
dares not look upon the Sun of censure; wherefore I presume to shade it under
the skreen of your goodness. If I should commend my self, it were to say the
Crow is white; or if I should pin applauses upon you, it were to set a gloss
upon the Sun; or paint Roses with Vermilion. All I aim at, is to beg you the
Patron of my imperfe^t Labors. If you please therefore to accept this thimble
full of endeavor, you will allow me more honor then can be contained in the
cracked vessel of my indesert; And engage my blood to veil bonnet in your
service: For I am

Your loyal Kinsman And servant, Hugh Crompton.

A FARDLE OF FANCIES, OR, A MEDLEY OF MUSIC, Stewed in three ounces of the
Oil of Epigrams.
1. The new Helicon.
What Is this advances our poetic strains,
And breeds a sea of fancies in our brains?
Frames us more high then fortune, and does keep
Our minds contented in distresses deep?
Is it the pimping water that does flow
From poetasters Helicon, or no?
Is It the Pierian well? the font that uses
To be attributed unto the Muses?
Is that so lofty in each puny quill
That Is on the insteps of Parnassus hill?
Pau^, ^a(...) it not, it is odious; and I tell ye,
Such liquor will breed chill-blains in the belly,
And pimples in the brains; and never clime
Up to the feeble honor of a rhyme:
Much less a Poem. But the only stream
That turns all horrid sorrows to a dream
Of paradise, and makes a Poet shine,
Is Bacchus, bounded in a Pipe divine.
Here Is Helicon in hoops, which does convince
A Princes frown, and make a pleasant Prince.
I told my friend this story, but he swore
He nere knew Helicon had hoops before:
But he is a foolish Imp, and for his pains,
I dig'd a whirl-pit in his greasy brains,
And filled it with this liquor* which began
To make him stand to his arms like any man.
Zounds, he began to swear. And swearing says,
His blood is up in arms, and he can raise
A whole Brigade of thoughts, which will not doubt
(If thought could do it) to give him the rout,
That routed great Darius, or overcome
The world with one poor finger and a thumb.
He calls Apollo skip-jack; and abuses
Cleio, Urania, yes, and all the Muses;
Spits into Helicon, and then looks sower:
Disclaims its virtue, and denies its power.
He swears it poisons Poetry. And then
He scratches Pallas, till she bleed again.
And now he falls to swearing by the Lord,
He Will run Parnassus thorough with the sword
Of his invention. And he would have you know it
Wine is the Helicon that makes a Poet.
2. Opportunity.
I.
WHy should I not dally (my Dear) in thine eye,
and chase the dull hours away?
He that lets such a fair opportunity fly,
he loses, his aim by delay.
And it is pity he ever should sip
Electar and Nectar, that flows from thy lp.
II.
Upon thy fair tresses (which Phoebus excel)
my diligent fingers I Will twist.
O there is my desire for ever to dwell,
and I hope thou will never resist.
And ere and anon, etc.
III.
Upon thy fair breasts I Will be mounted aloft,
and there in my charet I Will feel
The grain of thy body, more precious and soft
then the web of Arachne's wheel.
And ere and anon, etc.
IV.
I Will wander abroad in thy veins; and I Will seek
the mazes of pleasure and love.
The garden of Venus it is in thy cheek,
And thither my fancy shall move.
And ere and anon, etc.
V.
There, upon the lillies and roses I Will light,
And gather my sweets like the Be.
And I will not go far for a lodging at night,
For surely the hive shall be thee.
And ere and anon, etc.
VI.
Where, when I am hurled, my nest I will build,
Of Hony-combs all in a rank.
I Will buz in each corner until it be filled,
And make thee more full in the flank.
And ere and anon, etc.
VII.
Come then with a Cornish let us combine.
(I know thou can easily do it)
Thou shall take my heart, and I will take thine.
And I Will give thee my hand to boot.
And ere and anon I will sip
Electar and Nectar that grows on thy lip.
3. To his Rival.
I.
ANd wherefore do thy darts arise
To her sweet eyes?
What though she is fair? and others are
Not of a magnitude so rare
In virtue and in beauty? yet
Me thinks to quell
Those emulating thoughts, that swell
Beyond thy reason, would be wit.
II.
Tell me, what though her fame
Has raised her name
Above the crest of all the rest
Of her own sex, and does invest
Her with desert of princely love?
What Is that to thee?
Why should thou swell with enmity?
Or from the square of prudence move?
III.
What though her face a copy were,
More bright and clear
Then all the theams and wanton dreams
Of Poets in their amorous streams?
A president for future days?
Must thou therefore
Repine at my success? and roar
'Cause fate for me this lot did raise?
IV.
Did she ere court thee with delight?
Or lend least sight
(By smiles) that she affected thee?
Or would renounce her faith from me,
And of thy presents be possessed?
The Gordian knot
W' have ti'd by Hymen's leave, and lot:
Then rob's not of loves interest.
V.
Or were it not for that sponsal bond;
She Is not so fond
To unbequeath her heart till death
Shall ( nolens volens) stop her breath.
She alters not like nights and noons:
Lais and she
Were not of one triplicitie,
She Will not change suitors with new Moons.
VI.
Cease then to importune. And withhold
Thy shower of gold,
Mock thou not Jove in lustful love.
In vain thou seekst the rock to move:
Call home thy folly, and refrain;
Or else who knows
But thou (in spite of fate) may lose
Thy hopes, thy Charges, and thy pain.
4. The Irony to Phillis.
PHillis, O Phillis, shall I raise
Some lively sonner in thy praise?
Shall I confess it is my duty,
To vail my bonnet to thy beauty*
And sacrifice to thee (alone)
(...) Hecatomb, composed on
Ten thousand scraps of rimes that be
Scrap't from old ruined Poetry:
Take wit at interest up, and use
Some mercenary Juggling muse,
That may uncase to you and me,
Not what you are, but fain would be.
And let her spend (at least) an age,
To trim you ready for the stage
Of feign, where you shall have progression
Not for the truth, but the expression.
Stiffly affirming you more sweet and fair
Then fresh Aurora, or the air
In cloudy days, and testify
How many (...)overs from your eye
Took flame, and burnt both flesh and souls
To ashes, or at least to co^les.
And justify how many pass
To you, as to the Corinth Less.
And would not fear the infernal grove,
So they might but enjoy your love;
And warm their chiller spirits by
The sunshine of your sacred eye.
With thousands more such words as these
(The marrow of Hyperbolts)
Say, Shall I thus endeavor? No
This were to applaud my mortal foe.
'Twas her false beauty, too too free,
That like a tyrant martyred me.
5. Cruelty.
GO little Archer, to another zone,
And there display thy power: make it known
To savage brutes, whose truculent desires
Give ground to fury, and enhaunce the fires
Of cruel onsets. Chaunt the wilder crew
Of sensual creatures, such as never knew
One thought beneath a rigor. Go, and set
The conquering pile on the Rhinoceret.
Charm thou the Lion, and the Leopards fume:
Refrain the subtle foxes with thy plume.
This were a work of charity, an act
Of mere necessity; and would be backed
With popular applause. What though you can
Not temper them with reason, as a man
Is by divine instinction? yet you may
Prohibit their distempers, and alay
Their desperate madness: for we sadly prove
No shackle so restringent is as love.
Then fly away from me, and do not use
Thy tyranny my freedom to abuse;
Since it is needless. I was tame before,
Needing no instigation to adore,
Where duty bids. Go seek another shaft,
That may divert the former: and and by craft,
Reduce me to my reason, that does lie
Dazzled and martyred by a virgins eye.
O clasp those lids, and let my senses turn
To their own virtue, or to coals I burn.
6. The cruel Boy.
NOr Boreas blasts, nor Vulcane bellows;
Nor fortunes low, nor lofty follows;
Nor outward care, nor inward sorrow,
Nor news of ill shall come to morrow,
Could make my intellects more stupid,
Then has the pregnant bow of Cupid.
Proud Mars his lusty blows will smart
Not half so much as his small dart.
He conquers all men by his quiver,
And he himself is conquered never.
And who would think a child should do
Such noble feats? Consider too
What aid he has to hold the fort;
They are but of the weaker sort.
His Counter-scarps, half-moons, and trenches,
Are managed all by wanton wenches;
And yet they are not volunteers,
For they must all be pressed he swears:
Yet sure if wisdom would but pause,
In little time she would find the cause
Why they so strong their turrets keep,
It Is cause their trenches are so deep;
So deep dame Nature did alot um,
That never man could find the bottom.
Unlikely then that we should win,
That sink so low at entering in.
7. A walk in a summer-morning.
I.
JUly inviting in a morning sweet,
(when fair Aurora played
With golden Phoebus in a crimson sheet,
Until they were betrayed)
Florina (whom the gods applaud
For beauty) went with me abroad.
But Oh the blisses, the Seraphick blisses
I found, to feed my soul, in her sweet kisses!
II.
Such the perfections of Florina were,
Such pleasure in her love,
That every verdant Arbor did appear
As mansions all above
The Crystalline, where Jove attends
To welcome all his jovial friends.
But Oh, etc.
III.
Bright were the heavens, and their houses swept:
Virgo began to rise.
Agnus a galliard danced, and Hireus leapt,
While Philomell defies
The sleeping Bubo: every sweet,
To blend loves harmony did meet.
But Oh, etc.
IV.
When I had poysed every pleasant show,
And summed up all in jest,
I found the total object too too low
To entertain tho guest.
For if the Poets had her seen,
Then deifi'd she should have been.
But Oh the blisses, the Seraphick blisses,
I found to feed my soul, in her sweet kisses.
8. Thalius and Clarena.
Thalius. What new discu(...)esie has pressed,
To be Clarena's bosom guest?
What policy has over-awed,
(What the public eye did once applaud,
And glory in) the cheerful beam
Of thy curled brow? (loves copious theme).

Clarena. Ah woeful wretch, distressed soul,
Deluded maid, sweet Mars did toul
My passing bell, for I have found
With this with this destroying wound,
I am already pierced; and why
Should I (poor heart(...)) whose constancy
Is crossed by love, and whose ill fate
Sees her sad destiny too late
O^ce think to live* or own the strife
Of action, which assisteth life?

Thalius. Sweet star, let fall thy influence,
And learn me to unlock the sense
Of thy invellop't words, let us see
What in these Hieroglyphics be.
Display the emblemes of dark ire,
And light my limped eyes with fire
Of thy expression.

[ Clarena] Charon come,
I Would fain be at Ellzium.
I loath to live. I Will not endure
My thought should feed on what is impure.

Tha. Alas this this is no satisfaction:
No antidote to my distraction.
Some sullen fate has lately flown
Into thy contentation,
Whose tenure to thy Thalius show,
That he may aid thee in thy woe.

Clarena. Charon where is thy transporting boat?
Ore Stygian waves I Would gladly float
Thalius be silent, let me die,
And never ask the reason why.

Tha. Charon keep back, and come not here
To rob me of my dearest deer:
Let not her absence me prevent,
But let me know her discontent.

Clarena. Imperfect soul, (whose painted mask
Shrouds mere deceit) how can thou ask
The tenure of my toil, when thou
Procuredst it but even now?

Thalius. Heaven aid my weakness, and declare
In what respect my failings are.
Could my Clarena sink as low
As ere my basest thoughts did grow;
She, in that depth should not discover
The least of a deceiving lover.

Clar. I but too sadly I am told
How thou art bribed by lust and gold,
To violate thy vows, and stain
Thy fair pretenses with foul gain.

Thal. To the gods I swear it is untrue,
I never loved a she but you;
Nor did I ere embrace a she
For lust or gold: gods what say ye?

Clar. Report says otherwise.


[ Tha.] Report,
Is more uncertain then the Court.
And will you build your faith upon
Feeble Reports foundation?
Heaven can witness I was never
Shot by a dart from Cupid's quiver:
Whose bow was not your brow, whose pile
Was not your own subduing smile.
Some sad assaults indeed have bin
Acted by these whose loathsome sin
Is impudence: and they, whose aim
Is less interess'd then their fame
In goodness, flowing with more passion
Then is received with acceptance.
Such, such whose ill ambitions are
To catch in their malicious snare,
Those that are free; such as would shoot
And batter down all good repute.
Cause there might none unspotted be
To rail at their iniquity.
It Is true, by these I have been face't,
And in a single sense disgraced:
But unto these I nere inclined,
Nor gave the hostage of my mind.
Nor did I think Clarena could
Have once suspected that my blood
Was so unworthy as to please,
Or take impress from such as these.
If I should once be less then thine,
Alas I should be none of mine.
Should I (in passion) once agree
To play upon another she,
I should suppose my sin most great,
And (like a Hermit) nere retreat
To see thy face; but end my years
In deserts, where no sign appears
Of love, and beauty. Clarena,
Speak thou thy self, thy self, and say,
I know thou lov'dst me passing well:
Thy fancy had no parallel.
And where most love does reign (we see)
Thee always is most jealousy;
And where most jealousie's in fashion,
There Is most critic observation.
Say the(...) Clarena, thou, whose eyes
Have peept in all my secrecies;
And out of conscience, say if you
Ere found what now report does show.
Did not your self (with more intent
Then they, whose words and complement
Proceed from idleness, which draws
A large discourse from any cause)
Inspect my life? yet never saw
The smallest breach in Cupids law.

Clarena. It Is true.


[ Tha.] O clear the heavens then,
And let thy cheeks return again
To their first splendour. Call no more
For Charon's boat to cast thee ore.
But let us renew our faith, and so
We Will find Elysium ere we go,
Place'd in our loves.

[ Cla.] Pardon, I Have done;
I Will court thee with an orison.
Pardon, O pardon, I confess
My own, my own unworthiness.

Tha. Can she unworthy be, whose face
And virtuous temper, and whose grace,
The glorious angels, nay yet higher,
The gods (enraged with earnest fire)
Wax warm by courting? I Will give ore,
Thy pardon's sealed, I Will say no more.

Clarena. With kisses then, my own I Will cherish:
Dumps get you gone; let sorrow perish.
I Will live and love. Charon avoid,
More nobly are my thoughts employed.
Thalius is mine, and boast I may,
That I am his true Clarena.

9. The Complaint.
I.
AH me! I faint, I fall, I perish,
Unless my Claria come and cherish
My blew lips with a balmy kiss
Sacred bliss,
That recovers
The infatuate souls of lovers.
Come and feed
Me at need.
II.
Where art thou gone, the art always void,
When thou should be the best employed.
Empty, airy, easy, gentle thing,
Let us cling.
It Is an action,
Gives lovesick spirits satisfaction,
And does rout
Pining doubt.
II.
Come let us twinde, let us clip and close,
And drink Nectarian juice, that flows
from the fresh riv'lets of thy lips;
Where there skips
Many a Cupid
To revive a soul that is stupid.
And relieve
Us that grieve.
10. The Refusal.
NAy do not urge thines eyes: no tear
shall rear
(...) recantation in my heart,
No art
shall disresolve my fixed mind;
Nor bind
^o over to another will.
I Will fill
^o fancies but my own, where love
Does move
^e to solicit in this suit,
I Will do it.
shall thy untempered tears recall,
And thrall
(...) heart that is free, to fry and tire
In fire
Of vexing fancy? No, I Will first
Be cursed
With each pernicious and ill fate,
But that,
When I was first polluted in
The sin
Of serving thee, thou had no purse;
Nay worse,
Thou had not one poor spark of grace,
Nor face
That might entice me, no desert
Thou were
Endowed with. All thy breast within
Was sin,
Yet though thou have no coin nor grace,
Nor face;
And though thy sins are manifold,
Untold:
It is not this provokes my heart
To part
With thine; only my will (I vow)
Says, Go,
Or otherwise I could have staid,
And played
The fool. I could dispend with all
Those small
Defects, and could have born what ere
Was there
Of sin too much, only I must
Be just
Unto my will, which has forsook
Loves book;
Then do not welter at my change,
Think strange
At no mischance. It Is the lame cause
Withdrawes
My love as won it. Both my love and loathing
Spring only hence, I love and loath for nothing.
11. The Check.
DOwn ye aspiring thoughts, where would ye mount?
What? would ye veil proud Atlas brow, or count
The countlesse lights of heaven? Do you strive
(With Polyphemus) to unthrone, and drive
Great Jupiter from his imperial seat?
Alas, alas, your power is not so great.
Review your weakness, span your selves again,
I am but dust and ashes; O refrain
This frailty, and self-flattery, and see
The inside of thine imbecillitie.
I Am but a pondrous clod, and cannot rise
Above the stage of earth, each thought that flies
Higher then that, is haughty, and does prance,
And may (with its excelsity) advance
My final ruin. He that looks to sit
Above his fellows, deals with pride, not wit:
His guide is Folly, and his friend a stranger;
The Lifeguard of his safety is but Danger.
Then die conceits, and rest within the tomb
Of earth, polluted earth, from whence ye come.
12. The Query.
SAy; Shall I love her? I, or no?
Her that has left me wounded so,
So wounded that I must endure
An endless wound, a wound past cure;
Past all the cure of physics art,
That art works nothing on a heart,
A grieved heart, a heart that groans,
That groans for love, whom love disowns.
Whom love (for spite) did set on fire;
Did set on fire, and then retire;
Retire (like Nero) to some mont,
And there in scorn did look upon it,
Upon the heart she had betrayed;
Upon the flame that she had made.
Oh, shall I still her eyes adore?
Adore her eyes that have given ore,
Given ore to heal me, or recruite
My faintings, when one look would do it?
Say, Shall I at her absence grieve?
Or pin my love upon her sleeve?
No, all is but passion, and there needs
No such endeavor, no such deeds.
Then farewell love, thou restless guest,
And lodge no longer in my breast.
I Will walk no more in beauties light,
Since it is more dangerous then night;
Full of deceitful Crannies: and
Will scarcely let good tempers stand
(...) day in peace. And hardly knows
At best) how to pay half it owes,
^ur offered souls it takes in vain,
and pays our favors with disdain.
13. The Wish.
I.
O That I had by Gyges ring,
Or Daedalus his well-flegd'd wing,
^r Europ's Bull; or any thing
II.
that would convey me to that Zone,
^here my heart (imp't by love) is flown,
and left me dying all alone.
III.
^et speaking tears express my woes.
^h heartlesse man! Oh fortune! Oh!
(...)ve, bring my heart, or let me go,
IV.
^o fetch that tyrant's that possesses
^ine in her bosom, and near guesses
^he large extent of my distresses.
V.
^et since the have stolen (by thy sweet power)
^y heart, and keep'st it in thy tower.
and leave me in despair to lover.
VI.
I Will count such fortune but a bubble:
And to revenge me of this trouble,
I Will say thou have a heart that is double.
14. The Petition.
I.
O Pity, pity him that fryes
Upon the grid-irons of thine eyes.
What greater plague could hell devise?
II.
No Juniper has such a coal:
No torture can torment a soul
So bad as love when it does control.
III.
The Sun grows warmer by my fire:
And by my sighs the winds retire.
My tears advance the Ocean higher.
IV.
O turn, thou Antidote alone,
And mollify thy heart of stone,
Before I perish flesh and bone.
V.
Change thou thy Marble into moss:
And do not smell of Charing-crosse.
To lose a hard heart is no loss.
VI.
O cool me in thy shady grove:
And from my senses quite remove
The sulfurous odor of a stove.
VII.
Or else a tyrant thou will be,
That have the heart to stand and see
The woeful martyrdom of me.
VIII.
Of me, whose labor and endever,
Was prone to be thy slave for ever,
And to resist thy fancy never.
IX.
Of me, whose solace, and whose rest
Could not suppose it self more blessed,
Then when I thought thou lov'dst me best.
X.
Of me, of me, and only me,
That fancied once, I never could be
Happy, but in thy company.
XI.
And now that thou should be my bane,
Retorting such reward again,
Is grief too great for me to explain.
XII.
But since I must be thus withstood,
And none may quench my boiling blood;
My passion shall produce a flood.
XIII.
A flood of tears shall flow so free,
That they shall quench these flames in me:
And then I Will scorn thy Love, and thee.
15. A brave temper.
I.
YOu lumps of the earth, will you never be wise?
Go barter your plumbets for plumes, and arise.
Your spirits you tire, like Dun in the mire.
The gold and the silver that Fortune has lent you,
Hold your freedoms in chase, and disfigure the face;
And in stead of a pleasure, are toils that torment you
II.
And these are the blessings your labors beget,
Y' are clear of the Compters, yet ye are in debt,
For sadly you find you have imprisoned your mind;
And nothing can bail out your hearts from your purses*
Besides you induce Panick fear, and abuse,
Well riveted in by the poor, in their curses.
III.
Now as for the Poets, they feel no such weight:
What they gain in the morning* they spend at the night*
And when they have done, they lie down with the sun,
Commending their bodies to heavens protection.
And they fear not the thief that disturbs your relief;
That keeps you awake, and your joys in subjection.
IV.
There Is none will break through our walls (we presume)
To rifle our coss^rs, and ransack our room.
We have no such things as J^wels and rings.
No St -- thief nor highway man arms at our treasure.
We do what we please, and our selves keep the keys
Of our own enlargement: and take'^ at our pleasure.
V
Each man is a Consul to himself, and does sit
Sole Judge in the Courts of Canary and wit.
We build not our hopes on the pardons of Popes.
Our hearts they are clear, and we will not imbrue um
With corruptible crimes, and errors of times,
We never fall out about meum and tuum.
VI
While we in the lofts of our liquor do lie,
The eyes Astronomy reach not so high;
For then we have more of riches in store,
Then they which have purchased Episcopal livings:
With the lands, and the means of Chapters and Deans,
Which now is their fee simple for only thanks-givings.
16. The Search.
OUt she is gone, and I will follow:
Help me, help me good Apollo.
Come Lucina, bring thy taper:
Lusty Mars lend me thy rapier.
I Will not stay for time nor danger;
Nor be dashed by friend or stranger.
Night and day I Will not be quiet;
Nor receive my rest, nor diet,
Till I find
What my mind
Feeds upon. No frowning rigor,
No fierce Wolf, nor furious Tiger
Shall repeal me, or refrain me;
No engagement shall constrain me.
No false pleasure shall me flatter;
No tempestuous storm shall batter
Down my fixed resolution;
Nor affront my prosecution,
Till my breath
Fails by death.
But who shall be my attendant,
Presbyter or Independent?
Pages, sure I need not any,
Though I might be served by many.
With no rival I will mingle;
Love is best when it is single:
Ergo I alone will wander,
Till alone I understand her
That does sway
Night and day
My vexed fancy. Oh but whither
Shall I ramble to be with her?
If among the gods I enter,
There I shall not circumvent her.
She Is not so devoutly given,
As to lodge her soul in heaven.
She conceived it not her duty
To trust more to zeal then beauty.
Nor could I
Ere discry
Any cause why she should do it,
When I nicely look into it:
Beauty (natures prize and potion)
Got more profit then devotion.
Is It not true then? judge you of it,
We love that most yields most profit;
Therefore I will never mind her
In celestial orbs to find her;
It would be
Hard for me:
Yet perhaps she took her station
In some apparent Constellation,
Which, if seamen did but know it,
They would point their staff unto it:
And for observations, follow
Her in stead of bright Apollo.
If among the birds she gathers,
She Will be noted by her feathers,
Such as are
Richly fair
And will quite forsake loves fountains,
For the sweet Arabian mountains,
Where the Phoenix lately burned,
To whose nature she is turned.
If with Pluto she abides,
And within those groves resideth;
Then I am resolved to think it,
That she is in every Pinket,
That is seen
On the green.
But why are my thoughts extended
To such breadth? she is comprehended
On the surface of the center
Where earth's globe does complement her.
She Is apparent in each flower,
And therein displayes her power.
Smell but on the sweetest posies:
Look upon the blushing roses;
There thine eye
Shall discry
Her, but it is too faint and weakly,
And in them she looks sickly.
The are but types, and cannot show her
As she is, one half so pure.
She is the prop of natures glory;
Beauty far exceeding story,
That may teach perfection better
By her golden rule and letter.
Such is she
Sought by me.
Now if any man discryes her,
For loves sake let him surprise her;
Let him take her by the finger,
And to Cupid's palace bring her.
And of her take twice two kisses,
And he will need no greater blisses.
It Is sufficient to requite all
His endeavors. So good night all
You that know
Lovers woe.
17. A Woman.
I
A Woman is a wanton thing,
And only serves to dandle,
A bow that bends without a string:
A knife without a handle;
For if thereon your hand you put,
It Is ten to one but you are cut.
II.
A woman is a lighted taper,
She burns as she sings:
Lovers (like flies) while there they vapor,
They scorch away their wings;
Then down they fall into her pit,
And there they drown both joy and wit.
III.
A woman for her constancy,
I Will worship and adore:
For she is bad, and she will be
The same for evermore:
Or if she change from doing ill,
Be sure it is done against her will.
IV.
A woman is a mystery,
The learned scan
Whose bottom never could fathomed be
By all the art of man:
And she is one that can adorn
Her husbands forehead with a horn.
V.
A woman's a Theorbo Lute,
That Is always set in tune:
And if you put your pen unto't
From midnight until noon;
Yet she will be loath to let you go,
Because she loves the music so.
VI.
A woman is a Hartichoak;
Whose leaves are only good:
Her pleasant outside does provoak
Our veins and vernall blood;
But if you touch her to the core,
It Is ten to one you find a wh -- re.
18. Disdain.
IS this Loves court of Conscience, to infer
So many darts on one poor sufferer?
No triple Gerion, or fierce Hydra found
So many heads, so many stings to wound
The Trojan Prince unfortunate. There flies
Not half so many beamlings from the eyes
Of well-stor'd Argus, as my wanton foe
Has unlaborious projects to orethrow.
O you unworthy Nature, for your tricks,
I Am bound to curse you: you that love to mix
A pride with beauty, you that interlace
A cursed condition with a comely face;
That make such active engines, to surprise
Your friends, and make them suffer sacrifice.
You that are fair without, but all within
Foul with ambition, that contains a gin,
First ticing in idolatry to err,
And then to prize on the Idolater.
When first this Circe had my senses charmed
I mounted Cap a pee, most stoutly armed
To Oppose the adversary, and orethrow
His wanton fury, but he brings his bow
Unto her hand, and bids her to be sure
She shoot at such a heart, and stand secure.
Then in a fury, she began to throw
Her witchcrafts to increase my former woe.
A scornful smile upon me then she threw,
And seconds it with a quick pish or two.
So spritefully upon me she did fall
You Would think her body were a soul and all.
More subtle was she to enlarge my grief
Then Cacus, or Prometheus (that brave thief)
To gain celestial fire. She increases
Her doubled blushes, and sets out her tresses;
Makes every burnisht hair upon her brows,
A mortal shaft to slay me, but allows
No thought of love, no fancy, nor desire
TO allay the fervor, and assuage the fire
Her beauty kindled. But (disdaining high)
Displayes a brighter banner to my eye,
As who should say, Thou fondling, if I can,
I Will triumph in thy misery (poor man!)
But hanged, I care not, I will act a part
With resolution; since I find my heart,
The more it hovers, and with care implores,
The more it is wounded with disdainful sores.
I Will call my fancy home, and bid her rest
Within the private Cottage of my breast,
And I will be its nurse, and care no more
For beauty, then she cared for me before.
19. Commendation.
I.
MY Mistress is fair, my Mistress is rare;
Her beauty's a matchless treasure,
In every part, for nature and art,
Fair Venus her self does measure.
And upon my soul she has not the mole
That on dame Venus cheek did grow;
Her beauty no blot does know.
II.
Fair Helen of Greece, that Amorous piece,
That pleasant and notable sinner,
Although such a flood of rational blood
Was spilt by her rivals to win her;
Yet could she not be so lovely as she,
Whom fortune has elected forth,
To conquer me by her worth.
III.
So neatly she moves, so swiftly she loves;
Her glance is enough to ravish.
Her sanctified eye shines moderately;
It Is neither too close, nor lavish:
Her smile (if she please) can cure each disease
Where profound Empericks may fail,
Her courtesy can prevail.
IV.
An armfull of bliss, so sacred as this,
Jove never composed nor courted;
With angels so bright, and full of delight,
The poetic pens never sported.
Don Quixot would be in combat with me,
Did his quick knowledge but discry
My fancy had flown so high.
V.
Come then my fair Gem, and value not them
That can not endure to be quiet.
In mine arms be thou hurled while the troublesome world
makes war and rebellion its diet;
And then my desire shall ramble no higher:
My heart from care I will set free;
Thy love is enough for me.
20. A Letter sent into the Country.
Friend,
I Give an answer, as it is my duty;
Because ye wrote to know of Grizels beauty.
O Monstrous! Beauty I to thee petition,
Thou art more wondrous then an Apparition:
More bright then scoured Andirons, and more clear
Then new Stepony; and as brown as Beer.
Thou art as blew as starch in every vein;
Enough to make a Monkey break his chain.
Her hair (wherein my tangled heart does lie)
Shines far more bright then whip cord to mine eye:
Her breath's a Champion, for it is mighty strong;
Her eye-brow hair is nigh three inches long*
Her eyes, (I vow, I almost had forgot um)
Are broader then a sawcer at the bottom:
Her nose (that Gem which nature did allow)
Stands jetting, like the coulter of a plow:
Thy lips (alas too light a word to show
Their heavy worth) like dried bull-pizles grow
Both round and riv'led: furrowed deep (together)
As blew as Azure, and as tough as leather.
But shall I speak a word unto her mouth?
It goes from pole to pole, from north to south,
Incompassing a cell, that is full as deep
As the Devils arse of Peak; where they that peep
For bottom, lose their labor; and are fain
To come away (repenting) back again,
Her teeth (those bead-rowes that so much have graced (her)
Are not of Ivoury, not of Alabaster:
Have thou ere seen a mouse-trap, that is made
With steel indented? (art thou not afraid
To hear the dreadful rapture?) such they be,
But are not set with such equality.
Park*pales they do resemble. (Help, O heaven I
My fainting Muse, when theams are so uneven.
Help good Apollo, raise me ten notes higher.
^end down Urania: or do thou inspire
Me with the dregs of Poetry, and sense,
Let me not write with vulgar eloquence,
On pieces so imperfect, where does lie
In every wrinkled fold, some mystery.)
Oh the majestic visard of her chin,
That bears her chops away through thick and thin.
^obtail'd thou art, contex^d like a knot,
Thou Art just like something, but I know not what:
Thy cheeks fall back, as though for some ill cause,
Thou went to hide them safe, between thy Jaws.
Thy neck shall not be placed in our rhyme,
We Will keep the neck-verse till another time.
But Oh thy back, thy shoulders and thy wast,
Thy bouncing buttocks, and thy thighs, ore-cast
With Canopies of Canvase, and of Sarge,
^'le not speak much of them, they are too large
For ten-feet verses: But I Have seen them stand
Like great Colossus in another land.
Her inner part's so holy, that I dare
Not own so proud a thought as t'enter there;
Lest I blaspheme the Idol; and become,
For that offense, barred from Elysium.
Thus I, in part, have told you what I know,
Of things above, and things that are below:
And for what is wanting, I must needs refer
Unto the next return o'th Carrier.
21. The invitation to walk.
CLarena, Come and let us repair
Into the fields to take the air.
And in what place so ere we come,
Thy presence makes Elysium.
Let rural swains adore thy fame;
And Courtiers comment on thy name:
And let the world thy beauty see,
That Poets may eternize thee.
Step out with me to yonder bower,
And there we will pluck the fairest flower:
And when we have done, we will view, and see,
Which is the fairest, it or thee:
See thou those blossomed trees (that shine
With common glory, not with thine,
With thine that did receive a gloss
Beyond the luster of a rose,
From heavens bounty) how they wait
To wanton in their happy fate
Of thy sweet presence? where in passion
Of love, and joy, and emulation,
They may conspire themselves, and see
Their own despised deformity.
^nvade Priapus, see his leeks,
And set thy luster on his cheeks.
And he no sooner will epsy
The heavenly tulip of thine eye,
But in a passion he will run
(...) As Owls avoid the light of sun)
unto a corner, and will power
^own tears more lavish then a shower,
To see himself exceeded so,
And must become a theme below
^nothers worth. Me thinks I see
The bushes becken unto thee.
The dewy morn has shed a tear,
because she wants thy presence there.
Then prithee let us go to the plain,
Or else let us go to bed again.
22. A Mole on Celia's Cheek.
I.
What Is that (fair Celia) does presume
To the mansion of (that heavenly room)
Thy cheek? Does beauty bud or bloom?
II.
Or else did Nature place it there,
^n emulation, and for fear
Thou should above her self appear?
III.
And so she thought (as well she might)
She were not the author of so bright
A Gem, as on thy cheeks did light.
IV.
Or were it by a power divine?
That so that lively face of thine,
Might not without a blemish shine.
V.
Nor might appear beyond the Moon,
Which is for earth too high a boon;
For nothing's perfect that is sublune.
VI.
And so each Idolizing eye
(That in so bright a Zone does lie)
Should take thee for a Deity.
VII.
On this account 't might happily be,
For goddesses do strive (we see)
In beauty for priority.
VIII.
Yet how so ere it came, I wot,
It serves her for a beauty spot,
And to her splendour is no blot.
IX.
Venus had one, or else I dare,
Be so audacious as to swear,
Sh'had nere been counted half so fair.
X.
It Is poverty that plenty prizes;
The worth of health by sickness rises;
And beautie's bettered by disguises.
XI.
White, with black spots, does whiter show;
And she no woman is (I trow)
That has not one, 'bove or below.
23. The Bitter-Sweeting.
I.
SAw you Aurora, in her morning dress,
Ere sable clouds approach
Her burnisht tresses to oppress,
And vail her crimson Coach?
So fair, and fairer Claria shines,
Whose heavenly glance injoynes
All eyes that view her,
To praise her and pursue her.
II.
Ah! but thou serpent of infernal breed,
Ambition, that do rest
With restless actions, and do feed
Within so fair a breast.
Thou spoyl'st the glory of this star,
With thy deforming scar:
The have blurred her rays,
Like spotted Cynthia's.
III.
Has never fame created in thine ears
Pallas her pregnant wit?
Tush, tush, my Claria's fancy rears
More lively works then it,
Whence Poets must their phrases draw
And Satyrs stand in aw;
And dare not lover
Against so strange a power.
IV.
Ah! but thou seed of pestilential race,
Incontinency, sprung
From Pluto's Cave, or some such place,
My Claria thou do wrong:
Poysnest the prudence of her brain
With infamy, and stain;
And gainest more
Hate, then wit gained love before.
V.
And now my Claria, for so clear a beauty,
And wit so pure and free,
I must embrace it as my duty
To love and honor thee:
Yet from those vices that arise,
I Have learned to despise
A thing that is foul,
With all, with all my soul.
24. The Cheat.
I.
ONce I did love, and loved true,
Ah! but it proved in vain.
Claria, I fell in love with you,
You vowed to love, and more you said,
Your love should be divine.
What prank soever fortune played,
Yet still you would be mine.
II.
This re-inforc't my new born zeal,
And did engage me more
Loves charming blisses to reveal,
Then ere I durst before.
I fetched expressions lovers use
To court their Ladies by,
From Helicon; and every Muse
Claria did deifie.
III.
With Indian pearl, and gifts the best
Of nature and of art,
I fed this love, and with the rest
I gave my wounded heart;
And then I thought thou had been mine,
No reason urged my doubt,
My fate was rich, my joys divine,
With blessings walled about.
IV.
Because she did my presents take,
And own me as her own,
I little thought she would forsake
him she had pitched upon:
I thrived in Confidence; and said,
Fortune had chose for me
The prettiest and the wittiest maid
That ever eyes did see.
V.
But when I had conceived so,
Then I was most deceived:
Oh little, little did I know
Of thee I was bereaved.
Celestial beauty! How could thou
Commit so foul a fact,
As to infringe a sacred vow
With ceremony backed?
VI.
Unconstant fate, unconstant love;
Unconstant Lady too.
I Will scorn you all, and will remove
My love away from you.
And since unblemisht love must be
rewarded in such sort,
Henceforth I Will fix my love on thee
But for an hours sport.
25. The Catch.
I.
COme to the brim (boy) fill our bouls,
It Is wine new vamps our heart:
And sets a gloss upon our souls
Beyond the power of Art.
II.
It Is wine that drowns corrupting woes;
And Fortunes fury quenches:
The poor man whilst in sack he flows,
He feels no want but Wenches.
26. The Weathercock.
I.
Z'Life I reach my sword, for in my rage,
In thousand bits I Will slash
The Gnatho^s that defile our age,
And break their bones to mash.
Those that will turn
Ere they will burn,
And slink at every slash.
II.
Those that their Prince and Peers adore
For interest of their own:
Those, when their fortunes are blown ore,
Will vanish, and are gone.
And basely will,
Like swallows, still
Seek out the warmest Zone.
III.
Those that have learned to divide
Their hearts and tongues in two;
That will abet on either side,
Serve both the false and true.
And you that can
Praise every man
That keeps a bribe for you.
VI.
If Caesar daign to smile on such,
No paradise so sweet:
But if he frowns and frowneth much,
Their fortune's under feet;
And then their bliss
And pleasure is
Lapt in a winding sheet.
V.
If Caesar prays to Mahomet,
Then thou will be a Turk;
Or if Popes pardons he will get,
Thou Wilt do the self-same work.
Thus does thy zeal
To his appeal,
And in his lap does lurk.
IV.
Shall Caesar's frown, or Caesar's smile
Ring change in my devotion?
Or shall I pawn my faith a while
To amplify my potion?
No, no I hate
To wheel with fate,
Or move with every motion.
VII.
Poor is his faith, and poor his friend,
And poorer his renown,
Whose joy and sorrow must depend
On Caesar's smile or frown.
Such fabrics stand
On sliding sand,
And soon are tumbled down.
VIII.
It Is you profess Religion right;
And hate to hear of evil;
Yet in the darkest caves you will light
A candle to the Devil.
It Is you whose paint
Sets forth a Saint,
Yet you are most uncivil.
IX.
It Is you that act a double Scene;
Ye seem to be profound,
To this or that side ye will lean,
And stand on any ground.
It Is you (I swear)
That run with the hare;
And follow with the hound.
X.
My resolution is a rock
Of steel, and does disdain
To yield unto the proudest knock,
Enchantments are in vain.
I Will never prove
To fall in love
For fear or filthy gain.
27. The Upstart.
WHy should I humor every critic fool,
Whose law's his will, whose ignorance his rule;
Whose prying censure seldom keeps at home;
Whose tongue talks only of great things to come;
Whose heart forgets his unde, and looks higher
Then the low fabrics of desert aspire:
Whose arrogance does abhor the news
Of quondam poverty, and does refuse
To honor those who formerly did bless
Him with old suits, and cloth his nakedness
For pities sake. 'Cause now by fate he is risen,
And hoyst upon a Cock-horse from a prison:
Shall he therefore that once was so absurd,
Now think to claim acquaintance with the bird
Of worthy Jove? or shall my breath applaud him?
For by respect of lucre, shall I laud him?
No, let him perish with his pride, and fall.
The Devil give him reverence, and all
His damned crew, for they have reason for it
Cause he is Viceroy of their sable Court:
*It Is not the extention of his new swollen fate
That shall allure me to lick up the bait.
Nor yet the fury of his pride and passion
Shall ere unhasp my temper from its station.
Do what he can, yet I on no condition,
Will be a servant unto his ambition.
Though he is encouraged by an ample fee
Of nimble Fortune, and has outrun me
That had the best on it once, yet I will swim
Through every plague before I Will creep to him.
Not that I murmur at his good success,
But laugh and scorn at his unworthiness.
He that has changed his fleece, and now thinks fit,
By changing of his flesh to better it.
He Is the true object of the purest hate
That alters his conditions with estate.
18. The Declaration.
I.
CLara, thou art absolutely wise:
Clara, the art fair and fine,
And thou would perfect all my joys
If thou would but be mine.
In truth I love thee with my heart,
Though others tell thee so;
And say thy love shall nere depart,
Yet still thou see they go.
II.
O trust them not, they will work thy woe;
Their love is all in tongue
Their fiery zeal at first does show
It will not tarry long.
Their love's attended with a curse,
It Is barbarous and injust;
They only love thee for thy purse;
Or else their love is lust.
III.
They promise Joyntures fair and good,
Their hearts will be thy debtor:
All this is 'cause the have understood
Thy fortune is the better,
Is better then their own, (they know)
And hence it is they move thee;
But my affection is not so,
It is for love I love thee.
IV.
Were thou as poor as ere was girl,
Yet I abhor to halt;
For in mine eyes thou art a pearl,
And so thou ever shall.
I love those jewels in thy breast,
Thy virtue and thy wit.
And all the gods shall me attest,
I only love for it.
29. To her Friend.
It Is not with haughty malice I aspire
To court your sense: nor armed with Cupid's fire.
No wanton philtre does enforce my quill,
The sacred orbs of your blessed ears to fill.
I Am no rejected Echo, who to gain
Narcissus favor, takes a world of pain,
Divides the wind, the brambles, and the briers;
Hoping to kindle his untempered fires.
I mean not thus: it is reason does invade,
It Is she that acts, and she that would persuade,
She (moved with friendship) bids me, if I may,
Unveil your eyes, and drive those mists away,
That shroud the genius of your soul, and draw
Your frantic fancy to another law,
Then that of reason: tainted and unjust,
Created not of honesty, but lust.
What can you see of virtue, or of art
In her you love, that may exact your heart
To yield obedience to her frowns and smiles?
She Is all deceit, and where she comes, beguiles.
Is it her beauty only, that does move
Thy cogitations to the flames of love?
Shall that frail Gem (when happily it may be
But counterfeited out by subtilty)
Be rank't among the virtues? and be thought
Worthy with souls destruction to be bought?
What purblinde? what misconceived good
Withholds the nobler practice of thy blood?
Has Circe charmed you? and will you but please
To judge the Mine by the Superficies?
Search home, and see if her alluring skin,
Can smother the deformities within.
This done, you will find (poor soul) she does impart
Nothing that is counted rich, but undesert.
Then curb thy sallies, and thy self inspect.
Survey these ample errors; and correct
Them by discretion, purge thy putrid brain
From this corruption; then begin again.
With this quaint Siren do not thou be charmed,
Pity, good nature were no better armed
With prudent weapons, that they might improve
Their worthier fortunes in the wars of love.
Call back thy forces, lay thy siege no more
Against a garrison that is won before:
Poor prize, it renders triumph unto no man.
It Is won with too much ease: it is too too common,
Therefore refuse to storm it, and retire
If thou intendest to be honored by her
Who is thine in all friendship.
20. Chance.
I.
What Is my offenses that my fortunes be
Inshrined in the tomb of poverty?
But dust I am, from dust I came;
And unto dust return I must;
And he whom fate does bless
With health, and wealth, and worthiness,
Is nothing more: and he must do no less.
II.
Man, in the noontide of his glorie's but
A lump of Clay, where a quick soul is put.
All this you know, he is but so;
And he that can but say he is man,
Though fame and fortune say
He Is Prince or Pope, yet here I may
Presume to match with him: we both are clay.
III.
O me! How comes it then to pass that he
Whose corpse were gendred in the dirt with me,
Should rise so high? and I, poor I
Should fall so low as now I do?
Is It art? no, that is not it,
Our knowledge no such thoughts admit;
'Cause some men's worship are beyond their wit.
IV.
It Is neither art nor desert that does bring
This man to be a beggar, that a King.
No virtuous hearts, nor moral parts:
But that which still drives up the hill,
And daily does inhaunce
Man's greatness, and his worth advance,
Can be no other then auspicious chance.
V.
Since then by chance we either fall or stand,
And fortune plays with such a partial hand;
No heart of mine shall ere repine:
Nor will I guess unworthiness
The more in me to rest,
Though I conceive I am not blessed
With Princely honors, or a golden Chest.
31. A tear over Orania's Tomb.
I.
OH let me weep, weep out mine eyes
Upon the Tombstone where ^e lies
Embalmed and enshrined.
Let not my senses lead me home,
And leave Orania in the tomb.
Why should I stay behind?
II.
What hope have I of life or bliss,
Under so dire a fate as this?
What Is man without a heart?
There was but one 'twixt she and me,
And that away from me did flee,
When hence she did depart.
III.
And though the life of sense I kept,
'Twere better in the urn I slept;
For sleeping there, I rest.
And then my heart and I should be
Fomented in tranquillity;
And both for ever blessed.
32. A voyage to the Canaries; or the Sack-pilgrimage.
I.
Farewell false pleasures, vain delights;
Deluding stories, and bewitching glories.
Farewell false measures and false weights;
Farewell false glosses and false lights:
Farewell you Tory-rories;
But welcome Sack; for I will be
Engaged unto none but thee.
II.
Farewell you streamed cheeks of ore*
You rich attires, and you vain lovesick fires:
The world's a witch; beauty's a whore;
Cursed may he be that loves it more,
Or to its vein aspires,
My youthful rivals I resign,
And now go pilgrim to the Vine.
III.
Farewell you Castles, Towns, and Towers:
Farewell relations; and fare ye well fond fashion*
You moral rights, and formal powers,
Wherein I Have wasted many hours,
Be gone away in passion;
No aid at all from you I lack,
In this my pilgrimage of Sack.
IV.
Aureous and argent Mines avoid:
Be gone ye rubies, and also you great boobie,
In this your privy search employed.
Blinder then Cupid may the guide,
That still directs you, be.
What mettle, earthly or divine,
Is not ingendered by the Wine?
V.
Cuckolds farewell, and Cuckolds Curres:
Farewell trunk-breeches, and fare ye well long speeches;
Farewell you Lords, Dukes, Knights, and Sirs:
Farewell you dalliance and demurres,
Farewell you oaks and beeches.
I neither value man nor tree,
But such as in the Vineyard be.
VI.
Farewell Kings, Princes, Lords, and Popes:
Farewell false Latins, farewell deluded Satins:
Halters I Will change for Cable-ropes;
Embracing Stars and Horoscopes.
Farewell high heels and pattins.
Let no dull actor shame the stage;
The scene is a Sack-pilgrimage.
33. The Retreat.
I.
TEll me Tyresias, was it thou
Bewitched me unto Cupids bow?
Why should I hold this Deer in chase?
Or wrack my fancy on her face?
What hope is there to win the prize
That still refuses and denies?
II.
With weary labors night and day,
Early and late, through clods and clay,
In health and sickness, bliss and bale
I would her, but 't would not prevail.
My time, my coin and spirits too
I spent, but yet all would not do.
III.
I manacled each struggling thought,
And my aspiring soul I brought
Into subjection; and did spill
Full seas of tears to gain her will:
All this I did, and more; but yet
Her marble heart would not submit.
IV.
Therefore I will decline the suit,
And pluck up fancy by the root.
I Will bid my straggling heart go home,
And leave thee to the next that come.
But may I perish for my pain,
If ere I cringe to thee again.
34. Deformity.
GIve me the Maul of Hercules; the triple
Head of stern Cerberus: and (thou Disciple)
Grim Gueryon come, and bring thy furies here.
Up Hydra, up: Parca, do you appear;
Call up the damned deformities, and chase
Each rosy and each purple from the place.
Bring not loves arrows, nor the Idalian dart,
To gall my senses, or love-wound my heart:
But help, Oh help, I am beset about
With snakie-hair'd Medusa, and I doubt
I shall be frantic: Heaven grant me aid
To back my weakness, or I am betrayed.
Bless me! What eyes be these? what flaming sawcers?
What speech is this, more rustical then Chaucers?
What Tytian lump is here? what form? what fashion?
What monster in my breast would make invasion?
Jove shield me from't, and for succession-sake,
(With sinful Ixion) let me not mistake
A cloud for Juno, lest my heirs should be
Exceeding Centaurs in deformity.
Shield me, good Venus, from this ugly ghost.
Else I am ruined, and for ever lost,
Yet, if by force I must be thrown upon her,
(To save my reputation and my honor)
I will embrace her with a formal show
Of affectation: but (believe it you)
Those nuptial duties which from me should flow,
Shall be performed by I care not who.
Let Incubus the Nightmare be her mate,
Or he that loves to wallow in such fate:
But if no devil, nor no man will do it
For love, her lovely gold shall press them to it.
They shall be mercenary, I Will not scorn
With her own dowry to exalt my horn:
Although her body be deformed, and foul,
Her gold is fair, and may delight a soul.
Who then but fools (whom nature has controlled)
Would not incur the horn, to gripe the gold?
35. The true beauty.
I.
TEmpt not my thoughts with powdered hair,
With Satin, or with Lawn.
This cannot make a Lady fair,
Whose honor lies at pawn.
Bring not thy jewels unto me,
I neither value them nor thee.
II.
Look not so high though fortune please
Fairly to set thee forth;
Thy own ambition's thy disease,
And bridle of thy worth;
Thy beautie's blur'd, thy fame destroyed,
Thy honor's strangled in thy pride.
III.
It Is she that is fair, and only she,
Whose mind does not advance
With fate, above her pedigree;
That glories not in chance.
Whose beauty has more brightly shone
To others senses then her own.
IV.
Such is my Claria, she that holds
My heart within her breast:
Whose parallel, in Cupid's folds,
Or flocks, did never rest.
She whose ambitious smoke does smother,
Aspiring not above another.
V.
She whose own merits might transport
Her love beyond my case;
Is humbly pleased my flames to court,
And offerings to embrace.
With me she will laugh, with me she will sing,
With me she will do any thing.
VI.
She knows no scorn, she will not deny
Her lips at my request.
She nere saw me in misery,
But she would be oppressed.
Therefore my Claria, only thou
Must rule my soul and fortunes now.
36. Sept. 1655. The downfall of the black Boy, and the white Girl in Budge-row.
I.
COme lend a heart-destroying tear,
A sigh, a sob, a groan;
You Black-boy lads, that lately were
More radiant then the Sun,
You that did use to crown your pates
With Beer and Ale divine,
Come now, and curse your clouded fates,
As I have cursed mine.
II.
You sons of Cypria, that were wont
There to maintain your games;
That were devoted to the font
Where pleasure flows and flames;
Come mourn with me, and sadly cry,
The Black-boy is a going:
Which needs must be (infallibly)
To our eternal ruin.
III.
Ring out our sisters passing bell;
And let your tears increase:
Spin out your days in some dark Cell,
Where sorrow nere may cease.
What will you do? where will you rest?
And where will you repose?
Where will you find so fair a nest,
Where love and beauty grows?
IV.
There, when my money all was spent;
I went upon the score;
But now alas I must lament,
I shall do so no more.
Sweet Nan (whose soul and virtues are
For Princely thoughts a shrine)
O how unblest thy neighbors are
In this sad change of thine!
V.
Why would you leave us? What distaste
Did harbor in your mind?
How came your fancy over-cast?
Why were you so inclined?
The Black-boyes oil no more will flow,
His Cruce is all exhaust:
And he that there to drink does go,
His labor will be lost.
VI.
The black Boy, and the white Girl, both
Have lost their powers there:
Which story to unfold I Am loath;
Nor can without a tear.
Yet though Budge-row they have forsook,
And left that throne behind them,
All you that please for them to look,
In Abchurch-lane may find them.
37. The Soliloquie.
I
OH let me die; and to Elysium go.
Let me not languish in my woe.
What glorie's here
That Is permanent, or dear?
That may inchant a soul (with reason blessed)
To tarry in it, or take one minutes rest.
II.
Love is forgotten; and the world is grown
Like to the Smirnian Actor, who ('it is known)
When Heaven's name
Of The stage he did proclaim,
Would paint his finger on the earth: and there
Seem to set his affections, as it were.
III.
Society, the darling of delight,
That turned bale to bliss, made day of night,
Is quite destroyed
By avarice and pride.
Whereas our virtues had extent before,
Now each regards his own worth, and no more.
IV.
Oh let me then lay down my vernall head
Upon those groves prepared for the dead.
Good heaven grant
To death a Pursivant;
That he may bring me to the Stygian shore,
Where Charon with his boat may waft me ore.
V.
There shall I see my Doroclea's brow:
Which sight I Have lost, which loss brought me so low.
She, whose fair eyes
Might be a Princely prize.
She that loved true, and to maintain her vow,
Was forced to fly unto those fields below.
VI.
There shall I see her, there shall I enjoy her;
There will the gods give me a mansion by her;
Where with sweet kisses,
Smilings, and sweeter blisses,
We Will feast: and there (in spite of fate and foe)
We Will do those Orgies here we left to do.
VII.
There shall I see my brethren and my sires,
That warmed my fancy with Pierian fires,
That found my Muse
With buskined hose and shoes;
And such a spirit on my genius hurled,
That, for a mind free, I could change the world.
VIII.
There Ben would bid me welcome, and his mates,
Whose fruitful brains, and whose ingenious pates,
I Have crowned with bays
Of Sack, in former days.
I was their Ganymede, and they would be
As jovial as a Jupiter to me.
IX.
There should I reign, and bid a rush for Kings,
Popes, Lords and Princes, or such mighty things.
All high 'descents,
Grim looks, or Parliaments.
All care to gain, or fear to lose estates;
Guns, Pikes, or Pistols; Swords, or Counter-gates.
38. The Gender.
WHy should her beauty thus inchant
Poor me her woeful supplicant?
Why do I follow with a tear,
Her various steps? is she more dear
Then others are? What though she is cried
Up to be natures only pride.
That is no solid cause to summon
A choice affection, while she is common.
It Is true, she is both young and tender;
And she is of the female gender.
Were she but so, it would be well;
But more then this, she does excel:
For if the thing discussed be,
She Is common both to two and three;
Or if to number we must fall;
You Will find she is common unto all.
39. To the Nymph.
I.
COme, leave this dull retired life,
And now assume the name of wife
Ere i^ be more then time.
Why should that flower fall alone
That might be pulled by every one?
its glorie's now in prime.
II.
Hold not your beauty in suspense;
But in loves Innes of Courts commence
To be a Student fair,
With him that is resolved to be
Your unrelenting Votary,
While he is moved with air.
III.
Why startle you from man so much?
Despising him, whose every touch
Is the author of your blisses?
Why will you unto him allow
A sullen and tempestuous brow?
And formalize your kisses?
IV.
It Is man you ought to look upon
As the end of your perfection;
But if you die in scorn,
Your urn, your issue does compose
Heaven's abused: and you must lose
The end for which y' are born.
40. Her Reply.
I.
YEs, I could follow Cupid's tents;
But when I see such presidents
Of woe ingendered there,
I check my fancies, and recall
My looser resolutions all,
And sleck my flames with fear.
II.
What shall poor tempted Ladies do?
Into whose bosoms shall they throw
The Lotteries of their love?
When every moment we may see
How unresolved their servants be;
And how awry they move.
III.
Their fat professions are most free:
Phrases flow fast, of constancy,
Expression does excel.
Now their swift fancy flies as high
As Titan in the towering sky;
Then sinks as low as hell.
IV.
Bright as the taper of the night,
At first they do extend their light:
Exposing love enough.
And then become ere they have done,
More odious then comparison:
Their exit makes a snuff.
V.
Give me the solid Lover then,
That goes away and comes again;
And breaks no spousal vow:
That Is not by every smile ore-thrown,
Nor dashed aside by every frown,
Nor answers every bow.
VI.
If such invite me with his flame,
With equal heat I Will meet the same
Through every case and state,
To him my bosom I Will unlace;
His love and him I will embrace
In spite of foe or fate.
41. The Club.
COme my hearts and alter Cases,
Burnish all with Sack your faces.
Light the world with copper Noses,
Redder then the damask roses:
Or the torch held out by Hero.
Strike up voices: sing Fa-lero,
Since our lives can not be ever,
Short and sweet delights the liver.
Yesterday is past returning,
Quench your spirits from worldly burning:
Pine you not away with sorrow,
Nor be careful for to morrow:
Let your zealots take up quarters
In their Abbeys, and their Dorters.
We Will drive out the drousie summers
With renowned cups and rummers;
Shun Physicians, and their stories,
And despise their Purgatories.
Let Galen say what he pleases,
Sack will sink down all diseases:
Colic, Dropsy, Teeth or Ptisick;
There Is no such approved physic.
This is that the gods affected;
And for their own use selected.
This is that sets anguish flying,
Cheers the heart that lies a dying:
Rinces nature from distemper;
Invests each man in an empire.
Bids the Tailor draw his dagger,
And the slow-tongu'd Changeling swagger.
Here Is the cream of the Creation;
Here Is the habit most in fashion.
Foolish glory's but a bubble;
Riches may consume as stubble:
Hang the world, and save the Liquor;
Play about, and booz it quicker:
Here Is a health to him that is loyal
To the cup, and stands the trial
Of a vine-disburthening shower,
And makes Wine his only dowre.
That Is not with new follies lured
But drink healths to the quondam St --
42. The Stand.
I.
UNdone, Alas, undone,
My will my wisdom has outrun,
My roving soul has vainly wrought
A heinous crime, a grievous fau't,
In seeking where my folly sought.
II.
False zeal, how can it be
That fortune ere should favor thee?
When to good fortune thou have been
Unfavourable, what a sin
And sorrow, art thou plunged in?
The Return.
I.
THe weary footman having past
Ore many a hill, and many a dale:
Through many a storm and many a vale,
With full desire returns (at last)
Unto his native bed, and there
Sucks in his rest with full career.
II.
Recalling then into his mind
The horrid tempests he has known,
The Alpie grades that he has gone?
Then pleasantly he begins to find
The preeminence of that same place
Where first his life began the race.
III.
And having by experience found
No orb more dulcid then his own,
No soil so soft to tread upon;
He re-implants upon this ground,
And having well resolved, then
He Will die before he will leave't again.
IV.
Lady, my love's this traveller,
Its native Country is your Breast,
And there it found a native rest:
Till led by fancy, it did err:
And being galled by fancie's fraud,
It by all means would go abroad.
V.
Then out it went, and strayed about
In every hedge, and every hole;
And scanned the clifts of many a soul.
It peep't within, and spied without:
Making a serious inquisition
Through every region, and condition.
VI.
Some love I found, but thin and sad;
For every calm and gentle look,
That from my Mistress eyes I took,
Ten times ten thousand frowns I had:
Then did I sigh, and sighing say,
I will return to Claria.
VII.
There Is zeal refined, there is love enough;
There Is moral parts, and sacred grace;
There Is good conditions and good face;
There Is not a glance that is rough.
Then Claria open thou love's door;
And I will nere forsake thee more.
43. The Entertainment.
THalius the story thou have told,
Is Cupid's bow; and I can hold
In no repulse, the winged boy
Has quickly won the victory.
The willing prize it is thou do win;
The door is open, enter in.
44. Claria's Blot.
What Is amiable that my Claria needs?
Be it for feature, fortune, or for deeds,
Or charitable virtues: can you say
What is defective in my Claria?
Survey her beauty, read the story ore
Of her chaste life; go open every door.
Thus having done, return again, and see
If ere you found a sweeter soul then she.
One that can dally soft, yet not degrade
From modesty; nor basely be betrayed.
One that loves honor, yet in each condition,
Is an antagonist unto ambition.
Whose tongue (more shrill then Philomels) may be
The Hieroglyphick of humility:
Whose garb's the emblem of a decent maid;
One that can trade with love, yet lust evade.
One that is courteous, yet does scorn to fall
Into a vein that is hypocritical.
One that is lovely, yet does still deny
To be apparent in each vulgar eye:
One that is nobly born; and yet is one
That scorns to call descent in question.
One that is fair, and yet performs the task
To veil her modest beauty with a mask.
Though many fortunes court her, yet they are
No props of pride; nor cited as a snare
To trap her lovers. Every thing she does,
Expresses virtue: liberally she flows
With wholesome counsel: she retains in store,
A hand for every work: for every sore
A proper Salve: she is a sure Physician
For every accident, and each condition.
But here is the main perfection that she lacks;
She (pays her rent, but) will not pay her tax.
Loves soldiers labor under Claria's ray;
But my Claria will allow no pay.
Ah Claria, Claria, if so be you would
Content your soldiers as (indeed) you should,
With smiles and kisses, and embraces too,
You Would nere want soldiers to contend for you.
But here is our woe, when we our arms erect,
And yet you will allow us no respect.
45. To the Venerean Cow-herd.
I.
FAll on, fall on, (fond Cow-herd) fall
And hold thy deer in chase.
The man that never moves at all,
Is always where he was.
He plays no play, the fencer knows,
That keeps his guard and makes no blows.
II.
Go armed with courage, and the sin
Of Cupid, and assault her.
At one essay I Would either win
The Mare or lose the halter.
It is no progress unto honor,
Only to stand and gaze upon her.
III.
It was not Alexanders wit,
To dally and delay:
For had he ever practiced it,
He had not born away
The worshipped wreath of fame, nor hurled
Reports of conquest ore the world.
IV.
Despair not thou at thy descent,
Nor the weakness of thy strength:
Though now she is flinty to relent,
She may grow soft at length.
Perpetual and accustomed knocks,
Will bruise and break the hardest rocks.
V.
What though the glistering lumps of fame
Upon her beauty strove?
Even such whose sparks might ye inflame,
Yet could not gain her love.
Hold thou thy course, and forward run,
A torch burns hotter then the sun.
VI.
The wanton Goats warm blood will part
The Diamond in two,
Which neither Vulcans fiery art
Or steell could ever do.
Some Girls choose rather swains in rags,
Then mighty Bashawes and their bags.
46. The shattered Heart.
I.
LOve put his bow into my hand,
Charged with a golden dart;
And gave, withal, a strict command
To shoot into thy heart.
Moreover unto me he said,
He would assist me with his aid.
II.
Now on the pile of this my dart
(As lovers use to do)
I fixed my own aspiring heart,
And then I shot at you.
And shooting hit your breast of flint,
But 'twas so hard it stuck not in it.
III.
My heart was shattered at this blow;
It fell so fierce thereon.
Thus seeking Claria's heart (I trow)
My own was overthrown.
And like a hawk that strikes beside
The game, my heart fell down and di'd.
47. The Jubilee.
I.
TEll me no more of Jubiles
Esteemed by the Jews;
Olympic games, and such as these,
Which ancient Rome did use:
And did destroy their cares upon
The racks of recreation.
II.
O tell me not of Turkish glories,
Great Mah'met and his pride.
Nor touch me with tyrannick stories,
How men for zeal have di'd
With an implicit faith; to prove
His blasphemy, and their blind love.
III.
All triumph humane thoughts require,
My Claria's breast does keep:
She warmes chill comfort by her fire,
And charms the gods to sleep:
What Roman, Turk, or Jew has found
Of bliss, in Claria does abound.
IV.
She is my Jubilee alone,
Lets captived thoughts go free;
Restoring joys doubt seized on,
To longed for liberty.
Here may I bath each wearied limb,
And in the pool of Beauty swim.
V.
Whose silver streams all griefs allay,
And make all torments light,
While I enjoy her smiles by day,
And sport with her at night,
What undigested thought shall rest
Within the angle of my breast?
VI.
Let pilgrims seek St. Peter's shrine,
And Saints, Saints rags adore,
I Will Idolize thy face divine,
For ever, ever more.
Let misers and their bags unite,
Thou art my treasure and delight.
VII.
Let they whose airy wills request
To blow ambitious bellows,
Lift up the Owl to the Eagles nest,
And sore above their fellows.
Yet while I graft upon thy stem,
I would not change my fate with them.
48. The Leveller.
I.
ALL mortal men are born to dye:
The earth is each man's mother.
O then my genius tell me why
One man's above another?
From dust we came,
And to the same
Our tribute's paid: then we resign our powers;
When death shall strike, we are no longer ours.
II.
Why then should one man be a Prince?
Another poor as Job?
One clad in Velvet to convince
Him that has scarce a robe?
Thus freedom's curbed,
And we disturbed.
Shall humane statutes gage our recreation?
The Law is void since Gospel came in fashion.
III.
Where all is alike, who should obey?
Or who should be attended?
Or who our failings shall repay,
Where all men have offended?
When Cain was tried
For fratricide,
It was his God condemned him, I assure ye,
No man was Judge, nor no man on the Jury.
IV.
Yet now our custome's grown so base,
That he whom fortune blesses,
Is pearcht on some commanding place,
Though he no reason guesses,
And then this man
Must pry and scan
Into my life, and if he finds an error,
His word shall be my bane, his frown my terror.
V.
Since then poor mortals must be led
By custom, not by reason,
One step awry I will not tread,
Then I shall know no treason.
They shall not see
One blot in me,
And then for pardon I Will not vex my senses:
He needs no mercy that has no offenses.
VI.
I Will not contrive with State-designes,
Nor squeeze my brains by thinking.
I Will press my grapes, and prune my vines,
And pass my time in drinking.
Then gallant soul
Fill up the boul,
Whilst full-grown Bacchus blows delightful bellows,
And here is a health to all true hearted fellows.
49. Thorando and Clara.
Thorando. I Prithee ( Clara) let me know
Whether thou love me, or no.

Clara. Love thee Thorando, prithee why?


Tho. Not for my wealth, but loyalty.


Cla. She that loves all that Loyal be,
Must love whole Myriads more then thee;
And then how feeble are those rays
That branch into so many ways?
One of the which I yield to you,
Because I think your story true.

Thorando. Alas, alas, such love as this
Will not boy up a lovers bliss;
There is a love like Juniper,
Which loyal Cupid does confer
In Ladies breasts, and it is such
As burns the heart at every touch.
And when we are thus heated, then
This Juniper cools us again.
Such is the love that I would have:
Such is the love that Hero gave
Unto Leander, and beside,
In the same faith she lived, she di'd.
Such is the love as goes alone:
And only shoots her darts at one.
Such is the love as ought to be
Adored for monopoly.
Oh! tell me then, and let me know
Whether thou love Thorando so?

Clara. Me thinks I feel my sparks begin,
To sieze upon my soul within:
But they are feeble, and I doubt,
For want of breath, they will go out.

Tho. Oh! fear not Clara; I will blow
Loves bellows, and will make them grow:
Thy smoking spirits I will rouse
With kisses, glances, and my Vows.
Then from his budget he did pull
His lusty bellows, fraighted full.
And on her sparks he blew so fast,
That all became on fire at last.
And ere from thence he could retreat,
His bellows were consumed with heat.

50. Forced Love.
I.
O Do not urge me with an idle tone,
For my resolved thoughts to own
What my fixed fancie'd not embrace,
Were a preposterous thing:
I can not cling
The^e, where affection will not interlace.
II.
Forced love is fretfull, and a heart thus snared
Against its will, proves afterward
Irregular, and will not stay
In its own sphere, but glides
On other sides
With crooked motions; and will not obey.
III.
The toil is tedious; and to her that will
Only pretend love, to fulfill
A disposition; must endure
A soul-offending curse,
And sorrows worse,
Because she is branded with a love impure.
IV.
Then call thy fancy from the intended scope;
Thy labor's void; in vain thy hope.
No talent here thou can improve.
I have no art to shroud
Love in a cloud.
And where I can not, there I will not love.
51. To Thraso.
SIlence, (bold Thraso) let our wits alone,
They are no theams to whet thy follies on.
Cease Mongrill, cease thy vanity: 'twere fitter
Thou should be howling in the currish litter
Of thy own whelps: where with a doggish look,
Thou might be poring on the Parish-book
Of Ignorance, and never dare to spy
Into our Casket with an envious eye.
Rail not at rimes, lest Poetry become
Thy bane, and bring thee to a dunghill tomb
Of infamy. Poor worm, how dare thou follow
The Peers and Chaplains of the great Apollo,
With snarling, whining voice? Can thou not tell
Their genii are beyond a parallel?
We scorn equality, tell me what powers
Are known to man, that we account not ours?
Who can exceed us? who can go beyond us?
Where Is he that dares assault us? or command us?
We vie with gods, (then let not men disclaim us)
It Is they make men, and we that make them famous,
It Is we that lift up to the stars; and there
We file the records of their praise, and rear
A ruined progeny, and do translate
The feeble rags of a declining fate,
Into new suits of dignity, and then
With as much ease we can pull down again
Their high flown fame, and cut their glory short,
If once we but conceive a reason for it.
Then cease (I say) and do not thou assail
To strive against the strength, that will prevail
Above thy perished power. Are not we
The pinnacles of Sovereignty?
To us Kings veil their bonnets; and confess
Our sacred blessings, and our worthiness
In all employments; it is we that tread^
Down every verbal foe, and daring head.
We are the parents of the gods: if we
Keep Poems dormant, where is the Deity?
Jove we invented, Mars and Bacchus too;
Then are we not their fathers? how think you?
Our Charter is divine, I Would have you know it,
No privilege to the Painter and the Poet.
It Is we that crush your vices; and that can
Conjure the fury of the proudest man
Into a shittle-cock. It Is we that rise
(With undepressed raptures) to the skies,
Triumphing there ore every snarling foe
That (in a currish humor) barks below.
Vain hopes then cease, or else Apollo must
(By the Organ-bellowes) blow thee unto dust:
We span the world, the Misers we defy,
Their gold's an eyesore to a Poets eye;
We scorn such dross. And he that shall subscribe
Unto the incantation of a bribe,
Is but Apollo's bastard, and must be
For ever branded with indignity.
We hiss down all his honor, and we hate him;
And from our covent excommunicate him,
He Is none of us: it is only such as find
An unsuppressed, uncontrolled mind,
Transcending fortune, with a face that charms
All grieving sorrows and afflicting harms;
That pines not in the study, nor contracts
His cheeks into live Mumma by his acts,
That over-looks small injuries; and still
Thinks puny-rogues unworthy of his quill.
52. Phorco amd Parlio.
1. Phorco. FAirer then beauty in her pomp descri'd,
Or Venus tried
Unto the third degree,
Is that Seraphick she,
That vows her love and constancy to me.

2 Parlio. Such splendour cannot but amate thy sense:
Such influence
Sure't cannot choose but cloy
All thy felicity;
And make thee make a footstool of thy Joy.

3. Phorco. O no it cannot, but her beauty brings
A pair of wings
To me, as to the flies
Gives Titan from the skies,
Whereby (as they do) I (poor I) arise.

4 Parlio. So, then it seems the art but a fly at best,
And here is the jest:
Until thy Mistress bring
(By her sweet beams) a wing,
The art but a cripl'd fly: Alas poor thing!

53. The Retired Lady.
I.
ANd why devoted to the Cave?
Is this the end?
The final end? has nature gave
You Gems to hide, and not extend?
Or (like Narcissus) are you bent
With your sweet self to complement?
II.
When you were born sure Nature meant
some other thing:
Whose meaning (by your discontent)
You Would peevishly to ruin bring.
The Sun does shine, the stars hold forth,
And so should you expose your worth.
III.
Why should a face whose magic may
weak souls recrute,
The vallons and the veils obey?
Or wherefore should that tongue be mute,
Whose harmony to mortal ears,
Sings high, and sweeter then the Spheres?
IV.
^uch, for her Countries welfare, came
into the earth.
Part of her best parts we may claim,
As truly forfeit at her birth;
Yet since forced boons are not so kind,
We Will beg your face, and virtuous mind.
V.
As did Medusa, by her eyes,
To stones convert
Each daring look; so thine surprise;
But it is not with Medusa's art.
As flesh to stones transformed she,
So stony hearts are broke by thee.
VI.
Thy sacred lips, where cherries grow,
Set round with spice,
Whence loves Electars freely flow;
Why in recesse constrained so nice?
Sure he shall die unblest that misses
The famous booty of your kisses.
VII.
Will thy bright beams be ere the less
For lightning me?
Or will it blur thy comeliness?
Or stigmatize thy dignity?
Then lie no longer in the Mines:
Diana's chaste, and yet she shines.
VIII.
Pray what avails Danae's tower?
Or what content
Is Couched in the golden shower,
While she receives imprisonment?
The life of beautie's by resort,
Not in the prison, but the Court.
IX.
Then bring thine Eastern cheeks abroad;
And hide no more
Those Gems each judgment would applaud,
And with a reverence adore.
So both your self and we in this
Shall have the greater share in bliss.
54. Loves outside.
I.
NO more of love, away,
Avoid fond Girl:
Seek not our wits to slay
Only with shells of pearl.
That was begotten of a lump of earth;
Spewed from corrupted bowels, so took birth.
II.
Shut up thy Magazeen
In velvet masks,
Leave not thy beauty seen:
Nor put fond thoughts to tasks;
For all the pleasures to our eyes you bring,
Are but loves wanton shadow, not the thing.
III.
What if thine ivory hand
(Which we adore)
I boldly durst command,
Ten thousand times and more,
To kiss, alas, what were it to suffice
The thirst of love? or quench the flames that rise?
III.
Nay could my license yet
More freely slip,
If Caelia would commit
The bounty of her lip
Unto my pleasure, there to play and sport,
All this is but the Lobby of Loves Court.
IV.
Or should my bended arms
Thy wast confine,
And thou (with equal charms)
Should lie impaling mine,
These cannot ravish; nor reside upon
A heart that presses at perfection.
V.
No fainting breath, no glance,
Nor leering smile,
Nor motion shall advance
My fancy; or beguile
A thought that is fixed, for I have tried the pain,
And am resolved I Will nere love so again.
55. To Caelia, in the fields.
WHy will thou go? (fair Caelia) why?
What Is needful, of importancy,
That can without thee, not be done?
Why will thou leave me all alone?
I have but seen thy face: as yet
We had no time to speak, nor sit.
Good Caelia stay, and do not lower,
Let Us couch in this Eglantine bower.
Behold the quavering sprigs, how they
Move almost in a sensual way,
With moral action, seeming too
Through invitations unto you.
Come, come, with folded arms, let us lie
In a proportioned symmetrie:
See you the birds in yonder tree,
How loving and how peart they be?
How they from sprig to sprig remove,
And with their bills decipher love?
Let me upon thy golden tresses,
And veins, (those Azure wildernesses)
Hop like these birds: and let my hand
Wander along thy unknown land,
To find how well the fruit does rise,
(As in Canaan Isreal's spies)
And if the same I do approve,
Therein I Will plant my vine of love:
And with a pleasant pain I Will frame
A fertile vineyard in the same.
Come, do not weep; 'twill do thee good:
It will refine corrupted blood.
Then struggle not, nor do not shriek,
I have no weapon that can strike
A deadly blow. 'Twill not disease thee
With greater wounds then what shall please thee.
See yon big-bellied ewe, that (late)
Received the marrow of her mate:
She looks most lovely; so will you
Now you receive your lovers too.
Then have at all, upon it I Will enter,
And plant my vine there at a venture.
56. Her Reply.
HE that nere drank was nere a dry:
And he that nere knew liberty,
Regards it not: and she that can
Not by experience say what is man,
Desires him not: but when she knows
What virtue from his nature flows,
She Is mad t'imbrace him, and does guess
His presence her best happiness.
Before I tried thee, I abhorred
Thy proffered love, and could afford
No wanton thought; but now I see
Thy spirits, and their energie;
My soul to thee I will resign,
There is no pleasure like thy vine.
'Twill make me fruitful, and I swear,
Plant thou always, I Will always bear.
And though this fruit too ponderous grow,
I Will gladly die in bearing so
57. The unequal Match.
ANd why unto this stump would you be ti'd,
That were so hopeful and so fair a bride?
How dull? how dead? how drowsy? and how cold
Are all your amplectations? and how old?
How crasie? crouched? and how feeble is
He that should surfeit you with Hymen's bliss?
Better you never had the smallest sense
Of love, then not in joy its influence.
What can expected be from him, whose head
Is fleeced with snow-bals; and imbattered
With sixty years assaults: whose breath affords
Him language but in groans, and not in words.
Pity, thrice pity, that so sweet a she
Should lose her teeming time, and barren be
For want of agriculture: what is the cause
You derogate so far from Cupid's laws?
And spoil his tenets? why should Gems that shine
Quite through the surface of your sacred Mine,
Perish for want of gathering? and decay
By wrong perusals in an unknown way?
58. Her Reply.
It Is true, he is aged, and therefore we bring
His well experienced years unto the thing:
In former times he did the work, and than
He was well known to be a knowing man.
And now he is worthy, though his office be
To digitate, and gravely to ore-see.
This makes him happy: (and in him my self
Bright shining in his lucubrated pelf)
What ever's planted by another sweat,
Dressed, pruned and watered by his wholesome heat,
Yields him the issue. Hence it then remains;
He has the profit, others take the pains;
And I the pleasure: no defect does come
For want of husbandry unto my womb.
Or, though he eyes me with a jealous care;
I Have time enough to horn him, and to spare.
Age is no watchman, but his eyes give ore
At five a clock in the even (or before)
T'incite the heart with jealousy: or see
The least attempt on his propriety.
His age-dry'd limbs dull Morpheus does confine,
While youthful Cupid is unfolding mine.
59. To the Academick.
THink not to daunt us with a daring eye,
The Maze of Logic, or maturity
Of your taught science, and entangled rules,
(The scum and dregs of Academick pools)
Boast not of these, nor strive with censure nice)
TO esteem your deer-bought wisdom by the price.
Think no excess you have; no power does dwell
In this accustomed way, to mak't excel.
This can create no wonder: we disclaim
All sorts of admiration at the same.
Who finds by seeking, a concealed treasure,
Pays equal pains for's profit and for's pleasure.
He has no novelty: he gains no more
Then what his fancy did expect before.
Is this a wonder if it is wisely viewed?
Or does it savor of beatitude?
He that is apprentice, though the veriest fool,
Does (by instruction) learn his Masters rule.
He keeps his folly still, although he is made
A skillful artist in his Masters trade;
He learned by teaching, hence it came about,
But he is ingenious gets the trade without.
Come then my spark: thou of the Oxonian race,
And let a word of reason interlace
With thy ambition. Grammar is thy sphere,
And thou can travel in no path but there:
That Is all thou have; why, thou have bookt it fair,
Thou can scarce tell us what the Morals are.
Thou, of Philosophy, no more have known
Then what tradition, and the books have shown.
Thou keepst the track, and only go by course.
And I must tell thee, that each Carriers horse
Performs thy task; and has as much to be
Adored for, or admired at, as thee.
The adventuring Merchant, that is wasted ore,
To seek for jewels on the Indian shore,
Is not so happy in his far-fetcht geer,
As he that stays at home and finds it here.
What think thou now? Says not th'impartial test,
That Art's but feeble? Nature is the best.
Suppose your fancy leads you unto court,
Perhaps you are able to speak Latin for it;
And now and then spew out a phrase of Greek;
But for invention you are far to seek.
You to the book must go if you would ken
The customs and Moralities of men.
We do not so; our method is divine;
We go by inspiration, nor by line.
And we can tell you in our modern tongue,
We know our right, and can revenge our wrong
Without your Edicts: we can work or play,
We do not value what the Schoolmen say.
But you grave wits, (where art and nature meet)
I humbly worship, and with reverence greet:
Because I know, where these united are,
The motion there will be more regular.
But you it is, against whom my Muse does rore,
That have been taught each science, and no more;
And of a little make as great a show,
As if your knowledge had no more to know.
60. The Drawer to his Lady.
I.
THe God of love to me is come,
And in my fancy flew;
And bids me seek Elysium
In nothing else but you.
The oracle has told me so,
My vine alone in you will grow.
II.
Then let your flames reflex again
On him, whose glory it is
To Court your eye-beams now and then,
And steal from you a kiss.
Let our two hearts move in one sphere;
And so we will the vineyard rear.
III.
The vines we will prune, the grapes we will press,
With secrecy and sport:
'Twill ask no toil, nor heaviness:
Taste, and you will thank me for it.
Come then, and with the Drawer close,
And see the juice that from him flows.
IV.
Apollo's Nectar is an Ass:
Nepenthe's nothing worth,
If matched with our Canary-glasse,
When love does set it forth,
Come then and with the Drawer join,
His love and liquor is divine.
V.
And if we see our labors yield
Issues and profits deep,
Thy Tun shall once a year be filled,
And we will a Tavern keep.
Good Lady then be pleased to shape
Your love unto the Drawers grape.
VI.
Your belly shall the Cellar be,
The upper room's your face;
Whose bright and painted bravery,
Who cannot but embrace?
Come then and with the Drawer mix,
And we will live by Mere-trix.
VII.
Thy legs are gallond-pots (my Deer,
I prithee do not blush)
The door of entrance, shall be where
Already hangs a bush.
Come then, and with the Drawer cling,
And see the profit of the thing.
VIII.
Thy folded arms shall be the Bar,
Thy nod shall be the Sign;
Thy words shall serve for Bells that are
In rooms to ring for Wine:
This done, I dare presume that we
Shall never out of custom be.
61. The Mystery.
I.
BEwitching Boy, how can it be
That gods and men should bow to thee?
Thou have a dart
Strikes many a heart.
And yet no Seeker ere could know,
Or how, or why it should be so
In love we live, in love we die;
But we conceive no reason why.
II.
This is a mystery that has ^in
Ere since the age the gods lived in.
Each age and sex
This ghost does vex:
Jove hurried on by Cupid, he
To gain the prize, a beast will be.
In love we live, etc.
III.
He Is changed unto a Bull, and so,
Europa must a bulling go;
And lest he miss
Soft Leda's kiss,
Or she should want dame Natures use,
He Will be a Swan, and she a Goose.
In love we live, in love we die,
But we conceive no reason why.
IV.
Neptune we rank among the rest,
As savouring grossly of the beast,
Before that he
Deprived will be
Of Theophanes love (his Dear)
A pair of Rams horns he will wear.
In love we live, etc.
V.
Why to hell did Orpheus go?
Hercules, and Aeneas too?
Did not it prove
To be for love?
But here is the thing that startles me,
What reason for such love may be.
In love we live, etc.
VI.
Some say it is beauty that injoynes
Our roving thoughts, and them confines.
But Jove I know
It is not so.
Our Mistresses deformed were,
Till love and Poems made them clear.
Then by this argument we prove,
Love creates beauty that not love.
VII.
Some tell us riches is the goad
That rules our fancy in this road:
My Genius cries
It Is otherwise:
'Cause with Quotidian eyes we see
Love practicing on poverty.
In love we live, etc.
VIII.
Some say its virtue we adore,
And wisely fall in love therefore:
But I forbear
To settle here,
'Cause Cyprian lads I Have seen rejoice
In the polluted arms of vice.
In love we live, etc.
IX.
No face, nor fate, nor virtues are,
Love's sole-illaqueating snare.
No cause can be
Found out by me,
Why for a she we take such pains,
We bruise our limbs, and break our brains:
Only in love we live and die,
But never know the reason why.
62. The Country Girl.
I.
AP-x on your Dames that scorch with their flames,
And fire us alive in the city:
I would they might go to the devil below;
For they are most wickedly witty.
II.
The Jewels they wear in their ears and their hair,
And their breasts that are open and naked,
Are as bills that are set on a house to be let,
And who ever pleases may take it.
III.
Their faces do shine like the Sun in the line:
God a mercy the colors they laid on.
But did you but see how ugly they be
When the are off, them you would be afraid on.
IV.
I am for the less that does piss on the grass,
Though the Courtiers unworthy esteem her:
She is pleasant and neat, and her carriage complete,
And her cheeks are as brown as a leemer.
V.
You freely may sip on her sanctified lip,
Although she be easily danted:
The snow on her brow did nature allow,
She Is neither perfumed nor painted.
VI.
She learns not to cheat in the School of deceit;
Her heart is dissolved in her speeches.
She scorns that while you the matter shall do,
One should run away with your breeches.
VII.
Her glances they be out of innocence,
Yet blow for blow she will give duly.
She gives you your fill, and lets you lie still;
For she scorns to be counted unruly.
63. Reproof.
O You enchanting fairest fair;
Whose powers more then Magic are,
Upon a mortal breast, forbear
For want of love, to slay me.
Let not one ray upon me light,
Unless affection you unite
With every aspect, beams so bright
Cannot but over sway me.
How could the Africans abide
To look upon Apollo's pride,
And to that fiery zone be ti'd
In toil exhausting sweat?
Did not Apollo's power extend,
Causing earths bowels to ascend;
And unto every native lend
His nourishment with heat?
Your beauty is this torrid flame,
Whose colors scorch where ere they came,
And brows with furrows do unframe
And galls me with despair.
But the Eglantine spicie grove,
That Is in your sacred breast and love,
Can mitigate that fire above,
And sunburned souls make fair.
Then shut those eyes of Juniper;
And let them not their heat transfer
To me your sad Idolater;
Unless you mean to love.
Or else beneath these beams I die,
You gain the guilt of tyranny;
And so impawn your dignity,
And grieve the gods above.
64. Bacchus.
I.
AND why such a drouth has infested my mouth?
Is my lip and the cup fallen asunder?
And do they intend nere to end
Their dissension? Oh it were a wonder
If I should fall out with so cordial a friend.
II.
Fill the boul, do not think I Will be bauk'd of my drink;
He that will, falls lower then folly:
I will liquor my brains, that my strains
May with triumph tread down melancholy:
And this will be freedom in fetters and chains.
III.
Had the fool Icarus laid his policy thus,
His wings (made of wax) had not melted;
But he well might have flown to the Zone
Whereto his desires ambitiously pelted:
And then his Catastrophe nere had been known.
IV.
Had the sack made him moist, he might have rejoyc't,
And sung his P-wit like a Plover:
But alas he fell short, and paid for it;
He was drowned in the sea, and he could not get over:
Thus 'twixt fire and water he spoiled the sport.
V.
Or if Phaeton in this method had gone;
Less harm he had done, and more wit he had learned.
Had he fixed his sack on the back
Of the Sun, sure the world it would never have burned,
Nor he and his credit endured the wrack.
VI.
Take a soul that is sous't in the Sack he caroust,
He has wings that advance at his pleasure:
He Is endowed with a mind drives the wind,
And vaults ore the floods of affliction at pleasure;
His heart in a dungeon is never confined.
VII.
Take a man in his wine, he is for any design;
He looks in the face of the proudest employment:
And his will does not roave, nor remove
The greatest of Princes has no such enjoyment*
He dwells where the Deity rests above.
VIII.
He defies the base fear of a Parliamenteer,
And scorneth the frowns of the high man:
All his care is, to think on his drink;
And smilingly bids a pox on the dry man
That wastes in his cell, and consumes with his chink.
IX.
Then again fill the boul, let it merrily troul:
Play out with your Rummikins quicker,
Let the cares of the world, all be hurled
In your cups, and be drowned in your liquor,
And drink till your noses with rubies are pearl'd.
X.
Let it fall to your lot to be plunged in the pot;
And suffer your brains to be sacked with drinking;
From the merry merry glass do not pass,
You Will find it is better, if weighed in your thinking,
Then for to be sacked as Jerusalem was.
65. The Rejection.
I.
ALL in vain turn again,
Why should I love 'r?
Since she can love no man,
I will give over,
I Will not stay to obey,
But will retire.
Why should I thither sly,
And not enjoy her?
II.
Let her still please her will
With a denial:
She shall be unto me
As the Sun-diall.
Let her blood raise the mud:
All in good season.
I Will not gaze on her face
Till I have reason.
66. Loves Arrant.
I.
Arm Cupid, arm:
Gird on thy quiver, take thy bow
And numbly go
And seek a she that thou may charm.
Fly thou into the myrtle grove,
And there shoot down some pretty dove.
II.
For I am flush,
Big-belli'd with desire to prove
The pain of love,
And feel the Sunshine of a blush.
Yet will I not engage in heart,
Unless the object have desert.
III.
Go then and seek
Some glorious brow, some sacred eye,
From whence does fly
Rays all divine, some rosy cheek,
Wherein such lively grace is carved,
As may recall a spirit starved.
IV.
Shoot such a heart
As innocence does control:
Pierce such a soul
That loves in love, and not in art.
Such, if she finds my love divine,
Melts all her pleasures into mine.
V.
Bring not the coy,
That starts and kicks at every touch;
There Is grace too much,
She has more zeal then honesty.
Bring not the proud deformed witches,
That missing rocks, fall down in ditches.
VI.
Bring not the sad
That seem to thaw the stones with tears,
Wherein appears
Some Crocodilish blood they had.
Nor shoot thou down a fawning she,
Lest with her smiles she ruin me.
VII.
But bring a girl
Whose mirth is of a heavenly dress;
Whose wantonness
Is not a pick-lock, but a pearl;
That will no common trader be,
Though sh' has a good commodity.
67. The evil Temper.
Always sighing, always pining,
Always out of frame;
Always puling, always whining;
Evermore the same.
Always filled with lamentation;
Love is not feasted so:
Continual tears, continual passion
Is but continual woe.
I hold her temper in derision,
Since she is guided thus,
Depart from me with expedition,
And hug Heraclitus.
If ere I dally with a lover,
I Will have a pleasant she,
That with a cheerful smile blows over
The proudest injury.
It Is vain to mourn for sliding bliss
That is already gone;
And full as vain, as vain it is
With tears to think upon
Approaching woes; hereby they creep
Up to more ample sums:
It Is time enough for thee to weep
For mischief when it comes.
And since thy weeping will not aid
Thee of the smallest thrall,
When ere thy sorrows thee invade,
Thou need'st not weep at all.
Remember this, and then repent,
And sweetly thou shall find
The peaceful Phoenix of content
Will build within thy mind;
And then I could my soul allow
To thee (my dearest dear)
But when I see a stormy brow,
I think the Devil's there.
EPIGRAMS.
1. Humility.
In The petty Fourm this Lady sits,
Learns innocence more then wits:
Reads duty-lectures to her sons;
Bid her but go, and straight she rune.
Poor she at all times, and all places,
Waits (servant-like) upon the Graces.
She owns her self most vile and base;
Yet her descent's the Royal race.
2. The Misers music.
CHink chink the coin cries, and the music pleases,
It Is like the dainty food that breeds diseases:
It Is sweet and bitter, like the Siren charms,
Lulls us to love first, then leaves us in harms.
3. The Blush.
See thou the tincture in her face?
It is the servant to her grace,
To intimate to thee there is naught
That Is vicious harbored in her thought,
And does from Cyprian boys exempt her
Dazzling the foul lascivious tempter.
4. A Tailor.
THere was a Tailor once a dagger wore:
He wore it once, and never wore it more.
He would have drawn and run it at my Bitch,
I, but his heart would not go thorough stitch.
5. To Nell.
FOnd, fickle, frantic fancy, full of folly;
Thy mirth is turned into melancholy.
Thou swear'st thou will be wiser, and wilt hate
Thy former vices, but it is too late.
The Steed is stolen, and now thou shut'st the door;
But lo, thou should have locked it heretofore.
6. On Jack.
JAck calls me rogue. My friend to me affords
This sage advice, I pray lay hold on's words.
Pish, pish, said I, it is better ten to one,
To hold his ears, and let his words alone.
Then by and by, (as it did well appear)
I loosed his words, and lug'd him by the ear.
7. A Sigh.
SIghing she smiled, and smiling sigh't.
She smiled to see the thing she liked,
And sigh't because she could not get
It fast into her cabbinet.
Had but her smiles a power, as well
To draw, as do her sighs repel,
She might be mistress of the pray;
But sighing she blows all away.
8. Love.
THey say that love is always blind:
I think (upon my soul)
It is not true, because I find
He always hits the hole.
9. Sim.
SIm says he is highly blessed, because he looks
Upon abundance of religious Books.
It Is true, he does so; yet he keeps his sin;
He looks upon them, but nere looks within.
10. Lucia.
SWeet Mistress Lucia is a pretty thing:
A Concubine that is worthy of a King:
She is so full of beauty, and so fine,
You Would think she were a spirit all divine.
I Would swear the same, too, and to the world I Would tel't,
But that in truth I know she may be felt.
11. A Token.
It Is not of custom that my Present comes:
Nor yet with flattering, to enhaunce the sums
Of drossie lucre. Neither does it move
On legs, as though it came to buy your love:
For that were too ignoble to prevail;
Your love's a thing not to be set at sale.
But hence it comes, with supposed voice,
To speak for him, whose speech is somewhat nice;
Whose timorous spirit hardly dares to show
The tenure of that love I bear to you.
Hence then, accept it, only as a sign
Of his affection, who in heart is thine.
12. A lock of Hair.
WHy should we do it upon such things as these?
What is it they afford us that can please
A lovesick passion? or assuage the pain
Of a disordered and distempered brain?
Has it a privilege that is more then these?
Only to say it is our Mistresses.
Poor feeble prize, no author of content:
What honor rises from an excrement?
I, but I find a higher exposition:
An Allegory, which on no condition,
May be omitted for the good of either;
It is a lock that locks two hearts together.
13. Loves gain.
LOve is a stock of money: and it is he
That loves, that puts it out to usury.
And it is the smile of Mistresses, (in jest)
And wanton dalliance makes the interest.
But woe is me, infatuate with pain:
I find my stock begets me little gain;
For, whereas others (backney-like) get store,
Mine brings me nil per centum, and no more.
14. Torio.
TOorio's in love, and greatly does rejoice,
'Cause he has lighted on so brave a choice:
Yet with my curious eye I can discover
In her, no beauty that may tice a lover.
But I imagine why my Torio brags;
She Is precious not for beauty, but for bags.
15. Phorcus.
PHorcus, one morning (and that is rare)
Upon his bent knees went to prayer:
Prayed for remission of his sins;
And that same morning broke his shins.
A sad mischance it was, therefore
He vows to God he will pray no more.
16. To the Executioner.
JErvis the Hangman, when to him I quaffe,
He cries, Your servant sir, it makes me laugh:
But yet infaith I plainly tell thee Jervis,
I love thee well, but I abhor thy service.
17. Thraso.
IN canting vessels, I have ever found
The empty Hogshead yields the greatest sound.
And hence it follows, that thy lofty strains
Are but the symptoms of thy empty brains.
18. Gnatho.
GNatho (whose Muse is not so clear as common)
Pins his Encomion on a Gentlewoman.
He at the head begins, and thence does greet
Each member, till he comes unto the feet;
Only the neck he scapes: I fain would know,
Why on that part no verse he will bestow.
I smell the plot, it is worthy of your laughter;
He keeps the Neck-verse for himself hereafter.
19. Nell.
NEll's very sick, and to the Cooks will go;
(Sure sickness cannot be repelled so)
He fills the board with custard, and with pie:
And bids her eat, but she cries, No, not I.
She longs for rolls, and though it be a sin,
She will have none but the cooks rolling-pin.
20. Pigmalion.
WHy does Pigmalion on his picture dote?
And to the worship of the same devote
His purest thought? Pigmalion, do thou see
More value in thy image then in thee?
That thou should buckle, and incline thy wit
To leave thy self, and fall in love with it?
Alas Pigmalion, thou art but an Ape,
That for the substance do adore the shape.
21. Momus.
MOmus perhaps thou't say I am unkind,
Because I do not write to thee my mind.
I tell thee Momus, thou art grown so naught,
That I cannot allow thee one good thought.
Yet this my custom shall for ever be,
When ere I want a fool, I Will send for thee.
The Conclusion: Or the Fornicator's farewell on his Deathbed.
I.
COme you fair eyes, that with inflamed lust
I once beheld;
See you my judgment, sad and just.
For now (alas) I am compelled
To hang my head, as 'twere half dead,
Ah me! to the grave I must.
II.
And there my filthy carcass must remain,
Till the loud trump
Ring heaven-knells throughout my brain,
Giving new life to my dead lump:
And re-inspires, with active fires,
My empty pores again.
III.
Then weep one tear or two before I die,
And must be gone.
You can attest, as well as I,
What cruel wrong to me y' have done.
And now y' have kend my fatal end,
Seek you the same to shun.
FINIS.
