CUPID's REVENGE.
Or, An Account of a KING, who slighted all Women, and at length was forced to
marry a BEGGAR.


A King once reigned beyond the Seas,
As we in ancient Stories find,
Whom no Face could ever please,
He cared not for Womankind.
He despised the fairest Beauties,
And the greatest Fortunes too;
At length he married to a Beggar.
See what Cupid's Darts can do!
The blinded Boy, that shoots so trim,
Did to his Closet-window steal;
Then drew a Dart, and shot at him,
And made him soon his Power feel.
He that never cared for Woman,
But did Females ever hate,
At length was smitten, wounded, swooned,
For a Beggar at his Gate.
For, mark what happened on a Day,
As he looked from his Window high,
He spied a Beggar all in gray,
With two more in her Company.
She his Fancy soon enflamed,
And his Heart was grieved sore,
Must I have her, court her, crave her?
I, that never loved before!
This noble Prince of high Renown,
Did to his Chamber strait repair,
And on his Couch he laid him down,
Oppressed with lovesick Grief and Care.
Never was Monarch so surprised:
Here I lie a Captive Slave!
But I Will to her, court her, woo her,
She must heal the Wound she gave.
Then to his Palace-gate he goes:
The Beggars craved his Charity.
A Purse of Gold to them he throws:
With Thankfulness away they fly.
But the King he called her to him,
Though she was but poor and mean.
His Hand did hold her, while he told her,
She should be his stately Queen.
At this she blushed Scarlet-red,
And on this mighty King did gaze:
Then turned again as pale as Lead.
Alas! she was in such Amaze.
Hand-in-hand they walked together,
And the King did kindly say,
He Would respect her: -- Strait they decked her
In most sumptuous rich Array.
He did appoint the Wedding Day,
And likewise then commanded strait,
The noble Lords and Ladies gay,
Upon his gracious Queen should wait,
She appeared a splendid Beauty;
All the Court did her adore:
And in Marriage, with a Carriage,
As if she had been a Queen before.
Her Fame through all the Realm did ring,
Although she came of Parents poor. --
She by her Sovereign Lord the King
Did bear one Son, and eke no more.
All the Nobles were well pleased,
And the Ladies frank and free.
For her Behavior always gave her
A Title to her Dignity.
At length the King and Queen were laid
Together in a silent Tomb.
Their royal Son the Scepter swayed,
Who governed in his Father's Room.
Long in Glory did he flourish,
Wealth and Honor to increase;
Still possessing such a Blessing
That he lived and reigned in Peace.
