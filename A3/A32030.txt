HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE

BY THE KING.
A Proclamation concerning some illegal Warrants lately issued into several
places in Our Counties of Buckingham and Bedford, and other Counties, under the
name of the Earl of Essex, or by his pretended Authority.
WE have lately seen some Warrants sent abroad under the name of Robert Earl
of Essex now in actual and open Rebellion against Us, and under the names of
Sr Peter Temple, Sr William Andrews, Thomas Terrell, and others, who aid and
assist the said Earl in his Rebellion, commanding diverse Inhabitants of those
Counties to send in Horses, Arms, Uictualls, and Money, toward the
maintenance of the Army raised under the Command of the said Earl against Us,
and intimating that if those to whom those Warrants are directed, shall refuse
to obey the same, they shall be reputed as Enemies to their Country, and be
proceeded against accordingly. We wonder that any should be so bold, as to make
such Warrants and publish them, they being utterly illegal and Traiterous; We
shall wonder if any shall be so weak to be seduced by such Impostures, as to
lay aside their Duty and Alleagiance to their King, for fear to displease
those who casting away the fear of God and men, are in Rebellion against their
Sovereign. But least any should be seduced, and hoping that some may beware
of, and so avoid the danger they may suddenly fall into, in yielding to these
to illegal Commands, and so become partakers in the Crimes, and run into the
danger of the forfeitures which attend them, We have thought it fit to
declare, and We do hereby publish and declare, That whosoever shall seduce
others, or suffer themselves to be seduced in giving obedience to any such
Warrants, Commands, or Persuasions, that they do thereby incur the Crime of
High Treason, as ayders, and assistants to those Rebels, and must expect to
undergo the penalties and forfeitures justly due for the same.

Given under Our Sign Manual at Our Court at Oxford, this seventh day of
June, in the nineteeth year of Our Reign.
God Save the KING.
