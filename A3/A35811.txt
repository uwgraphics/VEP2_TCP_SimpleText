THE DEVONSHIRE BALLAD.
To the Tune of 1642.
NOw all old Cavaliers now or never stand to it;
The Synod dissolved, and the Ball's at your foot,
But if Faction prevail, you're destroyed branch and root
Branch and Root.
Jack Presbyter's Agents are busy it is clear,
To advance dame M. over the shire,
For her Knight. does under Covert also appear,
appear.
Vous Avez Tom R. a Zealot of note,
Who for factious Meetings the Statute does quote,
Whiles Conscience cries, Dog you lie in your throat,
your Throat.
Enter impudent D. I do thee no wrong,
A very fit Priest to lead Knaves along,
For he will sell his Mother Church for a Song,
A Song.
The Knights Steward M. Chap. comes next,
At whom the Tenants are damnably vexed,
Because he handles them worse than his Text,
His Text.
In querpo he walks the streets of the Town,
Not so fit for a Priest, as a Cassock and Gown,
Yet the proper garb for the son of a Clown,
A Clown.
Vous Aves J. H. a very good Reason,
An old Rebel Knave, the critical season
For the safe plotting and acting of Treason,
of Treason.
D. D. V. L. the Loyalists guess
For the Devils palate an excellent Mess,
No Cook like the Hangman such Victuals can dress,
can Dress.
Sir W. M. comes next in the way,
If you dislike him take Chidley I pray;
There must be a Fool as well as a Knave in the Play,
The Play.
It Is beneath me to speak of the rest of the Cattle,
Who proudly do bid God's Anointed to Battle;
I hope Charles the Second will give them a Rattle,
A Rattle.
Amen.
What the Priests Gospel call,
Does not move us at all;
We Commons will have the Dominion,
What of old Saint Paul wrote
Of Subjection we Vote
To be only one Doctors opinion.
Since James does not merit
After Charles to inherit,
But hates the new Saints Reformation;
We Will be ruled by the Devil,
And do what is Evil,
That good may thence come to the Nation.
We are taught by old Peter
To submit, but it is sweeter
To rule as his Successors tell us,
Let Charles and State groan
We Will give Laws to the Throne;
At least be his Majesty's Fellows.
What Is great Charles unto us,
If he let James undo us,
We owe him no longer subjection,
Than he does afford
The use of his sword,
And appears for our protection.
Let him lay York aside,
Let Jack Presbyter ride,
It Is the only way for to please us;
Then to him we will be true
As the treacherous Jew
To the innocent Sovereign Jesus.
Then 'twill quickly appear,
That we value Tangier,
And he need not to make any Motion
On that score again;
For money or men
All we have is at his Devotion.
