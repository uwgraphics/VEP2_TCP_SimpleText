BY THE KING.

A Proclamation concerning His Majesty's NAVY.
WHEREAS We by Our Gracious Proclamation, bearing date the tenth of November
now last past, freely offered Our Grace, Favor, and Pardon to all Seamen,
Sailers, Mariners and other Watermen, who having been formerly seduced by some
Traitorous and Seditious Persons, were this last year used as Instruments, to
detain Our Ships from Us; yet under this Proviso nevertheless, that they did
speedily return to their Obedience and Loyalty, and did not from thenceforth
presume to serve in any of Our ships detained from Us, or otherwise to serve
against Us by Sea or Land, or by Loan, Contribution, or otherwise to assist
the Army raised against Us, or to Assemble or Muster themselves in Arms,
without authority derived from Us, or enter into any Oath of Association, for
opposing Us or Our Army, as by the said Proclamation more at large may appear.
And whereas afterward, We by another Proclamation, bearing date the tenth of
February now last past, did again admonish all Our Subjects of the quality
before mentioned, and also all Our Officers, Victuallers and Servants of all
sorts belonging to Our Ships or Navy, that they should from thenceforth,
forbear to intermeddle in the Graving, Rigging Furnishing, Manning, or Serving
of, or in Our ships, by the direction of Robert Earl of Warwick, or any other,
without Our special direction and Warrant, upon the pains, in the said last
Proclamation mentioned, as by that Proclamation it may also at large appear.
And whereas We have bin informed, that some wicked and seditious Persons
intending to seduce Our good Subjects, and with false-hoods to abuse them, that
they not knowing the truth, might still be misled (as formerly they have been)
to serve the Wicked designs, and Treasonable practices of such as are in
Rebellion against Us, have given out and published, That whatsoever is intended
for the preparation and setting out of the Navy in the Spring now approaching,
is done by Our special direction and express Warrant, which is utterly false,
We not having any purpose or reason to trust our Navy, or any of Our Ships in
their hands and power who have given so clear a testimony of their former
disloyalty unto Us, and of their endeavors to destroy Us and Our Kingdom: We
do therefore hereby Publish and declare, That we have not given, nor do
intend to give any such command, direction or consent, that any of Our Ships,
or any other Ships of this Our Kingdom, shall be Prepared, Victualled, Rigged,
Manned, or set to Sea, by, or under the Command or Conduct of the Earl of
Warwick, or any other Person or Persons whatsoever, by any pretended authority
from one or both the Houses of Parliament, without and against Our consent and
express Command. And We do further give notice hereby to all Our Subjects,
whom it may any ways concern, that as We are and ever shall be careful to
the utmost of Our Power to protect Our Good Subjects from the Malice of Ours
and their Enemies, either at home or abroad, and to that end shall use all the
just means We possibly can to restore them to their former Peace, whereby they
may enjoy the comfort of the true Protestant Religion in the integrity thereof,
the Freedom of the known Laws, the Liberty of their Persons, and Propriety of
their Estates, and just privileges of Parliament, whatsoever is maliciously
and slanderously suggested to the contrary, so We will by the due course of
Law, vindicate Our Honor with a just indignation against and upon all those
who from henceforth, after so many gracious admonitions and offer of Free
Pardon for what is past, (which We do now again graciously and freely renew)
shall wilfully and maliciously presume to give assistance in any thing to the
said Earl of Warwick, or any other, who upon any specious, but false
pretenses, shall endeavor in this year now ensuing, to Prepare, Rigge up,
Victual, Furnish, Manne, or set forth any of Our own Ships, or any other
Ships of War, appertaining to any others, without Our Warrant under Our
hand and Seal; We being well assured, that under the pretense of making a
defense for the Kingdom against some imaginary foreign Enemy (where in truth
We know not of, or have cause to suspect any such) the purpose of the Contriver
of these Rebellious Actions, is manifest to be in the first place wickedly and
traitorously to convert Our Navy, and the Navy of the Kingdom to the
destruction of Us and of Our Crown, and good Subjects, and to make themselves
Masters thereof, if they can therein prevail (as We hope by Gods blessing they
shall not) and if they prevail not, then by the Convoy of those Ships to
convey themselves and those who go with them into some foreign parts, with a
purpose that neither themselves nor those who serve them shall return to their
native Country, to whom they have been so professed Enemies, and by this means
to rob the Kingdom of the Shipping which is the defense thereof; And that these
are the undoubted intentions, if the former Acts of Hostility against Us
performed the last year, by some of those Ships set out under the name of the
said Earl, and by the authority of the two Houses of Parliament, were not
sufficient to satisfy Us and all others, The late barbarous Actions of, and by
some of those Ships, within a very few days now past at Burlington Bay in Our
County of York, to the hazard of the life of Our dearest Consort the Queen,
at the time of Her landing there (if God in his great mercy had not protected
and delivered Her) not casually but purposely committed, will give sufficient
testimony thereof to all the World, to the perpetual shame of the Actors and
Abettors thereof, For which in due time they must expect their just reward.

Given at Our Court at OXFORD, the sixth day of March, in the eighteenth year
of Our Reign. 1642.
