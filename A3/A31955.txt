HIS MAJESTY'S Letter to the Gentry of Yorkshire,
MAY, the sixteenth, 1642. To our right trusty and well beloved the Gentry of
York, and others of this our County of York, whom it does or may concern.
WE have with great contentment considered your dutiful and affectionate
Answer to our Proposition concerning the unsufferable affront which we received
at Hull; We have not been deceived in that confidence we had in your
affection, wherefore we desire you to assure the rest of your Countrymen, who
through negligence were omitted to be summoned: that We shall never abuse your
love by any power where with God shall enable us to the least violation of the
least of your Liberties, or the diminution of those Immunities which We have
granted you this Parliament, though they be beyond the Acts of most (if not
all) Our Predecessors; being resolved with a constant and firm resolution to
have the Law of this Land duly observed, and shall endeavor only so to
preserve Our just Royal Rights, as may enable us to protect our Kingdom and
people, according to the ancient Honors of the Kings of England, and according
to the trust which by the law of God and this land is put into the Crown,
being sufficiently warned by the late affront at Hull, not to transfer the
same out of our power, concerning which Affront we will take sometime to
Advise, which way we may usefully employ your affections, In the mean time we
shall take it well from all such as shall personally attend us, so followed and
provided, as they shall think fit for the better safety of our person, because
we know not what sudden violence, or affront may be offered unto us, having
lately received such an actual testimony of rebellious intentions as Sir John
Hotham has expressed at Hull: Being thus secured by your affections and
assistance, we promise you our protection against: any contrary power
whatsoever, And that you shall not be molested for your humble and modest
Petition, as of late you have been threatened.

Given at Our Court at York, May the 16, 1642.
