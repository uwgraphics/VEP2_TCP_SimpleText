THE PROLOGUE.
WHo says the Times do Learning disallow?
It Is false: 'Twas never honored more then now.
When you appear (great Prince) the Night is done,
You are our Morning Star; shall be our Sun.
But our Scean's London now, and by the Rout
We perish, if the Roundheads be about.
For now no Ornament, the head must wear
No Bays, no Myter, scarce so much as hair*
How can a Play pass safely? when we know
Cheap Side Cross falls, for making but a show.
Our only hope is this, that (it may be)
A Play may pass, 'twas made ex tempore.
Though other Arts poor and neglected grow,
They Will admit Poesy, which was ever so.
But we contemn the fury of these days,
And scorn as much their Censure, as their praise.
Our Muse (blessed Sir) does now on you rely,
'Twould gladly live; but not refuse to die.
Accept our hearty zeal, a thing that's played
Ear't was a play, and acted ere it was made:
Our Ignorance, but our duty too we show,
I would all ignorant people would do so.
At other times expect our wit or Art,
The Comedy is acted by the heart.
THE EPILOGVE.
THe Play great Sir, is done, it needs must fear,
Though you brought all your mercies here*
It may offend your Highness, we have now
Three hours done Treason here for ought we know;
But power your Grace, can above Nature give,
I, can give power to make Abortives live.
In which if our bold wishes should be crossed,
It Is but the life of one poor week that is lost:
Though it should fall beneath your potent scorn,
Scarce can it dye more quickly then it was born*
The Echo.
NOw Echo on what is Religion grounded?
Roundhead.
Whose its Professor most considerable?
Rabble.
How do these prove themselves to be the godly?
Odly.
But they in life are known to be the Holy,
O lie.
Who are these Preachers Men, or Women-Common?
Common.
Come they from any University?
City.
Do they not Learning from their Doctrine sever?
Ever.
Yet they pretend that they do edify,
O fie.
What do you call it then? to fructify:
I.
What Church have they, and what Pulpits?
Pits.
But now in Chambers the Conventickle,
Tickle.
The godly Sisters shrewdly are belyed,
Bellied.
The godly number then will soon transcend,
End.
As for the Temples they with zeal embrace them,
Race them.
What do they make of Bishops Hierarchy?
Archie.
Are Crosses, Images Ornament, their scandal.
All.
Nor will they leave us any Ceremonies?
Moneys.
Must even Religion down for satisfaction?
Faction.
How stand they affected to the government Civil?
Evil.
But to the King, they say they are most Loyal,
Lie all.
Then God keep King and State, from these same men.
AMEN.
