A COPY Of a LETTER of Mr. COTTON of Boston, in an Answer of certain
Objections made against their Discipline and Orders there, directed to a FRIEND.
With the Questions put to such as are Admitted to the Church Fellowship and
the COVENANT it self.
THere have been things (as it seems) reported unto you;

First, that we receive none into our Church Fellowship until they first
disclaim their Churches in England as no Churches, but as limbs of the devil;
now, I answer, God forbid, God forbid: It is true, one Sheba of ^ukry blew a
Trumpet of such a ^^^^tious Separation; I mean, one Mr. Williams late T^^c^^r
of Salem, but himself and others that followed ^^st^^y in that way, who were
all excommunicated out of the Church and banished out of the Commonwealth, for
men in that way and of such a spirit are wont not only to renounce the
Churches of England, but ours also, because we held communion with them in
England in the things which are of God; see therefore how unjustly we are
slandered for renouncing communion with you, as is mentioned, and for it they
themselves are punished in our Common wealth, censures in our Churches; for
such Antichristian exorbit^res: by this you may see the Objection clearly
answered.

The second Calumny is, that our members must profess their repentance for all
former communion with the Churches among you: Now for the answer, we profess
no such things, but only in general so far as we have polluted our selves
with any corruptions or inventions of men, or defiled Gods Ordinances with any
corruption of their own, whereby you may gather answer from the second Calumny.

The third Calumny is, that we enter into covenant solemnly, never to have
communion with the present Churches of England, whereas in truth we never have
such words or meaning in any part of our Covenant, but that we profess to
walk in all the Ordinances of the Lord, according to his will revealed in his
Word.

Of the fourth report you mention, there is some ground for it, our practice,
power indeed is given among us to the people to choose their Ministers, so
likewise to receive any member unto the Church fellowship, and to join in the
excommunication of such as grow scandalous. which yet is very rare. Among us
through the goodness of God scarce two or three have been excommunicated out
of our Churches, which is more for rejecting communion with the Churches, than
for any other crime: It is true also, that we allow any members of the Church
to complain of an offense given him by any brother, if a private way of
Admonition according to the rule have not reformed him, Matthew. 18. 17. but that
has fallen out very seldom since I came hither, for ought I have heard,
either in our own or other Churches, they much wrong both you and us who told
you that Master Wilson was suspended from his Ministry for his Journey into
England, or for any Communion he had with the Churches there; nor to my
remembrance did any of the Brethren question him about it, till of himself he
began to give some account of his journey to the Church, and then indeed two
or three grave and godly men desired him to clear a passage or two; first, how
he could leave the whole Congregation above twelve months together without
their consent, and how he could leave his wife (as I remember) without her
consent; to both which he gave a satisfactory answer, and was not at all
suspended by the Church, but of himself he forbear one day, or at the least
half a day, till he had declared both the particulars; that which you add of
grace and gifts of Christ, or of his presence in the Ministry of his servants
among you, we willingly and thankefully acknowledge and do profess, that the
hope which most of us have obtained of the common salvation we received from
the preaching of Gods faithful Ministers among you, we cannot, we dare not
deny to Bless the Womb which bare us, and the Paps which gave us suck; and
long may these Lights shine among you, with all peace, purity, and power, Amen.

What you speak of Separatists and Brownists; we generally here do consent
with you, that the bitterness of Separation whereby men do not only cut
themselves from the inventions of men, but also from the Ordinances of God and
fellowship of his servants; for who so have done, they never were blessed with
peace: As for those scruples you pray me to weigh without prejudice, we here
do consent with you therein, only there is a passage or two which I crave
leave to explain my self in first that you say our Pastor M. Wilson affirms
among you that we did not follow Calvin's platform as an Episcopal he says,
he does not remember any such word to have fallen from him, only thus much he
confesses, as we do all here, that we do not transact all things so
reservedly in a consistory, but though we be prebestary, do prepare all
things for the Church, yet we transact no public act, but in their presence,
and with their consents, unless any of their brethren can give a reason from
the Scripture to the contrary, or some better intelligence of his own, which
latter sometimes falls out; secondly, what you speak of prophesying, I need
not say much of it, it is very warily used here, unless it be in absence, and
weakness of Ministers, and for any abuse herein allow it not, but dislike it
as you do: Now you have showed so much for to inquire the truth of these
matters, I pray you inform others also what answer you have received, which
will be a further testimony of your love; pray for us, as we do for you, so
taking leave I rest,

Your unworthy weak Brother in Christ, JOHN COTTON.

Questions put to such as are admitted to the Church Fellowship.
HOw it pleased God to work in them, to bring them home to Christ, whether the
law have convinced them of sin, how the Lord has won them to deny
themselves and their own righteousness, and to rely on the righteousness of
Christ, then they make a brief confession, or else an answer to a few
questions about the maine fundamental points of Religion, that it may appear
indeed whether they be competently endued with the knowledge of the truth, and
sound in the faith, and about the Godhead, the Trinity, the work, our first
estate of innocence the fall our redemption, Christ his Natures, his Offices,
Faith, the Sacraments, the Church, the Resurrection, the last judgment, such
as every Christian man is bound to learn and give account of; we refuse none
for weakness, either knowledge or grace, if the whole be in them, and that
any of the Church can give testimony of their Christian and sincere affections,
and then the Church consenting to their admission, one of the Elders propounded
to the party, the covenant that he must enter into with God and the Church,
whereunto the party expressly covenants, then is reciprocally received the
Churches covenant back again by the voice of the elder. This is all the
secret we have among us, neither have we any more secret carriage, than this
which no godly man that ever came over to us have ever disliked, you come not
more willingly to have communion with us, then we receive you, upon no harder
terms then have been declared.

The COVENANT it self.
SInce it has pleased God to move you brethren to hold forth the right hand of
fellowship; It is your part, and that which I am to require of you in the name
of the Lord, and of his Church, before you can be admitted there unto, whether
you be willing to enter a holy Covenant with God, and with them and by the
grace and help of Christ be willing to deny your self, and all your former
polutions, and corruptions, wherein in any sort you have walked, and so to give
up your self to the Lord Jesus, making him your only priest and atonement,
your only profit, your only guide and King, and Lawgiver, and to walk before
him in all professed subjections unto all his holy Ordinance, according to the
rule of the Gospel, and to walk together with his Church and the members
thereof in brotherly love, and mutual edification and succor according to God;
then do I also promise unto you in the name of this Church, that by the help
of Christ, we likewise will walk toward you in all brotherly love and holy
watchfulness to the mutual building, up one of another in the fellowship of
the Lord Jesus,

Amen, Amen.
FINIS.
