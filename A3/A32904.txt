A CHRONOLOGY OF THE RISE and GROWTH OF POPERY: From Vanity to Superstition,
thence to worse than Heathen Idolatry.

AND ALSO The Time When, and Who brought it in, contrary to the Apostolical
Canon: yet, for refusing Submission to POPERY many Thousands have been, and
Millions more are now designed to be murthred (besides, as we all know) and our
Cities burnt, etc.

Faithfully collected by a Son of the True Church, from their own Authors who
make many of their Devises ancienter than in truth they were, fathering them on
whom they please: and to maintain these Fooleries cursed Villainies are daily
practiced by the black Crew of Papists.
