The Despairing Lover A New Song.
^How long do you Mean to Torture me in Loves hot Score king Flames Cloris what
time Shall I get.
^free from Loves fantastic Dreams, never, that Sad Infernal Sound does daily
Reach,
^mine ear: and ever racks yt. bleeding wound which. for your Sake which. for your
Sake I bear:
That I do Love Cloris you know
My grief to you I tell
My over fondness of you Shows
That I have loved too well
And in requital of My Love
You blast me with a breath
The wounds you gave will fatal prove
Each frown pronounce
Each frown pronouncing Death --
It greives my heart to See you choose
My Rival in my room
And unconcerned tell him the News
On Me you have past your Doom
My Injured Ghost when ere I Die
Shall never let you rest
But hovering in the Air shall fly
and Steal
And Steal into your breast --
Thus I Torment my Self and doubt
that you unconstant are
You know true Love is never without
Great jealousies and fears
Than pardon the distracted thoughts
Of one you know is true
One Love has in Subjection brought
and made a Slave
And made a Slave to you --
If you have any pity left
than Show it now and Save
Him who Despaires of finding rest
and don't you Digg my Grave
For if I die through your Neglect
pray write this on My Tomb
My Judge being Fair I did expect
a favoura
A favorable Doom --
And since you did my woes procure
I Will try if Torments can
Increase my flame or help to cure
a love distracted Man
I Will find some sure yet speedy way
to end my misery
Too long my ruin I delay
and yet Seem Loath
And yet seem loath to Die --
I Will place my self on Caucasus
and there I Will lend such Groans
Shall Scare the Damned Prometheus
with my Sad frightfull Tones
I Will make the Vultures quit their prey
and feed upon my breast
For through this means perhaps I may
find hopes of have
Find hopes of having rest --
Finis
