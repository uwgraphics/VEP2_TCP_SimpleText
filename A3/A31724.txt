THE CHARACTER OF AN Englishman.
BY the first Principles, of Mother Earth
An English man is noble, by his birth
Has a fine body, and an Aspect Rare
Shines like the Stars in Northern Hemesphere,
He being of the purest matter made
As by the wise Philosopher is said
Crowns him, in the Figure of his Manhood high,
As the sun is the Candle of the Sky
Nature and R^ason make him Rich and great,
And plant him in their Golden Chair of State;
So highly born, that from his Blood we hope
That he may rule, in Princedomes Horoscope:
He fears God, and Honors high his King
Acting, and doing well in every thing;
His Ethics are so high, and learning Rare,
Though he treads on the Earth, yet flies in Air,
And as Divinity does Law excel,
So in him, does true Perfection dwell;
Religious Reason is his sole delight,
And loves to see both Church and State go right:
To all he is Allamode, Iantee, and Neat,
Brisk, Complaisant, Endearing, and Complete;
Having both Wisdom and good wit at will,
And can do all things, unless that of ill:
And for his Innocence and Conscience high,
He'1 duel with the Devils in the Sky?
Following the Dictates of his real Nature,
Showing that the reasonable Creature
Is not for to be forced, but gently led
By Governors, and by his dearest Head;
He takes his Princes part against the Devil,
And will not have him come to any evil;
And yet Resolves that he will be no slave,
Unless unto the Mighty, Good, and Brave;
He pays all just Devoires, where truly due,
And where it is Fictitious and not true,
Grows careless of the Justice of his breast,
And so leaves all to take his pleasant rest:
Showing against Reason and Religion,
Nothing in humane interests is done;
Since it is a thing that mounts him to the Grove
Of Joy, and Peace, and Universal Love.
Where when the Feast is over, and Banquet done,
Like the Eagle he shall fly beyond the Sun:
Where he shall see such Prospects of delight,
As does transcend all humane words and sight;
And there be rendered happy in loves Arms
With all Celestial and eternal Charms.
From Heaven we pass, and down to Earth again
To behold him in his curious Train?
His Air, and Voice, proclaim the Angelick nature,
Making him the Metropolis of the Creature:
And all his virtues do denote him high
To be the next a kin to the Divinity?
Their Speech is mean like to the Birds of the Field,
Therefore a pleasant Conversation yield:
Showing the variety of the World,
As differing Lights from the same Sun are hurled;
But in him the Indies of his love's laid out,
Which makes him turn the Giddy world about?
Among Beasts, the Lion, Birds, the Eagle high,
So among men the English signify,
Among Flowers the Rose exceeds the other,
Of the Pink, Tulip, and the Gilliflower;
Heaven showing it self most unto its own,
Like a kind Parent to his beloved Son;
In short he is the Flower of the Creation,
Still acting as best becomes his Station?
The Favorite both of Heaven and of Earth,
And blessed from his very Infant-birth,
He lives here for a while to take his pleasure,
And when he comes into the Starry Treasure
The Powers above do treat him as a friend,
In glorious Mansions where there is no end.
The Picture.
See and behold the English, and draw nigh
Unto their noble Prince in Majesty,
So great he is that Greatness cannot him raise
Clothed with Majesty and Celestial Rays;
In every degree a happy Creature,
From the perfections of his mind and Feature;
So mighty witty, and so rarely wise,
The joy of Heart, and wonder of our eyes?
At whom we still draw near to, and look on
Like Marygolds, when opening to the Sun;
And as Jove's happy with his Joys above,
So England's King is in his Subjects love;
And when Nature fails that he must dye
He shall be Crowned to all Eternity.
I have perused these Verses, and find them composed according to the Rules of
Poetry, and therefore think them fitting to be Printed.
