CANTERBVRIES DREAM.
ON the fourteenth of May, betwixt the hours of twelve and one, when the night
was growing toward the morning, and darkness did yet incompasse me, my
unquiet thoughts did interrupt my sleep, and the terror of the afflicting
place wherein I lodged, did possess my soul: (whether awake, or in a vision I
cannot say) but me thought, the reverend shadow of Cardinal Wolsey did present
himself unto my view, and with a graceful and Majesticke gate, accoutered
with those habiliments which did become his honors, he walked thrice by the
side of my bed, and waving his left hand to me, he leaned himself at his
third return, upon his Crosier staff, and with a soft voice he whispered
thrice into my ear, My Lord, my Lord, my Lord.

Though my faith in the great redeemer of the world, my Lord Jesus, to whose
Name without superstition I shall ever bow, had prepared and confirmed me to
over-looke all fears and dangers which frail flesh does stoop unto, I was
amazed at the presence of the man, and by his proud deportment being not able
well to distinguish whether it was the Cardinal Wolsey, who had Kings to his
favorites; or whether it was the Cardinal of Richeleau, who had Balzac to his
servant; my disputing thoughts made up to my first presumption, that it was
indeed Cardinal Wolsey; and the rather, because the honesty of Philosophy does
instruct me, that no sublunary creature can make an intuitive dispatch, but
being bound by the jurisdiction of Nature, to obey her terms of place, cannot
move at once in two several places, though oftentimes the abused fancy
presents unto it self the counterfeit and phantasticke bodies of absent friends
or foes, the fancy being overcome by the dominiering passions of love or
hatred. But the Cardinal to cut off all doubtings, began thus to speak unto
me: My Lord, the news of your greatness, and the noise of the falling
Episcopacie, has roused me from the sloth of death, to understand what new
ambition could prompt again the Miter to aspire unto a parity with the Crown,
what policies could support so bold an enterprise, what spirit give warmth unto
so dangerous a work. I gave no answer at all; whereat, either indignation of
heart, or in assuming unto himself by my silence, a greater liberty of
language, he thus proceeded: My Lord, I had thought after my fate, that no man
would again adventure to prefer the pomp of this vain world to the service
of Almighty God, and the cares by him enjoined to his charge. My Lord, you
might have read in the example of the right reverend Father in God, Thomas
Becket, sometimes Archbishop of Canterbury, and in my sad legend, how dangerous
it is for Prelates to nourish ambitious thoughts; and that the highest glory of
the Church is the humility and the harmony of the Priests; but because that men
blown up by Fortune, will swell themselves into any design, be it never so
impossible: what flattering conceit did tempt you in your pride of heart to
magnify your Grace with mine, in a time when the English Clergy lived not in
that pomp and flourish as in my days they did; when their best revenewes lie
impropriated to certain Lay persons, and when it is almost impossible to
obtain or to hope for a recovery.

I had a great mind to give him that answer which his cause deserved, but
having quite abandoned this world and anchored my faith on Jesus Christ, I lay
silent while he thus proceeded. My Lord, never dream to make such parallels
perfect, I must confess my parentage was as low as yours, my education in the
University was in Magdalen College of Oxford, as yours of Saint John's; Indeed
my growing honors received not that privilege to be President of Magdalen
College, as you were of the other, my nobler wing did soar to a brave height,
and though the Chronicler who for all his name makes more haste then good
speed, delivers me to be a Schoolmaster; I was in Oxford Tutor to my Lord of
Dorsets sons, a charge that calls for the indowments of an honest and an
able man. Alexander was more obliged to Aristotle for his educat^on, then unto
Philip for his Kingdoms, as it is a greater honor to be a Christian then to be
a man: God elected me to be an Ambassador to his people, and Henry the 7. to
be an Ambassador to a most royal Prince, besides the honor of the Cardinals
cap, and the broad seal of England. I sat at once in seven Episcopal seas,
and the Primat of England (which is the greatest dignity that ever you arrived
at) was content to have his Crosses and his train to follow the Metropolitans
of York: I lived as gracious in the eye of my Sovereign as your self, though
it was your happiness to meet with a Prince of a more excellent and a more
constant temper, Earls have been proud upon their knees to take the assay of
my wine: It is true indeed, that you have countenanced learning and the muses
and have beautified and improved their habitations, but not in my magnificent
way: The hatred of the Commons has been unto us alike, and some great men in
both our times have griveously accused us: I was condemned as the causer of all
heavy impositions, and my Lord how you can purge your self from that
accusation, you best can speak: what though Sir Amias Paulet was by my means
for the space of six years retained a prisoner in the middle Temple, I doubt
not but you have made more then one man suffer, and have put them to a harder
if not a longer durance. The ruin of us both was indeed in both our times the
joy and the voice of the people, and for the many barrells of gold and silver
which I extorted from the Commons to release the captive Pope, I doubt not but
you have found new ways to raise as great sums, and for what ends (my Lord)
your self best know. My Lord let not your self or succeeding ages, make you
my parallel, for though you equal me in my errors, I surmount you in my
honors and magnificence: much more I have to say, but this is the third
summons of the Cock and to fill the number up, I must return unto the children
of night; I was preparing to make my answer to him, but immediately he vanished
from my sight, but with a louder voice then before as he turned his back, I
heard him to utter these or the like words: My Lord though I depart I must
leave you behind me, wherein your fate has prevented the condition of many
your late State delinquents, who make a common custom, as they say, first to
offend, and then to run away.

FINIS.
