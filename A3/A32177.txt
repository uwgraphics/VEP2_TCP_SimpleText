Preface.
IT is not needful to say much concerning the late Agreement betwixt his
Sacred Majesty Charles the Second, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,
etc. And the City and Kingdom of Algier; (The Aricles whereof are in these
following Papers, Word forword Exhibited;) For certainly that Man is very
little read in the World, who sees not how much this Peace imports the Benefit
and Security of the English Commerce, and no less the Honor of the English
Nation; especially considering the start it has given us of our Powerful
Neighbors, who are still laboring under Great Trouble, Charge and Difficulty,
with those People: And the Accord is yet more Glorious, if We observe the Time
wherein it was made; That is to say, It was made at a Time, when the English
lay patiently exposed to all the Inconveniences, which either the Fables, or
the Councils of Holland could give them; Menaced in the very Channel by an open
Force, and deserted in the Mediterranean after such a manner, that We are loath
to make use of a Word, answerable to the Quality of the Action: The Hollanders
having first invited us into a Conjunct Engagement with them, and afterward not
only quitting the Place by Stealth and Surprise, But invading at the same time
our Rights in Guine: And yet so it is at last, That notwithstanding All These
Practices, and Disappointments, We have now lived to see the Hollanders swallow
their own Resolutions, by withdrawing their Shipping, and contenting
themselves with the blind Passage of the North, rather then adventuring to give
His Royal Highness the Lord High Admiral of England, the Un-mannerly
provocation of pressing through the Channel. And we have likewise lived to
enjoy the fruits of that Peace which others have in vain attempted; and not
only so, but to see our selves acquitted of the guilt of the late War, by a
Solemn Declaration of the Government it self of Algier, and the Breach charged
upon the Tumults and Disorders of their own Subjects: They Themselves not
sticking Publicly to avow, That an Agreement with England was to them so
Necessary, That they were not able to maintain an Intercourse and
Correspondence without it.

This being the Sum and State of that Affair, gives sufficiently to
understand how great a Care His Majesty has of the Reputation and Welfare of
his People, and of the True Interest of the English Crown and Nation: And it is
our further happiness that the Orders and Directions of so Wise and Gracious a
Prince are Committed into the hands of suitable Officers and Ministers, as has
been manifested throughout the whole Course and Conduct of this Transaction.
