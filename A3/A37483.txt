TO THE READER.
THE Divine Wisdom Treasured in the Holy Scripture, although unadorned with the
plausible paint of Humane Eloquence, nor with that Rapidity and Lightness,
which ( Junius and Tremellius well say) the word (...) signifies, Jer. 23.32.
Yet it wants not a Grave, Genuine, (...) levis, velux, mobilis fuit, subsilii
saltavit, Judge. 9.4. Leigh in voc.
and Majestical dignity of Elocution suitable to those Sacred Mysteries it
twofolds. The best witness of which is the Taste and Experience of that
sweetness, which many have found in it. The mode of speech in Scripture is
plain, and savours of to humane blandishment, or artificial Beauty: Yet it is
most August and Efficacious to pierce the minds of Men, as 1 Cor. 2.1, 4. Where
the Apostle disclaims any Rhetorical flourishes, or persuasive Oratory, but
professes that his speech and Preaching, was not with the enticing (or (...),
persuasive) words of Man's Wisdom, but ((...),) in the Demonstration and Power
of the Spirit, that is, in words truly Spiritual, which could powerfully and
effectually move their Hearts. Where this Eminent Servant of God, disowns his
Humane Eloquence, but not that Divine Elocution in which he excells, and checks
those plausible affectations, and artifice of words, which the Orators of his
time made use of, who fed their Auditors, with the vain glory of words, in the
Contemplation and delight of which they went away, without any other
improvement than what bare Rhetoric could afford.

I may (not unfitly) allude to a passage in Plutarch, where it is said, Franz.
hist. Animal. cap. 26. p. 554
that Lacon hearing a Nightingale Sing, and by the briskness of its warbling
and delicate Notes, and by the clearness, and quavering cadency of its Voice,
judged it a good prey; but when he saw it, and found it to be of so small a
size (for it is not much bigger than a Sparrow) he disdainfully left it, and
said, vox es, praeterea nihil, thou art a voice and nothing else. So, whoseever
deceives people with those fancy-taking modulations of empty Rhetoric, in the
Ministry or Sacred work of Preaching, will in the end become despised, and will
not only be forsaken of their Judicious Auditors, but will also by the great
Play Master be called unprofitable Servants.

Beyond all Writings in the World, the Style of Scripture is singular, and has
peculiar proprieties, not elsewhere found, there simplicity is joined with
Majesty, commanding the veneration of all serious men; more than the Elaborate
flourishes and long winded periods of Tully.

Lib. 3. Confess. cap. 5.
Augustine says, that the Scripture seemed rude and unpolished to him in
comparison of Cicero's adorned style, because he did not then understand its (
interiora or) inward beauty, but when he was Converted to Christianity
declares, lib. 4. de Doctrine. Christ. c. 6. That when he understood them, no
Writing appeared more Wise and Eloquent. Greg. Budaeus lib. 5. de ass et
partibus ejus p. 754.
Nazianzen, a man of a prodigious Wit, great Learning and Eloquence, and an
excellent Poet, when he came over to the Study of this sacred Philosophy,
vilifies all other ornaments of Literature amongst the Greek Philosophers, as
infinitely below those Divine Oracles.

Pat. 2. Clav. Script. Col. 15.
Illyricus says, that although we find not in the Sacred Scriptures, that idle
or delicate itch of Words, that external sweetness or allurement, that
numerosity of sounds, or those pleasing trifles, which the vainglorious
Orators of Greece and Rome beautified their so much celebrated harangues with,
yet we find there a Grave and Masculine Eloquence, exceeding all others.

By the very precepts of Rhetoric, what may be ones man's Eloquence may be
another Folly, because the style must be found according to the various
circumstances of Persons and Things. The Lawyer pleads Eloquently, and strives
to move the Affections of others. The Judge pronounces the sentence Gravely. A
King commands or forbids Plainly. But if the King persuades, or the Judge
contends, they throw off the person of a King or Judge, and assume the person
of a Subject and Pleader. What then is the Law of the King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords? Do we think our God will use Inductions, as Plato; Syllogisms, as
Aristotle; Elenchs, as the Carmeades; Epiphonema's as Cicero; Subtilties as
Seneca; or words far fetched, joined together with an artificial Sintax with
respect to weight, number, and sound? If a Royal Edict were published in that
kind of speech consisting of School follies, every wise man would laugh at it.
The more plain the Word and Law of the great God is, it is so much the more
becoming the Divine Author and Lawgiver, and more profitable for mankind,
because so it is more easily understood, being like daily food, accommodated to
every Palate. But what if in that humility of style in Scripture, there be more
height and loftiness, and more profoundness in its Simplicity, more beauty in
its nakedness, and more vigor and acuteness in its (seeming) rudeness, then in
those other things we so praise and admire? etc. This Holy Book is of most
powerful efficacy to instruct the humble, and confound the proud. In History,
the main thing praise worthy is Truth, which is here set forth indubitably.

True Beauty abhors (and indeed needs not) the bedawbings of a pencil for the
more naked it is, it is so much the more attractive; and as Jewellers say, The
richer the Gem is, the less it needs the assistance of Gold or Art to set it
off, etc. If a proper and comely man walks upon Stilts to appear Taller, it
adds nothing to his beauty, but diminishes the decorum of his natural
proportion.

Yet nevertheless there is in Scripture a peculiar and admirable Elegance, so
that I may boldly say that Cicero's smooth and elaborate blandishments, are but
exercises of Puerility, in comparison of the grave, lively and venerable
Majesty of the Prophet Esaias style, as the very Exordium of his Book shows,
Esa. 1.2. etc. which is full of Ingenity and Eloquence, Humility and
Grandiloquence; Reason and Affection. And it may be safely asserted, that
considering the Method and Style, that was thought most convenient by the
Sovereign Dictator of this blessed Writing, the Argument of which it treats,
and the manner of expression there, no other Writing can Parallel it. Because
that which is Holy, is withal Venerable and Grave, and such things need no
paint or artificial illustrations, and because the multitude of Readers is
promiscuous, it was needful that it should be understood by all, because every
man is concerned to believe and observe it. And hence the Scriptures were
written in the common Language, viz. The Old Testament in Hebrew, the mother
Tongue of the Jews, and the New Testament in Greek, there most Universal
Language of that time, whence we may infer the Impiety of such as prohibit
Translations of it.

Beza that great Philologist says, that Paul's Writings, when he treats of the
Mysteries of the Divinity, far exceeds the Grandiloquence of Plato, the
flourishes of Demosthenes, and the exact method of Aristotle and Galen.

That threefold character of declaiming, Alsted.
which Rhetoricians make such a bustle about, viz. of a high and lofty style,
that which consists in a mean, and that of a low and humble, is to be found in
the Scripture, so as that it may even ravish the attention of the hearer into
admiration. And that which Critics, admire in Homer, Thucydides, and Pindarus
singly, are universally found here, which must not be understood of that
elegance that tickles the fancy, and relishes with the fleshy Ear, but the
inward and most noble part, viz. an illuminated Soul.

To this purpose the Learned Rivet, Franciscus Picus, and Bibliander express
themselves with much Reason and Eloquence, preferring the Bible as to its
style, before the most studious ornaments and splendour of oratory found amongst
the profane Rhetoricians. The last of which brings this Example out of Esa.
25.6. to prove the native grace and beauty of the Hebrew, the elegancy of which
no man can be ignorant of, that understands the Hebrew, (...) Veasa Jehovah
(...) zebaoth lecol hammiim behar hazaeh misthe schemaniim, misthe schemariim
schemaniim memychaiim, schemariim mesykkakiim, In English, And in this Mountain
shall the Lord of Hosts make unto all People a Feast of Fat things, a Feast of
Wine on the Lees, of Fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well
refined, etc.

The Words of Picus Earl of Mirandula are notable, in his Epistle to Hermolaus
Barbarus, Non movent, non persuadent sacrae literae; sed cogunt, agitant, vim
inferunt, legis rudia verba, etc
The Sacred Scriptures, says he, do not move, nor persuade; but compel, stir
up, and force. Thou read words that seem rustic and unpolisht (viz. in the
opinion of the wise men of this World) but they are lively, quick, inflaming,
sharp, and penetrating even the very spirit, transforming the whole by an
admirable power. And his excellent Nephew, another Mirandula lib. 2. Exam.
vanit. Doctrine. Gent. says, that although Scripture style seems to us more Rude
than Eloquent, yet it has an extraordinary power to command the Reverence and
Affections of the peruser. Of these two Mirandula's (the Uncle and the Nephew
who were the Ornaments not only of Italy, but of the Age they lived in) the
aforesaid Bibliander says, that after they had perused all approved Authors,
and had almost surfeited with humane literature, they betook themselves to the
Study of (and acquiesed in) the Scriptures, with which they were so ravished,
that they could not be satisfied.

Jerome says of the Book of Esaias, that the floridness of his style can be
represented by no Translation.

That expression of the Learned (and otherwise praise worthy) Erasmus is to be
wondered at, who says, qui fit? In Annot. Act. 10. p. 317.
ut Apostolorum sermo non solum impolitus sit and inconditus, verum etiam
imperfectus, etc. How comes it to pass? that the speech of the Apostles is not
only unpolished, and confused, but also imperfect and solaecising -- adding a
little after, the Authority of the Apostles is not to be Judged by their mode
of speech, but their meaning. Neither may a Godly man be offended more with
their undrest style, than with their plain and homely clothing; concluding,
that the Apostles learnt not the Greek Tongue from the Orations of Demosthenes
but popular speech -- whereas all true Christians know, that they learnt it of
the great God who is all wise and Eloquent (in whom no excellent quality is
wanting) who infinitely surpasses Demosthenes, and who directed their minds,
their Language and Style to express the sacred Mysteries of true Wisdom, as is
very evident from Matthew. 10.20. Luke 21.15. 2 Pet. 1.21. Lib de vero Cultu. c.
21.
Hence Lactantius says, that such as were accustomed to sweet and artificial
Orations or Verses, despised the plain and common mode of Scripture speaking as
rude, because they delight in that, which tickles the sense and fancy, which
while it captivates the mind, misguides and insnares. But cannot God (who
formed the mind, tongue, and voice) speak Elegantly? Yes certainly, for by his
gracious Providence he has ordered those Divine things to be published without
the disguise of any artificial bedawbing, (which conceals the true meaning of
the speaker) that all may understand what he delivers. By which words, as he
confesses the Scripture to be no way imbellished with humane Art, so he
asserts, that the phrase is pure; and divinely Eloquent, and adapted to express
its sacred Contents.

The difference of the sacred style (with respect to the Hebraisms in the New
Testament) from those profane Rhetoricians, (whose main end was to beguile
attention, and inveagle men's minds by the artifice of words) should be an
argument to confirm the minds of such men (as believe the Apostle) in the
Faith, 1 Cor. 2.4, 5.
because of the antiquity, certainty, and perfection of that sacred Tongue,
first taught by the sovereign Creator; rather than urged as a Reason to Judge
it impure, imperfect or abounding with solaecisms.

Graceless Eloquence attired in the most Illustrious dress of Tropes and
Schemes, adorned with the borrowed phrases of Tully or Demosthenes, and
whatever the common places of Phrase-students can afford, is certainly an
engine of mischief, breathing out threatening and slaughter against the
Disciples of the Lord, as Paul (the Scholar of Gamaliel) did before his
Conversion, Acts 9.1. etc. For those accomplishments, if unsanctified, are
(like a Sharp sword in a mad hand) fit only for the baffling (as far as it can)
of plain and Naked Truth.

It Is true, that there are many Hebraisms in the New Testament, that is, a
mixture of the Idiom of that sacred Language with the Greek, which the Heathen
Grecians (being ignorant of the phrase) accounted barbarous. But Christians,
who know that much of the Old Testament is quoted in the New, should rather
esteem it an Ornament; because the propriety of the first Language (than which
no speech is more significant and emphatical) is diffused into the other; and
because (as Heinsius a man as Glass. says, Learned to a Miracle, in Prolegom.
Aristarch. sacri. well expresses himself) if any man will be so impudently
bold, as to say that the Scriptures are any way defective, he declares himself
thereby not Learned, but a Blasphemer, and brutally mad, as well as ignorant of
the quality of man, who is no Judge of what God says or does, but ought rather
to be a supplicant and attend his dispensations with Reverence and Adoration.
And as Hillary words it, when the discourse is of the affairs of the great God,
we must yield him the Prerogative of knowing best what he says or does, and
instead of carping, pay him veneration. The Mysteries which God proposes to be
believed in his holy word, as they are in themselves most true and best,
although all humane Reason, which Judges by its own wisdom or carnal
conclusions, should otherwise determine: So their Eloquence (an inseparable
companion of Divine Wisdom is to be esteemed the best and most elegant by the
faithful, unless we suppose that God who immediately dictated them to his
Amanuensis, spoke nonsense, and is inferior to his Creatures in that
qualification, which is down right Blasphemy, and any asserting that deserves
not only derision, but the severest castigation.

The peculiar Idiotisms, and most pure character of speaking, which the Holy
Spirit used in the publication of the saving word of Truth, are by the
excellent Glassius (a man for his singular pains, and exquisite Learning to be
celebrated by all posterity) as he himself modestly says, in part (for what
mortal can express its whole energy?) delivered in his Gram. sacra. (a work
well worth Translating). And the Lights of speech, that is, the Tropes and
Figures there, are in this sacred Rhetoric treated of, being indeed the
substance of what he writ in Latin upon, that Subject (we hope) faithfully
Translated, The Tropes in this Volume, and the Figures in the second. Only the
Reader may Note, that we have not absolutely tied our selves to his words but
have to the best of our abilities expressed his sense, abridging where need was,
and supplying out of other Learned Authors to which be referred, or who had
written of the same thing in our Language, which we consulted, and inserted
what was judged necessary for the completing of this work. Which,

Does not only open that part of Scripture which is Tropical and Figurative,
but may teach) the Reader (if ignorant of it) Rhetoric in general, an Art of
such General use, that no writing can well want it: I mean, not a jingling
affectation of Words or Sentences, but the use of Tropes and Figures, which
nervate sense, and move the affections of the Hearer or Peruser.

Although the design of this work, was principally intended to open Scripture
Metaphors, yet many express Similitudes, and other Terms borrowed from an
humane custom of speech or appellations, obvious in, and proper to common and
Earthly things, are improved Parallel wise in the Second Part, for common
Edification; at which the Learned and Candid Reader will not Carp: For we bring
not all as Metaphors, but as Terms that may be used as advantageously, and as
much to profit, though in the strict notion of that Trope, not agreeing with
its definition (which we give in its place) of which we caution our Reader
under their respective heads.

In the First Book the Texts alleged are cited from the very original Hebrew
and Greek, because there are many Tropes (peculiar to those sacred Languages)
which our excellent English Translation rather expounds than renders verbatim.

We have taken Care to make necessary Tables for both Parts, and we purpose,
with Divine help, to continue our Labors in another Volume, which you may, in
page the last of the First, and p. 76 of the Third Book of this Volume, have a
brief account of: Our design being to complete this said Philology for the
benefit of such as want the acquirements of humane Literature, and are Students
in sacred Learning.

It Is certain that no sort of men, have more need of Learning than the
Ministers of the Gospel, because their Employment is of the highest concern,
viz. rightly to divide the Word of Truth, and therefore that Sacred Office is
not to be intruded into, but by Persons duly qualified and called. And most
certain it is that humane Literature without Grace, is a dangerous Enemy to the
true Christian Religion, and barely considered in it self gives no Right to the
exercise of that sacred function, any more than the meanest of Mechanic Arts:
For as Doctor Carlton formerly Bishop of Chichester well says, A Lay man that
has the spirit of God is better able to Judge of the Church and its Members,
than a Man in Ecclesiastical function that has not the spirit of God. And
Justin Martyr, excellently, Infelix est sapi^^ntia extra verbum Dei sapere, so
that, it is not the formality of Academical Degrees, nor any Philosophical
dexterity, which is to be exercised in the things that may be known by the
light of natural Reason, nor variety of Languages that qualifies a Preacher;
for if things will travel beyond their Road, and must needs be defining things
beyond their sphere (or reach) they become extravagant and saucy. He that
Ministers the word, ought principally to experience the Grace of God in his own
heart, and the power of it in that grand and Evangelical work of Regeneration;
as also to understand those blessed Mysteries of the sacred Scriptures, that he
may unfold them to others, and have a Lawful call, which altogether constitutes
him in his Office, though he never saw University, this being the reason given
by the Royal Psalmist. I have recieved, says he, (which is an equivalent term)
and therefore have I spoken; his Faith being his Authority for his Preaching,
that is, the primary or Chief. Yet we would not be understood to disparage
humane learning as a thing of no use, for it is of excellent benefit in its
place, when rightly employed, and the knowledge of the Original Languages, in
which the Scriptures are penned, is of very great necessity, that we might
converse with that sacred Book in its own Emphatical and native Idiom. So that
this kind of Literature is good, as a Handmaid, Hagar-like, but if it must
needs be Mistress and Vsurp Authority in the Family; if like scoffing Ishmael
(Genesis 21.9. Gal. 4.30.) it will mock at the Spirit, and the simplicity of the
Gospel, let it be cast out. etc.

To accomodate therefore, such whose Christian minds incline them to Instruct
others, and need those aids which the want of Languages, or this kind of
Literature has denied them; (not to instruct the Learned) was this work
Compiled, and to that end is recommended to the Christian Reader, by

Benj. Keach. Tho. Delaune.

Philologia Sacra, OR The TROPES and FIGURES in SCRIPTURE Reduced under their
proper Heads and Classes, with a Brief Explication of each, etc.
SCripture Rhetoric, or Sacred Elocution, may be reduced to two principal
Heads or Chapters.

1. The first of [ Tropes.] 2. The Second of [ Figures.]
First, [ Tropes;] Which concern the Sense of Words, viz. When they are drawn
from their proper and genuine signification, to that which is different or
Contrary; which the Etymology of the word shows; for (...) is derived from
(...) signifying, verto, muto, to turn or change.

Second, [ Figures;] Which the Greeks calls (...), signifying the Habit or
Ornament of Speech, do not alter or vary the Sense of Words, but imbellish,
beautify, or adorn them.

Of the first we will Treat under two heads, 1. The Kinds Of [ Tropes.] 2. The
Affections Of [ Tropes.]


The Kinds of Tropes are four, viz. Metonymie, Ironie, Metaphor, and
Synechdoche, which order depends upon Logical Topics, from whence Tropes are
deduced, As, 1. Metonymie, from Causes, and Effects. (1.) From Subjects, and
Adjuncts.
2. Ironie, from Contraries. 3. Metaphor from Comparates. 4. Synechdoche from
the distribution of the whole into its Parts. (2.) Of the Genus estquod de
pluribus differentibus essentialiter praedicatur in quid, non conversim, ut
animal genus est hominis.
Genus into its Species est pars generi subjecta, ut homo est species animalis,
(...) i. e. Species est quae collocatur sub genere ab (...), video.
Species.



Genus, is a more general Title, which comprehends some things more special
under it, as substance which comprehends. (1.) Living Creatures. (2.) Metals.
(3.) Elements, etc.

Species, is a more special Title attributed to diverse particulars under it as
a Man, to John, Peter, James, or any other individual.

The [ Affections] of Tropes, are Three. 1. Catachresis. 2. Hyperbole. 3.
Allegory.


Of which there are certain Species, As; 1. Paraemia, or a Proverb, and 2.
Aenigma.


Of These with Gods help we shall Treat in Order.

CHAP. I. Of a Metonymie of the Cause.
(...), transnominatio, a chan^^e of Names or transmutatio, sive nominis, pro
nomine posito ex (...), trans and (...), Aeolice pro (...) Nomen, etc.
A Metonymie is a Trope when a Cause is put for the Effect, or the Effect for
the Cause, the Subject for the Adjunct, or the Adjunct for the Subject.

There are four kinds of Metonymies, Answering to the four kinds of Causes,
Viz. 1. Efficient. 2. Material. 3. Formal. 4. Final.


A Metonymie of the Cause is used in Scripture, when, 1. The Person acting is
put for the thing done: 2. When the Instrument by which a thing is done, is put
for the thing effected. 3. When a Thing or Action is put for the effect
produced by that Action, of which in Order.


1. The Person Acting for the thing Acted or Effected.
1. THE HOLY SPIRIT is put for its Effects and Operations, as 2 Cor. 3:6. Who
has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the Letter, but of the
Spirit, for the Letter kills but the Spirit gives Life. Where by the term [
Letter] we are to understand the Law written in Tables of Stone, which required
perfect obedience, and which no man can perform because of Corruption,
therefore that Law can pronounce nothing but a sentence of Death: But by [
Spirit] is meant the saving Doctrine of the Gospel, which derives its original
from the Spirit (considered as a most merciful comforter) who sets it home upon
the Soul, fitting and preparing it thereby for Eternal Life; suitable to John
6.63. The Words that I speak are Spirit and Life; that is, Joh. 6.63.
they are from the Spirit of God, and being received by Faith confer Salvation,
through the grace of God, Romans 8.2. Part. 1. Col. 1162.
By the Law of the Spirit of Life (as Illyricus says) is meant the Doctrine of
the Gospel, (because it is a peculiar instrument or means of its operation)
which by a Divine efficacy, changes the heart, and writes his Law there, which
now is not only inscribed in Tables or Parchments, but penetrates the inward
parts, quickening the soul to spiritual Motions and Actions. See Gal. 3.2.5.
Isa. 11.4. 2 These. 2.8. Isa. 42.1. and 61.1, 2. John 3.34. etc.

2. THE HOLY SPIRIT is put for Regeneration, Psalm. 51.10. Renew a right Spirit
within me. Ezekiel. 36.26. A new Spirit will I put within you, hence the Apostle
says, be ye renewed in the Spirit, etc. Ephesians. 4.23. Which is expounded, Romans
12.2. Be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed by the Renewing of
your mind, etc. Hence arises an opposition of Flesh and Spirit, John 3.6. That
which is born of the Flesh is Flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit, is
Spirit, where Primo loco vox Spiritus denotat ipsum spiritum sanctum, gratiose
per verbum et baptismum operantem; posteriori loco spiritus sancti (...)
salutare intelligitur.
by [ Flesh] is meant man defiled by sin, and by [ Spirit] the grace of
Renovation, or (which is the same thing) the Regenerate man. The Apostle 1
These. 5.19. Exhorts not to quench the Spirit, that is, the Gifts of the Spirit,
as Illumination, and Renovation, suitable to 2 Timothy 1.6. ((...), suscitare
instar ignis, Donum Dei,) stir up, as Fire, or Coals, are stirred up, for so
the word (...) signifies, the gift of God, which is in thee, for true Faith and
Godliness, may be resembled to a little Flame kindled by the Spirit in the
hearts of Believers, which the Devil and Carnal Corruptions endeavor to
smother, but is to be cherished and stirred up as fire is by more fuel; this
feeding and quickening fuel is the Word of God; In this sense the Soul is
distinguished from the Spirit in man: For (Spirit) denotes a Divine Power and
Energy in a Regenerate and Sanctified soul, by which it is carried to and
united to God, as Luke 1.46, 47. My Soul does magnify the Lord, and my Spirit
rejoiced in God my Savior, expounded, 1 These. 5.23. The very God of Peace
sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body, be
preserved blameless unto the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: For other places
where the Spirit is put for the New Man, and spiritual strength, see Psalm.
51.17. Esa. 26.9. Ezekiel. 18.31. Matthew. 5.3. and 26.41. Acts 17.16. and 19.21.
and 20.22. Romans 1.9. 1 Cor. 5.3, 4, 5. and 6.20. Gal. 3.3. etc.

More especially the SPIRIT is put for those peculiar or extraordinary Gifts of
the Spirit, which for various uses, whether public or private, spiritual or
external, are bestowed on Man, as Numb. 11.17. I will take off (or separate
part off, for so the Hebrew is) the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it
upon them, (viz. the 70 Elders, who, as verse 25 thereupon Prophesied and did
not cease,) upon which Vatablus says, The Lord so abstracted from the Spirit of
Moses, that he took away nothing, as one Candle (which Rab. Salomo calls a most
Elegant similitude) lights several, yet loses nothing of its Original light. To
this may the request of Elisha be referred, 2 Kings 2.9. I pray thee let a
double portion of thy Spirit be upon me, where there is an evident Allusion to
the right of Primogeniture or firstborn, Deuteronomy. 21.17. where the firstborn was
to have a double portion, etc. As if Elisha had said, I am your first Disciple,
received into your School, therefore ask of God a greater measure of Spirit for
me, then any one of your Disciples. Daniel had a more excellent Spirit (Dan.
5.12. with 6.3. for so the hebrew Text runs) and more knowledge and
understanding, etc. then the Presidents and Princes, that is, more excellent
and higher gifts of the Spirit, see Luke 1.17, 80. and 2.40. Acts 19.2. John
7.39. Acts 1.5.

To this may be referred, what is spoken of Revelations, Visions, or Ecstasies,
whether real or pretended, as Ezekiel. 37.1. The hand of the Lord carried me out
in the Spirit of the Lord; that is, by a Vision, or Rapture of Spirit, So 2
These. 2.2. That ye be not shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by Spirit,
nor by Word, nor by Letter, as from us, etc. That is, by Revelations which are
pretended to come from the Spirit, so Rev. 1.10. I was in the Spirit, that is
in an Ecstasy or immediate Revelation of the Spirit, as 2 Cor. 12.2. Rev. 4.2.
etc. and 17.3. and 21.10. is described.

The SPIRIT is also put for Doctrines revealed from Heaven, whether (...)
truly, or (...) by vain boasting so pretended, as 1 Cor. 14.32. The Spirits of
the Prophets are subject to the Prophets, that is, the Doctrine, or Scripture
Interpretation proposed by some Prophets, are subject to the Judgment of the
rest; for it would savor of Haughtiness, Ambition, and Disdain for any
individual to Vsurp an Infallibility, and reject the Judgment of the Brethren,
as verse 29. Let the Prophets speak two or three, and let the other Judge. If
any thing be Revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his Peace.
1 John 4.1. We are thus exhorted, -- Believe not every Spirit, but try the
Spirits, etc. The Marks of which are given; verses the second and third, etc.
Here it is evident that the Spirit is put for Doctrine, whether really revealed
or pretended to be so. And by seducing Spirits, 1 Timothy 4.1. is meant false
Teachers, that pretend their Doctrine to be from Gods Spirit, but is indeed of
the Devil.

[ Parents or Ancestors] are put for their Children, or Posterity, As Genesis
9.27. Japhet and Shem; Jacob and Israel for the Israelites, Exodus 5.2. Numb.
23.21. and 24.5, 17. Deuteronomy. 33.28. etc. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, of whom according
to the flesh Christ came, are put for Christ, Genesis 12.3. In thee which the
Chalde Translates [ for thee.] And the Targ. Hierosol. [In thy Righteousness or
Holiness] shall all the Families of the Earth be blessed. And Genesis 18.18. All
the Nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him, which is meant of his In te
and in s^^mine tuo, Copulativa (et) idem est ac, id est, etc.
Seed, as Genesis 22.18. Which Seed is Christ, who took on him the Seed of Araham,
Heb. 2.16. Through whom the blessing of Abraham is come on the Gentiles, Gal.
3.14.

[ The Writer or Author,] is put for his Writing, Book, or Work, Luke 16.29,
31* They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them, that is, they have
what Moses and the Prophets by inspiration from God have written, and delivered
to Posterity for the Canon and Rule of Faith. So Luke 24.27. Acts 15.21. and
21.21. 2 Cor. 3.15. But even unto this day when Moses is read, that is, the
Mosaical Writings, etc.

The [ SOUL,] the noblest part of man, is put for [ Life] which is its effect,
Genesis 9.5. What we translate [ blood of your Lives] is in the Hebrew [ blood of
your Souls] and Genesis 37.2. Reuben said let us not kill him, the hebrew says,
let us not smite him in the Soul. So Lev. 17.11. Life of the Flesh, in hebrew
is, soul of the Flesh, See Ps. 56.13, 14, 15. Jer. 40.14.

(1.) This Term is sometimes put for the whole Person of man, consisting of
Soul and Body, Genesis 46.27. Acts 27.37. (...) all the Souls in the Ship. (2.)
For the Body only, Ps. 105.18. Iron entered into his Soul, we translate it, he
was laid in Iron, that is, the Iron fetters made dints in his Flints. (3.) It Is
put for Life (as before) Psalm. 94.21. and 7.1, 2, 5. (4.) It Is put for a
Carcass, Lev. 19.28. Ye shall not make any cutting in your flesh for the Dead,
the hebrew is, for the Soul, and so it is taken, Lev. 21.1. And Hag. 2.4. (5.)
It is put for the Rational Soul, Ps. 19.7. Deuteronomy. 11.18, etc.

2. The SOUL is put for the Will, Affections and Desires, which are operations
of the soul, as Genesis 23.8. If it be your mind, in the Hebrew it is, (with your
Soul) as Psalm. 27.12. and 41.3. and 105.22. The Septuagint translates it ( if
ye have in your Soul) the Chaldee, (If it be the pleasure of your soul.) So
Exodus 23.9. Ye know the heart of a stranger, Heb. the soul of a stranger, that
is, his mind or affection. See Deuteronomy. 23.24. 1 Kings 19.3. 2 Kings 7.7. Psalm.
17.10, and 27. 12. and 41.3, Prove. 23.2. Jer. 34.16. John 20.24. (...); how
long do thou hold our soul in suspense? That is, as our Translation has it,
how long do thou make us to Doubt?

It may be referred hither, when the SPIRIT, which is often put for man's soul,
is used to express the Motions or Affections of the Soul, whether Good or Evil,
as Gen 45.27. The Spirit of Jacob their father revived, Numb. 14.24. My Servant
Caleb had another Spirit, Judge. 8.3. Their anger was abated, 'ti^^ in the
Hebrew their Spirit was abated, 2 Chronicles. 21.16. The Lord stirred up the Spirit
of the Philistines, etc. 2 Chronicles. 36.22. The Lord stirred up the Spirit of
Cyrus, etc. see Psalm. 76.13. and 77.4. Pro. 1.23. and 18.14. and 29.11. Eccl.
7.9. Isa. 29.10. and 37.7. Jer. 51.11. Ezekiel. 13.3. Dan. 5.20. Hag. 1.14. Hab.
1.11. Romans 11.8. 1 Cor. 2.12. etc. God has given the Spirit of slumber, Eyes
that they should not see, and Ears that they should not hear. Now you have
received, not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, etc.

2. The Organical Cause or Instrument is put for the thing Effected by it.
THE Mouth is put for Speech, or Testimony, as Deuteronomy. 17.6. At the Mouth of two
or three Witnesses, Mouth
shall he that is worthy of Death be put to Death, but at the Mouth of one
VVitness, he shall not be put to death. that is, by the Witness or Testimony of
two or three, etc. so Deuteronomy. 19.15. One witness shall not arise against a man
for any Iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: At the Mouth of
two Witnesses, or at the Mouth of three Witnesses shall the matter be
established -- which is expounded Matthew. 18.16. and John 8.17.

2. The MOUTH is put for a Command or Prescription, Genesis 45.21. And Joseph gave
them Wagons according to the Mouth of Pharaoh, etc. That is, (as we translate
it) according to the Commandment of Pharaoh. Exodus 17.1. And the Children of
Israel Journied according to the Mouth, (that is, the Commandment) of the Lord.
So Numb. 3.16, 39. and 20.24. and 17.14. Deuteronomy. 1.26.43. and 34.5. So Moses the
Servant of the Lord, died there in the Land of Moab, according to the Mouth of
the Lord, that is, according to the Word of the Lord. Upon which Sanctius says
in his Comment on Isa. 49. Therefore they do not rightly judge, who from the
Hebrew reading say, that Moses dyed in the kiss of the Lord; for that Tradition
is not from the Hebrew Text, but from the Targum which is attributed to Jonath.
Vziel, who renders (...) at the Mouth of the Lord, Ad Osculum verbi Domini,
that is, according to the kiss of the Mouth of the Lord. But what 's spoken of
the Mouth of the Lord, is better to be referred to the Trope Anthropopathia, of
which we shall hear hereafter.

[ The Tongue] is put for Speech, Prove. 25.15. A soft Tongue breaks the
bones, Tongue
that is, a mild, civil, and courteous speech, so Jer. 18.18. Percutiamus eum
propter is^^am Linguam, h^^c est, sermonem illum* importunum and nobis odiosum.
Let us smite him for that Tongue ((...)) that is, for his importunate,
unseasonable and odious Speech. But more especially for the Idiom or particular
Language of Nations. Act. 2.4, 11. And they were all filled with the Holy
Ghost, and began to speak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them
utterance. -- Cretians and Arabians do we hear them speak in our Tongues the
great things (or wonderful works) of God. It is also put for the Gift of
strange Languages. In my name shall they cast out Devils, they shall speak with
new Tongues, Mark. 16.17. and 1 Cor. 14.19. Yet in the Church I had rather
speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others
also, then Ten Thousand words in an unknown Tongue. That is, in a Language
which the People understand not, etc.

[ The Lip] is put for Speech, Genesis 11.1. And the whole Earth was of one Lip,
and of one word, that is, of one Language, and of one Speech, or Idiom of
speaking, the Chaldee says of one Tongue, and one Speech. That the Hebrew
Language is meant here, (which in Isa. 19.18. is called the Lip of Canaan [we
translate it Language by the same Trope) And which by the Targ. Hierosolym. and
R. Saloom upon the place is called the Holy Tongue) is showed elsewhere.
Neither was Hebrew the peculiar name of that Language in those times, because
there was no need of a term of distinction, there being no other Speech in the
World, till after the Confusion of Tongues, and scattering of the People at
Babel.

Pro. 17.7. A Lip of excellency does not become a fool, much less a Lip of
lying, A Prince, Non decorum est stulto labium dignitatis, quanto minus
liberali labium salsitatis.
that is, a worthy and excellent Speech does not become, or is not to be
expected from a Fool, much less should a Noble or brave mind tell Lies.

Esa. 33.19. A People of a deeper Lip (so the Hebrew) then thou can perceive,
that is, such as speak so obscurely, that you cannot understand them; as
Pagninus renders it. See Pro. 12.19. the Lip of Truth shall be established for
ever, but a lying Tongue is but for a moment. Job. 12.20. He removes away the
Lip of the faithful, etc. so it is in the Hebrew.

[ The Palate] is put for Speech. Pro. 5.3. For the Lips of a strange Woman
drop as an honey Comb, and her Palate (so the Hebrew) is smoother then Oil;
that is, her Words or Speech.

[ The Throat] is put also for loud Speaking, Isa. 58.1. Cry with the Throat
(so the Hebrew) spare not, etc. by which the Organ of Crying or Speaking is to
be understood, for the Explication follows, viz. lift up thy voice like a
Trumpet, and what the Scope or Argument of that loud Speech, or Shrill Cry, was
to be, is added in these words, And show my People their Transgression, and the
house of Jacob their sins.

[ The Hand] is put for Actions done by it, where there is also a Synechdoche,
For by the Actions of the Hands, some other things, as also Principles or
beginnings of Actions are understood, as Counsel, Machination or contrivance;
thought, endeavors, care, etc. as 1 Samuel 22.17. Slay the Priests of the Lord,
for their Hand is also with David, that is, they help him with their Counsel.
So 2 Samuel 3.12. and 14.19. 1 Kings 10.29. Psalm. 7.4. Isa. 1.15.

[ The Hand] is put for Writing, 1 Cor. 16.21. The Salutation of me Paul, with
mine own hand, that is, mine own Writing, and Col. 4.18. The Salutation by the
Hand, (that is the Writing) of me Paul. This is ordinary, (viz. for a man's
Writing to be called his hand) among the Greeks as Pollux and Suidas says, and
among the Latins, see Cicero lib. 7. Epist. ad Attic. as also in our common
Language.

[ The Hand] is put for a Gift reached by the Hand. Psalm. 68.32. Ethiopia shall
make her Hands run to God (so the Hebrew) that is, Ethiopia shall speedily
transmit her Gifts, as Psalm. 72.10. Isa. 60.6. to which Relates that of Lib.
35. cap. 14. Graeci Anqui doron palmum vocabant, and Dona Munera, quia Manu
darentur.
Pliny -- the Ancient Greeks called Doron the palm or fist, and therefore they
called the Hand, Gifts, that word so signifying because they were given
thereby. -- See Psalm. 22. 35, 36. And more under the Head or Title Metaphors.

[ A Sword] is put for War or Slaughter, which are in a great Measure performed
thereby. Exodus 5.3. Let us go we pray thee three days Journey into the Desert,
and sacrifice unto the Lord our God lest he fall upon us with Pestilence, or
with the Sword. Levit. 26.6. Neither shall the Sword go through your Land, so
Isa. 1.20. Jer. 14.12, 13, 15, 16. and 43.11. Psalm. 144.10. Romans 8.35. and
several other places. It is said, Matthew. 10.34. I came not to send Peace, but a
Sword --, that is, not such peace, as that men will rest contended and quiet in
Paganism, or Irreligion, but contend earnestly for the true Religion in their
Confessions and Preaching of the Gospel, even through Sufferings, Persecution,
and Blood, etc.

[ A line] or (...) measuring Rope, is put for a Country or tract of Land,
because by it was measured, as Amos 7.17. Micah. 2.5. Zach. 2.1. For it was a
custom to Measure Land by an extended Chord, and distribute Inheritances, as in
Palestine, which is done in modern times by a Rod or Perch, therefore the word
(...) A cord, Rope or Line, is put for the bounds, space or quantity of the
portion of Land given. Deuteronomy. 3.4. All the line of Argob, So it is in the Hebrew.
the Kingdom of Og in Bashan. The Chaldee says all the house or place of the
Province, etc. see Joshua 17.14. Psalm. 105.10, 11. Zeph. 2.5. etc.

Sometimes it is also a Metaphor, Deuteronomy 32.9. For the Lords portion is his
People, Jacob is the Cord of his Inheritance, that is, a People peculiar to
himself, and segregated and divided from the World, see Psalm. 16.6. the lines
are fallen unto me in pleasant places, yea, I have a Goodly heritage --. Our
Savior, who is here speaking by the Prophet, uses this Metaphor to express the
Figure or Delineation of the Church, etc. Hence it is said, 2 Cor. 10.15, 16.
Not boasting of things without our Measure, that is, of other men's labors, but
having hope when your Faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you
according to our rule abundantly to preach the Gospel in the Regions beyond
you, and not to boast in another man's line (or Rule) of things made ready to
our hand, where (...) Regula, a Rule, signifies that space Measured by it, as
if God had divided the World among the Apostles, that they should preach in
their particular and respective precincts or allotted places.

[ Money] is put for Property or Estate purchased by Money, Exodus 21.21. for he
is his Money, that is he purchased or bought him with his Money, and is to him
as good as Money.

3. A Thing or Action is put for the Effect produced by that Thing or Action.
THis kind of Metonymie is to be found distinctly in Nouns and Verbs, of which
we are to note, that some are referred hither, (...) or by way of Analogy, in
which as I may speak, there is a (...), connotation, or consignification, that
is, when the Thing or Action is not to be understood strictly for the effect,
but together with its Effect and consequent.

In Nouns; Certain terms which signify [ Affection] are put for their
Effects, as 1 John 3.1. Behold what manner of Love the Father has bestowed
upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God. The Emphasis is great here,
Love.
as if Jehovah had said that he has graciously given us his own very Love,
whilst he adopts us into the privilege of Sonship. By bestowing this blessing
he bestows himself, and makes himself one with us, for he is Love, 1 John. 4.8.

[ Mercy] is put for the Benefit and Commiseration that proceeds from it, Genesis
20.13. and 32.13. Mercy.
I am less then the (or I am not worthy of the) least of thy mercies, 2 Chronicles.
35.16. By the same Trope the Greeks call (...), (...), emosyna, e^^t genus omne
bene^^icii quod in miseros confertur, Beza. The word signifies Mercy and Pity,
therefore all our Alms must proceed from a Merciful and Pitiful heart.
Alms what they give in Charity to the poor Matthew, 6.1. Luke 11.41. Act. 10.2,
4. Motum internum significat, quo inclinentur homines ad miserendum pauperis.
Chamier; That is, It signifies an internal motion by which men are inclined to
pity the poor.

[ Anger] is put for punishment or vengeance which proceeds from Anger, Psalm.
79.6. Pour out thy wrath (or Anger) upon the Heathen, etc. Micah. 7.9. I will
bear the Anger or Indignation of the Lord, etc. Romans 2.5. But after thy
hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thy self Wrath against the day
of Wrath, etc. see Romans 3.5. and 4.15. and 13.4.5. Ephesians. 5.6.

[ Anger] is put for a Command given in Anger, 1 Samuel 28.18. Because thou
obey'dst not the voice of the Lord, nor executed'st his fierce Wrath (or Anger)
upon Amalek, etc.

[ Judgment] is put for Punishment and Castigation or Correction, Exodus 6.6. I
will Redeem you (Israelites) with great Judgments, that is, great punishments
upon Pharaoh, Pro. 19.29. Judgments (that is punishments) are prepared for
Scorners, etc. -- when I send my sore Judgments upon Jerusalem, that is,
punishments, etc. see Ezekiel. 14.21. Romans 2.3. 1 Cor. 11.29. 1 Pet. 4.17. It is
put for Condemnation, Jer. 26.11. John 3.18, 19. 2 Pet. 2.3. In 1 Cor. 11.29.
It is said, he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks
Damnation, but in the Greek it is (...) which signifies Judgment.

[ Sin] with the Synonymous terms is put for the punishment of Sin. Genesis 19.
15. The Angels hastened Lot, saying arise, take thy Wife and thy two Daughters
which are here, lest thou be consumed in the Iniquity of the City, that is, in
the punishment of the City. Psalm. 7.16. his sin (or mischief) shall return upon
his own head, that is, the merited or condign punishment. See Jer. 14.16.
Zach. 14.19.

With a Verb, that signifies to bear or carry, it intimates the Guilt and
Conviction that preceds punishment, which must certainly follow, as Exodus
28.43. Lev. 5.1. and 20.20. and 22.9. Numb. 14.33. Ezekiel. 23.35, 49. and 18.20.
and other places.

[ Work] is put for its reward, Lev. 19.13. the work of him that is hired (so
the Hebrew) shall not abide with thee all night, until the morning. Jer. 22.13.
Rev. 14.13. that they may rest from their Labors, and their works follow them.
Sometimes it is put for the merit of the Work, Romans 11.6. And if by Grace, then
it is no more of Works? otherwise Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of
Works, then it is no more Grace; otherwise work is no more work, here Grace and
Work; that is to say, merit are opposed to each other.

[ Divination] or Augury (...) is put for the Price and Reward of it, Numb.
22.7. And, The (...)
Divinations were in their hands, that is, (as in our Translation) the Rewards
of Divination, which were to be given to Balaam.

Labor is put for the profit or fruit it produces, Deuteronomy. 28.33. All thy
Labors shall a Nation which thou know not, eat up. Psalm, 78, 46. He gave
their labor unto the Locust, Psalm 105.44. They inherited the labor of the
People, Psalm. 128.2. for thou shall eat the labor of thine hands, Pro. 5, 10.
Eccl. 2.19. Isa. 45.14. Jer. 3.24. Ezekiel. 23.29. [ Hunting] is put for Venison,
got by Hunting, Genesis 25. 28. And Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his
Hunting, that is, his Venison, see Genesis 27.3.

So much of Nouns, there are some Metonymies in Verbs as Verbs of Knowing, and
such as betoken Affection or Operation, of which kind are

Verbs that signify to know, which besides the bare (...), or knowing, denote
the motions, affections and effects, that are joined with knowledge, as Psalm.
90. 11. Who knows the power of thine Anger? that is, who considers, or
regards the power of thine Anger? so, as to awake from the sleep of sin, and
seriously to repent? Israel does not know, etc. Isa. 1.3. That is, considers
not, nor takes notice of the Blessings the Lord gave it, Jer. 8.7. Luk 19.41.
John 8 43. Why do ye not know my Speech, that is, approve it, and with a
faithful Assent receive it? The Answer of Christ (giving the reason of this,)
follows, viz. even because ye cannot hear my words, that is, so understand
them, as to Embrace and close with them, for through the Devils blinding of
you, and your wilful choice, ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lust of
your Father ye will do.

[ To know] is put for approbation, as Romans 7.15. For that which I do, I know
not, that is, (as our Translation has it) allow not, Rev. 2.24. But unto you I
say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this Doctrine, and
which have not known the Depths of Satan (that is, have not approved of his
Snares and deep Temptations.) To be [ Conscious] signifies more then barely to
know, which differ as much as Knowledge and Conscience, as Psalm. 35.11. False
Witnesses did rise up, and they asked me things that I knew not, that is, of
which I am no ways conscious to my self, as Psalm. 51.3. because I know mine
Iniquities, and my sin is ever before me. Where the Prophet includes the terror
of Conscience, and serious Contrition, 2 Cor. 5.21. It is said, He (that is,
God the Father) has made him, (that is Christ) to be sin for us, who knew no
sin; that is who was not guilty of any sin, for he was most perfectly holy, and
without sin -- So that he was made sin in this sense, viz. The Father imputed
our sins to him according to Esa. 53.6. And the Lord has laid on him the
iniquity of us all, or has made the iniquities of us all to meet on him, etc.

[ To Know,] Is put for Estimation, or Judgment of any thing with respect to
its value or worth, as 2 Cor. 5.16. Henceforth know we no man after the Flesh,
that is, we do not value or esteem any man for external things, as Riches,
Poverty, Honor, Disgrace, legal Privileges, etc. -- After which follows, Yea
though we have known Christ after the Flesh, yet now henceforth we know him,
(viz. that way) no more; he speaks of the Estimation of Christ carnally or in a
fleshly way, viz. in that state of humility, wherein he was placed, during his
sojourning here -- For in that respect we shall know him no more, but in his
state of Exaltation, Grace, and Glory, we shall know, that is, value, esteem,
and prize him; not for any legal Derivation, or Pedigree, with respect to his
humane Nature, but, because he is the great Savior and Intercessor exalted to
Glory at the right hand of the Father, from whom we expect our great and
glorious Deliverance, etc. To this belongs that phrase, Prove. 24.23. It is not
good to know the face in Judgment; in which is a Prosopolepsia.
(...), viz. a respecting of Persons, or an Estimation or Judgment by external
appearance without respect to equity; as ver. 24. He that says unto the wicked
thou art Righteous, him shall the People Curse, etc. that is, from a (...), or
a partial respect of persons, whereas we are advised, Prove. 25.21. If thine
Enemy be Hungry, give him bread to Eat: And if he be thirsty, give him water to
drink -- For thou shall heap Coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall
Reward thee; This is a right Gospel Spirit, because it is so far from a
Revengeful retaliation, that it commands Good for Evil.

That which is said by Moses in his publication of the Commands of God, Deuteronomy.
1.17. viz. Ye shall not know faces in Judgment (so the hebrew) Deuteronomy. 16.19.
Thou shall not wrest Judgment, thou shall not know persons, and Job 34.19. That
accepts not (or knows not) the persons of Princes, nor regards the rich
more then the poor, is a speech of Jehovah, and agrees with Acts 10.34. Of a
truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, etc.

2. Verbs of Cognition, or knowledge also concern the Will and Affections of
the Heart. And so to know is to Love, cherish, and take care for, etc. As Exodus
1.8. And there arose a new King, which knew not Joseph, that is, he regarded
him not, nor the good Acts which he had done in the Kingdom, the Chaldee says,
One that did not confirm the decree of Joseph, So Genesis 39.6. Jud. 2.10. Prove.
12.10. and 29.7. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12. In other places (...) to know is of the same
signification as Deuteronomy. 33.9. Ruth 2.10, 19. Psalm. 142.4, 5.

By a special and singular manner of the Holy Spirits speaking. The phrase [ to
know] is attributed to God, which denotes his special Providence, Love and
Paternal Care, as Exodus 2.25. And God looked upon the Children of Israel, and
God knew them, that is (as we translate it) he had respect unto them, 1 Chronicles.
17.18. Psalm. 1.5, 6. and 37.17, 18. Jer. 1.5. and 24.5. Amos 3.2. (see Deuteronomy.
4.20.) John 10.27. 1 Cor. 8.3. 2. Tim. 2.19. etc.

This term [ to know] denotes also a trust and hearty confidence, ((...),) or a
certain persuasion, faith or assurance, given by the Holy Spirit to men endued
with a saving faith, as Job 19.25. I know that my Redeemer lives, that is, I
have an absolute faith and confidence that it is so, and acquiesce in it, etc.

To know the Name of the Lord, is by true faith to adhere to him, Psalm. 9.10.
For they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee. To know the Lord, is
to believe and hope in him, Jer. 9.24. and 31.24. Hosea 2.20. John 17.3. etc.
This is the knowledge by which many shall be justified, Esa. 53.11. The
knowledge of Salvation, Luke 1.77. (...).
The knowledge of the Truth which is after Godliness, Tit. 1.1.

3. The very work or act, When [ to know] is put for [ to be able] or the
interior faculty of operation, which is the principle of Actions, Esa. 56.10,
11. His Watchmen are greedy Dogs which can never have enough, (the hebrew says,
which knew not fullness) Shepherds that cannot understand, or as the hebrew has
it, that knew not to understand; the meaning is, that for their Covetousness,
they cannot be satisfied, and for their blindness, and want of skill, cannot
apprehend Divine things Aright.

It is said Matthew. 7.11. If ye then being Evil (...).
know how to give Good things unto your Children, etc. That is, ye can (or are
able) notwithstanding your natural Wickedness, do good to your own. This Trope
is very frequent also in the Latin Tongue, etc.

It is put for an Experimental sense of a Fact done, Mark 5.29. (...), etc. et
scivit corpore, and she knew in her body, (in our Translation it is, she felt in
her body) that she was healed of that plague. Hence by the same Trope or manner
of speaking, it is said of Christ verse 30. And Jesus (...), cognoscens in
semetipso) knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, that is feeling
and experiencing it.

1 Cor. 4.19. I will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the
Power, that is, I will experience how strong they are in the Faith, what zeal
they have, and how powerfully the Holy Spirit has influenced them.

More especially, by the term knowing, Conjugal Society is noted, as Genesis 4.1.
and 19.5, 8. Numb. 31.17. Matthew. 1.25. Luke 1.34. This was common with the
Greeks and Latins, as Plut. in Alex. Neque aliam (...) cognoscebat mulierem,
that is, he knew no other Woman. Horat. Ignara mariti, ignorant of a Husband.

[ To Remember] Is put for the Will and Desire, Heb. 11, 15. If they had
Remembered that Country from whence they came, they Might have had opportunity
to have Returned, that is, if they had a mind or Desire to have Returned
thither etc. which exposition is cleared in the following verse, viz. But now
they desire a better Country, that is, an heavenly. See Isa. 44.21. Joh. 2.7.
So Cant. 1.4. We will Remember thy love more then Wine, that is, by true Faith
and sincere Love, we will cleave to thee for the great Affection thou have
vouchsafed us, which we esteem above all that's delightsome and precious (for
such things are synecdochically noted by Wine) in this World; For the upright
love thee, that is, the Regenerate sons of God, who truly know, and love
Christ, and in Life follow him,) 2 Timothy 2..8, 19. Luke 22.19. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.
In a word, to Remember Christ is in a due and faithful sense and apprehension
to be united to him, and to live to him alone, whereas on the contrary,

Oblivisci Jebovae cordis contumaciam Infidelitatem and impietatem importat.
[ To forget God] Imports Unbelief, wickedness and Stubbornness of Heart, as
Hosea 4.6. My People are destroyed for lack of knowledge: Because thou have
rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shall be no Priest to
me; seeing thou have forgotten the Law of thy God, I will also forget thy
Children. See 2 Pet. 1.9. Jam. 1.25. Ezekiel. 22.12, etc.

Sometimes to Remember signifies a consequent speech, or an external real
effect, as Esth. 2.1. Ahasuerus Remembered Vashti, when by the second verse it
is evident that he was discoursing of her with his Ministers. Ezekiel. 23.19. Yet
she multiplied her VVhoredoms in calling to mind the days of her youth, etc.
that is, both calls to mind, and in that very act exercising her former
spiritual Whoredom. In what sense Remembrance and Oblivion are attributed to
God, will be seen hereafter.

[ Verbs of Affections] as [ to love] or [ to hate] are put for the actions
themselves, which either really or according to the custom or opinions of men
are the Results of such Affections -- The verbs odi and diligo, to hate and
love, do sometimes denote contrary Affections.

1. To love signifies seeking and desiring as Luke 11.43. ye love, (that is ye
seek or desire) the uppermost seats, etc. John 3.39. and 12.43. 2 Timothy 4.8.

It Is put for ( to be wont) as Matthew. 6.5. Hypocrites love (that is, they are
wont) to pray standing.

See Psalm. 11.5. Prove. 21.17. 2 Timothy 4.10. Demas has forsaken me, ((...))
having loved this present World, which Erasmus well renders has embraced this
present world; that is, Demas would not be a Companion of sufferers, but his
desire, and seeking was to have good and happy days in this World.

2. [ To Love] signifies to prefer, regard, or take care of one thing more then
another. To which [ to hate] is opposed, which signifies disregard, less care,
and neglect of one thing more then another, as Genesis 29.31. with verse 30. John
12.25. He that loves his ( In the Greek it is (...), etc. that is, he that
loves his soul, etc. and hates his soul, etc.
Life) shall lose it; and he that hates his ( In the Greek it is (...), etc.
that is, he that loves his soul, etc. and hates his soul, etc.
Life) in this world shall keep it unto Eternal Life. This is expressed, Matthew.
16.25. Thus, For whosoever will save his Life, (in the Greek it is, his Soul)
shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his Life (or Soul) for my sake, shall
find it. By the phrase ( to Love his Soul,) is meant a will and resolution to
preserve Life, even by the denial or abnegation of the Name of Christ. And ( to
hate his Soul) signifies, that in comparison of the Name, Profession, and Truth
of Christ, the preservation of this Life is a thing not at all valued, but that
we are ready rather then deny him to suffer even unto Death.

It is said Luke 14.26. If any man come unto me, and hate not his Father, and
Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Sisters, yea and his own Soul
((...)) also, he cannot be my Disciple. This Text does not enjoin us to hate
our Relations (for we are Commanded to Love even our Enemies, Matthew. 5.44. Luke
6.27.) But the meaning is, that he that can or will prefer the comfort of
Society of his Natural Relations before Christ and his Gospel is not worthy to
be his Disciple. See Psalm. 109.16, 17. Prove. 8.36. and 17.19. and 13.24.

3. It notes a declaration of an external Gesture, which is wont to be the
result of Love, as Mark 10.21. Then Jesus beholding him loved him (...), which
signifies not that Christ approved his answer, or had therefore any singular or
peculiar respect for him, but, (as it were) sweetly smiled upon him, looking
upon his talk to be childish and ridiculous, even as we smile upon Children,
when they prattle of such things as are in themselves simple.

[ Verbs of Operation] as [ to do] are put for acquisition or gain, which is
the effect of Action and Labor, as Genesis 12.5. The Souls they had made in
Charan, that is, acquired or gotten there. Genesis 30.30. And now when shall I
Quando faciam ego pro domo mea.
make for my house also? that is, when shall I provide or take care to get so
much as will be sufficient for my Family. Hence it is said, Matthew. 25.16. Then
he that had received the five Talents went and traded with the same, (...).
and made them other five Talents, that is, (...), he gained them, as verses
17, 20, 22. it is expounded.

[ To Judge,] besides its proper signification, denotes also the Consequent
actions, as Castigation and Punishment, Genesis 15.14. 2 Chronicles. 20.12. Psalm.
9.19.20. Acts 7.7. Heb. 13.4. Condemnation John 3.18. Romans 14.3. Freeing,
Delivering or Absolving, Psalm. 35.24. Romans 6, 7. etc.

The Matter of which a thing is made, is put for the thing made.
THE [ FIRR-TREE] of which Lances were made is put for lances, Nah. 2.3. The
Firr-trees shall be terribly shaken. It Is put for Musical Instruments, 2 Samuel
6.5. And David and all the House of Israel played before the Lord on all
Firr-wood, (so the hebrew) that is, as in our Translation, on all instruments
made of firr-wood, as the following words show, viz. on Harps, and on
Psalteries, and on Timbrels, and on Cornets, and on Cymbals.

[ Brass] is put for Fetters or Shackles made of Brass, Lam. 3.7. ^^aes me^^m
fecit aggravari.
He has made my Brass heavy, that is my chain, or fetters, whereby my legs are
shackled. See Judge. 16.21. 2 Samuel 3.34. Ezekiel. 24.11. and 16.36.

You may see more Examples, Psalm. 68.30. 2 Samuel 7.2. Jermiah. 4.20. Habak. 3.7.

[ Gold and Silver] are put for things made of them, 1 Chronicles. 29.2. Psalm.
115.4. Their Idols are Silver and Gold, Ubicunque Auro and Argento (quae
nomina, ut and reliquorum metallorum, apud Hebraeos, plurali carent) numeralia
nomina juncta leguntur, pro siclis ejusdem Metalli usurpantur. Junius in Genesis
24.22.
that is, made of Silver and Gold.

2. For Money or Current Coin, Genesis 23.9, 16. Genesis 24.22. 2 Kings 5.5. 1 Chro.

21.14. I will kindle a Fire in the Forest thereof, that is, in the House of
Jehovah, In the House of the King, and in the Houses of the Nobles, which were
built of precious materials brought from the Forest of Lebanon, Jer. 22.7. 2
Kings 25.9. 2 Chronicles. 36.19. Jer. 52.13. etc.

CHAP. II. Of a Metonymie of the Effect.
A Metonymie of the Effect is, when the Effect is put for the Efficient Cause,
which is done three ways, as, 1. When the Action or the Effect is put for the
Author or Person effecting. 2. When a thing Effected by an instrument, is put
for the Instrument or Organical Cause. 3. When the Effect is put for the thing
or action Effecting.


1. The Action or Effect is put for the Author or person Effecting.
AS Genesis 15.1. I am (says Jehovah to Abraham) thy exceeding great Reward, that
is, I am a most liberal giver of Reward, Deuteronomy. 30.20. He is thy Life and length
of Days, that is, he is the Cause of it, Genesis 49.18. I have waited for thy
Salvation, that is, the promised Messiah, the Author of Salvation, as Luke
2.30. Where Simeon says, Mine eyes have seen thy Salvation, that is Christ.
(...).
All flesh shall see (...) the Salvation of God, that is, a Savior, See Esa.
49.6. etc. Psalm. 3.3, 4. and 106.20. and 27.1. Thou art my Light, Salvation,
Strength, etc. that is, the Author and Cause of them; so Psalm. 18.2. and 22.20.
and 33.20. and 46.2. Jer. 16.19. and 23.6. John 11.25. and 14.6. 1 Cor. 1.30.
Ephesians. 2.14. 1 John 5.20. And Heb. 5.9. Romans 15.5, 13. 2 Cor. 1.3. Luke 1.50.

Luke 11.14. And he (viz. Jesus) was casting out a Devil, and it was Dumb; that
is, he made the man (in whom he was,) dumb, or suffered him not to speak, and
so was the cause of dumbness. See Matthew. 9.32, 33. and Mark 9.17, 25. Luke
13.11.

It is said, Genesis 26.35. That Esaus wives were a grief of mind (or as the
hebrew says, bitterness of Spirit) unto Isaac and Rebecca, that is the Cause of
sadness and trouble of Spirit. See Genesis 25.23. Nehem. 12.31. Romans 13.3. Rulers
are not a terror (that is a cause of terror) to good men. 2 Cor. 1.14. we are
your rejoicing, as ye are ours -- (the Greek is (...), which signifies glorying
or boasting) that is, (...), timor.
the cause of your rejoicing or glorying, inasmuch as we instructed you in the
Gospel which is the way of Salvation, and you likewise are our glory, inasmuch
as we have won you to Christ, 1 Thessalonians. 2.19, 20. Romans 5.2.

2. When a thing Effected by an Instrument, is put for the Instrument or
Organical Cause.
GLory is put for the Tongue, Psalm. 16.9. My Heart is glad and my glory
rejoices, that is, my Tongue, because it is the Organ by which God is (and
ought to be) gloryfied, suitable to Acts 2.26. Therefore did my heart Rejoice
and my Tongue was glad. See Psalm. 30.12, 13. and 5.7, 9.

[ Power] is put for the Organ exerting power, as Romans 1.16. The Gospel is
((...)) the power of God unto Salvation to every one that Beleiveth, that is,
the Gospel is the means or organ by which God exerts or puts forth the power of
his Salvation to Beleivers, Ephesians. 1.19.

[ Victory] is put for the Instrument of overcoming, as 1 John 5.4. This is the
victory that overcomes the world, even your Faith -- that is, the Instrument
of victory, Ephesians. 6.16.

Life is put for the means of its preservation, Deuteronomy. 24.26. No man shall take
the nether or the upper Millstone to pledge, for he takes a man's Life (or (...)
Soul) to pledge, (...) Nephesh.
that is the Instruments that are necessary for the preservation of Life Prove.
7.27. Life is put for food or maintenance, Luke 15.12. He divided unto them,
((...) his Life,) that is his Estate, or as we translate it, (his living)
Hesiod lib. 2. calls money the soul of a man.

(...). 3. When the Effect is put for the Thing or Action Effecting.
THis Species of a Metonymie is distinctly found in Nouns and Verbs, as when
the Effect is put for the cause materially, as 2 Kings 4.10. There is death in
the pot -- that is, deadly poison, which will cause Death. So Death is put for
great perils and dangers, troubles or Calamities which cause Death. Exodus
10.17. Romans 7.24. 2 Cor. 1.10. and 11.23. And for the Plague, Rev. 6.8. See
Prove. 11.23. Jer. 3.24. Shame is put for an Idol, Jer. 11.13. Hos. 9.10. The
reason of the Name you may see Jer. 48.13. And Moab shall be ashamed of Kemosh,
as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence. See Ezekiel. 44.18.
Hosea 12.1. Ephraim daily increases lies and desolation, that is, he commits
such evils, that nothing can be expected but Desolation and Calamity.

See more Examples, Lam. 2.14. 1 Cor. 12.6, 8. 1 Cor. 14.3. He that
Prophecyeth, speaks unto men So the Greek (...), etc.
Edification, and Exhortation, and Comfort, that is an Edifying, Exhorting, and
Comforting speech.

Sometimes the Effect is put formally for the Cause. as Deuteronomy. 30.15. I have set
before thee this day, Life and Good, Death and Evil, that is, I have clearly
showed, and laid before thee what is the cause and original of each, or for
what cause and reason, either of these was to come upon thee, viz. To Love and
obey God brings Life and Good; but Rebellion, Sin, and Disobedience brings
Death and Evil, as the following verses make evident. This is called, Jer.
21.8. The way of Life and Death. See more Deuteronomy. 32.47. Prove. 19.3. and 20.1.
Esa. 28.12. This is rest, that is, the Cause of rest, or the way and manner of
arriving to it. Hosea 4.18. Their drink is sour (or gone) that is, their cause
of recess from God, or that which made them backslide, as verse 11. Whoredom
and Wine, and New Wine take away the Heart. Which words, (viz. take away the
Heart) are Emphatical, for they denote that they were (as it were) wallowing in
these Evils, when they gave themselves to Whoredom and Drunkenness. They saw
and knew what was better, Video Meliora, proboque Deteriora sequor. Ovid.
and approved them, but they followed the worse, and so the Devil keeps them
that are drowned in these Wickednesses (as it were) Captives, 2 Timothy 2.26. for
the hebrew word here, is used when they speak of such as such as are taken and
detained by force, Genesis 14.11, 12. Josh. 11.19, 23, etc. Micah 1.5. What is the
Transgression of Jacob? Is not Samaria? And what are the High Places of Judah?
Are they not Jerusalem? That is, as Kimchi (in lib. Radicum) expounds it, what
was the Cause of the defection of Jacob? Was it not the Cities of Samaria, etc.
See Hab. 2.5. John 3.19. And this is the Judgment or Condemnation, that is, the
cause of it, John 12.50. And I know that his Commandment is Life Everlasting;
that is, the Cause or Organ by which Everlasting Life is obtained, for he
speaks of saving knowledge by the Gospel, Romans 7.7. Is the Law sin, that is,
the Cause of sin in or by it self? So Romans 8.6. For to be carnally minded is
Death: But to be Spiritually minded is Life and Peace, that is, the cause of
Death, and the Cause of Life and Peace, as verse 10. See Phil. 1.13. Heb. 6.1.
and 19. 14. and Romans 6.23.

[ In Verbs,] To JOY and REJOICE, are put for to be freed, or delivered from
Evil, and to be or do well, which is the Cause of Joy, Psalm. 70.4. Let all
those that seek thee Rejoice, and be glad in thee -- that is, let them be freed
from all evil, that they may have cause of Joy. The Cause and Effect are
joined, Psalm. 5.11, 12, 13. To be Ashamed and Confounded signifies a falling
into calamities, and be exposed to violence which is the Cause of Confusion,
Psalm. 25.1, 2. and 3.19, 20. and 31.1, 2. and 119.115, 116, etc.

[ To please] signifies good behavior and honest respect, which is the cause
of complacency, as Romans 15.2. Let every one of us please his Neighbor for good
to edification. See Erasmus upon the place, 1 Cor. 10.33.

[ Have or Flight] is put for Shame and Confusion, Esa. 28.16. He that
beleiveth shall not make have, that is, he shall not be confounded, as Romans
9.33. and 10.11. 1 Pet. 2.6. The Effect and Consequence of Confusion is flight,
or a hasty getting away from the sight of men -- This also signifies calamities
and punishments as limited before. See Psalm. 74.15. Esa. 28.28. Eccl. 11.1. Job
28.5. Psalm. 104. 13, 14. Esa. 47.2. and 33.12. Josh. 11.8. and 13.6.

CHAP. III. Of a Metonymie of the Subject.
THIS kind of Metonymie shall be handled under five Heads.

1. More generally when the Recipient, or receiving Subject is put for the
Adjunct. 2. More especially, when the thing Containing is put for the thing
Contained, or Place for the thing Placed. 3. When the Possessor is put for the
thing Possessed. 4. When the Occupant Object or Subject is put for that which
it is concerned about. 5. When the thing Signed is put for the Sign.
1. The Recipient or Receiving Subject is put for the Adjunct.
THE HEART is put for Wisdom, (where the Scripture tells us the seat of Wisdom
is) as Prove. 2.10. and 11.29. and 15.14. and 16.21. Prove. 6.32. Who so
commits Adultery with a Woman, lacks a Heart, (so the hebrew is) that is-
lacks Wisdom and Understanding. See Prou. 7.7. and 9.4, 16. and 10.13, 21. In
which places by the phrase (wanting a Heart) is to be understood of an unwise
person or a fool, by which words the Scripture expresses unbeleiving and Wicked
men, as Prove. 8.5. O ye simple understand subtilty, and ye fools understand an
Heart (so the hebrew) that is, wisdom. Prove. 15.32. He that hears reproof
possesses (or acquireth) an Heart, that is, (as the Chaldee renders it)
Wisdom. See Prove. 28.26. He that trusts in his own heart is a fool, that is,
he that depends on or confides in his own understanding and prudence, or he
that is wise in his own Eyes, as Esa. 5.21. So Hos. 7.11. and 4.11.

The [ Heart and Reins] are put for inward thoughts and affections, Psalm.
73.20, 21. and 51.7, 8. Prove. 23.16. God searches the Heart and Reins, Psalm.
7.9, 10. and 26.1, 2. Jer. 11.20. and 17.10. and 20.12, This is to be (...) as

It Is put for the desires of the soul expressed in Prayer, as Psalm. 62.8. Pour
out your heart before him, that is, the desires of your heart, Lam. 2.19.

2. The Thing Containing is put for the Thing Contained, and Place for thing
Placed.
MOunt Carmel is put for the Trees there Jer. 46.18. As Carmel by Sea, that is,
as the Trees of Mount Carmel are drawn by Sea, so shall he lead them Captives:
So says Rab. Kimhi, blessed be thy basket, Deuteronomy. 28.5. That is the meat or
provision in it. A Desert is put for the wild Beasts there, Psalm. 29.8. with
Deuteronomy. 8.15. A House is put for the Family, Children, and Domestics, Genesis 7.1.
Come thou and all thy House into the Ark. 2 Samuel 7.11. The Lord tells thee
that he will make them an House, that is, give thee an offspring or posterity
to possess the Royal Dignity, 1 Chronicles. 10.6. Psalm. 49.12. Luke 19.9. etc. It
is also put for a People or Tribe sprung from any Family, as Exodus 2.1. Ezekiel.
3.1. and 27. 14. etc.

[ Islands] are put for their Inhabitants, and so for the Gentiles which
possessed all the Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, Esa. 41.1, 5. Keep silence
before me O Islands -- The Isles saw it and feared, etc. See Esa. 42.4. The
Isles shall wait for his Law, Esa. 51.5. The Isles shall wait upon me.

The [ Sea] is put for Maritine Inhabitants, or Seamen that dwelt near the
shore. Ezekiel. 26.17. How art thou destroyed that wast inhabited of the Seas (so
the hebrew) So Esa. 60.5. The abundance of the Sea shall be converted unto
thee, that is, the Gentiles which dwell near the Sea, as the following words
show. See Hag. 2.7, 8. Deuteronomy. 33.19. They shall suck the abundance of the Seas,
that is Goods and Merchandise brought by Sea.

A [ Table] is put for Meat. Psalm. 23.4, 5. Psalm. 78.19. A Mountain for
Mountainous places, Josh. 13.6. Judges 7.24. etc. Mountains and Hills are put
for Idols, which were Worshipped there, Jer. 3.23. Mountains and Valleys for
their Inhabitants, Micah. 1.4. The Mountains shall be Molten under him, and the
Valleys shall be Cleft -- that is, the Hearts of those that inhabit them shall
wax soft. See Psalm. 68.2, 3. and Psalm. 97.4, 5. They put to flight the Valleys
toward the East, and toward the West, that is, such as dwelt in the Valleys, 1 Chronicles. 12.15.

The [ World] is put for Mankind, John 3.16. and 12.19. 2 Cor. 5.19. 1 John
2.2. and 5.19. It Is put for the wicked who are the greatest part of mankind,
John 1.10. and 7.7. and 14.17. and 15.19. and 16.20, 23 and 17.9, 14. 1 Cor.
11.32. 1 John 3.1. and 4.5. and 5.4, 5. Hence the Devil is called the Prince of
this world, John 12.31. and 14.30. and 16.11. (...) Princes of the world, Ephesians.
6.12. The God of this world, 2. Cor. 4.4. Which is expounded, Ephesians. 2.2. In time
past ye walked according to this world, according to the Prince of the Power of
the Air, the Spirit that Now works in the Children of Disobedience.

The [ World] is put sometimes for those are converted and believe, as
Illyricus says alleging John 6.33. The Bread of God is he which comes down
from Heaven, and gives Life unto the world, that is, to beleivers, and John
14.31. But that the world may know that I love the Father, etc. Yet Glassius
thinks that the whole race of mankind is rather to be understood in both
places, as verse 51. the Bread which I will give is my Flesh, which I will give
for the life of the World, for this giving of Life, is not an actual conferring
of it by Faith, but rather an acquisition or purchase of life for them, in
which sense Christ is called the light that enlightens every man that comes
into the world. In the other text, John 14.31. Christ signifies by those words,
that he was therefore to die, that he might deliver mankind from the power of
Satan. (2.) That this Redemption of mankind should, by the Word of the Gospel
be revealed to the whole World. For he says not, let me die that I may show
that I love the Father, but that the World may know that I love the Father.
Which knowledge was had, when the Gospel was promulgated through the whole
World by the Apostles.

Camerarius in his Notes on John 17.21. That the World may believe that thou
have sent me, says, that by (...) the world we are to understand, (...) Such as
shall be saved -- But Glassius says, that it signifies all men universally, as
John 3.17. For God sent his Son that the world through him might be saved --
For though all men are not actually saved, in regard of their proper contumacy
and impenitency, yet a spiritual Unity for believers is prayed for, and that
the World might believe, that is, that all men should be converted to the true
knowledge of the Messiah, although very many remain in Unbelief and Wickedness,
who shall have no share in this Redemption.

[ Ships] are put for the Men in them, Esa. 23.1. Howl ye Ships of Tarshish,
that is, ye Mariners and Merchants, etc. So verses 10.14.

[ A Nest] is put for the Young ones, Deuteronomy. 32.11. As an Eagle stirs up her
Nest, that is, the Young Eagles, as is clearly showed in the following words.

[ Ophir] (A Country in India abounding with Gold) is put for Gold brought from
thence, Job 22.24. Then shall thou lay up Gold as Dust, and Ophir as the Stones
of the Brooks, that is, Gold brought from Ophir; Abundance of Gold is denoted
by the whole phrase, and Metaphorically, great felicity.

A [ Cup] is put for the Wine or Liquor in it, Jer. 49.12. Ezekiel. 23.32. 1 Cor.
10.21. Ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord and the Cup of Devils. Luke 22.17.
It is said in the last Paschal Supper, And he took the Cup and gave thanks, and
said take this, and divide it amongst your selves, that is, the Wine not the
Cup; for verse 18 he says, I will not drink of the fruit of the Vine, until
the Kingdom of God shall Come, So Luke 22.20. We have the same Metonymie, about
the Eucharistical Cup of the Lords Supper, and 1 Cor. 11.25, 26, 27. Of this
Cup Christ says, that it is the New Testament in his Blood, but the containing
vessel cannot be understood, but the thing contained, viz. The Wine, which is
Sacramentally the Blood of Christ, Matthew. 26.28. Mark 14.24. See more 1 Cor.
10.16, 21. 1 Cor. 11.26, 27. Matthew. 26, 27. Mark 14.23. 1 Cor. 11.28.

[ The Names of Countries] is frequently put for their Inhabitants, as Egypt
for Egyptians, Genesis 17.15. Ps. 105.38. Ethiopia, for Ethiopians, Ps. 68.31, 32
Sheba for Sabeans, Job 1.15. and 6.19. See Esa. 43.3, 4. Judea and the adjacent
Countries about Jordan, are put for their Inhabitants, Matt. 3.5. Macedonia and
Achaia for Christians living there, Romans 11.26. The Land of Egypt is put for
spoils brought from thence, Jer. 43.12.

[ The Grave] is put for the Dead that are buried in it, as Esa. 38.18. The
Grave cannot praise thee, Death cannot celebrate thee, that is, they that are
Dead and Buried, the reason follows, They that go down into the Pit cannot hope
for thy Truth, ver. 19. The Living, the Living, he shall praise thee. See Psalm.
6.6. Psalm. 115.117. [ The Earth] is put for the Inhabitants of the Earth, Genesis
6.11. The Earth was also corrupt before God, and the Earth was filled with
violence, which is expounded in the next verse, for all flesh had corrupted his
way upon the Earth. So Genesis 11.1. and 18.25. and 19.31. and 14.30. 1 Samuel
14.29. 2 Samuel 15.23. Prove. 28.2. Esa. 24.20. Matthew. 5.13. [ The Ends of the
Earth] are put for the Inhabitants of the extremest parts thereof, Psalm.
22.27, 28. Psalm. 67.8. A [ Theatre] (the place where Plays and Shows are seen)
is put for the sight it self, 1 Cor. 4.9. Where the Apostle Paul Metaphorically
says of himself, For we are made a Theater (so the Greek) unto the World, and
to Angels, and to Men -- As if he had said, we are derided, hated and abused by
the World, and that not in a corner, but as if the whole Earth were gathered
together in one Theater to satiate and please themselves with beholding our
miseries.

A [ City] is put for Citizens, Jer. 4.29. The whole City shall flee -- Shall
go into Thickets, and clime upon the Rocks. So Esa. 14.31. Jer. 26.2. etc.
Jerusalem, Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum are put for their Inhabitants, Matthew.
3.5. Mark 1.5. Matthew. 23.37. and 11.21, 23. Act. 18.25. Jud. 5.7.11. etc.

To this by Analogy may be referred these that follow.

[ Heaven] is put for God, who is said to dwell in the Heavens, and there
manifests his Glory and Majesty to Angels and glorified Spirits, Psalm. 73.9.
They set their Mouth against the Heavens and their Tongue walks through the
Earth, that is, they licentiously vent their blasphemies against God, and
contumelious words against Mankind. See more Examples in Dan. 4.23. with verse
22. and 29. 1 King 8.32. Matthew. 21.25. The Baptism of John whence is it? from
Heaven or of Men? that is, from God, or men, So Luke 20.4. Luke 15.18. Father I
have sinned against Heaven, that is, against God.

[ The Heart] is put for the Soul, which is radically in the Heart as its
proper seat, Psalm. 24.3, 4. and 84.3. 1 Pet. 3.4. Heb. 13.9. etc. The [ Belly]
is put for the Heart, which (viz. heart) is likewise put for the Soul and its
acts and cogitations, Job 15.35. Prove. 18.8. and 20.27. and 26.22. and 22.18.
Hab. 3.16. John 7.38.

3. The Possessor is put for the thing possessed.
GENESIS 15.3. Behold the Son of mine house So the Hebrew.
inherits me, that is, my Goods and Estate, Deuteronomy. 9, 1. To possess Nations
greater and mightier then thy self, that is, the Countries of the Gentiles, for
the People themselves were not to be possessed but cut off by the Command of
God, as verse 2, 3. See 2 Samuel 8.2. Psalm. 79.7. For they have devoured Jacob,
that is, his Riches and Goods.

The [ Prince] is put for his Jurisdiction, Matthew. 2.7. And thou Bethlehem in
the Land of Juda, art not the least among the Princes of Juda, that is the
Principalities or Prefectures of Juda, who were distinguished by thousands, as
1 Samuel 10.19.

The [ Name] of God is put for Oblations offered to him, as Josh. 13.33. The
Lord God of Israel was their Inheritance, (viz. the Levites,) which is
expounded, verse 14. Only unto the Tribe of Levi he gave no Inheritance, the
Sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel made by fire are their Inheritance, etc.
and Josh. 18.7. The Priesthood of the Lord is their (the Levites) Inheritance
-- Deuteronomy. 10.9. The Lord is his Inheritance. etc. See Ezekiel. 44.28.

[ Christ] is put for the Church (or believers who are his peculiar People,
Tit. 2.14. 1 Pet. 2.9.) Matthew. 25.35. For I was an hungered and ye gave me meat,
etc. says Christ and verse 40. Act^^ 20.^^. Phil. ^^.12. Ps. 16.6. (...). 5.30,
32.
It is thus expounded, In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of
th^^se my Brethren, ye have done it unto me. Acts 9.4, 5. Saul, Saul, why
pers^^cutest thou me? I am Jesus whom thou persecutest, whereas verse 1, 2. It
is said that Saul persecuted the Disciples of Christ. So 1 Cor. 12.12. So also
is Christ, that is, his Church, has many Members, and many Believers do
constitute one Body of Christ, or one Church, for it follows, v. 13. For by one
Spirit are we all baptized into one Body, Christ therefore is put for his
Mystical Body, or which is the same thing, that which properly belongs to a
body is attributed to Christ, because of his Mystical Union with Believers. For
the same Reason the Afflictions of Christ are called the Afflictions of the
Saints, Col. 1.24. Upon which place Lyranus says thus, The Passions or
sufferings of Christ are twofold, one he endured in his own proper Body, as
Hunger, Thirst, yea even Death, and in this sense there was nothing to be
filled up -- The other he suffers in his Members who are Believers, when they
are persecuted, afflicted, and oppressed for his sake. And this is the meaning
of the Apostle here when he says, who Now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and
fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Christ in my Flesh for his
Bodies sake which is the Church.

4. The Object is put for That which it is Conversant about.
CHrist Jesus is put for his Doctrine, 2 Cor. 11.4. For if he that comes
Preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, that is, another better
Doctrine of Christ, which he calls another Gospel, etc. Ephesians. 4.20. But ye have
not so learned Christ; If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by
him, as the Truth is in Jesus etc. This is to be understood of the Doctrine of
Christ.

[ God] is put for Worship appointed for his Honor, as Exodus 32.1. And they
(that is the Israelites) said unto him (viz. Aaron) up, make us (...) Gods,
that is, as Brentius, Gerhard, and others expound it, Institue nobis publica
sacra, etc. Brent. (...). in loc. Gerrhard. To^^. 3. lo^^or. de lege dei S. 92.
Institute some public form of Worship for us, or some visible sign of Gods
presence (as afterward was the Tabernacle, the Ark and Mercy Seat, Exodus
40.34, 35. Numb. 7.84.) possibly some such thing as they had seen in Egypt; for
now they were turned in their Hearts to Egypt, Acts 7.39, 40.

[ Glory and Strength] are put for the Praise and Celebration of Glory and
Strength, as Psalm. 69.1. Give unto the Lord Glory and Strentgh, that is, give
him the Praise of his Glory and Strength. See Psalm. 8.2. Out of the Mouths of
Babes and Sucklings, have thou ordained Strength, that is, the Praise and
Celebration of his Strength and Omnipotency, as it is expounded, Matthew. 21.16.
So Psalm 96. 6, 7. verses.

[ Sin] is put for Sacrifice or Sin-offering, Exodus 29.14. The Flesh of the
Bullock, etc. Thou shall not burn without the Camp, it is a sin: (so the
Hebrew) that is, (as our Translation renders it) a Sin-offering, Hosea 4.8.
They Eat up the sin of my People, that is, the Sacrifice, or sin-offering, for
sin has a threefo^^d acceptance. (1.) It signifies the Transgression of Gods
Law, 1 John 3.4. vid. Burr. on Hosea.
(2.) Punishment for sin, he shall bear his sin, Lev. 20.20. and 29. and 24.15.
Numb. 9.13. and 18. 22. Ezekiel 23, 49. (3.) Sacrifice offered for sin, Lev.
10.17. Why do you not eat the sin of the holy place, (for so the words are to
be read, that is, the sin-offering. In this sense that text is to be
understood, 2 Cor. 5.21. Christ was made sin for us, that is a sin-offering,
according to Isa. 53.10. If thou shall make his Soul Sin delictum, reatus.
(...) Our Translation renders it, when thou shall make his soul an offering
for sin; explained, Ephesians. 5.2. Christ has given himself for us an offering and
a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor: For he is the true propitiatory
sacrifice for our sins whom the old Typical oblations adumbrated or shadowed
forth.

That phrase of the Apostle Paul's, 2 Cor. 5.21. For he has made him to be sin
for us, who knew no sin, is borrowed from Esaias, upon which D. Franzius thus
expresses himself. How Christ was made sin may be plainly and perfectly
declared from the Beasts allotted for Sacrifices, when by imputation of the
sins of the People to them they became unclean, yea sin, and so were slain and
sacrificed, etc. By which words the reason of this Tropical speech, whereby Sin
is taken for Sacrifice is noted; Illyricus says, These Sacrifices were so
called, because the sins of the People, (with respect to punishment) were after
a certain manner by Imputation transferred upon them, not that the (...)
signifies to expiate Cl. Script. part. 1 Col. 858.

[ Promise] is put for Faith, which embraces or receives the gracious promise
of God, Romans 9.8. Children of the promise, that is, of Faith, which receives
the gracious and free promise of Christ. They are called Sons by a Metaphor,
with respect to Abraham who is by the Holy Spirit called the Father of
Believers, Romans 4.16. As if he had said, they that tread in the steps of
Abraham, and are a like unto him in Faith. See Romans 4.12. Gal. 3.7, 29. and
4.28. etc.

[ Blood] is put for bloody-men, or those that are malicious and ready to spill
blood or perpetrate any villainy, Esa. 33.5. That stops his Ears from hearing
of blood, that is, hearkens not to them who conspire or confederate to commit
Murder, slaughter or other wickedness ^^for that is synecdochically noted by
the word Blood.) See Prove. 1.10, 11, 12, etc.

[ The Subject or Argument] of Writing is put for the writing it self, 1 King
8.21. The Ark wherein is the Covenant of the Lord, that is, the tables wherein
the Covenant was written. Exodus 34.28. So Romans 9.4. (...), the Testaments or
Covenants, that is, the two tables of the Covenants, as they are expressly
called, Heb. 9.4. So the Old Testament is taken for the Books wherein it was
written and contained, 2 Cor. 3.14. which is common in our vulgar speech to
take the Old and New Testament for the Books wherein they are written.

5. The thing Signified is put for the Sign.
THE thing signified is sometimes put for the sign materially, that is, for the
thing it self, which is the Sign 1 Chronicles. 16.11. Seek the Lord and his
strength, that is, the Ark of the Covenant, which was a sign and symbol of his
presence and strength. So Psalm. 78.61. Psalm. 105.4. Whence it is expressly
called the Ark of the strength of God, Psalm. 132.8. Ezekiel. 7.27. The Prince
shall be Clothed with desolation, that is, with a garment denoting mourning
and desolation; 1 Cor. 11.10. A Woman ought to have (...) power on her Head,
that is, a garment signifying that she was under the power of her Husband.

Sometimes the thing signified is formally put for the Sign, that is, for the
term or appellation of the sign, as Exodus 8.23. And I will put Redemption
between my people and thy people, that is, the sign or token of Redemption.
Deuteronomy. 16.3. Seven days shall thou eat unleavened Bread therewith even the bread
of Affliction, that is, a sign, monument or Memorial of the Affliction, which
you endured in Egypt. By this Trope Bread is called the Body of Christ, and
Wine is called his Blood, Matthew. 26.26, 28. Mark 14.22, 24. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.
that is, a Sacramental sign and symbol of his Body and Blood, instituted in
remembrance of him.

CHAP. IV. Of a Metonymie of the Adjunct.
A Metonymie of the Adjunct is seven fold.

1. When the Accident is put for its Subject in kind. 2. When the Thing
contained is put for the Thing containing, or a thing in a Place, is put for
the place. 3. When Time is put for things done or existing in time. 4. When the
Opinion of men is put for the Thing it self. 5. When the Occupatum, or Subject
concerned is put for its object. 6. When the Sign is put for the thing
signified. 7. When a Name is put for a person or thing.
Of these in Order.

1. When the Accident is put for its Subject in kind.
THE Abstract is put for the Concrete, Genesis 42.38. Shall ye bring down my
hoaryness (or gray headedness so the hebrew) with sorrow to the Grave, that is,
me that am now an old man, gray and decrepit with Age. 1 Samuel 15.29. The
Eternity (or strength) of Israel shall not lie, that is, the Eternal and strong
God of Israel. 2 Samuel 9.12. And all the Habitation of the house of Ziba were
Servants unto Mephibosheth, that is, his whole Family, or all that dwelt in his
house (as we translate it.) Job 5.16. Iniquity stops her Mouth, that is,
wicked men are compelled to be silent before God, Job 32.7. Days should speak,
and multitude of years should teach wisdom, that is, ancient men that are
arrived to a great Age or many days. See Psalm. 12.1. Psalm. 68.18. Thou have led
Captivity Captive, that is, such as were in Captivity, as Esa. 49.24. and Jer.
29.14. or actively, making those Captives, that kept us in Captivity, as the
World, Sin, Death, and the Devil. So Ephesians. 4.8. Col. 2.12, 13, 14, 15. etc.
Psalm. 110.2, 3. From the Dew of the Morning thou have the Dew of thy Nativity,
that is, thy Children; who, as dew seems to be generated of the morning moist
air and then appears scattered in innumerable drops, so shall thy Children be
begotten by the Preaching of the Gospel in innumerable numbers. More examples
you may see, Prove. 23.21. Esa. 57.13. Psalm. 144.3.4. Psalm. 90.8, 9. Jer. 2.5.
Ezekiel. 44.6. And you shall say to the Rebellion (so the hebrew) that is, to the
Rebellious people. Luke 1.78. The day spring from on high has visited us -- An
epithete of the incarnate Messiah taken from those places where he is compared
to the Sun and Light, Esa. 9.2. and 60.1, 2. Mal. 4.2. etc. John 11.40. If thou
would believe thou should see the Glory of God, that is, his glorious
works. Romans 11.7. Ephesians. 1.21. Phil. 1.16. Supposing to add affliction to my
bonds, that is, to me in Bondage and Captivity, 1 Pet. 2.17. Love the
Brotherhood, that is, the Brethren, or the Congregation or Assemblies of the
Faithful, 1 Pet. 5.9. So Circumcision is put for the Circumcised Jews, Romans
3.30. and 15.16. which is a Metonymie of the Sign, and for the Spiritually
Circumcised, Col. 3.3. which is a Metaphor.

Other Adjuncts are put for their Subje^^ts, Ezekiel. 26.8. He shall stir up the
Buckler against thee, that is, Soldiers that wear Bucklers or Targets in War,
See Esa. 19.9. Zech. 9.15.

[ Light] is put for the Sun (...), by way of eminency, because it is the
Fountain and original of Light, Job 31.26. Hab. 3.4. It is put for Fire, Mark
14.54. And he sat with the Servants and he warmed himself (...), by the Light,
that is, the Fire which gives Light as well as heat. See John 18.18.

[ Oil or Ointment] is put for one singularly anointed, Esa. 10.27. The yoke
shall be destroyed, because of the anointing, in the hebrew it is from the face
of Oil, or because of Oil, that is, for the anointing of the Lord and his
Grace. Junius and Trenellius expound it thus. The yoke shall be destroyed
because of the anointing, that is, by and through Christ thou shall be set
free, in whom the Spirit of Jehovah rests who anointed him, cap. 61* 1.
Illyricus says, That this is properly fulfilled at the coming of the Messiah,
and the Redemption purchased by him, who has broken the yoke, canceled the hand
writing, and took away the Tyranny of the Law, of Sin, Death and Satan. See
Chap. 9.4, 6.

[ Sin] is put for Sinners, Isa. 1.18. Though your sins be as Scarlet they
shall be as white as Snow, though they be red like Crimson they shall be as
wool, that is, the sinners by having their iniquities pardoned, shall be
cleansed and purified from the guilt and condemnation of sin, for Sin properly
and in it self cannot be made clean, Psalm. 51.9. Matthew. 8.3. his Leprosy was
cleansed, that is, the Leprous man was healed, Ps. 25.11. Exodus 14.4. Genesis
34.29. Deuteronomy. 8.17. Job. 15.29. Prove. 31.29. Esa. 10.14. and 30.6. Rev. 18.3.
Prove. 15.6. Jer. 20.5. etc. Job 6.22. Prove. 5.10. etc.

2. The thing Contained is put for the thing Containing, and a thing in a Place
for the Place.
GENESIS 28.22. And this stone which I have set for a Pillar shall be Gods House,
that is, this Place where I have erected a statue of Stone, Josh. 15.19. Give
me springs of water, that is, some portion of Land where there may be springs
of water, for it is added that he gave her the upper springs and the nether
springs, that is, a Field in which there were Springs in the higher and lower
part. See Ezekiel. 26.5, 14. Hosea 9.6. Amos 8.5.

Math. 2.11. They opened their Treasures and offered him Gifts, that is, they
opened their Cabinets (for so says Kirstemius upon the place, the Arabic word
signifies) or Purses where their Treasure or precious things were kept. See
Psalm. 135.7. Matthew. 12.35. Matthew. 22.13. Cast him into outer Darkness, that is,
Hell, the place of Darkness. See more examples, Matthew. 25.10. They that were
ready went with him, (...), into the marriage, that is, into the place where
the Marriage was to be celebrated. It is said in the same Chapter, v* 21, 23.
Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord, that is, into the place of joy, the
Celestial Kingdom, Mark 3.1^^. And unclean Spirits when they saw him, fell
down before him, (viz. Jesus) that is, men possessed with unclean Spirits, Luke
21. For all these have of their abundance cast, (...), into the gifts of God,
that is into the ((...), or Gazaphylacium) the place where those offerings were
put. which were bestowed upon God. It is therefore called Corban, i. e. a Gift,
Matthew. 27.6. See more Acts 16.13, 16. where Prayer is put for the place of
prayer, as also Luke 6.12. Heb. 12.1. Let us run with patience the ((...),
certamen, Strife or) race that is set before us, that is, our course in this
place of strife, or racing. Rev. 8.3. And another Angel came and stood at the
Altar, having (...), Golden Incense, that is a Golden Censor, as we translate
it. See verse 5.

To this kind of Metonymie may be referred when the Wind is put for that
quarter of the World from whence it blows, 1. Chron. 9.24. Jer. 49.32. and
52.23. Ezekiel. 5.12. Matthew. 24.13. And where any River is put for the bordering
Country by which it runs, Esa. 23.3. Jer. 12.5. Zach. ^^.3. See also Jer. 2.18.
where it is with all a Metaphor.

3. Time is put for things done or existing in Time.
THIS is to be understood of the word Time it self, as also of Names which
express Parts of Time, whether it be naturally or by institution, divided.

[ Time] 1 Chronicles. 12.32. And the Children of Issachar which were men that had
understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do -- that is, they
were skilful and well instructed in prudence, whereby they knew what to do, and
when to do it, and therefore went before the Israelites. 1 Chronicles. 29.30. With
all his Reign, and his (viz. David's) might, and the times that went over him,
and over Israel, and over all the Kingdoms of the Countries, that is, the
various Negotitiaons and Chances, whether prosperous or adverse, which in any
of those times happened to them. Es^^h. 1.13. Then the King said to the wise
men which knew the Times, that is, who knew past transactions which happened in
the respective times, or who knew how prudently to manage, and act all things
in season. Job 11.17. And thy time shall arise above the Noon day (so the
hebrew) that is, thy Meridian prosperity shall be clearer then the light, or
most illustrious. Psalm. 31.15. My times are in thine hands, that is my Life,
Health, and the whole state and course of my Life, for wha^^soever changes
come, thou governest them by thy providence. See Ps. 139.1, ^^, 3. etc. 2 Timothy
3.1. etc.

An [ Age] which is a part of Time, as Heb. 1.2. By whom also he has made
(...)* the Ages, that is, the world, which endures for Ages, and therefore all
things existing in time, So Heb. 11.3. This signification comes from the hebrew
word, (...) which signifies both Ages and World, Romans 12.2. Be not conformed to
this Age, that is, the impiety of this World, or the wicked men living in this
Age. For so (...), is taken, Matthew. 13.22. Mark 4.19. Luke 16.8. 2 Cor. 4.4.
Gal. 1.4. Ephesians. 2.2. and 6.12. 2 Timothy 4.10. etc.

[Years] Prove. 5.9. Lest thou give thine honor unto others, and thy years unto
the Cruel, lest thou give thy Life unto a Jealous Husband who will kill thee,
whereas otherwise thou may be safe and secure. See chap. 6.32, 33. etc.

[Dayes] Deuteronomy. 4.32. Ask now of the Days that are past, which were before thee,
etc. that is, the histories and Transactions of former times, search the
Annals. 1 Samuel 24.19. Wherefore the Lord reward thee good for this day, which
thou have done unto me (so the original) that is for the benefit and good I
received from thee this day, Mark 13.19. (...).
Those days shall be (such an) affliction, as was not from the beginning, that
is, what shall come to pass in those days or in that time. This denotes such
prodigious Calamities, as if that time were even Misery it self. 1 Cor. 4.3.
But with me it is a very small thing, that I should be judged of you, or of
man's day, (...), that is, (as we translate it) man's Judgment, because there are
certain Days allotted for Judgments.

Ephesians. 5.16. Redeeming the time because the days are evil, that is, very many
evils, scandals, and sins, are perpetrated in these times; The Books of
Chronicles are called the words of days, that is, a repetition, narrative,
(...) V^^rba dierum.
or rehearsal of the gests and transactions of those times.

[ The Days] of any one in Scripture phrase is called that time wherein any
signal thing for good or evil, happens to him. For Good, as Hosea 1.11. Luke
19.42, 44. For Evil, as Job 18.20. Psalm. 137.6, 7. Eccle. 5.19. Jer. 17.16.
with Jon. 1.3. and 3.10. and 4.1, 5, 9, 10, 11. Jer. 14.7, 20, 21, etc. Ezekiel.
21.19. and 22.4. Obad. 12. Micah. 7.4. Psalm. 37.12, 13. With respect to the
Effect, Calamities and Misfortunes are called the days of the Lord, because he
justly punishes men for their malignity and wickedness, Job 24.1. Esa. 13.6.
Joel 1.15. and 2.1, 2. Amos 5.20. Zeph. 2.2. and 1.14, 15, 16, 18. By way of
eminency (...), the last Judgment, when God shall reward every man according to
his works, is called the day of the Lord, Joel 2.32. Act. 2.20. 1 Cor. 1.7. 1 Thessalonians. 5.2. etc.

The day of the Son of man, Luke 17.24, 26. is expounded verse 30. to be the
day wherein the Son of man shall be revealed. That appellation (by an
Antanaclasis) is taken otherwise, verse 22. The days will come, when ye shall
desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.
Brentius upon the place says -- The sense is, because things are now in
tranquillity, the Son of man is despised and rejected: But so great calamities
shall come upon Judea, that men shall desire but for one day to see me, and
enjoy my help, but shall not compass their desires. Illyricus says, ye shall
desire to see, that is, enjoy for a small season those good things, and that
good state you are in whilst I am present with you, but, etc. See verse 23. and
Matthew. 24.21, 23. etc.

Christ calls ( his day) the season of his coming into the Flesh, in the
fullness of time, John. 8.56. Your Father Abraham rejoiced to see my Day, and he
saw it, and was glad, that is, he saw it by a peculiar appearance, and
believed; upon which D. Franzius says, None may doubt but a prospect of the
face and person of Christ was shown and exhibited to Abraham in his Divine
vision, viz. De interpret. Script. Orac. 47.
As he was born of a Virgin, come of Abraham's seed, beginning with miraculous
ministrations, exalted from his passion to the right hand of the Father, and to
come in the last day, and Crown him in another Life.

[ The Day] of the exhibition of Christ in the flesh is called Mal. 4.5. The
great and terrible day of the Lord, or as others render it, honorable and
fearful, as Jacob adorned the place where the heavenly Manifestation was made
with the same Epithete Genesis 28.17. How dreadful is this place? This is no other
but the House of God, and the gate of Heaven.

This day (viz. the manifestation of the Messiah) is dreadful or terrible to
Devils, because by his power their Kingdom is destroyed, John 12.31. 1 John
3.8. As also to the Impious and Rebellious Enemies of Christ, See Malachy 3.2.
and Matthew. 2, 3.

An [ Hour] Mark 14.35. He (that is Christ) prayed; that if it were possible
the Hour might pass from him, that is, that most bitter passion, the thoughts
of which, at that time troubled and oppressed him, John 12.27. Father save me
from this hour, that is, from the Anxiety and Agony, which I shall suffer in
the time of my passion. Christ spoke of the time of his Passion and Death, at
the thoughts of which (as a true and real man,) he seemed to be in a great
trembling and consternation.

The [ End] or last time is put for reward, which is wont to be given when one
has done his work, as Prove. 23.18. Prove. 24.14, 20. Jer. 29.11. So 1 Pet. 1.9.
Receiving the (...), the end of your Faith, even the Salvation of your Souls,
which the Syriack renders Reward, or Retribution. But this Reward given by God
is not a debt, but of free Grace and Mercy, because a merited reward or wages
must bear proportion to the service done; but no service of ours can bear
proportion to Everlasting Life and Happiness, so that it necessarily follows
that the reward is purely of Grace.

[ Feast] is put for the Sacrifice, which is offered upon the Feast day, as
Exodus 23.18. Thou shall not offer the blood of my Sacrifice with leavened
Bread, neither shall the Adeps festi mei.
fat of my Feast remain until the Morning, that is, the fat of the Lamb to be
sacrificed, or of the sacrifice of my Feast, as Junius and Tremellius render
it. As also the Chaldee. So Esa. 29.1. Let them kill Feasts, that is, (as we
translate it) sacrifices. See Mal. 2.3: -- Psalm. 118.27. Bind the Feast (so the
hebrew) with Cords, even unto the horns of the Altar, that is, the sacrifice of
the Feast or Festival day, etc.

The [ Passeover] is put for the Lamb which was slain and eaten on that
Festival in memorial of the Deliverance from Egypt, Exodus 12.21. And kill the
Passover, that is, the Paschal Lamb. 2 Chronicles. 30, 17. Mark 14.12.14. Matthew.
26.17, 18, 19. Luke 22.8, 11, 13, 15.

[ Summer] is put for Summer Fruit, Esa. 16.9. Jer. 40.10. Amos 8.1. 2 Samuel
16.2. For in these places the hebrew is only Summer.

[ Harvest] is put for Fruit gathered in the time of Harvest, Exodus 23.10.
Deuteronomy. 24.19. Esa 16.9. Joel 3.18. It Is also put for the Reaper. Esa. 17.5.
Which we translate Harvest-man.

4. The Opinion of Men is put for the Thing it self.
IN Holy Scriptures sometimes things are named and described according to
appearance or men's Opinion ((...)) and not, ((...)) as they are, in their own
Nature. This happens. (1.) In single words, as Nouns, and Verbs. (2.) In a
Conjunct phrase.

In [ Nouns] 1 Samuel 28.14, 15, 16, 20. That Diabolical spectrum or Apparition
raised by the Witch of Endor in the likeness of Samuel, is called Samuel,
because he falsely gave out that he was Samuel, and the deluded spectators
thought him so. Hananiah is called a Prophet, Jer. 28.1, 5, 10. Not that he was
truly so, but so reputed. It Is said, Ezekiel. 21.3. I will cut off from thee the
Righteous and the wicked, where by Righteous is meant persons that were only so
in appearance, having an external form of Righteousness which begat the good
opinion of men, but with respect to Gods notice that knows the inward frame of
the Heart, to be unsound there is to be unrighteous, Matthew. 8.12. The Jews are
called the Children of the Kingdom, because they seemed to be such, and Christ
says, Matthew. 9.13. I am not come to call the Righteous, (viz. such as are so in
their own eyes) but sinners to Repentance. Luke. 18.9. Romans 10.2, 3. etc.

Luke 2.48. Joseph is said to be the Father of Jesus (and verse 41. he is said
to be his Parent) because he was thought to be so by men which is expressly said
Luke 3.23. See John ^^.42. -- 1 Cor. 1.21. It pleased God by the foolishness of
Preaching to save them that believe -- verse 25. Because the foolishness of God
is wiser then men, etc. Where Preaching of the Gospel, etc. is called
foolishness, not that it was really so but because the worldly wise reputed it
so, as verse 18. viz. To teach Salvation by the Cross, to seek Life in Death
and Glory in Disgrace, which the Carnal Worldling thought folly, as verse 23.

The [ Devil] is said to be the God of this World, 2 Cor. 4.4 because he boasts
that the Kingdoms of this World are at his disposal, Matthew. 4.8, 9. Luke 4.6,
7. And because Idolaters esteemed him a God, viz. in their Idols, as Chemnitius
says, Loco de creatione p. 119.
He is called the God of this World, as a Dog is called the God of Egypt,
because he was Worshipped for a God. So the Belly is called God because men
took more care to provide for it, then to serve God, Phil. 3.19. etc.

Gal. 1.6. False teaching is called another Gospel, because some men thought it
so, whereas it is really (as verse 7*) a perverting the Gospel. Epimenides is
called the Prophet of the Cretans, Tit. 1.12. because they accounted him so,
and after his Death sacrificed to him, as Laertius Witnesses. External
profession is called Faith, Jam 2.14, 17, 20, 24, 26. because men are apt to
rest in it as sufficient for Salvation, See Jude 12, 13. etc.

[In Verbs,] Matthew. 14.9. The King (viz. Herod) was sorry, that is, he
counterfeited sorrow for verse 5. It is said he feared the Multitude, when he
would put John Baptist to Death, of whom the People had a very great esteem; so
that this sorrow was nothing else but artificial and feigned.

It is said Mark 6.48. That Christ would have passed by them, (viz. his
Disciples at Sea) that is, he seemed to pass by, or such was the posture and
motion of his body as if he would pass by, John 3.30. He must increase, but I
must decrease; This increasing and decreasing is spoke with respect to the
opinion of men, who had extraordinary esteem of John hitherto, and vilified
Christ, otherwise speaking according to the Nature of the thing, John Baptist
was not diminished by the increasings of Christ, but afterward derived his own
increasings from his fullness.

Acts 27.27. The Shipmen deemed that some Country drew near to them (so it is
in the Greek (...), appropin quare sibi aliquam Regionem) because the shore
seems to move and draw near to them which are at Sea, but it is to be understood
that they drew near land. So Virgil 3 Aeneid. Provehimur porta, terraeque
urbesque recedunt, that is, we sail from the Port, and the Lands and Cities go
back.

[ In joined Words,] or an entire phrase, Psalm. 72.9. His enemies shall lick
the dust, that is, they shall be so inclining and prostrate toward the Earth,
that they shall seem to lick the dust of the Earth, which is a Description of
fear and subjection. So Esa. 49.23. and Micah 7.17. etc. -- Esa. 13.5. They
shall come from a far Country from the End (or extreme part) of heaven. --
This phrase is taken from the opinion of the vulgar, who (led by the guess of
the Eye) think that heaven is not spherical (or round) but hemispherical,
ending at the extremes of the Earth, upon which the end or extremes of heaven
seems to lean, or be stayed upon, so that the End of heaven is put for the end
of the Earth, or remotest places, you have the same phrase Deuteronomy. 4.32. and
30.4. Neh. 1.9. Math. 24.31. This exposition may be confirmed by the places
where Mountains are called the Foundations of Heaven, as 2 Samuel 22.8. Because
at great distance the Heavens seem As it were to rest upon them -- they are
called the Pillars of Heaven, Vatablus in ^^h. 1.9. ^^initor sive Horizon
no^^ri hem^^s^^herii videtur contingere (...) Regionem, quam ^^rminat.
Job 26.11. Because Heaven seems to be propt by them as by Pillars.

5. The Occupate put for the Object.
SENCE] is put for its object, or the thing which is perceived by sense as [
Hearing] is put for Doctrine or Speech, Esa. 28.9. Whom shall he teach
knowledge? And whom shall he make to understand hearing (so the hebrew) that
is, Doctrine, or the word, Esa. 53.1. Who has believed our hearing? that is,
our Doctrine or Speech, or as we translate it, Report? So is (...) Hearing
taken, John 12.38. Romans 10.16. Gal. 3.2.5. [ Hearing] is put for rumor or fame,
Psalm. 112.7. Esa. 28.19. Ezekiel. 7.26. Obad. 1. Hab. 3.2. Matthew. 4.24. and 14.1.
and 24.6. Mark 1.28. and 13.7. etc. By the same Trope [ The Eye] is put for
Colors seen by the Eye, and are the object of sight, as in the Original text
of the following places, Numb. 11.7. Lev. 13.55. Prove. 23.31. Ezekiel. 1.4. and
8.2. and 10.9. So two Eyes are put for a double way, which give occasion to
look upon both, Genesis 38.14, 21. Some say this is a proper name, some say it is
two Fountains.

[ Affections] and what bear Analogy with them, are put for their object, as [
Faith] for the Doctrine which is received and believed by Faith, Acts 6.7. Gal.
1.23. Ephesians. 4.5. 1. Tim. 4.1. Tit. 1.13. Jude 3. Rev. 2, 13. See Gal. 3.23, 25.

[ Hope] is put for God in whom we hope, and from whom we expect every good
thing, Psalm. 71.5. For thou art my hope O Lord, that is, in whom I hope, the
support of my hope, and the God of my strength. See Jer. 14.8. Psalm. 65.5.6.
Jer. 17.7, 13. etc.

It Is put for the Messiah or Christ specially, Act. 28.20. For the Hope of
Israel I am bound with this chain, that is, for the Messiah, who is hoped for
and desired by Israel, or (which is the same thing) for the good hoped for from
the Messiah, Act. 26.6, 7, 8. So Col. 1.27. and 1 Timothy 1.1. Christ is called
our hope.

It is put for men, from whom we expect Good or confide in, as Esa. 20.5. They
shall be ashamed of Ethiopia their hope, as verse 6. Likewise Hope is put for
the thing hoped for, as Prove. 13.12. Hope deferred makes the heart sick but
when the desire comes it is a Tree of Life, that is, the thing hoped for and
desired, Romans 8.24. Hope that is seen is not hope, that is, the thing hoped
for, etc. Gal. 5.5. For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of
Righteousness by Faith, that is, Eternal Life, promised to the just by Faith.
So Tit. 2.13.

[ Love] is put for the person or thing beloved, Jer. 2.33. Why trimest thou
thy way to seek Love? that is, that which thou love, Jer. 12.7. I have given
the love of my Soul into the hand of her Enemies, that is, the people dearly
beloved by me as the Chaldee renders it, Hos. 9.10. And their abominations were
as their Love, that is, the Idols which they love.

[ Desire] is put for the person or thing desired and loved, Ezekiel 24.16. Son of
man, behold, I take away the desire of thine eyes from thee with a stroke, that
is, thy desired and beloved wife, as verse ^^8. So verse 21. Behold I will
profane my Sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your Eyes,
that is, that which you love and delight in, as verse 25. For that which the
mind longs after is ascribed to the Eyes, as the lust of the Eyes is put, 1
John 2.16. This may give some light to that passage, Hag. 2.7. Where Christ is
called the desire of all Nations -- the sense that the Nations will extremely
desire him, love him, embrace him and hope in him, that is, when they are
converted to the Kingdom of Christ by the voice of the Gospel (to whom the Name
Gentiles is ascribed, Romans 11.13. and other places) The Term Desire is
sometimes put for the Affection of Love, for to be desired, signifies to be
loved and esteemed, (by a Metonymie of the effect for the Cause, for as much as
love begets desire after the thing beloved, of which you have Examples. In Genesis
27.15. Psalm. 19.10, 11. (with 119.126, 127.) Prove. 21.20. Cant. 5.6. Esa. 1.29.
and 32.12. and 44.9. Jer. 3.19. Lam. 1.7, 10. and 2.4. Dan. 9.23. and 10.11,
19. Hosea 9.6. Amos 5.11. Zach. 7.14. etc.

[ Fear] is put for God, who is feared, Genesis 31.42. The Fear of Isaac, that is,
the God whom Isaac Feared and Worshipped. So verse 53. Junius and Tremellius
think this phrase alludes to that Fear, by which God (as it were with a bridle)
restrained Isaac from revoking or recalling that blessing he gave to Jacob,
Chap. 27.35. etc.

Esa. 8, 13. Let him be your fear, and let him be your Dread, that is, let God
be Feared and Dreaded by you.

Fear is put for the Evil feared, Psalm. 53.5. They feared a fear, where no fear
was, that is, they feared where there was no evil nor danger which is the
object and cause of Fear, Prove. 1.26. I will mock when your fear comes, that
is, that which you fear and tremble at, as verse 27. When your Fear comes as
desolation, and your destruction comes as a Whirlwind, when distress and
anguish comes upon you. See Prove. 3.25. etc. 2 Cor. 5.11. Knowing (...), the
fear of the Lord, that is, the terrible judgment of the Lord.

[ An Action] is put for its Object, Exodus 15.2. The Lord is my strength and
praise, that is, the God whom I praise, and who is the scope or argument of my
Song -- the like we have, Psalm. 118.14. expounded ver. 15, 16 Jer. 17.14. The
Prophet calls the Lord his praise, that is, the Object of his praise and
thanksgiving for his great goodness. See Deuteronomy 28.8. and 12.7. etc. 1 Samuel 1.27.
And the Lord gave me my Petition, that is, the thing I asked. So Job 6.8. 2 Thessalonians. 1.11. Heb. 11.13. Act. 1.4. Wait for the promise of the Father, that is,
the Holy Spirit promised by the Father.

6. The Sign is put for the thing signified.
IN Nouns,] Genesis 49.10. The Scepter shall not depart from Judah, that is, the
Royal Authority. So Esa. 14.5. Zach. 10.11. etc. A Throne is also put for Regal
Authority, Psalm. 89.4. And a Crown or Diadem, Psalm. 89.39. Ezekiel. 21.26. etc.
Unction is put for the Priesthood, Numb. 18.8. Altars for Divine Worship, 1
King 19.10. Psalm. 23.4. Thy rod and thy staff comfort me, that is, thy Care and
Love toward me; for a rod and staff were a sign of Pastoral Care and Office of
the Shepherd to his Flock; this is withal an Anthropopathy, whereby God is
represented as a Shepherd, and things relating to a Shepherd attributed to him,
Psalm. 140.8. Thou have covered my head in the day of Arms (so the hebrew) that
is, in the day of Battle and Adversities which Hostility brings, the signs and
Instruments whereof are Arms, Psalm. 44.6. For I will not trust in my Bow,
neither shall my Sword save me, that is, my Military skill, Fortitude, Prudence
or Stratagems, of which the Signs and Instruments of exercise were a Bow, and a
Sword -- to which the Divine strength and goodness is opposed, verse 7. But
thou (O Lord) have saved us from our Enemies.

So elsewhere a Sword is put for War and Hostile violence, Exodus 18.10. Esa.
1.10. and 2.4. 2 Samuel 12.10. Lam. 5.9. Ezekiel. 21.3, 4, 9. etc. In which there is
also a Metonymie of the Organical or instrumental Cause, as before. Gram. Sacr.
p. 283.
See other Examples Psalm. 144.11. and Matthew. 10.34. etc.

Matthew. 23.2. The Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses Chair. The Chair of
Moses Metonymically denotes, the power of Teaching, Judging, and Ruling the
People, of which it was a symbol; which things are expressed by the Name of
Moses, who was instructed by God to Teach and Govern, and who ^^xercised both
by the Authority of God, and left the Rules in Writing for the posterity of the
Jews to observe. The term ( to sit) also aptly notes both; for the public
teachers, for the most part sat, Matthew. 26.55. Luke 4.20. John 8.2. Acts 22.3.
The Judges, also sat in a Chair or Tribunal, Exodus 18.13. Judge. 5.10. Matthew.
27.19. From whence (to sit) is put for Ruling and Judging, Psalm. 29.9, 10. and
110.1. (See 1 Cor. 15.25.) 2 Thessalonians. 2.4. And whereas the Priests, Scribes, and
Pharisees sat in the seat or chair of Moses, and did conform to the way of
teaching, and Government of the People according to the rule of the Divine Law
given by Moses, Christ, ver. 3. Commands Obedience to them; but gives a caution
to take heed of their Leaven, that is, their false Doctrines, and feigned
Traditions, as Matthew. 16.6, 12. For that did not belong to the seat of Moses,
but to the seat of the scornful, or chair of Pestilence, as Jerome renders it,
Psalm. 1.1. the throne of Iniquity, Psalm. 94.20. etc. Romans 3, 30. and 15.8. Col.
3.11. The Jews are called the Circumcision because that was the sign whereby
they were distinguished from other Nations; And the Gentiles are called the
uncircumcision, because it distinguished them from the Jews, Gal. 2.7, 8. Ephesians.
2.11. Romans 2.26, 27. and 3.30. ^^al. 3.11. etc.

Abscondere.
[ In Verbs] Sometimes to hide signifies to protect and put in a safe place,
sometimes to leave or depart from another, for hiding is a sign of both. Of the
former we have examples. Job 5.21. Psalm. 27.4, 5. and 31.20, 21. and 64.2, 3.
etc. Where there is also an Anthropopathy, when the speech is of God. Of the
later we have examples, Genesis 31.49. When we are hid one from another, (so the
hebrew) that is, when we depart or are absent from one another, Deuteronomy. 22.1.
Thou shall not see thy Brothers Ox, or his Sheep go astray, and hide thy self
from them, that is, thou shall not go away and let them alone but bring them
back. So Esa. 58.7.

[ To Sleep] is put for to be secure, because sound and pleasant sleep is an
evident sign of security, Psalm. 3.5. and 4 8. [ Puffing] is put for Contempt,
for a slight puff of the Mouth denotes when a matter is despised as an
inconsiderable thing, Psalm. 10.5. and 12.5.

[ To kiss] signifies Love, Obedience, Obsequiousness and Submissive Respect,
of which in ancient times a kiss was a sign, as Genesis 41.40. 1 King 19.18. Psalm.
2.12. To this some refer that phrase, Matthew. 5.47. Heb. 11.13. (...) os^^ulo
salutare; Leigh. Crit. Sacra.
for (...), signifies to salute with kissing and embracing, and so is put for a
receiving or embracing in Love, or Faith and Hope.

[ To Laugh] is put for to be joyful, which is the sign of Laughter, Job 8.21.
Psalm. 126.1, 2. Genesis 21.6. Luke 6.21, 25. And to be secure Job 5.22. [ To
Stand] is put for to Minister, Ezekiel. 8.11. Zach. 3.1. For it is the sign of a
Servant to stand. See Deuteronomy. 10.8. [ To Annoint] signifies to make a King or
chief Lord, Judge. 9.8. For Unction was in times past the Rite and Symbol of the
Solemn Inaugurations of Kings as in many places of the Old Testament appears.

[In Conjunct Phrases,] To shut and open, none resisting signifies a full and
free power of Administration, Esa. 22.22. To speak with a stiff-neck, signifies
proudly to resist and Blaspheme God, Psalm. 75.5. For an erected neck is the
indication of a proud mind. To give cleanness of Teeth, signifies Famine, Amos
4.6. Because in Eating, something of the meat sticks in the Teeth; For where
that uncleanness of Teeth is not found, it signifies that there was no meat
eaten, or a defect of Aliment. To lift up the Eyes, signifies Worship and
Adoration, Psalm. 121.1. and 123.1. Ezekiel. 18.6. For whom we Reverence and
Worship, we attentively behold. To lift up the Head, signifies an erection of
mind, animosity, and joy as Judge. 8.28. Psalm. 83. 1, 2. Luke 21.28. etc.

The face waxing pale denotes fear, for shame causes one to blush, and then for
fear the blood retires from the outward parts to the heart, as Esa, 29.22.
Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. See Job
9.24. To have a whores forehead notes impudence, for the indications of that
appear in the face as well as modesty and bashfulness, Jer. 3.3.

To bow the Knee, signifies Subjection and Obedience, or Divine Worship, Esa.
45.23. Phil. 2.10. Ephesians. 3.14. Of which genuflexion is a sign. To give the hand
sometimes notes voluntary subjection as 1 Chronicles. 29.24. 2 Chronicles. 30.8. Where
the hebrew signifies to give the hand, as in the margent of our Bibles.
Sometimes it notes begging and imploring, as Lam. 5.6. Sometimes Confederacy,
as Jer. 50.15. She (that is Babylon) has given her hand -- that is, she has
confederated with Cresus King of the Medes and Persians, as Herodotus, lib. 1.
says. See Ezekiel. 17.18. Levit. 6.2. with Gal. 2.9. Job 17.2. To put the hand
upon the head, signifies Grief, Calamity, and Sadness, Jer. 2.37. That being a
sign of it, as 2 Samuel 13.19. To put a hand upon the mouth, signifies silence,
or that one cannot Answer, Job 40.33. Micah 7.16. etc. See other examples, 2
Kings 3.11. Exodus 28 41. and 29.9. and 32.29. Number. 3.3. Jud. 17.12.

To lift up the hand, is put for swearing, Exodus 6.8. (so the hebrew) Psalm.
106.25, 26. and elsewhere, because such as swore lifted up their hands toward
Heaven, as Virgil says 12 Ene^^d.

-- Deinde Latinus,
Suspiciens Caelum, tenditque ad sydera Dextram:
Haec eadem Aenea, Terram, Mare, Sydera, Juro.
Sometimes it signifies to pray, as Psalm. 28.1, 2. Psalm. 68.31, 32. Psalm.
141.2* 1 Timothy 2.8. And to bless, Psalm. 134. For by that Ceremony they used to
bless of Old. Also to indicate or give notice, Esa. 49.22.

To this may be referred where Eating and Drinking is put for Health and Life,
as Exodus 24.11. See Genesis 16.13. Psalm. 2.3. Let us break their bands asunder,
and cast their Cords from us, that is, let us remove this troublesome
servitude, which by Bonds and Cords as by certain signs is noted. See Psalm.
46.9. He breaks the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder, he burns the
Chariot in the fire, verse 10. Be still and know that I am God, that is, he
puts an end to Wars, and tameth the Enemy, of which ( viz. Hostility) these
things were dismal signs. See Psalm. 58.10. and 69.11. See Job 16.15. Psalm.
35.12. Joel 1.3. Amos 8, 10. etc.

Esa. 2.4. And they shall beat their Swords into pl^^w shares, and their Spears
into Scyths, or pruning hooks; that is, there will be a Constant Peace, of
which there is not a more certain sign then when Arms are turned into rustical
or Country instruments which are useful in the time of Peace. And because the
Prophet speaks of a spiritual peace in the time of the Messiah, here is also a
metaphorical Allegory.

Esa. 49.23. They shall bow down to thee with their face toward the Earth, and
lick up the dust of thy Feet, that is, they will give thee Honor and
Reverence, for the sake of Christ thy head, who dwells in thee: For this speech
is of the New Testament Church. See Psalm. 72.8, 9. etc. Jer. 31.19. After I was
instructed I smote upon my thigh, that is, after my sin was shown unto me I was
affected with grief of mind. For smiting the thigh was an indication of grief
as Homer Iliad. P says of Achilles, that (...), when he had smote his Thighs he
had spoke to Patroclus, Odyss. 5. He cries out O miserable, and struck his
Thighs, etc. Lam. 2.10.

Lam. 2.10. The Elders of the Daughter of Sion sit upon the ground and keep
silence, they have cast up dust upon their Heads, they have girt themselves
with Sackcloath, the Virgins of Jerusalem hang down their Heads to the ground
-- By these signs a most extreme grief is described. Jon. 4.11. That cannot
discern between their right hand and their left hand, that is, that are not
come to the years or Age of discretion. The signs and effects of reason and
Judgment are said to be wanting, yea, even Judgment it self and the use of
Reason, and convenient Age for the Exercise of it.

[ In entire Speech.] Hither may be referred that Custom of speaking in Sacred
Scripture, whereby in Commands or Promises such things are put, which men were
wont to do, and are only the signs of those things which are intended and
understood by that speech, as when the Prophet Elisha Commands Gehazi his
Servant, 2 Kings 4.29. And Christ his Disciples, Luke 10.4. To salute no man by
the way, by which is intimated that they were with all expedition and dispatch
to do their errands and to avoid all interruptions by the way. For it is a sign
of great have among men if they are so intent upon the end of their Journey or
business, that they take no notice of any body they meet so as to salute him or
discourse with him. Otherwise mild, courteous, and civil salutations are
reckoned amongst Christian Duties, etc.

Jer. 9.17. Thus says the Lord of Hosts, consider ye, and call for the
Mourning Women, that they may come, and send for cunning Women, that they may
come, and ver. 18. And let them make have, and take up a wailing for us, etc.
The Lord does not approve of the dissembled wailing-women in mourning at
Funerals, but speaks according to the vulgar custom, denoting by this, and
informing the People of the bitterness of the present Calamities. See Amos
5.16. etc. -- Jer. 10.17. Gather up thy wares out of the Land, O Inhabitant of
the Fortress, that is, bundle and bind up your precious things together, as
verse 9. The sense is, that they were not to remain there but to be led into
Captivity, as chap. 18. where the reason of this Judgment is to be read at
large. For they that are in a Garrison, and doubt its strength do convey their
precious things to places of more security. This also may be an Irony, as if
the Lord had said, ye cannot effectually bring to pass any thing to free you
and yours. We have the like place, Jer. 46.19. etc. -- By destroying the
Weapons, Ezekiel 39.9, 10. The certainty of the promised victory, and the peace
that would ensue is denoted, as Esa. 2.4.

Matthew 24.20. But pray ye that your flight be not in the Winter nor on the
Sabbath day. The Disciples are commanded, with respect to the dreadfulness and
peril of the siege of Jerusalem, to do those things which belonged to the Jews,
who though that it was not lawful for them on the Sabbath to go above Goo^^win
in his Moses and Aaron, says, that 2000 Geometrical Cubits is a Sabbath days
Journey lib. 3. p. 112.
1000 greater (or 2000 lesser) paces; And therefore they ought to pray, that
they may not be necessitated to fly on the Sabbath because the accustomed
Sabbath days Journey would not be enough to convey them beyond the danger, of
the Roman Soldiers. And by this the greivousness of the Calamity is indicated.

Luke 22.36. Then said he (that is Christ) unto them, But now he that has a
purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: And he that has no Sword let
him sell his garment, and buy one. By this speech is signified, that to that
quiet and comfortable way of living, which the Apostles had hitherto enjoyed in
the School of Christ, should immediately succeed a most grievous persecution,
even to be begun that very night, and that the Enemy with Swords and Clubs were
at hand, so that such as confide in an Arm of Flesh, and would consult (as men)
about the security of themselves and theirs, could have no better way, then to
dispose of all, even to their very Coats, and provide themselves with Military
defenses to resist the Enemies violence. By this sign therefore, the thing
signified is to be understood; For Christ does not require, that his Apostles
should buy Swords and defend themselves, but by the necessity of a Sword, he
symbolically insinuates or intimates the greivousness of that danger, which
threatens them from the Enemy. So says Theophylact, and Enthymius upon the
place. The Apostles understood these words of Christ properly and therefore
say, verse 38. Lord here are two Swords, to whom he said, it is enough. By
which answer he modestly and tacitly reprehends the absurdity of his Disciples,
as if he had said, I perceive you do not apprehend the meaning of my
Parabolical speech, therefore it is enough to have admonished you thus much,
your experience and the fulfilling of my prediction will supply the place of an
exposition, when in a little time a Military Host shall invade, to repel which
a hundred Swords shall not be enough. See Brentius and Erasmus upon the place.

7. A Name is put For the Person or Thing.
THE Name of God is put for God himself, Deuteronomy. 28.58. That thou may fear this
glorious and fearful Name (viz. the Lord thy God. Psalm. 20.1. The Name of the
God of Jacob defend thee, that is, the God of Jacob. So Psalm. 115.1. Esa.
30.27. Micah 5.4. and frequently elsewhere, etc. John 3.18. Because he has not
believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God, that is Son of God
himself. So John 17.6. Acts 3.16. and 10.43. 1 John 2.12. etc.

[ Name] Is put for Man, Acts 1.15. The number of the Names together, were
about one hundred and twenty, that is, so many men. So Rev. 3.4. and 11.13.
Erasmus says, the reason of this speech is, that when men are numbered, their
Names are called over.

Name is put for Son, or posterity, because they are called by the Name or
Surname of their Ancestors, Deuteronomy. 25.7. 1 Samuel 24.22. 2 Samuel 14.7. etc.

Name, is put for the thing it self, Acts 4.12. For there is none other Name
under Heaven given unto men whereby we must be saved, that is, there is no
other way or means of Salvation but by Christ. Ephesians. 1.21. Every Name that is
Named, that is, every thing in Nature. It Notes also Dignity or Eminence, Phil.
2.9. Wherefore God also has highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is
above every Name, etc.

CHAP. V. Of an IRONY.
AN IRONY is a Trope whereby Contraries or Opposites are put for one another,
or when by the thing named a contrary thing must be understood. The Word
properly signifies dissimulation or cavilling, vox (...), proprie
dissimulationem and elusionem, seu cavillationem, significat. This Trope may
more rightly be called Antiphrasis, which uses words contrary to their proper
meaning or original and genuine sense; (...), Sermo per contrarium
intelligendus, ex (...) contra, and (...) dico. It may be distinguished into, 1.
Words singly or by themselves, considered, which is called Antiphrasis. 2.
Words so placed or disposed in a sentence, as denote derision, or a kind of a
mock, which vulgarly is called an Irony, of which Sarcasmus is a certain kind,
which is sharper then an Irony, as when one insults over them that are
oppressed with Calamities.


Antiphrasis, of Words singly or by themselves considered.
SOmetimes one and the same Word has contrary significations, as (...) Barak
which properly signifies to bless, as Genesis 12.3. and 24.35. 2 Samuel 8.10. Psalm.
34, 1. and many other places, is used in a contrary sense by an Antiphrasis, as
1 Kings 21.10. Set two men before him, Sons of Belial, to bear witness against
him, saying thou did bless God and the King, which Pagninus, the Chald.
Paraph. and our Version do render, thou did Curse or Blaspheme God and the
King. So v. 13. where the Execution of this Wicked Jezebels command is
described. Job 1.5. Peradventure my Sons have sinned and blessed God in their
Hearts, (which Pagninus renders, have cursed.) And the Chald. that they have
provoked or stirred him to Anger. Upon which place Vatablus says, that the
ancients did so abhor blasphemy, that they durst not even Name it, Chap. 1.11.
and 2.5. If he will not bless thee to thy face, Pagninus says Curse thee, etc.
(the Chald. provoke thee, etc.) After the same manner they expound the words of
Jobs Wife, Job 2.9. Do thou still retain thine integrity, bless (Pagninus
says curse) God and Die, See Caryl upon the place.
of these words some make a good construction, affirming that she gave her
husband good Counsel, to this sense; what do thou still stand upon terms with
God, will thou not humble thy self and desist from the conceits and
imaginations of thine own integrity, since these grievous and sudden
afflictions are sent for your your sins from an angry God, therefore rather
bless him, that is, pray to him, and in humility seek his face (for so to bless
signifies to pray, or make supplication) and beg him to release thee of this
miserable Life, since it is better for thee to dye once, then to die daily.

Beza and others say, that it is not likely that the Governess of such a Holy
Family as Job's, and the Wife and Companion of so good a man, should be so
impudently wicked as to give that abominable advice to her Husband, as either
to Curse God, or destroy himself. Her error (say they) was she judged him
Wicked, because thus smitten, and that he trusted upon his own integrity, etc.

But others with greater probability judge this Counsel to be very wicked, for
he reproves her for it plainly -- Thou speak as one of the foolish Women
speaks, and certainly Job would never have said so, if her speech had only
imported an humble preparation for his approaching Death -- It was rather a
speaking the Devils mind, to bid him Curse God and Dye, viz. [Curse God] that
the Magistrate taking notice of it thou may be cut off by the Sword of
Justice, for Blasphemers were sentenced to Death without mercy by the Law of
Moses, and it is not improbable that the light of Nature might carry those
Nations to as high and severe a Revenge against that highest Sin -- [ And Die]
that is, dye by thine hand, or destroy thy self, etc. So that the Word must of
necessity be understood to Curse by an Antiphrasis; as the same Word is used by
the Devil, Job 1.11. He will Curse thee to thy Face. The Word that signifies
(to be effected or accomplished) Prove. 13.19. denotes [to be interrupted or
broken] Dan. 2.1. and I Daniel was refreshed, Dan. 8.27. But Pagninus and our
Translation render it, I fainted, for it follows, I was sick. It also signifies
to shine, Job 29.3. and 31.26. Esa. 13.10. Also to praise or celebrate, Psalm.
117.1. Esa. 64.11. etc. And by an Antiphrasis to be inglorious or fools, Psalm.
75.4. Job 12.17. Esa. 44.25. etc.

(...)
The Word that signifies Benignity, Mercy, and Gratitude, Deuteronomy. 5.10. Jud. 8.35.
2 Samuel 9.1. Psalm. 141.4, 5. By an Antiphrasis signifies the quite contrary,
Lev. 20.17. Prove. 14.34.

The word which signifies to possess an Inheritance, Genesis 15.3. Deuteronomy. 2.24.31.
1 Kings 21.15. Esa. 14.21. signifies to be destroyed or thrown out of
Possession, Deuteronomy. 2.21.22. Judge. 14.15. Josh. 8.7. and 23.5.

(...)
The Word that signifies inconstancy, Levity, and Folly, Psalm. 85.8. Prove. 9.13.
Eccl. 7.26. By this figure signifies Constancy, Confidence, and Hope, as Job
31.24. Psalm. 78.7. Prove. 3.26.

(...) Nephesh, which signifies the Soul, Genesis 1.30. etc. (and Synecdochically
the Person it self, Genesis 2.7. and 17.14. Psalm. 11.1. And more generally an
animate Body or a living Creature, Genesis 1.24. etc.) by an Antiphrasis signifies
a Carcass, or a Lifeless Body, Lev. 19.28. So 21.1. and 22.4. Numb. 6.11. and
5.2. Hag. 2.14. To this signification some Refer, Psalm. 16.10. Thou shall not
leave my Soul in the Grave, that is, my Body.

(...)
The Word which signifies to be sanctified or made Holy, Exodus 29.37.43. etc.
signifies also be defiled, Deuteronomy. 2^^*9. Esa. 65.5. (...) Rephaim, Giants,
signifies sound and strong Persons, Genesis 14.5. Deuteronomy. 2.11. and by Antiphrasis
men dead, or that no medicine can cure (from (...) Sanavit, he has cured)
Psalm. 88.10. Esa. 26.14, 19. Prove. 21.16. etc. To this may be referred the word
(...)* which signifies a virtue as benediction, praise, a free gift, etc. Romans
15.29. 2 Cor. 9.5, 6. Ephesians. 1.3. Heb. 6.7. Jam. 3.10. Rev. 5.12, 13 and 7.12.
etc. And also a Vice, as an Hypocritical Conformity or dissembling praise in
order to deceive, as Romans 16.18. Several other examples occurr, as of Words
which have one signification in the root or primitive, and another in the
Derivative, some which signify one thing in one Conjugation, and a different
in another, which for brevity sake are left to the observation of the Learned,
as Esa. 40. with Numb. 3.22. Job 22.25. Psalm. 95.3, 4. Genesis 38.21. Deuteronomy. 23.17.
Job. 36.14. 1 Kings 14.24, and 15.11. 2 Kings 23.4, 5, 6, 7. etc. Josh. 17.15,
18. Psalm. 119.40. With Amos 6.8. etc.

An Irony of Words in a Sentence.
IN a speech of God and Christ] a thing is said or Commanded, which must be
understood in a contrary sense, that the literal meaning may be found, as Genesis
3.22. And the Lord God said, Behold the man is become as one of us; that is, he
is no ways like us, but rather to be abominated for his sin, it alludes also to
the Devils words, ver. 5. Ye shall be as Gods knowing good and Evil. Gesner
upon the place says, Deus ejusmodi Ironia and indignatione mendacium Diaboli
and Ambitionem Adami execratur, etc. that is, God uses this Irony by way of
execration of the Devils Lie and Adams Ambition, and aptly inculcates the
foulness of his sin, that he may learn to beware ever after. Ambros. de Elia
and Jejun. cap. 4. Irridens Deus non approbans haec dicit, that God spoke these
words by way of Derision not Approbation -- Thou thoughtst thou should be
like us, but because thou would be what thou were not, thou art fallen from
what thou have been, so thy Ambition to aspire beyond thy self has thrown thee
beneath thy self.

Deuteronomy. 32.37, 38. Where are their Gods, their Rock in whom they trusted, which
did eat of the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the Wine of their Drink
offerings, let them rise up and help you now and be your protection, as also
Judge. 10.14. Go and cry unto the Gods ye have chosen, let them deliver you in
the time of your tribulation. Jehovah in these Words does sharply chide the
Rebellious Israelites, and illustrates the impiety and blindness of their
Idolatries, who had hitherto Worshipped such things as Gods, which now in their
extremity were not able to deliver them from Evil or Desolation.

Job 38.5. Who has laid the measures of the Earth, if thou know etc. God
speaks these words to Job. as if he had said, you cannot reach to so
extraordinary a pitch of knowledge, as to know how God laid the Foundations of
the Earth, and made all things of nothing, verse 20. that thou should take it
(viz. the way where Light and Darkness dwell, as verse 19.) at the bound
thereof, and that thou should know the way to the Paths thereof -- This is an
Ironical concession, resulting from the words of the 3 verse, I will ask thee,
and thou shall make me know, etc.

Esa. 17.3. The Fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the Kingdom from
Damascus, and the Remnant of Syria: They shall be as the Glory of the Children
of Israel. Jerome in his Comment* says that Glory is by an Irony here put for
Ignominy and Disgrace.

Esa. 29.1. Add ye year to year, let them kill Sacrifices, upon which Luther
says, Tom. 3. fol. 356. in Explic. h. l.
that the Prophet mocks them, as if he had said, go to, proceed in your
Sacrifices stoutly, it shall happen, that you together with your Sacrifices
shall perish, See more examples, Esa. 57.12. Jer. 7.21. -- 11.15. -- 12.7. --
22.20. 2 King 24.7. Jer. 22.23. -- It Is said Ezekiel. 20.39. O House of Israel,
thus says the Lord God, serve ye every one his Idols, and hereafter also, if
ye will not hearken unto me -- Here is an Ironical abdication or casting,
wherein tacitly they are invited to the quite contrary, viz. True Piety and
the Worship of God Ezekiel. 28.3. Behold thou art wiser then Daniel: there is no
secret that they can hide from thee -- this is an Ironical Hyperbole, by which
the Prince of Tyrus is checked. For Daniel at that time was accounted the wisest
of men, because of the most excellent gifts that God gave him, so that it grew
to a Proverb, etc. So that it is only spoken with respect to the opinion or
esteem that King had of himself, which by this Irony is reproved. In Amos 4.4,
5. is an Ironical and Sarcastick exhortation, as appears by the conclusion
verse 12. where they are advised to prepare to meet their God -- (...) alludes
to the Law of God, Deuteronomy. 14.28. of Tithes: And Lev. 7.13. The ^^^^ring of
Leavened Bread, which the Israelites in their impure Worship of Idols (...)
imitate, etc. See Nah. 3.14. Draw the Waters, for the siege, Fortify thy
strong holds: Go into Clay, and tread the Morta^^, make strong the Brick kiln
-- An Ironical exhortation to the Enemy, intimating that whatever they
attempted to secure themselves would be in vain, Zach. 11.13. A Goodly price
that I was prized at of them, etc. This was an Ironical speech of Christ
concerning the price for which Judas sold him.

Matthew. 26.45. Christ Commands his Disciples to sleep on, and take their rest,
when he means the Contrary, it being then rather a time of Watchfulness,
because he was then to be betrayed, and it was therefore a more seasonable time
to learn more heavenly instruction before his leaving them, Matthew. 26.50. And
Jesus said unto him, Friend wherefore art thou come? This is an Irony, for he
was his Treacherous Enemy.

Mark. 7.9. Full well ye reject (or make void) the Commandment of God, that is,
very wickedly. See more Luke 11.41. John 3.10. John 7.28. with 8.14.

[ In the speech of Saints,] there are Ironies, as David's speech to Abner, Art
thou not a man? (we translate it valiant man) and who is like to thee in
Israel? wherefore then have thou not kept thy Lord the King? etc. His meaning
is that he behaved himself cowardly and basely in not preserving the King as he
ought -- 1 King 18.27. Elijah mocked Baals Prophets, bidding them Cry aloud,
because their God may possibly be talking, pursuing, journying or sle^^ping,
and so should be awaked; this is a most clear and evident Irony, as if he had
said, that he is neither a God, nor Living, nor capable of operation. The like
Irony we read 1 King. 22.15. Where Micajah bids Ahab go and prosper, etc.
Although he knew, that he should not prosper. So 2 Kings 8.10. Go say unto him,
thou may certainly recover, howbeit the Lord has showed me, that he shall
surely dye, this is an Irony to delude an impious King, that was Enemy to the
People of God.

Job 12.2. No doubt but ye are the People, and wisdom shall die with you, this
is a sarcastick Irony, as if he had said, ye take upon you to be the wisemen,
in comparison of whom, I am as a wild Asses Colt, Job. 11.12. And think when
you die, Wisdom must depart with you. Job 26.2, 3. How have thou helped him
that is without power? How savest thou the Arm that has no strength? How have
thou counseled him that has no wisdom? And how have thou plentifully declared
the thing as it is? This is an Ironical confutation. As if he had said, your
sayings are most comfortable and excellent! As they seem to you, when you have
to do with an infirm, abject, and ignorant person -- The meaning is, that they
are of no effect to judge, Junius.
preserve, counsel, or teach me, Psalm. 60.9. Philistia Triumph thou over me --
This is an Ironical Apostrophe, whereby David checks the insolence of the old
Philistines who for a long time vexed the Israelites.

Eccles. 11.9. Rejoice O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart clear thee
in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight
of thine Eyes, etc. Which is an Ironical concession, to the young man, that
gives himself a loose liberty to follow his sinful pleasure in his young years,
and in a haughty pride and confidence slights God and good things, neglecting
his soul for sensuality and (an imaginary) Earthly felicity; but his check and
correction follows -- But know thou, that for all these things God will bring
thee to Judgment.

Esa. 2.10. Enter into some Rock, and hide thee in the Dust, for fear of the
Lord, and for the glory of his Majesty. This is spoken by way of sarcasm, as if
he had said; fly from God, and his incensed face, or terrible hand if thou
can, but it is no purpose, as the following verses show. So Esa. 8.9, 10. see
Esa. 21.5. compared with Dan. 5. -- Jer. 8.14. and 4.9.15. and 46.9, 11. where
there are sarcasms against the King of Egypt and his Host, that were puffed up
for the Conquest of Josias -- The like Jer. 51.8.11. about Babylons fall -- See
Lam. 4.21. Mal. 1.9. 1 Cor. 4.8.

2 Cor. 10.12. For we dare not make our selves of the Number or compare our
selves with some that commend themselves, etc. The Apostle speaks Ironically,
checking the false Apostles, who had such magnificent thoughts, (and gloryed so
much) of themselves, as if he were nothing to them -- The like Irony he uses to
the conceited Corinthians, 1 Cor. 11.19. For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye
your selves are wise, Upon which Aretius says -- this speech is a sharp Irony,
as if he had said, it becomes such principal persons as you are to esteem those
fools who speak truth, 2 Cor. 12 13. What is it whererein ye were inferior to
other Churches, except it be that I my self was not burdensome to you? Forgive
me this wrong. He calls that Ironically a wrong, which indeed was none at all;
but rather an instance of Innocence.

[ Moreover,] to an Irony are referred,

(1) Some things spoken feignedly, and (...), or uttered by way of trial, as
Genesis 19.2. Where the Angels say to Lot who invited them, Nay but we will abide
in the street all night, whereas they were to tarry with Lot, and preserve him
and his family from the Conflagration of Sodom, as by the thing it self and the
event, as also from the Angels words, ver. 12, 13. is manifest. -- Genesis 22.2.
And he said, (that is, God, to Abraham), take n^^w thy Son, thine only Son
Isaac, wh^^m thou love, and get thee in^^o Land of Moriah, and offer him
there for a Burnt-offering upon one of the Mountains, which ^^ will show thee.
That this was only by way of trial appears by the first verse, and the event;
this passage was intended ^^or a good end, as well with respect to God, who
requires obedience and a perfect resignation of man, altho^^gh his precepts may
seem absurd to our Reason, as also with respect to Abraham and his son Isaac,
who became examples of Faith, Submission, and Con^^tancy to Gods Will, without
scruple, questions or murmuring: Besides there is respect had to the Messiah,
whose Passion, Death, and Resurrection is prefigured in this Mystical Type.

Matthew. 15.24, 25, 26. I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel -- It is not lawful to give the Childrens bread to Dogs -- That this
speech was also by way of trial of the Woman's Faith, appears by the event, and
the Elogy which Christ give her ( ver. 28. O Woman great is thy Faith.) The
mind differs from the speech -- he seems externally to segregate or distingush
her from the Sheep, and at the same instant occulty cherishes and Comforts her
as his. He compares her to a Dog, but places her at the same time at the
Childrens Table. This passage intimates the good and Salvation of the Woman and
all Beleivers, for we are hereby eminently informed by way of sweet consolation
of the certainty of Divine help, though it be for a while delayed in Crosses
and Calamities, as appears by that trying silence of Christ, ver. 23. viz. But
he answered her not a word, upon which Ch^^ysostom says, the Lord knew that
here was a hidden Jewel, Hom 44. in Genesis
which he would not conceal from us, but delay^^d his answer, that the Woman's
sedulity or diligence may become an example, and Doctrine to posterity, etc.

2. Some things are dissembling and Hypocritically spoken (and sometimes with a
bitter Sarcasm) which are true in themselves, but not conformable to the mind
of the speaker, as Genesis 37.19 Joseph's Brethren said one to another, behold this
master of Dreams comes, etc. Such indeed Joseph was, for verse 5. he gave
information of things to come, and had the gift of interpreting others Dreams,
as chapters 40. and 41. But his Brethren did not so repute him, but call him so
in a way of Mockery and Derision.

2 Samuel 6.20. Michael said to David her husband. How glorious was the King of
Israel to day, etc. David was truly glorious in that sacred gesture and Art, as
he himself says, ver. 21, 22. but to her it seemed to be lightness and
scurrility, void of Royal gravity, for it is said, ver. 16. That she despised
him in her heart, Psalm. 22.8. He trusted in the Lord that he would deliver him,
let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. These things were most true in
themselves, but in the opinion of those mockers false, who by this bitter
Sarcasm denied Christ hanging on the Cross, as Matthew. 27.43. See Esa. 5.19.

Matthew. 22.16. The Disciples of the Pharisees being sent to Christ say, Master
we know that thou art true, and teach the way of God in Truth, neither
carest thou for any man: For thou regardest not the person of Men -- These
words were true of our Savior Christ, but not conformable to the mind of the
Pharisees, who spoke by way of snare and Irony, as Luke 20.20. appears. See
Matthew. 27.29, 40, 42, 43. Mark 15.29. etc.

3. Some things manifestly false, and spoken with an intention to deceive, by
such as knew it to be otherwise, are set forth by way of (...).
history and Narration, as Genesis 3.4. And the Serpent (that is the Devil in the
Serpent) said unto the Woman, ye shall not surely die, for (ver. 5.) God does
know, that in the Day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye
shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil. -- This the Father of lies knew to be
quite otherwise, but would by that falsehood circumvent and deceive Eve. By the
opening of their Eyes, which he by a fallacy Promises is intimated the
accuteness of the mind and understanding, in comparison of which the former
concreated Wisdom may seem to be blindness -- Thus the deceiver plays his game
to the destruction of Adam and his Posterity, had not immense Grace stepped in to
prevent it.

Matthew. 2.8. Herod says to the Wisemen -- Go and search diligently for the
young Child, and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come
and Worship ^^im also -- His intention was to destroy the Child Jesus, which,
by the inhumane and execrable Massacre of the Children afterward, is evident,
but by this Irony and Hypocrisy, he would delude the Wise men.

Lastly, There are some things where there seems to be an Irony, but when the
thing is more exactly considered, there is none, is Jer. 4.16. The Watchers (or
keepers) come from a far Country, etc. Some think that by a Watchman, or
Keepers (by an Antiphrasis or Irony,) we are to understand destroyers. But in
Truth the Babylonians are to be understood, who for their own safety and profit
were watchers, lying in wait about the Fields, lest any thing should escape
away, or get from them, as hunters who watch every place of egress out of a
Wood, lest the Beasts they hunt, should escape into the open Fields, as verse
17.

Ezekiel. 3.24. Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke
unto me, and said unto me, go shut thy self within thine house. Junius and
Tremel^^ius allege, that these and the following words are to be understood by
an Irony; as if he had said, is it a Prophets office to hide himself, when I
bid him go forth -- There are others which say, that it was spoke by way of
Sarcasm and indignation -- paraphrasing thus; if thou art resolved to disobey
my Command, go into thine own House, and experience what it is to contend with
me -- such Sarcasms are found, Judge. 10.14. Esa. 50.11. But the truth is, that,
because God had sufficiently instructed the Prophet by his Spirit, and gave him
courage to publish his Will, and because we do not read that this Prophet used
any Tergiversation or shuffling to avoid the work appointed him (as we read of
Moses, Exodus 3.11. and 4.10, 13. Of Jeremy Chap. 1.6. and 20.9. Of Jonas, Chap.
1.3.) the best way is to interpret these words properly as they sound, viz.
that it is a serious Command of God, that he should shut himself in his House,
and dispatch his Prophetical Actions mentioned chap. 4. (see also chap. 8.1.)
to which belongs, what is added of the binding of men (as it were with Cords)
by Angels at the Command of God, as verse 25. For God uses these ministering
Spirits in his Government of men; and that which is spoken chap. 4. belongs to
these, is evident by the 8th. verse of that chapter, etc.

Matthew. 4.3. The Tempter says to Jesus, if thou be^^st the Son of God, command
that these Stones may be made Bread. In which Words Theophylact says, there is
an Irony, as if he had said, neither art thou the Son of God, neither can
thou do this. But more truly it is to be interpreted a Diabolical fraud, for
Trial of a thing by him not certainly known, as D. Chemnitius. In his
Evangelical Harmony says, cap. 19. viz.

The Devil had a double purpose.

(1.) To know whether Jesus was really the Son of God by this Reason, that if
by his bare Word or Command he could turn Stone into Bread, then of certain he
is the Son of God; therefore he says not Pray, but Command, but if in the
extremity of his hunger and necessity, he cannot do this, then he cannot be the
Son of God, and therefore Satan would take occasion to despise and mock him,
thus, in vain do you trust to that heavenly voice ( Matthew. 3.17.) and believe,
or hope that others shall believe thee to be the Son of God.

(2.) By that Temptation the Devil endeavors to entice Christ into some sin,
or distrust of the Divine Oracle, or into a vain ostentation, or empty Glory,
if by the Devils suggestion he should work a Miracle, etc.

John 18.38. Pilate said unto him, what is Truth? In which words some say there
is an Irony. But in exact speaking (of this Trope) there appears to be no
repugnancy betwixt the words, and the mind of the speaker, but rather a supine
or careless contempt and disdain of truth in the Heart of Pilate, who argues by
way of diminution ((...)) or slight the matter, as if he had said, if there be
a dispute betwixt the Jews and thee, about the Truth of Religion, I do not
Judge it of that weight, as to lose my time to hear your altercations (or
frivolous contentions) etc.

John 14.14. And he (Pilate) says, unto the Jews, Behold your King, which is
taken as Ironically spoken, by many -- as if he had mocked the Jews, then
accusing so abject, low, and contemptible a man, that would aspire at the
Government, and threaten the Monarchy of the Caesar's. But it is more proper to
say, that Pilate had respect to the public acclamation of the People four days
before (when they saluted Jesus as their King,) Luke 19.38. John 12.12, 13. In
this sense they are the Words of the Excellent D. Gerhard Harmo. Evangel. in
^^i^^or. pau^. c. 11.
Jam olim, expectatis Regem vobis promissum, etc. For some time past you have
expected your promised King, but so soon as he appears do you wish him dead?
Consult your own honor, and let it not be said that you furiously persecuted
him, to whom you have given Royal Honor. Caesar does not fear this King; do
you rather pity him, and give over your thoughts of Crucifying him. If he be
really your King, why, with so great fury do you, design him for such heavy
punishment, whom you ought rather to defend? But if he has falsely boasted
himself to be a King, dismiss him with stripes, which (for his temerity) will
be enough to the sufferer. So therefore by a secret instinct of God, Pilate
confesses Jesus to be a King, even before his crucifixion, as he afterward
attributed a Royal Name and Honor to him in the inscription upon the Cross,
that we may understand that he therefore died, because he is our King, and that
the Government is upon his Shoulders, Esa. 9.6. etc.

Acts 23.5. Then said Paul I wist not Brethren, that he was the High Priest,
upon which words we will transcribe the paraphrase of the learned Rivet. In
Isagog. ad Scriptur. Sacr. c. 21 Sect. 8.
I know there are many who assert that the Apostle spoke this by an Irony,
because when he lived among the Pharisees, and being himself a Pharisee,
although the person should be unknown to him, yet by the manner of that Courts
sitting, he could not but Judge who among them was Chief or High Priest, having
said ver. 3. That he sat to Judge him after the Law. But to me it seems more
probable, that Paul, hearing a voice from some of those that sat to Judge (for
the Priests and all the Counsel came, as Acts 22.30.) and not knowing from whom
it came, spoke so. He judged it not to come therefore from the High Priest,
because so hasty and rash a signification of offense did not become his Office
and Authority, nor was such a speech of (at least dissembled) Sanctity like to
proceed from him. It is therefore plain that this Council was not convened in
the accustomed place, where the Judicatory order and debates was defined or
assigned to be according to every ones dignity and merit, but near the Tower,
whither they were called from the Tribunal where Paul was, which is indicated
in the 30 ver. of the preceding chapter. -- And he Commanded the Chief Priest
and all their Council to appear (in the Greek it is (...), to come) Paul
therefore hearing a voice from that Company, denounces Gods punishment to the
speaker; for all they that came with the High Priest sat to Judge. See also
Fr. Junius paral. 1.98. etc.

1 Cor. 6.4. If then ye have Judgment (or Judicatories) of things pertaining
to this Life, set them to Judge who are least esteemed in the Church -- Some
say that these Words are an Irony, because Paul says verse 5. I speak to your
shame (or blushing) But it is more probable that the Apostle spoke seriously --
Erasmus upon the place says, The Apostle speaks thus, because he would not have
Christians to contend before the wicked, but that they should rather choose the
meanest Christian as an arbitrator of their Cause, then wrangle before those
Tribunals. Aretius upon the place, says, The Apostle delivers his mind about
what they should do, for they allege thus, you prohibit us to try our
controversies before the Heathen Tribunals, but where shall we have a competent
and capable Judge? The Church not only wants a Magistracy, but also Persons fit
to determine and compose such differences as ours. The Apostle answers, that
the latter is untrue because the meanest Christian in these matters have a
right of equality with the greatest. The dignity of the Church is great, for
Paul judges the meanest worthy of the Office of being Judges, rather then
appeal to a Heathen Judge, What shall we not therefore hope from Superiors? But
that phrase ver. 5. (...), ( I speak it to your shame) is thus well expounded
by Aretius. This is a new Argument taken from public shame, for to wrangle or
go to Law, before a Pagan Judge, was no less then to bring a scandal upon the
Church: Therefore there is a caution given against that, and because brought
occasion of shame upon the Church, therefore the Apostle says deservedly, I
speak it to your shame, etc.

CHAP. VI. Of a Metaphor in General.
OF a Metaphor in general, let the following things be noted.

1. As to its Definition, it is said to be a [ Trope,] when a word is
trans^^ated from its proper and Genuine signification to another less proper --
Or when like is signified by like. Fabius lib. 8. c. 6. calls it a short
similitude -- There are other Definitions, but all to this sense. Some in
handling the Definition of this Trope tell us, that a Metaphor may be taken,
either from a simple similitude, or from Analogye or proportion. And that these
two are different, because there may be a similitude betwixt two, as between a
living and a painted man whence the name of the Man is ascribed to the picture.
But in proportion two answers two, as Aristotle in his second Book of the Soul
compares a ^^oot to the Mouth, because it performs the same office to a Plant,
as the Mouth does to a living Creature -- Here is indeed a double similitude,
for a Plant is compared to a living Creature, and the Root to his Mouth,
because Plants receive their nourishment from the Root, as a living Creature
does by the Mouth. Of the first sort is that Metaphor, when drops of Dew are
called Pearls, when Flowers are called Stars, or a gross corpulent man is
called a hog. Of the later are, when the master of a Ship has been by Poets
compared to a Waggoner, and e contra, because he takes the same care of his
Wagon, as as the Master does of his Ship. In Scripture Metaphors we shall
observe the same distinction, but promiscuously.

2. As to its difference from a similitude and Parable, the difference is
either contracted, or more large; for in a similitude there is a manifest
comparison of one thing with another, and so it is a logical Argument; but in a
Metaphor there is one thing put for another that is like it, which nevertheless
in its explication is to be handled by an apparent similitude. And we are to
note here* that frequently in Scripture (especially in the Proverbs of Solomon)
a Word or Phrase may be expounded by the deficient particle, And in such it is
rather a contracted Similitude, then a Metaphor; and therefore many things of
that nature are not hereafter reckoned amongst Metaphors.

3. As to its Dignity, as this Trope is the most frequent, so it the most
florid and pleasant, giving a most wonderful energy or power, and evidence to
the style of Holy Scripture, so that it may be truly called, the Academy or
School, where God Communicates the knowledge of Nature and the Creation to his
Scholars, (...)* ^^tc
affording matter enough for their most serious and diligent study, making
plain those Divine and glorious matters therein revealed in terms which call
for deep scrutiny and search into their Nature and Proprieties. For as Rivet
tells us, Isag. ad Script. Sacr. cap. 5. p. 49. The Scripture chiefly treating
about things relating to Grace and Glory, yet affords occasion for the
perfection and study of all Phylosophical knowledge, and borrows so much of
natural things, as may serve for a looking-glass to represent Divine things to
our Eyes, etc.

4. As to the manner of handling, whereas the properties of things from whence
they are deduced, are many and various, there must be great care and accuracy
used to find out the Reason of the similitude, and the Scope or intention of
the Comparison, lest there may be an Abberration from the proper coherence of
the Text, or the Analogy of Faith, to do this it is needful that a person be
well acquainted with the respective Natures, and the Phylosophical Notions and
Theories of all things from whence this Trope is taken, as also with the
peculiar Customs, and distinct qualities of other Nations, particularly the
ancient Jewish state in their Ecclesia^^tical and Civil Government and
Economy; besides the knowledge of the Original Languages, (in which the
Scriptures were penned, as Hebrew and Greek) which very frequently carry a
native Grace and emphatical fullness, hardly expressible (with the same beauty
and significancy) in a Translation.

More particularly there ought to be care taken, that one Metaphor be not
strained to express things in themselves quite opposite, nor make the parallels
run till they grow lame; for one Metaphor may be brought to signify many
things, with respect to some different qualities and diverse Attributes. Thus
Christ is called a Lion, Rev. 5.5. because noble Heroic and unconquerable: The
Devil is called a Lion, because roaring, rapacious and devouring, 1 Pet. 5.8.
Wicked men and Tyrants are called so, Job 4.10, 11. 2 Timothy 4.17. Because they
are fierce, outrageous, and cruel to weaker men, as the Lion is to weaker
Creatures.

By the like Reason an Unicorn is compared to the Goldly, with respect to its
strength and courage, Psalm. 92.10. And to the wicked because of its desperate
boldness and spitefulness, Psalm. 22.21.

[ Leaven] expresses the wonderful force and penetrating virtue of the Word and
Kingdom of God, Matthew. 13.33. With respect to its piercing and diffusive
quality; but it is applied to corrupt and evil Doctrine, Matthew. 16.6. 1 Cor.
5.6, 7. Because of its malignant and sowring quality, which is also very
spreading, and insinuates it self into all the parts.

[ Sleep] Metaphorically denotes the quiet and peaceable Death of the Godly, 1 Thessalonians. 4.13, 14. And the carnal security, carelessness, and infidelity of
sinners. Romans 13.11. Ephesians. 5.14.

The [ Sun] amongst other things denotes happiness, because of its light and
splendour, Judge. 5.31. and in felicity or misfortune because of its scorching
and excessive heat, Psalm. 121.6. Matthew. 13.6, 21. etc.

[ A shadow] signifies protection against evils, as Esa. 49.2. and many other
places -- because it defends from intemperate heat. It also denotes great
perils and calamities (as Psalm. 23.4. Luke 1.79.) because of its darkness and
foggyness, which are symbols of sorrow and evil.

[ A River] Metaphorically denotes plenty of good and desirable things, Psalm.
36. 8. -- 46.4. Esa. 66, 12. Because of the abundance of its Waters and the
usefulness thereof well known -- It also denotes terrors, perils, and
overwhelmings, Psalm. 18.4. and 124.4. because of the danger of its rapid and
sudden inundations.

The [ Harvest] is used in a good sense, Psalm. 126.4, 5, 6. Matthew. 9.37. And
elsewhere, because of the great profit and necessity of the gathered fruit.
It Is also used in a bad sense, Jer. 51.33. Joel 3.13. because it is cut down
and destroyed.

[ Treasure and Treasurer] is also to be understood in a good sense, Matthew.
6.20. etc and in a bad sense, Romans 2.5. both are joined, Matthew. 12.35.

Sometimes Metaphors taken from diverse things, are joined together, where
there is a necessity of a distinct enumeration; an evident example of this we
have, Lam. 3. to the 16. ver. Where Metaphors are taken sometimes from Men of
different circumstances and capacities; sometimes from Beasts to set forth the
punishments inflicted by God. So in Ephesians. 2.20. The Metaphors taken from Civil
Society, and from building are joined together, to set forth the Mystical
Conjunction of the Godly in Christ, etc.

5. As to the variety of the Metaphors Bartholinus rightly says, That they may
be taken from all things in the World, whether substances or accidents, natural
or artificial things. And Cicero says, Nihil est in rerum natura, unde simile
duci non possit, lib. 3. de oratione.
that there is nothing in nature from whence a similitude may not be brought,
adding, that the variety of Metaphors is almost infinite.

Others say, that it is as possible to empty the Sea with sieve, as to reduce or
confine Metaphors to certain Classes or bounds. -- The like may (in a manner)
be said of the Metaphors in Holy Scripture. But in as much as it is very
profitable for such as are studious in that Sacred Writing, it shall be
endeavored so to dispose of most, if not all, the Metaphors (as much as may be
done among such a multitude of them) found there, especially the most frequent
and illustrious, as that they may be reduced to a certain Order, under their
respective Heads, which will enable us to give a found judgment of the most
Elegant and Rhetorical part of the Bible. And if any be missing, the Harvest
being large, it may stir up others to gather up and improve the gleanings.

6. As to the right distribution or distinction of Metaphors into their right
Classes or Heads, some take the Method of Plutarch and Quintilian (who to avoid
confusion in such an infinite variety, which can scarce be concluded or
terminated by art, rightly say, that the most illustrious sort of Metaphors are
to be expounded and distinguished under certain heads) and they make them four,
viz. 1. From animate things (viz. such as have life) to animate, as when God is
put for a Magistrate, or a Shepherd for a Prince or Ruler. 2. From animate
things to inanimate (viz. things which have no life) as when the Earth is said
to Groan, and the Olive to Lie. 3. Or from inanimate things to animate, as when
Christ is called a Door, a Vine, etc. 4. Or from inanimate things to inanimate,
as when the Mystery of Salvation, is called a foundation, 1 Timothy 6.19. 2 Timothy
2.19. etc.


Others not respecting things as they are in Nature, observe a Grammatical
series, or order, because Metaphors, are found in Nouns, Verbs and Adverbs.

In Nouns Substantives, as where it is said Deuteronomy. 22.14. The fat of the Kidneys
of Wheat, for choice grains of Wheat, where is a double Metaphor.

First, In ( Fat) for the choiceness or preciousness, and

Secondly, In ( Reins) which is put for Grains, because they are like them in
Form; and both are joined because the Reins in a living Creature are covered
with Fat.

Thus Christ is called the Light of the World, Joh. 8.12. The Good Shepherd,
Joh. 10.11. The Apostles are called the Salt of the Earth, Matthew. 5.13. etc.

In Nouns Adjective, as when one is said to be of Uncircumcised Lips, Ears,
Heart, as Exodus 6.12. Jer. 6.10. and 9.26. For to be of an impure and sinful
heart -- when the unbelieving and worldly minded man is said to be Dead, Mat.
8.22. -- When the Word or Heavenly Doctrine is said to be sound; 1 Timothy 1.10.
and 6.3. 2 Timothy 1.13. and 4.3. etc.

In Verbs, As when it is said of the Wicked they shall wither, Psalm. 37.2. That
is, they shall perish, The Soul is said to thirst, when it earnestly and
vehemently desires any thing, Psalm. 42.2. So when putting on is taken for
assuming, as Ephesians. 4.24.

In Adverbs, As when to take a thing hardly is put for Grief and Sorrow, as
Genesis 21* 11. To speak hardly is put for roughly or severely, as Genesis 42.7. To
be grievously wounded is put for very much; 1 King. 22.34. Thus in the vulgar
Latin Edition, but the Hebrew is without Adverbs there.

But a more proper Example is in Matthew. 26.75. He wept (...), bitterly, that
is, very much; a Metaphor taken from Taste; So (...) Splendidly, is put for
eminently or sumptuously; Luke 16.19.

But waving these, our method shall be to consider this Trope (1.) More
Specially. (2.) More Generally.
1. More Specially, which shall be about things that are translated to God,
which properly belong to Man. Chap. 7. The 2. About what things belonging to
other Creatures are ascribed to God, Chapter 8. The 3. When things properly
ascribable to persons, are attributed to things that are not persons, Chap. 9.
4. More Generally, which shall be to lay down the distinct Heads and Classes of
Metaphors, with succinct Explications of each. 5. We shall produce such
Metaphors taken from God and the Creatures, as are obvious in Universal Nature.
chapter 10, 11.12. 6. Such as are taken from Sacred persons and things, as Divine
Worship, etc. Chap. 13.


CHAP. VII. Of Metaphors Translated from Man to God, which kind is called (...).
ANthropopatheia is a Metaphor by which things properly belonging to Creatures,
Quaecunque a creaturis transferuntur ad Deum, repurganda prius sunt ab omnibus
imperfectionibus, et tum demum id, quod perfectum e^^, Deo attribuendum.

Quis aequo animo audiat, er non potius abhorreat ab illiusmodi (...), quam
inculcat? D. Calixti paraphr. page 255. Harmon Evangel.


especially Man, are by a certain similitude attributed to God and Divine
things. It is likewise called (...), condescension, because God in his Holy Word
descends, as it were, so low as our capacities, expressing his heavenly
Mysteries after the manner of men, which the Hebrews elegantly call The way of
the Sons of men.

In this Metaphor it is very necessary to take great heed that no mean, base,
or indecent thing be attributed to the most High and Holy Majesty, but that the
Reason of the similitude be always improved with this Caution or Canon of
Divinity* viz.

Whatsoever is translated from Creatures to God, must first be separated from
all imperfections, and then that which is perfect may safely be ascribed to
God; To understand these similitudes, as the Lord descends graciously to us, so
let us with a Devout mind (by Faith and Prayer) ascend unto him, comparing
spiritual things with spiritual, 1 Cor. 2.13. That we may have honorable
apprehensions of him and his Divine Mysteries, which cannot be done without the
aid of the Holy Spirit, who only knows the things of God, and the depths of his
Wisdom, revealing them to men by the Word, 1 Cor. 2.10, 11.

To this may our Saviors speech be referred John 6.53. When by a similitude of
humane things he speaks of the participation of heavenly things, some of the
Disciples being of gross and carnal understandings said, This is an hard
Speech, who can hear it? abhorring such Flesh eating, and Blood drinking, to
whom Christ says, ver. 63. It is the spirit that quickneth, the flesh profits
nothing: The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit and they are Life.
That is, my words are not to be received in the mode and measure of vulgar or
Earthly things, but waving such thoughts by the aid and guidance of the Spirit,
as things spiritually spoken they are to be spiritually understood, and by
Faith to be believed, for so they are Life and give Life, etc.

In proceeding we shall not only show those Metaphors that respect God,
considered singly in his Essence and Divine Majesty, but also as manifest in
the flesh.

Some Metaphors are taken from Man, and some from other Creatures.

From Man -- as 1. His Parts and Members. 2. His Affections. 3. His Actions. 4.
His Adjuncts. Of which in order.


The Parts and Members of a Man attributed to God.
Soul.
A Soul is attributed to God, by which his Life, Essence, and Will, and
therefore God himself, is understood: For as man lives and operates by the
Soul, so God in himself is Essential Life, and a most pure act -- My Soul shall
not abhor you, Lev. 26.11. The wicked his Soul hates, Psalm. 11.5. See Esa.
1.^^4. and 42. 1. Jer. 5.9.29. Matthew. 12.8. Heb. 10.38. Hence the Lord is said
to swear by his Soul, Jer. 51.14. Amos 6.8. that is, by himself, as our
Translation renders, it and agreeable to Esa. 45.23. Jer. 22.5. Heb. 6.13.
Where it is expounded.

Body.
[ A Body] by reason of his incorporeal Essence is no where attributed to God,
but it is ascribed to our Savior Christ in a twofold respect.

1. As opposed to the Shadows, Figures and Types in the Old Testament, the
Truth, Complement or Fulfilling of the things prefigured by these Shadows,
being held forth in him, Col. 2.17. Which are a shadow of things to come, but
the Body is of Christ, that is, the Truth and Complement is in Christ. And Col.
2.9. It is said that in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead (...)
Bodily, that is, most really, perfectly, and solidly, not in a Typical or
shadowy manner, as God manifested himself in the Old Testament.

2. The Church is called the Body of Christ, Ephesians. 1.22, 23. And (God) gave him
to be the Head over all things to the Church, which is his body, the fullness of
him that fills all in all. It is called his Body, because he Rules it, giving
Sense, Life and Spiritual motion to it, as a man's head does to his body. It is
called his fullness, because (though Christ is absolutely perfect in himself,
and has no need of us) his Love is so great to his Church, that he will not be
without it, any more then a head would be willing to want his members. Father,
I will that they also whom thou have given me, be with me where I am, etc. John
17.24. Ephesians. 4.12, 15, 16. So much for Christ's Mystical Body. As for the humane
Body of our Lord, it being really and not metaphorically such, it concerns not
this place.

Head.
God is called the [Head] of Christ. 1 Cor. 11.3.

(1.) With respect to his humane Nature, for in that sense Christ's says the
Father is greater then he, John 14.28. (2.) With respect to his Office as
Mediator and Redeemer, for all the actions of Christ were done by the Will,
Order, and Commission of the Deity.

The Apostle by the figure Climax, or a certain Gradation in the same text
calls Christ the head of the Man, because he chose that Sex, when he took
humane Nature upon him, so becoming the first^^born among many Brethren, Rom
8.29. He also calls man the Head of the Woman, because of the pre-eminence of
Sex, and being ordered her Lord and Superior. In these places the Word is
Metaphorical, in respect of eminency, because the head in the natural body is
seated highest, excelling the whole body in dignity of sense and reason.

(3.) In respect of Rule and Government, the natural body being ruled by it,
etc.
More generally Christ is called the Head of the Church Ephesians. 1.22. and 4.15.
Col. 1.18. etc. In which sense man has no prerogative over the Woman, as to the
participation of the benefits of Christ, and Mystical Union with him, Gal.
3.28. Neither Male nor Female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. Hence it is
said Ephesians. 1.10. That he might gather together in one head all things in Christ,
both which are in Heaven and which are on Earth, which Chrysostom well
interprets, viz. (...).
It is done by the mystery of Redemption, that Celestial and Terrestrial
things, that is, Angels and Men, should have one head, that is, Christ, whereas
before by reason of man's sin, heavenly things were separated from Earthly.

[ A Face] Is attributed to God, Face.
by which the manifestation of himself to Angels and Men, and the various
workings of his Providence is to be understood; for so God is known to us, as
one man is known by his face, to another: the Face of God, signifies
manifestation.

1. In the blessed state of Eternity, Psalm. 16.11. With thy Face is fullness of
Joys, (so the Hebrew) and Psalm. 17.15. I will behold thy Face in Righteousness:
I shall be satisfied when I awake in thy likeness. Matthew. 18.10. Their Angels
do always behold the Face of my Father which is in heaven. In this sense no man
can see Gods Face and Live, Exodus 33.20, 23. For now we see through a glass
darkly, but then Face to Face, 1 Cor. 13.12. etc.

2. In the state of Mortality, when God in any measure reveals himself. As,

(1.) By the Face of God his presence and propitious aspect is noted, as Exodus
13.21. The Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, and by night in
a pillar of Fire, Exodus 33.14. My Face (so the Hebrew) shall go with thee, and
I will give thee rest, and verse 15. Moses said, If thy Face go not (with us)
cause us not to go up hence, etc. that is, if you be not present as heretofore
in the pillar of a Cloud and Fire.

Hence that appellation given to Christ is deduced, Esa. 63.9. The Angel of his
Face or presence, because by the pillar of a Cloud and Fire in a visible manner
he led the Israelites of old, and made the Face of God (as it were) conspicuous
to them: others say it is because he is the image of the invisible God, by whom
we know the Father as one man is known by his Face to another, Col. 1.15. John
14.9, 10. which cannot be said of any other.

The Face of God signifies also that glorious appearance of God to the people
on Mount Sinai, Deuteronomy. 5.4. And that more illustrious manner of his Revealing
himself to Moses above any other, Deuteronomy. 34.10. See Numb. 12.6, 7, 8. etc.
Sometimes the Face of God is put for the place where God reveals himself, and
where the Ministry of the word flourishes, or as Jehovah himself words it,
Exodus 20.24. Where he Records his Name, etc. Thus Cain is said to go forth from
the Face of God, Genesis 4.14.16. that is, from the place where his Parents
worshipped him, and Jonah rose up to flee from the Face of the Lord -- that is,
left the Church and People of God, to go to Tarshish among Infidels; not, but
that he knew, that none can so fly from the Face of God, as to be unseen by
him, but he thought that there was no place for Divine Revelations besides the
Holy Land, and therefore hoped that in those strange places God would no longer
trouble him, Vid. Brentium in loc.
nor impose so hard a Province upon him as to Preach against Ninive, etc. See
Exodus 23.15. and 25.30. Psalm. 100.1, 2, 3. and 104.4. 2 Samuel 21. 1. Psalm.
139.7. Lev. 17.10. Psalm. 9.4. etc. Sometimes wrath and divine punishment is
noted by the Face of God, as Psalm. 68.1. Let them that hate him flee before his
Face -- Jer. 21.10. I have set my Face against this City for evil, etc. Lam.
4.16. The Face of the Lord has divided them, etc. 2 Thessalonians. 1.9. 1 Pet. 3.12.

Sometimes the Grace, Favor, and Mercy of God is expressed by it, as Dan. 9.17.
Psalm. 13.2. Ezekiel. 39.24. Psalm. 31.20. Psalm. 17.2. 2 Chronicles. 29.12. Number. 6.25,
26. Psalm. 4.7, and 31.17. and 67.1, 2, 3. Psalm. 80.4, 8, 20. It Is said of men
to seek the Face of God, that is his Grace and favor by Prayer, Psalm. 27:8. 2 Chronicles. 7.14, 17. Esa. 18.3. etc.

God is said to have [ Eyes, Eyes*
] by which we are to understand his most exact knowledge, Psalm. 11.4. His Eyes
behold-his eyelids try the Children of men -- (In the word Eyebrows there is
also a Synedoche) Job 34.21. See Caryl on the place. 10. vol. p. 656.
For his Eyes are upon the ways of man, and he sees all his goings, that is,
he clearly discerns and understands the ways of man, which intimates, 1. A
present act (they are.) 2. A continued act, his Eyes are never off the ways of
man. 3. An intentive and serious act, this denotes not only a bare sight, but
also that which is operative, as being done, with most exact scrutiny and
disquisition -- God looks through and discerns men to the utmost, he beholds
not only the external acts of men, but also the soul and Spirit of them.

Esa. 1.16. Put away the evil of your doings from before mine Eyes, that is, be
ye pure inwardly as well as outwardly, for I see through you, etc.

It is said Hos. 13.14. Repentance shall be hid from mine Eyes -- that is, they
do not Repent at all, therefore will I not respite the sentence, but execute it
certainly -- for that which is hid from the Eyes or knowledge of the Omniscient
God, is not, nor can have existence, Psalm. 110.4. Romans 11.29. Esa. 65.16.

Heb. 4.13. All things are naked and opened unto the Eyes of him with whom we
have to do -- the word (...) rendered in our Translation ( opened) is very
Emphatical, (...), in collum c^^u cervicem resupino. (...) totam spinam Dorsi
significat. Hemming. in Com.
for it signifies a dissection, quartering, or cleaving asunder through the
backbone, as they do in Anatomy, wherein they are very curious to find out
every little Vein or Muscle, though never so close, so as nothing can be hid --
The Apostle therefore translates this word to his purpose, to signify that all
the secrets of Hearts are so exposed to the notice and view of God, as if all
were dissected and opened like a mere Anatomy.

2. By the [ Eyes] of God may be understood his providential Grace and divine
benevolence to men, Deuteronomy. 11.12. A Land which the Lord thy God cares for (or
seeks) the Eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of
the year, even unto the end of the year -- that is, he graciously cherishes,
takes care for and defends it, 1 Kings 9.3. I have hallowed this house which
thou have built, to put my Name there for ever, and mine Eyes and mine Heart
shall be there perpetually -- that is, my presence and blessing shall be there
with you. 2 Chronicles. 16.9 For the Eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the
whole Earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them, whose Heart is
perfect toward him -- and Ezra 5.5. The Eye of their God was upon the Elders
of the Jews, etc. that is, they are under his care and gracious protection,
while they build the House of the Lord, Psalm. 32.8. I will guide thee with mine
Eye, that is, I will inform thee by my spirit, and will lead thee in a right
way. See Psalm. 34.15. 1 Pet 3.12. Ezekiel. 20.17. and 5.11. and 7.4. Deuteronomy. 32.10.
Psalm. 17.8. Zach. 2.8. and 3.9. with 4.10.

3. Sometimes the [ Eye] of God signifies divine wrath and punishment, as Amos
9 4. I will set mine Eyes upon them for evil, and not for Good. And Esa. 3.8.
Their Tongue and their Doings are against the Lord, to provoke the Eyes of his
glory.

Ears.
[ Ears] are attributed to God, which denotes not only his knowledge of all
things done on Earth, but also that he understands, approves of, and gives
gracious Returns to the Prayers and Applications of his people, Psalm. 10.17.
and 31.3. and 55.1, 2. and 71.2. and 130.2. By the Ears of God we are to
understand that,

2. He knows the sins of men, which are said to Cry, and enter into the Ears of
the Lord, Jam. 5.4. Esa. 5.9.

There is a very Emphatical phrase of the promise of the Messiah, Psalm. 40.6.
Mine Ears have thou dug; that is, thou have marked me as a faithful servant
to thy self -- by this the most perfect servitude and obedience is noted from
the Son (as incarnate or made flesh) to the Father. Messiah in duali de auribus
suis loquitur, ad eminentiam spiritualis suae servitutis and obedientiae
notandam. Nose Et ecce ipsi mittunt faetorem ad nasum suum.
The metaphor is taken from a Custom amongst the Jews, that the servants Ear
should be bored through with an awl, and serve for ever, unless he would be
made free the seventh year, Exodus 21.6. Deuteronomy. 15.17. See Esa. 50.4, 5. Heb.
10.5.

[ A Nose] is attributed to God, Deuteronomy. 33.10. They (that is, the Levites) shall
put incense before thee, (in the Hebrew) to thy Nose -- some interpret it, to
thy Face, that is, before thee, Chaldee (...). The LXX (...).

Ezekiel 8.17. And lo, they put the branch to their Nose; this is rendered, and lo
they send a stink to their Nose, which the textual Masora says should be (...)
My Nose, (viz. Gods Nose, which opinion is taken up by Galatinus, Vatablus, and
Schindler -- but the word translated ( stick) signifies also, a Branch, so that
the meaning of the text (as Jerome says) must be. It was a custom for 25 men in
the likeness of Idols to hold a branch to their Noses, doubtless of palms,
which the Greeks call (...), that it may by these be signified that they
worship the Idols. See Ez. 15.2.

[ A Mouth] the instrument of speech is attributed to God, by which his Will,
Mouth. Quidam falso haec verba ad spiritualem vitam de torquent, ac si dictum
esset, animas non ali visibili pane, sed Dei verbo, e^^t id quidem in se verum,
sed alio respexit Moses, etc. Vatablus in loc.

Word, Sentence, Command, etc. is understood. As Josh. 9.14. 1 Samuel 15.24. 2
King. 24.3. Esa. 30.2. etc. There is a notable place, Deuteronomy. 8.3. Man does not
live by Bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the Mouth of the
Lord does man live -- that is, as God has appointed, and administered the means
of living, whether ordinary or extraordinary, (as that in the Desert was when
they were fed with Manna) upon which place Vatablus says thus, Some understand
these words of spiritual life, as if it had been said, that souls are not fed
by visible Bread, but by the Word of God; which indeed is true in it self, but
Moses had another meaning; for whereas no person had Bread, he alludes to the
Manna, which was sent as an extraordinary supply to the People, that it might
be received as an evident truth in all Ages, that man's life depends not upon
Bread or any external provision, but upon the good pleasure and providence of
God, which preserves natures order, and the Creatures being. So that the Word
of God is not put for Doctrine, but the Decree published by God in order to
that end. For the Lord throws not off his Creatures, for as he gives them life,
so he sustains it. Heb. 1.3. This speech of Moses is repeated by Christ, and
opposed to Satan's Temptation, Matthew. 4.4. upon which D. Calixtus has these
words. Our Savior neither affirms nor denies himself to be the Son of God, but
urges a most proper argument out of Deuteronomy. 8.3. Where Moses puts the Israelites
in mind how they were fed for forty years not by usual Bread, but by Heavenly
Manna, as if he had said -- I have no reason to despair, as if I must die for
want of Bread, neither is there any necessity that Bread should be produced by
miracle, because such are not to be wrought at the pleasure or curiosity of
every body, but then only when the Glory of God requires it, and when needful
in order to men's Salvation; for man lives not by bread alone, but by every word
which proceeds out of the Mouth of God, that is, by any other way, which God in
his immense power, and unconstrained will has constituted and appointed, that
thereby the Life of man may be supported.

It is said of Christ, Esa. 11.4. That he shall smite the Earth with the Rod of
his Mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked, agreeable
to 2 Thessalonians. 2.8 Whom (viz. the wicked one) the Lord shall consume, with the
Spirit of his Mouth -- by which is understood the Word of Christ, which shall
judge and condemn the wicked, John 12.48. The Chaldee translates it thus -- By
the speech of his lips will he slay the Antichrist or wicked Anti-God, as
Guido Fabricius in his Sy^^iack and Chaldee Lexicon renders it.

[ Lips] are ascribed to God, Job 11.5. when speech or external manifestations
of his mind are attributed to him -- O that God would speak and open his Lips
against thee. Sometimes Lips and a Tongue are attributed to God, when he is
angry, as Esa. 30.27. His Lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a
devouring Fire -- and his breath as an overflowing stream, etc. Upon which
Musculus thus paraphraseth. These things are ascribed to God after the manner
of men, and are terms borrowed from a Warrior vehemently provoked against his
Enemy, his face burns, that is, his eyes are inflamed, his Lips, and other
gesture betokening a violent indignation, etc. Psalm. 18.8. In the description
of Gods Anger, there are many similitudes borrowed from Tempests, Lightning,
and other dreadful things to terrify man. When God is said to speak to any
mouth to mouth, it denotes familiarity and intimacy, which prerogative the Lord
granted to Moses, Number. 12.8.

It is said Jer. 18.17. I will show them the Cervix the hinder part of the Neck.
back and not the Face, in the day of their calamity; whereby is signified a
denial of his Grace and Favor, which is to be understood by Face -- the word
translated back signifies the hinder part of the Neck, and indicates Gods
Anger, as if he had said -- I will not vouchsafe to hear them when they call,
nor look upon them when they implore my help.

[ An Arm] is attributed to God, by which his strength and power is signified;
because the strength of a man is known by the strength of his Arm, whether it
be Labor, Fight, etc. Exodus 15.16. Job 40.4. Psalm. 77.16. Psalm. 79.11. Psalm.
89.11, 14. Esa. 30.30. and 51.9. and 59.16. and 62.8. and 63.5. Luke 1.51. etc.
A stretched out arm is ascribed to God, in his delivery of his People from
Egypt, Psalm. 136.11, 12. and Jer. 32.17. Thou have made the Heaven and the
Earth by thy great power and stretched out Arm, Metaphora a bellatoribus
pugnantibus vel alijs vehementius labori incumbentibus desumpta. Instar fortis
and ardentis bellatoris pugnabis tuis concionibus contra eam, etc.
etc. This Metaphor is taken from men fighting or when engaged in hard labor,
who with all their strength and force employ their Arms, which sometimes they
make bare to remove the impediments of Garments. Hence God says to the Prophet
Ezekiel chap. 4.7. -- Therefore shall thou set thy face before the siege of
Jerusalem, and thine Arm shall be uncovered, and thou shall prophecy against
it, that is, thou shall Preach against it with all thy might, as eagerly as a
Warrior goes to Battle.

Sometimes by the Arm of God the Doctrine of the Gospel is noted, as Esa.
52.10. The Lord has made bare his holy Arm, in the Eyes of all the Nations,
and all the ends of the Earth shall see the Salvation of our God. See ver. 7.8.
etc. So Esa. 53.1. It is said, Who has believed our Report, and to whom is the
Arm of the Lord revealed? Which is repeated, John 12.38. Some in these places (
and Esa. 51.9. and 59.16.) By the Arm of the Lord, do understand (and not
improperly) the Messiah, who is the Power and Wisdom of God, 1 Cor. 1.24.

A Hand
[ A Hand] is attributed to God, by which is understood his Power, exerting it
self in strong and mavelous operations. As Number. 11.23. Job 10.8. And 12.9,
10. Psalm. 8.7. And 95.5. Esa. 11.11. And 59.1. Or his strong and gracious
protection, Psalm. 31.6. Psalm. 144.7. John 10.28, 29. Act. 4.30. Or Infliction
of punishment, as Ezod. 9.3. Job 19.21. Psalm. 21.9. Psalm. 17.14. Psalm. 38.3.
Acts 13.11. From hence it is put Metonymically for the punishment it self
inflicted by God, as Job 23.2. My stroke (in the Hebrew it is Hand) is heavier
then my groaning. And Job 27.1^^. I will teach you by the Hand of God, that is,
the stroke or punishment of God. So Ezekiel 39.21. The phrase -- I will stretch
forth mine Hand, signifies, I will punish. Exodus 7.5. Esa. 5.25. and 9.12, 17,
21. and 10.4. and 14.27. and 31.3. Jer. 6.12. Ezekiel- 16.27. and 25.7. Zeph. 1.4.
and 2.13. So putting forth the Hand, Job. 1.11. and 2.5. Psalm. 138.7. So the
shaking of the Hand of the Lord, Esa. 19.16. signifies to be more grievously
punished, as Psalm. 32.4. So to lighten the Hand signifies to mitigate
punishment, 1 Samuel 6.5. See Ezekiel. 20.22. Esa. 1.25.

Acts 4.28. The Hand of God is put for his Counsel and purpose. Esa. 49.22. To
lift up the Hand to the Gentiles, signifies a merciful calling them to
Repentance, Prove. 1.24. Esa. 65.2. Because we lift up our Hands to such as we
would embrace, or whose presence we desire. To smite the Hands together (as
Ezekiel 21.17. and 22.13.) signifies a great Cujus signum apud homines manuum
complosio esse solet. (...) manus super solium Jah. Metaphora ab homine ducta,
qui quod manu ipsa apprehendit tenetque sibi datum, omnium certissime possidet,
etc.
detestation and averseness. To lift up the hand, (as Exodus 6.8. For so the
Hebrew is) signifies to swear, as also, Deuteronomy. 32.40. Ezekiel. 20.5.6. and 36.7.
etc. R. Salomo and Aben-Ezra expound Exodus 17.16. Of Gods Oath, viz. Because
the Hand of the Lord has sworn (so the Heb.) that the Lord will have war with
Amalek from generation to generation, that is, the Lord has sworn by his
Throne. The Chald. expounds it thus, it is asserted by an Oath, that is, by the
terrible One, whose Majesty dwells in the Throne of Glory, that there shall be
a War waged by the Lord, against the House of Amalek to cut them off for ever,
etc. Moses uses this phrase in allusion to what is spoke before verse 11. And
it came to pass that when Moses held up his Hand, that Israel prevailed, and
when he let down his Hand, Amalek prevailed, etc.

It is said, John 3.35. The Father loves the Son, and has given all things
into his Hand, denoting a communication of the fullness of the Godhead to his
humane nature. See Matthew. 11.27. and Col. 2.9.

Right hand.
A [Right hand] is ascribed to God, by which his Divine Power is understood, or
indeed the omnipotent God himself, as Exodus 15.6. Thy Right hand, O Lord, is
become glorious in power, thy Right hand, O Lord, has dashed in pieces the
Enemy, Psalm. 77.10. I will remember the years of the Right hand of the most
high, Psalm. 118.15, 16. The Right hand of the Lord does valiantly -- The Right
hand of the Lord is exalted, the Right hand of the Lord does valiantly, Psalm.
139.10: Even there shall thy Hand lead me, and thy Right hand shall hold me,
that is, thy power which is unlimited and diffused every where, Esa. 48.13.

More especially the Right hand of God notes his power, which he exerts in
Mercy and Bounty to Believers, Psalm. 20.7. and 18.36. and 44.4. and 63.9. and
8^^.16, 18. Sometimes his wrath and vengeance to his Enemies, as Exodus 15.6,
12, etc.

The Phrase of Christ's sitting at the Right hand of God, being exalted in his
humane Nature, as Psalm. 110.1. Matthew. 26.64. Mark. 16.19. Act. 2.33, 34. and
7.55.56. Romans 8.34. Col. 3.1. etc. is not to be understood properly, as if
there were a local situation in a certain place of Heaven, (...) in ell^^genda
et explicanda est.
but by an Anthropopathy or Scripture way of speaking, and is to be understood
of a Dominion and Power most powerfully and immediately operating and
governing, as it is explained, 1 Cor. 15.25. Ephesians. 1.20, 21, 22. and 4.10. Heb.
1.3, 4. and chap. 8.1.

A [Finger] is ascribed to God, A Finger
by which likewise his power and operating virtue is noted, as men work by the
help of their Fingers, Exodus 8.19. and 31.18. Psalm. 8.3. When I consider thy
Heavens, the work of thy Fingers, etc. Some apprehend that there is a
metaphorical emphasis in this place, because the Heavens were created with
extraordinary facility by God, and built very artificially, as the finest and
most precious sorts of workmanship are wrought by excellent Artists, not by
strength of body, nor with their Arms and Hands, but by the dexterity of their
Fingers.

By the Finger of God, the Holy Spirit is understood, if you compare Luke
11.20. with Matthew. 12.28. because it respects the virtue and power of its
operation, as Act. 10.38. etc.

If a man's Fingers be contracted, it is called the Hollow of his hand, if
extended, a Span, which by an Anthropopathy are ascribed to God, Esa. 40.12.
D^^gitis humanis constituitur pugi^^lus, si contra^^antur, et spithama, si
extendantur.
Who has measured the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand? And meted out the
Heavens with a Span, etc. that is to say, the Lord has done it; denoting how
easy it is to create all things, and most powerfully to support and govern
what he has Created: For as men by Engines and Devices, do lift up and advance
huge weights, etc. so it is much more easy for God to rule and dispose the
whole Universe at his pleasure. Prove. 30.4. etc. Esa. 48.13. etc.

A [Heart] is attributed to God, by which either his lively Essence is denoted,
A Heart.
as the heart in man is judged to be the principle or beginning of Life. Genesis
6.6. It greiv'd him at the Heart, that is, in himself -- or else his Will and
Decree, as Genesis 8.21. the Lord said in his Heart, that is, he decreed and
appointed. Chald. He said in his Word, Jer. 19.5. It came not up into my Heart
(so the Hebrew) that is, Hoc est. (...) ^^avore^^, (...). Bowels.
I did neither Will nor Command it: For the Scripture makes the Heart the seat
of the soul, whose property it is, to think, will, and discern.

More especially it signifies the good pleasure and approbation of God, 1 Samuel
13.14. The Lord sought him a man after his own Heart, that is, his favor, or
good will. So Act. 1^^.22. etc. Jer. 32.4^^. I will plant them in this Land
assuredly, with my whole Heart, and with my whole Soul, that is, with greatest
benevolence, regard and good Will.

[ Bowels] are attributed to Cod, by which his Mercy and most ardent love is
expressed, Esa. 63.15. Where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy
Bowels, and of thy Mercies toward me? Jer. 31.20. My Bowels are troubled for
him (that is, for Ephraim) Luke 1.78. Through the So the Greek runs (...), per
v^^cera miseric^^rdiae Dei n^^tri. (...) significat uterum. The word signifies
the Mothers Womb Flac. Illyr Clav. Script.
Bowels of the Mercy of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high has
visited us. Hence comes the Verb -- (...)* misericordia commoveri, to be moved
with Compassion, which is frequently said of Christ, as Matthew. 9.36. and 14.14.
and 15.32. Mark. 1.41. and 6.34. etc. See Gen 43.29. 1 King. 3.26 Psalm. 51.3.
See Esa. 63.7. etc, where the Hebrew word that signifies Bowels and
Compassionate love is ascribed to God. Illyricus upon the place -- says, that
this Metaphor is deduced from the love of Mothers to their Children, which they
bear in their Wombs, (the same Hebrew word signifying Bowels and Womb) because
the seat of affection is in the Bowels, and so Metonymically the thing
containing is put for the thing contained, or the Cause or Instrument for the
Effect -- agreeable to Esa. 46.3. Which are born by me, Dilecti mihi prae
omnibus populis, and chari prae omnibus regnis.
from the belly, which are carried from the Womb; which the Chaldee expresses,
You who are beloved by me beyond all people, and dear beyond all Kingdoms.
Others by the term ( womb) would properly understand the time of Conception and
Nativity, so denoting Gods Constant care and preservation even from the very
birth.

A Bosom.
A [Bosome] is in three places attributed to God, Psalm. 74.11. Why withdrawest
thou thy hand, even thy right hand? Pluck it out of thy Bosom, that is, suffer
thy right hand to be no longer idle, but employ it, (as if it were drawn from
thy Bosom,) in finishing thy glorious work, against thine and our Enemies. See
Prove. 19.24. and 26.15. R. Kimchi per sinum Dei Sanctuarium intelligit, quod
quaedam quasi latebra Dei est, ut sinus hominis. -- Christi (...) erga
peccatores Denotat^^r.
Rabbi Kimchi, by the Bosom of God, understands a Sanctuary, which is (as it
were) a certain hiding place for God, as a man's Bosom.

Esa. 40.11. He shall feed his flock like a Shepherd, he shall gather the Lambs
with his Arm, and Carry them in his Bosom, and shall gently lead those that are
with young. This is spoken of the Messiah, who is here compared to a Shepherd,
and his tender care of the Sheep and Lambs, Metaphorically sets forth his
extraordinary Philanthropy, or Love, Mildness, and Compassion to miserable
sinners, who are broken under the sense of Gods Wrath, and weak in Faith.
Shepherds are wont to bear their little and weak Lambs gently in their bosom,
as they carry the great Sheep upon their backs or shoulders, etc. So does
Christ in a spiritual sense, etc.

John 1.18. The only begotten Son, which is in the Bosom of the Father -- This
phrase metaphorically sets forth the most intimate Communion that is betwixt
God the Son, and God the Father, which consists,

1. With respect to eternal generation, for Parents are said to bear their
Children in their Bosoms, Number. 11.12. Have I begotten them, that thou
should say unto me, Carry them in thy Bosom, (as a Nursing Father bears
the sucking Child) etc. For the like reason, Prove. 8.30. the Son of God is
figured in the similitude of a child playing before his Father.

2. With respect to nearest and strictest Relation, or rather indeed Unity of
Nature and Essence, as John 14.10. it is said, that he is in the Father, and
the Father in him.

3. With respect to the dearest and superlative degree of love for, that which
is dear unto men is carried usually in their Bosom. As it is said of the
Disciple whom Jesus loved, John 13.23. That he was leaning on his Bosom, etc.

4. With respect to the most secret Communication: For the Son only knew, and
perfectly sees the Father, and therefore he alone reveals him and his heavenly
Mysteries to mankind. To which last particular, John chiefly had respect, as
appears by the Context.

Feet.
[ Feet] are attributed to God, by which his Immensity and Omnipresence upon the
Earth is noted or signified, as Esa. 66.1.

(2.) His Operation or Activity in crushing, supplanting, or destroying his
Enemies, as Psalm. 74.3. Lift up thy Feet unto the perpetual Desolations. See
Psalm. 110.1. etc. The Church is called the place of his Feet, Esa. 60.13.
Because he exhibits his grace and glory there, as if he had wal^^t in it,
agreeable to Deuteronomy. 33.3. All thy Saints sat down at thy Feet. Every one shall
receive of thy words. This metaphor is taken from the Custom of Scholars, who
sat at the Masters feet, Act. 22.3. As Paul was at the feet of Gamaliel. And (
Luke 10.39.) Mary who sat at Jesus feet and heard his words. The Clouds are
called the dust of his Feet, that is, as if he had walked upon the Clouds, as
men do upon the Dust of the Earth, and with extraordinary swiftness, as the
Clouds fly in the Air. See Esa. 19.1. and 60.8. and Psalm. 104.3.

[ Steps] are attributed to Christ before his incarnation, Psalm. 89.51. Steps.
Wherewith they have reproached the Footsteps of thine anointed, that is, the
Documents of the Messiah dwelling in us, who by his word raises us up,
Documenta habitantis in nobis Messiae, ut quod verbo suo, erigit et solatur,
etc. ^^ertul. lib. de Trinit. folio 601. efficaciae divinae per membra
monstrantur, etc.
and Comforts us in his promises of coming in the Flesh, and to Judgment, etc.
Others say that it is meant of some, who by way of derision, reproached the
Messiah for the delay of his coming, as proceeding with too slow a pace, that
is, that he would never come. The Chaldee -- They reproach and disgrace the
slow steps of the Feet of thy Christ, etc.

Thus much of the parts of a man, and the members of his Body, which I shall
conclude in the remarkable words of Tertullian (if that Book of the Trinity be
his) Divine efficacies (says he) are shown by Members, not the habit or
Corporeal lineaments of God, -- By his Eyes we are to understand that he sees
all things, and by his Ears that he hears all things, and by his Fingers some
significations of his Will and Mind, by his Nostrils, his savoury reception of
Prayers, as sweet Odors, by his Hand, his octive and creating power; by his
Arm, his irresistible strength; by his Feet, his ubiquity, etc. For members or
their particular offices are not necessary to him, whose tacit pleasure,
commands a ready obedience from all things. What needs he Eyes that is light it
self? What needs he Feet, that is every where? Why would he go in, when there is
not a place out of which he can go? What occasion has he for Hands, when his
silent will is the Builder, Contriver, or Architect of all things? What needs
he Ears, who knows even the most secret Thoughts? Or a Tongue, when his very
Thoughts are Commands? These Members are necessary for men, not for God,
because man's purposes are ineffectual, without the assistance of Organs to act
by, but Gods bare Will is Action producing Effects at his mere Pleasure -- To
Conclude he is all Eye, because every part of him sees all; all Ear, because
every part of him hears all; etc.

Humane Affections ascribed to God.
HEre we must note the difference of humane Affections, for some are attributed
to God, as being truly in him, yet not in that imperfect manner or per modum
accidentis.
way of accident, as they are in Man, but far more purely and eminently, and
that per modum essentiae seu substantiae Tom. 4. lib. 2. ad Simplicianum quest.
2. Misericordia, quasi miseria cordis.
essentially and substantially too. And so all words which express humane
Affections, are first to be separated from all in perfections, and then
understood of God. The words of Augustine are notable -- The Anger of a man
(says he) causes a disturbance and a torment in his mind; but the Wrath of God
executes its vengeance with a perfect equity and tranquillity, void of all
disturbance; the mercy of man has some mixture of heart misery, and from thence
in the Latin Tongue has its derivation -- The Apostle exhorts not only to
rejoice with the rejoicing, but also to weep with them that weep. But what man
of a sound mind can say that God can be touched with any anxiety or torture of
mind, the Scripture every where affirming him to be full of mercy. The zeal of
men is often tainted with a mixture of spite, envy, or some other disorderly
passion; but it is not so with God, for though his zeal is expressed by the same
word, yet it is not in the same manner with the Sons of Men.

The words of Chemnitius deserve notice, Scholars (says he) by a depraved
application of that Rule, that In deum non cadit accidens.
accidents have no place in God, In loc. Theolog. p. 29.
have taken away all Affections from him; and that most sweet consolation (Hos.
11.8, 9. My Heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I
will not execute the fierceness of mine Anger, I will not return to destroy
Ephraim, for I am God and not Man) they affirm should be taken according to
effection not affection. It is true indeed, that accidents having no place in
God his commiseration, is not such an affection as ours, but in regard his
Mercy is not distinguished from his Essence, it is certain, that it must be
much more ardently in God, then we are able to think, etc.

When [ Joy] or rejoicing are attributed to God, it either denotes his delight
and pleasure in his Creatures, Joy.
Psalm. 104.31. The Lord shall rejoice in his Works. Or else his gracious favor
and propensity to his Church, as men take Joy in things very dear to them, Esa.
62.5. As the Bridegroom rejoices over the Bride, so shall thy God rejoice over
thee. So Deuteronomy. 28.63. and 30.9. Jer. 32.41. etc. There is a Joy in God, which
exerts it self in gracious effects, but that is infinitely greater then it is
in men, or can be thought by them.

2. There are certain humane Affections, which according to their descriptions
in a proper way of speaking are not in God, but are used by way of similitude
to signify something Divine (as we said about humane Members) end for that and
are ascribed to God, of which kind in order.

Sadness.
[ Sadness and Grief] of mind is attributed to God, by which his displeasure,
and the withdrawings of his grace and favor are signified, Esa. 63.10. But
they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit: Therefore he was turned to be their
Enemy, and he fought against them, that is, they have perpetrated such
wickedness against their proper Consciences, that the Holy Spirit has forsaken
them, and justly withdrawn his grace. The like is said Ps. 78.40. How often did
they provoke him in the Wilderness, (...), etc. ne contristetis spiritum
sanctum, etc. Et dixit verbo suo, se confracturum potentiam eorum secundum
voluntatem suam.
and grieve him in the Desert? So Ephesians. 4.30. Greive not the Holy Spirit of God,
whereby ye are sealed unto the day of Redemption, that is, speak not so
corruptly and profanely as to provoke the Holy Spirit to withdraw his gracious
gifts and operations from you, and instead thereof to inflict wrath and
punishment upon you. So Genesis 6.6. And it repented the Lord that he had made man
on the Earth, and it grieved him at his Heart, that is, their malignity so
displeased him, that he manifested his Divine Decree to punish them. The
Chaldee renders it, And he said in his word, that he would break their power
according to his Will.

So Judges 10.16. And his Soul was or shortened, so it is in the Hebrew.
Repentance.
grieved for the misery of Israel, that is as the Chaldee renders it, he
greived or his Soul was affected with anguish, by which grief the Commiseration
and Compassion of God, for the Afflictions and Calamities of Israel is noted.
The like phrase of the indignation and averseness of God is used Zach. 11.8.
The word [ broken] when ascribed to God is also of the same ^^ence, as Ezekiel.
6.9. I am broken with their whorish heart which has departed from me, that is,
I am affected with grief, and as it were compelled to Decree their Punishment,
as verse the 10th.

[ Repentance] is ascribed to God, by which likewise his Divine displeasure
against-mens iniquities, and the infliction of punishment is noted. Genesis 6.6. 1 Samuel 15.35. Jer. 18.10.

Sometimes (if the speech be with reference to men, that by serious Repentance
are converted to God) it denotes Divine Commiseration, and a taking away of
punishment, Exodus 32.12, 14. 2 Samuel 24.16. Psalm. 106.45. Jer. 18.8. and 26.3.
Hos. 11.8. Joel. 2.13, 14. Upon which place Tarnovius thus expresses himself.
The Condition of men being changed, the immutable God is not changed, but the
thing it self? For he wills always, that it should go ill with the obstinate,
and that they should perish eternally, but that the Holy and Regenerate should
be truly happy in this and the other World. When God, to converted Souls,
remits that punishment; which he denounced to wicked and nesarious sinners, he
is said to Repent of the Evil by an Anthropopathy, because he seems to do that
which repenting men do, otherwise cannot properly repent because he is not a
man, 1 Samuel 15.29.

Augustine says, that the Repentance of God is not after any error, but the
change of Things and Constitutions in his Power is noted, lib. 17. de Civit. Dei
as when it is said, that he Repents, the change of things is signified, the
Divine praescience remaining immutable, and when he is said not to Repent, it
is to be understood, that things are unchanged.

In syntag. Theol. p. 194.
Polanus says, that the Repentance of God is not a perturbation or grief
arising from any sense of error in his Counsel or Divine decree, which is
immutable, 1 Samuel 15.29. But the change of his Works, the Divine Will remaining
unchanged, etc. Its causes are the sins or Repentance of men, etc.

[ Anger, Revenge, Hatred] when attributed to God, Anger, Revenge, Hatred.
are by some referred to this head. Where we are to note, that these words are
not ascribed to God by way of Anthropopathy, for God most truly, properly, and
for infinite Reasons, is justly angry with sinners, takes vengeance on them, or
afflicts them, Jer. 9.9. Nahum. 1.2. etc. He truly hates sinners and
hypocrites, Psalm. 5.6. Esa. 1.14. etc. (although these things are ascribed to
him without any perturbation, Licet absque ulla perturbatione, (...) aut
imperfectione haec sint Deo tribuenda.
confusion or imperfection) yet there is an Anthropopathy in certain words and
phrases by which these affections are wont to be expressed. Thus breath, or to
breath do sometimes note the Anger of God, by a Metaphor taken from men, who in
the vehement commotion of Anger, do draw their breath more strongly then
ordinary, Exodus 15.8. Job 4.9. Esa. 33.31. Ezekiel. 21.30. etc.

Where it is said, Deuteronomy. 28.63. In this text there is a figure called
Antanaclasis, which is when the same word is repeated in a various or contrary
signification; here is a Rejoicing to do good, and a Rejoicing to destroy. Zeal
or Jealousy
The Lord will Rejoice over you to destroy you, etc. It denotes his alacrity to
inflict punishment, answering to his rejoicing over them to do them good. When
a thing is said to be burdensome or wearisome to the Lord, Esa. 1.14. It notes
his aversation and hatred. He is said to receive consolation, when he avenged
himself of his Enemies, as Revenge is wont to be sweet to abused and Angry
persons, Esa. 1.24. and 57.6. Ezekiel. 5.13.

[ Zeal or Jealousie] is ascribed to God, to denote his most ardent Love to
Beleivers, and his care of their safety joined with an indignation against
their Enemies, Esa. 9.7. Zach. 1.14, 15. Joel 2.18. It also sometimes notes
Gods vehement Anger against stubborn, rebellious, sinners, who violating that
Faith, by which God espoused them to himself, commit spiritual Adultery, Exodus
20.5. Number. 25.11. Zach. 8.2. So in Hiphil, men are said to provoke God to
Jealousy by their Idolatry and sins. Deuteronomy. 32.16.21. 1 King. 14.22. Ezekiel. 8.3.
etc.

Humane Actions ascribed to God.
THese we shall distribute according to those more eminent Faculties.

(1.) That which is intelligent and rational. (2.) That which is Sentient or
Animal.
Actions which respect the Intellect and Reason, and from which (as from the
first principles) things flow, are either Internal or External, the internal
which by Anthropopathy are attributed to God, are

[ Knowledge] (which must not be generically understood) for that most
properly, and most perfectly belongs to the Omniscient God, Knowledge.
but such a knowledge as is Experimental, and arrived unto, by some special
acts or new acquisitions, as Genesis 18.21. I will go down now and see whether
they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me,
and if not, I will KNOW. (...), aliisque mediis certi de ea fiunt.
The Omniscient Jehovah speaks of himself after the manner of men, who when
they would know a thing, repair to the place where it was done that by Autopsy
or personal sight, and other mediums they may be assured that it is so.

Genesis 22.12. For now do I know that thou fear God, etc. God knew it before,
and had a most exact prospect into Abraham's Heart, but such an illustrious
example of Faith and Obedience, was never externally shown; which done Jehovahs
says by the Angel, now I know, etc. that is, by a manifest and external proof,
thy hearty Faith and Obedience is now apparent. See Genesis 11.25. Deuteronomy. 8.2. and
13.3. Psalm. 14.2. To this may be referred what Paul says, Phil. 4.6. In every
thing by Prayer and Supplication let your Requests be made known unto God.
(...).
By Prayers being made known to God, he intimates that they are grateful to
him, and assuredly heard. See Act. 10.4. Psalm. 1.6. and 31.8.2.19.

Ignorance.
[ Ignorance] (which is the opposite to knowledge) is attributed to God, by
which is denoted his displeasure, hatred, anger and aversation, Esa. 40.27. Why
say thou O Jacob, and speak O Israel, now my way is hid from the Lord?
etc. that is, we are hated and neglected by God, neither does he regard our
affairs. Hence Christ says to the Reprobates in the day of their Judgment,
Matthew. 7.23 I never knew you depart from me, ye that work iniquity. See Matthew
25.12. Luke 13.25, 27. etc.

To this head may be referred those questions which God asks as if he had been
ignorant, whereas in proper speaking there is nothing hid from him, neither has
he any need of being informed, as Genesis 3.9. And the Lord called unto Adam, and
said unto him, where art thou? This was no interrogation of ignorance, but a
summons to an unwilling appearance, reducing into Adams mind how much he was
changed from that blessed state of Immortality, after his fall.

De parad. c. 14.
Ambrose upon the place says, where is that (well known guilty) confidence of
thine? Thy fear argues a Crime, and thy skulking, prevarication. Therefore
where art thou? I do not ask in what place, but in what state? Whither has thy
sin hurried thee, that thou hidest thy self from God, whom before thou have
sought. This is more a chiding, then a question; from what good, from what
blessedness, from what grace, and into what misery, art thou fallen? Genesis 4.9.
And the Lord said unto Cain, where is Abel thy Brother? Augustine says, he asks
not as an ignorant, that would fain, lib. 12. contra Faustum Manich. cap. 10.
know, but as a Judge to punish the guilty -- See Gen 32.27. Number. 22.9. 1 King.
19.9, 13. 2 Kings 20.14, 15. Esa. 39.3, 4. So the questions of Christ, Matthew.
22.20, 45. Luke 8.45. etc.

To this may also be referred when God seems to deliberate as if he had not
known (or doubts) what to do.

Junius in his Commentary, on Ezekiel. 20.8. says thus. God that he may more amply
show the wonders of his Mercy seems in Scripture to use a consultation with
himself after the manner of men, and then, as if swayed by Mercy to his
Creature, though a sinner, after his disputes in his own mind, and a
(seemingly) doubtful conflict, inclines at last to a sentence of Mercy -- of
which there is an eminent instance in Hos. 11.8, 9. How shall I give thee up
Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee Israel. My Heart is turned within me, my
repentings are kindled together, I will not execute the fierceness of my Anger,
I will not return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God and not man, etc. So when
God is said to search the Heart and Reins, which must not be understood as if
they were before unknown to him, but a most exact and infinite knowledge is
denoted by this phrase. So Paul says of the Holy Spirit, that it searches all
things, yea the deep things of God, 1 Cor. 2.10. Search and inquiry goes before
knowledge in men, and without it they can scarce arrive at any certain
excellency in science, (...), certissima scientia. Remembrance.
therefore this phrase is only used to signify the infinite perfection of
knowledge in the Holy Spirit by an Anthropopathy.

[ Remembrance] is attributed to God, sometimes in good part, signifying that
he will give help and releif unto men after hard calamities in which he seemed
to forget them, as Genesis 8.1. And God Remembered Noah, and every beast or living
thing: Upon which Luther in his Comment, says, although it be true, that God
always remembers his, even when he seems to forsake them, yet Moses here
signifies, that he was mindful of them, even with respect to sense, that is so
far as to make a signal and manifest discovery thereof, which before by his
Word and Spirit he had promised. See Genesis 30.22. Exodus 2.24. 1 Samuel 1.11, 19.
and several other places.

Divine Remembrance toward men denotes the Benevolence, Affection, Grace and
good Will of Jehovah toward them, Psalm. 115.12. Psalm. 136.23. Nehem. 5.19, and
13.22, 31. Luke 23.42. Acts 10.4. After the same manner the remembrance of his
Covenant is attributed to God, by the sight of which he becomes a gracious
benefactor to men, Genesis 9.15, 16.6.5. And the Remembrance of his Mercy, Psalm*
25.6. Of his word, Psalm. 119.49.

Hierome in his Comment on Lament. 5.1. says, Remembrance is ascribed to him,
who could never forget any. It is not to refresh his Memory that the Divinity
is so prayed to, for all things past and to come are present with him -- It Is
unbecoming, to attribute Oblivion to so great a Majesty, but he is prayed to
Remember, that he would quickly afford help to the needy, and that his grace
may be made manifest which before was hidden.

[ To Remember,] when it is applied to God, with respect to bad men, signifies
the execution of punishment and vengeance upon them, Psalm. 25.7. and 79.8. and
137.7. Esa. 45.25. Rev. 18.5. He is said to Remember the blood of the innocent,
when he Revenges its violent effusion, or unjust slaughter, Psalm. 9.13.

[ Forgetfulness] or Oblivion is attributed to God, Forgetfulness.
which signifies that he disregards, and leaves men exposed to Evils, without
any comfort or help, as if he had quite forgotten them, 1 Samuel 1.11. Psalm.
9.18. and 13.1. and 42.9.10. Esa. 49.15. Jer. 23.39. Hos. 4.6. etc. Luke 12.6.
Are not five Sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one is forgotten before
God, that is, God has a care of every individual Creature, and sustains them.
Sometimes God is said to forget when he delays and defers the punishment of the
wicked, for their ill deeds, Psalm. 74.22, 23. Amos 8.7. Job 12.7. And know that
God has forgotten thee (so (...) signifies) for thine iniquity, that is, he
delays your punishment, and does not rigidly exact, according to their
greatness, agreeing in sense with our Translation, which runs thus -- And know
therefore that God exacteth of thee less then thine iniquity deserves.

[ Thoughtfulness or Thinking,] is ascribed to God, by which his Will, Sentence
or Decree, is understood, Genesis 50.20. You thought evil against me,
Thoughtfulness.
but the Lord thought it into good, (so the Original has it,) that is, he
turned it into good, or (as our Translation has it) meant it unto good. Here
is an Antanaclasis of one Verb properly applied to malignant men, but to God by
an Anthropopathy, alluding to the former. See Psalm. 40.5, 6. and 92.5, 6. and
139.16, 17. Esa. 55.8, 9. Jer. 4.28. and 29.11. and 51.12. etc.

Hitherto of the inward acts of man -- The external or outward acts (which are
obvious to the notice of sense, for orders sake) may be distinguished into the
actions. External Actions.


(1.) Of the Mouth. (2.) Of the Hands. (3.) Of the Feet.
[ Hissing] is attributed to God, by which, a Divine Call, or summons of God,
Hissing.
for men to gather together, and appear in a certain place, is noted, as Esa.
5.26. and 7.18. For it is customary with men oftentimes to call certain Beasts
to them that way. This Hissing of God is used in a good sense, Zach. 10.8. I
will hiss for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them, and they shall
increase as they have increased, which is understood of the gathering of the
Church by the voice of the Gospel.

[ Breathing] is ascribed to God, Genesis 2.7. Breathing.
And he Breathed into his Face the breath of Life -- that is, he endued the
Body he had formed with a living soul, in the Image of God -- Sometimes it
denotes Gods Anger, the Metaphor being taken from Angry men, who then puff and
blow strongly, as Evek. 21.31. I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I
will blow or breath against thee, etc. See Act. 9.1.

[ Laughing and Deriding] are attributed to God, Psalm. 2.4. Laughing and
Deriding.
He that sits in the Heavens shall Laugh, the Lord shall have them in
Derision. Psalm. 37* 12. The wicked plotteth against the Just, and gnasheth upon
him with his Teeth. Verse 13. The Lord shall laugh at him, for he sees that
his day is coming -- This is spoken by an Anthropopathy, the Metaphor being
taken from a wise and prudent man, who (when he sees some heady and
inconsiderate undertaker, rush on toward his fancied exploits, without
deliberation, or a solid foundation laid, and bragging of extraordinary
matters,) has him in contempt, and (as it were laughing in his sleeve) expects
an unhappy event, that is to say, when this Mountain shall bring forth a Mouse,
as it is vulgarly spoken. So men deride an Enemy that threatens, when he has no
strength or power to execute his menaces. But this phrase notes the most wise
Providence of God which slights the folly of his Enemies, whom he tolerates for
a time, and to whose malice he has appointed bounds, and at the appointed
season, confounds, tramples on, and destroys them. As it is said of wicked and
stubborn men, Prove. 1.26. I will also laugh at your calamity, I will mock when
your fear comes -- By which is to be understood, the neglect and rejection of
the Wicked in their Adversity. As if he had said -- Even as you neglect and
despise my wholesome admonitions, so will I despise and neglect your
applications, and reject you when your Calamities comes, etc.

Kissing.
[ Kissing] is ascribed to God, when the speech is of the Son of God incarnate,
as Cant. 1.2. Where the optative words of the Mystical spouse (viz. the Church)
are had, let him kiss me with the kisses of his Mouth -- upon which place the
Chaldee says, that it is allusive to Gods speaking face to face to the
Israelites, as a man does to his Friend, and kisses him for love -- But more
truly it is to be understood or expounded of the promulgation or publishing of
the Gospel by the Son of God made man, John 1, 17, 18. 1 Timothy 1.10. Heb. 1.1.
etc.

Solomon says, Prove. 24.26. That every man shall kiss his lips that gives a
right answer, which by (...).
way of eminency is applicable to him, of whom it is said, Esa: 40.4. The Lord
has given him the Tongue of the learned, that he should know how to speak a
word in season to him that is weary -- and ( Psalm. 45.2.) Into whose lips grace
is poured, Jehova kissed (that is showed intimate tokens of his love to) his
people in the Old Testament times, by many appearances, and by Moses, Prophets,
and Angels, employed to make discoveries of him, but this came short of this
Kiss, which the Church (under the term of Spouse) here desires. Let him Kiss me
with the Kisses of his Mouth, that is, let him comfort me with a manifestation
more eminent then the former, viz. of Christ's coming into the Flesh, and
completing the work of redemption.

Homil in Cant. Hierom. interpr. Tom. 4. fol. 80.
The paraphrase of Origin upon this Text is -- How long will my Spouse send me
Kisses by Moses, and the Prophets? Now I long to have them, personally of
himself -- let him assume my natural shape, and Kiss me in the Flesh according
to the Prophesies, Esa. 7.14. Behold a Virgin shall Conceive, and bear a Son,
and shall call his name Emmanuel, so that this is a Prayer for the Incarnation
of Christ, the Blessed Spouse, and Bridegroom of our Souls. Heb. 1.1. To this
Divine Kiss by a mutual relation of Faith answers, Cant. 8.1. O that thou were
as my Brother, that sucked the breast of my Mother; when I should find thee
without I would Kiss thee? By which the sincere Love of the Church, and the
unblemished obedience of Faith is understood.

Psalm. 2.12. Kiss the Son lest he be Angry, by which the Kings of the Earth,
and the potents in the World are instructed to yield homage and obedience to
the King of Glroy, Christ the Son of God, being exhibited in the World -- For
in former times subjection was signified by a Kiss, as Genesis 41.40. 1 Samuel 10.1.
1 King. 19.18. Hosea 13.2.

Crying.
[ A Military Clamor,] or the crying of a Travailing Woman is attributed to God,
Esa. 42.13, 14. By which is noted that his Lenity, Patience, and Long
Forbearance, are changed into a severe vengeance, Junius and Tremellius do
remark from Vegelius, that the Roman Soldiers were wont in the beginning of
Battle to fall on with a horrible Clamor to daunt the Enemy.

Also a Travailing Woman, though in great pain, yet patiently endures it to the
utmost extremities of her throws, and then being overcome by the violence of
her grief. Orphans breaks out into Cries and Vociferation, which most elegantly
expresses the Patience and Forbearance of God, Pulcherrime divinae (...), et
subsequentis vindictae gravissi: mae conditio exprimitur. Speaking
and the extremity of his Wrath when provokt. See Psalm. 78.65, 66. Romans 2.4, 5.

[ Speaking] and Speech, is attributed to God. Where we must note that those
places of Scripture wherein God is said to speak or utter certain Words, that
he might manifest his Divine pleasure to men that way, do not belong to this
place. God sometimes thus spoke immediately as to our first Parents, Genesis 2.16.
and 3.9. To Noah. Genesis 6.13. To Abraham, Genesis 12.1. chap. 16. and 17. and 18.
To Moses Exodus 3.4, 5. and the following verses, and to Patriarchs, Prophets,
etc. in the Old Testament.

2. Sometimes, God spoke mediately, by divinely inspired men, in whom a mind
enlightened by the Spirit of God was formed into words, quorum (...) ubivis
prostat.
an account of such is found every where in Scripture, as also of Angels who
are his Ministering spirits, now God does not speak thus by way of Anthropopathy
or Metaphor, but truly and properly, although in a far different and excellent
manner then men do, or can think.

But that speaking, of God, which belongs to this figure is.

(1.) When the effectual or efficacious decree of the Divine Will about the
Creature, Cum efficiax divin^^ voluntatis de Creaturis decretum, ejusve
Executio per modum loquel^^ humane exprimitur, etc. In more Nebochin. part 1.
sap. 6.5.
and the executions thereof is revealed or expressed after the manner of humane
speech, as Genesis 1.3. And God said let there be light, and there was light,
(suitable to 2 Cor. 4.6. where it is written and God who said, or Commanded the
light to shine out of Darkness) verse 6. And God said, let there be a firmament
in the midst of the Waters, and verse 9. And God said let the Waters under the
Heaven be gathered together, etc and verse 11. And God said let the Earth bring
forth Grass, etc. verse 14. And God said let there be lights in the firmament
of the Heavens, and verse 20. And God said let the Waters bring forth
abundantly the moving Creature, and verse 24. And God said let the Earth bring
forth the living Creature, etc. Rab. Mos. Maimon. says, that this phrase in the
Creation, ( and God said) is to be under stood of the Will and not of Speech;
because speech by which a thing is Commanded, must of necessity be directed to
some being or object capable to execute his Commands but no objects of such a
capacity had then being; therefore of necessity it must be understood only of
Gods Will.

Masculus in his Comment, says, that Moses speaks of God after the manner of
men, not that God spoke so. For by his word the virtue and efficacy of his Will
is expressed, etc. for what we would have done; that it might be understood,
believed, or done, we express our selves by the prolation of a word, and when
Gods Will is expressed, it is called a word -- God is a Spirit, and uses no
corporeal or Organical Speech, no transient voice, nor Hebrew, Greek, or other
Idiom, unless in some temporary dispensation he was pleased to utter himself
Organically, which has no place here, etc. So the appellation of Names given to
the Creatures, verses (...)* 10. which is ascribed to God, notes only his
decree and divine Constitution (...) men should so call them.

So the blessing of God to Fishes, Fowl, benedictio divina quae ad pisces, et
a^^es prolata esse a Deo dicitnr, v. 22. realis est multiplicationis specierum
illarum constitutio.
etc. ver. 22. denotes his real appointment of the multiplication of their
respective kinds, upon which Musculus very well says, if you consider that God
speaks to a quatiles or watery Creatures, you will judge it a wounderful kind of
speech. But he speaks not to their Ears, but to their Natures, to which by the
virtue of his word he has given a power and efficacy to propagate their own
kinds.

From this description of the Creation, the Divine force and efficacy of Gods
Will in the Creation and Conservation of the Creatures (which is so
conspicuous) is called the Word of God, Psalm. 33.5, 6. Psalm. 107.20. Psalm.
147.15, 18. Heb. 1.3. and 11.3. 2 Pet. 3.5, 7. etc. So in other decrees of the
Divine Will, God is said to speak. Genesis 8.21. And the Lord said in his heart, I
will not again Curse the ground, that is, he so constituted and decreed it,
that by Noah it should be so manifested unto the World.

Psalm. 2.5. Then shall he speak to them in his Wrath, that is, he will crush
his Enemies with horrible Judgments and Punishments.

Sometimes the Decrees and Appointments of the Trinity by way of Dialogue or
Colloquy, among the Divine persons, as Genesis 1.26. And God said let us make man
in our likeness or Image, etc. and chap. 2.18. And the Lord said, it is not
good that the man should be alone, I will make him an help meet for him, and
Genesis 3.22. And the Lord God said, behold the man is become as one of us, etc.
Genesis 11.6. And the Lord said behold the People is one, and have one language --
go to, let us go down, and there confound their Language, By this deliberate
way of expression, the Decrees of the Holy Trinity, and their effectual power
of operation are noted, Psalm. 2.7. I will declare the Decree, the Lord said
unto me, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee -- ask of me and I will
give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, Psalm. 110.1. The Lord said unto my
Lord, sit thou at my right hand, etc. These phrases signify the most Holy and
most efficacious discerning and efficiency of Gods Will.

To this speaking of the Father answers the hearing attributed to Christ, John
8.26, 40. and 15, 15. And to the Holy Spirit, John 16.13.

For this cause (among others) the Son of God is called the Word, (...) for by
him a manifestation of the internal speech of the Holy Trinity (that is their
Divine Decrees) for man's Salvation is made unto us, John 1.1, 13, 14, etc.

Rebuking.
So much of speech in general. More particularly Rebuking or Chiding is
attributed to God, by which its real effect, or destruction is noted, of which
you may see examples, Psalm. 18.15, 2 Samuel 22.16. Where Tempests, Earthquakes,
etc. are said to be at Gods Rebukes, and Psalm. 104.7. that at his rebuke the
waters fled -- that is, were separated from the Earth, Genesis 1.9.

To Rebuke, in proper speaking, two things are requisite.

(1.) That that which is reprehensible, may be chekt.

(2.) That it may be corrected or amended, these may be aptly applied to Gods
Creating Word, for when he said, Let the waters under the Heaven be gathered
together into one place, and let the dry Land appear -- In the first the
indigested confusion of things is reprehended, and in the second they are
corrected, and rightly disposed off into their proper places. Musculus on this
place annexes this marginal note -- that it is an invincible Argument of
Christ's Divinity, that at his rebuke the Winds and Seas were obedient, Mark
4.39. Luke 8.24. See Psalm. 9.5. and 76.6. and 68.30. Esa. 17.13. Zach. 3.2.

Rebuke signifies destruction, Deuteronomy. 28.20. [ Calling] when ascribed to God
signifies its real product or effect as 2 Kings 8.1. Calling.
The Lord has called for a Famine, and it shall also come upon the Land for
seven years, Psalm. 105.16.

Commanding.
Romans 4.17. Gods [ Commanding] inanimate or irrational Creatures, denotes a
direction for some certain work to be done or omitted, as Esa. 5..6. I will
also Command the Clouds, that they Rain no more upon it. See Esa. 45.12.

Answering.
[ Answering] is attributed to God, when he is said to Answer men's Prayers, 2 Samuel 7.9. Psalm. 3.4, 5. Esa. 58.8. etc. Illyricus says, that in hearing God
answers in a threefold manner.

(1.) By the very hearing, for every man that prays earnestly requests that.
(2.) By some Testimony of his Spirit, that we are heard. (3.) By granting the
petition, which is the most real and apparent answer.
Silence.
Contrary to this, is Gods [ Silence,] when his people pray, by which his delay
in comforting and helping them is noted, as Psalm. 28.1. Unto thee O Lord do I
Cry -- be not deaf toward me, etc. So Psalm. 83.1. And God is said to answer
when he takes pleasures in man, Eccl. 5.20. and 9.7.

Witnessing.
The Lord is said to be a [ Witness,] when he declares the Truth of a thing in
fact, or justly punishes Liars, 1 Samuel 12.5. Jer. 42.5. Malach. 3.5. etc. The
Lord has been a VVitness between thee and the wife of thy Youth, Mal. 2.14.
that is, to join them in an individual Society of Life.

A judicial Inquisition, which inflicts revenge and punishment upon the guilty
is noted in these texts, Genesis 9.5. Josh. 22.23. Psalm. 9.12. Psalm. 10.14, 15.
The Metaphor is taken from the Custom of Judges, who by the Examination and
weighing of Testimonies first inquire into the case, and then proceed to
sentence.

Numbering.
By [ Numbring] the most exact care and providence of God is noted, as men keep
accounts of affairs that concern them much, Psalm. 56.8. Thou tellest my
wanderings, put thou my tears into thy bottle, are they not in thy book? Matthew.
10.30. But the very hairs of your head are numbered. Also his most exact
knowledge of things that are innumerable to us, Psalm. 147.4. He tells the
Number of the Stars, he calls the^^ all by their Names. Esa. 40.26. -- He
brings out their host by Number, he calls them all by their Names, by the
greatness of his Might, etc.

By the term [ Selling] a delivery into the power of the Enemy, by an offended
God is noted, Buying and Selling.
as things that are sold by men, are transfeerred into the right, power, and
property of another, as Deuteronomy. 32.30. How should one chase a thousand, and two
put ten thousand to flight except their Rock had sold them, Jud. 2.14. And the
Anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands
of spoilers, that spoiled them, and he Sold them into the hands of their
Enemies round about, etc. and chap. 4.9. The Lord shall Sell Sisera into the
hand of a Woman, etc. See Psalm. 44.12. Esa. 50.1. Ezekiel. 30.12. etc.

By the term [ Buying] is signified Redemption by and through Christ, as 1 Cor.
6.20. For ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God, etc. and 1 Cor.
7.23. Ye are bought with a price be ye not the Servants of men -- So Gal. 3.13.
and 4, 5. 2 Pet. 2.1. Rev. 14.3, 4. The price which purchases this Mystical
Buying is the Blood, Death, Passion, and Merit of our Blessed Savior.

The second kind of Actions, which are proper to the hands, The second sort of
Actions.
are either general or special. In general there is ascribed to God by an
Anthropopathy.

[ Labour] in the work of the Creation -- So Job calls himself the Labor of
his hands, Job 10.3. that is, fashioned and formed him in his Mothers Womb,
Labor.
of which he emphatically speaks in verse 8. Thine hands have made me, and
fashioned me together round about. (...)
The Hebrew word properly signifies the forming of a thing with great Labor,
Art, and Diligence: In other places it denotes anxiety, Grief and Trouble;
setting forth the exceeding great Wisdom of God in the Creation, or forming of
man, which is expounded in the 10th. and 11th. verses, with more special and
emphatical words, have thou not pou^^ed me out as Milk, and curdled me like
Cheese -- Thou have clothed me with Skin and Flesh, and have fenced me with
Bones and Sinews, etc. Psalm. 139.13, 14, 15. This Divine work is spoken of,
Thou have covered me in my Mothers Womb -- I will praise thee for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made; mavelous are thy works, and that my Soul
knows right well -- My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in
secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth, etc. (...).
The Hebrew Translated ( curiously wrought) is very emphatical, for it properly
signifies to paint with a Needle, or the texture or weaving, various Figures
and Pictures, in Arras or Tapestry Hangings, or Garments interwoven or wrought
with many curious colors. Ob mirabilem, ex tam varis membris, venis arteriis,
ossibus, carne, c^^te quasi contexturam.
The formation of man is therefore compared to such a work, because of its
mavelous Order, Symmetry, and Contexture of various Members, Veins, Arteries,
Bones, Flesh, Skin, etc.

In the work of Redemption, the Passion and Death of Christ is called Labor,
as Esa. 43.24. Thou have made Labor in thine iniquities (so the Hebrew) He
shall see the Labor (or travel) of his soul. Esa. 53.11. This comes to pass in
a twofold respect, which attend Labor, As

(1.) Anxiety and Toil, Then

(2.) The Vtility and Profit that follows, for the word comprehends both,
according to that saying, Genesis 3.19. In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat
Bread, where the Toil and Profit are joined. The Toil and Anxiety of Christ in
the work of our Redemption is largely described by the Evangelists; and how
great the profit and benefit of it (with respect to the unspeakable blessing it
brought to poor mankind,) is evident to every soul that has tasted of his grace.

To [ Labour] is opposed [ Rest] and Recreation, Rest.
which by this figure is attributed to God, Genesis 2.2. And God rested on the
seventh day from all his works, which he had made -- and verse 3. And God
blessed the seventh day and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested,
etc. This Rest in God, presupposes no wearyness (as it does in men) but the
completing end, and perfection, of his admirable work, of this great and
incomprehensible Fabric, and so only a cessation from his Creating work is to
be understood. For among men, the more Arduous, Laborious, and Profitable the
work is, the more pleasing and delectable the Artificers rest is, when he
compleats it.

Some say that the word (...) Rest is properly attributed to God, which
strictly signify Rest, as (...) does, but a bare and simple cessation, as
Josh. 5.12. Job 32.9. Rev. 4.8. etc. And commonly it is said, that he that
ceases from his work, does Rest, although not weary, but in full strength and
vigor.

Be it so, but for (...) the word (...) is put for the very Rest here spoken
of, Exodus, 20.11. For in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, and all that
in them is, and Rested the seventh day, etc. And if the word signifies a mere
cessation without any previous wearyness, 1 Samuel 25.9 It is to heedfully noted
that it is said, Exodus 31.17. For in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth,
and on the seventh day he (...)
Rested, was refreshed (or took breath;) which word is also used, Exodus 23.12.
Of the weary Servant after his Labor, viz. On the seventh day shall thou Rest,
and 2 Samuel 16.14. It is expressly opposed to weariness. Sion and the Church is
called the place of his Rest, Psalm. 132.14. and Esa. 11.10. Which denotes his
gracious Presence, Operation, and Complacency.

Of the special Actions of men, a great many are attributed to God, by which
his various works of Grace, Righteousness and Wrath are to be understood. As

To wash.
1. He is said to wash away filth and sin, when he graciously remits it, Psalm.
51.2. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin, Esa.
4.4. When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughter of Sion,
etc.

To Hide.
2. He is said to hide the Godly and Believers when he protects and defends
them, Psalm. 31, 20. Thou shall hide them in the secret of thy presence, Psalm.
64.2. Hide me from the secret Counsel of the Wicked, from the insurrection of
the workers of iniquity, Psalm. 91.1.

To wipe.
3. He is said to [ Wipe] when he destroys, 2 Kings 21.13. a Metaphor taken from
Dishes, which are Wiped or made clean by rubbing with the hands. He is said to
Wipe away Tears from off their Faces, when he Comforts and Rejoices his People.
Esa. 25.8. Rev. 7.17.

4. He is said [ To Gird with Strength] when he Comforts and Supports, as Psalm.
18.32. and 30.11, 12. To Gird.


To build.
5. He is said [ to Build] when he produces a being by way of Creation, Genesis
2.22. And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, Builded he a Woman.
See Exodus 1.21. 2 Samuel 7.11.

6. He is said [ to Bind up Wounds] when he spiritually heals men, and secures
them from mischief, To bind up wounds.
Job 5.18. Psalm. 147.2, 3. Esa. 61.1. Hosea. 6.1. Come let us return unto the
Lord for he has torn and he will heal us, he has smitten, and he will Bind us
up.

To Open
7. He is said [ to Open the gates of Heaven,] when he bestows Divine and
Miraculous blessings, Psalm. 78.22, 23, 24. Though he had Commanded the Clouds
from above, and Opened the doors of Heaven, and had rained down Ma^^a upon them
to eat, and had given them of the Corn of Heaven, etc. And also when he sends
down Rain, Deuteronomy. 28.12. He is said to Open the door of speech, when he affords
a fit occasion, and saving means to his Ministers of Preaching the Gospel, 1
Cor. 16.9. 2 Cor. 2.12. Col. 4.3. To Open the door of Faith, when he calls and
admits men to the Faith and Communion of the Church, Acts 14.27. To Open the
Heart and Mind, when he gives the saving understanding of his word, Luke 24.45.
Acts 16.14. Psalm. 119.129, 130.

To Hold.
8. He is said [ to Hold the right hand of Cyrus] when he gave him a prosperous
success in his warlike expedition against Babylon, Esa. 45.1.

To conclude men in unbeleif.
9. He is said [ to Conclude men in Sin and unbelief,] when as a most just Judge
he declares them obnoxious to sin, and therefore liable to Eternal Damnation,
Romans 11.32. Gal. 3.22.

To Try.
10. He is said [ to Try and Prove, as Silver is Tryed] (after the manner of
Goldsmiths, or others concerned in Metals,) when he Purifies and Tryes the
Godly with Crosses and Afflictions, Psalm. 17.3. and 66.10. Zach. 13.9. So when
he Purifies and Reforms Doctrines, To break
Mal. 3.2, 3. Or Destroys such as are obstinately wicked, Ezekiel. 22.18. etc.

11. He is said [ to break with a rod of Iron,] when he Chastises and Destroys,
Psalm. 2.9. and 3.7. Esa. 38.13. and Lament. 3.4. etc.

13. He is said [ to Sift in a sieve,] when he tryes his People by Calamities
and yet preserves them, To Sift.
Am. 9.9. and when he scatters or disperses his Enemies like chaff, Esa. 30.28.
To Sift the Nations with the sieve of Vanity -- that is, they shall be cast on
the Earth, as through a sieve, that so dispersed they should no longer appear
-- He compares the multitude of the Gentiles, by whom Jerusalem was to be
distressed to dust or chaff which is easily blown away, so that little will
remain of a great heap.

14. He is said [ to make Bald the Head, To make Bald.
] when he despoiles men of their Ornaments, Esa. 3.17, 24. for the chief
adorning of Women was in their Hair, as 1 Pet. 3.3.

15. He is said [ to Blot out of the Book of Life,] when men are not accounted
in the number of the saved, Exodus 32.32, 33. Psalm. 69.28.29. To Blot out of the
Book of Life.
He is said to Blot out sins, when he remits or forgives them. Psalm. 37.2, 3.
For the Scripture speaks as if there were an account kept of them in a certain
Written Book, which because the Messiah has made satisfaction, are Blotted or
crossed out. See Col. 2.13, 14.

16. He is said [ to Devour or Swallow,] when he totally destroys, To Devour or
Swallow.
as Exodus 15.7. Esa. 25.8. 1 Cor. 15.54. He is to said to make Room or enlarge,
when he vouchsafes Deliverance from difficulties and troubles, Genesis 26.22.
Psalm. 4.1, 2. Psalm. 119.31, 32.

He is said [ to Direct or make plain the way, To Direct.
] when he gives a happy issue and conclusion to the endeavors of men, as Psalm.
5.8, 9. Esaias 45.2, 13.

[ To Lose or Vngird the Loyns] when he makes men feeble and unarmed, To Ungird.
and so incapable of defense or offense, Esa. 45.1.

[ To Pour out his Anger,] when he Punishes, To Pour out his Anger,
Psalm. 79.5, 6. Ezekiel. 9.8. and 20.13, 21, 33.

[ To Pour out his Spirit,] when he largely distributes his gifts, Spirit.
Joel 3.1, 2. Zach. 12.10. Act. 2.17, 18, 33. Romans 5.5. Tit. 3.5, 6.

[ To make Void Counsel,] when he disappoints and blasts the purposes of men,
To make Void.
Jer. 19.7.

[ To Pour out a Blessing,] when he plentifully distributes his benefits, To
Pour out a Blessing.
Mal. 3.10.

He is said [ to Hew by the Prophets,] when he terrifies men by fearful
Admonitions, and legal Threatenings, To Hew.
as Hosea 6.5. and when he spiritually kills them as in the following verses.

He is said [ to Stretch out the line of Confusion,] and the Stones of
emptiness, To Stretch out.
when he leaves Kingdoms and Nations to the Desolations of the Enemy, Esa.
34.11. This Metaphor is taken from Architects, who use lines, perpendiculars
and little Ropes, etc.

He is said [ to Bear or carry] when he Preserves, Sustains, To Bear.
Supports and Governs his People, as Deuteronomy. 1.31. Exodus 19.4. Esa. 46.3, 4. Heb.
1.3.

He is said [ to Break the Head,] when his Wrath falls heavy and destroys men,
To break the Head.
Psalm. 110.5, 6. Hab. 3.13.

He is said to Sling out the Souls of David's Enemies, as out of a Sling, 1 Samuel
25.29. that is, he will violently take it away (as a stone out of a Sling flies
with greater force a greater way, without further regard of him that throws
it.) The Metaphors is taken from the weapons of David, which was a Sling, etc.
On the contrary the Soul of David is said to be Bound up in the bundle of Life,
denoting Gods Fatherly care of him in securing him from Death, which his
Enemies designed, and preserving him so safe, that nothing could be forced away
from him.

He is said [ to make Way to his Anger, To make Way.
] when with just Judgments he recompenses the unjust stubborness and contumacy
of the Wicked, Psalm. 79.50. He made Way for his Anger, he spared not their
Souls from Death, but gave their Life over to the Pestilence.

He is said to Weigh the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Balance, Esa.
40.12. Which notes with what facility and ease the Lord can sustain, and manage
the whole Universe, even as men do a small pair of Scales. The Lord is said to
Weigh Spirits, Prove. 16.2. by which his most exact knowledge of our Minds and
inward frames, is noted, this metaphor is taken from men, who do with a great
deal of exactness Weigh things that they may know their value. See Prove. 5.21.
and 21.2. and 24.12.

God is said [ to put his Hook in the Nose,] and his Bridle in the Lips of his
Enemies, when he stops their fury, To Put his Hook in the Nose.
thwarts their purposes, and keeps them under, 2 Kings 19.28. Esa. 37.29.

He is said to put the Tears of the Godly in a bottle, when he suffers them not
to be shed in vain, but preserving their Memory turns them to Everlasting Joy,
Psalm. 56.8.

Qua imputatio illi facta, et plena sa^^sfactio intelligitur 1 Pet 2.24.
Christ is peculiarly said to Bear our sins, Esa. 53.4, 12. by which their
imputation to him, and a full satisfaction is understood, 1 Pet. 2.24. Who his
own self Bare our sins in his own Body on the Tree, that we being dead to sin,
should live unto Righteousness, by whose stripes ye were healed.

God is said to cast our sins behind his back, when he forgives them, and
remits the Punishment, Esa. 38.17. To which there is a contrary phrase, Psalm.
90.8. Thou have set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of
thy Countenance.

He is said [ to Shave with a Razor] the Head, and the hair of the Feet, and
the Beard, when he makes a spoil and devastation of the Land, and scatters
small and great from thence Esa. 7.20. Flaccus Illyricus.
Judicat se opera Regis Assyriae Isralitas puniturum, ita ut homines, et
animalia, ac aedificia and plantae vastentur. Ideo autem addit, conductitia, ut
sciant illam novaculam suam mercedem flagitaturam, etc.
God here intimates that by the King of Assyria he would punish the Israelites,
so as that Men, Beasts, Buildings, Plants, etc. should be destroyed, He says
with a Razor that is hired, that they may know it would exact its own reward,
that is, that the Assyrians, through greediness of Prey and Spoil would make
havoc of, and sweep away all things, The Lord is said to break forth upon his
Enemies, when he disperses, crushes, and slays them, 2 Samuel 5.20. and 6.8.

He is said to Shoot with an Arrow, when he heaps swift and speedy vengeance
upon the wicked, Psalm. 64.7. But God shall Shoot at them with an Arrow,
suddenly shall they be wounded.

God is said to Write, which denotes his Knowledge and Providence, with respect
to Grace and Benignity, as when he is said to Write the Godly in the Book of
Life, or his Book. Esa. 4.3. Dan. 12.1. or when he Writes his Law in their
Hearts, Jer. 31.33. Heb. 8.10. By which a Renovation by the Holy Spirit is
noted, that Beleivers should know, and willingly obey the Will of God, 2 Cor.
3.3. Hence he is said to Grave them upon the palm of his Hands, Esa. 49.16.
Which shows his most faithful care and eminent Grace toward them. See Rev.
3.12.

Sometimes his VVriting signifies his Wrath and Punishment of sinners, as when
Job says, thou VVritest bitter things, against me, Job 13.26. that is, thou
do afflict me with bitter and heavy strokes, a metaphor taken from Courts of
Judicature, where legal sentences are Recorded. Esa. 65.6. Behold it is
Written before me, I will not keep silence but I will recompense, even
recompense into their bosom, by which Divine knowledge is noted, a metaphor
taken from men, who Write down in a Book or Paper what they would remember.

It is said, Jer. 17.13. They that depart from thee shall be written in the
Earth, because they have forsaken the Lord the Fountain of living waters, that
is, such Apostates shall be excluded from Heaven, and destinated to Eternal
Destruction.

God is said to Search Jerusalem with Candles, that is, all their secret sins
shall be brought to light, and punished, Zeph. 1.12.

He is said to Engrave the graving of one stone, etc. Zach. 3.9. Which betokens
the Wounds, Languor and Passion of Christ, who is figured by that Stone.

He is said to put an Hedge round about one, when he preserves him from the
malignity of malicious Spirits, Job 1.10. And to remove the Hedge, signifies,
that he will leave them naked, exposed, and defenseless, Esa. 5.5. Psalm. 8.12,
13. and 89.40, 41. When he is said to Enclose man's way with hewn Stones, it
denotes a being environed with Afflictions and Calamities, as Lam. 3.9. To
Hedge up the way with Thorns, as Hosea 2.6. signifies that God will by
Afflictions and other means hinder and divert men from an intended sin and
iniquity.

God is said to [Seal] up the hand of every man, Job 37.7. To Seal.
When he prohibits or hinders their actions -- It is said that God the Father
Sealed Christ, John 6.27. that is, sent him forth, with Divine Authority for
the good of men. See Cant. 4.12. and 8.6. Hag. 2.24, Where by Seal is betokened
that he confirms and preserves Believers in Truth and Piety, 2 Cor. 1.22. Ephesians,
1.13. and 4.30. As men fix their Seal to that which they would Ratify and
Confirm.

The Father is said to Draw men to Christ, John 6.44, 45, 65. When he
illuminates the mind with his word, and bestows the true knowledge of Salvation
-- So Cant. 1.4. Jer. 31.2. Hosea. 11.4. John 12.32. 2 Thessalonians. 3.5. This is no
violent Compulsion, but a benevolent flexion, bending, or disposition of a mind
averse to goodness, and that by means, as the word Revealed, and Preached, etc.

It is said Jer. 15.7. I will Fan them with a Fan, etc. that is, in my Anger I
will disperse and destroy them. The word is properly taken, Esa. 30.24. It is
said of Christ, Matthew. 3.12. Luke 3.17. That his Fan is in his hand, and he
will thoroughly purge his Floor, and gather his Wheat into his Garner, but he
will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire, that is, by the word of his
Power and by Afflictions and Tribulations, he will segregate or separate the
Godly from the Wicked, as by a Fan or winnowing, the pure grain is divided from
the Chaff.

God is said to Sweep with the Besom of Destruction, Esa. 14.23. which
intimates an utter Desolation. and spoil of Inhabitants to the Land.

It is said Psalm. 76.12. He shall cut off the Spirit of Princes, the word
Translated cut off is emphatical, and signifies the lopping off the branches of
a Vine, leaving it naked and desolate, and so it notes a deprivation of
Strength, Courage or Life it self.

God is said to Anoint, when he Comforts, lifts up, or makes glad his People,
Psalm. 23.4, 5. 2 Cor. 1.21. But most large, extensive, and copious in the
Unction of Christ our Blessed Savior, wherewith he is by the Father anointed
for the Salvation of poor sinners, Psalm. 45.7, 8. Esa. 61.1. Luke 4, 18. Heb.
1.9. John 3.34. Act. 10.38. etc.

A third kind of Actions, Actions of the Feet.
which properly belong to the [ Feet] are ascribed to God, as Genesis 3.15. A
breaking the Serpents Head -- where by the Serpent, is meant the Devil, who
seduced Eve in that form; and by the Serpents head, his Power, and diabolical
fierceness. So the breaking of his Head, is to be performed by the Messiah
(...),
God-man, and signifies the destruction of the power and Kingdom of the Devil,
and man's Redemption, from its Tyranny and Vassallage. Our Savior is figured
here as a magnificent Hero, who with his Feet tramples upon, the Serpent or
Dragon, and breaks his Head. But it is said that the Serpent shall bruise his
heel, by which phrase the Passion and Death of Christ is meant. To this passage
the Apostle Paul alludes, Romans 16.20. And the God of peace shall bruise Satan
under your Feet shortly, etc.

Such a treading under Foot as is used in a Wine Press is ascribed to God, Lam.
1.5. By which the extreme Oppression and Affliction of men is noted. To this
may be refered that emphatical phrase, Esa. 63.3. I have trodden the wine press
alone, etc. which is spoken of Christ, who by his Merit and satisfaction freed
us from our Enemies whom he crushed under his Feet.

Hitherto of Actions which concern the rational Soul, The Actions of the Animal
Faculty.
and such as concern the animal faculty follow, which are threefold, as it
respects the present purpose.

1. The Actions of the External senses, which are five.

2. The Actions of the Locomotive faculty, or which respect motion, and local
situation.

3. Actions procreating or generating, which Physicians calls vegative, but we
reduce it to the Animal, for vegetatives are comprehended under it.

[ Seeing] or Sight is attributed to God, Seeing.
by which (as was said before when we treated of Eyes) his most exact knowledge
is intimated, Exodus 32.9. I have seen this People and behold it is a
stiff-necked People, that is, I very well know how wicked they are, Homo videt
quae sunt prae oculis, Dominus autem videt ad Cor.
1 Samuel 16.7. A man looks on what is before his Eye, but the Lord sees to the
Heart, that is, he has an exact prospect into the very thoughts of the Heart,
and the whole inward frame of the mind, and accordingly Judges. Psalm. 11.4. The
Lords Eyes behold, his Eyelids try the Children of men's, it is a singular
passage which we find, John 5.19. Where Christ says of himself, Verily, verily,
I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father
do; for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise. Here the
Sight of Christ is equal with the Omniscient Fathers, and consequently his
Omnipotence is equal, and his (...)* energy, or power in operation. Upon this
and the following verse Erasmus, thus paraphrases, Illud etiam atque etiam
affirmo vobis, filius qui totus apatre pendet, non potest quicquam ex se
facere, cum ex se non sit etc. Eras. Paraphr. in loc.
I affirm it again, and again, that the Son, who wholly depends on the Father,
can of himself do nothing, forasmuch as he is not of himself, but what he sees
the Father do the same does he; their Will and Power is the very same, with the
Father there is Authority, and whatsoever the Son is or can do is derived from
him. Whatsoever therefore the Father has done, the same in the like manner is
wrought by the Son, because of the equality of the Communicated power. Amongst
men the Sons oftentimes degenerate from the Fathers, neither have they always
the same Will and Faculty, but the matter is otherwise here, the Father loves
the Son alone, and begot him most like himself, and transferred an equal power
of operation into him, showing him all things that are to be done by himself;
he is sent forth as the great exemplar by him, in all other matters the
operation of each is common, etc.

2. By the Sight of God, his Providence over his Creatures is to be understood,
sometimes denoting his approbation, favor, Grace and good Will, as Genesis 1.4.
And God saw that the Light was good, etc. So verses 10, 12, 18, 21, 25. After
which is annexed a general sentence, verse 31. And God saw every thing that he
had made, and behold it was very good. Which signifies his Divine approbation
of his created works, and his sanction of the duration of Natures order to the
end of the World. See Psalm. 104.30, 31. etc. Hence comes that form of Speech,
when God is said to See, denoting his Providence of certain persons or things,
under his immediate Care and Government, as Genesis 16.13. Thou God See me, that
is, thou providest for me. And Genesis 22.8. God will See (that is, provide)
himself a Lamb for a Burnt-offering. It is not to be understood that Abraham
knew before hand, that he should find a Ram to offer for a Sacrifice to God
instead of Isaac, but that he would quiet his Son by that kind of answer, he
being solicitous and inquisitive for the Lamb that should be offered for a
Burnt-offering, therefore he intimates that Isaac should leave it to the Care
of Divine Providence; and as Abraham spoke, the event happened, for he lifted
up his Eyes, verse 13. and beheld the Sacrifice to be offered, and so he gave
the place a Name. viz. Jehovah-jireh, that is, God shall see, verse 14. etc. So
1 Samuel 16.1. I have Seen me a King among his Sons, that is, as our Translation
has it, I have provided and chosen me a King.

More specially the (...) respicere or Seeing, or respect of God as it concerns
men, denotes his Approbation, Mercy, Care and Help. Of which Illyricus in
Clave. Est in his duplicata figura, nempe tum Anthropopathia, quod Deo
aspectustribuitur, tum etiam Metalepsis aut Metonymia, quod externus oculorum
motus consequens est etc.
There is in this a twofold figure, viz. An Anthropopathy, in as much as Sight
is ascribed to God, then a Metalepsis or Metonymie, because the external motion
of the Eyes, the Effect being put for the Cause, signifies the inward affection
of the Mind: For it takes in the external help which is the consequent of the
internal affection, and the external motion of the Eyes, so that here is a
third Trope -- Genesis 4.4. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his
Offering, and verse 5. but unto Cain, and his Offering he had not respect, that
is, he accepted and approved of the one but not of the other. See Number. 16.15. 1 Samuel 1.11. Psalm. 9.13, 14. and 10.13, 14. Psalm. 84.9, 10. Psalm. 102.17, 18. and
74.19.20. Psalm. 113.6. Esa. 66.2. Lam. 4.16. and 5.1. Jon. 3.10. Luke 1.25, 48.
etc. Deuteronomy. 26, 15. Psalm. 80.14, 15. Psalm. 102.20. Lam. 3.50. etc.

Hitherto the phrase of Gods Seeing or Respecting, denotes his Favor and Love,
which is sometimes directed to the object, as when he is said to have respect
to the Man or his Offering, sometimes to an internal Cause, as when he is said
to have respect to his Covenant, that is, the declaration of his Mercy and
Grace that way expressed to man, Psalm. 74.19, 20. Likewise when he is said to
look upon the Face of his Anointed (that is, Christ) who is our Mediator and
Savior, for whose sake David) Prays for a blessing, calling him the Servant of
the Lord, 2 Chronicles. 17.19. And the Word of the Lord, 2 Samuel 7.21. See 1 Chronicles.
17.17.

2. It denotes Evil, as Wrath, Vengeance, and Punishment, as Exodus 14.24. And
it came to pass that in the morning Watch, the Lord looked unto the Host of the
Egyptians, through the pillar of Fire, and of the Cloud, and troubled them,
etc. 1 Chronicles. 12.17. Psalm. 104.31, 32. Jer. 3.8. Lam. 3.36. Ezekiel. 16.50. etc.

[ Hearing] is attributed to God, Hearing.
in which likewise his Grace and Benevolence in satisfying the desires of his
People, and in a ready hearing their Prayers and Sighs is denoted, as Genesis
16.11. -- The Lord has heard thy Affliction, Exodus 2.24. And God heard their
groaning, 2 King. 20.5. I have heard thy Prayer, etc. So Psalm. 4.3, 4. and 5.1,
2, 3, 4. and 130.1, 2. Esa. 65.24. 1 John 5.14. etc. Thus God is said to Hear
the Heavens, Hos. 2.21. When he gives the blessings (as Paul mentions Act.
14.17.) of Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seasons are granted, which Heaven as
it were silently desires and begs God for.

The Scripture uses the term of Gods attention, Harkening as it were to the
Prayers and Desires of the Godly, by way of illustration of the greatness of
his Compassion, Psalm. 10.16, 17. and 66.18, 19. and 130.1, 2. etc. On the
contrary ^^od is said to shut Prayers, Lam. 3.8. And to cover himself with a
Cloud that Prayers could not pass through, verse 44. When he rejects the
petitions of any. See Esa. 1.15. and 59.2. etc.

[ Smelling] is attributed to God, Smelling.
but which in like manner his Complacency and Grace is noted, as a man is
refreshed and pleased with a sweet smell, as Genesis 8.21. And the Lord smelled a
savor of rest (so the Hebrew) The Chald. says, and the Lord received their
sacrifice very pleasingly -- Upon which place Luther, In Aureo Commentario,
hocloco sicut medici Nonunquam exanimes suavitate odorum revocant, etc.

Per Anthropopathiam Moses Deo tribuit odorandi facultatem and de sacrificio
Noe non scribit, etc.


says thus -- As Physicians sometimes recover fainting or swounding Persons, by
the fragrancy of of Odors, and on the contrary as a horrible stench does
vehemently offend Nature, and sometimes makes men faint; so God may be said to
be offended with the ill savor of impiety, and to be delighted, and as it were
refreshed, when he sees ( Noah) provide himself to Sacrifice, as a specimen of
his gratitude, and by a public example manifest himself not to be wicked, but
a true and cordial Worshipper and Reverencer of God, which was the proper end
of Sacrifices.

Musculus in his Comment upon the place says very excellently, that Moses by an
Anthropopathy ascribes the faculty of Smelling to God, and writes not of the
Sacrifice of Noah, for it is not said that the Lord smelled the Odor of the
Burnt-Offering, but a sweet savor; for God smells not by the Organ of Nostrils
as man does, for it was not the smell of the Sacrifice of Beasts that yielded
that fragrancy, such being in themselves rather nauseous then sweet -- Hence we
learn that our Works of what kind soever they be, have a certain Smell which
ascends to the Nostrils of God, and is either approved by him as sweet and
pleasing, or disapproved as noisome and unsavory. This Odor is, not what our
external works represent to sense, but what results from the spirituality of
our Hearts; for good Acts proceeding from a good and pious intention smell
sweetly, but bad ones the contrary. In the Sacrifice of Noah, there was a
Corporal and external Savor, which was obvious to the notice of men, but the
piety of his Heart was pleasing to God, whilst in the sincerity and
faithfulness of a pious mind, he acknowledged and celebrated the goodness of
his Lord, etc. To this may be referred several other places where this phrase
(of a sweet smelling savor is sound, as Exodus 29.18, 25, 41. Levit. 1.9. and
2.12. and 3.16. and 8.21. Number. 28.2. Ezekiel. 20.28., 41. etc Doubtless in these
places respect is had to the Messiah* whom the Sacrifices of the Old Testament
typified, as Ephesians. 5.2. Christ Jesus also has loved us, and has given himself
for us an Offering and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor. So Esa.
11.3. Where it is said, that he shall make him of a sent or a smell (so the
Hebrew) in the fear of the Lord, which is expounded of the propitiatory
Sacrifice of Christ, and his Obedience to the Father even unto Death, which the
Prophet calls the fear of the Lord, according to 2 Cor. 2.15. For we are made
of God a sweet savor of Christ, that is, our Ministry to God through Christ,
is as it were accepted as a sweet Sacrifice. See Romans 15.16. Psalm. 45.8, 9.
Came. 1.3. etc.

[ Tasting and Touching] are ascribed to God, of which there are not many
examples, Taste and Touch.
Psalm. 104.34. My meditation shall be sweet to him (so the Hebrew) that is,
grateful and acceptable. Hosea 9 4. They shall not offer Wine (offerings) to
the Lord, for they shall not be sweet unto him, that is, not pleasing nor
accepted. See Mal. 3.4. Jer. 30.21. Psalm. 40.8, 9. John 4.32, 34.

It is said Psalm. 104.32. He Touches the Hills and they smoke (as if it were
said) by his Touch only he can destroy the loftiest and most firm things -- So
some say that the phrase, Psalm. 144.5. alludes to the smoking of Mount Sinai at
the promulgation of the Law, Exodus 19. and 20. Also some phrases may be reduced
hither that are mentioned, where a hand is attributed to God, as before.

So much of the external Actions of Sense, whose Affections are Sleep and
Watchfulness; The Cessation of sense as Sleep. Lib. de somno and Vigil c. 1.
for as in Sleep the actions of sense are still and quiet, so in Watchfulness
they are provoked to their respective Operations, as Aristotle says.

Both these are by an Anthropopathy attributed to God, Psalm. 44.23, 24. Awake
why Sleep thou, O Lord, cast us not off for Ever, Psalm 78.65. Then the Lord
awaked as one out of Sleep, Jer. 31.26. Upon this I awaked and beheld and my
Sleep was sweet unto me, by the former a delay of Divine help is noted, by the
later his strength and power against his Enemies, and his Favor and Grace
toward his Church after that delay. Awaking without the mention of Sleep is
expressed. Psalm. 35.22, 23. Esa. 51.9. etc. It is said Psalm. 121.3, 4 He that
keeps thee, will not slumber -- Behold he that keeps Israel, shall neither
slumber nor sleep, by which phrase the absolute and undoubted certainty of
Divine help is declared. So Watching is attributed to God, (...) vigilavit
and denotes his assiduity or dispatch, in inflicting Punishments or granting
benefits, Jer. 31.28. and 44.27.

Locomotive Actions.
Actions of the second kind, as local motion, are ascribed to God by an
Anthropopathy as Coming unto Believers, whereby the exhibition of his Grace and
Blessings is to be understood, Exodus 20.24. John 14.23. There is also a Coming
to Judge and Punish, Esa. 3.13, 14. To which belongs that in Hos 11.9. I will
not come (or enter) into the City, that is, in an hostile manner, or to destroy
it, as Sodom.

[ Walking] is attributed to God, whereby his gracious presence, and help is
signified, Levit. 29.12. And I will Walk in the midst of you, that is, ye shall
have my present help, and protection -- So Deuteronomy. 23.14. 2 Cor. 6.16. Levit.
26.24. It is said, then will I also walk contrary to you and punish you, that
is, without distinction of persons, I will let the Reins of mine Anger loose
upon you.

God is said to Come down from Heaven, when he takes apparent and especial
cognizance of the actions of men, and that sometimes out of grace and favor,
as Exodus 3.8. or to punish in Wrath and Anger, as Genesis 11.5, 7. and 18.21.
Psalm. 18.9, 10. Esa. 64.1. etc.

The Son of God is said to Come down from Heaven, when he assumed humane
Nature, and manifested himself to men in order to their Salvation, John 3.13.
and 6.38, 42, 50. The Holy Spirit is said to Come down, when in the visible
appearance of a Dove it manifested it self resting upon Christ, Matthew. 3.16.
Mark 1.10. Luke 3.22. John 1.32, 33. In another signification God promised that
he would go down with Jacob into Egypt, that is, that his Grace and protection
should accompany him in that way, Genesis 26.4.

[ Riding] is ascribed unto God, by which his glorious operation is noted,
which he exerts in the Heavens, in tempests and otherwise, Deuteronomy. 33.26. There
is none like unto the God of Jesurun, who Rides upon the Heaven, Psalm. 68.33.
To him that Rides upon the Heaven of Heavens. Likewise his speed and celerity,
in the execution of his Judgments, Psalm. 18.10. He rode upon a Cherub, and did
fly, yea he did fly upon the wings of the Wind. So Esa. 19.1. etc.

To Meet or Meeting with a person is ascribed to God, and signifies either his
manifestation is noted, as Number. 23.4, 16. Or his Grace and Beneficence, as Esa.
64.5. God is said to Return to his place, which signifies a sending of
Punishment, Hos. 5.15. For when men are afflicted, and help is delayed, God
seems to be absent from them.

Jud. 16.13. Lam. 3.43, 44. A [Returning] on High, Returning:
signifies his going into his Judicial Throne, or Divine Judgment it self,
Psalm. 7.7. A Returning to the Godly, signifies the taking away of Sin and the
exhibition of Grace, Psalm. 6.4, 5. Zach. 1.3.

By his [Rising] up his Divine purpose with respect to his great Works is
noted, Rising up
Number. 10.35. Psalm. 12.5, 6. and 44.26, 27. and 68.1, 2. and 102.14. Esa. 33.10.

The Holy Ghost coming upon one, signifies that it works in a singular manner
in and by him, Luke 1, 35. Act. 1.8. which Luke 24.49. is to be endued with
power from on High.

A [Passing] through, or passing over, is attributed to God, Transition.
Exodus 12.12, 13. Amos 5.17. By which Divine punishment is noted sometimes a
forbearance from punishing, as Amos 7.8. and 8.2. With 1.3. Micah 7.18. Prove.
19.11. (...) Pesach or Pascha, the Passover takes its Name from hence, Exodus
12, 13, 23 -- So it is used in the Deliverance of the People from the Babylonish
Captivity, Esa. 31.5. Dan. 5.30.

[ Visitation] is ascribed to God, by which either his exploration, that is,
Visitation.
a diligent search, notice or knowledge of things, Psalm. 17.3. Or a real
exhibition of his Grace and Benefits is noted, Genesis 21.1. Psalm. 65.9, 10. Psalm.
106.4. Jerem. 29.10. Luke 19.44. etc. Sometimes it denotes Wrath and
Punishment, Exodus 34.7. Psalm. 59.6. Esa. 27.1. Jerem. 6.6. and 15.3.

Sometimes a diligent [Search] is attributed to God, Ezekiel. 20.6. Searching. In
Comment. hoc loco.
To bring them forth out of the Land of Egypt, to the Land which I Searched out
for them, (so it is in the Hebrew) flowing with Milk and Honey; the Land of
Judaea is commended (says Junius) by the Providence and choice of the Eternal
God, because (as if it were by search) he had provided it for a most commodious
seat, where after they had cast out their Enemies they were to rest, etc. the
like is said of the Ark of the Covenant, Number. 10.33.

[ Seeking,] which is done by going up and down, is also ascribed to God,
Seeking.
signifying his desire and serious will, Ezekiel. 22.30. John 4.23. etc.

[Finding] out Iniquity is attributed likewise to God, Finding.
when he chastises and Punishes in Wrath, Genesis 44.16. He is said to Find his
Enemies, when he lays condign Punishment upon them. He is said to Find David
his Servant, when out of singular Love and Providence he elected and made
choice of him, Psalm. 89.20. Acts 13.22. In which sense he is also said to Seek
him, 1 Samuel 13.14.

The third kind of Action is generative, not that Eternal Generation,
Procreative or generative Actions.
by which God the Father from Everlasting begat the Son, Coeternal and
Consubstantial with himself, for that is not metaphorical, but most proper,
Psalm. 2.7. Prove. 8.24, 25. Heb. 1.5. But that Spiritual and Mystical
Generation, by which he is said to beget his believing People, when he remits
their sin, renews his own Image upon them, and Adopts them into the privilege
of Sonship, through Christ the Savior -- Of which see Esa. 66.9. John 1.13.
and 3, 5, 6. Tit. 3.5. 1 Pet. 1.3, 23. 1 John 3.9. Jam. 1.18. etc.

God is said to be a Father with respect to certain inanimate Creatures, Job
38.28. Has the Rain a Father, or who has begotten the drops of the Dew? --
that is, besides me? For there is no other can send it upon the Earth -- by
which God intimates, that he only can give this benefit, and that men cannot
imitate it. And verse 29. Out of whose Womb came the Ice? (that is, where is
the Artist besides me, that can make it?) And the hoary frost of Heaven, who
has gendred it? viz. beside me.

To this may be referred that phrase, Zeph. 2.2. Where God says, before the
Decree bring forth. Parate vos in occursum Domini, cum nondum parit, seu in
lucem edit and exequitur, Decretum seu statutum quod poenis velut pregnans Deus
fecit, easque jam parturit, etc. Tarnovius in loc.
Upon which place the Learned Tarnovius thus paraphrases. Prepare your selves
to meet the Lord, who has not yet brought forth, produced or excuted his
Decree, or Statute, which he (as if he were pregnant with punishment) goes now
big with -- For as the Birth does not immediately follow Conception, but has a
certain allotted and prescribed time by Natures Law, for its ripening or
maturity -- So God although he has certainly decreed to punish, and has
established and conceived the sentence in his own mind; yet he defers execution
for a certain space, that he may give opportunity for Repentance, which if
sinners will by no means do, then their iniquity grows Ripe, and Gods
punishment mature, and fit for Execution. And as the Birth must of necessity
follow conception, when the time limited by Nature is expired -- So the
Judgments of God are inevitable, when the determinate time comes.

Humane Adjuncts ascribed to God.
(...), privativa; et (...), positiva.
THese are either privative, or positive -- Of the first sort are these, viz.
When something of impotency or inability is (after the manner of men)
attributed to God -- or when God says of himself, that he cannot do a thing,
being as it were prohibited by his Truth, Goodness, and Holiness, as Genesis
19.22. Have thee, escape thither, for I cannot do any thing till thou be come
thither -- These are the words of the Son of God, who when he departed from
Abraham, turned toward Sodom, to destroy the Cities, and says thus to Lot,
viz. Whereas it is the immutable and certain determination of God, out of a
gracious and favorable respect to you, to deliver you from this destruction,
therefore before you be placed in safely the Execution of the sentence by which
Sodom must be burnt, shall be delayed -- Upon which place D. Hunnius says, the
execution of Gods absolute Decree or Power no Creature can retard, Potentiam
Dei absolutam nulla creatura retardare potest. Hic vero loquitur de sua
potentia, prout illa, etc.
but here he speaks of his Power as it is tempered, qualified and allayd, by
the favor of his fatherly mercy toward men, and as accommodated for the
profit of Believers, that nothing which he does shall hurt them.

To this may be referred that speech of God, which of all is most sweet and
gracious, and full of comfort (inasmuch as it was spoken in the very swelling,
as it were, of Anger.) When he speaks to Moses of the grievous sin and Apostasy
of the People, Exodus 32.10. Now therefore let me alone, that my Wrath may wax
hot against them, and that I may consume them, etc. Jehovah speaks as if he had
been bound and constrained by the Faith and Prayer of Moses, so as that he
could not destroy the People, unless he had asked him leave, as Psalm. 106.23.
Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen, stood
before him in the breach to turn away his Wrath lest he should destroy them. Of
so great a virtue and efficacy are the Prayers of the just before the Lord,
James 5.16. See Genesis 32.28. Hosea 12.4. Josh. 10.12, 13, 14. etc. Esa. 1.13.
The calling of Assemblies I cannot away with (or more properly I cannot bear)
it is iniquity. This is expounded with respect to the sanctity of God, and his
abomination of iniquity, as verse 14. Your New Moons, and your appointed Feasts
my soul hates, which is intima^^ed by these phrases of humane abhorrence.

Something also of loosned or disjointed Members, after the manner of men is
attributed to God, (...)
as Jer. 6, 8. Be thou instructed, O Jesuralem, lest my soul be loosned or
disjointed from thee, (so the Hebrew) that is, lest after the manner of a
member that is broken, or out of Joint, it departs from, or be separate from
thee, and thou as a strange member be cut off, or divided from me.

Junius.
Ezekiel. 23.18. She discovered her Whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness; then
my mind was, (...) disjointed from her. By this phrase the Communion of God
with Believers is most excellently expressed; for, if for their wilful and
contumacious Rebellions God departs from them, the head is, as it were,
separated or plucked off the putrified members, as the Lord by a like metaphor,
speaks to the wicked Synagogue, Jer. 15.6. For thou have forsaken me says, the
Lord, thou art gone backward: Therefore will I stretch out my hand against
thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with Repenting. Much and great was the
forbearance and patience of God, before this desertion, which is indeed the
filling the Measure of Iniquity spoken of, Genesis 15.16. Matthew. 23.32. To these
privatives in man may be referred Diseases, by which is signified the
punishment of sin, which Christ bore in our stead, Esa. 53.4.10. Suitable to
Hos. 13.14. I will ransom them from the power of the Grave: I will redeem them
from Death: O Death, I will be thy Plagues! O Grave I will be thy Destruction!
Rep^^ntance shall be hid from mine Eyes. Thus he speaks with respect to his
Sacerdotal or Priestly Office, as Heb. 2.14. Forasmuch as the Children are made
partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself took part of the same, that
through Death he might destroy him, that had the Power of Death, that is, the
Devil.

(2.) With respect to his Prophetical Office, 2 Timothy 1.10. Because by the
Gospel he has abolished Death, and brought Life and Immortality to Light: For
he strongly defends his Church, so as that the Gates of Hell shall not prevail
against it, and 1 Cor. 15.26. The last Enemy that shall be destroyed is Death.
Here is a most evident symbol of the Resurrection, as Junius and Tremellius
upon the place rightly conclude. Paul upon these words of Hosea, 1 Cor. 15.55.
Thus speaks; O death where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? etc.

Of the second sort of men's Actions, which are ascribed to God, Positive
Adjuncts
there may a distinction be made, viz. Such as are internal, and such as are
external. The internal are with respect to the diverse States, Circumstances,
or Conditions of men; and so God is said to be a [ Husbandman,] that is,
(Synechdochically) a Vine dresser, (...). Husband man.
John 15.1. The reason of the Comparison follows in the next verses, and is
largely expounded, Esa. 5. and Matthew. 20. etc. Christ, who is the hypostatical
Wisdom of God, and his Eternal Son, calls himself a Workman, when he speaks of
the Creation, Workman.
Cant. 7.1. For by him were all things made, and without him was nothing made
that was made, John 1.3. Col. 1.16. etc.

So God is said to be the [Builder] and Maker of a City, which has
Foundations, Builder. (...) ar^^sex and conditor. Man of War*
Heb. 11.10. that is, the Cause, Fountain and Author of Eternal Life and
Heavenly Joy.

So he is called a [Man of War,] Exodus 15.3. From that Almighty work of his of
overwhelming and drowning Pharaoh with his Egyptian Host. Besides in Wars waged
among men, he is the chief General, and Captain, giving Victory to whom he
pleases, and scattering, routing, or destroying whom he pleases. See Psalm. 46.
and 76. etc.

Christ is called a Counselor, Counselor.
Esa. 9.6. with respect to his most wise decree in restoring Salvation, at
whose disposal it was, 1 Timothy 1.9. Who has saved us, and called us with an
holy Calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and
Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began. Likewise with
respect to his most Holy Office, in manifesting the Divine will to our
capacities in order to Salvation, and his obedience to the Father, etc. The
Lord is called a Physician, Exodus 15.26. Because he frees men from all perils
of Souls and Bodies (which are frequently compared to Diseases) Psalm 147.2.3.
etc. This is peculiarly ascribed to Christ the Redeemer, for the blessing of
spiritual health, which we receive from him, Matthew. 9.12. Mark. 2.17. See Esa.
61.1.

He is called a [ Shepherd] Psalm. 23.1. Shepherd.
Which appellation is also peculiarly attributed to Christ, with respect to his
Office as a Savior, Cant. 1.7. and 2.16. and 6.2. Ezekiel. 34.23. and 37.24.
Micah 5.3, and 7.14. Zach. 13.7. John 10.11. Heb. 13.20. 1 Pet. 2.25. and 5.4.
and elsewhere.

He is called a [Father] Deuteronomy. 32.6. Psalm. 68.6 Esa. 64.8. Matthew. 6.1, 6, 8, 9.
Romans 8.15. Which term is most full of Comfort and Joy, Father.
declaring the Love and Affection of the Omnipotent God toward men -- So he is
called Father of spirits, Heb. 12.9. etc. Christ called the Everlasting Father,
or as in the Hebrew, the Father of Eternity, Esa. 9.6. Because he most
sincerely loves Believers, and Glorifies them in blessed Eternity -- The
seventy have most elegantly translated this place (...), pater futuri seculi,
the Father of the Age to come.

Firstborn.
He is called the [First-born,] Psalm. 89.27. Col. 1.15, 18. Rev. 1.5. Jehovah,
and Christ, are frequently called, Prince, Captain, King, Esa. 9.6. and 55.4.
and 32.1. and 33.22. To denote their Majesty and celestial Dominion; of which
more elsewhere.

Bridegroom.
He is called a [Bridgroom] Matthew. 9.15. and 25.1. Mark. 2.19. Luke 5.34. John
3.29. This Title is ascribed to Christ, for many Causes, principally for his
unspeakable Love to his Church which is by Faith espoused to him, Hosea 2.19.
Ephesians. 5.26, 27, 28, etc.

Witness.
He is called a [ Witness,] which term is applied to the Messiah, Esa. 43.10.
and 55.4. Rev. 1.5. and 3.14. Because of a certainty he discovers heavenly
Truth to us, John 18.37. As also because he has most exactly fulfilled
whatsoever the Prophets of the Old Testament have foretold concerning him, John
1.17. etc.

Peace and being in a Place.
External Adjuncts of a man are either inseparable or separable -- The
inseparable are, being in a place and time. Each of these is attributed to God,
(who in his own nature is Eternal, and not circumscribed to place) by an
Anthropopathy -- First,

More Generally, [Place] is ascribed to God Psalm. 24.3. Who shall stand in his
Holy Place, viz. The Holy Kingdom where the Scriptures say his Habitation is.
He is said to Go out of his place, when he manifests his conspicuous and
apparent presence, as Esa. 26.21. Micah. 1.3. He is said to Retire or Return to
his place, when he withdraws the benefit of his Grace, and as it were hides
himself in order to punish offenders, Hosea. 5.15.

More specially, a seat or [ Throne] is attributed to God, Exodus 17.16. (of
which before) Psalm. 9.7, 8. and 11.3, 4. and 47.8, 9. Esa. 66.1. Matthew. 5.34.
Throne.
By which his most superexcellent Majesty, sublimity and Authority is
intimated. The Prophet Jer. 14.21. Prays God, that he would not abhor, or
disgrace the throne of his Glory -- By which Judea is understood, wherein the
visible or peculiar Kingdom of God was contained, and where God vouchsafed the
most eminent appearances of his Power and Glory. Or else the Temple of
Jerusalem, as in chap. 17.12. In more Nebochim
It is taken, upon which Rabbi Moses Maimon. Every place which God has
appointed for the manifestation of his Power and Glory is called his Throne.
For great and powerful men as Kings and Princes sit in their Thrones, when they
make a solemn appearance, so are we to understand this word ((...) Kiss,
solemn) Throne, of the Magnificence, Power and Dignity of him, to whom it is
attributed.

When a [ Throne] and sitting upon it, is attributed to Christ, we are to
understand that heavenly Kingdom and Government to which he was exalted in his
humane nature, as Psalm. 45.6, 7. Esa. 16.5. Matthew. 19.28. Heb. 1.8. and 4.16.
and 8.1. etc.

The Earth is said to be the Lords [Footstool,] Esa. 66.1. Matthew. 5.35. By
which is noted his immensity, Footstool.
for he is present in the lowermost part of the World. Or the Ark of the
Covenant, in which by special revelation, he was to manifest his presence,
according to 1 Chronicles. 28.2. Psalm. 99.4, 5. and 132.6, 7. Lam. 2.1. Some by this
appellation would understand the Sanctuary of God. See Psalm. 99.4, 5, 8, 9.
Upon which Illyricus says -- the sense is -- know, that no where else, nor with
any of the Gentiles is the true Worship of God, and his propitious presence to
be found. Therefore seek him here according to his Word and Promises. When it
is said of Christ -- Psalm. 110.1. The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou on my
righthand, until I have made thine Enemies thy Footstool, and 1 Cor. 15.25. For
he must Reign till he has put his Enemies all under his feet, and Heb. 1.13.
It intimates that he will most perfectly conquer and subdue his Enemies, as it
is said, Psalm. 8.6. Ephesians. 1.22. Heb. 2.8. etc. That all things are put under his
Feet.

Neither is [ Place] only ascribed to God, but a local Posture or Situation
also, as Psalm. 10.1. Why stand thou afar, off by which the delay of Divine
help is noted; A metaphor taken from men, who when they stand at great distance
cannot lend a helping hand. To stand at the right hand, notes his powerful help
and favor, as Psalm. 16.8. Because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved.
So Act. 2.25. God is said to Sit, Psalm. 29.10. and other places, in the same
sense that a Throne is ascribed to him; by which his Government, Divine
Judgment, and exercises in peculiar actions are signified.

He is said to Sit upon a Cherub] Psalm. 80.1. and 99.1. because of the peculiar
manifestation of his presence in that place.

He is said to Sit upon the Circle of the Earth, Esa. 40.22. because of his
Majesty in Glory, which infinitely excells all the Glories of the World, and
therefore the Inhabitants of the Earth are called Grasshoppers, etc.

Of the sitting of Christ at the right hand of God, we have spoken before --
God is said to Dwell on High, in Sion, in the Church, and in Contrite hearts,
etc. Psalm. 68.16, 17. and 132.12, 13, 14. Psalm. 135.20, 21, Esa. 57.19, Ezekiel.
37.27. John 14.23. 2 Cor. 6.16. by which the gracious Manifestation, Action,
Defense, Illumination, Consolation, and Salvation, of his Divine presence to
his people is to be understood. (...), quod proprie est, ut superhabitet
superme virtus Dei, vel, ut super me tabernaculum suum collocet.


It is an emphatical word which Paul uses, 2 Cor. 12.9. That the power of
Christ may rest upon me, the words properly are, that the virtue or power of my
God may dwell upon me, or that he would place his Tabernacle upon me, and as an
Vmbrage or Shadow may surround, cloth and protect me. When the Cloud of Glory
had filled the Temple, Solomon said, 1 King. 8.12. The Lord said that he would
dwell in the thick darkness, that is, by this sign, he manifests himself to be
present, as he said to Moses, Lev. 16.2. I will appear in the Cloud upon the
Mercy-Seat. See Exodus 19.9. and chap. 16.10. Number. 9.15. Esa. 6.4. Matthew. 17.5.
etc.

The phrase of Gods sitting in the Heavens, or dwelling there, as Psalm. 2.4.
Psalm. 103.18, 19. 1 King. 8.39, 43. and Illyricus thus expounds. Non potest nec
debet Coelum, cum pro habitatione Dei accipitur, intelligi de loco aliquo certo
reali aut Materiali; sed p^^tius est metaphorica significatio, etc. Illyr. In
Exeg. Tom. 1. p. 801. Deus est ubique ratione essentiae, etc. lib. de Trinit.
cap. 50. In Syntagm. Theol. p. 195.
Heaven neither ought nor can, when it is called the Habitation of God, be
understood of a certain real or material place, but it has rather a
metaphorical signification, and denotes that spiritual Kingdom, Glory, and
Felicity in which God with his Holy Angels and other blessed Spirits Lives and
Reigns, as Psalm. 115.15, 16. The Heaven, even the Heavens are the Lords, but
the Earth has he given to the Children of men, that is, he requires and
Commands spiritual good and Divine Worship to be given to him, and leaves them
to enjoy the good things of the World, for he in a proper sense, requires not
Money, Calves, or Kids, etc.

And the Learned Gerhard says -- God is every where, with respect to his
Essence, but he is said to dwell in Heaven with respect to the more ample
appearance of his Majesty and Glory; so the whole soul is in every part of the
Body, but most radically in the head, most effectively in the head, because,
its most excellent effects are from thence produced -- So Alcuinus -- God is
therefore said to dwell in the Heavens, because the Angels and the Souls of
blessed Saints have a clearer and more illustrious prospect and knowledge of
him, then the Saints on Earth can have, by reason of their dwelling in so gross
a habitation. Likewise Polanus -- The Scripture oftentime says, that God dwells
in the Heavens, not that he is there included, but to intimate, that he is
above all in Majesty, Power, and Operation, so as that he cannot be hindered by
any on Earth; as also that our minds may be elevated above the World, so as
that we may have no low, or carnal, or worldly thoughts of God, etc.

To this may be also referred, when it is said, That the Holy Ghost does rest
upon any, as Number. 11.25, 26. 2 King 2.15. By which, the distribution and energy
or power of his gifts is intimated. This Spirit is said to rest upon the
Messiah, Esa. 11.2. and 61.1. which is to be understood of the Communication of
his gifts in their absolute fullness to Christ according to his humanity, Psalm.
45.7, 8. John 3.34. The visible symbol was the resting of the Holy Spirit upon
Christ in the likeness of a Dove, Matthew. 3.16. etc.

Time.
[ Time] is ascribed to God (...) (in a way of humane) speaking, but is to be
understood (...) (in a way of divine Dialect) of his absolute
Eternity-Sometimes the description of Gods Eternity is taken from the Names and
Differences of Seasons, as [ Years] are ascribed unto God, which nevertheless
are said to be throughout all generations, Psalm. 102.24. And shall have no end,
verse 2^^. That he is the same and that his years shall not fail, Heb. 1.12.
And that the Number of his Years cannot be searched out, as Job 36.26.

[ Dayes] are also attributed to him, whence he is called the Ancient of Days,
Dan 7.9. which are called the Days of Eternity, Micah. 5.1. 2 Pet. 3.18.
Eternity is described by eternal time or times, Romans 16.25. 2 Timothy 1.9. Tit.
1.2. and (...), secula, Ages, by which term properly times, and things done in
time are noted. Ephesians. 3.9. Col 1.26. etc.

Sometimes two or three differences of time, that Eternity which wants
Beginning, Interruption, and End, may be expressed, Heb. 13.8. Jesus Christ the
same (that is, always like himself, invariable, and immutable) yesterday, to
day, and for ever, that is, from Eternity to Eternity, Rev. 1.4. Grace be unto
you and Peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come, (or will
be) that is, who is the Eternal God; so in the 8th. verse, there is another
symbol of Eternity I am (...) and (...), Alpha and Omega, the first and last
letters of the Greek Alphabet, which denote the beginning and end of any thing,
which are the bounds and notes of time, brought to express him who is the
beginning without beginning, and the end without end, that is, who is indeed
absolutely Eternal; so Christ speaks chap. 21. and 22.13. as is apparent from
the context.

To this may be referred, where the Scripture uses words concerning God, which
respect the time to come, whereas in Eternity there is not properly any time
past, or to come, as Psalm. 139.2. Thou understandest my thought a far off, that
is, long before it came in my mind, as verse 4. For there is not a word in my
Tongue but lo, O Lord, thou know it altogether. It is said Romans 8.29. For
whom he did (...), foreknow, Gods Foreknowledge.
he also did predestinate, etc. Romans 11.2. God has not cast away his people,
which he foreknew, etc 1. Pet. 2. Elected according to the Foreknowledge of God
the Father, etc.

D. Mylius, upon Romans 8. says thus, God is said to Foreknow such as he foresaw
would believe in his son, not that there is any future time properly ascribable
to God, in whom no accident, condition, or circumstance of time and place can
be admitted, but these things are spoken of God by an Anthropopathy, that is
after the manner of men.

This [ Prescience] of God, inasmuch as it is certain and never fails,
therefore such as he Foreknew he also predestined, for this Foreknowledge is
never without predestination. Ambrose confirms this interpretation, in these
words. Those whom God Foreknew would embrace the Faith, fol. 213.
he elected them to the promised rewards, that they that seem to believe, and
either are not really such as they pretend to be, or forsake the Faith may be
excluded, for such as God has elected to himself do remain his, 1 Pet. 1.20.
It Is said of Christ the Lamb of God, and the Redeemer of the World that he was
(...), Foreknown before the Foundation of the World, Some separable Adjuncts
ascribed to God.
that is, he was ordained by the Eternal Decree of God to be offered as a
sacrifice for the sins of men.

Hitherto of inseparable Adjuncts, the separable are various, we shall recite
some.

Armor.
[ Armor and Weapons] are attributed to God, for he is sometimes said to be
clad in Arms to denote the exertion, or execution of his Wrath and Vengeance,
Psalm. 35.2, 3. Take hold of Shield and Buckler, and stand up for mine help --
Draw out also the Spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me, etc.
Esa. 59.17, 18. For he put on Righteousness as a Breast Plate and an Helmet of
Salvation upon his head, and he put on the Garments of Vengeance for Clothing,
and was clad with zeal as a Cloak, etc. Jer. 50.25. It is said, The Lord has
opened his Armory, and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for
this is the work of the Lord God of Hosts in the Land of the Chaldeans; when by
the Enemy he brings punishment, and a general destruction upon a people,
Panolethria.
thus the King of Babylon is called Gods battle axe and weapons of War, for
with him will he break in pieces the Nations, and with him will he destroy
Kingdoms, Jer. 51.20. Because by him, and his Host the Lord did afflict and
make desolate several Countries.

More especially a [ Bow, Arrows, and strings,] are attributed to God, Bow and
Arrows
Psalm. 21.12. Lam. 2.4. and 3.12. He has bent his bow like an Enemy -- he has
set me as a mark for the Arrow -- By which the effects of his Divine wrath
against the wicked are noted By the Arrows of God are meant swift and unlookt
for Calamities sent for sin, Deuteronomy. 32.22, 23, 24. I will heap mischiefs upon
them, I will spend mine Arrows upon them, Job 6.4. Psalm. 38.2, 3. and 64, 7, 8.
Zach. 9.14. Lam. 3.13. And more particularly the Arrows of God are said to be
Hailstones, Thunder, Lightnings, Coals of Fire, etc. Psalm. 18.13, 14. and
144.6. Hab. 3.11. Sometimes the inspired efficacy of the Gospel in saving the
Godly, and Judging and Condemning the wicked, Psalm. 45.5. Esa. 49.2. John
12.47, 48. 2 Cor. 2.15, 16.

A [Sword] is ascribed to God, Sword.
by which likewise is intimated his Wrath and Vengeance of which that is an
index and symbol. Deuteronomy, 32.41. Judge. 7.20. Ps. 17.18. Esa. 27.1. and 34.5, 6.
Ezekiel. 21.8, 9, 10. Zach. 13.7. Munsterus upon Esa. 34. says that the Sword of
the Lord is his Divine Decree, which none can change, Psalm. 35.2, 3. By these
Weapons Divine Vengeance is metaphorically described. See Rev. 19.15, 21. The
term (Sword) is applied also to God with respect to its penetrating force, of
which more hereafter in its proper place.

A [ glittering Spear] or lightning Spear, is attributed to God, Hab. 3.11.
Stones, Hail, Thunder, Lightning, etc. sent from Heaven are thereby noted, as
Josh. 10.11.

When a [ Shield or Target] is ascribed to God, it is to be understood of his
propitious Favor and Mercy to men through Christ, becoming their defense,
protection and security -- warding (as a Shield does blows) all assaults and
violences of the Enemy, and converting all into Good for his people. Genesis 15.1.
Deuteronomy. 33.29. Psalm. 3.3, 4. Psalm. 18.2.3. Psalm. 28.6, 7. Psalm. 84.11, 12. Psalm.
5.12. For thou, O Lord, wilt bless the Righteous: With favor will thou compass
them as with a Shield. The Word of God is called a Shield, Psalm. 91.4. Prove.
30.5. Ephesians. 6.16. The Word a Shield.
Because when it is received by Faith, its virtue is exerted in the defense of
Believers.

The Holy Spirit is called an [ Earnest] given by God to Believers, The Spirit
an Earnest.
2 Cor. 1.22. and chap 5.5. Ephesians. 1.14. The Hebrews call (...) (of whom the
Greeks borrowed (...), the Latins Arrhabo,) any thing that is given to confirm
a promise or bind a bargain, therefore some translate it a pledge. According to
Suidas Arrhabo or an Earnest, is a piece of money given by the Buyer to the
Seller to ascertain the payment of the residue -- Jerome says, it is a certain
Testimony, Evidence, or Obligation to secure the bargain made. It differs from
a pledge, which is left as a security for the return of borrowed money, and
upon payment is returned to the Owner. The Holy Spirit is thus called because
it assures believers, that they shall obtain Eternal Life -- Some refer this
metaphor to Nuptials or Marriage, as the Bridegroom pledges his Faith to the
Bride, and gives her an Espousal token, as a pledge to assure her that he will
Marry her; so when God Espouses himself to believers, Hos. 2.19. I will betroth
thee unto me for ever, yea I will betroth thee unto me in Righteousness, and in
Judgment, and in Loving kindness and in Mercies, etc. But the Nuptials of the
Lamb did not yet appear, Rev. 19.7. Therefore God gives them a most noble
Earnest, viz. The Holy Spirit, to comfort their Hearts, and confirm their Faith
that they shall in due season be admitted to the Marriage of the Lamb.

It is said, Psalm. 75.8. For in the hand of the Lord there is a Cup, and the
Wine is red, Cup.
it is full of mixture, and he pours out the same; but the dregs thereof all
the wicked of the Earth shall wring them out, and drink, them -- by which, the
various kinds of Divine Afflictions are intimated.

Chariots.
The like Metaphor we meet with Esa. 51.17, 22. etc. [Chariots] are attributed
to God, by which either his Divine Magnificence is manifested to men, as Habac.
3.8. Thou did ride upon thine Horses, and thy Chariots of Salvation, or else
it denotes those Myriads of ministering Angels mentioned, Psalm. 68.17. The
Chariots of God are twenty thousand, even many thousands of Angels.

Orbitae tuae stillant pinguedinem.
The [ Wheels] by which a Chariot, or Cart moves are by an Elegant Metaphor
attributed to God, Psalm. 65.11. Thy Cart-wheels drop fatness -- (so the Hebrew)
that is, thy Clouds distill down Rain and Snow, which refresh and fertilize the
ground, so that with the blessing of God it produces various, profitable, and
necessary fruits -- The Clouds are called the Chariots and Horses of God, and
Rain is said to make the Earth fat and fruitful, Psalm. 18.10, 11, 12. and Psalm.
164.2, 3. Esa. 19.1.

Riches.
[ Riches] are attributed to God, by which the abundance of his Divine Majesty
and Glory, as also his Mercy and Grace are noted, Prove. 8.18. Romans 2.4. --
9.23. -- 10.12 -- 11.33. -- 2 Cor. 8.9. Ephesians. 1.7, 8, 18. -- 2.4, 7. -- 3.8, 16.
Col. 1.27. Phil. 4.19. Such as receive these in true Faith, are called Rich in
God, Luke 12.21. and Jam. 2.5.

[ Windows] are ascribed to Heaven the Habitation of God out of which he has
(as it were) a prospect and sends good or evil upon men, Windows.
Genesis 7.11. and 8.2.2. 2 Kings 7.2. Esa. 24.18. Mal. 3.10. Deuteronomy. 26.15. Psalm.
14.2. and 102.19, 20. Lam. 3.8, 50.

Furnace.
A [ Furnace] is attributed to God, Esa. 31.9. by which the Divine Vengeance
whereby God (as it were in a fiery oven) consumes the Enemies of his Church is
intimated, Esa. 30.30, 33. Psalm. 21.8, 9, 10.

Inheritance.
[ Lot, Portion or Inheritance] is attributed to God, when it is said that the
People and Land of Israel is his Heritage, Deuteronomy. 32.9. Jer. 2.7. and 12.7, 8.
and 6.18. etc. By which his great Love, and singular Care and Providence is
intimated. See Exodus 19.6. Deuteronomy. 11.12. And when it is said of Christ, that he
is constituted Heir of all things, Heb. 1.2. And that he has by Inheritance
obtained a more excellent name then Angels, ver. 4. it is with respect to his
right of primogeniture and Divine title of Command over all things.

Book.
A [ Book] is ascribed to God, by which his most exact knowledge and Providence
is noted -- the metaphor is taken from wisemen who are wont diligently to note
down in their Books such Persons, Things, and memorable Actions, which they
would remember.

The [ Book] of Gods Providence, generally considered, concerns every Creature,
as Psalm. 139.16. To this belongs the Book of Life, out of which to be blotted
is death which we find mentioned, Exodus 32.32, 33. compared with ver. 10. Numb.
11.5. And sometimes more specially it concerns the Church and Believers, Psalm.
56.8, 9. Mal. 3.16. The Book of life, so often mentioned in Scripture, as Esa.
4.3. Dan. 12.1. Psalm. 69.28.29. Phil. 4.3. Luke 10.20. Rev. 3.5. and 13.8. and
17.8. and 20.12, 15. and 21. ult. is nothing else but the singular knowledge
God has of such as shall be saved, of which. See 2 Timothy 2.19. The Lord knows
them that are his, etc. Or as it were, a Catalogue which God keeps of those who
by Faith in Christ are elected to Everlasting Life. In the vision of Daniel,
chap. 7.10. and John, Rev. 20.12. We find Books of Judgment mentioned, by
which that Divine and most exact knowledge of men's Deeds and Words are
symbolically denoted. And whereas the Scripture uses a plural expression.
Jerome and others do understand that there are two Books of Judgment, one for
Believers, the other for Unbelievers, for the World is wont to be distinguished
into these two sorts, John 3.18, ^^6. etc. To this relates that saying, Esa.
65.6. Jude 4. viz. Behold it is written before me, I will not keep silence, etc.

[ Oyl] or Anointing is attributed to God, Psalm. 45.7. Oil.
Thy God has Anointed thee with the Oil of gladness, above thy Fellows. Heb.
1.9. Cant. 1.3. Where the Holy Spirit with his gifts is understood which
appears by comparing the place with Esa. 61.1. Act. 10.38. John 3.34. Where the
Unction of Christ as a King and Priest is treated off, hence comes the
derivation of the name of our Savior, who is called (...), Vnctus, Anointed,
Joh^^ 1.42. and 4.25. (...), by way of eminency, Believers in a measure are
made partakers of this Unction, who by true Faith adhere to Christ the chief
head, as Esa. 61.3. 2 Cor. 1.21. 1 John 2.20, 27. Whence they also are rightly
denominated, (...)* Christians, (with respect to their primitive vocation or
Original) from the Anointed Savior Christ. See Romans 5.5. Tit. 3.5, 6. Zach.
12.10. etc.

[ Bread] is attributed to God, and Sacrifices with which it is said he is
pleased, Bread.
as a man with meat and drink, Numb. 28.2. Upon which place, Vatablus says, by
the term Bread, Flesh is understood as verse 24. and the sense is, keep up the
Rites of offering flesh and victimes which are sacrificed that they may be a
pleasure to me, therefore let me be refreshed with the favor of it as I
appointed. God calls sacrifices his Meat, after the manner of men, who are
chiefly fed with Flesh, Wine, Oil, Meal, Bread, etc. So God would have those
things in his sacrifices, not that he feeds on them, or (in proper speaking) is
delighted with them, but that they are grateful to him upon another account,
viz. For their Faith in his beloved Son, who was typified and shadowed by all
the Sacrifices. Christ is called the Bread of Life frequently, John 6.35, 48.
and other places for his quickening, strenghtning, and salutiferous energy, and
power, which is exerted or communicated to Believers, who by true Faith do
spiritually eat Christ, that is, recieve him, and apply his benefits to their
own Souls.

By this Trope God is an Hypothetical speech, A Seal.
attributes a Signet or [ Seal] to himself, Jer. 22.24. Though Coniah -- were
the Signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence, that is, although
he were most dear to me, and always in my sight, etc. For a Sealing Ring or
Signet is a symbol of Love and singular Care, as Cant. 8.6. Hag. 2.24.

The Character of the substance of God, Heb. 1.3. Heb. 1.3. The character of
his substance. (...), character sub^^tantiae ejus.
Is an appellation given to Christ -- the term [ Character] is a Metaphor taken
from the image, figure or impression of a Seal, representing the Prototype or
first p^^ttern it self in every thing: Bullinger in his Comment says, as the
Seal is most properly expressed in the wax, so the subsistency of the Father most
properly shines forth in Christ. (...) (which (...) comes from (...),
insculpere, to ingrave) in this place does not so much respect the Image or
impression taken, as the Seal it self. The Father has (as it were) most
indelibly engraven, his whole Essence and Majesty upon this his Eternal Son,
and has drawn his own effigies upon him from Everlasting, being his substantial
Image, and exact representation, which explication fairly agrees with this
Mystery, leading our mind to such discoveries as will stir us up to desire the
gracious participation of its fruit and efficacy. For it opens the secret of
eternal generation, and shows us the Love of the heavenly Father. A Seal is
highly valued, and more closely kept then other things. Of the Fathers most
fervent Love to the Son, we have instances, Esa. 42.1. Matthew. 3.17. and 17.3.
John 3.35. and 17.24. By Zerubbabel, Hag. 2.23. Is meant Christ (of whom that
Captain of the People was a Type) the phrase I will make thee as a Signet is
thus to be understood, viz. I will take care of thee, in thee will I rest in
Love, thou shall be always in mine Eye, worn in my hand for I have chosen thee
alluding to, Esa. 42.1.

The use of a Seal is to make impression in Wax, by which Covenants are Sealed,
Ratified and Confirmed -- Christ is the heavenly Signet who has the Glory of
the Father, and the most express figure of his Majesty instampt upon him from
Eternity. The Foundation of God stands sure having this Seal, 2 Timothy 2.19. By
which Believers are Sealed, 2 Cor. 1.22. Ephesians. 1.13. and 4.30. John 3.33. with
6.27. A Signet leaves the Impression in the wax* By Christ the lost Image of
God is restored in Believers, now inchoatively or with respect of beginning;
after Death consummatively, or with respect to perfection, Col. 3.10. Renewed
in knowledge after the Image of him that created him, in him, and by him,
believers are made partakers of the Divine nature, 1 Pet. 1.4. Not by essential
transmutation but a Mystical Union.

Treasures.
[ Treasures] are ascribed to God, which is sometimes applied for Good, so the
Heavens are called his Treasures, Deuteronomy. 28.12. which is expounded, Act. 14.17.
He did good, and gave us Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seasons, filling our
hearts with Food and Gladness.

Sometimes it is put for Vengeance or Divine Wrath, Deuteronomy. 32.34. Is not this
laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my Treasures? To me belongs
Vengeance and Recompense, etc. Here is noted the certainty of Divine
punishment, because it is hoarded and laid up by God as it were in a Treasury,
and sealed up so, as that it becomes most certain.

(2.) His Justice and Righteousness, for by the infidelity and stubborness of
men their punishment is Treasured up, and they exposed to the Wrath of God,
etc. Romans 2.5.

(3) The long Forbearance and Patience of God in his delays of executing
Vengeance; for those things only are laid aside, of which there is not a
present, but a future use, etc.

(4.) His Severity, for which. See Jer. 50.25. and Romans 2.9, 10. This sealed
Treasure will be opened at the great Judgment, etc.

God is said to bring the Wind out of his Treasuries, Psalm. 135.7. Jer. 10.13.
and 51.16. By which not only its hidden original is declared, John 3.8. But
also its utility, and efficacy, and those other rare qualities which are in the
Wind. Job 38.22. There is mention made of the Treasures of Snow and Hail, for
the same Reason.

Heavenly and Eternal good things are called (and indeed they are the best)
Treasures, Esa. 33.6. Matthew. 6.20. and 19.21. Mark. 10.21. Luke 12.33. and
18.22. 2 Cor. 4.7. This is a Treasure that never fails, and they that use it
become the Friends of God, etc. Col. 2.3. All the Treasures of Wisdom and
Knowledge are said to be hid in Christ, that is, the whole fullness, or eminent
plenty of Divine Wisdom.

Clothing.
[ Cloathing] is ascribed to God, Psalm. 93.1. The Lord reigns, he is Clothed
with Majesty, the Lord is Clothed with Strength, wherewith he has girded
himself, Psalm. 104.1. Thou art Clothed with Honor and Majesty, verse 2. Who
coverest thy self with light as with a Garment, etc. By this is signified the
infinite and admirable Majesty and Beauty of God, who in his Creation of light,
and other great works, gave himself to be seen as it were by men. See Esa.
51.9. and 59.17. For in these places certain Garments are ascribed to God, in
his execution of Vengeance against his Enemies, by an elegant Hypotuposis --
The metaphor is taken from a Warrior completely armed who comes into the field
to encounter his Enemy. In both places Christ the Captain of our Salvation, is
to be understood by the Analogy of the Text -- He is said to be the arm of the
Lord, because he is the Power of God, 1 Cor. 1.24. And Esa. 59.14. It is said
that there was no intercessor of the race of man (that was dead in sin) that
could free him from the power of Satan, which is a plain intimation Christ
himself would be the intercessor, the Conqueror of Satan, and Death, and our
Savior. See ver. 20, 21. Where the promise of the Redeemer is plainly given.
And the Redeemer shall come to Sion, and unto them that turn from transgression
in Jacob, says the Lord -- etc. Psalm. 45.8. The Mystical habit of Christ the
Celestial Spouse is described, upon which place Brentius thus paraphrases.

All thy Garments smell of Myrrh, and Aloes and Cassia, out of the Ivory
Palaces, whereby they have made thee glad -- that is, all the Garments
wherewith thou art apparelled, and which can be produced for thy use, are not
composed of wooden or vile materials, but brought from Ivory (and most
precious) Repositories (for these are called the Houses or Palaces of Garments)
they yield no other Odor, but Myrrh, Aloes, and Cassia, that is, a most
fragrant and odoriferous scent, of which thou take pleasure; that is, that
most sweet fame which Christ himself and his Apostles by Preaching the Gospel
have spread not only in Judea, but in all parts of the World, Luke 10.17, 18,
19, etc. 2 Cor. 2.15, 16.

Christ is said passively to be put on by Believers, Romans 13.14. Gal. 3.27.
When he dwells in their hearts by Faith, Ephesians. 3.17. and makes them partakers of
his Celestial benefits.

The Apostles are said to be endued with strength from on high, Luke 24.49.
When they receive the gift of the Holy Spirit as it is expounded, Act. 1.8. On
the other side, a man is said to put on the Spirit of God, when it powerfully
speaks or operates in or by him, as a man that goes forth in order to any work
amongst men covers himself with a Garment, Judge. 6.34. 1 Chronicles. 12.18. 2 Chronicles.
24.20.

Moses calls Jehovah [A Banner,] when he gave the Altar he erected a Name,
Banner.
(...) Jehovah nissi. The Lord my Banner, Exodus 17.15. That is, the Lord is my
helper both now and hereafter, against the Amalekites, and all other
Adversaries, Esa. 11.10. it is said, the Messiah shall stand for an Ensign (or
Banner) of the People, by which his Kingly Office is noted, as this passage is
quoted, Romans 15.12. He shall rise to Reign over the Gentiles; For a Banner or
Trophy is a sign of Victory, Superiority, and Lordship, inasmuch as the People
are said to act under the Banner of the Prince. Christ is the only Asylum or
Refuge, where such as fly to him by Faith are protected and kept safe from the
spiritual Enemy, as the Soldiery repair to the Standard of the General, where
they are secure. See Cant. 2.4.

Psalm. 60.4. Thou have given a Banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
displayed because of the Truth -- Which may be truly applied to Christ; upon
these words Ainsworth says, that the word (Banner) is applied to the Flag or
Ensign of the Gospel, Esa. 11.12. and 49.22. and 62.10. Here to David and his
Victory -- to be high displayed, or to use for a Banner, which has the name of
lifting high, Esa. 59.19. The Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a Standard
against him, that is he shall bring to pass that Christ shall be that Standard
(or Banner) of the People, for as Soldiers aggregate or repair to the Military
Standard, so the Saints are gathered together by the knowledge of Christ, the
Captain of their Salvation.

A [ Rod] and Staff, is attributed to God and our Savior Christ, Psalm. 23.4. A
Rod.
Thy Rod and thy Staff comfor me, of which we have spoke in the Metonymie of
the sign for the thing signified, Psalm. 45.6. Psalm. 110.2. Heb. 1.8. The Rod or
Scepter of Christ, signifies his saving word whereby he directs his Church and
People. See Esa. 2.3.

The Rod of God, signifies also Castigation and Punishment, Job 9.34. and 21.9.
In both which places the Chaldee renders it a Stroke. The King of Assyria is
called the Rod of Gods Anger, Esa. 10.5. Because by him, as with a Rod, he was
to chastise the People, and declare his Wrath against sin. See verse 24. The
Word has almost the same signification, Psalm. 2.9. Where (the epithete of Iron
being added) it is a symbol of a more grievous and severe punishment, Thou
shall break them with a Rod of Iron, viz. Such contumacious and stubborn
Enemies, that despise thy Kingdom, whether they be Jews or Gentiles, as ver. 1,
2. These are prophetical words of God the Father, respecting Christ his only
begotten Son, who was constituted King of Sion, and (as it were) inaugurated to
the sacred Offices of Judge and Redeemer. See Act. 4.25, 26, 27. All those were
to be broken with and Iron Rod by Christ the Judge, who would not submit to the
Scepter of his saving Grace, Psalm. 45.6, 7. and 110.6. Esa. 2.3. but stubbornly
resisted him, and therefore by the Sword of his Anger (which is that Iron
Scepter or Rod) as of a severe Judge they were to be destroyed.

To this place of the Psalmist there seems to be an Allusion, Ezekiel. 21.10, 13.
Ezekiel. 21.10, 13. expounded
In our Translation, thus -- A Sword is sharpened to make a sore slaughter it is
furbished that it may glitter: Should we then make Mirth? It contemns the Rod
of my Son, as every tree (or as in the marginal reading,) the Rod of my Son
despises every Tree, and verse 13. -- What if the Sword contemn even the Rod?
etc. Where an obscure Periphrasis in the original Hebrew, has begot diverse
Interpretations -- What seems to me to be most proper and suitable I will lay
down, and submit it to the Judgment of the Godly and Learned.

1. It is certain that the Prophets do frequently cut off their speech,
introducing even in the very context, In cap. 8. Jerem.
then this, and then another speaking, upon which Jerome says, that the change
of persons, especially in the Writings of the Prophets, makes the Text
difficult to be understood; which, if delivered with a clearer distinction of
places, causes, and times, would render those things plain which seem to be
obscure, Nahum. 2. Hence the Prophets are so obscure, because when one thing is
treated of, there is suddenly a change to another thing or person. as Psalm.
2.1. The New Testament is introduced, as speaking and complaining of Christ's
Enemies (See Acts 4.24, 25. etc.) And verse 3. The Wicked themselves speak --
ver. 4. The Churches or the Psalmists words are set down, ver. 6. God the
Father speaks, ver. 7. God the Son; then again the Father, ver. 10. And then
the Royal Psalmist speaks the Conclusion.

Esa. 51.1. Jehovah is represented as speaking, ver. 3. The Prophet, ver. 4.
Jehovah again, ver. 9. The Prophet, ver. 12 Then Jehovah, and so on --
Something of the like nature may be observed, Esa. 53.1, 4, 14. And in the
whole Book of the Canticles, wherein there is a vicissitude and change of
Persons continued.

2. There are frequent Allusions in the Prophetical Writings to things written
by Divine Revelation before them, as shall be shew^^d, chap. 20. following.

3. In the very Text of Ezekiel. 21.27. He prophesies of Christ the Son of God, as
constituted a Judge by the Father, and in the stead of God attributes Judgment
and the power of Judging to him; as our Savior himself says, John 5.22. That
all Judgment was committed to him by the Father. These things presupposed the
explication of these words will not be difficult -- The Prophet declares the
vindicative Anger of God against the rebellious Jews, by the similitude of a
furbished and sharpened Sword delivered into the violent Enemies hand in order
to slay; but suddenly changing his speech, by the change of persons and
alluding to Psalm. 2.9. Thus speaks ver. 10. A Sword is sharpened to make a sore
slaughter, it is furbished that it may glitter, (so far the words of Jehovah,
to which a short but Divine Paraenesis (or exhortation) of the Prophets is
subjoyned, advising the people what they should do to avoid that destruction)
should we, or shall we then make mirth (that is, shall we vaunt proudly, let us
rather tremble, and submitting to and serving the Lord as enjoined, Psalm. 2.11.
Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with Trembling; let us rejoice and work
Rightousness, as true Conversion and Piety toward God is expressed, Esa. 64.5.
If you do this, it will be well, but if not says, Jehovah again) Virga filii
mei spernens omne lignum.
The Rod of my Son, despising every Tree, (so the Hebrew) [shall come upon you,
or (...), is at hand, as v. 13. And whereas it is said that this Rod despises
every tree, we are to understand that it consists of more lasting materials,
then any sort of Wood, being of Iron, which is very hard and difficult to be
broken, as Ps 2.9. See Esa. 30.32.] This, but more concisely, is laid down, v.
13. When there was a trial, what then? (as if he had said, whilst by my
castigations they were in a fatherly manner corrected, have they hitherto
repented? Or what effect has it produced? Even nothing at all) shall not
therefore a Rod despising ( viz. that Iron Rod despising, [or hard in
comparison of] all other wood) came upon them, (that is, shall I not deservedly
save that Iron Rod of my Son as a sharpened Sword amongst them, and so, rather
deal with them as open Enemies, then transgressing Children) says the Lord God.
So much for that place. But observe that as Ezekiel alludes to the second verse
of that Psalm in this place. So Esa. 13.14. Alludes to the later part, he shall
break it as the potters Vessel, etc. In alike description of punishment upon a
stubborn and refractory people.

CHAP. VIII. Of Metaphors Translated from other Creatures to God.
THE things existing in Nature besides Man are either Animate or Inanimate. The
Animate are such as have a sensitive Life, as Beasts, or a vegetative, as
Plants. From Beasts are taken and attributed to God.

1. Certain Names of Living Creatures, Lamb.
as when Christ is called a [Lamb] John 1.29. Rev. 13.8. Because he was made an
immolation or sacrifice for the sins of the whole World, which the sacrifice of
Lambs in the Old Testament Typically prefigured, 1 Cor. 5.7. 1 Pet. 1.16. Rev.
5.6. as also, with respect to his mildness, patience, innocence, and
beneficence, etc. See Esa. 16.1. 2 Samuel 8.2. with 2 Kings 3.4. etc.

Christ is called a [ Lyon] Rev. 5.5. Behold the Lion of the Tribe of Judah,
Lion.
has overcome. He is so called, because of his great and Divine Fortitude in
his Resurrection from the Dead, and his victory over the Devil, the World, and
Hell. D. Franzius, in Hist. Animal. page 73. Genesis 49.9. says -- Tota politia
Judaeorum dicitur leo and catulus leonis, propter summam firmitatem ipsi
Imperii, etc.
The whole Polity of the Jews is called a Lion, and a Lions whelp, because of
the great firmness of that Empire, which endured even until Christ's time, and
was esteemed then the most famous among the Governments of the World; and
although in some respective seasons they had Kings, eminent for Power and
Wisdom. Yet Christ only is called a Lion ((...) or) by way of eminency, that
is, he was the most powerful, most wise, and most excellent of the Kings, that
ever ruled in Juda, etc. And Drusius lib. 10. p. 410. The Lion of the Tribe of
Juda, whose Coat of Armor was a Lion, which was painted in the Banner of that
Tribe in three colors; with these words, Arise, O Lord, let such as hate thee
be scattered, and thine Enemies Fly from before thee, etc.

The Coats of Armor of the four principal Tribes of Israel, as R. Kimchi, on
Ezekiel. 1. ult. recites them from the Thalmud, were thus. In the Banner of Judah
the shape of a Lion, according to that which is written (Genesis 49.9.) Judah is a
Lions whelp. In the Banner of Reuben, the shape of a man, according to what is
said of it ( Genesis 30.14.) And Reuben found Mandrakes in the Field, which are of
a man's shape. In the Banner of Ephraim, the similitude of a Cow, according to (
Deuteronomy. 33.17.) His Glory is like the firstling of his Bullock or Cow. And in the
Banner of Dan, the shape of an Eagle, as it is said ( Genesis 49.17.) Dan shall be
a Serpent by the way, and it is said here (as Esa. 30.6.) The Viper and Fiery
Flying Serpent.

Psalm. 22. In the Title, Luther and other interpreters say, A Hind.
that Christ is called (...) Ascleth, the morning Hind; upon which see Luth.
Tom. 2. Lat. Jen. fol. 238. Illyricus in Clav. Script. Col. 112, 113. D.
Gerhard. Harm. histor. passionis Dominicae cap. 7. p. 310. D. Franz. Hist.
Animal. p. 163, etc. To which also some refer, the Chald. Paraphr. which says,
for thy Everlasting and Morning sacrifice, by which the end or reason for which
this afflicted Hind was slain, seems to be fairly expressed. For the Oblation
of Christ upon the Cross is truly an Everlasting and a most perfect sacrifice,
Heb. 10.12, 14, 26. It is called the Morning (Hind) because his virtue and
prefiguration, began about the beginning of the World after the fall of our
first Parents, Rev. 13.8. Hebr. 13.8. Typified by the Morning sacrifices wont
to be offered in the Old Testament, Numb. 28.4. The Appellation of a [ Morning
Hind] is thus expounded viz. By it is denoted a Hind, which the Hunters, in the
Morning when it goes abroad to feed, lie in wait for, take, and slay; so Christ
with his Disciples going abroad in Judea in the morning, season, that is, in
the beginning of his Kingdom, or the first beamings of his Divine and
Evangelical light, to the pastures of Life, (not so much to feed himself, as to
administer to others) was hunted by the Devils, and by their setting Dogs the
Jews, and his Apostles, being as Hinds dispersed, he was at last taken and
slain by them which seems to be intimated, ver. 16. For Dogs have compassed me,
the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me, they peirced my hands and my Feet.

To this phrase some apply the search that Herod made for him even in his
Infancy, and his being driven into Egypt, Matthew. 2.14, 15. And the gathering
together of the Chief Priests, Scribes and Elders of the People early in the
Morning to condemn Christ, as Mark. 15.1. And as the Morning Hind is not taken
and slain merely to destroy it, as Wolves are wont to be killed, but that it
may serve for pleasant food: So Christ in the sacrifice of his Cross and Death
becomes most sweet food of Life and Salvation for us, to be sacramentally and
spiritually eaten. Upon which Musculus says thus -- O Flesh of Christ truly
like that of a Hinds, but more exceedingly sweet to the faithful Soul, then any
things the Nobles of this World taste in their delights. And that there may be
nothing wanting to give it a delicate savor and relish, he was not merely
slain, but well turmoiled, hunted, and tired before, as our great men are wont
to do in hunting and agitating their Deer before they kill it, that the Flesh
may become more sweet, tender, and delicate* etc. Adding, and see how agreeable
this comparison is to the Death of Christ, for as the side of the pursued Hind
is exposed to the Hunters dart, Christ's side was upon the Cross pierced with a
spear.

Psalm. 22.6. Christ calls himself a [ Worm,] with respect to his debased state,
and the extreme contempt to which he was exposed in the World; A Worm.
Upon which Eranzius in the aforesaid Book, page 826. says, Sicut vermis
habetur pro vilissimo excremento, etc. As a Worm is accounted a most vile
excrement, which men will not so much as handle, or if they do will wash their
hands after it, and if they see them lie upon the Earth will remove them from
the sight of men -- So was Christ treated with extreme contempt, when he hung
upon the Cross.

It may not be amiss here to insert the paraphrase of De precipuis sidei
Myster. Tract 2. p. 256.
Weidnerus upon Prove. 30.19. Difficilia mihi sunt ista tria cognoscere: Viam
Aquilae in Coelo, h. e. Viam Christi ascendentis in caelum cum carne assumpta,
etc. Those three things are difficult for me to know: The way of an Eagle in
the Air, that is, the way of Christ ascending into Heaven, in his humane
Nature: The way of a Serpent upon a Rock, that is, the way of Christ from the
Cross to the Sepulcher, which was cut out of a Rock, and from whence he rose
the third day, whence Christ himself says, as Moses lifted up the brazen
Serpent, etc. The way of a Ship in the middle of the Sea, that is, the way of
Christ passing through the World in Tempests and Storms. The way of a man with
a Maid, that is, the way of Christ in his incarnation in the Womb of a Virgin,
etc. It is added, ver. 20. Of the way of an Adulterous Women, that is, the
Treacheries and Machinations of the Synagogue against Christ -- See Burgensis
upon Esa. 7. Addit. 5. fol. 21. What is spoken of the Eagle by Gregor. Nazianz
is accommodated to the Diety of Christ, Super Orat. 6. de spir. S.
which is ineffable, as D. Franzius cites it, page 327. etc.

2. Some Actions of Living Creatures, are ascribed to God.
To Roar.
AS [ Roaring,] which is the property of Lions, Joel 3.16. Amos 1.2. By which
the Power and Efficacy of his Anger, and his Word is intimated. See Amos 3.8.
Hosea. 11.10. Esa. 5.29. etc.

Upon which Illyricus says, it is a Metaphor, for as the voice of a Roaring
Lion is terrible to all other Living Creatures, so men ought to be moved and
tremble, when the Divine Majesty speaks to them from Heaven by Thunder and and
Lightning.

Jer. 25.30. The Lord shall Roar from on high, and utter his voice from his
Holy habitation, Roaring he shall Roar upon his habitation, that is, like a
Lion ready to seize upon his prey he shall thunder horribly. See ver. 38. In
all this speech to the end of the chapter, God is compared by an Allegory to a
Lion, Kings and Princes to Shepherds, the People to Flocks, and the Nations to
Pastures and Sheepfolds.

Job. 37.4. Roaring is applied to Thunder (which is called the voice of Cod.)
To the cry of Christ, Psalm. 22.1. Why art thou so far from my Salvation (or
helping me) and the words of my Roaring. See Heb. 5.7. and Psalm. 38.8.

God is said to [ Fly] 2 Samuel 22.11. Psalm. 18.10. To Fly:
Because of the most swift and impetuous motion of the Wind, and sudden
Tempests of which he there speaks. The Spirit of God is said in the first
Creation to move or rest upon the Waters, Genesis 1.2. While by its operative and
vital power it cherishes, and as it were made the waters apt for the production
of all things, (together with Heaven and Earth, which then were mixed together.)
A metaphor taken from Birds, who sit upon their eggs, Gram. Sacra. p. 299.
and by their vital heat bring their young to maturity and perfection.

Some Members or Parts of a Living Creature are ascribed to God.
AS [ the Horn of Salvation,] 2 Samuel 22.3. Ps. 18.2. To Christ, Luke 1.69. Horn.
For as a Horn defends Beasts, and thereby their strength is exercised; so God
is the most strong defense of the Godly. Chemnitius, on Luke 1.69. By the word
Horn strength and Power is understood, (as Psalm. 75.10. and 112.9. Lam. 2.3.)
By the word lifting up is described its solid strength and invincible
stability, against which even the Gates of Hell not prevail. It is called, the
Horn of Salvation, that is, it is salutiferous, obtaining victory against the
Enemy, and bringing safety to Captives, etc. As Bulls or Cows, strike, gore or
push down their Enemies, so we by Faith in the Mediator, are sufficiently armed
against the power of the Devil.

[ Wings] are attributed to God, by which that singular defense, patronage,
care, VVings.
and protection which he affords his people is signified, Psalm. 9.4. He shall
cover thee with his feathers, and under his Wings shall thou trust, whence it
is called the shadow of his Wings, Psalm. 17.8. and 36.7. and 57.1. and 63.7.
The Covert of his Wings, Psalm. 61.4. A metaphor taken from Birds or Fowl,
especially Hens, who gather their Chickens under them, cherish them, and
protect them from being seized upon, by Kites or other Birds of prey -- The
whole similitude is to be read, Deuteronomy. 32.11. Esa. 31.5. Matthew. 23.37. As to
Exodus 19.4. I bare you on Eagles Wings. See Gram. Sacr. p. 483.

There are some Metaphors taken from [ Plants,] and attributed to God, Plants.
A branch
as A [ Branch,] Esa. 4.2. Esa. 11.1. Jer. 23.5. and 33.15. Zach. 3.8. and
6.12. Which places by the Chald. Interpreter are elegantly expounded of Christ
the Messiah. Here principally his temporal Nativity or Pedigree according to
the Flesh is noted, as a Branch derives its original from the Earth, and having
that (as it were) for its Mother. It intimates also the greenness, felicity and
perpetuity of his Kingdom, as the Hebrew word ((...) germinavit, crevit,) he
has budded, grown, or increased is used of the Kingdom of Christ, and the
blessings thereof, Esa. 43.19. and 61.11, 12. Psalm. 85.11, 12. Zach. 6.12. The
Messiah is called the fruit of the Earth, Esa. 4.2. With respect also to his
Original as to his humanity, Psalm. 67.6. Then shall the Earth yield her
increase or fruit -- This whole Psalm treats of the blessings and benefits that
will accrue to believers from Christ.

Luke 23.31. Christ calls himself a Green-tree, opposing to himself a Dry-tree,
by which we are to understand the Wicked -- If they do these things in a
Green-tree, what shall be done in the Dry -- that is, if God suffers me, that
am innocent, and like a Green and Fruit bearing Tree, to be so grievously
afflicted, and cut down as a dry or barren-Tree, how much more grievously will
he permit you to be afflicted who are guilty persons, and sinners, and like dry
trees, that will bear no Fruit. Some by the tree of Life, Rev. 20.7 and 22.2,
14. understand Christ, others Life it self and Eternal happiness, which is
almost the same, that consisting solely in Christ, 1 John 5.11, 12, 20.

The Root of Jesse and David. In die Pasch. Sermon. 1.
Christ is called [ The Root of Jesse and David, Esa. 11.10. Romans 15.12. Rev.
5.5. and 22.16. Which some expound by a Metonymie, as the Root is put for that
which springs from the Root, as Esa. 11.1. Others say it is spoken with respect
to his Divinity, Bernard says, it is not said that David is his Root, but he
the Root of David, because he bears, and is not born by any. Fitly therefore O
Holy David do thou call thy Son, thy Lord, because you did not bear the Root,
but the Root, thee. Some derive the Reason of this appellation from these
Places, Esa. 14.30. I will kill thy Root with Famine, the Chald. renders it,
thy Son; the Septuagint, thy Seed: Mal. 4.1. He shall leave them neither Root
nor Branch, the Chald. renders it, neither Son nor Sons Son, or Nephew --
whence it appears that a Son, especially the first born, is as it were, the
Root of the Family, from whom such as are sprung, are like Branches. Hence the
Patriarchs, from whom the People of Israel sprung, and with whom God first
entered into Covenant are called a Root, and their posterity Branches, Romans
11.16. Christ is therefore called the Root of Jesse and David, because he is
that firstborn, Psalm. 89 27. (Also I will make him my firstborn higher then
the Kings of the Earth) issued (as to his humanity) from the family of Jesse
and David, and was the Foundation or Root of all the spiritual Family of God,
whence he is called the first born among many Brethren, Romans 8.29. Which Reason
seems to be hinted, Esa. 11.10 Where he is said to stand for an Ensign of the
People, to which the Gentiles shall seek by which the Call and Conversion of
that People is described, and the Constitution of the New Testament, Church
four fold, which is like a fruit bearing tree, standing upon Christ as a Root,
drawing Juice, Nourishment and Life from him.

A Vine.
Christ is called a [ Vine] John 15.1.5. By which metaphor, principally, his
most strict and close Union with his Disciples and all Believers is intimated,
hence they are called Branches ingrafted in him, verse 2, 4, 5. The Vine is
homogeneal, or of the same Nature with the Branches, so is Christ according to
his humanity with Believers, Ephesians. 5.30. Heb. 2.14. -- The Vine imbibes or
drinks in a copious humor, and plenty of moisture, which it after Communicates
to the Branches: So of the fullness of Christ we all receive grace for grace,
John 1.16. By a vital jujce derived from the Vine, the branches are animated,
vegetated and fertiliz'd, so as to bear sweet fruit: By the virtue of Christ
and his Spirit given to Believers they are inlivened, quickened, and made apt to
bear the fruits of Piety to God (which fruit cheareth God and Man, Judge. 9.13.)
but in the manner of this conjunction, there is a diversity or difference. For,
Branches grow upon the Vine naturally; but Believers are ingrafted in the true
Vine Spiritually, etc.

This is the primary Reason of this metaphor; but by way of inference other
things are intimated, viz. The meanness of the Vine, as to outward aspect,
Ezekiel. 15.2, 3. Quadrates very well with Christ in his state of Humiliation,
Esa. 53.2, 3. -- The dignity of the Vine, before other Plants, the delicate
smell of its flowers, and the excellency and preciousness of its fruit, etc.
with other things may be congruously applied to Christ the true and Celestial
Vine.

Christ is called A [Bundle of Myrrhe] Cant. 1.13. Of which, abundance grows in
Arabia; A Bundle of Myrrh
Myrrh is indeed bitter, but most fragrant, and of singular profit, in
cleansing and healing of VVounds, in expelling corrupt humors out of the Body,
in easing pains or griefs, in comforting the heart, and most effectual in
preserving the body from putrefaction. All which may be most fairly
accommodated and improved in paralells applied to our blessed Saviors passion,
most holy Merits, and their fruit and efficacy to the Saints when improved in
Faith.

Exodus 30.23. There is mention of the Myrrh of Liberty, (so the Hebrew) the
Chald. pure, incorrupt, our Version, pure Myrrh, of which was made the Holy
Ointment with which the chief Priests were wont to be Anointed -- Which
prefigured the Holy Unction of Christ, the Sacrifice of whose Death is that
Myrrh of Liberty, affording a heavenly deliverance from Satan, Death, Sin and
Hell, John 8.36. etc.

He is also called a [ Cluster of Camphire] Cant. 1.14. Bundle of Camphire.
This Tree is said to be odoriferous bearing Clusters of an exceeding
greatness, Plin. lib. 12. cap. 24. Some interpret it Cypress, for its
sweetness, fragrancy and plenty of glorious Fruit, which things also may be
attributed by way of improvement to Christ. Some Paraphrase it thus, Jesus is
Myrrh to me in his bitter passion, and a cluster of Camphire, in his glorious
Resurrection.

He is called the [ Rose (or flower) of Sharon,] and the Lilly of the Valleys,
Rose of Sharon.
by which his true humanity, his purity and sanctity, as also the amability of
his Office, and blessings he bestows are intimated, as shall be treated of
elsewhere more large. See D^^. D. Gerhard. Meditat. in Postilla Salomonea
Dominic. quinquages. fest. purific. 17. post tr. fest.

What Metaphors are deduced from inanimate things, in Nature, Things inanimate.
and transferred to God, do belong either universally, or severally to those
things. To the former Class belongs,

When there is a certain [ Dimension] ascribed to the Infinite and Unmeasurable
God, Dimensions.
and a comparison with this whole Universe, whereas betwixt Finite and
Infinite, there is properly no proportion, Job. 11.8. It is (viz. Jehovah) the
heights of Heaven, The Deeps (which is the perfection of God as ver. 7.) beyond
Hell, what can thou know? ver. 9. The Measure thereof (is) longer then the
Earth, and broader then the Sea: By which the infiniteness and immensity, of
God, and his Wisdom, is intimated, of which ver. 7. Can thou by searching
find out God? (others render it, can thou find out the Depth, viz. of the
Wisdom of God?) Can thou find out to the perfection of the Almighty (others
say, can thou find out the end of Almighty Wisdom.) To this belongs that
Sacred Mathematical expression of Paul, speaking of the Love of God and our
Savior Christ, Ephesians. 3.18. That ye may be able to comprehend with all Saints,
what is the breadth, the length, Ephesians. 3.18. latitude, longitude profundity,
sublimity.
and depth and height, viz. Of the Love of Christ, as verse 19. Which passes
knowledge, showing by an Anthropopathy, the unmeasurableness and immensity of
that Love, as if he had said, it is higher then the Heavens, deeper then the
Sea, larger then the Earth, longer then any time, enduring even to all Eternity
-- Upon which place Osiander says, the sense is, I pray God that ye may be able
with other sincere Christians, after a certain manner to comprehend the
unmeasurable Love of Christ toward you, which, that I may use a Metaphor,
extends it self to all Dimensions. And Hyperius in his Comment very excellently
-- The sense is (says he) My prayer is that you may have a full, certain, and
absolute knowledge of the Love of Christ in all its parts. Geometricians are
wont to observe these differences of Dimensions, when they inquire into the
magnitude of solid Bodies. Such therefore as belong to coporeal things, the
Apostle artificially compares with things incorporeal and spiritual; and
signifies that he earnestly desires that they should arrive to an equal
certainty and perfection in the knowledge of spiritual things, chiefly of the
Love of Christ, as Mathematicians do in the measure of solid bodies, etc.

Here we are to note, that when Magnitude is attributed to God, not the
quantity of a corporeal or bodily size and bigness, but the very infiniteness
of his Essence, and essential proprieties is to be understood, Exodus 15.16. and
18.11. Numb. 14.19. Deuteronomy. 3.24. Exodus 5.8. Psalm. 48.1, 2. and 147.4, 5. Jer.
32.17, 18, 19. Dan. 2.45. Mal. 1.14. etc. Job. 33.12. There is a comparison of
God with man, (with respect to greatness -- whereby the unsearchable Immensity
of God is intimated, (as if he had said) God, not only in Majesty and Power,
but also in Truth, Justice, Wisdom and Mercy, infinitely excells all Mortals,
therefore thy presumption is unjust to contend with him.

1 John 3.20. It is said that God is greater then our Hearts, when the Speech
is of a guilty Conscience, as if he had said, if Conscience, which in many is
blind, convinces us of Hypocrisy, how much will God, who is the greatest of
all things, and infinite in knowledge charge us in his Judgment. 1 John 4.4.
God is said to be greater then him that is in the World, that is, Antichrist,
as ver. 3. Whom believers by the power of the infinite and invincible God,
dwelling by grace in them, do overcome.

John 10.29. God is said to be greater then all, that is, that he (beyond
comparison) excells the whole Universe in Power and Majesty.

By the same reason a discretive quantity, or plenty, is ascribed to God, as
Psalm. 86.15. (...) much (or plentiful) in Mercy and Truth, Psalm. 103.8. Great
(or plentious) in Mercy, Psalm. 130.7. With him is plenteous Redemption, by
which is noted the infiniteness of God and his attributes, as it is described,
Psalm. 147.5. Great is our Lord, and of great Power, and of his understanding
(there is) no number -- So the Hebrew. See Psalm. 36.6. Romans 11.33. 1 Cor. 2.1.

In [Speaking] of things inanimate severally, we will distribute them, 1. Into
things Celestial. And, 2. Things Elementary.


To the first kind belongs when God is said to look down from Heaven, and sit
in, or inhabit Heaven, as his Throne. Of which before.

Light.
Also when God is called [ Light] 1 John 1.5. By which his Majesty, Holiness,
Perfection, and Blessedness is noted, as when celestial Light is transmitted to
us, there is nothing Fairer, Clearer, Purer, or more comfortable, whence it is
said, Eccl. 11.7. Truly the Light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
Eyes to behold the Sun. The Greeks had an Adagy or Proverb (...), dulce lumen
solis, sweet is the Light of the Sun.

1 Timothy ^^.16. God is said to dwell in ((...),) lucem inaccessibilem,
inaccessible or unapproachable Light, or as our English Translation renders it,
The Light which no man can approach unto, that is, to act with, that Glory,
Majesty, and Felicity, which no Creature either can have, or comprehend. Upon
which Chrysostom. Hom. 3. de incomprehens. Dei Not.
says, The Apostle says that God dwells i^^ inaccessible Light, which is more
then if he had said incomprehensible, for that which by inquiry and search we
cannot find out, we call incomprehensible, but that which prohibits all essay
of search, and to which none can come near we call inaccessible.

Some with inaccessible Light, compare an opposite phrase, where the difficulty
of fully knowing God in his Majesty and Essence is described by his dwelling in
Mists and Clouds; for every corporeal Light, which for its exceeding brightness
cannot be beheld, may be truly styled a Mist, and therefore inaccessible, etc.

To this is referred, where God, Jam. 1.17. is called the Father of Lights,
with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning; in which phrase is denoted
his essential Majesty, and Immutability in acting. Some (and very fitly) judge
that the phrase [ Father of Lights] is a Periphrasis of the Sun, attributed to
God, (...) or after the manner of men: For as that super-celestial Sun is
distinguished from the corporeal, and visible Sun, it is added, that with him is
no variableness, nor shadow of turning. When the Sun is in the opposite
Hemisphere it leaves ours darkened and obscure, which vicissitude of darkness
and light agrees not with God; for he is never the Cause of Sin and Death
(which are noted by the term darkness) but always the Authors of Good and Life
(noted by the term Light) and this is the scope of the Apostle, as ver. 13. Let
no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: For God cannot be tempted
of evils, neither tempts he any man, etc.

Salmeron upon the words, says, in the words, (...), (viz shadow of turning,)
he alludes to the Sun, which by a certain vicissitude, and declination of it
self from one Tropic to the other, begets shadows of a different size, and the
nearer it is to us, the greater are the shadows; but these vicissitudes are not
compatible with God -- But the first interpretation is more conformable to the
Apostles scope.

From this Denomination of Light attributed to God, with respect to his Essence
and Majesty, the Son of God is called (...), The splendour (or brightness) of
the Glory of God, Heb. 1.3. The primary reason of this appellation is, in
respect of the heavenly Father, from whom he, by ineffable generation (as it
were) shined from Eternity, Ut in Niceno symbolo est, as in the Nicene Creed
as Light does from Light: For (...), signifies, a shining again, or a
resplendency, as it were from the Sun beams; and so by the force of the
proposition, his Eternal Original from the Father is indicated or shown.
Brightness cannot be separated from the Sun, and is of equal age with it; so,
from the Father of Lights, (of whom on Jam. 1.17. we have spoke) this
brightness, viz. the Son, can never be separated, because coeternal with him,
John 14.10. Lyranus, thus expresses himself, The Son proceeds from the Father,
as Light or splendour from the Sun: Which splendour is of the same Age with the
Sun, and would be Eternal, if the Sun were Eternal.

A secundary reason may be in respect of men, and that manifestation which the
heavenly Father made to us by the Son. The Light of the Sun is sent on the
Earth to cherish, vegetate, and render it fruitful; Christ the brightness of
the Fathers Glory is sent to illuminate, vivifie, and save us.

God is said to be a Light and a Sun, with respect to his energy, or power and
operation amongst men, Psalm. 27.1. The Lord is my Light, that is, who gives the
true and saving Light of his Spirit unto me, where the Psalmist exegetically
(or by way of exposition) adds* The Lord is the strength of my Life. Psalm.
84.12. The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield, the exposition is annexed; The Lord
will give Grace and Glory, no good (thing) will he withhold from them that walk
uprightly, Esa. 10.17. And the Light of Israel shall be for a Fire, and his
Holy One for a Flame; that is, God shall illustrate, and sanctify the
Israelites. From hence arise those different phrases, wherein the Light of God
signifies,

(1.) His Favor and Grace, as when his Face is said to shine, Numb. 6.25 Psalm.
80.3. etc. Or,

(2.) His Saving Revelation of Light and Truth by the Word, Psalm. 43.3. Send
out thy Light and thy Truth, let them lead me, etc. Psalm. 67.1. Let God cause
his face to shine upon us; which is meant of the revelation of his way and
Doctrine, as ver. 2. See Psalm. 19.8. Prove. 6.15. 2 Cor. 4.4, 6. etc. Or,

(3.) Or Eternal Glorifying, as Esa. 60.19, 20. The Lord shall be to thee an
Everlasting Light, which Rev. 22.5. is applied to Eternal Life.

In General, The Light of God is to be taken with reference to some Celestial
benefits, as Psalm. 36.9. In thy Light shall we see Light, where the preceding
and following words show, the sense to be, that by the Grace of God manifested
in his Word, we come to true blessedness. By the Light of God here Galatinus
says, lib. 8. cap. 11. and Drusius lib. 15. observat. cap. 4. That some ancient
Rabbis understood the Messiah.

Hence we come to our Savior, who is particularly called the Light and Sun,
not with respect to his Divine Essence, and Person as distinct from the Father,
as before, but with respect to his office, benefits, and operations, Esa. 9.2.
and 42.6. and 49.6. and 60 1. Matthew. 4.16. Luke 2.32. John 1.4.9. and 3.19. and
8.12. and 12.35, 36. Act. 13.47. The Metaphor of [ Light] in Scripture
expresses information, whereby the darkness of the understanding is dispelled,
as also a taking away of Sin, (which is compared to Darkness, and a giving of
Comfort, all which our Savior most eminently exhibits from himself to
Believers.

Concerning the Appellation of [ Sun,] these two places are most eminent.

(1.) Mal. 4.2. But unto you that fear my Name, Mal 2.4. The Sun of
Righteousness. Sun.
shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in his Wings. That this is
spoke of our Savior Christ, plainly appears from the scope and context of the
Prophet* See chap. 3.1, 2, 3. and chap. 4.5. With Matthew. 11.10. and 17.11, 12,
13. Luke 1.17. etc. For there is a most fair and sweet comparison betwixt
Christ and the natural Sun. As,

(1.) With respect to Oneness -- There is but one Sun, which is the Eye of the
World, which is enough to enlighten and cherish all -- So there is but one
Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus, 1 Timothy 2.5.

(2.) That Sun only shines by its own Light, and communicates brightness to the
Moon and Stars, -- So Christ is the Fountain of true Light, illuminating the
Church, and Teachers of his word (which are compared to Stars, Rev. 1.20.) with
his own proper Light.

(3.) As there is but one Sun which excels and illuminates the inferior
luminaries of Heaven; so Christ has the pre-eminence ((...)) over all, Col.
1.18.

1. With respect to Efficacy; for as the Sun chaces away darkness and clouds,
illustrating all things: So Christ dispels the darkness of the mind, by the
Light of his Word; the darkness of sinners, by the light of his most Holy
Merits; and the darkness of calamity, by the light of his comforting Grace.

2. With respect to Equality, for the Sun rises on the Evil and the Good,
(affording its light without distinction to all things sublunary) Matthew 5.45.
which nevertheless blind men, and such as Sleep by day, do not enjoy: So Christ
illuminates every man that comes into the World, (that is, he affords the
means of illumination,) 1 John 1.9. Yet unbelievers, who are blinded by the
Devil, and such as give themselves the liberty to sleep securely in sin (and
that by their proper, fault and particular vice) John 3.19. and 2 Cor. 4.4. Do
not enjoy that saving light or illumination; which is the reason why the
Prophet Malachy speaking of the actual illumination of the Sun of
Righteousness, says, -- To them that fear the Name of the Lord shall the Sun of
Righteousness arise, etc.

3. No man can resist or hinder the course and efficacy of the Sun: So no
Devil, or Tyrant can retard or hinder the course and energy of the Gospel of
Christ, the Sun of Righteousness.

4. The Sun refreshes and quickens the World by its heat, which nature
demonstrates in the Spring: So Christ quickens and makes alive those that are
spiritually Dead, Ephesians. 2.5. and causes a Divine heat of Love and Devotion, Luke
24 32.

5. That which the Prophet mentions, by the phrase [ with healing in his Wings]
is to be understood of the first beams or rays of light called the Wings of the
morning, (or the first appearance of the Sun) Psalm. 139.9. that is, the first
Sun beams -- This celestial Sun is also a Physician which can heal and deliver
from spiritual Death. The Sun when it rises gives some ease and comfort to sick
persons, let all that are soul sick rejoice in this justifying and healing Sun
of Righteousness.

6. The Sun rising causes Joy to all things, who were (as it were) immersed in
the Melancholy sadness of night as the Poet says, Phosphore read diem, quid
gaudia nostra Moraris?
Come sweet Phospher bring the Day,
Why do thou our Joys delay.


So by this heavenly Sun of Righteousness, true cause of Joy is given unto men,
Luke 2.10, 11. Esa. 9.2, 3.

7. The Sun does make all sorts of Earthly fruit Ripe, to which it also gave
the beginning of vegetation -- So Christ is the Author and finisher of our
Faith, Heb. 12.2. He works in us to will and to do, Phil. 2.13. That we may
walk worthy of the Lord, unto all well pleasing, being fruitful unto every good
work, and increasing in the knowledge of God, Col. 1.10.

8. It is said of the Heliotrope, (an herb so called) that it always turns and
inclines to the Sun: So let our hearts always incline to Christ.

9. There is nothing more pleasant to those in Captivity then to behold the
Sun: So there is nothing ought to be more comfortable to us in our spiritual
Captivity, then by the Eyes of Faith to behold Christ the Sun of Righteousness,
etc.

The Second place is, Luke 1.78. 2. Luke 1.78.
Through the Bowels of the Mercy of our God (so the Greek) whereby the
dayspring from on high, has visited us -- Some think that this metaphorical
appellation, (viz. (...), oriens ex alto) arising from on high, is taken from
Plants which are said ((...)) to branch or spout forth, when they grow, or
begin to flourish, that so it might respect those places of the Old Testament,
where Christ is called a Plant and Branch, Jer. 23.5. Zach. 3.8. and 6.12.
Where the Septuagint render (...) by (...), orientem arising, and that we are
to understand here, the arising, or Branch from on high, sent from heaven to
us, and widely differing from all Earthly branches. But the words immediately
following show that Zachary had respect rather to the similitude of the Sun and
light, as verse 79. of this place, viz. (...), to give light to them that sit
in darkness, and in the shadow of Death, to guide [as a clear light does] our
feet into the ways of peace. By a good reason it is therefore said, that the
Holy man respected the Prophecy, Esa. 9.2. (whence the phrase of sitting in
the darkness and shadow of Death is taken) and chap. 60.1, 2. Mal. 4.2. To
which places Junius (Parallel. 1, 55.) does learnedly show that he had
immediate reference.

(...), oriri, to arise, is proper to the Sun, Moon and Stars, from whence the
Noun, (...), that is, an arising, or the action or Region of the orient Sun,
and Metonymically it is put for the rising Sun it self -- to which is, (...)
from on high, for distinction sake is added, by which Junius says, we are to
understand that meridian and powerful spendor whereby the Sun (chiefly at Noon)
illustrates all things, to difference it, (...), from its first uprising. But
it seems to be referred more truly to the first original of the Sun of
Righteousness, viz. His visiting (and shining upon) us on Earth, and that from
on high, viz. Heaven, as 1 Cor. 15.47. John 3.31.

That the Messiah is called a [ Star,] Numb. 24.17. is the Judgment of many,
Star.
there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel,
which words are thus rendered by the Chaldee, there shall arise a King out of
Jacob, and the Messiah shall be exalted out of Israel, etc. The same exposition
Galatinus lib. 8. cap. 1. produces from R. Salomo, and R. Moses Hadarsan.
Vatablus, paraphrases the whole verse thus -- O Balak, my Counsel is that you
be quiet, and fear not at this time, for that which I foretell of things to
come, shall not come to pass in thy time, but in the latter days, viz. in the
time of the Messiah, whom I see, but not near me, for he is yet afar off, when
he comes, he will be as a great light and vehement splendour, which is signified
by the Star, etc. So says Brentius. Junius and Tremellius in their notes say,
that by the Name of a Star and Scepter is meant the Kingdom of Gods people,
begun in David, and completed in Christ, between whom, the interjected time
was the progress of the Star, etc. See Junius in analyt. explic. h. l.

Such as understands this Prophecy of Christ, paraphrase it in this manner, [
I shall see him, but not now, I shall behold him but not nigh,] that is, my
Curses will be in vain against that People, whom God has peculiarly chosen for
himself, and from which according to the Flesh the Messiah is to descend, but
the time of that Nativity is not yet come, therefore I seem to behold him at a
great distance, but that promise will be certainly fulfilled, and God for his
sake will preserve this Kingdom so long [ there shall come a Star out of Jacob]
that is, the Son of God, manifested in the Flesh shall come of this people, and
shall spread the beams of his Doctrine and Miracles far and near, arising as
the Day Star in the hearts of Believers, 2 Pet. 1.19. Enlightening them to
Eternal Life [ and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel] that is the Messiah
shall not only be a Teacher of his people, but also a heavenly King [ and he
shall smite through the Princes of Moab, and destroy all the Children of Seth]
that is, all such as will not obey his Government, but remain unbelievers, he
shall destroy with an Eternal Death, [ ver. 18. And Edom shall be a possession,
Seir shall be a possession for his Enemies] that is, all his Enemies (who by
the Idumeans, the capital Enemies of Israel, inhabiting Seir are set forth)
shall be destroyed by the Sword of the Spirit [ but Israel shall do valiantly]
that is the Church, which is the Kingdom of the Messiah, shall be gloriously
triumphant, [ ver. 19. out of Jacob shall come he that shall have Dominion, and
shall destroy him that remains of the City] that is, he shall rule in the
House of Jacob for ever, and of his Kingdom there will be no end, Luke 1.33. He
shall put all his Enemies under his feet, 1 Cor. 15.25, 26, 27. etc.

Christ calls himself [ The bright and Morning Star] Rev. 22.16. Because of
those shinings of saving knowledge which proceed from him, Morning Star. Rev.
22.16.
whence he is (...). The light bringer (usually Translated Morning Star, or
day-dawn) arising, in the hearts of men by the sure word of Prophecy. But more
especially because of his promise of Life and Salvation: For as the Morning
Star is as it were the Suns harbinger, declaring its speedy approach; so by the
clearness of Christ's Resurrection, and his sure word or promise, he discovers
unto men what an extraordinary light of Glory will be afforded to Believers in
the general Resurrection, when they shall shine as Stars for ever, Dan. 12.3.
The Morning Star gives light, but much less then the Sun; so the light of the
knowledge of Christ in this Life, is not to be compared with that most
illustrious and shining Glory, which the Saints shall enjoy in bliss, and which
by Faith they expect, 1 Cor. 13.12.

Fire.
Secondly, Elementary things. God is called [ Fire] yea, a consuming Fire, Deuteronomy.
4.24. and 9.3. and 32.22. Esa. 10.17. and 66.15, 16. Ezekiel. 21.31. etc. Which
denotes his Wrath against sin, which consumes those miserable persons, against
whom it burns, as Fire does stubble. See Psalm 18.8. Where by smoke also the
Wrath of God is signified, as also Psalm. 74.1. and Psalm. 80.4. How long will thou smoke against thy People? (so the Hebrew) Deuteronomy. 29.20.

A Lamp.
God is said to be [ A Lamp] Candle or Lanthorn, when he exhibits his grace and
favor to any, 2 Samuel 22.29. Thou art my Lamp, O Lord, Psalm. 18.28. For thou will light my Candle (or Lamp) the Lord my God will enlighten my Darkness; that
is, he is the author of my light, felicity, and Salvation. So the Candle of God
is said to shine upon Jobs head, Job 29.3. in the same sense, as the following
words show, viz. By his light I walked through darkness, where he subjoyns a
clear description of his former felicity.

Prove. 20.27. The Spirit of man is the Candle of the Lord, searching all the
inward parts of the Belly, that is, the Lord kindles a light in man, by which
he looks into the most inward things; and therefore it shines in the mind of a
wise King, that he may search out a matter, and take away the wicked, Prove.
25.2, 3. The Word of God is called a Lamp, or Candle, Psalm. 119.105. Prove.
6.23. 2 Pet. 1.19. Because of the light of saving institutions which it
exhibits to Believers.

To the Element of [ Ayr] belongs, when [ Blowing,] or a Blast, or Breathing is
attributed to God, A Blast or Blowing.
by which his Divine Grace and Refection, is noted, as a cool breeze refreshes
a man in Summers heat -- thus some aptly translate that passage, Esa. 57.16.
For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth, the Spirit
before me shall roll it self, and I will cause a Blowing, that is, the Holy
Spirit, which I will send to sorrowful and contrite Believers, shall (as it
were) open it self to them, dwell in them, and in the heat of Temptations,
shall with a comfortable gust or breeze refresh their fainting Spirits.

Sometimes it denotes Divine Wrath and vengeance, as a strong Wind overthrows
what is before it, and inflames the Fire, Job 4.9. By the Blast of God they
perish (that is, the wicked) and by the breath of his Nostrils are they
consumed, Psalm. 18.15. At thy rebuke, O Lord, at the Blast of the breath of thy
Nostrils, Esa. 30.33. The breath of the Lord, like a stream of Brimstone does
kindle it, that is, Hell, as brimstone is a great nourisher of Fire, so the
infinite and never ceasing Wrath of God, shall be (as it were) an Eternal
nourisher or continuer of Hell; for whilst a pair of Bellows blow the Fire, it
burns; so the breath of the Lord, ( viz. his Wrath) shall be always of efficacy
to torment the souls and bodies of the damned in that infernal stream of
brimstone.

To the Element of Water belongs where God is called a Fountain of Living
Waters, Jer. 2.13. and 17.13. Water. Fountain
Because he is the indeficient Author of all Life and refreshment, here and
hereafter. Psalm. 36.9. With thee is the Fountain of Life, which is to be
understood in the same sense, which verse 8. is called the River of his
Pleasures. The Spirit is called a River of living Water, John 7.38, 39. to
which belongs the expressions of pouring out, Esa. 44.3. Joel 3.1. Zach. 12.10.
Act. 2.16, 17, 18, 33. Tit. 3.5, 6.

Christ in general calls the blessings derived to men through him, living
water, John 4.10, 14. For he is that most abounding Fountain of Eternal Life,
John 1.16. Water cleanses, refreshes, quenches thirst, softens or mollifies,
etc. which with other good qualities, may be most fitly ascribed to the blessed
Savior in a Spiritual sense. See Esa. 55.1. Ezekiel. 36.25. Zach. 14.8. Psalm.
23.1, 2. etc.

The Heavens or Clouds are called the River of God full of water, Psalm. 65.9.
Because he sends plenty of Rain from thence to make the Earth fruitful.

To the [ Earth. Earth.
] we will refer whatsoever (besides what was produced before in their proper
places) have a being in it, that are metaphorically transferred to God, whether
they be natural productions, or made by humane Art.

Christ is sometimes called a [ Stone] and [ Rock,] as Psalm. 118.22. A Stone.
Rock.
The Stone which the builders refused, is become the head of the corner, which
expressly referred to Christ, Matthew. 21.42. Act. 4.11. 1 Pet. 2.7. By the
Builders we are to understand the Priests and Great men, and others among the
Israelites, whose office it was to build, not destroy the Church of God. How
these refused Christ, the Evangelical History plentifully informs us; yet
notwithstanding he is made the head of the Corner, or the firm and chief corner
stone of the whole Church fitly framed together, and growing in him, Ephesians. 2.20,
21. To Wit both of Jews and Gentiles, having broken down the partition wall,
verses 14, 15, 16, etc. Other places, are, Esa. 8.14. and 28.16. Zach. 3.9.
Luke. 2.34. Romans 9.32, 33. 1 Pet. 2.4, 6, 7, 8. Where he is called a Rock of
offense, and a stumbling Stone, with respect to unbelievers and wicked men,
etc. who are apt to despise his mean worldly estate, and be offended at his
severity against their sinful ways.

God is called a Rock to such as trust in him, Deuteronomy. 32.31. Psalm. 18.2. Psalm.
31.2, 3. Psalm. 42.9. and 73.26. Esa. 26.4. that is, a most certain and
invinsible giver of help; for there were Rocks in those Countries which for
their height, strength, steepyness and difficulty of access were reputed
impregnable, etc.

Matthew. 16.18. Christ alluding to the name of Peter calls himself that Rock
upon which he was to build his Church, that the Gates of Hell should not
prevail against it -- Upon which Brentius very well paraphrases. I have called
thee Cephas before, that is, a Rock, (John 1.43.) and I do not yet repent for
giving thee that title; for now in your own and Brethrens name, you acknowledge
the true Rock and Foundation, in confessing, that I am Christ the Son of the
living God -- This Confession, is the true Rock, and upon it, as upon a Rock
and Foundation, will I build my Church.

D. Calixtus, says, that the words, the Church is built upon a Rock are said by
a metaphor, which is taken from the firmness, strength or solidity of the Rock,
not from any Rule or Government it has, for there is no such thing in it, and
denotes a solid, steadfast and immovable Foundation; but what needs any further
explication, when Paul an undoubted interpreter says, 1 Cor. 3.11. For other
Foundation can no man lay, then that is laid, which is Jesus Christ, but upon
this Rock, are laid other Rocks, or Stones, (for (...), being an appellative
signifies a Stone, not a Rock) cut out of the Living Rock, which being single
are not foundations, but many being joined, cemented, or united, constitute or
make a secundary foundation, Rev. 21.14. And the wall of the City had twelve
Foundations, and in them the Names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb, Ephesians.
2.20. And are built upon the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, etc.

1 Cor. 10.4. Christ is called the spiritual Rock, of which the Israelites did
drink in the Desert, that Rock being a Type of him, Exodus 17. See Gram. Sacr.
p. 504.551.

God is called a Secret or [Hiding place] Psalm. 91.1. Psalm. 119.114. also a
Covert, Hiding place.
Refuge, or Hiding, Esa. 4.6. By which his gracious defense against all hostile
violence is intimated. For the same Reason he is called a [ Munition] (which
signifies a Fortification, Munition or Fortress.
or Strong-Hold) Psalm. 31.2, 3, 4. Psalm. 71.3. Psalm. 91.2, 9. Psalm. 144.2.

He is called a [ Wall of Fire] Zach. 2.5. Where the Epithete of Fire is added,
Wall of Fire.
to show, that he is not only the defender of his Church, but also a most
terrible avenger, that will consume its Enemies, as Fire does combustible
matter.

Strong Tower.
He is called a [ Strong Tower,] Psalm. 61.3. Prove. 8.10. Because of his Divine
protection also; for as in high and well fortified Towers we are safe from the
assaults of the Enemy; so much more eminently does Jehovah place them in
safety, who trust in him, 2 Samuel 22.51. He is the Tower of Salvation, (says
David of God) which is called great deliverance, Psalm. 18.50. The Tower is
Fortified.

1. With warlike Engines, which are his Divine virtue and power, and all the
Creatures which he makes use of to the Destruction and overthrow of his
Enemies, Psalm. 148.8. Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapor, stormy Wind fulfilling his
Word.

2. With Provision, as the Bread and Drink of Life, Psalm. 36.8, 9, 10. They
shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house, and thou shall
make them Drink of the Rivers of thy Pleasures, etc.

3. With a Garrison or brave Defendants, which are the Holy Angels, Psalm.
91.12. Dan. 7.10. So that this Tower is impregnable, etc.

Temple.
The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are called the Temple of the Heavenly City,
Rev. 21.22. By way of opposition to the outward and Earthly Temple, as if he
had said, in Eternity there will be no need of those visible and external
signs, by which God manifested himself to his people under the Old Testament
dispensation, in the Temple and in the Ark of the Covenant; for God will
exhibit himself to be seen by his elect face to face, that in this spiritual
Temple they may give him Eternal and Celestial praise, celebrating a festival
of Everlasting Joy, etc.

Way.
John 14.6. Christ calls himself the [ Way -- ] viz. by which there is a passage
to the Father, as ver. 2, 3, 4. The words of the verse are I am the Way, and
the Truth, and the Life, no man comes unto the Father but by me, that is, you
say you know not the way to the Father, and heavenly felicity, why, I my self,
whom you know, am the Way, by which you can arrive there, nor am I only a way,
but a guide also, by the Truth which I teach, and together with the Father, am
the end of your Journey, that is, Life, which the blessed enjoy. Calixt in
Harmon. Evangel.

John Husse (as VVolfius cites him, Tom. 1. lect. Memor. p. 750.) says, Let the
humble passenger behold Christ, who says I am the Way, the Truth and Life, here
is a way for him that will go, for Christ is the way: A way whither he would
go, for Christ is Truth: And where he would tarry, for Christ is Life.

Tho. a Kempis lib. 3. de Imit. Christi, cap. 56. I am the way, Truth and Life,
none can Go without a Way, nor Know without Truth, nor Live without Life. I am
the way which you ought to follow, the truth which you ought to believe, and
the life which you ought to hope for. I am the inviolable way, the infallible
Truth, and indeterminable Life. I am the most right way, the most supreme
truth, and most certain blessed and increated life -- If thou tarry in my way,
thou shall know my truth which shall deliver thee, and in it thou shall find
Eternal life. The light and truth of God leads us, Psalm. 43.3. Which Christ
applies to himself, John 8.12. and 14.6. For he leads us to himself who is
Eternal Life, 1 John 5.11, 12. In whom we have all things, Romans 8.32. How he
leads to the Father is fairly expounded, Heb. 10.19, 20. etc.

1. The Way of the Lord God signifies his heavenly Doctrine, Psalm. 5.8. Psalm.
25.4, 9, 10. Psalm. 67.2. Psalm. 119.3, 14, 2^^, 30. etc. Esa. 2.3. Hos. 14.10.
Matthew. 22.16. Act. 13.10. and 18.25. etc. Hence comes the phrase to keep the
ways of the Lord, Psalm. 18.21. that is, to lead his life according to his Word
and precepts.

2. His Providence and Divine Government, more generally as the whole Course of
his Will, Counsels, Endeavors, and Actions, as Psalm. 25.10. Psalm. 77.13. Esa.
55.8, 9. Hab. 3.6.

More particularly it signifies some singular actions of God, Exodus 33.13.
Psalm. 103.7. Job 40.14. Prove. 8.22. John Baptist is said to prepare the way of
the Lord, Mal. 3.1. Luke 1.76. that is, to bear a serious Testimony of his
speedy coming, by preaching the Word, and administering the Holy Ordinance of
Baptism -- A metaphor taken from great men, at whose coming the ways are wont
to be made plain and level. See Esa. 40.3, 4. etc.

God is called a [Shade] Psalm. 121.5. The Lord is thy Shade upon thy right
hand, A Shade or Shadow.
which denotes his heavenly protection, which he affords believers, as a Shade
refreshes and defends from the scorching heat of the Sun; hence such are said
to abide under the Shadow of the Almighty, Psalm. 91.1. When it is said the
Shadow of his VVings the metaphor becomes double and more emphatical, for he is
not only a pleasant Shade in dry and torrid places, but such a nourishing,
protecting Shade as the Hens wings are to her Chickens; and so denotes a
singular Love and Care.

We read also of the Shadow of Gods hand, which also denotes a strong
protection against all Enemies, for a hand when attributed to God denotes so
much. Of which before.

There is an eminent emphasis in that Text, Luke 1.35. Luke 1.36. expounded
And the Angel answering and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon
thee, and the power of the Highest shall over shadow thee, (...). Mary being
astonished by the view of that Angelical Messenger, enquired ver. 34. How shall
this be, seeing I know not man? viz. what was said ver. 31. And behold thou
shall conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son, and shall call his Name
Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the highest, etc. ver.
32. To Mary wondering at this, the Angel answers, that it should be by the
supernatural, and most singular operation of the Holy Spirit and Highest power,
which operation is by an Anthropopathy expressed by overshadowing, describing
the manner of, as that there should be Divine protection, which is the
metaphorical signification of a shadow, as before. For God being a consuming
Fire, would consume Mary, by filling her with his peculiar and Majestical
Glory, unless there were some Divine obumbration or Shade between; as God
covered Moses with his hand in that peculiar and extraordinary appearance of
his Divine Glory, lest by the dazzling and Majesty of Gods presence he should be
consumed, Exodus 33.22. It may also respect that hidden formation of that most
Holy child in the Virgins Womb, and his being secured from the least spot of
sin, in his most admirable union with humanity.

This Emphasis the word ( Shadow) carries which being contrary to light is a
note of the incomprehensible and hidden energy of God -- intimated also by the
Shadow of a Cloud over the Tabernacle, Exodus 40.35. Let this Shade therefore be
a prohibition from any rash or curious inquisitiveness into this adorable
Mystery. The Cloud was put over the Tabernacle, that we should not rashly rush
in, and the Cherubims covered the Ark, 2 Chronicles. 5.8. Lest any body should be
curiously prying into the Majesty of God which dwelt upon it: So the Shadow of
the highest, obumbrates this Mystery, lest our foolish Reason should be
inquisitive into the manner of it. And so with a shadow of imperfect Revelation
of these Divine things, we end this Chapter.

CHAP. IX. Of Metaphors whereby Things are proposed as Persons, which are not
Persons, which kind they call Prosopopeia.
PROSOPOPEIA is, when any thing (which is not a person) is metaphorically
introduced or proposed as a person: Or when the properties of a man are
attributed to other things, for things, for likeness and agreements sake --
Profane Authors use very elegant metaphors of this kind, as that of Cicero --
What did that drawn Sword of your do in the Pharsalian Field? Whose side did
that point seek? What was the sense of your Arms. Aristotle defines this
metaphor -- that which is in act, bringing in inanimate things doing something,
as if they had life and sense -- But we will follow the distinct Classes of
Scripture Examples.

Some things are said of the Members of a Humane Body, which is properly the
act of the mind, (...)
as Genesis 48. He made his hands to understand, (so the Hebrew) that is, (as
Vatablus and our Translation notes) he guided or laid his hands knowingly,
skilfully and wittingly, when his eyes were dim with age, that he could not
discern by seeing, which was the Eldest Son, therefore of set purpose did he
lay his hands crosswise; and therefore Moses says, that he made his hands to
understand, as if they ( viz. his hands) could tell things to come, because he
did not hastily nor gropingly put them forth, but as one well knowing directs
his right to Ephraim the youngest and his left to the firstborn, etc. See
Tract. cap. 2. following toward the end.

Ear. Eye.
Job 29, 11. When the Ear heard, then it blessed me, and when the Eye saw, it
gave witness to me -- Here to the Ear and Eye is attributed, what belongs to
man, Job. 28.4. The Flood breaks out from the Inhabitant, forgotten of the
Foot, where forgetfulness is attributed to the Foot, that is, (as Junius and
Tremellius note) such Floods as no foot ever experienced, because so deep as
not to be waded or gone through.

Psalm. 35.10. All my [Bones] shall say, O Lord, who is like unto thee? Psalm.
51.8. Bones.
The Bones which thou have broken shall rejoice (so the Hebrew) here Glorying
and Rejoicing in God is ascribed to the Bones which is the property of man; as
if he had said, I will inwardly and heartily glorify thee and rejoice in thee.
By the same Reason it is said, Psalm. 103.1. Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all
that is within (or my Bowels) bless his holy Name. Bowels.
Psalm. 68.31. Ethiopia shall make her hands to run to God. (so the Hebrew) that
is, shall with speed stretch them out in prayer; as the Chald. expounds it:
Hands.
Or shall quickly extend her hands to give gifts of Gold to the Lord as R. Aben
Ezra and R. Salomo expounds it. See Psalm. 72.15. Some take this Metonymically,
where extending the Hands is put for a gift, as before.

Psalm. 73.9. They set their mouth against the Heavens, (that is, the foolish
and wicked, Tongue.
as ver. 3.) and their [Tongue] walks through the Earth, that is, they do
rashly and licentiously throw reproaches upon God and Man, neither sparing
heavenly or earthly things, Psalm. 137.5. If I forget thee O Jerusalem, let my
right hand forget, (that is as Junius and Tremellius say, it self,) viz. Let it
be rather dead or withered then I should give over singing, or as Illyricus
says, let my right hand forget its musical dexterity, as in the next verse let
my Tongue cleave to the roof of my Mouth, if I prefer not Jerusalem above the
head of my Joy -- that is, let the Lord vouchsafe, that I may never play upon
Music, or sing more, then I should admit so great a wickedness, as to desert
Jerusalem, and its Religion and Ministry, and give over to celebrate with
Hymns, Music and Voice; yea, I will prefer thee to the chief esteem before all
other things, Joys, Comforts, etc.

Prove. 10.32. The Lips of the Righteous, know what is acceptable, that is, they
speak so prudently, as if knowledge resided in them, which Job 34.35. Is in the
negative expressed, Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were
without wisdom. -- Matthew. 6.3. But when thou give Alms, let not thy left hand
know what thy right hand does -- this is spoken to prohibit the vain glory of
Almsgiving, when done for praise, etc. Theophilact expounds it -- if it be
possible you are even to forget all your own good deeds, or at least by no
means to glory in them or rest upon them, lest you be vainly lifted up. To this
may be referred, where Anger is attributed to the Eyes, Genesis 31.35. and 45.5.
Esa. 3.8. And Concupiscence, Pleasure or Desire, 1 Kings 20.6. Ezekiel. 24.16.21.
1 John 2.16. (hence the phrase of the hearts walking after the Eyes, Job 31.7.
that is, the desires and lusts follow, which the Eyes moved by outward objects,
endeavor to stir up in the heart. The Abominations of the Eyes, Ezekiel. 20.7.
that is, which were the object and scope of desire) And Adultery, 2 Pet. 2.14.
and Compassion, as when the Eye is said to pity, Deuteronomy. 13.8. Esa. 13.18. etc.
And Hope or Expectation, Psalm. 119.82, 123. and 145.14.15. vid. Gram. Sacr. p.
282.

2. Words are used of [ Brutes] which properly belong to man, as Job 12.7.
Gram. Sacr.
But ask now the Beasts, and they shall teach thee, and the Fowls of the Air,
and they shall tell thee, or speak to the Earth, and it shall teach thee, and
the Fishes of the Sea shall declare unto thee. To ask and speak in this place
signifies to meditate, search into, or contemplate; for the teaching, telling
or narration, of Beasts, Fowls, the Earth and Fishes intimates that they are a
real Testimony and Evidence of the wisdom of the Creator. What he said ver. 2.
that he had understanding and skill in what his Friends discoursed of, he
prosecutes here, as if he had said, ye have talked much of the Wisdom and Power
of God, and that he creates and preserves all things, as if they were unknown
to me, but the very Creatures tacitly inform me of that. See Job 9.10. Romans
1.20.

Job 41.29. He (the Leviathan or Whale) laugheth at the shaking of a spear,
that is, he cares not for it, Prove. 30.25. The Ants are a people not strong,
etc. ver. 26. The Conies are but a feeble people, etc. Joel. 1.6. For a Nation
is come up upon my Land, strong and without Number, etc. The speech here is of
Canker Worms, Locusts or Caterpillars mentioned ver. 4. and which by the same
Metaphor are called the great Army of God, chap. 2.11.25. By the same reason
the multitude of Locusts are represented as an Army, Prove. 30.27. Neh. 3.17.
Hieron. upon Joel 2. thus writes -- This we saw lately in this Province (viz.
Palestine) For when whole Troops of Locusts came, and filled the Air between
Heaven and Earth, they flew with so great an order by the disposal of God who
commanded them, so that like square stones placed by the hand of an Artificer
in a pavement, they kept their places, that not one was observed to incline to
the other by any transverse or irregular motion -- This was a great punishment
upon enormous sinners, which Moses in Gods stead threatens. Deuteronomy. 28.38, 39.
and Solomon prays against 1 Kings 8.37. And Pliny himself a Heathen Writer,
lib. 11. cap. 29. acknowledges the Anger of the Gods by the multitude of these
Insects. Some with these words of Scripture, parallel Virgils words, of Bees,
Lib. 4. Georg.

Magnanimosque Duces, totiusque ex ordine gentis
Mores and studia, et Populos, et praelia dicam.
And of Ants.

It Nigris Campis Agmen, praedamque per herbas
Convectant call Angusto, pars grandia trudunt
Obnixe frumenta Humeris, pars agmina Cogunt,
Castigantque Moras, etc.
lib. 4. Aeneid. To this Class may be referred when the word Son is ascribed
to Beasts, as Exodus 29.1. Take a young Bullock the Son of a Cow, (so the
Hebrew) that is, a sucking Calf or one not yet weaned, Genesis 49.11. The * Son of
an Ass is put for its Colt or Foal, Zach. 9.9. A Colt the * Son of Asses, that
is, one of the she Asses, according to the Idiotism of which see the Book cited
in the Margent.

By another Reason Rams are called the Note that in the places marked with the
Asterisc it is not so in our English but it is so in the Original Hebrew.
Sons of Bashan, Deuteronomy. 32.14. that is, fat Rams of the breed of Bashan, because
that was a good place for Fatning. Note that in the places marked with the
Asterisc it is not so in our English but it is so in the Original Hebrew.
A hand is attributed to a Dog, Psalm. 22.20. Note that in the places marked with
the Asterisc it is not so in our English but it is so in the Original Hebrew.
To a Lion and a Bear, 1 Samuel 17.37. In general a Hand is ascribed to every
Beast, Genesis 9, 5. In which places power and strength is to be understood,
especially and more eminently in the last. Gram. Sacr. p. 138.
See Gram. Sacr. p. 138. It is said Prove. 30.28. The spider takes hold with her
hands, that is, with her feet which are on either side so pliable as a man's
hand to spin their web, and seize upon their prey -- Junius.

3. Some things are spoken of [ things growing out of the Earth,] which
properly belong to man, as Levit. 19.23. And when ye shall come into the Land,
and shall have planted all manner of Trees for food; then ye shall count the
fruit thereof as uncircumcised, three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto
you; it shall not be eaten of. -- The meaning is, that the fruit of the three
first years shall be accounted unclean and rejected, as an uncircumcised man
was accounted unclean before God, and was not to be received among the People.
And in the fourth year that fruit was to be offered to God as a sign of
Thanksgiving ver. 24. but the fifth year the common use of it was allowed, ver.
25.

Job 14.7, 8, 9. Hope, Old Age, Death, the scent of Waters, are applied to the
Bough of a Tree, which is cut off, and buds again, and compared to a man once
dead cannot return or revive again, viz. into this Life, which was the scope of
Job, as chap. 7.7, 9, 10. and 13.15, 16. and 19.25, 26, 27. Where he evidently
declares the Resurrection of the dead to the enjoyment of Everlasting Life.

Psalm. 78.4. [ Killing and Death] is attributed to Plants as he killed (so the
Hebrew) their Vines with Hail, and their Sycomores with great Hail Stones.
Contrary to this is that (...), (zoopoiesis) quickening or living of the seed
cast into the Earth, by which its budding or growth is noted, as in the
following verses -- Ezekiel. 31.9. Envy or Emulation; ver. 14. Exalting or
Elevation of heart and drinking of Water, ver. 15. mourning or grief of mind;
ver. 16. Consolation or Comfort are attributed to Trees, by a certain
Prosopopeia and in a way of comparison of a goodly Tree with the King of
Assyria. See Hos. 9.6. -- Joel 1.10. The New Wine is ashamed or blushed, that
is, there is so bad a Vintage or Wine Harvest, that it is ashamed, because it
did not answer the peoples expectation. In the same verse languishing or a
disease is attributed to Oil, which properly belongs to man, Psalm. 6.2.3. But
metaphorically denotes a spoil and devastation of the fruit of the Earth, as
Esa. 16.8. etc. It is said Habak. 3.17. That the labor of the Olive shall lie
(so the Hebrew) when it answers not the desires of men, but fails their
expectation of much fruit, which is also ascribed to New Wine, Hos. 9.2. -- It
is said, Psalm. 58.9. Before your pots can feel the Thorns, he shall take them
away as with a whirlwind, that is, before your pots grow hot with a fire of
Thorns (which were wont to be used) for that fire lasts but a little while, and
will not boil the Flesh, so shall they quickly perish, etc.

4. Some things are spoken of Inanimate Creatures, which properly belong to a
living man (or more generally to living Creatures.) As,

Genesis 4.10. The Voice of Blood.
(1.) Of Dead men Genesis 4.10. The Voice of thy Brothers bloods cries unto me
from the ground. Here a voice and crying is attributed to the blood of slain
Abel by a very weighty Emphasis -- As to the phrase of a voice and crying
directed to God, it manifestly intimates these two things -- First, that he is
a just Judge, and the avenger of wickedness, and therefore the violent murder
of Abel, could not but come to him for Justice on the assassinate, as it is
said in the like case, 2 Chronicles. 24.22. The Lord look upon it, and require it,
viz. the blood of Zechariah. The Second is, that he is a gracious loving Father
and defender of such as are his, and minds them as well in Life as in Death;
for he had not only a respect for Abel when alive, but hearkens also to the cry
of his blood when Dead according to Romans 14.8. Whether we live or die, we are
the Lords.

Some put an Emphasis in ( bloods) being in the plural number, intimating as it
were, that there were many slain in Abel, that is, such offspring as he might
have had, which tacitly call for Justice, hence the Chald. translates it --
The Voice of the seeds of thy blood which were to come, and issue from thy
Brother, but seems to be far fetched. By the plural word (of bloods) are noted
slaughters, because the blood gushing from the veins scatters into diverse
parts, Psalm. 5.6. The Lord will abhor the man of bloods and deceit, (so the
Hebrew) Psalm. 51.14. Deliver me from bloods, (we translate it blood-guiltiness,
Hos. 4.2. They break out and bloods touches blood. But here blood violently
shed is understood by a Synecdoche, and Matthew. 23.35. The blood of Abel is
expressed in the singular number, (...), (haima.) As to the sense and
connection, because Cain did not only, not confess his sin, but also impudently
deny that he was concerned in the care or keeping of his Brother, God deals
more openly, saying: The voice of thy Brothers blood cries to me from the
Earth, that is, thy Brother is slain; I do not vainly inquire where he is, his
blood demands vengeance of me, and I am concerned to call his Murderer to
account, therefore speak plainly what have thou done? that is, Why did thou
dare or presume to lay violent hands on him? Thou say, thou art not his
keeper, as if the question were whether thou have kept him? Tell rather what
thou have designed against him; this is the paraphrase of Musculus upon the
place.

To this place Heb. 12.24. refers, where the crying blood of dead Abel is
fairly compared to the living blood of Christ our Mediator and Intercessor.
Gram. Sacr. p. 261.


Esa. 14.9, 10. The [ Dead] are feigned to come from Hell or the Graves, to
deride the Pride and Haughtiness of that inhumane King of Babylon, speaking to
him when fallen from his greatness, and upbraiding him for his monstrous pride,
and shameful downfall.

Jer. 31.15. Rachel the Mother of Joseph and Benjamin, long before dead is
brought in as bitterly weeping for the Captivity of the people; which prophecy
is alleged to express the cruelty of Herod's Massacre of the Infants, Matthew.
2.18. for the agreement of that tyrannical fact with that place. Rachels
Sepulcher was near Bethlem, in which and the adjacent places, that most cruel
villainy was committed, etc. See also Ezekiel. 32.21. etc.

2. Of other things void of Life and Soul, Genesis 4.11. And now art thou cursed
from the Earth, which has opened her Mouth to receive thy Brothers blood from
thy hand; by this Prosopopeia the wickedness of Cain is aggravated, as if he
had said, the very Earth though destitute of sense and reason, yet was more
humane and kind to thy Brother then thou were, because it received and laid up,
that blood which thou have spilt, from the sight of men lest it should cause
horror in them. Others say that this speech denotes the extreme grievousness of
his wickedness, and the horror of his guilty Conscience, rendering the very
senseless Creatures his Enemies, as if he had said, the very Earth which (as it
were) with open mouth received the blood of thy Brother from thy hand, will
account thee as execrable, which agrees fairly with the following words.

Genesis 47.19. Death is attributed to the Land, which denotes desolation. Exodus
9.18. It is said of Mount Sinai, that Jehovah appearing it quaked, that is, it
had such commotions as if, like a man, it had trembled for fear -- Levit.
18.18. Spuing out its inhabitants, is attributed to the Land which signifies
their expulsion for their wickedness, Deuteronomy. 32.42. God is said to make his
Arrows drunk with blood -- that is, that out of his just wrath he would send
the Enemies of the Land, to kill the wicked and rebellious people. See Esa.
34.5. Jer. 46.10.

Josh. 24.27. And Joshua said unto all the People, behold this stone shall be a
Witness unto us: For it has heard all the words of the Lord, which he spoke
unto us, etc. The stone erected there is by a Prosopopeia, said to hear,
because it was present (as it were a Witness,) and was appointed, as a memorial
and Testimonial sign of the Covenant God then made with his people.

Judge. 5.20. They fought from Heaven, Judge. 5.20. The Stars Fight. etc.
the Stars in their courses (or degrees) fought against Sisera. -- The Stars
are said to fight, because they were instruments of exciting those Hails and
Storms which God probably used against his Enemies -- Josephus says, that when
the Canaanites encountered with the Israelites a violent shower fell, and much
Rain and Hail by the force of the Wind was fiercely driven into the Canaanites
faces, so that their bows and slings became unprofitable and useless, neither
could they being so benumbed with cold handle their Swords; which tempest
nevertheless did no way prejudice the Israelites. Brentius thus expounds it' we
simply expound it that God was no way favorable, but an Enemy to the
enterprise of Sisera, because he dwells in Heaven and terrified the Host and
Chariots of Sisera, etc. chap. 4.15. And whereas the Stars are said to Fight,
it carries the show of a Proverb, signifying that no prosperous Fortune was on
Sisera's side, for when any ill luck betides men, they are wont to say, that no
Star shines upon them, or that the Stars resist them, by which is meant, that
all Creatures both Earthly and Heavenly threaten their destruction -- Junius
and Tremellius Translate that the Stars ( e suis aggeribus) from their sconces
or Bulwarks, fought against Sisera, that is, from the superior Regions of the
Air, a speech translated from Soldiers fighting from higher places.

Job 3.8. [ Eye-lids] (in the Hebrew text) are attributed to the morning, by
which its early beams are understood, or the first shining of its rays arising
from the approaching Sun; a metaphor taken from one newly awake that lifts up
his Eyelids, or as others say from the swift motion and vibration of the
Eyelids, because the Sunbeams move swiftly, till they are diffused to the
ends of the Hemisphere.

Job 31.38. If my Land cry against me, or that the furrows thereof weep --. The
good man declares that he is ready to bear judgment, censure or curses if any
person can justly complain, that he has done them injury; which by an elegant
Prosopopeia he expresses; the explication follows, ver. 39. If I have eaten the
fruits thereof without Money, or have caused the Souls of the owners thereof to
expire, (breath out, or grieve) so the Hebrew. Illyricus says, that the Land
and Furrows are put Metonymically for the Husbandmen, but the former
explication is the best. See Job 38.7. with Psalm. 148.2, 3, etc.

A [ Nativity] or Birth is attributed to Rain, Dew, Ice, and Frost, Job 38.28,
29. for their production from God, where there is also an Anthropopathy.

Psalm. 19.1 The Heavens declare, etc.
Psalm. 19.1. The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the firmament shows
his handy work that is, they exhibit, show, and demonstrate to the Eyes of all
things, a real testimony and instruction of the glorious power of God) ver. 2.
Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night shows knowledge, that is,
by that succession and vicissitude of days and nights, which is so certain, so
constant, and so profitable for men and other Creatures, the Glory of God the
workman is most evidently celebrated. See Psalm. 104.20.21, 22, 23, 24.

Some by a Metonymie understand day and night of those things which are done or
happen by day and night, that the sense may be, that every day and every night
some new thing is discovered by which to right observers, the glory of God may
be illustrated) ver. 3. There is no speech nor language where their voice is
not heard, that is, there are no people, though of different languages, whom
that speech of the Heavens, and their real publication of praise may not
instruct in the glory and power of God. See Romans 1.19.20. Because that which
may be known of God, is manifest in them (or to them) for the invisible things
of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are
without excuse) ver. 4. Their line is gone out through all the Earth, and their
words to the end of the World, that is, in the extremest parts of the Earth,
that stately fabric of celestial bodies is seen, as if it were exactly done by
line and square, which seems instead of words, etc. Romans 10.18. For their line-
we read their sound, because what is said in the Psalm of the motion of the
celestial bodies, the Apostle elegantly accommodates to the course of
Evangelical Preaching. Genebrard says, that the Hebrew word signifies indeed
alive, but the Septuagint respect the sense, whom the Apostle followed, [that
being the most used and received Version]) ver. 5. The going forth of a
Bridegroom out of his Chamber, and his rejoicing, is by the same metaphor
ascribed to the rising Sun, to his never ceasing and most swift course.

Psalm. 65.12. The little Hills are Exultatione colles accinguntur
girded with Joy on every side, ver. 13. The Pastures are clothed with Flocks,
the Valleys are also covered over with Corn, they shout for Joy, they also
sing. The Ornaments of the Earth, which by the blessing of God it every where
enjoys, are expressed by this Metaphor. Mathesius says, that the Metaphor of
girding, ver. 12. is to be expounded of the various and winding veins of
Metals in the Bosom of the Earth.

Psalm. 77.16. The waters saw thee O God, the waters saw thee, they were afraid;
the Depths also were troubled -- he speaks of the Red Seas being divided, and
the people of Isreal's marching through the middle of it, which is described,
Exodus 14. But the sense of seeing and the passion of fear is attributed to the
waters by a Prosopopeia, for to see here signifies to experience -- as if he
had said, they have experienced thee, and felt thy power, when by a strong Wind
they were cut, and the bottom of the Sea became naked, to make a way, or
passage for thy people -- They are said to fear, when at the beck of God, like
trembling persons, they fled from their place, against their nature, and by the
tremendous omnipotency of God stood as a Wall on either side, as it is said of
the same Miracle, Psalm. 114.3. The Sea saw it and fled, etc. ver. 5. What ailed
thee, O thou Sea, that thou fleddest? etc,

Psalm. 98.8. Let the Floods clap their Hands, let the Hills sing, (so the
Hebrew) These things are ascribed to inanimate Creatures, to stir up men to a
desire after the coming of the Lord. So Psalm. 96.11, 12. etc. More examples you
may see, Psalm. 103.16. with Job 7.10. and 8.18. Psalm. 104.19. Cant. 1.6. Esa.
3.26. with Job 1.20. and 2.13.

Esa. 5.14. Hell (others translate it Sepulcher) has enlarged her Soul (so the
Hebrew) and opened her mouth without measure -- By a Prosopopeia he compares
the insatiable condition of Hell (or the Grave) with the unsatisfied Gluttony,
and Luxury of the Jews, and foretells the punishment that God in his Wrath will
therefore inflict upon them. Jerome in his Commentary upon this place says --
Hell is said to have a soul, not that it is a Living Creature, as some
erroneously conceit, but because by words of humane custom we may express the
affections of things insensible: It is insatiable because it can never be
filled with the multitude of the Dead. See more examples, Esa. 24.4. and 33.9.
Jer. 4.28. and 12.4. Lam. 2.8. Hosea 4.3. Joel 1.10. Amos 1.2. etc.

Esa. 24.23. Then shall the Moon blush (so the Hebrew) and the Sun shall be
ashamed, when the Lord of Hosts shall Reign in Mount Sion, etc. This
Prosopopeia intimates the light of Divine Grace in the Church, as if he had
said, the glory of the Sun or Moon will be nothing, if compared with the Glory
of him that rules in the Church of God, Esa. 55.12. The Mountains and the Hills
shall break forth before you into singing, and all the Trees of the Field shall
clap their hands. By this most elegant Prosopopeia likewise spiritual Joy in
the Kingdom of Christ is figured, as chap. 49.13. where the Heavens and
Mountains are excited to singing, by the same Prophetical voice. And Jer.
51.48. Then the Heaven and the Earth, and all that's therein, shall sing for
Babylon, etc. By which Hyperbolical Prosopopeia, an immensity of Joy for the
destruction of Babylon and the Deliverance of all true Israelites is set forth,
Lam. 1.4. The ways of Sion do Mourn, because none come to the solemn Feast --
This intimates a forsaking of the solemn Worship of God.

Hosea 1.21, 22. And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear says the
Lord, Hos. 2.21.
I will hear the Heavens, and they shall hear the Earth. -- And the Earth shall
hear the Corn, and the Wine and the Oil, and they shall hear Jezreel. Besides
the gracious blessing of God, the connection of first and second causes is
fairly intimated by this speech. Jezreel, that is, the Congregation of the
faithful (which according to this Name, is the seed of God) does as it were
cry, that is, expects Corn and Wine and Oil; and these (as it were) cry to the
Earth, that they may receive juice and nourishment from it, for their
nourishment and increase -- And the Earth (as it were) invokes Heaven for Heat,
Rain, Showers, Dew, Snow, Winds and celestial influences: And the heavens (as
it were) invokes God the chief cause of all things, without whom no second
causes can effect or produce any thing, and who when he has a mind to punish
can make the Heavens as Brass, and the Earth as Iron, Deuteronomy. 28.2^^. and detain
the fructifying Rain, Jer. 14.22. But here being gracious and propitious to men
he is pleased to hear, giving power to Heaven, that by Clouds made of collected
vapors, and by various fructifying ways it should influence the Earth; and the
Heaven shall hear the Earth, by giving Rain and other things needful to make it
fruitful -- And the Earth shall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oil, and
other things growing upon the Earth, whilst moistened from Heaven it gives them
juice and vigor: And these shall hear Jezreel, that is, they shall answer the
prayers or desires of the Godly, and so shall Divine blessing be conveyed to
them, etc.

Jonah. 1.4. But the Lord cast forth a great Wind into the Sea and there was a
mighty tempest in the Sea, so that the Ship thought to be broken, so the
Hebrew, that is, it was like to be broken, as if the Ship had a mind -- Some
explain this by a metonymie of the thing containing; that is, they that were in
the Ship thought that they must speedily suffer shipwreck.

John 3.8. The Wind blows where it lists, and thou hear the sound
thereof, but can not tell whence it comes, John 3.8. The Wind blows etc.
nor whither it goes, etc. A Will and Walking is attributed to the Wind and
Air, to signify its various, wonderful vicissitudes unknown to man; upon which
Erasmus in his paraphrase excellently says -- This Air by which we are
vegetated, and whose power, and utility we only feel, is very subtle, and is
called a spirit (or Wind;) and this spirit is not restrained at the pleasure of
men, but is carried by its own force, by which it is known to diffuse it self
through all things, having a wonderful power over all corporeal things:
Sometimes giving Life, sometimes Death. Now calm and silent, then more violent,
sometimes blowing from the East, sometimes from the West, and sometimes from
other different quarters of the World. And discovers it self by the effect: You
hear its voice, when you see no Body, neither can it be graspt by the hands;
you feel it present, but you see it not coming, neither can you tell whither it
goes at its departure -- The New Birth is like it -- The minds of men by the
Spirit of God are carried away and transformed by secret breathings. The
ineffable power and effect of it is felt, but what is done is not discerned by
the Eyes. And so they that are born again, are not now acted by a humane and
carnal Spirit, but by the Spirit of God who quickens, and moderates all things.
See Romans 8.22.

To this Class belong some Nouns, and some Verbs.

1. NOVNS, as when Arrows are called the Sons of the quiver, Lam. 3.13. because
they lie hid there, as a Child in the Womb, Psalm. 127.3, 4. So Sparkles are
called sons of burning Coals, Job 5.7. (for in both places the Hebrew is so.) A
Tongue is ascribed to Fire (Esa. 5.24. and Flame, because of some similitude
betwixt a Tongue and the tapering Flame. See Act. 2.3. A Tongue is also
attributed to the Sea, Josh. 15.2, 5. which is to be understood of a Bay in
form like a Tongue. So the Tongue of the Egyptian Sea, Esa. 11.15. is a certain
Bay or River, etc. The (oblong) wedge which Achan took, is called, in the
Hebrew, a Tongue of Gold, Josh. 7.21. A Hand is attributed to a Sword, Job
5.20. To a Flame of Fire, Esa. 47.14. To Hell, Hos. 13.14. By which (as in our
Translation) their power is understood. The beginning of a parting way is
called the Mother, and Head of the Way, Ezekiel. 21.21.

2. VERBS, Bread is said to be gone away, when it is spent, 1 Samuel 9.7. See
Rev. 18.14. A City is said to Cry, Esa. 14.31. So is a Stone, Habak 2.11. The
Hire of Laboarers defrauded, Jam. 5.4. which denotes the grievousness of the
sin or punishment. See Luke 19.40. To Eat, is ascribed to consuming Fire,
Levit. 10.2. Job 1.16. Nah. 3.15. To the destroying Sword, 2 Samuel 2.26. Esa.
1.20. Jer. 2.30. And to a Land or Region, Numb. 13.33. Either because being
hard it wasted men's strength in tilling, or because of the unwholesomeness of
the Air. To Heal, Cure, or Revive is put for repairing decayed buildings, 1 Chronicles. 11.8. 2 Chronicles. 24.13. Neh. 4.2. 1 King. 18.30 Healing is put for
blessing the Land, 2 Chronicles. 7.14. Psalm. 60.3, 4. For making the Waters wholesome
2 Kings 2.21, 22. Ezekiel. 47.8. See more examples, Genesis 18.10, 14. Genesis 23.16.
Cant. 5.5. Jer. 23.9. Jer. 5.28. etc.

5. Sometimes Kingdoms, Provinces and Cities (which are, as it were,
incorporate bodies) are spoken of, as if they were a single person, as

(1. The People in general, as Esa. 1.5, 6. expounded ver. 7, 8, 9. Deuteronomy.
33.12. Esa. 7.20. and 8.8. and 30.28. Hab. 3.13.

(2.) Of the whole People more specially, but less frequently, Lam. 3.1. Esa.
7.20.

(3.) Of a whole City the Scripture speaks as of a Woman, Esa. 32.9. An evident
example of this Prosopopeia you will find, Esa. 1. and Lam. 2. See also Esa.
32.11. with ver. 9. Hence the people of the Jews are proposed as a faithless
and Adulterous Woman, Jer. 3.1, 3, 4. and 4.30. Ezekiel. chap. 1^^. and 23. By
which the conjunction of the Church with God is compared to humane Wedlock. God
himself is proposed in this Allegory as the Husband, the Commonwealth of Israel
as the Mother, out of which sprung the two Kingdoms of Israel and Juda, which
are compared with Daughters, (Ezekiel. 23.2. There were two women the Daughters of
one Mother, ver. 3. and they committed Whoredoms in Egypt) And when they were
espoused in a Covenant way to God, they most wickedly forsook him, and
committed frequent Adulteries, etc. For they are spiritual Adulteries and
Whoredoms which Jehovah so often reprehends and detests by his Prophets, when
joined with impenitence, Exodus 34.15, 16. Deuteronomy. 31.16. Judge. 2.17. Esa. 1.21.
and 57.3. Nah. 3.4. etc. Esa. 23.15, 16, 17.

(4.) The Name of Mother is attributed to a City, 2 Samuel 20.19. By which the
Chief or Metropolitan City is understood, from whence the rest derive their
original, and owe subjection to, Josh. 17.16. Numb. 21.25. Judge. 11.26. 2 Samuel
8.1. The whole people of God are called Mother, Esa. 50.1. Hos. 2.2. Because it
begets or ought to beget spiritual Sons to God. Hence it is translated to the
heavenly Jerusalem, the New Testament Church, Gal. 4.26.

(5.) The Name of Daughter and Virgin, is often attributed to a People or City,
either distinctly or conjunctly, Psalm. 45.12. and 137.8. Daughter of Babylon,
is put for the Kingdom of Babylon, so Lam. 1.6. and 2.1. etc. Daughter of Sion,
for the people of the Jews, and hence Lam. 2.2. She is called the Daughter of
Juda. So Zach. 9.9. Esa. 1.8. -- 10.32. -- 16.1. -- 37.22. Jer. 4.31. -- 6.2.
Micah 4.10.13. Zeph. 3.10, 14. etc. So the Virgin of Israel, Jer. 31.4, 21.
Amos 5.2. Sometimes Virgin and Daughter are joined, as Esa. 23.12. -- 37.22. --
47. 1. Jer. 46.11.

1. When the Name of Virgin is attributed to the People of God, some say, Why
the name of Virgin is attributed to the People of God. In Comment Esa. 37.
it is with respect to the true Worship of God, observed by them without
corruption, because such as depart from its purity, are called whorish and
adulterous, upon which Jerome says, Sion and Jerusalem is therefore called a
Virgin and Daughter, because when all other Nations adored Images or Idols,
this alone preserved the chastity of Religion, and the adoration of one
Divinity, But Drusius denies this ( lib. 16. obser. cap. 5.) from two reasons,
First, because with respect to Israel she is rather called the Wife of God, and
when she Worships other Gods, a whore. Secondly, because the Scripture calls
Israel a Virgin even when she adores false Gods, Amos 5.2. and Jer. 18.13. The
Virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing, others add a third reason,
because Babylon and Egypt, are also called Virgins as before, which yet were
full of Idolatry and impiety. But Drusius thinks she was called a Virgin before
the Captivity; and was so no more when she was subjected to a strange yoke. In
Esa. 37.22.
Brentius says, That Jerusalem was called a Virgin, either because its Kingdom
was a free Monarchy, and did not serve any foreign King, but had a King of its
own Nation, as a Virgin is not subject to the yoke of any strange man: Or
because, as a Virgin yet untouched or uncorrupted by man, the City Jerusalem
was not yet spoiled by any Enemy, nor her Citizens translated elsewhere. But
Drusius objects that place, Jer. 18.13. To himself, for Jeremy Prophesied after
the ten Tribes were carried away, and yet he calls Israel a Virgin, which doubt
(says he) may be resolved by understanding by Virgin the People of the Jews, so
called in specie, as not yet exhausted by a total carrying away, as ver. 11.
But although this may satisfy that doubt, yet Lam. 2.13. strongly confutes
this interpretation of Drusius, where Jerusalem is called the Virgin, and
Daughter of Sion after its total devastation by the Babylonians. So that Virgin
is put for the Congregation of the people, under what circumstance soever they
were by a Prosopopeia -- And hence the Chald. translates it a Congregation,
People or Kingdom.

2. By Israel we are to understand the Land, and by Virgin or Daughter the
Inhabitants, for the Ancients were wont to call their Country, their Mother.

6. The Scripture speaks of certain [ Accidents] as if they were men, and had a
Body, which kind they call Somatopeia, as Genesis 4.7. And if thou do not well,
sin lies at the door -- Sin is here proposed as lying at the door like a Night
watchman; whereby is noted that a sure punishment will follow ill doing, as a
Watchman sleeps not, but observes all things and discovers what is evil or
hurtful, in order to punishment

There are other places where a body (as it were a person) and his actions are
attributed to Sin, as Esa. 59.12. Jer. 14.7. Acts 7.60. Romans 6.6. It is
Emphatically called the body of sin, because it struggles with so great force,
soliciting us strongly to do evil, as if it were a living body, or something
existing by it self.

Romans 7. Sin revived and I died -- By the knowledge of the Law, sin is known,
then Conscience makes a man tremble, Romans 7.9.
and a fearful consternation follows, by which man sees nothing before his
Eyes, but eternal Death as the reward of his sin, for the consideration of the
Commandment broken by it, makes it exceeding sinful, ver. 13. And in the
following verses it is brought in as a cruel Tyrant detaining the miserable
sinner Captive, dwelling in him, and warring against the spirit (not that it
will be a perpetual Conqueror in the regenerate, for that will not be, Romans
6.6, 12, 14. etc. but for that unavoidable repugnancy which naturally remains
in the flesh against the Spirit, whilst the regenerate man lives in this life,
ver. 24. See Col. 2.11. and 3.5. Where the members of this body of sin, are
recited as Fornication, Uncleanness, Inordinate affections, Evil Concupiscence,
Covetousness, etc. By which the Will and Reason are depraved, as the body by
its members. Compare the following texts together, James 1.14, 15.18. 1 Pet.
2.11. Jam. 4.1. Rev. 18.5.

To this Class also belong, Genesis 30.33. So shall my Righteousness answer (or
witness) for me when it shall come for my hire before thy face, that is, the
future event shall declare that God has an account of my Righteousness, which
you shall then evidently see, etc. here witnessing which is the proper action
of a Person is attributed to Righteousness. Punishments are called Witnesses,
Job. 10.17. with 16.8.

Psalm. 85.10. Mercy and Truth will meet together, Righteousness and Peace shall
kiss each other; Ps. 85.10 etc.
the affinity and conjunction of those virtues or graces is set before our eyes
by the similitude of persons, who after the manner of their Country, do at
meeting embrace and kiss each other, in Testimony of Friendship. He speaks of
the Kingdom of Christ, expressing its blessings and manner of Administration by
this Prosopopeia, ver. 12. It is said that Righteousness shall look down from
Heaven, that is the Righteousness of Christ, through whose merits we become
justified before God, Romans 1.17. -- 3.22. It is said ver. 13. That
Righteousness shall walk before him, that is, to testify his gracious coming
and presence, Esa. 59.14. Judgment is turned away backward, and justice
stands afar off: For Truth is fallen in the street, and Equity cannot enter.
Here is an elegant Prosopopeia of virtue and piety, intimating how scarce they
are and how rarely found amongst men.

CHAP. X. Of Metaphors taken from God, Angels, Heaven, and the Elements.
IT was said Chap. VI. That there should be a general division of this Trope
into the distinct Fountains and Classes of Metaphors, which with Divine help
shall be essayed in the following Chapters. The chief Division of universal
beings is into the Creator, and the Creatures -- From the Creator we shall
produce some -- But from the Creatures there are abundance of Metaphors taken
in Scripture, which we shall endeavor to make plain.

Metaphors taken from God.
AS sometimes from his Name, sometimes from his Actions. His Hebrew Name (...)
Elohim, when taken properly, belongs to none but the only true and Eternal God,
and because it is of the plural number it intimates the Mystery of a plurality
of persons in one most simple Deity. See Gram. Sacr: p. 87, 376. But
metaphorically this Name is attributed to Creatures also, As,

1. To [ Angels] who are endued with more eminent power, and more abundant
happiness, then any other Creatures, as Psalm. 8.5. Thou have made him a little
lower then ( The Gods.
Elohim) the Angels, as the Chald. the 70. Interpreters, Pagninus, and our
Translation render it; But we have a most certain interpreter, Heb. 2.7. viz.
the Apostle who expressly quoting this text says, but thou have made him Or a
little while inferior to.
a little lower, (...), (ti par Angelous) than the Angels, see ver. 9. Where
the same is repeated -- In both places it is spoke of Christ, with respect to
his state of humiliation, an evident specimen is the Angels comforting him in
his Agony in the Garden, Luke 22.43. So Psalm. 86.8. and 97.7, 9. where the
word, Elohim, is put for Angels, as it expressly appears, Heb. 1.6. The meaning
is, that there is no power so sublime but must be subject to the sovereignty of
Christ's Kingdom.

2. To Men of eminent dignity, and his substitutes on Earth by whom God
Governs, Judges, Informs, and Helps men, as if he had metaphorically called
them Divine men. Genesis 6.2. The Sons of God saw the Daughters of men, etc. The
Chald. renders it, Sons of great men, or grandees; Pagninus, the Sons of
Princes -- Brentius in his Comment. upon the place thus expounds it. Filii Dei
sunt filii Patriarcharum praecip^^i, and Heroes, penes quos erat, etc.
The Sons of God, are the principal Sons and Heroes of the Patriarchs, in whose
hands because of the right of primogeniture and other gifts of God, the chief
authority was lodged and who in Doctrine and example, ought to go before
others, as the Princes and heads of the People, as Judges and Princes are in
other places of Scripture called Gods. But the Daughters of Men were either
women of the Families of the Canaanites, or without difference any Maids or
Women of the common and vulgar sort, that you may understand that the Princes,
who ought to be an honest example for others, look to themselves at their
pleasure, any that they met and liked what ever they were, whether Kinswomen,
or such as were of Affinity to them, whether Honest or Dishonest. These things
were wickedly done, for here was a neglect of Consanguinity, which the Law of
Nature commands, contempt of Parents and Superiors, and an indulgence of
Polygamy, (or having many wives) and rash and causeless Divorces, etc.

Exodus 4, 16. He shall be to thee a Mouth, and thou shall be to him a God (we
translate instead of a Mouth, and instead of a God) the Chald. renders it for a
Prince or Captain, that is, thou shall be his chief Magistrate, telling him
what he shall say to the People. So God speaks to Moses, Exodus 7.1. See I have
made thee a God unto Pharaoh, the explication follows, ver. 2. Thou shall speak
all that I command thee, and Aaron thy Brother shall speak unto Pharaoh. Moses
is called a God because of the Commission or Embassy he had, to perform in
those wonderful works before Pharaoh -- So Judges are (in the Hebrew) called
Gods, Exodus 21.6. and 22.8, 9, 28. So 1 Samuel 28.13. That spectrum or apparition
in the likeness of Samuel, is so called, Psalm 82.1. He judges among the Gods,
that is, among the Judges. See ver. 6. I have said ye are Gods, from which
Christ argues, John 10.34, 35, 36. that he was much more the Son of God. See
Psalm. 138.1, 4. Psalm. 119.46. I will speak of thy Testimony before Kings and be
not ashamed: which Kings are elsewhere called Gods, etc.

It is also attributed to [ Idols] Exodus 23.24. Esa. 36.18. But it is by a
Metonymie of the Adjunct, by which the opinion of men is put for the thing it
self, as chap. 4. before-going. For Idols are really things of no value, as
Lev. 19.4. Psalm. 97.7. Esa. 10.10. and 19.3. Yea, no Gods, 2 Chronicles. 13.9. (1
Cor. 8.4. an Idol is nothing in the World) but they are Worshipped by Idolaters
as Gods, or at best by them they pretend to Worship God. Hence they are called
Gods with the addition of another word, as Exodus 20.3. Strange Gods, Deuteronomy. 5.7.
Josh. 23.16. Gods besides the Lord, Exodus 22.20. Molten Gods, Lev. 19.14. New
Gods, Judge. 5.8.

The Greek name of God is (...), ( Theos) which is metaphorically ascribed to
the Devil, 2 Cor. 4.4. The God of this World has blinded the minds of them
which believe not, etc. For as the the true God administers the Kingdom of
Grace to such as believe in him, and is by them religiously Worshipped: So
Satan infuses his malignity into unbelievers, Ephesians. 2.2, 3.) who obey his Will,
Command, and Seduction. Upon which Erasmus in his Annotations says thus -- The
Devil is not really a God, but he is so to them, who prefer him before Christ,
just as to covetous men their Money or Mammon is a God, and to their Heirs
their Luxury is a God, and (homo homini Deus) a man is a God to a man, as the
proverb runs. And in his paraphrase -- Whatsoever any person hearkens to,
(obeys or prefers) before or more then God, makes that his God.

This name is also attributed to the Belly, Phil. 3.19. Whose God is their
Belly, that is, such as account their chief good and felicity to consist in the
satisfaction of the desires of the Flesh, and prosperity in this World, without
suffering any persecution for the sake of Christ. Whatsoever any person puts
the chiefest value upon, is to him a God, if he slights the true God. -- In the
New Testament also the Name of God is attributed to [ Idols,] Act. 7.43. --
14.11. by a metonymie, as was said of the Name Elohim, by the opinion of men.
as Gal. 4.8. (...), (me phusei ontes theoi) qui natura non sunt Dii, who by
nature are not Gods, (but by the depraved imagination of Idolaters) 1 Cor. 8.5.
(...), (legomenoi Theoi) who are called Gods (by Idolatrous men) but are not
really so -- And to these that one and true God is opposed, ver. 6. So much for
the Name of God. To which metaphor some refer when the Names of God, (...) (
Elohim) (...) (Jehovah) (...) (El) are added in the room of an Epithet for
Divine, Chief, or most Excellent -- vid. Gram. Sacr. p. 58. seqq. Gram. Sacr.
p. 58.


As to the [ Actions] of God, the word [ Creation] (...) (Bara) properly
signifies to make any thing of nothing, which God alone can do -- But
metaphorically it is Translated to the other great works of God, as Exodus
34.10. I will do marvels, which were not created in the whole Earth, etc. That
is such wonders, and so many, as never yet were done in the World, Numb. 16.30.
If the Lord will create a Creation (so the Hebrew) that is, if he will afford a
New, and Unheard of miracle, such as was the swallowing up of the Earth, which
then happened to the seditions. See Esa. 45.8.

More especially it is taken for the Restoration and Renovation of men,
whether in this Life by the Word and Faith; or in the future, by a clear and
beatifical vision of God, Psalm. 51.10. Create in me a clean Heart, the
explication, and renew a right spirit within me -- It Is as well the work of God
to create a pure heart, that is, to convert and regenerate a man, cleanse him
from sin, justify, and save him, as it is to create him. The impurity,
therefore, of our hearts can with no humane strength or art be purged away, but
we have need of the Creators work, and the Redeemers virtue, and power to make
us New Creatures, John 1.12. But to as many as received him, to them gave he
power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.

Psalm. 102.18. And the People that shall be created, shall praise the Lord,
that is, the Church that shall be restored and gathered by Christ. For this
Psalm treats of that and his Kingdom, of grace, as is alleged, Heb. 1.10, 11,
12. -- Esa. 65.18. Be you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: For
behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoyceing and her people a joy. That he speaks of
the Glory of Christ's Kingdom and Church here, is evident by the following
verses; for its restitution and the whole celestial Administration is expressed
by the Word Creation, to indicate the Omnipotency and most powerful operation
of Christ -- ver. 17. There is mention of the Creation of a New Heaven, and a
New Earth, in the same sense, which promise shall be most perfectly fulfilled
in Eternal Life, as Esa. 66.22. and 2 Pet. 3.13. -- Ephesians. 2.10. For we are his
Workmanship, Created in Christ Jesus unto Good works, etc. that is, regenerated
and renewed in the Image of God. See Psalm. 100.3. Esa. 29.23. etc. This is that
New Creature of whom it is said, 2 Cor. 5.17. If any man be in Christ he is a
New Creature, that is, he is renewed by the Holy Spirit, to lead a new and Holy
Life in the Faith of Christ* What is corrupt in man by sin, is restored and
reformed by Regeneration and Renovation -- and so the Image in which man was at
first created, but lost it because of his sin, begins to be restored -- very
fitly therefore is the Regeneration and Renovation of a man expressed by the
term Creation, for God alone is the Author and Cause of both.

Of Metaphors taken from Angels.
THE Creatures of God are divided into invisible, and visible -- The invisible
are Spirits (...), ( asomatoi) without bodies, and by them we understand
Angels, because being in their own nature incorporeal, they cannot be seen by
humane Eyes -- The visible are whatsoever things have an existence in this
whole universe, whether they be simple or mixed bodies. There are Good, and Bad
Angels, and from both; some, though not many metaphors are taken.

1. From the good Angels, some think that the Ministers of the Gospel are by a
metaphor called Angels, Judge. 2.1. Hag. 1.13. Mal. 2.7. -- 3.1. Matthew. 11.10.
Mark. 1.2. Luke 7.27. 1 Cor. 11.10. Rev. 1.20. and 2.1, 8, 12, 18. and 3.1, 7,
14. and hence not improperly imply an analogy, from the Holy Angels of God to
the Prophets, and other Preachers of the Word. But the Hebrew word (...)
(Maleac) and the Greek (...), (Angelos) being an indifferent and common noun,
They are called Cherubims from the Hebrew word Rabcabh to ride because the Lord
rid betwixt them, Psalm. 18.10.
denoting any Messenger or Legate, it is better to understand that term
properly, because Ministers of the Gospel are really, and not metaphorically
Gods Ministers.

Exodus 28.14. The King of Tyrus, is called by a metaphor, the anointed, (...)
(cherub) by which term Angels are called Genesis 3.24. and Ezekiel. 28.14. The
covering cherub. As if God had said, as Angels amongst created things are by
Nature and Ministry Commissioned by me for the protection of men, so thou (King
of Tyrus) did in thine own conceit and fancy Judge thy self. This metaphor
alludes to Genesis 3.24. As Junius and Tremellius in their notes say -- This is a
most elegant description of that Royal Majesty, by comparing it to that Cherub,
which was placed by God in the Garden of Eden, Genesis 3.24. For as an Angel was
appointed to keep that Garden, and armed with that flaming Sword which turned
every way, it was a terror to all, so thou King of Tyrus, since the Kingdom
became thine, did fancy thy self to equal the Angels of God in Glory. Some
think it has respect to those Angelical figures placed in the Sanctuary, Exodus
25.20. covering the Mercy Seat. Riding upon a cherub is attributed to God,
Psalm. 18.10. 2 Samuel 22.11. When the speech is of Winds, Storms, Clouds and
Tempests, to which this name is ascribed by reason of their vehement swiftness,
and dreadful effects. The Chald. renders it -- And he is revealed in his
Magnificence upon most swift Cherubs, and he is led in strength upon the Wings
of the Wind.

2. As to what respects evil Angels or Devils, Christ calls Peter Satan, when
he would dissuade him from suffering, Matthew. 16.23. Mark 8.33. Get thee behind
me Satan. Erasm. paraphrase.
Some take this as a Noun appellative, and so (...) ( Satan) signifies any
adversary, as if Christ had said -- Give over to contradict the Will of my
Father: it is thy part to follow, not to go before. Now thou gainsayest,
studying to hinder what will save mankind, what the Father will have done, and
what becomes me to do. Thou desire to be a partaker of the Kingdom, and yet
thou hinderest me, that am hastening willingly to the Cross whereby it is to be
purchased; where you see me go (viz. the Kingdom of Heaven) there you ought
also to bend your course. Thou do not yet savor of God, but led by humane
affections, resist the Divine Will. Hinder me not therefore, thou unprofitable
monitor, but follow behind me, and rather act the part of a Disciple then a
Master. But because our Savior uses not the Greek (...), (antikeimenos) or
(...), (antidikos) which signifies an adversary or opposer, but the Hebrew or
Syriack, Satan, by which always the Devil is understood in the New Testament,
and Christ uses the same phrase to the Devil, Luke 4.8. it is more rightly said
that Christ calls Peter, Satan by a metaphor, because in his opposition he
acted the Devils part, in giving Satanical Counsel directly contrary to the
Will of God -- From whence Luther fairly infers this maxim, Tom. 4. lat. fol.
363.
that whatsoever Peter, with the universal College of Apostles speaks from his
own sense (in Divine matters) and not by Divine Authority and Revelation (as
ver. 16.17, 18.) is to be accounted Diabolical and Opposite to Christ -- See 1
Cor. 3.11. -- 16.22. Gal. 1.8, 9. 2 Pet. 1.19, 20. etc. And then he adds --
That Christ in this passage with Peter and his Apostles, prefigured the future
History of his whole Church, to wit, that there should be some true confessors
of Christ, viz. Good Bishops and Martyrs, who should confess and Preach Christ
the Son of the Living God purely, by the example of Peter speaking from the
Revelation of the Father -- But because the same Peter and the Apostles a
little after savor of the Flesh, yea, and (as Christ says) become Satan's, it
signifies that after the Successors of the Apostles and good Bishops, there
would come Devilish Bishops: And that at length he that would usurp the title
of Peter's sole and only Successor, should follow Satan as his Father for
Revelation, and would seek not the Kingdom of God, but of the World. Which
Prophecy we see most palpably and horribly fulfilled, so far Luther.

John 6.70. Christ calls Judas Iscariot a Devil; because he was like him in
Lies and Treachery, and so signally malicious that the Scripture says, he was
of the Devil, John 8.44. 1 John 3.8. And the Son of the Devil, Act. 13.10.

Metaphors taken from Heaven.
COrporeal or Bodily Creatures, according to their Physical distinction are
either simple, or mixed, and compounded. The simple are Heaven and the Elements,
or the Ethereal and Elementary Region of the World.

Heaven properly signifies that outermost celestial body that incloses or
compasses the Elements, and is the receptacle of the Stars and Constellations,
Genesis 1.8, 14* etc. Genesis 15.5. Psalm. 8.3. and 19.1.5. Esa. 14.13.

Also the Airy Region which is above us, and this either in conjunction with
the Ethereal or Starry Heaven, Genesis 1.6, 7, 8, 9. (where by the mention of the
waters being gathered together in one place under the Heavens, is intimated,
that also, to be a Heaven, which is next and immediately above them, which is
the lower Region of the Air) or separately from it, and so only the Air, Lev.
26.19. Deuteronomy. 28.23. 1 King. 8.35. 2 Chronicles. 7.13. Job 1.16. -- 2.12. Psalm. 8*8.
Matthew. 6.26. Luke 9.54. -- 12.56. But metaphorically Heaven is taken.

1. For Divine Glory, and infinite Majesty, which is called (...), (phos
aprositon) light inaccessible (or which none can approach to, 1 Timothy 6.16. By
reason of similitude, from the greatness, splendour, beauty and elegancy of
Heaven -- to which we may refer the words of Bonaventure, Corpus quod est
sursum, dicitur Caelum, etc. The Body which is above is called Heaven, because
it is capacious, lib. sentent. did. 2. n. 33.
secret, and quiet; and because this threefold propriety is found in the
celsitude of the Divinity, it is therefore called Heaven; it is capacious in
the immensity of Power, secret in the depth of knowledge, and quiet in the
tranquillity of delight. This is superior to all Heavens, not by situation but
dignity, and greater than every Heaven, not by extension, but from his own
immensity, by which he is beyond all, but not excluded, etc.

So it is taken when God is said to dwell in Heaven, Psalm. 2.4. 1 King.
8.39.43. etc. So Deuteronomy. 26.15. Look down from thy Holy Habitation from Heaven,
and bless thy people, etc. So it is said of Christ that he came down from
Heaven, John 3.13. -- 6.33, 50, 51. 1 Cor. 15.47. That is, he went forth from
that inaccessible Light of Divine Majesty, and manifested himself in the Flesh.
And the same Throne of Majesty is in the Heavens, Heb. 8.1. and 1.3. to which
Christ (as God-man) in his state of exaltation went. See John 17.5. Heb. 7.26.
Made higher then the Heavens, Ephesians. 4.10. Ascended up far above all Heavens,
that he might fill all things. See Psalm. 8.1, 2. and 108.5. etc. By which
places, not so much the hight of the place, as the sublimity of the Divine
Majesty is expressed.

2. Heaven is metaphorically taken for the spiritual Kingdom of God, and that
state of happiness wherein he manifests and communicates himself to Angels and
Men -- And that is,

(1.) Of Grace, viz. The gathering and gracious Government of the Church
Militant in this Life, to which belongs the appellation of the Kingdom of
Heaven oftentimes attributed to the Church, Matthew. 13.11, 24, 31, 33. and 20.1.
and 22.1. etc. So when it is said to plant a Heaven, Esa. 51.16. and to create
a New Heaven, Esa. 65.17. By which phrases the Restoration of the Church by
Christ is noted, which is begun in this Life, and completed in Eternity, 2.
Pet. 3.13. The Reason of the Comparison is, because as the natural Heaven is
very far distant from the Earth, so the ways of God in ruling his Church, and
giving blessedness to believers do exceedingly surpass the manner of Earthly
Administrations, Esa. 55.9. And as in the natural Heaven all things are in the
exactest order, full of Light and radiance: So God in his Church, is the God of
order and peace, 1 Cor. 14.33. Leading, Teaching, and saving his people by a
most convenient order of mediums, and that by the Light of his saving Word.

(2.) Of Glory, viz. The Eternal and unspeakable felicity of Angels and Holy
men, in the beholding and perfect fruition of the glorious God. To which belong
those phrases, Matthew. 18.10. Their Angels in Heaven behold the face of my
Father -- the speech is of the Angels appointed as keepers of the little ones
-- By which it appears that the Angels though acting on Earth for the good of
Christians are nevertheless really in Heaven, that is, in a celestial state of
blessedness, Matthew. 6.20. Treasures are said to be laid up in Heaven, Luke
8.22. To have treasures in Heaven, Phil. 3.20. To have our Conversation in
Heaven -- By which phrases Faith and Christian Hope aspiring and tending to
Eternal blessedness is to be understood. From this Heaven Satan is said to fall
like Lightning, Luke 10.18. Satan (says) Illyricus) fell not from a place, but
from his degrees of dignity -- to wit from the favor of God and spiritual
Blessedness, into the greatest wickedness, punishments and eternal and
spiritual calamities. Of the scope of these words of Christ, Erasmus says thus
-- Jesus that he might fortify their Mines, against that disease of vain
glory, which even the Saints are sometimes tainted with, proposes the example
of Lucifer to them, who for his pride was suddenly cast down from so great
felicity -- I saw (says he) Satan falling from Heaven like Lightning. His
dignity in Heaven was very eminent, and yet for the swelling pride of his mind
is flung from the highest (glory) to the lowest (wretchedness) how much more
ought you to beware of pride who carry a mortal body about you, obnoxious to
all perils. But others understand this of the power and efficacy of Christ,
which by the Preaching of the Apostles he put forth, to which Satan against his
Will was forced to give way, and was (as it were) cast down from the height of
that power which he exercised over men.

In [ Heaven,] we are also to consider the Ornaments of it, as the luminaries
as they are called, Genesis 1.14. The Sun, Moon, and Stars which are the Organs of
Light, -- The Sun and Moon constantly shining do metaphorically denote eternal
blessedness in Heaven. Thy Sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy Moon
withdraw it self -- Esa. 60.20. the explication follows, For the Lord shall be
thine Everlasting Lights, and the days of thy Mourning shall be ended. See Rev.
22.5. Such things as concern the state of the Church in this Life, and Heaven
are mixed in this chapter of Esaiah, as an accurate inspection into it, will
show. The Chald. in Translating these words of the Sun and Moon, does (not
unelegantly) expound them thy Kingdom shall no longer be abolished, nor thy
Glory transferred. The Light of the Sun denotes prosperity, as shall be showed
hereafter; therefore on the contrary the setting or darkness of the Sun
metaphorically denotes calamity, sorrow and misery, Jer. 15.9. Her Sun is gone
down while it was yet day. Chald. their glory is translated in their Life time
-- that unexpected and most heavy calamities are treated of here, the foregoing
and following verses show. Amos 8.9. I will cause the Sun to go down at Noon,
and I will darken the Earth in a clear day, that is, I will suddenly overwhelm
you with heavy strokes and calamities. So Micah 3.6. Joel 2.10. and 3.4. Esa.
13.10. On the other side an Increase of the Sun and Moons Light, metaphorically
signifies great spiritual happiness, Esa. 30.26. The light of the Moon shall be
as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as the
light of seven days, etc. As if he had said, the help which I will afford you
shall be so great and illustrious, that in that time the two luminaries of the
World the Sun and Moon (as if they would congratulate the Deliverance of the
People) will be more cheerful and more shining then they were wont to be. Some
refer this to an Hyperbole.

By the Name of [ Stars] illustrious and principal men are understood, Dan.
8.10. And it (viz. that little horn by which Antiochus is understood) waxed
great even to the Host of Heaven, and it cast down some of the Host and of the
Stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. By the Host of Heaven the People of
God or the Church sometimes circumscribed in Judea is understood; but by Stars,
the Princes or chief men, who by their administration in the Church or
Commonwealth were of more eminency then others, are noted, hence in ver. 24. it
is so expounded, he shall destroy the mighty and the holy people -- that is, he
shall destroy the highest and the lowest. See 1 Macchab. 1.25.

2. By the Name of [ Stars] the Teachers of the Word of God, and Church Rulers
are figured, Rev. 1.15, 20. and 2.1. Which consideration fairly leads us to
know.

A parallel between Stars and Ministers of the Gospel.
(1.) Their Lord and Master, whose Countenance is said to shine as the Sun in
its strength, Rev. 1.16.

1. As the Sun communicates his light to the Stars in Heaven: So Christ the Sun
of Righteousness, Mal. 4.2. imparts the light of saving knowledge to his
faithful Servants, 2 Cor. 4.6.

2. The Lord brings forth the Host of the Stars by number, and calls them all
by Names, Esa. 40.26. So Christ leads forth his Ministers in his Church as a
sacred Host, against Satan and the World, and calls them also by Name, Ps.
68.11.

(2.) Their Office: God placed the Stars in the Firmament, to enlighten the
Earth, Genesis 1.17.

3. The light of Doctrine which the Ministers bring to the Church is from
heaven, and taken out of the heavenly and divine Word alone, 2 Pet. 1.16.19.
which is sweeter then honey to the souls of such as are taught of God, Psalm.
19.10. Psalm. 119*103. but to others as Wormwood, Rev. 8.11. Because they taste
nothing but bitterness and a denunciation of damnation in it.

4. A Star led the wise men to Christ, Matthew. 2.9. -- Ministers propose only
that end in Preaching, 1 Cor. 2.2.

5. It is said that at the Commandment of the Holy One, Eccles. 43.10.
they (viz. the Stars) will stand in their order, and never faint in their
Watches -- Of the Ministers of the Word it is said Heb. 13.17. That they watch
for the Souls of men -- Nor ought they to be discouraged in their Watches, nor
faint because of the Worlds ingratitude, but both by doctrine and good example
to keep the same order constantly, and so, they shall be quite different from
these wandering Stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever,
Jude ver. 13. They are to take care that all things be done decently and in
order in the Church, 1 Cor. 14.40.

6. It is said of the Stars that they fought from Heaven, against the Enemies
of the People of God. Judge 5.20. So a most grievous fight against Devils is
proposed to the Ministers of the word, Ephesians. 6.12. Let them look to it
therefore, that they manage their warfare rightly, 2 Cor. 10.3, 4, 5. That they
may be able to Glory in the Lord, for the heavenly reward that will follow, 2 Timothy 4.7, 8.

7. It is said of the Stars, that together with the Sun and Moon they divide
between the day and between the night, and are for Signs, and for seasons, and
for days and for years, Genesis 1.14. -- So it is the duty of Gospel Ministers to
divide between the day and night, light and darkness, that is, to inculcate and
diligently show the difference between good and evil, piety, and wickedness,
Esa. 5.20. Jer. 15.19. Romans 13.12, 13. 2 Cor. 6.14, 15. etc. Also to give signs
and seasons, that is, to provide so as that the public worship of God be kept
up timely and seasonably, and in their Ministerial function to impart their
gifts suitable to the wants of the flock in the respective seasons, that so
there may be no disorder or confusion -- to show also days and nights, that is,
to proclaim the acceptable year of our Lord, Esa. 61.2* and earnestly to
inculcate the appointed day in which the Lord will Judge the World in
Righteousness, Acts 17.31.

8. It is said of the Stars that they differ from one another in Glory -- So
there is a great diversity of the gifts of the spirit in the Ministers of the
Word, 1 Cor. 12:4. etc.

9. All the Stars of light are commanded to praise God, Psalm. 148.3. with Job
38.7. -- So all the Ministers of the word, what measure of Grace soever they
have received, or whatsoever gift they exercise in the Church, ought with
ardency of spirit to praise the Lord, to serve him heartily, and without
selfishness or envy to preserve mutual Peace and Concord among themselves, and
their reward shall be certain if they behave themselves faithfully, and not
only in this world, but also in Eternity.

10. Stars were seen by John worn in the Right hand of Christ, Rev. 1.20. -- So
let the faithful Laborers in the Gospel be certain of a most gracious
protection by the omnipotent hand of Christ, Esa. 51.16. etc. and in the Life
to come they that turn many unto Righteousness shall shine, as the Stars for
ever and ever, Dan. 12.3.

So much for Ecclesiastical Stars; -- The Stars being obscured, sometimes
denote Calamity, Esa. 13.10. Ezekiel. 32.7. Joel 2.10. as was said before of the
Sun and Moon.

The brightest Star that shines in our view is called in Greek (...), (
phosporos) in Latin Lucifer, both which words signify a bringer of light, in
Hebrew it is called (...) of the root (...) ( halal) which signifies to shine;
and is metaphorically translated to describe the unexpected ruin and overthrow
of the King of Babylon, Esa. 14.12. How art thou fallen from Heaven O Lucifer
Son of the morning That Star is called Son of the Morning, because while it
accompanies the morning it seems, as it were, to be born of it. Its course is
perpetual and constant, so that it was not feared that it should fall from
Heaven -- And therefore to appearance it seemed impossible and incredible that
so great a King, illustrious and splendid in power and Majesty beyond other
Kings (as the Morning Star is before other Stars) should fall from his lofty
and magnificent grandeur. Pope Gregory upon Ezekiel, and other School Doctors
expound this of the Devils fall, because the Prince of Devils is called Lucifer
-- But this Epithet does not belong to that malignant spirit in this place, for
God himself confirms our explication, ver. 4. saying, thou shall take up this
Parable, (Proverb, or Taunting speech for so the Hebrew is) against the King of
Babylon, not against the Devil, etc. Where Christ our Savior is called
Lucifer, is expounded before in the chapter that treats of an Anthropopathy
Besides the phrase (...), (after proinos) stella matutina, the Morning Star is
a symbol of the glorious light in Eternity, Rev. 2.28. See also Dan. 12.3. 1
Cor. 15.41, 42.

Metaphors taken from Light.
THere are two principal effects of the Luminaries and ornaments of Heaven,
viz. to give light to the World, and distinguish times. In Metaphors taken from
light we will distinctly treat of Nouns and Verbs, which are sometimes joined
together.

Generally light is taken,

1. For Life it self, Job 3.20. Wherefore (has God) given light to the
miserable, (so the Hebrew) the explication follows, and Life to the bitter in
soul, ver. 21. Which long for Death, but it comes not. Hence comes the phrase
to see the Light, that is, to live, or be born alive, Job 3.16. To walk in the
light of the living, that is, to act amongst the living, or to live, either a
corporal or spiritual Life in God, Ps. 56.13. So David prays, Ps. 13.3. Lighten
mine Eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of Death.

2. For any prosperity and joy of mind arising from thence, Esth. 8.16. The
Jews had light and gladness, and Joy and Honor, where the synonymous terms
make out that it signifies the eminency of the Jews prosperity, and joy for
their Divine deliverance, Job 29.3. By his light I walked through darkness,
that is, being free from Calamities I led a happy Life, ver. 24. The light of
my countenance they cast not down, that is, they grieved me not, but studied to
please and gratify me in all things, Psalm. 97.11. Light is sown for the
Righteous, the explication follows, and gladness for the upright in heart. The
word sowing is also emphatical, as if he had said, it is reposited and hidden as
seed is in the ground, but in its own time it will certainly come forth. See
Esa. 61.11. Col. 3.3, 4. It is sow'n with the seed of the heavenly word, and a
most full and bright harvest of this celestial seed will follow in the
Resurrection to eternal Life. So light is also taken, Psalm. 112.4. Pro. 13.9.
Esa. 45.7. and 58.8. and 59.9. The Reason of the comparison in this and the
forgoing passage is to be fought in the profitableness, and pleasure of light,
Eccl. 11.7. etc.

3. For the open and manifest state of things, Matthew. 10.27. What I tell you in
Darkness, that speak ye in the light, another Metaphor of this publication
follows, and what ye hear in the ear, that Preach ye upon the house tops. The
sense is, you are therefore called by me, that you may Preach publicly to the
whole World, what you privately heard from me. So Zeph. 3.5. John 3.21. 1 Cor.
4.5.

4. For Grace, Benevolence or Favor, Prove. 16.15. In the Light of the Kings
Countenance is Life, the exposition follows, and his favor is as a cloud of
the latter Rain. So it is taken of God as was said in the chapter of an
Anthropopathy.

More especially the mystery of Regeneration, Renovation, and Salvation, is
frequently expressed by the metaphor of light, and that respecting,

1. The Organical cause, which is the word of God, which is frequently called
so, by a Reason deduced from the quality of light, which represents the
difference and knowledge of things to the Eyes, Psalm. 43.3. Prove. 6.23. Esa.
2.5. -- 5.20. 2 Cor. 4.6. 1 John 2.8. Thus the Apostles because of their
Preaching the word of God are called the light of the World, Matthew. 5.14. and
their light is said to shine before men, ver. 16. that is, the light of
Doctrine by diligent Preaching, as also the light of a good life and example.

2. The Formal Cause, which is the saving knowledge of Christ and true Faith
manifested by love and good Works, Act, 26.18. Ephesians. 5.8. 1 Pet. 2.9. 1 John
1.7. Hence believers are called Sons of light, Luke 16.8. Ephesians. 5.8. 1 These.
5.5. And good works the Armor of light, Romans 13.12.

3. The Final Cause, and the last scope and effect of Faith, which is life
eternal often noted by the term of Light, Esa. 60.19, 20, John 8.12. Act.
26.23. 2 Timothy 1.10. etc. From these there may be an easy Judgment made of
certain Verbs belonging to light.

Psalm. 13.3. Lighten mine Eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of Death. Verbs.
He prays for the light of heavenly wisdom from the Word of God, also the light
of watchfulness and circumspection, whereby he may avoid the snares of the
Adversary. He alludes to humane sleep which easily overcomes those that sit in
darkness, or shut their Eyes -- whereas if the light shines in our Eyes we can
hardly sleep.

Psalm. 19.8. The Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the Eyes, that
is, the mind, by giving understanding and knowledge as well of the Divine Will,
as of our own corruption, and prudence in the management of affairs, that a man
may not belike a brute, which is void of rational intellectuals; Psalm. 34.6.
They looked on him and were enlightened, that is, believers were made glad by
the Lord by his gracious and saving deliverance, lest they should be dejected
and derided by the wicked. See Prove. 4.18, 19. Eccl. 8.1. with 2 Cor. 3.18.
Esa. 60.5. John 7.37, 38, 39.

John 1.9. That (viz. Christ) was the true light, which lights every man that
comes (or coming) into the World -- Upon these words Erasmus very fairly
paraprases. In this darkness of the World, men eminent for holiness shined, as
little Stars in the thick obscurity of night, and as it were through a Cloud
showed some light, but only to the Jews and the adjacent parts. But this true
light imparted its splendour not to a single Nation only but to all men, that
come into this dark World -- He came, that by a Gospel Faith he should shine in
and give light to the Hearts of all men in the World -- No Scythian, no Jew, no
Spaniard, no Goth, no Britain, is excluded, neither King nor Servant. There is
a sufficiency of light for all, and if they remain in darkness. it is not the
lights fault but their own, who perversely love darkness and abhor the light --
He shines to all* lest any one should have a pretext of excuse; for if they
perish, they do it wilfully and knowingly, as if one would dispute against the
Sunshine at Noon, and will not lift up his Eyes to be confuted, etc. 2 Cor.
4.6. There is an eminent description of spiritual illumination. See Ephesians. 3.8, 9.

To light by way of privation is opposed sometimes a [ Shadow, Shadow.
] which is light hindered from a total shining, by the interposition of some
body. This metaphorically signifies protection and defense against adversaries
of any sort, as a shade defends from the Suns intemperate aed scorching heat,
Esa. 16.3. -- 30.2, 3. Lam. 4.20. etc. For so it is attributed to God as before
chap. 8. toward the end.

But where the Ceremonies and Types of the Old Testament are called Shadows
with respect to Christ, Col. 2.17. Heb. 10.1. It is not to be understood that
they are naturally so, but artificially and like a picture, for Painters first
draw a shadow or or an umbratile kind of delineation, and afterward perfect
their picture with lively colors, the former vanishing out of sight. So it was
with the sacrifices and Ceremonies of the Ancients, which figured Christ, and
ceased when he came -- which explication is evident by the opposition of
Shadows, and the very Image of things, Heb. 10.1.

Sometimes, Mists, Fogs, and Darkness are opposed to light, which hide the
splendour and beauty of things, and hinder men from making, a right distinction
separation or definition of objects, begetting disturbance and confusion in the
mind, and contain in themselves nothing pleasing or laudable and therefore
signify evil in Scripture. But because there is the same Reason of contraries,
(which mutually answer each other) we shall be able by the consideration of
light, to pass a judgment upon its opposite.

1. As light signifies Life, so darkness and a shadow metaphorically denote
Death; Job 10.21. Before I go, whence I shall not return, to the land of
darkness, and the shadow of Death: ver. 22. A Land of darkness, as the
gloominess of the shadow of Death and without order and it shines as darkness.
This is a periphrasis of Death and the Grave. -- Psalm. 88.12. Shall thy wonders
be known in the dark? See ver. 10.11. and Job 28.3.

2. As light signifies Prosperity and Joy; so darkness denotes evils,
unhappiness and calamity, and consequently that sorrow, mourning, and grief
that follows. See Job 5.14. -- 15.22. -- 17.12. -- 18.5, 6. Psalm. 44.19. and
88.18. and 143.3. Esa. 5.30. -- 47.5. -- 50.10. -- 59.9. Jerem. 8.21. -- 13.16.
Lam. 3.2, 6. Ezekiel. 32.8. Joel 2.2. -- 3.4. Amos 5.18. Micah 7.8. Nahum. 1.8.
Zeph. 1.15. etc.

3. As light is put for that which is manifest and apparent, so darkness is put
for that which is hidden, secret and unknown, Job 12.22. Eccl. 6.4. Esa. 45.19.
Matthew. 10.27. See John 3.20, 21. Ephesians. 5.11, 12.13. So obscure, or the meanest
sort of men, is put for such as are of no eminent note or fame, Prove. 22.29.

More especially as the mystery of Regeneration and the restoring of man to
Eternal Salvation is expressed by light, so by opposition darkness denotes a
state of corruption, sin, and damnation, and that also with respect to,

(1.) The Organical cause, which is the Truth revealed in the word of God, in
which respect, darkness signifies errors, lies and perverse doctrines, Esa.
5.20. and 9.2. and 60. (with 2, 3.) John 12.35. Romans 1.21, 22. Although by way
of consequence the things which follow are also noted in these places.

(2.) The Formal Cause, which is the knowledge of Christ, and Faith which works
by piety. -- in which respect darkness signifies infidelity and an indulgence
in sin, Psalm. 82.5. Prove. 2.13. John 1.5. and 3.19. Act. 26.18. Romans 13.12. 2
Cor. 6.14. Ephesians. 4.17, 18, 19. and 5.8, 11. 1 John 1.6. and 2.9, 11. Although
the antecedent member is also noted in these sayings, all infidelity, impiety,
and sins arising from ignorance and errors in Doctrine.

(3. The Final Cause and last effect; in this respect darkness signifies
eternal death and damnation, Matthew. 8.12. and 22.13. 2 Pet. 2.4. Jude ver. 6.
And whereas the Devil is the Author of all those evils, he with his whole
infernal Society are called the power of Darkness, Luke 22.53. Ephesians. 6.12. Col.
1.13.

Metaphors taken from Time.
THE other effect of the luminaries of Heaven, is the differencing of Time,
from which differences some Metaphors are deduced.

Day.
(1.) A [Day] is taken for the profit and benefit of the time allotted or
granted by God, 1 Samuel 25.8. We come in a good Day, that is, seasonable and for
our profit, your preparation and store being such as that you can relieve our
want, John 9.4. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day,
that is, while the allotted season lasts, for that purpose given by Heaven.
Upon which Erasmus paraphrases, I am therefore sent into the World, that I
should by Deeds of this kind purchase Glory for God, by convincing unbelievers
that I speak true, that they may believe, and be cured of their blindness. This
Command I must diligently follow, while it is day; for men that have any thing
to do, work by day, the night being unseasonable for labor, in the mean while
therefore, while the present day affords an opportunity of acting what is
necessary for the obtaining of eternal Life I must not give over. For the Night
is coming wherein men neither will nor can work. See Luke 13.31, 33. John 11.9,
10. and 12.35. Romans 13.11, 12, 13. 2 Cor. 6.2.

2. For the knowledge of God and the season of grace, Romans 13.12. The night is
far spent, the day is at hand -- Here is an opposition between an unconverted
state, which is compared to night, and a state of Conversion to the Kingdom of
Christ, which he calls Day, for the reason before given, 1 Thessalonians. 5.5, 8. Ye
are the Children of light, and children of the day: We are not of the Night,
nor of darkness -- But let us who are of the day be sober -- In this text there
is an elegant Antanaclasis -- for the word Day, ver. 2.4. is to be understood
of the day of Judgment, and ver. 5. of the gift of Gospel restoration by
Christ, to which ver. 7. the mention of the natural night opposite to the Day
is subjoyned, 2 Pet. 1.19. until the Day-dawn arise, etc. here life and eternal
Glory seem to be noted, that in the words of the Apostle there may be an
opposition between this Life, and that which is to come, this life being
compared to an obscure place which needs a Candle to light it (which Candle is
the Prophetical Revelations) but life to come is compared to a clear Day, in
which Christ our (...), ( phosporos or) light-bringer shall illuminate the Eyes
of believers with a most full and bright radiance. And thus the great
perfection of the Prophetical Scriptures (as also of the Apostolical, which are
exactly conformable to them, and as it were an explanatory light to them) is
proved, because most sufficient (with the help of Divine Grace,) for the
obtaining of Everlasting life, etc.

The parts of the day are the Morning, Noon, and Evening, Psalm. 55.17. Evening
and Morning and at Noon will I pray, etc. The morning season metaphorically
denotes diligence, sedulity and care, because men rise early to go about such
business as they are careful of, and are much upon their hearts, Job 8.5. Psalm.
5.3. and 92.2. and 101.8. Prove. 8.17. 2 Chronicles. 36.15. Jer. 35.4. Zeph. 3.5, 7.
The Watchman said the morning comes, and also the Night, etc. Morning
Some understand that the morning is here put put for Prosperity, as if he had
said to Dumah or the Idumeans, The yoke of the Israelites being shaken off of
thy Neck (as it is said, Genesis 27.42. You shall enjoy liberty, prosperity, and
plenty of good things: But another Calamity hangs over thee from the Assyrian
by which, as with the darkness of night thou shall be obscured. Others take the
word morning properly, but not unlike the former sense; the morning indeed
comes, (as ye ask ver. 11. Watchmen what of the night? that is, when shall the
day-dawn come? And what will happen then?) But together with it, that night
comes, which is more dark and terrible. For when the days are calamitous, there
arises with the Sun, as it were, a new light, yet ending in a night more full
of calamity then the former. Illyricus, says, Although the Morning properly
taken will come, yet the metaphorical morning will not come, but it will be a
metaphorical Night.

The Chald. takes it metaphorically, but applies it more generally; thus it
paraphrases the whole verse -- The Prophet said there is a reward provided) for
the just and vengeance for the wicked, if you will repent, do it, while you may.

Esa. 47.11. Therefore shall evil come upon thee, the morning thereof thou
know not (so the Hebrew) that is, whose sudden coming or beginning thou that
shall not at first mind, as in the morning betimes, the Sun rises, and darts
out its beams upon a sudden. Some think that the Prophet derides the vanity of
the Chaldean Astrologers. Others thus, the morning or day break gives an
indication of the Suns coming, so this evil that was to come upon Babylon was
not without its marks and tokens that went before it, which were as illustrious
as the dawn that ushers in or harbingers the day. But not known to Babylon
because of its blindness and conceited security, Hos. 10.15. In a morning shall
the King of Babylon be utterly cut off, that is, swiftly and suddenly. He
speaks of Hosea the Son of Elah, 2 Kings 17.1, 5. etc.

This term moreover denotes divine grace to believers, because of the beauty
and sweetness of the springing and arriving light. Ps 110.3. From the womb of
the morning, etc.
For as the morning brings the beginning of day light after the tedious sadness
of a dark night, and is no little comfort to them (especially if sick) that are
weary of darkness, and earnestly long for day, so the grace of divine
consolation does wonderfully recreate and refresh the hearts of such as are
troubled and afflicted, etc. Of which take two examples, Psalm. 110.3. From the
Womb of the morning, thou have the Dew of -- Of which place many have said many
things. It is certainly to be expounded by a metaphor, denoting the Grace of
God given in his Word, which is compared to the Morning, Esa. 58.8. Hosea. 6.3.
A Womb is attributed to the morning, because of the mystery of God in his
spiritual begetting of his Children -- The unfolding of this Trope is thus, as
the Dew by a wonderful and invisible way, as it were, born of the Womb of the
morning, that is, it plentifully falls at that time, without any help or
assistance of man, Job 38.28. So by the grace and mercy of God, and by the
power of his heavenly word, (but in a far more abstruse and mystical manner)
the youth of the Messiah, that is, that willing people in the day of his power.
and in the beauties of holiness, of which the Psalmist speaks in the same
verse. See Psalm, 22.30, 31. Ps. 87.4, 5. Esa. 53.10. and 54.1. Micah 5.7. John
1.12, 13. and 3.5, 8. Jam. 1.18. etc.

Esa. 8.20. Who have no Morning etc.
The other place is Esa. 8.20. where the morning is put for the grace of God,
and that comfort and peace of spirit which flows from it, the words in Hebrew
are, because there is no morning in him -- But Interpreters do not agree
whether this is to be understood of men, or the perverse Doctrines of such as
consulted them that pretended to foretell things to come, by a devilish or
familiar Spirit. If it be referred to men, it bears this sense -- To the Law
and to the Testimony: If they speak not according to this word, they shall have
no morning that is true light. This is true in it self, but the letter of the
text is not altogether conformable to it, for it is not in the plural to them,
but in the singular to him (or it.) But others expound this text better thus --
Note that this explication of the Hebrew text which is word for word as here
Englished.
[ To the Law and the Testimony] that is, recourse must be had, thither for the
Law and Testimony must be consulted according to the Will of God, [ otherwise]
(that is, if they do not speak the truth of Divine Grace there) [ let them
speak,] an Ironical concession joined with indignation: let them speak, because
they will not do otherwise, though seriously and frequently admonished, let
them speak (I say) according to this word, (viz.) in which there is no morning]
that is, no light of Divine Grace or Comfort, ver. 21. And let him pass through
it (the Earth) hardly bestead and hungry (the singular for the plural) and it
shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves,
and curse their King and their God, etc.

Now whereas the Prophet calls this speech of that wicked People, (viz. that
they were to seek Council of them that had familiar Spirits, etc. and not of
the Law and Testimony) a word without a morning, or void of the light of divine
Grace and Consolation, it certainly follows according to the intention of the
Prophet, that that morning of Grace and Comfort is to be found in that word of
the Law and Testimony alone, with sure and safe counsel in Tribulations and
Afflictions, which to distressed minds is like the morning sweetness, or the
pleasure of a lovely dayspring. Such as neglect or reject this Word, walk in
darkness, and are involved in errors, and perish everlastingly. The other
Interpretation in substance agrees with this.

[ Noon] is taken for things most evident, Deuteronomy. 28.29. The Latins have a
Proverb, meridiana lux, Noon light, which is put for a most clear and evident
thing. There is a comparison with the Noon time, when there is mention made of
the light and splendour of felicity, Job 11.17. And (thy) time shall arise above
the Noon day, (so the Hebrew) that is, thy most illustrious Glory shall shine
all round or about thee. See Psalm. 37.6.

The [ Evening] is elegantly opposed to the [ Morning,] when the speech is of
the vicissitude of Calamities and Comforts which God observes in Believers,
Psalm. 30 5. Weeping may endure for a night (or as the Hebrew, may lodge for an
Evening) but joy (comes) in the Morning: that is, the Godly are compelled to
weep in the darkness of the Cross and Sufferings, but the most joyful morning
and light of Divine help will come again. See John 16.20, 22. Psalm. 126.5, 6.
So the word Vesperascens drawing toward an Evening, is used for ceasing, Esa.
24.11. The Sunsetting in the Evening leaves the darkness of night to succeed
it, so when joy ceases it leaves Calamity and Mourning.

To the day is opposed [ Night] by the same Reason almost as darkness is, Night.
which in a Moonless Night and cloudy sky invade us, Job 17.12. They change the
Night into day: The light (they said) is near because of darkness; he speaks of
his thoughts, which ver. ^^1. he called the possessions of his heart, because
of his hope and expectation of good as Christ commands us, Luke 21.19. In
patience (and hope) to possess our souls -- Therefore he said that his Thoughts
or Possessions of his heart were broken of, denoting that all hope of good
perished; and then adds that the same cogitations turned night into day, and
that light was near (with respect to those dark dispensations --) that is, he
certainly hoped that those Calamities (which he compares to an obscure night)
should be turned into prosperity, which he shows by the word Day, and that the
light of long expected peace is near. This explication agrees with what
follows, ver. 13. If I wait, the Grave is mine house, etc. ver. 15. And where
is now my hope? As for my hope who shall see it? ver. 16. They shall go down to
the bars of the pit, when (our) rest together is in the dust: As if he had
said, my expected hopes together with my body shall ere long be carried to the
Grave, and expire with this Life, Job 35.10. But he said not where is God thy
maker? Who gives Songs in the Night; that is, who in adversity gives help and
deliverance, for which Praise and Glory becomes due to him. See Micah 3.6. etc.

Sometimes the Night signifies the Reign or Dominion of Impiety and Hell, Romans
13.12. But what we find, 1 These. 5 7. ( For they that sleep, sleep in the
Night, and they that are drunken are drunken in the Night,) is understood by
some of natural sleep and night, but others interpret it of spiritual sleep,
that is, carnal security in wickedness ( Romans 13.11. Ephesians. 5.14.) and the night
of infernal power. Erasmus in his paraphrase elegantly joins both, and thus
unfolds this Apostolical text -- The Day (of the last Judgment) is to be
dreaded by those, who are blinded by vice, and lead a life like Nights -- But
you that are Brethren are not to fear it, because it shall not find you
unprovided; for all you that follow Christ do not belong to the Kingdom of
darkness but to the Kingdom of light and God, especially if in piety and
reality ye walk close to the rule of your Profession, and so live as that it
may appear, that ye watch in the light and not snort in darkness. There if we
would not be oppressed, let us not sleep as others do who have not known the
light of Christ: But let us be watchful and sober, having always a circumspect
mind, that we admit not any thing through incogitancy, which may prove
offensive to the Eyes of God or men. For as such as sleep a natural sleep, do
it by night, and such as be drunk with wine, are usually so in the night; so
they that sleep in sin, are involved in darkness of mind, and such as are drunk
with carnal desires and delights (so called) are entangled in the mists of a
dark mind. But it becomes us to whom the light of the Gospel day has shined,
to be sober and watchful, etc.

Metaphors taken from Fire.
SO much for Heaven and what belongs to it. We shall now treat of the Elements
which are four, viz. Fire, Air, Water and Earth, and produce what metaphors
are taken from them. The Metaphors taken from Fire shall be considered with
respect to its quality and effects, viz.

1. Its clearness, purity, splendour and other Attributes, and in that respect
it is translated to Angels, Psalm. 104.4. Heb. 1.7. Fire in its efficacy of
acting and penetrating, in agility and celerity is eminent before other
Creatures of God, which qualities may be fitly applied to those holy Ministers
of God. The Fire always moves upwards: So all the actions of Angels tend to the
Glory of God. By a flame of Fire, Charity or Love is signified, Eccl. 8.6.
Angels are wholly inflamed with a Divine Love.

From Fire Angels are called, (...) Seraphim, that is, flaming or fiery from
(...) Saraph, in Latin, incendit, cremavit, in English, he burnt. Arias
Montanus In lib. Joseph. S^^de ar^^ano S^^rmone page 13.
says that Seraphim signifies purity from any spot, filth, or heaviness, for so
Fire is, and therefore those Ministers of God, which Esaias saw to have a
purging and purifying efficacy, in their divine ministrations for the profit of
men, Esa. 6. ver. 3.6, 7. In that Vision one of the Seraphims exercised his
purifying virtue, by applying the external symbol of a live Coal to the
Prophets Lips. Musculus in his Comment says, That this Vision of Angels
standing about the Lord sitting in his Throne, was in Fire, that they may be
called burning (Seraphims) which is very suitable to the thing in agitation.
The Lord was angry with his wicked and rebellious people. To judge whom he sat
in his judicatory Throne. And therefore as that great Session and Tribunal is
an argument of his wrath, so the fiery appearance of his ministering Angels
betokens his dreadful Anger, for that conflagration which was to consume the
wicked, was then and there a burning.

2. [ Fire] also denotes the Word of the Gospel of Christ published among the
Gentiles, Luke 12.49. In treating of this we must have respect to the virtue
and efficacy of Fire -- as well to its shining and enlightening quality (wherein
it agrees with what we said about light which betokens conversion and the
mystery of Salvation) as also its kindling quality, for the Word of Christ
kindles the Love of God, Holiness, and heavenly desires in the Hearts of men,
to which is referred Jer. 20.9. Luke 24.32. And the appearance of the Holy
Spirit in the likeness of Fire, Acts 2.3. Matthew. 3.11. And lastly its consuming
and destroying quality -- For the Word of Christ shall consume all its
adversaries, Judge, Condemn, and Destroy them, John 12.48. To which may be
reduced, Jer. 5.14. and 23.29. To this Divine Fire, there seems to be another
strange Fire opposed (as in the Type, Lev. 10.1.) viz. of false Doctrine and
humane Traditions, Esa. 50.11. Behold all ye that kindle a Fire, that compass
your selves about with sparks; walk in the light of your Fire, and in the
sparks that ye have kindled, etc. Junius and Tremellius upon the place say --
That Christ in this place convinces the proud Spirit of the Pharisees, and
almost the whole Jewish Church of impiety, because in their spiritual darkness
they went about to kindle lights for themselves, neglecting the light of Gods
Word, and that Gospel illumination which Christ offered them, etc. They
esteemed that a profitable Fire and light, which really brought the Fire of
divine Wrath and Eternal Damnation upon them.

3. Because of its burning quality Fire is attributed to them who bring
perdition, hurt, loss, or utter destruction; hence Fire is said to be before
God the just Judge, and avenger of his Enemies, Psalm. 50.3. and 97.3. Esa.
26.11. and 29.6. and 30.33. and 66.15, 16, 24. 2 These. 1.7, 8. But there is no
doubt but in these and other places respect is had to Hellfire, Clav. Script.
p. 404.
of which Illyricus says, in the description of Hell and Eternal punishments,
the Scripture frequently inculcates that there is an Eternal and unquenchable
Fire or Brimstone, whether there be really any material Fire, or that something
bitter and direful is metaphorically signified is left to inquiry, because in
this Life there is nothing more violent, more tormenting or more terrible then
a raging and prevailing Fire. -- But it is far better to endeavor the avoiding
of that hellish Fire, then in a Spirit of Contention to be too curiously
inquisitive into its Nature.

Hither must be referred those places where by the term ( Fire) we are to
understand invading Enemies and desolating Wars, Psalm. 78.63. Esa. 42.25. Jer.
48.45. and 50.32. Ezekiel. 21.32. and 30.8 (in which place the Chaldee for Fire,
puts a people strong like fire) Amos 1.4, 7, 10, 12, 14. and 2.2, 5. Some think
there may be a Synecdoche, because Wars for the most part are managed by Fire
and Flame.

It is also attributed to other things, by means of which terror, hurt, and
death are brought upon any, as Judge. 9.15, 20. Esa. 33.11, 12. Obad. ver. 18.
James 3.5, 6. Jude ver. 23. See Prove. 26.23. and compare Jer. 51.58. Heb. 2.13.
Joel 1.20. together.

4. It agrees to this, that Fire generally denotes any adversities which are
the effects of Divine Wrath, as also Calamities and Afflictions, as Psalm.
66.12. and 140.10. Esa. 9.18, 19. and 10.16. and 24.6.15. and 43.2. Lam. 1.13.
and 4.11. By which signification sometimes respect is had to the purifying
quality of Fire, for God tries and cleanses believers by Crosses and
Calamities, as Gold is tried in the Fire, Zach. 13.9. 1 Pet. 4.12. See also
Psalm. 17.3. and 66.10. 1 Pet. 1.6, 7. To this also are the two following texts
referred, Mark 9.49. For every one shall be salted with Fire, and every
sacrifice shall be salted with salt -- The particle (...) ( kai) and is
frequently put for as, or, even as, -- It is therefore an inversed similitude
which is to be resolved in this sense -- As every sacrifice in the Old
Testament was wont to be salted with salt by the appointment of God, Lev. 2.13.
So every man that would avoid sin, (or offenses) and Hellfire, the consequence
of it (as appears by the foregoing verses, which have a co-herence with this)
must be salted with a certain wholesome Fire, that is, seasoned by Crosses and
Afflictions: Or, this Fire will have the same efficacy on him, as salt has on
flesh, viz. to preserve him from the putrefaction of security in sin. Elegantly
therefore is salting attributed to Fire, and both are joined to denote the
Mystery of the Cross: Because there is an agreement betwixt those two, both
causing pain, and both abstracting and consuming that which is corrupt or
putrifyed; as also because they were joined together in sacrifices* Scaliger in
his notes thinks that this should be read (...) that is, every sacrifice shall
be salted, that it may be the same with what follows, (...), every oblation
shall be salted with salt, because Lev. 2.13. There is a Repitition of the same.

The other place is 1 Cor. 3.13, 14, 15. Upon which Chemnitius thus expresses
himself -- There is a Fire of probation (or trial) sent by God, either by
outward Troubles, or inward Temptations, or by a clearer manifestation of Truth
by the Word, that they, should not remain in the darkness of Error and
Ignorance, who hold the fundamental Articles of Truth, but that such opinions
as are disagreeable to the Foundation shall be purged away, either in Life, or
at the hour of Death. Some by the terms Day and Fire, understand Truth shining
from the Word of God by the Holy Spirit, and enlightening the mind, Mal. 3.3.
But others, the Day, and Fire, of the last Judgment, 2 These. ^^.8. Of which
obscure place, we are not concerned here to treat much. But the Reader may
peruse, Tom. 8. locorum. Theolog. Dn. D. Gerhardi, de morte Sect. 254. seqq.

To the Element of Fire belong other, Other Nouns.
things which bear Analogy or Relation to it, as well Nouns, as Verbs.

Of Nouns a [ Flame] by a metaphor signifies a bright and shining blade, or
plate of that form, as Judge. 3.22. 1 Samuel 17.7. (where what we Translate
Spearshead, is in the Hebrew spears-flame) So Job 39.3. The flame of the Spear
(we Translate it the glittering spear -- So also a (...)
Flame is attributed to the Sword which turned every way, with which the
Cherubims, (which were the keepers of Paradise) were armed Genesis 3.24. See Esa.
13.8. Cant. 8.6. Love is called the flame of the Lord, that is, such as the
Lord by the light of his Spirit kindles so, as that it shall last perpetually
-- And for its continual energy, because it always tends upwards, and darts its
splendour and increases that way, what are the properties of a natural Flame of
Fire, agree also to Love, Esa. 47.14. A Flame signifies most heavy punishments
inflicted by God.

[ Lanthorn, Candle, and Lamp,] (1.) Denote Prosperity, and a happy success of
things, Job 29.3. Psalm. 18.28. Hence the extinction or putting out of a Candle
or Lamp, signifies approaching adversities, Job 21.17. Prove. 13.9. -- 20.20.

(2.) It more especially denotes the happiness of a Kingdom or Government, 2 Samuel 21.17. Thou shall go no more out with us to Battle, that thou quench not
the Candle (or Lamp) of Israel -- the sense is, lest thou be'st slain, and the
Kingdom of Israel and its tranqui^^lity perish. So the conservation of David's
Kingdom in his Posterity is called a Lamp or Candle, 1 King. 11.36. and 15.4. 2
King 8 19. 2 Chronicles. 21.7. Psalm. 132.17. In which last place there is respect
had to Christ, the Heavenly King, and David's Son according to the Flesh. Some
refer to this head, Numb. 21.30. And their Lamp perished from Hesbon to Dibon
(so the Hebrew) that is, their Kingdom or Sovereignty.

(3.) This word is elegantly translated to signify the Word of God, Psalm.
119:105. Prove. 6.23. 2 Pet. 1.19. Of which we have treated before in the
chapter of an Anthropopathy* John the Baptist, that eminent Preacher of the
Word of God, and forerunner of Christ is called a burning and shining Candle,
John 5.35. For between him (who was a Candle lighted by the Divine Wisdom) and
Christ, the true light of the World there is a manifest difference put, John
1.8, 9. To this Notion, that passage which our Savior inculcates, Luke 12.35.
is very agreeable, viz. Let your Loins be girded about, and your Candles (so
the Greek) burning, by which phrase the serious study of Watchfulness and
Holiness is commanded, in pursuance to Gods prescriptions.

[ Burning Coals] sometimes denote Calamities, and grievous punishments, Psalm.
140.10. See Esa. 47.14. Sometimes they signify Lightning, Psalm. 18.8. An only
Son is called a Coal, 2 Samuel 14.7. Because as Coals raked up in ashes are (as
it were) a seed of Fire, so that one Son would be a means to propagate a
posterity and continue a Family, so that it should not be wholly extinguished,
Prove. 25.21. and Romans 12.20. It is said that when we do good to an Enemy we
heap Coals of Fire upon his head, that is, it will aggravate that guilt which
shall bring severer vengeance upon him because of his causeless and ungrateful
malice to such as do him good.

A [ Coal] is put for the Plague or any disease, that is, fiery and inflamed
like a burning Coals, Deuteronomy. 32.24. Hab. 35. For Arrows which grow hot by
motion, and pierce like Fire, Psalm 76.3. For Lightnings which burn like Coals,
Psalm. 78.48. And for Love that's very fervent, Cant. 8.6.

A [Fire-brand] (or burning wood taken out of the Fire that it should burn no
longer) sometimes denotes contempt, because of the privation of Fire and light)
as Esa. 7.4. Let not thy heart be tender (or faint) for the two tails of these
smoking Firebrarnds; as if he had said they are like Firebrands, which (when
extinguished) smoke but cannot burn. Neither are they barely called Firebrarnds,
but the tails of Firebrarnds, as if he had said, they are like brands that are
consumed even to the very ends or extremes, which have nothing but smoke the
remains of Fire, which shall speedily cease. So it is with Tyrants who oppose
Christ and his Gospel, who seem like great Fires to us that in a moment would
consume all; but to God and Faith, they are as the tails of smoking
Firebrarnds, who for all their threatening will in a miserable manner at length
be destroyed. Yet Jerome in his Comment upon this place gives another Reason
why the term tail (which is the extremest member or part of a Beast) is
attributed to these two Kings; viz. that in them should be ended the Kingdom of
Syria, that is, Damascus, and the Kingdom of Samaria, that is, of the ten
Tribes which by another Name were called Ephraim, according to what is related
2 Kings 15.29. -- 16.7, 8, 9. -- 17.5. and the following verses.

Sometimes it denotes divine deliverance from evil, as it were from Fire, Zach.
3.2. Is not this a Brand plucked out of the Fire? He speaks of Joshua the High
Priest, who by the Favor and Grace of God was delivered from the Babylonian
Captivity, came to Jerusalem, restored the Temple, and exercised the
Priesthood. See Amos 4.11. Jude ver. 23. etc. Job 12.5. Esa. 42.3.

[ Smoke] The excrement of Fire, and a sign of it is metaphorically put for
punishments inflicted by God, and Calamities, Esa. 14.31. There shall come from
the North a smoke -- the Chald. renders it vengeance, Revenge -- some
understand this speech of Vzziah with his Host, who subdued the Philistines, 2 Chronicles. 26.6, 7. But Jerome in his Comment upon the place by smoke understands
the King of Assyria, who amongst other Nations destroyed the Philistines, and
he quotes, Jer. 47.2.

Smoke is used to signify any Enemy, because it is very swift in invading,
very penetrating and searching, and can by none be resisted, and being a
certain token of Fire -- So the Fire of Gods Wrath once kindled smokes after
the same manner. See Psalm. 37.20. Esa. 65.5. -- 34.10. Rev. 14.11. Joel 3.3.
Acts 2.19. In which places Smoke is a symbol of Wrath and Divine punishments,
etc.

Some Verbs belong to this head as to be hot, which is an effect of Anger,
which (as Fire) inflames the heart, Deuteronomy. 19.6. Psalm. 39.5. and 57.4. The Anger
of a Godly man, proceeding from an holy zeal against sin is said to burn, 2
Cor. 11.29. The like is said of lustful and depraved affections, 1 Cor. 7.9. So
Virgil says, Est mollis flamma medullas, that is, a soft flame eats my Marrow,
and elsewhere et caeco carpitur igni, etc. -- The Syriack renders it, to burn
with lust.

Thus the Jews are said to inflame themselves with Idolatry, which is spiritual
Whoredom, Esa. 57.5. Whereby they are sharply reproved for their vehement
pursuit of Idolatry, which was like burning lust, whereby the Whore is inflamed
with desires after the Adulterer, whence ver. 3. they are called the Seed of
the Adulterer and Whore

To this may be referred what is spoken of Heretics forbidding the use of
Marriage viz. (...), Having their Consciences seared with an hot Iron, 1. Tim.
4.2. Which imports two things,

(1.) The Hurting and wounding of Conscience, as if he had said they teach and
compel others to observe such things, which they themselves very well know to
be not only impossible but wicked, and therefore their own Consciences reproach
and check them for the falsehood of what they deliver and impose, and hence in
the same verse, they are said to speak lies in Hypocrisy.

(2.) The Cause of that hurt, viz. the heats or burning of various lusts, for
both (as I said) are comprehended in that word, for it is derived of (...),
cauter, that is, an instrument whereby stigmatized persons are burnt: which
hurts and pains both flesh and skin; and the manner of it is by fire and
burning. Besides the Apostle seems to have respect to spiritual Infamy, which
cannot but, in a matter of so great moment wound the Conscience, as wicked men
that were stigmatized, carried a brand of Infamy about them. Ephesians. 6.16. Fiery
darts, are attributed to the Devil, by which inward Temptations and outward
Persecutions, scandals and sins stirred up by the Devil are intimated.

There is an emphasis in that word of Paul's Translated from Fire, 2 Timothy 1.6.
Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou (...), s^^^^tare ignem instar
sopiti, etc.
stir up the gift of God which is in thee, etc. The Greeks word properly
signifies to stir up Fire, lest it go out, that it may flame. Beza upon the
place says, The gift of God is a certain live flame kindled in our hearts which
the Flesh and Satan endeavor to suffocate or smother, but on the other side we
are so much the more concerned to cherish it, and stir it up when it is as it
were asleep. Where this Divine little flame is not stirred up, Love or Charity
waxes cold, Matthew. 24.12. And then the Fountain of Love, which is saving Faith,
and external Salvation is lost, etc. Thus Paul exhorts not to quench the
Spirit, 1 These. 5.19. The saving light of the knowledge of God kindled by the
Holy Spirit is extinguished by neglects of the Word of God and devout Prayer; by
security, impiety, and ingratitude, hence an exhortation to follow that which
was good ver. 15. and to pray without ceasing ver. 17. was premised; and
despising prophesyings, that is, the interpretation of the Word of God is
immediately prohibited, ver. 20.

The word (...) Zaraph, which properly signifies to melt Metals in order to
purify them from dross -- but is translated by an elegant Metaphor to signify
the purification and trial of the Godly, which is done by Crosses and
Sufferings. Whence the similitude of melted or burnt Metal is sometimes
expressly added, Psalm. 66.10. and 105.19. Esa. 1.25. Jer. 9.7. Dan. 11.35. Zach.
13.9. Hence the Furnace where Metals are melted and purified, is put for
Afflictions sent by God, Deuteronomy. 4.20. 1 Kings 8.51. Jer. 11.4. In which place
the Epithet of Iron is added to denote the tribulation, severity or cruel
nature of servitude.

A passage more notable than the rest we read, Esa. 48.10. Behold I have
refined thee, but not with Silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of
affliction; Jehovah intimates that he purges his people moderately and gently,
not as Silver or Gold are purged, because such are wont to be most exactly and
wholly melted in order to their purifying -- as if he had said, I do so temper
and qualify corrections, that I suit them rather to your weakness, then
proportion them to your Wickedness, I do not deal with you with the utmost
severity, for if you should be purged as Silver and Gold from all dross, you
should totally perish. See 1 Cor. 10, 13.

In general, it is put for the inward proof or trial of the heart which God
alone can do, Psalm. 26.2. and 17.3. See Prove. 17.3. It is put for outward
choice of some from others, which is done by an outward rise, Judge. 7.4. The
Word of God is said to be refined or as it were tried in the Fire, 2 Samuel 22.31.
Psalm. 18.30. Prove. 30.5. Psalm. 119.140. that is, most pure, most true, and most
certain. Which is emphatically declared, Psalm. 12.6. The words of the Lord are
pure words, as Silver tried in a furnace of Earth, purified seven times --
Which passage without doubt respects the quick and lively experience of the
Saints, in whose hearts the Truth of Gods word is experimentally felt and
approved to be of undoubted efficacy, by the Fire of tribulation. Whence some
by (Furnace of Earth) understand Godly men, in whom the Words of God are tried.
The Furnace burns in the Fire: The Godly are seasoned by the Fire of
Afflictions. By the same metaphor the Office of Christ is described. Mal. 3.2,
3.

Metaphors taken from Air.
THE Hebrew Word (...) Ruach a Spirit, signifies Air or Wind. And whereas the
motion of the Air is uncertain, inconstant and vanishing, and that there is
nothing solid or substantial in the Wind, therefore they are metaphorically put
to signify things that are vain and vanishing, Job 6.26. Do ye imagine to
reprove my words and (turn) the speeches of one that is desperate into Wind?
that is, do ye think that I utter vain words, and despise them as things of no
weight or sense, Job 15.2. Should a wiseman utter knowledge of Wind? that is,
vain as the Wind, which has nothing but an empty sound resolving into Wind --
he adds, or fill his belly with the East Wind? that is, admit vain and
fluctuating thoughts in his mind inwardly. Eccl. 5.16. What profit has he that
has labored for the Wind? that is, who has heaped together much riches, with
great labor which is in vain, when he can have no benefit or profit by them.
Jer. 5.13. The Prophets shall become wind, that is, as the Chald. renders it
vain, and of no worth, Jer. 22.22. The wind shall eat up all thy Pastors, that
is, they shall vanish and perish. So on the other side, It is said Hosea 12.1.
Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the East Wind -- the meaning is,
that the people of Israel shall feed upon a thing of nothing, viz. They shall
commit Idolatry, with great earnestness, which has no soul feeding virtue in it
(but the contrary) for it proves as pernicious as it is to follow the
East Wind; which is immediately expounded of their making Covenants with the
Assyrians, a wicked and Idolatrous people.

Micah 2.11. A man walking in the wind and falsehood, is put for a vain and
lying person. See Esa. 41.29. -- 57.13. Hosea 8.7. To this belong the words of
the Apostle, 1 Cor. 14.9. For ye shall speakinto the Air, that is, in vain and
to no purpose. He speaks of that Prophesied in the Church in an unknown Tongue,
and therefore could not be understood by the hearers, 1 Cor. 9.26. To beat the
Air signifies when one undertakes a vain and unprofitable work. The metaphor is
taken from men that fight, who when they miss their stroke, spend their
strength vainly against the wind or Air, Ephesians. 4.14. that we henceforth be no
more Children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine
-- by this tossing to and fro of the wind, instability and inconstancy of mind
is denoted, a metaphor taken from a Ship which is tossed and driven here and
there by the violence of the Winds and waves, as Heb. 13.9. Be not carried
about with diverse and strange Doctines, for it is a good thing that the heart
be established with grace.

More because vehement winds are hurtful, therefore Enemies which annoy and
commit devastations on the Earth are called by this appellation, especially the
East Wind, which blasts Corn, and suffers it not to ripen, and if ripe,
scatters and blows it down, Psalm. 55.8. Esa. 41.16. Jer. 4.11. and 51.1. Hosea
13.15. Job 27.21. See also Esa. 27.8. Jonas 4.8. Jer. 18.17. etc. Job says of
God when he punished him, Job 30.22. Thou listest me up to the wind, thou
causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance, that is, as a
Whirlwind scatters chaff or stubble; thou do variously toss and consume me.

To this Class we shall reduce [ Meteors,] which are imperfect mixtures
condensed in the Air. Meteors.
The Hebrew (...) Aeid, and the Greek (...) Atmis, signifies a vapor or
exhalation, but metaphorically denotes Calamities and Destruction, because such
things as evaporate, may be said to perish or be reduced to Nothing: Or as
others say, because vapors cause darkness, and obscure the splendour and
shining of the Sun, or lastly because vapors beget a certain sweet Dew
(commonly called Mill-dew, which is very hurtful to Corn and Plants. So (...)
Aeid a vapor is put for vengenance or destruction, Deuteronomy 32.35. Job 18.12. --
21.30. and 30.12. and 31.3, 23. Psalm. 18.18. Prove. 1.26. and 6.15. Jer. 18.17.
and 46.21. and 49.8.32. Act. 2.19, etc. So it is put for a thing that is frail
and vanishing, Jam. 4.14. What is your Life? It is even a vapor, that
appears for a little time, and then vanishes away? See Psalm. 144.4. A vapor
and smoke ascending into the Air, at length vanishes and perishes hence (...) (
Gnolah) to ascend, sometimes signifies the same with perishing and Death, Deuteronomy.
46.4. -- 49.4. Psalm. 102.24. Jer. 48.15. etc.

[ Clouds] because of their Diverse attributes, have also different
metaphorical notations, as

1. Calamities and Ruin, because men are deprived of the light and spendor of
the Sun and Firmament by them, and Cloudy days make men dull and Melancholy,
Lam. 2.1. How has the Lord covered the Daughter of Sion with a Cloud in his
Anger? Some think that by a tacit Antithesis, allusion is made to the Cloud of
Glory which first appeared in Jerusalem at the Dedication of the Temple, 1
Kings 8.10. to which this Cloud and Fog of present Calamity is plainly
contrary. Hence a day of Clouds, or a cloudy day, is put for times of calamity,
Ezekiel. 30.3. and 34.12. Joel 2.2. Zeph. 1.15. By which metaphor the Poet said,
Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris, that is, if times be Cloudy, thou shall
be alone; because seeming Friends will then forsake the distressed.

2. Because of the Number and multitude of the Clouds, for in tempestuous
weather a great plenty of thick Clouds appear, Heb. 12.1. Wherefore seeing we
also are compassed about with so great a Cloud of Witnesses, etc. that is, so
numerous a company of Witnesses* which are like a thick Cloud. He speaks of
those Holy men of God mentioned particularly, chap. 11. who by their own
example are Testimonies that we are justified, and please God by Faith. Clouds
are likewise used in Comparison, Jer. 4.13. Behold he shall come as Clouds;
that is, his Army will make a vast appearance. The targum, says, as a Cloud
which comes up and covers the Earth. See Ezekiel. 38.9. In the same sense the
Chaldee interprets that passage, Ezekiel. 30.18. A Cloud shall cover her, (viz.
Egypt) thus it renders it -- A King with his Hosts shall cover her, as a Cloud
which comes up and covers the Earth: This may be also referred to the first
signification: For by Clouds and darkness calamity is denoted, whence it is
said before at Tehaphnehes also the day shall be restrained, that is, his light.

3. Because of their vanity and inconstancy, as some Clouds seem to promise
Rain, but being chased away by the Wind, give none, 2 Pet. 2.17. These are --
Clouds that are carried away with a tempest. He speaks of False-Teachers, who
fluctuate or are uncertain in their Preachings and Confessions, not affording
the Rain of saving Doctrine and Consolation, Jude ver. 12. Such are called
Clouds without Water: The Apostle therefore has respect to those Clouds which
seem to us to be Rainy, but are condensed exhalations without water, as chap.
4. Sect. 4. before: For False-teachers seem to be Orthodox to many, etc. The
other appellations in each text do confirm this Exposition.

4. Their Celerity or Swiftness, because we see the Clouds to be carried under
Heaven with very quick speed, as if they did fly, being hurryed on by the
impetuosity of the Wind, Esa. 19.1. Behold the Lord rides upon a swift Cloud,
and shall come into Egypt, that is, he will speedily and unexpectedly punish
the Egyptians as if he did fly upon the Clouds. See Esa. 60.8. Psalm. 104.3.
Nahum. 1.3. Some think that the Prophet used this phrase because the Egyptians
looked upon Clouds of this kind to be ominous, whereas Egypt was not wont to be
troubled with Clouds.

A [ Tempest] (which properly signifies a sudden and very strong Wind or
Whirlwind, sometimes accompanied with Thunders, Rain, and Hail) when attributed
to God, signifies that his dreadful Wrath and tremendous punishments shall be
poured out upon sinners: But if attributed to men, it metaphorically denotes
disturbance, and violent invasions. There are (...) * (...)
two principal words in the Hebrew, which are sometimes joined together as
((...)) a whirlwind, or Tempest which denotes the Wrath of God and Punishment,
Job 9.17. Psalm* 83.15. Esa. 41.16. Jer. 23.19. and 30.23. Ezekiel. 13.11. Amos
1.14. Et verbum (...) procello sum esse.
Job 27.21. Psalm. 50.3. and 58.9. Zach. 7.10.

The Church is said to be tossed with Tempest, (or overwhelmed with whirlwind)
Esa. 54.11. that is, it was afflicted and destitute of comfort. The other word
(...) is of the same signification, Psalm. 83.15. Esa. 29.6. Hosea 8.7. Nah.
1.3. Amos 1.14. etc. And Storms (or an horrible, or burning tempest) Psalm.
11.6. Whence comes terrors or storms of Famine, Lam. 5.10. that is a most
vehement Famine by which men are cruelly agitated and consumed, as if it were
by a Whirlwind or Tempest. But if the word be attributed to men, it denotes
confusion of mind (as the Air is disturbed and troubled with whirlwinds and
storms, 2 Kings 6.11. and an hostile attaque or ruinous invasion, Dan. 11.40.
See Psalm. 55.3.8.

[ Thunder] (to which Lightning is joined, because they terrify, penetrate and
sometimes destroy the Creatures) is only attributed to God, and by a metaphor
signifies,

1. His Majesty and Glory, Psalm. 81.7. I answered thee in the secret place of
Thunder. The Chald. in a hidden place, in the house of my Majesty, where the
spheres of Fire resound before me. -- Illyricus: The sense is in my hidden
Seat, or hiding place, in a thick Cloud I heard thee in the Red Sea, terrifying
the Egyptians with Thunder and Lightning. See Exodus 19.16, 18. Psalm. 77.18, 19.

2. His Wrath and Punishment, 1 Samuel 2.10. The Adversaries of the Lord shall be
broken to pieces: Out of Heaven shall he Thunder upon them, that is, in his
Anger he will grievously punish and destroy them. See Esa. 29.6. Psalm. 18.8;
and the following verses Rev. 16.18, 21.

3. His Word, because in old times Jehovah for the most part made known his
Will by Thunder, as in the promulgation of the Law, Exodus 19. his manifestation
to Job chap. 37.2. and 38.1. And his voice to Christ, John 12.28, 29. Thunder
it self is often called a voice, Exodus 9.23. Jer. 10.13. Rev. 4.5. and 6.1. and
10.3. etc. Sometimes the voice of the Lord, Psalm. 29.3. etc. Thus the Word of
God is styled, with respect to his inward or efficacious decree of Creating
things, Psalm. 104.7. compared with verses 5, 6. Genesis 1.9. As also with respect
to the Gospel of Christ, Psalm 68.34. (by the term voice respect is had to the
voice of Thunder, Psalm. 29.) peruse ver. 12.19. Ephesians. 4.10.11. To this belongs
the Sirnames which Christ gave, John and James (...), Sons of Thunder, because
they were principal and powerful Preachers of his Word.

[ Lightning] by a metaphor signifies the bright or furbisht blade of a Lance
or Sword, (...)
which shines and terrifies like lightning, Ezekiel. 21.10. Nahum. 3.3. To denote
the Anger of God, a glittering Sword is attributed to him by an Anthropopathy,
Deuteronomy. 32.41. So is a glittering Spear, Hab. 3.11. So it is said Job 20.25. The
Lightning comes (so the Hebrew) that is, as our translation gives it, a
glistering Sword -- or as Pagninus render Iron (or a Sword) like Lightning.

[ Hail] likewise (as Thunder and Storms do) carries the notion of Anger,
Vengeance and most heavy punishments, and hence in that description of God in
his great Majesty and manifestation of his power, and Wrath, Psalm. 18.12, 13,
14. Hail is joined with Lightnings and Thunder. Esa. 28.17. And the Hail shall
sweep away the Refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place
-- that is, the vengeance to come shall overthrow the Refuge in which you
vainly hope, Just as if a storm of Hail and overflowing of Waters should
overthrow and overwhelm the Tents you inhabit in, in the Fields, Esa. 32.19.
And it shall Hail in the descent (or steep part) of the wood, and the City
shall be utterly abased. This has a coherence with the foregoing description of
the celestial happiness of the Godly by an Antithesis: As if he had said,
although the whole World (which the Prophet expresses Synecdochically by a wood
and City, that is, unmanured and habitable places) should be terrifyed for
their wickedness, or should threaten, yet the Godly shall be preserved safely
from all the impending or menacing mischiefs. See Psalm. 46.2, 3. and the
following verses.

[ Rain] because it brings great profit to the Earth, and yet if it be
immoderate or unseasonable becomes hurtful, is therefore metaphorically used in
a twofold manner, viz. in a good and bad sense. Examples of the former are to
be seen, Ezekiel. 22.24. Thou art the Land, which is not cleansed, nor Rained upon
in the Day of Indignation -- that is, thou shall not feel any case or
relaxation of the pains or punishments which shall be inflicted on thee from on
high. -- Ezekiel. 34.26. The spiritual blessing in the Kingdom of Christ is set
down in the similitude of a Shower (or rain) in season (as the fruitfulness of
the Earth is ver. 2^^) -- Hosea 10.12. It is time to seek the Lord, till he
come and Rain Righteousness upon you: Or (as the Hebrew is) wet you with the
rain of Righteousness, viz Of Christ the Redeemer and Savior, the sense and
application of whom in the hearts of men, refresh^^, rejoices, and makes them
fruitful in good works, as Rain refreshes the Earth and renders it fruitful.
The Word is emphatical, and signifies both Raining, and Teaching, (and
therefore some translate it, that he may teach you Righteousness) to intimate
that true saving Righteousness cannot be obtained but through the Word of God,
which is a shower of Rain in season to refresh contrite sinners, and hence it
is compared to Rain because of the Rains usefulness, Esa. 55.10, 11. But that
it signifies Rain in the place cited the foregoing Allegory of Raining derived
from fertilizing the Earth is very clear. See Hos. 6.3. Zach. 14.7.

2. Examples of the latter are to be read, Job 20.23. When he is about to fill
his Belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall Rain it
upon him while he is eating. By this and the following metaphors the plenty of
punishments inflicted on the wicked as the effects of Gods Anger are denoted,
Psalm. 11.6. Upon the wicked he shall Rain snares, Fire and Brimstone, that is,
he shall copiously exercise dreadful Judgments upon them. See Eccl. 12.2. Psalm.
42.7. Deep calls unto Deep, at the noise of thy water-spouts. By the Conduits
or water conveyances, for so the Word signifies, are understood Clouds which
pour down much Rain; the meaning is, that one trouble brings on another; and
whilst the former is scarce over, another stands at the door, as if invited or
called by the first. And as the Clouds send down great showers upon the Earth
with much fierceness and noise, causing hurtful floods and sometimes dangerous
deluges: So one Calamity ushers another upon me, so that I am afflicted and
terrified with great perils.

[ Snow] is put for Glory, Prosperity, and Pleasantness of Canaan when
delivered from Enemies, Psalm. 68.14. and Psalm. 51.7. For cleansing from sin.
Esa. 1.18. And the eternal felicity of believers.

[ Dew] which falls from the Air, moistning and fertilizing the Earth, in two
places denotes the state of Believers.

(1.) In this World as Psalm. 110.3. The Dew of Christ's youth is mentioned, that
is, the Church of Believers adopted by the Spirit of Christ, which like Dew is
born again by the Word and Gospel Ministrations, and may be fitly compared to
Dew, because a faithful confession and pious conversation are edifying to
others and win them for Christ rendering the Church fruitful as the Dew does the
Earth; as also with respect to the mutual commiseration, love, and benefits
with which Christians comfort each other, as Dew sweetly refreshes and as it
were cheers the Earth when scorched and dried up by the Suns intemperate heat.
See Micah 5.7. Hos. 14.5. Psalm. 33.3.

(2.) In the world to come, and Resurrection from the Dead, Esa. 26.19. Thy Dew
is as the Dew of herbs -- This is an acclamation to God, whose gracious power
and most powerful Grace which he exercises in the Resurrection of Believers is
called Dew, and compared to the Dew that falls upon herbs: As if he had said,
as the Dew of Heaven refreshes and raises up those herbs which were as it were
Dead and withered because of the Suns heat: So thy power, O God, shall raise up
and make thy Dead to Live, etc. For the connection of the whole verse and
propriety of the words show that the Resurrection of the Dead is here treated
of. The Chaldee interprets it the Dew of Light, which gives the light of
eternal blessedness. The paraphrase upon the whole verse is thus -- Thou art he
which quickens the Dead, thou raisest the bones of their Carcasses; they shall
live and praise thee before all, who were before converted into dust; because
the Dew of light is thy Dew to such as observe thy Law; but the wicked to whom
thou gave power, and yet transgressed thy Law, thou will cast in to Hell.

Metaphors taken from Water.
THese metaphors may be thus distinguished.

(1.) Such things as concern the Name or Appellation of Waters. (2.) The
Subjects or Things containing Water. (3.) Its Adjuncts or Qualities. (4.) Its
Operations or Actions.
1. As to what concerns the first, in Waters two things are especially
remarkable, viz.

First, Their Plenty, Multitude, and Depth, in which respect they are
oftentimes prejudicial and hurtful.

Secondly, Their Profit and Usefulness. So that the metaphors deduced from
Water signify sometimes good, and sometimes hurt or evil.

In the latter sense, (1.) It signifies a strong and numerous People,
especially such as invade a Country in an hostile manner, ravaging and spoiling
it, Esa. 8.7. Behold the Lord brings up upon them the Waters of the River
strong and many. The Chald. An host of many people like a rapid and strong
River -- The interpretation follows, even the King of Assyria and all his power
-- The Allegory is continued, And he shall come up over all his channels, and
go over all his banks, ver. 8. And he shall pass through all Judah, he shall
overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck. that is, the King of
Assyria with his numerous Armies, like swelling and strong waters shall
overrun and destroy all; first the land of Israel, and afterward the Land of
Judah, in which those waters are said to overflow even to the Neck; that is,
even to Jerusalem, wherein was the head of the Kingdom, by a Prosopopoeia,
whereby a Kingdom is compared to a humane body, etc. Jer. 47.2. Thus says the
Lord, Behold waters shall arise up out of the North, and shall be an
overflowing flood, and shall overflow the Land and the fullness thereof. Chald.
Behold a people shall come from the North, and shall be as a strong flood, and
shall prey upon the Earth. The Hosts of the Babylonians are meant. See Esa.
17.12, 13. Ezekiel 26.3, 19. Where an Hostile people are expressly compared with
Water. Also Rev. 17.1, 15. The Vision of a multitude of waters signifies many
people.

(2.) It denotes any great Calamities and Tribulations, 2 Samuel 22.17. Psalm.
18.16. and 32.6. and 66.12. and 124.4, 5. and 144.7. Esa. 28.17. and 43.2. Lam.
3.54.

We are also to note, that the most bitter and exquisite passions of our
Savior are metaphorically compared to Deep and overflowing Waters, Psalm. 69.2,
3, 14, 15. See Psalm. 40.2. See also Psalm. 73.10. Some by the Waters of a full
Cup would have the same thing understood; but the usual exposition is, that it
rather gives a description of the wicked, who enjoy Prosperity and Plenty. And
this leads us to the acceptance of water wherein it signifies good, in which
as in the foregoing particular we must consider it, (1.) As it refers to Men.
(2.) To things themselves.


(1.) Water metaphorically signifies posterity, which is propagated from its
own stock or head, as water flows from a Fountain, Number. 24, 7. He shall pour
the water out of his Buckets, that is, God shall so bless the people of Israel
(represented by Jacob) that they shall have a numerous offspring, and increase
into a great posterity -- Another metaphor taken from water follows -- And his
Seed shall be in many waters, which the Chaldee expounds of peoples (according
to the above signication) thus he paraphrases, a King shall spring up who shall
be magnifyed by his Sons, and he shall rule over many people. But R. Salomo
says, that this signifies prosperity, as Seed (increases best) that is sown
besides the waters.

To this sense we are to refer, Esa. 48.1. Hear ye this O house of Jacob?
called by the Name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah,
that is, such as are descended of Jacob and Judah, as from a Fountain; as Deuteronomy.
33.28. and Psalm. 68.26.

(2.) By the metaphor of waters the blessings of God and our Savior are often
noted, as in the chapter of an Anthropopathy.

2. [ The Subjects,] or things containing Waters are various. The chief is the
[ Sea,] which for the plenty of waters, The Sea.
the violence or impetuosity of its Waves and Storms, metaphorically denotes a
multitude of Enemies, Jer. 51.4. The Sea is come up upon Babylon: She is
covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. Chald. The King with his
numerous Hosts in plenty like the Sea came up against Babylon -- So it is to be
understood, Psalm. 65.7. and 89.9. and 93.3, 4. See also Esa. 17.12, 13. and
57.20. Jer. 6, 23. and 50.42. Where there is an express comparison.

When our iniquities are said to be cast into the depths of the Sea, Micah
7.19. It signifies a total remission and utter oblivion of them.

[ Waves] of the Sea denote Calamities and Punishments, because they rush upon
us and are noxious, as the Waves are troublesome to Ships and Seamen, Psalm.
42.7. and 88.7. To which that phrase, Lam. 1.20. and 2.11. Relates Psalm. 3.
Esa. 57.24.

Jude ver. 14. Raging Waves of the Sea, foaming out their own shame. This is
spoke of unquiet, untamed, vagabonds, or impetuous violent men, who possessed
with a spirit of giddiness by false Doctrine, and wicked lives disturb the
Church, and raise scandals. A Metaphor taken from a turbulent and frothing Sea.
See the express similitude, Esa. 57.20, 21. To which place the Apostle seems to
have respect.

[ Fluctuating] or being tossed to and fro, (...).
Ephesians. 4.14. is attributed to men unstable in the profession of Christianity.
See Jam. 1.6.

A [ Stream] (...) ( Nachal) which runs in a Valley (which is also denoted by
the same Hebrew word) and suddenly increases in tempestuous Rainy weather, and
brings not only terror but loss and damage to men and other Creatures*
metaphorically signifies great Afflictions, Terrors, and Dangers, Psalm. 18.4.
The floods of Belial terrifyed me. Chald. The multitude of oppressors made me
afraid -- Junius and Tremellius. The floods of wicked men affrighting me; he
compares the persecutions and violence of the wicked who would prosecute him
even unto Death to floods, which violently and, ere we are aware, break upon
us. Musculus upon the place: This flood of the wicked rightly agrees with the
valley of Kidron, that is, the Kingdom of darkness.

Psalm. 110.7. He shall drink of the Brook in the way -- This is diversely
expounded, Ps. 110.7. He shall drink of the brook etc.
but most fitly of the passion of our Savior Christ, which is elsewhere
compared to Drinking, for the drinking of his Cup is in this place called a
drinking of the Brook in the way. By the Brook or Torrent, the multitude and
bitterness of Christ's sufferings are noted, and also their Shortness -- For
these torrents or streams quickly pass away, because they have not their source
from a lasting Fountain, but from showers and snow: And therefore it is added,
therefore shall he lift up the head, that is, he shall be gloriously delivered
from Death and Passion or Suffering, and shall most eminently triumph in the
Resurrection. And the Prophet says that Christ should drink [in the way] by
which the course of this Earthly Life is signified, which is called the day of
the Flesh, Heb. 5.7. Elias when banished and persecuted, and dwelling in a
Desert drank of the Brook by the Command of God, 1 Kings 17.4.6. Christ in his
passion was placed as it were in a wide Wilderness, and spiritually drank of
the greatest Torrent of all tribulations and dolors, which by his passing over
the Brook Kedron (which had its name from its blackness and darkness) is noted
John 18.1. So much of that.

Sometimes a Stream or Brook is taken metaphorically in a good sense, either
because of the abundance of Waters, which are transferred to plenty of good
things, Job 20.17. By the brooks of Honey and Butter (to which Rivers and
Floods are added) is signified a confluence of prosperous, pleasant, and
desirable things, even to full satisfaction, Psalm. 36.8. God is said to make
Believers drink of the Rivers (or Brooks) of his pleasures, that is, to bestow
a plenty of blessed, sweet, and heavenly good upon them, which is that life and
overplus (or more than abundance) which Christ promised to his Sheep, John
10.10.

Prove. 18.4. The Wellspring of Wisdom, is called a flowing Brook, that is, the
mouth of a wise man does largely and abundantly utter and Communicate wisdom.
See Esa. 66.12 Amos 5.24. where there are express comparisons.

Or else the Reason of their being taken in a good sense is because in dry and
unwatered Countries, the inundation of Brooks are very seasonable and
profitable, Esa. 35.6. In the wilderness waters shall break out, and streams in
the Desert. He adds ver. 7. And the parched ground shall become a Pool and the
thirsty Land-springs of water. This is a metaphorical description of the
blessings of Christ's Kingdom, and with respect to their sweetness and abundance.

A [ River] if taken in an evil sense, signifies the frequent irruptions and
invasions of Enemies, Esa. 18.2. A Nation whose Land the Rivers have spoiled.
Here is Divine vengeance foretold upon the wicked Ethiopians, by armed Enemies,
who (like mighty currents which none can resist) were to overwhelm their Land*
Some take this properly because there are frequent inundations in Ethiopia, a
Country full of Rivers -- Others Metonymically understand it of Enemies, who by
the Rivers would invade the Country, as the Turks often do Hungary upon the
River Danubius. See Esa. 8.7.

If it be taken in a good sense, it denotes the favor and blessing of God,
Psalm. 46.4. There is a River; the streams whereof shall make glad the City of
God. The Holy habitation which God placed in that City, is intimated to be like
a most sweet and pleasant River, whose Rivulets or Streams exhilarate and
rejoice in the whole City; and therefore it is added, The holy of the
Tabernacles of the most High.

By [River] Jehovah himself (by his Grace and protection inhabiting there) may
aptly be understood; and his streams are the special blessings or benefits we
receive from his Divine protection, which flow from his Grace as Rivulets from
a River. Neither would it be any error, if it should be referred to the Word of
God, for where that is purely taught and flourishes, God himself cannot but be
graciously present there, etc.

Esa. 41.18. I will open Rivers in High Places, and Fountains in the midst of
the Valleys, I will make the wilderness a Pool of water, and the dry
Land-springs of water. This is a metaphorical description of the Kingdom of
Christ. Brentius upon the place: By this metaphor of the Desert waters,
Fountains and Trees (ver. 19.) is understood; That God was to give the
Gentiles, who are called by the name of dry ground and Desert, a most large and
capacious Fountain, that is, the Preaching of his Word in great plenty, that
they that are thirsty may drink of the Fountain, that is, Christ and Eternal
blessedness.

John 7.38. He that believes on me, as the Scripture says, out of his belly
shall flow Rivers of Living water. John 7.38. out of his Belly shall flow
Rivers, etc.
Christ speaking of his being to give the Spirit to his believing Apostles by a
wonderful effusion (as ver. 39.) Therefore flowing of water must be understood,
of the plentiful gifts and operations of the Holy Ghost, by which the Apostles
and other Ministers by Preaching of the Gospel converted many unto Christ and
filled them with living comfort. What Christ adds, viz. as the Scripture
says, belongs to the following words, and the flowing of living waters out of
their Bellies is inferred from some certain places of the Old Testament such as
Esa. 58.11. Thou shall be like a watered Garden, and like a spring whose waters
lie not, (that is, fail not, or do not wax dry) -- Or from the whole substance
of the Universal Gospel promises expounded or set forth by the allegory of
Rivers, Fountains and Waters, such are, Esa. 44.3. and 49.10. Ezekiel. 36.25, 26.
Joel 3.1. and ^^.23. Zach. 12.10. and 14.8.

But Heinsius elegantly joins the words [as the Scripture saith] with the words
immediately going before: He that believes on me, as the Scripture says. In
Aristarcho sacro p. 406.
Christ has respect to that place, Deuteronomy. 18.15.18. where the Prophet is
promised. Neither was there any place, which was then more in their minds, John
1.21. and 6.14. Act. 3.22. John 6.40. -- So that the words which follow [out of
his Belly shall flow Rivers of living waters] are really the words of Christ
himself as is clear, ver. 39. See John 4.14. so far he.

The Hebrew word (...) ( Peleg) which signifies a Rivulet, River or Stream with
a gentle or natural current, is much of the signification of the former, Job
29.6. Rivers of Oil, signifies abundance of good things, Prove. 21.1. The Kings
heart is in the hand of the Lord, (as) the Rivulets of water, that is, he will
incline it, to what he pleases. This similitude shows that Kings are carried
with great impetuosity, Illyricus:
where their inclinations prompt them. But yet that it is in the power of God
to convert them from evil to good, as he dealt with the waters in the
beginning, directing the way where every River must run.

A [ Fountain] is generally taken in a good sense, with respect to Temporals
and Spirituals. Examples of the former are, Deuteronomy. 33.28. The Fountain of Jacob,
that is, the people of Israel, which sprung from Jacob, shall remain like a
lasting Fountain, Jer. 9.1. The Eye is called a Fountain (or a vein,) of Tears,
that is, it sheds Tears plentifully -- See Mark 5.29. Lev. 12.7. and 20.18. etc.

Examples of the later are, Psalm. 36.9. For with thee is the Fountain of Life,
that is, thou, O God, art the cause of all Life and Heavenly blessedness --
Psalm. 87.7. All my springs, (or Fountains) are in thee -- The sense is, That
Believers regenerated by the Spirit of God (of whom he speaks ver. 4.5.) should
celebrate and sing praises to God in the Kingdom of Christ using this Argument
-- All the Fountains of our life are in thee, O our Blessed Savior: Thou alone
art the Author, Fountain, and Original of Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal Life.

Prove. 13.14. The Doctrine of the wise is a Fountain of Life, that is,
wholesome, or health-bringing, and full of comfort, like a clear Fountain which
never wants refreshing or cooling water. The like chap. 10.11. is said of the
mouth of a just or Righteous man. And chap. 14.27. Of the fear of the Lord --
Whence it is manifest that this is to be understood of the Preaching of the
saving Word of God by just and wise men, that is, Believers.

The Word of Christ the Savior is called a Fountain and Spring, Esa. 12.3.
(where the word is in the plural Number, to denote abundance) Zach. 13.1. Joel
3.23. -- With respect to this saving word the Church of Christ is called A
Fountain of Gardens, a Well of living waters, and Streams from Lebanon, Cant.
4.15. Chald. the words of the Law are compared to a Well of Living Waters. This
Fountain is only in the Church of Christ, and therefore this Name is also
attributed to it, and it is also called a spring shut up (or locked) a Fountain
sealed, ver. 12. Because it is sealed and kept by the Holy Spirit through the
Word to eternal Salvation, 2 Cor. 1.22. Ephesians. 1.13. and that in a manner utterly
unknown to all humane sense and reason. Peter calls False Teachers, Wells
without waters, 2 Pet. 2.17. that is, such as make a specious show of Divine
Truth, but really have no Grace, or heavenly Doctrine, God is called the
Fountain of Life, but of that we have treated in the chapter of an
Anthropopathy. That Life eternal is called Fountains and Springs of Living
waters is plain from Esa. 49.10. Rev. 7.17. and 21.6. etc.

More especially the Fountain or water of Siloah is memorable, Esa. 8.6. which
is called the Dragon or Serpents Well, Neh. 2.13. From its slow stream and
windings like a Serpent, whose stream made a Pool, Fountain of Siloah.
Neh. 3.15. called (...), The Pool of Siloah, John. 9.11. From this Well a
Metaphor is taken, Esa. 8.6. Forasmuch as this people despises the waters of
Shiloah that go softly, etc. By which some understand divine promises given to
the Jewish People of a sure defense and protection against their Enemies, in
which the Jews having no confidence or acquiescence, betake themselves to the
protection of foreign Arms. Others by the waters of Siloah understand the
Kingdom of Sion instituted or appointed by God, which was but small and weak in
comparison of the Kingdoms of Syria and Israel, as the Fountain glided with an
easy and silent current. The Chald. For as much as this people despise the
Kingdom of the house of David, leading them quietly, as Siloah flows quietly,
etc. Of this Fountain Jerome in his Comment says -- that Siloah is a Fountain
at the bottom of the Hill Sion, which bubbles out not with continual springs,
but at uncertain hours and days, passing through the concaves of the Earth and
Dens of hard stone, with much noise, we especially that dwell in this Province
cannot doubt.

The Fountain Siloah by another name is called (...) Gichon, 1 Kings 1.33.38.
as appears by the Chald. paraphr. upon the place, which turns it (...) Siloah.
It is called Gichon from breaking or bursting out, hence called a Brook
overflowing, 2 Chronicles. 32.4. it is also observable that Solomon David's Son was
anointed King of Israel by this Fountain, so that there is reason for the
allusion, that by this Well is meant the Kingdom of the house of David.

Brentius upon the place says, metaphor a hujus fontis familiam Davidis
intelligit, idque admodum apt. Nam Siloah, etc. By the Metaphor of this
Fountain, he understands the Family of David, and that in a manner aptly; for
Siloah though it comes with a great sound, yet it flows not always but at
certain days and hours: And when it bubbles forth, it overflows not the whole
Land, it destroies not the Fields, but keeps it self in the Concaves or hollow
places of the Earth, without danger to any, but flows almost hiddenly: So is
the family of David which for the Government of the Kingdom of Juda was
sanctified by God. And although there be a great unlikeness between the Kings
of Judah, one being more merciful, more clement, and more godly then another,
yet they were tolerable Kings, neither were they hitherto over grievous to the
people, but behaved themselves in the administration of the Government modestly
and temperately. Yet the common people in Cities and Country desirous of
novelty, would rather have strange Kings, though Enemiss, then the poor Family
of David which was ordained by God himself to rule that people, etc. It appears
in that War, that some would willingly be disingaged from danger, and others
resolved to repel it any way, but the Commonalty especially the Husbandmen of
Juda would have the Family of David dethroned, and that the King of Israel or
the King of Syria should Rule, etc. Against these Esaiah sharply inveighs, and
Prophesies that the time will come, that because they would not be contented to
live with satisfaction under the peaceable Reign of their own Kings, they
should be exposed to endure the storms and bear the scourge of tyrannical,
great, and turbulent Enemies. To this interpretation R. Kimchi, Vatablus and
Jerome agree.

(...) Beer Puteus.
A [ VVell] is sometimes taken in good sense, as Prove. 5.15, 16, 17, 18. Drink
waters out of thine own Cistern, and running water out of thine own well -- Let
thy Fountains be dispersed abroad, and Rivers of waters in the streets, let
them be to thee only (so the Hebrew) and not to strangers with thee -- let thy
Fountain be blessed. This continued metaphor respects Wedlock and its lawful
familiarity, Aben Ezra thus expounds it -- The sense is that we must keep to
our own proper wife, and to no other besides her, and by Fountains dispersed
abroad a multitude of Children is noted -- Munsterus, the Hebrews expound it,
forsake a stranger, and adhere to thy own Wife, then shall thy Fountains
multiply abroad, that is, thy Children with honor shall appear in public: For
they shall be thine own, whereas if thou go to another thy Children will be
bastards, etc.

Others expound this text of two Doctrines proposed to a pious man.

First, That he should make good use of his proper goods, and by the blessings
of God will augment them, ver. 15, 16, 17, 18.

Secondly, That he should live chastely and continently with his own Wife, and
abstain from others, ver. 18, 19, etc. Franzius says, Drink water out of thy
own Cistern, etc. that is, keep thy Goods for thy self, and thine, and to he^^p
objects of Charity, but do not consume them upon whores, etc.

A [ VVell] is sometimes taken in a bad sense, as great perils and mischief,
Psalm. 55.23. And thou, O Lord, shall bring them into the Well (so the Hebrew)
of destruction -- The Chald. into a deep Hell, Psalm. 69.16. Let not the well
(so the Hebrew) shut its mouth upon me; Chald. Hell. Christ speaks there of his
most bitter passion.

Jer. 2:13. Broken Cisterns that will hold no water (out of which fractions the
water goes out, as it comes in, sailing the expectation of men that want water)
this signifies the Idolatries of Apostasy of the people, to which God the
Fountain of living water is opposed.

3. The Qualities of Water, of these we will note two.

(1.) It is Fluid and Liquid, and if congealed by cold, Qualities of water.
it is resolved and liquifi'd again by heat. Hence a metaphor is taken, for
when ( to melt) or (to be liquid) is spoke of men, it signifies fear,
consternation, anxiety and griefs, Exodus 15.15. Deuteronomy. 1.28. and 20.8. Josh.
7.5. (where liquid water is added) Job 7.5. and 9.23. Psalm. 75.3. and 107.26.
Esa. 10.18. and 13.7. and 31.8. (where (...) signifies melting, the Chald.
breaking: Consternation for fear. Others render it Tribute, which is the other
signification of the word) Esa. 6.4.7. Ezekiel. 21.15. Job 30.22. So Ovid de Ponto.

Sic mea perpetuis liquescant pectora curis.
So may my breasts with constant sorrows melt.
See Psalm. 58.7, 8. and 22.14.15. Where there is an express comparison, Psalm.
119.28. My soul melts (in the Hebrew droppeth) for heaviness, that is,
consumes as if it were liquid -- the Chald. My soul is sad for sorrow. Some say
that this is an hyperbolical description of his Tears, as if his soul were
liquid and resolved into weeping. See Job 6.14, 15. Judge. 15.14.

(2.) Water is capable of Cold and Heat, Romans 12.11. (...), fervent in spirit,
by which spiritual ardor and the zeal of Faith and piety is denoted -- the
Syriack expresses it by a word which signifies boiling water Job 41.22. Ezekiel.
24.3.5. See Job 30.27. Rev. 3.15. (...)
I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot, I would thou were cold or
hot, ver. 16. So that then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot,
I will spue thee out of my mouth -- In this text there is a manifest
translation from the qualities of water. He calls the Cold such as are without
any interest in Christ, or the unconverted; and the Hot he calls such as are
endued with the true knowledge of Christ in an eminent degree; and the lukewarm
are such as would be called Christians, but do not seriously stand by, or plead
the cause of Religion, nor lead a life conformable to their holy profession,
(...), that is, God loves such as are hot or fervent with the zeal of piety:
But the lukewarm who are only Christians in Name, and not in reality, he hates,
nor will he reckon them among his, which by a metaphorical allusion to warm
water, is here expressed -- For by that a man is easily provoked to vomit; so
that Christ by the term vomiting expresses that he will reprobate such.

Object. But what means this, where he wishes that he were Cold? Does that
frame of spirit also please God?

Answer. This is to be understood respective intelligendum.
respectively, or by way of Comparison (...), the Cold, in that, with respect
to the lukewarm, are more praise worthy, because they openly profess what they
are, not counterfeiting that sanctity which they have not, pretending one thing
and doing another, but being under the blindness of a natural state, if they
are taught, they frequently amend, and prove good men; whereas the lukewarm,
making a specious show, of Godliness, but denying the power, are in afar
hopeless condition. The sense therefore is, it is fit that thou be put into
the extreme degrees, that thou may be judged, etc. Prove. 17.27. A man of
understanding is of an excellent Spirit, the Hebrew is of a cool spirit, that
is, of a sedate and quiet mind who is not easily provoked to be disturbed with
the fiery sallies, and intemperate heat of Anger.

4. The Actions of Water, are of two sorts, some, its own actions, as to break
forth, Job 28.4. which signifies abundance of Wealth, and a plentiful
offspring, Actions of water. To break out.
Genesis 28.14. and 30.43. Exodus 1.12. Job 1.10. Hosea 4.10. Also a publishing of
speech, 1 Samuel 3.1. 1 Chronicles. 13.2. 2 Chronicles. 31.5. When the waters are said to
overflow, it signifies an irruption, or attaques of a multitude of Enemies, and
also, the celerity and speed of the invasion. Overflow.
Examples of the former are Esa. 8.8. and 28.15.17, 18. Dan. 11.22. Nah. 1.8.
Of the latter Psalm. 90.5. Esa. 10.22. Jer 8.6. Isa. 22. All Nations shall flow
together to it, Jer. 51.44. Micah 4.1. Here the Prophets treat of the
Conversion of the Gentiles to Christ, To flow.
by a very significant metaphor. In the means of Conversion which is the
Evangelical word by his Divine efficacy, the people willingly without any
compulsion flock to him. Waters naturally descend, if they are made to ascend,
it is by Engines or art, and not from any spontaneous motion or peculiar
quality so inclining them; so this people when they tend Sion-wards and ascend
that Holy Hill are acted, animated, and strengthened by the aid, art, and
efficacy of the Holy Spirit by the Gospel of Christ.

In men converted,

(1.) This denotes diligence and fervor in piety, as waters gather together
with Celerity and Impetuosity.

(2). It denotes Frequency and Plenty, as many waters flow together.

(3.) It denotes Concord or Agreement as many streams come from diverse places
and when they meet make up one homogeneous body, whose parts cannot be
discerned from each other, etc. See Psalm. 19.3. and 79.2.119.171. Prove. 1.23.
and 15.2.28. and 18.4.

Psalm. 45.1. My heart is inditing a good matter, the Hebrew is, my heart
boileth or bubbleth up a good word -- The LXX. (...), To bubble.
eructavit, prompsit; this is an elegant metaphor of the speech of the heart
well premeditated, which by the mouth and lips is uttered as water when it
boils, oftentimes bubbles over.

To distill.
To [ Distill] is put for Speech, Doctrine or Prophecy, either because like Rain
or Dew it is every moment instilled into the Ears, for all Words and Sentences
are not proposed at one and the same time, To drop.
but distinctly and as it were by drops: Or because as Rain and Dew, Waters,
Refreshes, and Fructifies, the Earth, so does heavenly Doctrine render a soul
fruitful, etc. Examples are to be seen, Deuteronomy. 32.2. Job 29.22. Ezekiel. 20.46. and
21.2. Mic. 2.6.11. The Heavens and Skies are said to drop down Righteousness,
when God gives blessings from Heaven, Esa. 45.8. See Joel 3.18. Amos 9.13. The
Mountains shall drop New-wine, and the Hills flow with milk -- by which is
understood that plenty of Celestial blessings purchased by the Merits of Christ.

Actions of Men about water.
Some Actions of a man about waters, as to pour out, which signifies Evil,
sometimes with respect to God, when he is said to pour out his wrath, that is,
when he grievously punishes, 2 Chronicles. 12.7. Esa. 42.25. Psalm. 79.6. Jer. 42.18.
Ezekiel. 9.8. -- 22.23. Dan. 9.11. Lam. 2:4. Hos. 5.10. God is said to pour
contempt upon Princes, Psalm. 107.39, 40. that is, he will divest tyrants of all
authority, and make them contemptible in exiles or banishment, as it follows
there. See Job 16.13. Psalm. 141.8. As it respects men it signifies the evil of
guilt and punishment, or afflictions, etc. See examples Job 30.16. Lam. 2.11,
12. Psalm. 22.14, 15.73.2. Ezekiel. 16.15.

Sometimes it is taken in a good sense, sometimes of God, sometimes of Man: Of
God, as when he is said to pour out his spirit and his grace, when he
plentifully bestows the gift of the Holy Ghost upon Believers and exhibits his
grace, Esa. 32.15.44.3. Joel 3.1. Zach. 12.10. Act. 2.17, 33. Romans 5.5. Tit.
3.6. See Psalm. 45.3. 1 Samuel 1.15. Psalm. 62.8, 9. Lam. 2.19. Job 3.24.

To [ Wash] and make clean (which is wont to be done with water) is often
translated to signify the Justification of sinful man before God, and his
sanctification and Renovation. To be washed from sin (as from most fordid
filth) is to obtain remission of sins through the Mediator Christ, Psalm. 51.8,
9. Esa. 4.4. Ezekiel. 16.4, 9. -- 36.25. Act. 22.16. 1 Cor. 6.11. Heb. 10.22. Rev.
1.5.7.14. Or that which is always joined with the antecedent benefit of God, to
abstain from sin and practice Holiness and purity of Life, Job 9: 30. Psalm.
26.6. Psalm. 73.13. Prove. 30.12. Esa. 1.16. Jer. 4.14, Jam. 4.8. etc.

Of Metaphors taken from the Earth.
IN the Globe of the Earth two things are to be considered, which afford as
many metaphorical acceptations.

(1.) That it is opposite to Heaven with respect to quantity and qualities.
Hence as Heaven denotes the spiritual Kingdom of God, and the state of eternal
felicity; so on the contrary the Earth denotes the state of Corruption and Sin
in which man after the fall was involved, John 3.31. (...), he that is of the
Earth, is of the Earth, and speaks of the Earth A very fair Antanaclasis! The
first phrase [ of the Earth] is properly taken and denotes an Earthly original,
that is, to be begotten by a natural man in a natural way (to which is opposed
that Christ is (...), come from above and from heaven. See 1 Cor. 15.47.)

The second phrase [of the Earth] metaphorically taken, is to be carnally wise,
ignorant of Divine things, lost in sin, and an absolute stranger to heaven and
the spiritual Kingdom of God, which elsewhere is phras'd, (...), to mind (that
is, only taken care for) Earthly things, Phil. 3.19. (...), to take care for
those things which are of the Flesh, Romans 8.5. See John 3.6. 1 Cor. 2.14. To
which in this place of John, viz. 3.31. is opposed that Christ, (...), is above
all, that is, the heavenly Lord and most Holy God void of all imperfection and
worldly spot.

The last phrase [ to speak of the Earth] is conformable to the first and is to
speak those things which are contrary to the Kingdom of God, erroneous and
lying. See 1 John 4.3, 5. (To which is opposed that Christ testifies that which
he saw and heard, and speaks the words of God, which whosoever receives, he
Seals or Witnesses that God is true) the like opposition Christ uses speaking
to the carnal Jews, John 8.23.

2. Because the Earth affords men Houses and convenient Habitations, in that
respect Eternal Life, and the heaven of the blessed is called a new Earth or
Land, Esa. 65.17.22. 2 Pet. 3.13. Rev. 21.1. Because in it are those many
Mansions which are provided by Christ for Believers, John 14.2. -- In this
sense some of the Fathers expound, Matthew. 5.5. Blessed are the meek for they
shall inherit the Earth. But this may be fitly interpreted of the Earth on
which we dwell: For this sentence seems to be borrowed from Psalm. 37.11. The
meek shall inherit the Earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of
peace, -- The meaning may be, they who do violence to none, and when injured
easily forgive, who choose rather to lose their right, then vexatiously to
wrangle or contend, who value Concord and Tranquillity of mind before great
Estates, to whom a quiet Poverty is more welcome, then brawling Riches, these I
say, will truly and with a mind full of tranquillity inhabit and possess this
Earth, and in it will enjoy the grace and blessing of God to them and their
posterity, whilst the Goods of the wicked are by divine Vengeance scattered as
it were into the light Winds, so that these (viz. the meek) are the true
possessors of the Land, and as it were the props or pillars that conserve it,
whereas the wicked together with the Devils, are but possessors of a bad Faith,
and unjust Ravishers, for whose malice every Creature groans, and does as it
were tacitly implore Deliverance of the great Creator, Romans 8.20, 21, 22. etc.

So much in general, now we shall briefly show what Metaphors are taken from
the several parts of the Earth. As,

1. A [ Mountain or Hill] being a more high and elevated part of the Earth
metaphorically denotes. Mountains.


(1.) Heaven the habitation of God, so called by an Anthropopathy, as he is
elsewhere said, to dwell in the highest, Psalm. 3.5. I cried unto the Lord with
my voice, and he heard me out of his Holy Hill, that is, from Heaven: As if he
had said I am cast out from the place of the Terrestrial Sanctuary appointed in
Jerusalem, but there is yet an open access to the Holy Hill of God his heavenly
habitation, where my Prayers shall be heard, and shall implore the wished help
against those rebellious and stubborn Enemies. So Psalm. 99.9. Psalm. 121.1. and
123.1. and 15.1. -- 18.8. 2, Sam. 22.8.

2. [ Kingdoms] and [ Empires,] which like Mountains have a pre-eminence in the
World, Psalm. 30.7. Lord by thy favor thou have made my Mountain to stand
strong, that is, thou have given my Kingdom strength and tranquillity, Psalm.
76.4. Thou art more glorious and excellent than the Mountains of prey -- that
is, the Kingdoms of the wicked, who unjustly plunder and prey upon the World,
Jer. 51.25. Behold I am against thee O destroying Mountain, says the Lord,
etc. Illyricus, So he calls Babylon, although it was situate in a plain,
because of the loftiness of its Dignity and Power, by which as a very high
Mountain it hung over other Cities and People. But others think, that by the
vast circuit and thickness of its Walls it rise like a Mountain; for Herodotus,
Strabo, Pliny, and Diodorus Siculus affirm that the Walls of Babylon were 50
Cubits thick and 200 Royal Cubits high. And that which is added in the same
place, that Babylon should be made a burning Mountain, is to be understood of
the rubbish and ruinous heap which was left like a Mountain after the burning
of that great City. -- Hab. 3.6. The Everlasting Mountains were scattered, and
the perpetual Hills did bow, that is, the Kingdoms of the peoples were suddenly
shaken and overthrown: He speaks of the blessing of God, which expelled the
Canaanites and distributed their Lands to his people by his Ministers Moses and
Joshua. See Exodus 15.14. etc.

3. Any proud Enemies of the Kingdom of God, Esa. 2.14. The day (of the Anger)
of the Lord -- upon all the High Mountains, and upon all the Hills that are
lifted up, that is, upon all such as are proud and lifted up because of their
power. As appears, ver. 11.12, 17. Also by the Cedars of Lebanon that are
lifted up and the Oaks of Bashan, ver. 13. And the High-Towers and fenced
Walls, ver. 15. Esa. 40.4. Every Valley shall be exalted, and every Mountain
and Hill shall be brought low, etc. This is a metaphorical description of the
effect of John Baptists Preaching, of which the Prophet speaks here. In
Comment. h. l.
Upon which Musculus -- The Doctrine of Repentance, humbles Mountains, and
Hills, and makes plain the uneven, and crooked, that is, it brings down the
proud, depraved, and wicked, And the Consolation of the Kingdom of God, which
is joined to the Doctrine of Repentance, lifts up the Valleys, that is, it
comforts and refreshes the humble, the poor in spirit and the dejected. The
forerunner of the Lord did exactly prosecute both these parts in preparing the
way for our Lord, saying, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, Matthew.
3. etc. Esa. 41.15. Thou shall thresh the Mountains, and beat them small, and
shall make the Hills as chaff, that is, thou shall destroy thine Enemies though
they be most proud and powerful, notwithstanding thou do seem but as a worm,
ver. 14. He speaks by the Spirit to the Church of Christ, which by virtue of
the heavenly word, works these things gloriously: The Chald. renders it thou
shall slay those people, destroy their Kingdoms, and make them as chaff. See
Zach. 4.7. etc.

More especially there is mention of Bashan, Psalm. 68.15. which was a
mountainous Country, famous for excellent pasture, the Beasts that fed there
being very fat, strong, and great -- hence the Bulls, Rams, or Heifers of
Bashan are metaphorically put for fat, Deuteronomy. 32.14. which is also transferred
to Men, Psalm. 22.12. Strong (Bulls) of Bashan have beset me round, that is, the
Enemies of Christ who were strong and fierce, etc. See Amos 4.1. The Oaks of
Bashan are used in the like sense, Esa. 2.13. Zach. 11.2.

Carmel was a Mountain famous for Fields, Vines, Olive Trees, and Fruit bearing
shrubs, and is by a metaphor put for any good and fruitful Country, Esa. 16.10.
Jer. 2.7. Some think this Translation is made because of the Etymology of the
Word, that alleging that (...) Carmel is compounded of (...) Kerem, vinea, a
Vineyard, and (...) plenus, full, that is, full of Vineyards. The Word is also
Translated to spiritual things, Esa. 32.15. and mention is made of it in the
description of the New Testament Church, and its vigor and glory, Esa. 35.2.

[ Lebanon] a Mountain, denotes the Grandees in the King of Assyria's Army,
because of the height, statelyness and plenty of the Trees there, Esa. 10.34.
And Lebanon shall fall by a Mighty One, that is, even the stoutest and most
valiant in that Army shall be slain by the Angel of the Lord. In the foregoing
part of the verse it is said, and he shall cut down the thickets of the Forest
with Iron, where we are to understand the other part of the Army, who together
with their chief Captains and Champions were to be cut off.

[ Hill] if added to Mountains is sometimes taken metaphorically in the sense
given before. Some by Everlasting Hills, Genesis 49.26. Understand Patriarch,
Prophets, and illustrious Saints, who exceed others as Hills do Valleys, but it
is thought that the phrase unto the utmost bound of the Everlasting Hills, is
better expounded unto the end of the World, that is until the Hills be moved,
which are always immovable: And by this reason also Esa. 54.10. The Covenant of
Divine Grace is compared to Hills and Mountains immovable.

A [ Rock] (which is a great Stone in height resembling a Mountain) by a
Metaphor denotes a firm, stable, or secure place from dangers, Rock.
and consequently Refuge and Protection, Psalm. 40.2. -- and 27.5. and 61.2.
Esa. 31.9. and 33.16. Jer. 51.25. etc.

A [ Den] is a Cavity or hollow place of Stones or great Rocks in which Thieves
and Robbers hide themselves, Den.
hence Christ calls the Temple of Jerusalem of a Den of Theives, Matthew. 21.13.
Mark 11.17. Luke 19.46. which is taken from Jer. 7.11. because of their false
Doctrine, perverse lives, oppressions, unrighteousness, etc. Each of which is
spiritual Robbery. Neither is the allusion of a Den to that spacious and vast
Temple insignificant; for we find recorded by Josephus lib. 14 c. 27. and by
Strabo lib. 16. that there were Dens in that Country so great and spacious that
4000 men may at once hide themselves in one of them.

A [ Valley] because of its lowness and the obscurity of its shade which broken
and hanging Hills and trees cause, metaphorically denotes humiliation, griefs,
Valley.
and oppressions, Esa. 40.4. Luke 3.5. Jerusalem is called the Valley of
Visions, Esa. 22.1, Because it was the seminary of the Prophets, etc. Psalm.
23.4. Yea though I walk in the Valley of the shadow of Death, I will fear no
evil, that is, although I should fall upon the utmost perils of Death -- The
metaphor is taken from Sheep, who when they stray in those obscure and desolate
Valleys are in danger to be destroyed by Ravenous beasts. See Psalm. 119.176. I
have gone astray like a lost Sheep, etc.

Psalm. 84.6. Who passing through the Valley of Baca make it a well: The Rain
also fills the Pools -- This text in the Hebrew is thus -- Passing through
the valley of Mulberry-Trees they make him a well, and the Rain with blessings
(or most liberally) covers them, that is, although the Godly (whom ver. 4, 5.
he calls blessed because they dwell in the House of the Lord, still praising
him, and with a strong Faith cleaving to him, etc.) should be involved in
diverse calamities (which is metaphorically expressed by passing through the
Valley of Mulberry-trees, that being a barren and dry place, Mulberry-trees
usually growing in such ground, 2 Samuel 5.22, 23, 24.) yet they trust in God and
make him their Well, by whom as from the living stream of Health and Comfort
they are abundantly refeshed, raised up and comforted, and as it were with a
wholesome Rain made fruitful. It follows ver. 7. That they go from strength to
strength; that is, by the Power of God they shall subdue and overcome all
Enemies and Evils that annoy them. It follows in the Hebrew thus The God of
Gods shall be seen by them in Sion, (that is in the Church of Believers) that
is, he will graciously manifest himself to them, both by the Word of Life, and
by his excellent help -- Compare Psalm. 50.23. with this text.

There are other valleys metaphorically made use of as, Hos. 2.15. Valley of
Achor.
I will give the valley of Achor for a door of hope -- This is a Promise of
Jehovah to the Church; by which phrase the consolation of his spirit in
adversity, and the comfort of hope is understood. Achor signifies perturbation
or trouble, and received that name from the great perturbation of the people of
Israel, Josh. 7.24, 25, 26. It was in that valley which borders upon Jericho,
that they had the first hope of possessing the Land of Canaan. So they
believing in the valley of Achor, that is, being full of trouble and
d^^sturbance, they are raised up by a gracious consolation out of Gods word,
and are comforted by the hope of eternal Life.

The Valley of Jehosaphat is put for the Church, Joel 3.2. The valley of
Gehinnon or Hinnon from whence Gehenna (put for Hell) comes, afford no other
Metaphors.

A [ Desert] which is a part of the Earth little inhabited, and manured,
wanting pleasant Rivers, elegant Trees, Fruits, etc. is often put for the
Gentiles, who are strangers to the Kingdom of God, and are destitute of the
means of eternal Life -- Hence Fountains of Living Waters, and good Trees are
promised to the Desert, by which the Calling of the Gentiles to the Kingdom of
Christ is intimated, Esa. 35.1, 2. and 41.18, 19. and 43.19, 20. And by those
Fountains the saving Doctrine of Christ; but by Trees the Teachers of the Word,
and true Believers are to be understood.

[The lower parts of the Earth] Psalm. 139.15. signify the Mothers Womb, and so
the Chaldee translates it. By this phrase we are fairly informed what our
original is, viz. the Earth.

Some say that the phrase, Ephesians. 4.9. He also descended into (...) the lowest
parts of the Earth, is to be taken in this sense: But this is most properly to
be understood of the state of his deep and most profound humiliation; as his
ascending on high, is to be understood of the state of his most super-eminent
exaltation. Brentius upon Act. 1. page 19. says -- See the miseries and
calamities, which man must of necessity endure for his sin, and you will find
him as it were in the lowest part of the Earth, what is lower than the pit of
Death? What Is deeper than Hell? When David said, Out of the depths have I cried
to thee O Lord, surely he cries from no other place, than from the sense of
Death and Hell, in which for his sins he was comprehended, etc.

[ The Deep of the Earth] and the terms that are analogical to it as a Pit, an
Abyss, or swallowing deep metaphorically denote,

1. The Grievousness of Evils, Miseries, and Calamities, Psalm. 55.23. and
71.20. and 88.6. Prove. 22.14. Esa. 24.17, 22. Lam. 4.20. and 3.47, 53. Zach.
9.11. Hence the phrase to dig a pit for another, that is, to conspire mischief,
and to fall into the pit he dug for another, that is, to be overwhelmed with
the same evil he provided for another. See Psalm. 7.15, 16. and 9.15, 16. Prove.
26.28. Jer. 18.20. Psalm. 94.12, 13. 2 These. 1.5. etc.

By Sepulchers which are under the Earth great Calamities are likewise
signified, Psalm. 86.13. and 88.3, 4. etc.

2. That which is Abstruse, hid, or inscrutable, as an abyss, or bottomless
pit, cannot be seen or known through Psalm. 36.6. and 92.5. Romans 11.33. 1 Cor.
2.10. Rev. 2.24. See Esa. 29.15. and 31.6. Hos. 5..2. and 9.6. 1 Timothy 6.9. etc.

From [Mud,] [Dirt,] [Dust,] and [ Dung,] also Metaphors are taken which denote

1. Men in a Vile and Contemptible condition, 1 Samuel 2.8. Psalm. 113.7. Hither
may we refer where the Apostle calls himself (...)* 1 Cor. 4.13. Made as the
filth of the World, and the offscouring of all things, because of the ignominy
and contempt which he suffered. Erasmus in paraphrase, Others are much honored
by you, but we for your sake to this day, are accounted as the trash of this
World, than which nothing can be more abject, or trampled upon. See Lam. 3.45.
To which place a great many say the Apostle had respect.

2. Evils and Adversities, Psalm. 69.2, 14. Jer. 38.22. Lam. 4.5.

3. Death, or a most ignominious casting away, Psalm. 83.10. Which is called the
burial of an Ass, Jer. 22.19. See 2 Kings 9.37. Jer. 16.4. etc.

4. A thing had in great esteem among men, but is really vile, sordid, and
noxious, Hab. 2.6. That ladeth himself with thick Clay or Mud by this is to be
understood a vast power of Riches, which do not profit, but rather prove grand
snares and hurtful impediments to the wicked possessors, as if they had been
immerg'd in thick Mud, or should take it along, as their burden. As Mud is an
impediment to a Traveller, by how little he can go forward: And by how often he
endeavors to dispatch, by so much is he involved in a more dangerous
intricacy: So great Wealth, in the way of Godliness are a hinderance to him
that sets his heart upon it Mar. 10.23.24. Luke 8.14. See Esa. 24.20.

Phil. 3.8. I count all things but loss -- and Dung that I may win Christ -- He
speaks of those things, which before his Conversion he magnified, and put his
confidence, for Salvation, in: But now being converted to Christ, he despises
them as the most sordid and vilest things, being not only unprofitable for
Salvation, but most pernicious if confided in. Others expound (...), as if he
had said (...), (...) quasi (...), i. e. quae canibus projiciuntur.
that which is thrown to dogs -- So Suidas takes it. And it is to be noted that
in the second verse false Apostles are called Dogs, whose corrupt works the
Apostle cautions against. By Mud, Dirt, and other Filth the Members and Apparel
of a man are polluted and contaminated; which contamination is brought
frequently to denote the Filthy nature of sin, Esa. 64.6. 2 Cor. 7.1. Ephesians.
5.27. Tit. 1.15. 2 Pet. 2.10, 20. (with ver. 13, 22.) Jud. ver. 23. Jam. 1.21.
Rev. 3.4. To this Washing and Cleansing are Contrary, by which the taking away
of sin is noted.

[ The Dust] of the Earth likewise signifies contempt, abjection, misery, and
mourning, 1 Samuel 2.8. Job 16.15. Ps. 7.5, 6. Ps. 22.15, 16, 29, 30. and 44.25,
26. and 113.6, 7. Psalm. 119.25. Esa. 47.1. and 52.2. Lam. 3.16, 29.

[ Ashes] In a metaphorical signification and by (...) * pulvis, (...) Cinis.
allusion of the Name agrees with Dust, with which it is sometimes joined,
sometimes not. For the Dust is indeed Ashes, only that is a grosser matter into
which a thing burnt is reduced. By this is signified frailty and vileness, Genesis
18.27. Eccles. 10.9. where nevertheless there is respect had to man's first
original which was Dust and Ashes -- Sometims it signifies great Calamity, and
the sadness, and mourning that ensues, Esa. 61.3. Ezekiel. 28.18. Mal. 4.3. Lam.
3.16. For Mourners were formerly wont to throw Ashes upon. their Heads, yea to
lie in it, as appears, 2 Samuel 13.19. Job 2.8. and 42.6. Esa. 58 5. Jer. 6.25.
Ezekiel. 27.30. Jon. 3.6. Matthew. 11.21. etc. The same metaphorical signification
is in the phrase, to feed on Ashes, Psalm. 102.9. I have eaten Ashes like Bread,
that is, I am in very great grief or trouble, Esa. 44.20. He feeds of Ashes,
a deceived heart has turned, him aside -- He speaks of the Idol, which can
bring nothing but mourning and all evil to its adorers. So much of simple
bodies and what bears Analogy with them. Of Compound we will treat in the
following Chapters.

CHAP. XI. Of Metaphors taken from Minerals, Plants and Living Creatures.
COmpound Bodies according to the Physical distinction are either Inanimate or
Animate.

Inanimate are Metals, Stones, and Concrete Juices, as Salt --

Animate are either Vegetative, Sensitive, or Rational.

Of the first kind are Plants, or Things growing out of the Earth.

Of the second kind, Brutes.

Of the third kind Men and Women. Of which distinctly and in Order.

Metaphors taken from Inanimate Bodies.
Gold.
GOLD] metaphorically signifies quoad Naturalia, as it respects Naturals.

(1.) A clear and shining liquor like Gold, viz. Pure Oil, Zach. 4.12.

(2.) Serenity of Sky, when it is of a yellowish red, Job 37.22. Fair weather
comes out of the North -- in the Hebrew it is Gold comes out of the North,
that is (as Schindler says) a clear Air without Clouds, or a wind pure as Gold,
and purifying the Air, making it as pure as Gold: The North Wind, hence called
by Homer (...), the causer of serenity. The Septuagint rendered it, (...),
Clouds shining like Gold.

As it respects Spirituals, Gold signifies the pure Doctrine of the Gospel, as
Silver, and precious Stones do, 1. Cor. 3.12. Also the Grace and benefits of
Christ our Savior; or, which is the same thing, true Wisdom received by the
Word of Christ, Rev. 3.18. and even Life Eternal, Rev. 21.18.

Silver.
[ Silver] is taken or put for an excellent or very fair thing, whence the Word
of God is said to be as Silver tried in a Furnace of Earth, purifyed seven
times, Psalm. 12.6. where respect is had to its great purity. Hence our Savior
is said, Mal. 3.3. To be a Refiner and purifyer of Gold and Silver, that is, to
institute a repurgation of his heavenly Doctrine. The phrase in Esa. 1:22. Thy
Silver is become dross, denotes corrupt doctrine, and a depraved Life. The
rebellious people of the Jews are called Reprobate Silver, as if it were said,
overmuch corrupt, and therefore good for nothing but to be reprobated, or cast
away.

The Excrements of Silver, as Dross, Tin, and Lead denote Idolaters, wicked and
reprobate people, Esa. 1.25. (See Psalm. 119.119. Prove. 25.4, 5. Ezekiel 22.18. and
the following verses) (...) a fragment, or (by a Syllepsis) fragments, Esa.
1.28. are called the particles or refuse of that dross, with which the Prophet
compares the wicked, because, like that, not to be healed, etc.

[ Brass and Iron,] denote hardness and solidity, Deuteronomy. 28.23. Esa. 48.4. Jer.
1.18. Mich. 4.13. Iron also denotes great Troubles and Crosses, if a Furnace
(which because of the Fire it contains, is a symbol of Calamity) be added,
Deuteronomy. 4.20. 1 Kings 8.51. The like is to be understood if it be added to a
Yoke, as Deuteronomy. 28.48. And to a Rod, Psalm. 2.9. each of which by themselves,
signify Affliction.

There is an obscurer place, Jer. 15.12. Shall Iron break the Northern Iron,
and the Steel or Brass, Jer. 15.12. Shall Iron break the Northern Iron expounded
which some expound, that the Northern Enemy, viz. The Assyrian Army was
plainly invincible. Others on the contrary, that there would assuredly come
another Enemy, who should break and chastise the Assyrians, to wit, the
Persians, etc. Vatablus chooses the former fence, by the first Iron,
understanding the Jews: He compares (says he) the strength of the Jews to pure
Iron, and the strength of the Chaldeans to Iron, which is mixed with much steel,
and therefore stronger: As if he had said, shall the Jewish Iron Sword break
the Chaldean, well tempered with Iron and Steel? No, Iron and Brass, he calls
Iron mixed with Brass, that is, Steel.

Junius and Tremellius take it as a confirmation of the foregoing promise ver.
11. which God made by the Prophet, that he would defend them from the hostility
of the Chaldeans and would make them to entreat them well, and therefore they
expound the first Iron, the Chaldeans, and the latter Iron and Brass (that is
Steel) from the North or Chalybes, (for there were a people of that Name in the
Northern parts of Pontus, from which Chalybes or Steel, took its Name, as
Virgil in the 2 Book of his Georgicks and Strabo in his 12th. Book of Geography
Witness) Jehovah himself; as if he (viz. Jehovah) had said these are Iron, but
I who interpose or come to relieve thee, am a Wall of Steel to thee; therefore
you have no cause to fear, that you should be broken by those Enemies.

It is said Esa. 60.17 For Brass I will bring Gold, and for Iron will bring
Silver, and for Wood Brass, and for Stones Iron -- which signifies the
restoration or Redemption of Mankind, and the Change of the legal into an
Evangelical dispensation by the Messiah.

A [ Stone] if transferred to a Man, sometimes denotes a great stupidity of
mind, 1 Samuel 25.37. Sometimes hardness of heart, and the state of the sinner
before Conversion to God, Ezekiel. 11.19. and 36.26. To which the Contrary is,
that such as are converted and believe are called living Stones, 1 Pet. 2.5.
With respect to Christ who is called the precious and elect Stone, upon which
they are spiritually built, Ephesians. 2.20, 21, 22. etc. This Word (Stone) is also
used in a good sense, Genesis 49.24. But his Bow abode in strength, and the Arms
of his hands were made strong, by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob, from
thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel -- that is, Joseph stood and was
sent by the most powerful God to feed Israel and his Family as a Pastor, and to
prop them as a Stone, to wit, when he supplied and preserved his Fathers whole
house from Egypt. Some think that this man of God did Prophecy of times to
come, and that by Pastors we should understand Prophets, and by a Stone,
eminent Kings and Princes that were to come of the Family of Joseph among the
People of Israel, which people they were to lead forth, and teach, and to
support them, as a Rock or a Foundation Stone supports the Building.

It is said Zach. 12.3. That Jerusalem will be made a stone of burden for all
people, upon which words Jerome notes, Formerly in little Villages, Little
Towns, and little Castles, they were wont to place round Stones of great
weight, which the youth for exercise sake, were wont to strive who could lift
them highest, some could lift only to their Knees, some to their Navels, some
to their Shoulders and Head, Quarries.
some (that made an ostentation of their strength) with erected hands, threw
them over their, heads, etc. Hence the Prophet alludes (say they), that if any
Nations will adventure to assault the Church to remove it from its place, and
toss it at their pleasure, they shall sink under their burden, and be even
crushed to pieces; even by the power and strength of the chief Cornerstone of
the Church, Luke 20.17, 18.

From [ Quarries] of stone an elegant Metaphor is taken, Esa. 51.1. Look into
the Rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are dug.
He speaks of the Godly Israelites sprung from Abraham and Sarah, as ver. 2. The
Reason of this metaphorical phrase Junius and Tremellius fairly deduce from the
Argument of this chapter -- Thus Christ argues, I promise that I will comfort
and restore the Church, although it be wasted and almost nothing, ver. 3. and
that you may the easilier believe this, remember that you are come of Parents,
that had never begot Children, if God by his powerful Word (as a hammer break
Stones out of a Rock,) had not done it: And therefore you who are in the same
Covenant, are to experience the same virtue and power of God. See Ezekiel. 4.1.
Exodus 24.10. Prove. 17.8.23.

More specially there is a metaphorical mention of gems in the description of
the Glory and the inward splendour of the Church of Christ, Esa. 54.11. Behold I
will lay thy Stones with fair colors, and lay thy Foundations with Saphires --
And ver. 12. I will make thy Windows of Crystal, and thy gates of Carbuncles,
and all thy borders of pleasant Stones -- that this relates to the New
Testament times, appears by the following words, ver. 13. And all thy Children
shall be taught of the Lord, which words, John 6.44, 45. are cited by Christ,
application being made to his Church. Its Foundation is said to be laid in
Saphires and Carbuncles, that is, in the true knowledge of Jesus Christ, who is
the only foundation of the Church, Matthew. 16.16, 18. 1 Cor. 3.12. Esa. 53.11
and withal the most precious and resplendent Gem. It is expounded Isa. 54.14*
In Righteousness shall thou be established, which is the Righteousness of
Christ applied by true Faith in order to Salvation. Its Windows are said to be
of Crystal, by which the Apostles, Evangelists, and other faithful Preachers
of the Word of God, and their sacred Preaching of Jesus Christ are to be
understood, through which, as by Chrystalline and most transparent Windows,
heavenly light gets into the Church. Its Gates are said to be of Carbuncles (a
Gem of a flaming color which derives its name from (...) * ab a^^^ndendo.
kindling) by which the continual Preaching of the Word is understood, that
door of utterance, Col. 4.3. 1 Cor. 16.9. The Gates that shall be open
continually, Esa. 60.11. By which such as enter are enlightened as by a
sparkling Gem, and kindled by a Divine Fire, Luke 24.32. Did not our heart burn
within us? etc.

Lastly all its Borders are said to be of pleasant Stones, that is, most lovely
and desirable -- By which the amplitude or largeness of the Church of Christ
gathered by the Preaching of the Gospel in the whole World, built upon Christ
himself and his saving knowledge is understood. But we must observe, that these
things are to be most completely fulfilled in the heavenly Jerusalem and life
Eternal, as in its description, Rev. 21.10, 11, 18. etc. appears.

By the metaphor of a Pearl the saving Word of God is expressed, Matthew. 7.6. So
the Kingdom of heaven, that is, the Church gathered by the Word, is compared to
a Pearl, Matthew. 13.45, 46.

(...) Adamas
An [ Adamant or Diamond] (a precious and most hard Stone) is brought to denote
the pravity and diabolical hardness of man's heart, Zach. 7.12.

Salt.
[ Salt] that good Creatures of God, so called by the Evangelist, Luke 14.34.
Because of its virtue to preserve from putrefaction, and season, or give a
relish unto meat, is by a metaphorical Translation applied sometimes to the
Apostles, and other Teachers of the Word of God, Matthew. 5.13. whose office it
is to take care that by sound Doctrine, and a blameless example of Life, their
Auditors be preserved from any Corruption as well in the fundamentals of
Religion, as also (as far as may be) from any blemish in external Life and
Conversation. For as Salt applied to meat consumes the depraved or corrupt
humors, and so preserves from putrefaction; so the Ministers of the Gospel by
sound Doctrines, and by a prudent application of legal reprehension preserve
men from being putrified in sin, and are instruments to make them savoury, that
is, that they may please God, and so obtain (through his mercy in Christ)
eternal blessedness.

Quemadmodum sal carnes cohibet, etc.
Theophilact on Mark. 9.50. says, that as Salt hinders the generation of Worms
in Meat: So the Preaching of the Gospel, if quick and home, seasons carnal men
so, that the Worm of restlesness shall not generate in them.

Sometimes it signifies Wisdom and Prudence, Mark 9.50. Col. 4.6. Upon which
Illyricus, Wisdom keeps the Actions, Lives, and Manners of men from any fault,
as Salt does flesh and other things: And makes life, manners, and speech
grateful and acceptable to all, as Salt gives a grateful relish to meat.

To this Speech seasoned with Salt corrupt Communication is opposed, Ephesians. 4.29.
that is, obscene, foolish, or impious talk, which for the want of this
spiritual Salt, as it were stinks, and is unsavory to God and Holy men. What
we translate Job 1.22. In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly,
is (word for word) in the Hebrew thus, In all these Job sinned not, nor gave
(...) insulsitas, unsavoriness.
unsavouriness against God, viz. sinful words, as the Chaldee renders it.
Impiety is noted by the same Word, Job 24.12.

We have mention of a Covenant of Salt, Numb. 18.19. 2 Chronicles. 13.5. Which
signifies that which is lasting and perpetual, the reason of the Speech is,
because things Salted last very long and do not putrify. See Luth, marginal.
Schol. in Numb. 18.19.

[ Sulphur or Brimstone] joined with Fire, denotes most heavy punishments,
Deuteronomy. 29.23. Job 18.15. Psalm. 11.6. Esa. 34.9. Ezekiel. 38.22. Hence it is put in
the description of Hell, Esa. 30.33. Rev. 14.10. and 20.10. and 21.8. All which
places (some say) allude to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by Fire and
Brimstone, Genesis 19.24.

Metaphors taken from Things Growing out of the Earth.
THings Growing out of the Earth are to be considered distinctly, with respect
to their Parts, as also with respect to their Kinds and Species.

The Parts are these,

1. [ Seed,] of which a Plant grows, Seed.
metaphorically signifies the Word of God by power and virtue of which, a man
is New born, and becomes an acceptable Tree or Plant to God, ( Esa. 61.3.) 1
Pet. 1.23. Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by
the Word of God which lives, and abides for ever. 1 John 3.9. Whosoever is
born of God, does not commit sin; for his Seed remains in him: And he cannot
sin because he is born of God; Which is expounded, Psalm. 119.11. Thy Word have
I hid in my heart, that I may not sin against thee; and Luke 8.15. But that
sown in the good ground, are they, which in an honest and good heart, having
heard the Word, keep it, and bring forth with patience. To this may be compared
the fifth and 11th. verses of this chapter, where it is expounded, that the
Seed is the word of God.

By the same metaphor it is called (...), sermo insititius, the ingrafted word,
Jam. 1.21. (mention being made of Regeneration, ver. 18.) that is, which God by
the power of his Spirit, does, as it were, sow and Plant in the hearts of men,
that it may take root there, and bring forth fruit acceptable to God.

(1.) Seed as to outward appearance is but a mean thing, neither is its virtue
apparent or visible: So the word of God, is much despised and contemned in the
world, 1 Cor. 1.21.

2. Good Seed, cast into good ground, does germinate, and put forth a Plant, by
whose virtue and power it continues its kind: So the Word of God, received in a
good heart, makes a man such as it self is, that is, spiritual, and quickened
with a divine life, because that Seed is Spirit and Life, John 6.63.

(3.) That Seed may grow, there is need of the Suns heat, and Rain or Dew: So
God himself gives increase to the seed of the heavenly word, 1 Cor. 3.6, 7. The
Sun of Righteousness influences it with its celestial heat, and waters it with
the Rain or Dew of its Holy Spirit, Esa. 44.3. etc.

When the Verb [ To Sow] is attributed to God, To Sow.
it denotes a multiplication of blessings to men, Jer. 31.27. Hos. 2.25. Zach.
10.9. To which the phrase, Nah. 1.14. is contrary, the Lord has given a
Commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown, that is, thou
shall be slain, and shall perish without recovery.

When attributed to men, it signifies such things as are done in our life time,
from which good or evil is to be expected. And so expresses either the exercise
or practice of piety or impiety. Examples of the former are to be read, Psalm.
126, 5, 6. Prove. 11.8. Hos. 10.12. 2 Cor. 9.6. Of the latter, Prove. 22.8. Job
4.8. Jer. 4.3 Hos. 8.7. Of both, Gal. 6.8. etc.

When it is said of humane Bodies that they are sown, it denotes their Death
and Burial, 1 Cor. 15.42, 43, 44. To which the Resurrection from the Dead is
opposed. (...)
For the Apostle metaphorically changes the word speaking ver. 36. Of the Seed
as of the Body; but here of the Body as of Seed.

A [ Root] which is the Basis or lower part of the Plant, and the principle or
beginning of accretion is put for any original or foundation of a thing, Deuteronomy.
29.18. Esa. 14.30. Romans 11.16, 17, 18. 1 Timothy 6.10. Heb. 12.5. And for a
prosperous state of things, Job 29.19. Hence comes the phrase to take Root or
to Root, that is, to be in a good condition, or to multiply or thrive in any
outward blessing, Job 5.3. Psalm. 80.9. Esa. 27.6. and 37.31. Jer. 12.2. And on
the contrary, the drying up of the Root, denotes the destruction of the wicked,
Job 18.16. Esa. 5.24. Hos. 9.16. Mal. 4.1.

More specially the Roots of the feet (for so it is in the Hebrew, Job 13.29.
but in our English Translation, heels of my feet, an exposition rather than a
Translation) signify the heels or knuckle bones, because they are the lowest
part, as a Root is to a Plant. The Root of Jesse, Esa. 11.1. Seems to note the
Patriarchs from which Jesse and David were sprung.

To be Rooted.
To be Rooted is spoke of the Mystery of our Regeneration, and a corroboration
or strengthening in Faith and Piety is signified thereby, Ephesians. 3.18. Col. 2.7.
To which we may fitly compare, Job 19.28. But ye should say, why persecute we
him, seeing the Root of the matter is found in me? Branch.
that is, when Rooted by Faith in God I keep mine integrity, as Junius and
Tremellius expound it.

A [ Branch] with many Synonymous Terms is frequently proposed in Allegories
signifying by the similitude of a growing, green, and thriving Tree,
Prosperity, and on the contrary by the similitude of a withering Tree,
misfortune and calamity, Genesis 49.22. Job 15.32. and 29.19. (where (...)
signifies a Branch, as chap. 18.16.) Psalm. 80.10, 11. Esa. 25.5. Ezekiel. 17.6.
etc. and 16.10, 11. and 31.3. etc. Mal. 4.1. etc. By the term [ Branches] Paul
understands the Israelites of that time Romans 11.16, 17, etc. who were descended
(or proceed) of the first Patriarchs as from a Root. The Church is called the
Branch of Gods planting, Esa. 60.21. Because (as it were planted in Christ the
tree of Life,) he has a singular love and care for it, vegetating, comforting
and preserving it by his spirit, and at last eternally saving it.

Leaf.
A [ Leaf,] because it easily falls and withers, carries the notion of vileness
and vanity, Job 13.25. But in regard the leaves of some Trees are always green,
under the similitude of such a Tree, eternal Life is described, Ezekiel. 47.12.
See Rev. 22.2. also the Righteous who are Heirs of eternal Life, Psalm. 92.13,
14. With Psalm. 1.3. and 52.10.

The greeness of leaves is called a budding or germination, which word (viz.
dicitur proprie de terrae naescentibus and plantis.
(...)) is by a metaphor brought to signify, sometimes natural things, as the
hairs of the head and beard, Lev. 13.37. 2 Samuel 10.5. Judge. 16.22. Ezekiel. 16.7.
and 43.19. and 61.11. The word flourishing, reviving, or more properly growing
green again, is elegantly translated, Phil. 4.10. to signify the mind of man
stirred up by Love and Benevolence to no good. On the contrary to be dried up
or withered is put for Death or being taken away, Joel. 1.12.

A [ Flower] denotes prosperity, Esa. 5.24. See Job 15.33. Job 30.12. But
because a Flower is easily cut down, and withered, it is put for any thing that
is, frail, uncertain or transitory, Esa. 28.1, 4. Psalm. 103.15, 16. Jam. 1*
10.11. 1 Pet. 1.24. Esa. 40.6, 7, 8.

To [ Flourish] is put for a prosperous state of men, Psalm. 92.7.12; 13. and
132.18. Prove. 14.11. Esa. 27.6. Hos. 14.8. See also Esa. 66.14. Ezekiel. 17.24.
What is said Ezekiel. 7.10. The rod has blossomed, pride has budded, is
understood by most Interpreters of the King of the Assyrians, now growing to
the height of his Empire and authority, and preparing to besiege Jerusalem. The
Chald. The Empire flourishes, and the wicked is got up. But Junius and
Tremellius refer it to the people of Israel, translating it thus, that Tribe
flourishing did bud out pride, for (...) signifies both a Rod and a Tribe -- to
Flourish is also used of Ulcers and Leprosies, Exodus 9.9, 10. Levit. 13.39. etc.

[ Fruit] the metaphorical acceptance of this word is well known, and obvious
every where, viz. that it is put for the consequent or effect of a thing,
whether for good or evil. It Is put for the consequent reward of Godliness,
Psalm. 58.11. Verily there is a fruit for the Righteous (so the Hebrew.) The
Chald. Certainly there is a good reward for the just. So Esa. 3.10. Heb. 12.11.
Jam. 3.18.

It Is put for the punishment of impiety, Jer. 6.19. Behold I will bring evil
upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not
hearkened unto my words, nor to my Law but rejected it. The Chaldee says, the
retribution or reward of their works.

Good or evil works are also called Fruits, the good so called Matthew. 3.8. (see
Act. 26.20.) Romans 6.22. Gal. 5.22. Ephesians. 5.9. Phil. 1.11. Bad works. So called
Esa 10.12. Jer. 21.14. Romans 6, 21. The Reason of the Metaphor, is, because
Godly and Wicked men are compared to good and bad Trees, of which the one bring
forth good, the other bad Fruit, Matthew. 3.10. and 7.16. And the following
verses, chap. 12.33. Jude ver. 12.

Hence the Verb to [Fructifie] is put for the Study of Piety and good works,
Hos. 13.15. Luke 8.16. Romans 7.4. Col. 1.10. And inasmuch as that is the effect
of the Word of God, implanted by Faith in the hearts of men, therefore
fructifying is attributed to it, Col. 1.6. Hence the Apostle Paul says Romans
1.13. Now I would not have you ignorant Brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to
come unto you (but was let hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you
also (or in you) etc. that is, that it may appear to me when present, to the
comfort of my Spirit, that the Gospel is as fruitful among you, as others. As
good masters repute that fruit theirs, when their Disciples have commendably
profited under their Teachings. On the contrary, to bring forth unto Death, is
to be given up to wickedness, and perpetrate all evil works, Romans 7.5.

By another Metaphor the word preached is called the fruit of the Lips, Esa.
57.19: I create the fruit of the Lips, the Chald. the speech of the Lips; as
the Verb to fructify is put for speech, Prove. 10.31. Zach. 9.17. to be
unfruitful is attributed to such as want Faith, Tit. 3.14. 2 Pet. 1.18. To Evil
works, Ephesians. 5.11. To the Word of God, where it is not rightly received and
kept, Matthew. 13.22. Mark 4.19.

Hitherto we have treated of some parts of things growing out of the Earth: Now
we shall proceed. 1. Generally. 2. Specially, of the rest, which we shall
reckon in order.

A [ Plant] if attributed to God, his Church and Believens are to be
understood, To plant
Esa. 5.7. -- 60.21. -- 61.3. Ezekiel. 34.29. Hence Matthew. 15.13. Every plant
which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up, which denotes
such as are Heterodox, impious or hypocritical, in the garden of the Church, or
in its outward Communion without the root of the matter. The word Planting
attributed to God is sometimes taken generally, and signifies to form or make,
Psalm. 94.9. He that planted the Ear, sh^^ll he not hear? that is, he that
formed it. Sometimes specially, and signifies to carry on, bless, and increase
with felicity, Exodus 15.17. 2 Samuel 7.10. Psalm. 44.3. and 80.9. Esa. 40.24. Jer.
12.2. and 18.9. Ezekiel. 36.36. Amos 9.15.

On the contrary to Pluck up is put for to take away blessing, To pluck up.
to destroy and punish, Deuteronomy. 29.28. 2 Chronicles. 7.20. Jer. 18.7. and 31.28. Amos
9.15.

Sometimes this Plantation is most especially put to signify the restoration
made by Christ, and the sanctification of men to Life Eternal, Esa. 51.16.
Psalm. 92.14. Romans 6.5. To which belongs the term ingrafting, Romans 11.17, 19,
23, 24. put for the Communion of Saints in the Church. And in regard these
things are effected by the Preaching of the Word of God, therefore Planting
(and Watering necessary thereunto) is attributed to the Ministers thereof, 1
Cor. 3.6, 7, 8. where there is a most elegant subordination of these Planters
and Waterers to (...) him that gives the increase, viz. Jehovah, who by the
Ministry of the Word effectually operates or works out the Faith and Salvation
of men. To Plant is said of a Tent or Tabernacle, because the cords of a Tent
are fastened to Stakes fixed in the ground as Plants are fixed, etc. Dan. 11.45.

A [ Tree] is often used by way of similitude -- But in a Metaphor which is a
short or concise similitude, sometimes it refers to man, Jer. 11.19. Esa. 61.3.
Ezekiel. 17.24. Matthew. 3.10. and 12.33. Jude ver. 12. By which is signified his
condition whether good or evil. Sometimes it relates to some certain, wholesome,
or profitable thing, called for that Reason the Tree of Life, Pro. 3.18. --
11.30. -- 13.12.15.4.

More specially some certain Names of good Trees are put, Esa. 41.19. and
53.13. and 60.13. To signify the amenity or pleasantness of the Kingdom of
Christ, and the variety of its heavenly gifts, Zach. 11.1, 2. Men of various or
indifferent Estates in Israel; Cedars, Firr-Trees, Oaks, the Trees of the Wood
are expressed by Name. By Cedars and Oaks mentioned, Esa. 2.13. The Nobility
and great Ones of the Kingdom who were proud and elevated, are noted. Hence the
Chaldee renders it, The Kings of the people strong and mighty, and the Tyrants
of the Provinces. The Royal Family of David, from whence Christ according to
the Flesh was descended, is proposed by the Allegory of a Cedar, Ezekiel. 17.22.
The Lopping of Boughs, and Cutting down the thickets of the Forest, denotes
the destruction of the People, Esa. 10.18, 33, 34. and 40.24. Zach. 11.1, 2.

That part of a cut Tree, which is left above the Earth its called the Stock,
Stem or Trunk. (...) stipes truncus.
Which word is metaphorically translated, to denote the mean and humble
original of Christ according to the Flesh, or his temporal Nativity from the
progeny of David, Esa. 11.1. And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem
of Jesse, etc.

Beam.
A [ Beam] (...), and the disparate term (...), a mote, (which is a small
splinter flying out of a cleft piece of wood Hesych and Athen. lib. 13.) are
used to express the difference and degrees of sinners, Matthew. 7.3, 4, 5. Where
Christ Allegorically demonstrates the craft of Calumniators, who are mighty
curious and inqusitive into the failings or infirmities of others (although
slight like motes) but very blind and dull in examining their own faults,
(though grievous, great and weighty like a beam.) Here we have also an
admonition concerning our Duty, which is first to search our own wallet, which
hangs at our back, and having well shaken it and cleared it, we may proceed to
the examination of our Brothers Crime.

Thorns.
[ Thorns] sometimes signifies wicked and mischievous men, Numb. 33.55. Josh.
23.13. (In which the Enemies are emphatically called Thorns and Prickles in
their Eyes, that is, such as are of all things most troublesome and hurtful, so
as that the Eyes cannot endure, so much as a little chaff, mote, thorn or
prickle, without horrible torment) Psalm. 58.9. Esa. 9.18. -- 10.17. -- 27.4.
Ezekiel. 2.6. -- 28.4. See also because of the similitude, 2 Samuel 23.6, 7. Esa.
33.12. Nah. 1.10. Matthew. 7.16. Luke 6.44. etc. Sometimes Thorns signify
impediments met withal, Hos. 2.6. I will hedge up thy way with thorns, etc.
Jer. 4.3. Matthew. 13.7.22.

A Reed.
A [ Reed] is a weak shrub, easily agitated or shaken by a small gust of Wind, 2
Kings 14.15. Sometimes denotes men that are unc^^^tant, light, and of a
doubtful Faith, Matthew. 11.7. Luke 7.14. Sometimes men afflicted and penitent,
called a bruised Reed, Esa. 42.3. viz. A Reed of its self frail and weak, is
much more weak if it be shaken and bruised. Our Savior therefore promises that
he will not by any means break such, but rather strengthen, consolidate and
heal them.

Sometimes it signifies men, great indeed, but unable to help, that are more
mischievous and naught, on which some are apt to rely or depend, though to
their loss, as such do who lean on a weak and broken Reed, to their own
destruction, 2 Kings 18.21. Esa. 36.6. Ezekiel. 29.6, 7. A [ Rush] or Bulrush
signifies men of the basest and lowest condition, Esa. 9.14. -- 19.15.

Wormwood.
[ Wormwood] because of its ungrateful taste and extreme bitterness, is by a
metaphor brought to signify, sometimes sin, and evil, Deuteronomy. 29.18. Amos 5.7.
and 6.12. See Deuteronomy. 32.32. Esa. 5.20. Rev. 8.11. Sometimes punishment or
torment, Jer. 9.15. -- 23.15. Lam. 3.15, 19. See Prove. 5.4.

So much of the Species of things growing out of the Earth, which yield any
Metaphors, to which we may fitly subjoyn, where mention is made of the
containing Subject; Which is, (1.) A Wood. (2.) A Garden.


A Wood
A Wood, inasmuch as it contains many barren Trees, is a symbol of infidelity
and impiety, Esa. 32.15. And because it is full of Trees and Shrubs, it carries
the notion of an entire Army, Esa. 10.34. Of both which we have spoke before in
the 10th. Chap. where we spoke of Carmel and Lebanon.

A garden
A [ Garden] is the place of the most eminent and choicest Plants and Trees,
especially that first Garden which we call Paradise. The Church of Christ,
Cant. 4.12. is called a Garden enclosed (or barred) A Garden, because of its
spiritual fruitfulness; barred because hid to the World, hid with Christ in
God, Col. 3.3. The World knows us not, 1 John 3.1. The same Church with its
fruits of the Spirit, ver. 13. is called Paradise. Of which elsewhere.

[ Heaven,] or Eternal Life is called Paradise, Luke 23.43. 2 Cor. 12.4. Rev.
2.7. The reason of the metaphorical Appellation being drawn from the
extraordinary pleasantness of that Garden, and the great plenty of good things
there.

Of Metaphors taken from the Olive Tree and its Fruit.
AMongst the things growing in the Land of Canaan, three are most eminent, by
which its Goodness, Fruitfulness, and other Excellencies may be known, viz. The
Olive, which is a Tree -- The Vine, which is a Shrub -- And Grain or Corn of
all sorts. All which are joined together, Deuteronomy. 14.23. -- 18.4. Psalm. 104.14,
15, 16. etc. Jer. 31.11. Hos. 2.8, 22. Joel. 2.19. and in the common Version,
Genesis 27.37. Psalm. 4.7, 8. Where the Syriack Interpreter expresses all three.

From each of these, and things that bear affinity or relation to them, there
are a great many delicate Metaphors deduced in Scripture.

The People of Israel are called an Olive, because of the great dignity with
which they were invested by God, Jer. 11.16. The Lord called thy Name, Jer.
11.16.
a green Olive Tree, fair and of goodly fruit; as if he had said thou have been
like a green and leafy Olive, which most beautifully flourishes, giving
extraordinary hope of its Fruit. But the Antithesis follows -- With the noise
of a great tumult (or tempests) he has kindled fire upon it, a^^d the branches
of it were broken, that is, as Junius and Tremellius have interpreted it, they
shall be like encountering storms of Winds, which rushing into this place shall
shake down thy flowers, break the branches, that is, they will destroy small
and great. Afterward they will consume with fire the very Town, as if it were
the stump of a Tree: That these things were transacted, the last Chapters of
the Kings, Chronicles, and Jeremiah do fully make it out ver. 17. This Olive is
said to be planted by the Lord, etc.

Zach. 4. What are called the two Olives, Zach. 4.14.
ver. 3, 11, 12. are said to be the two Sons of Oil, (so the Hebrew) ver. 14.
that is, two Oleaginous Olives, plentiful, fat, having as it were a spring of
Oil, continually flowing. This Metaphor signifies the perpetual supplies of
spiritual gifts to the Church through Christ, who was beyond measure anointed
with the Oil of gladness, Psalm. 45.7. from whom believers have this unction, 1
John 2.20.27. But this was spoken to in the Chapter of an Anthropopathy.

Romans 11.17. The Church of Israel is called an Olive eminent for fatness, Romans
11.17.
whose root Abraham may be said to be, with respect to the Covenant, God entered
into, with him, and the promise of a blessed seed, divine benediction, and
Eternal Life made to his believing posterity, (that is his Sons by Faith, who
believe as he did, such being only the Sons of Abraham) whether Jews or
Gentiles, Gal. 3.29. This being observed, it is easy for any one to understand
why the Gentiles are compared to a Wild Olive, and what this ingrafting into
the Olive, is; and the partaking of its root and fatness, (that is, the fatness
proceeding from the Root, and diffused to the Branches, by the figure
Hendiadys) as also the cutting off of the branches.

Rev. Rev. 11.4.
The two Witnesses raised by God (by whom those sincere few Teachers of the
Church, in the midst of the Antichristian Tyranny and fury preserved by God,
are understood, expressed by the number two because in the month of two or
three Witnesses every Truth shall be established, Deuteronomy. 19.15. 2 Cor. 13.1.)
are called two Olives and two Candlesticks standing before the God of the
Earth. In the former Metaphor we are to understand the consolation of the Word
of God given by the Holy Spirit the Oil of gladness, as also fruitfulness in
good Works, as the Olive is a most fruitful Tree, and Constancy and
Perseverance in the Faith under persecutions, as the leaves of the Olive do not
wither, but are always green, and the wood of the Olive Tree never rots through
age: In the latter Metaphor Divine Illumination from the Word of God is
understood, that this is taken from the forecited place of Zach. 4. is evident.

Oil.
[ Oyl] The Fruit of the said Tree, is much valued, and much used amongst all
sort of People and Nations. In Scripture Metaphors, sometimes it denotes an
abundance of pleasant and acceptable things, Deuteronomy. 32.13. Job 29.6. Sometimes
Joy and Refreshment of mind, if considered with respect to the anointing, Esa.
23.5. Psalm. 92.10. and 141.5. Cant. 1.3. Esa. 61.3. The Reason of the Metaphor
is taken from the fragrancy and wholesomeness of this fruit. From hence we may
in a manner give a reason for the Name of Christ and Christians, it being
derived from the Unction or anointing of the Holy Spirit, which is compared to
Oil.

Esa. 10.27. There is mention made of Oil. And it shall come to pass on that
day, Esa. 10.27.
that his burden shall be removed from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off
thy Neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed from the face of Oil, or from before
the Oil -- Which the Chald. expounds of the Messiah, Junius and Tremellius
follow that exposition: Propter Oleum, because of the Oil (or Anointing) that
is, thou shall be delivered by Christ, or for the sake of Christ, in whom rests
the Spirit of Jehovah, who Anointed him, chapt. 61.1. The Cause of that
deliverance and vengeance is intimated, viz. The promise sometimes made to this
People, of sending Christ to them, who is signified by the word Oil, because he
was to be Anointed with the Oil of gladness above his fellows, etc.

Metaphors from the Vine, etc.
A [ Vineyard] the place where Vines are planted, in a continued Metaphor and
Parable signifies the Church as well of the old as New Testament, Cant.
8.11.12. Esa. 3.14. and 5.1. etc. Esa. 27.2, 3, 6. Matthew. 20.1. etc. Of which
pleasant similitude many have writ much. The quiet or free Plantation of
Vineyards exhibits the notion of spiritual peace in the Kingdom of Christ, Esa.
65.21.22. See Deuteronomy. 28.30, 39. 1 Kings 4.25. Micah 4.4. etc.

A [ Vine] sometimes signifies good, sometimes evil. Examples of the former are
to be read, Psalm. 80.9. etc. Esa. 5.2, 7. Jer. 2.21. Where the People of Israel
introduced into the Land of Canaan, received as the people of God that they may
serve him constantly in Righteousness and Piety, is understood. But this
becomes degenerate, offending God with foul Idolatry and impiety; all which by
the Metaphor of a Vine, well planted, but much corrupted, is expressed in the
two last places.

It is taken in an Ill sense, Deuteronomy. 32.32, 33. where mention is made of a Vine,
Grapes, Clusters, and Wine, expressing the cruel and abominable wickedness of
sinners.

Expositors are not agreed in what sense to take a Vine, Hosea 10.1. But the
most proper interpretation seems to be this (...) vitis evacuans.
Israel is an emptying Vine, that is, it plentifully brings forth fruit like a
luxuriant Vine, as if it would at once empty it self of all its fruit. Yet it
produces not good, but bad fruit (it is the Vine of Sodom and Gomorrah, Deuteronomy.
32.32, 33. plentifully bringing forth wild Grapes, Esa. 5.2.) for it follows,
he brings forth fruit unto himself: According to the multitude of his fruit
he has increased the Altars, etc. See Metaphor of a Vine in the second Book.

Hosea. 9.7, 10.
The phrase [ to sit under his own Vine and Fig-Tree] is a description of
security, peace, and tranquillity, 1 King. 4.25. 2 King. 18.31. For the Jews
were wont to love their Vines and Fig Trees beyond any other Trees; partly for
the sweetness of the Fruit, Judge. 9.11.13. And partly for the convenience of
the shade. For (as Pliny calls them) branched or spreading Vines, Plin. lib. 17
cap. 2. vites compluviatae.
or (as Columella. lib. 3. cap. 2. Calls them) such as are perched upon Rails
or Galleries in the form of an Arbor, covering it on all parts do afford a
cool and delightsome shade, for repose or banqueting.

As to the Fig Tree, (as Pliny has it) its leaf is very large, lib. 16. cap. 26.
and consequently very shadowing, which may be gathered also from Genesis 3.7. --
This phrase ( to sit under his own Vine and Fig Tree) is Metonymical, in as
much as it is a sign of public peace and tranquillity; and Synecdochical, in
as much as by these two Species of Trees and Plants, all sorts of Vineyards,
Gardens, Fields, etc. are understood: But Metaphorically the inward, and
spiritual peace of the Kingdom of Christ is expressed by it, Micah. 4.4. Zach.
3.10. etc.

[ Wine and New Wine] signify as well the effects of divine Mercy and Grace,
as of Wrath and Vengeance. Examples of the former are to be read, Prove. 9.5.
Cant. 2.4. Esa. 55.1. Joel. 3.23. Zach. 9.17. In which places by the Metaphor
of Wine, the blessings or benefits of the Kingdom of Christ are expressed;
which are Righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. As natural Wine is
said to cheer or make glad the Heart of man, Psalm. 104.15. and that it chears
the heart of God and man, Judge. 9.13. So Jehovah is (as it were) cheered and
delighted, with the Conversion, Faith, and Piety of men, Esa. 62.5.

Examples of the latter are to be read, Psalm. 60.3. and 75.8. Illyricus says
that, by this similitude he signifies most heavy afflictions, etc. Rev. 14.10.
and 18.6. etc. Esa. 1.22. Thy Wine mixed with Water, denotes the corruption of
all orders in Israel, as the foregoing and following words show. The Septuagint
rendens it (...), thy Taverners mix wine with water, 2 Cor. 2.17. (...).
from whence they say that metaphorical speech of Paul is deduced, 2 Cor. 2.17.
For we are not as many, (...), taverning the word of God. This word (which our
Bibles render corrupting the word of God,) is very emphatical, Aret.
it is a Metaphor taken from Hosts, Victuallers, Inkeepers. or rather
Tavern-keepers, who corrupt, and adulterate their Wines; Dr. Sclat.
By which the Apostle elegantly inculcates two things, (1.) Their adulterating
the word of God by the mixture of their own fancies. (2.) Their Covetousness
and Study of filthy gain.


The Verb (...), is properly understood of Wine-sellers, and is here
metaphorically translated to signify deceitful dealing, as it is expounded, 2
Cor. 4.2.

Chrysostom, says, (...), in English, this is, (cauponari) to Tavern, when any
one adulterates wine, when any one sells a thing of that kind for Money, which
he ought to give freely. The Syriack renders, for we are not as the rest who
mix (or adulterate by mixtures) the word of God, etc. Jer. 23.28. 1 Timothy 6.5. 2
Pet. 2.3.

[ The Dregs or Lees of Wine] are metaphorically used two ways.

1. Either denoting very great Calamities, Psalm. 75.8. Esa. 51.17. Upon which
Illyricus: As the Cup signifies its part of the cross and castigation, Sicut
poculum, etc.
which God in his own time distributes or gives out to every one: So the dregs
of that draught do signify the most bitter part of the calamity or punishment.
See Ezekiel. 23.32, 33, 34.

2. Someties signifying secure tranquillity, as Zeph. 1.12. I will punish the
men that are settled (or concrete, curdled, thickened) on their Lees, that is,
such as with great security, tranquillity, and self conceited firmness stick
close to their wickedness, mocking and deriding both God and Men. See Jer.
48.11. Esa. 25.6. with Jer. 48.11.

[A Vintage and Gleaning,] Judge. 8.2. Is not the gleaning of the Grapes of
Ephraim, better than the Vintage of Abjezer? By the Vintage he understands the
fight it self, by the gleanings the pursuit of the flying Enemy, as if he had
said, we Abjezerites have not acquired so much honor by fighting, as you
Ephramites have by your brave pursuit of those we routed, when ye took their
Leaders, who, had they been safe (the Enemy being not else truly overcome)
might easily recruit their Army.

Jer. 49.9
The Text Jerem. 49.9. is to be expounded by a Metaphor, if the Grape gatherers
will not come to thee, will they not leave (some) gleaning Grapes? The Chaldee
renders it Thieves or Robbers, like Grape gatherers. The same form of speaking
Obad. ver. 5. (properly to be understood) is proposed by way of Interrogation:
If the Grape gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleanings? As if
he had said they would: But thine Enemies sent by me, will carry away all that's
yours, even to the very gleanings. See Jer. 6.9. In that symbolical Vision, the
Vineyard denotes the Judgment of God against the Churches enemies, Rev.
14.18.19. The reason of this Metaphor is, because in a Vintage or Wine Harvest
the Vineyard together with its fruit is stripped of all, and left as it were
desolate. Hence it is that little gleanings (small clusters remaining on the
Vine, Gleanings.
after the Vintage is over, because hid behind the leave) denote a small
remnant of people after war or other public calamity. Esa. 17.6.

So the Verb (racemare) to glean (viz. to gather the little clusters left after
the Vintage, Lev. 19.10. Deuteronomy. 24.21.) denotes the destruction of such as
survived the former calamity, etc. Jer. 6.9. etc Judge. 20.45.

[ A Wine-Press] (where the Grapes are bruised, and the juice squeezed out,
denotes divine vengeance, Esa. 63.3. Lam. 1.5. Rev. 14.19. So Joel. 3.13. Come
get you down, for the press is full, the fats overflow, etc. This is a Divine
call to the Angels (or strong ones of God) to proceed to the execution of his
vengeance against his impious Enemies -- Of whom he subjoyns for their
wickedness is great.

Metaphors from Corn, etc.
A Field] the place of the production of Corn or grain, denotes in a Parable
the People of God or the Church of Christ, Matthew. 13.8, 23, 24, 31, 38. Luke
8.8, 15. etc. To which refers the similitude of the Apostle, Heb. 6.7.8. whose
(...) posterior pars comparationis opposita protasi. Call.
Apodosis, (reddition, or answering part of the comparison,) is not expressly
set down, yet it is tacitly hinted at by the terms rejection, cursing, and
burning, v. 8. that is, that unbelievers and wicked men, who, like a Field
untilled bring forth Thorns and Briars, and act nothing but evil, shall be
reprobated of God, cursed and consumed in Everlasting fire: Whereas on the
contrary, Believers and godly men shall receive the blessing of God, because
like a fertile field of which he speaks ver. 7. The Apostle Paul by a Metaphor
calls the Church the (...), agricolationem.
Husbandry or Tillage of God. 1 Cor. 3.9. Or rather a Field, which is
spiritually tilled by the Apostles and other Ministers of the word, as ver. 6,
7, 8. is intimated.

Plowing.
[ Plowing] is a preparation of the Field for Sowing; by which calamity and
affliction is sometimes noted, Psalm. 129.3. (See the express similitude, Esa.
28.24.26.) The reason is taken from the cutting or (as it were) wounding of the
Field, by the Plow-share. Sometimes the Life and Actions of men whether good or
evil.

Good, as Jer. 4.3. Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among Thorns, Hos.
10.12. Sow to your selves in Righteousness, reap in mercy: Break up your fallow
ground, etc where by the term plowing true Repentance, and the culture or
dressing of piety is understood: The Reason is taken from the end and effect of
plowing, which is to pluck up and destroy Thorns, Briars, and the Roots of bad
Herbs, and rightly to dispose the Field to bear good fruit. Examples are to be
read, Job 4.8. Hos. 10.13. Prove. 21.4.

Jer. 14.18.
Judge. 14.18. To plow with ones heifer, is to use another help (where the
reason of the continued Metaphor is very congruous.) The speech is of the
Marriage of Sampson, whose Bride was fitly compared to an Heifer, as being now
under the same yoke with her husband, from whence the name Conjugium or
Yoke Fellow comes. lib. 2. Carm. od. 5.
Hence Horace lib. 2. Carm. Od. 5. compares a proud and lascivious Maid to an
untamed Heifer. etc.

[ To Plow] is properly to turn the divided Earth, so as that the inner or
under part may be heaved up to the superficies, or top; and metaphorically
((...)) denotes a search or through inquisition into secret or inward things.
The sense therefore of Samsons phrase is, that it would be impossible for them
to have found out the meaning of his riddle, unless they had drawn out (by some
subtlety) the original and sense of it from his spouse.

Luke 9* 62. No man having put his hand to the Plow, Luke 2.62.
and looking back is fit for the Kingdom of God: As if he had said (according
to Erasmus his paraphrase) This is the most arduous and chief business (viz. of
my discipling and Gospel Preaching) that he which once enters into a
profession, is concerned by continual care and study to proceed to more
perfection, and not to suffer his heart or mind to decline or draw back to the
sordid cares or desires of things past. This Metaphor is taken from husbandmen,
who are obliged to a continual and uninterrupted care and study, in tilling and
plowing their Fields which agrees well with, 1 Cor. 3.9. as before.

[ Corn and Wheat] metaphorically denote whatsoever is good and profitable,
Psalm. 72.16.
Psalm. 72.16. There shall be an handful of Corn in the Earth upon the top of
the Mountains, the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon, etc. The sense or
meaning is, that in the time of the Messiah (of whom the whole Psalm treats)
all things will be happily, and divinely blessed; which by the increase (or
multiplication of little Corn,) in unfruitful Fields, such as by Mountains tops
increasing with great plenty, is expressed. See Jer* 23.28. What is the chaff
to the Wheat? says the Lord, that is, wherein do the false Prophets and their
Doctrine agree with the Prophets and the Word of the Lord? The Chald. expounds
it of the Righteous or Believers: Behold as chaff differs from Wheat; so the
Righteous differ from the wicked, says the Lord. With which exposition Matthew.
3.12. and 13.29, 30. agree. By Wheat, the Righteous and Believers are
understood, to whom in the first place chaff, in the latter Tares, that is,
impious, unbelieving and condemned persons are opposed. In the former Metaphor,
Manna rained from heavenly is called the Corn of Heaven, Psalm. 78.24. Because
it was like Corn or Wheat, and was equally useful in point of nourishment.

[ Harvest] is the seasonable time of gathering in Corn or any other fruit;
Harvest.
from which some Metaphors are reduced and that in a twofold manner.

1. Men are proposed as the efficient cause or Harvest men. Or, 2. As the
object, that is, handfuls or fruits measured.
In the first sense, [ Harvest] answering the expectation or hope of the
husbandman, denotes the reward of piety, or the punishment of the ungodly: For
as every one sows, so he shall reap, Gal. 6.8. As the Apostle speaks in general
terms. And more specially subjoyns the harvest and reward of good and bad works
ver. 8, 9. The [ Harvest] is taken for the reward of piety, Psalm. 126.5, 6.
where the state of the Godly Sowing in this World, and the enjoyment of glory
in the heavenly life by [ Harvest or Reaping] is by a metaphorical phrase
expressed. See Hos. 10.12. 2 Cor. 9.6. etc. Job 4.8. Prove. 22, 8. Hos. 8.7. To
set an Harvest for any, Hos. 6, 11. is to seduce to Idolatry, etc. and so give
cause for being divinely punished, upon which place see Tarnovius in his
Comment. Junius and Tremellius, and Piscator.

2. Because two things are most remarkable in Harvest, viz.

(1.) That Corn or Fruits are cut or plucked down, and so wither.

(2.) That they are reposited or placed in Barns, etc. to be preserved for use,
there arises a twofold Metaphorical notion from the term [ Harvest.]

1. To denote the Judgments of God, Jer. 51.33. Joel 3.18. Rev. 14.15, 16, 17.
where it is evident from ver. 19. that the wrath of God is noted.

2. The gathering of the Church, Matthew. 9.37, 38. Luke 10.2. John 4.35, 38. In
the former places the wicked are (as it were) Mowed or Reaped down, and like
Tares, cast into the fire, as Christ speaks of the Harvest of the last or
eternal Judgment, Matthew. 13.39. etc. In the last place the godly are (as it
were) placed in a garner fit for use, etc.

Besides what is spoken of [ Harvest] denotes the benefit of freedom, (or
deliverance) Jer. 3.20. The Harvest is past, the Summer is ended, and we are
not saved, that is, all the benefits of the hoped-for Salvation and help fail
us, and we consequently perish. For Joy is commonly figured in Scripture, by
Harvest and Vintage which is at the end of Summer, Psalm. 4.7. Esa. 9.3. In both
those times, (viz. of the receiving Corn and Wine) there is matter of Joy
administered to men.

Reapers.
The Ministers and Preachers of the Word of God, are metaphorically called by
Christ [ Harvest men or Reapers] in this spiritual Harvest, which is the
gathering of the Church, John 4.36, 37, 38. where there is an eminent
comparison of those which Sow and those which Reap, etc. where by ( Sowers) he
understands the Prophets of the Old Testament; and by Reapers the Apostles he
sent in Gospel times. The Prophets promulgated the promises of Christ's being to
come, and so, as it were did throw the seeds of Gospel universal Preaching. The
Patriarchs and Prophets weeded, and cleared the field of God, of the Thorns and
Briars of Idolatry by the Preaching of the Law, as before, etc.

Matthew. 9.37, 38. Luk 10.2. The Ministers of the word are called (...),
Laborers in this spiritual Harvest. In which places we are taught the great
necessity of a Ministry in the Church, as well as of Laborers to save and
gather the Harvest fruit.

Threshing.
[ Threshing] in Scripture metaphorically denotes punishment and calamity, Esa.
21.10. O my Threshing and the Son of my Floor (we render it Corn of my Floor)
so by an Apostrophe he calls the People of God, who were grievously afflicted
in Babylon, and as it were Threshed and ventilated upon a Floor, till separated
from its chaff and husks -- See Jer. 51.33. Amos 1.3. Micah 4.13. Hab. 3.12.
Jud. 8.7. Esa. 28.27, 28.

Chaff.
[ Chaff and Stubble] which is separated from the Corn by Threshing, winnowing
or sifting, signifies the destruction of the wicked, Obad. ver. 18. Mal. 4.1.
Matthew. 3.12. Luke 3.17. It denotes false doctrine, 1 Cor. 3.12. with which may
be compared. Jer. 23.28. See Psalm. 1.3, 4, and 83.13.14. Esa. 17.13. and 41.2.
Jer. 13.24. Hos. 13.3. Zeph. 2.2. etc.

Winnowing.
[ Winnowing] denotes the scattering of Enemies, as chaff is blown away from the
grain when winnowed, Jer. 51.2. and 15.7. Also the separation of the godly from
the Reprobate, Matthew. 3.12. In which Allegorical speech by (...) the floor, we
are to understand the Church of Christ, scattered through Judea and the whole
world; by (...), Fan, the means by which Christ separates beleivers from
hypocrites and wicked men, which means are the preaching of the Gospel, the
Cross and Tribulation, and lastly eternal judgment; by the purging of his
floor, the very act of separating; by Wheat, Believers; by Chaff, Reprobates;
by the Garner or Barn, the K^^^dom of Heaven and Eternal Life: And by
unquenchable fire, hellish and eternal punishment, etc.

[ Sifting] denotes diabolical temptation, Luke 22.31. The grain thereby is
jumbled and agitated, Sifting.
Amos 9.9. and some get or drop through and are lost among the chaff and dust
-- Thus Satan would confound the Disciples of Christ, shake off (...) Faith,
and by his Temptations pluck them away from Christ. And as Sifting (...) means
to cleanse the Corn: So Christ by these Trials and Afflictions purges his
dis^^^ples, as grain is cleared from chaff, and most wisely converts those
malignant Artifices of the Devil unto good, etc,

Grinding.
[ Grinding] by which grain is bruised, broken small, and reduced into Meal fit
to be made into Bread, Esa. 47.2. is used to describe most hard servitude and
captivity -- Take the Milstones and grind Meal -- (in the Eastern Countries it
was counted as great a slavery or servitude to be committed to the Mill, or
Bakehouses, as men esteem it now to be committed to the Galleys. See Exodus
11.5. Judge. 16.21.) by this speech the Prophet would signify, that that Queen
of Babylon, the mistress of Kingdoms, that is, tender and delicate, shall be
obnoxious to most abject servitude, and that there will come an extreme change
of her splendour, etc.

Job 31.10. Let my wife grind to another, that is, as Illyricus expounds it,
let her be the basest of Servants to another, or as Vatablus says, let her be
forced away from me and become another, etc.

[ Bread] made of Meal, that staff of Life, sometimes denotes joyful, Bread.
sometimes mournful things.

1. Joyful, as Psalm. 105.40. He satisfied them with the bread of heaven; Manna
is called the bread of heaven, because it was food for the Israelites, and
served for bread, And Psalm. 78.25. It is called the bread of the Mighty, (or of
the strong) that is, as (...), Angelorum Esca. sap. 16.20.
the Chald. the Septuagint, the vulgar Version, and Luther render it, the bread
of Angels, that is, such bread as these heavenly administrators of the Divine
Will shall supply you with, and not any humane help. And they are said to be
strong because God communicates such power to them, etc.

When Christ calls him the bread of life, having respect to manna, it is an
evident Metaphor, John 6.32.33. Life Eternal is expressed by the eating of
bread in the Kingdom of God, Luke 14.15. and 22.30. By eating of stolen bread
and drinking stolen waters, Prove, 9.17. The breach of Wedlock, or that short
and wild lust of the flesh which is in Adultery, is understood, and which
destruction and eternal death accompany. See Job 20.5. etc.

2. It signifies mournful or sad things, Numb. 14.9. Fear not the people of the
Land for they are bread for us; that is, we shall easily overcome and consume
them, as if they were our bread. It agrees hereto that Bread, and war or
fighting come from the same Hebrew Root and Original; and that the Sword is
said to Eat when it kills, 2 Samuel 11.25. Affliction, and Calamity are expressed
by the bread of tears, Psalm. 80.5. In which sense also Tears are said to be the
bread (or meat) of man day and night, Psalm. 24.3.

[ Leaven] (made of a sharp or sour mass) taken in an evil sense, Leaven.
denotes the Corruption of Doctrine, Matthew. 16.16. Luke 12.1. (hypocrisy, that
is, a dissembling of true Religion) sometimes wickedness and pravity of life, 1
Cor. 5.7, 8. The reason of both is evident from the operation of ferment or
Leaven, a little of which penetrates the whole lump, making it sour and acid:
So False Doctrine and impiety of manners, easily penetrates, to the seduction
of others, and unless speedily prevented will quickly infect and contaminate
the whole. The text which we translate My heart was grieved, Psalm. 73.21. In
the Hebrew is, my heart is fermented, (leavened or grown sharp) that is, it is,
embittered, and full of perturbation -- The Chald. it is anxious or sadden'd,
etc.

Of Metaphors from the Parts and Members of Living Creatures.
WE are distinctly to consider of Brutes. As, (1.) Their Parts and Members.
(2.) Their general Names, Effects and Adjuncts. (3.) Their several Species or
Kinds.


Their Parts and Members, we will recite in that order that nature has disposed
of them. What concerns the Head of Brutes we shall expound, when we treat of
their respective Species.

[ The Horn] of some four footed Beasts, their principal ornament, Horn.
and the instrument whereby they exercise their Strength and defend themselves,
is variously used in Scripture Metaphors.

1. It denotes Power, Strength, Glory and Courage, 1 Samuel 2.1. Job 16.15. Psalm.
75.10. and 89.17, 24. and 112.9. and 148.14. Jer. 48.25. Lam. 2.3, 17. Ezekiel.
29.21. Amos 6.13. An Iron Horn] is a symbol of greater power and strength,
Micah 4.1^^. So when the Horn of the Unicorn is mentioned, a Beast of more
strength than others, Deuteronomy. 33.17. Psalm. 22. and 92.11.

2. It denotes Rule or Government, the Majesty of which consists in power,
fortitude, and strength (some say, because the King is eminent in dignity above
all his people, as the Horn is above all the Members of the Creature) 1 Samuel
2.10. He shall exalt the horn of his anointed, where the holy Woman (viz.
Hannah) has respect to the Kingdom of the Messiah. The Chaldee renders it (...)
Kingdom, both here and in Jer. 48.25.

Psalm. 132.17. There I will make the Horn of David to bud, that is, I will
amplify, enlarge and propagate the strength of his Kingdom. This also most
perfectly appertains to the Messiah, David's Son. Chald. There will I cause to
bud a Precious King to the House of David. See 1 Chronicles. 25.5.

This signification of power, and a Kingdom, is proposed, as it were by a
lively metaphor and similitude, in that symbolical action of Zedekiah the false
Prophet, 1 Kings 22.11. Also in the Prophetical visions, Dan. 7.7, 8, 21. and
chap. 8.3. etc. Zach. 1.18. etc. where the fierce and strong Enemies of the
Church are understood, Rev. 5.6. and 12.3. and 13.1, 11. and 17.3, 7, 12, 16.

[ To push with the Horn] metaphorically signifies an exerting or putting forth
of strength or power against the Enemy in fighting, Cornupetere. (...).
Deuteronomy. 33.17. Psalm. 44.5, 6. 1 King. 22.11. Dan. 11.40.

In other things a Horn signifies.

1. A more eminent place, Esa. 5.1. My beloved has a Vineyard, in the Horn of
the Son of Oil, (so the Hebrew) that is, in a sublime and very fat place. The
Land of Canaan which flowed with Milk and Honey seems to be signified by this
description; for into this, the People of Israel were like a Vine, transplanted
or translated, Psalm. 80.8.

2. Sometimes Angels, Corners or Eminencies, having the form of Horns, Exodus
27.2. and 29.12. Lev. 4.7. 1 King. 1.51. Jer. 17.1. and elsewhere, so in the
Syriack and Chaldee Tongues the extreme or angular point. Buxt of. in lexic.
Chald. Syriaco p. 511, 512.


3. Splendour or a sparkling Ray, like a Horn, Habak. 3.4, And his brightness
was as the light, he had Horns (or as the Chaldee has it, bright beams) coming
out of his hand. Hence the Verb (...) signifies to diffuse beams in the
likeness of Horns, Exodus 34.29, 30, 35, where the speech is of Moses, when his
face shined. Chald. the splendour of the glory of his face was multiplied; to
which Version Paul seems to have respect, 2 Cor. 3.7. etc.

A [ Mouth] because it is hollow, concave, and open, and the beasts instrument
of biting, Mouth.
has therefore two metaphorical notions.

(1.) The Orifice of any thing, an entrance or gaping hole, and so it is said,
Genesis 42.27. The Sacks mouth,, Genesis 29.2, 3, 8, 10. The Wells mouth -- Also of a
Den, Josh. 10.18, 22, 27. Of the Robe and Habergeon, Exodus 39.23. (for so the
Hebrew) Psalm. 133.2. Of the Gate of a City, Prove. 8.3. Of the brook, Esa, 19.7.
The edge of the Sword, by which (as it were it bites,) hurts and cuts, Genesis
34.26. Exodus 17.13. Numb. 21.25. Deuteronomy. 13.15. and elsewhere -- Of the file it
is said, 1 Samuel 13.21. A file having mouths, that is, full of incisures the
better to sharpen Iron. So when [ Mouths] in the plural are attributed to a
Sword, it denotes its two edges, Judge. 3.16. Psalm. 149.5, 6. Prove. 5.4. So to
rake or harrow, Esa. 41.15. See 2 King. 10.21. and 21.16. Ezra. 9.11. etc.

What are done by the Mouth, Tongue and Teeth of Beasts we will here together
dispatch.

(...) mordere.
[ To Bite] (For the most part is attributed to Serpents, Numb. 21.7, 8. Genesis
49.17. Eccl. 10.8, 11. Jer. 8.17. Amos 9.3. etc.) is put for hostile invasion,
spoil, and tearing in pieces, Hab. 2.7. For the pains of body or mind, by
reason of Drunkenness, or the relicts of Wine, Prove. 23.32. For Usury, Exodus
22.25. Lev. 25.36. Deuteronomy. 23.19. Psalm. 15.4, 5. Prove. 28.8. Ezekiel. 18.8, 13.17.
and 22.12. vorax usura.
So Lucan calls it devouring Usury. It is said of false Prophets that they Bite
with their Teeth, Micah. 3.5. that is, like Wild-Beasts they tear and destroy
the flock -- Others think this phrase to be no Metaphor, but to be understood
of the eating of pleasant food.

[ To Eat and Devour (...)] in a Metaphorical signification is the same with
(to destroy and consume) Exodus 15.7. Isa. 9.12. The Syrians before, To devour
and eat.
and the Philistines behind, and they shall Devour Israel with the whole mouth
--, that is, after the manner of Ravenous beasts, they shall most inhumanely
Treat them, captivate, spoil, and consume them.

[ To Swallow, Gulch down, etc.] is of the same Metaphorical Notation, To
swallow.
2 Samuel 17.16. Job 10.8. and 20.18. and 37.20. Psalm. 35.24, 25. Psalm. 52.5, 6.
and 107. 26, 27. Psalm. 124.3. Isa. 3.12. and 28.7. Lam. 2.2. Hos. 8.8. Hab.
1.13. 1 Cor. 15.54. 2 Cor. 2.7. 1 Pet. 5.8. Number. 4.20. Prove. 19.28. To [ Lick,]
has the same signification, Number. 22.4. of which, and the Tongue, we have
treated before.

[ A Tooth] Metaphorically denotes a Promontory or sharp Rock hanging over or
formed like a Tooth. 1 Samuel 14.4. Job 39.28. Tooth.
But when Teeth are attributed to Men, it denotes virulence, and a hostile
Power; the Metaphor being taken from beasts, who for they most part when they
fight, use their teeth as offensive weapons to annoy those they set upon, Psalm.
3, 7, 8. and 57.5. and 58.6, 7. and 124.5, 6. Job 29.17. Prove. 30.14. etc.

A Lip Metaphorically signifies a bank of a River, or the mouth of a Vessel, A
Lip.
Genesis 22.17. and 41.17. 1 Kin. 7.23, 24, 26. 2 Kin. 2.13. 2 Chronicles. 2.2.5.

The Hinder part of the Neck (Cervix) if [ hard, or to be hardened] be added,
Metaphorically denotes contumacy, stubbornness, and a refractory Mind; the
Metaphor being taken from horses, or other untamed Beasts, who being wild and
ungovernable, will not suffer their Necks to be bended as the Rider would have
it. Exodus 32.9. and 33.3, 5. and 34.9. Deuteronomy. 9.6, 13. and 31.27. 2 Kin. 17.14.
2 Chronicles. 30.8. and 36.13. Isa. 48.4. Jer. 7.26. and 19.15. Nehem. 9.17, 29.
Prove. 29.1. Psalm. 75.5.

The word [ to Behead] Metaphorically signifies to demolish or break down Hos.
10.2. He (that is God) shall behead their Altars. To Behead.
They had certain Altars placed aloft, as if they had little Heads, and also
Horns, etc.

The [ Wings] of a Bird, Wings.
because 1. They are its outward Members. And 2. Because they are sometimes
expanded at large. And 3. Because they are the instruments of swift flight
through the Air; do yield a threefold Metaphor.


(1.) They denote the extreme or outward part of a Garment, Number. 15.38. Ruth
3.9. 1 Samuel 24.5. Jer. 2.34. Hag. 2.12. Zach. 8.23. etc.

(2.) The sides or disposed ranks of a whole Army, Isa. 8.8. Dan. 9.27. The
extreme or remote parts of the Earth, Job 37.3. and 18.13. Isa. 11.12. and
24.16. Ezekiel. 7.2. etc.

(3.) The wings of the Sun and the Morning are the first rays of light suddenly
(like Wings) expanded over the whole Earth, Psalm. 139.9. Mal. 4.2. on the
contrary Virgil thus speaks.

Nox ruit, and fuscis tellurem amplectitur alis.
Night rushes on, and does the Earth embrace
With swarthy wings; --
The wings of the wind, denote its celerity and impetuous course, 2 Samuel 22.11.
Psalm. 18.10. and 104.3. These three attributes of wings meet in one Text, Isa.
18.1. Woe to the land the shadow of Wings.
Isa. 18.1. VVoe to the land the shadow of wings, (so the Hebrew) Where by
those Vmbratile wings, are understood the sails of Ships, which are the extreme
parts expanded in form of wings, and when filled with wind, are the cause of
the Ships swift motion; And are withal a shadow to the Sailors; the Chaldee has
it thus, VVoe to the land to which men come from a far Country in ships, and
their sails are expanded like an Eagle, which flies with his wings. Junius and
Tremellius by wings understand the Coasts of the Land, that is, a land shady
because of the great and opacous Mountains that environ it, such being every
where about the Red Sea, as Strabo in his last book of Geography tells us.

To Fly.
[ To Fly] which is the property of Birds, signifies in a Metaphor to be carried
or sent with a swift and very speedy dispatch. Isa. 6.6. and 11.14. Dan. 9.21.
Psalm. 91.5. it is elegantly attributed to the Eyes, Prove. 23.5. Will thou cause
thine eyes to fly unto that --, that is, will thou cast thine eye upon it, with
most intent and earnest desire? And to a sword, Ezekiel. 32.10. when I shall cause
my sword to fly (so the Hebrew) that is, when I shall flourish or brandish my
sword. This is spoke of the true God, by an Anthropopathy, when he threatens
Destruction and Death.

To fly, signifies also to vanish and perish, Job 20.8. Prove. 23.5. Hos. 9 11.
To fly upon, the property of rapacious Creatures signifies to rush suddenly
upon a thing, as 1 Samuel 14.32. the people flew upon the spoil, etc.

The Heart.
[ The Heart] of a living Creature, because it is in a manner in the middle of
the breast, and within the body, by a Metaphor is put for the middle of any
thing, and also the inward part; Deuteronomy. 4.11. And the Mountain burnt with fire
unto the heart of heaven, that is the middle of the lower heavens, 2 Samuel
18.14. In the heart of the Oak, i. e. in the middle, etc. See more Examples,
Exodus 15.8. Psalm. 46.2, 3. Prove. 30.19. Ezekiel. 28.2. Jonah 2.4. Jer. 51.1. So
the [ Belly] is put for the middle place of a thing, Belly. Reins.
1 King 7.20. The Reins for grains of wheat as before, Chap. 6.

The Tail.
[ The Tail] the hindermost part of the Creature is put for the extremes of any
thing, Isa. 7.4. the tails of the firebrands, that is the very ends almost
burnt, which can do nothing but smoke, and will be quickly consumed. By which
the two Kings that were Adversaries to the Jews are understood as before.
Sometimes the head and tail are joined together, the first signifying Dominion,
the other Subjection and servitude, Isa. 9.14. The Lord will cut off Head and
Tail, that is, high and low, the courageous and the abject (which by another
Metaphor of Branch and Rush is also there expressed) he adds ver. 15. the
eminent and honorable, he is the head: and the Prophet that teaches lies, he
is the Tail, which phrase renders them most abject and detestable before God.
Col. 110.
Illyricus, The tail is interpreted of seducers, whether because of the extreme
vileness of their life, or because they voided the venomous excrements of
Satan, or because they wagged when they flatter men, so, as dogs fawn with a
motion of their tail. Deuteronomy. 25.18. What we read in our English Version -- he --
smote the hindmost of thee, in the Hebrew is, he smote thy tail, that is, the
rere of the Army. The Chald. And he slew all of thine, who were loytering
behind thee. See Josh. 10.19.

[ The Heel] the extreme part of the foot by a Metaphor signifies, the ends,
bounds, or limits of a thing, Psalm. 119.112. Also the gain, fruit, or reward
which is the end of the work, Psalm. 19.11. etc. To lift up the heel, Psalm.
41.9. is said of a refractory enemy, and a contriver of Mischief, the Metaphor
being taken from the kickings of stubborn and angry horses. See Joh. 13.18.
Deuteronomy 32.15. 1 Samuel 2.29. Of the phrase to kick against the pricks, we will
treat hereafter.

Homogeneal or similary parts.
Here we will add some certain homogeneal or similary parts of an Animal, for
what we have hitherto spoken of, are (according to a Physical Notion or
distinction) heterogeneous, or dissimilary.

A Bone.
[ A Bone] Because it is hard and white has two Metaphorical Notions: And,

1. Denotes hardness and inhumanity of Mind, Prove. 25.15. A soft tongue
breaks the bone; that is, even the most hard-hearted and severe Man, or the
most grievous and rigid anger: So Gideon pacified the Ephramites, Judge. 8.1, 2,
3. and Abigail pacified David, when he intended to Destroy Nabal, 1 Samuel 25.24.
and the following Verses.

2. It denotes white like a Bone, 2 Kin. 9.13. Then they hasted and took every
man his Garment, and put under him (...) upon the bone of the stairs; that is,
a step white as a bone. Others interpret this phrase as Metonymical, imagining
the steps be of Ivory, or some other sort of bone. The Chaldee turns it, upon
the step of hours: understanding (as Schindler thinks) a Dial cut into the
stone, in which were signed degrees, by which the hour of the day may be found
by the Sunshine. R. Kimch. upon the highest step amongst the steps, etc.

[ Marrow] The inward fat of the bones, Marrow.
because it is the sweetest part of the Flesh, communicating vigor to the bones
and all the body, affording it a grateful aliment. By a Metaphor is put for any
good thing, Isa. 5.17. and is mentioned in the description of the heavenly
banquet, Isa. 25.6. Fat is of the same signification, Genesis 45.18. Numb. 18.12,
29, 30, 32. Deuteronomy. 32.14. Psalm. 81.16. and 147.14. in both which la^^ places the
Hebrew Text is, the fat of the wheat.

[ Fat] is put for the goodness and fruitfulness of Land, Gen 27, 28, etc. for
rich and powerful men, Psalm. 22.29. And because fatness and full feeding makes
beasts grow wanton and wild, therefore the term is translated to men, enriched
by God, and so grown rebellious and wicked, Deuteronomy. 32.15. Job 15.27. Psalm.
17.10. and 73.7. etc. See Isa. 6.10. The Fatness of Gods house, denotes plenty
of heavenly blessings, the similitude taken from banquets, see, Isa. 34.6. etc.

[ Blood] is Metaphorically put for that, which for redness is like a bloody
color, Blood.
for which reason it is attributed to Wine, Genesis 49.11. Deuteronomy. 32.14. Eccl.
50.17. Of the place in Ezekiel. 19.10. Thy Mother was as a vine (...)
in thy blood, etc. Illyricus in Clave. Col. 1087. thus says, I believe that
blood is there to be taken for wine, and we have heard before that it is
sometimes so taken. Others understand of native (or Natural) Juice. Some also
understand the beginning or birth: that is when she first brought thee forth,
she was strong and flourished. Junius and Tremellius render it, in thy quiet,
(as derived of (...) siluit, quievit) that is, in former tranquillity. Others,
in thy likeness (from (...) similis fuit, he was like) which the Chaldee also
respects. It is said when the Moon is Eclipsed, that it shall be turned into
blood, Joel 2.31. with 3.15. upon which Schlinder, In Eclipsi rubet luna instar
sanguinis, etc
In an Eclipse, the Moon is red like blood, because its proper light is mixed
with the shadow of the Earth, and causes redness.

[ Flesh] made and Nourished by blood, denotes a frail and weak thing, Flesh.
as that which is frail, and obnoxious to Death and Corruption, Psalm. 56.4. and
78.39. Is^^. 31.3. Jer. 17.3. It is likewise put for that which is mild,
tractable, and obsequious, Ezekiel. 36.26.

[ Milk] for its sweetness and very great use, Milk.
is Metaphorically brought to describe the blessings of the Messiah, Isa. 55.1.
Joel. 3.23. In the New Testament.

1. It denotes the most sweet and sincere word of Christ, 1 Pet. 2.2. The Word
called Milk.
The Word is called Milk and is compared to it in this place.

(1.) Because of its unmixt simplicity and whiteness or candor; for as Milk is
not a liquor composed by humane Art, but made by Nature it self: so the Word of
God owns not men for its Author, or Original, but Jehovah alone, 2 Pet. 1.21.

(2.) Because of its sweetness and pleasantness, of which see Isa. 25.6. Psalm.
19.10, 11. and 119.103. Prove. 24.13, 14.

(3.) Because of its utility in feeding and preserving our souls to eternal
life; 2 Timothy 3.16, 17.

(4.) Because it tends to the destruction of such as abuse it Milk is not
proper to be taken by such as are feverish or Plethorick, because it
exasperates the Disease in a body so ill disposed: So to such as are stubbornly
wicked and unbelieving the Word of God profits nothing, but becomes their
greater Damnation, Joh. 12.48. 2 Cor. 2.16. etc.

2. If it be opposed to solid or strong meat it denotes the first rudiments of
the Christian Religion; 1 Cor. 3.2. Heb. 5.12.13. Of which Beza says thus:
Paulus mentionem facit pueritiae and lactis diverso sensu, etc.
Paul makes mention of Childhood and Milk in a diverse sense: For he opposes
Infancy to an adult age, and therefore by the word milk he signifies the
tyrociny or first entrance into the Christian Religion. But here (that is 1
Pet. 2.2. As new born Babes desire the sincere (or seasonable) milk of the
word, etc. he opposes infancy to the former corrupt life, and Commends the
perpetual use of Milk (that is of the true and sincere Doctrine of the Gospel.)

Of Milk [ Butter] is made Prove. 30.33. whence buttered words are mentioned,
Butter.
Psalm. 55.21. that is smooth and flattering words, etc.

Metaphors taken from some Generalities of living Creatures.
LIving Creatures that are Brutes are distinguished into Terrestrial, Volatile,
and Aquatile. (...) fera.
As to what concerns terrestrial generally, (...) Fera, Bestia, a wild Beast
sometimes signifies, a Convention, meeting or gathering together; which (
Schindler says) is spoken by a Metaphor taken from Beasts gathered together 2 Samuel 23.11. of the Philistines, gathered together in a Troop. By wild Beasts of
the Field, Psalm. 80.13. The unmerciful Enemies of the Church are Metaphorically
denoted. The Hebrew word here signifies a strong and fierce Beast.

The Apostle Paul (citing the Poet Epimenides) calls the Cretans (...), Evil
Beasts. For this verse is found in his works which he entitled De Oraculis, as
Jerome in his Commentary upon the place notes. Paul calls him a Prophet, either
Ironically, or from the Argument of his Writing, or because the Cretans, his
Countrymen, thought him to be so, etc. See Psalm. 49.10. and 73.22. and 92.6.
Prove. 12.1. and 30.2. Psalm. 94.7, 8. Jer. 10.8.14. etc. See also Genesis 16.12.

1 Cor. 15.32. expounded.
The Apostle Paul says 1 Cor. 15.32. that he did ((...)) fight with Beasts at
Ephesus -- his words are, (...), etc. Si secundum hominem adversus Bestias
pugnavi Ephesi, etc. that is, if after the manner of men (or to speak after the
manner of men, or according to man) I have fought with beasts at Ephesus; that
is, as some say, with beastly men. Scaliger in his Notes says, feros and
praefracti ingenii viros, quibuscum illi Negotium and contentio fuit, vocat
(...) Legendum vero (...), etc.
, that is, the men he had to do withal being of a stubborn and of an
unconfutable Mind, he calls them Beasts. And therefore, for (...), as it is in
our Copies, should be read (...) in this sense: If I have fought in Ephesus
against men, as if against Beasts, etc.

And whereas he makes an Express mention of Ephesus, some understand these
words of the Tumult and Uproar there mentioned, Act. 19. -- Others expound it
of the disputes which he had for three Months with the unbelieving and stubborn
Jews at Ephesus, Acts 19.8, 9.

1 Cor. 15.29. When he speaks of the Resurrection of the Dead, and such as Deny
it (yet professing themselves Christians) he argues (in order to confute them)
(...) from their own Topic or Maxim; If the Dead rise not at all? In vain was
the baptism for the Dead, that is, If there be no Resurrection, that Baptism is
idle which is made upon the graves of the Dead for the Confession of that
Article, viz. the Resurrection, etc. In vain are all my sufferings for Christ,
ver. 30, 31. In vain is all our Controversy for the Christian Religion with
the Adversaries of truth (who are like Beasts for fierceness and unrulyness)
ver. 32. with ver. 14, 15. etc. -- Such as understand these words of Paul
properly, that is, as if he had really fought with beasts, may be confuted by
what he recites 2 Cor. 11.23. and the following Verses, where he gives a
Narative of his great sufferings in which enumeration there is no Mention of
this fight with Beasts. And certainly if it had been really so, and that he had
been exposed to such an extraordinary cruel Treatment, more inhuman^^ indeed
than any he relates, he would not forget to reckon it amongst his sufferings.
Now if the Verb (...) (I say) be understood, (an Ellipsis we meet with, 2 Cor.
9.6. Isa. 5.9. Hos. 14.9.) as doubtless it is, the sense must be, as if he had
said, si loquar secundum hominem, that is, if I speak according to (the manner
of) men, viz. when they use similitudes, Gal. 3.15. Romans 6.19. then this speech
must be taken Metaphorically, and so all is well.

A certain mixture of diverse Animals is proposed, Esa. 11.6, 7, 8, 9. and
65.25. By which the calling of the wild and barbarous nations and the gathering
of the Church from diverse sorts of people is denoted, which elegant
metaphorical Hypotyposis, with divine assistance shall under its proper head be
expounded.

[ To Hunt] is almost every where taken in an ill sense, and is put for to
ensnare, contrive or devise mischief, Exodus 21.13. 1 Samuel 24.12. Prove. 6.26.
Jer. 16.6. Lam. 3.52. and 4.18. Ezekiel. 13.18, 20. Micah 7.2. The reason of the
metaphor is evident, for the various devices, traps, instruments and arts are
made use of by Hunters to catch the Beasts they seek for.

He is called a Mighty Hunter, Genesis 10.9 Mighty Hunter. In Clave. Script. Col.
1239
Genesis 10.9. who abuses his power violently to oppress and subdue men, or is a
Tyrant, Illyricus. Venatio habet simile quiddam bello, etc. Hunting has some
resemblance to War, as Xenophon says in his instruction of Cyrus; yea it is a
kind of war: And on the other hand, war is a kind of Hunting of servile and
disobedient men, as Aristotle in his 1 Book of Politics says. Therefore when
Nimrod is said to be a Mighty Hunter, it is to be interpreted a Warrior,
which appears from the Text it self, for it is applied in this place to the
principal Cities of that Kingdom, which may not be properly said of a Hunter,
but of a King or General of an host, who built strong Cities when he subdued
the Countries. The Chaldee plainly renders it, a strong Hero. Aben Ezra takes
it properly of the Hunting of Beasts which Nimrod offered in sacrifices to the
Lord, from the phrase before the Lord. But Mercer notes, that all the Hebrews
esteemed Nimrod as a Tyrant, and that Aben Ezra should be rebuk't for that he
alone would justify an impious man. But more rightly the phrase [ before the
Lord] is to be understood, to denote an aggravation of his Tyranny, because he
did not act obscurely or privately, but openly and in the face of the Sun,
imposing his Government without respect to men, or dread of the all seeing
Divinity. See Genesis 6.11. and 13.13. etc. Lastly it is to be observed that 1 Chronicles. 1.10. Vid. Zelmerum. Centur. 1. Adag. Sacr. 1.
Nimrod is said plainly to be Mighty upon the Earth, which is by any means to
be understood of his Rule over men.

The Term [ Hunting] is attributed to God, when he requites the persecutors of
the Godly, with those punishments they designed or inflicted upon others, Psalm.
140.11. The man of Tongue (that is one that Curses or Blasphemes) shall not be
established in the Earth, he (viz. God) shall hunt him (so the Hebrew) to
precipices or an overthrow, that is, as he hunted the Godly, ver. 5. so God
will, as it were with punishments hunt him, till he rushes or falls headlong
into Everlasting destruction. See ver. 10. and Habak. 2.17.

[ A Snare or to Insnare] are of the same metaphorical signification with
hunting, (...) and (...).
and signify to entrap or destroy, Deuteronomy. 7.16, 25. and 12.13. Psalm. 9.15, 16.
and 124.7. and 140.5. and 38.12. and 91.3. and 141.9. Eccl. 9.12. Matthew. 22.15.

A Snare] is put for loss, or destruction, or the cause or occasion thereof,
Exodus 10.7. 1 Samuel 18.21. Psalm. 69.22. and 18.5. Prove. 12.13. and 13.14. and
22.5. and 29.6. Esa. 24.17. Ezekiel. 48.43. Hos. 5.1. and 9.8. Romans 11.9. 1 Timothy
3.7. and 6.9. 2 Timothy 2.26.

A Net] such as Hunters use, is of the same signification, Psalm. 9.15, 16. and
25.14, 15. and 35.6, 7. and 57.6. and 141.10. Prove. 29.5. Eccl. 7.27. Hos. 5.1.
and 9.8. See Job 19.6. Psalm. 11.5. Jer. 50.24. Ezekiel. 12.13. and 32.3.

Of Metaphors taken from the Kinds of Living Creatures.
THese we shall recite thus.

(1.) Wild or Savage Beasts, that live in Deserts or Woods. (2.) Such as serve
for Man's Use or Feeding. (3.) Serpents, Worms and other Insects.
A [ Lion] The King of Beasts, Prove. 30.30. Sometimes is to be understood in a
good, sometimes in an evil sense, as was mentioned chap. 6. yet more seldom in
a good, Genesis 49.9. Juda is called a Lions Whelp, by which the Holy Patriarch
denotes the strength power and eminency of that Tribe beyond the others, but of
this we have spoke chap. 8. when we expounded the text that calls Christ a Lion.

What we translate [ Altar] Ezekiel. 43.15, 16. in the Hebrew is [ Ariel] that is,
Ariel.
the Lion of God, a compounded word, put for the Altar whereon Sacrifices were
offered, because it always consumed the Oblations as a Lion does his prey. The
City Jerusalem is called by this Name, Esa. 29.1, 2.
Esa. 29.1, 2. Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, (viz. The Lion of God,) upon which
Musculus, Jerusalem is called Ariel, because she became fierce and cruel
against God and his Prophets, whom she had barbarously slain, as a Lion does a
Lamb in the Desert. And fitly applies to this sense what we read, Jer. 12.8. Of
the people of the Jews. In that place he says there is an Allusion, as if he
had said, thou art not (...). the City of God, as thou would fain seem to be;
but (...) the Lion of God, etc. The Chald. well expresses the sense of ver. 2.
And I will straighten the City in which the Altar is, and it shall be desolate
and empty, and it shall be environed with the blood of the slain, as the Altar
is covered and encompassed with the blood of sacrifices upon the Feast day.

Lion.
A Lion] is metaphorically put for fierce outrageous Enemies or Tyrants, Job
4.10. Psalm. 22.21. Psalm. 34.10. Psalm. 57.5. and 58.7. Jer. 4.7. and 5.6. Ezekiel.
19.2. Nah. 2.11, 12. Zeph. 3.3. 2 Timothy 4.17. Hence the Devil is compared to a
Roaring Lion, 1 Pet. 5.8. See Esa. 35.8. and 11.6, 7. Romans 8.38, 39. Roaring
that is, the clamor or cry of Lion, is taken for violence or tumultuous
hostility, Esa. 5.29. Zach. 11.3. For Thunder Job 37.4. For the Groans and
Cries of the sorrowful, Psalm. 22.1, 2. and 38.8, 9.

Unicorn.
An [ Vnicorn] because of its fierceness and strength, is put for wicked and
cruel Enemies, Psalm. 22.21. Esa. 34.7. But in an express comparison it is
otherwise taken sometimes.

A Boar.
A [ Boar] Signifies also the fierce Enemies of Gods People, Psalm. 80.13.

A Bear.
A [ Bear] which is a cruel Creature denotes a cruel and merciless Tyrant, Prove.
28.15. Also God when he executes heavy vengeance, Lam. 3.10. But in both places
it is rather an express comparison there being an Ellipsis of the comparative
particle ( as) which is to be understood, and so it is rendered in our English
Bibles.

Wolf.
A [ Wolf] which is a strong, cruel and ravenous Beast, denotes powerful, fierce
and covetous men, Genesis 49.27. The Tribe of Benjamin is called a ravening Wolf,
because strong and fierce, and is so described, Judges 20. etc. See Jer. 5.6.
Zeph. 3.3. Ezekiel. 22.27.

In the New Testament by Wolves are understood Seducers, and Authors of wicked
Doctrines, Historia. Animal. p. 216. cap. 20.
Matthew. 7.15. John 10.12. Act. 20.29. Franzius, in his History of Beasts, says,
that John 10.12. by Wolf, is meant the Devil. Because,

(1.) As a Wolf is apt and willing to execute mischief against Man and Beast;
so the Devil is the common Enemy of mankind.

(2) As the Wolf is greedy and unsatiable; so the cruelty and rapacity of the
Devil is not to be satisfied.

(3.) As the Wolf is so sharp sighted, that he can see even in the darkest
night, and when hungry, smell his Prey at the distance of half a German mile,
(that is, an English mile and half;) so the Devil by long experience and use is
become still more wicked and cruel; and well versed in the scent of his prey,
that is, of such as are apt to be tempted to sin.

(4.) As Wolves sometimes devour whole Sheep, sometimes only the Flesh; so the
Devil sometimes hurts the corporal faculties, sometimes destroys Life, and
sometimes (when God permits) health; and sometimes hurryes the wicked soul and
body to destruction.

(5.) As the Wolf is most crafty; so the Devil wholly consists of deceit. The
Wolf invades the flock in a dark or cloudy time, the better to make his
approaches undiscovered: So the Devil sets upon men commonly in times of
Calamity and Affliction, that by the advantage of their troubles, he may the
better exercise his tempting power. The Wolf uses baits and stratagems to
allure a Herd to come within the danger of his Fellows, enticing Goats, with
green boughs, and playing with young Pigs, casting them with his Tail, making
them run along, till he seduces them to the Ambush; so the Devil presents false
pleasures to bewitch the senses of men, till they fall headlong into his snare.
The Wolf uses much Policy when he sets upon Bulls and Horned Beasts, and
assaults them behind, where they are unprovided for defense; so the Devil has
peculiar slights and devices to entrap the strongest and more experienced
Christians, seeming to retreat when he cannot prevail, but quickly returning
(when he thinks they are secure) with a new stratagem to undo them. (6.) It is
said of a Wolf that if he first sees a man, the man loses his voice and cannot
cry out: So the Devil when he has set upon an unwary man that feared no danger,
and resisted not, makes an easy conquest and triumph.

(7.) But if a man sees a Wolf first, the Beast loses both voice and courage:
So Godly Men, who fear devilish Temptations, and prepare themselves for
resistance, can easily by Prayer and Divine cries put that malignant Enemy to
flight.

(8.) The Wolf mightily dreads Fire and -- Swords: So the Devil fears the light
of Gods word and Prayer, etc. which are the Churches weapons. Hence Chrysostom
said, that Swords are not so terrible to Wolves, as the prayers of the godly
are to the Devil.

Seducers and False Teachers are called Wolves, Act. 20.29. I know that after
my departure shall grievous (or Ravenous) Wolves enter in among you, where we
are to note the Epithet, for it is not said Wolves, but ravenous Wolves; (...),
for there are some more rapacious than others. Oppianus and other learned men
say that there are a certain kind of Wolves, which are called (...), Snatchers
or Ravening Wolves* These are the swiftest sort, and go out very early to prey,
and invade with a terrible onset, they are very unsatiable and craving, and
inhabit Mountains, yet of such impudence that in the Winter they come to the
very Cities, and behave themselves quietly till an opportunity of seizing upon
a Lamb, young Goat or other prey offers, which they carry away, to which the
Patriarch seems to allude, Genesis 49.27.

1. As Wolves are said to take away a man's voice: So false Teachers take away
the purity of the heavenly Doctrine and Worship of God.

2. The Wolf is so cruel and devouring, that he kills not only what would serve
his Belly, but the whole Flock, if let alone: So Heretics aim not at the
destruction of one or two, but the whole Church.

3. As the Wolf is most crafty, and silently approaches the Sheepfold to know
whether the Dogs be asleep, or the Shepherd wanting, or whether they are
careless and negligent, and so watches a fit occasion to destroy the flock, and
suck their blood: So Heretics before they propose their manifest and apparent
errors, slily insinuate themselves into the good opinion of men, and with
wretched hypocrisy and sophistry counterfeit much piety, humility and
Angelical sanctimony, boasting of peculiar Illuminations and Communion with
God; thus when they have purchased a good repute they instill their venom into
the minds of their unwary Proselytes, till they wholly corrupt them.

4. It is said that even after death there remains a natural Antipathy between
a Wolf and a Sheep, insomuch that if the skin of each be made into a Drum,
Hist. Animal. page 213.
(as a Learned Naturalist observes) the very sound of the Wolves skin breaks
the other, and that if their Guts be made into Vyol (or Lute) Strings it is
impossible to tune them to Unisons or one sound: So the perverse Doctrine of
Heretics does mischief in the Church, even when the Heretics themselves are
dead.

5. As the Wolf at the approach of peril betakes himself to flight privately;
So Heretics skulk in time of persecution, and withdraw most cowardly.

6. By the Attick Laws (and so in Ireland at this day) Wolf killers were
considerably rewarded; So they deserve praise and encouragement that detect the
fraud, sophistry, and impiety of those Wolves, that would destroy the Flock of
Christ. The Wolf disappointed of his prey walks about with an open or gaping
mouth; so Heretics thirst for the blood of the Orthodox. And as the Cubs or
Whelps of Wolves are killed, although they have yet committed no mischief; so
the fry and disciples of wicked Heretics ought to be bridled, and care taken
to prevent, that they invenome not the Church, so far Franzius.

A [ Leopard] is a fierce and swift Creature, Leopard.
and carries the notion of Cruelty and Enmity in the Scripture, Jer. 5.6.

That a [ Fox] denotes Heretics, and the Churches Enemies, Fox.
Cant. 2.15. Lam 5.18. is the judgment of Interpreters. As Franzius Hist.
Animal. p. 191. etc. That Christ called Herod a Fox is evident from Luke 13.32.
by reason of his Treacherous Plots, which he privately contrived to entrap him.
Erasmus in his Paraphrase -- Go and tell that Fox, who confides in humane
craft, and Believes he can do anything against the Majesty and Counsel of God,
etc. This was the Fox that would betray that Hen we read of Matthew. 23.37. which
is produced by way of excellent Similitude to denote the most gracious care and
loving kindness of God to his Church, etc.

A Hind is commonly taken in a Good sense, Genesis 49.21. Naphtali is a Hind let
loose, that is, which flies most swiftly. This is expounded of a ready
promptitude and Activity in the happy dispatch and Management of affairs. The
Hebrews refer this to Barak the Naphtalite, who made a very speedy levy of
10000 men of the Tribe of Zebulun and Naphtali, and together with Deborah
pursued Sisera their Enemy, Judge. 4.10. It is added in that Text, (Genesis 49.21.)
he gives goodly words, which they refer to the same History, and that sweet
Song of Barak and Deborah mentioned Judge. 5.

Prove. 5.19. A good Wife is called a Hind of loves, and a pleasant Roe, so the
Hebrew, that is a Hind Beloved: because men take a singular Delight in wild
Beasts, that are made Tame and Sociable, etc.

The second kind of Animals A Horse, etc.
A [ Horse] and his Neighing Metaphorically denotes unbridled lust, Jer. 5.8.
See Ezekiel. 23.20.

[ To Ride] signifies to Rule, or to be in an eminent Condition, Deuteronomy. 32.13.
Psalm. 66.12. Isa. 58.14. Where it is ascribed to God, is already shown.

[ A Bridle, or to Bridle] which properly belongs to Horses, Jam. 3.5. by which
they are restrained and guided, Psalm. 32.8, 9. Metaphorically denotes the
curbing and averting the violence of Enemies --, sometimes when attributed to
the Tongue, it denotes a Prudent and becoming Moderation, Jam. 3.2. and 1.26.
See Job 30.11. 2 Samuel 8.1. Psalm. 66.11, 12.

[ An Ass] besides the place cited, viz. Ezekiel. 23.20. is found in a Metaphor,
Genesis 49.14. Where the tribe of Issachar is called the ass of a Bone, that is of
big bones, and so strong, that though dull by Nature, it shakes not off, but
bears what burdens are laid upon it; hence it is subjoined, Couching down
between two burdens, for they were wont to Divide its load, and place it in two
bundles on either side, the Explication follows, ver. 15. See Judge. 5.16.

[ A Bull] denotes a violent, cruel, and proud Enemy, that abuses and infests
the miserable, Psalm. 22.12. Psalm. 68.30. Isa. 34.7. By the name of Kine, the
Grandees of the Kingdom are expressed, Amos 4.1. about which see Chap. 10.
where we have treated of the hill Bashan.

Isa. 15.5. An Heifer of three years old seems to be a Metaphorical Epithet of
the City Zoar belonging to the Moabites; the same we read, Jer. 48.34. and that
it was near the City Horanaim. Upon which Texts some Expositors say, that it
denotes the Pride, Luxury and Wantonness of the Moabites, because when a Cow
comes to be of that age, it begins to grow fierce and wanton. Others understand
it, of plenty of Pastures and other conveniences, with which that Land
abounded, as a Heifer or Cow of three years old, gives store of Milk. Hierome
in his Comment. on Isaiah says, that we are to understand the Heifer of three
year old, of perfect and full age. For as the thirtieth year compleats a man's
strength, so the third year does the the like in those Beasts.

Lyranus says, that it is so called because of its luxurious petulancy, and that
the feminine gender is used, to denote their filthy Sodomy, which is a far
fetched exposition. Junius and Tremelius expound it of the Bawling Moabites,
(who are so called by an emphatical Prosopopaeia) when they labored to confirm
their flying and despairing Friends. For as a Heifer unaccustomed to the Yoke,
is therefore more impatient, and complains with louder and stronger bellowing
at that Age; so they, impatient of servitude, cry aloud, etc.

Jer. 46.20. Egypt is called a very fair (or beautiful) Heifer, but destruction
comes out of the north to it. Here is a comparison of its present felicity (by
a Metaphor taken from a fatten'd and plump Heifer) with its future Disgrace and
Ruin.

Hos. 10.11. Ephraim, or the People of Israel is called an Heifer taught or
accustomed, loving to tread out the Corn. Which Metaphor, Brentius thus
Expounds, this labor of treading out Corn was easy aad pleasing to the
heifers, for they were not bound, nor yoked, nor burdened, but had a full
freedom of dancing about, and had food enough, according to Deuteronomy. 25.4. So is
Israel hitherto unaccustomed to Banishments, depredations; and utter
Devastations, but dwelling in their own Kingdom under their own Vine and
Fig Tree, enjoying what they possessed in peace, etc.

[ A Yoke] that Instrument whereby Oxen are tied, to draw a Plough, Cart or
Coach, etc. Luke 14.19 is used Metaphorically; as,

1. It denotes Doctrine and Institution, for as Oxen are thereby tied up and
appointed to some certain kind of labor, to which in time they become
accustomed, so Christians are obliged to the practice of Divine Precepts, Jer.
5.5. But these have altogether broken the Yoke, and burst the bonds (wherewith
the Yoke was tied) the Chald. renders it, but these have altogether rebelled
against the Law, these have Departed from the Doctrine. See Psalm. 2.3. Matthew.
11 29. Take my Yoke upon you, ver. 30. For my yoke is easy and my Burden is
light. That the Evangelical Doctrine of Christ our Savior is to be understood,
is evident by the explication added, learn of me for I am meek and lowly in
heart, and ye shall find Rest for your souls. Now because the Gospel is the
Doctrine or Word of the Cross, 1 Cor. 1.18. Therefore is this Metaphorical
phrase used by Christ. That there are three things comprehended here, is plain
from the Words.

(1.) Faith in Christ, begot by the word of the Gospel.

(2.) A Pious Life, conformable to the life of Christ in humility, meekness and
other fruits of the Spirit.

(3.) Patience and Constancy in bearing his Cross. And where these are
exercised the party shall find rest for his Soul. Hence the Devil is called
Belial abs^^ue f^^go Hier. (...) ex Beli, id est Non. and hol id est Jugum. the
Septuagint commonly translate it (...), altogether irregular. Deuteronomy. 13.13. etc.
Belial, which signifies without Yoke, because that Apostate Spirit cast of his
allegiance to the Laws of God.

2. It Denotes Trouble, Anguish, and Affliction, but especially the oppression
of Cruel Masters, Magistrates, or Tyrants, as Oxen Yok't, are heavy laden, and
compelled by flashing and pricking to draw through the most difficult ways by
their hard-hearted Owners, Lev. 26.13. 1 Kin. 12.4. Isa. 9.4. and 10.27. and
14.25. and 47.6. Jer. 2.20. and 28.2, 4, 11, 14. and 30.8. Lam. 1.14. and 3.27.
1 Timothy 6.1. etc.

It is put for a heavy and troublesome burden in spirituals, Act. 15:10. Gal.
5.1. etc.

3. It denotes Conjunction and Conformity with others, as the Oxen joined
together by the Yoke, draw the burden with the greater ease, because of their
mutual aid to each other, 2 Cor. 6.14. Be ye not unequally Yok't with
unbelievers, by which, Idolatry, or any kind of Impiety is understood. The word
(...) is Emphatical, and signifies to bear a strange Yoke, which believers,
are, of all men, most obliged to keep the remotest distance from.

The term (...) Phil. 4.3. which is well translated Yoke Fellow, Masculini and
feminini generis est, significat Conjugatum. Zan.
is diversely interpreted by the learned; Clemens Alexandrinus understood it of
Paul's Wife, and many follow him, as Erasmus, Musculus, Illyricus, and others:
But Cajetan, Calvin, Beza, and Piscator turn it socie, that is, Companion, etc.
the Phrase is certainly Metaphorical, whether it be understood of Paul's Wife,
or any assistant Preacher. The Syriack uses a Masculine word (...) fili jugi
mei, son of my Yoke; by which it appears that they understood it of some man
that was Paul's Colleague.

[ A Dog] Because he is Ravenous and given to Biting, A Dog.
Metaphorically denotes a violent and bitter spiteful Enemy, Psalm. 22.1^^.20.
and because reputed a base Creature among men, it is used as a term of
disgrace, or vilifying, 2 Kin. 8.13. so a Dead Dog, 1 Samuel 24.15. 2 Samuel 9.8.
and 16.9. And the head of a Dog, 2 Samuel 3.8. Impudent Whoremongers or
Sodomites, are called so, Deuteronomy. 23.17, 18 Though some understood this phrase
properly, yet by the 17. verse it seems to be meant of Sodomites.

It denotes wicked men who are stubbornly ungrateful and obstinate, Matthew 7.6.
where Dogs and Swine are joined (as likewise in the Proverb, Mat. ^^. Dogs and
Swine.
2 Pet. 2.22.) which Metaphors Emphatically set forth the qualities, and acts
of the Sons of this World, that are strangers to the Kingdom of God.

1. Like Ravenous Currs, they bark at the heavenly Doctrine, and its faithful
Ministers, whom they reproach with impudent scandals, and whose utter
extirpation they study.

2. Like Swine Theophilact.
(...) vitam impuram agunt, they lead a filthy life, wallowing in beastly
pleasures, as Hogs do in Mire. Christ therefore gives warning to his people,
that they should take special care that the Mysteries of his blessed Sacraments
should not be communicated to, or polluted by, such blasphemers, persecutors,
and Epicurean Hogs. But what the conclusion and reward of such Dogs and Swine
will be, appears, Rev. 22.15. etc.

Esa. 56.10. They are all dumb Dogs they cannot bark, this is a description of
false Teachers, who, when they ought to speak with respect to matter and time,
were silent, and forsak't their office. On the other hand, ver. 11. it is said
that they are greedy Dogs which can never be satisfied, which denotes their
unsatiable covetousness.

Phil. 3.2. False Apostles, and False Prophets are called Dogs because they
have qualities like Dogs, as Impudence, Calumny, or currish biting, and
voracity or covetousness. There are three kinds of Dogs.

1. Such as are chained up and bark at every Passenger if unknown to them, bite
the stones thrown at them, and yet are pacified by a bit of Bread: So Heretics
that are the Slaves or Captives of Satan, bark to have the Scriptures theirs,
though the sense be unknown to them, and quarrel with Scripture objections made
against them, and as it were bite it, by their false interpretations, but yet
are satisfied by the fat Morsels of Benefices, etc.

2. Hunting Dogs, who pursue and seize upon Beasts: So the Heretics persecute
the Orthodox.

3. Ravening or preying Dogs, whom pertinacious Arch-Hereticks imitate.

Sheep.
A [ Sheep] is frequently used in a Metaphor, as well as an Allegory and express
similitude. And because tne explication of this metaphorical speech is obvious
every where, we shall dispatch what we have to say here about it briefly.

The Faithful and godly are called Sheep, and the Church, the Flock, Psalm. 78.
and 100.3. Esa. 5.17. Ezekiel. 36.38. John 10.15, 16, 26, 27. and 21.15, 16, 17.
Act. 20.28. Heb. 13.20. 1 Pet. 5.2. To this belongs entire Allegories and
Parables, taken from the state and keeping of Sheep, Psalm. 23. Ezekiel. 34. John
10.

Sometimes by way of opposition, as Sheep signify Beleivers, because of their
simplicity, patience, purity, obedience, fruitfulness and profit, Ezekiel. 34.16,
17. Matthew. 25.32, 33. So Goats or Rams signify Unbelievers in the texts last
cited, because of their petulancy or boldness.

Goats.
[ Goats or Rams] signify the Captains or Governors of the People, Esa. 14.9.
Zach. 10.3. See Jer. 50.8.

To Feed
To Feed] pascere, which Term is properly spoken of flocks of Sheep, is
frequently translated to men, and signifies to Rule and Govern, if applied to
Magistrates: But if spoken of Ministers, it denotes to teach, and govern
according to the Rule of Gods Word. Examples of the former may be read, Genesis
49.24. 2 Samuel 5.2. 1 Chronicles. 11.2. Psalm. 78.71. Esa. 44.28. Jer. 12.10. and
23.1, 2, 4. and 50.6. Zach. 10.3. and 11.3, 8. Rev. 2.27. and 19.15. Of the
latter Jer. 17.16. and 3.15. John 21.15, 16. Act. 20.28. Ephesians. 4.11. 1 Pet. 5.2,
3. etc. See Prove. 10.21. and 13.20. and 29.3. and 22.24.

The third Class of Animals.
[ A Serpent] is brought Genesis 3.15. to denote the Devil, because (lurking in a
natural Serpent,) he seduced man, and the Head of the Serpent denotes the chief
power, Rule, Tyranny, and Virulence of Devils. The same appellation, as also
that of a Dragon, we meet with Rev. 12.7, 9. and 20.2. Hence the wicked are
called the generation of Vipers, Matthew. 3.7. and 12.34. and 23.33. Luke 3 7 See
John 8.44. 1 John 3.8. The Eggs of an Asp, Adder, or Cockatrice, out of which
that venomous Creatures is produced, are metaphorical^^y put to signify the
malice and perverseness of their minds, Esa. 59.5. The poison of Asps, denotes
filthy, naughty speeches, calumnies and blaspemies, Psalm. 140.3. Romans 3.13.
Jer. 8.17. Serpents, biting Cockatrices, signify the Chaldeans, the cruel and
implacable Enemies of the Jews, Job ^^0.14, 16. the Gall, Head, and Tongue of
Asps, is put for a very mischievous and deadly thing: So the Asp and the
Basilisk, are put for extreme perils. In two other places a Serpent has a
different signification from these, as Genesis 49.17. The appellation and action
of a Serpent is attributed to the Tribe of Dan, because of a certain likeness:
For as a Serpent hurts men by craft and treachery; the Danites made use of
subtlety and Stratagems as the sacred Histories testify, as when they went to
surprise Laish Judges 18. And Sampson by stratagem, not by open War destroyed
so many of the Philistines, Judges 14. etc. The Papists wrest this text to
denote Antichrist which they say is to be of the Tribe of Dan, and is the
Serpent here meant; but that conceit is grounded upon some obsolete figments of
Jewish Traditions, and upon no Scripture Foundation, etc.

By the Root of the Serpent, Esa. 14.29. The Progeny of King Vzziah is
understood, who grievously afflicted the Philistines, 2 Chronicles. 26.6. And by the
Viper King Hezekiah, who yet afflicted them more, and almost involved them in
incurable mischiefs, 2 Kings 18.8. Betwixt these two Ahaz, Reigned, by reason
of whose sloth ( God punishing his impiety) the Philistines became insolent,
harassing and wasting Judea without control, 2 Chronicles. 28.28. But the Prophet
here denounces that they shall be no longer suffered to rage at that rate, but
that they shall be destroyed, etc.

[ Scorpions] denote most malignant and perverse men, Ezekiel. 2.6. Scorpions.
Spide^^. Moles.
Also most grievous and intolerable strokes, 1 King. 12.11, 14. 2 Chronicles.
11.11.14. Spiders Webs,] denote the vanity of wicked designs, Job 8.14. Esa.
59.5, 6. Moles] to which Bats] are joined, Esa. 2.20. denote such as are
spiritually blind and ignorant of God; because Moles live obscurely under
ground; and Bats in dark nights fly about; as if he had said, when they are
converted to Christ, they will leave their Idols which they worshipped, to such
as are obstinately blind and unbeleiving; but they themselves shall serve God
being divinely illuminated.

[ A Worm] denotes a thing Vile and contemptible, Psalm. 22.6. Esa. 41.14.
Sometimes perpetual affliction, Esa. 66.24. Mark 9.44, 46, 48. Because it is
always gnawing and consuming the Wood, or living Creature wherein it is, A
[Flea] denotes extraordinary vilifying, extenuation of worth, 1 Samuel 24.14. and
26.20.

Hitherto we have treated of Terestrial Creatures: Vol^^^le Creatures.
Now of Volatile or flying Creatures, and Aquatile, that is, such as live in
waters, we will give what Metaphors are met with, which are but few. Of the
wings and flight of Birds we have spoke before. Eccl. 10.20. Fame or Report
(because of its swiftness) is expressed by the Metaphor of a Bird, Curse not
the King, no not in thy Conscience, and Curse not the Rich in thy Bed Chamber:
For a Bird of the Air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall
tell the matter: That is, because Fame is an Evil, than which nothing is more
swift, and shall with great speed, like a flying Bird convey thy words to the
hearing of such as will create you danger. Some refer this to a Hyperbole, that
the sense may be, that Princes and great men are full of Ears, so that there is
scarce any thing done or said, but they have notice of it by their spies and
observers. Hence came the Greek Proverb, (...): The King has many Eyes, and
many Ears.

Of the warlike Host of the King of Assyria, it is said, Esa. 8.8. That the
stretching out of his wings shall be the breadth of thy Land O Immanuel: Upon
which Musculus in his Comment. h. l. says, That by this Metaphor of a great
Bird, the multitude of his Host is denoted, which is of so vast a body, and of
such large and spreading wings, that nothing in the whole Land can escape his
depredations, etc. The Lord says, Esa. 46.11. That he will call a (...) Rapa^^
vol^^cer.
Ravenous Bird from the East, that is, Cyrus, a Leader of a notable Expedition,
who subdues all difficulties, as if he had wings to fly over them. The Epithet
( Ravenous) denotes his cruelty which he exercised in the destruction of
Babylon, as wings signify the swiftness of the execution.

Jer. 12.9. My possession is to me as a talloned Bird, (or a Bird with Claws or
Tallons.) In the former verse, he compared that stubborn people to a Lion; See
Pliny Not Hist. lib. 11. c. 47.
and here to a rapacious Fowl, which invades his prey with Tallons, as if they
were fingers -- He proceeds in the Metaphor, the Birds round about her, are
against her; come ye assemble all the Beasts of the Field, come to devour; this
is a challenge to the Chaldeans and other Gentiles, to come against the Jews,
etc.

[ The Chattering of Birds] is put for the Groans of men in sickness, Esa.
38.14. Where some Species of Birds as a Crane, a Swallow, and a Dove are
mentioned. Also in the Hebrew Text, Esa. 8.19. Of VVizards or such as have
familiar Spirits, upon which place the paraphrase of Junius and Tremellius is
excellent: Non sunt i^^i seductores tanta facultate praediti, etc.
Those Seducers are not endued with such a faculty, as to show openly and with
a clear voice, or expound in plain terms, what should be said, as we the
Prophets relate the Judgments of God in an intelligible and most evident
phrase: But they speak in their Throat and keep a piping as Chickens hardly
hatched, or if they utter any thing with an audible, they do so mutter as the
Sybil out of her tripod: Which self same reason the Prophet explains chap. 29.
ver. 4. And Historians almost every where.

Musculus upon the place says, Ecquid aliud vocandi sunt, qui inter Missandum
sic Mussitant, etc. What shall we otherwise call them who mutter and murmur at
that rate when they are a Massing, as if they designed of set purpose to
conceal their words from such as are present, and attribute a certain hidden
virtue to that Mussitation (or muttering) by which the substance of Bread and
Wine are converted into the Flesh and Blood of Christ: That Species of
muttering and antic gesture bespeaks not an Apostolical and Christian Spirit,
but rather that which consists of Magic and Legerdemain, etc.

[ A Nest] the habitation of a Bird is put for Rooms or Chambers, Genesis 6.14.
Nests shall thou make in the Ark, (so the Hebrew) that is, separate lodgings
for the respective kinds of Creatures in Noah's Ark. Sometimes it is put for the
Dwellings of men, especially such as are built in High Places, as Ravenous
Birds build their Nests, in steep and craggy Rocks, Job 29.18. Numb. 24.21.
Jer. 22.23. and 49.16. Obad: ver. 4. Habak. 2.9. See Job 29.38.

Turtle-Dove.
Of the kinds of Volatiles, The Turtle Dove denotes the People of Israel, or the
Church, Psalm. 74.19. O deliver not the Soul of thy Turtle Dove unto the
multitude (of which he spoke ver. 18.) that is, thy Church and People, who
worship none but but thee, as a Turtle Dove, that never entertains Conjunction
with another and who in their affliction, like a Turtle Dove, ( Esa. 38.14.)
express their grief in solitary groans, and sighs to thee: And which is
unarmed, weak, simple, and meek like a Dove, yea like a Turtle Dove, which is
esteemed the least among the Species of Doves as lib. 5. de Hist. Animal. cap.
13.
Aristotle says. The Chaldee renders it, the Soul of such as learn thy Law,
(that word (...) a Turtle Dove, being of some affinity with (...) Law) Christ
calls his Church a Dove, Cant. 2.14. and 5.2. and 6.8. And its Eyes, the Eyes
of Doves, Cant. 1.15. and 4.1. By which Metaphor its simplicity (as Matthew.
10.6.) its Chastity, Brightness, and its view and desire of heavenly things are
denoted, etc.

Among Insects, Hornets denote terrors sent from God among men, by which the
Enemies of the People of God shall be as it were stung and rooted out, Exodus
23.28. compared with ver. 27. Deuteronomy. 7.20. Josh. 24.12. -- The Enemies of the
people of Israel are called Flies and Bees, Esa. 7.18. because of their
multitude, and swiftness or nimbleness as the Flies, and the (...), or power of
hurting as in Bees. The word Flies is attributed to the Egyptians, and Bees to
the Assyrians, which Metaphor Jerome in his Commentary Elegantly expounds thus;
He calls the Egyptians Flies, because of their filthy Idolatry (See Eccl.
10.1.) and because they were a weak people: But the Assyrians he calls a Be,
because they had at that time a powerful Kingdom, and were very warlike, (as
Bees represent (as it were,) a very well ordered Monarchy, and are very
resolute to annoy their Enemies;) Or because all the Persians and Assyrians
went armed with Darts, whose points were like the stings of Bees: The Metaphor
is continued, ver. 19. And they shall come and rest all of them in the desolate
Valleys, and in the holes of the Rocks, and upon all Thorns, and upon all
Bushes. Because he once named these Enemies Flies and Bees, he keeps to the
same Metaphor in the rest, as if all places were to be filled with those
Insects. Of the fulfilling of this Prophecy thus writes Jerome in the same
place -- Let us read the Books of the Kings and the Chronicles, and we will
find that the Good King Josiah was slain by the Egyptians, and the Israelites
subdued to an Egyptian yoke, so that they appointed them a King. And not long
after comes Nebuchodonosor, with an innumerable multitude of Soldiers, took
Jerusalem, destroyed the other Cities of Judaea, burnt the Temple, and planted
Assyrian Inhabitants in the Land, 2 King. 23. and 24. 2 Chronicles. 25 and 36. etc.
The Sting] of an Insect metaphorically denotes the power of Death, 1 Cor.
15.55, 56. Brentius upon the place says, As a Be that has lost her sting may
threaten to sting, yet cannot, so when sin is pardoned, which is the sting of
Death, Death may terrify, but cannot hurt us.

Aquatiles follow. By the metaphor of Fishing] a falling into the hands of
Enemies, and Captivity is understood. Amos 4.2. He (that is, the Enemy) will
take you away with hooks, and your posterity with Fish-hooks; as if he had
said, you indeed are like fat Kine, ver. 1. But ye shall be dragged by the
Enemy, as if you had been little Fishes in spite of your pride and fatness --
the same metaphor we find, Habbak. 1.15, 16, 17.

By [ Fishers] Jer. 16.16. are understood the Egyptians, Esa. 19, 8, 9, 10. See
2 Kings 23.29. By Hunters the Chaldeans and Babylonians, so called from Nimrod
the Builder of Babylon, Genesis 10.9. which Prophecy is fulfilled, 2 Kings 24.
and 25.

Besides this Translation of the Terms Fisher and Fishing. The Apostles are
called Fishers of men, Mark. 4.19. and 1.17. Luke 5.10. the explication is
given elsewhere. See Ezekiel. 47.10.

Of the kinds of Aquatiles (...) ( Thannin) a huge serpent and the Leviathan,
Thannin. Formam quandam Draconis and serpentis refert.
that is a great Dragon or Whale is used metaphorically, Psalm. 74.13. thou
did break the Sea by thy strength, thou breakest the head of Whales in the
Waters, ver. 14. Thou breakest the heads of the Leviathan in pieces. By Whales
(or Crocodiles as Ezekiel. 29.3.) The Grandees and Captains of Pharaoh are
understood; who persecuted the people of Israel, Exodus 15.4. By the Leviathan,
Pharaoh himself, who with his entire Host was swallowed up in the Red Sea. But
that which follows, thou shall give it to be meat to the people inhabiting the
Wilderness, is not to be referred to the words immediately going before, but
is a sentence by it self, and is to be understood of the Manna and Quails,
which the people fed upon. See Esa. 51.9. and 27.1.

CHAP. XII. Of Metaphors taken from Man and what belongs to Him.
IN Man we are to Consider, what are (1.) Essential. (2.) What are Accidental.


The Essentials are his Body with its members: and its Union with the Soul
which is Life.

The Accidentals are partly, Internal, as some differences betwixt Men, and
their Actions of diverse kinds: Partly External, as the containing Subjects and
various Adjuncts.

Of which in Order.

Metaphors from a Humane Body and its Members.
The Church Christ's Mystical Body.
THE Body (...) (Soma) is frequently put in the New Testament, for the People of
God or the Church, Romans 12.5. 1 Cor. 10.17. and 12.13, 27. Ephesians. 1.23. -- 2.16.
-- 4.4, 12, 16. -- 5.23. Col. 1.8, 24. -- 2.19. -- 3.15. The Explication of
which Trope is easy. And to speak concisely, we shall show it.

1. With respect to Christ the Head of the Church, and whose Body the Church is
called.

(1.) As the Head is not at a distance from a living body, but most closely
joined to it: so there is a sacred and most Mystical Union betwixt Christ and
his Church, or Believers.

(2.) As the Head Rules the whole body, and influences it with a vital power:
So Christ wisely directs, and moderates, strongly preserves, quickens, by
Counsel instructs, and eternally saves his Church, Ephesians. 1.23. and 2.16. and
4.16. and 5.23. etc.

2. With respect to true Christians who are spiritual Members of that Body.

Of these the Metaphor of a Body signifies many things, chiefly these three.

(1.) The various Gifts and Offices of Christians, especially the Preachers of
the Gospel. For,

1. As one Body has diverse Members, which have their particular and distinct
Offices: So there are peculiar Gifts and Offices in the Church, which
particular persons fitted for their exercise, are chosen for.

2. As the Members of a Humane body differ among themselves with respect to
exexcellency and operation; yet those of an inferior office, do not envy the
superior, neither does the superior despise the inferior: So among true
Christians there is a Society and Conversation without envy in the lowest, or
scorn in the highest Rank, to each other; Romans 12.4, 5. 1 Cor. 12.12. etc.

(2.) Of the bond of perfection, which is Love with its Fruits and Virtues. The
Members of a humane body have a natural instinct of love and sympathy, one to
another, if one be in pain, the rest are unquiet and ill at ease: If one be
well, the rest rejoice, and each contributes to supply the necessity of the
other of its own accord, neither will one willingly part with the other: So
true Believers sincerely love each other, and by tender, sympathizing,
compassionate, fellow feeling love, and mutual aid of each other, declare
themselves to be living Members of the Mystical body of Christ, Romans 12.5. 1
Cor. 12.21. Ephesians. 4.3, 4, 16.

3. With respect to the spiritual knowledge of Faith and increase of Godliness,
from the similitude of a humane body, which increases and grows greater and
stronger, etc. Ephesians. 4.13. Col. 2.19.

Head.
[ The Head] of a man is his Chief, Supreme and Principal Member, and therefore
carries a threefold Metaphorical Notion.

1. The Beginning or Original of any thing, Genesis 2.10. Exodus 12.2. Deuteronomy. 20.9.
Isa. 41.4. and 51.20. Ezekiel. 10.11. and 40.1. etc.

2. Superiority and Eminency, as well with respect to Quantity or Place; as
Quality and Rule. (...) Caput, a Head, the very top or highest part of a thing,
Genesis 28.12, 18. (where what we translate [ top of Jacobs Ladder] in the Hebrew
is Head) Genesis 47.31. Exodus 34.2. 2 Samuel 15.32. and 16.1. 2 Kin. 1.9. Psalm.
24.7, 9. and 72.16. Isa. 2.2. Amos 1.2. -- The Head-stone Zach. 4.7. is the
highest in a Building, which finishes the Work.

It denotes Superiority of Government, as a Prince or (Chief Ruler, Number. 14.4.
and 36.1. Deuteronomy. 1.13, 15. and 28.44. Judge, 10.18. and 11.8. 2 Samuel 22.44. and
23.13. 2 Chronicles. 31.10. Job 12.24. Psalm. 18.43. and 110.6. Jer. 52.24. Lam. 1.5.
Ephesians. 3.23. 1 Cor. 11.3. etc.

The Head of the Corner] denotes the extreme Cornerstone, which by another
Metaphor is attributed to Christ, Psalm. 118.22. Matthew. 41.42. Luke 20.17. Act.
4.11. 1 Pet. 2.7.

3. The most chief or desirable in any thing, Exodus 30.23. the Head spices,
that is, the best. See Cant. 4.14. Ezekiel. 27.22. Deuteronomy. 33.15. Psalm. 141.5. (
Head Oil, that is, Excellent Oil) Psalm. 119.160. Isa. 7.8, 9. The Head of Syria
is Damascus, -- the Head of Ephraim is Samaria, that is, the Principal or
Metropolitan City. Head is put for the Chief or Principal place, 1 Samuel 9.22. 1
Kin. 21.9. It is put for the sum or contents of any thing, Exodus 30.12. Number.
1.2, 49. and 4.2, 22. and 31.25. Psalm. 139.17. See Lev. 6.5. Hence comes the
word (...), to reduce into one sum, which is Elegantly spoke of the precepts of
the Divine Law of the second Table, the sum or whole Contents of which is
Charity or Love, as the Apostle has it Romans 13.9. See Acts 22.28. Heb. 8.1. The
distinct squadrons of an Army are called Heads because they consist of a
certain or select Number, Judge. 7.16. and 9.34, 37, 43. 1 Samuel 11.11. and
13.17. Job 1.17. Finally, the Sections or Divisions of Books are called heads
(Capita) vulgarly Chapters, to which we may Refer what is spoken Psalm. 40.7. In
the volumn of thy Book, which the Apostle, Heb. 10.7. renders (...), Heb. 10.7.
In the Head of thy Book, etc.
in the Head (or Chapter) of thy Book. Upon which Cunaeus lib. 3. de Repub*
Heb. cap. 1. says --, These (...) are nothing else, but those which the Jews,
and especially the Thalmudists call (...), that is, the members or parts of
Books. Therefore the Apostle being himself a Jew, and writing to the Jews, very
significantly makes use of that word. There is a Synecdoche, joined with the
Metaphor here, and by (...) the whole body and volume of the old Testament, in
which the Prophecies and Types of the Messiah are extant, is to be understood.
Hierome on Isa. 29. says, In the Head of the Book (says our Savior in the
Psalm) it is written of me, not of Jeremy or Isaiah, but in all the Holy
Scripture, which is called one Book.

[ A Face] the foremost part of a man's head; Bare and fit for seeing; Face.
and apt to vary its posture or aspect according to the different affections of
the Mind, carries a threefold Metaphorical Notion.

1. It denotes the first part of any thing, 2 Samuel 10.9. Jer. 1.13. Ezekiel. 2.10.

2. The Superficies and external species of any Substance, which appears to, or
is beheld by Men, Genesis 1.2. 1 Samuel 14.25. 2 Samuel 17.19. Isa. 14.21. Luke 21.35.

3. The Mind or inward faculty or affections, as Anger, Joy, Benevolence,
Magnanimity, etc. Genesis 32.20. 1 Samuel 1.5.18. Job 9.27. Prove. 16.15. and 27.17.
Ezekiel. 3.8.

A Forehead] the Superior part of the face, is Metaphorically brought to denote
the Interior Affection of the Mind. A hard forehead denotes obstinacy in
Wickedness, Isa. 48.4. and a persevering Magnanimous Zeal against the Wicked,
Ezekiel. 3.7, 8, 9. A Whores Forehead, Jer. 3.3. signifies extreme Impudence, the
Metaphor being taken from those Graceless, Shameless, and Immodest Prostitutes.

An Eye] the Organ of sight, by a Metaphorical Translation oftentimes denotes
the Mind, Judgment, and Knowledge; Genesis 16.4, 5. Deuteronomy. 15.18. 1 Samuel 15.17. and
18.23. 2 Samuel 6.22. Job 32.1. Psalm. 15.4. Prove. 3.7. and 28.11. and 30.12. Isa.
5.21. Zach. 8.6. Matthew. 6.22. Joh. 5.35. Hence the Right Eye is put for the
greatest Prudence, Zach. 11.17. An Evil Eye, for a perverse and Malignant mind,
Deuteronomy. 15.9. Prove. 23.6. and 28.22. Matthew. 20.15. Mark. 7.22. A Good Eye, for a
Good and benevolent Mind, Prove. 22.9. Eccl. 35.9.

An Eye signifies a providential Carefulness, sometimes a solicitude in Evil,
as Psalm. 10.8. -- 17.8. (see 1 Samuel 18.9.) sometimes in Good, Genesis 44.21. Numb.
10.31. Ruth 2.9. Job 29.15. Psalm. 10.6. Prove. 4.25. and 21.9, 12. Eccl. 2.14.
Sometimes it denotes Experience Genesis 3.7. Sometimes spiritual Illumination or
Renewing of heart, Psalm 13.3. Psalm. 119.18. Isa. 32.3. Ephesians. 1.18. Sometimes
spiritual Blindness, Psalm. 69.23. Isa. 6.10. Matthew. 13.15. Joh. 12.40. Act.
28.27. Romans 11.8, 10. See Lam. 5.17.

(...) oculus and Derivatu^ (...)
It denotes a fountain, Genesis 34.13. and 49.22. Exodus 15.27. Psalm. 84.6. Psalm.
114.8.

A Tear] an humor flowing from the Eyes of such as Weep, metaphorically denotes
Wine and Oil, because they drop as tears do, when the Grapes or Olives are
bruised in the Press, Exodus 22.29. See Deuteronomy. 7.13.

Eye Salve denotes the spiritual healing of our Natural Darkness, Rev. 3.18.
three things are said of a man corrupted by sin, ver. 17. viz. that he is Poor,
Naked and Blind, and therefore Miserable. To remove these three, ver. 18. are
Medicines proposed;

(1) Gold tried in the Fire, (that is, heavenly Treasure) which makes one
Divinely Rich.

(2) White Raiment, (that is, the merits of Christ applied by Faith) by which
nakedness being covered, a man may be preciously adorned.

(3) Eye Salve to anoint the Eyes (that is, the saving word of the Gospel, by
which a man is illuminated) which restores or gives spiritual sight.

[ An Ear] as well as the Eye, is translated to denote the Mind, and when
referred to the Word of God, denotes a faithful attention and Receiving of it,
Psalm. 49.4. and 78.1. and 45.10. Isa. 55.3. where you may Note nevertheless
that the external hearing of the word is not excluded, but presupposed.

Heaviness or shutting of Ears, denotes hardness and stubbornness of heart,
Isa. 6.10. Matthew. 13.15. Act. 28.27. Romans 11.8. Itching ears, denote such as
with a perverse curiosity study after false opinions, 2 Timothy 4.3. with Act.
17.21.

The Phrase, Gal. 6.7. Be not deceived, God is not mocked, is emphatical, for
the word (...), signifies more than to mock, viz. to fleer with the Nose and
Mouth, (...) Authore Polluce Nasum significat Erasm.
And in the times past (as Erasmus and Pliny say) they were wont to use
gestures of derision or mockery by the Nose, from which term ((...)) the word
here is derived. By another Metaphor the Jews call their own King the Breath of
their Nostrils, Lam. 4.20. that is, under whose Protection they did Breath and
were Refreshed, etc.

To speak.
A [ Mouth] is more used in a Metonymy than a Metaphor, yet sometimes it denotes
the Mind and Will of Man, Genesis 24.57. We will ask her mouth, that is, learn her
Mind and Will, 2 Samuel 17.5. To fight with one mouth (so the Hebrew) Josh. 9.2.
that is, with one consent. See Psalm. 126.2. and 103.4, 5. and 81.10, 11. Exodus
4.16.

Prove. 6.13. A perverse man, is said to speak with his feet, and teach with his
fingers, which denotes some composed artificial Gestures of deceit, as when by
treading upon another foot, he signifies something, which is Metaphorically
called speaking: and so by the gestures or numbering of his fingers, informs
another of something he knows not, by way of Confederacy to deceive a third
Person.

A shoulder.
A [ Shoulder] because it bears Burdens, signifies Affliction and Tribulation,
Psalm. 21.12. Isa. 9.4. and 14.25. sometimes obedience, Zeph. 3.9. Zach. 7.11.
Hos. 6.9. Isa. 11.14. Deuteronomy. 33.12.

Isa. 9.6.
Isa. 9.6. The Government shall be upon his shoulders. The sense of this is
variously given by Interpreters. The Chald. understands it of the fulfilling of
Gods Law: thus rendering it, He took the Law upon himself to keep it. Many of
the Fathers understand it of the Cross of Christ, and quote Isa. 22.22. But it
seems plainly to denote the whole administration of Christ's Office. Brentius
upon the place, says, Mundani Monarchae non gestant principatum super humeros
suos, sed, etc. Worldly Monarchs do not bear the burden of Government on their
own shoulders, but transfer it upon their Servants, Counselors, and Civil and
Military Officers, etc. But Christ is such a King, that he bears all the weight
of Government on his own shoulders; for he alone rules, preserves, and Governs
his Church. He only expiated sin. He had no helper, as Earthly Princes are wont
to have, etc.

Arm.
An [ Arm] because it exerts a man's strength, is put for power or strong aid, 1 Samuel 2.31. Job 22.8. and 35.9. and 38.15. and 40.4. Psalm. 44.3. Jer. 17.5. and
48.25. Ezekiel. 30.22. and 31.17. and 22 6. Zach. 11.17. Isa. 9.20. They shall eat
every man the flesh of his own arm, that is, they will destroy and Consume
those of their Friends and Neighbors from whom they were wont to be supplied,
etc.

[ A Hand] the extreme part of the Arm, Hand.
by which works are promptly performed, is also put for strength, Exodus 18.9.
Deuteronomy. 32.36. Josh. 8.20. Job 34.20. Psalm. 89.25. Esa. 28.2. Dan. 12.7. Hence it
is Proverbially said. An Nescis longas Regibus esse Manus?
Do thou not know that Royal hands are long?
that is, that the Kings power reaches a great way.

It is likewise put for Help, Ministry and Machination, which require power,
Exodus 23.1. 1 Samuel 22.17. 2 Samuel 3.12. and 14.19. 2 King. 17.13. Esa. 20.2.
Hag. 1.1. and 2.1. In these last four Texts, A Hand signifies the Ministry. For
the Prophets are the Organs or Instruments of the Holy Spirit, and the
dispensers of the Mysteries of God, which they received, to be communicated to
the people, or to be reached forth, as it were by the hand. As if when one
remits Money or Treasure to be distributed or paid by him, it is said to be by
such a Hand, etc.

Lev. 25.35. It is said and if thy Brother waxes poor and his hand fails,
(so the Hebrew) that is, if through Poverty he be rendered incapable of
Business, Trade, or Employment, and so not able to provide for his Family, etc.
Then Relieve him. The metaphor being taken from a man that's consumed or
weakened by a Disease, who cannot labor with his hands. On the contrary to
strengthen the Hand, is by Counsel and Help to assist, 1 Samuel 23.16. Job 4.3.
Esa. 35.3. When a Hand is attributed to the Earth it signifies a certain place
or space, Deuteronomy. 23.12. Number. 34.3. 2 Samuel 8.3 Esa. 56.5. and 57.9. Jer. 6.3. etc.

[ The Back] denotes alienation, estrangedness, or neglect, Back.
1 King. 14.9. Neh. 9.26. Sometimes it is a symbol of oppression and
affliction, Psalm. 129.3. The Plowers plowed on my Back, etc. Esa. 51.27. Romans
11.10.

[ The Loyns] because the strength of the Body consists in them, Job 40.11. are
metaphorically, (or it may be rather metonymically) put for strength it self,
Esa. 45.1. I will loose (or dissolve) the Loins of Kings, the Septuagint has it
(...), And I will break the strength of Kings. Et fortitudinem Regum frang^^m.
See Psalm. 69.23. Romans 11.10.

This Metaphor chiefly respects the girding of is Loins, which denotes a
confirmation of strength and activity in order to run, labor or fight, 1 King.
18.46. 2 Kings 3.21. Psalm. 18.40. Prove. 31.17. Job 38.3. Jer. 1.10. Esa. 5.27.
etc. Hence the phrase of girding the Loins, is translated to spirituals, Esa.
11.5. denoting the faithfulness, alacrity and expedition of the Messiah. In his
great Mediational and Redeeming Office, Psalm. 45.3. In the faithful Members of
Christ, it denotes Christian vigilance and perseverance in the profession of
Truth and Piety, Luke 12.35. 1 Pet. 1.13. Ephesians. 6.14. Upon which place Hemingius
says, As the Loins, in which are the chiefest strength of the Body, are made
more firm by girding, making the Soldier in fight more steady and active: So
the heart is made more firm by the Truth of God, which causes, that in our
Doubts and Hesitations the Devil cannot overthrow and destroy us.

[ A Navel] by which nourishment is conveyed to the Infant in the Womb, Navel.
is by an elegant Metaphor transferred to the Sons of the Church, Prove. 3.8. It
(that is, to Fear the Lord, and depart from evil) shall be Health, (or a
medicine) to thy Navel; as if he had said, as the child is nourished by the
Navel so the knowledge and fear of, and obedience to God, will by the blessed
Spirit feed, educate and comfort. It is added, and watering or moistning to thy
bones, that is, it shall be thy whole strength, as the bones are moistened and
strengthened by Marrow, as Job 21.24. etc. Not cutting the Navel, is
allegorically translated to denote the primitive, miserable and abominable
state of the Jewish People, Ezekiel. 16.4. It signifies the middle or an eminent
place in the Earth, as the Navel is in the midst, Judge. 9.37. Hence God is said
to work Salvation in the midst of the Earth, Psalm. 74, 12. Because Judea was
esteemed so by the Geographers of those times.

[ A Bosome] is put for the middle or concavity of a Chariot, 1 King. 22.35.
Ezekiel. 43.13, 14, 17. And because that part for modesties sake is covered with a
garment, it is applied to the hidden and inward parts of man, Job 19.27. Eccl.
7.10. Psalm. 89.51. and 35.12, 13. It carries the notion of Love, because of
Conjugal embraces, Deuteronomy. 1^^.6. and 28.56.

Eternal Life is called the Bosom of Abraham. Luke 16, 22. Upon which Brentius
in his Commentary. Sinum Abrahae Intelligas non corporalem quendam and externum
hujus saeculi locum etc.
By the Bosom of Abraham you are not to understand a certain corporal or
external place in this World, but either the promise of Christ made to Abraham,
In thy Seed shall all Nations be blessed; or Christ himself who came of the
Seed of Abraham; for in this sense all the Godly that sleep in the Lord are
reposited or rest in Christ himself, till in the last day they rise together
with their bodies, Acts. 7.59. Phil. 1.23. Therefore when Lazarus is said to be
carried by Angels into Abraham's Bosom, we are to understand, that he was in
the enjoyment of supreme felicity in Christ, in the latter day shall be
revealed, etc.

Abraham is proposed as the Father of all believers, Romans 4.11, 12. Because
such as follow his steps, and constantly persevere in Faith and Godliness to
the end, shall as our Savior shows be gathered together in Immortal Life: For
tender Children are wont to be carried and cherished in the Bosom of their
Loving Parents. Ruth. 4.16. 1 Kings 17.19.

This Term denotes the condition of Eternal Life, for the carrying of Infants
in the Bosom of the Parent, denotes love and intimate good Will; so in the
heavenly Life, there is most pure love, from whence arises true Joy. In the
Bosom of the Parent, the Infant finds rest and defense, so in heaven, there is
certain security and a most quiet tranquillity, etc.

A Bosom by a Metonymie signifies a Garment, that covers it, which being loose
is convenient to receive and carry things, Prove. 6.27. and 16.33. Therefore
metaphorically it is put for the retribution of reward or punishment. Of Reward
as 2 Samuel 12.8. Luke 6.38. Of Punishment, as Psalm. 79.12. Esa. 65.6, 7. Jer.
32.18.

[ To Strengthen feeble Knees] signifies to comfort such as are cast down by
anguish or sorrow of mind, and confirm them by Instruction and Counsel, Job
4.4. Esa. 35.3. Heb. 12.12. The metaphor being taken from outward perils which
invade upon a sudden, in which the knees of an affrighted and fearful man are
weakened, because the strength of the Nerves and Muscles, by the terror of
sudden danger leaves its operation, which for bearing the body resides in the
knees. Hence a sudden or pannick fear is expressed by the weakness or beating
together of the Knees, Psalm. 109.24. Ezekiel. 7.17. Dan. 5.6. Nahum. 2.11.

[ The Feet] are metaphorically (as well as by another Trope) taken diverse
ways; Of which take some of the Chief.

1. With respect to Externals, Job says chap. 29. ver. 15. That he was Feet to
the Lame -- that is, he relieved the miserable, as the Feet help men to get out
of danger. See Genesis 30.30. noting the marginal reading. The Foot of Pride,
Psalm. 36.11. denotes the violence of proud Enemies -- The slipping, halting
etc. of the Feet, etc. denotes danger and Calamity, Job 12.5. Psalm. 38.17. and
116.8. and 140.4.11. etc. See Jer. 30.16.

On the contrary to deliver the feet from falling denotes divine protection,
against any malignant Enemies, Psalm. 56.13. and 18.36. and 91.12. Psalm. 121.3.
etc. To tread with the feet, denotes to disgrace, or to insult upon one, as an
Enemy, Psalm. 7.5. and 91.12, 13. Ezekiel. 34.18, 19. Matthew. 7.6. Luke 10.19. Heb.
10.29.

[ Lameness or Halting] which is a disease or accidental hurt of the Feet
denotes Calamity, Affliction, and Dangers, Psalm. 35.15. In mine halting (we
translate it adversity) they rejoiced, Psalm. 38.18. Jer. 20.10. Mich 4.6, 7.
Zeph. 3.19. In which two last places the Term (...) is Feminine alluding to the
voice of a sheep upon which Illyricus says, That it is a speech taken from
Sheep: For many of them in the Summer especially those of hotter Countries do
halt, or go lame, or else it may relate to the People and Church, of which the
Scripture speaks in the Feminine Gender, as before.

2. With respect to Internals and spirituals, because the Life of man and the
exercise of Godliness is compared to walking or running, and so the Feet
translated to the mind, signify desire and a holy endeavor, as the outward
running or hastening to a place is performed by the Feet, Psalm. 17.5. and
119.59, 105. (with ver. 32.) Prove. 4.26, 27. Eccl. 4.17. The Beautifulness of
the Apostles feet, Esa. 52.7. Romans 10.15. is not to be understood of their
bodily Feet, but of the interior and Divine, as well with respect to their
Mission, or being sent, as also the (...), or fervor in teaching, as a footman
in an Errand of great concern performs his Journey speedily, Nahum. 2.1. Some
interpret it thus: It is not prancing Horses, Cathedral Seats, costly and
magnificent Vestments, Cardinals Hats, and other precious worldly accoutrements
that are commended, but simply the feet which denotes the humility of their
Apostolical legation or Embassy, and all their Successors are exhorted to the
same virtue, 1 Cor. 2.3, 4. Gal. 4.13, 14. etc.

Ephesians. 6.15. The Feet are said to be shod, Ephesians. 6.15*
upon which a learned Expositor says the feet signify the Ministry of the
Gospel, which must be shod, that is, defended with Boots or Shoes, from
Thorns, Briars and Dirt, that is, that they may be able to go through all
Dangers in Teaching and Confessing the Gospel. See Ezekiel. 16.10. What we
translate ( uprightly) Gal. 2.14. is in the Greek (...), recto pede incederent,
that is, walk with a right foot, viz. according to the rule and measure of the
Gospel. See Heb. 12.13.

Hitherto we have treated of the dissimilary parts of a humane Body. The
similary parts yield but few Metaphors.

[ The biting of the Flesh] Job 13.14. is transferred to the mind, Flesh.
why should I take away my Flesh with my Teeth. that is, consume my self with
Cares. (See 1 Samuel 19.5. Eccl. 4.5.

[ Blood] in a Metaphor as Illyricus says, Cl. Script. Col. 1083. signifies
spiritual Death, or Eternal Destruction, Ezekiel. 3.18. and 33.8. Acts 18.6. and
20.26. etc.

Of Metaphors from such things as concern the Life of Man.
TO the Body and its Members aptly succeeds its Union with the Soul, whence
Life proceeds. The word ( Soul) has no metaphorical notion, except when
attributed to God, which belongs to an Anthropopathy, as was before expounded.

[ Life] is used metaphorically; as Living waters are put for such as flow
briskly, Life. To Live. To be quickened
and plentifully, Genesis 26.19. Prove. 10.11. Jer. 2.13. and 17.13. etc. Time is
said to live, and a Building, to be quickened, of which before chap. 9. Sect. 4.
See Hab. 3.2. To Live and Life] are put for happiness, strength, and health, 1
King 1.25. Psalm. 69.32, 33. Eccl. 6.8.

[ Health] or Soundness is put for the Word or Doctrine of God and Eternal
Life, the consequence of receiving it, 1 Timothy 1.10. and 6.3. 2 Timothy 1.13. and
4.3. Tit. 1.9.13. and 2.1, 2, 8. Hereby is denoted the condition and quality,
as well as the fruit and efficacy of both, etc.

[ To Cure or Heal] metaphorically signifies a deliverance or Restoration from
Calamity, Adversity or Trouble, To Heal.
Exodus 15.26. 2 Chronicles. 7.14. and 36.16. John 13.4. Prove. 3.8. and 12.18. and
13.17. and 14.30. Esa. 3.7. and 58.8. Jer. 8.22. and 30.13, 14, 17. Lam. 2.13.
Hos. 14.5. And when Translated to the Soul it denotes the free Pardon and
Remission of Sin, (that disease of the Soul) through the merits of our Blessed
Redeemer, Psalm. 6.2. and 41.4. and 147.3. Esa. 6.10. and 19.21. and 30.26. and
53.5. Jer. 3.22. Malach. 4.2. Matthew. 13.15. (with Mark 4.12.) John 12.40. Act
28.27. 1 Pet. 2.24. etc.

And in Regard the knowing and manifestation of the disease and its Cause, is
the beginning of a Cure, therefore this term is Elegantly transferred to the
Ministers of the Word, whose Office it is to show people their sins, and rebuke
it, Jer. 6.14. They have healed the bruise of the Daughter of my people
slightly --, that is, did not reprehend, as much as need was.

To Health, are opposed in general, Diseases, Griefs, Pains, Wounds, Stripes,
etc. In which there is a Metaphorical Translation.

(...) dolor afficietis.
1. To Inanimates, 2 Kin. 3.19. And ye shall grieve (or pain) every good piece
of land with stones; that is. cover, corrupt or mar it. It denotes the
irruptions of Enemies to annoy the whole Jewish Polity, Deuteronomy. 29.22, 23. Isa.
1.5, 6, 7, 8.

2. To Man, denoting his depraved Nature, Jer. 17.9. Psalm. 38.3, 5, 7, 8. Isa.
53.4. Matthew. 9.12, 13. Mark 2.17. Luke 5.31, 32. 1 Timothy 6.4. a corrupt captious
wrangler about words and questions is called (...) sick about questions, to
which is elegantly opposed, ver. 3. of the wholesome words ((...) for sound
speeches) of our Lord Jesus Christ.

All humane Calamities which afflict a man, like a Disease, are represented by
this similitude, Psalm. 77.10. Jer. 10.19. Job 9.17. Eccl. 5.12.15. and 6.2.
Isa. 1.6. and 30.26. Jer. 15.8. and 30.12, 14, 15. Lam. 2.13. Hos. 5.13. Wounds
denote sharp reprehension, Prove. 27.6. See Psalm. 141.5.

More specially what are adverse to health, and Metaphorically used are,

[ Brands or Marks] or scars of Wounds are put for persecution for the
confession of Christ which Paul gives an account of with respect to himself, as
you may see by their Catalogue, 1 Cor. 4. 2 Cor. 6. and 11. What a seared
Conscience is, we have before spoke in Metaphors taken from fire.

Leanness or Corruption.
[ Leanness, Thinness, etc.] are put for Calamities, Punishments and Anguish,
Isa. 17.4. and 24.16. Ezekiel. 33.10. Zeph. 2.11. ( Psalm. 73.8. it is spoke of
Tyrants) Rottenness of bones] denotes dolors and terrors of Mind, Prove. 14.30.
Hab. 3.16. Prove. 12.4. To Rot] is to Perish, Prove. 10.7. etc.

Plague.
[ The Plague] denotes a very mischievous and destroying man, Act. 24.5. where
Paul was accounted by the wicked Jews a Pestilent fellow. Poison.
Poyson] a very killing and fatal Ingredient, that commonly destroys men,
unless expelled by very Sovereign and powerful Antidotes, denotes devilish
Doctrine, as also the malice and malignity of the Wicked, who (as far as they
can) destroy the Souls, Bodies and Good Name of honest pious men, Deuteronomy. 32.33.
Psalm. 58.4. Romans 3.13.

Death.
To Life is opposed [ Death] which is either the privation of Natural Life,
because of the separation of the Soul from the Body: or the privation of
spiritual and heavenly life, because of the separation of the Soul from God
through sin. Both these not Metaphorically, but properly are to be understood,
Genesis 2.17.

To Dye to sin.
But [ To Dye] is used Metaphorically, when Believers are said to Dye to sin,
Romans 6.2, 7, 11. that is to renounce it, and to be idle and unfruitful with
respect to it, as a Dead man naturally neither Acts nor Operates.

But, [ To be Dead in Sins and Trespasses] is quite another thing, Ephesians. 2.1, 5.
for that denotes spiritual Death, when men by sin separate themselves from the
Grace of God, and the hope of Eternal Life, when their sins are not remitted:
In which sense Matthew. 8.22. Joh. 5.25. 1 Timothy 5.6. are taken. Paul asserts
himself to be Dead to the Law, Gal. 2.19. that is, the accusation or curse of
it, for he could not by that be Justified, nor did he depend upon works but
upon free Grace, and so was Dead as to that hope, (viz. of a legal
Justification) as a Dead man has not the power of operation, See Romans 7.4.10.
To be Dead from the Elements of the World, Col. 2.20. is to be freed by Christ
from the observation of the difference of Levitical Meats and the Mosaical
Ceremonies (this was the Jewish Paedagogy) by which God informed the world,
Gal. 4.3. And Col. 3.3. (see 1 John 3.1.) Believers are said to be Dead to the
World, etc. which denotes an abrenunciation of its depraved concupiscences, and
mad pleasures --, the Text says, for ye are Dead, Col. 3.3.
and your life is hid with Christ in God; that is, as Erasmus says in his
Paraphrase: ye seem Dead to this World, because ye do not relish the Glories
thereof, nor are moved with those vanities which the worldings admire.
Therefore you do not live here so, as to attract the splendid Notice of Men,
but you live in Christ with God, although your life is hid according to the
Judgment of the World, etc.

Death] is attributed to Seed, or Corn cast into the Earth, Joh. 12.24. 1 Cor.
15.36. not because it perishes, but because of its change, it becoming the root
of much fruit. In the first text it tacitly denotes the Death of Christ, and in
the second the Death of Believers, whose Resurrection is also denoted by this
similitude or Metaphor of a Corn, or grain.

Of Metaphors from Humane Sense.
GEnerally feeling, sense, or the Instrument of sense, (called in Greek (...),)
are transferred to the Mind, which Metaphor, is frequent among the Latins,
Luke 9.45. that they may not (...) feel it, that is understand it as it is
expounded, Chap. 18.34. Phil. 1.9. what we translate Judgment in the Greek is
(...) sense, viz. a lively faith in Christ. Tit. 1.1, 2. Joh. 17.3. Isa. 53.11.
See Romans 5.1, 5. and 8.16, 17. and 14.17. See also Heb. 5.14. with 1 Cor. 2.
13.15.

[ Sight or Seeing] denotes experience or enjoyment, Exodus 20.18. Number. 20.23.
Psalm. 4.6, 7. and 16.9, 10. and 27.12, 13. and 34.12, 13. and 49.10, 11. and
60.4, 5.89.48, 49. Psalm. 90.49, 50. and 91.15, 16. and 98.2, 3. and 128.6.
Eccl. 8.16. (where, to see sleep, denotes to sleep; so, to see corruption in
Death, Psalm. 16.9, 10.) Eccl. 9.9. Isa. 44.16. Jer. 17.8. and 43.14. Lam. 3.1.
Luke 2.26. (where to see Death signifies to Dye) Luke 17.22. Joh. 8.51, 56.
Rev. 18.7. etc.

Especially the Verb to see] is used to denote a real experience of Promises of
great things, Isa. 53.11. and 60.5. and 66.14. and of Punishment under
Comminanation, Isa. 26.11.

2. It is transferred to the Mind and Intellect, and signifies to know or
understand, Genesis 42.1. Eccl. 1.16. Jer. 2.31. Matthew. 2.16. and 9.2, 4. Romans
7.23. with ver. 7. Rev. 1.12. To think or consider, Genesis 20.10. and 49.15.
Eccl. 1.14. Isa. 22.9. and 5.12. Matthew. 6.26. (see Luke 12.24.) Romans 11.22.
Col. 4.17. Jam. 1.25. To provide carefully, Genesis 41.33. etc. or avoid hurt,
Matthew. 9.30. Mark 12.38, etc.

3. It signifies spiritual vision, as the Prophecies, Number. 24.16, 17. 1 Samuel
9.9. Isa. 30.10. etc.

It is said of Angels that they desire (...) to look into the Mysteries of the
Gospel, 1 Pet. 1.12. that is, they coveted a full and perfect knowledge of it,
such is the Majesty and Beauty of that blessed Mystery.

To Sight is opposed Blindness] by which the want of true Faith and Gospel
Illumination is noted, Isa. 42.18, 19. Lam. 4.14. Matthew. 15.14. and 23.16, 24,
26. Joh. 9.39. Romans 2.19. 2 Pet. 1.9. 1 John 2.11. Rev. 3.17.

[ Blindness] attributed to the Wicked Denotes three things, as;

1. 1 John 2.11. Darkness has blinded his Eyes, this is the proximate and
immediate Cause, viz. a corrupt mind and Will expressed by the term Darkness,
(See Ephesians. 4.18.)

2. 2 Cor. 4.4. It is said that the God of this world has blinded the Eyes of
them that Believe not, etc. This is the first cause of all Evil and
Condemnation, viz. the Devil seducing and hardening men.

3. John 12.40. It is said, He (that is God) has blinded their Eyes, In what
respects this is attributed to God the great and sole Fountain of Goodness and
Mercy, you may find expounded in Gram. Sacra. p. 285.286.

It is said Exodus 23.8. That gifts blind the seeing, that is, Bribes corrupt
the wise and skilful to pervert Justice. And therefore blindness with the
Synonimous Terms are ascribed to the wicked that will not take Counsel, Deuteronomy.
28.28. Esa. 8.21, 2^^. and 59.9, 10. Zeph. 1.17.

Whiteness.
The Object of sight are Colors. Of these Whiteness] is a most exact symbol of
inward purity and cleansing from sin, Psalm. 51.7. Esa. 1.18. Rev. 7.14. A
metaphor taken from Linen, which when foul is restored to its color, by
washing, and cleansing it from all spots.

Outward Whiteness] as by rubbing of chalk or washing with Lime, denotes
Hypocrisy, Act. 23.2. See Matthew. 23.27. Ezekiel. 13.10. and 22.28, etc. Of the
White Stone, Rev. 2.17. we will treat anon.

[ Redness] or a Red color is attributed to Sin, Esa. 1.18. where the Prophets
respects Blood as ver. 15. by which, not only Homicides or killing of men is
metonymically understood, but also all enormous sins by a Synecdoche. For as
blood rashly spilt, contaminates the Homicide, and renders him guilty, 1 Kings
2.5, 6, 31.32, 33. So Sins are nothing but an abominable spot and contamination
in the sight of God.

To this cursed Redness, the blessed blood of Christ is opposed, which expiates
sin, and converts it into whiteness. See Rev. 1.5. and 7.14. etc.

Blackness.
[ Blackness,] with Comeliness is mentioned as the beauty of the Spouse, Cant.
1.5. The first denoting Sin and Affliction, the latter Divine Grace which
Regenerates and Renews. Sermon. 8. de Temp.
Augustine says, Black by Nature, fair by Grace; black in Original sin, fair by
Regeneration. Beda upon the place, Black by the adversity of oppressions, but
fair by the Beauty of virtues. Whiteness and Redness are attributed to the
heavenly Spouse, Cant. 5.10. denoting extraordinary beauty, loveliness and
health, the native sign of which, that color is. Some say that he is called
white, with respect to his Divinity, and red with respect to his humanity:
White because of his purity, and (...), (that is, being without sin) and red,
because his blood was poured out, etc.

[ Hearing and to Hear] denotes,

(1.) The inward understanding, intelligence or discretion of the mind Genesis
11.7. and 41.15. and 42.23. 2 Kings 18.26. Esa. 36.11. Jerem. 5.15. Matthew.

2. Approbation and Obedience, Genesis 3.17. -- 21.12. Josh. 1.17, 18. Judge. 2.17,

9.27. -- 10.27. 1 Timothy 4.16. See Jam. 1.22. etc.

To Hearing is opposed Deafness] denoting, unbelieving, wicked, and obstinate
sinners, Esa. 42.18, 19. with 6.10. it is spoke of the Converted, Esa. 29.18.

[ Smell] what relates to this sense we have in part showed before, A thread of
Tow is said to Smell the Fire, (so the Hebrew) Judge. 16.9. when it touches it,
and finds its force. See chap. 15.14. also Job 14.9. and 39.25. Bad Report is
said to stink, Genesis 34.30. Exodus 5.21. 1 Samuel 13.4. 2 Samuel 10.6. -- 16.21. Dan.
6.14.

[ To Tast] is put for to understand, experience, or enjoy, Psalm. 34.8, 9.
Prove. 31.18. Matthew. 16.28. John 8.52. Heb. 6.4, 5. 1 Pet. 2.3. Hence the Noun
(...) Gustus, Taste, translated to the Mind signifies Counsel, Judgment, or
Reason, 1 Samuel 21.13. -- 25.33. Psalm. 119.66. Prove. 11.22. Job 12.20. Dan.
3.10.12. Jonas 3.7.

[ Sweetness] or to be sweet) is a metaphor well known, and signifies to
delight, or to be well pleased in a thing, Job 20.12. Psalm. 55.14. Prove. 3.24.
and 9.17. (where by a metaphor of stolen Waters, which are said to be sweet,
and bread of Secrecies to be pleasant, wicked Company-keeping with an
Adulteress is expressed) Cant. 2.3, 14. -- 5.16. Jer. 31.26. etc. See Prove.
3.22. Psalm. 19.10, 11. Psalm. 119.103.

[ Bitterness, or to be bitter] denotes an overwhelming with Calamity, which
are as hateful to the mind and sense, as bitterness is to the Taste, Genesis
26.35. Exodus 1.14. Ruth 1.20. 1 Samuel 30.6. and 1.10. 2 Kin. 4.27. Job 13.26.
and 21.25. Prove. 17.25. Isa. 38.17. Lam. 3.15. Ezekiel. 3.14. Zach. 12.10. etc.
Isa. 24.9.

It betokens that which is evil and hurtful, Prove. 5.4. Jer. 2.19. and so is
applied to Idols Hos. 12.15. More especially it denotes anger or fierceness and
cruelty of Mind, Genesis 49.23. Judge. 18.25. 2 Samuel 17.8. Hab. 1.6. Ephesians. 4.31.
Col. 3.19. It denotes Calumny, Romans 3.14. Jam. 3.14. with ver. 8, 9, 10, 11.
Sin, as Acts 8.23. Romans 3.14. Heb. 12.15. Matthew. 26.75. Luke 22.62.

The Object of Touch is hard and soft. Hardness is spoken

1. Of Men; and denotes, Hardness.


(1) Pravity, Pertinacy, and Stubbornness of Mind, Exodus 7.3. and 13.15. Deuteronomy.
2.30. and 10.16. Prove. 28.15. Isa. 48.4. -- 63.17. Ezekiel. 2.4. Matthew. 19.8. Mark
10.5. Acts 19.9. Romans 2.5. and 9.18. Heb. 3.8, 13, 15. and 4.7.

(2) It denotes cruelty and unmercifulness, Genesis 49.7. Judge. 4.24. 1 Samuel 5.7.
Isa. 8.22. and 19.4. Matthew. 25.24.

(3) Afflictions and sadness, 1 Samuel 1.15. Job 30.25. Psalm. 60.5. etc.

2. Of Things, and so their perplexity, difficulty, and grievousness is

Jam. 3.4.

3. Of Speech, and words, as when they are bitter, Genesis 42.7. 2 Samuel 19.4^^.
Psalm. 31.18. when they are difficult to be understood, 2 Kin. 2.10. Joh. 6.60.
He is called hard, who denounces evil or adversity, or any misfortune, 1 Kin.
14.6.

[ Softness] is applied,

1. To the heart of man, and Denotes consternation and fear Deuteronomy. 20.3. Job
23.16. Jer. 51.46. Isa. 7.4. Also contrition and Repentance, 2 Kin. 22.19. with
Ezekiel 36.26. By the softness or Effeminacy, 1 Cor. 6.9. is meant those impure
Wretches that unnaturally abuse themselves or others, as Illyricus says.

2. To speech, as flattery, Psalm. 5.9. and 12.3. and 55.21. Prove. 2.16. -- 7.5.
-- 26.29. -- 28.23. and 29.5. In which places the term, (...) molle, mild, or
soft is used for flattery. Sometimes it notes mildness and humanity joined with
Prudence, Prove. 15.1. and 25.15. where the word mollis, mild.
(...) is used. See Job 40.22.

[ Sleep] the Cessation of the Senses, by which is signified

1. Security, as that of Faith, by those that depend upon and acquiesce in the
Lord, Psalm. 3.5. and 127.2. Ezekiel. 34.25. Sometimes it denotes the carnal
security of wicked and unbelieving men, Romans 13.11. Ephesians. 5.14. 1 These. 5.6, 7.
Hence it is said, Isa. 29.10. He has poured on them the spirit of Deep sleep,
etc.

2. Sloth, Laziness or sluggishness, which sleepy persons are very subject to,
Prove. 6.9, 10. and 24.33. Isa. 56.10. Nah. 3.18. Isa. 5.27. 2 Pet. 2.3. etc.

3. Death and destruction, Job 3.13. and 14.12. with 16.22. Psalm. 13.3. and
76.6. Jer. 51.39. Hence the Profane Authors call sleep the Image of Death;
Mortis Imago. Somnus et Mors g^^mini So^^ni frater mors.
Homer calls Sleep and Death Twins, and Hesiod calls sleep the Brother of Death.

Believers are said to sleep when they Die a Corporal Death, Matthew. 27.52. Joh.
11.11, 13. Act. 7.60. and 13.36. 1 Cor. 15.18, 20, 51. 1 These. 4.13, 14, 15.
The Reasons are elsewhere given, the Substance of which is, that their Souls
have blessed Rest with God, and their Bodies have rest in the Grave, Isa. 57.1,
2. In the certain hope of a future Resurrection, Act. 2.26. Rev. 14.13. Psalm.
17.14, 15. Sleep being a representation or figure of both, in which there is
rest from Labor, and a refreshing of strength, etc.

To sleep is opposed Watching] therefore the Reason of it in signification is
opposite with Respect to sleep.

1. As sleep denotes carnal security, so watchfulness signifies true
Repentance, and a serious and diligent exercise of Piety, Matthew. 24.42. and
25.13. Mark 13.35. Luke 21.36. 1 Cor. 16.13. Romans 13.11. 1 Cor. 15.34. Ephesians.
5.14. and 6.18. Col. 4.2. 1 These. 5.6, 10. 1 Pet. 5.8. Rev. 3.2, 3. and 16.15.
etc.

2. As sleep denotes sloth and laziness; so watchfulness signifies alacrity,
diligence and prudence, in the management of Duty or Office, Psalm. 127.1. Act.
20.31. Hab. 13.17.

3. As sleep denotes Death, so watchfulness denotes Life, both are joined
together, 1 These. 5.10. See Romans 14.8. more comparisons might be made, but they
are obvious.

Metaphors from the various Differences of Mankind.
WE will consider the Differences of humane kind with respect, 1. To Sex 2.
Age. 3. Relation. 4. Country or Family. And although some of these belong to
the head of Adjuncts, yet for more commodious order we will place them here.

Man.
1. As to Sex; they are Man and Woman. [ A Man] (...) Metaphorically denotes, a
Stout, Courageous, Eminent Person. 1 Samuel 26.15. In that Irony of David, Art
not thou a Man? that is, have thou not behaved thy self gallantly? Jer. 5.1.
Seek in the Broad places thereof (that is Jerusalem) if ye can find a man; that
is, a wise man, etc. 1 Kin. 2.2, 3. Psalm. 49.2, 3. -- 4.3. -- 118.5, 6. --
144.2, 3. -- 82.6, 7. 1 Cor. 3.21. -- 7.23. -- 16.13. etc.

A [ Woman] on the Contrary, denotes one that is timorous, weak and dispirited,
Woman.
Isa. 3.12. Jer. 51.30. Nahum 3.13. See Jer. 48.41. Isa. 19.16. Hence a sort of
men are called effeminate, etc.

The Church is likned to a chaste Virgin; 2 Cor. 11.2. See Hosea 2.19. This
Metaphor alludes to the legal type of the high Priest, who might marry none but
a Virgin, Lev. 21.14. See Cant. 1.3. Zach. 9.17. Rev. 14.4. To which Spiritual
Whoredom and Adultery is opposed.

2. The Age of man may be thus distinguished, viz. Infants, Boys, Youths, Men,
old Men. Infants and infancy.
A sucking Infant and Boy, Metaphorically denote,

(1) True Believers, Psalm. 8.2, 3. Matthew. 11.25. Luke 10.21. See Matthew. 18.3,
4. 1 Cor. 14.20. 1 Pet. 2.1, 2. etc.

(3) Fools and wicked men destitute of the knowledge of Truth, Isa. 28.9. and
65.20. Ephesians. 4.14. Sucking is attributed to the Church, Isa. 49.23. and 60.16. 2
Cor. 8.1, 2, 3, 4. The Consolation of the Gospel which the faithful enjoy in
the Church is compared to sucking, Isa. 66.11, 12.

When the term Boy, or little one is attributed to Princes or Magistrates, it
denotes Folly and lack of Prudence, Eccl. 10.16, 17. Isa. 3.4, 12.

Childhood or youth.
[ Childhood] signifies the time of Isreal's departure out of Egypt, Jer. 3.4.
Thou art the guide of my childhood. See Hos. 2.15. and 11.1. Ezekiel. 23.19. It
denotes spiritual strength, Psalm. 103.4, 5.

Manhood
[ Manhood] Ephesians. 4.13. denotes the perfection of Wisdom and knowledge in
Believers, viz. so much as is attainable in this World, to which childhood is
opposed, ver. 14.

Old Age.
[ Old Age] Sometimes has the notion of Wisdom. Hence the term Elders is applied
to Senators, in whom not always Age, but Prudence is respected, 2 Kin. 10.1.
etc. Hence also the term is used, of the Chief Officers of the Church, 1 Timothy
5.1, 17, 19. Tit. 1.5. Heb. 11.2. Jam. 5.14. 1 Pet. 5.1. and 5.5.

3. The Relations which afford any Metaphors are, A Spouse, Husband, Wife;
Widow; Father, Mother, Son; Brother, Sister; Lord, Servant; Master, Scholar.

By the Metaphor of Espousals, Spouse.
(which is the most pleasant Metaphor of all) the Spiritual Union between
Christ and the Church is expressed, Hos. 2.19, 20. Matthew. 22.2. and the
following verses, Joh. 3.29. 2 Cor. 11.3. Rev. 21.2, 9.10. etc. See the
Metaphor of a Bridegroom in the second Book, where the Parallel is Run.

From the Names of Husband and Wife a few Metaphors are taken as Isa. 54.5.
where God calls himself the (...) husband of the Church. Husband.
The text is word for word for word from the Hebrew, thy makers are thy
husbands, which plural phrase denotes the Mystery of the Trinity --. Hence the
Land of Sion, (that is the Church) is said to be (...) Beulah, that is Married,
Isa. 62.4. etc.

Widdowhood denotes desolation, Isa. 47.8, 9. Hence it is said Jer. 51.5.

A Father (...) with respect to Diverse attributes, yields diverse Metaphors.
Father.


1. With respect to begetting and production, he is put for the Author of any
thing, Genesis 4.20, 21. Job 38.28. John 8.44.

2. With respect to the Education of his children, he is put for a Doctor,
Teacher or Master, Judge. 17.10. 2 Kings 2.12. (hence comes the appellation of
Children of the Prophets, 2 Kings 6.1. and elsewhere, by which their Disciples
are understood) Matthew. 23.9. 1 Cor. 1.15. Acts 18.8, 9, 10.11.

3. Because he governs his Children, he is put for a Prince or superior, 1 Samuel
24.11. 2 Kings 5.13. Isa. 22.21. Hence Deborah is called a Mother, Judge. 5.7.

4. Because of his Conversation with his Children, he is put for any thing most

Babylon or the Antichristian Church is called the Mother of fornications and
abominations of the Earth; that is, that Invented, confirmed, propagated, and
defended the Idolatries, damnable Doctrines, Errors, Nefarious wickednesses of
all sorts of Men, which are mystical whoredom, and the greatest abomination in
the sight of God.

By Allusion to the Man's words that said to Christ, Matthew. 12.47. Mat. 12.49.
Thy Mother and thy Brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee; Christ
calls his Disciples and all Believers his Mother, Brothers and Sisters, that
is, they were as Dear to him as such, and denotes that Spiritual Relation is of
higher value, than Earthly. The Parting of two ways is called a Mother, Ezekiel.
21.21. because two ways, as if they were two Daughters, proceed from it.

A Son (...), Ben,] what significations this is of, may be read, Chap. 7. Son.
Sons of God.
All Believers are called the Sons of God, Joh. 1.12, 13. Romans 8.14, 16, 17,
19, 21. Gal. 3.26. and 4.5, 6. 1 Pet. 1.14.23. 1 John 3.1, 2. etc. Because of
the Mystery of Regeneration. And because this is effected by Preaching of the
word. Paul calls his Converts his Sons, 1 Cor. 4.14, 17. Philemon ver. 10. Thus
such as Believe as Abraham did, and only such, are called his seed or Children,
Sons of Abraham.
and he their Father, Romans 4.16. See Romans 9.7, 8, 9. and Gal. 4.22. etc.

The Impious and unbelieving on the Contrary are called the Children of the
Devil, Acts 13.10. 1 John 3.10. (See ver. 8.) and 1 John 8.44. because they
imitate him in Wickedness.

Princes and Magistrates are called Sons of the most high, Psalm. 82.6. Ps.
82.6. Sons of the most high.
Not with respect to their Faith, but

(1) Because they are on Earth as it were Gods heirs, succeeding in a certain
part of Judiciary Authority.

(2) Because they are of such Authority on Earth that God tenders and loves
them, and commands Reverence and Obedience to them, Romans 13.1. etc.

First begotten Son] in a Metaphor obtains the Notion of Excellence and
Prerogative, and is put for one very dear and precious, as the eldest Son is to
the Parent, Exodus 4.22. Jer. 31.9, 20. etc.

An Orphan denotes a forlorn and helpless condition, Psalm. 10.14.18. Lam. 5.3.
Orphan. Fatherless.
Hence John 14.18. Christ promises his Disciples that he would not leave them
((...)) Orphans, that is destitute of help. A Brother] is put for that which is
like a thing, Job 30.29. Prove. 18.9. A man and his Brother denote, society or
mutual engagement, Genesis 26.31. and 37.19. and 42.21, 28. Exodus 16.15. Number.
14.4. Jer. 23.35. and 25.26. Mal. 2.10. See Exodus 25.20. Job 4.8. Joel 2.8. A
w^^man and her sister, Exodus 26.3, 5, 6, 17. Ezekiel. 1.9, 23. and 3.13. etc. See
also Jer. 23.35. and 31.34. Isa. 34.15, 16.

A Lord (...) Baal] the Metaphorical significations hereof are at large given
Gram. Sacr p. 120. seqq.
elsewhere. The Principal Species of Lordship is Royalty, which to figure the
eminency of heavenly glory is attributed to Believers, who are called Kings,
Rev. 1.6. and 5.10. See Matthew. 25.34. Dan. 7.22.27. 1 Pet. 2.9. Hence is the
mention of Thrones, Rev. 3.21. and 4.4. Matthew. 19.28. and 22.30. Of Royal
Government, Rev. 2.26, 27. And a Crown, ver. 11. and elsewhere frequently.

A Servant, to serve, and servitude] have very many Metaphorical acceptations,
denoting sometimes good, sometimes evil.

1. Good, as the service of God (of which there is frequent mention in
Scripture) by which his sincere worship, in Faith and Obedience is noted. So a
man is said to be the servant of Righteousness when he serves God in Faith,
Holiness and Righteousness, Romans 6.16, 18, 19. Luke 1.75. To serve other men,
Matthew. 20.27. Mark 10.43, 44. Gal. 5.13. denotes an officious Humility, and
Beneficence, the fruit of Faith. So Paul was the servant of Christians; 2 Cor.
4.5. See 1 Cor. 9.19. Paul says that he brought his body into (...) servitude,
1 Cor. 9.27. which denotes mortification.

2. It denotes Evil, when it respects sin, and what relates to it. To serve
sin, denotes impenitence, John 8.34. Romans 6.6, 17, 19, 20. Tit. 3.3. 2 Pet.
2.19. To serve Mammon, denotes worldly-mindedness, and a greedy desire after
ill got riches, Matthew. 6.24. To serve the Belly, denotes an indulging ones self
in Carnal pleasures, Romans 16.18. See Phil. 3.19. Tit. 3.3. To serve much wine
((...)) denotes Drunkenness, Tit. 2.3. To serve men, denotes an obedience to
their prescriptions in opposition to the Commands of God; 1 Cor. 7.23.25. Gal.
5.1. and 4.9. with Acts 15.10. which two last Texts respect the legal
Ceremonies, and hence that Phrase is taken, Romans 8.15. Spirit of Bondage, to
which is opposed the Spirit of Adoption: the One denotes legal strictness and
terror, the other Evangelical Grace. See Heb. 12.18 etc.: See also Heb. 2.15.

Schoolmaster. Isa. 28.10. Precept upon precept.
The Law is called a Schoolmaster, because it taught the way to Christ, Gal.
3.24. There is a very fair Metaphor taken from a Schoolmasters Instruction,
Isa. 28.10. For Precept must be (or has been) upon precept, precept upon
precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little (was
added) As Rules and Precepts are given and inculcated into the minds of
Children, and their hands guided to write (as in the old Verse, Add parum
parvo, parvo superadde pusillum, i. e. Add little to little, and to little,
superadd very little) that at length they may acquire the whole treasure of
Learning; so, God by his Prophets (2 Chronicles. 36.15.) and Ministers instructs his
People in Divine learning, etc.

4. The Metaphors from a Country or Family are these;

Canaanite.
A Canaanite is put for a stranger or impure Person, Zach. 14. last verse, Isa.
35.8. Joel 3.22. For a Merchant, because their Country was near the Sea, Prove.
31.24. Isa. 2^^.8. Jer. 10.17. Hos. 12.8. Zeph. 1.11.

Arabian. Edomites Moabites
An Arabian is put for a Thief or Robber, because they were infamous that way,
Jer. 3.2. Isa. 13.20. the Edomites and Moabites are put for the Churches
Enemies, because they were such to the Jews (Psalm. 137.7. Lam. 4.21. Amos 1.11.
Obadiah ver. 10. Ezekiel. 25.12.) Isa. 34.5, 6. and 63.1. and 25.10. Chaldeans are
put for Mathematicians or Fortune Tellers, because that Nation was given to it.
Dan. 2.2. Sodom. Gomorrah.
etc. The Names of Sodom and Gomorrah are attributed to the Rebellious and
stubborn Jews, Isa. 1.10. See Isa. 3.9. Ezekiel. 16.48, 49, 53.

Rome, the seat of Antichrist, is called Sodom and Egypt, Rev. 11.8. Sodom,
because of its Corporal and Spiritual Whoredom, and other enormous sins; Egypt,
because of its Tyranny and Cruelty against the People of God.

Metaphors from the various Actions of Men.
SUch of the Actions of Men as we have not treated off before, shall be briefly
given -- These may be distinguished into such as are Necessary, and such as are
Contingent.

1. Necessary Actions, as [ to Eat and Drink] denotes, To Eat.

enjoyment is either Corporal, as Genesis 45.18. Psalm. 128.2. Esa. 1.19 and 3.10.
etc. Or Spiritual, Prove. 9.5. and 8.5, 6, 10. etc. Jer. 15.16. 1 Timothy 4.6.

2. It denotes a participation of the Merits and Blessings of Christ, John
6.50. etc. 1 Cor. 10.16.

3. The completing of Eternal Happiness, or Everlasting Life it self, Luke
14.15. and 22.30. John 6.27. Rev. 2.7. and 3.20. etc. To be filled,] that is
after Eating denotes any fullness, as when an old man is said to be (...) (Sept.
(...),) Full of Days, Genesis 25.8. and 35.29. See Hos. 13.6. Luke 6.25. 1 Cor.
4.8. It denotes a sufficient enjoyment of things pleasing and profitable, Psalm.
16.10. and 17.14. and 81.10. and 103.5. and 107.9. Matthew. 5.6. Luke 6.21.
Sometimes it denotes loathing, as a full Stomach does Meat, Psalm. 88.3. Hab.
2.16. Hence by an Anthropopathy it is attributed to God, Esa. 1.11.

To Hunger and Thirst] denotes an ardent desire in the Godly, after heavenly
things, Psalm, 42.2. and 63.1. Esa. 41.17. and 51. 1. Matthew. 5.6. Luke 6.21. and
1.53. In the wicked it denotes Eternal malediction for the want of those
blessings, Esa. 65.13. Luke 6.25. See Luke 16.24. and Amos 8.11.

[ To Drink] denotes the enjoyment of good and pleasant things, Jer. 2:18.
Victory, as Number. 23.24. See Prove. 5.15. Esa. 37.25. Participation of Heaven,
Prove. 9.5. Esa. 65.13. John 4.14. and 7.38. See Rev. 22.17. etc. To suffer
inconveniences, as Job 21.20* Jer. 25.16. and 49.12. Obad. 1.16. Hab. 2.16.
Prove. 20.6. Matthew. 20.22. and 26.39. etc. To be accustomed to a thing, Job
15.16. and 34.7. Rev. 18.3. Prove. 9.5.

To be Drunk] denotes to be filled with good things, Deuteronomy. 29.19. Psalm. 36.8,
9. Prove. 5.19. and 11.25. Cant. 5.1 Jer. 31.14. To be overwhelmed with
Calamities, Esa. 51.21. and 63.6. Jer. 48.26. Ezekiel. 23.33. To be obstinately
confirmed in impiety by the just Judgment of God, Esa. 29.9, 10. Hence sobriety
on the contrary, both of Body and mind, is attributed to a godly man, 1 Thessalonians.
5.6, 8.2 Tim. 4.5. and 2.26. 1 Pet. 1.13. and 4.7. and 5.8.

[ To Beget and bring forth] is put for the production or event of any thing,
Job. 38.28. Psalm. 90.2. Prove. 25.23. and 27.1. Zeph. 2.2. Jam. 1.15. Hence
Generations signify things done, or Histories, Genesis 2.4. and 5.1. and 37.2. It
is attributed to Spiritual renovation, Esa. 66.9. John 1.13. The Church being
as it were the Mother of Believers, Esa. 54.1. and 66.7, 8. Gal. 4.26, 27. To
the Ministers of the Gospel, 1 Cor. 4.15. Gal. 4.^^9. Philemon ver. 10. etc.
When a man is said to bring forth Wind, Stubble, Vanity, etc. it denotes the
ill success of his malignant endeavors, Job 15.35. Psalm. 7.14. Esa. 26.28. and
33.11. and 59.4.

Hitherto of the necessary Actions of men; Contingent actions.
now we shall briefly touch such as are contingent, which are good or bad; with
respect to the Agent or others.

What concerns Site or Local motion, as [ to Go or Walk,] is put for the Life,
Site or Local motion.
Manners, and Actions of Men, Genesis 17. 1. Psalm. 1.1. Psalm. 119.1, 3, 9. etc.
Romans 8.1. Ephesians 2.2, 10. etc. 2 Cor. 12.18. Hence a Way is put for the course of
Life or conduct of men, Genesis 18.19. and 31.35. Prove. 28.6. Jer. 6.16. Matthew.
21. 32. Act. 14.16. etc. To Go] signifies to die, Genesis 15.2. Josh. 2^^.14. Luke
22.22. etc. To Stay or Tarry] signifies to Live, John 21.22. Phil. 1.25. To

35.4. To Stand] signifies to be happy or in a good Condition, 1 Samuel 24.21.
Psalm. 30.7, 8. Dan. 11.2. Romans 14.4. To believe firmly and persevere, Exodus
14.13. Romans 5.2. and 11.20. 1 Cor. 10.12. and 16.13. 2 Cor: 1.24. Phil. 4.1.

It denotes perseverance in sin, Psalm. 1.1. Eccl. 8.3. Hos. 10.9. The
Confirmation or ratifying of a word or decree, Lev. 27.14. Deuteronomy. 9.5. and
19.15. Esa. 40.8. Jer. 44.28. 2 Cor. 13.1. etc.

[ To Sit] denotes to be quiet and steadfast, Genesis 49.24. Psalm. 113.9. Micah

Romans 13.12, 14. Ephesians. 4.24. Col. 3.9, 10. 1 Pet. 5.5.

There are many transient Actions of men used metaphorically of which take a
few examples instead of many, by which you may judge of the rest.

[ To Take] is put for to Learn or understand, Job 22.22. Prove. 1.3. etc. To
Build] ((...) banah) for getting of Children, Gen 16.2. Deuteronomy. 25.9. Ruth. 4.11.
To Restore, exalt or make prosperous, Job 22.23. Esa. 58.12. Jer. 12.16. and
31.4. Mal. 3.15. (to which [ to Destroy] is opposed, Jer. 42.10. etc.) To
Establish and Confirm, Psalm. 89.2. Matthew. 7.25. To inform by Doctrine and
example Romans 15.20. 1 Cor. 8.1. and 10.23. and 14.4, 17. Gal. 2.18. 1 Thessalonians.
5.11. Jude ver. 20. (Hence (...), Edification, is put for Information by Word
and Life, Romans 14.19. and 15.2. 1 Cor. 14.3, 5, 12. 2 Cor. 10.8. and 13.10.)
Thus is the Church Built, which is the House and City of God, Psalm. 51.18. and
102.14. Esa. 60.10. and 54.11, 12. Matthew. 16.18. 1 Cor. 3.9. Ephesians. 2.21, 22. and
4.12. 1 Pet. 2.5. Hence such as should preserve and restore the Church are
called Builders, Psalm. 118.22. Matthew. 21.42. Act. 4.11. 1 Pet. 2.7. To Build]
is also put for seducing by False Doctrine, 1 Cor. 8.10. etc.

[ To War, Fight, etc.] is put for the spiritual fight of Believers against the
Devil, the World and the Flesh, Esa. 40.2. 2 Cor. 10.4. Ephesians. 6.12. 1 Timothy 1.18.
2 Timothy 2.3, 4. and 4.7. Phil. 1.27. It Is said of such things as disagree amongst
themselves, as Flesh and Spirit, Romans 7.23. Jam. 4.1. 1 Pet. 2.21. Prayers are
spiritual weapons, Romans 15.30. Col. 4.12 etc. To Commit Adultery or play the
Whore] is put for Idolatry and Impiety of which there are abundance of examples
in Scripture, Exodus 34.15, 16. Deuteronomy. 31.16. Jude 2.17. and 8.27.33. 2 Kings
9.22. 1 Chronicles. 5.25. Esa. 1.21. and 57.3, 4. Jer. 2.20. and 3.1, 6, 8, 9. and
13.27. and 23.14. Ezekiel. 16.15, 2. and 23.3. Hos. 1.2. and 4.12. and 5.3. and
6.10. Nahum. 3.4. Rev. 2.20.21, 22. and 14.8. and 17.2. and 18.3. etc. The
Reason of the Metaphor is, because God has joined and as it were espoused his
Church to himself in a spiritual Contract or Covenant, that thereby he may
beget spiritual Children to be eternally saved. If the Church therefore will
basely forsake him, and run to Idols without any respect to the violation of
that Conjugal engagement, it is spiritual Adultery and the Scripture so styles
it, etc. To Bewitch] it put for to Seduce by wicked Doctrine, Gal. 3.1.

Apostates and such as persecute the Saints are said Heb. 6.6. To Crucify the
Son of God afresh. In which sense Rome, the seat of Antichrist is thus
described, Rev. 11.8. The great City which spiritually is called Sodom and
Egypt, where also our Lord was Crucified. Which Periphrasis denotes the cruel
persecution of true Christians, with all the oppression, and Massacres
perpetrated by Rome and its Instruments, where ever they have power to act. For
whatsoever injuries are offered to Believers, are by the Holy Spirit said to be
offered to Christ himself, because none of the Members can be hurt, but the
head sympathizes and suffers with it, as was said before. Homil. 11. in Jer.
Origin says, By every Martyrs condemnation, Jesus is condemned: For if a
Christian be condemned for this alone, that he is a Christian, it is Christ
then, that is condemned; (and so Crucified)

Metaphors taken from the Containing Subjects.
TO this belongs.

(1) Generally Place and its Dimensions. (2.) Particularly the Habitations of
Men.
To the Dimensions or differences of place belongs Altitude or height, which
when referred to the mind and understanding of man, metaphorically denotes an
abstruse thing, or that which is difficult to be understood, Prove. 24.7. Wisdom
is too high for a fool, that is, he cannot attain it. See Prove. 14.6. A Word
that has affinity with this denotes the distraction of an irresolute mind, by
reason of diverse cares and doubts Luke 12.29, (...). Be ye not lifted up on
high, we translate it, be ye not of a doubtful mind; this metaphor is taken
from Meteors, and denotes a mind as it were hung up in the Air, apt to be blown
hither by every blast; the meaning is, be not distracted with various cares for
your sustentation, but acquiesce in the hope of Divine help.

Genesis 43.18. We are brought in, that he may Roll himself upon us, and fall upon
us, Genesis 43.18.
and take us for bondmen. This is an elegant metaphor taken from the fall of a
Body from an high place or precipice, upon which Junius says, Metaphora duplex,
a corporibus magnae and ponderosae molis, etc. A double metaphor taken from
bodies of a great and weighty bulk, which by wheeling (as it were) are tumbled
down from on high, and the higher they are, by so much the more violence do
they fall: As if he had said, whereas he has no lawful cause of quarrel against
us, he will make us Captives, or Bondmen by this pretext of money, etc.

[ To go Backward] denotes Apostasy, Jer. 7.14. To turn their Hearts back
again, signifies Repentance, and their abhorring Baal whom they thought to be a
God, 1 King 18.37. See Esa. 50.5.

[ To turn to the Right Hand or Left Hand] Genesis 24.49. signifies a desire what
to do, or not to do; the metaphor being taken from such as are doubtful, when
they come to a parting way, which to take, and are wont to be directed by that
phrase, turn to the right or left hand.

This phrase is used with respect to Divine Obedience, when men are commanded
to walk neither to the Right nor Left hand, that is, to keep exactly to that
rule and order with respect to Gods Worship, which he has set down in his
Word, Deuteronomy. 5.32. -- 17.11, 20. -- 28.14. Josh. 1.7. -- 23.6. Prove. 4.27. Esa.
30.21. etc. The Right side is a symbol of prudence, circumspection, and
honesty; and the Left of imprudence, temerity, and incogitancy, Eccl. 10.2. etc.

[ Latitude or Largeness] gives some metaphors, (...) dilatare, to enlarge,
signifies a deliverance and help from Calamity, Psalm. 4.1. Psalm. 18.19. and
31.8, 9. Prove. 18.16. So Narrowness betokens Trouble and Affliction, Psalm.
25.16.17. -- 31.9. -- 138.6, 7. Prove. 11.8. -- 24.10. The Metaphor being taken
from narrow places, or men shut up, besieged, or surrounded by an enemy in a
narrow Compass, which exposes them to much distress and difficulties of
deliverance --. A heart enlarged signifies Joy, Psalm. 119.32. Isa. 60.5. See 2
Cor. 6.11, 12, 13. etc.

This enlarging of heart, denotes sometimes great wisdom and virtue, 1 Kings
4.29. Sometimes Pride and Audacity, Psalm. 101.4, 5. Prove. 21.4. and 28.25. See
1 Samuel 2.1. 2 Cor. 6.11. Ephesians. 6.19. Psalm. 81.10, 11. -- 119.131. etc.

Of Places where men Dwell we will show (1) Their parts. (2) Their species or
kinds. The Parts, from which Metaphors are taken are,

The parts of a Building. Christ a Foundation.
1. Foundation, in which we are to consider,

(1) Its Dignity, being the principal part of the Edifice, which supports the
whole weight of the building. Hence Christ is called a Foundation of the
Church, which is his spiritual house, Isa. 28.16. 1 Cor. 3.10.11. Ephesians. 2.20.
See Matthew. 16.16, 18. 1 Pet. 2.4, 5. Jude ver. 20. Rev. 21.14. because from
him, and by him, and in him are all things, which are needful for the
gathering, preserving, and saving of his Church

(2) Its stedfastness, stability and firmness; which makes the whole building
strong and durable. Hence it is said of the Creation of the Earth, that solid
and immovable body, together with its parts, Exodus 9.18. Job 38.4. Psalm. 24.1,
2. -- 104.5. Prove. 3.19. -- 8.29. Heb. 1.10. Hence it is put for the ground,
which we tread upon, Hab. 3.13. by making naked the foundation (so the Hebrew)
that is, by clearing your land of its Enemies, who so covered it, as if they
had taken a perpetual Root in it, ver. 6. More Metaphors you may find, Prove.
10.25. 2 Timothy 2.19. Joh. 6.27. Isa. 14.32. Ephesians. 3.18. Col. 1.23. It Is put for
to Consult or Deliberate, because every Design must have a beginning, Psalm.
2.2. -- 31.13, 14. and to appoint, decree or ordain, so as that a thing should
be firm and certain, 1 Chronicles. 9.21. Esther 1.8. Psalm. 8.2. Out of the mouths of
Babes and Sucklings have thou founded (so the Hebrew) strength, etc.

(3.) Its Order, because it is the first thing in a building, and the last in
the destroying of an House; Hence it is put for beginning, with respect to
time, Isa. 7.9. and for the very extreme or end in the destruction or utter
rooting out of the People, Psalm. 137.7.

[ A Wall] is transferred to a humane Body, Jer. 4.19. I am pained at the walls
of my heart (so the Hebrew) that is, my Bowels and sides which environ or
encompass my heart, in which places, such as are troubled with an hypocondriach
disease, are much pained, etc. Acts 23.3. Paul calls the Chief Priest whited
wall, that is, an Hypocrite and vain speaker, who bragged of the Dignity, and
title of his Office, whose outward Appearance was gaudy and splendid,
bespeaking much sanctity, whereas within he was full of Impiety and
Uncleanness. See Matthew. 23.27. It seems this kind of wall which he alludes to,
was made of Mud, that is a slight wall of untempered Mortar, as Ezekiel. 13.10.
which had no solid or durable substance in the inside, but were curiously
whited with Lime on the outside.

Ephesians. 2.14. (...) intergerinus paries, the middle wall of partition, denotes
the Mosaical Law, Ephesians. 2.14. Middle Wall.
which like a Partition divided the Jews from the Gentiles, which being now
taken away they are all one in Christ.

A Wall, in a Metaphor is a Symbol of strength and defense, 1 Samuel 25.16. Psalm.
18.29. Isa. 26.1. Jer. 1.18. and 15.20. A hedge denotes also Defense, Ezekiel.
13.5.22.30. Jer. 5.1. Psalm. 106.23, 30.

A Step or Stair,] or degree, (...), is put for increase of spiritual gifts, 1 Timothy 3.13. See Matthew. 13.12. a Pillar Metaphorically signifies things like it,
whether with respect to figure and shape, Exodus 13.21, 22. Judge. 20.40. Rev.
10.1. or use, for it is firm, and bears great Weight, and therefore denotes
firmness, constancy and lastingness, Prove. 9.1. Jer. 1.18. Job 9.6. and 26.11.
1 Timothy 3.5. Rev. 3.12. dignity and pre-eminence in the Church, Gal. 2.9. the
Commonwealth, Psalm. 75.4.

A Corner] denotes extremity, because it is the extreme part of the Building, as

1. The extremes of the earth, Exodus 27.9. Number. 34.3. Neh. 9.22. Jer. 9.26.
Deuteronomy. 32.26.

2. Of a field and Country, Lev. 19.19. Number. 24.17. where the Chaldee and
Septuagint understand Princes.

3. Of the head, as the Forehead and Temples, Lev. 13.41. and 19.27. The
outward Corner of a house, signifies a Prince or Grandee, Judges 20.2. 1 Samuel
14.38. Isa 19.13. Hence Christ is called a Cornerstone, Psalm. 118.22.
Expounded Ephesians. 2.15, 16, 17, 20.

A Nail, signifies one fixed for common good, Isa. 22.23. the Chaldee renders it
faithful governor, and the Septuagint (...), a Prince.

A Gate or Door] is put for a populous City, through which the passage of
traffic or Commerce is wont to be Ezekiel. 26.2. For the entrance into a Country,
Micah 5.5. For the Lips, Job. 41.5. See Psalm. 141.3. Psalm. 78.22, 23. Job 3.10.
What a door of hope denotes is shown before in the mention of the Valley of
Achor, Hos. 2.15. the opening of a door, denotes preaching the Gospel, Isa.
26.2. and 60.11. Acts 14.27. 1 Cor. 16.9. 2 Cor. 2.12. Col. 4.3. Rev. 3.8. The
door of heaven denotes the means of arriving to blessedness, Genesis 28.17. Matthew.
7.14. Luke 13.24. Christ calls himself a door, John 10.1, 2, 7, 9. because none
can get into heaven, or rightly into the Church but through him. See Metaphor
Door in the second Book.

Matthew. 23.14. The Pharisees are said to shut the Kingdom of heaven and
prohibit entrance therein, because they hindered men from looking after the
saving Graces of the Messiah, who is the only door of Salvation, and because
they depraved his holy word: To be at the door, denotes nearness of time,
Matthew. 24.33. Jam. 5.9. The Gates of Death, denote extreme peril, Job 38. Psalm.
9.13. and 107.18. Isa. 38.10. The Gates of Hell, Matthew. 16.18. denote the
Stratagems, Machinations, Plots, and power of the Devil and his Ministers, etc.
Believers are said to knock at the door, when they pray earnestly, Matthew. 7.7,
8. Luke 11.9. God is said to knock at the Door (of our heart) when he earnestly
invites men to Repentance, Rev. 3.20. etc.

Bars, which strengthen gates, 1 Samuel 23.7. are Metaphorically put for any kind
of Fortification or Strength, Job 38.10. Psalm. 147.13. Ezekiel. 30.18. Amos 1.5.
Isa. 15.5. and 43.14.

[ A Key] denotes Authority and Power, Isa. 22.22. Key.
It Is attributed to Christ with respect to Hell and Death, Rev. 1.18. and the
Church and Heaven, Rev. 3.7. which denotes Chief Dominion. The Keys of the
Kingdom of heaven, Matthew. 16.19. denote the Ministry and Office of the
Apostles, Joh. 20.23. in retaining sins (viz. excommunicating Scandalous
sinners) and remitting sins, (that is, receiving the penitent) set forth by the
Metaphors of a Key, which shuts or opens the door.

The Species of Buildings, are (1.) A City, which Metaphorically denotes the
Church Militant, Isa. 26.1. Heb. 12.22. See Matthew 5.14. Species of buildings.
The Church Triumphant, Heb. 11.10. and 13.14. Rev. 2.2. etc. See Phil. 3.20.
and 1.27. where heavenly conversation is expressed by a word derived of (...) a
City, as Civility is from Civis a Citizen, because their Conversation should be
civil, in opposition to the rudeness and barbarity of such as live in the
Country. It is said of a Fool, Eccl. 10.15. that he knows not how to go to the
City, that is, he cannot perfect what he undertook.

[ Strong Holds] or Munitions are elegantly used by the Apostle, Strong Holds
or Munitions.
2 Cor. 10.4. for all that which the Churches Enemies put their Confidence in,
as Carnal Wisdom, Learning, Eloquence, etc. Which those Divine Weapons pull
down, etc.

Towers sometimes denote Proud Tyrants, and worldly Grandees, Towers.
Isa. 2.15. and 30.25. Other significations of these, see before, chap. 8. and
in the Metaphorical Parallels, Book 2.

A House] denotes the Church Militant, Psa. 27.3, 4. -- 69.9. ( John 2.17. A
house.
) -- 84.4. -- 92.13. Isa. 56.5, 7. Ephesians. 2.19, 22. 1 Timothy 3.15. Heb. 3.6. and
10.21. 1 Pet. 25. and 4.17. Hence the Apostles are called (...), the
house-servants or Stewards of God, 1 Cor. 4.1. The Temple of Jerusalem is
frequently called the house of God, 2 Samuel 7.5, 6. Psalm 26.7, 8. -- 12.2. 1
Jer. 7.11. Math. 21.13. etc. The Church Triumphant and Eternal Life, is called
a House, Psalm. 36.8. John 14.2. 2 Cor. 5.1, 2. The Reason is, because

(1.) God lives there with the Blessed, as the Master of a Family with his
Domestics.

(2.) Because it is a most quiet and secure habitation.

(3.) Because of the perfect and clear vision of God.

(4.) With respect to the glorious Ornaments of his family; for the Grandees of
the World maintain their Families as splendidly as they can.

(5.) Because all the spiritual sons of God are gathered into this house, where
there is perfect harmony and Concord, etc.

Tabernacle.
A Tabernacle is almost of the same signification, and is put for the Church
Militant, Psalm. 15.1. -- 27.4, 5. -- 84.1. for the Church Triumphant, Luke
16.8. Rev. 21.3. The Tabernacle of David, Amos 9.11. Acts 15.16. denotes the
Kingdom and Church of the Messiah, etc.

The word Tabernacle is said of the Suns tarrying in heaven, Psalm. 19.4. and of
a humane Body, A Chamber.
2 Cor. 5.1, 4. 2 Pet. 1.14. because the Soul dwells in it, as its habitation
till death.

(...) cheder. this word signifies the inmost and most retired part of any
place. Judge. 15.1. -16.9. Cant. 3.4. Pagnin. Thesaur. Prison.
A Chamber or Inner Room] which the Latins calls Penetrale is attributed to
God, which is a symbol of that divine and intimate Communion which the Saints
enjoy with him, Cant. 1.4. See John. 14.2. where the many Mansions there, are
thus to be Metaphorically understood, viz. variety of heavenly Joys.

Chambers of the South, Job 9.9. and 37.9.] this denotes that part of Heaven
which is near the Antartick Pole, or Southern Axis, which being below our
horizon cannot be seen of us. See Prove. 24.4. and 18.8.

By Chambers of Death, Prove. 7.27. is denoted Damnation. The Chambers of the
People. Isa. 26.20. are temporal Death, or the Graves of the Godly, from which
at the last day there will be a Resurrection.

A Prison, and Imprisonment is most elegantly translated to Denote Gods
Vengeance against his Enemy, Isa. 24.21. And it shall come to pass in that day,
that the Lord shall visit (that is, take notice of) the host of every high one,
with him that is on high, and the Kings of the Earth, with their Land, (that
is, he will punish high and low, King and Subject) ver. 22. And they shall be
gathered together with the gathering of Prisoners into the Dungeon, and shall
be shut up in Prison (that is, they shall be held Captive by the power of God,
whatsoever they are that are his Adversaries, for this shutting up in Prison
denotes any kind of Punishment) and after many things they shall be wanting,
that is, they shall never be able to extol or lift themselves up more against
God. See 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. A freeing from prison, denotes divine Deliverance,
Psalm. 142.7.

A Ship.
A Ship, Isa. 33.21. denotes all the force of the Churches Enemies, Psalm. 48.7.
The breaking of the Ships of Tarshish, betokens (as many Interpreters say) the
confusion of those Enemies. See Isa. 2.16, 17. Besides this (...) to make
shipwreck of Faith, denotes Apostasy from the Faith, etc.

A Grave.
A Grave denotes the depraved Nature of man, Psalm. 5.9. Romans 3.13. Their throat
is an open sepulcher, the Metaphor being taken from the noisome scent of a
Grave, which is translated to the corrupt and wicked discourse of ill men. See
Matthew. 23.27, 28, etc. See also Isa. 14.11. Thy Pomp is brought down to the
Grave-, that is, none will honor thee, etc.

Metaphors from the various Adjuncts of Men.
THese may be Divided into Internal and External; of the Internal we have
before expounded Many; of the Externals, by which the various Utensils or
Instruments, etc. useful for humane Life are to be understood, we will here
treat briefly.

Arms are translated by a notable Emphasis to denote the spiritual fight or
struggling of a Pious Soul against Sin and Temptation; Arms or Armor.
Romans 6.19. -- 13.12. 2 Cor. 6.7. -- 10.4. 1 Pet. 4.1. Of Which the Apostle
treats most Elegantly, Ephesians. 6. upon which, see Mr. Gurnal, who has well
handled that Subject.

The Devil is said to be a strong man Armed, Luke 11.21. that is, well provided
with Craft, Guile, and Subtlety, to overreach and overcome a Soul.

A Sword denotes 1. A thing hurtful, because it is cutting, A Sword.
and so betokens most bitter Griefs, Psalm. 22.20. Luke 2.35. Hence it is said of
an ill-speaking and virulent Tongue, Psalm. 55.21. -- 57.4. -- 59.7. Job 5.15.
See Psalm. 64.3. etc. To put a knife to the Throat denotes extreme peril, Prove.
23.2.

2. It denotes a thing very penetrating, and efficacious, Psalm. 149.6. Micah
5.5. Ephesians. 6.17. It is said of the Word of God that it is sharper than a
two-edged sword, Heb. 4.12. Gladio ancipiti, (...), scindendo penetrabilius
esse, which denotes its piercing efficacy, to reach the heart, when set home by
the Spirit. See Isa. 49.2. Rev. 1.16. -- 2.12, 16. etc.

A Bow and Arrows] signify the same thing, that is, Bow and Arrows.
are put for an ill speaking and lying tongue, Psalm. 64.3. -- 120.4. Jer. 9.3.
An arrow flying by day] denotes any sudden or invading danger, Psalm. 91.5. how
attributed to God, we have shown in the Chapter of an Anthropopathy, page 71.

A Quiver] wherein arrows are kept is put for a Family wherein Children are
well educated; A Quiver.
Psalm. 127.5. (see ver. 3.4. and Psalm. 8.2. Matthew. 9.38. Isa. 41.16. Psalm.
45.5. Isa. 49.2.) the Chaldee renders it, It is good for that man that fills
his School with them.

A Shield] put for Princes, A Shield.
Psalm. 47.9. Hosea 4.18. who defend their Subjects as a Shield does the Body.
Paul calls the Word of God, the shield of Faith, Ephesians. 6.16. which quenches all
the fiery darts of the Wicked One, because when received in Faith, it defends
a Soul from all the Temptations of the Devil, which are as Darts, that would
obstruct its passage to heaven, see Gurnal as before. See 1 These. 5.8. etc.

Elisha and Elijah, are called the Chariots and the Horsemen of Israel,
Chariots and horsemen.
2 Kings 2.12. -- 13.14. that is, their principal strength, as Chariots and
horsemen are in War, etc.

A Staff] because it is the supporter of a weak or lame Man, A Staff.
denotes help and support, 2 Kings 18.21. Psalm. 18.18. Hence the Staff, of
Bread, Water, etc. is put for Meat and Drink by which the life of man is
Supported and Refreshed, Lev. 26.26. Psalm. 105.16. Isa. 3.1. Ezekiel. 5.16. -- 14
13. etc. Hence Bread is said to support (in our Version strengthen) the heart
of man, as a staff does the body; that is, comforts and refreshes him. Hence
also (...) fulcire, to prop, is put for eating 1 Kings 13.7. etc.

On the Contrary a staff is a symbol of Meanness and Poverty, as in the Prayer
of Jacob, Genesis 32.10. With my staff I passed over this Jordan, that is, weak
and poor, the Metaphor being taken from such as are taken Captives in War, and
despoiled of all their Arms, and are dismissed with a Staff.

Because a staff is an Instrument whereby men use to beat, It is put for
Tyranny, Cruelty and severe Government, Prove. 10.13. -- 22.8. -- 26.3. 2 Samuel
7.14. Psalm. 89.32. Isa. 10.5.24. -- 14.5.

A [ Prize] is put for the Reward of the Godly; the metaphor being taken from
such as win a race, A Prize.
or overcome any challenger or adversary that contended with them at any
exercise, 1 Cor. 9.24. Phil. 3.14. For the exercise of Faith and Piety is
compared to a Race or Strife, 1 Cor. 9.24, 25, 26. Gal. 5.7. Heb. 12.1. etc.

Col. 2.18. (...), signifies to defraud of that Reward -- the metaphor is taken
from the Custom of Heathens, who in their Games and public Exercises of
wrestling and the like, had some that used to sit as Vmpires to give to them,
that did best, the Reward of a Garland or Crown, or some such thing, yet were
sometimes unjust, and defrauded by some corrupt dealing, those that really won
the prize. The sense is, that they should not trust the Judgment of Divine
matters, and the Mysteries of Gods Law with respect to Worship to the Folly of
humane Reason, and the Comments of Will Worshippers, lest they should lose
Truth, and consequently the prize of Eternal Salvation, Col. 3.15.

The [White Stone] Rev. 2.17. is a symbol of Heavenly glory, To him that
overcomes will I give a White Stone, and in the Stone, a new Name written,
etc. The Metaphor (as some conjecture) is taken from an ancient Custom, that a
White Stone was given to an acquitted person that was accused and tried; and a
Black one, to guilty and condemned, according to that of Ovid. 15. Metam. Mos
erat Antiquis, niveis; atrisque lapillis,
His damnare Reos, illis absolvere culpae, etc.
The Custom was, by White and Black small Stones,
TO Acquit the Guiltless; and Dam'n guilty ones.
The writing of a new Name in the White Stone, is said by Interpreters to
denote, not only a freedom from condemnation, but also an adorning with
heavenly Glory; 1 John 3.2. Others say that it is a symbol of Victory, etc.

[ A Cup] (...) because the guests drink out of it ( Jer. 16.7. Luke 22.17.)
and because it holds sometimes bitter liquor, sometimes sweet, metaphorically
denotes sometimes a prosperous and happy condition, as Psalm. 16.5. -- 23.5. and
116.13. Sometimes Punishment and Affliction, Psalm. 11.6. and 75.8. Esa. 51.17,
22. Lam. 4.21. Jer. 25.15. and 51.7. Ezekiel. 23.33, 34. Matthew. 20.22, 23. and
26.39, 42. etc.

Col 2.14. Hand Writing. (...).
[A Hand Writing] commonly called a Bond, Col. 2.14. is put for an obligation,
or that guilt that sinners incurred by sinning; the cancelling of which and
fixing it upon the Cross, is the full or plenary satisfaction for sin made by
Christ, and applied to the soul by true Faith, upon which see Erasmus in his
paraphrase, who does excellently expound it.

A Crown
A [ Crown] That peculiar and principal Ornament of the head in general, denotes
any beautiful or very pleasing Ornament or profitable thing, Prove. 4.9. and
17.6. Jer. 13.18. Phil. 4.1. 1 Thessalonians. 2.19. Hence to Crown is put for to adorn,
bless with good things, and so to make joyful, Psalm. 8.5. and 103.4. See Psalm.
65.11. Esa. 23.8. Tire is called the Crowning (City) that is, a place that made
its Inhabibitants great and Wealthy; for it is added, whose Merchants are
Princes, whose Traffiquers are the honorable of the Earth.

2. A Crown is the symbol of an Empire or a Kingdom, hence the Kingdom of
Israel is called a Crown of Pride, Esa. 28.1. (See Hos. 5.5. and 7.10.) viz. a
most proud Kingdom -- More Examples are to be read, Psalm. 21.3. and 89.39. Lam.
5.16. Ezekiel. 21.26. But this rather belongs to a Metonymie of the sign. But it is
metaphorically, when Crowning is attributed to Christ the heavenly King, Zach.
6.11, 12, 13, 14. Psalm. 8.5. Heb. 2.7, 9. etc.

3. It denotes heavenly Reward or Eternal Life, 1 Cor. 9.25. 2 Timothy 2.5. and
4.8. Jam. 1.12. 1 Pet. 5.4. Rev. 2.10. and 3.11. etc.

[ Riches] (...), is put for plenty of heavenly things, and the spiritual gifts
received through Christ, Riches.
Luke 12.21. 1 Cor. 1.5. 2 Cor. 6.10. and 8.9. Heb. 10.34. and 11.26. Col. 2.2.
Jam. 2.5. Rev. 3 18. See Esa. 53.9. Serious piety, 2 Cor. 8.2. and 9.11. 1 Timothy
6.18. The Conversion of the Gentiles, Romans 11.12.

[ Treasure] denotes plenty of heavenly good, Esa. 33.6. Matthew. 6.20. etc.
which is called (...), the Inheritance of Believers, Inheritance:
Acts 20.32. Ephesians. 1.14, 18. Col. 3.24. Heb. 9.15. 1 Pet. 1.4. And Believers
themselves are called Heirs and Coheirs with Christ, Romans 8.17. Gal. 4.7. Tit.
3.7. Heb. 6.17. Jam. 2.5. 1 Pet. 3.7. Hence the phrase to inherit the Kingdom
of heaven, Matthew. 19.29. -- 25.34. and sundry other places; the metaphor is
taken from the Jewish Inheritances, which were kept very sacredly and strictly
by the Possessors, and left to their posterity, as appears by that Heroic
speech of Naboth, 2 Kings 21.3. who refused to exchange his Vineyard for a
better, etc.

To Riches, Treasures, etc. are opposed poverty and begging, which denote the
want of spiritual good things, Rev. 3.17. Sometimes Repentance and Contrition,
with a desire after them, Matthew. 5.3. and 11.5. Luke 4.18. and 6.20. etc.

A [ Debt] denotes sin, Matthew. 6.12. (See Luke 11.4. Debt.
) Luke 13.4. because we become thereby obnoxious to the wrath of God as a
Debtor does to the Arrest and Suit of his Creditor. See the Parables, Matthew.
5.26. and 18.23. etc. Luke 7.41, 42, 47. and the appellation of a Bond, Col.
2.14. of which before.

A [ Whip] Metaphorically denotes Affliction, Calamity and Loss, Whip.
1 Kings 12.11, 14. Josh. 23.13. Job 5.21. and 9.23. Esa. 10.25. and 28.18.
Mark 3.10. and 5.29.34. Luke 7.21. Heb. 12.6. etc.

The [ Hammer] of the whole Earth, Hammer.
is a metaphorical Epithet of the Babylonian Monarch, Jer. 50.23. because God
(as if it were with a great Hammer) made use of him at that time to break in
pieces the Kingdoms of the whole World. See Jer. 23.29. and 51.20.

A [ Table] denotes heavenly good things, Psalm. 23.5. -- 69.22. Prove. 9.2. Romans
11.9.

A [ Measure] (...), metron, has 3 metaphorical significations.

1. Because it contains part of an entire heap or parcel, Measure.
it is put for that portion or proportion of the gifts of the Spirit which
Beleivers have, Romans 12.3. Ephesians. 4.7, 16. Thus it is said of Christ, John 3.34.
That God gives not the Spirit by Measure unto him, on which lib. de Trinit. f.
630.
Tertullian most elegantly, Spiritus sanctus habitat in Christo plenus and
totus, nec in aliqua Mensura, aut portione Mutilatus, sed cum tota sua
redundantia cumulate admissus, ut ex illo delibationem quandam gratiarum
caeteri consequi possint, totius sancti spiritus, in Christo, font remanente,
ut ex illo donorum atque operum venae ducerentur, spiritu sancto in Christo
affluenter habitante. That is, The Holy Spirit dwells fully and entirely in
Christ only, neither is it in any Measure or portion maimed (or defective) but
with his whole redundancy entirely or absolutely admitted, that others may
receive the Communications of Graces from him, the whole spring or fountain of
the spirit remaining in Christ, that the Veins of gifts and works may convey
influence from him, the Holy Spirit dwelling most abundantly in him.

2. In regard a Measure is filled, when a thing is sold, it is put for a large
remuneration of benefits (Luke 6.38.) or blessings. As also the abundance or
termination of evil and wickedness, Matthew. 23.32. (with 1 Thessalonians. 2.16.) fill ye
up then the Measure of your Fathers, viz. of the sins of your Fathers, as
Erasmus paraphrases it, go on, imitate your Ancestors, and what they wanted of
extreme cruelty, do ye make it up; they killed the Prophets, and you him, by
whom, and of whom they Prophesied. The highest pitch of villainy is noted by
this phrase, beyond which there is no further progress, and makes ripe for
Divine Vengeance, and severest punishment, which certainly follows it, as
payment follows things fully measured and sold. See the examples of the
Amorites, Genesis 15.16. Of the Sodomites, Genesis 18.20. etc. Of the Amalekites,
Exodus 17.14. 1 Samuel 15.2. etc.

3. Because there is a mutual equality and proportion, in giving and restoring,
therefore it is metaphorically said in a Proverb, with what measure ye mete, it
shall be measured to you again, which we find three times, with a different or
diverse scope.

(1.) Denoting just Retaliation, either with respect to reward or punishment,
Matthew. 7.2. Luke 6.38. Relating to our Neighbor.

(2.) A legitimate and saving handling of the Word of God, Mark 4.24. As
Euthymius says, as ye attend the Word, so ye shall profit in knowledge. Or,

(3.) As Piscator says, If ye communicate the word of God liberally, God will
communicate the knowledge of his Divine Mysteries more liberally to you, and
augment your Gifts, etc. For this heavenly Talent is improved and multiplied by
communicating it to others.

Razor.
A [ Razor] which shaves off hair, is put for the King of Assyria, Esa 7.2O.
Denoting that God would permit him to destroy Israel. It Is called (hired) with
respect to the fact of Ahaz, who hired the King of Assyria to assist him
against the King of Syria, 2 Kings 16.7, 8. Moab is call a wash pot by David,
Psalm. ^^0.9. denoting the baseness of those people, and that they were only fit
for the vilest Offices, 2 Samuel 8.2.

A [ Burthen] denotes things troublesome and difficult, Exodus 6.6. Psalm. 55.22.
Esa. 9.4. and 10.27. -- 14.25. Matthew. 23.4. etc.

Weight.
Weight (...)*] signifies the greatness of heavenly glory, 2 Cor. 4.17.
frequently, Trouble and Misfortune, Matthew. 10.12. Acts 15.28. Gal. 6.2. 1 Thessalonians. 2.6. Rev. 2.24. See Prove. 27.3. Sin is called heavy Heb. 12.1. because
it is an impediment in our heavenly race or course to heaven.

-- Of a Seal we have treated before.

A [ Looking glass] denotes an imperfect knowledge of the Mysteries of God in
this Life, Looking-glass.
1 Cor. 13.12. because it gives but an imperfect reflection of the figure or
object, compared to the object it self. And because some Looking-glasses
reflect the rays or beams of the Sun when it shines on them to an object. The
Apostle elegantly says, (...). signifies to contemplate on^^s shape in a
Looking-glass. Aret. Spoils. Stipend. Table.
uses the Verb ((...),) Beholding in a Glass for the light of Divine knowledge,
2 Cor. 3.18. But we with open face, beholding as in a Glass the glory of the
Lord, are changed into the same Image (that is, are eminently illuminated, and
communicate light to others) from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.

[ Spoils taken from an Enemy,] denotes Christ's Victory over Satan, Esa. 53.12.
Luke 11.22. Col. 2.15. a man's life is said to be to him for a prey, which
denotes deliverance from present Death, as he that takes a booty exposes his
life to Danger, Jer. 21.9. and 38.2. and 39.18. and 45.5. Stipend or wages
given to a Soldier] is attributed to Sin, Romans 6.23. whose due wages is death
Eternal. A Table] is attributed to the heart, when it is fixed upon any thing,
Prove. 3.3. Jer. 17.1. A Cover or Covering denotes ignorance, Cover.
because if a thing be covered we cannot see it, Esa. 25.7. 2 Cor. 3.14, 15,
16. Lam. 3.65. Sheath. Vessel.
A Sheath or Scabbard is put for the body because the Soul lodges there as a
Sword in a Sheath, Dan. 7.15. A Vessel is put for a man's body, 1 Samuel 21.5. 1 Thessalonians. 4.4. Paul calls himself and his Colleagues Earthen Vessels, 2 Cor. 4.7.
because of the Contempt, Calamities and Hazards that they were exposed to in
the World; as Earthen Vessels are more despised and more obnoxious to be broken
than such as are made of Silver and Gold, 1 Pet. 3.7. Peter calls a Woman the
weaker Vessel, because more subject to weaknesses and infirmities than men.
Paul is called a chosen Vessel by Christ, Acts 9.15. that is, a most choice and
excellent instrument whom he would use to Convert the Gentiles. Vessels of
Grace or Honor are such as are saved by Grace; and Vessels of Wrath and
Dishonor, such as rejected and damned for their Infidelity and Contempt of the
Messiah, Romans 9.21, 22, 23. See 2 Timothy 2.20, 21. Where there is an express
comparison. See Esa. 22.8. etc.

A [ Garment] which covers the body, defends and adorns it, yields a double
Metaphor.

1. It denotes Salvation by the application and appropriation of the great
benefits of Christ as well in this life as in that which is to come, Psalm.
45.8.13, 14. Esa. 61 10. Rev. 3.18. and 7.14. and 16.15. The reason of the
Comparison is excellent.

(1.) From the hiding of indecen^^ nakedness, of which Psalm. 32 1. Romans 4.6, 7.

(2.) Because thereby the body is defended from Cold, and other noxious things,
Matthew. 2^^.12. Romans 8.30. etc.

(3) Because it adorns and beautifies, Psalm. 110.3. etc. See the Parables,
Ezekiel. 16.10. etc. Math. 22.11.12. Luke 15.22. The Typical Visions, Zach. 3.3.
etc. Rev. 7.13, 14. and 19.8. and 21 2. The Typical Actions, Genesis 3.21. and
24.52. The Putting on and constant keeping, of this spiritual Garment is,
primarily by Faith in Christ, Romans 13.14. Gal. 3.26, and 27. And consequently,
by the Renovation of Holy Spirit, and the Conversation of a Holy Life, Romans
13.12. Ephesians. 4.24. Col. 3.10, 12. 1 Pet. 3 3, 4. Contrary to this is the Garment
spotted with the Flesh, Jude ver. 23. The defiling of Garments, Rev. 3.4. which
is the old man, Ephesians. 4.22. Col. 3.8. See Esa. 59.5, 6. etc.

2. With respect to outward Conversation, Matthew. 7.15. Sheeps Clothing.
Sheeps Clothing is attributed to the False Prophets and False Teachers in the
Church, Matthew. 7.15. Which denotes any outward things which are specious, and
made use of craftily to acquire authority and popular favor, as when men make
use of a dissembling personated, or hypocritical sanctity, as a Cloak to
inveagle and deceive others -- When they pretend to be called of God, Jer.
23.25, 30. 1 Kings 13.18. Matthew. 7.22. When they make a flourish about the
knowledge of Tongues, Universal Learning, great Eloquence, and other acquired
Ornaments, Romans 16.18. 1 Cor. 13.1, 2. and gifts especially the working of
Miracles whether truly done, or by mere Imposture, Deuteronomy. 13.2. Matthew. 7.22. 2 Thessalonians. 2.9. See 1 Timothy 4.1, 2, 3. 2 Timothy 3.5.6. Col. 2.18. To this Sheeps
Clothing is fitly opposed A Wolfish mind denoting,

(1.) The quality of their Doctrine, viz. it was damning, and a Wolf is a
destroyer of Sheep.

(2.) Their bloody principles, that would cruelly Lord it, and Tyrannize over
men's Consciences, etc.

Matthew. 11.8. A man Clothed in soft Raiment, that is, Matthew. 11.8. A man
clothed in soft Raiment.
one given to pleasures as appears Luke 7.25. and withal a Court Flatterer, who
either approves of, or at least connives at, the sins or Debaucheries of
Grandees, and if he admonishes, does it in fawning flattering expressions, with
all his artifice of extenuation -- Christ says, that John is no such person,
but was very remote from the pleasures of the flesh, living by a slender and
course Diet, Matthew. 3.4. and 11.18. and was no Flatterer, as appears by his
reproof of Herod for his Incest, Luke 3.19.

[ Bonds and Ropes or Cords] are metaphorically symbols of Oppression, Bonds.
Calamity and Punishment, Psalm. 18.5, 6. 116.3. Prove. 5.22. Esa. 28.22. and
49.9. and 52.2. and 58.6. Nahum. 1.13. It denotes also a Covenant obedience and
obligation prescribed by the Law, Psalm. 2.3. Jer. 2.20. Ezekiel. 20.37. God is
said to lay bonds upon the prophet, Ezekiel. chap. 4. ver. 8. when he obliges him
to a constant perseverance in his Prophecy. See Ezekiel. 3.15. Charity is called
the Bond of perfection, Col. 3.14. by which is not meant that it makes us
perfect in the sight of God, Col. 3.14. Charity the Bond of perfection.
but that the faithful are so joined together by love, as members of the same
body which have a perfect harmony, sympathy and concord toward each other. The
same is called the Bond of peace, Ephesians. 4.3. See Zach. 9.12. Acts 20.22. Cords
of Iniquity or Bonds of Iniquity. Esa. 5.18. Acts 8.23. denote the conspiracy
of the wicked and the spiritual Captivity of sin.

[ A Rod] denotes any Castigation or correction, A Rod.
Job 21.9. Esa. 9.4. 1 Cor. 4.21. See Staff for the Hebrew (...)
word properly signifies both. See also chap. 7. toward the End.

CHAP. XIII. Of Metaphors taken from Sacred Persons and Things, and whatsoever
Relates to Divine Worship.
THese may be Reduced to three heads.

(1.) Men. (2.) Places. (3.) Customs, Rites or Ceremonies.
Of which in Order.

Metaphors from Men Sacred to God.
MEn that belong to this are either Singular, or Conjunct, viz. The whole
people. Single or singular as David a man according to Gods own heart, who is
put for the Messiah, Esa. 55.3. I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you,
the most sure Mercies of David. R. Kimchi, clearly asserts, that the Messiah is
to be understood here, and it evidently appears from ver. 4. Some understand by
the Mercies of David, (...) David Amabilis, amicus, a (...) dilectus amicus,
amator.
the blessings that God promised David, viz. That the Messiah and Savior of
the World should be born of his Race; which is the same thing in effect with
the former explication. This Text is applied to the Resurrection of Christ,
Acts 13.34.

The Name of David and some of his attributes are ascribed to the Messiah,
Psalm. 132.10. Jer. 30.9. Ezekiel. 34.23, 24. and 37.24, 25. Hos. 3.5. The Kingdom
of David Typifi'd the Kingdom of the Messiah, Esa. 9.7. Luke 1.32, 33. See Esa.
11.1. 2 Samuel 2.12, 13, 14. ( Heb. 1.5.) Psalm. 89.20, 27. ( Col. 1.15.) Amos
9.11. ( Acts 15.16.) Psalm. 18.50. ( Romans 15.9.) Hence the Royal Seat of David,
Sion and Jerusalem were Types of the Church of Christ, Psalm. 2.6. Esa. 2.2, 3.
etc.

Solomon
That the Name of Solomon (the Son of David) is attributed to the Messiah,
plainly appears from Cant. 3.11. So in a certain and Mystical sense the promise
made to David, 2 Samuel 7. and 1 Chronicles. 17. is understood.

Zerubbabel the Son of Shealtiel was also put for Christ, Haggai 2.23. as
Interpreters show, because Christ came of his race, Matthew. 1.12, 16. And
because he was the Captain of the Jews, Haggai. 2.22. as Christ is the Prince
and Captain of his People. Zerubbabel.
As he brought the people out of the Babylonish Captivity:, So Christ has
freed his people from the Devils Captivity, etc. Zerubbabel sounds as if it
were (...) that is, the great, or Master of Babylon, or as others say, qui a
(...) dispersit and (...) Babel.
dispersit Babylonem, who has scattered Babylon; which name may be properly
attributed to Christ who has conquered the spiritual Kingdom of Babylon, (viz.
of the Devil the World, and Antichrist.) Shealtiel, is derived of (...) petiit,
he sought; and (...) God, so Christ is passively; for he receives the Petitions
of all the Godly, who by Prayer seek God, and by his Merits renders them
efficacious.

John the Baptist is called Elias the Prophet, Elias.
Mal. 4.5. as Christ himself Expounds it; Matthew. 11.14. and 17.11, 12, 13.

Christ is called the Church, which relates to a Metonymie of the Subject; as
Chap. 3. Sect. 3. There is a Metaphor taken from the Conception of Christ, to
denote that the Restoration of his Church, and the Renovation of Men's hearts
is only through him, Gal. 4.19. See Romans 6.4, 5, 6. Gal. 2.20. Col. 2.12. See
also Col. 2.14. To Crucify the flesh, Gal. 5.24. denotes a subduing of its
depraved lusts, which is painful and unpleasing, as if they were set upon a
Cross. Paul says, he was Crucified to the World, and the World to him, Gal.
6.14. that is, Gal. 6.14. Luther in Comment. h. l.
he judged the world Condemned, and the world had no better opinion of him; he
execrated the actings of the unconverted world, and they likewise hated his
Doctrine, calling him pestilent fellow, so that there was no concord between
him and the false deluding pleasures of the World. See Matthew. 10.38. -- 16.24.
Mark 8.34. -- 10.21. Luke 9.23. and 14.27. John 19.17. Gal. 6.12. Where the
cross is put for the afflictions or sufferings of Believers, whereby their
Faith is tried, and their Conformity to Christ is denoted, etc.

The People of Israel and Juda are frequently put for the New Testament Church;
See Genesis 22.17. Jer. 23.6. -- 30.10. -- 33.14, 16. Ezekiel. 37.23, 28. Luke 1.33.
Romans 4.13, 17. Gal. 4.28.31. 1 Pet. 2.9. etc. The reason is, because of the Old
Covenant made with them, which Typified the Kingdom of the Messiah.

Metaphors taken from Places sacred to God.
THE Land of Canaan, Canaan.
where the Israelites dwelt because of its fruitfulness and the peaceable state
of things there is frequently put for the Church; Isa. 26.1. -- 35.1, 2. --
57.13. -- 60.13. -- 65.9, 10. Ezekiel. 37.25. Joel 3.23. Amos 9.13, 14, 15. Micah
4.4. Zach. 3.10.

Jerusalem, the Metropolis of Judaea metaphorically denotes the Church of
Christ, Jerusalem.
because God peculiarly revealed himself in that City, and gave promises of the
Messiah there, Isa. 4.3. -- 40.2, 9. -- 52.1, 2. Zach. 9.9. -- 12.2. Gal. 4.26.
Heb. 12.22.

Sion] was a Hill in Jerusalem upon which stood David's Royal Palace, Sion.
and is by way of Eminency ((...)) sometimes called the Mountain of the Lord,
the holy hill, etc. Is proposed Metaphorically as a Symbol of the New Testament
Church, Psalm. 2.6. -- 68, 15, 16. -- 87.1, 2, 5. -- 132.13, 14. Isa. 4.4, 5. --
11.9. -- 28.16. -- 40.9. -- 49.14. -- 56.7. -- 59.20. -- 62.11. -- 65.25. Zach.
9.9. Heb. 12.22.

2. It denotes the Church Triumphant in Heaven, Psalm. 15.1. -- 24.3. Isa.
35.10. -- 51.11. etc.

The Magnificent Temple Built by Solomon in Jerusalem is frequently called the
house and habitation of God, and is Metaphorically put for the heaven of Gods
Glory, Temple.
Psalm. 11.4. Micah 1.2. For the Church, Psalm. 26.8. -- 27.4. -- 29.9. -- 48.9.
-- 84.1, 2, 4. Isa. 56.7. Ephesians. 2.21. 1 Cor. 3.16, 17. -- 6.19. 2 Cor. 6.16.
Heb. 3.6. and 10.21. God is said to be the Temple of the Elect, Rev. 21.22. (of
which see Chap. 8. before) Rev. 11.19.

A Temple is put for the body of Christ, John 2.19. In unity with the (...) the
Word, for in him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead Bodily, Col. 2.9. that
is, most truly, perfectly and unchangeably, not Typically or in a shadow, as in
the Temple of Jerusalem, etc. See Heb. 9.11. -- 10.19, 20. -- 8.2. -- 9.24. and
6.19.20.

An Altar] is used to denote the whole Mystery of Christ the Mediator, Heb.
13.10. 1 Cor. 10.18. and 9.13. Sometimes Divine Worship in the New Testament,
Isa. 19.19. the similitude being borrowed from the ancient Rites, etc.

(...).
Christ is called Propitiation (hilasterion) Romans 3.25. because he became the
great Sacrifice that satisfied for our sins. He is also called (...),
(hilasmos) Atonement, with respect to the Type to which the Apostle alludes --,
1 John 2.2. etc.

The Church is called the Pillar and stay of Truth, 1 Timothy 3.15. Some think
that this Metaphor is taken from the two Pillars which were set up in Solomon's
Temple, 1 Kings 7.21. 2 Chronicles. 3.17. The Name of the one was (...) (Jachin) he
shall establish, and of the other (...) (Boaz) In it is strength. By which
Names doubtless this most wise King had respect to the Stability and firmness
of the Kingdom and Church of the Messiah, which names Paul expresses by the
word (...) stabilimentum, firmamentum, stabiliment, or firmament, adding a
Pillar in allusion to those Typical Pillars --. Hence in the same verse he
mentions the house of God, that is, the Temple, by which means the Church of
the living God.

1 Timothy 3.16. The Mystery of Godliness.
Verse 16. He says, without Controversy great is the mystery of Godliness --.
But what is that? the Description follows which alludes to the Temple of
Jerusalem; for,

1. In that Old Temple God appeared in a Cloud and thick darkness, 1 King.
8.10, 11, 12. Paul says of the Truth of the New Testament, that God is manifest
in the Flesh. Which illustrious Manifestation, was adumbrated or shadowed out,
by that obscure one.

2. In the old Temple the Propitiatory or Mercy-seat was placed upon the Ark of
the Covenant in the Holy of Holies. Of Christ, Paul says, that he is Justified
in Spirit; viz. when he was risen from the Dead and so declared himself the
true (hilasterion) atonement, having made satisfaction for the sins of the
world, and perfectly fulfilled the Divine Law (the Tables of which were
contained in the Ark of Covenant) Romans 4.25.

3. In the old Temple, there were Cherubims over the propitiatory or
Mercy-seat, 1 Kings 8.6, 7. Heb. 9.5. -- Of Christ, Paul says, that he was seen
of Angels, who were glorious and true Witnesses of his Resurrection and Glory,
Matthew. 28.2. etc. See 1 Pet. 1.12.

4. In the old Temple the Jews were taught the Doctrine of the Messiah, who was
to Come. -- Paul says of Christ, that he was preached unto the Gentiles (not to
the Jews alone) Believed on in the world (the sound of the Apostles went out
into all the Earth, Romans 10.18. and their Doctrine received by all true
Believers, Col. 1.5, 6.)

5. In the old Temple the visible appearance of God was not ordinary or
perpetual. But Paul says of Christ, having Manifested himself in the Earth,
that he was received up in Glory, as if he had said, he has withdrawn his
visible Presence from his Church, yet he is gloriously truly and invisibly (for
that is to be received up in glory, viz. at the right hand of the Father)
present with it to the end of the World, Matthew. 28.20. Ephesians. 1.20, 21, 22, 23,
etc.

But what means (...) of Truth?]

The Epithet [of Truth] expounded.
Answer. 1. Either that word must be expounded in the Concrete, that it should
be same with (...), true, and opposed to that which is Typical and Shadowy of
future realities or Antitypes as John 1.17. -- 6.32. -- 15.1. Heb. 8.2. and
9.24. Where the word is so taken. So in Acts 26.25. (...) words of Truth, that
is, true words: So Ephesians. 4.24. (...) holiness of truth, signifies true holiness.
Or

(2) The Word must be expounded in the abstract, to denote the Doctrine of
Saving Faith, as it is taken 2 These. 2.10, 13. 1 Timothy 2.4. and 6.5. 2 Timothy
2.18. Heb. 10.26. Jam. 1.18. etc. In which sense, this genitive (of Truth)
notes the efficient cause, by which the Church is made firm and steadfast, being
built upon Christ the true Rock; for the cause of its firmness, is the heavenly
Truth, or the word of Truth. See 1 Cor. 15.58. Acts 20.32. Romans 1.16. Col.
1.23. 2 These. 2.13. Joh. 17.17. 1 These. 5.23. Some expound this, of the
subjectum circaquod, the subject about which the Church is employed, viz. to
Confess, Publish, and Keep carefully, that heavenly Doctrine contained in the
Scriptures of Truth, etc.

Metaphors from Sacred Rites.
THese may be distinguished into two Classes.

First, Holy Rites ascribed to God as their immediate Agent or Actor. Secondly,
Holy Rites performed by Men according to Gods Command and Prescription.
To the first Class belongs the Visions and Dreams which God sent to men for
more secret information, as to the Patriarch Jacob, Genesis 28.12, 13.
Genesis 28.12, 13. viz. the Ladder set upon the Earth, The top of which reached
heaven, etc. which Vision our Savior applies to himself, and uses Metaphors
taken from, John 1.51. etc.

From the Divine prophecies, Dreams and Visions a Metaphor is taken Joel 2.28.
where the various gifts, and the clear light and Revelation of the Gospel to
the Evangelical Preachers is noted, as Act. 2.16, 17. where Peter quotes this
very Text of Joel, that Manna. Exodus 16. Number. 11. etc.
Bread sent from Heaven to refesh the People in the Desert is largely applied
by Christ to himself, John 6.31, 32, 33, etc. Rev. 2.17. etc.

The other kind of Sacred Rites we thus distinguish, (1.) Persons. (2.)
Actions. (3.) Times. Of Persons, one Directs, and is (as it were) the head of
the rest, who are inferior and ministering or serving.

The Director was the high Priest, the Eldest Son of the Posterity of Aaron,
having a constant prerogative in the Ecclesiastical Government, High Priest.
Exodus 28.1. etc. Hag. 1.1, 12. and 2.3. Zach. 3.1, 8. Whose Name and Office
is Mystically transferred to Christ. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, hence he is
so often called (...) high Priest, Heb. 2.17. -- 3.1. -- 4.14, 15. -- 5.5, 10.
-- 6.20. -- 7.26. -- 8.1. -- 9.11. and Great Priest, Heb. 10.21. (See Zach.
6.12, 13.) the Reason of the Comparison may be read at large in the Epistle.

The Appellation of Priests is attributed to Believers in Christ, Priest.
Psalm. 132.9, 16. 1 Pet. 2.5, 9. Rev. 1.6. -- 5.10. -- 20.6. because they
Sacrifice spiritually to him.

The Ministry of the Gospel is expressed by the Name of the Levites, Levites:
Isa. 66.21. Jer. 33.18, 21, 22.

Paul is said Romans 15.16. (...) sacra operari, vel sacerdotio fungi, to act the
Priesthood, whence the Papists infer that he said Mass, which is a ridiculous
and false conclusion; for he adds immediately the Gospel of God, so that the
term is Metaphorical and signifies the preaching of the Gospel, as ver. 19, 20.
Upon which Illyricus well says, Si non satis clare locutus fuisset Apostolus de
Metaphorico sacrificio praedicationis, omnino adversarii inde suam Missam
confirmare conati fuissent.
If the Apostle had not spoke so clearly of this Metaphorical Sacrifice of
Preaching, the Adversaries would by any Means from thence endeavor to confirm
their Mass, etc.

Secondly, Sacred Actions have either God, or Men immediately for their Object.
Of the first kind are Sacrifices offered to God according to his Word --. This
word Metaphorically denotes the whole Obedience, Passion and Death of Christ,
and so his satisfaction for the sins of the World, Ephesians. 5.2. Heb. 9.23, 26,
28. and 10.10, 12, 14. Of which the old sacrifices were Types and Shadows.

Then the whole worship of Christians is called a Sacrifice, Isa. 19.21. and
56.7. and 60.7. 1 Pet. 2.5. More particularly by the word Sacrifice is
expressed serious Contrition of heart, Psalm. 51.18, 19. Faith and Holiness,
Mal. 1.11. Romans 15.16. (See Romans 1.5.) Phil. 2.17. New Obedience and
Mortification of the Flesh, Romans 12.1. See Psalm. 4.5. Sacrifice the sacrifices
of Righteousness.

Devout Prayer is called a Sacrifice, Psalm. 141.2. Isa. 50.7. So is glorifying
of God, Psalm. 50.14. -- 107.22. Hos. 14.3. Heb. 13.15. Helping our Neighbor,
Phil. 4.18. Heb. 13.16. Martyrdom for the Truth, Phil. 2.17. 2 Timothy 4.6. Gods
vengeance on his Enemies, Isa. 36.6.

First Fruits.
[ The offering of first Fruits] mentioned, Lev. 23.9, 10. Numb. 15.20.21. Deuteronomy.
2^^.2. etc. yields some metaphors. 1 Cor. 15.20. It is said that Christ is
(...). The First Fruits of them that sleep, that is, of the Dead, that shall
rise again, ver. 23. For as a plentiful Harvest followed the offering of
First Fruits; so shall an universal Resurrection (in due season) succeed or
follow the Resurrection of Christ.


Some observe from Lev. 23.11. That the First Fruits were to be offered to the
Lord on the Morrow after the Sabbath, that is, our Christian Sabbath or
Lord's Day, (vulgarly after the custom of the Heathens called Sunday) and that
in that very year, wherein Christ suffered, the day of offering First fruits
fell on that day wherein our Lord rose from the Dead, so making an excellent
congruity with this allusive metaphor which Paul used.

2. Beleivers are said to be First fruits, ((...), Aparche) that is, selected
from the whole lump of mankind, and consecrated to himself into the Adoption of
the Sons of God; as the First fruits were separated from the rest of the
fruits, and consecrated to God. The glorified Saints in heaven are so called,
Rev. 14.4. Beleivers are said to have the first fruits of the spirit, Romans
8.23. For as the Israelites by the oblation of first Fruits, had hopes to
receive the remaining part in due season by the blessing of God: So Beleivers
by those gifts they receive in part, of the Holy Spirit, have hopes of a
fullness of Joy, and a full Harvest of Glory.

Some understand this of the Apostles only, who received the First Fruits of
the Spirit miraculously, Acts 2. But the former explication is more conformable
to the scope of the Text.

3. It is said of the Jews, Jer. 2.3. That they were the First Fruits of his
increase, that is, chosen out of, and before, all other people, of the World,
and consecrated to him. The metaphor is continued, All that devour him shall be
desolate, that is, because as any, that converted the sacred provision of
offerings to their own use, against Gods order were guilty, and punished, Lev.
5. so the People that would eat, that is, make Israel desolate, shall
themselves be destroyed.

Romans 11.16. If the First-fruit be holy, the lump is also Holy, and if the Root
be Holy, so are the Branches; that is, as the whole lump was holy according to
the Law, when the first fruits were offered, so whereas the Patriarchs and
Elders of the Jews were holy unto the Lord, or a people peculiarly separated
from all people to him, this prerogative shall not expire with respect to their
posterity, but these also shall enjoy the participation of heaven and
blessedness, provided they believe the Gospel and heartily embrace it, Neque
enim de spirituali, sed de legali sanctitate Apostolus loquitur Glass. Rhet.
sacra. p. 430. Circumcision.
Neither does the Apostle speak of a spiritual, but of a legal Holiness.

Sacred Actions of the latter kind, which have men immediately for their
Objects, (although primarily directed to the Worship of God) are these.

[ Circumcision] the peculiar Character of the people of God, is put for
Regeneration, called the Circumcision of the Heart, Deuteronomy, 10.16. and 30.6. Romans
2.28. Of which there is a fair Periphrasis, Col. 2.11. In whom also ye are
Circumcised, with the Circumcision; (...), made without hands, in putting off
the body of the sins of the Flesh, by the Circumcision of Christ, and ver. 12.
adjoyns baptism a principal medium of Renovation, etc.

As the Jews were metonymically called the Circumcision, of which we have spoke
in the chapt. of that Trope, so Christians are metaphorically so called, Phil.
3.3. And the profane and wicked are called the Uncircumcision, Lev. 26.41.
Esa. 52.1. Jer. 4.4. And 6.10. And 9.26. Ezekiel 44.9. Acts 7.51. Col. 2.13.

Moses is said to be of uncircumsed Lips, Exodus 6.12.30. that is, dull of
speech or not Eloquent -- Of the Circumcising of Trees we have treated before.

[ Sprinkling] upon the people either by Blood, Sprinkling.
as Exodus 24.8. and 29.21. Lev. 14.7. etc. Or by water mixed with the ashes of a
red Heifer, Number. 19. Heb. 9.13. etc. Because it was a Type of Cleansing by
Christ from sin, is metaphorically put for it, Esa. 52.15. Heb. 10.2^^. and
12.24. 1 Pet. 1.2. In this are three things remarkable.

(1.) The Satisfaction and merit of Christ, called the blood of Sprinkling,
Heb. 12.4. compared Heb. 9.13, 14.

(2.) The Evangelical Word of Christ which (is as it were Hyssop, Psalm. 51.7.
which the Priest sprinkled upon unclean things as the Chaldee paraphrases it.
See the foregoing and following verses) is sprinkled (as it were) upon the soul
in order to its cleansing from sin. See Romans 16.25, 26. etc. Gal. 3 2, 5. etc.

(3.) True Faith, which is that very sprinkling of the blood of Christ by the
Holy Spirit, or the application of his Merits and satisfaction, therefore they
are joined together. Heb. 10.22.

[ Anointing or Unction,] because it was used to Kings, Anointing.
1 Samuel 10.1. and 16.13. 1 Kings 19.16. To the Chief or High Priest, Exodus
40.12. etc. And to Prophets, 1 Kings 19.16. Metaphorically denotes any that
have a singular call or Consecration to God, who are called (...) Anointed,
Psalm. 105.15. Esa. 45.1. And by way of excellency the Messiah ((...), Vnctus,)
our chief, Priest, King, and Prophet, blessed for ever, is so called as the
word denotes, Dan. 9.24. Psalm. 2.2. John 1.42. And 4.25. Hence the name of the
anointed one, is commonly given him in the New Testament, Matthew. 1.16, 17. And
2.4. And 11.16. And 22.42. Luke 2.26. See also Psalm. 2.6. And 45.7, 8. Esa.
61.1. Dan. 9.25. Luke 4.18. Acts 10.38. Heb. 1.9. See Col. 2.9. And John 3.34,
35.

From our Lord Christ we are called Christians, because we believe in him. Acts
11.26. being made partakers of that Holy Anointing, (...), consortes.
Heb. 1.9. John 2.20. Hence made Kings and Priests, Rev. 1.6. See Esa. 61.3. 2
Cor. 1.21, 22. Romans 5.5. etc.

3. Holy Days and Times; Times. Sabbath.
] Of these the Sabbath is most eminent being a day of rest, the seventh in a
week, instituted by God upon the completing of his creating work, Genesis 2.3.
and most exactly to be observed by the people of Israel by the the Command of
God; this is metaphorically translated to express New Testament Worship, Esa.
56.4. and to denote the rest of eternal blessedness, Esa. 66.23. (where there
is mention also of a New Moon in the same sense, which was a Jewish Holy Day
likewise.) Hence it is said, Heb. 4.9. That there is a Sabbatism left for the
people of God.

From the Jewish [ Passover, Passover.
] to which the Days of unleavened bread were joined, the Apostle makes a fair
Allegorical exhortation, 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. Where Christ is called our Passover,
because he was sacrificed and slain for us, as the Paschal Lambs which were
Types of the Messiah, were slain in the Old Testament.

The Feast of Tabernacles] is put for the whole spiritual Worship of the Old
Testament, Zach. 1^^.16, 18, 19. The feast of Tabernacles.
All Christians while they sojourn as Strangers and Pilgrims in this world, do
celebrate a Feast of Tabernacles, whilst they long for the heavenly City to
which they hasten not with the feet of the body, but by the affection of the
Heart, and the progress of piety and good works. See Genesis 47.9. Psalm. 39.12.
Psalm. 119, 19. 2 Cor. 5.4, 6, 8. Heb. 11.13, 14. The words of Augustine are
memorable, Utere mundo, non te capiat Mundus. Quod intrasti, etc.
Use the World (says he) But let it not ensnare you, that thou have come into
it, art upon thy Journey out of it, and that thou did come to depart, not to
tarry is certain, thou art then upon a Journey, let this Life be thy Inn, use
money as a Traveller upon the Road does a Table, Cup, Pot, and Bed, that is, to
leave them not to tarry with them.

So much of Old Testament Rites, those of the New Testament are two, Baptism,
Baptism.
and the Lords Supper. Baptism and to Baptize are metaphorically put. (1.) For
the miraculous effusion of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other
Believers in the primitive Church: To the Holy Spirit is sometimes added (Fire)
which is a symbol of its external manifestation, Acts 2.3. Matthew. 3.11. Mark
1.8. Luke 3.16. John 1.33. Acts 1.5. and 11.16 Some give a Reason of the
appellation from the Analogical Immersion, or dipping (for so (...), to Baptize
signifies) because the house, where the holy Spirit came upon the Apostles, was
so filled, that they were as it were drowned in it.

Others say that the reason of the appellation is, from the great plenty and
abundance of those gifts, as the Baptized were wont to be plunged or dipped in
water, or that they were wholly immerged in this. Likewise because by the
efficacy of the holy Spirit, they were cleansed from sin, refreshed and
purified, as water quenches thirst and washes away spots and filth, etc.

2. It is put for Calamities and Afflictions, especially those of Christ,
Matthew. 20.22.23. Mark 10.38, 39. Luke 12.50. The Reason of this metaphor is
likewise taken from multitude or abundance, as Calamities are elsewhere
compared to many and deep waters, Psalm. 18.16. and 32.6. and 69.1, 2. etc.

3. For the miraculous passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea, 1 Cor.
10.2. which was a Type of Gospel Baptism, etc.

The Supper.
From Bread (the other part of the Lords Supper) some think a metaphor is taken
1 Cor. 10.17. (...) quoniam unus panis, unum Corpus, multi sumus, which is word
for word (in English) thus, because one Bread, we being many are one body,
Putant Graeci nos etc.
in our Translation for being many and one Body: Upon which Erasmus in his
Annotations. The Greeks think that we understand that Bread which is the Body
of the Lord: Whereas all Christians are Members of Christ, as if he had
corrected what he before had spoke, (viz. we partake) for it is more to be one
and the same, than partaker. And in his Paraphrase, thus. We being all
partakers of the same Bread, do declare, that though we be many in Number, yet
in the consent (and harmony) of minds we are one Bread and one Body.

Others ( Glassius in Rhet. sacra. p. 434. says more truly) understand the word
Bread properly, and that there is an Ellipsis of the Verb substantive (is) in
this sense: There (is) one Bread (in the holy Supper:) So likewise we being
many are one body the Syriack clearly expresses it thus, As that Bread is
therefore one, so all we are one body: For we all receive of the self same
Bread -- For that sameness of Bread in the holy Supper, is to be understood
with respect to the Sacramental use of it, as well as the Identity of matter,
etc.

CHAP. XIV. Of a Synecdoche.
HAving largely gone through the most frequent and most eminent Tropes in the
Scripture, principally Metaphors, we will be more Concise in what follows, and
illustrate each, with a few Scripture Examples, by which the rest of chat kind
may be easily understood.

A Synecdoche is a Trope, by which the whole is put for part, or part for the
whole. And whereas the whole, is either the Genus or Entire thing; And part is
a Species, or Member: we will treat of the 4 kinds of Synecdoche's in order.

A Synecdoche of the Genus, is when the Genus is put for the Species, or an
Universal for a Particular, as when,

1. The Term (All) is put for the greatest part or many, as that Rule of Law in
the Pandects. quod Major. Omnes videntur facere, quod facit Major pars.
All seem to do that, which the greater part does. In doing this, there must be
great heed taken to the Scope and right meaning of the Text, take a few
Examples out of the Old Testament, Exodus 9.6. And All the Cattle of Egypt Died,
that is, all that is in the field, as ver. 3. and some were left as ver. 19.
Chap. 14.26, 28. and cap. 9.29. Exodus 32.3. All the People, that is the
greatest part, as ver. 26. Hence Paul uses a particular word, 1 Cor. 10.7. viz.
Some. See more Examples, Exodus 32.26. with ver. 29. and Deuteronomy. 33.9. Isa. 2.2,
3. Deuteronomy. 28.64. 2 Samuel 16.22. Hos. 7.4. etc. In the New Testament, Matthew. 3.5.
Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the Region about Jordan went to be baptized,
that is, many men of those places. More examples are Mark 9.23. Joh. 10.8. with
ver. 7. Acts 2.5. Ephesians. 1.11. Phil. 2.21. -- 4.13.

2. The word All or every, is put for the kinds of singulars as Genesis 2.16. Of
every tree of the garden thou shall eat, that is of every kind of fruit, Genesis
24.10. All the goods of his Master were in his hands, that is some of every
sort. See ver. 52, 53. so 2 Kings 8.9. Joel 2.8. with 1 Pet. 2.9. and Acts
2.17. Zeph. 2.14. Matthew. 4.23. Luke 11.42. Acts 10.12. Heb. 13.4.

An Universal Negative is also sometimes to be restrained and understood by a
particular Negative as Exodus 20.10. No work to be done on the Sabbath, that is
servile or Mechanic: as appears, Lev. 23.7, 8. Number. 28.18. See 1 Samuel 20.26.
with 1 Kings 19.11, 12. Jer. 8.6. Matthew. 5.34. Ye shall not swear at all, that
is rashly and lightly; Matthew. 10.26. Luke 7.28. John 1.31. -- 3.32, 33. --
15.5. -- 18.20. Acts 27.33. 2 These. 3.11. (Always) is put for (often) Luke
18.1. and 24.53. and ( every where) for (here and there) Matthew. 16.20. Acts
28.22. 1 Cor. 4.17.

Names of a larger signification are put for those which are of a narrower as
Flesh, is put for man, all flesh, that is every man, Genesis 6.12. Psalm. 145.21.

See Matthew. 16.28. and 26.28. Romans 5.18, 19. John 6.50.

1. Words of a narrower or more special signification are put for those of a
more large or universal signification. The word (...) vir, a man, is the
special attribute of the Male Sex, yet is put for any man or woman, Psalm. 1.1.
and 32.1. and 112.1. Jer. 17.5, 7. Joel 2.7, 8. etc. Fathers are put for

and David, Matthew. 1.1. etc. See Luke 19.9. etc.

2. A Proper Name is put for a common as Abraham and Israel for the Patriarchs,

illustrious species, for evidence sake; as,

(1.) In the Actions of men, Deuteronomy. 19.5. The Example of the Ax slipping from
the helve, and killing a man by chance, is put for any involuntary
manslaughter. See Psalm. 112.5. Prove. 20.10. Matthew. 5.22.

CHAP. XVI. Of a Synecdoche of the Whole. Synecdoche totius, seu Integri.

A Synecdoche of the whole is, when an Entire or Integer is put for a Member,
or the whole for any part. Which may be distinguished as they respect, (1.) A
Person or Men. (2.) Certain Things. (3.) Places. (4.) Times.

Jesus is put for his dead body, John 19.42. and 20.2.13. See ver. 12. and Luke
24.3.

Sometimes a thing is said of all, which yet concerns not some, as Matthew.
19.28. sitting upon twelve Thrones, belongs not to Judas Iscariot, who yet was
included because of the Number Twelve. It is said of the Church of Corinth,
That they were sanctified by faith in Christ Jesus, called Saints, enriched in
all utterance and knowledge, 1 Cor. 1.2, 5. when yet the following Chapters
evidence, that there were many Hypocrites and Notorious sinners among them, etc.

2. Part of a thing is put for the whole; Flesh is put for the skin, Psalm.
102.5. which text describes extreme leanness. (See Lam. 4.8.) Hence the common
Proverb is, he is but skin and bone.

49.10. etc. Exodus 21.6. He shall serve him for ever, that is, to the Year of
Jubilee, as the learned expound it. See 2 Samuel 12.10. Jer. 5.15. Dan. 2.4. O

(1.) In single men, the Essential parts are put for the whole man; as the Soul
((...)) Nephesh) for man, Genesis 12.5. and 14. and 17.14. Exodus 12.19. Lev. 2.1.
Psalm. 3.2. and 11.1. and 25.13. Isa. 58.5. Ezekiel. 18.4. Luke 6.9. Acts 2.41. and

CHAP. XVIII. Of a Catachresis.
HItherto we have expounded the Kinds of Tropes, now we are to treat briefly of
their Affections. Which are, Catachresis. Hyperbole, And an Allegory.
Which three words signify in English, Hardness. Boldness. And Continuation.


(...), Catachresis, is called in Latin Abusio, an abuse, not as if the Sacred
Scripture had abused any words, but because the things that are Catachrestical,
differ in some things from the Custom of speaking Tropically, and have a harder
utterance and coherence. The Style of Scripture is most Holy, and pure from any
blemish, or undecency, of which take a few examples of a threefold kind.

1. With respect to the acceptance or signification of words, Lev. 26.30. The
fragments of Idols are called Carcasses, by a hard Metaphor, alluding to the
Carcasses of men, before mentioned, Deuteronomy. 16.7. To (...) Boil is put for
Roasting the Paschal Lamb, which was not to be boiled but roasted by the
Command of God, Exodus 12.9. etc. Live Flesh (in the Hebrew Text) is put for Raw
Flesh, 1 Samuel 2.15. The Water, which the three Worthies of David brought with
the peril of their Lives, is called (by a harder Metonymy) their Blood. Job
4.12. Now a word was brought by stealth to me, he speaks of that Angelical
Oracle that came secretly to Eliphas. See more examples, Psalm. 88.5. Where he
calls [ forsaken] free, etc. Matthew. 12. Romans 7.23. In dwelling sin, is called a
Law, because it has a kind of Command upon a man while he lives, unless the
power of grace restrains it -- See 1 Cor. 11.10. The covering of a woman's head,
is called (...) power, (because it is passively a sign of her being under the
Command of the Man,) by a Catachrestical Metonymie.

Sin is called (...), the Members, which are on the Earth, by a hard Metaphor.
See Col. 2.11.

2. With respect to the joining of the words, when some words (in a Metaphor
especially) are joined together, which seem not so well to correspond, as Exodus
5.21. where it is said to stink in the Eyes, which better agrees with the
Nostrils. which denotes great averseness, Exodus 20.18. And all the people saw
the Thunder, and Lightnings and the noise of the Trumpet, of which only
Lightning, is seen the others are heard. So to see a voice, Rev. 1.12. See more
examples, Matthew. 7.21, 22. and 10.15. etc. 1 Timothy 6.19. 2 Cor. 5.2. 2 Timothy
2.19. etc.

Note
3. With respect to the change of words -- This belongs to the writings of the
New Testament, and the Greek Tongue, in which certain words are used to
signify different things, because One and the same Hebrew word, (whence that
speech was taken), may so signify. Thus (...), (Aiones) secula, ages, are put
for the World, Heb. 1.6. because the Hebrew (...) signifies both Ages and the
World, Eccl. 3.11. (...), gratis, freely is put for (...), frustra, in vain,
Gal. 2.21. From the Hebrew word (...), which signifies both viz. (freely) as
opposed to merit, price, or reward, and, ( in vain) as it is
contradistinguisht, from the hoped effect, or event, Psalm. 109.2, 3. See more
examples, Rev. 14.8. and 18.3. compared with Job 6.4. Matthew. 6.34. A word that
signifies Malice, is put for Affliction because the Hebrew word (...) signifies
both. See Amos 3.6. See 1 Cor. 15.54. With Amos 1.11. Heb. 11.31. Jam. 2.25. 1
Cor. 2.6. and 14.20. Col. 3.14. and 4.12. 1 John 4.18. etc. with Judges 9.16.
and Prove. 11.3. etc.

CHAP. XIX. Of an Hyperbole.
HYperbole is that Affection of a Trope, (...) superlatio A lifting, or
carrying above
by which with greater excess and enlargement for to amplify or extenuate
things, a word is carried, or used, very far from its proper and native
signification. Here we are not to take away an Hyperbole from the Holy
Scripture by that pretext, that it is a kind of Lie, extolling or depressing a
thing, more than is true: For we are to observe, that this kind of speech, (as
Tropes are) is accommodated more to make expressions efficacious and powerful,
than with any purpose to deceive, for that is inconsistent with the Goodness
and Truth of this most true and blessed Author, the Lord God; and that there is
no disagreement between the mind, and the words spoken, which is the thing that
constitutes a lie.

There is a Twofold Speices of an Hyperbole

(1.) Amplification, which the Greeks call (...), Auxesis, and Extenuation,
which they call (...), Meiosis.

Examples of this Auxesis or Amplification are partly Rhetorical, partly
Logical. Auxesis.
Such as relate to Rhetoric are either in single words, or in a conjunct
phrase. To single words these belong.

[ War] is put for any private strife, Jam. 4.1. which answers the Hebrew word
(...) which is taken in this sense, Single words.
Jer. 1.19. and 15.20. Heaven] is put for very great height, and on the
contrary, an Abyss or Hell, for great depth or dejection, Genesis 11.4. Let us
build us a City and a Tower whose top (or head) may reach heaven, that is,
higher than any thing on Earth. See Deuteronomy. 1.28. and 9.1. etc. Psalm. 107.26.
They mount up to Heaven, they go down to the Depths, which denotes the vehement
and dreadful tossing of waves in a storm, Esa. 57.9. Thou did debase thy self
to Hell -- that is, to be the most abject of all; he speaks of the Kingdom of
Juda, who submitted themselves very basely by their King Ahaz, to the Assyrians
because they would be assisted by them, 2 Kings 16.7. etc. See more examples
Matthew. 11.23. Lam. 2.1. Luke 10.21. 1 Samuel 5.12. 2 Chronicles. 28.9. Jer. 51.9. Rev.
18.5. Esa. 14.13. Jer. 51.53. etc.

[ To Vomit up] is put for recompense or payment of what a man has eaten, Prove.
23.8. Matthew. 19.12.

[ To make ones self an Eunuch,] is put for, to suppress irregular lusts, yea,
there are some, who by the gift of God, have the gift of continency, this is a
metaphorical Hyperbole used by Christ, (...), by way of Antanaclasis, Jam. 3.6.
The Tongue is a fire, a world of Iniquity, that is, a thing full of wickedness,
as the world is full of many things. See Jer. 4.29. Ruth. 4.6.

[ To Rob (...).] is put for to Receive 2 Cor. 11.8. This is a great Auxesis,
for he names the acceptance of due and moderate sallary, depredation or
Robbery.

[ Rivers of Oyl] are put for abundance of all good things, Job 29.6. See Job
20.19. Micah 6.7. where there is a more illustrious exaggeration, ten thousands
of Rivers of Oil.

Thunder is put for the strong neighing of a Horse, Job 39.19.

A Tower is put for a very High place, Neh. 8.4. etc.

In a conjunct phrase] we have these Hyperboles, Genesis 41.47. And in the seven
plenteous years, In a conjunct phrase.
the Earth brought forth by handfuls; as if he had said that from one grain
they had gathered a handful. This Hyperbolical speech denotes great increase.
See ver. 49. etc.

More examples you may read, Genesis 42.8. Exodus 8.17. Judge. 5.4. ( with Number. 20)
ver. 5. Judge. 20.16. 1 Samuel 7.6. Psalm. 6.6. and 119.136. Jer. 9.1. Lam. 3.48,
49. etc. 1 Samuel 25.37. 1 Kings 1.40. 1 Kings 10.5. Esa. 5.25. with Deuteronomy. 32.22.
Lam. 2.11. Ezekiel. 27.28. 2 Samuel 17.13. 2 Kings 19.24. Job 29.6. and 40.18. Esa.
13.13. and 14.14. and 34.3, 4, 7. Ezekiel. 26.4. and 32.5, 6, 7, 8. and 39.9, 10.
Amos 9.13. Nahum. 2.3, 4. Gal. 4.15.

A Logical Hyperbole which is used in proper words shall be considered.

A Logical Hyperbole.
(1.) With respect,

1. To Hyperbolical comparisons, when one thing is compared with another, which
can bear no tolerable proportion with it, as Genesis 13.16. And I will make thy
Seed as the Dust of the Earth: So that if a man can number the Dust of the
Earth, then shall thy Seed also be numbered. The sense is, that the Seed of
Abraham should be a very great multitude, because innumerable, or not to be
numbered. But inasmuch as it is compared to the Dust of the Earth, it is
Hyperbolical because as Augustine Lib. 16. de Civ. Dei, c. 21.
says, it is obvious to every ones sense, that the number of the Sands (or
dust) is incomparably beyond the number of humane kind from Adam to the end of
the world, much more beyond the number of Abraham's Seed, whether natural Jews,
or Believers, who are called his Seed, because they believe as he did. The same
Comparison of the Sand of the Sea, and the Dust of the Earth is to be read,
Genesis 22.17. and 28.14. Judge. 7.12. 1 Samuel 13.5. 1 Kings 4.20, 29. 2 Chronicles. 1.9.
Job 29.18. Psalm. 78.26, 27. Esa. 29.5. Jer. 15.8. Heb. 11.12. etc. So other
Comparisons, swifter then Eagles, 2 Samuel 1.23. that is, Saul and Jonathan, Jer.
4.13. Lam. 4.19. See 1 Kings 10.27. See ver. 21.2 Chron. 1.15. and 9.20. etc.
Job 6.3. and 41.9. Habakkuk 2.5. Lam. 4.7, 8. etc.

2. In certain Hypotheses, where for Emphasis sake the things are amplifi'd
more than really it is, or can be, Psalm. 139.8, 9, 10. If I ascend up into
Heaven, thou art there; if I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I
take the wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermost part of the Sea: Even
there shall thy hand lead me, and thy Right hand shall hold me. Now no man
living can ascend unto Heaven, nor descend into Hell, nor take wings, and fly
as fast as the morning. But these things are mentioned by way of Hyperbolical
fiction, to illustrate the Infiniteness and Omnipresence of God which no man
can avoid or fly from. There is an hyperbolical expression or hypothesis, Prove.
27.22. which denotes that no endeavors will reclaim or bring men obdurate in
folly to the Right way. That Hyperbole Obad. ver. 4. denotes the certainty of
Divine Judgment against the Edomites. See Jer. 49.16. etc.

Matthew. ^^6.26. But what is a man profited, if he shall gain the while world
and shall lose his own Soul? By the word World, all the Power, Riches,
Pleasure, and precious things there, are to be understood in one word. And by
this hypothetical hyperbole, the most grievous state of the wicked, that (by
these toys which are but transient) forfeit Eternal Life, is denoted. See Mark
8.36. Luke 9.25. etc. 1 Cor. 4.15. and 13.1, 2. Gal. 1.8. etc.

3. In some others, 1 Kings 20.10. as that Thrasonical or boasting speech of
Benhadad King of Syria, In some others.
is recorded to the King of Jerusalem, that the Dust of Samaria should not
suffice for handfuls, for all the people that follow me. This is a high piece
of hyperbolical boasting, as if he had said, all your Land can be brought by
handfails, by my Army, yea, shall not be enough for the number of bearers, (so
great is my Host); how easily therefore shall I overcome you? Hos. 2.17. There
is an Hyperbole which denotes the contempt of Idolatry, that will be, and that
their names shall not be used with any reverence, which must be the meaning,
for Paul names Baal, Romans 11.4. See Acts 7.4^^. etc.

Matthew. 5.29. If thy Right Eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it out from
thee, Matthew. 5.29.
ver. 30. If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee;
etc. Christ would not have a man Maim his body, but by this hyperbolical
precept, intimates, the great heinousness, and extreme danger of scandal or
offense, and that we are by any means to avoid it, and part from all occasions
of giving it. That Hyperbolical expression, Matthew. 24.2. denotes extreme
destruction and razing of the Foundation. See Hag. 2.16. Matthew. 1.6. and Luke
10.4. Of which before, in the Metonymie of a sign. Matthew. 24.2.


John 21.25. And there are also many other things, which Jesus did, the which,
if they should be written every one, I suppose, John 21.25.
that even the whole world it self could not contain the Books, that should be
written. Some expound this of the capacity of the understanding, (hence
Theophilact expounds (...), by (...) to understand, as the same word rendered
here contained, is taken, Matthew. 19.11.12.) that the sense may be, that there
would never be such an one in the World, that could comprehend all in his mind,
because of the variety and multitude of things done, and spoken by Christ, the
world being metonymically put for the Men, and Books for their Contents.

Others understand it of local capacity, properly so called, that the whole
world was not big enough to contain all the Books, if in every Circumstance all
the sayings and actions of Christ were written, which explication is favored
by the pronoun ((...), it self) added to the world: Take it which way you will,
it is an hyperbolical expression, especially in the latter sense. Some compare
Amos 7.10. with it, The Land is not able to bear all his words, etc.

By that Hyperbolical wish of the Apostle, Romans 9.3. his great and exceeding
love to the Israelites is noted. See Gal. 3.13, 14. Jude ver. 23. etc.

Examples of a Meiosis, or Extenuation.
1. TO a Rhetorical Meiosis belong such things as are by any Trope extenuated,
or lessened, as Genesis 18.27. Rhetorical Meiosis.
Behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and
ashes, that is, a most low and most abject Creature. it is a metaphor or a
metonymie, and alludes to the first Creation of man out of the Earth.

So to be exalted out of the dust, denotes to raise one of the meanest sort of
men, to honor, 1 Kings 16.2. Psalm. 113 7, etc. 1 Samuel 24.15. Whom do thou
pursue? After a dead Dog, after a Flea, as if he had said, that it was beneath
(or unworthy) so great a King to pursue me, that am but weak and mean with so
great a Troop.

Psalm. 22.6. But I am a Worm, and no Man, that is, a most afflicted man,
trampled on by the Enemy, like a Worm, etc. So Job 25.6. Esa. 41.14.

2. A logical Meiosis is when for extenuation sake, a comparison is made with a
very little thing, as Numb. 13.34. We saw men, Logical Meiosis.
and we were as Grasshoppers before them: that is, of small stature in
comparison of those Giants. See Esa. 40.15, 17. Psalm. 144.4.

3. Examples of a Grammatical Meiosis, are 2 Kings 18.4. And he called it,
((...) Nehustan) little brass, by a diminutive word, by way of contempt of the
brazen Serpent that was made an Idol, of these diminutives there are many in
the Hebrew text, but we leave them for Critics.

Some is put for a great many, Romans 3.3. 1 Timothy 4.1.

Some Body, is put for an eminent man, Acts 5.36. Boasting himself to be some
body, as Acts 8.9. So Pindarus says, (...), that is, Quid est aliquis? Quid est
nullus? umbrae somnium homo est.
what is some Body? What is no Body? Man is the dream of a shadow.

Sick is put for one Dead in sin, or desperately bad in his spiritual state,
for these that are said to be ungodly, and verse 8. sinners, and Enemies ver.
10. These few instances of many we note for the illustration of this Trope.

CHAP. XX. Of an Allegory.
ALLGOPIA, an Allegory, with respect to its Etymology or derivation, signifies
that, when one thing is said, another thing is understood. It is the
Continuation of a Trope, especially of a metaphor, and although Metonymies,
Ironies and Synecdoches are likewise continued, yet not so frequently nor with
that Emphasis, as in the other florid Tropes, therefore we will in a particular
chapter treat of this continued Metaphor, not so much to show the Fountains
whence Allegories are taken, (for that I presume is abundantly shown where we
have treated of Metaphors) but to discover and explain some difficulties in it,
and show its peculiar nature.

These Allegories we will distinguish into Simple, and Allusive. The Simple we
call such as are taken from any natural things. The Allusive we call such as
respect other things, whether Words or Facts, and are from thence deduced into
a translated description.

Examples of a Simple Allegory.
Genesis 3.15. The first Gospel promise.
Genesis 3.15. And I will put Enmity between thee (O Serpent!) and the woman, and
between thy Seed, and her Seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise
his heel. The first Promise of the Gospel and the whole Mystery of Redemption
to come, is proposed by God himself in this Allegory. Here are almost all
Tropes in these words, especially the continuation of a metaphor. When Jehovah
speaks to the Serpent, he understands the Devil, either by a Metonymie, because
the Devil lurkt in the Serpent, and by it spoke to Eve; or by a metaphor,
because the natural Serpent was cursed by the word of God, ver. 14. And so made
abominable to the race of man, and so bore the figure of the Devil, whence the
Devil is called a Serpent and Dragon; Rev. 12.7, 8. etc. By the Woman mankind
is meant (by a Synecdoche) because mankind was to be sprung from those
Protoplasts or first formed Parents ( Eve being called the Mother of all
living, ver. 20) the enmity denounced, denotes the serious will of God to
deliver men in due time from the power of the Devil; See Acts 17.26, 27. --
30.31. -- 26.18. He mentions the woman only, because she was first seduced to
sin, as she confesses ver. 13. and to provoke her the more against her
Conqueror. By the seed of the Serpent, the whole power and Troop of Devils and
wicked men, who study the overthrow of Christ's Kingdom, is Metaphorically
represented. By the seed of the woman, by way of eminency, (...), the Messiah,
the son of man, is Metonymically understood, Vid. gram. sacr. page 869.
who also was to destroy the Devils Machinations. The Enmity between him and
the Serpents seed, intimates Gods immutable decree of man's Redemption by
Christ. The Metaphor is continued (...) ipsum, It (that is, the (...) semen,
Seed of the Woman, mentioned immediately before) shall bruise thy head, and
thou shall bruise its heel. The first phrase ( it shall bruise thy head)
Metaphorically declares, that Christ will destroy the Power of the Devil, for
as a Venomous Serpent when his head is bruised or broken, has neither strength
nor life; so the Devils power being broken, they can no longer hurt or destroy
men. But more particularly,

By the head of the Serpent, is meant Sin and Death, for as the Serpents Poison
and Power of biting lies in his head: so the Devils poison is sin, which
infects and destroys the wole man; hence it is deservedly called the poison of
Dragons, and the cruel venom of Asps, Deuteronomy. 32.33. where note, that in the
Hebrew (...) a The same word in Genesis 3.15
Head is put for Venom, and the Epithete, Cruel, is added, as if there were a
perfect allusion to the head of that most cruel Serpent, Genesis 3.15. Therefore
when Christ takes away sin, he breaks the head of that infernal Serpent: See
John 3.8. And because the Serpents life, and strength lies in his head, and
because the head is the supreme and most noble Member in a Creature, by whose
virtue and influence the whole body is governed, it is put for Power, Dominion,
and Superiority, Deuteronomy. 28.13, 44. Lam. 1.5. etc. The Power, Strength, and
Dominion of the Devil against men, consists in death or killing, Heb. 2.14.
Therefore when Christ abolishes spiritual death, he breaks the serpents head,
(viz. his power to destroy men spiritually.) See 1 Cor. 15.54. The other phrase
( and thou shall bruise his heel) denotes the manner and medium of effecting
men's Salvation, viz. his passion, and most bitter Death. Christ is proposed as
a magnificent Hero, who (as it were) with his feet tramples on the Serpent, and
breaks his head. And as a Serpent when trampled upon, resists with all his
strength, while he has any life, wresting and winding himself, spitting poison,
and biting his Enemy; so Jehova intimates, that the Devil would do so, by this
phrase; As if he had said, thou shall defend thy self with all thy might, and
use all endeavors to destroy thine Enemy, the Messiah, (whilst I indulge thee
for fallen man's sake to use thy worst) neither shall he escape unhurt, for he
shall suffer a most ignominious Death, by thine Instruments: But this will not
profit thee, for thou shall not be able to touch his head, but only one of his
heels, that is, the less principal part, will in some Measure be hurted by
thee, but my Divine omnipotence shall cure that wound, by giving him a glorious
Resurrection from Death, and by my Gospel, declaring him to the whole world to
be Conqueror of Hell, and all its powers: whereas thou shall utterly perish;
not only thy heel, but thy very head shall be broken.

We have Insisted the larger upon this great Oracle of Divine Truth, because it
is the Foundation of the Prophecies concerning the Messiah, and all our Hope
and Comfort, which we hope shall not seem tedious to the Pious Reader.

Genesis 49.11, 12. Binding his Fool unto the Vine, Genesis 49.11, 12.
and his Asses Colt unto the choice Vine; he washed his garments in Wine, and
his Clothes in the blood of grapes, -- his Eyes shall be red with wine, and his
Teeth white with milk --. In the last words of the Patriarch Jacob, there are
many things spoken Allegorically in this Chapter --, of which these words are
most Emphatical, which are spoke in the Blessing of Judah; which the Rabbis
and some Christians understand by an hyperbole of an Earthly Inheritance, and
the great plenty and faecundity thereof, but ver. 10. shows this to be a clear
Prophecy of Shiloh or the Messiah to come of the Tribe of Judah --, and surely
the Patriarch from so excellent a subject would not slip into the mention of
those vain, earthly things --, and what he says of the redness of eyes with
wine, it is reckoned amongst wickednesses, Prove. 23.24. because a sign of
drunkenness, which the Patriarch (who severely taxt his sons sins, ver. 4, 5.)
would not reckon among his Blessings.

This is therefore An Allegory, and is to this effect expounded by the Learned
Brentius --. Binding his Fool to a Vine] this is a desciption of Peace and
tranquillity in the Kingdom of Christ. See Jer. 23.7. and Zach. 3.10. for in
Wars, they do not bind Foles or Asses to the Vines, when men cannot dwell under
their own Vine and Figtree, which are destroyed, which denotes the peaceable
administration of Christ in his Kingdom. See Isa. 9.5. This is not to be
understood of external Tranquillity, but partly because Christ establishes his
Kingdom without warlike Arms, by the Preaching of the Gospel; and partly
because it brings Peace and Tranquillity of Conscience. He shall wash in Wine]
this is a description of abundance, and the vile esteem of worldly things in
the Kingdom of Christ. But we are to understand it of the abundance of
spiritual things, as Remission of sins, Righteousness, etc. Matthew. 6.33. Psalm.
45.2. etc.

Some Expound this of the Passion of Christ --; The Vineyard of Christ is his
Church, Isa. 5.1. and 27.2. and 65.21. Matthew. 20.1. and Christ is the Vine into
which the branches are grafted, John 15.1, 4, 5. and the meaning (say they) is,
Christ compares his Church (because of its simplicity, humility, and the
burdens of trouble which it is forced to bear in the World) to an Ass, which he
will feed with most sweet grapes and spiritual Joy, or inebriate it, that being
rendered courageous, it should despise death, Devils, Hell, and Persecutions
--, and so Christ will wash his garment in wine, and his Clothes in the blood
of grapes --, that is, will pour his most precious blood upon his garments,
viz. his Flesh, which his Deity puts on as a Clothing, which will afterward
be excellent spiritual Wine to comfort and refresh the faithful. His eyes will
be red with wine] that is, in his Passion, for then he had no form nor
Comeliness, Isa. 53.2. viz. when Whipped, Spit upon, and Crowned with thorns,
and carried about in disgrace by Pilate's Order --; so he was deformed, for
others sins. But inasmuch as in him was found no spot, nor was guile found in
his mouth, 1 Pet. 2.22. His Teeth are said to be white with milk, ver. 12.
Whiteness signifies purity and Innocence, etc. See Isa. 63.1, 2, 3, etc.

A description of old Age and Death.
Eccl. 12. There is an Allegorical Description of old Age and Death, ver. 2. By
the Darkness of the Sun, Light, Moon, and Stars,] the languishing and
consumption of Vigor, Strength and Judgment is, denoted, ver. 3. By the
trembling of the Keepers of the house, and the bowing of strong men] the
weakness of the hands, knees, and arms is signified (See Isa. 35.3.) which are
keepers of the body from hurt. The ceasing of the grinders, because few]
denotes the decay of the Teeth, or their being almost gone. The darkning of
those that look out at the Windows] betokens dimness of sight, the Eyes being
the windows of the Body; ver. 4. The shutting of doors in the streets] betokens
the contraction of the lips, and tyresomness in speech. The lowness of the
sound of grinding,] signifies debility of Voice. Rising at the voice of the
Bird] denotes want of sleep* for old men scarce sleep half the night, and are
easily awaked by the Cocks crowing. The bringing low of the Daughters of
Musick] denotes dullness of hearing, and that those Ears that could Judge of
Music, delight not in it. (See 2 Samuel 19.35.) ver. 5. To be afraid of high
places] signifies difficulty of going. The flower of the Almond-tree shall
flourish] that is, Gray Hairs. The Grasshopper shall be a burden] that is, the
backbone shall bend and grow weak, so that it cannot bear any burden. Desire
shall fail] that is, Appetite to Meat, and other things. (2 Samuel 19.35.) then
follows a description of Death* etc. In the Book of Canticles there are many
continued Metaphors or Allegories that are very Emphatical and obscure, yet
contains many deep Mysteries. It being a spiritual Poem, setting forth the love
of Christ to his Church, etc. about which the Reader is referred to our English
Expositors. See other Allegories, Isa. 28.20. Amos 3.12. Isa. 38.12. Jer. 11.6.
-- 12.5. Ezekiel. 16.3. Hos. 13.15. Zach. 14.3, 4, 5. etc.

In the Old Testament you may find these Allegories besides, Deuteronomy. 32.13, 15,
22, 32, 33, 41, 42. -- 33.19, 20, 24, 25. Judge. 8.2. -- 14.18. 1 Kings 12.11,
14. 2 Kings 19.3. Job 4.10, 11. -- 20.12. etc. -- 27.20. etc. -- 29.14. etc. --
38.9, 10. Psalm. 23.1. etc. -- 51.8, 9. -- 69.1, 2, 3. -- 75.8, 9. -- 80.8, 9,
etc. -- 110.2, 3. -- 123.3. Prove. 3.8. -- 9.1. etc. Eccl. 11.1. etc. Isa. 1.5,
6, 7, 22. -- 66.6, 7. -- 5. ult. -- 14.29. -- 30.33. -- 32.23. -- 36.6. --
42.3. -- 45.8. -- 54.11, 12. -- 55.1, 2, 12, 13. -- 59.5, 6. Jer. 4.11, 12. --
5.6. -- 6.28, 29, 30. -- 12, 9. -- 50.17. Ezekiel. 13.10. etc. -- 17.3. etc. --
22.19. etc. -- 23.2. etc. -- 29.3. etc. -- 31.3. etc. -- 32.3. etc. -- 34. etc.

In the New Testament, Matthew. 3.10, 12. -- 5.13. -- 7.3, 4, 5, 6. -- 9.15. etc.
-- 12.43. etc. -- 15.13. Luke 9.62. Romans 11.16, 17, 18. etc. -- 13.11, 12. 1
Cor. 3.6, 7, 8, 9, etc. -- 5.7, 8. -- 9.26, 27. 2 Cor. 3.2, 3. -- 5.1, etc. --
10.3, 4, 5, 6. -- 11.2. Gal. 4.19. -- 5.15. -- 6.8, 9. Ephesians. 6.11. etc. The
Explication of all which, (at least for the most part) may be taken from our
Treatise of Metaphors, so that we shall leave them to be improved by the
studious Reader.

Examples of an allusive Allegory.
PSALM. 11. Upon the Wicked he shall Rain Snares (or Coals) Fire and Brimstone,
and the Spirit of Terrors, the Portion of their Cup, (so the Hebrew) This is an
Allegorical Description of the grievousness of their Punishment, by allusion to
the destruction of Sodom, as Isa. 34.9, 10. etc. See Psalm. 20.3. where by an
Allegory of Burnt-offerings, etc. Prayers are meant --. More Examples, Psalm.
50.3. -- 55.9. Isa. 10.24. where he alludes to Moses his Rod. See ver. 26. Isa.
24.18. with Genesis 7.11. Isa. 26.14. with Exodus 14.13. Isa. 30.32. with Exodus
15.20. 1 Samuel 18.5. Psalm. 68.25, 26. with many others.

In the New Testament you have these Examples, Matthew. 5.22. which Allegory
alludes to the form of Civil Judgments amongst the Jews, and their Punishments.
Matthew. 6.17. Christ alludes to the hypocritical Practices of the Pharisees, who
deformed their Faces when they fasted, ver. 16. The sense is that you must not
imitate them.

In New Testament Worship, there are frequent Allusions to that which is proper
to the Old Testament, as was shown, Chap. XIII. of a Metaphor, Isa. 4.5. there
is an Allegorical description of Gods Protection of his Church by allusion to
the pillar of a Cloud and Fire, Exodus 13.21. See Isa. 11.14, 15, 16. -- 52.11.
with 2 Cor. 6.17. Isa. 54.1, 4, 5. (see Gal. 4.26. 27.) etc. There are other
Allegories, Isa. 54.2. from enlarging of Tents --, from the inhabiting of
desolated Cities, ver. 3.5. laying the magnificent foundation, ver. 11, 12.6.
(where there is withal an Hyperbole.) See Matthew. 16.18. Ephesians. 2.20, 21. from the
abolition of hostile Instruments, ver. 16, 17. See Isa. 61.6, 7, 8, 9. see Hos.
2.15. Amos 9.13, 14, 15. Zach. 14.10, 11. etc. -- 2 Cor. 3.13. where is the
Description of the New Testament Church, 2 Cor. 3.13, 14, 15 The vail of Moses.
there is an Allusion to the Vail of Moses. See John 9.28. etc. the sense of
which Allegory is, that as the Jews could not behold the Face of Moses because
of the Vail; so the Carnal Jews (those (...) enemies of Christ) could not see
the Splendour of this spiritual Moses, (that is, the chief End and Scope of his
Writers) and do not understand that Jesus Christ is our Savior, because of
their willing Blindness of Mind, which as a Vail keeps the shinings of that
light from their hearts, which cannot be taken away but by true Conversion.
Then by way of Antithesis says, ver. 18. that we ( viz. his Disciples) with
open Face behold his glory, etc. See ver. 7, 8, 9, 13, 18, etc. See Gal. 4.28,
31. with ver. 22, 23, 24. See also another Allegory, Rev. 7.15. where there is
an Allusion to the Levitical Ministry in the Old Testament Temple.

CHAP. XXI. Of a Paraemia or Proverb.
THE Generical Consideration of a Trope with respect to its continuation we
have Treated of in the last Chapter --; The special Consideration of it, we
will Treat of in this. Which is either according to common use, and called
Paraemia, a Proverb, or an Adagy; or with respect to its obscurity, and is
called Aenigma, or a Riddle or obscure Allegory. The Hebrews call it (...)
Meshal, Ezekiel. 16.44. and 18.2. from the Root (...) which takes its
signification from Comparing or Ruling, that so (...) may be a Proverb, or a
Comparative Speech or Likeness, or as it were (...), a Ruling Sentence, which
has the principal place in a speech, and by its weight and gravity it makes it
more Illustrious --. What other Acceptations this word has, shall be shown
(with Divine Assistance) in the second Volume of this Book. To the Sense we
hold to, the word (...) 2 Pet. 2.22. exactly agrees, (...)
which some think is derived (...), a via, from, or out of the way, that is, a
departing from the vulgar or Common way of speaking, or as others think from
(...), beyond or besides the word.
praeter vel juxta primum verbum (for (...) signifies also a Verb) and from its
sense is, as it were, another word and sense, as a Proverb is called.

In Proverbs words properly taken, or Tropes or their Affections are used;
which last only concerns us in this Place. And both are either entire Sentences
or Proverbial Phrases, which by common use, are brought into a sentence.

Proverbial sentences.
Proverbial Sentences are to be read in Genesis 10.9. and 22.14. Numb. 21.27. 1 Samuel 10.12. and 24.14. 2 Samuel 5.8. and 20.18. Jer. 31.29. Ezekiel. 16.44. and
18.2. Luk 4.23. John. 4.37. 2 Pet. 2.22. in which places the holy Spirit
expressly affirms that those sentences are become Proverbs. There are other
phrases (...), to which the Title of Proverbs is not annexed, yet because of
their Emphaticalness, they are so esteemed: as Deuteronomy. 25.4. 1 Kings 8.46. and
20.11. 2 Chronicles. 25 9. Job 6.5. and 14.19. and 27.19. and 28.18. Psalm. 42.7. --
62.9. Such is that famous Sentence, Psalm. 111.10. The fear of the Lord, is the
beginning of Wisdom: See Prove. 1.7. and 9.10. with Job 28.25.28. There are many
in the Book called (...) the Proverbs of Solomon, as Prove. 1.17, 32. -- 3.12.
-- 6.6, 27. -- 10.5, 13, 19, 25. -- 11.15, 22, 27. -- 12.11, 15. -- 15.2, 53.
-- 17.1, 10, 19, 28. -- 19.2, 24. -- 20.4, 11, 14, 21, 25. -- 22.6, 13. --
25.11, 16, 27. -- 26.4, 10, 11, 14, 17, 28. -- 27.6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 17, 22. --
28.21. -- 30.15. etc.

So in the Book of Ecclesiastes; Chap. 1.15, 18. -- 4.5, 12. -- 5.2, 6, 8, 9,
10. -- 6.9. -- 7.17. -- 9.4, 18. -- 10.1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 19, 20. -- 11.3, 4, 6,
7. -- 12.12.

In the Prophets, Jer. 13.23. -- 23.28. Ezekiel. 7.5. Micah 7.5, 6. Habak. 2.6.
Mal. 2.10. etc.

In the New Testament; Matthew. 5.13, 14, 15. -- 6.3, 21, 24, 34. -- 7.2, 5, 16.
-- 9.12, 16. -- 10.10, 22, 24, 26. -- 12.34. -- 13.12, 57. -- 15.14. -- 23.23.
-- 24.28. Mark 9.50. Luke 9.62. -- 12.48. -- 23.31. Act. 9.5. -- 20.35. 1 Cor.
5.6. -- 10.12. -- 15.33. 2 Cor. 9.6, 7. 2 Thessalonians. 3.10. Tit. 1.15.

Here we must note that Christ and his Apostles used several Proverbs, or
vulgar ways of speaking, common to the Jews, which were partly written in
their old Books, yea even in the Talmud, as Matthew 7.2. Mark 4.24. Luke 6.38.
With the same measure ye mete, the same shall be measured to you again, which
is in the Talmud tract. Sanhedrim in these words, (...) By the same measure
which ye shall measure, others will measure to you again. It Is very plain in
the Targum Hierosolymitanum, Genesis 38. in these words; By what measure a man
measures, by the same will others Measure to him; as to good Measure or bad
measure. So the sentence, Matthew 19.24. It is easier for a Camel, etc. is in
the Talmud as Ang. Caninius says; only it is said there, that an Elephant
cannot go through the Eye of a needle, for which Elephant, (a Beast known to
few) Christ said a Camel, a Beast well known in Syria. And the phrase, Luke
6.42. Buxtorfius in Glossatore Talmudico says, is also in the Talmud. And 2
Thessalonians 3.10. If any will not work, neither shall he eat -- Drusius, 2
Tract. in Genesis magn. Bereschith Rabba Tract. Talmud: says the same phrase is
the Talmud. And doubtless the Apostle thence took it. See Adag. sacra. written
by Zelmer from the whole Bible in 5. Centur.

Of Proverbial phrases. See examples, Exodus 11.7. Proverbial phrases.
That a dog should not move his tongue, was a Proverbial speech, denoting
profound silence and peace in that place. Some refer this to a Meiosis. See 1
Samuel 25.22, 34. 1 Kings 14.10. And 16.11. 2 Kings 9.8. which last was also a
Proverbial phrase, denoting extreme destruction, even to the vilest Animal.

See other Proverbial Speeches, 2 Kings 14.26. Deuteronomy 32.36. Esth. 1.22.
Job. 16.10. Psalm. 3.7. Lam. 3.39. Micah 4.14.

See Esaiah 3.15. 2 Corinthians 11.10. And 12.7. Matthew 5.39. Luke 6.29. with

To kick against the Pricks, was a Proverbial speech, Acts 5.39. See Acts 23.9.
The phrase 1 Cor. 13.15.

But he shall be saved yet so as by Fire, is a Proverbial speech, as if he had
escaped from a Conflagration. That is, as Illyricus says, Clav. Script. Col. 870.
such a Teacher is together with his stubble in the midst of a terrible
incendium (or fire) these being condemned by the Judgment of God, shall perish,
but he by the singular favor of God, shall be preserved though with much
hazard and difficulty. See Zachariah 3.2. Amos 4.11. etc.

CHAP. XXII. Of an Aenigma.
IN a continued Trope, if there be a singular obscurity it is called (...),
Aenigma, which signifies an obscure question, a knotty or dark speech; it is
derived of (...), which signifies to hint obscurely, and, as it were, to speak
in the dark. And that comes from (...), which amongst other things denotes not
only praise, but a saying worthy of praise and admiration, because it is a
symbolical and sinewy way of expression. It is said of the Queen of Sheba, 1
Kings 10.1. That she came to try Solomon with hard questions, that is,
Aenigma's, such as we treat of. See Ezekiel. 17.2. Psalm. 78.2. with 49.4. etc.

Judge. 14.14. Samson says to his guests -- out of the eater came forth meat,
and out of the strong came forth sweetness -- this is a continued Synecdoche,
with the addition of a Metonymie. By the Eater and Strong is meant a Lion, by a
Synecdoche of the Genus, by sweetness, honey, by a metonymie of the Adjunct as
ver. 18. Vossius after he had called this an Aenigma lib. 4. instit* orat. c.
11. thinks it was not really so, because it was unknown to the Philistines,
that Samson had killed a Lion, or got honey out of his Carcass, being a thing
he had told to no person as Judge. 14.7, 10, 17. Psalm. 49.5. I will fear in the
evil day the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about -- the question is,
what this evil day is, and what is the sin or iniquity of the heels? As to the
first R. Aben Ezra, by Evil day, understands old age compared with Eccl. 12.1.
In this sense, why should I trouble my self with the cares of this world, for
the solicitude of old age? R. Kimchi would have it in this sense, why should I
be solicitous for the Riches of this World, which are its Glory? R. Salomo
joining this with the next verse, thus expounds it -- The sins, which I do (as
it were) trample upon with my heels, and esteem light transgressions, yet in it
the judgment of God condemn me, how much more do Riches condemn such as trust
in them? See Eccl. 9.10. etc.

Glass. rhet. sacra. p. 508.
Prove. 26.10. Is a very perplexed Text, and rendered variously by Interpreters,
which we leave to the inquiry of the Learned. Erasmus calls that parabolical
passage Matthew. 12.43, 44, 45. Luke 11.24, 25, 26. an Aenigma, upon which see
his Paraphrase.

lib. 1. parall. 8.
To Conclude Frarciscus Junius says, that an Aenigma, is an obscure Parable or
Allegory, which is more difficultly understood. Hence every Parable or Allegory
is not to be reputed an Aenigma; but every Aenigma is an Allegory, etc.

The Conclusion.
SO much of Tropes. Our next work is to treat in the same Order of all the
Schemes or Figures in Scripture, which if the Divine Goodness will permit,
shall be largely expounded in the Second Volume; where we will also give a
particular Treatise of all the Types, Parables, and Allegories in Scripture,
with the Expositions of the Learned upon such as are obscure, as also a
Continuation of Metaphors practically improved in a Parallel-way, which will
complete this Work, and could not be brought in here, because we are confined
to a certain number of Sheets, and a certain Time to Answer the expectation of
such Worthy Persons as have Subscribed for the encouragement of so heavy a
Work, which we now leave to the blessing of the Lord.

TPOPOLOGIA: A KEY TO OPEN Scripture-Metaphors.

Wherein the most Significant TROPES, (As METAPHORS, etc.) And Express
SIMILITUDES, Respecting the Father, Son, and Holy-Spirit, As also such as
respect the Sacred Word of God, Are opened, and Parallel-wise applied, together
with the Disparities: From which Practical Inferences are deduced, for
Edification of the Reader.

ye believe, if I should tell you of heavenly Things?

TO THE READER.
HAving spent many Years in a Ministerial Capacity, and having the Charge of a
particular Flock committed to me, (although in many respects unfit for the
Management of so great a Trust) partly, a particular Inclination, but
principally the Edification of my Hearers, drew out my Heart to study the
Nature of Scripture Metaphors, and other Tropes and figurative Speeches there
used; and finding the Scriptures abounding with Metaphors, Allegories, etc. and
that those Divine Matters which the Holy Spirit dictates, are represented by
Similitudes borrowed from earthly Things; yea, that they are often called by
the very Names that material or earthly Things are; God, by a gracious
Condescension, conveying the knowledge of spiritual Things by preaching them by
their respective earthly Parallels: I betook my self to preach upon some
Metaphors, which, by the Aid of Divine Goodness, wanted neither Success, nor
the general Satisfaction of my Auditory: And having many brief Heads of my
Notes, respecting some principal Metaphors, by me, it was judged by diverse
worthy Men, worth my Time and Pains to compile an entire Work upon this
Subject, for Public Good. And although I knew the Work to be too heavy for a
single Undertaker, yet I have adventured this Essay. And that there might be no
Defect, for want of any humane Literature needful, I have procured such Helps,
as I hope (to speak modestly) have given sufficient proof, that they want
neither Learning nor Languages; particularly, the Help of the Gentleman that
translated our Philologia Sacra, he being my Friend, and one that had leisure,
and a willing mind to contribute his Assistance. After much Labor and Pains,
it is brought so far as thou see; and if thou reapest any Benefit by it, give
God the Praise.

As to the Work it self, we have had it recommended by several learned and
judicious Ministers to their Christian Friends, in order to its being
encouraged. The Matter of it is Divine, but the Manner of handling possibly
will not please all. I must confess my own Defects and Disabilities for the
undertaking of so great a Subject, and am assured, the Christian and candid
Peruser will overlook Frailties, and take that in good part, which was designed
for the Public Good. As for Carpers and Censurers, that like nothing but what
they do themselves, they are below regard. I have met with an Objection against
my Method, viz. That no Parallels are to be drawn beyond the Scope of the Text,
answering the Intention of the Spirit there. To which I say,

First; That I have endeavored with all diligence to conform all my Parallels
to plain Scripture, and the Analogy of the Orthodox Faith; and if I go beyond
what the Scope of a particular Text is, yet I agree with the general Tenor of
God's Word.

Secondly; Metaphors being Terms borrowed from Things that have diverse
Properties, as far as they yield Parities or Disparities (with the Object
represented) agreeable to the Word of God, if they tend to Edification, may be
safely used: As for example; God (in a Metaphorical Notion) is called a Father;
how can a Parallel be limited, till you apply all the good Properties of a
natural Father to Him? So of Christ a Shepherd, etc. See our Sacred Philology,
page 67, and 171. The like may be said of many other general Terms, etc.

Thirdly; If our Method is not useful to critical Objectors, yet it is hoped it
will be so to the plain serious Reader; and the other may furnish himself with
what he likes, or let alone what he wants not.

Fourthly; If Example be any Warrant, I have the Precedents of the learned
Glassius, Illyricus, Dr. Franzius, and our own Caryl, Buroughs, Blackwood, and
diverse others, who have paralleled diverse Metaphors in the same nature as I
have done. All which, I presume, will satisfy such as can be satisfied, with
respect to this Objection.

I can truly say, that we have spared no Cost or Pains, to consult the best
Authors extant, whether Divines, Naturalists, Philosophers, Philologists, or
Critics, etc. in order to make this Essay useful for the end intended; and
have carefully labored to avoid any Notion of Things, that may offend such as
are sound in the Faith; but have kept all along within the Bounds of that
Gravity, and Orthodoxy of Matter, which the Christian Religion requires, and
the Reformed Protestants profess.

The Helps I have had from others, whether dead or alive, I readily acknowledge;
for I would not own that for mine which is not; and to accommodate the Work the
better, I have, I confess, expressed some Things in the very Words of diverse
worthy and learned Divines.

As to the Work in general, and the Use of it, read the Epistle to the First
Book. Only this let me add here: Such who would see what Improvement may be
fairly made of a Metaphor, may read Light, (Book 3. p. 1, to 40.) which
contains the Substance of several Sermons, preached upon 2 Cor. 4.4. with good
Acceptance.

Reader, This I must say, (what Profit it may yield thee I know not) yet when
the Second Volume is finished, thou will have the Fruit of near twenty Years
Study, in which time (diverse that know me can say) I have not been idle. And
thou may perceive, that what I have received I am willing to communicate to
others; Talents must not be hid in Napkins. And that it may bring Glory to God,
Advantage to Thee, and to the Church of Christ in general, is, and shall be the
constant Prayer of him, who is willing to serve thee in the Work of the Gospel,
for Christ's sake,

God a Father.
JOHN 20.27. (...) -- I ascend to my Father, and to your Father.

1 JOHN 3.1. (...). Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon
us, that we should be called the Sons of God.


THe Title of Father is attributed to God in a fourfold Respect:

1. As he is the Eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is his only
begotten Son, John 1.14. Ephesians. 1.3.

2. As he is the Father of Adam, and all his Natural Offspring in respect of
Creation, Luke 3.38.

3. As he is the Father of Mercies, all flowing from his Bountiful Hand to the
Creature, 2 Cor. 1.3. Ephesians. 4.6.

4. The Father of all Good Men in respect of Adoption and Regeneration wrought
in them by the Power of his Grace, Romans 8.15. Gal. 4.6.

The word (Abba) is a Syriack word ((...)) and is derived from the Hebrew (...)
Ab, from (...) to will, or acquiesce. It is only found in three places in
Scripture; as Mark 14.36. Romans 8.15. Gal. 4.6. and in all those places the Voci
(...) statim additur vocula (...) quod fit, ut Scriptura testetur, Deum
pertinere ad Graecos. Glass. Phil. Sacra. p. 305.
Greek word, (...), a Father is joined to it; which intimates (as learned men
say) that the Gospel Grace belongs to the Greeks, who were Gentiles, as well as
the Jews. It is observed, that this is the first word that usually Children
speak, which carries a Spiritual Allusion.

Quidam suavi allusione dicum Abba voce, quae retro eodem modo legitur, usum
esse Apostolum, hic and alias, ut innueret, Deum piorum esse patrem etiamsi ab
iis aversus esse videatur in cruce and calamitatibus. Id. ibid.
Whether it be read backwards or forwards, it sounds Abba, which by a sweet
allusion seems to imply, that God is the Father of the Faithful, even when in
their crosses and calamities he seems averse to them.

Others think that the Gemination or doubling of the word in Syriack and Greek,
carries an Emphasis, signifying that God is always a Father, and that the
Invocations of his Children should be put up with earnest Geminations, and
vehemence of desire.

Hierom makes the later an interpretation of the former, as Rev. 1.7. (...),
even so, and Amen; where the first is the explication of the second, being a
Hebrew word.

In the ensuing Parallel we take the Title Father in the fourth respect above
mentioned; and so it may not unfitly be termed a Metaphor, taken from a Natural
or Earthly Father: Because God has the same love to, and care of his Spiritual
or Adopted Children, as Worldly Parents have of their Natural Offspring; and
in what degrees of Paternal Eminence God excels them, shall be showed in the
Disparity.

METAPHOR.
I. A Father gives Being to his Children, Act. 7.8.
as Jacob begat the Twelve Patriarchs. Exodus 1.5.
-- Hence his Posterity are said to proceed out of his Loins; and are called
his Issue, Genesis 48.6.
or Offspring.

II. A Father makes provision for the nursing, nourishment, and bringing up of
his Children.

III. Fathers Cloth their Children; Jacob made Joseph a Coat of many colors;
Genesis 37.3.
they allow, not only for necessity, but also for Ornament, that they may take
the more delight in them.

IV. A Father dearly loves, highly esteems, and greatly pities his Children: If
they are sick, or under any calamity, his tender and compassionate Bowels yearn
with pity and sympathy to them.

V. A loving Father protects and defends his Children from hurts, injuries, and
abuses, to the utmost of his power, taking their part, and vindicating their
Innocence against all their Enemies, whom he warns not to wrong them at their
peril.

VI. The thoughts of a tender Father run out most toward their weakest
Children, who are least able to help themselves, giving special charge to such
as are entrusted to look after them, to take particular care of them.

VII. A Father provides Food and Physic for his Children: Matthew. 7.9, 10.
-- If they ask Bread, he will not give them a Stone; nor a Serpent, if they
ask him a Fish. How ready was the Nobleman to seek Jesus from place to place,
Joh. 4.46.
that he might heal his sick Son at Capernaum?

VIII. A Father takes delight to hear his young Children learn to speak; and is
better pleased at their endeavor to express their minds, (though in a lisping,
stammering, or inarticulate Language) than in the most florid Rhetoric, or
quaint Deliveries of others; and will answer their Requests, before the most
persuasive Oratory of Strangers.

IX. A loving and discreet Father proposes himself as a pattern and example of
good to his Children, and exhorts them to imitate hlm.

X. A Father loves those Children best that are most like him.

XI. A Father takes care to educate his Children, and instruct them in all
points of manners and good behavior in the various circumstances of their
lives, at home and abroad; toward Superiors, Inferiors, and Equals, toward
Friends and Enemies, and toward each other; giving them Precepts of good
learning, and other qualifications suitable to their ranks and qualities.

XII. Fathers are very ready to hear the humble suit and requests of their dear
Children, for such things as they stand in need of. Genesis 22.7.
-- Isaac cries to his Father, and he answered, Here am I my Son.

XIII. If a prudent Father grants not his Childrens request, it is because he
knows they ask things that are not good for them, but such as would prove in
conclusion hurtful, and prejudicial.

XIV. If a tender Parent sees his Children play with any hurtful thing, or to
be fond of that which may wound, kill, or destroy them, he takes it away from
them.

XV. Fathers take care of their Children, and are mindful of their welfare,
when at the greatest distance.

XVI. A Father overlooks the common weaknesses and infirmities of his Children,
and pardons them upon their humble applications for it.

XVII. A loving Father is much grieved if his Children prove wicked and
rebellious, and uses all gentle and mild ways to reclaim them.

XVIII. If a mild Fatherly entreaty, and gentle usage will not reclaim them,
the Father uses a Rod, Pro. 22.15. and 23.13.
and chastises them, because he loves them.

XIX. A Father corrects his Children, not that he delights in it, but because
it is absolutely necessary, he proportions the punishment to the Crime, his
Bowels yerning upon them the while; and when the Chastisement has effected its
end, he is ready with open Arms to receive them, Luke 15.20.
as in the case of the Prodigal.

XX. A Father provides a Portion for his Children, and takes care of their
future maintenance and subsistence, it being his duty to lay up for them. 2
Cor. 12.14.


PARALLEL.
I. GOd is the Author of Spiritual Being to his People: Of his own will begat
he us with the Word of Truth. Jam. 1.18. 1 Pet. 1.3.
-- Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope, etc. Hence
Believers are called his Children, begotten by his holy Word and Spirit.

II. God the Spiritual Father nourishes, and with Parental tenderness brings up
his Children: hence it is said they are born up by him from the Belly, Esa. 45.
and carried from the Womb -- To be laid to the Breast like newborn Babes, 1
Pet. 2.2. Isa. 1.2.
that they may receive the sincere Milk of the Word.

III. God Clothes his Saints -- He that so Clothes the grass of the field, Mat.
6.^^0. Isa. 6^^.10.
shall he not much more Cloth you, O ye of little Faith? He Clothes them with
the Garments of Salvation, covers them with the Robe of Righteousness, and
adorns them with the graces of his Spirit, and Evangelical Holiness, that he
might take the more delight in him.

IV. God so loved his children, that he sent his only begotten Son to save
them: Joh. 3.16. Isa. 38.17. Isa. 43.4. Psalm. 103.13.
In love to their Souls he delivers them; they are precious in his sight, and
honorable, and therefore he has loved them, etc. Like as a Father pitieth his
Children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.

V. God saves and defends his Children from their Soul-Enemies, as Sin, Satan,
Psalm. ^^9.9, 16. Ps. 62.2. Ephesians. 6.12. Ps. 94.22. 1 Chronicles. 20.21, 2^^. Ps.
105.19 Genesis 1^^.17. and 20.^^.
Spiritual Wickedness in high places, which without his help would be too
strong for them; therefore he covers them with his wing from the rage and
malice of Persecutors: he is always ready to take their part -- If it had not
been the Lord who was on our side* (says David) when men rose up against us,
then they had swallowed us up quick, etc. What a strict charge does the Lord
give to the Ungodly, touching his Israel? When they went from Nation to Nation,
and from one Kingdom to another people, he suffered no man to do them wrong;
yea, he reproved Kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not mine Anointed, and do
my Prophets no harm.

VI. God is exceeding tender and thoughtful of the Babes and weak ones among
his people, and gives particular charge concerning them unto his Ministers --
Strengthen ye the weak hands, Isa. 35.^^. Heb. 1^^.12. 1 These. 5.14. Isa. 40.11.
and confirm the feeble knees. -- And in another place, Comfort the feeble
minded, support the weak -- He is said to gather the Lambs with his arm, and
carry them in his bosom, and gently to lead those that are with young.

VII. God provides Food for his people, and whatsoever else they want -- The
young Lions do lack and suffer hunger, Psalm. 23.1, 2. Psalm. 34.8, 9, 10. Psalm.
1^^2.15. Psalm. 103.2, 3.
but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing -- There is no want
to them that fear him. He abundantly blesses (Sions) provision, and satisfies
her poor with bread -- Gives meat to them that fear him, for he is ever mindful
of his Covenant -- He provides Physic for their Soul-Diseases -- Bless the
Lord, O my Soul (says David) who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who heals
all thy diseases.

VIII. The Lord takes great delight to hear his little Children (his Babes in
Christ) learn to pray, Pro. 15.^^. Pro. 11.20. and 12.22. Isa 61.1: Luke 4.18.
Isa. 42.3. Romans 8.^^ Isa. 38.1^^. Pro. 15.^^.
and open their wants to him; and though they stammer out a request or sigh, or
lisp out a Petition, he is willing to hear and answer them -- His Spirit helps
their infirmities, (for they know not what they should pray for as they ought)
and makes intercession for them with unutterable groans: Though (like the
Prophet) they chatter like a ^^rane, yet he will not despise them; but rather
lend his Ear to them, than to the vain pomp and empty Ceremonies of Formalists,
and the specious performances of the Hypocrite.

IX. God is proposed by Christ as a holy pattern and example to his Saints -- Be
ye perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect -- And in another place, Mat.
5.48. Lev. 19.2. Luke 6.36. Lev. 11.44. and 20.7. Col. 1.11. 1 Pet. 1.1^^. 2
Cor. 3.18. Dan. 9.2^^. 2 Pet. 1.4. Act. 13.22. 1 John 3.2, 3. Jo^^. ^^1.7. Ps.
25.4. and 27.11. 2 Timothy 3.15. Luke 11.49 Ephesians. 4.11. Neh. 9.14. Isa. 28.10. 1
Cor. 10.32. 2 Cor. 6.3 Col. 1.28. Exo. 4.15. Ps. 25.8, ^^. 2 Samuel 22.35. Ps.
18.24. Col. 2.3. Ps. 34.15. 1 Pet. 3.12 1 John 5.14, 15. Mat. 21.22 and 5 42. 1
Jo. 3.12 Mat. 7.7. Luke 6.40. Joh. 16.23 Jam. 1.5. Jam. 1.5, 6 Jam. 4.3. Hos.
2.5, 6, 7. See Buroughs on the place.
Be ye merciful, as your Father also is merciful. God is not soon angry, but
patient and long-suffering, so should his Children be, etc.

X. The Lord God loves such of his Spiritual Children best, who walk closest
with him, who are holy as he is holy, pure as he is pure, who are changed into
his Image, made partakers of the Divine Nature. -- Daniel was greatly beloved,
and David recorded to be a Man after Gods own heart, by way of Eminency; and
John is called the beloved Disciple, after the same manner: For it is agreeable
to Reason and Equity, that where there is the nearest similitude, there should
be the dearest love and Union.

XI. None teaches like the heavenly Father, none more careful to train up and
instruct his Children in right ways: he has given them his holy Word, which is
able to make them wise to salvation; Prophets, Evangelists, Apostles, Pastors,
and Teachers to instruct them, Rules to walk by, Precepts of behavior toward
Enemies and Friends, high and low, rich and poor: I will teach you (says the
Lord) what ye shall do -- He teaches sinners in the way -- He teaches the hand
to war -- it is he only that teaches to profit, Isa. 48.17. In a word, he has
given them the Lord Jesus, in whom are hid all the Treasures of wisdom and
knowledge.

XII. The Ears of the Lord are ever open to the cries of his Children: Ask, and
ye shall receive, etc. whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing ye shall
receive. -- This is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any
thing according to his will, he hears us; and if we know that he hears us,
whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the Petitions that we have desired of
him.

XIII. The Lord God knows what is best for his Children, and never fails to
supply them, if they ask in Faith. -- He never refuses, but when they ask amiss
-- Ye ask, and receive not (says the Apostle James) because ye ask amiss, etc.

XIV. The heavenly Father, when Israel would be going on in a course of
Idolatry and sin, tells them, he will hedge up their way with thorns, and make
a wall, etc. that is, to stop Isreal's pursuit, insomuch that she shall not
overtake her Lovers. As the Lord has a hedge of protection to secure his people
from evil, Isa. 5.5. Job 1.10. so he has a hedge of affliction to keep them
from evil. -- The hedge of thorns is a Metaphor, and signifies much trouble and
difficulty of going over it; and the wall, being a thicker substance, keeps
them from passing through: his sore and heavy afflictions, are but as hedge, in
a way of mercy, to keep his Children from evil, the pursuit of which would
ruin them.

XV. The Lord God in seeming absence or distance from his Children, never
forgets them, Isa. 49.15. Jer. 31.20
but has them in continual remembrance, as in the case of Ephraim.

XVI. The heavenly Father overlooks the frailties and miscarriages of his
Children through Christ, 2 Cor. 8.12. Heb. 8.12. 1 John 1.8. Jer. 3.13.
for he accepts of a willing mind, etc. and highly prizes sincerity. -- He is
merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities will he
remember no more: he is free to pardon the penitent and humble Confessor, Psalm.
32.5.

XVII. What a lamenting Prosopopoeia does the Lord use by the Prophet -- Hear,
O Heavens, Esa. 1.2, 3, 4, 5. etc. Jer. 3.7. Mat. 23.37. Romans 15.5
give ear, O Earth -- I have nourished and brought up Children, and they have
rebelled against me. How great his patience is, and how gently he deals with
them, and how frequent his calls to repentance are* the Scriptures noted in the
Margent clearly evidence.

XVIII. God the heavenly-Father (if his Children be stubborn and perverse)
visits their transgressions with a Rod, and their iniquity with stripes, Mic.
6.13. Psalm. 89.31, 32. Heb. 12.8. and 5, 6, 7. Rev. 3.19. Pro. 11. Jer. 31.18,
19, 20. Isa. 27.7. Isa. 62.9. Heb. 12.10. Jer. 30.11 Hos. 11.9. Isa. 63.9. Romans
8.28
yet takes not his loving kindness from them. -- To be without Chastisement, is
a note of Bastardy, and to be corrected, is a certain sign of Gods love, for
those whom he loves he chastens.

XIX. God the Great Father does the like; My bowels (says he) are troubled
(for repenting Ephraim) I will surely have mercy upon him -- In all their
afflictions he was afflicted -- he chastens for our profit, and corrects in
measure -- he executes not the fierceness of his anger to destroy Ephraim,
because he is God, and not Man; but in love and pity redeems (his Saints) etc.

XX. God lays up for his Children: he not only distributes plentifully of his
good things now, but has much more in store and reversion for them. O how great
is thy goodness (says the Psalmist) which thou have laid up for them that fear
thee! Ps. 31.19.
Henceforth (says the Apostle) is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness,
etc. 2 Timothy 4.8




METAPHOR.
I. EArthly Fathers are men subject to passions, and may sometimes unjustly
harden their hearts, and prove cruel to their Children.

II. Earthly Parents, though Kings and Potentates, are men of little Dignity
and Grandeur, in comparison of the Greatness and Glory of the Almighty.

III. Earthly Fathers may not know the condition of their remote Children, or
may be unable to help them in straits, etc. or send seasonable supplies.

IV. Earthly Parents maybe in a moment made poor, and their Children brought to
Beggary; or by giving may impoverish themselves.

V. Earthly Parents (though they instruct their Children, yet) cannot convert
the heart.

VI. An Earthly Parent cannot so give his Estate, as that all his Children
(collectively considered) may possess all, and yet every one possess the whole,
as if no other had a share in it.

VII. Fathers are mortal, they are Children of yesterday, they pass away, and
leave their Children Fatherless.

VIII. The best of Fathers, are no perfect examples or paterns of goodness, for
their Children may not only equal, but excel them.

DISPARITY.
I. OUr heavenly Father is God, and not Man, and therefore does whatsoever is
good and right, Jer. 31.3.
never wronging any of his Children: In righteousness have thou afflicted me.

II. But our heavenly Father has no Superior in Quality, nor Equal in Dignity:
his Majesty is infinite, and his Glory unspeakable; ten thousand times ten
thousand, Rev. 5.11.
and thousands of thousands of Angels wait upon his Throne, the least of which
excels all the Kings of the Earth.

III. God knows all the wants of his Children, in what place or condition
soever they are in, Phil. 4.19. Isa. 49.8.
and can give them sufficient, suitable, and seasonable relief, though the
powers of Hell and wicked men should be set against them.

IV. God can never be made poor, Esa. 54.10 Psalm. 34.8, 9, 10.
nor is his store the less for distribution -- his Spiritual Children are
beyond all possibility of want.

V. God speaks to the heart, and fastens his Word as a Nail in a sure place:
Hos. 2.14. Ezekiel. 36.26. Jer. 24.7.
he makes the heart of stone to be a heart of flesh; he speaks the Word of
Grace to them, and gives them the Grace of the Word.

VI. God makes every one of his Children joint Heirs of the Eternal
Inheritance; and yet it is so, that every one has the whole propriety, they
shall all possess a Crown and Kingdom of joy and glory jointly, 2 Timothy 4.8.
Romans 8.17 Ps. 73.26. Lam. 3.23
and yet so that every one shall have it wholly to himself, a whole God to
himself, a whole Christ to himself, a whole Heaven to himself, every one has
God for his Portion particularly, and Christ for a Husband, and yet all of them
jointly do enjoy them together.

VII. God is immortal, from everlasting to everlasting; he is called the living
Father, the Father of Eternity, and so incapable of any change: he is a Spirit,
and the Father of Spirits and Life.

VIII. But God is a perfect pattern to all his Children; those Perfections and
Excellencies of the Divine Being that are communicable are set before us for
our imitation, and though we should do our best to be as like him as we can,
yet when we have done all, and gone as high as we are capable to go by the
assistance of Grace, we shall notwithstanding infinitely fall short of that
perfect Copy.



COROLLARIES.
1. FRom the foregoing Parallels we may infer, that Believers (as such) are of
the most glorious and Illustrious Extraction in the world; for the Almighty God
is their Father.

2. That this Spiritual Sonship is the greatest and chiefest of Blessings and
Privileges, because it gives a Title to an Everlasting Kingdom in Heaven.

3. That Saints should be encouraged against doubts, dejectedness, and
dispondency inaffliction, because their Father has provided so glorious an
Estate in reversion for them, and which they shall shortly possess.

4. That Saints have cause to be comforted, for they have a gracious Father
ready to receive all their Applications; and in all cases help, relieve, and
defend them.

5. That it is the duty of Saints to behave themselves suitable to their
quality, and not debase their Birth and Pedigree, nor stain the glory of their
Fathers House by sinful, base, reproachful actions. A sordid employ, and base
Society, do not become a Kings Son.

6. As God is the best of Fathers, so let Christians labor to be the best of
Children.

7. Let them beware how they grieve his Spirit, or provoke him to take the Rod.

8. This may support us under the loss of our nearest and best Relations.

God a Portion.
PSALM. 16.5. The Lord is the Portion of my Inheritance.

PSALM. 73.26. But God is the strength of my heart, and my Portion for ever. See
Jer. 51.12. Psalm. 112.57. Psalm. 142.5.


POrtion (or Inheritance, as the word is read, Genesis 31.14. 1 King. 12.16. and 2 Chronicles. 10.16.) is a Metaphor taken from Earthly Portions or Inheritances, which
shall be considered in a fourfold respect. Viz. 1. Its Nature. 2. Its Extent.
3. Its Signification. 4. Its Usefulness.


And under these Considerations, it affords matter for the ensuing Parallel.

METAPHOR.
I. A Portion, or Inheritance, is a Gift.

II. A Portion, or Inheritance, as it includes Education, and provision of
future maintenance, is the best gift that men can dispose of.

III. A Portion, or Inheritance, is given to advance the honor and interest of
the person on whom it is bestowed.

IV. A Portion, or Inheritance, as it is the best for quality, so the extent
and proportion of it is usually commensurate to the Riches and Estate of the
Donor: a good and great Predecessor, Father, or Benefactor, gives like himself
in quantity, as well as quality.

V. Portion, or Inheritance, implies or supposes Relation: Men do not give
Portions to Foreign Strangers or Enemies, but to Relations that are so
Naturally, or by Adoption.

VI. A Portion, or Inheritance, signifies love and good will to the Subject:
Men never give Portions and Inheritances out of hatred and ill will.

VII. The Gift of Portion and Inheriance, is bestowed on purpose to fix the
Subject to whom it is given in a future settlement of Happiness and Prosperity.

VIII. A Portion or Inheritance frees from that Contempt others are exposed to
that have none; they that have no Portion are acounted poor, beggarly, and
inconsiderable Persons, Men of no Esteem.

IX. A great Portion or Inheritance does not only free from Contempt, but
procures many Friends, (as Solomon speaks) the Rich has many Friends.

X. A great Portion or Inheritance, makes a Man to value himself accordingly,
he will not join in Affinity with any who are not suitable to him, or are much
below him.

XI. A great Portion frees a Man from fear of want, and so elevates his Mind to
a more noble and high degree of living than those that have none.

XII. A Man that has the greatest Portion and Inheritance, will not be
persuaded to change Estates with other Men.

XIII. An earthly Man that has a great Portion, esteems highly of it, as
appears by the Young Man in the Gospel; and as Christ says, Where your
Treasure is, there will your Hearts be also.

XIV. A great Portion or Inheritance, makes way for Entrance into or Alliance
with a great and noble Family.

XV. A great Portion or Inheritance, makes a Man able to do more Good than
multitudes of others can, he can help those he loves; and oftentimes Enemies
receive Advantage by him.

XVI. A great Portion or Inheritance furnishes a Man with whatsoever is good
and desirable here below, yea, with the best of every sort, whether for
Necessity, or to make the Life comfortable; a Man lives upon his Portion, and
reaps whatsoever Good, Profit, or Pleasure it is capable to afford him.

PARALLEL.
I. GOd has given himself to his people to be their Portion for ever. Lam.
3.2^^


II. God, Isa. 49.6. Jer. 7.23. Act. 5.32. 2 Pet. 1.4.
being comprehensive of all spiritual good, is the best gift that can be
received; and when he becomes a Portion to good men, he makes them partakers of
his Divine Nature, gives them his holy Spirit, even the wisdom that is above.

III. God in giving himself unto his people, advances their honor and
interest, and makes them no less than Kings and Princes; for when he makes them
Heirs of God, Romans 8.17 Rev. 5.10. Ps. 45.16.
they then become Joynt-Heirs with Christ -- Instead of thy Father shall be thy
Children, whom thou may make Princes in all the Earth, etc. And have made us
unto our God Kings and Priests, etc.

IV. God who is the greatest, the richest, and most liberal Predecessor,
Father, or Benefactor, always gives like himself in quantity and proportion --
Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it -- Ask, Ps. 80.1. Joh. 16.24 Joh.
14.13, 14, Ephesians. 3.20. 1 Cor. 2.9.
and you shall receive, that your joy may be full -- Ask what ye will, and it
shall be done for you, etc. Even above what you can ask or think -- He does not
only make them to inherit substance, but he fills their Treasury, makes all
grace to abound toward them, and withholds no good thing from them that walk
uprightly.

V. God is not the Portion of Devils or wicked men, who are Enemies and Aliens,
Romans 8.16, 17. Gal. 3.26.
the proud he knows afar off, but he is the Portion of the Righteous, such as
are his Relations by Regeneration or Adoption, if Children, then Heirs -- But
when he shall appear, we shall be like him.

VI. God when he becomes the portion of any man, it is out of love, the
greatest love and good will that ever was expressed: Deuteronomy. 7.7. Ephesians. 3.20. Jer.
31.3.
a love that is admired, because unmeasurable: O the height and length, etc.
What manner of love is this! A love that is great, large, fathomless, without
end.

VII. So God in becoming the Portion and Inheritance of Saints, does design
thereby to fix them in a future settlement of Eternal Happiness and Felicity.
The pure in Heart shall see God, Mat. 5.8. Isa. 61.7. and 45.17.
be with him and enjoy him for ever: Everlasting Joy shall be upon their Heads,
they shall obtain Joy and Gladness, Sorrow and Sighing shall flee away.

VIII. So Saints in having God to be their Portion, are delivered from that
Reproach and Contempt the Holy Scriptures cast upon others ( viz.) on the
Ungodly of the Earth, Rev. 3.
who because they have no Part nor Portion in God, are called poor, blind, and
miserable; whereas the Saints are called honorable, 1 Cor. 4.9. Ps 16.3. Mal.
3.17
and excellent ones, Jabez was more honorable than his Brethren; they are Men
of Name, Princes, God's Treasure, his beloved Ones, his Jewels.

IX. So the Saints having God to be theirs, are not only freed from the
greatest Contempt, and made Honorable Ones, Psalm. 99.11. and 34.7. Heb. 1.14
Pro. 16.7
but thereby come to have many Friends, all the Angels of Heaven are in perfect
Bonds of Peace and true Friendship with them, as well as all Saints on Earth,
who bless and pray for them; nay, many times God makes their very Enemies to be
at Peace with them.

X. So God being a Saint's Portion, it makes him value himself upon the best
and most worthy grounds in the World. (1.) Because he is rich. (2.)
Inconceiveably rich. (3.) Really rich; other Men, great Men of the World are
but seemlying rich* (4.) His Riches and Portion make him really Honorable, 1 John 3.2 Prove. 8.
truly Noble and renow'd in the sight of God, Angels, and Saints. (5.) Because
God has made him so rich and illustrious. (6) Because he cannot be made poor
by Men nor Devils; His Riches are durable.

XI. So when a Saint comes to know that God is his Portion, how does it free
him from fear of want; others have cause to fear they shall beg at Harvest and
have nothing, when he knows what Mines of Treasures are laid up for him against
that day: Psalm. 23.1 Hab. 3.17 Lam. 3.24.
The Lord is my Shepherd, therefore I shall not want; yet will I rejoice in the
Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation; the Lord is my Portion, says my
Soul, therefore will I hope in him.

XII. So a Saint knowing God is his Portion, will not change his Estate with
Kings, and mighty Potentates of the Earth, who are ungodly; Psalm. 84.10. Heb.
11.
I had rather be a Doorkeeper in the House of God, than to dwell in the Tents
of Wickedness. Moses contemned the Glory of Pharoah's Court, by seeing him who
is invisible to be his Portion.

XIII. So he that has God to be his Portion, esteems highly of him; Psalm. 18.1
He loves the Lord with all his Heart, with all his Soul, and with all his
Strength; I will love the Lord as long as I live. Psalm. 73.25.
Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I desire
besides thee? God runs continually in his Mind.

XIV. A Saint having God to his Portion ( viz.) having obtained an Interest in
God through Christ, comes thereby to have Right to Baptism, that initiating
Ordinance into the Church; when he comes, Ephesians. 1.3* and 2.19.
the Door is opened immediately to him into the Heavenly Family and Household of
God.

XV. So a Saint having Interest in God, he is made capable of helping and doing
much Good to others. (1.) By his Prayers; Heb. 13. Acts 11.23. 2 Cor. 1.4. Jam.
5.16. Genesis 39.3 and 30.27. Isa. 1.9.
for the Ears of God are open to his Cries, they are his Delight. What Good did
Israel receive by Moses's Prayer? etc. (2.) By good Counsel. (3.) By comforting
others that are cast down, with the same Comfort wherewith they themselves are
comforted of God. (4.) By helping against Satan, by showing his Devices, etc.
(5.) And by their holy Example and Conversation. The wicked also receive great
Advantage by them, they are the Light of the World, the Salt of the Earth; how
was Laban blessed for Jacob's sake, and the House of Potephar for Joseph's sake?
and what said the Inhabitants of Jerusalem in Isaiah's time, Except the Lord of
Host had left us a very small Remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we
should been like unto Gomorah.

XVI. So a Saint having God to be his Portion, is furnished with whatsoever is
truly good and desirable, viz. 1. Heavenly or divine Life to quicken him; He is
our Life. The Man who has not received the Spirit, lies dead in Sins and
Trespasses. 2. Light to direct them. 3. Wisdom to Counsel them. 4. Power to aid
and assist them. 5. Spiritual Joy to cheer them. 6. Heavenly Bread to feed
them. 7. Glorious Robes to cloth them. 8. Excellent Graces to adorn them. 9.
The Angels to guard and protect them, etc. A Saint lives upon God; he receives
so much of that spiritual Good, Profit, and Delight here from his Portion, that
he is able to take in all that Good God sees necessary for him.



METAPHOR.
THE best of Portions and Inheritances in this World, are earthly and
corruptible.

II. Other Portions are laid up in Reversion for this and that Child, Friend or
Brother, and they have no Benefit of it at present.

III. Other Portions, tho great, yet not infinite, immense, and unsearchable,
the Worth of the greatest earthly Portion may be computed or reckoned up.

IV. Other Portions may be great, and yet not Alsufficient, it cannot supply
the Possessor with whatsoever good thing he needs.

V. Other Portions and Riches here may be good, and yet there is no necessity
of them, Men may be happy without them; worldly Riches are not absolutely
necessary.

VI. All other Portions have their mixtures, they are, as one observes, a
bittersweet: many Snares and Evils attend a Man that has a great Portion of
worldly things.

VII. Other Portions are common to Men, to the vilest of Men; in every Nation
Riches are often given without distinction, Saints and Sinners have them alike.

VIII. Another Portion is not universal, it does not comprehend all good
things; it may lie in Gold, in Silver, in Land, Houses, but not comprehend all
Portions, or all good things whatsoever.

IX. Other Portions may be taken away by Thieves, wasted or consumed by Fire.

X. Other Portions may be great, and yet not suitable in all respects to all
Persons, and at all times; what will Gold or Silver signify to the Soul? what
help can it administer at Death?

XI. Other Portions cannot satisfy the Man that enjoys them, all the World
cannot fill the Soul, nor give full Satisfaction to it.

XII. Other Portions may be spent, a Man by living upon them, may waste them;
the Prodigal Son wasted all his Portion.

XIII. Other Portions are but for a time, they pass away, and Riches are
uncertain things, they are upon the wing, they will not abide for ever.

III. The largest Inheritance cannot make a man absolutely happy.

DISPARITY.
GOD is a Portion immortal and incorruptible, he is the same and changes not;
called often, the Eternal and Immortal God, and so an Immortal Good.

II. God is a present Portion, present Help, a present Support, present Riches,
present Honor; 1 Samuel 1.5.
Thou art my Portion in the Land of the Living.

III. God is an immense, infinite, and incomprehensible Portion, none is able
to account or compute how rich a Saint is; what are all Nations of the World to
him? even less than nothing, and Vanity.

IV. But God is an Allsufficient Portion, in him is a sufficiency of all good
Things a Saint can need; Psalm. 84.11.
no Good will he withold from him that walks uprightly.

V. But God is a Portion that is absolutely necessary; he that has all other
good things and not God, no Interest in him, is miserable, and shall be damned.

VI. But God is a pure unmixt Portion, there is nothing in him but Goodness,
Light, and no Darkness, Joy, and no Sadness, Life, and no Death; and this they
will find when they come to the full Possession and Enjoyment of Him.

VII. But God is a peculiar Portion; he gives himself only to his own People,
to his own Elect; Psalm. 77.26. Lam. 3.24.
He is, (says David) the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever; this
God is our God. The Lord, says a gracious Soul, is my Portion; there is not a
wicked Man in the World can say so.

VIII. But God is an universal Portion, whatsoever is good it is to be had in
him, whether for Profit or Delight, he comprehends all Portions, all things
that are desirable; so he that has God has all, nothing, is good without him,
nothing can be evil that falls upon a Saint that has him; God is good in every
thing, and he is good of himself alone, when every thing else is gone; Having
nothing, 2 Cor. 6.10.
yet possessing all things.

IX. God is a Portion that none can rob the Soul of, no Fire can destroy the
Soul's Inheritance.

X. But God is a suitable Portion to all Persons, in all things, and at all
times; this Portion suits the condition of the Soul, the necessities of the
Soul, the wants and desires of the Soul. Is the Soul blind, naked, sick,
wounded, poor? suitable Supplies in these respects, and all others, are to be
had in him

XI. But God is a Portion that satisfies him who has a part and interest in
him; My Soul shall be satisfied as with Marrow and Fatness: Psalm. 63.5, 6.
He gives the Soul full content and satisfaction.

XII. But God is a Portion that can never be spent: tho the more a Saint lives
upon his Portion, the more rich he is, the more comes in upon him, God is an
unexhaustible Portion.

XIII. But God is a never-failing Portion, he is not only a Portion now, but
will be a Portion hereafter, a present, and yet a future Portion, a Portion
whilst we live, a Portion when we die, and a Portion to Eternity.

III. But God is able to do all things that will make up a full and complete
happiness. Joh. 16.33 Ps. 29.11. 1 Pet. 1.18 Ephesians. 1.13. Ephesians. 4.30.
(1.) He gives peace, and serenity of mind. (2.) Fills with joy and peace in
believing. (3.) Seals up to the day of Redemption. (4.) Sends Angels to rescue
and conduct, and at last lodges safe in the Bosom of Abraham, in a Land of
light and blessed immortality.



COROLLARIES.
1. THis shows the great and wonderful condescension of God in giving himself
to be his Peoples Portion.

2. This shows the great difference between the godly and ungodly, the one are
exceeding rich in the midst of poverty, and the other miserably poor in the
midst of riches; as in the Case of Lazarus, and the Rich Man. Luke 16.


3. It shows how grossly the World is abused by Satan, in esteeming good men to
be poor and miserable; since the meanest of them is born to a Kingdom, and
Heir-Apparent to a Crown, which is but the least part of their Portion neither;
for the height of their Inheritance is the God of the Kingdom.

4. From hence we see the reason why wise and good men slighted the World; for
they had piercing judgments, and could see beyond it, and take a view of that
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, that an interest in this Portion
shall invest them in.

5. From hence we may be informed why God is so much slighted in the World, not
because he is unworthy of chief regard, for he is all excellent: (2.) Not
because he is not sufficiently discovered to be so; for the Heavens declare his
glory: And if a rare piece of Art and Curiosity in a Royal Palace will lead us
to judge it the Product of a brave mind; much more the view of the stately
Canopy of Heaven, and the Marvels of the Creation, will carry our minds to the
Contemplation of the great Creator: But (3.) It Is because of affected and
chosen ignorance, with which Satan strikes; so that men's Damnation is of
themselves.

6. This shows the infinite reasons that sway with good men for the choice of
this Portion, because if they have him, all that is good and desirable is
theirs, and all is nothing without him.

7. This may lead us to enquire who have this God for their Portion. (1.) They
are such as set light by the World, and all things short of him. (2.) Their
thoughts are upon him, and hunger and thirst after him, cleaving to him as the
highest Object. (3.) They make their boast of him, I will make my boast of God.
(4.) They take care to keep him. And (5.) Are resolved to exalt him: O God,
thou art my God, I will exalt thee.

8. This leads us to an useful enquiry after the best way to get this God to be
our Portion, which may be reduced to the following Heads: (1.) It Is necessary
to know how we lost him, viz. by sin. (2.) To remove that that separated from
him -- Let the wicked forsake his way, etc. (3.) By confession and
acknowledgment to sue to him, as the Prodigal did; for he that confesses and
forsakes sin, shall find mercy. (4.) To draw our hearts from Earthly Objects,
which may be evils (though not in themselves, yet) by accident, because we
cannot serve God and Mammon. (5.) We must believe on Christ, and obey him.

9. This should teach us Contentment, since this Portion is enough (2.) Not to
fear Death, because it is but the entrance to a fuller enjoyment. (3.) Not to
repine at others large share of the World, because this Portion infinitely
excels it. (4.) We ought to live upon it, as our proper and peculiar
Inheritance.

God a Habitation.
PSALM. 90.1. (...) Domine habitaculam fuisti nobis in generatione and
generatione. Arias Montan.
Lord, thou have been our dwelling place, (or Habitation) in Generation and
Generation -- (or, in all Generations.) See Psalm. 91.9.

1 JOHN 4.16. (...), etc. Et manens (vel qui manet) in charitate, in Deo manet
-- He that abides (or dwells) in love, dwells in God.


UNder the Metaphor or similitude of an Habitation, or dwelling place, the Lord
God is expressed by the Psalmist in this Text: The words Habitation,
Dewlling Place, and House, are promiscuously used in Scripture, and signify
the same thing; viz. the chief place of residence, or abode; the nature,
usefulness, and convenience of which, the ensuing Parallel demonstrates.

METAPHOR.
I. A Habitation, or House, is a security against extreme and intemperate heat.

II. It is a place of shelter in a tempestuous or stormy season; for when Wind,
Rain, Hail, Snow, Thunder, etc. are like to annoy us, that is a safe retiring
place.

III. It preserves the body from the injuries of excessive cold: It Is a
lamentable thing to be housless and harbourless in a sharp Winter; many have
been benumbed, yea frozen to death that way: Our house is the proper place
where fire is made to warm us.

IV. Our Habitation is the place where our choicest comforts remain; as our
dearest Relations, Company, chief Riches, or Treasure.

V. A Habitation is a place of rest; for there our bodies (when tired by
watching, journeying, or labor) are sweetly reposed.

VI. Our Habitation is our Home; for in other places we are but Strangers and
Sojourners, and exposed to endure many hazards and disorders, which we are safe
from at home.

VII. There must be some certain known way, or passage leading to a Habitation
or house, by which Enquirers may come to it.

VIII. A Habitation or house is a Sanctuary and safeguard against Thieves,
Robbers, and Murderers; it is a man's Castle to secure him and his.

IX. A Habitation has a Door to let into it, which is opened only to such as
are approved Friends.

X. A Habitation or house is adorned with Galleries, and other beautiful
Ornaments, environed with Gardens, Meadows, Pastures, Walks, Fountains, etc.
for pleasure as well as profit, which makes it an excellent and lovely Seat.

XI. It Is Right and Propriety makes a stately Habitation valuable: Passengers
may cast a transient look upon it, but little mind it, because it is none of
theirs.

XII. A house or Habitation is a place of Hospitality, there Friends are
invited, Strangers entertained, and Beggars relieved.

XIII. He that is totally without a Habitation, is accounted to be in a very
desolate and miserable condition, and exposed to all the inconveniences
abovenamed.

XIV. In a Habitation, or great house, are many Lodging-rooms for repose, and
some secret Chambers for security in times of danger.

PARALLEL.
I. GOd secures and defends his people from the rage of Satan, (which is called
his Fiery Darts) and the malice and persecutions of wicked men; for his
protection like a refreshing shade is round about them: Isa. 25.4.
Thou have been a shadow from the heat.

II. God is the Souls chief and only Sanctuary -- When I am afraid, says
David, Ps. 56.3. (...) Ebtach.
I will trust in thee; that is, as the Emphasis of the word bears, I will
retire into thee my blessed Habitation, for thou art a strength to the poor and
needy, and a refuge from the storm -- When the blast of the terrible one is as
a storm against the wall, etc. In the strangest Convulsions of State,
Revolutions of Kingdoms, Isa. 25.4.
and Epidemical Calamities that afflict the World, the Inhabitants of this
blessed Mansion are sure to enjoy certain safety and tranquillity.

III. Such as dwell in this heavenly habitation are preserved from a dead,
frozen, and benumbed frame of spirit, they are made zealous and warm for God,
fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, inflamed with a divine fervor, (by the
influence of the holy Spirit which is called Fire) animating them with courage
and resolution to stand for God and his ways against all opposition.

IV. God is a good man's chief comfort, he is the joy and delight of his Soul:
for as he is the Chief good.
summum bonum in himself, so all good things are radically and originally
derivative from him: therefore such as would partake thereof, must have
recourse to him -- In him is the Saints treasure laid up, with him is the most
desirable Communion: Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none on earth
that I desire besides thee, says David. Ps. 73.25.


V. Such is God to the Soul, thither is the weary and heavy laden sinner
invited, Matthew. 11.27, 28.
in order to receive rest: there is eternal repose (after the troublesome
Pilgrimage of the flesh) in reversion for all that die in the Lord: Return unto
thy rest, O my Soul, says David, etc.

VI. God is a Christians Home: one may be said to be absent from God, when he
strays abroad, giving the full Reins to a loose, carnal and dissolute mind
pursuing the vanities and follies of the world, neglecting the solid comforts
and delights of his proper home, exposing himself to the hazards and disorders
of a strange and dangerous entertainment among his Soul-Enemies; whereas to
live with God, 1 John 4.16.
in a way or spiritual Love and Communion, is to dwell in God, and makes way
for a more immediate and personal participation of his glory after death, which
made the Apostle desire to depart, Phil. 1 21, 22, 23. Because death was gain
to him, inasmuch as it was to state him in his blessed and eternal home.

VII. The Lord Jesus is the way that leads to this heavenly habitation: I am
the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes to the Father but by me: Joh.
14.6
he is a Priest to atone, a King to govern, and a Prophet to teach and direct
his people.

VIII. God is a Sanctuary to his Saints* and a safe retreating place from the
assaults of Satan, sin, and inbred corruption. -- From these Enemies there is
no safety, but by flying to the mercy of God in Christ.

IX Christ is the Door that lets into this heavenly habitation: this Door is
always open to such only as are his known and approved Friends: I am the Door,
Joh. 10.9 Matthew. 11 ^^7.
by me if any man enter he shall be saved: No man knows the Father but the
Son, and he to whom the Son shall reveal him.

X. This heavenly habitation is furnished with all those glorious Ornaments
that are needful for spiritual profit or delight: Gospel Institutions and
Ordinances are by Expositors understood to be the Galleries of this habitation,
where the King is held: In all places where I record my Name, I will come unto
thee, Exodus 20.24.
and I will bless thee -- The blood of Christ is a Fountain of life, Rev. 21.6.
A Fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness, Zach. 13.1. His Church is his
Garden. A Garden enclosed is my Sister, my Spouse, Cant. 4.12. His word as a
green and pleasant pasture, Psalm. 23.2. and his Spirit the Spring that waters
every plant and flower: I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
upon the dry ground -- I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, etc. Isa. 44.3.

XI. It Is an Interest in God that makes a Soul to value him at so high a rate:
Thou art my God, I will praise thee: Thou art my God, Isa. 25.1.
I will exalt thee, Psalm. 118.28. The Lord is my portion, therefore will I hope
in him. Lam. 3.24.


XII. To this heavenly habitation friends are solemnly invited: Hoe every one
that thirsts, come ye to the waters -- and he that has no money come, Isa.
55.1. Mat. 11.28. Act. 11.18 Jam. 1.5. Luke 1.53.
come ye, buy and eat, yea come buy Wine and Milk without mon^^y, and without
price. Now has God granted to the Gentiles (who were Strangers and Aliens)
repentance unto life. This is the receptacle of poor hungry souls, where a
plentiful relief is daily given and freely distributed.

XIII. He that dwells not in God through Christ, is in a very sad and dismal
condition, being exposed to the curs^^ of the Law, and divine wrath; upon the
wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest. Psa.
11.6


XIV. The glorious Attributes of God are as so many retiring Rooms, and places
of security and repose, to which the Saints must have recourse in times of
danger -- Come my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors
about thee, Isa. 26.2.^^
hide thy self as if it were for a little moment, until the indignation be
overpast: More particularly, inasmuch as he is Omniscient, he knows what is best
for us, and we ought to acquiesce in his will -- He is all wise, and therefore
orders all things to work for our spiritual good -- He is Almighty, and can
accomplish, or effectually bring to pass, whatsoever his knowledge dictates for
our good -- He is faithful, and therefore whatsoever he has promised shall be
certainly fulfilled -- He is good and merciful, which is a great encouragement
to sinners to make application to him, and commit themselves to his protection
-- When I am afraid (says David) I will put my trust in thee. He is eternal,
and therefore an Everlasting Salvation, etc.



METAPHOR.
I. A Habitation, (or house) though never so stately and magnificent, is yet
the work and contrivance of a humane Architect, and is composed of perishing
materials.

II. Habitations here below serve only to accommodate the body; the Rich Man in
the Gospel that fared sumptuously every day, Luke 16.9.
had no Habitation for his Soul but Hell, verse 23.

III. A Habitation may be overthrown by an Earthquake, blown down by a Storm,
demolished by an Enemy, consumed by fire, or the decays of time, etc.

IV. A House may secure from some, but not all dangers; for Thieves may rob us
of our Treasure, or an Enemy (if stronger) may dispossess us, and strip us of
that, and all our Estate.

V. A Habitation, in its circumference and dimensions, is limited, and may be
easily filled; neither is any so complete, but may admit of further improvement
or perfection.

DISPARITY.
I. GOd is an everlasting God, has his being of himself, Genesis 21.33.
a most spiritual and immaterial substance, incomprehensible in his Essence,
and so beyond Humane and Angelical Conception. If our earthly house of this
Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, 2 Cor. 5.1
an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

II. But God is a Spiritual Habitation, and accommodates the Soul, or inward
man, with whatsoever conduces to his eternal happiness: he provided a seat in
Abraham's Bosom for poor Lazarus, Luke 16.22
etc. and will receive his Saints into himself where they shall dwell for ever.

III. But God the heavenly Habitation is subject to none of these accidents,
can receive no hurt, and is everlasting -- Yesterday, to day, and for ever the
same, never to be antiquated, and needs no reparation* etc.

IV. But God is a shelter from all kind of spiritual danger; he dwells safely
that dwells in him: Psalm. 91.5, 6, 9, 10.
Thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the Arrow that
flies by day, nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor for the
destruction, etc. because thou have made the Lord which is my refuge, even the
most High, thy habitation, there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any
plague come nigh thy dwelling, etc. Here no Thief can b^^eak thorough, nor Moth
corrupt, nor can the Possessor be turned out by all the Enemies in the world.
Matthew. 6.19, 20.


V. God cannot be circumscribed by any limits, but is infinitely capacious and
receptive of all, that through Christ come to him; and so absolutely perfect,
as that he needs no addition, alteration, or diminution.



COROLLARIES.
1. FRom the foregoing particulars we may infer the necessity of
self-examination, viz. whether we have any Interest in this Heavenly
Habitation; in order to which, the particulars following are presented as the
proper Notes and Marks of a Dweller in God.

(1.) Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given
us of his spirit, 1 John 4.13. which makes men and women heavenly, and
spiritual, and so, fi^^ Inhabitants to dwell there.

(2.) If we dwell in love to God, 1 John 4.16. Deuteronomy. 11.1. then we dwell in
God; for to love him is to keep his Commandments: This love must be with all
our hearts, and to him above all others, for he will have no Competitor.

(3.) If we love one another, God dwells in us, 1 John 4.12. and his love is
perfected in us; if Brotherly love continues among us each to other, it is a
very certain mark that we dwell in this Habitation.

(4.) Sincere confession, and sound belief that Jesus is the Christ, or the
Anointed of God, argues a Child of God, 1 John 5.1. to such this Habitation is
open -- We must believe that he is our Savior, and our Sovereign, a Priest to
atone, a Prince to rule, and a Prophet to teach us, 1 John 4.15. Whosoever
shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, dwells in God, etc.

(5.) A life of Divine Communion and Contemplation is an evident sign of
dwelling in God; such are with him in the Mount, and partake of his blessings,
etc.

(6.) A serious return from wandering, and a hearty Renuntiation of all resting
places short of this, denotes an Interest in this Habitation.

2. From hence we may infer the absolute necessity of a diligent Inquisition,
how we may obtain this Eternal Habitation for our Inheritance, considering how
many Beasts of Prey are watching to devour us, and the impending Storms that
threaten us, in such a day as this is.

3. We may infer the folly and madness of such as take up their rest in the
base and contemptible dwellings of this world, that bid their Souls take their
ease, wallowing in brutish sensuality, and neglecting this holy Habitation.

4. It concerns us to be very circumspect in our walks, that we be not turned
out of Possession, nor lose our hopes and assurance of it. Men are very careful
that the Deeds and Evidences relating to their Earthly Possessions be
Authentic, and safely kept, much more should Christians be so of this Eternal
Mansion.

2. This should keep us from murmuring, if we have not such stately Fabrics as
others to dwell in here, because this Heavenly Habitation (that infinitely
excels all Earthly Structures, though never so glorious) is ours.

3. Let not God lose the glory of so gracious a condescension, in becoming a
Habitation for us -- Let us not slight his infinite love, that provided this
shelter for us, from the danger of the open and unguarded Fields.

4. Let it be an encouragement against slavish fear; to be afraid of Man (who
is a Worm) is to forget where you are.

5. Let sinners be advised to hasten to this resting place, and get an Interest
in this Habitation, else their security is a certain forerunner of
destruction. For, 1. They lie open, and exposed to all sorts of Spiritual
Enemies, and Soul-calamities, from the Devil, wicked men, and innate
corruption. 2. Now there is an opportunity, let it be taken hold of, or else
the day of Grace may be past, and the Market ^^ver, without possibility of
recalling it. 3. Christ stands with his Arms spread to receive them, he is an
open Door to let them in, and partake of the joys and glory of this house, etc.
4. It is a most unnatural cruelty to their own Souls; for if they slight it,
they become Self-Murderers, and Instruments of their own Damnation. 6. Lastly
From what has been said, we may infer the superlative happiness of good men,
whose Habitation the Great God is; for they shall be safe there from all kinds
and degrees of danger and disturbances, made Partakers of whatsoever is good
and desirable, and that for EVER AND EVER.


God an Husbandman.
JOHN 15.1. My Father is an Husbandman.


IN this Metaphor four things are implied or supposed.

1. That an Husbandman must have ground to work upon. (...) a husbandman is
compounded of (...) terra earth, and (...) opus work; that is, one that works
the earth. The latin Agricola signifies A tiller of the Field of Ager, and Colo.
2. A Stock to Defray the charges and expense requisite to manage it. 3. Skill
and Knowledge to perform it. 4. Instruments, and whatsoever else is needful for
such an Undertaking, or Employment.
In these Respects God may be said to be an Husbandman, because 1. He is a Rich
Husbandman; For all the world is -- the earth is the Lords, etc. 2. A great and
honorable Husbandman; For all Bow before him. 3. A skilful and wise
Husbandman; For none can teach him. 4. A diligent and careful Husbandman; For
no neglect can be charged upon him. 5. A generous and liberal Husbandman; For
all partake of his Bounty. For a further illustration take the following
Parrallel.


METAPHOR.
I. A Rich Husbandman has not only fruitful Fields, Vineyards, Gardens,
Orchards, etc. But also some barren Heaths, Commons, and Wildernesses.

II. A rich Husbandman has many Beasts, some of which are of a hurtful and
mischievous nature, which he fetters or ties up, restraining them by some
invention or other from doing injury to his other Cattle, and breaking into his
Gardens or Orchards to spoil his precious flowers and tender plants.

III. A Husbandman puts some of his Cattle into fat pastures to feed and fatten
them against the day of slaughter.

IV. A husbandman expects not that return and increase of precious and
profitable fruit from the dry heath and barren Wilderness, as from the rich
Valleys, Gardens, Fields, Vineyards, etc. which he has bestowed much cost and
labor upon in manuring, sowing, planting, watering, dressing, etc.

V. A husbandman divides and separates his land, Deu. 27.17 Pr. 22.28
(especially that which he designs for tillage and principal use) from other
men's. Every one knows his own land, and to this end they have landmarks and the
like, by which propriety is preserved.

VI. A husbandman does not only divide and separate the land that he designs
for special use, whether Orchard, Field, or Vineyard, Non minor est virtus quam
querere, parta tueri.
from all other; but also makes a Fence or Wall about it, especially if it be
taken out of a waste Wilderness or a barren and common Heath or Field,
otherwise the fruit might soon be eaten up or trod down by the Beasts of the
Field.

VII. When a Husbandman has Fenced or Walled in his ground, he digs or plows
it up, in order to the manuring of it, and making it good soil, fit for the use
intended, whether for choice grain, plants, or other things.

VIII. A husbandman finds some ground more hard, stony and barren than others,
and what the Plow cannot break up, the Spade and Mattock must; If it be very
rocky, a Hammer is used to break it in pieces.

IX. A husbandman finds by experience that no ground till it be well manured
and Planted, brings forth any thing but what naturally grows of it self. Choice
plants must be set, and seed must be sown if we will expect fruit.

X. When a Husbandman has ploughed or dug up his Field, he discovers the
nature and quality of the ground; and finds much Filth, Worms, Weeds, and
loathsome trash are turned up, which before lay hid; so that we many times
wonder, that land so fair in appearance should prove so naught.

XI. The husbandman takes much pains and bestows great Cost to make his barren
ground fruitful, and destroy those hurtful Weeds which would Choke the seed,
deprive it of nourishment, and so spoil its growth -- He also lays on much Dung
to fertilize it and make it yield the greater Crop.

XII. Though the husbandman does not find his ground immediately so good and
fruitful, as to Answer his just expectation considering his labor and cost
about it; yet for all that he gives not over, nor slacks his hand, as if it
would never be good; but on the contrary pursues his endeavor, in hopes that
what fails in one year, may be effectual in another.

XIII. The husbandman grudges not at the cost he is at, to make his ground
fruitful, but does it with a willing mind and very cheerfully.

XIV. A husbandman sees when his field is plowed and sowed, that it must be
watered with the dew of Heaven, or it will not thrive. The Earth cannot bring
forth, unless the Heavens distill their precious drops, and refreshing showers
upon it -- therefore he prays for rain, and if it rains not, he opens his
sluices to water his Meadows and other low Ground to make it fructify.

XV. The husbandman finds that low Grounds, Valleys and Meadows by Rivers sides
are most fruitful; whereas Mountains, Heaths and Hilly grounds, how lofty
soever they seem, are commonly barren and unfruitful: And though they may for a
time bring forth, yet by the scorching heat of the Sun, and for want of
moisture by which it should take deep root, it is so parched and burnt that it
rarely (if at all) comes to maturity.

XVI. A husbandman takes much pains to weed his Gardens and prune his Trees,
and if he finds the weeds come up thick, especially such as are of a hurtful
and mischievous kind, he uses all ways and proper means to destroy them, lest
they should spoil the fruit of his Garden, Field, or Vineyard, etc. Yet
notwithstanding some relics of the old roots are left, which are apt to
spring up afresh, unless continually cropped off and kept short.

XVII. A husbandman, in consideration of all his labor and charge, expects
fruit answerably from his husbandry. Jam. 5.7.


XVIII. A husbandman often goes to see the success of his labor and how his
Corn and other Plantations thrive, and is much delighted and comforted to find
a good increase and fair hopes of a great Crop; to reward his pains. How he
rejoices, when he finds every Vine full of thick Clusters, every Tree laden
with Fruit, and the Valleys covered with precious Corn?

XIX. The husbandman is exceedingly grieved, when, (on the contray,) he finds
his fields barren or blasted, and his hopes of a plentiful harvest disappointed.

XX. When the husbandman finds many Trees and Branches barren, or without sap
or life, after all the means he has used, he cuts them down for fuel, because
they should not cumber the ground, nor hurt others.

XXI. A husbandman has many Servants which he employs to work in his Vineyard,
or as Laborers in his Harvest.

XXII. A husbandman that has in his house, a faithful, labourous, an
experienced servant, highly prizes him, he is esteemed above any that are
unskilful, slothful, or negligent in their business.

XXIII. The husbandman oftentimes finds his pleasant trees, choice plants, and
fruitful fields annoyed and greatly damnified by Catter-pillars, and other
hurtful Vermin.

XXIV. When the husbandman finds his Fields or Vineyards quite barren, and that
no manuring will help, but thorns, briars and weeds abound, he plucks up the
hedges and lets it lie fallow and common to all.

XXV. A husbandman Fans or Winnows his Corn to sever the Chaff from the Wheat.

PARALLEL.
I. GOd Almighty is a very rich husbandman -- The Earth is the Lords and the
fuln^^ss thereof. He has many fruitful Fields, Vineyards, Ps. 89.11.
etc. where the Gospel is professed -- And many barren Heaths, Mountains and
Wildernesses* the Pagan, Heathen, an unconverted parts of the World, which
yield little or no profit.

II. God lays claim to all the Beasts of the Field, the wild and devouring
Beasts of the Forest. Ps. 50.11, Ps. 13.1. Eze. 138.4.
Every beast of the Forest is mine (says the Lord,) and the Cattle upon a
thousand Hills -- The Fowls of the Mountains and the wild beasts of the field
are mine. No man be he never so brutish, vile, and mischievous* but by right of
Creation is the Lords, though strangely degenerate from what he was and should
be; such he fetters, chains and ties up, that they cannot destroy the poor. The
oppressors, persecuters and spoilers of the Earth, would soon break in and
spoil Gods vineyard* but that the Lord puts hooks into their Jaws, Ps. 89.11.
and puts bounds to them which they cannot pass.

III. God suffers the wicked to feed in fat Pastures, to wallow in plenty, Jer.
46 21 James 5.5. Ps. 17.14. Lu. 16.25.
eating the fat and drinking the sweet of the Earth, but it is for the day of
slaughter -- such as have all their good things here.

IV. The Lord does not expect, that Heathens, and Infidels (who are like dry
and barren ground) should bring forth or yield him so much increase and fruit
of grace and holiness as those people and nations to whom he has afforded his
blessed Gospel, Lu. 12.14. Chapter 16.10. Mar. 12.42 Rev. 3.8.
and those Churches that he has planted and bestowed much cost and pains upon.
Where much is given a suitable improvement is required, and where but little
the improvement of a little.

V. God separates his people from all the people of the world, Deuteronomy. 7.7. 2
Cor. 6.17 Rev. 18.4. Ps. 4.3. 2 Timothy 2.19 Deu. 33.16 Hos. 7.8. Is. 27.2.3. Is.
5.2. Is. 4.5. Zech. 2.5. Ps. 18.2. Job 1.10. Ps. 125.2. Ps. 34.7.
to be a peculiar inheritance unto himself. There they have bounds set them,
viz. Holy laws and institutions, within which they ought always to keep that
they mix not themselves with the world; to pass which bounds is a high and
provoking evil.

VI. God Almighty takes special care of his Church, and of every branch and
member thereof. And for their preservation has made a hedge a fence, yea a
glorious Wall round about them: This the Devil knows, and nothing troubles him
more, have thou not made a hedge about him, and about all that he has? See
more in the Metaphors of a Garden and Vineyard.

VII. The Lord does by his word plow up the fallow ground of our hearts. When
he threatened spiritual Judgments upon Israel (his ancient Vineyard) he says by
the Prophet it shall not be dug, Isa. 5.6.
but there shall come up briars and thorns. Luke 13.8
Before our hearts are dug up, they lie fallow: Break up your fallow ground.
And sow not among thorns. Hos. 10.12


VIII. The Lord finds all our hearts naturally very hard, yet some more hard
and obdurate than others. And that he may effectually break them into pieces he
uses diverse Instruments; some of his Ministers come with the smooth plow of the
Gospel -- Others with the Ma^^tock of the law from Mount Sinai. Is. 7.25. Jer.
23.29
Some denounce the threatenings in Gods word, like a hammer to break the Rock in
pieces.

IX. The Lord shows us in his word that no Persons whatsoever can bring forth
good and acceptable fruit, till by the word and spirit of grace they are
wrought upon, Jo. 3.6. Cha. 1.4. Romans 7.4.
and planted or sown by him.

X. When God has through his word and holy spirit broken up the sinners heart
by powerful convictions* so that the inside of the soul is (to its own sight)
as it were turned outward, as in the case of the woman of Samaria who cried
out, Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did; John 4.29
and as 'twas with the Jews Peter preached to, Act. 2.37. Romans 7.
who cried out what shall we do? Then the filthiness of the soul and its horrid
pollution appears, and the poor man cries out, I did not think there had been
so much abomination in my heart, that I had been such a Rebel against God. O
the pride, the lust, the blasphemy, hard heartedness, vanity, folly and
unbelief I find there; who could think I had such a prodigy of wickedness?

XI. The Lord takes great pains, uses many ways, and bestows great cost to
make his People bring forth fruit unto him; he sends his word, his spirit, Isa.
5.4. Gal. 4.6.
his Ministers, sets Conscience on work and if all will not do, but that weeds
of Corruption still spring, and roots of bitterness remain, he sends
afflictions to humble and cleanse them, and destroy the power of sin.

XII. Though the blessed God sees his people do not Answer his unwearied pains,
but that abundance of earthliness* barrenness, and unprofitableness still
remains in them, yet be gives them not over, but with much patience waits year
after year, not sparing continual labor in order to their Reformation, Joh.
15.^^. Hos. 11.9.
that so they may bring forth more fruit unto him.

XIII. The Lord bestows his choicest mercies upon his heritage with the
greatest cheerfulness -- I will rejoice over them to do them good, Jer. 32.41 1
Cor. 2.12 Is. 5.4.
and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart, etc. it is
freely given, and without grudging he has done as much as could be done to his
Vineyard.

XIV. The Lord God knows that though the Church (his spiritual Vineyard) be
sowed with good seed and planted with choice plants; yet they cannot grow nor
prosper unless watered from heaven with Divine showers and refreshing dew. And
therefore God opens the sluices or windows of heaven, and makes the Fruits of
the earth flourish and wonderfully increase; the rain, etc. waters the earth
and makes it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread
to the eater, etc. Is. 5.7.


XV. The Lord declares in h^^s word that the lowly and humble soul is the most
fruitful. Christ says he went down to see the fruits of the Valley, Cant. ^^.11
his chief expectation is from them that lie low in their own sight. Trees
planted by the watercourse thrive best and bring moist fruit. The rain glides
off from Hills and Mountains, and the Valleys receive it. The lofty, proud,
self-conceited person is barren and fruitless, the savor of Gods grace abides
not on their hearts To this man will I look that is poor and of a contrite
spirit; he that sees its own emptiness, and has no confidence in the flesh, but
whose trust and dependency is upon Christ, is the thriving and fruitful person,
that (like the tree by the waterside spreading his roots by the River) shall
not see when heat comes; but his leaf shall be green, Jer. 17.8.
and he shall not be careful in the year of Drought.

XVI. The Heavenly husbandman bestows much pains that he may destroy the weeds
of indwelling sin and corruption in his people. He uses various means, as his
word and holy spirit, trials, afflictions, etc. in order to that end; by these
he digs up those weeds by the roots, as worldly mindedness, unbelief, and
sensual lusts, which else would choke the good seed, though some remains of
them are left behind (to keep us humble and watchful) such ill weeds grow apace
and are ready to spring up when the least liberty is given. He. 12.15.
By these also this blessed husbandman prunes and pares of suckers or
superfluous branches, which ^^eed upon that sap which should nourish his tender
plants, such are, carnal divisions, strife and unnecessary contention among
Saints, busying themselves about idle and unprofitable notions, or matters of
slender consequence, neglecting in the mean time those serious and practical
parts of Christianity which are of absolute and undoubte^^ nec^^ssity: these
are the spiritual suckers of our time, and are the cause that so many lean and
barren souls are found in this spiritual Vineyard.

XVII. The Heavenly husbandman waits for the fruit of his fields also. He
looked, that it, (viz. his ancient vineyard) should bring forth grapes, Isa.
5.2. Isa. 5.2. Luke 13.7. Mat. 21.34
Went three years? seeking fruit on the fig tree, etc. And wh^^n the time of
fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive
the fruits of it, etc. Where God sows plentifully he expects a suitable crop,
where much is given, much is required, where we have many means of increase of
grace, the Lord will expect the fruits of holiness from his people.

XVIII. The Lord loves to visit his vineyard often, Can 6.2. Cant. 4.16. Ps.
149.4.
and delights to behold the flourishing graces of his people- He is gone Down
into his garden, into his beds of spices, etc. He eats his pleasant fruit, he
takes pleasure in his Saints, and will beautify the meek with salvation. Let
us see (says he) if the vine flourish, Cant. 7.12
whether the tender grape appears* and the pomegranat^^s bud forth: there will
I give thee my loves. He rejoy^^es to find his people abound with graces, which
are the blessed fruits of the spirit, no Ambrosia so sweet to this heavenly
husbandman, as the holy performances of his Saints, which is the effect of his
own cost and labor.

XIX. The Lord expresses great grief when his people bring forth no fruit, or
which is worse, wild fruit -- he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and
it brought forth wild grap^^s. Is. 5.2. Eze. 19.10 12, 14. Hos 9.6.
How he complains by the Prophet -- She (viz. the vineyard Jerusalem) was
plucked up in fury -- the East wind dri^^d up her fruit -- Fire has devoured
her fruit, this is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentation. How it grieves
the Lord to the heart, when his servants (his Ministers,) return this account
we have labored in vain, Is. 49.4.
and spent our strength for naught* etc.

XX. When the Lord finds any barren or withered branch in his husbandry past
hope of recovery, he cuts them (...)* Joh. 15.2.
every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away. Christ cursed the
fruitless f^^g tre^^ and immediately it was dri^^d up: this cutting off may be
done by the immediate hand of God, ^^ith -- in Spirituals or Temporals* or by
the censure and excommunication of the Church.

XXI. God h^^th also many workmen in his Churches, diverse painf^^l laborers in
his harvest; Mini^^ers of the Gospel are spiritual harvest men. 2 Cor. 6.1.
We then as Workers together with you, beseech you also that ye receive not the
grace of God in vain.

XXII. A faithful experienced and laborious Minister the Lord values above
thousands of slothful, Number. 14.14.
false hearted, and self seeking ones, who care not for the flock, so they have
the fleece, and if they have the wages care not for the work. Number. 16.32.
Moses was faithful in his house, and therefore esteemed: but Corah and h^^s
Company, (that fain would have been looked upon as appointed by God like Moses)
were swallowed up.

XXIII. The Church of God often suffers, and is much spoiled by those
innumerable swarms of Locusts or Catterpillars that came out of the bottomless
pit, by which, according to the opinion of diverse eminent Writers, are meant
the great swarms of Popish Priests, Friars Monks, Jesuits, and even all the
whole tribe of the Romish Hierarchy, who are fitly likened to Locusts, which,
as Naturalists say, are a little vile kind of vermin that spring out of smoke,
flying together in vast numbers, gnawing, eating up or destroying all green
things and fruits of the ea^^th, being a very slothful and idle creature,
resembling the Popish Clergy exactly* who are bred out of the smoke and
darkness of hellish ignorance; they are slow bellies living upon the sweat of
other men's brows. To such Kingdoms or Countries as abound with pleasant plants
they flock in swarms, where they make havoc and lay wast all green things in
the Church of God (as this and other Nations have felt and still feel)
infecting thousands with their damnable devices, superstitious practices and
inventions. Rev. 9.3.


XXIV. When God finds a Church or people without the life and power of grace
and religion* cold and lukewarm, Rev. 3.16. Rev. 2.5. Jer 7.12.
having only the Carcass of external profession* and that no calls nor
endeavors will reclaim them, he withdraws his presence, removes his
Candlestick, takes away the hedge and lays it waste -- Go to my place in Shilo
where I set my name at first, and see what I did to it for Israel 's
wickedness. So Sardis, Ephesus Smirna, Philadelphia, etc. and the rest of those
once famous Asiatick Churches, are become a barren and waste Wilderness.

XXV. The Lord by his word and spirit (which is as a fan in his hand) severs
the chaff and refuse part of his Children, Mat. 3.12. Jer. 15.7. Amos 9.9, 10.
that nothing but the pure grain and seed of grace may remain in them, and
oftentimes by affliction winnows his Church, Severing the true Christian from
the dross and chaff of hypocrisy -- I will sift the house of Israel -- as Corn
it sifted in a sieve, etc.



METAPHOR.
I. SOme husbandmen hire their ground, and pay Rent for what they have.

II. A husbandman maybe dispossessed of his farm and turned out of all his
estate, by an enemy, or the injustice of a party stronger than himself.

III. The husbandman thrives or grows poor, a^^cording as his husbandry gives
good or bad returns.

IV. Husbandmen often faint, and grow weary of working.

V. Husbandmen know not the success and event of their labor, nor the nature
of some ground till they try it.

VI. Husbandmen cannot rain to water their fields; it is God that gives the
increase for which their dependence must be* upon him.

VII. The husbandman cannot make bad trees bring forth good fruit, nor barren
trees bear, nor some sort of ground good let him do what he can.

VIII. Storms, Tempests, excessive Rain, Snow, Heat or Cold often force the
husbandman to a cessation of his labor, and an enemy may compel him from his
work.

IX. A husbandman grows old, and dies, and leaves his husbandry.

DISPARITY.
I. BUt God is the proprietor and proper owner of all the Nations and people of
the Earth* Job 41.
whatsoever is under the whole heavens (says the Almighty) is mine.

II. God cannot be dispossessed, or turned out of his inheritance; for no
strength or power is able to stand before him: none can oppress him, or take
his right from him, against his will -- he can destroy at once all that rise up
against him.

III. God, though he lays out very much to cultivate a Nation, Church, or
People, is never the poorer his treasure is inexhaustible, and can receive no
addition nor diminution. Job. 22.23 Ps. 16.2.
Can a man be profitable to God? My Goodness (says David) extends not to thee.
All that he does, is for his Creatures profit.

IV. God in a proper sense cannot be weary, therefore in Scripture when we read
of his being weary, it is spoken (by the figure (...)) after the manner of men,
by way of condescension to our capacities, after much patience and forbearance;
and finding no fruit, he is said to be weary, not properly but as before -- the
everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the Earth faints not,
neither is weary. Is. 40.28.


V. But God knows all things, the hearts and spirits of all men -- he knows
what nation or people will prove fruitful or otherwise, before his word and
spirit are employed to cultivate and try them.

VI. God can cause it to Rain when he pleases externally upon the earth; and
spiritually upon his people: he can cause his precious dew to distill upon the
tender herb, and showers of rain to fall upon the grass.

VII God can make the vilest and worst of sinners to bring forth good fruit,
when his grace converts them, and the barrenest souls to be fruitful souls.

VIII. None can hinder the Almighty from his labor -- I will work and who
shall let it. Isa. 43.13.


IX. God the spiritual husbandman, never grows old, and can never die, but is
ever taking care of his husbandry.



COROLLARIES.
1. THis shows the wonderful condescension of the great and Almighty God in
comparing himself to an husbandman, an Employment of great toil and very hard
labor, yet profitable and honest.

2. Shows the great privilege, dignity and security of the Church of Christ,
being the plantation of the great God, in which he takes delight; the rest of
the world being like a barren and howling Wilderness to it -- Woe is me that I
sojourn in Mesech and dwell in the Tents of Kedar. Ps. 120.5.


3. It shows the necessity of being truly grafted into this vineyard; a bare
profession will not do, as in the foolish Virgins case -- he has a quick eye,
and will soon find out such as bear no fruit, or are rotten at heart, such he
cuts down and burns.

4. Here Is cause of joy to those that are truly implanted into Jesus Christ,
they are under his special care and watch, they shall flourish, and bring forth
fruit in old age -- Walled in on every side, and so very safe. Joh. 15.2. Ps.
92.13, 14.


God a Builder.
Psalm. 127.1. Except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build
it.

Prove. 9. Wisdom has built her a House.

Heb. 3.4. But he that built all things is God.


IN these Scriptures, and many others, God is called a Builder, which is a
Metaphor taken from Carpenters and Masons, that build Houses: The Hebrew word
by which Building is expressed, is derived from the Root (...) (...).
aedificavit, extruxit Domum vel Vrbem, to build or rear a House or City, 1
Kin. 10.4. Metaphorically, it is put for Procreation and Education of Children,
of which Families are as it were built, Genesis 16.2. (2.) For repairing decayed
Places, 1 King. 12.25. (3.) For the Restoration, Preservation, and Exaltation
of God's People, Jer. 31.4. The Greek word, (...), preparo, instruo, to prepare
or build up, is (as Illyricus says) a military Word, and signifies (vasa
instrumentaque castrensia colligere) the gathering together of Vessels or
Vtensils of the Camp, of (...) and (...), a Vessel. God may be said to be a
Builder, in a fourfold respect.

1. He created or built the visible World. 2. He built or constituted the
Church Militant. 3. The Church Triumphant. 4. The Invisible World, the
Celestial City, or New Jerusalem, for the Church Triumphant to inhabit, when
the visible World is dissolved.
In a Builder we are to consider three things, viz. Skill, Strength, Action: 1.
Skill to contrive; 2. Strength to provide; and, 3. Action to complete: All
which are fairly applicable to God as a Builder, as appears in the following
Particulars.

Metaphor.
I. A Builder is an Artist, a Man of Wisdom, to contrive the fittest Model of
the Whole in general, and of the distinct Rooms and Parts in particular.

II. A Master Builder usually has a principal or Head-Workman, to whom he
imparts his Secrets in his great and weighty Contrivances, who is to enter upon
the chiefest part of the Work; and not only to work himself, but to order and
direct all subordinate Workmen.

III. A Master Builder has the Figure or Idea of the Materials in his Mind, of
which the Fabric is to be compacted, and gives Order for the bringing them
forth, to answer his great Project and Design.

IV. A wise Master Builder lays a Foundation, to set that Fabric upon, that he
intends to build for a House. City, or any kind of Edifice, which cannot stand
without it, as Christ tells us.

V. A Builder puts his Workmen into Order, and his Materials into their proper
places; the Stone, Brick, Timber, Lead, Iron, Brass, Silver, etc.

VI. A Builder raises Fabrics of several sorts: some of higher Consideration
and Grandeur than others, as Temples, the Palaces and Thrones of Princes, Noble
and Great Men's Houses, inferior Dwellings, and dismal Prisons.

VII. A Builder gives Ornament, as well as Form and Being, to a House.

VIII. A Builder is a great Benefactor to the World, in making Places both for
Safety and Convenience.

IX. A Builder is pleased with his Work, when finished, and is worthy of Honor
for it.

Disparity.
I. GOD, the first Founder and! Builder of all things, is that great Master of
Wisdom, of whom it is said, that he finds out knowledge of witty Inventions,
that he is wise, and perfect in knowledge; that his Wisdom is unsearchable, and
his Ways, Contrivance, and Projections past finding out, in his Works of
Creation, as well as Providence; for not Man only is fearfully and curiously
made, but all his other Works so well contrived, that it is not possible for
any to mend them: In Wisdom have thou made them all.

II. God, the infinite and most wise Contriver, has his Word or Son, who is
called the Wisdom of God, and a wonderful Counselor, to be his Head-Workman,
who was in the Bosom of the Father, and understood all his Secrets, by whom he
made the Worlds, who is called the Son, the Character, Image, or Representative
of God, without whom there was nothing contrived or made, that was made; either
things in Heaven, or things on Earth, visible or invisible, whether Thrones,
Dominions, or Principalities; all things were made by him, and he was before
all things, and from him came Order and Direction to all subordinate or
secondary Causes.

III. God, the Builder of all things, had the Idea in his own Mind, and gave
Order for the bringing of them forth, in order to suit his most wise and
wonderful Purposes: for as known to God are all his Works from the beginning,
so he said, Let the Heavens, the Earth, the Water, the Air appear; and they did
so.

IV. God, this great and wise Master Builder, has planted the Heavens above,
and laid the Foundations of the Earth beneath: which when we consider, that
they have no bottom, but the Air and the Water, we must resolve it into his own
Power, which can do every thing, or his Word or Son, who bears up the Pillars
of the Earth, and upholds all things: He looked for a City which has
Foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God.

V. The God of the whole Earth did at the first put all Materials into their
proper places, and assigned all his Servants their respective Work; the Heavens
above the Air, the Air above the Earth, and the Earth above the Waters. Christ
is Head-Workman above Angels, Angels above Men, Men in Work and Business above
the Fowls of the Air, Beasts of the Field, creeping Things of the Earth, Fishes
of the Sea. Men above one another, in respect of his Church, (his spiritual
Building) Moses above Joshuah, and ordinary Prophets; Aaron above other
Priests; Apostles above Evangelists, and ordinary Ministers: And all to show
his wonderful Skill and Wisdom. Angels to keep his Commands, and sing Praise;
the Heavens to declare his Glory, and the Firmament to show his handy Works.
Moses to manifest Wonders on Earth, Aaron to celebrate his Worship, John
Baptist to set forth Jesus, the Apostles to plant Churches, and preach the
Gospel to Jews and Gentiles. -- Elders of a lower Rank; -- Apollo, and
Evangelists: All which have their peculiar Work and Place assigned, by the
great Architect of the whole Universe.

VI. God has set his Stories in the Heavens, Amos 9.6. Heb. 12.22, 23, 24.
where his glorious Majesty dwells, and Jesus, our great High Priest, sits at
his right hand; where all the Angels are seated in Glory, and the Spirits of
just Men made perfect surround the Throne of God and the Lamb: 1 Pet. 3.19, 20.
Jud. 6.13. Isa. 30, 33.
The Earth for Men: The dismal Prisons and Regions of Darkness, for disobedient
Spirits, and evil Angels.

VII. God has not only beautified the Meek with Salvation, but adorned New
Jerusalem, where the Saints shall dwell, Rev. 21.18, 19, 20.
with so high and Soul-ravishing Excellencies, as the most sublime Rhetoric
can set forth: as Gold, Pearl, Diamonds, and other precious Stones; the Street,
pure Gold; the Building of the Wall, Jasper; the Foundations, precious Stones;
and the Gates, Pearls.

VIII. God is a great Benefactor, who has made Buildings both for Safety and
Convenience: He made the Fountains to contain the great Deeps, to keep them
from breaking out upon the World; he has made Windows in Heaven, to keep the
Waters above from falling down too furiously, to the prejudice of Man and
Beast: He has made Chambers, to keep in the roaring Winds, from annoying
Mortals with constant and impetuous Blasts: The raging Element of Fire he has
confined to its proper Region, where it cannot harm us without his permission.
He has given us a pleasant and fruitful Earth, a comfortable and refreshing
Air, a beautiful and delightful Heaven, which he has placed as a Canopy over
us. -- He has constituted a good and holy Church, which is as a Wine-Cellar to
supply all our Wants, where he has placed the Word, the Spirit, the Ordinances,
good Counsel and Instructions, suitable Comforts and Consolations; there is the
Wine, the Oil, the Balm, the Bread, where he feeds his Lambs, and makes his
Flocks to rest at Noon, satisfying with Favor, and filling with the Blessings
of his Bounty: He will abundantly bless Sion's Provision, etc.

IX. God is pleased with his Work, when finished: Genesis 1.31.
He looked upon all things which his Hand had made, and behold it was very
good. -- He is worthy of Honor for what he has done, because they are great
things, mighty things, wonderful things, without number: So that it might be
said, as David, O give thanks to the Lord, who by his Wisdom made Heaven: Let
all the Host of Heaven, Psalm. 136.3, 5.
and all the Inhabitants of the Earth, praise, etc.



Metaphor.
I. AN earthly Builder is but a mortal Man, subject to Weakness and Death.

II. The earthly Builder has but a small pittance or measure of Skill and
Wisdom; it is but the Wisdom of a Son of Man, as light as Vanity, and next to
Foolishness.

III. Earthly Builders are fain to pause, study, and consider, before they
bring forth their Devices.

IV. The earthly Builder must have Materials to work upon, and Servants to
employ.

V. An earthly Builder cannot effect his Purposes in point of Building, by his
Word, without Work and Labor.

VI. The earthly Builder must have much time allowed him to finish a great and
famous Fabric.

VII. An earthly Builder lays the Foundation of his Work upon a brittle
substance, or at best upon a Rock, which is capable of Dissolution.

VIII. An Earthly Builder builds but little, comparatively, as some Towns,
Cities, or part of them, etc.

IX. An earthly Builder may be outdone by a Successor.

X. An earthly Builder builds for other Men, all being not for himself.

XI. An earthly Builder is capable of Improvement in his Skill; for Experiment,
and second Thoughts, instruct him in some Points he was before ignorant of.

XII. An earthly Builder oft-times undoes what he has done, plucks it down to
make it better.

Disparity.
I. GOD, the heavenly Builder, is a mighty God, the everlasting and everliving
God, with whom is no beginning of Days, nor end of Life.

II. The heavenly Builder has all the Treasures of Wisdom, he is full of
Wisdom and Knowledge, he is essentially wise and skilful, and gives all the
Wisdom and Skill, that is possessed, enjoyed, or used by Men or Angels: It Is
unsearchable, past finding out, beyond all comprehension, so profound, that
Angels are Fools in comparison of him: -- He charges his Angels with Folly. Job
4 18.


III. The heavenly Builder (having all Wisdom and Knowledge) sees by one Act,
(uno intuitu) all things that are necessary and commodious, and needs not to
suspend Actions till after Study and Consideration, nor stay for any one to be
his Help and Counselor, because there is none able or fit to teach him: Who
has been his Counselor? etc.

IV. The heavenly Builder can make Matter fit for his purpose, where he finds
none; even as all Things that are seen, Genesis 1.1. Heb. 11.2.
were not made of things that do appear, but of Matter that was void of Form,
of which there was no pre-existence, but it was made out of nothing, and then
formed into a glorious Globe, Psalm. 136.4, 5.
and most beautiful Fabric, by him, who alone (that is, without the help of
any other) does great Wonders; that by Wisdom made the Heavens, etc.

V. God does all by a word of his Mouth. -- Let there be a Heaven, and
immediately it appears; let there be an Earth, and it was so, etc. as Genesis 1.

VI. But God does his Works, which are exceeding, in a moment; He just
pronounces the word, and it is done.

VII. But the heavenly Builder laid his Work upon a sure and unshaken
Foundation, upon an impregnable Rock, firm and immovable against all violence
whatsoever, viz. his own Almightiness, than which nothing can be more
permanent, etc. Heb. 1.3. Psalm. 104.5


VIII. The heavenly Builder has been the Erector of the whole Fabric of the
Universe: He that built all things is God. Heb. 3.4.


IX. But none can mend the Work of God, nor take the Glory from him: His Works
shall praise him for ever, etc. Psalm. 145.10.


X. But all the Buildings that God makes are for himself; he is no Man's
Workman or Servant, but has made all things for himself: For his own Pleasure
they were and are created.

XI. But God is perfect in Knowledge, and therefore incapable of Addition to it.
None can tax him of Hastiness, Failure, or Inadvertency. All Sciences meet in
Him, as their proper Center.

XII. No such thing done, or need to be done by God: No Angels unmade, or
Heavens dissolved, or Souls annihilated or extinguished, or Seas dried up, to
put them into a better Form: I know that thou can do every thing, Job 42.2.
and that no Knowledge is hid from thee.



Corollaries.
1. FRom these Particulars we may observe, That if God be the Builder of all
things, then the Work must of necessity be very well done, for no human
Architect can mend it.

2. That it is very rational, that he should be acknowledged and praised by his
handy Work.

3. That there is good Reason that all should be at his disposal, for he gave
them Being.

4. That Men have no cause to murmur, because they have no greater part of this
World than God allots, for they ought to acquiesce in his Will.

5. That in all our Wants we should apply our selves to Him, that gives
liberally, and upbraideth not; for we can have no Supply elsewhere.

6. That in all Projects and Undertakings we should seek Counsel of this great
and wise Master Builder, and observe his Leadings in all Enterprises.

7. That good Men have no reason to be troubled for worldly Losses, for all is
the Lord's, and he will surely give them what is fit for them.

God a Man of War.
Exodus 15.3. The Lord is a Man of War.

1 Samuel 17.45. The God of the Armies of Israel.

Isa. 47.4. The Lord of Hosts, -- (...) Dominus Exercituum.

Observation, God is compared to a Warrior.


TO illustrate this Similitude, we shall show, 1. What Wars the Almighty God
engages himself in. 2. What manner of Warrior he is. 3. In what respect he is
parallel with earthly Warriors. 4. The Disparity betwixt them. 5. Draw some
Inferences or Corollaries from the whole.


1. The Lord is engaged in a Spiritual War against the Ungodly, that remain
obstinate and rebellious against him. He judges the Righteous, and is angry
with the Wicked every day: If he turn not, he will whet his Sword; Psalm. 7.11,
12, 13.
he has bent his Bow, and made it ready: He has also prepared for him the
Instruments of Death, he ordains his Arrows against the Persecutors. If I
whet my glittering Sword, (says the Lord) and mine hand take hold on Judgment,
Jer. 9.16. and 12.12. Lev. 26.25, 33, etc. Deuteronomy. 32.41, 42.
I will render Vengeance to mine Enemies, and will reward them that hate me: I
will make mine Arrows drunk with Blood, (and my Sword shall devour Flesh) and
that with the Blood of the Slain, and of the Captives, etc.

2. The Lord is concerned, and oftentimes engages himself in Temporal or
National Wars and Battles: 'Twas He that led Joshua forth as an armed Man,
Josh. 1.9. 1 Samuel 17.45.
against the Canaanites. Hence he is called, the God of the Armies of Israel. I
know not (says an eminent Writer) any one thing, where the Providence of God
is more fully set out in Scripture, than in the Workings of it about Wars. It
was the Lord that brought up Nebuchadnezzar against the Cities of Judah, Isa.
13.4, 17, 19.
and stirred up the Medes to destroy the Babylonians.

Q. But what manner of Warrior is God?

A. 1. He is a Righteous and Just Warrior. The proud haughty Princes and
Potentates of the Earth, many times take up Arms upon unjust grounds, and pick
Quarrels for vainglorious and ambitious Ends: If they see their Neighbor
thrive, as if it were an Eclipse to their Glory, they invade him, and imbrue
their cruel Swords in Blood and Slaughter, sacrificing the Lives of many
thousand Innocents, to gratify their avaricious and damnable Lusts: Whereas God
never proclaims War, nor draws the Spiritual Sword against any Soul, People, or
Nation, but when there is just cause, and no other means will do: Shall not the
Judge of all the Earth (says Abraham) do Right? Ge^^. 18.25.


2. The Lord is a skilful and expert Warrior, he knows how to marshal his Host,
and set his Battle in Array. There is no Policy in War, nor Stratagem in the
Military Art, but he understands it.

3. He is a mighty and terrible Warrior. He can shake the Heavens by his Voice,
and make the Mountains quake before him: With him is terrible Majesty; Psalm.
24.8.
he is the Lord mighty in Battle. He makes the Earth to fear, and the
Inhabitants thereof to melt, so that the Men of Might shall not find their
hands. He can make Emperors as Stubble to his Bow, and mighty Kings as Chaff
before the Whirlwind. He makes Beelzebub, with all his Guards, to tremble, and
fly into Darkness it self, to hide themselves. He cuts off the Spirits of
Princes, and is triumphant over the greatest and proudest Monarchs. Alexander,
Dan. 5.5.
Pompey, Caesar, and Tamberlane, have all yielded to this invincible Conqueror.
If he shows but a Finger on the Wall, he makes proud Belshazzar quake; and can
employ inanimate Creatures, to terrify and destroy Pharaoh and his Host.

4. The Lord is a victorious and prevailing Warrior; when he rises up, he
devours at once. He bears long, before he stirs up himself like a Man of War;
he is not quickly provoked. I have (says he) for a long time held my Peace,
Isa. 44.19.
I have been still: Now I will cry like a traveling Woman, I will destroy and
devour at once. The Lord shall go forth as a mighty Man, he shall stir up
Jealousy like a Man of War: He shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against
his Enemies.

5. He is a Kingly Warrior, or General of a mighty Host: All the Inhabitants of
Heaven and Earth are at his Command.

Metaphor.
I. A Great and principal Warrior is dignified with a Title suitable to his
Office, as Lord General, or his Excellency.

II. He trains up and disciplines his Army in the Military Art, instructing
them how to behave themselves in all Martial Engagements, discovering the
Enemies Stratagems to them.

Prove. 20.18. and 24.6.
III. A General or Warrior takes Counsel and Advice, before he makes War.

IV. A Royal Warrior (when engaged in War) sends forth Commissions, and levies
an Army or Armies, (as the Kings of Israel did, who were great Warriors) and
his Orders are obeyed.

V. A great Warrior opens his Armory, and distributes Weapons, and Martial
Habiliments to his Soldiers.

VI. A Warrior sets up his Martial Standard, or chief Ensign of War.

VII. A Warrior causes his Trumpets to sound, to make ready for the Battle.

VIII. A Warrior, when he musters his Army, sets them in array, assigning their
proper Work and Stations, for the respective Squadrons or Divisions.

IX. A just and a generous Warrior sets forth his Declarations of the Equity of
his Cause, and the End of his Quarrel.

X. A great Warrior gives his Soldiers Banners to be displayed.

XI. A Warrior, before he fights, animates and encourages his Soldiers, and
provokes them to valorous and undaunted Actions.

XII. The General, or chief Warrior, marches in the Head of his Army, and leads
them on in Person to Battle.

XIII. A prudent Warrior takes care not only of his Front, but of the Rear of
his Army; he manages their Retreat, as well as the Onset.

XIV. A Royal Warrior is careful in providing Pay for his Soldiers at his own
charge.

Parallel.
I. GOD has a Title that expresses his transcendent Excellency and Grandeur; he
is called the Lord of Hosts, Isa. 47.4.
because all Creatures in Heaven and Earth are of his Army.

II. God teaches his People how to behave themselves in spiritual Conflicts,
and to fight under his Banner, Psalm. 18.34.
when he calls them forth. He warns them of the Dangers of Enemies, and
discovers the Subtilties and Devices of their Soul-Adversaries.

III. God does nothing rashly; for in all Wars he engages in, or Desolations
that he brings, He consults his own Wisdom, and does all by the Counsel of his
own Will.

IV. God is invested with Power and supreme Authority, to raise Armies at his
Pleasure; if he gives but the Word, they immediately rally together. God will
lift up an Ensign to the Nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end
of the Earth; Isa. 5.26.
and behold they shall come with speeed quickly. -- And it shall come to pass
in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the Fly, that is in the uttermost
part of the Rivers of Egypt, Isa. 7.18.
and for the Be that is in Assyria; and they shall come, etc. All are ready,
when He gives the Summons: Angels, Men, Dragons, Beasts, the great Deeps, Fire,
Hail, Snow, Wind, Frogs, Flies, Locusts, Caterpillars, etc. let him but hiss
(as it were) and they come to execute his Commands. It Is said of Pompey, that
when one of his Officers complained of the want of Men, he should reply, Let me
but stamp with my foot upon the Ground of Italy, and I shall have Men enough;
which was a Note of confident Pride in him, for he was wholly defeated
afterward by Caesar: Yet it is always true of the Lord of Hosts; for if he
holds up his Finger, all the Celestial and Terrestrial Host are ready to fight
his Battles.

V. The Lord brings forth his Weapons out of his Armory. He opened his Armory,
and has brought forth the Weapons of his Indignation; for this is the Work of
the Lord, etc. Ephesians. 6.10, 11, 12.
Take to you the whole Armor of God, etc.

VI. So does the Lord: I will lift up an Ensign to the Nation from afar. Isa.
5.26. Isa. 59.19.
-- And when the Enemy comes in like a Flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift
up a Standard against him.

VII. God commands the Trumpets to be blown, that all might be prepared for the
Day of his dreadful Controversy. Blow the Trumpet in Sion, and sound an Alarm
in my holy Mountain: Let all the Inhabitants of the Land tremble. Joel 2.1.
Zech. 9.14
And the Lord shall he seen over them, and his Arrows shall go forth as the
Lightning; and the Lord God shall blow the Trumpet, and shall go forth with the
Whirlwind of the South.

VIII. The Lord musters his Armies: The Noise of a Multitude in the Mountains,
like as of a great People: Isa. 13.4.
A tumultuous Noise of the Kingdoms and Nations gathered together. The Lord of
Hosts mustereth the Host of the Battle. In the Wars of his People Israel, he
gave directions for their Battel-Array, and when to give the Assault.

IX. God has published in his Word the Reasons why he prepares for War against
a People or Nation: Deuteronomy. 32.21, 22, 23.
They have moved me to Jealousy with that which is not God, they have provoked
me to Anger with their Vanities; and I will move them to Jealousy with those
that are not a People, I will provoke them to Anger with a foolish Nation: For
a Fire is kindled in mine Anger, and shall burn into the lowest Hell, etc. I
will heap Mischief upon them, I will spend mine Arrows upon them. It Is because
Men turn not from their Sins: They profess to know God, but in Works deny him,
setting up the Creature instead of the Creator. For the Iniquity of his
Covetousness (says God) I was wroth. Men slight the Offers and Tenders of the
Gospel, and tho they add Drunkenness to Thirst, they think they shall have
Peace; and for that reason God proclaims War, and says, he has whet his
Sword. Wherefore was it that God brought his Sword upon Jerusalem, and gave it
into the hands of the Babylonians? Was it not for rejecting his Word, and
despising his Messengers? Hence his Wrath came upon them, till there was no
Remedy; hence Jerusalem was given up again to be trod down by the Romans, viz.
because they rejected Christ and the Gospel.

X. God has given a Banner to them that fear him, Psalm. 60.4.
that it might be displayed because of the Truth; or as Ainsworth renders it,
to be high-displayed because of the certain Truth. Ainsworth on Psalm. 60.4.
The word [ Banner] or Ensign, (as Ainsworth upon the place says, is applied to
the Flag or Ensign of the Gospel, Isa. 11.12. -- 49.22. -- 62.10. here to
David, and his Victory, etc.

XI. God animates and encourages his People, as he did Joshua. -- There shall
not any Man be able to stand before thee, John 1.4, 5, 6, 7, etc.
all the days of thy Life: As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will
not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Be strong, of a good Courage, etc. Only be
thou strong, and very courageous. -- For then thou shall make thy Way
prosperous, and then thou shall have good success.

XII. God himself comes into the Field with his People. How often does he tell
them, that he is with them? The Lord your God is he that goes with you to
fight. He assists them, directs them, relieves them. None can march under a
better Commander, and he is the best Helper. The Lord is on my side, I will not
fear what Man can do unto me. Psalm. 118.6, 7, etc. Isa. 41.10, 11. Mat. 10. ult.
The Lord takes my part with them that help me; therefore shall I see my
desire upon them that hate me. Fear thou not, for I am with thee: Be not
dismayed, for I am thy God. I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea,
I will uphold thee, with the Arm of my Righteousness. -- Lo I am with you
always, to the end of the World.

XII. As the Lord goes before, so he is the Rereward of his People. Isa. 52.12.
Ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight; for the Lord will go before
you, and the God of Israel will be your Rereward. He is in the Front, in the
Rear, in the Middle, and the Flanks; therefore all is safe, because he is
invincible.

XIV. God is a liberal Rewarder of his People, (tho his Royal Munificence is
purely an Act of Grace, not Debt or Obligation, because we are his, and when we
have done all, we are unprofitable Servants, etc.) He that overcomes, Rev.
21.17
shall inherit all things.



Metaphor.
I. THe most renowned Conqueror, or most successful Martialist on Earth, is
vulnerable and mortal. Alexander would be thought the Son of Jupiter, but Death
soon convinced him.

II. Earthly Warriors are under certain Limitations; for they cannot war as
they please, their Bounds being set by the Almighty.

III. There is no earthly Warrior, tho never so redoubted, but may be matched,
and conquered too.

IV. Earthly Warriors know not the Success of their Arms beforehand, nor
foretell Events; they may be baffled in their Hopes, and made ashamed of their
Confidence.

V. Some Warriors invade their Enemies with sudden Irruptions, not giving them
Warning, nor Time of Preparation.

VI. Worldly Men of War know not sometimes how to put a Period to a War, when
it is begun, nor can tell when it will end.

VII. Tho Earthly Warriors can kill, yet they cannot make alive.

VIII. Such cannot kill the Soul.

IX. A Warrior may waste his Treasure, and empty his Exchequer, by long and
chargeable Wars.

X. He makes his Subjects bear the Charge.

Disparity.
I. GOD, the Spiritual Warrior, is the Eternal Jehovah, who formed Man, and all
things else: Psalm. 102.25, 26.
Thou have laid the Foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the Works of
thy Hands: They shall perish, but thou shall endure; yea, all of them shall wax
old like a Garment; as a Vesture shall thou change them: -- But thou art the
same, and thy Years shall have no end.

II. God has an absolute Power and Sovereignty over Heaven and Earth; whom he
will he sets up, and pulls down at his pleasure; whom he will he kills, and
whom he will he saves alive. He does whatsoever he pleases; and who can say
unto God, What do thou?

III. But there is no Match for God in the World: Isa. 27.
Who would set the Briars and Thorns against me in Battle? I would go through
them, I would burn them together. He is called a consuming Fire, Nah. 1.10.
and the greatest of his Enemies are but as Stubble fully dry. -- It was a
Saying of Caesar, Veni, vidi, vici; and may truly be said of God, for he never
comes off with Loss.

IV. The omniscient God, that knows all things, cannot be baffled nor
disappointed; he knows who of either side shall fall, and who shall be slain,
and who wounded, before the Battle begins.

V. The Lord of Hosts, before he takes up Arms, or intends to destroy a single
or a combined Enemy, gives them timely Warning and Notice of it, that so
Sinners may be ready, and prepare themselves. This appears in respect of the
Old World, those vile Enemies of God, the Lord gave them warning one hundred
and twenty Years, of his breaking in upon them, before it came to pass. So he
likewise gave warning to Jerusalem by the Prophets, before he brought the
Babylonians in upon them: And what warning did the Lord give to the People of
the Jews, before the Destruction came upon them by the Romans? God shoots off
his Warning-Piece, before he discharges his Murdering-Piece.

VI. God can in a moment stop any Judgment, he can stay the Sword from
devouring, and the Fire from consuming. He knows when the Controversy he has
with any Nation or People shall cease.

VII. The Lord of Hosts can kill and make alive, 2 Kin. 5.7.
and many times by killing brings to Life.

VIII. But God is able to kill both Soul and Body, and after cast them into
Hell. Mat. 10.28


IX. But God's Treasury can never be wasted, nor his Store consumed.

X. But God bears all the Charge of his Wars himself.

See the Metaphor of Captain.



Corollaries.
1. FRom the foregoing Particulars we may infer, That such as fight against
God's People, fight against God himself, he being their Head and General, that
bears the Charge of the War, and will certainly vindicate his People.

2. From hence all good Men may derive encouragement, because they are under
the Conduct of so Incomparable a Warrior, that can in a moment destroy all
their Enemies.

3. We may infer, that a Martial Employment is a very honorable and useful
Employ, viz. when the Cause is good, when it is for God's Glory, and for the
Honor and Safety of King and People. God is called, The Lord of Hosts, the God
of the Armies of Israel, which puts a Luster and Dignity upon this Title, etc.

4. If God's People be worsted by an Enemy, we may infer, that it is suffered
by the Almighty, as a Scourge and Punishment for their Sins: This was Israel's
Case very often. Josh. 7 8, 11.


5. Let God's People, when they go out against their Soul-Enemies, go in the
Name of the Lord of Hosts; for it is dangerous to face an Enemy, Psalm. 20.5.
unless God go with us: In the Name of the Lord will we set up our Banners.

6. We may infer the desperate Case of such as fight against God: Who ever
hardened his Heart against him, Job 9.4. Psalm. 83.2, 3, 4, 5, 13. Psalm. 2.12.
Isa. 8.9, 10. Isa. 27.4.
and prospered? Such as make a Tumult, and hate him, that lift up the Heod,
that take crafty Counsel against his People, etc. Such shall be made as Stubble
before the Wind, and their Confederacy laughed at by him that sits on high, etc.
The most steely and flinty in the World can no more stand before God, Caryl on
Job 9. p. 167.
than Briars and Thorns before a flaming Fire. -- Whoever commences War with
him, does it to his own Ruin and Destruction, etc.

7. Hence let all the Enemies of God consider, that it is their wisest and
safest Course to lay down their Arms, and make their Peace with God.

1. Because he is a God of Might and Power. 2. Of Terror and Majesty. 3. Of
Influence and Authority; he commands all. 4. Of invincible Resolution and
Constancy. 5. Of so great Valor and Generosity, that as there is no fighting
with him, so honorable Terms may be made with him upon Submission.
That he is a God of Might and Power, Terror and Majesty, has been shown
already, therefore we shall proceed to the third Particular, viz.

3. He is a God of Influence and Authority, he commands all. -- Nothing can
stand, when he commands a March. The Frogs invade Pharaoh, the Stars fight
against Sisera, an Angel fights the whole Host of Assyria; the Watchers turn
Nebuchadnezzar to Grass, toss Belshazzar from the Throne, and open the Gates of
Babylon for Darius: He brings forth his Angels by Troops, and shows them in the
Air, to strengthen or amaze, all mounted on Chariots and Horses: Sends the
Winds out of his Chambers, to make Confusion both by Sea and Land, which rolls
up the great Waves, and hurls the Ships against Rocks; that overturns Houses,
pulls up Trees by the Roots, enters into small Crannies, and shakes the
Foundations of the Earth, shakes the Walls of Jericho, makes the Ground open to
swallow up Men alive. Whoever he sets himself against, they are undone; for
neither Riches nor Strength will save them: Riches profit not in the Day of his
Wrath; Money cannot bribe him, and by Strength can no Flesh prevail: For he can
smite blind and lame in a moment, put in fear, smite Hip and Thigh, that they
cannot move to run away from him; break their Cheek-Bone, that they shall not
bite, nor ask for Mercy. -- Many have been overcome by him, but never any
prospered against him: So successful has he been in Battle, that the Victory
goes on his Side: wherever he undertakes the War, He makes One chase a
Thousand, and Two put Ten Thousand to Flight. As is his Power, so is He. His
Wisdom and Counsel is such, that by one Act he knows the Strength of all his
Enemies, and the Counsel they take in their Bedchamber, the Thoughts they have
on their Couches: He always catches the Wise in their own Craftiness, and
brings their Devices to naught: He scatters them with the Imagination of their
own Heart, and then laughs them to scorn: He knows the right Season to fall
upon them, and makes them like Dust before the Whirlwind; and in all things
wherein they deal proudly, shows himself still above them: Has subdued mighty
and great Kings, for his Mercy endures for ever. Challenges the Force of all
his Foes, If their Hearts can endure, or their Hands be strong, in the Day that
he shall deal with them. Requires Babylon it self, that mighty Queen of
Nations, to stand with her Enchantments, Astrologers, and Magicians, and
monthly Prognosticators. He is clothed with such Armor, that none can hurt
him; he is mounted on such a Steed, that none by Flight can escape him; for he
rides upon the Wings of the Wind: He makes his Angels swift to pursue, and his
Ministers Flames of Fire. He sends forth his Arrows in the Dark, that none can
escape them, nor yet discern them.

4. For his Resolution, it is invincible. He is of one mind, and none can turn
him; He will have his own Counsel stand, and the Thoughts of his Heart
performed to all Generations. There is no putting of him in fear, and so force
him into a Compliance. -- He always keeps his Ground, till he has done his
Work, and never yields or gives way in Battle. He concludes beforehand, that
his Foes must fly; so that Victory is more than half-gained before he begins to
fight. Send to Beelzebub, and he will tell you, that Legions of Angels are to
Him, as the lesser Flies are unto Armed Men; that he does scorn at Swords, and
laugh at the shaking of the Spear against him. Let Beelzebub himself come
forth, and call all his Sons to his Assistance, muster up both Pope and Turk,
in the Fullness of their Strength and Power, send to China, Tartaria, Japan,
etc. to fight this Man of War, the Lord of Hosts; and He will throw them, as
through the Thicket of a Forest, esteem all their Strength like Tow, and
rotten Wood, burn them together, speak in his Wrath, and vex them in his sore
Displeasure; thunder out of Heaven upon them, and break them all to pieces. He
can gather Heaven up in Folds, as a Curtain, and roll it together as a Sceoll
of Parchment. -- Break up the Fountains of the great Deep. -- Open the Windows
of Heaven, drown them by a Deluge, affright them by rattling Peals of Thunder,
rain down Hail and Thunderbolts, Fire and Brimstone, to disperse and consume
them. So that the best way is for Kings and Princes to be wise, for Judges and
Counselors to be instructed, to treat with him about Terms of Peace, to lay
down their Arms, to set aside all open Defiance, to bow to his Scepter, to
submit to Mercy within the Compass of the Time set them; and they shall find
this Man of War, this Lord of Hosts, this mighty God of Jacob, as merciful and
generous, as ever they found him strong and resolved. -- Tho they could not put
him in fear by their Force, they may win him to Favor by Entreaties, and make
honorable Terms with him.

First, To have all their bypast Treasons, Rebellions, and Hostilities against
him remitted, and by an Act of Oblivion so razed off the File, and obliterated,
as never to be produced against them any more. He will forgive Offenses, not
remember Iniquities, be liberal in Favor; will not condemn to Slavery, to make
Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water; but will promote to Dignity, take into
his Army, put amongst his Children, adopt to be his Sons, his Heirs, advance
them to a Kingdom, reward them with a Crown, invest them with the Raiment of
Princes, cloth them in Robes, place them upon Thrones, that in Grandeur of
Kings they may live and reign with him for ever. -- Fear not, little Flock,
Luke 12.32. 2 Timothy 4.7, 8.
it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom. A Crown of
Righteousness is from thenceforth laid up for them; white Robes are given them.
-- They shall sit with him upon his Throne, etc. But if they come not, he has
whet his Sword, he has bent his Bow, he has prepared his Arrows against the
Persecutors. When his Hand takes hold on Judgment, he will render his Anger
with Fury, and Rebukes with Flames of Fire. -- By Fire and Sword will he plead
with all his Enemies, to bind their Kings in Chains, and their Nobles in
Fetters of Iron. He will bring those that would not that he should rule over
them, and destroy them utterly. -- Cut them asunder, and appoint them their
Portion with Unbelievers and Reprobates, with the Devil and his Angels,
Beelzebub, and his Army. And thus shall it fare with the Enemies of the Lord of
Hosts.

God a Strong-Tower.
Prove. 18.10. The Name of the Lord is a strong Tower, the Righteous runs
into it, and is safe.

Psalm. 18.3. My high Tower.

Nahum 1.7. The Lord is good, a Strong-Hold in the Day of Trouble.


THese Metaphors, Refuge, Hiding Place, Fortress, Habitation, Place of Defense,
Sanctuary, Strong Tower, High Tower, Rock,
Have the same Import and Signification, and plainly hold forth, that God is
the Safeguard, Defense, and sure Protection of his People: Yet such of them,
whose Properties admit of Demonstration and Enlargement different from this,
are handled particularly, (to which the Reader is referred) and for the rest
the ensuing Parallel may serve.

To open this Metaphor, we shall show, 1. What is meant by the Name of God. 2.
Run the Parallel. 3. In what respects his Name may be called a Strong Tower;
with some short Application.


1. By the Name of God we are to understand those apt Titles, (as God, I am
that I am, Elohim, Jehovah, etc.) by which God calls himself, to signify or set
forth the Excellency of his Nature and Attributes; Exodus 33.19. with 34.6, 7.
Psalm. 44.5* and 54.1. 1 Samuel 17.45. (...) Nomen. Genesis 2.11.
as his Mercy, Goodness, Truth, Faithfulness, Omnipotence, Omniscience, etc.

2. It Is put for Aid and Help.

3. It Is put for Renown or Glory, Genesis 6.4. Men of Name, that is, famous Men,
Eccles. 7.1. Prove. 22.1. Phil. 2.9. So vile Persons are called, Job 30.8. Men
of no Name, -- Sine nomine Turba, id est, ignobilis Turba. So particularly for
the Honor of God, Psalm. 76.1. his Virtue and Power, Mat. 7.22. his Will
concerning Salvation, John 17.6.

4. For the Worship and Service of God, 1 King. 8.16. 2 Chronicles. 7.16. Jer. 7.12.
Lev. 20.3. See more in Wilson's Dictionary, and Illyric. in Clav. Script. upon
the word Name, etc.

Metaphor.
I. A Strong Tower is furnished with a Magazine of Arms and Ammunition, to
supply the Soldiers with Armor and Weapons defensive and offensive.

II. A strong Tower or Garrison is furnished with plenty of Provision, to
supply the Soldiers when besieged.

III. A strong Tower is furnished with a resolute courageous Commander, and
well disciplined Soldiers, whom the Captain animates and arms, receiving his
flying Friends into Protection.

IV. A strong Tower, with respect to Situation, is usually built upon a rocky
or most firm Foundation, to prevent Undermining.

V. A strong Tower is environed with thick and lofty Walls, to withstand the
Batteries of the Enemy, and overtop their Scaling-Ladders. It also gives a fair
and full Prospect of things below, discovering the Motions and Approaches of
the Enemy.

VI. A strong Tower is fortified with Outworks, as Moats, Plat-Forms,
Palisadoes, Counterscarps, Half-Moons, etc. which are often stormed and taken;
the Soldiers therefore do not put their chief confidence in them, but when
they find them not tenable, they wisely retire to the Tower, or main Strength,
or they are certainly lost.

VII. In a strong Tower the Walls and Bulwarks are furnished with Artillery,
and other Military Engines, to keep off and destroy the Assailants.

VIII. In a strong Tower they have Countermines, and other Devices to defeat
the Besiegers Mines, or underground Workings.

IX. A strong Tower is a Place of Security; there (as in a safe Retreat) Men
trust their Lives, Estates, Families, choice Treasures, etc. It Is a Refuge, and
sure Receptacle, when Enemies invade, or Tyrants oppress us.

X. Sometimes from a strong Tower, a Party is commanded to make brave Sallies
and Onsets on the Enemy.

XI. A strong Tower only saves and protects those that are got into it. --
Others are exposed to the Fury of the Enemy. The knowledge of its impregnable
Strength, gives Courage and Resolution to such as are in it, to bid defiance to
the Rage and Malice of all Enemies.

XII. As a strong Tower gives Courage and Spirit to those that are in it; so it
dispirits and disheartens the Besiegers, who after long and succesless
Assaults, are defeated, or beaten quite off.

Parallel.
I. GOD is the Christian's Magazine and spiritual Armory, from thence he is
furnished with Weapons to combat his Soul's Adversaries, as the Girdle of
Truth, the Breast Plate of Righteousness, Shoes of the Preparation of the
Gospel of Peace, the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, the Sword of the
Spirit, etc. reckoned up in Ephesians. 6.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, etc.

II. God the spiritual Tower is Fullness it self: Psalm. 107.9 Ephesians. 1.23.
He satisfies and fills the hungry Soul: His Fullness fills all in all. The
believing hungry Soul has his absolute Promise, Luke 6.21. Ye shall be filled.
And it is most certain, that he can and will make it good. The Militant
Christian can want nothing, but it is there ready for him.

III. The Lord Jesus Christ is commissioned as chief Officer in this heavenly
Tower, John 17.22. Romans 9.5. and 10.12.
whose Resolution no Force can shake, whose Courage no Enemy can daunt, and
whose Skill in training and disciplining his Soldiers no Military Professor
can equal. John 14.6. Heb. 2.10. Rev. 3.7. Joh. 15.5.
He is the Captain of our Salvation; by him (and only him) all distressed
Sinners are admitted into the Shelter and Protection of this Tower. He only
shuts and opens: None can come unto the Father but by him: Without him we can
do nothing. He distributes his Graces, and fits for an Encounter. -- He gives
his Saints Power to tread upon Serpents and Scorpions, Luke 10.19.
and over all the Power of the Enemy, etc.

IV. This Heavenly Tower is the Rock of Ages it self. Deuteronomy. 32.4. 2 Samuel 23.3.
All the Powers of Hell and Earth are not able to shake it, nor all their Art
to undermine it.

V. The Lord is a Wall of Fire round about his People, Zech. 2.5. Acts 5.39.
and 23.9.
such as no Battery can make a Breach in, nor Ladder scale. There is no
fighting against God, for he is too hard a Match for the proudest Mortal. It Is
a desperate and foolish Enterprise to attack this Fort, for it is impregnable.
It gives those within a clear Prospect of the Things of this World, which the
Dwellers below cannot discover. -- They see what Sin is, with its defiling and
damning Quality; 2 Cor. 2* 11.
they are not ignorant of Satan's Devices, by which he labors to circumvent
them; they see the Weakness of their spiritual Enemies, and fear them not, so
long as this Tower incloses them.

VI. A bare external Profession of Religion, superficial reading of the
Scriptures, thinking (like the Jews) to have eternal Life in them; speculative
Knowledge, or that which is merely historical; assembling or joining in
Communion with God's People in his Ordinances; Conversations morally sober,
outward Strictness in Christian Duties, pious Performances, etc. may be fitly
compared to these Outworks, which, tho in themselves very good, and to be
practiced, yet without the Root of the Matter, that is, the Life and Power of
Grace in the Heart, they are not by any means to be rested in; for when an
Enemy comes, these Defenses are too weak and unserviceable. It therefore
concerns the Safety of Christians, to go to God (this impregnable Tower)
through Christ, and make a timely Retreat into their great Citadel; else their
Fortification will be certainly demolished, Mat. 25.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc.
and they destroyed, as in the foolish Virgins Case.

VII. This heavenly Tower is furnished with a dreadful Train of Artillery. He
distributes Death, Desolation, and Havoc, among the proud rebellious Pharaohs
of the Earth, Exodus 9.23
that oppress his People. He deals Destruction in loud Peals of Thunder, and
furious Storms of Rain, Hail, and Fire. Rev. 16.1. 2 Pet. 3.10. Isa. 28.2.
He pours out the Vials of his Wrath, rends Rocks, and makes the Earth to
quake. -- He can (and will in time) melt the Elements with fervent Heat, and
burn up the Earth, and the Works therein. The murdering Cannon never roared
out more Horror and Amazement, than the Wrath and Vengeance of an incensed God,
elegantly expressed, Psalm. 18.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, etc. The Earth shook
and trembled; the Foundations of the Hills moved, and were shaken, because of
his Wrath. There went up Smoke out of his Nostrils, and Fire out of his Mouth
devoured -- Coals were kindled by it. He bowed the Heavens also, and came down,
and Darkness was under his Feet. He rode upon a Cherub, and did fly; yea, he
did fly upon the Wings of the Wind. He made Darkness his secret Place; his
Pavilion round about him were dark Waters, and thick Clouds of the Skies. At
the Brightness that was before him, his thick Clouds passed, Hailstones, and
Coals of Fire. The Lord also thundered in the Heavens, and the Highest gave his
Voice, Hailstones, and Coals of Fire: Yea, he sent out his Arrows, and
scattered them; and he shot out Lightnings, and discomfited them.

VIII. The Lord can baffle the Combinations of the Wicked, Eccles. 10.8. Job
5.12, 13. Prove. 26.27.
and entrap them in their own Snares: He disappoints the Devices of the Crafty,
makes them fall into their own Pit; he brings the hidden Counsels of Wickedness
to Light, and defeats the Plots and Stratagems of Antichrist, of which (in his
blessed Providence) he has given us many memorable Instances, in former and
later Times.

IX. God is such a Safeguard to his Church, Mat 16.18. Isa. 8.14.
that the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it; a sure Sanctuary to every
individual Christian, that puts or commits himself into his Protection. He is
as tender of his Saints, Mat. 13.44. Mat. 6.20.
as of the Apple of his Eye. Here we may safely deposit Lives, Estates,
Families, choice Treasures. Here no Moth can corrupt, no Thief break through,
nor Tyranny oppress us: 1 Pet. 4.19.
Commit your Souls in well-doing unto him, as into the Hands of a faithful
Creator. Believers had rather have their Treasure in their Father's keeping,
than their own. The Adversary might soon rob and undo us, were not our chief
Storehouse in God.

X. God can command Millions of Angels to destroy his and his Peoples Enemies:
One of which, in one Night, slew 185000 Assyrians; and at another time, 2 King.
19.35. 2 Chronicles. 32.21.
cut off all their mighty Men of Valor, Leaders, and Captains, etc.

XI. The Lord (in whose Name is strong Confidence) is a Place of Refuge, Prove.
14.26.
and strong Tower to his dear Children. Those sincere Ones that have given
themselves up to him, they are secure out of the Devil's Gunshot, and the Power
of Enemies; whilst the Hypocrites, Isa. 33.14*
and lukewarm Formalists, are upon all occasions exposed to both. But the
valiant Soldiers of Jesus within the Tower, are animated with so brave a
Courage, that they despise the Batteries and Assaults of the Enemy, (as was
said concerning blasphemous Sennacherib:) The Virgin, the Daughter of Zion,
has despised thee, and laughed thee to Scorn; the Daughter of Jerusalem has
shaken her Head at thee: Isa. 37.22*
For she had absolute Confidence in her Strong-Hold.

XII. God, the strong Tower, Micah 4.8.
not only inspires his Soldiers with true Valor and Courage, to set at naught
all the Powers of Hell; but also confounds and dispirits their Adversaries,
that they are at last, when their bloody persecuting Designs prove ineffectual,
forced to give over, and quit their Attempts against his Church and People.



Metaphor.
I. THe Fabric and Materials of an earthly Tower are subject to decay.

II. A strong Tower may be beaten down by the Fury of Cannons, or battering
Engines.

III. A strong Tower may be surprised, if the Watchmen be sleepy or negligent.

IV. A strong Tower may be betrayed by the Treachery of seeming Friends.

V. A strong Tower may be reduced by Famine.

Disparity.
I. THe heavenly Tower is incorruptible and everlasting, of an infinite and
spiritual Essence, and so not subject to the Decays of Time.

II. The heavenly Tower is out of the reach of Hell, and the World's Batteries:
All the Violence in the World cannot shake it.

III. The heavenly Tower is beyond all possibility of Surprise; its Watchman
never slumbers nor sleeps.

IV. God knows the Hearts of all Men, and therefore cannot be deceived. He
knows the secret Bent and Inclination of the closest Hypocrite, and can render
their darkest Designs against him or his People ineffectual. Isa. 54.17.


V. In this Tower is the Bread of Life, and an inexhaustible Fountain: Here the
Hungry are filled, and the Thirsty satisfied: Here is no fear of Famine,
because the Provision is as eternal as the Souls that need it.

3. In what respects the Name of the Lord may be called a Strong-Tower, take in
the following Particulars.

The Hebrew Names of God, as Jerome (the best Hebrician of the Fathers)
observes, are Ten: L^^igh Crit. Sac^^.
Three come from Being, (...) 1. (...) 2. (...) 3. (...) 4. (...) 5. (...) 6.
(...) 7. (...) 8. (...) 9. (...) 10.

as Jehovah, Jah, Ehejeh; three from Power, as El, Eloah, Elohim; three from
Governing, Adonai, Shaddai, Jehovah-Tsebaoth; one from Excelling, as Elion.

1. Jehovah sets out the Eternity and Self-existency of God. -- Je notes the
Time to come, Ho the Time present, Vah the Time past. It consists of quiescent
Letters, (or Letters of Rest) to show that there is no Rest till we come to
Jehovah, and that there we are safe and secure. This Name is opened, Rev. 1.4,
8. and 4.8. and 11.17. and 16.5. (...): Which is, which was, and which is to
come. It comes of (...) Havah, He has been. --

2. Jah is a Diminutive of Jehovah, and notes the same things.

3. Ehejeh, I am or will be, (...) Ehejeh Asher Ehejeh, Exodus 3.14
I will be what I will be. This notes the Essence of God, and implies his
Immutability and Incomprehensibleness. Christ alluded to this Name, John 8.58.
Before Abraham was I am.

With respect to these Names God may be called a Strong Tower, in regard of the
Eternity of his Duration, and Infiniteness of his Essence. The Rabbis, and
Chaldee Paraphrase, expound this Text of the Eternity of God. See Ainsworth on
the place.

4. El, a strong God. Junius and Tremellius translate it, Deum fortem; Genesis
14.22. and 21.33.
Aquila, (...), robustum, strong. This notes the Omnipotency of God, etc. Ezekiel.
31.11. See Rivet. on Psalm. 19.1. Hence Eli, my God, an Hebrew word, Mat. 27.46.
and Eloi, a Syriack word, Mark 15.34.

5. Eloah, is derived of El, strong or mighty; and by increase of the Word, the
Signification is increased, most Mighty, or the Almighty, etc. The Plural
Number of it is,

6. Elohim, Almighties, or Almighty Powers, Genesis 1.1. 1 Chronicles. 17.21. 2* Sam.
7.23. (...) Barah Elohim, that is, word for word, Gods created; that is, the
Father, Son, and Spirit, created; noting, as some say Trinity in Unity Because
here is a Noun of the Plural Number, joined with a Verb of the Singular Number.
; or (as others say) the great Majesty of God, and the Plurality of his
Excellencies.

With respect to the Signification of these Names also, God may be called a
Strong Tower, because of his Almighty Power, and infinite Strength, which is a
safe Sanctuary for such as fly to it.

7. Adonai, (derived from (...) Eden, Basis, Columna, cui aliquid insistit;
Dominus, qui Basis ^^nstar, sustentat and regit Domum aut Politia^^,
a Base, Pillar, or Column, that bears up or supports any thing) signifies
Lord, who as he created all things, does also sustain and preserve them. It is
given to God in the Old Testament one hundred and thirty four times. See
Ainsworth on Genesis 15.2.

8. Shaddai, -- Almighty, or All-sufficient. Grammarians are not agreed about
the Etymology of this Word: Some derive it from (...) Quod est diripere and
praedari, item perdere, destruere, and vastare, quasi Vastatorem dica^^, i. e.
potentem and invictum, cui nemo resistere possit.

Volunt nonnulli Deum hoc Nomen traxisse a vastatione Mundi, facta in Diluvio.
Alii (...) nomen compositum esse volunt, etc.


Shadad, to carry away by force, to prey, lay wast, or destroy. -- Many think
that God took this Name from the World's Destruction in the Flood. -- The
Greeks translate it, (...), and the Latins Omnipotens, both which signify
Almighty. Others say, that it is a compounded Word of the Verb Dai, which
signifies, It is sufficient, and the Letter (...), which supplies the place of
the Relative Asher, to answer the Greek (...), Content in himself, or
self-sufficient, for in him is all Sufficiency, etc.

This Name notes the Power and Sufficiency of God to go through with all
things, and for wasting and destroying his Enemies. To this the Prophets have
reference, saying, that (...) Shod (Destruction) shall come from Shaddai (the
Almighty) Isa. 13.6. Joel 1.15. Dominus Exercituum, qu^^d exercitus omnes pro
arbitrio suo agit. Tremell. and Jun. in Psalm. 24.


9. Jehovah Tsebaioth, Lord of Hosts. The Rabbis observe, that he has two
general Troops, (Copiae tam inferiores quam supernae,) the Creatures above,
Vid. Bezam and Piscator. in Romans 9.29.
and Creatures beneath, all ready pressed to be employed in his Wars, either
defensive or offensive, for the Safeguard of his Favorites, or the Destruction
of their Opposites.

The Name Jehovah implies, that God had his Being or Existence of Himself
before the World began, and that he gives Being to all things, that he gives
Being to his Word, effecting whatsoever he speaks: I appeared, says the
Lord, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, by the Name of God Almighty, or
All-sufficient; but by my Name Jehovah was I not known to them; as the Greek
and Chaldee render it, manifested not. They believed God was able to perform
whatsoever he had said, but they saw not the Performances; till when he makes
good the Covenant to their Children, he calls himself Jehovah, denoting the
faithful Performance of all his Promises, and therefore may be rightly called a
Strong Tower.

10. The last, Elion, Altissimus, Psalm. 9.3. and 92.9. to which the Greek
(...), most High, answers, Luke 1.32. Acts 7.48. which sets forth the
surpassing Dignity, Excellency, and high Sovereignty of God, which is over and
above all.

In all these respects God's Name is a Strong Tower, for he is their Support:
He is Almighty, and so can destroy such as rise against him; He commands the
Celestial and Terrestrial Hosts: And lastly, he is the most High, so that there
is no contending with him.

Besides, the other Attributes of God are as so many strong Towers to secure
his People. His Wisdom orders all things for the best. -- His Goodness and
Mercy engages him to fatherly Affection. -- By his Omniscience he knows all
their Wants, Temptations, Afflictions, etc. His Faithfulness gives them
Assurance, that he will not fail, etc.



Coronaries.
I. IF God be such a Strong-Tower, let the Righteous make haste and run into
it. An Interest in Christ, an Exercise of Faith, sincere Prayer, Confession of
Sin, etc. is the way. Motives to this are,

1. No other Strong Tower can secure them: Wisdom, Honor, Riches, Psalm. 20.7.
and 49.6. Jer. 17.5. Job 15.31. Psalm. 39.5.
etc. will not do it.

2. To fly to other Strongholds, is a Breach of God's Law, and brings a
Curse: Cursed is the Man that trusts in Man, etc.

3. It is absolute Folly and Madness to depend upon any other, for they cannot
save in a Day of Wrath.

4. There you will be safe from all the Enemies in the World.

II. From hence we may infer, That all the Attempts of Hell, and wicked Men,
will certainly prove vain and unsuccessful against the Church and People of God.

III. That there is no resting in a bare lifeless Form, (which are the
Outworks) but such as will be safe, must get the Power, as well as the
Profession of Religion.

God compared to a Giant,
Job 16.14. He breaks me with Breach upon Breach, and runs upon me like a
Giant.


JOB, under the heavy Pressures of Afflictions, makes this bitter Complaint. I
know not any Scripture besides, wherein God is held forth by this Similitude,
viz. Running upon his People, or a particular Saint, like a Giant. Which shows,
as Mr. Caryl well observes from the place, how much Terror God is pleased to
cloth himself with, and what Strength he puts forth, whilst he contends with
those that fear him. God does not only afflict such as he loves, but sometimes
he afflicts them sorely: Does he not so, when he shakes them in pieces? Does
not he so, when he sets them as his Mark, when a Multitude of skilful Archers
compass them about, when he cleaves their Reins asunder, when he pours out
their Gall upon the Ground? Does he not so, when he sets Engines of Battery, to
make Breach upon Breach, and then runs upon them like a Giant?

Doct. God sometimes in chastising or afflicting of his People, runs upon
them like a Giant?

Simile.
I. A Giant is a mighty Man, or a Man of more Strength and Robustuousness than
others, as Goliath, and the Sons of Anak were: When a Giant assaults a Man, it
is more than to be set upon by an ordinary Man.

II. A Giant is not only said to be strong, but fierce and terrible; and his
running upon one like a Giant, denotes Courage, Fierceness, and Fearlesness,
therefore called Horim.

III. A Giant is not only strong and fierce, but also swift; hence David
compares the Sun at his rising, to a Bridegroom coming out of his Chamber,
psalm. 19.5.
and to a Giant or strong Man, who rejoiceth to run a Race.

Parallel.
I. GOD puts forth his Strength, when he is said to break forth against a Man
like a Giant. What is a weak Man, or a poor feeble Child, in the hands of a
Giant? How much less is Man, in the hands of a strong and mighty God?

II. God seemed to come forth against Job fiercely, as if he would break him to
pieces, and destroy him at once: I will give thy Flesh (says Goliath to David)
to the Fowls of Heaven. 1 Samuel 17.46.


III. God is not only fierce in the way of his Chastisement of his People, but
also sometimes very swift: He may seem to delay for a while the Use of the Rod,
but at last he comes on apace, brings one Judgment upon another speedily, as
appears by Job's Messengers.



Quest. Why is God said sometimes to run thus upon his People as a Giant, and
break out so furiously upon them whom he dearly loves?

Ans. Sometimes, because he is greatly offended and provoked so to do by their
Sins: You have I known above all the Families of the Earth, therefore will I
punish you for your Iniquities. God's People sin sometimes with a high hand,
Amos 3.2. Psalm. 38.3.
therefore God punishes them with a high hand: Thine Arrows stick fast in me,
and thine Hand presses me sore, says that good Man, David: And again, There
is no soundness in my Flesh, because of thine Anger; neither is there any Rest
in my Bones, because of my Sin.

Quest. But why did God run like a Giant upon so upright and holy a Man as Job
was? Does it stand with the Justice and Righteousness of God, thus to break
forth upon a holy Person?

Ans. Before I speak to the Solution of this Question, it will be necessary to
premise six or seven things.

1. Tho it may not be immediately for this or that Sin, that the Almighty
afflicts his Jobs; yet Sin is the Original Cause of all their Afflictions: If
Job had not been polluted and defiled with Sin, he had never known Sorrow or
Affliction.

2. Tho Job might not be afflicted for Sin, yet Job's Sins (tho a very holy
Man) deserved greater Punishment than that which God brought upon him: He has
visited thee little or nothing, says Elihu; so the word will bear it. The
least Mercy is more than we deserve, and the greatest Affliction is less than
we deserve. He has not dealt with us after our Sins, nor rewarded us according
to our Iniquities.

3. Tho God came forth fiercely upon Job, yet it was not in a way of Wrath, to
destroy him; nay, God did not design any Injury or Wrong to him, but
contrariwise his great Good and Advantage. You have heard of the Patience of
Job, James 5.1.
and of the End of the Lord; that he is very pitiful, and of tender Mercy.

4. We must always imprint this, as an undoubted Truth, and sure Maxim, in our
Minds; That tho God sometimes afflicts, (...) may afflict his Children, as a
bare Act of his Sovereignty, Sin being not directly the Occasion thereof; yet
nothing God does or can do is unjust. I know, O Lord, Psalm. 119.75. Deuteronomy 32.4.
that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulness have afflicted me.
All his Ways are Judgment, a God of Truth, and without Iniquity, just and
righteous in all his Ways: That is, his Administrations, or his Doings, as Mr.
Ainsworth note^^, are Judgment, that is, judicious, equal: A God of Truth, or
Faithful; without Iniquity, or there is in him no Iniquity, no injurious Evil:
Right or righteous is he. Consider further,

5. That the greatest and sorest Afflictions that godly Men may meet with, are
no sufficient Ground to conclude they are cast out of God's Favor: For the
best of Saints, and dearest Servants of God, have been from the beginning under
the greatest Exercise of Affliction. As many as he loves, Rev. 3.19.
he rebukes and chastens.

6. Another thing that we should premise, is, That the Afflictions which we
meet with in this World, come not by chance. They are all measured out by God's
ordering Providence, in matter and manner, for kind and quality. And tho the
Judgments and Dealings of God are sometimes very secret, and hard to be
understood at first, we ought with Patience to bear them, and humbly wait, till
God is pleased to show us his Mind and Pleasure in them.

7. We must consider, that it is our Duty to acknowledge all our Troubles and
Afflictions, and whatever they be, as coming from God; and look beyond
Instruments and secondary Causes: Is there any Evil in the City, and I have not
done it? He breaks me with Breach upon Breach, and runs upon me like a
Giant. He; Why some may say, It was the Devil and his Agents, viz. the Sabeans,
and Chaldeans, etc. Job knew that no Devil or wicked Man could hurt or touch
him, if God did not give them leave, and open the Door for them.

These things being premised, I now shall give you five or six Reasons, why God
ran thus upon Job, or breaks forth after this manner upon sincere Persons, when
Sin is not the Cause.

It is necessary to note this by the way, That God does frequently single out
the most eminent and choicest of his Children, to undergo the sharpest and
sorest Affliction, because they have the greatest Strength. Joseph excelled for
Grace and Virtue, and therefore he is singled out from all his Brethren to hard
Works and Sufferings. No Man like Job in all the Earth, in his Day, for a
perfect and upright Man; and what a Man of Sorrows and Afflictions was he?
Caryl, lib. 7. p. 701.
Those that have received most Grace from God, are able to bear most
Afflictions from God. A General of an Army chooses out the most valiant and
experienced Soldiers, to put them upon hard Adventures. It is not prudent to
put a Fresh Water Soldier upon difficult Service. As Christ says, I have many
things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now; and therefore deferred,
till they had got more Strength: So God says of a young Christian, one that is
newly converted, Thou have great Afflictions to undergo before thou die, but
thou art not fit to bear them yet, I will defer thy Trial, till thou art grown
more hardy, and fit for that Encounter; as our Savior told Peter, John 21.18.

1 Reason. One Reason why God ran thus upon Job like a Giant, or brings sore
and severe Trials upon his dearest Servants, is, That he may fit them for
eminent Work and Service. Hereby they learn Experience and Knowledge, not only
how to carry themselves in dark and dismal Days, but to teach others also, how
to behave themselves under Trials.

2. That God might crucify them unto all the things of this World: They do not
only this way come to see the Vanity and Emptiness of them, but to be dead unto
them. In Prosperity the Hearts of the best of Men are ready to be ensnared with
the World, therefore God brings Adversity upon them. And indeed it is every way
as good and useful for a Saint, as Winter and sharp Frosts are to the Fruits of
the Earth, which kills the Worms and Weeds, that otherwise would greatly hurt
and injure them. God's Jobs have a Body of Sin and Death in them, as well as
others, and nothing like Affliction tends to destroy it. The Corruptions of our
Hearts are compared to Chaff and Dross, which the Furnace of Affliction burns
up, and purges away. No Man is so pure and clean, but he needs to be made more
pure, and more holy. Job was very good before, but God made him much better by
the Rod, before he had done with him: He was Gold before his Trial, but
afterward refined Gold: When I am tried, I shall come forth as Gold, (to wit,
refined Gold. Job 23.10.
)

3. God brings his Jobs under great Exercises and Afflictions for the Trial of
their Graces. Grace never shines forth in its real Splendour and Glory, until it
comes to be tried. A Saint knows not what his Faith can do, until it is brought
under Exercise. Abraham knew not the Strength of his Faith and Love, until he
was called to offer up his Son Isaac: He withheld not his Son, his only Son
Isaac, whom he loved; such was his Love to God: And if we respect his Faith,
it is said, He believed in Hope against Hope, that he might become the Father of
many Nations. Romans 4.18, 19, 20.
-- According to that which was spoken, so shall thy Seed be. He being not weak
in Faith, considered not his own Body being now dead, when he was about an
hundred Years old, neither the deadness of Sarah's Womb: He staggered not
through Unbelief, Genesis 15.5.
but was strong in Faith, giving Glory to God. By Faith he offered him up, Heb.
11.19.
accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the Dead: From whence
also he received him in a Figure. How did Job's Patience shine forth, when it
came under Exercise, by all those sore and bitter Afflictions he met withal.
The greater the Temptation or Trial is, if the Soul can resist it, and bear up
under it, the greater Demonstration there is of the Strength and Power of that
Grace the Soul possesses. The Almighty shows hereby the Strength and
Unmoveableness of Faith, how unconquerable it is, what kind of Omnipotency
there is in Grace. He would have all the World know, that a godly Person is in
vain assaulted by Friends or Enemies, Caryl.
by Men or Devils, by Wants and Wounds, tho he be even benighted in his Spirit,
tho God himself takes away the Light of his Countenance from him, and runs upon
him like a Giant; yet that over all these things God's Grace can make him
stand, and cause him to be more than a Conqueror: For in the Book of Job, we
may say, is an Account given of one of the greatest Battles fought, that ever
was between Man and Man, between Man and Hell, between God and Man; yet Job
went away with Victory. True Grace is often assaulted, yet never was, nor ever
shall be overthrown or conquered.

4. God brings his Jobs under this severe Dispensation, and then runs upon them
like a Giant, that he might convince and reprove Satan, and all wicked Men,
that continually slander, vilify, and reproach the Godly, saying, They serve
the Lord for their own Ends, and follow him for Loaves; that they attend upon
him for an Estate, or for vain Glory, the pleasant and good Things of this
World: Job 1.9.
Does Job serve God (says Satan) for naught? He is a very Hypocrite, tho he
now seem so godly: No such Zealot as he, but he has a base and selfish End and
Design in all he does: If God do but run upon him like a Giant, and strip him
of all these worldly Comforts which he enjoys, you will then see what becomes
of his Religion: He will curse God to his face. The Lord did on purpose cause
these things to be acted, Job 2.5.
and to come upon Job, for ever to stop the Mouth of Satan and his Servants; to
show, that his Children follow him for the Love they bear to him, and for the
Excellency they find in him, and in his Ways, and from that Bond and Duty that
is incumbent upon them. -- Tho he strip them naked of all they have, yet they
will cleave to him.

5. God ran thus upon his Servant Job, that he might become an Example of
Patience and Sufferings to future Generations; and that God's People might
hence have wherewith to sustain themselves under killing, severe Dispensations,
and not faint when they are rebuked of God: For if God thus deals with his
beloved Jobs, let no Soul give up their Hope, or utterly despair, who are under
the sorest and most amazing Dispensations of the Almighty. Romans 15 4
Whatsoever was written afore-time, was written for our Instruction, that we
through Patience, and Comfort of the Scriptures, might have Hope. Jam. 5.10.
Take, my Brethren, the Prophets, (says the Apostle) who have spoken unto you
in the Name of the Lord, for an Example of suffering Affliction, and of
Patience.

6. God thus deals with his dear Children in this World, to increase and add to
their Glory in the World to come. Afflictions here will not go without their
Reward hereafter. No Believer shall lose by suffering hard things according to
the Will of God. He does it not simply for his own Pleasure, but for our
Profit, that we might be Partakers of his Holiness. Though at present no
Affliction seems joyous, but grievous, nevertheless afterward it yields
the peaceable Fruit of Righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. And
hence Paul says, Our light Affliction, Heb. 12.10, 11. 2 Cor. 4.17.
which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal
Weight of Glory.

The Inferences are these, 1. Terror. 2. Counsel. 3. Comfort.


1. Terror. Let all ungodly Men and Women hence tremble; for if God breaks his
own dear Children thus to pieces, and runs upon them like a Giant, how will
he come forth in Wrath and Vengeance upon them! Their only way is, to submit
themselves at his Foot, whilst there is Mercy: For when once he is risen up,
and awaketh as one out of Sleep, like a Giant, or mighty Man, that shouteth by
reason of Wine, He will break their Bones in pieces, and put them to perpetual
Reproach. Wo^^to that Man that God stirs up all his Strength and Wrath against,
when his absolute Design and Purpose is to kill and utterly destroy. God is
^^ngry ^^ith the Wicked every day: If he return not, he will whet his Sword;
Psalm. 7.12, 13.
he has bent his Bow, and made it ready: He has prepared for them the
Instruments of Death.

2. Counsel, to you that are the Enemies of the dreadful Majesty. Bless God you
are not cut off, that you are not ground to Powder, and before now amongst the
Damned: And let me advise you in Love to your Souls, not to adventure one step
further in a way of Sin and Rebellion against God, lest he tear you in pieces,
and there be none to deliver. Therefore God's Counsel is, Kiss the Son, lest he
be angry, and ye perish in the Way, when once his Wrath is kindled but a
little* Psalm. 2.12*
Blessed are all they that put their Trust in him. God is now ready to treat
with you from the Mercy-Seat; but the Time is near, when he will get upon the
Seat and Throne of Judgment, and then it will be to late.

3. Comfort, to you that are Saints, and under Afflictions. This may administer
much Consolation unto you* You see, God deals no otherwise with you, than he
did with blessed Job; nay, what are all thy Sufferings compared with Job's
Sufferings? And you have heard, that God in his severest Dispensations designs
your Good, and that he will make you Gainers by all at last; and if he lays an
heavy Burden upon you* he will give you Strength to undergo it. Wait therefore
patiently upon the Lord, and be humbled under his mighty Hand. How did Job
behave himself, when God did all this to him? Did he oppose? did he strive with
his Maker? No, no; Job knew that was in vain; bu^^ he tells us, He put Sackloth
upon his Loins, and defiled his Horn in the Dust: My Face, Job 16.5.
says he, is foul with Weeping, and on my Eye-l^^ds is the Shadow of Death.
The only way under the heavy Strokes of the Almighty, is, to prostrate our
Souls at his Foot. When God lets out visible Tokens of his afflicting Hand upon
us, we should let out visible Tokens of our Humiliation under his Hand; when we
are greatly afflicted, we should be greatly affected; when God seems angry, we
should be troubled; when he runs on us in a way of Affliction, we should fall
down before him in a way of Contrition. Ephraim's Sighs and Moans were Music
in God's Ears. Ephraim did not murmur against God, but mourned before God. The
way to have God's Rod removed, is to be sensible of the Rod, and who has
appointed it. If we would be free from Affliction, we must be humbled for our
Sin, if we are humbled under the Cross, God will soon exalt us upon the Throne.

God compared to a Lion.
Hosea 13.7. I will be unto them as a Lion, as a Leopard will I observe them: I
will meet them as a Bear bereaved of her Whelps: And I will rent the Caul of
their Heart, and then will I devour them like a Lion.


WE have here a threefold Simile, which shows the fearful State of a wicked
and provoking People.

1. I will be unto them as a Lion, I will devour them like a Lion. 2. As a
Leopard I will observe them. 3. I will meet them as a Bear bereaved of her
Whelps.
Doct. 1. God, in his breaking in upon a wicked and rebellious People, in a way
of Wrath and Judgment, will be unto them as a Lion.

The Scope of this Text being to set forth the Anger and Wrath of the Incensed
Majesty of GOD, with the consequent Destruction of the Wicked and Impenitent,
we shall illustrate the Similitude in the following Parallels.

Simile.
I. THe Lion is a most terrible Creature: If the Lion roars, all the Beasts of
the Forest tremble. Amos 3.
Naturalists observe, That tho other Creatures are swifter on foot than the
Lion; yet when he roareth, they lie down.

II. A Lion when enraged (especially) has a majestical, fierce, and an amazing
Look; and how ready are all to run, and shift for their Lives, when he rises up
to the Prey?

III. None can take away the Prey from a Lion, as the Prophet shows us; who,
if he goes through a Flock of Sheep, both treads down, and teareth in
pieces, and none can deliver.

IV. A Lion is strong, and crushes the whole Compages of a Man's Bones at one
Crush; he rends the Body of Man to pieces. And Naturalists tell us, That when
the Lion has torn the Body asunder, he loves to suck the Blood that is about
the Heart; and as for other Parts of the Body, except he be very hungry, he
leaves them to other Beasts to prey upon; but the Heart, the Blood, and the Fat
that is about the Heart, the Lion loves to suck.

V. The Lion is a Creature (as Naturalists observe) that seems much for
Justice. Seneca, in his Book, De Beneficiis, out of Gellius.
No Creature more fixed or constant in their Love and Friendship, or more ready
to revenge the Breach of Amity, than is a Lion; which is further demonstrated
by a great Historian, citing a Passage of Eudemus, Topsall, lib. 1. p. 336.
E^^demus.
who writes of a certain young Man, that nourished together many Years, a Dog,
a Bear, and a Lion; who lived in perfect Peace and Concord, without Breach,
Snarling, or appearance of Anger. But on a day, as the Dog and the Bear played
together, and biting one another gently, it happened that the poor Dog fastened
his Teeth in sport, deeper than the Bear could digest; and thereupon he
presently fell upon him, and with his Claws tore out the soft part of his
Belly, whereof he presently died. The Lion sitting by, and seeing this Cruelty,
and Breach of Love, Amity, and Concord, that had been amongst them, was
inflamed to revenge that Perfidy, and like a true King of Beasts, measured the
same measure to the Bear, as he had done to the Dog, and served him with the
same Sauce, tearing him instantly in pieces. If a Lion be harmed by a Man, with
a Stone or Dart, according to the Merit of their Hurt, they frame their Revenge.

VI. It Is observed of the Lion, that he will narrowly mark any one that wounds
him: And tho there are hundreds of Men together, and but one wound him, or
shoot at him, or any ways* hurt or injure him, he will observe and mark that
Man, and keep the Wrong in his Mind a long time.

VII. Moreover it is observed of the Lion, that he sleeps but little, and with
his Eyes open; or as some others note, he having great Eyes, and so small
Eyelids, they cannot wholly cover his Eyes.

VIII. The Lion will fall upon no Creature, except he be in Hunger, or is
greatly provoked.

IX. The Lion (as Pliny observes) cannot endure to be looked asquint upon by
any. Pliny, lib. 8. p. 202.


X. Again, of all wild Beasts, it is observed that the Lion, if one do fall
down, and prostrate himself before him, as it were, and petition for his Life,
he will spare him. Take Pliny's own Words; The Lion alone, Pliny lib. 8. p. 201.
of all wild Beasts, is gentle to those that humble themselves unto him,
Corpora magnanimo satis est prostrasse Leoni. Ovid.
and will not touch any such upon Submission, but spares what Creature soever
lies prostrate before him.

XI. A Lion (as Pliny, and diverse other great Naturalists tell us) is a great
Enemy to Apes and Wolves.

Parallel.
I. THat God, that comes forth in a way of Judgment against the Wicked, is a
terrible God. Hence it is said, He shall roar out of Sion. Joel 3.16.
The Threatenings of God are as the Roaring of a Lion, and terrify the Wicked,
as a Lion does the more impotent Animals.

II. When the Face of God is set against a Soul or Nation, or he be moved to
Frowns, Indignation, and Wrath against them, let all stand clear: How ready are
all to fly, when God rises up to the Prey? that is, to be avenged on the
Ungodly.

III. None can deliver themselves out of God's hands, when he comes forth
against them as an hungry Lion. God tells us* He will arise to the Prey, and
all the Earth shall be devoured with the Fire of his Jealousy. Zeph. 3.8.
Isa. 43.13.
-- There is none can deliver out of his hand; neither Power, nor Policy,
Craft, nor outward Force, will signify any thing.

IV. The dreadful God, when Sinners fall into his hands, will crush them as a
Lion: Consider this, ye that forget God, Psalm. 50.
lest he tear you in pieces. -- I will arise, and devour at once, Hos. 13.8.
I will rent the Caul of their Heart, and there will I devour like a Lion.
Luther.
A Reverend Divine has an excellent Note upon this place: The Lord will do as
a Lion does; He more immediately will strike out their Hearts, and punish them
with spiritual Plagues and Judgments: And as for their Estates and Bodies, he
will leave them to other Beasts, and they shall plague them that way. Their
Hearts were grown fat, they had a Film about their Hearts, and Instruction
could not get to their Hearts; but God will tear that Caul, that Film from off
their Hearts. Mr. Buroughs has noted further, Borough* on Hosea.
That it denotes the sending Plagues upon the Hearts of wicked Men, and to
leave their Estates, etc. to the Assyrians; confirming Luther's Observation;
and for a further Confirmation, cites Arius Montanus. Arius Montanus


V. The holy God is just in all he does: Just and righteous are thy Judgments,
O Lord. Psalm 48.1.
The right Hand of the Lord is full of Righteousness. Yet he delights to live
in Love, Concord, and real Friendship with all his Creatures; and O how fixed
and constant is he therein, and how loath that any should move him to Anger! But
when once the Covenant of Peace and Amity is broken, and naught but Cruelty and
Injustice appears amongst Men, and the great Ones of the Earth prove Tyrants,
and tear in pieces, and devour the Poor; how is God thereby enraged, or stirred
up to revenge the Breach of his Law? For the Oppression of the Poor, Psalm. 12.5.
says God, will I arise. And he will retaliate upon the Wicked, according to
the Nature of the Evils they have done. Rob not the Poor, because they are
poor; Prove. 22.22.
neither oppress the Afflicted in the Gate: For the Lord will plead their
Cause, and spoil the Soul of those that spoiled them. Rev. 16.5, 6.
And I heard the Angel of the Water say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art,
and wast, and shall be, because thou have judged thus; for they have shed the
Blood of Saints and Prophets, and thou have given them Blood to drink, for they
are worthy. God always proportions the Punishment, to the Nature and Quality of
the Offense.

VI. The Lord narrowly observes those Men that fight against him with a high
hand, who wound his Name, and abuse his People; and surely they must not think
to escape amongst others; tho the Evil may be forgotten by the Sinner, being
formerly done, yet God remembers it. Thus says the Lord, 1 Samuel 15.2, 3.
Go and smite Amalek, I remember what Amalek did, and utterly destroy all they
have. These things have thou done, and I kept silent; Psalm. 50.21
thou thoughtest I had been altogether such an one as thy self: But I will
reprove thee, and set them in Order before thine Eyes. Consider this, ye that
forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.

VII. The Lord that keeps Israel neither sleeps nor slumbreth, his Eyes are
always open, he sees the Sinner at all times. No dark nor secret Place can
hide from him; he beholds the Wicked when they work; Day and Night are alike to
him. He that keeps Israel sleeps not; which is matter of Comfort to them:
Psalm. 121.3
So he that destroys their Enemies sleeps not, which is Ground of Terror to
them.

VIII. The Lord, tho his Wrath be dreadful as a Lion's, yet he is not so ready
to fall upon his Creatures presently. He breaks not in upon them, until he is
greatly provoked, and there is no Remedy; but then he falls terrible upon them
indeed, 2 Chronicles. 36.16, 17.
like as an hungry and incensed Lion.

IX. The Lord hates those that look asquint upon him; we mean those Professors,
that have by and sinister Ends of their own, that have not a right and pure Eye
to his Glory in what they do. The Lord loves Uprightness in all our Ways and
Carriages to him. 1 Chronicles. 29.17.


X. God is full of Clemency and Bowels to all that submit to him. When he sees
a poor Creature to humble himself, and fall down at his Feet, and petition for
Mercy, O how ready is he to forgive and pass by all former Treasons and
Rebellions against him! See thou how Ahab humbles himself? I will not, 1
Kin. 21.19.
says the Lord, because he has humbled himself, bring the Evil in his Days.
Yet this Ahab was an abominable Wretch in God's sight, a Monster of Wickedness;
therefore it is said, There was none like Ahab, who sold himself to work
Wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his Wife stirred up. Ephraim
provoked God to Anger, 1 Kin. 21.23.
but he bemoans himself, and repents with Tears, and smites upon his Thigh,
with Shame and Confusion of Face; and what says God now to Ephraim? Jer. 30.20.
I will surely have Mercy upon him, my Bowels are troubled for him, I will
surely have Mercy upon him, says the Lord. I will not execute the Fierceness
of mine Anger. Hosea 11.8, 9.
I will not return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God, and not Man; my Heart is
turned in me, my Repentings are kindled together. Tho God is as terrible as a
Lion, yet it is only to the Impenitent, and those that stand out against him.

XI. God is a great Enemy to Flatterers and Tyrants, which sooner or later will
be the Subjects of his Wrath and Fury, whom he will tear in pieces, and devour.



Simile.
THe Lion is a proud and lofty Creature, a tyrannical and cruel Beast, a great
Destroyer of Sheep, Lambs, and other poor, innocent and harmless Creatures;
besides he has many other evil Qualities. Hence the Devil and wicked Men are
compared to a Lion; to which Similes we refer you.

Disparity.
IN diverse respects God cannot by any means be compared to a Lion. He is not
proud, cruel, nor will he cast off or destroy an upright and innocent Person,
whatever the Provocation be; but He is, in the highest degree of Eminency,
quite contrary to all these evil Qualities, as is showed elsewhere.



Corollaries.
1. IS God compared to a Lion in those respects you have heard? then let
Sinners tremble, for they are like to be the only Prey of this dreadful and
terrible God. Art thou able to encounter him, or to stand before him? I will be
unto Ephraim as a Lion, Hos. 5.14.
and as a young Lion to the House of Judah: I, even I will tear, and go away,
and none shall rescue him. Does not this Lion begin to roar? Will a Lion roar
in the Forest, when he has no Prey? Shall the Trumpet be blown in the City,
and the People not afraid? Amos 3.4, 6, 8.
Sure God is arising up to the Prey, and He will shake terribly the Earth. What
will ye do, can you stand before his Indignation?

2. Is God compared to a Lion? let Sinners take heed, lest they awake and rouse
him up.

3. See from hence what the Nature of Sin is; It Is only that which causes God
to break forth against Man, as an hungry Lion. It Is Sin that provokes him to
Anger, and fills him with Wrath and Indignation. God greatly delights in Mercy;
and to execute Judgment, is called his strange Work. Isa. 28.21.


4. There is no way for the guilty or rebellious Soul to take, but to fall down
before the dreadful God, to prostrate it self at the feet of the Lion of the
Tribe of Judah: He will have Mercy on thee, if thou do submit thy self unto
him.

God as a Leopard.
Hosea 13.7. And as a Leopard will I observe them.


Simile.
I. THe Leopard is the same Beast called the Panther; he is a great Enemy to
Man, and so fierce, that immediately he flies into the Face of him, and pulls
out his very Eyes.

II. The Leopard is a very swift Beast: Hab. 1.8.
Their Horses are swifter than Leopards.

III. The Leopard in watching his Prey is very subtle; he observes fit Times
and Seasons when to come upon them. Pliny, lib. 8. p. 204.
Pliny shows us, how they hide their Heads, and what great Policy they use in
seizing their Prey.

IV. Naturalists observe, that when a Leopard comes upon his Prey, he leaps
upon it suddenly.

V. It is observed of the Leopard, that he will sleep long, even three days
together; but after he awakes, he is more fierce.

Parallel.
I. WIcked Men fly in the Face of God; Acts 5.39. Acts 7.51.
they are said to fight against him, and to resist him; and now says God, I Will
be like a Leopard, I will as it were fly in your Faces, I will come furiously
upon you in the way of my Judgments: I will not only as a Lion, tear the Caul
of your Hearts; but as a Leopard, I will pull out your Eyes, and ye shall
wander in Darkness.

II. God says, he will be a swift Witness against the Wicked: Swiftly will I
(says God, Joel 3.4.
speaking to the Enemies of his People) return your Recompense upon your own
Heads.

III. In this Scripture chiefly God compares himself to a Leopard, in respect
of watching the Ungodly: As a Leopard will I observe them. This sets out the
fearful Wrath of God against wicked Men. God sets his infinite Wisdom on work,
to find out fit Times and Opportunities to let out his Wrath and Fury upon
them: I will watch over them for Evil. Jer. 44.27.
The Lord watches over his own People for good; but woe to them, that he, like a
Leopard, observes, and watches over to destroy. It Is mavelous to consider,
how long the patient God bears with an ungodly Soul, People, or Nation, ere he
brings his sweeping Judgments in upon them. The wicked think God will never
strike, because he defers the Execution of his Wrath, and hence they are
hardened in an evil Work. Psalm. 50.21. Psalm. 10.11.13.14.
When alas poor Souls! they are greatly mistaken; God is watching for a fitter
Time, wherein he will get himself a greater Name, and more Glory in their
Destruction. We have a plain Proof of this in Pharaoh King of Egypt; God, like
a Leopard, observed him, and watched over him for Evil; and at last, tho it was
not presently, got hold of him, and broke his Bones, and destroyed his Power,
and all his mighty Host. God's Time of Executing his Judgments and Wrath upon
the Ungodly, is the most amazing and terrible: In due time shall the Feet of
the Wicked slip.

IV. God, tho he seem to tarry long before he comes upon the Ungodly, yet when
he does come, he leaps (as it were) upon them, comes on a sudden: I will come
upon thee as a Thief. Rev. 3.3.*
The Wicked will be surprised, when Vengeance comes to be executed upon them.

V. God, tho he may seem to be asleep, and to hold his peace, and let Sinners
alone; Isa. 42.14.
yet will he at last awake out of sleep, and then let Sinners look to it.



God compared to a Bear.
Hosea 13.8. I will meet them as a Bear bereaved of her Whelps.


THis is the third Simile God makes use of in this place: I will mee^^ them as
a Bear bereaved of her Whelps.

Simile.
I. THe Bear is a very fierce Creature, very terrible. Two She-Bears tore forty
two Children at once. His Voice is fierce, says one, he is fearless in his
Rage.

II. It Is observed, that the Bear will not willingly fight with, or set upon a
Man, unless he be as it were forced thereunto.

III. No Creatures (as Naturalists tell us) love their Young more than the Bear.

IV. The Bear is furious, and in a dreadful Rage, when she is bereaved of her
Young; as appears by Hushai's Words to Absalom: Thou know, 2 Samuel 17.8.
that thy Father and his Men they be chafed in their Fury, as a Bear bereaved
of her Whelps. In the Field let a Bear robbed of her Whelps, meet a Man, rather
than a Fool in his Folly. Prove. 17.^^2.
She is fierce at all times, as was hinted before; but above all, if she be
robbed of her Whelps.

Parallel.
I. WHo is so fierce and terrible as the great God, whose Anger is resistless,
and whose just Wrath, when provoked, is unavoidable?

II. God does not willingly afflict, fight with, or grieve the Children of Men,
till their daring Impudence, and often repeated Provocations, force him (as it
were) to do it.

III. No Creatures that God has made, love their Young or Offspring, as God
does them that fear him. A Woman may forget her sucking Child, Isa. 49.15.
yet will not he forget his Children. His Love exceeds the Love of Women to
their tender Babes.

IV. O how furious is the Almighty! how is he in an holy Rage, if any hurt his
poor Children! They that touch you, touch the Apple of mine Eye. Zach. 2.8*
What then will become of the bloody Persecutors, that have not only bereaved
God of his Children, but cruelly torn them to pieces, boared out their Eyes,
roasted them alive, flayed their Skins off, and burned them at the Stake to
Ashes, and put them to all the horrid Tortures they could devise? If God will
meet his own People, if they sin against him, and provoke him, as a Bear
bereaved of her Whelps; how will he meet Babylon, bloody and merciless Papists,
and other cursed Persecutors of his People: The Day of Vengeance, says he, is
in my Heart, and the Year of Recompenses: For the Controversy of Zion he will
strike through Kings, in the Day of his fierce Wrath. Shall not God avenge the
Cause of his own Elect, that cry unto him day and night? Yea, he will avenge
them speedily, and come forth against their Enemies, as a Bear bereaved of her
Whelps.



God compared to a Moth,
Hosea 5.12. I will be unto Ephraim as a Moth.


THat we may understand the Nature and Quality of this little Creature, and the
Reason of the Comparison, the Parallel following is offered, with a practical
Application. The Scope of the Text is a Denunciation of a strange Judgment,
which shall corrode and consume them; the Cause and Ground of which is
delivered in the preceding Verses* viz. Because they have resisted the Commands
of God, and followed the wicked Commands of Jeroboam, and his Princes:
Therefore, says God, I will be unto Ephraim as a Moth.

Observe. That God, in bringing Judgments and Miseries upon a rebellious People,
will be as a Moth. And in what respects take as follows.

Simile.
I. A Moth is a Creature, that corrodes or devours exceedingly, whatever
Garment or Cloth it does seize upon, and makes it good for very little.

II. A Moth will not only eat Woollen Cloth, and Garments of a low Price, but
those that are very rich, yea, upon costly Velvets, as Experience shows.

III. A Moth comes not upon such Cloth and Garments, as are carefully and
wisely kept from Dust and Filth: And therefore those Writers, that mention the
hurtful Nature of this Creature, advise to cleanse, and keep such things as are
subject to this Creature from all Dust and Filth whatsoever, and then they need
not fear the Moth; Topsal Hist. of four-footed Beasts, p. 1100, 1101.
and ascribe the Ways and Means, how it may be done.

IV. A Moth eats and devours Garments secretly; you may not quickly spy him
out; he makes no Noise of his coming; you cannot tell whether it be got into
your Cloth or Garments, or not, at first.

V. A Moth eats and spoils by degrees: It does not consume and spoil a Garment
all at once, but by little and little, till it is quite spoiled, and good for
nothing.

VI. A Moth corrupts and destroys insensibly. These Worms, says Mr. Topsall,
when they have by degrees insensibly eat off the out most Superficies of the
Cloth, then they eat up the inward Part, and so insinuate themselves into the
middle Substance of it; and those that search never so well for them, can
hardly find them. A Man may think his Cloth or Garment is good, by the outward
View of it; yet when he looks and proves it thoroughly, he will find it full of
Holes, and good for little.

Parallel.
I. GOD, when He breaks forth upon a People or Nation in a way of Judgment and
Wrath, destroys and makes all desolate therein. Behold therefore, Ezekiel. 25.7
I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a Spoil to the
Heathen, and I will cut thee off from the People, and I will cause thee to
perish: I will destroy thee, and thou shall know that I am the Lord.

II. God, when he comes forth to spoil a People or Nation for their Sins, will
not spare the Rich more than the Poor, the King more than the Peasant: All must
expect to taste alike of the same Cup. As they have sinned together, they must
all suffer together.

III. God will not come upon a holy and godly People and Nation, to spoil and
destroy like a Moth, those that labor to keep themselves pure and clean from
the Dust and Filth of Sin, and the Corruptions of this World; such need not
fear, that God will be as a Moth to them.

IV. God sometimes comes secretly upon a People, in a way of Wrath; he
surprises them on a sudden, comes on them, as Travail upon a Woman with Child.
They have thought themselves safe from Danger, and suddenly dreadful Confusion
breaks out against them: Peace may be on the Night, but Horror in the Morning.

V. God goes on also in bringing Ruin on a People or Nation by degrees. He
does it gradually many times; as in that of Amos, touching Israel: Amos 4.6.7,
8, 10, 11.
I have given you Cleanness of Teeth in all your Dwellings, and Want of Bread
in a^^l your Places. Ay, but this wrought no Reformation; therefore he takes
another Step, and proceeds yet further: I have withheld the Rain from you,
-- Yet have ye not returned unto me, etc. But this would not do neither; he
therefore goes on with another Gradation: I have smitten you with Blasting and
Mildew: When your Gardens, Vineyards, and your Fig Trees, and your Olive Trees
increased, the Palmer-Worm devoured them: Yet have you not returned unto me,
says the Lord. Therefore he brought upon them the Pestilence, after the manner
of Egypt; and overthrew some of them, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. And
thus he went on step by step, till he like a Moth destroyed them utterly.

VI. God lets out his Wrath and Displeasure so insensibly, that Sinners
perceive it not a long time; yet they decay, and grow weak, and their Beauty,
Strength, and Glory falls off: They seem outwardly amiable and in a good
condition, and say with Sampson, (when his Locks were cut off, and his Strength
gone) I will rise up as at other times; but quickly find themselves another
People, and that God has forsaken them. And what an easy thi^^g is it for any
to overcome and destroy them? When the inward Life and Heart of a People is
gone, they soon become a Reproach an Derision to their Enemies; and yet all
this while may not per^^eive the ^^ause of their Ruin, nor how God is a Moth
unto them.



Quest. But here possibly some may enquire, How is God said to be a Moth unto a
People?

Answ. In Answer unto this Question, take what Mr. Buroughs has said, in his
Exposition on Hosea. Says he,

First, God is a Moth in the Spirits of a People: There is a secret way of
God's Wrath upon their Spirits, which is not perceived. Buroughs on Hosea, p.
478.
A Nation grows weak and cowardly; now the Weakness and Cowardliness of a
People that were once formidable, 1. Weakness.
shows a Judgment of God upon them. So it was in Israel, 2 King. 15. their
Governors did what they listed, they killed one another, and the People laid
down quie^^ly, one durst not complain of what was done.

2. Then a base Sloth of Spirit, which seizes upon the Hearts of Men, Dullness,
2. Sloth.
a Sordidness of Spirit, minding low things, not regarding any worthy or
honorable Achievement. When People are thus, God is a Moth unto them.

3. When Jealousies rise in the Spirits of a People one against another, then
God is as a Moth to them. 3. Jealousies and Divisions
As we know, a Moth in a Garment makes the Thread not hang firm and close
together, but divides them one from another, by making Holes in the Cloth: Even
thus secret Jealousies and Divisions in a Kingdom consume and destroy them.

4. Base Compliance in Men for their own Ends, and Falseness of Spirits in the
Trust committed to them, 4. Self-Love.
especially those that are put in public Places. When these things appear
among a People, God may be said to be as a Moth unto them in their Spirits.

Secondly, God may be as a Moth in Men's Councels.

As first, in their Blindness, that they may not see the Plots of their
Enemies. They know not their own Advantages, nor how to improve the Opportunity
they have in their Hands. They shall not hit upon right Ways and Means, to
secure themselves from their impending Dangers. There shall be Perplexities and
Contradictions in their Councels, one counselling one way, others another way.
They shall ensnare themselves, and be blasted in their own Councels. And all
this while God does not appear in an outward and hostile way against them, but
there is a Curse upon them; and thus the Lord is as a Moth unto them.

Thirdly; God is as a Moth to a People in their Estates and Commerce one with
another. There shall be a Decay of Trade amongst them; they shall grow poorer
and poorer, and no Man knows how. They sow much, and bring in little; they earn
Wages, and put it into a Bag with Holes. There shall be a secret Curse upon
their Tradings and Estates, that no Man can give a Reason of it.

Fourthly; God is a Moth in the chief Instruments made use of for public Good.
He takes away chief and worthy Persons, and few take notice of it. One is
removed one way, and some in another; and those that remain, either want
Abilities, or else they are treacherous. And if there be any wise and honest
left, they are either blasted, or by one way or another, not in a capacity to
do any Good. And when it is thus with a Kingdom, God may be said to be as a Moth
unto them.

Fifthly; God may be said to be a Moth in the Treasure and Strength of a
Nation. There shall be a great Charge upon the People, and much shall be
gathered together, but none shall know how it is spent, it shall moulder away:
So that every one shall complain of the Burden, and what goes from him; but no
Body almost can see what it comes to.

Sixthly; God is a Moth unto a People in their Religion, (I mean, by suffering
a secret Curse to be upon them) so that their Religion should be corrupted, and
their Wine mixed with Water, their Silver with Dross.

That whilst they hoped to see Religion more pure, and refined from Popish
Mixtures, and other Errors and Corruptions, they shall in a spiritual way be
invaded with greater Darkness and Confusion, and not well perceive the Wrath
and Curse of God that is upon them, by being as a Moth in this respect unto
them.

Inferences.
1. NO People ought to think themselves secure, because God appears not
presently in the height of his Displeasure against them. He may let out his
Wrath in little things, (a Moth is a small thing) and proceeds but a little
way; takes a Step or two with them in a way of Judgment, and then waits a
while, to see what the Effects are. He can by little things, in a secret and
insensible way, spoil and utterly undo a Nation, or a particular Soul. There
may be much Poison in little Drops; so the Wrath of God may be upon thee like a
Moth, in things that thou mindest not; for small and contemptible Things, as
Lice and Flies, proved a great Plague unto the Egyptians.

2. Our own Filth and Corruption within us breeds our Trouble, and is the Cause
of our Undoing. What is it that makes way for the Moth and Rottenness to seize
on Wool or Garments? Is it not the Carelessness and Negligence of Persons, in
not looking after them, and not making use of fit things to keep them clean,
and prevent the Danger that arises from this Worm? The Moth (as Naturalists
tell us) breeds in the Cloth; take heed of inward Filth and Pollution: If you
keep not your Hearts by fit means clean, the Moth will come, and Rottenness
take hold on you.

3. God is slow in Wrath, he punishes by degrees; he exercises much Patience,
ere he destroys a People utterly; before he breaks forth as a Lion or Bear upon
them, he is as a Moth.

4. God has secret Judgments to execute upon a People, or particular Person:
If this was not so, why should he speak of his being as a Moth unto Ephraim?
Let us take heed of secret Sins, lest God consume us by secret Judgments.

5. What a mean and inconsiderable Creature is a Man, yea, a Kingdom, that so
small a thing as a Moth is said to destroy and consume them? God in expressing
himself thus to be as a Moth and Rottenness, speaks with a kind of Contempt
against the Pride of Ephraim and Judah:
They were haughty and proud; but God, to abase and humble them, tells them,
Job 4.19.
a Worm as it were should spoil their Beauty, and destroy them. It Is said of
Man, His Foundation is in the Dust, and he is crushed before the Moth. Indeed,
to be crushed before a Lion is not so much; but that he should be eat up and
devoured by a Moth, this shows what poor, weak, and feeble things, Men and
Kingdoms are. What little reason is there for Men to swell in Pride, and high
aspiring Thoughts of themselves, when alas! God is able to cause Lice or Worms
to destroy them in a Moment? yea, by as weak and contemptible a thing as a
Moth, God can externally or actually make use of to destroy (if he please) the
greatest People in the World: be they never so proud and haughty, they are not
able to defend themselves from the smallest Creature; a Worm or Moth may
consume them.

6. We see how low God condescendeth (says Mr. Buroughs) that he may express
his meaning unto the Children of Men* It is a very strange Expression, for the
high, glorious, and dreadful God, whom the Angels themselves adore; yet for
this God to say of himself, that he will be as a Moth and Rottenness! Durst any
Creature have brought God so low in Expression, if we had it not in the Word of
God? Yet this high and glorious God condescendeth thus low, that he might
express himself the better unto us, that we might understand his meaning.

God a Refuge.
Deuteronomy. 33.27. The Eternal God is thy Refuge, etc.

Psalm. 46.1. God is our Refuge and Strength, etc.


IN these, and many other Texts, God is called a Refuge. To the clearer
understanding of which, we shall, 1. Show the Import and Signification of the
Word. 2. Give the various Acceptations of it. 3. Show in what respects the Term
is attributed to God, by way of Parallel. 4. Produce some Disparities. 5. Draw
some brief Inferences from the Whole.


I. This Word is expressed in Hebrew by (...), and is by Interpreters sometimes
rendered Hope, sometimes safe Habitation, etc. But commonly Refuge is called in
Latin, Refugium, which is a Place, Person, or Thing to which we fly, that we
might be safe from Danger. It signifies (in the full Latitude of it) any Place
of Rescue, Leigh Crit. Sacr.
Succor, or Safety; it is called in Greek, (...), and is derived of (...),
perfugio, properly noting a flying to some place of Security; and is indeed a
most splendid Metaphor, most significantly demonstrating the Frame of their
Minds, who (when on every side beset with inextricable Troubles) upon the
Despair of human Help, repair to God as their only Refuge.

II. This word Refuge is put for Security against a Multitude of Enemies, such
as Israel was to be engaged against in the Land of Canaan.

1. It Is put, to quiet and fortify the Mind against great and amazing
Providence, Psalm. 46.1.

2. For Preservation of Public Safety and Propriety, from the Invasions of
wicked or envious Men, Psalm. 48.3, 4.

3. For Security of Life, in case of Danger, Psalm. 71.7, 10.

4. For Security of the Soul in spiritual Danger, Heb. 6.18, 19.

5. For Security against the Avenger of Blood, by God's Appointment.

6. For Safety against Persecution, Acts 14.6. The Apostles fled for Refuge to
the Cities of Laconia, etc.

III. The Word, in its proper Notation is allusive to Security in case of human
Perils; and from thence, by a Metaphorical Translation, is applied to God. For
the further Illustration of which, take the following Parallel.

Metaphor.
I. THis word Refuge, implies Persons in Distress.

II. It also implies a Place, Thing, or Person, capable to relieve the
Distressed in their Affliction.

III. A Refuge, that it might be useful to distressed ones, ought to be well
known.

IV. It Is necessary also that a Refuge be not far off, when Dangers approach.

V. A Refuge ought to be of sufficient Strength, to save or secure from the
Power and Rage of the greatest Enemy.

VI. A Refuge secures against a Multitude of Enemies. The Usefulness of ^^
Refuge.
Israel had many Thousands, nay, Millions, especially when they came to
encounter with the seven Nations of Canaan; it was t^^n God told them, He would
be a Refuge or Safety to them.

Deuteronomy. 33.12, 33.
VII. A Refuge secures from the Wrath of a King, which is as the Roaring of a
Lion. When David was pursued by enraged Saul, 2 Samuel 22.1, 2, 3, 4.
he was forced to fly to Places of Refuge, gets sometimes into a Cave, another
time into a Rock, by which means he escaped; which he ascribes to God.

VIII. A Refuge is good to quiet and fortify the Mind against any amazing
Providence; when the angry Heavens, with their direful Motions, threaten the
Earth, and Horror seizes upon all Hearts, and Paleness covers their Faces.

IX. Refuges are for the Preservation of Public Prosperity, from the Envy and
Malice of Enemies.

X. A Refuge secures and preserves the Life, when in danger: When David's Life
was pursued, he fled for Refuge, etc. The like of the Manslayer.

XI. A Place or City of Refuge was provided against the Avenger of Blood, by
the Appointment of God, for the Retreat of the Manslayer.

XII. The Ways to the Cities of Refuge were to be made thirty two Cubits broad;
and all Stumbling Blocks, and other Impediments taken thereout.

See Mr. Goodwin's Moses and Aaron.
XIII. The Ways to the Cities of Refuge were made easy to find; at every
Partition, or cross Turnings, they set up a Writing, Mr. Ainsworth.
Refuge, Refuge.

XIV. The Manslayer was to fly with speed to the City of Refuge, lest the
Pursuer overtook him.

XV. The Manslayer was not only to fly to the City of Refuge, but to get into
it, and abide there, till the Death of the High Priest then living.

XVI. Those that were got into the City of Refuge, before the Avenger of Blood
overtook them, were safe, and delivered from Death.

Parallel.
I. SInners, nay, the Godly themselves, are oft-times in great Danger and
Distress: 1 Samuel 2^^* 7.
In my Distress I called upon the Lord.

II. God is the only Refuge, who is fit and capable to relieve them that fly
to him.

III. Those who would have God for their Refuge in the Day of Trouble, ought to
know or understand what a God he is. God is known in her Palaces for a Refuge:
Psalm. 48.3. Psalm. 9.10.
And they that know his Name, will put their Trust in him.

IV. God is near to all that call upon him, that call upon him in Truth: Psalm.
145.8.
Not only a God afar off, but a God at hand.

V. God is a Refuge infinite in Strength, Jer. 23.23.
able to save all to the uttermost, Heb. 7.25.
who by Christ Jesus fly to him.

VI. God secures his Church and People from innumerable Multitudes of Infernal,
Internal, and External Enemies. Edom, Psalm 83.4, 5, 6, 7.
the Ishmaelites of Moab, the Hagarens, Gebal, Ammon, Amalek, with the
Inhabitants of Tire, were all confederate against God's Israel; yet by being in
this glorious Refuge, they were safe.

VII. God secures his People from the Wrath of the King of Darkness, who goes
up and down like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour; 1 Pet. 5.6.
and from the Wrath of Antichrist, that bloody-Beast, and Firstborn of Hell.
And were it not for this Refuge, we had long ago been destroyed.

VIII. God being the Saints Refuge, greatly animates, encourages, and fortifies
their Minds, against all the dreadful and amazing Dispensations of God: When
there are Signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars* and on the
Earth, Mat. 24.29 Luke 21.25, 26.
Blood, Fire, and Vapor of Smoke: When there is Distress of Nations, with
Perplexity, the Sea and the Waves roaring, and Men's Hearts failing for Fear,
and for looking after those things which are coming upon the Earth: For the
Powers of Heaven shall be shaken. In such a Day as this the Godly are secured,
and, with David, say, Under the shadow of thy Wings will I make my Refuge,
until these Calamities are ^^ver-past. I will both lay me down in Peace, and
sleep; Psalm. 57.1. Psalm. 4.8.
for thou, Lord, make me to dwell in Safety.

IX. God, as a Refuge, preserves the public Prosperity and Weal of his Church
and People, from the Envy of Devils, and other implacable Enemies. L^^, th^^
Kings were assembled, they passed by together, (says David) they marvelled,
and were troubled, Fear took hold on them: Why, what is the Matter? Because God
discomfits them: They are broken in pieces, and cannot destroy the Joy of Mount
Zion: How comes this about? Psalm. 48.3.
God is known in her Palaces for a Refuge.

X. God is a Refuge, who saves from Death, and secures our Lives from the
Destroyer, and bloody-minded Men. B^^bylon always thirsts after, and is ready
to spill the Blood of God's Children; and were it not that they are preserved
under the Wings of the Almighty, Psalm. 142.2, 3.
or secured by his glorious Arm, they had been cut off Root and Branch before
now.

XI. Jehovah is a Refuge, in and through Christ, against Conscience, Wrath, and
the Law, who accuse and pursue poor Sinners; Acts 4.12*
and this by the Appointment of God: Neither is there Help or Succor for them
any where else.

XII. There is a plain Way made to God the Father, (this blessed Refuge) for
Sinners, through the Blood of Jesus, all Stumbling Blocks and Obstructions
being removed. Ephesians. 2.18. Heb. 10.1^^


See Christ the Way.

XIII. God has made such Provision, and laid down such clear Directions
leading to himself, in the holy Scripture, that no wise and wary Man can
mistake or lose his Way.

XIV. Those that would find Refuge in God, must not neglect flying to him by
Faith and Regeneration: Heb. 2.2*
How shall we escape, if we neglect so great Salvation?

XV. Those that would find Refuge in God, must not abide without in a visible
Profession, and go no further, but get a Dwelling in the Almighty, and there
abide as long as they live.

See God a Habitation.

XVI. Those that get into God, by the Blood and Mediation of Jesus, before
Wrath and Vengeance overtake them, or Death cut them off, are safe, and
graciously delivered from eternal Death. There is no Condemnation to them that
are in Christ Jesus, etc. Romans 8.1.




Metaphor.
I. OTher Refuges save or secure only from human Violence and Danger.

II. Other Refuges may not be ready at hand, nor quickly found in Time of
Calamity.

III. Other Refuges may not be out of the Reach and Attack of the Enemy, nor be
strong enough to secure against Assaults.

IV. Many Men fly to Persons and Things for Refuge, which greatly deceive
them. They sometimes make Gold and Silver their Hope; trust in their Trades,
Friends, Princes, Parliaments, and Potentates of the Earth; but in vain, alas!
is Salvation hoped for from such Hills and Mountains. Psalm. 142.4.
I looked on my right hand, and behold, there was no Man would know me: Refuge
failed me, and no Man cared for my Soul. How have many been undone, in former
and latter Days, by flying to false and deceitful Refuges, expecting they would
be Fathers and Nourishers to them? There is no Trust to be put in the Sons of
the Mighty. The Pope and his Cardinals have a Proverb amongst them, Mercatorum
est, non Regum, stare Juramentis: It Is for Merchants, not for Princes, to stand
to that which they have sworn.

V. The Cities of Refuge under the Law, were only for the Manslayer, who by
Chance or Casualty killed a Man, not for wilful Murderers.

Disparity.
I. GOD is a Refuge, that saves and delivers from Spiritual and Eternal Dangers.

II. God is a Refuge that is always at hand, and to be found by all such as
seek him timely, before the Day of Grace be over.

III. God is a high and strong Refuge. Hence David resolved to make his Refuge
under the Wings of the Almighty; Psalm. 57.1, 2.
by which Phrase (as some observe) he compares the Lord to an Eagle, (to which
he is resembled in Deuteronomy. 32.11.) and himself to one of the Eagle's Young. The
Eagle mounts aloft, dwells on high. No Man (says Pliny) can reach or touch the
Eagle's Nest, being made upon (or rather in) the Clifts of the inaccessible
Rocks. She abides (as says Job) on the Crag of the Rock, and strong Place:
Job 39.31*
There she hides her young Ones, who are safe enough: But a godly Man, who
makes his Refuge in the Rock of Ages, under the Wings of God's Providence and
Protection, is far more secure.

IV. God is a Refuge that will not deceive the Soul, whosoever it be, that
flies to him; nor never did fail any who took up Sanctuary in him. God cannot
fail in his Ability to save, he is infinite in Power; he cannot fail in Wisdom,
because he is All-wise, yea, Wisdom it self in the Abstract. Time does not
cause him to decay, nor grow old: He abides the same, Deuteronomy. 33.27.
and his Years fail not; the Eternal God is thy Refuge. He is righteous and
just, and will not suffer his Faithfulness to fail. Tho others have neither
Faithfulness, Bowels, nor Humanity in them; yet he who said, Heb. 13 5.
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, has also said, His Mercy and
Goodness endures for ever. Look to the Generations of old: Did ever any trust
in God, and were confounded? Or whom did he ever despise, that called upon him?

V. God in Christ is a Refuge, not only for Man-slayers, but Murderers,
Adulterers, yea, the vilest and worst of Sinners, if by true Faith and
Repentance they seek to him. Manasses, who made Jerusalem run down with Blood;
2 King. 2^^.16. Luke 7.48.
and Mary Magdalen, found Refuge (viz. Pardon and Forgiveness) in him.



Inferences.
1. HEnce we may perceive, that the Godly in this World are exposed to great
Afflictions and Calamities.

2. Yet God has not left them without a Place of Refuge.

3. That there is no Safety but in the Almighty.

4. That it is the only Way and Wisdom of sinful Men, to fly with speed to God
through Christ, if they would find Mercy, and Sanctuary from Wrath and
Vengeance.

5. This also shows the happy State and Condition of the Godly.

6. Let Believers have a Recourse to God in the Day of Trouble, by Prayer and
Humiliation.

7. Besides, we may learn, how vain and fruitless all the Attempts and
Approaches of the Wicked are, against God's Church, and holy Men.

8. Why should the Godly then fear in the Day of Evil, that have such a Refuge?

See Strong-Tower, Habitation, Hiding Place.

God an Householder.
Mat. 21.33. Hear another Parable, There was a certain Householder, etc.


BY the Scope and Meaning of this Parable, it appears, that GOD the Father is
that Householder intended in this Text of Scripture.

1. Because it was he that planted the Vineyard. We take Vineyard for the
World, or the State of the Jews in the Land of Canaan.

2. He hedged it round about, he dug a Wine Press, and built a Tower.

3. He set it, and farmed it out to Husbandmen. God made the World, and all
things therein, divided it by Lot, since Adam, and set a Determination to the
Bounds and Habitations thereof.

4. It was God who sent the Prophets, Judges, Apostles, Priests, and Kings to
receive the Fruits of them.

5. It appears evidently, that it was God who sent his Son to the Husbandmen,
who killed him, etc.

6. To put all out of doubt, this Son is said to be the Cornerstone laid in
Zion, and that by the Lord himself: This is the Lord's doing, and it is
mavelous in our Eyes.

The Word Householder imports three things: 1. One that is possessed of an
Estate. 2. One that has Business to do. 3. One that has a Family of Servants
to employ.


All these seem fairly applicable to God, Metaphorically.

1. God is possessed of an Estate: The Earth is his, and the Fullness thereof,
the World, and all the Inhabitants therein.

2. God has Business to do in this World, to replenish the Earth, and to
establish his Will in respect of Worship and Service: Thy Will be done on
Earth, as it is in Heaven, etc.

3. God has a Family of Servants to govern: The Soul of the Father, Ezekiel. 18.4
as well as the Soul of the Son, is mine: And he says to these Servants, Dwell
in the Land, do good, and employ the Talents given you.

God is (and may not unfitly be compared to) a Householder. Here I shall give
you the Properties of a Householder, according to the Sense of the Word, and the
true Intent of the Text; and so go on, by God's help, in prosecution of the
Parallel.

Metaphor.
I. AN Householder is the first Founder or Setler of a Family; for there can be
no such thing as a Householder, Family, etc. without a raising, or first
founding of it: And there can be no such Raising or Founding, without a
Beginner or Founder; where there are Effects, there must be a Cause producing
those Effects.

II. An Householder, that is to be concerned with Family-Affairs, does frame and
build a House or Dwelling, as a very needful Convenience for himself and Family.

III. A good Householder gets him a Family suited to all his Purposes, not
thinking it meet to be alone, he does espouse a Wife, and bring in Servants,
etc.

IV. A good Householder fits his Family or Household for Business.

V. A good Householder sets things in good Order, leaves nothing confused, to
occasion Quarrelling and Strife; sets all in their proper places: His eldest
Son and Firstborn is made the Chief; the rest of the Children and Servants are
made Inferiors to him; Genesis 49.
he is called, the Excellency of Dignity.

VI. A good Householder shows and appoints his Family their Work; some to be
employed in the House, some in the Barn and Stable, and some in the Field.

VII. A good Householder makes good Provision for the Subsistence of his
Family; he knows that they cannot labor, without Sustenance and Supplies.

VIII. A good Householder keeps his Place, leaves not his Family when Discord
happens amongst them; he accounts it his Work to heal and strengthen, not to
destroy a House.

IX. A good Householder lays out Ground for his Servants Employment, and
Familie's Supply; one Place for a Vine, and another for a Garden, with others
for Fields and Meadows, for Hay, etc.

X. A wise and good Householder contrives the best Situation, as well as the
best Methods of Accommodation, for his Household; plants them as near as may be
to Pools, Rivers, pleasant Streams, and fruitful Springs, where such are, or
may be formed and made.

XI. A good and wise Householder teaches and instructs his Household in good
Manners, and fit Behavior, shows Faults, and dislikes uncomely and debauched
Actions and Examples, is angry at reiterated Untowardness. Abraham taught his
Children, Moses instructed Israel; David taught Solomon, was angry with
Absalom, as Ely with his Sons.

XII. A good and wise Householder loves his Household with a natural and paternal
Love.

XIII. A good and wise Householder takes care for the Preservation and Security
of his Family, in respect of Health, and Safety against Thieves and Enemies;
sends for a Physician, as soon as he finds any ill; orders the Doors and Gates
to be kept fast with Bars and Locks.

XIV. A good Householder bears, and forbears long, is not rash and hasty, but
meek and patient, under present Provocation.

XV. A wise Householder is not always wroth, retains not Anger out of spite,
soon becomes reconciled, upon Submission, and using Means of Pacification.

XVI. A good Householder is full of Sympathy, is much concerned and grieved,
when things go ill, and are out of Order.

XVII. A good Householder gives reiterated Instances of his Favors, he is
familiar with his Family, speaks to them, and smiles on them, hears them when
they call, helps them up when they fall.

XVIII. A wise and good Householder deals plainly and uprightly with his Family,
shows them the Danger of Disobedience, both to Children and Servants, hides
nothing from them that may be for their Good; lets his Servants know, that if
they obey not, he will turn them out of Service; and Children, if they are
disobedient, they shall not only be beaten, but also dispossessed of many
Privileges and Inheritances.

XIX. A good Householder encourages his Family by present Rewards, and future
Promises; he pays his Servants well for their Work, gives his Children Promise
of Reward, even an Inheritance.

XX. A good Householder gives Correction in season for Faults committed: Fathers
after the Flesh, and Masters, chastise disobedient Ones for Faults.

XXI. A good Householder is so prudent, moderate, and gentle, in his
Administration of Severity, that there is no Cause of Blame and Censure; his
Equity and Authority justify his Ways.

XXII. A good and wise Householder, when any are obstinate, withdraws the
Manifestation of former Goodness, Favor, and Delight; for if after all good
Means used fruitlesly, they will not be reclaimed, then he frowns on them, and
cannot show his Countenance as at other Times.

XXIII. A wise and good Householder will maintain his own Rights against
Invaders, and keep up his Interest according to Law and Justice, and the Use of
reasonable Means.

XXIV. A wise and good Householder brings all the Spoil taken from his Enemies,
and all the Fruits of his Land, into his own Household; there are his Trophies,
and the Fruits of his Labor found.

XXV. A wise and good Householder shuts all unruly Persons out of Doors, to
preserve Peace and prevent Disturbance. David would not let a wicked Man dwell
with him, nor a Liar stay in his House. Some will divorce a Wife, when she
proves treacherous. Abraham turned or cast out the Bondwoman, and her Son.

XXVI. A wise Householder sometimes becomes an Enemy to those of his own Family,
when his Patience is abused, and they stand out by large Provocations.

XXVII. A wise and good Householder does in his Wrath sometimes swear against
Reconciliation, and future Acceptance.

XXVIII. A wise and good Householder, sometimes and in some Cases, casts off all
Care and Pity, so as to interpose against Evil or Dangers that may befall from
without, but gives up to fearful Ruin.

XXIX. A good and wise Householder is ready to have his Actions tried, and
refuses not to come before a Judge, or before the Determination of tolerable
indifferent Persons.

XXX. A good and wise Householder renders Rewards and Encouragement to his
Family, and Servants that do well: Be thou Ruler over much; enter into the Joy
of thy Lord.

Parallel.
I. THat God is the first Author, that gives Being to Matter, Form, and Order,
is so great and evident a Truth, evinced by Scripture and Reason, that none can
deny it without shaking the very Foundation of Heaven and Earth, and of all
true Piety and Religion: For all things that do appear, were produced by some
Cause pre-existent, or else they did cause themselves; which last cannot be,
because then they must be before themselves, which is a monstrous Absurdity.
See the ancient Records of the World, and all things therein, Genesis 1.

II. God, the most great and good Householder, seeing it very needful and
convenient, has built a House for the Commodity of his Family, yea, many
Houses, suitable to the distinct Parts of his Family, which is very great: One
House fit for Angels, and the Souls of Saints, that is, Heaven; one for Men,
even the Earth; one for a Nursing-House to the Offspring of his Family, and
that is his Church, which is the House of the Living God, 1 Timothy 3.15.
the Nursing-House for his Heirs and eldest Sons. These things have his Hands
begun and finished. He that built all things is God.

III. God did not think it meet to be alone, in the Enjoiment of perfect
Happiness in himself, and therefore has taken into Covenant with himself,
Angels and Men; and for this end was Jesus Christ set up from everlasting, to
gather together in himself, both things in Heaven, and things on Earth, etc.

IV. Thus God, the great and good Householder has done. He has made nothing in
vain, but has fitted each Creature with Natures, to do Work suitable to their
proper Station: The Angels to dwell in Heaven, to praise in Heaven, to fly
through Heaven, to come down into the Air, to visit the Earth, and view the
Sons of Men: Men are fitted to look up to Heaven, to pray, to read, to
contemplate, to reverence God, to propagate, to replenish the Earth: Beasts are
fitted for Labor and Service, as the Horse, the Mule, the Ox, etc. The Sheep,
with all other Creatures, receive Influence from his great and good Spirit, so
as to come to the Place where their Prey is, and where they are to be taken for
assigned Use.

V. God, the great and good Householder, has set all things in Order, both in
the upper and lower World; who is not a God of Confusion, but of Order, in all
the People of his Family. 1 Cor. 14.33. 1 Col. 1.16. Ephesians. 1.20, 21.
Christ his Firstborn is not only King, even the King of the Earth, but the
King of Angels; he is the Head of all Principalities and Powers; Angels next to
him, above Men; Men, God's Representatives and Vicegerents, above Women: The
Man is the Head of the Woman, Parents the Head of their Offspring, and
Children above Servants, and all these above the Beasts of the Field, or
creeping Things of the Earth.

VI. Even thus has God, the great and good Householder, done to all his Family.
He has appointed his Firstborn to be a Mediator, a Priest, an Advocate, to
influence the Gospel and Word; his Angels, to protect; his People in Love to
serve one another, and bear one another Burdens; Women to bear Children, and
nurse them, and to be meet Helps to their Husbands; Parents to love their
Children, Children to honor their Parents; Servants and Subjects to obey their
Supreme; and all these to adore God, and obey the Lord Jesus Christ.

VII. God, this great Householder, has made Provision for his great and large
Family: The Eyes of all things look up and trust in him, he gives them their
Meat in due season: In my Fathers House is Meat enough, and to spare. Heavenly
Manna, as Meat and Food for Angels; heavenly Food, as the Bread of Life for the
Saints; earthly Food, as Corn, Wine and Oil, for Men; Grass and Herbs, etc. as
Meat for Beasts, etc. His Hand gives all things needful. If in the House, he
feeds them; if in the Field, he feeds them, and fills them with good things,
etc.

VIII. God keeps his Place in Heaven: Tho Angels fall out, and go to War; tho
Men differ, the Heavens shake, the Mountains remove, the Winds bluster, the
Waves of the Sea roar and rage; yet the Lord is in Heaven, and he beholds all
Disorders of Men, and still keeps his Place in perfect Tranquillity, and moves
not; for the Good of his whole Household depends upon it; for if it were
possible for the immovable God to leave his Place, all would become a Piece of
Confusion.

IX. God, the wise Householder, has set out the Church for a Vineyard and
Garden, dug a Wine Press, Isa. 5.1.
and built a Tower; the World for a plowed Field; the wise and best Men, both
Divines, Philosophers, Naturalists and Historians, to yield a fruitful Crop of
Teaching and Instruction, to supply his great Household.

X. God, the most wise and good Householder, has contrived the Situation of
his Family, near adjoining to th^^se great Conveniences, of still and stan^^^g
Pools, pleasant and gliding Streams, co^^stant rising and issuing Springs, for
e^^crease of Knowledge, and standing (...) and Government, establishing the
(...) of Religion and Piety, as pleasant Stre^^^ and issuing Springs, for
increase o^^ Knowledge.

XI. God, the great and wise Householder, teaches, instructs, gives forth his
Law, shows them what is good, and required of them; charges his Family to walk
by the Examples of the Best, to walk in Wisdom, to give no Offense, to hold
fast that which is good. God is troubled (as it were) and angry at great
Miscarriages, and unseemly Actions, grieved (if I may with Reverence so speak)
at his very Heart, with particular Instruments, angry with not only some, but
even the whole Household, when the Offenders will not reform.

XII. God loved all his Creation; when he looked upon it, and saw all to be
good, he could do no otherwise, Angels, Men, Beasts, creeping Things, Fowls,
and all inanimate Things. The Church he loves on new Terms: The Father himself
loves you, because you have loved me, and believed that I came forth from God.

XIII. God sent Moses to Israel, when sick of Oppression in Egypt, when
corrupted with Sin in the Wilderness, about the Calf, and had need of
Purgation; Abigail and Nathan to David, on the same account; Hezekiah to
Israel, and Ahab, as well as he had before sent Samuel to David. Peter's Advice
is, to cleanse from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit. He takes care for their
Security, and manifests this Care diversely, gives Cautions to take heed, puts
their Enemies in fear, sometimes restrains in time of Pursuit of seeming
Advantages, orders Doors to be shut, till the Enemies disappear, and the
Indignation be overpast.

XIV. God has to Admiration showed his Patience and Long-suffering to his
Church, to the whole World, to the whole Families of the Earth: He gave the old
World one hundred and twenty Years, bore long with the Murmurers of Israel in
the Wilderness, was forty Years grieved, suffered Jerusalem long before the
first Captivity, longer before the last by the Romans; gives Jezebel, and
Mystery Babylon, Time and Space; spared a sinful World in general, above five
thousand Years.

XV. God will not be always wroth, lest the Object of his Wrath should fail
before him, retains not Anger for ever, takes immediate Notice of Returns, and
forthwith* proclaims Peace and Reconciliation.

XVI. God is plenarily qualified with Bowels of Compassion and Tenderness
toward his People: I have seen the Affliction of my People, Exodus 3.7.
and am come down to deliver. Exodus 6.5. Isa. 63.9.
In all their Afflictions he was afflicted: My Bowels are afflicted for him. He
pities them that fear him, etc.

XVII. God loads (as it were) with Benefits, speaks comfortably, bids others
speak comfortably, as from him: Speak comfortably to Jerusalem: Let us reason
together: Smiles invisibly by Providence, invisibly by Grace and Spirit; hears
Prayer in an accepted Time, helps up his Church and People when they fall:
Aaron rose up by his help; God raised holy David when he fell, Peter in like
manner: Which confirms the Word of his Servant, etc.

XVIII. God demonstrates the great Danger of Disobedience, with all plainness,
by Words at length: If thou do Evil, Sin lies at the Door: All the Curses
of the Book light on the Children of Disobedience, who are separated to Evil,
and destroyed if they do wickedly: He that sins shall die: If you remain
disobedient, he will not prevent your Ruin: He will not hear when you call, but
laugh at your Calamities, and rejoice when your Fear comes, Prove. 1.

XIX. God suffers none to labor in vain, nor spend their Strength for naught
in his Service* He does good unto all; his tender Mercies are over all his
Works: He makes one Day in his Courts, better than a thousand elsewhere. And
the Church said, it was better with her when she abode unde^^ his Conduct, than
when she left it. He will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will be
withold from them that walk uprightly.

XX. God in Love and Faithfulness does correct, rebuke, chasten, and afflict
his People for their Profit. In very Faithfulness have thou afflicted me. Whom
he loves, he rebukes and chastens, to make Partakers of his Holiness: The
Fruits whereof David expresses, It was good for me that I was afflicted: Psalm.
119.71.
Thus when Men are i^^ Heaviness through many Temptations, the Rod drives out
ill Dispositions, and is a good Remedy to cure Folly, etc.

XXI. God renders not to any Man more than is right, that he should enter into
Judgment with God: He lays Judgment to the Line, and Righteousness to the
Plummet; extenuates to Offenders, rather gives less than more: In the midst of
Judgment he remembers Mercy. He debates in measure; and as to the Justice of
the Cause provoking, or measure of Punishments, he appeals to the Justice of
their own Minds: Are not my Ways equal, and yours unequal? Ezekiel. 18.30.


XXII. This has been the common way of God's dealing with Men, as well large
Congregations, as particular Persons: I will hide my Face from this Generation,
etc. Thou art a God that hidest thy self, etc. God left Saul when obstinate,
and would not be found of him in distress. When God leaves a People or Person,
they lose their Strength, and come to Shame and Misery. Woe to him that is alone.

XXIII. God has maintained the Lot of the Righteous throughout all
Generations, kept up his Church from falling, contrived a Seed to serve him. He
will not suffer the Gates of Hell to prevail, nor overthrow his Family.

XXIV. God brake the Head of Leviathan, gave it to be Meat to his People in the
Wilderness, cut Rahab, wounded the Dragon, overthrew great Kingdoms and Armies,
etc. gained Victory over mighty Kings, and brought the ^^ruits of all his Works
into his Church; there are his worthy Acts, Doctrine, H^^b. 11.
and Book of the Acts, and Examples of all his Servants.

XXV. God shut Angels out of Heaven, to preserve Peace; sent Cain unto the Land
of Nod; shut the Old World out of the Ark; put Saul out of the Kingdom, puts a
difference between Egypt and Israel; secludes Hymeneus and Philetus, Hypocrites
and Heretics, and all unclean Persons, that the Peace of the Family may be
preserved; has threatened they that trouble it shall bear their Judgment,
whoever they be. God divorced the Church of Israel, etc.

XXVI. God upon this Ground has (tho he account it his strange Work turned to
be an Enemy to those ^^f his own Household; and has not only cast them out, but
drawn his glittering Sword, made sharp by whetting, bent his Bow, and prepared
his Arrows upon the String, made sick in smiting, and utterly destroyed, a^^ in
the Case of Israel, Judah, and Jerusalem.

XXVII. God swear in his Wrath, that they should not enter into his Rest; and
left them to expectation of fiery Indignation.

XXVIII. Thus God dealt with Israel and Judah, gave Jacob to the Spoil, and
Israel to the Robbers, and was so far from interposing between them and Danger,
that he gave them up to fearful Ruin from the Chaldeans, and to the Romans, in
the Time of Josephus; declaring that his Eye should not pity, neither would he
have Mercy. And as to particular Persons, David told Solomon, that if he
forsook God, God would cast him off for ever. Thus those are confounded, even
as Judas Iscariot was, and as Jesus Christ speaks of the Branches that abide
not, They are cast off, and Men gather them, and they come to Burning; and as
Salt, when good for nothing, is cast to the Dunghill, and trodden under foot.

XXIX. God, that he might be justified in all his Actions, has appointed a
general Judgment, to bring forth his Works and Actions, that he may clear
himself, and overcome when he is judged. Hence it is said, Acts 17.31.
He has appointed a Day in which he will judge the World in Righteousness, call
all his Household to account before the Angels, and there make his Justice shine
as the Sun at Noon, in respect of all his Providence and Dispensations.

XXX. God certainly rewards all Men for well-doing, both in this World, and
that which is to come. Verily, shall one say, there is a Reward for the
Righteous, when there is a God that judges in the Earth: The Righteous shall be
recompensed in the Earth. Godliness has the Promise of the Life that now is,
and that which is to come.



Metaphor.
I. AN Householder in this World has but a small Family, tho never so great a
Person: Solomon was the greatest we read of, yet small in comparison, etc.

II. An Householder in this World is but a Steward under another, etc.

III. An Householder in this World wants Wisdom, and may be defective in respect
of Government over his Household.

IV. An Householder cannot of himself make his Family.

V. An Householder in this World cannot communicate Strength, nor secure from
falling by Sickness or Death, till they have finished the Work which he has
committed to them.

VI. An Householder in this World may be taken away from his Household by human
Force, or by Sickness and Death.

VII. An Householder in this World may be from home, about other Business, not
all times doing his Family good.

VIII. An Householder in this World, tho he be at home, and well, yet he may be
asleep, and Evil come in the same Instant.

IX. An Householder may be taken away captive, or forced to fly from his
Family; tho as valiant as David, as wise as Solomon, as great and mighty as
Belshazzar and Darius.

X. An Householder cannot always preserve his Family in Peace, nor give them
everlasting Rewards.

Disparity.
I. GOD has a very great Family, as numerous as the Stars, or the Sand of the
Sea: The God of the whole Earth shall he be called: The Earth is the Lord's,
and the Fullness thereof. The Fathers and the Children are all his, and the
whole World receives great Benefits by him, etc. He gives all their Meat in due
season; He makes the Sun to shine, and the Rain to fall, on the Just and Unjust.

II. But God is absolute Head and Lord, under no Commission, neither in
subjection to any.

III. God is infinitely wise and good, perfect in Knowledge, has all Treasures
of Wisdom and Knowledge, has Depths of Wisdom and Knowledge, unsearchable, and
past finding out. It Is impossible for him to err or miscarry in any case, his
Way is perfect.

IV. But God is the Maker of his Family, from the highest to the lowest: Thou
have made us, and not we our selves, etc.

V. But God is able to make all Grace abound, to make the Arms of their Hands
strong, to renew their Strength like the Eagle; to make the Weak become as
David, and David as the Angel of God; so as to run and not be weary, to walk
and not faint.

VI. God is always abiding, as he has no beginning of Days, nor end of Life:
He is the eternal and ever-living God.

VII. God is never from home about other Business, cannot be out of the way of
doing his Family good; because every where present, on Earth as well as in
Heaven: He fills his own Work, therefore promised to be with them in the Fire,
and in the Water, and promised never to leave them nor forsake them.

VIII. But God, the Keeper of Israel, neither slumbers nor sleeps; for Night
and Day, the Dark and the Light, are alike to him; and between the Land and the
Sea there is no difference: For his Ways are in the Dark, in the Deep; and his
Footsteps are in the mighty Waters.

IX. But God, yea, the Omnipotent God, cannot be invaded, nor carried away
captive; he keeps his Place, and is immovable. None has an Arm like God; and
by Strength, nor no other way, shall any prevail over him. God is Omnipotent,
Powerful, Invincible, etc.

X. But God, the Preserver of Men, and of the Souls of his Saints, can so
preserve in Peace, that none dar^^s approach to rob his Family of it. God gives
his Family Consolation and good Hope here, and Reward or Inheritance hereafter,
which shall never fade away, nor be taken from them.



Inferences.
1. IF God be an Householder, we infer against Epicures, that he is and must be
concerned in the Affairs of this lower World; why otherwise should all things
look up to him, as the Psalmist says? and how should they be cared for, and
provided for, as Christ himself, and St. Paul averr? God gives not his Spirit
once, and no more; but it is given to his People daily and hourly; it is that
gives us our daily and common Bread, and takes care of us, etc.

2. We infer, how greatly ignorant most of the World are, in that they do not
account it a great Privilege to be under the Conduct of God, and enquire what
they should do to please him.

3. What a mighty Blessing and Privilege they have who are under his Conduct,
that is able to do all manner of Good for them in this World, and reward with
everlasting Life in the World to come.

4. How miserable they will be that are cast out from his Care and Conduct, or
that do abide out, and come not in by accepting his Terms, and endeavor to
please him, to know God in a Way of Love, and be careful to concern themselves
with him, etc.

5. It is of absolute Necessity and Concernment, for all to hasten to come and
reconcile themselves to him, that they may be admitted into his Favor, as the
beloved Ones of his Family and Household. Their standing out inevitably incurs
Misery, for there is no Safety out of his Service and Favor: There is no Peace
to the Wicked, says my God.

God as a Potter.
Isa. 64.8. We are the Clay, and thou art our Potter; we are all the Work of
thy Hand.

Romans 9.21. Has not the Potter Power over the Clay? etc.


ACcording to the usual Method of Scripture-Metaphors, we find the Lord God set
forth under the Metaphorical Notion of a Potter, which shall be illustrated in
the ensuing Parallel.

Metaphor.
I. A Potter is an Artificer, an Artizan or Workman, one skilful to work in
Earth, or to form and make Pots, and other Vessels of Clay.

II. A Potter prepares his Clay or Matter first, of which he intends to make
his Vessels; and when he has made it fit, and ready for the Wheel, he goes to
work.

III. A Potter projects beforehand, what kind of Vessel he will make of such
Clay; he has the Form and Fashion of it in his Mind, before he goes to work;
nay, (and it may be) makes known what a Vessel he will make.

IV. A Potter makes Vessels of diverse Sorts and Sizes, and for several Uses;
some are for more honorable and noble Services than others.

V. A Potter finds sometimes, that whilst he is forming and fashioning his Work
upon the Wheel, the Vessel is marred in his hand, and then he makes another
Vessel of it, as seems good to the Potter. Jer. 18.4.


VI. A Potter has Power over the Clay, of the same Lump, to make one Vessel
unto Honor, and another to Dishonor. Romans 9.21


IX. A Potter takes great care of the Vessels he has made, and bestowed his
Labor and Pains upon, that they may not be broke; for they are brittle Ware,
and he is greatly offended with such as strive to dash them to Pieces.

Parallel.
I. GOD is the Maker of all Men and Things, that ever were, or shall be.

II. God created or prepared the Earth, the Clay, before he formed Man, and out
of it was he made: Genesis 2.6.
And the Lord made Man of the Dust of the Ground.

III. Known unto God are all his Works from the beginning. He contrived in his
eternal Council, what a kind of Creature he would make Man; nay, and at the
time of his Formation, he declared what a rare Vessel he should be: Let us make
Man in our own Image, after our Likeness; Genesis 1.26.
and let him have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and Fowls of the Air, etc.

IV. God makes Vessels of diverse Sorts and Sizes: All Men are not of the like
Stature and Beauty in their first Formation; neither are they so, as they are
made or formed anew in Christ Jesus; for some Vessels are designed by the great
Potter to contain the Golden Oil, and Soul-enriching Treasure, for the emptying
of them into others.

V. God sometimes, whilst he is at work to form and fashion a Soul for his own
Use, by the Preaching of the Gospel, finds the Vessel marred in his hand, the
Clay yields not, nor is pliable; and finding it will not be a fit Vessel for
Honor, Rom 9 21.
he makes a Vessel for Dishonor.

VI. God may do what he will with a rebellious People, that are as a Lump of
Pollution in his hands, as the House of Israel was: If he forms and fashions
any of them to be Vessels of Mercy, Romans 9.22
it is infinite Grace; if he makes some of them, through his Long-sufferance,
and for their abominable Sins, Vessels of Destruction, he is just.

VII. God takes great care of those Pots or Vessels he has made, nay, twice
made, or formed for himself: 1 Chronicles. 16.22.
He gives a Charge concerning them, and rebukes Kings for their sakes; saying,
Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm. The Devil and wicked Men
shall one day go to wrack, for that Violence offered to those curious Vessels
that God has prepared to Glory: Gal. 5.10.
But he that troubles you shall bear his Judgment, whosoever he be.



Metaphor.
I. A Potter has not his Skill in making Vessels from himself, but is taught
by some other Man.

II. A Potter many times wants Skill in framing of some curious Vessels, and
not only so, but Care; and by this means the Vessel is marred, and spoiled in
his hand.

III. A Potter makes not all the Vessels which are upon the Wheel for his own
Use and Profit, but for the Use of others.

IV. A Potter cannot make Vessels, unless he has Clay or Matter to make them
with, or to work upon.

V. A Potter makes Vessels that are very defective, as they first come off the
Wheel.

Disparity.
I. GOd has his Wisdom of, and from Himself.

II. God is infinite in Wisdom, loves all things he goes about, and his Care
is accordingly; a God that is never unmindful of the Work of his Hands: so that
if any Vessel is broke, the Fault is not in him, but either in themselves, or
some cursed Enemy.

III. God made all things for himself, even the Wicked for the Day of Wrath.

IV. God first made the Clay, he created the Dust of the Earth, and then out of
it made or framed Man.

V. God never made or framed any Vessel, but as it came out of his Hand it was
well done, without Fault or Blemish: And God saw all the Work of his Hands, and
behold it was very good.



Application.
1. IS God the Potter, and Man the Clay? This may teach Men to lie low before
the God of Heaven and Earth; what is the Clay in the Potter's hand?

2. We may infer from hence, that Man is not made for himself, but for some
particular Use.

3. And since the Glory of God was the principal Thing he designed, in making
and forming of us; let us see we do not rise up against him in a sinful way, to
his Dishonor.

4. You may know from hence how frail and brittle Man is, sooner broken than a
Potter's Vessel.

See more under the Metaphor of Vessel.

God to the Wicked is a Consuming Fire.
Heb. 12.29. For our God is a Consuming Fire.


WE meet with many Metaphors in the Sacred Scriptures, which set forth the
Terribleness of an angry God to impenitent Sinners, but none more dismal nor
terrible than this: For our God is a consuming Fire.

Observe. The Great God is not only in Scripture-Phrases compared to Fire; but
he is compared (with respect to wicked Men) to a devouring or consuming Fire.

Amongst the Metaphors taken from Elementary Things, we find that God is called
Fire, yea, a consuming Fire, Deuteronomy. 4.24. and 9.3. and 32.22. Isa. 10.17. and
66.15, 16. Ezekiel. 21.31, etc. Which denotes his Wrath against Sin and wicked
Men, in whose Power it is to consume those miserable Persons against whom it
burns, as Fire does Stubble, or other combustible Materials. See Psalm. 18.8.

Metaphor.
I. A Consuming Fire is very dismal; when it breaks out in a Town or City, what
a frightful Cry it causes! what wringing of the Hands! Men tremble, Women
miscarry, Children screech out: It frightens the Fowls of the Air, the Beasts
of the Earth; it turns all Faces into Paleness, and makes the Inhabitants to
run together in Heaps, in Confusion. How amazing were the Flames of Sodom, and
how terrible is the Burning of Mount Aetna!

II. A Fire breaks forth sometimes very suddenly, when none think of it; but
all are, as they judge, very safe and secure: yet in a Moment are they
surprised, when nothing but Horror and Amazement is in the Streets.

III. A dreadful Fire sometimes breaks out in the Night, when Men are asleep;
yea, many times they awake with nothing but Fire about them, and can hear
little else than the hideous Cry, Fire, Fire, Fire, in the Streets.

IV. A consuming Fire destroys exceedingly, it overthrows famous Cities, burns
down Houses; it makes your Marbles, and other curious wrought Stones and
Bricks, to fly; it lays all desolate before it, and makes a fenced City become
as a ruinous Heap. What Ruin did it make on Sodom and Gomorrah, and the Cities
about them? What in London, and in many other Cities and Towns, that might be
mentioned, to evince the outrageous Cruelty of Fire? etc.

V. A consuming, raging, and devouring Fire spares none, nothing that stands in
its way; it will spare the Palace of a Prince, no more than the Cottage of a
Peasant; Gold and Silver is melted by it, as well as Brass and Lead: The
strongest Castle, and best Fortification must down before it; it turns all into
Dust and Rubbish; Cedars and mighty Oaks are consumed before it.

VI. Wood, Hay, and Stubble, are fit Fuel for a consuming Fire to seize upon;
and such things as are combustible make it burn the more vehemently. And if
high and strong Towers cannot stand before a consuming and devouring Fire, how
is it possible for Briars and Thorns?

VII. A dreadful Fire, when it breaks out, turns all Joy into Sorrow; it makes
a Day of Mirth a Day of Mourning, and makes rich Men poor: Nothing
impoverisheth a Person or People more than a consuming Fire.

VIII. Fire, of all Elements, does most cruelly and dreadfully torment. If a
Man or Woman be cast into a Fire, what intolerable Pain and Anguish does it put
them to! Hence the bloody Persecutors have found out, by their Diabolical Art,
those Cruelties, to burn in dreadful Fires the Bodies of God's Children,
thinking they could not put them to more exquisite Pain and Torment: Yea, and
the Punishment of the Damned is set forth by Fire, because nothing is more
terrible to think upon, than to be cast into a Furnace of Fire; tho natural
Fire be so dreadful, yet Hellfire is much more dreadful and tormenting.

IX. A consuming Fire lays waste, and makes desolate in a little Time; in a few
Hours, what famous Towns have been consumed to Ashes? In the fatal Year of
1666, what dismal Ruin and Desolation was made in London, by the last great and
fearful Conflagration! There were above Thirteen Thousand Houses burnt down,
and turned to Rubbish and Ashes, with Eighty seven Parish-Churches, and six
Chapels, besides the Exchange, and many stately public Halls, and magnificent
Buildings; in all amounting to the Loss of near Ten Millions of Pounds Sterling.

Parallel.
I. WHen the consuming Wrath of God furiously breaks out upon a People or
Nation, it causes dreadful Horror; when it seizes upon the Ungodly, it makes
the stoutest Heart to quake and tremble, and it makes the stoutest Hands to
become feeble. At his Wrath the Earth shall tremble, and the Nations shall not
be able to abide his Indignation: It pours out a Fire, Jer. 10.10.
and the Mountains are thrown down before him. Can thy Heart endure, or thy
Hand be strong, in the Day when I contend with thee? Who can stand before his
Indignation? O how will the Wicked fly together in Holes, and quiver like a
Leaf, Rev. 6.16.
and cry to the Rocks and Mountains to fall upon them, and hide them from the
Fear of him that sits on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb?

II. God, like a dreadful and unexpected Fire, breaks out sometimes suddenly
upon the Ungodly. How surprising was that sudden and terrible Handwriting on
the Wall against Belshazzar, Dan. 5.5, ^^
when he was drinking Wine in Bowls? Immediately the King's Countenance was
changed, and he was troubled in his Thoughts, so that the Joints of his Loins
were loosed, and his Knees smote one against the other. When they cry Peace and
Safety, then sudden Destruction comes, as Travail upon a Woman with Child, and
they shall not escape. 1 Thessalonians. 5.3.


III. God comes sometimes upon Men in the Night of their Ignorance and
Unbelief: They lie on their Beds of Ease and carnal Security, and will believe
no Danger, nor fear the Evil that is just at the Door, tho it be told them.
Doubtless, Lot foretold the People of Sodom what was coming upon them, as Noah
did to the Old World, but they regarded it not; now in the Time of their
Ignorance and Darkness, tho it we^^ about the rising of the Sun, the Lord
rained Fire and Brimstone upon them.

IV. God, when he breaks forth in Wrath and Fury, makes most lamentable
Desolation. Says David, Thine Hand shall find out all thine Enemies, Psalm.
21.9, 10.
thou shall make them as a fiery Oven in the Time of thine Anger: The Lord
shall swallow them up in his Wrath, and the Fire shall devour them. And in
another place, Come, see what Desolation the Lord has made in the Earth. Our
God shall come, and shall not keep silence; a Fire shall devour before him,
Psalm. 50.3.
and it shall be very tempestuous round about. Behold, the Name of the Lord
comes from afar, burning with his Anger, and the Burden thereof is heavy; his
Lips are full of Indignation, and his Tongue a devouring Fire. And again,
Behold, the Lord will come with Fire, and with Chariots like a Whirlwind; to
render his Anger with Fury, Isa. 66.15.
and his Rebukes like Flames of Fire. There is a Day near, when the terrible
God will arise, and show himself in this dreadful Appearance. He will gather
the Nations, and assemble the Kingdoms, to pour upon them his Indignation, even
his fierce Anger: Zeph. 3.8.
All the Earth (says he) shall be devoured with the Fire of my Jealousy.

V. God will spare the Mighty and Honorable of the Earth, no more than the
poor and contemptible Ones; the King on the Throne must with Vengeance be
brought down and consumed, as well as the Beggar on the Dunghill; the gallant
Citizen, as well as the inferior Countryman. The greatest Courage then will
fail, and the strongest fleshly Confidence then will signify nothing. Isa.
2.12, to 17.
The Day of the Lord of Hosts shall be upon every one that is lofty, and upon
every one that is proud, and lifted up, and he shall be brought down; upon all
the Cedars of Lebanon, that are lifted up, and upon all the Oaks of Bashan;
upon all high Mountains, and upon all the Hills that are lifted up; and upon
every high Tower, and upon every fenced Wall, that is lifted up with the
Haughtiness of Man, shall the fierce Indignation of the Lord be kindled, even
to the bearing it down, and laying it low, even to the Dust; and the Lord shall
be exalted in that Day. The Mountains quake at him, and the Hills are melted,
and the Earth burns up, (or, is burned up. Zeph. 1.18
) But the whole Earth shall be devoured by the Fire of his Jealousy; neither
their Gold nor Silver shall be able to deliver them in the Day of the Lord's
Wrath.

VI. Wicked, profane, and ungodly Men are fit Matter and Fuel for the Wrath of
God to take hold of; and when they are piled together, with the horrid Guilt
that is upon their Consciences, what a dreadful Fire will there be! Nahum 1.10.
Whilst they are thus folden together as Thorns, and whilst they are drunken as
Drunkards, they shall be devoured as Stubble fully dry.

VII. The consuming Wrath of God, or those Plagues of his Fury, when he rises
up to contend with the Wicked in a way of Vengeance and Indignation, with a
Person or People, turns all their Joy into Mourning, and a bitter Day. I will
(says God by his Prophet) undo all those that have afflicted thee. The Fire of
God's Wrath will utterly impoverish all the Wicked of the Earth, etc.

VIII. It Is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God, viz. God
being a consuming Fire; in respect to this the Apostle spoke these Words, For
our God is a consuming Fire. If it be terrible to have a Finger, Foot, or Hand
to burn off, or to hear that our Bodies must be cast into a Furnace of boiling
Oil, or into a fierce devouring ^^ire; how then can Sinners bear the Thoughts
of falling into the Hands of the dreadful and terrible God, whose incensed
Wrath is ten thousand times worse, and more intolerable, than any Fire that
ever Mortals saw, or that ever any were cast into.

IX. God, when he goes forth in Vengeance, will destroy mightily, and in a
short space, when he rises up to set on fire the Briars and Thorns of the
Earth. Through the Wrath of the Lord of Hosts is the Land darkened, Isa. 9.10.
and the People shall be as the Fuel of the Fire. Now will I (says God) arise,
and devour at once. Destruction is coming upon the Wicked of the Earth;
Destruction upon Destruction in a Moment will come upon them. Let Mystery
Babylon look to it, Re^^. 18.8*
this Fire will kindle very suddenly upon that great City, in a more terrible
and irreparable Manner, than her Agents have done upon our Metropolis; yea, and
her Plagues shall come in a Day, Death, and Mourning, and Famine, and she shall
be utterly burnt with Fire. And let the Sinners in Sion tremble; Isa. 17.
for the Light of Israel shall be for a Fire, and his Holy One for a Flame, and
it shall burn and devour his Thorns and his Briars in one day.



There is vast Difference and Disparity between our common Elementary Fire, and
the Fire of God's Wrath.

Metaphor.
I. FIre is natural and elementary, and so consequently can only seize or
consume things that are visible, of external or temporal Substances; it
destroys that only which is fit Fuel for it, whilst kept under.

II. The Flames of a burning and consuming Fire are always seen, and the Ruins
that it makes are obvious to the outward Eye.

III. A consuming Fire has often been overcome, and put quite out, by Engines,
Instruments, and Industry of Man; when it has burned vehemently, a Stop has
been put to it, and further Danger prevented.

IV. Fire is not unquenchable: Tho the Burning of Mount Aetna, and other
burning Mountains, where there is much Brimstone, and other Sulphurous Matter,
are impossible for Man to extinguish, yet they shall not burn always.

Disparity.
I. THe Fire of God's Wrath is Divine or Spiritual, and so takes hold of, or
kindles upon that which is of an immaterial and invisible Substance; it seizes
upon Spirits, torments Devils, and the Souls of Men and Women; it kindles not
on external Matter only, but on internal also.

II. The Flames of God's Wrath upon the Soul cannot be seen. A Man may have a
Fire burning in his Conscience, like that of Francis Spira, and yet by looking
upon him, you cannot see what Ruin and Desolation it makes there.

III. God is such a consuming Fire, that when his incensed Wrath is kindled in
good earnest, with a design to burn up and destroy, none is able to overcome,
and put a Stop unto it; all the Ways and Means then that Sinners can devise,
will prove insignificant. It Is not Repentance, nor Floods of brinish Tears,
that can put out or lessen the burning of this Divine Fire. It Is true, that
when his Wrath is kindled but a little, and before the Day of Grace is over,
his Anger may be appeased; but when he lets out the Greatness, yea, the Deluge
of the Vials of his Wrath, O then it will be too late.

IV. The Fire of God's Wrath shall never be extinguished. Behold, thus says
the Lord, Jer. 17.20.
Mine Anger and my Fury shall be poured out, etc. and it shall not be quenched.
Fire is kindled in mine Anger, Deuteronomy. 32.22.
and shall burn to the lowest Hell. And it is said, And they shall go forth,
and look upon the Carcases of the Men that have transgressed against me; for
the Worm shall not die, Isa. 66.24.
neither shall the Fire be quenched; and they shall be an Abhorring to all
Flesh. There the Worm dies not, and the Fire shall not be quenched. Mark 9.43.
to 48.




Application.
I. IF God be a consuming Fire, it is good to enquire, To whom he is so, and
will be so terrible.

1. To the fallen Angels, or damned Spirits, who once enjoyed him as a gracious
Head and Creator; but by reason of Sin, not being contented with their first
Estate, were cast out of Heaven, and must for ever undergo the incensed Flames
of God's Wrath.

2. All profane, debauched, and ungodly Men, who are Enemies to God and
Religion, who live like brute Beasts upon the Earth, who mind nothing but to
satisfy their carnal Appetites, who wallow in the Lusts of Uncleanness,
Drunkenness, Pride, Covetousness, etc. without timely Repentance, as God is, so
he will for ever be to such, a consuming Fire, etc.

3. All Persecutors, Tyrants, Murderers, Whoremongers, and all such that
destroy the Saints of God on the Earth; the Beast, false Prophets, and Mystical
Babylon; to all such will God be continually a consuming Fire.

4. All rotten and hypocritical Professors, and Unbelievers, whether in or out
of the Pale of the Church. Yea, let the Sinners in Zion be afraid, Isa. 33.
for Fearfulness will soon surprise the Hypocrite: These without Repentance
must dwell with devouring Fire, and everlasting Burnings. How many times does
our Savior say, that Hypocrites and Unbelievers shall have their Portion in
Fire that cannot be quenched?

5. To all Backsliders, Apostates, and abominable Revolters, Heb. 10.38.
will God be a consuming Fire.

But some may object and say, How can it be so, seeing God says of himself,
Fury is not in me; and that one of his chiefest Attributes is Love; Isa. 27.4.
and that God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son? etc. John
4.8.


Answ. God is set forth as, and said to be, a consuming Fire, in respect to his
Justice. God is just, as well as gracious, a righteous and severe Judge, and he
will deal with Men according to the Penalties of his just Law: So that for
rebelling against him, and not believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, his
well-beloved Son, his Wrath is kindled, and seizes upon such Men.

II. This terrible Doctrine of God's being a consuming Fire, may justly strike
Terror into the Hearts of all ungodly Men: The Day is coming, that he will burn
them up, and leave them neither Root nor Branch.

III. An Use of Consolation to the Saints: This great God, that to the Wicked
is a consuming Fire, to them is a loving Father, and a reconciled God.

The Arm of God.
Deuteronomy. 33.27. And underneath are the Everlasting Arms.

Isa. 33.2. Be thou their Arm every Morning.


SOmetimes by an Anthropopathy, an Arm is attributed to God, by which we are to
denote his Strength and Power, because the Strength of a Man is known by the
Strength of his Arm, whether it be in Labor, Fight, etc. Exodus 15.16. Job
40.4. Psalm. 77.16. and 79.11. and 89.11, 14. Isa. 30.30. and 51.9. etc.
Sometimes a stretched out Arm is ascribed to him; as Psalm. 136.11, 12. Jer.
32.17. But here God is by a Metaphor said to be an Arm; upon which we will
produce the following Parallel.

Metaphor.
I. THe Arm is an essential and noble Part of Man.

II. The Arm is a very useful Limb or Member of the Body; what can the Body do
for it self, or others, that has no Arms?

III. The Arm guards, protects, defends, and saves the Body, from many Blows,
and other imminent Dangers.

IV. The Arm is a very useful and ready thing to take hold of, and to bear such
up that are weak and feeble. We commonly say, to such especially whom we dearly
love, Take hold, and lean upon my Arm.

V. The Body has, and needs two Arms, and cannot by any means spare either of
them.

VI. The Arm is not only ready for Defense, but also to offend those Enemies,
that would destroy and ruin the Body.

VII. With our Arms we embrace our Friends, and those we dearly love. Genesis 29.13
Thus L^^ban embraced Jacob, and Jacob his Sons, before he died. It Is a Sign
our Wrath is pacified to those that have offended us; Genesis 48.10.
thus Esau embraced Jacob at their Meeting. Gen 33.4.


VIII. The Arms of a mighty Man are said to be very strong. Sampson broke the
two Cords wherewith he was bound, Judge. 15.13, 14, 16.
the Cords that were upon his Arms became as Flax; and by the Strength of his
Arm, with the Jaw Bone of an Ass, he slew a thousand Men; Judge. 16.30.
and afterward overthrew the House where the Lords of the Philistines were.

IX. In our Arms we carry our weak and young Children, if they cannot go; we
that way show our Care, and Bowels of Compassion toward them.

X. The Arm or Hand is the Instrument of Action and Administration, it is that
by which all our Works are performed; without Arms we can do nothing. There is
a necessity of Arms, to get our Bread, and afterward to feed our Mouths, etc.

XI. A Man usually stretches out his Arms, when he calls a Child to him that
has been rebellious, whom he is willing to pardon.

Parallel.
I. POwer is an Essential of the Divine Being, or one of the glorious
Attributes of God.

II. The Power of God is very useful and profitable unto the Saints; of the
same use that the Arm is to the Body, is God to Believers.

III. God guards, protects, defends, and saves the Church, Isa. 4.5. Psalm.
20.1. Psalm. 5.11. Isa. 31.5.
which is his mystical Body, from those cursed Assaults and Blows of Satan, and
other Dangers they are exposed to in this World.

IV. God's Power is useful and ready, to bear up and support all sincere, tho
weak and feeble Saints; nay, Psalm. 37.23
there is none can go alone, walk and not stumble, unless God takes hold of
them. Isa. 63.12.
He led them ('it is said) by the right Hand of Moses, with his glorious Arm.

V. We read not only of the Arm, but Arms of God: Deuteronomy. 33.27.
Underneath are the everlasting Arms. There is the Arm of his Mercy, as well as
the Arm of his Power; and the Church can by no means spare either of these Arms
of God.

VI. The Arm of the Most-High is not only for Defense and Protection to the
Church, but also to offend and destroy their implacable Enemies: Deuteronomy. 33.27.
He shall thrust out his Enemies from before thee, and shall say, Destroy them.
Psalm. 3.7.
Thou have smitten all mine Enemies on the Cheek-bone, and have broken the
Teeth of the Ungodly.

VII. God in his Arms of Grace and Mer^^y, embraces all those that submit
themselves unto him in an humble and sincere manner; and by this shows that his
Wrath is appeased. And Christ is said to embrace the Spouse: His left Hand is
under my Head, Cant. 2.6.
and his right Hand does embrace me. As the Heart signifies inward Love; so
the Arm of Christ signifies the Manifestation of that Love, says a Reverend
Author. Ainsworth


VIII. God is mighty in Power. Who has an Arm like the Arm of God? Job 40.9.
Psalm. 90.11 Ephesians. 3.19.
Who knows the Power of his Anger, or who can show the Strength of his Love?
There is nothing too hard for the Arm of God to do; nay, nothing is hard to
him. With his Arms he will deliver his People: My own Arm brought Salvation.
Isa. 63.5.
With the Strength of his Arm he will dash the Wicked in pieces, and overthrow
the Strongholds of Babylon: Ezekiel. 36.36.
I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it.

IX. The Lord manifests his Bowels of Compassion and tender Care over his
poor, young, and weak Children, by carrying them in his Arms: Isa 40.11.
He shall feed his Flock like a Shepherd; he shall gather the Lambs with his
Arms, and carry them in his Bosom.

X. Without God we can do nothing; John 15.5.
he it is that works and labors for the Good of his Church: Lord, Isa. 26.12.
thou have ordained Peace for us; for thou also have wrought all our Works in
us. He provides us Bread, and then feeds us also: Psalm. 81.10
Open thy Mouth wide, and I will fill it.

XI. God is said to stretch forth his Arms, Isa. 65.2.
when he calls upon rebellious Sinners, showing how willing he is, upon their
Repentance, to pardon and forgive them.



Metaphor.
I. THe Arm of a Man is an Arm of Flesh, and consequently may decay, grow weak,
or be withered.

II. The Arm of Man is short, and cannot help at a distance; such as is a Man,
such is his Arm* and Power.

III. The Arm of Man is weak, and may be beaten down by a greater Force; cannot
engage or encounter with the Powers of Hell.

IV. The Arm of a Man may be broke, or cut off, and so become useless.

V. The Arm of Man helps but for a time; he lives not always, and so cannot
help always.

Disparity.
I. THe Arm of God is a spiritual Arm, and so cannot decay; all the Attributes
of God abide, and change not.

II. God's Arm is not short; he can help and save afar off, as well as near;
and Ten Thousands at once, tho they live in so many Nations: Isa. 55.1.
The Lord's Arm is not shortened, that he cannot save.

III. God's Arm is very strong, too strong for the Mighty of the Earth; Psalm.
89.10, 13. Job 40.9.
what is the Arm of Man to the Arm of God? Alas! what can they do? He is able
with his little Finger to crush and break them to pieces; nay he is able to
destroy all the Powers of Hell and Devils in a Moment.

IV. God's Arm cannot be broke, nor cut off.

V. The Arms of God can help at all Times, and in every Condition; hence called
the everlasting Arms. Deuteronomy. 33.27.




Application.
1. IF God has such a strong Arm, let Sinners take heed how they provoke him
against them; it is a dreadful thing (you may perceive from hence) to fall into
the Hands of the Living God. 1 Cor. 10.22.
Do ye provoke the Lord to Anger? Are ye stronger than he?

2. If God has such an Arm, Woe to the Enemies of the Church; this may make
Babylon tremble: Rev. 18.8.
Her Plagues shall come upon her in one Day, Death, and Mourning, and Famine,
and she shall be utterly burnt with Fire; for strong is the Lord that judges
her.

3. If the Church of God has such Arms as you have heard, doubtless her
Enemies shall never prevail against her; it shows forth the Security and Safety
of God's People; God is able to save and deliver his Church when he pleases.

4. Why should Saints be afraid of Man, and tremble at the Arm of Flesh, who
have an Arm of God to help them? Have Men an Arm like him? Job 40.9.
Alas! their Power is weak and vain. There is no King saved by the Multitude of
an Host; a mighty Man is not delivered by much Strength. As it is a great Sin to
trust in an Arm of Flesh, Cursed is the Man that trusts in Man: So it is a
great Evil and Folly to fear what they can do. What hurt can the Arm of Man do
us? They can but kill the Body, that is the most; and so far they are not able
to go neither, unless God gives them Commission.

5. How soon can God, if he has such an Arm, break the Arm of the Mighty? God
can deal with the strongest Arm of Flesh. Son of Man, says the Lord, Ezekiel.
30.21.
I have broken the Arm of Pharaoh King of Egypt, and lo, it shall not be bound
up to be healed, to put a Roller to bind it, to make strong to hold a Sword.
When God breaks the Arm of an haughty King, it is beyond the Skill of his
Surgeons to set the Bones, and make it whole again. Jer. 48.25.
The Horn of Moab is cut off, and his Arm is broke. A savage Beast (says one)
cannot hurt us, when his Horn is broke; no more can a cruel Tyrant, when his
Arm of Power is burst asunder.

6. If this be so, let us engage the Arm of God for us: If we can but get the
Almighty to be on our side, we will not fear what Hell or Rome can do unto us.
Let us humble our selves before him, and depart from Iniquity; let us trust in
God alone, and offend him (as we have done) no more.

7. If God have such a mighty Arm, then let us all labor to trust in him. We
cannot (says a godly Minister) trust Creatures too little (as to Success) nor
can we trust God too much; let us trust in God alone, and in no other Strength
but his.

8. This may stir us up to the Duty of Prayer, to cry mightily in our
Distresses to God for Help; let us pray in this time of Need, as the Church
does: Awake, awake, put on Strength, O Arm of the Lord, awake as in the
Generations of old: Art thou not he that has cut Rahab, and wounded the
Dragon? Lord, show forth thy Might; here is another Dragon, a Romish and bloody
Dragon, risen up against thy poor Church, and it is in the Power of thy Arm
only to deal with him.

9. Seeing God has such an Arm, let weak Christians pray, that he would lead
them, yea, carry them in his Bosom; and let us all daily be in the
Consideration and Meditation of the Strength and Power of his Arm. We little
consider and fear what God can do.

God compared to a Travailing Woman.
Isa. 42.14. Now will I cry like a travailing Woman, etc.


THis is a kind of Metaphor called an Anthropopathy, as all Places are that
attribute any thing humane to God. In this Text we are to note, that his
Lenity, Patience, and long Forbearance, are changed into a severe Vengeance:
Because a travailing Woman, tho in great Pain, yet patiently endures it, to the
utmost Extremity of her Throws; and then, being overcome by the Violence of her
Pangs, breaks out into Cries and Vociferation: Which most elegantly expresses
the Patience and long Forbearance of God, and the Extremity of his Wrath, when
provoked, Psalm. 78.65, 66. Romans 2.45.

Simile.
I. A Travailing Woman is in Pain, great Pain: When Pangs come upon thee like
the Pain of a Woman in Travail.

II. A Woman in Travail cries out; her Pains are so great she cannot refrain;
her Pangs make her cry bitterly.

III. A Woman in Travail strives to bring forth.

IV. It Is not long, when great Pain and Pangs come upon a travailing Woman,
e're she is delivered.

Parallel.
I. GOD is pleased to speak after this manner, as if he was in pain: I will
ease me, says he, of mine Adversaries, I will avenge me of mine Enemies. Isa.
1.24.
The Adversaries of God seem to hurt, and put him to pain. In all their
Afflictions he was afflicted: When the Foot is afflicted, the Head is
afflicted. God is pleased to condescend so low, Isa. 63.9.
as to sympathize with his Church; when she is pained, he is pained.

II. God will visibly demonstrate (to speak after the manner of Men) how his
Soul is pained and distressed for his Church and People; hence says he, I will
cry like a travailing Woman. Isa. 42.14.


III. God when he stirs up himself, and begins to cry and roar, it is that he
may bring forth Deliverance for his Church.

IV. When God begins to roar in his thundering Judgments, pouring forth the
Vials of his Wrath upon the Beast, and to cry like a travailing Woman,
Deliverance will soon follow the Church.



Use.
IT shows the great Affection and Love of God to his People, the Truth and
Certainty of their Deliverance, and the utter Confusion and Downfall of their
Enemies.

God a Shield.
Psalm. 84.11. The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield.

Psalm. 18.2. The Lord is my Shield.


THis Term Shield is Metaphorically attributed to Princes and great Men, Psalm.
17.10. Hos. 4.18. because they protect and defend their Subjects or Dependents
from Injustice and Violence, as a Shield does the Body from Blows. For this
reason God is called a Shield, because he protects and secures his People from
the Attempts of Spiritual Adversaries, as well as Temporal.

Metaphor.
I. A Shield or Buckler is for Defense and Safeguard of the Body in time of
Battle.

II. A Shield or Buckler is not only to defend and preserve one Part of the
Body, but every Part; and not the Body only, but the whole Armor also that a
Man has. Hence it was made very large, and for its largeness called (...),
from (...), a Gate or Door, denoting that which is large and broad enough to
hide or cover the whole Body, and shelter it from Harm.

III. A Shield is used to keep that part of the Body that is struck at by the
Enemy; it is a moveable Piece of Armor, that a skilful Hand can turn this way
or that way, to take the Blow or Arrow, according as he sees it is directed
against him.

Parallel.
I. GOD is the Defense and Safeguard of his Saints in all their Spiritual War
and Conflicts, with the Enemies of their Souls.

II. God defends every part of the Soul, he preserves our Judgments from
Corruption, our Wills from growing stubborn and rebellious, our Affections from
being misled and ensnared with worldly Objects, our Consciences from
Defilement, and so the whole Soul from the Venom and Poison of Sin and Satan;
and not only so, but he preserves and keeps our Graces from Decays and
Witherings. Thou, Lord, Psalm. 5.12.
wilt bless the Righteous with Favor, thou will compass him about as with a
Shield.

III. God keeps off the Blows and fiery Darts of the Devil, from wounding that
Part or Grace of the Soul which is in the greatest Danger. Sometimes Satan
strikes at the Faith of a Christian, God presently appears by his Word and
Spirit, for the strengthening of that. Sometimes the Grace of Love is struck at,
God then presents immediately Divine Objects before the Soul, and shows it more
and more the Baseness, Deformity, and Emptiness of this World, and thereby
increases and preserves the Love of the Soul to Himself, and to Jesus Christ.
Again, the Will is aimed at, some Temptations are laid to catch that: Some
Commands of God cannot be obeyed without much Self-denial, because they cross
us in that which our own Wills are naturally carried out very strongly to
desire; so that we must deny our Wills before we can do the Will of God. A
Temptation comes very forcibly, when it runs with the Tide of our own Wills,
when it is to save our Estates, Children, or Lives, from the Danger of Enemies.
What? says the Devil, will thou serve God, when he thwarts thee in every thing
that thou take delight in? If thou love any one thing more than another,
presently he must have it from thee: No Lamb in all the Flock will serve for a
Sacrifice, but Isaac, Abraham's only Child, must be offered up: Genesis 22.2.
No Place will content God, that Abraham should serve him in, but where he must
live in Banishment from his Father's House, and all his dear Relations: Will thou, says Satan, stoop to these low and contemptible Ordinances, be a
Companion to these base, despised, and persecuted People? What? follow God, and
yield to such hard Terms as these be? Now God directs himself strait-way by his
Word and Spirit, to preserve the Soul from this terrible Arrow, showing what
reason there is that his Will should be done rather than ours, Mat. 19.29.
and that we shall lose nothing by suffering for his sake; and so makes the
Soul willing to yield to all his Pleasure, as Abraham did. And this indeed of
God's being a Shield unto him, was the Motive that induced him not to fear:
After these things the Word of God came unto Abraham in a Vision, saying, Genesis
15.1.
Fear not, Abraham, I am thy Shield; as much as if he should say, I will defend
and save thee from all the Darts and Arrows of thine Enemies. By this Shield,
every Faculty of the Soul, and Grace of the Spirit is preserved.



Metaphor.
I. A Shield is a Defense or Safeguard for the Body.

II. A Shield or Buckler cannot defend every Part of the Body at once.

III. A Shield may be beaten out of a Man's hand, and be rendered wholly
unserviceable to a Man.

IV. A Shield can (however) preserve from Temporal Enemies only.

Disparity.
I. GOD is a Defense and Shield for Soul and Body both.

II. God is a Buckler that saves and defends every Part and Faculty of the
Soul, at one and the same time; he is an universal Cover.

III. God is a Shield, that can never be rendered useless or unserviceable to a
Christian that keeps close to God.

IV. God is a Shield or Defense, that preserves from the Power, and cruel
Assaults and Temptations of the Devil.



Inferences.
1. IF God be the Saints Shield, let them take heed that they never engage
their Enemies without God.

2. This may greatly encourage the Godly in their Spiritual Warfare, they have
a sure Shield and Buckler, that will never fail them.

3. Moreover it may direct them to the right use of their Shield; it is a great
part of Wisdom to know how to defend our selves by our Shield, from Satan's
Assaults, and the Temptations of this evil World.

God a Wall of Fire.
Zech. 2.5. Thus says the Lord, I will be unto her a Wall of Fire round about.


I Will be unto her (that is, unto Jerusalem, or the Church of God) a Wall of
Fire. This Metaphor is taken from those Fires that People make round
themselves, when they are cast into a howling Wilderness, to secure themselves
from fierce and devouring Beasts; and they being within the said Circle or Wall
of Fire, no wild Beast dares approach them, etc.

The Speech is a Metaphor; and the Epithete of Fire is added, to denote that
God is the Defender of his Church, and a terrible Avenger, that will consume
its Enemies, as Fire does any combustible Materials, etc.

Metaphor.
I. A Wall of Fire is made for Defense and Security from Adversaries, that are
cruel, brutish, and merciless, as Lions, Bears, Dragons, etc.

II. A Wall of Fire is a Defense and Security to People that live in a
Wilderness, where they are in danger of wild Beasts, it abounding with such
devouring and ravenous Creatures.

III. A Wall of Fire is for Defense and Security, when there is no other
Security to be had.

IV. A Wall of Fire is both for Offense and Defense; it defends them that are
within, and offends them that are without.

V. A Wall of Fire is most amazing, dreadful, and terrible to an Enemy.

VI. A Wall of Fire is dangerous to attack, or approach unto; no devouring and
cruel Beasts dare come near it, the Lions tremble at the Sight thereof.

VII. Those that are environed round about with a Wall of Fire, are very safe
in the midst of the greatest Multitudes of evil Beasts.

VIII. Nothing will keep off (as Naturalists observe) cruel and devouring
Beasts, but a Wall of Fire.

IX. Those that are environed round by a Wall of Fire, are not only safe from
Enemies, but are also thereby kept warm from piercing Cold.

X. Those that see they are compassed about with a Wall of Fire, are made very
fearless and courageous thereby.

Parallel.
I. GOD is the Defense and Security of his People from the Devil, that roaring
Lion, and old red Dragon; and from wicked Men, who for their cruel, brutish,
devouring, and merciless Dispositions, are compared to Lions, Bears, etc.

II. God is a Wall of Fire, or such a Defense and Security to his People,
whilst they remain in the howling Wilderness of this World, where their Danger
is very great, there being Multitudes of brutish and devouring Men, or rather
Beasts, nay, Monsters, Devils in the shape of Men, ready to destroy them.

III. God is a Wall of Fire and Defense unto his People, there being no other
Security for them: I looked, Isa. 63.3.
and there was none to help; therefore my own Arm brought Salvation, and my
Fury it upheld me.

IV. God is a Defense to his Church, and it is He who offends and discomfits
their Enemies: I will undo them that afflict thee, etc.

V. God, in being a Defense, or Wall of Fire to his People, greatly amazeth and
terrifieth the ungodly and brutish Persecutors; how terrible was God to
Pharaoh, when he was a Wall of Fire to Israel!

VI. It is a very dangerous thing for any to make Attempts upon God. Who is
able to stand before such a Wall of flaming and devouring Fire? Wicked Men are
compared to Briars and Thorns; and who would set them, says God, Isa. 27.4.
against me in Battle? The Devils themselves tremble before his Sacred Majesty.

VII. Those that are surrounded about on every side, by the Power, Wisdom, and
merciful Providence of the Almighty God, this great Wall of Fire, need not
fear Devils, nor brutish Men, tho never so cruel and bloody.

VIII. Nothing can keep off cruel and merciless Men, from making a Spoil of
God's Church, but God himself: Conscience cannot, the Cry of the Widow and
fatherless Children, no, nor the Fear of Hell. Therefore God walls his People
round about in a wonderful manner, that Men cannot find, nor come at them.

IX. Those that have God for a Wall of Fire, are secured from all the cold
Blasts of Sin and Temptation, are sweetly refreshed and comforted; for such is
the property of this Wall of Fire also unto them.

X. Those that see they have God as a Wall of Fire round about them, are
thereby made very valiant and courageous, saying, I will not fear what Man can
do unto me, etc.



Metaphor.
I. A Wall of Fire is made of outward Materials, viz. Wood, or such like Fuel.

II. A Wall of Fire properly is to secure the Body from ravenous, wild, and
devouring Beasts.

III. A Wall of Fire may be quenched, or for want of Fuel go out; and so those
that were secured by it, may be exposed and laid open to the Rage of cruel and
merciless Beasts.

Disparity.
I. GOD, who is said to be a Wall of Fire for defense of his People, is the
Maker of all things: By him all things were made, etc.

II. God is a Wall or Defense, to keep safe and secure both Body and Soul, not
only from wild Beasts, but also from cursed Men and Devils.

III. This Wall of Fire can never be quenched, nor go out; whilst there be any
wild Beasts, and devouring and bloody Persecutors in the World. This Fire will
burn, and be a Wall to the Godly, let the Devil and Rome do what they can; the
Church of Christ shall never be left to the Rage of Papal Fury.



Inferences.
1. FRom hence we may note an Use of Terror to wicked Men: Their cruel Attempts
upon the Church of God will prove their Ruin; they will get nothing thereby,
but a feared and wounded Conscience; this Fire will devour them.

2. We may see how God is pleased to represent wicked Men; does he not intimate
to us by this Metaphor, that they are no better than ravenous Beasts?

3. What great Folly does this demonstrate to be in the Hearts of the
Adversaries! Will they, who are but Briars and Thorns, set themselves against
the Great God, who is a consuming Fire?

4. It also shows the infinite Love and Care of God to his Saints.

5. In what Safety do the Godly dwell! Let the Beasts roar, and tear and goar
one another, whilst God's People are thus defended and preserved from their
Rage and Cruelty.

Object.
But some may object and say, How is God said to be a Wall of Fire to the
Church? etc.

Answ.
It may have respect to his Divine Attributes, as Wisdom, Power, Goodness,
Truth, Faithfulness, Justice; by which he preserves his Church and People,
through his glorious Providence, in this World, as thereby he defeats their
Enemies.

God a Judge.
Genesis 18.10, 25. Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right?

Psalm. 58.11. Verily he is a God that judges in the Earth.

Psalm. 82.1. God stands in the Congregation of the Righteous, he judges
among the Gods.


GOD is really and properly a Judge, for he is the Judge of all the World, and
therefore he is not brought here under the Notion of a Metaphorical Judge: But
in regard this Term seems to be allusive to Earthly Judges, we think it may not
be unprofitable to draw a Parallel, for the Edification of the Reader.

As there is nothing more frequently attributed to Almighty God in the Holy
Scriptures, than the Title of Judge; so there is scarce any Attribute or Action
of the Most High grounded upon more Reason: Of which take this following
Account.

1. There is in the World, viz. on the whole Earth, a great and mighty People,
for Number like to the Stars of Heaven, or Sands by the Seashore.

2. There this numerous People are almost as various in their Humors, as they
are in their Numbers, Ages, Sizes, and Complections: It Is very rare, if not
impossible, to find two that in all Points do exactly accord.

3. That this numberless Multitude are all addicted to run bias to a
particular thing called Self-love; and this too from an indissoluble Principle
or Impression of Nature: It Is natural for all Men to love themselves.

4. That after they are grown up to some degree of Ripeness and Maturity, they
have ready prepared to their Eyes the bad Examples of ill-living Souls, which
too often have too great an Influence upon green and tender Plants, to wind
them into extreme and irregular Designs and Motions.

5. There is, by Divine permission, a most troublesome and pernicious Adversary,
suffered to range up and down the whole Earth, to try his Art and Skill, how
far he can prevail to bring this vast Body into Tumult and Disorder; and it is
not seldom that he does prevail, to divide not only Emperors, Kings, Princes,
Judges, Nobles, and Peasants; but Dukedoms, Principalities, Cities,
Corporations, Villages, Families, Brothers, Sisters, Husbands, Wives, Fathers,
and their own Children.

Now these things being premised, what unspeakable need is there of one supreme
and universal Judge, to curb Exorbitancies, to umpire, decide, and put a period
to Dissentions! Without whose Moderation, the World would be intolerably
perplexed, harrassed and plagued with perpetual and endless Wars, Broils,
Disorders and Confusions; and would hardly keep its station for any long Period
of Time. For the moderating and preventing of all which, the God of the whole
Earth has undertaken to associate with the Rulers, and to judge amongst the
Gods: In which Passage he is represented to us by the Similitude of a Judge,
which carries a lively Figure and Resemblance of the Supreme Lord of the whole
Earth, and that in these diverse respects following.

Earthly Judge.
I. IT appertains to a Judge to be good, and the best of Judges are so. Moses
was advised to choose thus by his Father Jethro. The Desire and Fruit of the
Righteous is good. Prove: 11.23, 30.


II. It appertains to a Judge to be wise and prudent, or, as Jethro words it,
Exodus 18.21.
to be able. A foolish Ruler is a Shame and Reproach to any Nation or People;
and there is not a more uncomely Sight in the World, than to see a Fool upon
the Throne of a Kingdom, or Judgment Seat.

III. It appertains to a Judge to be a Man of Knowledge, and well-skilled in the
Laws and Statutes of a Kingdom, because he is to be the Expounder of the Law to
the People.

IV. It appertains to a Judge to be a Man of Prudence, not only for the settling
of right Methods, but to do Justice in a fit season.

V. It appertains to a Judge, to have good and right Laws to judge the People by,
that there may be no cause of Grievances or Complaints.

VI. It appertains to a Judge to be impartial, and judge uprightly; not to know
the Faces of any in Judgment, not to be corrupted by flattering Words, nor
biased by Bribes, nor misled by the Place and Dignity of Persons, of what rank
or quality soever they be.

VII. It appertains to a Judge, to be just and equal in the proportions of
Punishment and Severity, not lay any beyond due Desert, nor favor, when there
is no reason for it. The Reward of Murder, Treason, Rebellion, Witchcraft,
Blasphemy, is not to be given to petty Offenders.

VIII. It appertains to a Judge, to take nothing upon Trust, but to be satisfied
that Matters are true. A Judge is not to act doubtfully, but see the Offender be
clearly cast before he give Sentence.

IX. It appertains to a Judge, upon due Proof and Trial, to pass a definitive
Sentence: If one Man sin against another, the Judge shall judge him.

X. It appertains to a Judge to be firm and steady to the Rules of Law and
Justice, as immovable as a Rock, a right way.

XI. It appertains to a Judge to consider the Cause of the Poor and Needy, to
plead for the Widow and Fatherless, and them that have no Help, and deliver
them out of their Distress, where Justice calls for it.

XII. It appertains to a Judge, to have a People under him to be judged.

XIII. It appertains to a Judge to be provided of Officers to execute his
Sentence, else Judge and Law are of little signification; for according to the
old Maxim, Execution is the Life of the Law.

XIV. It appertains to a Judge, to be feared, and had in reverence.

XV. It appertains to a Judge, to be clothed or arrayed with Majesty and Terror.

XVI. A Judge has power to reprieve or suspend the Execution of a Sentence.

XVII. It appertains to a Judge to give Orders for Execution, to deliver to the
Officers when Sentence is past.

XVIII. It appertains to a Judge to punish Officers, if they exceed their due
Bounds in punishing others.

XIX. It appertains to a Judge, to vindicate his own Honor, and the Justice of
the Law he executes.

XX. It appertains to a Judge to mix Mercy with Judgment, where the Case will
fairly admit of it.

XXI. A Judge in this World has others to plead before him, as Counsel or
Advocates for the Prisoner, to extenuate the Crime, and plead the Privileges
allowed by Law.

XXII. It appertains to a Judge in this World, to have not only Rules of Law,
but a Register of bypast Actions, that he may know what to do, if like Cases
fall in future Times.

XXIII. A Judge usually has great Attendance to bear him Company in the Time of
Judgment.

XXIV. A Judge, when he peremptorily passes Sentence, does not recede and go
back; the Sentence past abides.

Heavenly Judge.
I. THis God is by way of Eminency, he is essentially good, good without any
mixture of Evil. He is originally good; there is no Good in the whole Universe,
but what he is the Root, Spring, and Fountain of. There is no Evil to befound
in him; and as Seneca, he can do no evil nor hurtful thing. He is Good in the
Abstract, Goodness it self. 1 Chronicles. 16.24. Psalm. 25.8. Psalm. 119.68.

II. This God is, beyond comprehension or expression; for all the Angels
receive their Wisdom from him, all the Emperors, Kings, Princes, Nobles, and
Judges of the Earth: In him are all the Treasures of Wisdom, and therefore
called, Wisdom past finding out.

III. God, the Judge of all the Earth, is a God of Knowledge: Known unto the Lord
are all his Works from the Beginning. He gives Knowledge to the Simple, and
makes the Foolish of an understanding Heart; he makes known unto Men the great
things of his Law; his Spirit searches into all Mysteries; he gives Skill in
all Arts and Sciences, and there is no searching of his Understanding: When he
undertakes to dispute, none can answer him one of a Thousand.

IV. In this the Lord, the great Judge, is beyond comparison; for he dwells with
Prudence, and finds out Knowledge of witty Inventions; his Ways are perfect
altogether. His Actions are so fitly timed, that he does nothing out of season:
It Is in due season he delivers the Needy, avengeth the Cause of his Elect, and
plentifully rewards the proud Doers.

V. The chief Judge of all the Earth has an ancient Statute-Book, that is
suited to all Times and Seasons, to all Ages, Sexes, Conditions, and
Constitutions of Men whatever: Every part of it is tried and proved, and found
to be a perfect Law, in which are contained wondrous Things, Psalm. 19.7. Psalm.
119.1 Psalm. 119.142.
ever free from Deceit and Falsehood. It Is mavelous pleasant and refreshing,
sweeter than Honey, or the Honeycomb; the Delight of good Men; a sure Guide to
them in all their Ways; and none of its Commands are grievous, but all Duties
required by it are reasonable.

VI. In this there is none so holy and upright as the Lord, who is no Respecter
of Persons, hates flattering Words, and giving of Bribes; will spare none for
the Dignity of their Birth, or Antiquity of their Lineage; but will do Justice
according to Right and Law, whether it be upon Angels, Emperors, Kings,
Princes, Priests, Prophets; his Church, that are his professed Friends, as well
as upon the World, his professed Enemies. He will destroy his own anointed
Ones, if they stand in opposition to Justice and Equity. Cities, Kingdoms,
Towers, Temples, all shall fall, rather than Law and Justice be justled out of
place. He spared not Angels, overthrew Kings, mighty Kings, with Kingdoms and
Nations, Pharaoh King of Egypt, Og King of Bashan, Nebuchadnezzar King of
Babylon, Darius King of Persia, and Alexander King of Greece; Herod King of
Judea; Jerusalem and Samaria, with both their Kings. When once they come to be
laid in the Balance, and the Lord enter into Judgment with them; when he ties
Judgment to the Line, and Righteousness to the Plummet: Noah, Daniel, and Job
shall not save, when Truth, Law, and Justice calls for a cutting off. He will
by no means spare the Guilty, when the Time of Forbearance is expired.

VII. Of this no Man shall have wherewith to accuse God, for he will not do
more than is right, that Man should enter into Judgment with his Maker; nay, he
will rather make abatement, than overdo. And this has been owned in his Act of
Judgment: Thou have not dealt with us according to our Iniquities.

VII. In this case the Lord our Judge has sufficiently approved himself; first,
in respect of the Old World; secondly, in respect of Sodom and Gomorrah, where
he would take nothing upon Trust, but come down himself, to see if things were
so bad as they were represented to him. And for Israel and Judah, their Sins
did testify to their Face, before he did execute Judgment upon them. Hosea 5.5


IX. To this in respect of God it is said, In the Day thou eatest thereof, Genesis
2.17.
thou shall surely die. Genesis 6.7.
I will destroy Man from the Face of the Earth; and 'twas done. Pharaoh and his
Host, that thou have seen this day, thou shall see no more for ever. Because
thou did not restrain thy Sons, I have rejected thee from being a Priest.
Because thou have caused my Name to be blasphemed, the Sword shall not depart
from thy House. Because Nebuchadnezzar was lifted up with Pride, he shall be
driven from his Throne. Dan. 4.25. and 5.22, 23.
Because his Son did not humble, but harden his Mind, his Kingdom was numbered,
finished, and translated to the Medes and Persians.

X. As for God, his Way is not only perfect, and his Word tried; but he is of
one Mind, and there is none can turn him, in a Case of Right, Truth, and
Justice. His Council shall stand; for he is not as the Son of Man, that he
should repent. With him is no variableness, Isa. 46.10. Mat. 3.6. Heb. 13.8.
Jam. 1.17.
nor shadow of turning. He is the same yesterday, to day, and for ever. He
changes not, will not alter the thing that is gone out of his Mouth.

XI. In this Jehovah is not behind-hand, for he is a God with whom the
Fatherless find Mercy, Hos. 14.3.
pities the Poor when he sees they have no Helper, breaks the Teeth of the old
and young Lion, smites the Enemy upon the Cheek-Bone, Psalm. 4.7.
avengeth their Cause when they cry to him, and has destroyed them, and their
Posterity, who made long Prayers to devour Widows Houses.

XII. The Almighty has a great and mighty People under him, even all the
Inhabitants of the World, Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. He is God of all
the Kingdoms of the World, Psalm. 24.1. Psalm. 98.9.
and Judge of the whole Earth.

XIII. In this our high and mighty Judge does overmatch all other Judges; for he
is provided with Legions of Angels, all ready to observe his Dictates, and obey
his Commands. The Devils are all subject to him; so that if he say, Go, they
go; Do this, and they do it. Millions of Men are under his Influence; and as
many Fowls of the Air, Beasts of the Field, and creeping Things of the Earth,
to do his Will, to execute his Judgments; when he speaks the word, or lifts up
his hand to them. They shall invade the Courts of Kings, enter the Chambers of
Princes, fetch Emperors off their Thrones, bring them to Chains, Blocks, and
Gibbets, when he passes Sentence, and gives Orders to do it.

XIV. God is to be feared, not only as a Creator, who can annihilate and
dissolve, make Men cease to be; as a Father, who can love and rebuke; as a
Lord, who can command, and give Orders: but as a Judge, who can punish in this
World, 1 Timothy 5.24.
and bring Men's Sins beforehand to Judgment.

XV. With God is terrible Majesty, Job 37.22.
and he rides upon the high Places of the Earth.

XVI. God does often reprieve and put off the Execution of Sentence, so that
Delinquents are not speedily executed, but a Time given them to consider their
ways. Genesis 6.3.
The old World had one hundred and twenty years given them, before Judgment was
executed. Judea, Jerusalem, and Samaria, continued a long time, before the Fury
of the Almighty broke out upon them.

XVII. God sometimes gives Orders to Angels to punish, and execute his
Sentence, when Men are out of the reach of human Hands; as in the case of
Nebuchadnezzar, the Host of the Assyrians, and Herod the King. Tho great Men
join hand in hand for Wickedness, Act. 12.23
yet shall they not go unpunished.

XVIII. God will punish those that himself employs, in case they exceed their
Commission in any case that concerns his Act of Justice. He punished Assyria
and Babylon, Isa. 47.6.
for going beyond their Bounds in his own Works of Judgment against the Jews.

XIX. God, the great Judge, does vindicate his own Honor, and the Justice of
the Laws he executes, by giving Liberty to the People to testify against him,
Jer. 2.5. Ezekiel 18.25.
if they have wherewith to accuse; and demands of them what Evil their Fathers
have seen in him; requires them to testify to his Face, if his Ways are in any
point unequal.

XX. God, when he comes forth in a way of Judgment, does not execute the
fierceness of his Wrath; he is far from rendering to Men more than they deserve;
he does not reward according to their full demerit, Hab. 3.2.
but in the midst of Judgment remembers Mercy.

XXI. God has assigned an Advocate to plead, before he proceeds to Judgment.
If any Man sin, 1 John 2.2.
we have an Advocate with the Father.

XXII. God has not only made Laws, and published them, and will judge Men for
wilful and reiterated Rebellions; but keeps a Register for the great Day, to be
then opened; as it is written, Some Men's Sins go beforehand to Judgment, and
they that are otherwise cannot be hid. The Judgment shall sit, and the Books
shall be opened, and the Dead shall be judged out of those things which are
written in the Books.

XXIII. God never judges alone: The Son is with him, the holy Spirit is with
him; the Angels, and whole Court of Heaven do acquiesce in the Judgments that
he executes.

XXIV. God, when he peremptorily pronounces Judgment, without reserve, it
stands, and must abide. If he say, Pharaoh and his Host shall be seen no more
for ever; Babylon, the Glory of the Chaldean Kingdom, shall be overthrown;
Israel shall be removed; the Land shall be forsaken of both her Kings: If he
publish the Decree, there is no changing his Determinations; his Judgment is
like the Laws of the Medes and Persians. Abraham cannot save Sodom; nor Noah,
Daniel or Job, Judah and Israel; but when a Decree of Judgment is gone forth,
they must die by the Sword, For the Mouth of the Lord has spoken it.



God an Hiding Place.
Psalm. 32.7. Thou art my Hiding Place, thou shall preserve me from Trouble.

Psalm. 119.114. Thou art my Hiding Place, etc.


SEcret Place, as Mr. Ainsworth renders it; a Phrase alluding to some Den,
Cave, or secret Chamber, where Men have found, and may find Safety in Times of
Danger; according to what is said, Isa. 26.20. Come, my People, enter thou into
thy Chambers, and shut thy Doors about thee; hide thy self as it were for a
little moment. The Saints of old hid themselves in Dens, in Caves, Mountains,
and Wildernesses, from the Rage of Men, Heb. 11.38. were sometimes sheltered by
the Providence of God, when there was a general Combination against them;
therefore called God's hidden Ones, Psalm. 83.3. because covered by him, when
Edom, the Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarens, Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, the
Philistines, with the Inhabitants of Tire, took crafty Counsel, and consulted
Mischief against them.

And in as much as Hiding Place is a borrowed Speech from a Rock, Mountain,
Cave, or Den, secret Chamber, or Place of Shelter; we may consider the
Convenience of the Metaphor, and bring in a Parallel from God.

Metaphor.
I. AN Hiding Place is usually a strong Place; Men will not adventure
themselves in it, or think themselves safe, without some considerable Strength.

II. An Hiding Place is an invisible and obscure Place, not known to every
Body, a Place that Enemies have much ado to find.

III. An Hiding Place is a Covering or Shelter from many Evils; from the
scorching Heat of the Sun, the blustering Storms of Wind and Hail.

IV. An Hiding Place frees from Fear, and much abates the Hurries and
Discomposures of the Mind, because Men do imagine themselves safe, when they
have taken Sanctuary in some secret Rock or Cave.

V. An Hiding Place does disappoint the Enemies, who please themselves in the
thoughts of preying upon the Righteous; as Pharaoh said of Israel, My Lust
shall be satisfied! The Enemies of David cry, Let us persecute his Soul, and
take it. Aha! thus would we have it.

Parallel.
I. GOD, the good Man's Hiding Place, is a strong God, as a Rock in time of
Need, nay, as the Shelter of a great Rock, as the Security of many Rocks: Isa.
33.6.
His Place of Defense shall be the Munition of Rocks. He is as a Place built on
purpose for Safety. The Name of the Lord is a strong Tower, Prove. 18.10. Psalm.
24.8. Psalm. 61.3.
the Righteous run into it, and are safe. He is hence said to be the Almighty,
the Lord strong and mighty; a strong Rock, Psalm. 31.2. Strong Habitation, Psalm.
71.3. Strong Refuge, v. 7. Strong Lord, Psalm. 89.8. Mighty in Power, Isa. 40.26.

II. God is an invisible Being in respect of his Essence: Joh. 1.18. chap.
5.37. chap. 6.46. Col. 1.15. 1 Timothy 1.17. Heb. 11.27. Exodus 15.9. Psalm. 3.2.
Esther 3.9. Psalm. 37.12 Jer. 3.23.
No Man has seen God at any time. No Man has beheld his Form, or seen his
Shape. He is the invisible God, etc. He is invisible also as he is his Peoples
Hiding Place: Pharaoh saw not the Covering Israel had, when he said, I will
pursue, I will overtake, my Hand shall destroy. The Enemies of David saw not
the Cave, the Rock, his Hiding Place, when they said, There is no help for him
in his God. Haman was unacquainted with this Covering, when he designed
Destruction to all Israel. The Wicked plot against the Just, because they know
not where their Safety is. In the Lord our God is the Salvation of Israel.

III. God is no less a Covering to his People, than the best of Hiding-Places
have been, or are unto any People. He secures from the Hurt of Persecution,
when Men rage, and rise up against them. He secures from Satan's Temptations,
as well when he appears like a Serpent, as when he acts like a Lion, or great
red Dragon. So that not only David, and the Old Testament Church, could say,
Had not the Lord been on our side, when Men rose up against us, Psalm. 124.1, 2,
3, 4. Psalm. 68.20
we had been swallowed up quick. He breaks the Head of Leviathan, and gives it
for Meat to the People inhabiting the Wilderness. But even the Church now may
say, He that is our God is a sure Hiding Place, a God of Salvation.

IV. This Advantage is most eminently enjoyed by the Godly, who have made God
their Sanctuary and Hiding Place; they are freed from the Fear that wicked Men
are surprised with; their Hurries and Discomposures are much abated. As it is
said of Moses, Heb. 11.27. Psalm. 116.3 Psalm. 91 5. Psalm. 112.7, 8. Psalm. 3 6.
He feared not the Wrath of the King. And David says, At what time I am
afraid, I will put my Trust in thee: I will discharge my self of Fears and
Discomposures, and account my self safe in God, my Sanctuary and Hiding Place.
I will not fear what Man can do unto me, tho Ten Thousand compass me about. In
the Name of the Lord there is strong Confidence -- not Fear, when evil Tidings
come, Psalm. 112.7.

V. God has throughout all Ages, as the Hiding Place of his People,
disappointed their Enemies, and secured than from being a Prey to their Teeth.
He saved Israel, when Pharaoh pursued them. Exodus 14.30.
He saved David, when Saul hunted him, like a Partridg upon the Mountains. He
destroyed the Host of the Philistines and Assyrians, when their Expectations
were very high. He frustrateth the Tokens of Liars, and makes Diviners mad, by
catching the Wise in their own Craftiness. In the things wherein they deal
proudly, he is above them.



For Disparities see Rock, and Strong-Tower,

Inferences.
I. IF God be an Hiding Place, then let all Godly Men fly to him in Times of
Trouble and Danger, by Faith and Prayer. Thus David, Psalm. 143.9
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine Enemies, I fly unto thee to hide me. There is
Reason for it, for good Men cannot be secure without him: 1. Because weak
themselves. 2. Are pursued and hunted after by potent and subtle Enemies.


II. Let them that have taken God for their Hiding Place, abide in him; for in
him there is Safety, and no where else. It Is vain to trust in Men, or put
confidence in Princes; to look for Safety from the Hills, or Multitude of
Mountains: For in the Lord alone is the Salvation of Israel.

THE Second HEAD OF Metaphors, Allegories, Similes, Types, and other borrowed
Terms, RESPECTING The Lord Jesus Christ, The Second Person in the Glorious
Trinity.
Christ a Mediator.
1 Timothy 2.5. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the
Man Christ Jesus.

Heb. 12.14. To Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant.


THe Greek word, (...), is thought by Erasmus to be peculiar to the Scripture,
as being not elsewhere used; and doubts whether it should be rendered Mediator,
Reconciler, or Intercessor. The Term, as applied to Christ, is borrowed from
Persons, whose Office it is to reconcile such Parties as are at variance, being
as it were in the middle betwixt both, soliciting the Cause of each to the
other, till they bring them to Concord or Agreement. It Is thus defined by
Illyricus: Mediator is dicitur, qui inter duos parum inter se congruentes, aut
etiam sibi invicem Hosts, medius est, and utriusque nomine cum altero agit,
promovens conciliationem, etc. -- Quique tamdiu apud utramque partem alterius
nomine laborat, donec eas in consensum and pactionem deducat. The Term is
applied to Moses typically, Deuteronomy 5.4, 5. with Gal. 3.19. but really and
antitypically to Jesus Christ, Heb. 12.24. Col. 1.20. Romans 5.10, 11. 1 John 2.1.

A Mediator.
I. A Mediator implies a Difference between two Parties. Gal. 3.20.


II. A Mediator properly signifies a Midler, or middle Man, a Reconciler.

III. A Mediator oftentimes is appointed to make up Differences, that arise
between two Parties upon Breach of Covenant.

IV. A Mediator must be a Person willing to undertake the great Work and
Transaction of making Peace.

V. A Mediator ought to be an indifferent or impartial Person, free from all
Exceptions.

VI. A Mediator ought to be a Well-wisher to Peace, a Person that loves it, and
longs after it; nothing being more acceptable to him, than to be a Peacemaker.

VII. A Mediator must have the great Transaction of making Peace committed to
him, or be invested with full Power and Authority to do it.

VIII. A Mediator ought to be a condescending Person, not to have his own Will
to be done in any respect, further than the Nature of the Cause will require it.

IX. A Mediator is not chosen, unless there appear great need of it, and that
the Business cannot be accomplished otherwise.

X. A Mediator must be fitly qualified for this Work; a Person very wise, and
for Justice, and yet greatly inclined to Mercy; that so he may every way answer
the Requirement of each Party, so far as is necessary.

XI. A Mediator must be faithful, seeking the Interest, Right, Honor, and Weal
of both Parties.

XII. A Mediator many times meets with great Trouble and Difficulty, in
undertaking the composing of some Differences.

XIII. A Mediator ought to be endued with much Patience, Meekness, and
Long-suffering; not only bearing Frowns from one Party, or the other, but also
in his long waiting upon either of them, to yield to Terms of Peace offered to
them.

XIV. A Mediator must be undaunted and courageous, unwearied, not tired out,
nor let the Work fall.

XV. A Mediator should be mollifying, that is, of so pacifying a Temper, as to
labor for such Mediums, that the Streams of strict Justice may run in a way of
Mercy, especially (considering the Weakness and Impotency of one Party) for
Peace sake.

XVI. A Mediator has usually a set Time prefixed, finally to finish and
accomplish his Work.

XVII. A Mediator makes use of strong and powerful Arguments, to bring the
adverse Party to Terms of Peace and Friendship.

XVIII. A Mediator, whose Mediation is rejected, (after long Patience) leaves
the offending Person open to the Severity of the Law.

XIX. A Mediator is made sole Judge in those great Matters he is chosen about,
and is to make righteous Decision between Party and Party, and to give the
definitive Sentence at last.

XX. A Mediator, after he has done and finished his Work of Mediation, gives
up his Trust, and cease to be a Mediator any more in that Affair.

XXI. A Mediator leaves no Liberty of Appeal, after he has past the definitive
Sentence.

Parallel.
I. SIn made a great Breach between God and Man: God is angry with the Wicked
every day. Psalm. 7.11*
Hence by Nature Mankind are said to be the Children of Wrath. Ephesians 2.3. Romans 8.7
The carnal Mind is Enmity against God.

II. Jesus Christ is a Mediator between God and Man. He is not only God, 1 John
1.2*
but Man; not only Man, but God: a blessed Reconciler of Man to God, Gal. 4 4,
^^
and of God to Man.

III. The Difference originally that is between God and Man, did arise from
Man's breaking God's Covenant. Isa. 24.5.
God and Man were in Peace and Concord, whilst Man stood in the State of
Innocence; but when he fell, Heb. 8.9.
Christ came to make up that Breach.

IV. Jesus Christ was willing to undertake the Work of Mediator, to make Peace
between God the offended Creator, and Man the offending Creature. Lo, I come to
do thy Will, O God. Heb. 10.7.


V. Jesus Christ is a Person free from all Exceptions whatsoever. God approved
of him, Acts 2.22.
and Man has no cause to except against him, but contrariwise to be abundantly
thankful to God for choosing him to this Work and Office, because none else
could be found in Heaven or Earth; None able to open the Book, and loose the
Seals thereof, but He. Rev. 5.5, 6.


VI. Jesus Christ is called the Prince of Peace; never did any give such clear,
full, Isa. 9.6.
and undeniable Proofs and Demonstrations of his being a Well-wisher to, Ephesians.
2.15.
and Lover of Peace; witness all he did and endured, or past through, from
first to last, that he might accomplish this Work of making Peace.

VII. God has given Christ full Power and Commission to accommplish this Work
of Mediatorship. He is anointed and ordained to be a Prince and Savior. All
Power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth. Him has God the Father sealed.
Mat. 28.18, 19, 20. John 6.27.


VIII. Christ showed himself to be of a mavelous condescending Spirit: Who
being in the Form of God, Phil. 2.5, 6, 7.
thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation,
etc. He for our sakes became poor, 2 Cor. 8.9.
that we through his Poverty might be made rich. I came down from Heaven, not
to do mine own Will, Joh. 5.30.
but the Will of him that sent me. Not my Will, but thy Will be done. Joh 6 38.


IX. There was great need of, or it was very necessary that there should be a
Mediator betwixt God and Man.

First, On God's part.

Secondly, On the Creatures part.

First; On God's part it was necessary, in respect of his own Glory.

1. In respect of the Glory of his Wisdom. This of bringing forth and ordaining
a Mediator, was the mavelous Contrivance, and the highest Manifestation of
Divine Wisdom: for hereby a way is found to reconcile Justice and Mercy, 1 Cor.
1.2 1 Cor. 2.7. Romans 3.26
and make them meet together in sweet Harmony; that the Punishment of Sin might
be borne, and yet the Sinner pardoned freely in a way of Mercy. Hence (as the
Apostle shows) the manifold Wisdom of God is made known by the Church,
according to the eternal Purpose, Ephesians. 3.10, 11.
which was purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.

2. It was for the Glory of his Mercy and Goodness, which moved Wisdom to seek
out and provide this blessed Mediator, and glorious Means of Reconciliation,
when God might justly have left fallen Man, as he did the fallen Angels.
Moreover, this of a Mediat^^r shows us, that God must be dealt with in a way of
free Grace, Entreaty, and Request. Hence we read, how fervently Christ prayed
and interceded for us, yea, what strong Cries and Tears he offered up in the
Days of his Fiesh. Joh. 17.20. Heb. 5.17.
Whatsoever blessed Relief, Pardon, Peace, etc. Mankind receives, it is wholly
in a way of Mercy and free Grace, through the Mediation of the Lord Jesus
Chriist. By Grace ye are saved. God so loved the World, that he gave his only
begotten Son. Ephesians. 2.8. Joh. 3.16.


3. It was for the Glory of his Justice, which must be dealt with in a way of
Satisfaction; Grace will be dealt with in a way of Entreaty, salva Justitia:
Therefore the Covenant is established in the hands of a Mediator, that is able
to lay down a Price or Ransom: That so God might be just, 1 Timothy 2.6. Romans 3.24
and 5.6. Romans 8.32
and the Justifier of those that believe in Jesus. Nay, when the Lord Jesus
undertook on our behalf, to come up to the Demand of Justice, it is said, God
spared him not, but delivered him up to Death for us all. He bore our Sins in
his own Body on the Tree.

4. The Sovereignty of God is manifested in its Glory, 1 Pet. 2.24
that through a Mediator he is pleased to extend Mercy to Mankind, when none is
afforded to the Angels that sinned; and that Jesus at his Command should lay
down his Life for the Sheep. Joh. 6.38. chapter 10.18. 1 John 3.8. 1 Cor. 1.24


5. It magnifies the Glory of God's Power and All Sufficiency, who can raise up
and restore Man to greater Happiness than ever he had before his Fall, when
Devils and Sin had done their worst.

6. The like might be said of the Holiness, Patience, and Faithfulness of God,
etc.

Moreover, this Undertaking adds to the Glory of Christ Jesus, who is the
Mediator himself; God had hereby a design to greaten the Name of his Son, the
second Person of the Trinity, in our Nature.

1. In that he is constituted (by undertaking in this honorable Office) King,
Priest, and Prophet. Mat. 28.18, 19. Acts 5.31. Joh. 5.27. Ephesians. 2.14. Rev.
1.18. Joh. 3.35. Joh. 17.2. Joh. 5.23. Heb. 12.2.


2. In respect of that great Power which is given to him, to make Peace between
God and Man; to have the Keys to open and shut; and to give eternal Life to as
many as he pleases, or are given by the Father to him.

3. Nay, his Glory shines forth herein to such a degree, that it is the Duty of
all Men to honor the Son, as they honor the Father.

4. Christ has hereby the Honor of accomplishing the whole Affair, being
Author and Finisher of our Faith and Salvation.

Secondly; In respect of Man, there was great need of such a Mediator.

1. God would not treat with Sinners upon any other Terms. There is no Knowledge
of God which is saving, nor Union with him, without a Reconciliation. You that
were sometimes afar off, are made nigh by the Blood of Christ. Ephesians. 2.13. Mat.
11.27
Neither knows any Man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
will reveal him.

2. Without a Mediator, to atone and make Peace between the Father and us,
there is no Communion with him: Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?
Amos 3.3. Joh. 8.22.
Nor Eternal Life: Such as are without Christ, and without God, must die (that
is, be damned) in their Sins.

X. Christ was every way qualified and fitted for this Work. He was not only
wise, but the Wisdom of God; 1 Cor. 1.24. Rom, 3.26 Joh. 10.15
much for Justice, but yet inclined to Mercy, and Pity to the Poor. And then
again, how was he fitted by his being God? It Is from the Worth and Excellency
of his Person, Isa. 53.12. Mat. 3.17. 1 Pet. 1.19
that the Price comes to be satisfactory. Besides, had he not been God, as he
could not have expiated Sin, so he could not have overcome Death, and other
Enemies he was to encounter with, that he might accomplish our Redemption.

2. He must be Man, because he is to plead for us, and be sacrificed on the
Cross in our stead; he must bleed, as well as intercede for Man; Heb. 9.22.
For without shedding of Blood there is no Remission. He must be Man, that he
might be one with us, that his Righteousness might by Imputation be ours; and
that he might receive the Spirit for us, Joh. 17.10 Gal. 4.4, 5. Heb. 9.15.
and we from him who is the Son, receive it with the Adoption of Sons, and
thereby be sure of the eternal Inheritance.

3. He must be God and Man in one Person: A Mediator is not a Mediator of one,
but God is one. And by this Means he is fitly qualified for his Office. Gal.
3.20.
He must be a Person at an equal distance from, and drawing near and allied to
both Parties; having Interest in, and participating of the Nature of each.
Hence it is thought that he is called our Dayes-man, (or Kinsman) that lays his
hands on both. Job 9.33,
-- Having access unto them; knowing what will stand with the Honor of the
one, and be for the Relief and Profit of the other.

XI. Christ is faithful both to God and Man, greatly for the Honor of the one,
and as much for the Comfort and Salvation of the other. He is said to be
faithful to him that appointed him. And in respect of Man he is called, Heb
3.2. Heb. 2.1^^.
a faithful High Priest.

XII. Jesus Christ met with much Trouble in the Days of his Flesh, in managing
our Business as Mediator, from the Devil and wicked Men. He found the World
very averse to accept of Terms of Peace; and not only so, Mat. 4.1, 2, 3, 4.
but they offered violence to him, and grievously abused him.

XIII. Jesus Christ was meek, Mat. 11.28, 29.
and lowly in Heart; he patiently bore the Hidings of his Father's Face. How
quietly did he bear and endure the Punishment due to us for our Sin?
notwithstanding we esteemed him not, Isa. 53.3.
but hid our Faces as it were from him. He was oppressed, he was afflicted, yet
he opened not his Mouth. Isa. 53.7.
He patiently waits upon poor Sinners.

XIV. Jesus Christ, as he was potent, so he was of a very courageous and
undaunted Spirit: He shall not fail, Isa. 42.4.
nor be discouraged, till he has set Judgment in the Earth.

XV. Jesus Christ was a pacifying Mediator; for instead of a personal
Satisfaction from the Sinner, God accepts of his Mediation: He was made Sin for
us, 2 Cor. 5.21.
who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.
Instead of an inherent Righteousness, Romans 9.32. Romans 4.5. Heb. 8.12.
God accepts of a Righteousness imputed; and accepts of Sincerity instead of a
perfect keeping the whole Law; and through his Mediation obtains pardon for
human Frailties.

XVI. Jesus Christ, our Mediator, has a Time set him, to finish his
Mediatorial Kingdom and Office, 1 Cor. 15.28.
which will cease at the end of the World, when all the Elect are gathered in.

XVII. Jesus Christ, our Mediator, uses most weighty and powerful Arguments,
such as in the Word of God set forth the Excellency of his Person, the
Preciousness of his Blood; the Oath, Covenant, and Promises of God; the
miserable Condition of Man, etc.

XVIII. Jesus Christ, when he is rejected, Romans 9.22 Heb. 10.26, 27. Joh 3.36.
after his long Patience and Forbearance, will leave all offending and
impenitent Sinners to the Severity of the Law and Wrath of God.

XIX. Jesus Christ is ordained sole Judge, by the Father, of the Quick and the
Dead, and will in due time make a righteous Decision between God and Sinners,
and pass that dismal definitive Sentence on such as accept not of those Terms
of Peace that he offers to them. God judges no Man, Joh. 5.22.
but has committed all Judgment to the Son. He has given him Authority to
execute Judgment also, because he is the Son of Man. Joh. 5.27.


XX. Jesus Christ, after he has finished his Work of Mediation, at the end of
the World, will yield up his Office unto the Father, and cease to be Mediator
any more. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, 1 Cor. 15.28.
then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him, that put all things under
him, that God may be All in All.

XXI. Jesus Christ, after the last Judgment, and definitive Sentence is past,
will leave no Relief for Sinners; then will that Text be fulfilled, which says,
Let him that is filthy be filthy still. Rev. 22.11




Inferences.
1. SEE what the abominable Nature of Sin is; it is that which made the Breach
betwixt God and Man, Romans 8.6.
and filled the Heart with Enmity against the Majesty of Heaven.

2. From hence also we may admire the Love of God, in sending such a blessed
Mediator to make Peace for us. Joh. 3.16.


3. This also shows the Firmness and Stability of the Covenant of Grace. Christ
keeps and conserves Peace betwixt the Covenant-Parties, Heb. 9.15.
being the Mediator thereof; the Inheritance is from hence sure to all such as
are called.

4. It shows the woeful State of such as reject this Mediator, Heb. 2.3.
and will not accept of those gracious Terms of Peace he offers to them: They
must submit to him, Joh. 12.48
and take Salvation as it is offered by the Father through him, or perish.

5. Let us take heed we own no other to be our Mediator, as Christ is our
Mediator. Ministers may pray for us, and one Saint may mediate and intercede to
God for another; but none have power to make Peace, Psalm. 49.7, 8. 1 Timothy 2.5
or to give to God a Ransom for his Brother: There is but one Mediator betwixt
God and Man. Christ mediates by the Price and Virtue of his own Blood, which
alone is that propitiatory Sacrifice, by which we have Peace and Acceptance
with God the Father.

6. Let all labor to accept Christ Jesus as Mediator; which none can do,
unless they receive him as King, Priest, and Prophet.

Christ a Surety.
Heb. 7.22. (...).

By so much was Jesus made a Surety of a better Testament, (or Covenant.)


(...), or (...), a Surety, is one that undertakes for another, wherein he is
defective really, or in Reputation; in Latin, Sponsor, Dr. Owen on Heb. 7.22.
p. 221.
Fidejussor.

1. Whether it be derived of (...), prope, nigh; or from (...), spondeo,
promitto, to engage or promise, it imports the Nearness of the Surety and
Debtor, -- Christ being made near to us. All good Authors, whether Jurists or
Humanists, thus understand it: Sponsor proprie est, Vid. Par. Com. in Heb. 8.6.
Calv. Lex Jurid. etc.
qui pro alio satisfactionem spondet: That is, A Surety is properly one that
engages to make satisfaction for another. The Hebrew (...) Gnarab, is a Root of
as large, or larger Signification, than any in that Language, as Mercer says:
Non est Radix apud Hebraeos, quae tam late pateat.

1. This answers to the Greek (...), Surety. -- Its primary Signification is
miscuit, commiscuit, he has mixed or mingled, Prove. 14.10. Psalm. 106.35.

2. But by a Liegh* Crit. Sacr. in voce (...)
Metaphor it is put for side-jussit, spospondit, sidem interposuit; that is, he
has engaged or past his Promise and Truth for another, Jer. 30.21. so becomes
his Surety, as Genesis 43.9. In this Sense we take Christ to be a Surety, and
therefore will run the Parallel under that Notion; for tho he is really and
properly a Surety, yet the original Notation of the Hebrew, which the Greeks
translated by the Word in the Text, being not so, it leaves no ground for
Cavil, if this be reputed a Metaphor; for so Mr. Liegh in Crit. Sac. calls it.

3. The Word signifies to give Pledges, Isa. 36.8. 2 King. 18.23.

4. Sometimes to strike hands, for so the Sureties were engaged, as Prove.
22.26. rendered by the Septuagint by (...), as a Surety.

Surety.
I. SUretiship supposes or imports two or more Parties in a way of Commerce or
Trade one with another.

II. A Surety either engages for one or both Parties covenanting: This (tho
rarely) is done among Men; for one sometimes engages to see the Terms and
Conditions of the Covenant kept on both sides; as one that becomes the Warranty
of a mutual Contract.

III. A Surety engages before or after the Obligation of the principal Debtor.

IV. A Surety is one that undertakes for another, whose Credit is not good, or
whose Faithfulness or Ability touching Performances becomes suspected.

V. The Introduction of a Surety in any case, is to give Stability and Security
in case of Bonds, Covenants, etc. for it is never done but upon a supposition
of Defect on some account or other.

VI. Suretiship imports Obligation for another, and is ranked by Lawyers among
Contracts: Fidejussor non fit nisi per Stipulationem. Be not Surety for Debts,
etc.

VII. A Surety does not only undertake for Debtors, but sometimes also engages
for Criminals.

VIII. A Surety, if the Party he engages for be not able to satisfy, or give
full Compensation to the Creditor, pays the Debt himself; for in the sense of
Law he is one with the principal.

IX. Suretiship imports the Obligation to be voluntary, for the Law forces none
to be bound for another.

X. Suretiship imports great Love and Pity to the Debtor, which inclines the
Sponsor (tho without hopes of Repayment) to become his Security, rather than
see him ruined.

Parallel.
I. GOD and Mankind are concerned in a way of spiritual Commerce and
Correspondence one with another. God gave many Talents, Luke 19.13.
many choice Blessings, Privileges, Opportunities, etc. to Man, to trade with
and improve in a spiritual way, to the Glory of his Creator.

II. Christ, our spiritual Surety, (as he is Mediator) undertakes on God's part
to the Creature: 2 Cor. 1.20.
All the Promises of God in him are Yea, and in him Amen, unto the Glory of
God, etc. He undertakes on the Creature's part to God: Luke 22.32
-- I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.

III. Christ's Suretiship or Undertaking in the behalf of the Creature, was
part of the Result of God's eternal Counsel; yet this Office of his may be
considered as subsequent to Man's Obligation.

IV. Christ (being a fit Person) undertook not only to be a Mediator betwixt
God and Man, Isa. 53.5, 6, 7, 10. Mat. 20.28 1 Timothy 2.6 1 Cor. 6.20. Romans 3.25,
26. Heb. 10.5, 6, 7, 8. Romans 8.2, 3. 2 Cor. 5.19 Heb. 8.9, 10. Gal. 3.13.
but also to be the Surety of the Covenant on Man's part, upon consideration of
his Impotency or Inability to perform the Conditions of the first Covenant
since the Fall, and to bear the Punishment for the Breach of it; for Man having
once failed, and become Bankrupt, God will neither treat nor trade with him
more, without a Mediator, and such a Surety as Christ. Because they continued
not in my Covenant, I regarded them not, says the Lord. See Dr. Owen on Heb.
7.22. p. 225.

V. The Stability of the new Covenant depends upon the Suretiship of Christ,
and it is secured to Believers thereby. For the first Adam (in whose hands the
whole Estate and Riches of Mankind were trusted) ran out of all; and therefore
God established another Covenant, Heb. 8.8.
and constituted Christ (as a responsible Security, of known Fidelity, and
mighty to perform) to be the Surety thereof, that so it might be a firm and
sure Covenant between Him and Man.

VI. Christ by becoming Surety, stands engaged to the Father to satisfy in the
behalf of Man, so far as God sees it necessary, or comports with his Wisdom,
and the Perfections of his holy Attributes; That he might be just, Romans 3.26
and the Justifier of him that believes in Jesus.

VII. Those that Christ, the Surety of the Covenant, undertook to make Peace
for, were not only spiritual Sins are called Debts, Mat. 16.12 (...) deb^^. 1.
In the Evangelists, the words, Sins and Debts, are used promiscuously; as Luke
11.4. compared with Mat. 6.12. and Luke 13.4. Luke was learned in Greek, and
wrote (...), Sins, in the Lord's Prayer; whereas Matthew has (...), Debts.
Canin. in loc. N. T. p. 86, 87.
Debtors, but Criminals also, such as deserved Death, dead in Law, and under
the Sentence thereof spiritually dead, being under the deprivation of the Light
of God's Countenance.

VIII. Christ seeing how unable we were to make Satisfaction according to the
Demands of Law, made a full Compensation, and laid down a valuable Price,
satisfactory to Law and Justice; for he bore the Punishment due to us for our
Sins. First, he endured Death, and the Curse of the Law; he died, and was made
a Curse for us. Secondly, he bore or sustained the Wrath of God, being under a
deprivation of the Light of his Countenance; Gal. 4.
the Favor of God was for a time suspended and withdrawn from him: My God, my
God, why have thou forsaken me? He was made Sin for us, that knew no Sin, etc.
Mat. 27.
God has laid on him the Iniquity of us all.

IX. Tho Christ was appointed by the Father to be the Surety of the Covenant,
yet all that he did was his own voluntary Act: I lay down my Life freely, John
10.
no Man takes it from me, etc.

X. The Love and Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ was such, 2 Cor. 8.9. Gal. 2.20.
that tho he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, that we through his
Poverty might be made rich. I. live (says the Apostle) by the Faith of the Son
of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.



Surety.
I. A Surety among Men is not of the Creditor's, but of the Debtor's
procurement.

II. Sureties and Debtors amongst Men enter into the same Bond, and the Debtor
is looked upon to be the principal Bondsman.

III. Among Men, when the Surety makes a full Compensation for Debts, the Party
indebted cannot be said to receive a Release or Discharge in a way of Grace and
Favor, but only in a way of Justice.

IV. Among Men usually the Surety's Bond is for Debts, contracted at or before
the Surety's Bond is given in, and for a particular Sum, or Sums, specified.

V. A Surety sometimes repents his coming into Bonds, and it is a great Trouble
and Perplexity to him, and seeks ways to be released. My Son, Prove. 6.1, 2
if thou be a Surety for thy Friend, if thou have stricken hands with a
Stranger, thou art ensnared with the Words of thy Mouth, etc.

VI. A Surety many times undoes himself by being bound for other Men; he
engages for more than he is able to pay, and is thereby cast into Prison, and
never capable to deliver himself out.

Disparity.
I. THe Surety of the Covenant was of God's procurement, (who is Man's offended
Creditor, or rather Creator.) God chose, called, and anointed Christ to this
Office; tho it is true, he was as ready to accept of it, as the Father was to
assign it him. In this the infinite Grace and Mercy of God was manifest to
Mankind; for among Men, the Creditor is not concerned to seek out a Security
from the Debtor: But should a Creditor do so, all must confess, it is in his
Choice to propound when, how, and upon what Terms the Debtor should be
discharged; and it would be thought very reasonable, (especially if he has
wronged or abused the good Name of his Creditor) that before he be acquitted,
he should be brought upon his Knees, and humbly confess his Fault, and beg
Forgiveness, in regard, tho a Compensation was made (according to the Demands
of Law and Justice for the Debt) yet the Surety being of the Creditor's own
procurement, and indeed his own Son, who having vast Riches and Abilities, (and
likewise equal Love with the Father to the poor Debtor, knowing the Law was
such, that Satisfaction must of necessity be made) offered freely to lay down
the Price or full Sum. Even so God and Christ, in making of this Covenant in
behalf of Sinners, agreed (that upon Christ's laying down his Life as a
satisfactory Price) when, and upon what Conditions, we should be discharged of
the Guilt of Sin, which binds us over to eternal Wrath: And these Conditions
are expressed in the Word of God, viz. Faith and Humiliation; for it is certain
that no Man is actually acquitted before he believes, and takes hold of the
Satisfaction purchased by Christ, applying his Merits, and the Virtue of his
Blood, unto his own Soul, by the help of the Spirit, which Christ (the Surety)
has promised to give to all sincere Ones, that he might thereby make his Death
effectual to them, and so complete his Work and Office of Suretiship.

II. Christ engaged as our Surety without us. Our Bonds and Obligations signify
nothing, by reason of our utter Inability; Christ has therefore changed our
Name, and in the room and place of it put his own, so that Death and the Curse
fall upon him: Isa. 53.6. Isa. 63.5.
He was wounded for our Transgressions. He looked, and there was none to help;
therefore, his own Arm brought Salvation.

III. Christ, the Surety of the Covenant of Grace, makes full Compensation for
Sin, and yet the Sinner receives his Release in a way of Grace; which may be
thus demonstrated: First, God, as was said, and not the Sinner, found or
provided the Surety, which his own Sovereign Grace and Goodness moved him to,
being wholly at his own choice whether he would save Man or no, having cause
enough to cast him off for his Disobedience, as he did the Angels that sinned:
So that whatever Relief or Discharge Sinners receive, it is of Grace, being
wholly the Contrivance of the Creditor, to find out the way which best
comported (in his Wisdom) to the satisfying of Law and Justice, in behalf of
the Criminal; had the Debtor found the Surety, as it is among Men, the Case had
been otherwise. Secondly; The Suretiship of Christ holds forth abundant Grace,
yea, the greatest demonstration of the Love and Goodness of God to Sinners, in
that he was pleased to dispense with his own Law, as to the rigorous exaction
of it from Sinners, and to take satisfaction from another, which he might have
exacted from them. Thirdly; That he might bring about Redemption and Pardon for
Man, he parted with his own dear Son, who laid down his Life, to atone, and
make Reconciliation between him and Sinners. Fourthly; In that the Blessing and
Benefit of Christ's Undertaking as our Surety, is given and bestowed freely
upon us, so that we have no more to do, but to fall down on our Knees, and
humbly acknowledge our Offenses, and accept of a Pardon through Christ's
Mediation, and own him to be our Prince and Savior. Fifthly; In that he, as
our Surety, gives to us a broken Heart, and renews a right Spirit in us; gives
us the Grace of Believing, whereby we come to have an Interest in him, through
the Atonement made by his Blood; from whence it appears, it is not our Faith,
nor our Acceptance of Christ and the Gospel, that makes his Satisfaction so to
God, tho it is hereby made effectual unto us.

The Sum of all is this, that Christ did not die only nostro bono, for our Good
and Profit, as Socinians affirm; but in our Stead and Rome; for where one is
said to die for another, it is always thus taken. Moreover, where it is said,
Christ bore our Sins, etc. it is to be understood of the Punishment due to them;
for in all places of the Old Testament, where it is said, Thou shall, or, they
shall bear their own Sins, it is meant of the Punishment of them. So that if we
would be pardoned, we must accept it as God is pleased to offer it to us, tho a
complete Satisfaction be made for Sin, in our Nature, to the Father. And shall
we dislike that way of Forgiveness, that God is so much pleased with, wherein
he does not only magnify his own Free Grace and Goodness, but his own Justice
and Holiness also?

IV. Christ became Security for his Peoples Debts, before ever they were
contracted, or they themselves born; yea, he was bound to satisfy for all the
Debts (of such who do believe in him) that at any time of their Lives should be
contracted; that is to say, Heb 8. Isa. 53. Jer. 3.5. 1 John 2.1, 2.
he bore not only the Punishment due to them for Sins committed before their
Calling and Conversion, but all their Iniquities afterward, through human
Frailties committed; tho it is not alleged, they were discharged before
committed, nor before true Repentance be wrought in them, for Repentance and
Pardon go together: Him has God exalted on his right hand, to be a Prince and
a Savior, Acts 5.
to give Repentance to Israel, and Remission of Sins.

V. Christ never repented his Suretyship; instead of its being a Trouble to his
Mind, he delighted in it. I have a Baptism to be baptized with, and how am I
straightened till it be accomplished? Psalm. 40.8.
I delight to do thy Will, O my God. He knew the Payment of all would fall upon
him, and yet he shrinks not from it. John 10.17, 18.
I lay down my Life freely.

VI. Christ, tho he suffered hard things for his People, in becoming their
Surety, yet was not undone, or brought to utter Beggary thereby; for tho for a
time he became poor to make us rich, yet by suffering Death he was crowned with
Glory and Honor; his Abasement was for his Exaltation; he expended not all his
Riches in satisfying for our Sins: Tho he was cast into Prison, ( viz. brought
to the Grave) yet he quickly delivered himself out, by the Powerfulness of the
Godhead which dwelt bodily in him.



Inferences.
1. FRom hence we may perceive what a miserable Condition Mankind had involved
themselves in by reason of Sin, utterly impoverished, and brought to Beggary,
Debtors to God's Justice for the Breach of the Law, owing ten thousand Talents,
and not a Farthing to pay; Mat. 18.24
and had been cast into the eternal Prison of Darkness, had not Jesus stepped in
and become our Surety.

2. What Grace and unspeakable Favor is here! How much has God outdone
Mortals! He sought out a Surety to satisfy for our Sins, who were not only
ill-natured Debtors, but cursed and most guilty Rebels, who deserved nothing
but Death, and Chains of Darkness. Tho he does not pardon us without a Price,
yet rather than we should be without Remission, his own Son shall be the Ransom.

3. Moreover, we may admire the great Mystery of our Redemption! Let Men take
heed how they contemn any part of the Depths of God, because they seem to
overtop and outdo their depraved Reason.

4. Here are Tidings of great Joy to broken and undone Sinners. There is a way
open for free Commerce and Trading with God again: Tho he did not regard us
whilst we stood under the old Covenant, being miserable Beggars and Bankrupts;
yet he delights to have Commerce and Dealing with us in a way of Grace, through
the Compact made with Christ our Surety.

5. Let Saints hold up their drooping Heads and Hearts, their Debts are paid:
Isa. 53.6. Romans 8.1.
The Lord has laid on him the Iniquity of us all. There is now no Condemnation
to them that are in Christ Jesus.

6. Why should any think the Conditions of the Gospel are hard, or Christ's
Commands grievous? What you cannot do, Christ has undertaken to help you in,
Isa. 26 12. Phil. 4.19. 2 Cor. 12.9.
and see done by you. He has wrought all our Works in us. My God shall supply
all your Wants. -- My Grace is sufficient for thee.

7. Moreover, let us consider what Benefits do accrue to Believers, by virtue
of Christ's Suretiship.

First; By this means we are delivered from the hands of Justice, and Curse of
the Law, and Wrath of God: Christ has redeemed us from the Curse, Gal. 3.13.
being made a Curse for us.

Secondly; We owe our Covenant Relation, first, unto God's Grace; and secondly,
to Jesus, our blessed Surety and Mediator's undertaking: I have manifested thy
Name to the Men which thou gave me, John 17.
etc.

Thirdly; This is the Ground of the Saints Support against the Power of Sin,
Romans 7.25
and indwelling Corruption: Thanks be to God, through our Lord Jesus Christ,
etc.

Luke 22 32 Isa. 63.1. Romans 16.20.
Fourthly; From hence we may groundedly expect Succor in Temptations: I have
prayed for thee. He has undertook for thee, who is mighty to save, and who
will bruise Satan under your Feet shortly.

8. How are we obliged to God our Father, and to the Lord Jesus Christ, for the
Work of our Redemption? O let us love God, and love Christ, and live to their
Praise, whilst on Earth.

Heb. 4.16.
9. This also may embolden the Godly to draw near to God; they have a Surety, or
one that has undertaken for them. He is engaged for God to them, and for them
to God; he makes sure the Promises to us, and renders our Services acceptable
to God.

10. Woe, woe to them that have not Christ their Surety; what will Sinners do
without a Savior? If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your Sins.
Joh. 8.22.


Lastly; For Trial. Have you Christ for your Surety? examine your selves by
these Marks following.

1. Did you ever see the Need of Christ's Suretiship? Or do you adventure to
come to God for more Goods in your own Name: In this take heed, for your Credit
is gone.

2. Has Christ taken you (as a Door) off the old Hinges? Have you seen your
Want and Beggary, and from hence chosen Christ for your Surety? It Is only the
broken Man that seeks to his Friend for Security.

3. Is the Law written in your Hearts? have you that new Spirit put within you?
Jer. 31.33. Psalm. 119.140.
are you changed Ones? I will put my Fear in their Hearts, etc. Do you love the
Word of God because of the Purity of it? Would you be holy as well as happy?

4. Do you lay the Stress of your Salvation upon Jesus Christ? Is he the
Foundation of your Faith and Hope? Have you fled to him for Refuge?

5. Is Christ a Pearl of great Price to you? To them that believe he is
precious. If Sin be in thy Sight the greatest of Evils, and that which thou
loathest above all things; and Christ the rarest Jewel in thy Esteem, whom thou
preferrest before thy chiefest Joy; then Peace be unto thee: Christ is thy
Surety.

For Caution. O let none, from the consideration of this glorious Grace shining
forth in this great and wonderful Mystery, take encouragement to run further
into Debt; if any should so do, let them know, that there is nothing can be a
greater Evidence against them, that they have no Part nor Lot in this Matter.

Christ a Bridegroom.
Mat. 25.6. Behold, the Bridegroom comes, go you out to meet him.

John 3.29. He that has the Bride, is the Bridegroom; but the Friend of the
Bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the
Bridegroom's Voice: This my Joy therefore is fulfilled.


THis Metaphor of a Bridegroom, as it is exceeding useful, so it is as
comfortable and pleasant a Metaphor as most we meet with in the holy Scriptures.

A Bridegroom presupposes two things: First, a Person in a single capacity; and
as so considered, he is a Suitor. Secondly, a Person in a married Estate; and
as so considered, he is a Head or Husband. In both these respects Christ may be
considered, and is held forth in the Word of God. He first acts as a Lover or
Suitor, to engage the Love and Affections of Sinners to himself; and then joins
himself in a glorious, mystical Marriage-Relation with them, and accordingly
acts toward the Sons of Men: Of which take this following Parallel.

Metaphor.
I. A Man that intends or is disposed to marry, is not contented (or thinks
it not convenient) to abide in a single Condition, how happy soever he is
otherwise, in the enjoyment of all outward good things in his Father's House.

II. An obedient and wise Son takes advice, and consults with his Father, being
fully resolved to change his Condition, and enter into a Contract of Love, and
Marriage-Union; and then fixes upon a particular Object.

III. When a Man has fixed upon an Object that he intends to espouse unto
himself, he contrives the way and method of his Proceeding, in making known his
Mind, and to bring about his Design; and many times will choose to send
Messengers, to treat with the Person about the Business, and discover his
Affection, before he goes himself in Person.

IV. After this, a Lover usually (his Heart being enflamed with Love and ardent
Affection to the Person, tho she be in another Country, very far off) takes a
Journey, resolving to give her a Visit; and in order thereunto he suits himself
in a fit Garb and Clothing, that so he might every way render himself a Person
acceptable, and meet, likely, and capable of winning and enjoying of her.

V. If the Person or Suitor be a Prince, and known, commonly at his Arrival he
is much congratulated and welcomed, by the Nobility, and Persons of Honor.

VI. A Lover, when he goes to visit a Person he intends to espouse unto
himself, usually sends his Friend, or takes him along with him, to signify, not
only what and who he is, but also his Intention and Purpose in coming.

VII. A Man propounds Questions to the Person he loves, to discover whether she
be preingaged to any other; and if he perceives she is entangled through great
Folly, and in danger to be utterly undone thereby, he strives to undeceive her,
and save her from Ruin.

VIII. A Lover makes Offers of Love unto the Person he has fixed his Eye upon,
and uses diverse Arguments, to persuade her to yield or consent unto his Request.

IX. A true Lover respects his intended Bride, more than Wealth, Beauty, etc.
It Is not the Portion, but the Person his Eye is principally set upon.

X. Such a Person sues hard, uses weighty Arguments to prevail, and will not
quickly take a Denial.

XI. A faithful Suitor waits long, and has much Patience, before he will
desist or give over his Suit, and yet thinks nothing too much that he suffers
or does endure for her sake; as appears concerning Jacob, who served seven
Years for Rachel: And they seemed unto him but a few days; Genesis 29.20
for the Love he had to her.

XII. One that intends to make a Person his Bride, and only Consort, expresses
great Love; his Love is sometimes much more than he can well express; it is very
strong, as strong as Death; many Waters cannot quench it, nor can the Floods
drown it. There is an unsatisfied Desire in the Person, until the Object
beloved be enjoyed.

XIII. Such an one is greatly concerned and grieved at the Unkindnesses of his
Friend, and ungrateful Repulses, and many times from hence does withdraw
himself, and carry it as a Stranger.

XIV. A Suitor nevertheless (such is the Nature of his Affection) knows not how
to give her up; he therefore sends Letters, thereby further expressing the
Ardency of his Desire, and how loath he is to take his final Farewell.

XV. Moreover, besides all this, he sends faithful Messengers to her, as
Spokesmen, to answer her Objections, that so (if it be possible) he might bring
her at last to a compliance; who use also many Arguments in order thereunto.
This Abraham's Servant acted, Genesis 24.35, 36, 37.
when he went to take a Wife for Isaac.

XVI. A Suitor also sends Love Tokens to the Person he intends to make his
Bride: Isaac sent unto Rebekah, Genesis 24.22
Earrings, and Bracelets of Gold.

XVII. A Lover cannot endure Corrivals, nor permit that another should have a
part, or an equal share in the Affection of the Object beloved.

XVIII. Some Lovers have fought great Battles, and met with great Opposition
from Enemies, for the sake of those Persons they have set their Hearts upon.

XIX. A Man will not make a Contract of Marriage with one that is engaged to
another Person; she must be free from all others, if he espouse her to himself.

XX. When a Suitor has obtained the Love and full Consent of the Person
beloved, (and being satisfied upon all accounts, respecting such things as we
have hinted) signifies in the next place his Resolution to betroth or marry her
unto himself; and that it might be orderly and legally done, she is given to
him.

XXI. The Espousal-Day being come, and consummated, there is great Joy in the
Family, amongst the Servants and others, to see this happy Conjunction.

XXII. A Bridegroom usually, especially if he be a Prince or noble Person,
settles a Jointure or Dower upon his Bride, entitles her to such or such a
Place, City, Land, or Inheritance.

XXIII. A Bridegroom leaves his Bride a while (after he has espoused her) in
her own Country, and in her Father's House, does not immediately carry her home
to his own Habitation.

XXIV. A Bridegroom rejoices over his Bride, and much delights in her. Isa.
62 4.


XXV. The Bridegroom discharges the Bride from many Debts and Dangers, by means
of this Marriage-Contract, and Conjugal Knot: He now stands liable to those
Actions and Arrests, which otherwise, had she abode in a single State, would
have come upon her own Head.

XXVI. A Bridegroom, if he be a Prince, or noble Person, raises his Bride to
great Honor; She is called by his Name, has the Attendance of his Servants,
and lies in his Bosom.

XXVII. A Bridegroom supplies the Wants of his Bride; it is his part, and great
concernment, to provide all things needful for his Wife that he has espoused.

XXVIII. A Bridegroom sympathizes with his Spouse, and helps to bear her
Burdens; is greatly troubled when she is afflicted, and cannot endure any
should affront, misuse, or wrong her.

XXIX. A Bridegroom requires Obedience. The Man has, and ought to have,
preeminence over the Woman; he is her Head, and she is commanded to be in
subjection.

XXX. A Bridegroom reproves his Bride for the Faults that he sees in her, from
that great Love he bears to her.

XXXI. A Bridegroom nevertheless hides and forgives many Infirmities that he
sees in his Spouse, and will not lay open her Weakness, nor expose her to
Reproach, as Joseph thought to have dealt with Mary.

XXXII. A Bridegroom advises and instructs his Spouse, in all things wherein
she stands in need of it from him.

XXXIII. A Bridegroom is greatly pleased with the good Behavior of his Bride,
takes much delight in her Company, leading her into pleasant Places, to lovely
Fields, and Springs of Water, for her Solace and Refreshment.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ, notwithstanding all the Glory he had with the Father, Isa.
42.1. Heb. 1, 2, 3 Prove. 8.31.
being the Joy and Delight of his Heart, and clothed with all his Excellencies
and Perfections, dwelling in the fruition of eternal Bliss, yet thought upon a
Spouse, and judged it meet to enter into a Marriage-Relation.

II. Jesus Christ took counsel with the Father about that glorious Design of
Love and good Will he bore to Mankind; and hence he is said to be delivered by
the determinate Counsel and Fore-knowledg of God. Acts 2.23*
It was no less than the great result of the Blessed Trinity, that the Lord
Jesus, the second Person, should espouse Sinners to himself: I proceeded, says
he, Joh. 8.42*
and came from God; neither came I of my self, but he sent me. He fixed not his
Choice on the fallen Angels, but on the Offspring of fallen Man, who were
given unto him by the Father.

III. Jesus Christ having fixed his Eye upon lost and perishing Man, agreed
with the Father upon the way and method of Proceeding, what he must do and
become, in order to the accomplishment of this glorious Enterprise: And
accordingly the Father was pleased, out of his abundant Grace, in a fit season,
to make known his eternal Counsel, and proposed Jesus Christ, the Seed of the
Woman, to the Sinner, as an Object of Love; and not only so, but also before he
came himself, he sent his Messengers, the Prophets, rising up early, and
sending them, to offer Terms of Love and Friendship, 2 Chronicles. 36.15.
and reveal his Purpose to them.

IV. Jesus Christ after this, such was the greatness of his Love, and strength
of his Affection, resolved to take a Journey to give poor Sinners a most
gracious Visit; the Journey he took was long, as far as it is from Heaven to
Earth. And that he might accomplish his blessed Purpose, he fits himself with a
Garb accordingly, laying aside his heavenly Robes, he clothed himself with our
Flesh, or did assume Man's Nature, that so he might every way become a meet
Object for the Sinner, and likely to come and enjoy him at last.

V. When the Lord Jesus came into the World, the Angels of God, who had
knowledge of him, in an heavenly way of Congratulation, magnified the Most High:
And suddenly there was with the Angel a Multitude of the Heavenly Host, Luke
2.13, 14.
praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the Highest, and on Earth, Peace,
good Will to Men. But how ungratefully was he welcomed and entertained by the
Generality of Mankind, for whose sake he came into the World?

VI. The Lord Jesus, when he came into this World, to espouse poor Sinners in a
spiritual way, sent John Baptist to prepare the Way before him, and make ready
a People for him, who bore witness of his Majesty, and declared the Excellency
of his Person, as also his gracious Intention: He that comes after me is
mightier than I, Mat. 3.11. Joh. 1.27.
whose Shoes I am not worthy to bear, (in another place unloose) He shall
baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire. Ye your selves bear witness,
that I said, I am not the Christ, but I am sent before him. Joh. 3.28, 29.
He that has the Bride is the Bridegroom; but the Friend of the Bridegroom,
which stands and bears him, rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom's
Voice: This my Joy therefore is fulfilled.

VII. Jesus Christ propounds Questions in his Word to poor Sinners, thereby to
discover how it is with their Souls, showing the Danger of being in love with
Sin, or to rely upon their own Righteousness, or to have their Affections
inordinately set upon the things of this World; he strives to undeceive them.
Why do you not understand my Speech? -- He that commits Sin, is the Servant
of Sin, says he. Unless a Man deny himself, and take up his Cross, he cannot
be my Disciple. He that loves Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of
me, etc. Unless ye believe that I am he, ye shall die in your Sins. Joh. 8.22*
Luk^^ 13.2, 3.
Jesus answered, and said unto them, Suppose ye that those Galileans were
Sinners above all the Galileans, because thy suffered such things? I tell you
nay, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

VIII. Jesus Christ offers his Love unto Sinners, showing how willing he is to
embrace them in the Arms of his Mercy. He commends his Favor and good Will to
Sinners many ways: First, by his taking our Nature upon him, and coming into
the World. Secondly, by those hard things he met with in this Life for our
sakes. Thirdly, by shedding of his Blood. Fourthly, he commends his Love by the
continual Motions of his Spirit upon our Hearts, and by those inward Checks of
Conscience, besides those blessed Offers and Tenders of Grace, which dropped
from his gracious Lips: If any Man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. Look
unto me, Joh. 7.37. Isa 45.22. Mat. 11.28 Rev. 3.20.
and be saved, all ye Ends of the Earth. Come to me, all ye that are weary and
heavy-laden, and I will give you Rest. Behold, I stand at the Door, and knock;
if any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in unto him, and sup
with him, and he with me.

IX. Jesus Christ loves poor Sinners, not for any thing he sees in them, not
for Beauty, Riches, etc. For naturally Mankind has nothing that may render
them any way desirable in Christ's eye; he might see enough in them to loath
them, but nothing to love them.

X. Jesus Christ sues hard, is very importunate, uses many powerful and weighty
Arguments to prevail with Sinners to accept of the Terms of Grace, and join in
an holy Contract of Love with him. 1. One is taken from the Dignity of his
Person, being the Root and Offspring of David; David's Lord, as well as
David's Son. I (says he) and my Father are one. 2. From that early Love and
good Will he bore to them: When there were no Depths, was I brought forth: --
When he gave the Sea his Decree, -- Then was I by him, as one brought up with
him, Prove. 8 24, 29, 30, 31.
and I was daily his Delight, rejoicing always before him: Rejoicing in the
habitable Parts of the Earth, and my Delights were with the Sons of Men. And in
another place, I have loved thee with an everlasting Love, therefore with
Loving Kindness have I drawn thee. Jer. 31.3.
3. From the Intention or Purpose of his coming so long a Journey; I am come
that ye might have Life, -- Not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to
Repentance: -- Come to seek and to save that which was lost. 4. His great
Abasement and Condescension. 5. From his Suffering: I lay down my Life for my
Sheep. Can there be a greater Argument than this? 6. He argues with Sinners
from the Consideration of their own Misery, and that absolute Necessity there
is of closing with him, and the blessed Effects of it: He that believes on the
Son, has everlasting Life; and he that believes not the Son, Joh 3.36.
shall not see Life, but the Wrath of God abides on him.

XI. Jesus Christ waits long, and has much Patience, before he does desist his
Suit, and leave Sinners to perish in their Iniquities. How long did infinite
Patience wait upon the old World? was it not one hundred and twenty Years? and
forty Years upon Israel in the Wilderness: I have (says he) spread out my
hands all the day unto a rebellious People. Isa. 65.2.
But if he prevails at last, he thinks nothing too much that he has suffered
for Sinners. He waits at the Door of his Spouse, until his Head is wet with
Dew, and his Locks with the Drops of the Night; Cant. 5.2.
yet does he not think all too much.

XII. Jesus Christ does express and manifest great Love to Sinners, which he
intends to take into Covenant Relation with himself. His Love, like Nilus,
overflows all Banks and Bounds; his Grace is without Limits, beyond the Love of
Jonathan to David. What does the Gospel show or express more plainly, than the
Strength of Christ's Love to Sinners? Christ expressed such Love that never any
other had, in laying down his Life for his Enemies, for such that were Rebels
to him and his Father. There is Depth, Height, Length, Ephesians. 3.19*
and Breadth in it, it passes Knowledge.

XIII. Jesus Christ is greatly troubled at the ungrateful Repulses he meets
with from Sinners; which appears, 1. By his being grieved: He was grieved
because of the Hardness of their Hearts. When he drew near to Jerusalem, he
wept over it, perceiving how basely they had slighted and rejected him. 2. By
condoling and bewailing their miserable State and Obstinacy: Israel will have
none of me. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Mat. 23.37
how often would I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen gathers her
Chickens under her Wings? and ye would not. 3. By hiding of his Face, and
bringing Afflictions upon them: I will go and return to my place, till they
acknowledge their Offenses, and seek my Face: Hos. 5.15.
In their Afflictions they will seek me early.

XIV. Jesus Christ, notwithstanding all the Unkindnesses of Sinners, has
afforded them his Word, wherein is expressed his good Will and Desire to them;
nay, and more than this, sends many a kind Message to them by the sweet Motions
of his Spirit, to awaken their Consciences, before he leaves them finally: Thus
he strove with the old World. Genesis 6.3.


XV. Jesus Christ sends his faithful Ministers, who are as Spokesmen for their
Master: 2 Cor. 11.2
I have (says Paul) espoused you to one Husband, that I may present you as a
chaste Virgin to Christ. I have espoused you; the meaning is, I have been
employed as an Instrument sent and commissionated by the Lord Jesus to do it.
Many Arguments they use to bring poor Sinners to accept of the Offers of Grace,
and receive Jesus Christ; as, 1. They, like Abraham's Servant, set forth the
Greatness and Riches of their Master: Genesis 24 35.
The Lord (says he) has blessed my Master greatly, and he is become great; he
has given him Flocks and Herds, Silver and Gold, etc. And Sarah my Master's
Wife bare a Son to my Master when she was old, and to him has he given all
that he has. God is very great, all things in Heaven and Earth are his, the
Cattle upon a thousand Hills; and says the Servant of God* he has given unto
Christ all that he has: All things are delivered unto me of my Father. Christ
is very rich, the Heir of all things. Mat 11.27 Joh. 13.3. Heb. 1.2. Psalm.
45.2. Joh. 1.12.
2. They set not out only the Greatness and Riches of Christ, but his excellent
Beauty also: Thou art fairer than the Children of Men. 3. The Power of Christ.
4. His Wisdom. 5. His Love and rich Bounty. 6. They set before Sinners, what
the Promises are if they receive him, and what Glory they shall be raised to.
7. The Wofulness of their present State, and what it will be in the end, if
they do refuse him: Knowing therefore the Terror of the Lord, we persuade Men.
2 Cor. 5.11.


XVI. Jesus Christ sends tokens of his gracious Love to all such that he
intends to marry, and betroth unto himself for ever; he gives them a Cabinet of
costly Jewels, the Graces of the Spirit, to adorn them: Prove. 1.9.
They shall be an Ornament of Grace unto thy Head, and Chains about thy Neck.
Grace is like a Box of precious Ointment, whose odoriferous Smell perfumes the
Hearts and Lives of Believers.

XVII. Jesus Christ cannot endure that the Heart of-a Professor should be
divided, or that a Man or Woman should have one Heart for Sin, and another for
him; he must have the whole Heart, or he will have none of it: Mat. 22.37.
Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul,
etc. Conscience may be for Christ and his Ways, and the Judgment may be much
enlightened, when the Will may be opposite, and the Affections set chiefly upon
Sin, and the Vanities of this World: Their Heart is divided, now shall they be
found faulty.

XVIII. Jesus Christ met with greater Opposition, and fought more sore and
fearful Battles than ever any did, for the Sinner's sake; as witness his
Conflict with Satan, that strong Man armed, Mat. 4.3, 4, 5, 6.
with Sin and Wrath, and last of all with Death it self; over all which Enemies
he gloriously triumphed, and got a perfect Conquest.

XIX. Jesus Christ will not take into Covenant, or make a Contract of Divine
Love or Grace, with a Person that is not dead to the Law. We must see the
Insufficiency of that, and of our own Righteousness, and have no confidence in
the Flesh, if we would win Christ. Phil. 3.3, 8.
Wherefore, my Brethren, ye also are become dead to the Law, Romans 7.4.
-- that ye should be married to another, even to him that is raised from the
Dead, that we should bring forth Fruit unto God.

XX. When Jesus Christ, by his Word and holy Spirit, has brought over all the
Faculties of the Soul unto himself, finding the Person dead to Sin, Self, and
to this World, and all things being removed which obstructed this happy
Contract; he then proceeds, and takes the Soul into Union with Himself: But,
according to that holy Order and Decree of God, no Soul is espoused by Christ,
but such as is given to him by the Father: All that the Father has given me,
Joh. 6.37.
shall come unto me.

XXI. No sooner is a Sinner converted by Faith, united or espoused to Jesus
Christ, but there is great Joy amongst the Angels of God in Heaven, and amongst
the Saints of God on Earth: Luke 15.10.
Likewise I say unto you, there is Joy in Heaven, in the presence of the Angels
of God, over one Sinner that repents. And so in the case of the Prodigal, at
his return: The Father said to his Servants, Bring forth the best Robe, Luke
15.23, 24.
and put it upon him, and put a Ring on his hand, -- And bring hither the
fatted Calf, and kill it; and let us eat and drink, and be merry. -- And they
began to be merry.

XXII. Jesus Christ settles upon each Soul he espouses, a very great
Inheritance; he makes over a Jointure of an inestimable value, a Kingdom of
Glory, a Crown that fades not away, even everlasting Blessedness.

XXIII. Jesus Christ leaves his Church, and each believing Soul (whom he takes
into Union with himself) in this World for a while, and does not immediately
take them to himself, or carry them to Heaven, his own Habitation.

XXIV. Jesus Christ delights greatly in his Church, and in every sincere
Member thereof; hence Zion is called Hephzibah: Isa. 62.4, 5.
And as the Bridegroom rejoices over the Bride, so shall thy God rejoice over
thee.

XXV. Jesus Christ discharges his Saints and People from all those Debts that
bind over to eternal Wrath. Sinners were miserably indebted to the Law and
Justice, owed ten thousand Talents, but had not a Farthing to pay; liable every
day to Arrests, and to be sent to the dark Shades of eternal Night, or Prison
of utter Darkness, under the Wrath of the incensed Majesty, having whole
Mountains of Sin and Guilt lying upon them, running every day into new Scores,
adding Sin to Sin, one heavy Debt upon another. O how great is the Guilt of
sinful Man! and how unable to satisfy Divine Justice! How then shall these
Debts be paid, all these Sins expiated, and the Guilt taken away? Justice calls
for full Payment; it is Language is, Pay, or perish: yet we cannot make the
least Reparation, nor right God for the Wrong we have done him, by offending
the Eyes of his Glory. But now by a Marriage-Covenant with Jesus Christ, all is
at once discharged, and the Sinner acquitted; there being Riches and Worth
enough in him, who has fully satisfied the Demands of Law and Justice; and by
Union with him the Sinner comes to be interested into all. He was made Sin for
us, who knew no Sin, 2 Cor. ^^.21.
that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him. The Lord has laid on
him the Iniquities of us all. O how happy is that Soul that is espoused to
Jesus Christ!

XXVI. Jesus Christ confers great Honor on those that are espoused to him. The
Church is called a Queen; and how comes that to pass, but by means of this
Contract and Marriage with Christ: Upon the right hand stands the Queen, Psalm.
45.9.
with Gold of Ophir. Believers are called by Christ's Name, have the Attendance
of his Servants, the holy Angels: The Angels of the Lord encamp round about
them that fear him. Psalm. 34.7.
He has given his Angels charge concerning thee. Saints lie in the Bosom of
Christ's Love and Mercy.

XXVII. Jesus Christ supplies all the Wants, and makes blessed Provision for
his Saints: They that fear the Lord shall not lack any good thing. Psalm. 34.10
Whether it be Grace or Peace, either Food or Physic they want, they shall
have it from him; all is in Christ: In him all Fullness dwells; Gal. 1 19.
and in him, so as to be let out and communicated to his Saints.

XXVIII. Jesus Christ sympathizes with his Saints: In all their Afflictions,
it is said, Isa. 63.9.
he was afflicted. And in another place, it is said, Judge. 10.16.
His Soul was grieved for the Misery of Israel. He himself has suffered: Being
tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted. Heb. 2.18. Heb. 4.15.
We have not an High Priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our
Infirmities. Zech. 2.8. Psalm. 55.22
He that touches you, touches the Apple of mine Eye. Cast thy Burden upon
the Lord, and he shall sustain thee.

XXIX. Jesus Christ requires Obedience of his Church, and of every Member
thereof; hence Paul says, Ephesians. 5.24. Ephesians. 1.21, 22.
The Church is subject unto Christ. The Lord Jesus is exalted above all
Principalities and Power, Might and Dominion, and every Name that is named, not
only in this World, but also in that which is to come; and is given
particularly to be Head over all things to the Church. Luke 6.46*
Call ye me Lord, says Christ, and do not the things that I say?

XXX. Jesus Christ reproves his Saints for their Evils and Transgressions, out
of his great Love. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Rev. 3.19.


XXXI. Jesus Christ covers the Weaknesses and Infirmities of his People. He
covers our Sins, Psalm. 32.1. Heb. 8.12.
does not upbraid us with our Faults, but forgives our Iniquities, and
remembers our Sins no more. Tho his Saints have many Spots and Blemishes, yet
he through his great Grace overlooks them all, and will not expose them to
Reproach, here nor hereafter, for them.

XXII. Jesus Christ gives Counsel and Instruction to his People: Rev. 3.18.
Psalm. 73.24 Psalm. 16.7.
I counsel thee, etc. What heavenly Instruction has he left in his Word, of
which we stand in need at all times?

XXXIII. Jesus Christ is greatly pleased with his People, when they walk as
becomes the Gospel. Do good, and communicate; for with such Service the Lord
is well-pleased. To distribute to the Ministers of Christ, Phil. 4.18. Col.
3.20.
is said to be a Sacrifice acceptable, and well-pleasing to God. Children, obey
your Parents in all things; for this is well-pleasing unto the Lord. Come, my
Beloved, let us go forth into the Fields, let us lodge in the Villages: Cant.
7.11, 12.
-- Let us see if the Vine flourish, whether the tender Grape appear, and the
Pomegranates bud forth: There will I give thee my Loves. He leads me beside the
still Waters. Psalm. 23.2.




Metaphor.
I. A Great and mighty Prince will not set his heart upon, nor court a Leper, a
Creature blind, deformed, full of running Sores, and old Ulcers, from the Crown
of the Head, to the Soal of the Foot.

II. Much less will a King leave his Crown and Kingdom, and deny himself of all
his Glory, become poor and contemptible, not having so much as a small Cottage
to dwell in, nor Money in his Pocket; nay, be exposed to as great Miseries as
ever any Mortal was; and all for the Sake and Love he bore to such a wretched
Creature, and loathsome Leper, blind and deformed, a mere Vagabond, and
contemptible Beggar; and yet a Creature that was his Enemy, a notorious Rebel,
and Hater of him.

III. Other Lovers and Bridegrooms mind their own Advantage and Interest in
seeking a Wife.

IV. The Beauty that another Bridegroom finds in his Spouse, is not transmitted
from him unto her; he cannot confer Beauty, nor more comely Features; if she be
hard-favoured, deformed, and ugly, so she must remain.

V. Some are not very constant in their Love; they cool in their Affection, and
love not always alike, nor to the end.

VI. A Princely Bridegroom provides not the Wedding-Garments for his Bride, he
is not at the charge of adorning her; the Bride does procure her own Attire,
her Robes, Rings, and costly Ornaments.

VII. Other Bridegrooms die, and leave their Wives and dear Consorts Widows,
and their Children Fatherless.

Disparity.
I. THe Lord Jesus set his Heart upon the Sinner, when cast out to the loathing
of his Person, in his Blood, like a newborn Infant. Every Sinner is a Leper in
a spiritual sense, defiled all over, wounded, full of Ulcers and stinking
Putrefaction, as loathsome as a filthy Sepulcher; every Faculty of the Soul
unclean, and the Members of the Body polluted. Hence it is said, Isa. 1.5, 6.
Ezekiel. 16.4, 5, 6.
We have no soundness from the Crown of the Head, to the Soal of the Foot. Yet
when the Sinner was in this Condition, that was the Time of Christ's Love.

II. Jesus Christ left his Kingdom, and all that Glory he had with the Father,
which was infinite and unconceivable, shining forth in all the Excellency and
Perfections of the Heavenly Majesty, with the Attendance of all the Angels of
Light, those glorious Seraphins and Cherubins, who bowed down to worship at his
Royal Feet; yet he left all this, and became poor, and a Man of Sorrows, 2 Cor.
8.9.
exposing himself to greater Pain and Misery, than any Mortals are capable to
endure; and all this for the sake of poor, polluted, and deformed Mankind, who
were Enemies to him by wicked Works. Col. 1.21.


III. Jesus Christ did all to raise us to Honor. There could be no Addition to
his Glory and Happiness; 'twas our Interest and Advantage he sought, in all he
passed through, and endured.

IV. Jesus Christ finds Sinners very ugly and deformed, in Head and Heart, in
Face and Feature; but he transmits or confers his glorious Beauty unto them.
Hence the Churches Beauty is said to be perfect, Ezekiel. 16.14.
through that Comeliness the Lord has put upon her. He makes the Soul that was
polluted, clean; that was deformed, very beautiful and amiable to look upon.

V. Jesus Christ is unchangeable in his Love: Jer. 31.3.
I have loved thee with an Everlasting Love, therefore with Loving Kindness
have I drawn thee. He will rest in his Love: Having loved his own that were in
the World, Joh. 13.1.
he loved them unto the end.

VI. Jesus Christ is at all the Charge of clothing and adorning the Church,
and every sincere Believer and Member thereof.

VII. Jesus Christ never dies; he was dead, but dies no more: Heb. 7.25.
He ever lives to make Intercession for us. He will never leave Zion a Widow,
nor her Children Orphans. I will not leave you comfortless.



Inferences.
I. WE may infer from hence, how infinitely Sinners are obliged and beholden
unto God, in providing such a great and good Match for them. Did ever any King
manifest such Kindness to vile and wicked Traitors, as to send his own Son to
die for them, that they might be interested in all the Blessings of his Court
and Kingdom? God propounds Christ to us as a Spouse and Bridegroom.

II. Moreover, how infinitely are we obliged to Jesus Christ, for bearing such
good will unto us, to pass by the fallen Angels, and fix his Eye upon poor
fallen Man; to come into the World, and expose himself to all those base
Affronts, Shame, Sorrow, and Death it self, that he might accomplish this
glorious Design of Love and Marriage-Union with us!

III. It shows what great Folly, and horrid Ingratitude, those Sinners are
guilty of, that slight and contemn this Offer. Which may lead you to consider:

1. What is your State without Christ? If you have not Christ, what have you?
No Life, no Light, no Pardon, no Peace, no God, no Glory. You are without all
true Good, if you are without God and Christ. Sine summo bono, nihil bonum.

(1.) Is it not Folly to prefer Bondage to Sin and Satan, before a
Marriage-State with Jesus Christ? rather be the Devil's Slave and Vassal, than
Jesus Christ's dearest Consort?

(2.) Is it not great Folly to refuse such an Offer, that will make you happy
for ever, if embraced, and when there is no other way of being happy? If this
Offer be rejected, thou art undone, and must be damned.

(3.) Is it not great Folly to value the Lusts of the Flesh, and Pleasures of
this World, above Christ? to value the greatest Evil above the chiefest Good?

2. It Is great Ingratitude. Has Christ done all this, and will thou slight him
at last? Shall he come to thy Door, and will thou shut him out? Is there no
room for him in the Inn? shall he lie in the Stable? Shall Satan command the
Heart, and Christ only have the Lip?

(1.) Is it not great Ingratitude to pour such contempt upon Christ? Do not
they that refuse him, and slight the Offers of his Grace, derogate from him? Do
not such vilify his Person? Do you not say in your Hearts, Isa. 53.2.
There is no Beauty in him, Form, nor Comeliness?

(2.) Do you not pour contempt upon his Undertaking, and undervalue his Blood
and Suffering? We read of some that tread under foot the Blood of the Son of
God, Heb. 10.29.
and judge it to be a thing of no worth nor excellency; and what do thou less,
who do not believe in him, embrace him, and apply his precious Blood and
Grace for Help and Healing?

Exhort. If this be so, then labor, whoever thou art, to accept of Christ.
Do think to do better? what Object can thou find, that more deserves thy
Affection?

1. He is great, honorable, a King, the King of Kings; all other Kings are his
Subjects; he is King of Heaven, Earth, Hell.

2. Great in Power: He has led captive the King of Darkness, has spoiled the
Principalities of Sin, that so long tyrannized over Thousands, yea, Millions of
Thousands; has overcome Death, the King of Terrors, that none of the Mighty
could ever encounter with.

3. He is the amiablest Object in the World, his Beauty far exceeds the Beauty
of the Luminaries, much fairer than the Children of Men.

4. He is rich, unsearchable in Riches. What would thou have, or can thou
desire, but it is in him?

Would thou know the ready way to be espoused unto him? Then,

1. First of all, break off that Affinity thou hold with Sin, and get thy
Heart off from the inordinate Love of this World.

2. Thou must become dead to the Law, and thine own Righteousness.

3. Labor to see an absolute Necessity of marrying with him.

4. Get thy Judgment well enlightened in the Mysteries of Grace and Glory, that
come by Jesus Christ.

5. Hearken to the Motions of thy own Conscience; for Conscience is employed,
when thoroughly awakened, and rightly informed, as a Spokesman for Christ.

6. Take heed of a divided Heart; never rest till thy Will is brought over to
accept of Christ, and the Offers of Grace.

7. Labor to choose Christ singly, a naked Christ. Christ is able every way to
make thee happy, and fully answer all thy Desires; take heed therefore of going
after other Lovers, give not his Headship and Sovereignty away.

IV. This shows what a happy State the Godly are in. Can the Soul be poor, that
has such a Friend and Husband as Christ is? If David concluded he should not
want, Psalm. 13.1.
because the Lord was his Shepherd; be sure thou shall not, because Christ is
thy Husband: The Bridegroom takes more care, and is more tender of his Bride,
than any Shepherd of his Sheep or Lambs.

V. This speaks great Terror to the Wicked, that oppress and misuse God's
People, and make a Spoil of his Church. What will they do, when the Bridegroom
rises up to plead the Cause of his Darling? He will not spare his Arrows, but
tread them down in his Fury.

Lastly; Be prepared, you that are Virgins; the Bridegroom is coming, the
Midnight-Cry will soon be heard; get your Lamps trimmed, and Oil in your
Vessels.

An EPITHALAMY on the Soul's Marriage with CHRIST.
By E. D.
THe Match is made, and Crowds of Angels come,
Prepared to sing an Epithal'mium.
Diffusive Sparkles of Seraphick Fire,
Exalt the Music of the raptured Quire:
An universal Chorus loudly votes,
To grace this Wedding with their shrillest Notes.
Hail Glorious Prince! Mat. 21.9.
The universal Air
Eccho's Hosannahs to the Illustrious Pair.
Let no Parenthesis of Clouds obscure
This blessed Day, but still as bright endure
As now: Let Mortals in sweet Consort sing
Anthems to Thee in an eternal Spring.
December's Frost, the scorching Heat of June,
Shall no more put thy Singers out of Tune.
Hail Glorious Prince, whose unexampled Love
Brought thee from those bright Royalties above,
To court thy Spouse: Tho no Magnifick Dress
Did set thee forth, thy Glory's never the less.
Tho thou were treated with perverse Disdain,
Myriads of Angels waited on thy Train. Luke 8.20.

Shepherds inspired, thy joyful Welcome sing;
Star-guided Sophies their Oblations bring. Mat. 2.1*

O blessed Espousals, that our Freedom bought!
O happy Match, that our Redemption wrought!
Hail Glorious Spouse! for ever blessed in Him,
That crowns thy Brows with Heaven's Diadem.
Amazing Change! unparalled in Story!
A Slave advanced to everlasting Glory!
A Virgin, fettered in the Bonds of Sin,
Unbound, espoused, made glorious all within!
From base Estate, beyond a Queen in Honor!
A peerless Beauty now bestowed upon Her!
Since Words are narrow, and Conception's weak
TO express my Joy, in Ecstasies I Will speak:
Entranced in sacred Raptures, I Will rejoice;
Rather than fail, to melt into a Voice,
Where Cherubs Hallelujahs do rebound,
I Will ( Echo like) reverberate a Sound.
For Heaven 's shrill Quire, and Earth do join in one,
To quaver out this (...).
Epithalmion.
Christ the express Image of the Father.
Heb. 1.3. (...). And the Character of of his Substance: We translate it, The
express Image of his Person.


THe Term [ Character] is a Metaphor taken from the Image, Figure, or
Impression of a Seal, representing the Proto-type, or first Pattern, in every
thing. The Word is derived of (...), ( charattein) which signifies to ingrave;
the Father having (as it were) most indelibly engraven his whole Essence and
Majesty upon this his Eternal Son, and drawn his own Effigies upon him from
everlasting, being his substantial Image and exact Representation. Which
Explication fairly agrees with this Mystery, leading our Mind to such
Discoveries, as will stir us up to desire the gracious participation of its
Fruit and Efficacy: For it opens the Secret of eternal Generation, and the Love
of the Heavenly Father. A Seal is more highly valued, and more closely kept,
than other things. See Isa. 42.1. Mat. 3.17. and 17.3. John 3.35. and 17.24.
Through an Union with this blessed Image, the lost Image of God is restored in
Believers; now inchoatively, or with respect to Beginning; after Death,
consummatively, or with respect to Perfection. Col. 3.10. 1 Pet. 1.4. not by
Essential Transmutation, but by a Mystical Union.

Metaphor.
I. AN Image is the Likeness of, or does represent and express the Person whose
it is.

II. An express Image represents a Person unto others.

III. An express Image represents a Person unto us, whom we many times cannot
see personally, because absent, and at a great Distance from us.

IV. An Image, and the Person it represents, are not the same.

V. An express Image brings him, who is held forth or represented by it, into
our Minds, whereby we call to remembrance what manner of Person he is, and
thereby contemplate upon his Beauty, and excellent Accomplishments, which
before probably might be forgot.

VI. An express Image, if it represents some noble or renowned Person, one that
has an endeared Love and Affection to him or her to whom it is sent, their
great and only Benefactor, or a dear Relation, is exceedingly prized and valued
by the Receiver.

VII. An express Image of a Person is curiously drawn, and is a most rare and
admirable Piece of Workmanship; it is viewed and commended by all skilful and
discerning Persons in that Art.

I. CHrist is the Likeness of the Father, See Ark of the Covenant, p. 164.
the true Form, Figure, Character, or Representation of him. This Similitude
(says a Reverend Divine) relates to the Persons of the Godhead; Phil. 2.6.
it is borrowed from the Impression of a Signet: The Son in himself is (...),
Dr. Owen on Heb. 7.3. p. 55*
in the likeness of God.

II. Christ is (...), the Image of God, representing him unto Men; he
manifests God unto us. He is said to be (...), the Image of the Invisible
God, Col. 1.15.
because partaking of the Nature of the Father, the Goodness, Power, Holiness,
Grace, and all other glorious Properties of God, do shine forth, or are
represented, declared, Dr. Owen.
and expressed to us.

III. Christ represents God the Father to Believers, in his true Form,
Character, or Likeness, whom we see not as he is in himself, nor can see, he
dwelling in inaccessible Light, at an infinite distance of Divine Nature, and
manner of Being, from our Apprehensions and Conceptions. No Man has seen God
at any time; John 1.18.
the only begotten Son, which is in the Bosom of the Father, he has declared
him.

IV. Christ, respecting his Essence, is the same God with the Father; but the
Subsistences or Persons of the Father and Son are different, and so not the
same.

V. Christ being the express Image of the Father, Mat. 11.27, 28. 2 Cor. 3.18.
2 Cor. 4.46.
brings into our Minds what kind or manner of God the Almighty is; his
Excellencies, and glorious Perfections, are hereby presented as it were to our
view: By which means we are taken up into holy Meditations and Contemplations
of him, whom by reason of Sin, we had forgotten, and lost the true knowledge of.

VI. Christ being the express Image of God the Father, who is the blessed and
only Potentate, and the glorious King of Heaven and Earth, who has dear and
tender Love to us his poor Creatures, who is our Friend, Husband, Father,
gracious and chief Benefactor, causes all true Believers greatly to prize,
love, and esteem the Lord Jesus, not only for his own sake, but for the sake of
him whom he does resemble and represent.

VII. Christ, God-Man in one Person, or God manifested in the Flesh, 1 Timothy
3.16.
the glorious Representation of the Father to Sinners, is the Admiration of
Saints and Angels; it is a great Mystery, and comprehends the Depths of God:
That the Glory of God should shine forth in the Nature of Man, is, and will be
the Wonder of both Worlds; it is judged by all the Godly, to be the Masterpiece
of Divine Wisdom.



Metaphor.
I. AMong Men, the Substance of a Thing has the precedence, or is before the
Sign or Image of it; the Person, and then the Picture or Emblem of it.

II. An Image, Figure, or Character among Men, cannot fully and perfectly, in
every thing, express or represent the Person it is made for; it differs in
Matter, Life, and Motion, etc.

III. It Is gross Idolatry to worship Images, or the Likeness of any Thing in
Heaven above, or the Earth beneath.

IV. Other Images are soon marred, and pass away.

Disparity.
I. THat which is said of Christ, (...), being, or existing and subsisting in
the Form of God, that is, being so essentially; for there is no (...) Form in
the Deity, Dr. Owen.
but what is essential unto it: This Christ was absolutely, antecedently to his
Incarnation, the whole Nature of God being in him, and consequently he being in
the Son of God.

II. Christ is a lively, perfect, and complete Image, Character, and
Representation of all the glorious Attributes, Excellencies and Perfections of
the Father; the Fullness of the Godhead dwelling bodily in him. Were it not so,
Col. 2.9*
he could not gloriously represent unto us the Person of the Father; nor could
we, by contemplation of him, be led to an Acquaintance with the Person of the
Father.

1. The Father is from Everlasting; so is the Son.

2. The Father is a perfect Divine Person, or Subsistence; so is the Son.

3. The Father has Life in himself; so has the Son Life in himself.

4. The Father created the World; so did the Son.

5. The Father upholds all things by the Word of his Power; so does the Son.

6. All things were made for the Father; so all things were made for the Son.

7. The Father is to be worshipped; so is the Son.

8. The Father knows all things, and searches the Heart; so does the Son.

9. The Father is in the Son; so is the Son in the Father: The Father is in me,
Joh 10.38
and I in him. The Father being thus in the Son, and the Son in the Father, all
the glorious Properties of the one shine forth in the other. The Order and
Economy of the Blessed Trinity in Subsistence and Operation, requires, Dr.
Owen.
that the Manifestation and Communication of the Father to us be through the
Son.

10. All other Perfections of the Father shine forth in Christ; it is he that
makes them manifest to us, according to that of the Apostle: For God, 2 Cor. 4
6.
who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, has shined in our Hearts,
to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus
Christ. The Wisdom of the Father is great and infinite many ways; but wherein
does it shine more gloriously, than in the Son's working about our Redemption,
in reconciling Justice and Mercy, in punishing Sin, and pardoning the Sinner?
To the intent that now unto the Principalities and Powers in heavenly Places,
might be made known by the Church the manifold Wisdom of God. Ephesians. 3.10.


11. The Father is still of Goodness and Love to Man; this appears in his
making of him Supreme over all Creatures on Earth. But what is this Favor and
Goodness, to that which is manifested in and by Christ? in raising him up (when
a Rebel and vile Traitor) to the Honor and Dignity of a Son, and to accomplish
this, to give his only begotten Son to die in his stead? 2 Cor. 5. ult. Gal.
3.13.
He made him to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the
Righteousness of God in him. Christ has redeemed us from the Curse of the Law,
being made a Curse for us. There was much Favor and Love in the Blessings and
Privileges of Creation; but in Redemption Mercy is magnified likewise to
admiration, and shines in equal Glory.

12. God the Father is infinitely holy, just and righteous. His Holiness and
Justice appeared in casting off the fallen Angels, and by executing his
Severity upon our first Parents, and by destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, and the
Cities about them, and in several other respects: Yet how much more abundantly
does his Holiness and Justice shine forth in the Son, the Image of the Father,
when he came forth to redeem Mankind? in that he made his Soul an Offering for
Sin, Isa. 53.10. Romans 8 32. Isa. 53.8.
God letting out his Wrath upon him, sparing him not, when he stood in the
place of the Sinner: For the Transgressions of my People was he stricken. As
Mr. Buroughs observes, there is nothing sets out God's Justice, Holiness, and
infinite Hatred of Sin, like this, etc. Our Nature is united to the Divine
Nature of God, that so by that mystical Union, Grace and Holiness might be
communicated in a glorious manner unto us.

13. The Power and Condescension of God is wonderful, many ways demonstrated,
but nothing like what it is in Christ, in taking our Nature into Personal Union
with himself; That the Son of God should become Man! the Ancient of Days become
a Child! He that made the World, born of a Woman! When Satan had done his
worst, that he might destroy Man, Man is by the Power of God advanced to
greater Glory and Happiness than he had before he fell.

14. Moreover, I might speak of the Patience, Forbearance, and Faithfulness of
God; all which, and many more of the glorious Attributes of the Father, shine
forth most lively in Jesus Christ. Besides, the Persons or Subsistences of the
Blessed Trinity are more clearly discovered by Jesus Christ, than ever before.

First; In his own Person.

Secondly; In his Doctrine.

Thirdly; In his Baptism, or when he was baptized.

Fourthly; In his Commission, Mat. 28.19, 20.

Fifthly; In their distinct Offices, Operations, and Workings.

Lastly; The Will of God, and his holy Laws and Institutions, are only made
known by the Son.

III. Christ, who is the Image of God, ought to be adored and worshipped by Men
and Angels: And when he brings in the First-begotten into the World, he says,
Heb. 1.6.
And let all the Angels of God worship him.

IV. Christ, the Image of God, abides for ever; Time, nay, Eternity, will not
alter or change him, nor mar his Beauty.



Inferences.
1. WE may from hence perceive the wonderful Love, Goodness, and Condescension
of God Almighty to Mankind, who seeing how unable we are to understand,
comprehend, conceive, or take in the knowledge of Himself, (who is so infinite
and inaccessible in his Being, Glory, and Majesty) is pleased to stoop so low,
as to afford us a Figure, Image, and lively Representation of Himself, that so
we might not frame false Ideas of God, or entertain any vain or unworthy
Apprehensions of him in our Minds.

2. This also abundantly demonstrates, how exceeding willing the Blessed God is
to reveal or make known himself unto his Creatures.

3. This discovers the Necessity of coming unto God by Christ, and what
Advantage the Christian World have above the Heathen Nations: For tho he has
in the visible Creation implanted some Resemblances or Characters of his
Excellencies, and left some Footsteps of his blessed and sacred Properties,
that by the contemplation of them Men might come to have some Acquaintance with
him, as Creator, which might encourage them to fear and love Him, and make Him
their last End; yet all Expressions of God, besides this of Christ Jesus, are
partial, short, and insufficient to discover all that is necessary to be known,
that we may live to him here, and enjoy him hereafter.

4. It may caution all Men, to take heed they do not imagine to come to the
true Knowledge of God any other way but by the Lord Jesus: For no Man knows
the Father but the Son, Mat. 11.27
and he to whom the Son will reveal him. All miss of Happiness, that seek it
not by Jesus Christ. We must seek the Father in the Son, and by him; labor to
believe in, or come to God by Jesus Christ. This is for Direction to us in all
Religious Worship.

5. The Godly may from hence also see, what reason they have to love and
delight themselves in Jesus Christ. Brethren, study the Knowledge of Christ,
look often upon this glorious and blessed Image. Many are taken with Pictures
and Representations of Things and Persons; but how vain is that? Here is the
Image you should delight your selves in; look to Jesus; much Profit, as well as
Joy and Comfort, will redound to you hereby. This is an Image that abides for
ever, which God allows you to worship and adore him by.

6. Prize Christ, value him above all things in this World; can you too highly
esteem him, who is the express Image of the Father's Person?

Lastly; Let all take heed how they slight Jesus Christ, or contemn the
Knowledge of him; because this Mystery is above their Reach, and shallow
Apprehensions; and indeed it may caution all not to seek too curiously into
these great Mysteries and Depths, lest they be drowned: the best of Men know
but in part.

Christ a Physician.
Mat. 9.12. (...), etc. They that are whole need not a Physician, but they that
are sick.


THe same is repeated, Mark 2.17. with which you may compare Isa. 61.1. in
which places the Term is attributed to Christ the Redeemer; the Metaphor being
taken from Physicians, because he gives spiritual Healing in Soul-Diseases, as
Physicians do in the Diseases of the Body; see also Luke 5.31. We read, Job
13.4. of Physicians of no value: Such indeed are all to whom Application for
Remedy is made, besides this Heavenly Physician, who never fails to cure such
as receive his Medicaments. In what respects Christ is termed a Physician, is
to be seen in the following Parallel.

Metaphor.
I. A Physician is a Person skilful in Distempers of the Body, knows the Nature
of Diseases.

II. A Physician is one that knows the Nature of Simples, and other Ingredients
that are good for Cure; studies the Nature of Herbs, Plants, Minerals, etc.

III. A Physician is one that is authorized or licensed. They are first tried,
and approved, and commissioned, before they are admitted to practice Physic,
because many pretend to it that have no Skill, but are mere cheating Quacks and
Mountebanks, that kill more than they cure.

IV. A Physician ought to show and produce his Authority or License to practice
Physic, to such as have Power to require it, that so it may be the better
known, whether he be what he says or not, there being many counterfeit
Physicians.

V. A Physician ought to know the Name and Nature of that particular Disease
under which his Patient labors; he that knows not the Distemper, can never
cure it unless by chance.

VI. A Physician, as he ought to know the Name and Nature of the Disease, so he
must know the Cause of the Disease. The Cure is found, says one, in the Cause;
to discover whence the Distemper grew, and what the Occasion of it was, directs
unto the Remedy.

VII. It behooves a Physician to know the Constitution of his Patient; thereby
he finds out what Diseases the Patient is most subject and incident to.

VIII. A Physician ought to know what Diseases are Chronical or Habitual, from
such as are Acute, that have seized on the Patient suddenly, by Heats, Colds,
Blood, or from other causes.

IX. A Physician ought to be an experienced Man; that greatly tends to his more
necessary Accomplishment: for if he be one that has not seen the Effect of his
Medicines in his own Body, nor in others, it is hard venturing to have to do
with him.

X. A Physician uses proper and suitable Preparatives to dispose his Patient's
Body to a Cure.

XI. A Physician prescribes proper Medicines for every Disease; he does not
apply Medicines that are hurtful and noxious, such as rather kill than cure,
that instead of having virtue in them to cure, are of a poisonous nature, or
have no virtue at all.

XII. A Physician does not only know what Medicines are good for his Patient,
but also takes care to apply them at a right Time; if those things that are
proper for the Disease be not rightly and wisely applied, the Effects are lost.
A Man may do as much hurt by giving a good Medicine, as by giving an ill one.
Hence it is vulgarly said, That that which is one Man's Help, is another Man's
Death; one Man's Meat is another Man's Poison.

XIII. A Physician is very diligent and careful of his Patient he has in Cure,
looks with a quick Eye, tries the Pulse, and gives great charge to all that
attend upon him.

XIV. A Physician rectifies Disorders, and Inequality of Humors.

XV. A Physician searches Wounds to the bottom, to prevent inward Festering,
Corruption, or proud Flesh, that may spoil the Cure.

XVI. A Physician, in desperate cases, when a Member is corrupted, and comes to
a Gangreen, so that the Body is in danger, prescribes ways to cut it off.

XVII. A Physician deals very tenderly in binding up the Wounds of his Patient;
tho he has a Lion's Heart, when he has to do with some in dangerous cases,
yet he has a Lady's Hand, when he comes to others.

XVIII. A Physician gives Antidotes to preserve from Distempers, and save from
Infection.

XIX. A Physician prescribes Rules to Men and Women to preserve Health, as to
Meat, Drink, Sleep, Exercise, etc.

XX. A Physician, when he finds his Patient's Spirits ready to faint, swoon,
and die away, gives him of his choice and high-prepared Spirits.

XXI. A Physician greatly rejoices, to see his Medicines take their desired
Effect, and work an effectual Cure on his Patient.

XXII. A Physician often visits his Patient.

XXIII. It behooves a Physician to be faithful to his Patient, to let him know
how it is with him, whether better or worse; if Death is like to ensue, he lets
him know it, that he may prepare for it.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ is very skilful in Distempers of the Soul and Body too; he
knows what the Nature of every Sin is, (which is the Disease and Sickness of
the Soul.)

II. Christ knows what the Nature, Virtue, and Property is, of all spiritual
Medicines, that are good to cure the Soul, viz. the Nature of his Word, Spirit,
etc. Joh. 6.63.


III. Christ, the spiritual Physician, is authorized and appointed to this
Work. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach
the Gospel to the Poor: Isa. 61.1. Luke 4.18.
He has sent me to preach Deliverance to the Captives, and recovering of Sight
to the Blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised. All he did was as he
received Commandment from the Father. He was tried many ways, and gloriously
approved, to be every way able and capable to undertake the Care and Cure of
Souls.

IV. Christ, when he was asked about his Commission, or by what Authority he
did those things, showed his Power and License to all, produced his Father's
Seal to his Commission, by the mighty Wonders he did; he had John also to bear
witness to him, but says he, I receive not Testimony from Man, Joh. 36.37
but have a greater Witness than that of John; for the Works which the Father
has given me to finish, the same do bear witness of me, that the Father has
sent me. By which means he made it appear that he was no Deceiver. And indeed,
whoever they be that take upon them to bring in new Ways and Means to cure
Souls, if they cannot confirm their Doctrines by such Mediums that no Deceiver
can pretend unto, they are mere Cheats and Impostors.

V. Christ knows the inward Parts, knows every Sin and Disease of the Soul,
knows whether it be the Distemper of the stony Heart, or the Tympany of Pride,
or Unbelief (that Consumption of the Soul) or whatever Plague or Disease does
afflict thee.

VI. Jesus Christ does not only know every Distemper of each Man and Woman, but
also the Cause of it, the first Rise from whence it springs; what Diseases are
Epidemical, and what not; whether the Cause arises from within, from that
inward and universal Depravity, the original Cause indeed of all spiritual
Sickness; or whether the present Grief arises more immediately from an
infectious Air, Persons, or distempered Companions, the Ruin of many Souls;
whether it arises from Unbelief, or Worldly-mindedness, or Neglect of Duty,
Temptation of Satan, or from other Causes, He knows them all.

VII. Christ knows the Inclinations of every Soul, Heb. 12.1, 2.
what Sin or Sins do most easily beset them, or they are chiefly subject unto,
whether it be Pride, or Passion, or the inordinate Love of the Creature, or
whatever else.

VIII. Christ knows all the habitual Diseases of the Soul, such Distempers as
are inveterate, stubborn, contumacious from those common Weaknesses and
Infirmities of Christians, which the best of Men may be overtaken with.

IX. Christ is well experienced; no Physician so ancient, or has had so long
Experience of Distempers of the Body, as he has had of the Diseases of the
Soul. How many has he cured since the beginning of the World, of all manner of
Sicknesses and Diseases whatsoever?

X. Jesus Christ uses proper and meet Preparatives, to dispose and fit Men for
their spiritual Cure; makes them sensible of their State and Condition by
Nature; humbles, and lays them low at his Feet; puts them upon the Duty of
Prayer, and hearing the Word; and quickly after the Cure follows.

XI. Jesus Christ knows what is proper for every Disease of the Soul, and
applies such Medicines as are meet and proper, according to the Distemper, such
as are not hurtful and dangerous, or that have no healing or saving Quality in
them; does not send them to the Light within, to Principles of Morality, to
Popish Pardons, or Dispensations from Rome, to a bare Reformation from a
notorious and scandalous Life, or an external Profession of Religion, Prayer,
hearing the Word, Alms-Deeds, etc. to trust to, or rely upon for Salvation: But
contrary-wise, Mark 1.15 John 3.36. Joh. 7.37.
to Faith in his own Blood, to Repentance and Remission, through the Atonement
and Merits of his Sacrifice on the Cross.

XII. Christ makes a right Application of Truth, as well as he applies that
which is good and proper in it self; he does not preach the Terrors of the Law,
the Severity and Justice of God, to a poor broken Soul, that lies languishing
and trembling, that has the Pillars of his Comfort shaken with the breakings of
Divine Wrath; for such an one he does not prescribe Corrosives, but Cordials,
Luke 10.34
and Supports from the Mercy of God; He pours the Oil of Gladness into his
Wounds, and gives him the Wine of Consolation. On the other hand, when a Soul
is stubborn, swelled in Pride, impenitent, presumptuous, contemning Advice and
godly Counsel, etc. yet say, They shall have Peace, tho they add Drunkenness to
Thirst; Deuteronomy. 29.19.
to apply Pardon, and the glad Tidings of Salvation, (says Mr. Caryl) to such
a Soul, may be its hardening and undoing. Tho Mercy may be tendered to the
Ungodly, for God justifies such; yet says, not to a Man that perseveres in his
Ungodliness, Joh 8.22. Joh. 3.18. Romans 8.13.
that he will justify or pardon him; but contrary-wise says, he will not pardon
them, but condemn and destroy them. The worst of Sinners may be saved, but God
will not save them in their Sins. It Is dangerous to daub with untempered
Mortar, Jer. 6.14.
to pronounce Peace where there is no Peace.

XIII. Christ is very diligent and careful of poor Sinners that he undertakes,
tries their Hearts and Reins, Rev. 2.23.
has Eagles Eyes; his Eyes are never off them; gives charge to his Servants,
Luke 10.35
Ministers of the Gospel, to look carefully after them, that they want nothing;
that every Direction be followed, and wholesome Diet provided.

XIV. Christ rectifies disorderly Affections, and other Faculties of the Soul.
When Pride or Worldliness would predominate, he checks those Evils by his Word,
Spirit, or by Affliction, a sharper way of Cure; and endeavors to balance the
Soul with an Equality of every Grace, 2 Pet. 1.5, 6. Jam. 1.4.
that there may be Love as well as Faith, and that Patience might have its
perfect Work.

XV. Jesus Christ cures none slightly that he undertakes, but searches to the
quick, breaks the very Heart to pieces, and lays it open, with applying
Causticks and Corrosives, viz. Afflictions, etc. corroding Medicines, and then
effectually cures it: They were pricked in their Heart. Acts 2.36.


XVI. Jesus Christ prescribes a way to his Church, Mat. 5.29. Mat. 18.1^^
to cut off a corrupt or rotten Member, when no other means will preserve it.

XVII. Christ carries it gently and very tenderly, when he has to do with some
poor brokenhearted Sinners. Isa. 42.3.
The bruised Reed shall he not break: Come unto me, Mat. 11.28.
all ye that labor, and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.

XVIII. Christ uses many Sovereign Antidotes and Preservatives to deliver from
the Infection of Sin, his Word, Promises, Threatenings, etc. Psalm. 119.9
Thy Word have I hid in my Heart, that I might not sin against thee.

XIX. Jesus Christ has prescribed Golden Rules to Saints, how they may
preserve their Souls in a healthful condition, to avoid Surfeiting, all Excess,
Luke 21.34
and immoderate Use of this World; to keep good Company, and to keep a good
Diet; to live under an able and powerful Ministry, and to be frequent in the
exercise of Religious Duties, Prayer, Meditation, reading God's Word, and
Christian Conference, etc.

XX. Christ, when he finds the Soul of a Believer under Affliction, Losses,
Temptation, Persecution, etc. begins to faint, and his Spirit low, he gives
more of his holy Spirit; the Spirit of Faith is the choicest Spirit in this
case in the World; 'twill not only revive and quicken a dying and doubting
Christian, Ephesians. 2.1* Psalm. 27.13
but will raise to Life such as are dead in Sins and Trespasses: I had fainted
unless I believed.

XXI. Christ rejoices greatly when he sees his Word take place upon the Heart
of Sinners, and when Afflictions, like powerful Potions, cleanse the Soul from
all those noxious Humors, that bring Sickness and manifold Distempers on the
Soul, and that his Patient is effectually cured.

XXII. Christ often visits his poor Patients that stand in need of his Help.

XXIII. Christ is very faithful to poor Sinners, he lets them know the worst of
their Estate, that Death is like to ensue, if they repent and believe not.
Unless ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. Luke 13.3, 5. Joh. 8.22.
And unless you believe that I am he, ye shall die in your Sins.



Metaphor.
I. THe most learned Physician in the World may be deceived in his Judgment
about the Cause and Nature of a Distemper, and so miss of the Cure.

II. Some Physicians, through Ignorance or Carelessness, administer very
destructive and ill-prepared Medicines, often killing more than they cure.

III. Physicians come not to the Sick, until they are sent for; and tho they
come not far, yet expect to be paid for that, besides their Physic.

IV. Physicians are mercenary, do all for hire; some pay for the Physic ('it is
to be feared) much more than it is really worth.

V. A Physician will be sure not to expend any of his own Treasure to cure his
Patients, will not be wounded himself, to heal others, or part with his own
Blood to do it.

VI. Earthly Physicians cannot raise the Living; their Patients die whilst they
are with them, and ofttimes whilst they look on them.

VII. Physicians cannot bless their Physic, know not how to make it effectual
to this or that Patient; the whole Success of what they give depends upon
another.

VIII. Physicians are not patient under Repulses; they cannot bear to be kept
out of door, and slighted by the Sick they come to cure.

IX. Physicians cannot visit many Patients at one and the same time, who live
far and remote from each other.

X. Physicians are subject to the like Diseases with their Patients.

XI. The best Medicines other Physicians use, are compounded of earthly and
corruptible Ingredients, and lose their Virtue by keeping long.

XII. Physicians attend the Rich chiefly, few of them mind or visit the Poor.

XIII. Physicians provide not Hospitals, nor other Accommodations, as Food,
Nurses, and other Attendants, for their Patients, at their own charge.

XIV. A Physician may die himself, and leave his Patient uncured.

Disparity.
I. CHrist cannot be mistaken about the Cause and Nature of any spiritual
Disease, because he is God, and knows all things, yea, the very thoughts of
the Heart: There is not a thought in my Heart, Psalm. 139.4
nor a word in my Tongue, but thou know it altogether.

II. Christ never administered any improper Medicines; all is well and skilfully
prepared, that Christ gives forth to his Patients; if the Dose be hard and
unpleasant to take, yet there is no Aloes, nor one dram of bitter Ingredient in
it, more than he sees a necessity of. Neither do any miscarry under his hand;
for he wants neither Skill nor Care. So that if a Sinner perishes, it is for not
coming to him, or not taking his Medicines, and not observing of his
Directions. O Israel, Hos. 13.9.
thy Destruction is of thy self.

III. Christ came to us who sent not for him, which made him say, I am sought
of them that asked not for me, Isa. 65.1.
and found of them that sought me not. The Patients seek not first, come not
first to the Physician, but the Physician to the Patient. I am come to seek and
to save that which is lost: Luke 19.10
and besides he dearly paid all the Charge of his long Journey.

IV. Christ, the spiritual Physician, does all freely, without Money, Isa. 55.1.
and without Price. We never read of his taking a Penny of any of all those he
cured in the days of his Flesh, either of Distemper of Body or Soul.

V. Christ made himself very poor, and laid out plentifully his Divine
Treasure, that he might cure poor Sinners of all their Maladies. He that was
rich became poor; and, Isa. 53.5.
He was wounded for our Transgressions, he was bruised for our Iniquities; by
his Stripes we are healed. We could not live, such was our Disease, unless our
Physician died; he therefore poured forth his own Blood, 1 Pet. 2.24
to wash and cleanse our wounded, Sin-sick Souls.

VI. Christ cures not only the Living, but also the Dead; he out-does all other
Physicians in this respect; if he speaks the word, Lazarus, come forth. Joh.
5.25.
The Dead shall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall
live. Ephesians. 2.1.
You has he quickened, who were dead in Trespasses and Sins.

VII. Christ can make effectual all his Medicines; he can say peremptorily,
This Soul, this Sickness I will heal, and it is immediately done. Joh. 5.21.
As the Father quickens them, even so does the Son quicken whom he will.

VIII. Christ, the spiritual Physician, is endued with infinite Patience under
all those base Repulses he meets with from vile Sinners. When he comes to heal,
he oft-times stands at their Doors, and knocks, waiting till his Head is wet
with Dew, Cant. 5.2.
and his Locks with the drops of the Night, before he can persuade Sinners to
open to him; other Physicians will not do so.

IX. Christ can visit Thousands, yea, Millions of Thousands, if he please, and
speak to them all at one and the same moment, tho they live Thousands of Miles
asunder.

X. Christ was made like unto us in all other things, but not in this; Heb.
2.17.
he was without Sin; tho he bore our Sicknesses, Isa. 53. 1 Pet 2.22 2 Cor.
1.30.
he had none of his own. He was made Sin for us, that knew no Sin, that we
might be made the Righteousness of God in him.

XI. The Medicines Christ uses are heavenly; 1 Pet. 1.25.
his Word and Spirit abide for ever; they never lose, nor can lose their
Virtue, but have the like efficacy they had five thousand years ago.

XII. Christ takes more care of the Poor than of the Rich, he had rather attend
upon the Poor; such his Bowels yearn unto, and helps out of Pity, as he did the
Woman that had the Bloody Flux twelve years, when all her Money was gone.

XIII. Christ is at all the charge with poor Sinners; he, Luke 10.33, 34 35.
like the good Samaritan, sets the poor Soul on his own Beast, brings him to
his own Inn or Hospital, which was his Church, and gives Money to the Host to
provide all things necessary for him, with a Promise he would discharge the
whole Score at last.

XIV. Christ dies no more, Death has no more power over him, Romans 6.9.
so that he lives to see every Cure perfected that he takes in hand.



Corollaries.
I. THis shows us the weak and distempered State of Mankind by reason of Sin,
that Sin wounds and brings Sickness upon the Soul; every Sin is a Disease. But
because this is handled under its proper Head, we shall not enlarge upon it
here. See Metaphors concerning Sin.

II. Moreover, we may from hence perceive the great Care, Love, and Goodness of
God toward miserable and impotent Sinners, that rather than they should die of
their Sickness, he would send them his own dear Son to be their Physician.

III. It shows also the great Grace and Condescension of Christ, to undertake
the Cure of such miserable Souls at such a dear and chargeable Rate, viz. with
his own Blood.

IV. This shows where Help for Sin-sick Souls is to be had, and to whom they
should go when they are sensible of their Sickness.

V. The Reason why Men perish in their Sins, we may infer from hence, is, Joh.
5.40.
because they come not to Christ, the only Physician of the Soul.

VI. And if Christ be such a Physician as you have heard, be encouraged then,
poor polluted Sinners, to come to Christ.

For Motives, consider,

1. Thou art sick; who is without Sin, and so consequently without
Soul-Diseases?

2. Thou art sick of a dangerous Distemper, 'twill procure Death without a
speedy Cure.

3. There is no other Physician but Christ, neither is Salvation in any other:
Acts 4.12.
For there is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby we can be saved.

4. Christ is a Physician ready upon every Invitation; nay, he comes without
sending for, Rev. 3 20.
is now knocking at the door.

5. He will make an absolute and perfect Cure of it, if he undertakes the Work,
before he leaves thee.

6. Besides, thou may have him tho thou have no Money, no Righteousness, Isa
55.1, 2.
nothing to bring or offer to him as a spiritual Present.

7. Christ cures all that come to him, whatsoever the Distemper be, he has an
universal Medicine, with which he infallibly cures all Sicknesses, Diseases,
and Wounds of the Soul, (save one, viz. the Sin against the Holy Ghost.) All
Sin and Blasphemy against the Father and Son shall be forgiven unto Men. He is
able to save to the uttermost all that come to God by him. How many Thousands,
Heb. 7.25.
and Ten Thousands, has he cured, which are now in Heaven, who once were sick
of the same Diseases that thou art afflicted with? Pride, Passion, Unbelief,
blasphemous Thoughts, etc.

VII. If Christ be such a Physician as you have heard, how inexcusable will all
vile and wilful Sinners be found, that perish in their Blood, and refuse to
come to him?

Cautions.
I. Take heed you do not delay seeking out for Help. Some, when they are sick,
never mind going to a Physician, till Nature is decayed, and the Disease has
seized on them in such sort, that it is too late, there is no help; so do some
Sinners: did not Jerusalem do thus?

II. Take heed you make use of no other Physician. There are many that boast of
their Skill, how good they are at curing of Souls; beware of them, 2 Pet. 2.1.
they privily bring in damnable Errors, even denying the Lord that bought them,
and bring upon themselves swift Destruction. These are like deceitful Quacks,
and Impostors, that design to make Merchandise of you. Remember, their
Medicines are poisonous and destructive.

III. Value not Women's Advice too high. Eve lost her Skill in the Garden, and
learned little afterward. The Apocalyptical Woman of Rome, like many old
Wives, would fain be tampering with the Sick; but above all take heed of her,
for she (like the adulterous Woman Solomon speaks of) has slain and killed
many, yea, Prove. 7.
many a strong Man has been cast down by her: Her way is the way to Hell,
tending down to the Chambers of Death.

IV. Take heed you rob not Christ of the Honor which is due to him as a
Physician; which may be done two ways:

1. When we attribute the Cure to our own Industry, to Skill and Power of our
own, or to Duties, etc.

2. When we attribute our Help and Cure to Instruments, to Ministers, etc.

V. If thou art made whole by Christ, take heed of a Relapse. Sin no more,
says Christ, lest a worse thing come upon thee.

But for Comfort: If by the power of Temptation thou have fallen and
backslidden from God, he can heal thee again. Joh. 5.12. Hos. 14.4. 1 John 2.1,
2.
I will heal their Backslidings, and love them freely. If any Man sin, we have
an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.

Christ a Testator,
Heb. 9.16. For where a Testament is, there must also of necessity be the Death
of the Testator.


THo this Term is thought by some not to be a Metaphor, (Christ being really a
Testator) yet it may not be unprofitable to run the Parallel with Human
Testators. The word in the Greek is (...), (diathemenos) of (...), which
signifies a Testament, which is of the same import with the Hebrew (...)
Berith. A Testament is the Sentence and Declaration of our just Will, of what
we would have done after Death, and is so called, because it is a Testimony of
our Mind, which is not in force (because revocable) till the Testator dies.
Thus the New Testament, or Law of the Gospel, is ratified and confirmed by the
Death of Christ. The Parallel is as follows.

Testator.
I. A Testator signifies a Disposer, or one that makes a Will and Testament,
who has Goods to bestow, and Relations or Friends to give them to.

II. A Testator is one that is under a natural Tie or Obligation, and full of
Thoughts, Cares, and Good Will to his Friends, and hence provides for them when
he is gone.

III. A Testator imports a Person dying, or under the apprehension of
approaching Death, and from hence makes a Testament, and bequeaths Legacies.

IV. A Testator has full power to dispose of whatsoever he possesses, or has
a Right unto, and according to his sole Will and Pleasure bequeaths unto others.

V. A Testator sets down the Person in his Will, to whom he does bequeath or
give Legacies.

VI. A Testator, to make his last Will and Testament firm and authentic, calls
others to witness it.

VII. A Testator, finally to complete, perfect, and confirm his last Will, does
sign and seal it himself; which (according to the Laws and Customs, especially
of the Eastern Nations, as diverse have observed) is done by Blood; moreover,
the Epistle to the Hebrews shows us, that the first Testament was dedicated by
Blood, hence called the Blood of the Testament.

VIII. A Testator, by making his last Will and Testament, usually disannulls
any Will made before.

IX. A Testator makes his Last Will and Testament unalterable by any other, or
by himself; as others must not, so he will not.

X. A Testator takes care to have his Will made known and published after his
death, that the Legatees may know what Legacies are left and bequeathed to them.

XI. A Testator oftentimes limits the Legacies bequeathed to some of the
Legatees, upon Conditions by them to be performed.

XII. The Will of a Testator gives a sure and firm Title to those that he
wishes well to, and bestows Riches on; they hereby are secured: For what can be
more full and undeniable Right, than that which is left or bequeathed to a Man,
by the last Will and Testament of his Friend?

XIII. A Testator ordains or assigns Executors in Trust, to see that his Will
be punctually observed and fulfilled.

XIV. A Testator being dead, no Man can attempt to abrogate or alter any part
or thing that is in his last Will; tho it be but a Man's Covenant, yet if it be
confirmed, no Man disanulleth, or adds thereunto. Gal. 3.15.


XV. A Testator dies, and thereby opens a way for all the Legatees to come into
the possession of the Inheritance that is left them.

Parallel.
I. CHrist, our spiritual Testator, has store of Blessings and good things;
Col. 2.3.
in his hand are all Riches of Grace and Glory; and at the end he will bestow
them on his spiritual Relations, viz. his Children, his Elect, who are called
his Friends: Ye are my Friends, etc.

II. Jesus Christ, Joh. 15.14
by taking his People into Covenant Relation and Union, has laid himself under
strong Bonds and Obligations to them, and from hence takes care of them, and is
filled with thoughts of kindness to them, and provides for their future Good in
his absence.

III. Jesus Christ, Joh. 13.1.
knowing his Hour was coming, that he must go out of the World to the Father,
he being appointed to Death, made his last Will and Testament, and left
Legacies to all his Saints, and faithful Followers.

IV. Jesus Christ, the Testator of the new Covenant, has not only full Power
and Authority to convey all Gospel-Blessings; but all Grace here, and Glory
hereafter, is solely disposed of at his Will and Pleasure, in which way, and to
whom he pleases. He gives Power to become the Sons of God. He has given him
Power over all Flesh, that he should give eternal Life to as many as thou have
given him. Father, Joh. 1.12. Joh. 17.24 Joh. 14.27.
I will that those which thou have given me, be with me, where I am. My Peace I
give unto you.

V. Jesus Christ, as Testator, has set down in his Testament, who the Persons
are to whom he has bequeathed the Blessings of the Covenant, both Grace and
Glory, viz. all that are his Sheep, Joh. 10.23 Joh. 3.36. and 14.27. Joh. 17.20
Heb. 5 9.
all that the Father has given him, all that are regenerated, who truly
repent, and believe in him, and keep his Word.

VI. Jesus Christ, to establish and make firm his last Will, Joh. 5.32, 36, 37.
Acts 10.39.
called sufficient Testimony to witness it; as first, the Father; secondly, his
Miracles; thirdly, John Baptist; fourthly, the Scriptures; and then fifthly,
his Apostles: We are his Witnesses of all things that he did.

VII. Jesus Christ ratified and confirmed his last Will and Testament with his
own Blood: He shall confirm the Covenant, -- he shall be cut off. Dan. 9.26,
27. Heb. 9.16.
For where a Testament is, there must be the Death of the Testator. -- This is
my Blood of the New Testament shed for many. 1 Cor. 11.25. Heb. 9.17.
By Christ's Death there is a Confirmation of the Verity and Reality of the
Covenant, of the Validity and Authority of it, and lastly, of its Efficacy and
Availableness to us; for a Testament is of force after Men are dead, otherwise
it is of no strength whilst the Testator lives.

VIII. Jesus Christ disannulled the Law of the Old Covenant, Heb. 7.12. Heb.
7.18.
by his establishing the New; there is a disannulling of the Commandment going
before, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof: He took away the first,
Heb 10.9.
that he might establish the second.

IX. Christ has made his last Will and Testament so, as never to be altered by
himself. I will put upon you no other Burden, but what you have already, etc.
Rev. 2 25. Psalm. 89.24
My Covenant will I not break* nor alter the thing that is gone out of my Mouth.

X. Christ ordained and commanded his Disciples to publish his Mind and Will to
the Children of Men. Go into all the World, and preach the Gospel; that is,
Mark 16.13, 16.
to make known the Testament: He that believes, and is baptized, shall be
saved; and he that believes not, shall be damned.

XI. Christ has appointed Conditions to be performed by some Men, before they
can actually possess the Grace and Blessing promised, viz. to attend upon
hearing the Word, to pray, believe, repent, etc. If thou do well, shall thou
not be accepted of? If thou followest on to know the Lord, Genesis 4.7. Isa. 55.3.
Luk 13 33 Hos. 6.3.
then shall thou know him. Seek, and ye shall find. Believe in the Lord Jesus
Christ, and thou shall be saved.

XII. Christ's last Will and Testament is the godly Man's Title. Whoever he be,
2 Samuel 23.5.
that Christ has bequeathed such and such a Blessing or Promise to, he is sure
enough of it, from the Nature of the Covenant, and from the Provision that is
made by Christ the Testator, for the fulfilling and accomplishing thereof: My
People shall be willing in the day of my Power. Christ makes the Condition easy
to his Elect. Psalm. 110*3.


XIII. Christ has resigned this great Trust of fulfilling of his Will, into
the hands of the Father, and the Holy Ghost, Joh. 10.29.
who are not only faithful Executors of this his Testament, but able to supply
the Wants of every one, Joh. 17.11 Joh. 10.29 Joh. 14.16
and helps all those to whom the Covenant does belong, Holy Father, keep
through thine own Name those whom thou have given me. I will pray the Father,
and He shall send you another Comforter, who shall abide with you for ever.

XIV. Christ's Will and Testament being confirmed and ratified by his Blood, as
He will not alter it himself, much less may any Man or Angel presume to do it.
If We, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you, Gal. 1.8.
than that which we have preached, let him be accursed. If any Man shall take
away from the Words of the Prophecy of this Book, Rev. 22.18, 19.
God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life. If any Man add unto
these things, God shall add unto him the Plagues that are written in this Book.

XV. Christ by dying opened a way, and gave Legacies to Sinners, to have his
Testament executed; if the Testator had not died, there had been no room nor
access to them that are called, Heb. 9.15.
to receive the Eternal Inheritance.



Testator.
I. THe Death of a Testator amongst Men, makes only his own Will valid, cannot
make and confirm the Will of another.

II. A Testator amongst Men cannot be a Witness to the Will he ratifies and
establishes.

III. A Testator among Men bequeaths or gives Legacies comparatively but to a
few.

IV. A Testator among Men cannot enjoy or possess that Kingdom, Estate, or
Inheritance himself, after he has given it away to others, and settled them in
possession.

V. A Testator amongst Men, commits his last Will and Testament to Men to be
fulfilled.

VI. The best Legacies Testators among Men bequeath, are but earthly and
temporal things.

Disparity.
I. CHrist did not only give force and value to his own Will, but to the Will
of the Father also.

II. Christ is not only a Testator, but a Witness of the same Testament, as
it is the Father's. He is given of God as the great Evidence of Covenant-Love,
and of all the choice Favors and Good Will to Sinners: God so loved the World,
etc. Joh. 3.16.
And secondly, he is given as the great Covenant Interest and Relation betwixt
God and Sinners. He testifies that all that is contained in the Covenant is
true, and the absolute Will and Pleasure of God: He said, these things are true
and faithful. Rev. 22.6. Rev. 1.5.
Who is it that affirms and testifies this? Jesus Christ, who is the true and
faithful Witness.

III. Christ gives Legacies to Thousands, and Ten Thousands; no Godly Man has,
nor ever shall have, any spiritual good thing, but what was bequeathed to him
by Christ's Will and Testament.

IV. Christ, the spiritual Testator, tho he has given away all that he has,
and gives the possession to Believers by his last Will and Testament; yet is
Coheir of the same Kingdom and Glory, and shall possess it together with them.

V. Christ, the spiritual Testator, surrogates his Spirit, in his absence, and
after his Death, to see his Will executed in all points, and to give real and
actual possession of all his Covenant-Blessings, unto them to whom they are
given.

VI. The Legacies Christ bequeaths are spiritual, things of a high and most
sublime Nature. As all things are given to Christ the Mediator, so all that he
is or has, he parts with freely to his faithful Followers; the Graces of the
Spirit, Adoption, Pardon of Sin, Peace of Conscience, precious Promises; in a
word, all things that appertain to the Life that now is, and to that which is
to come: All is yours, and ye are Christ's, 1 Cor. 3.22, 23.
and Christ is God's.



Inferences.
1. THis exceedingly shows forth the Grace and Love of Christ to Sinners, in
that he should assume Man's Nature, and become liable to Death and Mortality;
what mavelous Condescension is here, that he should act or do any thing in
contemplation of Death, and be a Testator, and yet could not see Corruption,
the Grave could not keep him; and yet refused not to submit unto Death, that
thereby through the Spirit he might convey a legal Right and Possession to us
of eternal Life.

2. From hence we may also see, how firm and sure the Covenant of Grace is made
to all the true Seed, and faithful Children of God.

3. And let all the Friends and Legatees of Jesus Christ know, that their Right
and Title to spiritual and eternal Blessedness is of absolute Grace, and mere
Pleasure of the Testator.

4. And what cause have we to praise the Name of God in Christ, who has
published and made known his last Will and Testament unto the Sons of Men? We
have the Mind of Christ.

5. And in that he has left one to execute his Will, and that it is put into
the hands of the holy Spirit in Christ's absence, 1 Cor. 2.16. Joh. 15.26
who is able to do it effectually. But the Comforter, which is the holy Spirit,
whom the Father will send in my Name, he shall teach you all things, he shall
testify of me.

6. Moreover, let all such tremble, that adventure to alter, add to, or
diminish from, any thing that is left in Christ's last Will and Testament; Rev.
22.18, 19.
the Plagues of God, without Repentance, are like to be their Portion for ever.

7. Furthermore, from hence you may see what reason we have to examine what is
preached for Doctrine, or published by any Man as the Mind of Christ; Gal. 1.8.
for if it be not written or found in his last Will and Testament, we ought
utterly to reject it, tho an Angel from Heaven should preach it. -- Whatever is
affirmed to be an Ordinance of Christ's, if it be not, nor cannot be naturally
inferred, without Abuse or Wrong to the Text, let it be abhorred and contemned
by us.

8. This affords much Comfort to the Godly, whose Names are written in this
Testament, and in the Lamb's Book of Life. You will there find exceeding great
and glorious things bequeathed to you, and let it be your care to sue for them,
according to the Will and Directions of the Testator.

9. Also let them not forget their Friend, nor neglect to keep up his
Remembrance in those holy Signs of his Death, and Suffering for their sakes,
which he has enjoined upon them: 1 Cor. 11.24.
This do in remembrance of me, etc.

Christ compared to an Heart.
Cant. 2.9. My Beloved is like a Roe, or young Heart.


THe Lord Jesus in several places is resembled to an Heart.

Simile.
I. AN Heart is a lovely and pleasant Creature, so called in the Proverbs, Prove.
5.19.
pleasant Roe. It Is observed by Writers, that the Heart has some resemblance of
a Lion, a Horse, and a Greyhound, which are all accounted very stately
Creatures.

II. An Heart (as Naturalists tell us) has no Gall. Gesner collected by
Topsall* p. 99.


III. An Heart is a Creature that exceedingly delights in Music, loves to hear
such that can sweetly sing. Pliny, lib. 8. cap. 32.


IV. An Heart or Stag (says Pliny) is the most gentle and mild Beast in the
World. Ibid.


V. An Heart is a Creature that has a very clear Sight, and a quick Hearing;
nay, can see (if Credit may be given to Historians) in the Night as well as in
the Day. Topsall, p. 91.


VI. An Heart is a very loving Creature to those of its kind, and will help its
Fellow, when forced to take to a River, one resting his Head upon the Loins of
his Fellow; and if the foremost tireth, Pliny.
the hindmost changes place with him.

VII. An Heart is a very sociable Creature, greatly delights in Company;
Multitudes of them will (if they can) be together.

VIII. An Heart is a Creature that is chased exceedingly by Dogs, and vexed by
Hunters.

IX. The Heart is a mighty swift Beast, Pliny.
excellent in leaping, and ascending Mountains: Topsal, p. 95.
Their Swiftness does not only appear upon the Earth, Page 91.
but also upon the Waters. David alludes to this, when he says, The Lord has
made my Feet like Hinds Feet. Psalm. 18.34
The lame Man shall leap (says the Prophet) as an Heart. Isa. 35.6.


X. Dictum est de Cervis, quod a^^errime pugnant pro uxoribus, Wolfang.
Franzius Hist. Animal. p. 66.
and sua certamina instituunt in montibus. -- It is said of the Hearts, that
they fight fiercely for their Females upon the Mountains.

XI. An Hind, when she has brought forth her Young, lodges them (say the
Naturalists) in some Rock, Topsall out of Gesner, p. 102.
or other bushy and inaccessible Place, covering them; and if they be stubborn
and wild, beating them with their Feet, until they lie close and contented.
They leap over their young, teaching them to run, and leap over Bushes, Stones,
and small Shrubs, against a Time of Danger. Pliny, lib. 8. p. 213.
Or, as Pliny says, their little Ones they practice and exercise to use their
Legs from the very beginning, etc. They bring them to high, steep, and ragged
Rocks, and there show them how to leap, and withal acquaint them with their
Dens, Ibid.
and Places of Harbor.

XII. The Heart, when it is hunted by the Dogs, will fly to Men; nay, rather
than be made a Prey to the Hounds, run to the Huntsman: In short, it greatly
desires and pants after Help and Relief in its Distress.

XIII. Mirabilis est (...) inter Cervos and Serpents, etc. There is, say
Historians, a mavelous Antipathy, and continual Enmity between the Heart and
Serpents.

1. The Heart knows, by a wonderful Instinct of Nature, Pliny. Gesner.
in what Holes or Caverns they lurk and hide themselves, and by his Breath
brings them out, that he may spoil and destroy them.

2. The Heart is hard beset, and much annoyed by Serpents, Pliny lib. 8. p. 214.
Topsall, p. 100. Gesner.
in Lybia. Multitudes of them do set upon him together, fastening their
poysonful Teeth in every part of his Body; some on his Neck, Breast, Sides,
Back; twine about his Legs, biting him with mortal Rage, which he, throwing
himself upon the Ground, destroys, others he bruises, and so clears himself of
them.

XIV. Cervi, devoratis Serpentibus, ita inflammantur, Wolf. Franz. Hist.
Animal. p. 164
ut ardentissimam sitim concipiant, -- ejulationes edant, donec ad fontem
perveniant, etc. The Heart, when it has devoured Serpents, is so inflamed with
vehement Thirst, that he cries with a lamentable Moan, and rests not, till he
comes to a Fountain to drink.

Ibidem.
XV. Odium inter Serpentem and Cervum etiam durat post mortem, etc. The Hatred
between the Serpent and the Heart continues after Death, when the Heart is slain.
Pliny and Sextus affirm, Pliny. Sextus.
that if a Man sleep on the Ground, having upon him an Hart's Skin, Serpents
never annoy him. The Virtues of his Horn are wonderful; nay, Naturalists
affirm, Gesner. Topsall, p. 103. Pliny. Dioscorides. Solinus.
the whole Nature and Disposition of every part of this Beast to be good
against Poison, and venomous things; his Blood has excellent virtue in it.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ is exceeding lovely, and pleasant to look upon, tho not to
every Eye. Some cannot discern wherein the Hind resembles a Lion, a Horse, or a
Greyhound; this is known only to the curious Observer: So there are some that
see nothing lovely nor pleasant in Christ, think there is no Form nor
Comeliness in him; Isa. 53.2.
but a Believer, who has the Eyes of his Understanding enlightened, can clearly
discern a Loveliness and Amiableness in the Lord Jesus.

II. Jesus Christ has no Rancour of Spirit, retains no Envy or Indignation to
poor Sinners for Injuries done to him; he prayed for those that murdered him:
Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.

III. Jesus Christ greatly delights in the Melody of the Souls of sincere
Christians, in the well-tuned Instruments of their Hearts, who by fervent
Prayer can open their Case, and send forth the Desires and Breathings of their
Souls to him; such make sweet Music in his Ear: When they sing spiritual
Songs, and Hymns of Praise to him, with Grace in the Heart, he is exceedingly
delighted. Sing Praise unto the Lord, sing Praises.

IV. Jesus Christ is meek and humble in Spirit, and may rather be compared to a
Heart than Naphtali, whom Jacob says was as a Hind let loose, Genesis 49.21
giving goodly Words. Learn of me, for I am meek, Mat. 11.29
and lowly in heart, and you shall find Rest to your Souls.

V. Jesus Christ has so quick and sharp an Eye, that he can see into the very
Heart of a Man or Woman. All things lie naked and open to his Eyes. Heb. 4.13.
Day and Night are alike to him; he sees as well in Darkness as in the Light.
His Ears are always open to the Prayers of his Saints, he is quick in hearing
their Complaints.

VI. Jesus Christ dearly loves his People, all sincere Christians, and is
ready to help them, not only when they are in the Water, but in the Fire. Isa
43.2.
When thou passest through the Waters, I will be with thee, and through the
Rivers, they shall not overflow thee: When thou walk through the Fire, thou
shall not be burnt, neither shall the Flame kindle upon thee. Isa. 41.10, 13,
14.
-- I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my
Righteousness.

VII. Jesus Christ was very sociable in the days of his Flesh, he took delight
to be amongst poor Sinners, and great Multitudes flocked together to him. Prove.
8.31.
My Delight was with the Children of Men.

VIII. Jesus Christ was exceedingly chased, pursued, and hunted by wicked Men,
in the days of his Flesh, (as he is now in his Members.) No sooner was News
brought of his Birth, but Herod, that Fox, pursued him, (Blood-hound like) to
take away his blessed Life; many Dogs were (I may say) always at his Heels)
hunting him from one place to another: He was seldom quiet, or had rest whilst
on Earth; such was the Rage of the Devil against him, that old malicious Hunter.

IX. Jesus Christ (says Mr. Ainsworth) is ready to help his Church; Ainsworth
he is like an Heart for Swiftness. Some of the common Epithets expressing the
Qualities of this Creature, are (amongst the rest) these, nimble, agile, or
winged, as if he did rather fly than run; now for agility and swiftness none
like Christ; he is said to come leaping over the Mountains, and skipping over
the Hills, that is, over all Impediments that might hinder Good from his
People, whether it respect their Sins and Unworthiness, or the Opposition of
the World, and their and his Adversaries, Zach 4.7. Isa 40.4. and 41.15. Habak.
3.6
who are likened to a Mountain: Who art thou, O great Mountain, before
Zerubbabel? And every Mountain and Hill shall be made low.

X. So Christ ( pro sua Ecclesia certamina acria cum Diabolis and Morte
sustinuit) sustained sharp Encounters and Conflicts with the Devils and Sin,
for his Spouse, (the Church,) removing those Mountains that hid his Grace, and
separated him from her.

XI. Jesus Christ lodges his Children under his own Pavilion, he hides them in
the secret Place of the Almighty, or under the Wings of his Power, Love, and
gracious Protection, covering them with the Mantle of his pardoning Mercy. But
if Believers are stubborn and disobedient, kicking like an untamed Heifer, the
Lord Jesus in a way of Mercy beats them with the Rod, lays Afflictions upon
them, to humble them, and bring them to submit to his blessed Pleasure, and
causing them to be contented with their Condition. He teaches his Saints to
leap over all Opposition, or exercises them to use their Feet from the
beginning, how to improve their Graces, and learn Experiences so, that they may
escape the Danger of the Hunter, and keep clear off the Hounds before pursued.
And because he would every way secure and save them from Death, he acquaints
them where their Dens, Place or Places of Safety and sure Harbor are. Behold,
Exodus 33.21, 22.
there is a Place by me, and thou shall stand upon a Rock. -- I will put thee
in a Clift of the Rock, and will cover thee with my hand, etc.

XII. Jesus Christ, when pursued, and under the heavy pressure or weight of our
Sins, saw the great need he had of Help and Succor; and therefore it is said,
Heb. 5.7.
In the days of his Flesh he offered up Prayers, with strong Cries and Tears,
unto him that was able to save him from Death, and was heard in that he feared.
He accepted of Relief from the very Angels, who in his Distress showed their
readiness to comfort him.

XIII. There is an unreconcileable Enmity between Jesus Christ, and the old
Serpent, and his Race. Genesis 3.15.
I will put Enmity between thy Seed and her Seed, etc.

1. Jesus Christ knows all the Holes and lurking Places of the old, venomous,
and mischievous Serpents, and by his Spirit, and Breath of his Mouth, viz. the
Preaching of the Gospel, brings them out of the Hearts and Bodies of Men, that
he may dispossess, spoil, and destroy them.

2. Christ was hard beset with evil Spirits, his Enemies were numerous; the
Devil tempted him; Mat. 4.1, 2, 3, 4.
many with Serpentine Rage assaulting him, grievously annoyed him; and at last,
how did this venomous Offspring set upon him, and torment him in every part of
his Body, and cast Contempt upon all his Offices? and to this day, how does
Satan and his Instruments, twine about and annoy every Member of his Mystical
Body? But Christ, notwithstanding all their Rage, by humbling himself unto
Death, overcame them all. He spoiled Principalities and Powers, he made a show
of them openly, Col. 2.15. Genesis 3.15. 1 John 3.8.
triumphing over them in it. He shall bruise thy Head. -- To this end was the
Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the Works of the Devil.

XIV. Christus destr^^ens Diabolum vere sensit ardentissimum onus irae Dei in
se derivari, ande. When Christ came to destroy, break the Head of, or devour
the Serpent, (the Serpent as 'twas foretold, crushed or bit his Heel) he was
sensible that the heavy Wrath of God was upon him, insomuch that he sweat as it
were great Drops of Blood in the Garden; and when he was on the Cross, he cried
out, I thirst, and with a bitter Cry ran to the Fountain of all Fullness, My
God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?

XV. Christus post mortem ubi resurrexit, etc. Christ being slain, or after his
Death and Resurrection, sitting at the right hand of the Eternal Father,
retains mighty Efficacy in himself against the old Serpent, and all the Venom
of Sin. A Man that has on him the Robe of his Righteousness, cannot be hurt or
devoured by the Devil. The Virtue of his Horn of Power is infinite, whether
respecting the Power of his Grace to help his Church, or the Power of his Anger
to destroy his Enemies. The whole and every part of Christ is excellent against
Satan, and the Poison of Sin; the Example of his Life, his Death, Resurrection,
Intercession; his Word, Spirit, Gospel, and Grace, powerfully expel it. The
Virtue of his Blood is admirable, it heals all Diseases of the Soul, makes
Atonement, and cleanses us from all Sin. 1 John 1.^^.


Metaphor.
I. THe Heart is but a weak Creature in comparison of Lions, Elephants, etc. and
cannot save himself from his Enemies.

II. The Heart is a very timorous and fearful Creature, will run as being
affrighted, when no danger approaches.

III. An Heart is, as Naturalists tell us, Pliny, lib. 8. p. 21 3.
an envious Creature, is loath to part with that which is good for others; when
he has cast his Horn, he hides it in the Earth, so that it is hard to find it;
and is unkind to such of its own kind as are wounded.

IV. The Heart, tho he lives long, and is famous for length of Life, yet dies at
last as well as other Creatures.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ excells all in strength, all the mighty Monarchs of the Earth,
and Powers of Hell and Darkness, are nothing in his hand: I have laid Help upon
one that is mighty.

II. Jesus Christ is void of all Fear, his Courage is beyond the fearless
Courage of a Lion, flies from no Enemies, etc.

III. Jesus Christ is ready to part with any thing that will do poor Sinners
good. He left his Kingdom, the Bosom of his Father, and shed his precious Blood
for our sakes; He gives all things that are good both for Body and Soul. He
envies not our Happiness, and is exceeding merciful to poor wounded Sinners.

IV. Jesus Christ, tho he once died, yet dies no more: Death has no more
Power over him. He ever lives to make Intercession for us.



Inferences.
1. FRom the Enmity of the Heart to Serpents, which our Parallel shows to be
true of Christ in a spiritual sense, we may infer, That the eternal Ruin, Romans
16.20.
and final Overthrow of the Devil, and his cursed Offspring, is at hand; he
will tread them down under his Feet shortly.

2. Moreover, from hence we may infer further Terror to the Enemies: Christ's
quick and piercing Eye sees all their secret Abominations, pries into their
Cabals, and close Councels; and as he sees what Mischief and Violence is
hatching by them. so he is swift-footed, will soon skip over all Mountains, and
with his direful Vengeance confound them.

3. Besides this, we may learn from hence what Fools many Men are; whilst they
pursue after the poor Heart, they study not the way to hunt for this spiritual
Venison. Jesus Christ is worth the Chase; who would not hunt for such an Hind?

4. Let Saints be comforted, Christ has Hind's Feet; He will soon get over all
Difficulties, and deliver them.

Lastly; Let us pray with the Church, Make haste, my Beloved, and be thou like
a Roe, Cant. 8.14
or a young Heart, upon the Mountain of Spices.

Christ a Door,
John 10.9. (...), -- I am the Door, etc.


AMongst the many Metaphors that our Blessed Savior is expressed by in the
Holy Scripture, certainly this of Door must carry some Emphasis and
Signification, for Use and Improvement; otherwise He that was wiser than
Solomon, and spoke as never Man spoke, (for excellency of Matter and Form)
would never have likened himself to a Door. And therefore whatever may be
imagined concerning a Door, in point of Excellency and Usefulness, in respect
of Appointment and Necessity to the Children of Men, according to the Scope of
the Text, that (even that) by way of Eminency is the Son of God unto Sinners.
For the better understanding of which, we shall distinctly consider the
Subject, and run the Parallel as follows.

Metaphor.
I. A Door is of the same substance with some part of the House, to which it is
purposed or intended as an useful Part.

II. A Door is fitted, by the Power and Wisdom of him who is concerned to do
it, for a premised End.

III. A Door is set a part or assigned to a proper Place and Service, which
other parts of a House are not fit for.

IV. A Door is of necessity; who can be without it, that is of human Race,
whose dwelling is with Men?

V. A Door is as really the Propriety of the Owner of the House, as any other
part or parts of the House besides.

VI. A Door lets into possession; if Men hire or purchase, and take possession,
the Door is the Entrance thereto.

VII. A Door is under the Command of the Master that owns it; it is he that
shuts and opens it at his own pleasure.

VIII. A Door is the place of legal Entrance; no Men are allowed by Law to
climb up to Windows, or break down any part of the Walls for entrance.

IX. A Door is the common Passage for the Family and Strangers, for Children
and Servants, for Friends and Enemies.

X. A Door is of use to all, even to Emperors and Kings, as well as meaner Men
and Cottagers.

XI. A Door is not only for the convenient Entrance of Men and Women, whether
of the Family or not, but for the bringing in of other things, that the Master
likes of, and requires to be brought in.

XII. By the Door admittance is given to view the inward Excellencies of the
House; who can see what there is within, if they are without the door?

XIII. A Door lets into the best Parts and Privileges of a House; into the
Dining Room for Meat, into the Cellar for Drink, into the Wine-Cellar for Wine,
into the Wardrobe for Clothes, into the Treasury for Cash, into the Closet for
Books, etc.

XIV. The Door is the Privilege-place for the Poor, where they often meet with
good Gifts and Refreshments.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ, the Spiritual Door, was of the same substance in respect of
his human Nature, that Men are, even like to them in all things, Sin only
excepted. In as much as Children are Partakers of Flesh and Blood, Heb. 2.14.
he himself took part of the same; therefore very often in Scripture called a
Man.

II. Jesus Christ is fitted by the Power and Wisdom of Him, who has laid a
most worthy Platform and Contrivance, and premiseth all things to his own most
wise and admirable Ends. Gal. 4 4. Heb. 10.5.
He sent forth his Son made of a Woman. A Body have thou prepared me.

III. Jesus Christ is sanctified, or set apart by God the Father, 1 Timothy 2.5
to be a Mediator and Savior, which no other besides himself is fit for: Joh.
10.36
Whom the Father has sanctified (or set apart) and sent into the World. And
there is no Name under Heaven given, Acts 4.12.
by which Men can be saved, but by him.

IV. Jesus Christ is of such absolute necessity, that none can be happy without
him, that have immortal Souls to save. Whosoever finds me, finds Life, and
shall obtain favor of the Lord. He that hates me loves Death. Except ye
believe that I am he, ye shall (abide without, viz.) die in your Sins. Prove.
8.35* 36. Joh. 8.24.


V. Jesus Christ is truly and really God's Propriety, as the Church, and each
particular Believer, or Member thereof; therefore in Scripture is called his
own Son. All is yours, ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's. Rom 8.32 1 Cor.
3.23


VI. Jesus Christ has the Honor and Office of letting all true Believers into
the possession of that eternal Inheritance purchased by his own Blood for them;
'twas he that gave the poor Thief entrance into Heaven, Luke 23.43.

VII. Jesus Christ is under the Command of God the Father, as Man; and he
receives in, and shuts out, according to his pleasure; acts even so, and speaks
even so, as he receives Commandment from the Father.

VIII. Jesus Christ is the legal way of Entrance, whether into the visible
Church, or into the Kingdom of Heaven. Whosoever shall attempt to enter into
either of these, otherwise than by Christ, will be looked upon as Thieves and
Robbers.

IX. Jesus Christ is the common Passage to the Mercy of God, Joh. 10.1.
to the Privilege of Children, to the Fellowship of the Sheep, and to eternal
Life; all are admitted through him: No Man comes to the Father, but by me.

X. Jesus Christ is useful to all, Joh. 14 6.
even to Emperors and Kings, to mean Men and Cottagers; none of them can by any
means deliver his Brother, or give to God a Ransom for him, etc. Riches profit
not in the day of Wrath. Psalm. 49.7, 8.
He is the only Savior of all Men that are saved; neither is their Salvation
in any other. Acts 4.12.


XI. Jesus Christ is not only for the acceptance and entrance of Men and Women
to God the Father, but for the acceptance of their Works and Services, as
Prayer, Thanksgiving, etc. Their Services and Performances are accepted in and
through the Beloved, as well as their Persons: Thy Prayers and Alms are come
up. Acts 10.4.


XII. Jesus Christ gives an inspection into the Excellencies of the Father, and
the World to come: For no Man has seen the Father, save the Son, and he to
whom the Son reveals him. 2 Timothy 1.10.
'Twas He that brought Life and Immortality to light through the Gospel. How
can we see things that are within the Vail, but by and through Christ? Who was
it told us of a Kingdom above, and an immortal Crown, sitting upon Thrones, and
walking in white Robes, but Christ? It Is he that opens to the Holy of Holies,
where the King sits in Majestic Glory.

XIII. Jesus Christ lets the Souls of Men into the best Parts and Privileges of
Heaven, of Glory, and Blessedness it self. It Is through him they come to the
King's great Feast, to the Waters of Life, the Streams of that River that makes
glad the City of God. Psalm. 46.4.
It Is through him they come into the King's Wine-Cellar, to drink of the Wines,
the refreshing Influences of the Spirit, the precious Promises, the
Consolations of God, which are not small. 2 Pet. 1 4.
It Is through him that Men have an imputed Righteousness for a Wedding Garment,
the white Robes, that render all fair, and without spot or wrinkle, or any such
thing. It Is through Him, that Men receive Riches and Treasures of Grace, to
help in time of Need. It Is through Him that we come by that excellent Book,
which informs about all Affairs, and gives a true and full account of that
Estate which belongs to us in the World to come. It is through Him that all
things are enjoyed, whether Grace here, or Glory hereafter. Joh. 20.31 Act.
10.43. Act. 13.38. Romans 5.1. Ephesians. 2.7.
All are yours, you are Christ's. Life is through his Name, Remission of Sins
through him, eternal Life through him, Justification through him, Riches of
Grace and Glory through him.

XIV. Jesus Christ is the Door where the Poor have privilege to come without
molestation or control; here they meet with Relief; they never come and lose
their Labor. As he calls, so he gives when they come, and the best sort of
Alms too, the Bread of Life, the Water of Life; He gives Help and Healing, as
well as Bread and Nourishing; Mal. 4.2.
the Deaf receive their Hearing, the Dumb their Speech, the Blind their Sight,
etc. It Is through this Door God's bountiful hand is stretched forth, to
disperse abroad to them that are in Necessity. Blessed are they that wait at
the Posts of this Door. Prove. 8.34.




Corollaries.
1. HEre is Wisdom and Goodness appears on God's part, in making such an
useful, convenient, and necessary Door.

2. Here is great encouragement for all to seek, to find, especially the Poor,
and them that have a real mind to be happy.

3. Here is the Folly of them discovered that slight it, and the Misery of all
that miss it; they lose Heaven, and all its Privileges.

Christ the Servant of God.
Isa. 42.1. Behold my Servant whom I uphold, etc.

Isa. 19.6. Is it a light thing that thou should be my Servant? etc.


CHRIST is in these Scriptures called a Servant.

Metaphor
I. A Servant is one chosen to Office. If Men have Work or Business to do, they
choose one to be their Servant, whom they think fitly qualified, and able to do
it.

II. A Servant is a Name of Subordination and Subjection, it respects an Office
of an inferior Rank and Quality.

III. A Servant is one that has a Trust committed to him, by a Master or
Superior, to whom he is to be accountable.

IV. A Servant is oftentimes employed to labor, and hard Work, as to plow and
sow, build and plant, etc.

V. A Servant is not to seek his own Glory, nor to do his own Will, no further
than it comports or agrees with the Glory and Will of his Master or Father, but
does every thing that is commanded him, not being ashamed to acknowledge himself
to be a Servant.

VI. A Servant is sent sometimes abroad to do Business, far from home, and is
thereby exposed to many Dangers, and great Hardships.

VII. A Servant that is faithful, delights to do his Father's or Master's
Business, preferring it above his Meat and Drink, as appeared by the Servant of
Abraham, Genesis ^^4.33
who would not eat nor drink before he had done his Errand.

VIII. A Servant that is faithful, will not go beyond his Commission in any
thing. Says God to Moses, Look that thou make them according to the Pattern
that I have showed thee in the Mount. Exo. 25.40
Exo. 40.16
Thus did Moses; according to all that the Lord commanded him, thus did he.

IX. A Servant has Right to Wages, and expects it, as the Desert of his Work;
as Jacob said, Give me my Wife, for my Days are fulfilled. He demanded his
Wife, after he had served seven Years for her.

X. It Is the Hope and Expectation of a Reward, that causes a Servant to go
through Difficulties and Hardships cheerfully; as it was in Jacob's case: As I
was in the Day, the Drought consumed me, and the Frost by Night; yet he served
seven Years for Rachel, and they seemed unto him but as a few Days, etc.

XI. A Servant is attended with Fear: Mal. 1.6.
If I am a Master, where is my Fear?

Parallel.
I. CHrist was chosen by the Father, not to one Office only, but to many, to be
a Mediator, King, Priest, and Prophet. Isa. 43.10.
Behold my Servant whom I have chosen. He was every way furnished and fitly
qualified for the great Work appointed for him. I have laid Help upon one that
is mighty: Psalm. 89.19
I have exalted one chosen out of the People.

II. Christ in his Humiliation was abased so low, as to be in subjection to the
Father: He made himself of no reputation, Phil. 2.6, 7
and took upon him the Form of a Servant. I have been amongst you as he that
serves. Luke 22.27


III. Christ has a great Trust committed to him: Genesis 41.41 and 55 57. Joh.
1.16. Col 1.19.
Is it a light thing that thou should be my Servant, to raise up the Tribes
of Israel? And as all the Treasures and Riches of Egypt were committed to
Joseph; so are all the Riches of Heaven, both of Grace and Glory, committed to
Christ: It pleased the Father, that in him should all Fullness dwell, Col. 2.3.
in whom are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge.

IV. Jesus Christ was employed in hard Work, viz. to redeem, and not only so,
Acts 20.28
but to build the Temple or House of God. Upon this Rock will I build my
Church. Mat. 16.18
Behold, the Man that is called the Branch, Zech. 6.12.
he shall build the Temple of the Lord. A Sower went out to sow, Mat. 13.2, 37.
this Sower is the Son of Man.

V. Jesus Christ, as God's Servant, sought not his own Glory. I honor my
Father. If any Man will do his Will, Joh. 8.49. Joh. 7.17, 18. Luke 22.42.
he shall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of my
self. He that speaks of himself, seeks his own Glory; but he that seeks
the Glory of him that sent him, the same is true, etc. Father, not my Will but
thy Will be done. Joh. 12.4^^ Joh. 15.10
He that sent me, gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should
speak. As I have kept my Fathers Commandments, etc.

VI. Jesus Christ, to do the Work of God as Mediator, was sent on a long
Journey, as far as it is from Heaven to Earth, and was thereby exposed to much
Difficulty, and great Hardships, from Men and Devils. He was persecuted from
place to place, his Life being often in jeopardy; Mat. 8.20.
he had nowhere to lay his Head; and was at last most basely betrayed, and put
to Death.

VII. The Lord Christ was most faithful. Tho he was a Son, Heb. 5.8. Joh. 4.34.
yet learned he Obedience by the things he suffered. My Meat is, to do the Will
of him that sent me, and to finish his Work. I delight to do thy Will, Psalm.
40.8. Luke 2.9*
O God. Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's Business?

VIII. The Lord Christ was faithful, in doing all things which God required of
him; he went not beyond his Commission, nor did he neglect any part of his
Work. He that God sent, Joh. 3.34.
speaks the Words of God, and I know that his Commandment is Life
everlasting. Joh. 12.50
Whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so speak I.
Heb. 3.2.
Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as Moses was faithful in all his
House.

IX. The Lord Jesus Christ has an absolute Right to a Reward for his Work's
sake. Psalm. 2.8.
Tho there is no Merit or Desert for the Works which Believers do, being
unprofitable Servants when they have done all; Isa. 52.13.
yet there is very great Merit and Worth in what Christ did. And the Father
will give him his Wages; he shall have his Wife, his Church, for whom he served
above fourteen Years; nay, He shall have the Heathen for his Inheritance, and
the uttermost Parts of the Earth for his Possession. Behold, Isa. 53.12.
my Servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very
high: I will divide him a Portion with the Great, and he shall divide the Spoil
with the Strong, because he has poured out his Soul unto Death. -- But we see
Jesus, Heb. 1.9.
who for suffering Death is crowned with Glory and Honor, etc.

X. The Lord Jesus Christ, having in his eye that eternal Advantage his Elect
should receive, and what Glory He, as Man, should be raised unto, as the Reward
of his Undertaking, went through all his Sorrows with much cheerfulness. Who
for the Joy that was set before him, Heb. 12.2.
endured the Cross, despised the Shame, and is set down at the right hand of
the Throne of God

XI. The Lord Jesus Christ was subject, whilst he was here in our Nature, in
the Form of a Servant, (at some time) unto Fear. He was made under the Law.
It Is said, He was troubled in Spirit, Heb. 5.7.
and was heard, in that he feared.



Metaphor.
I. A Servant and the Master are not essentially and inseparably one.

II. A Servant amongst Men has not an inseparable Interest in his Master's
Goods and Estate.

III. Servants among Men many times, through Temptation, prove unfaithful, and
deceive either Father or Master; yea, the best Servants of good Men have in
something or other miscarried.

IV. A Servant may be turned out of his Master's Service, and lose his Honor.

V. The Servant abides not in his Master's House for ever.

VI. A Servant differs from the Heir in Place, Dignity, and Privilege.

VII. Too many are oftentimes forced to become Servants, because they cannot
otherwise tell how to live.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ, although a Servant, is essentially one with the Father; the
Father, Son, and Spirit, are but the one everlasting and eternal God. I and my
Father are one. 1 John 5.7.
There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy
Spirit; and these three are inseparably one.

II. Christ has a full, a clear, and inseparable Interest in all that the
Father has: All mine are thine, Joh. 17.1^^.
and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.

III. It was impossible for Christ to be unfaithful, or disobey God his Father,
because he was without Sin, and Satan had nothing in him to fasten a Temptation
upon. Joh* 14.30


IV. The Lord Jesus Christ did not, could not displease his Father, and
therefore did not, nor could lose his Honor. Joh. 8.29.
I do always the things that please him.

V. Jesus Christ abides in the House of God for ever.

VI. Jesus Christ, tho he be called the Servant of God, Heb. 1.2.
yet is he his own beloved Son, and Heir of all things, by whom he made the
World. There is none in Heaven or Earth, that has greater Glory, Place, or
Privilege conferred upon upon him, than the Lord Jesus Christ. Heb. 15.8.


VII. Christ had no necessity of Nature laid upon him, to accept of the low
Place and Office of a Servant. He was not forced to it, because he could not
tell how to live without serving, he being infinitely happy in himself from
Eternity; but the Glory of his Father, and the dear Love he bore to the
Creature, even to poor lost Man, moved him to become a Servant; he did it
freely for our sakes, that we might be Lords.



Inferences.
I. WE may note from hence the wonderful Condescension of Jesus Christ; there
is nothing which sets forth his great Abasement for our sakes more than this;
what Grace is this! Does the Son of God, who is the Lord of Heaven and Earth,
become a Servant! He that thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, Phil.
2.6, 7 Joh. 13 4, 5
made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the Form of a Servant! The
Son of Man came not to be ministered to, but to minister.

Quest. But some may enquire, Whose Servant is Christ? etc.

1. He is God's Servant: Behold my Servant, etc.

Mat. 20 28
2. He is his Peoples Servant: The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but
to minister, and to give his Life for many.

II. Let us learn from him, hence-forward to humble our selves. Let the same
Mind be in you, Phil. 2 5.
that was also in Christ Jesus. Shall the Lord become a Servant? and shall the
Servant swell in Pride and Arrogance, and nothing content him but to be called
Lord; nay, and lord it over God's Heritage, whose Servants they ought to be, if
they would be Gospel Ministers. Surely Christ abhors him who calls himself the
Servant of Servants, whilst at the same time he exalts himself above All that
are called Gods.

III. If the Lord Christ became a willing, humble, laborious, and faithful
Servant for us, let us labor to be humble, faithful, and sincere Servants to
him: Joh. 15.8.
He has done all the hardest Work, and if any remain too hard for us, he
sticks not to set his hand to it. Thou have wrought all our Works in us, Isa.
26.12.
and for us.

IV. Let this teach us to follow his Example, and be Servants one to another: I
have given you an Example, that you should do as I have done to you; John
13.14, 15.
for this is acceptable to him.

V. Remember, it is an honorable, pleasant, and gainful thing, to be Christ's
Servant. Paul seems to glory more in it, than in his being an Apostle: Joh.
12.26
If any Man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my Servant
also be. If any Man serve me, him will my Father honor.

VI. This justly reproves such who are ashamed to be Christ's Servants, and to
bear Reproach and Infamy for his Name's sake, seeing he has not stuck to serve
them in denying himself, even to the ignominious Death of the Cross. Phil. 2.8.


Christ a Lion.
Revel. 5.5. (...), etc. Behold, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah has prevailed.


IN this Text Christ Jesus is expressed by the Metaphor of a Lion, whose Nature
and Properties are illustrated and applied in the following Parallel. The word
(...) is derived (...), which signifies to see, because of his acute Sight.

Metaphor.
I. A Lion (says Ainsworth) is a Kingly Beast, and as Topsall tells us, justly
styled by all Writers the King of Beasts.

II. The Lion is a Majestical Creature; Majesty (says one) sits in his very
Face: Which occasioned that Speech, That an Army of Hearts (which are timorous
Creatures) having a Lion to their Captain, were more terrible than an Army of
Lions with a Heart to their Captain.

III. The Lion is a very strong Creature: Out of the Strong (says Sampson)
came forth Sweetness. Judge. 14.14.


IV. The Lion is a very magnanimous Creature, and courageous Beast, and a great
Conqueror; he was used by the Ancients as an Hierogliphick to denote Dominion;
and it was counted ominous, if a Woman brought forth a Lion, Venning.
as signifying that Country to be subdued by Strangers. Hence the Adage,
Societas Leonum, the overruling Society.

V. The Lion coucheth down to take his Rest, and then is very still and quiet.

VI. The Lion is a very fierce, fearless, and terrible Creature, especially
when he is rouzed up, and provoked by an Enemy.

VII. A Lion has a terrible Voice; when he roareth, all the Beasts of the
Field tremble.

VIII. A Lion is sharp-sighted; his name (...) is derived of (...), a Greek
Verb, that signifies to see.

IX. The Lion seems to be a Creature much for Justice, and will retaliate to
others, according to the Nature of the Offense done. See the Metaphor where God
the Father is compared to a Lion.

X. A Lion marks those that have injured him, or abused or wronged his young
Ones, and will revenge it; as appears by diverse Passages mentioned by
Naturalists, one of which take as follows:

In Bangius, a Mountain of Thracia, there was a Lioness which had Whelps in her
Den, the which Den was observed by a Bear. The Bear one day finding the Den
unfortified, by the absence both of the Lion and Lioness, entered into the same,
and slew the Lions Whelps, afterward went away, and fearing Revenge, for
better security against the Lion's Rage, climbed up into a Tree, and there sat
as in a sure Castle of Defense. At length the Lion and the Lioness returned
both home, and finding their little Ones dead in their Blood, according to
natural Affection, became both exceeding sorrowful, to see them so slaughtered,
whom they loved; but searching out the Murderer by the foot, followed with
great Rage up and down, until they came to the Tree whereon the Bear was
ascended; and seeing her, looked both of them ghastly upon her, oftentimes
assaying to get up into the Tree, but in vain, being not endued with the Power
of climbing. Then the Male forsook the Female, leaving her to watch the Tree,
and he, like a mournful Father for the loss of his Children, wandered up and
down the Mountains, making great Moan and Sorrow, till at last he saw a
Carpenter hewing Wood, who seeing the Lion coming toward him, let fall his Ax
for fear; but the Lion came very lovingly toward him, fawning gently upon his
Breast with his Fore-feet, licking his Face with his Tongue. Which Gentleness
of the Lion the Man perceiving, he was astonished; and being more and more
embraced and fawned upon by the Lion, he followed him, leaving his Ax behind;
which the Lion perceiving, he went back, and made Signs with his foot to the
Carpenter, that he should take it up. But the Lion seeing the Man did not take
it up, he brought it himself in his Mouth, and delivered it unto him, and then
led him into his own Cave, where the young Whelps lay all imbrued in their own
Blood; and from thence to the Place where the Lioness did watch the Bear. They
making Signs, and looking up into the Tree where the Bear was, the Man
conjectured that that Bear had done this grievous Injury unto them; he
thereupon took his Ax, and hewed down the Tree near the Root, which being done,
the Bear tumbled down headlong, and the furious Beasts tore her all to pieces.
After this, the Lion conducted the Man to the Place and Work where he first
found him, without doing him the least violence or harm.

The Truth of this, and of the following Story, is not imposed upon the Reader;
yet finding it recorded by such credible and eminent Authors, (and in it self
probable) we thought fit to transcribe it, as serving to divert the Reader, and
illustrate the insensible Wisdom of God in his Works.

XI. As a Lion will revenge the Hurt and Injury done to him, and to his young
Ones, so he is ready to requite Kindnesses done to him; as appears by another
Passage, thus recorded by Historians:

One Andradus, having fled from his Master by reason of some hard Usage
received at his hands, by chance happened to take up his Lodging in a Cave,
which (unknown to him) was a Lions's Den; where when he had been a while, not
long before Night, the Lion came from Hunting, and having gotten a Hurt upon
his foot, he no sooner espied the trembling Man in this fearful Place, but he
comes gently unto him, stretching forth his foot, and making Moan, as tho he
desired Help. The Man took the Lion by the Paw, searched the Wound, pulled out
a Thorn, bound up his Foot, and gave him ease; which kind Office being
performed, was first of all requited with a daily portion of Provision, which
the poor Slave roasted in the Sun. After this the Man escaped, and got away;
and the Lion missing him made great Lamentation. But so it happened, he was no
sooner gone, but he was taken by some whom his Master had sent out to search
for him; and then, alas! there was no other way but Death, and no other Death
but to be torn in pieces by wild Beasts; for the Romans kept Beasts on purpose
upon that account. But it so fell out, that this Lion was took up before the
time came, and put into the Theater, who greedily rent in pieces such as were
thrown unto him; yet when this poor Slave, his old Friend, was cast in, he
forgot his Fury, and turned it into Fawning; by which the por Soul perceived
what Lion it was, and thereupon renewed his Acquaintance with him, to the
Admiration of all. The Matter being known, and related to them that that were
concerned, he had not only his Life, Topsall, p 366. (...) Gellius in his (...).
but the Lion also to wait upon him, who became a faithful Servant to him. Hic
est Leo Hospes Hominis, hic est Homo Medicus Leonis, was that which the People
would say, when they saw him lead along his Lion through the Streets: Here goes
the Lion which was the Man's Host, and there is the Man who was the Lion's
Physician.

XII. No Creatures love their Young (as you may percieve by the foregoing Story
in part) more than the Lions, which they further demonstrate in their Defense;
for they will receive many terrible Blows, Slashes, and Wounds, the one opening
the bleeding Body, and the other pressing the Blood out of the Wounds; standing
invincible, never yielding till Death, Topsall's History of (...) footed
Beasts, p. 363.
as if Death it self were nothing to them, (says the Historian) so that their
young Ones might be safe.

XIII. Lions are full of Clemency to them that prostrate themselves at their
feet; Corpora magnanimo satis est prostrasse Leon^^. Ovid.
they will not touch such as do (as it were) by submission humble themselves to
them.

XIV. Out of the dead Carcass of Sampson's Lion came forth Sweetness, as in his
Riddle.

XV. None can take away the Prey from an hungry Lion.

XVI. It Is affirmed, that if a Man be anointed all over with the Blood of a
Lion, S^^xtus. Topsa^^, p. 3^^7.
he shall never be destroyed by wild Beasts.

XVII. The Blood of a Lion (as Naturalists say) being rubbed or spread upon a
Canker or Sore, which is swelled about the Veins, will presently cure the Grief.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus is the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, King of the Kings
of the Earth.

II. Jesus Christ is full of Majesty. It may be truly said of him, that he
carries Majesty in his Face, Majesty in his Looks, Majesty in his Words,
Majesty in his Walking. Christ being our Captain, tho we are timorous
Creatures, is enough to oppose, scatter, and vanquish the most potent Army,
that ever the Prince of Darkness, or the God of this World, 1 Cor. 1.24.
could raise against them; his Looks and Words affright his Enemies.

III. Christ is the Power of God; He is a mighty Man, nay, Isa. 9.6. Isa. 62.1.
He is a mighty God, mighty to save.

IV. Christ is of superlative Courage, of an invincible Mind; for he never
encountered with any, but he was Conqueror. He subdued the Devil, yea, whole
Legions of them, and rode in Triumph through the Air. Col. 2.15.
He overcame the World, trampling it under his Feet. He conquered Sin, yea,
Death it self. The Woman bringing forth the Lion of the Tribe of Judah,
portended nothing less, than the Conquest of the Devil's Kingdom.

V. Christ appears in his Dispensations, for some time to couch down, as it
were; suffers himself to be abused (in his People) and seems to lie still, as
if he were asleep.

VI. Christ, when he is rouzed up by the Cruelties of the Enemies of his
Church, and the Cries of his People, will be very terrible; Isa. 41.25.
he will come upon Princes, as upon Mortar. Tho now he seems still and
peaceable, like a Lamb; yet the Day is at hand, when he will rise up like a
Lion, to destroy and devour at once.

VII. When Christ shall utter his Voice at the last Day, and come to Judgment,
he will make the Nations of the World quake. Zeph. 1.14
Let all the Inhabitants of the Earth tremble, for the Day of the Lord comes,
for it is nigh at hand. Joel 2.1. and 3.16.
The Lord shall also roar out of Zion, and utter his Voice from Jerusalem, and
the Heaven and Earth shall shake, etc.

VIII. There is nothing hid from the Eyes of Christ, he sees into the darkest
Corners of Men's Hearts and Imaginations; the most subtle Sinners cannot escape
his Notice. There is no secret Place, where the Plotters, or wicked Men, can
hide themselves from him; He sees all their horrid Designs and Combinations.

IX. Jesus Christ will reward every one according to the Nature of his Works,
in the great Day; and when he comes forth to judge Babylon, he will retaliate
upon her according as she has done. Thou have given them Blood to drink, Rev.
16.5, 6.
for they are worthy, for they have shed the Blood of thy Saints and Prophets.
Rev. 18.6.
Reward her as she has rewarded you.

X. Christ marks all those that injure him and his People. Wherefore does the
Wicked contemn God? he says in his Heart, Psalm. 10.13, 14.
he will not requite it. Thou have seen it, for thou beholdest Mischief and
Spite, to requite it with thy hand. 1 Samuel 15.2, 3.
I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, now go and smite Amalek. I will
contend with them that contend with thee, Isa. 49.25, 26.
and I will save thy Children: And I will feed them that oppress thee with
their own Flesh, and they shall be drunken with their own Blood, as with sweet
Wine.

XI. The Lord Jesus, as he avenges the Wrongs and Injuries done to his People,
so he will requite Kindnesses showed to them. Such as feed the Hungry, Mat.
25.38, 39.
cloth the Naked, visit the Sick, and those that are in Prison, for Christ's
sake, shall be rewarded: Their Work of Faith, Mat. 10.42
and Labor of Love shall not be forgotten; yea, He that gives but a Cup of
cold Water in the Name of a Disciple; shall not lose his Reward. Mark 9 41.
Which is a Reward of Grace, not Merit; for there is no proportion between
eternal Life, and the best of our Performances, yet God accepts of them.

XII. The Lord Jesus loves his People with such a strong and endeared Love,
that he did not only fight with cruel Enemies in their behalf, but freely also
received many Lashes and sore Wounds in his Body, and stood invincible, never
yielding till Death: He made his Soul an Offering for Sin. Yea, Isa. 53.
Death it self was nothing to him, so that he might save his poor Church from
Wrath, and eternal Misery.

XIII. The Lord Jesus is full of Clemency, Compassion, and Tenderness of Bowels
to all that humble themselves at his Feet. He resists the Proud, James 4.
(and will tear them in pieces) but gives Grace to the Humble.

XIV. Sampson's Riddle is unfolded best in the slain Body of the Lion of the
Tribe of Judah; from thence comes all the Honey, the Sweetness of Grace and
Glory.

XV. None can deliver themselves out of Christ's hand, when he rises up for the
Prey.

XVI. That Person, whosoever he be, who applies Christ's Blood by Faith, or
has every Faculty of his Soul, viz. the whole Man bathed therein, shall never
be destroyed by the Devil, nor the Powers of Darkness.

XVII. The Blood of Christ cures all Wounds, Cankers, and putrefying Sores of
the Soul, or inward Man, when applied by the hand of Faith.



Metaphor.
THe Lion is cruel, blood-sucking, proud, preying, stony-hearted, malicious, a
Devourer of Flocks and Herds, the very Tyrant of Beasts.

Disparity.
THe Lord Jesus is mild, merciful, tenderhearted, forgetting Injuries, the
Preserver and Savior of the innocent, poor, weak, and helpless Ones, etc.



Inferences.
1. LEt the Ungodly tremble, who think Christ Jesus will never appear as a
Lion, but always show himself in his Lamb-like Disposition. Christ is a Lion as
well as a Lamb, and will ere long rise up to the Prey.

2. What will become of the Murderers and Destroyers of his Church, in the Day
of his fierce Wrath, when he comes to make Inquisition for Blood?

3. O that Sinners from hence would learn to prostrate themselves at his feet!

4. This speaks much Comfort to the Godly; He is full of Bowels, and like a
Lion, able to defend and deliver them.

5. By Faith and Prayer let us strive to rouse up this Lion of the Tribe of
Judah, to tear in pieces all his implacable Enemies.

Christ the true Manna.
John 6.50. This is the Bread which comes down from Heaven, that a Man may eat
thereof, and not die.

Rev. 2.17. To him that overcomes, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna.


CHRIST, and the Graces of Christ, are called Manna, the Antitype of that Manna
that fell in the Wilderness, Exodus 16. Manna in Hebrew (...) Man, from (...)
Manah, preparare, to prepare, Cum ^^iderent Israelitae illam, quasi quandam
pruinam aut nivem circum castra passim jacere and albicare, quaesierint a se
invicem, (...) etc.
because it was Food prepared from Heaven for the Israelites in the Wilderness.

Flacc. Illyricus, and others, say, That when the Israelites saw it like
congealed Dew, Clav. Script. in vocem.

Hieron. Laurett. Sylva Alleg. etc.


or small Hail or Snow, lying up and down about the Camp, they asked one
another, (...) What Is that? what is that? And because of frequent Repetition,
that it might be more easily pronounced, they added the Letter (...), and
pronounced Manhu, whence they retain the word (...) Man, Manna.

midst of the Golden Candlesticks. Rev. 1.

See Christ the Bread of Life.

Christ a King.
Rev. 7.14. And the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Lord of Lords, and King
of Kings. See 1 Timothy 6.15. Rev. 19.16.


BY the Lamb is meant JESUS CHRIST, which is evident and indisputable; the
Dignity to which he is advanced is the highest among the Sons of Men,
Potentate, Son or Man of Power, King of Kings, etc. There is no higher Name or
Title to set forth Dignity amongst Men, than Kings or mighty Potentates. It Is
one of the Titles of the Most High, the God of this Blessed Lamb, and indeed it
originally belongs to him, but he is pleased to bequeath it unto Men, for which
reason they are called Gods on Earth: I said ye are Gods, but you shall die
like Men, and fall like the mortal Princes. God is in the Congregation, He
judges among the Gods. This King, invisible, immortal, the only wise God, has
chosen a Vicegerent to represent him to his Subjects, has placed his Name in
him, not only Wonderful Counselor, and the Man that is his Fellow, but as
King, the chief of Titles in this lower World. By this the Royal and most
renowned Branch, that ever sprang from the Loins of Jesse and David, is set
forth. Upon which we note, That JESUS, the Lamb of God, is compared to, and
represented by the most magnificent Title of King, the highest and chiefest of
Kings. And indeed there is nothing does more fully set forth the Glory, Power,
and Splendour of Christ, than this; as will appear, if we consider these
following Particulars.

Metaphor.
I. A King is usually very highly descended, comes to his Dignity by
Inheritance, is the Son of a Noble.

II. A King has, or ought to have great Qualifications, having the advantage
of such Education; to his natural Wisdom is added Skill in Politic Affairs,
even the Knowledge of the Laws of his Kingdom.

III. Kings are sometimes chosen or appointed, as Solomon was by David his
Father, 1 Kings 1.32, 33, etc.
or as Alexander by Philip his Father; or else by the People, as was David, 2 Samuel 5.
and many others.

IV. Kings are anointed as well as chosen. Samuel anointed Saul. 'Twas a Divine
Ceremony, much in use at the consecrating of Kings in the Kingdom of Israel.

V. Kings are proclaimed at their Instalment. Samuel said to all the People, 1 Samuel 20.24.
See him whom the Lord has chosen: And all the People gave a Shout, and said,
God save the King.

VI. A King, after he is anointed and proclaimed, enters upon his Government.

VII. Kings (de jure) have a Palace by Right belonging to them, whether they
are in immediate possession or not.

VIII. Kings have great Attendants belonging to their Courts, tho they be not
visible in all parts of their Dominions.

IX. Kings are invested with Power; they have sometimes some of them less at
the first entrance upon their Kingdom, than afterward; as David's was, who had
but two Tribes at his entrance.

X. Kings have many Subjects, who subscribe to their Power.

XI. Kings have Laws and Rules to govern by.

XII. Kings, tho they rule well, are not loved and honored by all, are often
troubled with Rebels, and Sons of Belial.

XIII. Great Kings have large Dominions, as Nebuchadnezzar, the Golden Head,
who was over an hundred and twenty seven Provinces.

XIV. Kings have a Prerogative in their own Dominions, to make Peace and War
when they please.

XV. Kings have a Crown to wear, a Scepter to wield, and a Throne to sit upon.

XVI. Kings have the Privilege of a Grand Council, to advise with in Matters of
Importance.

XVII. Kings have the Privilege and high Prerogative of sending Ambassadors, to
treat with States and Kingdoms about Affairs of Public Good.

XVIII. A King ordains and constitutes Officers, or makes Substitutes, to whom
he does delegate Power to execute his Will and Laws to all his Political Body.

XIX. Kings do vouchsafe Security and Protection to their Subjects (sometimes,)
by good Counsel, and eminent Acts of Providence.

XX. Kings have Courts of Judicature, both high and inferior, for the
Punishment of Offenders, according to their Rank and Degree.

XXI. Kings have many and great Prerogatives, Rights, Privileges, and
Excellencies pertaining to them; as to receive Petitions, and pardon Offenders;
to confer Honor, and give Commissions; to have Tribute paid, and keep an
Exchequer; to shut out and scatter wicked Persons, and thereby become a Terror
to them that do evil, Rom 13.
and a Praise to them that do well.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus Christ, our great King, comes to this Dignity by Birth; he
is eldest Son to a mighty Emperor, and so right Heir to Kingship: When he
brings the First-begotten into the World, etc. Heb. 1.6. Col. 1.15.
He is the Firstborn of every Creature, and thereby Heir of all things. He
has by Inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they, Heb* 1.4.
(viz. the Angels.)

II. The Lord Jesus Christ has glorious Qualifications. He is not only endued
with natural Wisdom, and that far beyond Solomon, Mat. 12.42
(A greater than Solomon is here); but has had the Advantage also of such
Education that none ever had, being brought up with God himself. He has all
the Treasures of Wisdom in him, Prove. 8.
is skilled in all Politics, has knowledge in all Laws; nothing passes his
Skill: Joh. 21.17
Thou know all things. He is called the Wisdom of God: Christ, the Power of
God, and the Wisdom of God. 1 Cor. 1.24


III. Jesus Christ was chosen to be King by God the Father, as it is said, Psalm.
89.19
I have exalted one chosen out of the People. And tho the Fathers or Elders
amongst the Jews refused him, yet the Children gave their Vote for him, crying,
H^^sannah to the Son of David.

IV. Jesus Christ was anointed with the Oil of Gladness above his Fellows.
Psalm. 43 7.
He was by the Holy Spirit consecrated King for ever: The Spirit of the Lord is
upon me, because the Lord has anointed me, etc. Isa 61.1.^^


V. Jesus Christ was likewise proclaimed; first, by the Angels, Luke 2.11.
To you is born in the City of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord:
Afterward by the Wise Men, at Jerusalem, and at Herod^^s Court; by a Star, and
by the Shepherds at Bethlehem.

VI. This did Jesus Christ in three eminent Cases: 1. In speaking comfortably
to all his Loyal Subjects, as you may see in Mat. 5. at large. 2. In giving
Laws, and expounding Difficulties, as you may see in Mat. 6. at large. 3. In
bestowing his Bounty upon the Poor, releasing Prisoners that were bound, and in
appointing an Hospital for the Sick.

VII. Jesus Christ has a Right to the highest Palaces in this World, as he was
born Heir to the Universal Emperor, by whom he was at last advanced to the
great Palace of the highest Heavens, called the holy Palace.

VIII. Jesus Christ our great King, had the Attendance of Angels, who showed
their Allegiance, and paid their Homage and Service at sundry times, as there
appeared Occasion for them.

1. They proclaimed him. 2. They attended his Person, to assist him in his
Straits. 3. They assisted his other Servants. 4. They declared his Resurrection
from the Dead. 5. They assured his coming in Glory after his Ascension. 6. They
are appointed to bear him company, and to attend him at his coming from Heaven
the second time. The Son of Man shall come, and all the holy Angels with him.
Mat. 25 31*


IX. Jesus Christ is invested with Power, All Power is given to me in Heaven
and Earth; Mat. 28.18
tho at the first entrance upon his Kingdom, in the days of his Flesh, his
Power did not appear so splendent and glorious, as it will hereafter.

X. Jesus Christ has many Subjects assigned him by God, which subscribe to his
Power: Some voluntarily, as the Angels; others by force, as the Devils; and by
virtue of his commanding Power, as the Winds and Seas, which obeyed him.

XI. Jesus Christ received Commandment from the Father, from which he would
never swerve; and also published and established Laws, to be observed as Rules
of Government to the end of the World. Mat. 28.18, 19, 20.


XII. Jesus Christ rules and governs so well, that his worst Enemies could not,
cannot charge him with Evil; yet they did not, do not love and honor him; but
the Sons of Wickedness rose up, and still do rise up in Rebellion against him:
I honor my Father, but you dishonor me, Joh. 8.40.
a Man which has told you the Truth, this did not Abraham. Bring out those
mine Enemies, etc. Luke 19.27


XIII. Jesus Christ has great and large Dominions, all Power in Heaven, Earth,
and Hell. Ephesians. 1.25. Col. 1.18, 19. Rev. 1.18.
He is the Head of all Principalities and Powers in Heaven, he is the Head of
every Man on Earth, and has the Command of all the infernal Spirits in Hell.

XIV. Jesus Christ has this great and high Prerogative, to make Peace, or to
proclaim Peace to all the Sons of Men upon Submission; and to send a Sword,
where his just Prerogative is resisted. In whatsoever House ye enter, first
say, Peace, Luke 10.5, 6.
if the Son of Peace be there, etc. I came not to send Peace, but a Sword.

XV. Jesus Christ, Heb. 2.9.
that was made a little lower than the Angels, for the suffering of Death, is
crowned with Glory and Honor, etc. The Scepter of thy Kingdom is a right
Scepter. As I have overcome, Rev. 3.21.
and sat down with my Father upon his Throne.

XVI. Jesus Christ has the Father and Holy Spirit, without whose Counsel he
acts nothing, either in the Affairs of Heaven, Earth, or Hell. There are
three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit; and
these three are one. 1 John 5.7.
Of this Council Offenders are in danger, and to this Council grand Criminals
are delivered up for Punishment.

XVII. Jesus Christ has the peculiar Prerogative to send Ambassadors. He sent
the twelve Apostles to the World, who said, We are Ambassadors for Christ. 2
Cor. 5.20
And He sent his Angel to the Churches, to treat with them about their present
and eternal Welfare: Rev. 22.16
I Jesus have sent mine Angel, etc.

XVIII. Jesus Christ makes Substitutes to this end. By him Kings reign, and
Princes decree Justice: By him Princes rule, Prove. 8.15, 16.
and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth; these for the World. Ephesians 4.9, 10
And when he ascended up on high, he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and
some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for his Church; by this,
showing that He is supreme Head in all Causes, Ecclesiastical as well as Civil.

XIX. Jesus Christ saved the Gospel Church before the Destruction of Jerusalem,
by giving them counsel to fly upon the sight of Signs; and the Legal Church in
the Wilderness, by the convenient Providence of a Pillar of Fire by Night, and
a Pillar of a Cloud by Day. He was the Angel of God's Presence that saved them,
and marvellously has he, and does he now save and preserve his Church from
Popish Rage and Cruelty, in this and other Nations.

XX. Jesus Christ has a high Court of Judicature in Heaven, where he judges
Emperors and Kings, that are out of the power and reach of a human Hand; from
whence he sends Angels, who are higher than they, to punish them for Pride and
Oppression; as in the Case of Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 4.13. Act. 12.23
who was by the holy Ones cast from his Throne; and Herod, who was smitten by
an Angel for his Pride: And a lower Court, where his Church, for him, and in
his Name, judges Delinquents of a lower Rank.

XXI. Jesus Christ has many great Prerogatives, Rights, Privileges, and
Excellencies pertaining to him. 1. He receives Petitions: Lord Jesus, Act. 7.59.
receive my Spirit. 2. He pardons Offenders: The Son of Man has Power to
forgive Sins. Mat. 9.6.
3. He confers Honor: I thank Christ Jesus, who has put me into the Ministry.
1 Timothy 1.12
4. He gives Commissions: Go ye into all the World. 5. He receives Tribute: The
honorable Women ministered unto him not without reason, for he was Lord of all.
6. He keeps an Exchequer, called the unsearchable Riches of Christ. 7. He shuts
evil Persons out of the Church, Ephesians. 3.8.
as he served Judas, and will shut them out of the new Jerusalem at the last
Day. He scatters Wickedness by his Laws and Doctrine of Holiness. He takes care
of his Subjects, and smites those that persecute his Church. He is a Praise to
all them that do well, and much more will be, when he advances his Saints to
be Rulers over many Cities, and sets them upon Thrones; and he pronounces the
Sentence, Well done, good and faithful Servant, enter into the Joy of thy Lord.



King.
I. THe Kings of the Earth do not create their Subjects.

II. The Kings of the Earth are naturally weak, and many ways defective in
point of Qualification.

III. The Kings of the Earth are ordinarily made and instituted by Men.

IV. The Kings of the Earth have their Political Power, Strength and
Maintenance from their People.

V. Kings have their Power limited and confined to a certain part of the Earth.

VI. The Kings of the Earth may be overreached in their Politics, as Solomon
was by Women.

VII. The Kings of the Earth may alter from better to worse, and turn Tyrants,
as too many have formerly done.

VIII. The Kings of the Earth may be tossed from their Thrones, and have their
Kingdoms taken from them by an invincible Force, which they cannot withstand;
as in the Case of Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 4.31, 32.
and many others.

IX. The Kings of the Earth are mortal, and must die: I said ye are Gods,
Psalm. 82.7.
but you shall die like Men, and fall like one of the Princes.

Mors pulsat aequo pede pauperum Tabernas,
Regumque Turres. --
Horat. X. The Kings of the Earth, even the greatest and highest amongst them,
are but the Sons of Earth, earthly, very low and meanly descended, in
comparison of Christ.

XI. The best and greatest Honors and Favors the Kings of the Earth can
confer on Men, are temporal and fading.

XII. The Kings of the Earth, in their Execution of Wrath, and taking Revenge,
can but hurt and kill the Bodies of their Enemies; the Soul is out of their
reach.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ, the King of Kings, created his Subjects, both Angels and Men:
Whether they be Principalities or Powers, Things in Heaven, Col. 1.16.
or Things on Earth, all Things were made by him, and for him.

II. Jesus Christ has more than the Strength of an Unicorn, is called the Lion
of the Tribe of Judah, has all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge, yea, Col.
2 3.
all Fullness.

III. Christ is a King made and set up immediately by God himself, who has made
him higher than the Kings of the Earth, Psalm. 2.6.
and set him King for ever upon the holy Hill of Zion. He has exalted one
chosen out of the People.

IV. Christ's Riches and Strength are of and from himself. He that has the
Power of the Godhead dwelling bodily in him, needs not Strength or Maintenance
from others.

V. Jesus Christ is Lord of all, has all Power in Heaven and Earth committed
to him. He has an unlimited Power. Angels and Principalities are subject to
him; he is set up over all the Works of God's hands.

VI. Jesus Christ is the Wisdom of God, and could not be circumvented by great
Beelzebub, who is the most subtle Politician; all his mysterious Stratagems
were to Him, but as the Cords of Tow to Sampson, in the Mightiness of his
Divine Strength. This great Captivity Jesus led captive; Col. 2.15.
and having spoiled Principalities and Powers, he made a show of them openly,
and was with a most Majestic Triumph attended to his Throne in Heaven.

VII. But Jesus Christ being naturally and essentially good, abides immutably
so, is the same yesterday, to day, Heb. 13.8.
and for ever.

VIII. But Jesus Christ is for ever set down at the right hand of God, upon the
Throne of his Excellency, and there will continue till the end of Time, till
all his Enemies shall be made his Footstool. He will overthrow the Dragon with
all his Infernal Force, so that there shall be no more Place found for them,
Rev. 12.
and in a short time will swallow up Death in Victory: The last Enemy that
shall be destroyed is Death. 1 Cor. 15.


IX. But Jesus Christ, being raised from the Dead by the Glory of his Father,
dies no more, Death has no more dominion over him. I am he that was dead, and
am alive; and behold, I live for evermore, Rev. 1.18.
and have the Keys of Death and Hell. To Him it is said, Thy Throne, O God,
Heb. 1.8.
is for ever and ever; a Scepter of Righteousness is the Scepter of thy Kingdom.

X. Jesus Christ is highly descended, the immediate Offspring of God, greater
in point of Pedigree than all the Sons of Nobles, called in Scripture the Man
of God's Right Hand, his Fellow. Psalm. 80.17 Phil. 2.6. 1 Cor. 15.47.
He thought it no Robbery to be equal with God. The second Man Adam is the Lord
from Heaven. Therefore truly called the Lord of Glory: Had they known him, 1
Cor. 2.8.
they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.

XI. But Jesus Christ, the King of Heaven, can confer Honors, and enrich with
such Favors, as are everlasting: With him are durable Riches, and
Righteousness. He has promised a Crown which never fades away. 2 Timothy 3.8


XII. But the Lord Jesus can destroy both the Bodies and Souls of Men, Mat.
10.28
whether Kings, or mighty Ones of the Earth, that are his Enemies; and make
them cry out to the Rocks to fall on them, Rev. 6.16.
and to the Mountains to cover them, and hide them from the Wrath of the Lamb,
who can cast the Dragon, the Beast, and the false Prophet, with all their
Adherents, into the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone.



Inferences.
I. FRom hence we may plainly see the clear and undoubted Right which the Lord
Jesus Christ has to all the Works of God's hands. 1. By his great Descent, he
is the natural Son of God: The Word was with God, and the Word was God; and,
Being in the Form of God, thought it no Robbery to be equal with God; called,
the Man that is God's Fellow. 2. He is qualified; 3. He is chosen; 4. Anointed;
5. Proclaimed. All which may challenge a Right to a Regal Power.

II. From hence we infer the undoubted Duty of all, (both Angels and Men) to
obey him. Emperors, Kings, Princes, Nobles, and all the Judges of the Earth,
owe Homage and Service to him, therefore commanded to k^^ss the Son, etc.

Psalm. 2.12.
III. From hence we infer the good and happy State of all his Friends and
Favorites; He both can and will do great things for them, gives great things
unto them, saves them from Sin, Death, and the Devil: He will invest them with
a Kingdom, a Crown, a Throne, and unspeakable Glory: 1 Cor. 2.9.
Which Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard, neither has it entered into the Heart
of Man to conceive, the Things which God has laid up for those that love him.

IV. Moreover, from hence we may infer, what the sad and miserable State of his
Enemies will be without Repentance, and the Necessity of their Submission to
Him, even Emperors, Kings, Princes, Nobles, Captains, Armies, Freemen, Bondmen,
even all both small and great. He has Power to punish all Treasons,
Rebellions, Affronts, Misdemeanors, and Indignities whatsoever. All that will
not hear and obey him, shall be destroyed. He will speak to them in his Wrath,
and vex them in his sore Displeasure. Psalm. 2 5.
His Enemies shall be clothed with Shame. All that hate him shall be
confounded, and fly before him. They shall be like the Dust, how great soever.
They shall call for the Rocks to fall on them, and to the Mountains to cover
them, Rev. 6.16.
from the Face of him that sits upon the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb.

V. From hence we are taught to observe, That it is our Duty,

1. To adore, reverence, and honor Him.

2. To obey and keep his Law.

3. To trust in Him only for Defense and Protection.

4. To pray, that He would take to him his great Power, and reign. O blessed
Son of David, King of the Jews, King of Israel, Lord of the Gentiles, Governor
of Nations, and King of Kings, thy Kingdom come, that thy Will may be done in
Earth as it is in Heaven.

VI. From hence we infer the happy State that the whole Universe shall be in,
in God's appointed Time, when this good, great, and mighty Potentate shall take
to him his great Power, and obtain a full Possession of all his Right. When the
Heavens shall rain down Righteousness, and out of the Earth shall spring forth
Joy: The Mountain's shall drop new Wines, and the Hills shall flow with Milk.
Is^^. 61.11.
The Light of the Moon shall be as the Light of the Sun, and the Light of the
Sun as the Light of seven Days. The Heavens shall rejoice ever us, and drop
Fatness; the Weary shall be at Rest, and break forth into Singing. A Jubilee
shall be proclaimed, and Persecution no more heard. Judgment shall run down
like Water, and Righteousness like a mighty Stream. Every Man shall sit under
his own Vine, and under his own Fig Tree, and none make him afraid. Peace to
all the Ends of the Earth. Swords beaten into Plowshares, and Spears into
Pruning Hooks; no Nation lifting a Sword against his Neighbor, no levying War
any more. No more Earthquakes, nor Famine, but a fruitful and peaceable Earth.
The poor Man shall overtake the Reaper, and the Treader of Grapes him that
sows Seed: And the Mountains shall drop sweet Wines, and the Hills shall
melt. The Captivity of Israel shall be brought again, they shall build the old
waste Places, and plant Vineyards, and drink the Wine thereof, make Gardens,
and eat the Fruit thereof. Come to Zion with Songs, and everlasting Joy, where
this King shall sit, and appear in his Glory. Israel shall rejoice, and Judah
shall be glad. It shall fare well with the whole Creation: For the Ox and (...)
Ass, that ear the Ground, shall eat clean Provender, winnowed with Fan and
Shovel. The Effect of his Kingdom shall be Peace; for the Righteous shall
flourish, and have abundance of Peace, and the Fruit of its Righteousness and
Assurance for ever: For not only the People shall be all righteous, but upon
the Bells of the Horses there shall be, Holiness to the Lord. And the Ransomed
shall come to Zion, with everlasting Joy upon their Heads. They shall obtain
Joy and Gladness; and all Sorrow, Heaviness, Zech. 14.20.
and Sighing shall fly away: For as the Earth brings forth her Bud, and as
the Garden flourishes with Things that are sown in it; so shall the Lord God
ma^^ Righteousness and Praise spring forth before all the Nations. Blessed be
God.

Christ a Priest.
Heb. 7.17. For he testifies, Thou art a Priest for ever after the Order of
Melchisedec.

Verse. 26. For such an High Priest becomes us, who is holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens.


Type.
I. THe High Priest was taken from among Men, but it behoved him not to have
any Blemish. Lev. 22.17


II. The Priest assumed not to himself this Office, but was called to it of
God; Heb. 5.4. Number. 8.10
they were consecrated by Imposition of Hands, when they were twenty five Years
old.

III. The Priests were anointed with Oil, and washed with Water. Thou shall
take thee anointing Oil, Exodus 29.7 Lev. 16.4.
and pour it upon his Head, and he shall wash his Flesh in Water.

IV. The Priest was gloriously clothed: Exodus 28.2
Thou shall make holy Garments for Aaron thy Brother, for Glory and Beauty.

V. The Priest was to have a holy Crown upon his Head. Exodus 29 6


VI. The Priest's Body and Loins were to be covered with clean Linen.

VII. The High Priest bore the Names of the Tribes of Israel upon his Breast,
Exo. 28.29
when he went in before the Lord.

VIII. The High Priest had Vrim and Thummim upon his Breast.

IX. The High Priest had an engraven Plate of Gold: Thou shall make a Plate of
pure Gold, Exo. 28.36
and engrave upon it, like the engraving of a Signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD: Verse
38.
And it shall be upon Aaron's Forehead, that Aaron may bear the Iniquity of the
holy Things; and it shall always be upon his Forehead, that they may be
accepted before the Lord.

X. Aaron the Priest was Moses's Mouth to the People.

XI. The High Priest was not to marry a Widow, a divorced Woman, Lev. 21.14
nor an Harlot, but a chaste Virgin.

XII. The Priest's work was to offer Sacrifices for the Sins of the People:
Heb. 8.3.
For every High Priest is ordained to offer Gifts and Sacrifices, etc.

XIII. The Priest was to take the Blood of the Bullock, and dip his Finger in
it, Lev 16.14
and sprinkle seven times the Mercy-Seat, etc. and likewise the Blood of Calves
and Goats, and he sprinkled the Book, and all the People, the Tabernacle, and
the Vessels of the Ministry.

XIV. The Priest's Garments were to remain after him, to cloth and adorn his
Sons withal.

XV. The Priests were to sound the Trumpets, Moses and Aaron, p. 20. Numb. 10.
2 Chronicles. 29.22.
which (as Mr. Godwin observes) were twofold, sometimes an Alarm to War,
sometimes to assemble the People.

XVI. The Priests of the Lord were to teach the Law to the People: Mal. 2.7.
The Priest's Lips should keep Knowledge, and they should seek the Law at his
Mouth.

XVII. The Priest was to judge of the Plague of the Leprosy, and to pronounce
clean, or unclean.

XVIII. The Priests under the Law made and anointed Kings. 2 Chronicles. 23 9, 10, 11
Jehoiada the Priest, and his Sons, anointed Joash King of Judah.

XIX. The Priests were to appoint Officers over the House of God; and it did
not appertain to the Civil Magistrate to intermeddle in the Priest's Office.
See the Case of Vzziah, 2 Chronicles. 26.20.

XX. The Priests of the Lord were to bless the People.

XXI. The High Priest only went into the Holiest of all, and that not without
Blood, to make Atonement.

XXII. The High Priest only made the Perfume for Burnt-Offerings; and it might
not be applied to any other use, but to burn before the Lord.

XXIII. The Death of the High Priest set the guilty Person, or Manslayer free,
who had fled to the City of Refuge: After the Death of the High Priest, Number* 5
28
the Slayer shall return to the Land of his Possession. By the High-Priest's
Death an Atonement was made for him, says Mr. Ainsworth.

XXIV. The High Priest brought the Bodies of those Beasts (whose Blood was
brought into the Sanctuary) to be burnt without the Camp. Heb. 13.11


Parallel.
I. CHrist was of the Race of Mankind, of the Seed of David according to the
Flesh: Romans 1.1^^ Heb. 2* 14, 15. Heb. 7.26, 28.
Forasmuch as Children are Partakers of Flesh and Blood, he likewise took part
of the same; but was altogether pure, spotless, without the least Stain of Sin.

II. So Christ glorified not himself, to be made an High Priest; but he that
said unto him, Thou art my Son, Act. 13.33. Psalm. 110 4
etc. and in another place, Thou art a Priest for ever, etc. The Father
invested him in this Office: Him has God the Father sealed. Joh. 6.27.
He was baptized, and the Spirit came down visibly upon him, when he was about
thirty Years old.

III. Christ was anointed with the Oil of Gladness above his Fellows. Heb. 2.9.
How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost, and with Power. Act.
10 38
He had also immaculate Sanctity and Purity in him.

IV. Christ was said to be glorious in his Apparel, clothed with the Divine
Nature as with a Garment; Isa. 63.1, 2
he was adorned with perfect and complete Righteousness.

V. Signifying (says Mr. Guild) the Deity of Christ, which as a Circle has
neither beginning nor end; and the Royal Dignity, Jer. 23 5. Ephesians. 1.22. Col.
1.18.
whereby he is advanced to be the Supreme Head in all things to his Church, or
his Kingship. See Goodwin's Moses and Aaron.

VI. Christ's Humanity is clothed with true Holiness, Rev. 19.8.
which is compared to fine Linen, clean and white.

VII. The Lord Jesus, as our High Priest, presents, ^^or bears the Remembrances
of all his faithful People upon his Heart, Heb. 7.25. Joh. 10.3.
when he appears before God to make Intercession for them: He knows his own
Sheep by Name.

VIII. Christ has in him the Perfection of true Light, Beauty, and Holiness.
Vrim and Thummim signified Christ's Prophetical Office, whereby He, Goodwin's
Moses and Aaron, p. 17.
as a standing Oracle to his Church, answers all Doubts and Controversies
whatsoever.

IX. Christ is the real Antitype of this engraven Plate, in likeness of a
Signet, Holiness to the Lord, in that the Father has actually communicated to
him his Nature, He 8.1.2, 3
who is the express Image of his Person, a glorious Representation of him to
us, being able to bear, and has born our Iniquities: Isa. 53.
The Lord has laid on him the Iniquities of us all.

X. Christ is the Mouth of the Father to the Sons of Men; He is called the Word
of God. Rev. 19.13 Heb. 1.2.
God has spoken unto us by his Son.

XI. Christ's Church must be a pure Virgin, chaste, unstained with Superstition
or Idolatry, giving neither Love nor Worship to any other; Christ owns none but
such a People for his Spouse.

XII. Christ offered up his own Body, as a Sacrifice for our Sins: Heb. 9.28.
He appeared to put away Sin, by the Sacrifice of himself. Christ was once
offered to bear the Sins of many, etc.

XIII. As Christ was offered upon the Cross for the Sins of Mankind, as a
propitiatory Sacrifice; so must his Blood in a spiritual manner be sprinkled
upon our Consciences, that we may be cleansed from our Sins, and accepted in
the sight of God. Heb. 10.22
Let us draw near with a true Heart, in full assurance of Faith, having our
Hearts sprinkled from an evil Conscience, etc. Heb. 9.13, 14.
For if the Blood of Bulls and Goats, and the Ashes of an Heifer, sprinkled the
unclean, sanctified to the purifying of the Flesh; how much more shall the
Blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself to God, purge
your Consciences from dead Works, to serve the living God? But ye are come to
Mount Zion, etc. -- And to Jesus, the Mediator of the new Covenant; Heb. 12.22,
24.
and to the Blood of Sprinkling, that speaks better things than the Blood of
Abel.

XIV. Christ's Righteousness remains for ever, to cloth and adorn all true
Believers. It Is the Wedding Garment, Mat. 22.12, 13.
whosoever has it not, shall be shut out of the Marriage-Chamber, and cast
into utter Darkness.

XV. Christ sounds the great Trumpet of the Gospel, for the assembling and
gathering together of his Elect to himself, from all the four Quarters of the
Earth; and will sound an Alarm at the last Day, to the general Judgment. 1 Cor.
15.52.
The Trumpet shall sound, and the Dead shall be raised, etc.

XVI. Christ is the great Teacher of God's Law; it is he that gives us the
knowledge of Salvation, Luke 1.79.
that guides our Feet into the way of Peace. We must seek the Law, i. e. the
Mind and Will of God, at his Mouth, who shows us plainly of the Father. His
Tabernacle is only standing; not Moses's, not Aaron's, not Elias's, Mat. 17.4,
5.
but Jesus's: This is my beloved Son, hear him. He is the last and only Teacher
sent from God.

XVII. Christ is Judge concerning the Plague of every Man's Heart, what Sin is
deadly, and what not. Tho there is no Sin venial, as the Papist's affirm, yet
there is much more danger and evil in some Sins, than in others. As for
example, It Is worse to have Sin in the Affection, than in the Conversation; to
love it, than to commit it. The best of Saints have not been without Sin;
Infirmities have attended them, yet they loved them not. It Is a loathsome thing
to a true Believer: That which I hate, that do I. The Priest was to pronounce a
Man utterly unclean, Romans 7. See Mr. Buroughs Sp^^ts of the Godly, p. 43, 44.
if the Plague was got into his Head: So if a Man's Judgment, Will, and
Affection, are for the ways of Sin; if they choose and love that which is evil,
Christ the High Priest, in his Word, pronounces such unclean. When Men approve
not of God's ways, because they forbid, and give no toleration to their beastly
Lust and Sensuality, and from hence secretly contemn Religion in the strictness
of it; these surely have the Plague in their Heads.

XVIII. The Lord Jesus makes and anoints many to be Kings; for besides his
acting toward Men, in bringing of them to their Thrones and Kingdoms, as it is
said, By me Kings reign, Prove. 8.15 Rev. 5.10.
he makes all his Saints Kings and Priests, and they shall reign on Earth.

XIX. Christ has the absolute Power of appointing what Officers should be in
his Church: He gave some Apostles, Ephesians. 4 11.
some Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastors and Teachers. Those that make
any other spiritual Office or Officer, Rev. 22.18, 19.
than Christ has ordained, will be found grand Criminals in the great Day.

XX. Christ was sent to bless the People, Acts 5.26
by turning every one of them from the evil of their Ways; to give Pardon, yea,
the holy Spirit, and eternal Life, to as many as believe on him.

XXI. Christ entered into Heaven it self alone for us, as Mediator, Heb. 9.24.
through the Merit of his precious Blood, shed to make Atonement once for all,
there to appear in the presence of God for us. Heb. 9.12.
Neither by the Blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own Blood, he entered in
once into the holy Place, having obtained eternal Redemption for us.

XXII. Christ only makes the Prayers of the Saints to come up into the Nostrils
of God, through his own Mediation, as sweet Incense; Rev. 8.3.
and no other Prayer must be made to God, but such only as the High Priest
directs us in. Mat. 6 8, 9, 10.


XXIII. Christ's Death makes an Atonement for all guilty Sinners, that fly to
the spiritual City of Refuge, not for the Man slayer only, but for the
Adulterer, Drunkard, and Murderer also; all, whoever they be, that take hold of
God in Christ by a lively Faith, are set at liberty, and for ever delivered
from the Avenger of Blood, and all spiritual Thraldom whatsoever.

XXIV. Jesus also, Heb. 13.12
that he might sanctify the People with his own Blood, suffered without the
Gate, that so we might from thence go forth unto him without the Camp, bearing
his Reproach.



Type.
I. THe Jewish High Priest was taken of the Tribe of Levi, and so was after the
Order of Aaron.

II. The Jewish High Priest was made without an Oath, and after the Law of the
carnal Commandment.

III. The Highpriests under the Law were Men that had Infirmities, and needed
to offer up Sacrifices for their own Sins. Heb. 7.27, 28.


IV. The Priests under the Law offered up Sacrifices of Sin continually: Every
Priest stands daily, ministering or offering often the same Sacrifices, Heb.
^^.11.
which cannot take away Sins.

V. The Priests under the Law offered up the Bodies of Beasts, and it was
impossible that the Blood of Bulls and of Goats could take away Sin, Heb. 10.1,
2.
or purge the Conscience, or make the Comers thereunto perfect. Hence it is
said, there was a Remembrance of Sin every Year. Verse. 3.


VI. The High Priest under the Law had a Successor; there were many, Heb. 7.23.
because they were not suffered to continue by reason of Death.

VII. The Priest under the Law, and the Sacrifices, were two things.

VIII. The Priest under the Law entered into the holy Place, with the Blood of
Bulls and Calves.

IX. The Priest under the Law offered Sacrifices only for the Jewish Nation, or
Israel according to the Flesh.

Disparity.
I. CHrist sprung of the Tribe of Judah, and not after the Order of Aaron, but
after the Order of Melchisedec. Wherefore the Priesthood being changed, Heb.
9.14, 16, 12.
there is of necessity a Change of the whole Law.

II. Christ was made a Priest with an Oath: Heb. 7.22.
By so much was Jesus made a Surety of a better Covenant.

III. But Christ is an High Priest without Infirmity: Heb. 7.28.
For the Law makes Men Highpriests, which have Infirmity; but the Word of the
Oath, which was since the Law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
For such an High Priest became us, Heb. 7 26.
who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from Sinners, and made higher than
the Heavens.

IV. Christ having offered up but one Sacrifice for Sin, Heb. 8.12.
sat down at the right hand of God. Heb. 9.26, 28.
Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the High Priest entered into the
holy Place, -- For then must he have often suffered since the Foundation of the
World; but now at the end of the World has he appeared to take away Sin, by
the Sacrifice of himself. Christ once suffered to bear the Sins of many, etc.
Heb. 10.14
By one Offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.

V. Christ offered up his own Body, which was the Antitype of all those Legal
Sacrifices: By which we are sanctified, Heb. 10.10
through the offering up the Body of Christ once for all. Those Sacrifices
cleansed only ceremonially: Heb. 7.19.
The Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better Hope did.
Christ's Blood, Heb. 9.14.
who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purges the
Conscience from dead Works, to serve the Living God. 1 John 1.7.
The Blood of Christ cleanses us from all Sin.

VI. Christ, because he continues for ever, Heb. 7.24, 25.
has an unchangeable Priesthood. He has none, needs none, can have none to
succeed him in the Priesthood, seeing he ever lives, and has taken the whole
Work upon himself, being infinitely able and sufficient to discharge the whole
Trust reposed in him.

VII. Christ is both Priest and Sacrifice. The Divinity, or eternal Spirit,
offered up the Humanity, as an acceptable Sacrifice unto God.

VIII. Christ entered into the Holiest by his own Blood, Heb. 9.12.
having obtained eternal Redemption for us.

IX. Christ offered up a Sacrifice both for Jews and Gentiles. 1 John 2.2.
He is a Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but for the Sins of
the whole World.



Corollaries.
I. FRom hence we may learn, that without the Blood of Christ offered up as a
propitiatory Sacrifice to God, there is no Remission of Sin, nor eternal Life.
God's Wrath is only appeased by a Sacrifice; and this was clearly hinted from
the beginning.

II. From hence we may learn, how far the Priesthood of Christ, and the
Gospel Covenant, does excel that of the Law; moreover, the End and Design of
God in the one, and in the other. Many things have been briefly touched,
wherein the great Differences do consist; some of which, for the sake of the
Weak, I shall reiterate in this place. The Priest under the Law was a mortal
Man; Christ God-Man. Those Priests were Sinners themselves, and needed a
Sacrifice for their own Sins; Christ was without Sin, and needed no Offering
for himself, Christ offered up his own Body on the Tree. Those Sacrifices were
the Shadow; the Sacrifice of Christ is the Substance of them. The Priest and
Sacrifice is the Type, Christ the Antitype. Those Sacrifices could not take
away Sin, nor purge the Conscience; Christ's Sacrifice does both.

III. Moreover, this reprehends such as slight and invalidate the meritorious
Sacrifice of Christ, Heb. 10.
and account his Blood to have no more virtue nor efficacy in it to
Justification, than the Blood of any godly Man.

IV. It also calls upon all faithful Christians, to study the Nature of
Christ's Priesthood more and more; much of the Mystery of the two Covenants
consists in Priesthood and Sacrifice, there is something in it hard to be
understood.

V. This greatly detects the Ignorance and abominable Error of the Romish
Church, that continues to offer up fresh Sacrifices for Sin; as if Christ had
not offered up a sufficient Sacrifice once for all, or that he needs
Competitors, and Help, to atone and make Peace between God and Sinners.

VI. It may also confute their blasphemous Notion concerning Christ's
Priesthood, as if it passed from him unto them; whereas nothing can be more
plainly asserted, than his continuing a Priest for ever. His Priesthood is
unchangeable, exercised in his own Person, as a principal part of the Glory of
his Office; and on the discharge of it, depends the Churches Preservation and
Stability: He ever lives to make Intercession for us. And every Believer may
from hence go with confidence unto Him in all their Concerns, Heb. 7 25. chap.
2 17. chap. 4.15. chap. 5.2.
for Relief and Succor, who Himself is said to be touched with the feeling of
our Infirmities.

But this of Christ's offering once for all, and continuing a Priest for ever,
the Rhemist Annotators are greatly at a loss about, concluding, that it makes
against the Jews and Aaron's Priesthood; which worthy Cartwright learnedly
answers, to whom we refer you. For clear it is, that what the Papists affirm
concerning their Priest and Mass to be a propitiatory Sacrifice for the Quick
and the Dead, is detected from hence to be a blasphemous, execrable, and
pestilent Error; and by no means are they able to make the Offerings and
Sacrifices made by their Priests, as Christ's Successors, to hold good in any
case, or consonant to God's Word. Which further to evince, we shall here cite a
Page of Dr. Owen's, on Heb. 7.24. and so conclude this of Christ's Priesthood.

The Expositors of the Roman Church are greatly perplexed in the reconciling of
this Passage of the Apostle unto the present Priesthood of their Church; and
they may well be so, Dr. Owen.
seeing undoubtedly they are irreconcilable. Some of them say, That Peter
succeeded unto Christ in his Priesthood, as Eleazar did unto Aaron; so Ribera.
Some of them deny that he has any Successor, properly so called: Successorem
non habet, nec ita quisquam Catholicus loquitur, si been and circumspecte loqui
velit, says Aestius. But it is openly evident, that some of them are not so
circumspect as Aestius would have them, but do plainly affirm, that Peter was
Christ's Successor. A Lapide indeed affirms, that Peter did not succeed unto
Christ, as Eleazar did unto Aaron, because Eleazar had the Priesthood in the
same degree and dignity with Aaron, and so had not Peter with Christ; but yet
that he had the same Priesthood with him, a Priesthood of the same kind, he
does not deny.

That which they generally six upon is, That their Priests have not another
Priesthood, or offer another Sacrifice, but are Partakers of his Priesthood,
and minister under him, and so are not his Successors, but his Vicars; which I
think is the worst Composure of this Difficulty they could have thought upon:
For,

1. This is contrary unto the Words and Design of the Apostle; for the Reason
he assigns, why the Priesthood of Christ does not pass from him to any other,
is, because he abides himself for ever to discharge the Office of it. Now this
excludes all Subordination and Conjunction, all Vicars, as well as Successors;
unless we shall suppose, that although he does thus abide, yet he is one way or
other disabled to discharge his Office.

2. The Successors of Aaron had no more another Priesthood, but what he had,
nor did they offer any other Sacrifice than what he offered, as these Priests
pretend to offer the same Sacrifice that Christ did: So that still the case is
the same between Aaron and his Successors, and Christ and his Substitutes.

3. They say, That Christ may have Substitutes in his Office, tho he abide a
Priest still, and although the Office still continue the same unchangeable: So
God, in the Government of the World, makes use of Judges and Magistrates, yet
is himself the supreme Rector of all. But this Pretense is vain also: For they
do not substitute their Priests unto him, in that which he continues to do
himself, but in that which he does not, which he did indeed, as a Priest ought
to do, but now cease to do for ever in his own Person; for the principal Act
of the Sacerdotal Office of Christ consisted in his Oblation, or his offering
himself a Sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor unto God. This he did once, and
cease for ever from doing so any more; but these Priests are assigned to
offer him in Sacrifice every day, as Partakers of the same Priesthood with him,
which is indeed not to be his Substitutes, but his Successors, and to take his
Office out of his hand, as if he were dead, and could henceforth discharge it
no more: For they do not appoint Priests to intercede in his Room, because they
grant he continues himself so to do, but to offer Sacrifice in his stead,
because he does so no more. Wherefore if that be an Act of Priesthood, and of
their Priesthood, as is pretended, it is unavoidable that his Priesthood is
passed from him unto them. Now this is a blasphemous Imagination, and directly
contrary both unto the Words of the Apostle, and the whole Design of his
Argument; nay, it would lay the Advantage on the other side.: For the Priests
of the Order of Aaron had that Privilege, that none could take their Office
upon them, nor officiate in it, whilst they were alive; but although Christ
abides for ever, yet according to the Sense of these Men, and their Practice
thereon, he stands in need of others to officiate for him, and that in the
principal part of his Duty and Office. For to offer himself in Sacrifice unto
God, he neither now does, nor can, seeing henceforth he dies no more. This is
the Work of the Mass-Priests alone, who must therefore be honored as the
Successors of Christ, or else be abhorred as his Murderers; for the Sacrifice
of Him must be by Blood and Death.

The Argument of the Apostle, as it is exclusive of this Imagination, so it is
cogent unto this purpose; for so he proceeds: That Priesthood which changes
not, but is always vested in the same Person, and in him alone, is more
excellent than that which was subject to change continually from one hand to
another; for that Transmission of it from one unto another, was an Effect of
Weakness and Imperfection. And the Jews grant, that the Frequency of their
Change under the second Temple was a Token of God's Displeasure. But thus it
was not with the Priesthood of Christ, which never changes, and that of Aaron,
which was always in a transient Succession. And the Reasons he gives of this
contrary State of these two Priesthoods, do greatly enforce the Argument: For
the first Priesthood was so successive, because the Priests themselves were
obnoxious unto Death, the Sum and Issue of all Weaknesses and Infirmities. But
as to the Lord Jesus Christ, his Priesthood is perpetual and unchangeable,
because he abides personally for ever: Being made a Priest according to the
Power of an endless Life, which is the Sum of all Perfection that our Nature is
capable of.

Christ a Prophet.
Mat. 13.57. A Prophet is not without Honor, save in his own Country.

Luke 7.16. And they glorified God, saying, That a great Prophet was risen
among them.

John 4.19. The Woman said unto him, Sir, I perceive thou art a Prophet.

Acts 3.22. For Moses truly said unto the Fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord
your God raise up unto you, like unto me, etc.


IT is a common and received Principle amongst all that are truly godly, that
Jesus, the Son of the Highest, stands in a capacity of King, Priest, and
Prophet to his Church, and so is to be received by all that will on good
grounds receive benefit by him. Having spoken somewhat of his Kingly and
Priestly Office, somewhat relating to Him in respect of his Prophetical Office,
is hinted in the Particulars following.

Prophet.
I. A Prophet is a Mouth to others, to speak forth what is the Sense and Mind
of God to them: And the Lord said unto Moses, Exodus 7.1.
See, I have made thee a God unto Pharaoh, and Aaron thy Brother shall be thy
Prophet, and speak unto Pharaoh.

II. A Prophet speaks not of himself, but the Word of God comes to him, to
teach him what he shall say: For when David was up in the morning, the Word of
the Lord came unto the Prophet Gad, David 's Seer, saying, etc.

III. A Prophet does anoint others, and install them into Office, 1 Samuel 10.1.
1 King. 1.25.
as Samuel did Saul, and as Nathan did Solomon.

IV. A Prophet gives direction for cleansing from Filthiness, Uncleanness, or
Leprosy. The Servant of Naaman came near, 2 King. 5.13.
and spoke unto him, and said, My Father, if the Prophet had bid thee do some
great thing, would thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he says
unto thee, Wash, and be clean?

V. A Prophet was to pray for the People, as the proper Work of his place;
hence Samuel says, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord, 1 Samuel 12.23.
in ceasing to pray for you, etc.

VI. A Prophet, tho never so good or great, is slighted by his own Neighbors
and People; he is without Honor in his own Country. Mat. 13 37


VII. A true Prophet is ordained of God, is sent forth to do that Work and
Business: Jer. 1.5.
Before thou came out of the Womb, I ordained thee to be a Prophet unto the
Nations.

VIII. A Prophet is anointed to do and perform the Work proper to his place; as
it is said, Elisha, the Son of Shaphat, 1 King. 19.16.
thou shall anoint to be a Prophet.

IX. A Prophet is the Leader and Guide of the People, as it is said, By a
Prophet the Lord led Israel out of Egypt.

X. A true Prophet ought to be believed: Believe his Prophets, so shall you
prosper. 2 Chronicles. 20.20.


XI. A Prophet bears witness to the Truth: Acts 10 43
To him give all the Prophets Witness.

Jer. 44.4. Ezekiel. 38.17. Dan. 9.6. Amos 3.7.
XII. A Prophet is a Man of God, a Servant of God, and knows his Secrets.

XIII. The Prophets of God laid a Foundation for the Church to build upon, in
respect of Faith and Doctrine: Ephesians. 2.20.
And that the Church is built upon the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets.

XIV. The Work of a true Prophet is, to perfect the Work appertaining to the
Church, as well as to lay the Foundation of it: He gave some Prophets, Ephesians. 4.
etc. for the perfecting of the Saints, etc.

XV. Prophets are to be Examples to others: Take, my Brethren* the Prophets for
an Example. Jam. 5.10.


XVI. Prophets gave forth Scripture by the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit, for
Men to have recourse to at all times, for Quickening, Comfort, and Instruction
in Righteousness: As it is written in the Prophets. According to the Scriptures
of the Prophets. Acts 7.42. Rom 16.26.
The Prophecy came not in old Time, etc.

XVII. Prophets do not only expound and show what is past, and already
fulfilled, but foretell and predict things to come, (which they all did more or
less) as a proper part of their Work.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ is the Mouth of God, who speaks forth his Mind and Will unto
the Sons of Men. God, Heb. 1 ^^, 2.
who at sundry times, and in diverse manners, spoke in time past unto the
Fathers, has in these last days spoken unto us by his Son. The Words which I
speak are not mine, Joh. 14.2^^.
but the Father's that sent me.

II. Jesus Christ speaks not of himself, (as he was Man) but the Word of God
came to him, to direct him what he should speak: I speak not of my self. The
Revelation of Jesus Christ, Joh. 12.49 Rev. 1.1.
which God gave unto him, to show unto his Servants things that must shortly
come to pass.

III. Jesus Christ does anoint others, and install them into Office, of whom it
is said, We have received an Unction from the Holy One, that teaches all
things. 1 John 2.^^0
I thank Jesus Christ, who has put me into the Ministry.

IV. Jesus Christ gives direction for cleansing from all Uncleanness, both in
respect of Body and Soul; He said to the Leper, I will, be thou clean, etc. And
when he saw the Lepers, he said unto them, Ma. 8.2.
Go, show your selves to the Priests; and it came to pass, that as they went
they were cleansed. Joh. 15.3^^
Now are ye clean through the Word which I have spoken to you. He does not only
direct, but gives cleansing: Having washed us from our Sins in his own Blood.
Rev. 1.5.


V. Jesus Christ did eminently answer the Work of a good Prophet, in praying
for the People.

1. For his Friends: I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Comforter. Joh. 14.16.
(1.) That they may be kept from Evil. John 17. v. 9, 15, 17, 21.
(2.) That they may be sanctified through the Truth. (3.) That they may be
brought to an inseparable Union. Nay, more than this,

2. He prays for his Enemies; Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do.

VI. Jesus Christ, tho he was the greatest and best of Prophets that ever was
sent to the Children of Men, yet was he slighted by his own People, and
rejected by his near Neighbors: Joh. 1.11.
He came unto his own, and his own received him not. Is not this the
Carpenter's Son, whose Father and Mother we know? etc.

VII. Jesus Christ was ordained, and sent of God to do the Work and Office of a
Prophet: I came not of my self, but the Father sent me. Heb. 3.2.
He was faithful to him that appointed him, as Moses also was,

VIII. Jesus Christ is anointed to be a Prophet, and to perform the Work proper
to his place; as it is said, Because thou have loved Righteousness, and hated
Iniquity, Heb. 1.9.
therefore God, even thy God, has anointed thee with the Oil of Gladness above
thy Fellows. The Lord God has anointed me to preach the Gospel to the Poor,
etc. Luke 4.18.


IX. Jesus Christ is the Leader or Guide of his People, called the Forerunner
and Captain of our Salvation. He shall feed his Flock like a Shepherd, Isa.
40.11.
and gently lead those that are with young, etc. Behold, I have given him for a
Witness to the People, Isa. 55.4.
a Leader and Commander to the People.

X. Jesus Christ ought to be believed. God commands all Men to hear him, John
8. Jude
and unless they believe in him, they shall die in their Sins. For Moses truly
said unto the Fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of
your Brethren, Acts 3.22, 23.
like unto me, him shall ye hear in all things he shall say unto you. And it
shall come to pass, that every Soul that will not hear that Prophet, shall be
destroyed from among the People.

XI. Jesus Christ did bear witness to the Truth; He witnessed a good Confession
before Pontius Pilate, and is called the faithful and true Witness, and
First-begotten from the Dead.

XII. Jesus Christ is a Man of God indeed, a Servant of God, whose Meat and
Drink it was to do his Will, and one who knew all the Father's Secrets: No Man
has seen God at any time, Mat. 11.26, 27.
save the only begotten Son of God, which is in the Bosom of the Father, he
has declared him.

XIII. Jesus Christ has excelled all that went before him in this respect. He
was not applauded by the People only, who said he was a Teacher come from God,
Mat. 7.29.
that he taught like one that had Authority, and never Man spoke like him; but
he was commended as one fit to be heard, by God himself, and that with an
audible Voice from Heaven, This is my beloved Son, hear ye him.

This great Prophet of the Most High has, in pursuit of his Prophetical
Office, Mat. 3.17.
laid a fair Foundation for the Church to build upon, in these great and most
important Points:

1. He has set forth God in the Excellency of his Nature, and Perfections. He
has told us, we are to have Faith in him, to love him with all our whole Soul,
and with all our Strength, and to worship him in Spirit and in Truth.

2. He has set forth Himself as Mediator, the immediate Object of Faith, and
to be followed in his Life and Doctrine: Another Foundation can no Man lay.

3. He has confirmed the Holy Scriptures, as the Rule of Worship, 1 Cor. 3.11
directing Men to them for the Regulation of their Hearts and Lives. Search the
Scriptures. It Is written in your Law, etc. And to the young Man, Joh. 5.39.
that would know what he should do to inherit eternal Life, he said* How
read thou? etc.

4. He has set forth the World to come, in the Glory of it, as the Reward of
Worship, telling them that there is a Kingdom to be given, and, The Pure in
Heart shall see God.

XIV. Jesus Christ has not only, as the Author of our Faith, laid a sure
Foundation for us to build upon; but, as the Finisher thereof, has Store of
Gifts and Graces to bestow, which he has promised to give down; and has also
proposed such Examples and Precepts touching all the Particularities of our
Duty, which, if followed, cannot miss of perfecting, and making the Church
complete. Be ye merciful, as -- Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is
perfect. Love one another: Walk as you have me for an Example; and what you
would that Men should do to you, that do unto them: This is the Law and the
Prophets.

XV. Jesus Christ was the most perfect Copy to write by, the best Example to
conform our Lives unto, that ever our Eyes beheld, or that ever appeared. 1. In
his unparalled Meekness, Humility, Self-Denial, and Contempt of this World.
2. His unwearied Patience under Afflictions and Sufferings. 3. His Zeal and
Forwardness to do good, even to the worst of his Enemies.

XVI. Jesus Christ has given forth Scripture by the glorious Power of the
Holy Ghost, which are the four Evangelists, and all the Epistles; and as to the
Book of the Apocalypse, he has so confirmed it, that he has made it Damnation
to any that shall add to it, Rev. 22.18, 19.
or diminish from it.

XVII. Herein Jesus Christ has completed his Work as a Prophet. He did
expound to his Disciples what was written in the Law of Moses, in the Prophets,
and in the Psalms, concerning himself. And not only so, but he foretold them
things that were yet to come to pass; as the Destruction of Jerusalem, Luke 21.
Mat. 24. Mark 13.
and the Captivity of the Jews. He did not conceal, but plainly told, that
there should be a Day of Distress, such as had not been since they were a
Nation. And soon after his Ascension, sent his Angel to signify to his Servant
John, Rev. 1.
for the teaching all his Churches, many things that are, and shortly should
come to pass. As,

1. The Rise, Reign, and Ruin of the last Beast.

2. The Suffering of the Church in the Wilderness, during his Reign.

3. The Glory, Grandeur, horrid Wickedness, and fearful Overthrow of Mystery
Babylon.

4. The going forth of the everlasting Gospel into all the World.

5. And lastly, his own coming in Glory, with the New Jerusalem, the holy
Angels, and all Saints, to solemnize the last and dreadful Judgment.



Prophet.
I. ALL other Prophets, besides Christ, were inspired by Christ. The Prophets
searched what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did signify, 1 Pet.
1.11
etc. by which he preached to the Spirits in Prison. 1 Pet. 3.18


II. Other Prophets pointed at Christ, as the Scope of their Prophecies; they
testified beforehand the Sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that was to
follow.

III. Other Prophets did but begin the holy Books, that were to be the
perpetual Rule of Faith and Practice; they told us of Divine Things but in part.

IV. Other Prophets spoke of God by private Inspiration, and the Intelligence
of Angels, and few of them confirmed their Words by Miracles.

V. Other Prophets have left their Work, and are all gone: Your Fathers, where
are they? And the Prophets, Zech. 1 5.
do they live for ever? What Man is he that lives, Joh. 8.52.
and shall not see Death? Abraham is dead, and the Prophets, etc.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ received not the holy Spirit by measure, but has the Fullness
of the Godhead dwelling bodily in him. For in him dwells all the Fullness of
the Godhead bodily. Col. 2.9.


II. Jesus Christ came as the Sum of their Prophecies, to fulfill them, and
complete what they foretold. This is He, of whom Moses in the Law, Joh. 1.45.
and the Prophets did write.

III. Jesus Christ did finish and complete the holy Books, which are to be the
perfect and complete Rule of Faith and Practice to the end of the World. He
showed plainly of the Father. He is that Prophet that all Men are to hear, upon
the Penalty of being destroyed from amongst the People. He that hears not his
Voice, and believes not his Gospel, shall not see Life, but perish in his Sins.
How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation, confirmed by Signs and
Wonders? Heb. 2.3.


IV. But Jesus Christ spoke of the Father, as he had seen Him, and conversed
with Him, heard his Words, and was in his Bosom, before He came down among us
in the likeness of Man, and confirmed his Doctrine by many immediate and mighty
Miracles. No Man has seen God at any time, but the only begotten Son, Mat.
11.27 Joh. 1.18.
that is in the Bosom of the Father, he has declared him. The things that I
have heard of him, I speak unto you. If I had not done amongst them the Works
which none other Man did, Joh. 6.46. Joh. 8.38. Joh. 14.11 Joh. 15.24
they had not had Sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my
Father.

V. Jesus Christ abides in his Prophetical Office still, that is of like
continuance with his Kingly and Priestly Office; as he abides a Priest
continually, so a Prophet. He is with his Church, to lead it, and guide it, to
the end of the World, as himself says, Mat. 28.20
And lo I am with you always, even to the end of the World.



Inferences.
I. WE may infer from hence, That God has been exceeding good unto the World
in sending such a Prophet, after the great Abuse of others that went before; a
good Prophet, a great Prophet; none like him that went before him, or should
come after him: The Son of God, Emanuel, God with us. Mat. 1.23.


II. This informs us also, how exceeding useful our Lord Jesus Christ, as a
Prophet, is to his Church; having completed what others left undone, showing
the Riches, Glory, and Duration of the World to come; and indeed, in declaring
the whole Counsel of God, and bringing Life and Immortality to light through
the Gospel.

III. Moreover, you may seee the absolute Necessity the Church has of such a
Prophet, without whom the People would have sat in Darkness, and in the Shadow
of Death, and have been left to stumble upon the dark Mountains.

IV. From hence we infer the infallible Certainty of what he has declared, for
it could not be that such a Prophet should deceive the World: These things are
true and faithful.

V. Behold the strong and forcible Obligation that is upon the World, to
believe his Doctrine where it is preached, and to reject all Doctrines that are
repugnant to it.

VI. How inexcusable will all those be, who reject his Gospel, and despise his
Ministers: It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of
Judgment, than for them. Mat. 10.15


VII. Let the Christian Church from hence learn to hold fast what she has
received; for the Truth, as it is in Jesus, had a great and faithful Witness,
who confirmed it by mighty Miracles, and sealed it with his own Blood.

Christ a Shepherd.
John 10.11. I am the good Shepherd, etc. (...).


Metaphor.
I. A Shepherd is chosen and appointed to take care of the Sheep, being a Man
skilful in doing that Work and Business.

II. A Shepherd knows his Sheep, he knows their Number, and knows them
particularly from Sheep that are none of his, and one from another.

III. A Shepherd marks his Sheep, whereby they are distinguished from others.

IV. A Shepherd feeds his Sheep, he leads them to green Pastures, and Springs
of Water: Should not the Shepherd feed the Flock? Ezekiel. 34.2


V. A Shepherd preserves his Flock, he takes care they do not feed in unwholsom
Pastures, and defends them from Enemies.

VI. A Shepherd has a Fold for his Sheep, whither he brings them for their
better Security, and his own Profit.

VII. A Shepherd keeps his Sheep together, suffers them not to stray and
straggle abroad, lest they should be lost.

VIII. A Shepherd, if any of his Sheep be set upon by Dogs or Wolves, will
venture his Life for them, to defend and rescue them from those Beasts of Prey;
as David for a Lamb, 1 Samuel 17.36, 37.
fought with a Lion and a Bear.

IX. A Shepherd is very tender of his Flock, Genesis 33.13
will not over-drive them, takes special care of the Lambs, and those that are
weak and feeble.

X. If a Shepherd has lost one Sheep, if one Sheep or Lamb be gone astray, he
will seek it, and when he has found it, he brings it home with abundance of
Joy, saying to his Neighbors, Luke 15.5, 6.
Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost Sheep.

XI. A Shepherd heals the Diseases of the Sheep. The diseased (says God to the
Shepherds of Israel) have ye not strengthened, Ezekiel. 34.4.
neither have ye healed that which was sick.

XII. A Shepherd judges between Sheep and Sheep, between fat and lean Ones; and
if any push the weak, and hurt or wrong his Fellow, or would thrust and
shoulder him out of the Fold, the Shepherd takes notice of it, and accordingly
orders such who do the wrong.

XIII. The Shepherd watches over his Sheep, because of the Dangers that might
otherwise befall them in the Night: And there were in the same Country
Shepherds, abiding in the Field, Luke 2.8.
keeping watch over their Flock by night, etc.

XIV. Shepherds are to give an account of their Sheep, to see that none are
lacking.

XV. A Shepherd washes his Sheep (in convenient places) from all Filth and
Soil, which they are subject to contract to themselves.

XVI. A Shepherd delights much to see his Sheep and Lambs thrive.

XVII. A Shepherd, if he sees one or more of his Sheep are infected with any
Distemper, so that they may endanger the rest, he separates such from the Flock.

XVIII. A Shepherd separates the Sheep from the Goats.

XIX. A Shepherd leads his Flock to some sweet shady Place, where he makes them
rest at Noon, when the Sun shines hot.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ is chosen of God, and appointed to take the Care and Charge of
the Church, and very capable to undertake that blessed Work.

II. I know my Sheep, says Christ, and am known of mine. He takes special
notice of every particular Saint, he knew Moses by name. He knows their Wants,
their Sufferings, their Weaknesses, their Sicknesses, and whatever Service they
do for his holy Namesake.

III. The Lord Jesus has set his own Image upon his People. The Mark which
they always bear upon them, is, Holiness, Meekness, Obedience, Rev. 7.3, 4
by which they are distinguished from the World. Set a Mark upon the Men that
mourn. Ezekiel. 9.4.
Christ's Sheep are sealed in their Foreheads and Hands. 1. For Distinction. 2.
Secrecy. 3. Security.

IV. Christ feeds his Flock like a Shepherd, Isa. 40.11. Psalm. 23.1, 2. Joh.
10.3. Isa. 49.10. Prove. 8.6. Prove. 4.2. Jer. 3.15.
his great care is to put them into good and fat Pastures, and leads them by
the still Waters. He gives them good Doctrine, feeding them with Knowledge and
Understanding.

V. The Lord Jesus, to preserve his Church, does often charge and caution them
to beware of, and avoid all pernicious and evil Doctrine, false Teachers, etc.
And he continually defends them from Sin, Satan, and all other Enemies.

VI. The Lord Jesus has his Church for his Fold, whither he brings his Elect
for their better Security, and his own Glory. The Lord added unto the Church
daily such as should be saved. Acts 2.47.
Glory to God in the Church, throughout all Ages. Ephesians. 3.21.


VII. The Lord Jesus frequently assembles his People together, and will not
allow any to straggle abroad, or be like Lambs in large Places: Exhort one
another daily, etc. Heb. 10.25


VII. Christ laid down his Life for his Sheep, exposed himself to great Sorrows
and Miseries for their sakes, and engaged with the cruellest of Enemies, who
sought to make a Prey of, and devour his Flock, which all the Malice of wicked
Men, who lay Snares to entrap them, cannot accomplish. Jer. 5.26.


IX. Christ is exceeding tender of weak and feeble Christians. He shall gather
the Lambs with his Arm, Isa. 40 11.
and carry them in his Bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.
Strengthen ye the weak Hands, Isa. 3^^.3.
and confirm the feeble Knees.

X. Christ, the good Shepherd, came to seek and save that which was lost; his
great Design is to bring home Sinners, and such as have gone astray, as David,
Peter, and other Saints have done. Luke 15.1, 2, 3, etc.
When he finds them broken for their Sins, how is he pleased! He takes up the
lost Sheep upon his Shoulder, as it were, carries it upon the Power of his
Grace and Love into the Sheepfold with Joy.

XI. Christ binds up the brokenhearted, restores Sight to the Blind, and sets
at liberty them that are bruised; he pours in Oil and Wine into the Sinners
Wounds. I will bind up that which was broken, Ezekiel. 34.18.
and will strengthen that which was sick, etc.

XII. Christ judges between Member and Member, between one Saint and another.
And if any oppress and injure his Fellow-Christian, or if the Rich wrong the
Poor, or the Strong the Weak, and retain their Right, or would justle them out
of the Church, Christ takes special notice of it, and will reward them
accordingly: I will destroy the Fat and the Strong, if they repent not. Mark
10.42. Joh. 3.9, 10. Col. 3.25.
The Gentiles exercise Lordship, and their great Ones usurp Authority; but it
shall not be so among you. -- Diotrephes, who loves to have the Pre-eminence
among them, receives us not. -- I will remember his Deeds. He that does Wrong,
shall receive for the Wrong.

XIII. Christ continually keeps a strict watch over his People, his Eye is
never off them: I will keep it night and day. Isa. 2^^.3.
In this Night of Darkness, how happy are we, that the good Shepherd has his
Eye upon, and watches his threatened Flock, since so many Roman Wolves are
abroad.

XIV. Christ gives the Father an account of all his Sheep: Jo^^. 17.
Of all those that thou have given me, I have lost none, but the Son of
Perdition.

XV. Christ has loved us, and washed us from our Sins in his own Blood. It Is
his Blood that cleanses us (through Faith) from all Sin. Re^^. 15. 1 J^^h. 1.9.


XVI. Christ is wonderfully pleased to see his People grow in Grace, and in the
Fruits of the Spirit: Joh. 15.8*
Hereby is my Father glorified, that you bring forth much Fruit.

XVII. Christ, if he sees any evil, infected, and corrupted Members in the
Church, that may endanger the rest, he he gives command to purge them out, 1
Cor. 5.1, 2, 3. Tit. 3.10.
or separate them from the Church, by the righteous Censure thereof.

XVIII. Christ will make a plain Decision at the last Day. He will separate the
Godly from the Wicked, Mat. 25.
as a Shepherd separates the Sheep from the Goats.

XIX. Christ has the like care of his Flock; He is as the Shadow of a great
Rock in a weary Land, by his gracious Promises, and Protection in the Day of
Persecution.



Metaphor.
I. OTher Shepherds are generally Hirelings; they keep other Men's Sheep, and
not their own.

II. All other Shepherds are no more than Men, and generally poor, and of a
mean Race or Descent.

III. Other Shepherds may fail in Skill or Care, or may want Power to help and
save their Sheep from Danger, when the Lion or Wolf comes.

IV. Others are Shepherds of a few Sheep, of a few particular Flocks.

V. Other Shepherds are but Sheep themselves; nay, and if his, they cannot have
greater Dignity, conferred upon them.

VI. Other Shepherds may lose their Sheep; they may be diseased, rot, and
perish, and they cannot help them.

Disparity.
I. CHrist's Sheep are all his own by Creation; his by free Donation of the
Father; his by Election: You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. Joh.
15.16
They are his by Purchase or Redemption; he bought them with the Price of his
own Blood.

II. This Shepherd is the Son of God; never was there such a Shepherd in the
Church before, Romans 1.4.
nor ever shall arise after him: He thought it no Robbery to be equal with God.
Phil. 2.6.


III. Christ is called the Wisdom of God, and the Power of God. 1 Cor. 1.24.
His Bowels, Covenant, and Faithfulness, will not suffer him to forget or
neglect his Flock. He is able to drive away all the Beasts of Prey, with his
Voice can make the fiercest Lion tremble; He can make the Devils fly, and
restrain the Wrath of Man, and Powers of Darkness, at his pleasure.

IV. Christ is the great Shepherd of the Sheep. He is called Great, Heb. 13.20
2 Pet. 5.4.
1. In respect of his Person: 2. In respect of his Power. 3. Great, in respect
of the Flocks he has the charge and care of. He is the Universal Shepherd;
it is false of the Pope, but true of Christ. All the Sheep or Flocks that live,
or ever lived, were and are his. 4. Great, in respect of the Pastures he has
to accommodate his Sheep. The World is his, and the Fullness thereof. 5. Great,
in respect of the many inferior Shepherds that are under him, that must be
accountable to him.

V. Christ is the Shepherd of Shepherds. The Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles
themselves, and all Ministers of the Gospel, are Christ's Sheep, and under his
charge and keeping.

VI. Christ will lose none of his Sheep, He is able to cure all their Diseases,
Psalm. 103.3
and to keep them from perishing: My Sheep hear my Voice, and they follow me,
and they shall never perish, Joh. 10.28.
neither can any Man pluck them out of my hand.



Inferences.
1. IF Christ be the Shepherd of his Sheep, if he has the Care and Charge of
all the faithful People of God; this informs us, that they shall not, cannot be
at any time without a Shepherd: for Christ is not short-lived, or suject to
Death, as other Shepherds are: He ever lives, etc. Heb. 7.25.


2. Believers may say with David, If Christ be their Shepherd, Psalm. 23 1.
they shall not lack.

3. Let other Shepherds remember they are but Christ's Servants, Christ's
Deputies, and must be accountable to Him, the chief Shepherd, when he appears.

4. We may infer from hence, That the State and Condition of such Men is sad,
that worry, and make a Spoil of the Righteous; they are Christ's Lambs they
thus grievously abuse, and make Slaughter of.

5. Follow this Shepherd in his Doctrine, in his Example.

6. Examine your selves, whether you be his Sheep, or no: His Sheep know his
Voice from the Voice of Strangers. See more under the Metaphor of Sheep.

7. Take heed you do not straggle from the Fold, and refuse the Guidance and
Conduct of this Shepherd.

8. Enquire where this Shepherd feeds his Flock, Cant. 1.7.
and where he makes them rest at Noon.

Christ the Branch.
Zech. 3.8. I will bring forth my Servant, the Branch.

Zech. 6.12. Behold the Man whose Name is the Branch.


THe Hebrew word (...), and the Latin word, Germen, Leigh Crit. Sacr. p. 435.
do metaphorically signify Christ. The Greek Interpreters translated it, (...),
and the Vulgar Latin, Orientem; for they judged, that Christ might be so called
from that Glory and Brightness, by which he chased away the Darkness that
overspread the World; but the Word will not bear that Sense, as the Root (...)
shows.

In these places of Scripture, where Christ is called a Branch, we are to
understand his human Nature is intended; and this according to the Judgment of
diverse Expositors. Jer. 33.15.
I will cause the Branch of Righteousness to grow up unto David: Isa. 11.1.
Hence he is said to be a Branch out of the Stem of Jesse. And this is
according to the Apostle, where he minds, that God swear unto David, Acts 2.30.
that of the Fruit of his Loins according to the Flesh, He would raise up
Christ to sit upon his Throne. And upon this account Christ is called the Son
of David, Rev. 22.16
and the Offspring of David.

How fitly Christ may be compared to a Branch, we shall note under three or
four Particulars.

Metaphor.
I. A Branch has a Root or Stock from whence it proceeds.

II. A Branch is of the same Nature with the Stock or Root from whence it
naturally proceeds.

III. A Branch partakes of Sap and Nourishment from the Root.

IV. A Branch, or the Branches of a Tree, are the Glory of a Tree.

Parallel.
I. CHrist, as concerning the Flesh, Romans 1.3. Mark 6.3.
proceeded from Abraham, Jesse, David, Mary, etc.

II. Christ is really and truly Man, and hence he is called the Seed of the
Woman, Genesis 3.15. Genesis 22.18.
and the Seed of Abraham, etc. and, Made of a Woman, made like unto us in all
things, Sin only excepted. Heb. 2.14.
Forasmuch as Children are Partakers of Flesh and Blood, he also himself
likewise took part of the same.

III. Christ partook of Nourishment from the Virgin, not only in the Womb, but
afterward: Luke 11.27 and 23.29.
Blessed are the Paps that thou have sucked.

IV. Christ, the Son of Man, being the real Offspring and Son of David
according to the Flesh, Mat. 22.45 Rev. 22.16
is the Glory of all David's Race, and of the whole Church of God in general.



Inferences.
1. THis may serve to reprehend those that say, The Matter of Christ's human
Nature was from Heaven; and that he passed through the Womb of the Virgin, as
Water through a Conduit-Pipe; and is called the Seed of the Woman, Gal. 4.4.
and made of a Woman, upon no other account than his being born of a Woman. --
From hence,

2. We may admire the Goodness and rich Grace of God, and his distinguishing
Love to Mankind, in that the Lord Jesus took not hold of the Nature of Angels,
but of the Seed of Abraham, that there should be a Savior for fallen Man, Heb.
2.16.
and none for fallen Angels.

3. This shows how Man is magnified and exalted by the Almighty. What greater
Dignity can God confer upon us, than that our Nature should be united to, and
made one with the Deity? This is the Rise and Ground of all our Hope and
Consolation.

Christ the Way,
Joh. 14.6. I am the Way, etc. No Man can come to the Father, but by me.


I Am the Way, etc. Way is taken properly or metaphorically. In the latter
Sense diverse things are so called: VIZ. The Law or Word of God, Psalm. 119.1.
The Doctrine of the Gospel, Acts 19.9. The Secret Counsel of God, Romans 11.33.
The Conversation of the Godly, Psalm. 1.1. The Works of God, Job 41.19.


And in this Text (and some others) Christ is so called.

Way is a common Word or Phrase, taken for the chief Means and Medium for the
Attainment or Accomplishment of a Thing, and so is very comprehensive. As for
example: The way to gain Honor, is to do some worthy and honorable Action;
Honor is the End, the Person that seeks it is the Subject, the doing the
worthy Action is the Way to attain it. Again, If a Man would go to such or such
a City, he must travel that Road that leads thither; here also you have the
End, the Subject, and the Means or Way of obtaining the End. So in like manner,
if a Man would come to God, which is Happiness, his chief End, the Way is Jesus
Christ: No Man can come unto the Father, but by me. Here Man is the Subject,
God or Happiness the End, Christ the Way.

Metaphor.
I. A Way to attain to any Thing or Place that we greatly desire, and long
after, is necessary, without which our End and Desire can never be accomplished.

II. A Way must be assigned by the Public Legislators of a Kingdom, when it is
wanting, and appears absolutely necessary.

III. A Way that is assigned must be also made known, or else how shall Men do
to find it, and walk in it?

IV. A Way is useful upon diverse accounts, indeed to all Enterprises, whether
it be for the obtaining of Honor, Riches, Peace, Health, or Length of Days.

V. Ways lead from one Place or City to another.

VI. Ways are free for all; none are forbid to travel in such and such common
Ways and Roads.

VII. Great Care was to be taken under the Law, that the Ways to the Cities of
Refuge should be made smooth and plain; all Stumbling Blocks and Impediments
were to be removed, and they were to be thirty two Cubits broad. Ways ought not
only to be laid open, and made known, but also made passable, and easy to
travel in.

VIII. In a Way there ought to be suitable and necessary Accommodations for
Travelers.

IX. There is no coming to such or such a City, unless we go the Way which
leads thither.

X. Men are glad when they come to the End of a long Journey.

Parallel.
I. THere is an absolute Necessity of a Christ, for without him, Favor and
Reconciliation with God the Father cannot be obtained. The Jews, Acts 4.12.
who followed after Righteousness, attained it not, Romans 9.31, 32.
because they sought it not by Faith, they stumbled at that stumbling Stone.

II. Jesus Christ is assigned or appointed by the great Lawgiver of Heaven and
Earth, to be the Way to Happiness, who saw a Savior was wanting, and such an
one was necessary to bring Man to Glory.

III. Jesus Christ is made known by the Gospel, in which are plain Directions
how to find the Way. God saw it necessary to send his Servants, to proclaim and
make known Salvation: How shall they believe on him whom they have not heard?
Romans 10.14.
and how shall they hear without a Preacher?

IV. Jesus Christ is useful and necessary to all Enterprises, viz. 1. To
Honor: To as many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of
God. 2. To Riches: Riches and Honor are with me, yea, durable Riches and
Righteousness. 3. To Peace: He is our Peace, Ephesians* 2.14.
who has made both one, etc. In me ye shall have Peace. 4. He is Health,
Strength, and Length of Days: He that believes on me shall never die.

V. Christ, the spiritual Way, leads from Sin to Grace, out of Satan's Kingdom
to his own Kingdom, from Egypt to Canaan.

VI. Christ is a Way free for all Sinners. The Partition Wall is now broken
down. Mat. 11.28, 29. Ephesians. 2.14.
Jews and Gentiles, Rich and Poor, Young and Old, Male and Female, may freely
walk in this Way. None are forbid to come to Christ, to believe in him, and to
lead a holy Life.

VII. God, in his infinite Grace and Favor, has taken care to remove all
Impediments and Stumbling Blocks out of the Sinner's Way. The Way is plain and
easy to Men of Understanding; Isa. 57.14. Hos. 14.9.
it is but a falling in Love with God and Goodness, and accepting of a Savior
on Gospel-Terms, which are not hard: Mat. 11.28, 29.
My Yoke is easy, and my Burden is light. It Is possible for the greatest of
Sinners to be saved. The Way is well-troden; the Patriarchs, Prophets,
Apostles, and all the Godly, walked in this very Way. It Is made very smooth;
the weakest Traveller may without stumbling or danger walk in it.

VIII. In Christ, the spiritual Way, are all things necessary provided: There
is Bread and Water of Life, sweet Repose, and precious Grace ready to defray
all Expenses, for every willing and faithful Traveller.

IX. There is no coming to God but by Christ: Acts 4.12.
There is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby we must be saved. Whoever
refuse Christ, and Life through him, let their Confidence be never so great, it
will deceive them, and their Hope will prove like the Spider's Web.

X. Poor Sinners greatly rejoice, when through Christ they are brought home to
the Father; but what Joy will it be to them, when they come to the End of their
Journey, the Salvation of their Souls!



Quest. In what respect is Christ called the Way, or said to be the Way to the
Father?

Ans. As he is Mediator between God and Man.

1. As a Priest, he atoned and made Peace by his own Blood, and thereby he is a
blessed Way for us to the Father, and as he is a Priest to intercede for us in
Heaven. See Advocate.

2. He is the Way, as a King to appoint Laws for us, and to subdue Sin, and
other Enemies, in us, and for us.

3. He is the Way, as a Prophet to teach and instruct us by his Word and
Spirit, how to receive that glorious Atonement he has made, and to walk in
those Ordinances he has appointed.

4. He is the Way by that holy Example he has left for us.

Quest. What kind of Way is Christ?

Ans. 1. He is the only Way to the Father, and eternal Life. (1.) The
Patriarchs of old knew no other Way: Abraham rejoiced to see my Day, etc. Joh.
8.56.
(2.) The Prophets knew no other Way. (3.) The Apostles knew no other Way. (4.)
There is no other Way revealed to Mankind. (5.) There is a Curse denounced to
such as shall preach any other Way.

2. Christ is a new Way: The old Way of Access to God was barred and chained up
by the Fall; his Blood is called the Blood of the new Covenant. -- By a new and
living Way, etc. Heb. 10.20


3. Christ is a sure and certain Way; no Man ever missed Heaven, that rightly
sought it in this Way.

4. Christ is a safe Way; there is Protection, Guidance, and safe Direction in
him.

4. Christ is an easy Way; his Yoke is easy, his Commands are easy. Mat. 11.30
There is Strength, and Supplies of all things necessary, afforded to all that
walk in him.

6. Christ is a comfortable Way. There is sweet Company, all Friends and
Brethren, and no Enemy walks in this Way; besides, there are excellent
Accommodations.

7. Christ is a plain Way, a Way prepared, cast up, and all Stumbling Blocks
removed.

8. He is a holy Way, all other Ways are unclean and filthy; none but holy
Persons can walk in this Way.

9. It Is a Way of God's devising and finding out.

10. It Is a costly Way: It is a cheap Way to us, but dear to God; it cost Him
the parting with his own beloved Son, and Christ the Price of his precious
Blood.

Metaphor.
I. OTher Ways lead only to external Places and Privileges.

II. Other Ways lead to a Place, but they are not that Place to which they lead.

III. Other Ways are sometimes out of Repair, and unfit for Travelers.

IV. Other Ways have no Life in them, nor cannot preserve the Traveller from
Death and Danger.

Disparity.
I. CHrist leads to the blessed, immortal, and eternal God, Heaven, and lasting
Happiness.

II. Christ and the Father are one; He is the End of a Saints Journey, Joh.
14.11. 1 John 5.7.
as well as the Father.

III. But Christ is a Way never out of Repair, nor unfit for Sinners to walk in.

IV. Christ is a living Way; He is a speaking, directing, animating, Heb. 10.2^^
and quickening Way; He preserves from Death and Danger.



Inferences.
1. BLess God for this Way. O what infinite Grace is here, that the Almighty
should be so kind and merciful to us poor Sinners, as when we had barred up our
Way to him, he should find out another for us, and be at such great charge as
to send his own Son to be the Way it self.

2. We may infer from hence, that the Salvation of the Elect is one and the
same, Jude 3.
hence called common Salvation.

3. It shows us, that there is no Salvation but by Christ.

4. It holds forth the great Necessity of the Gospel, and the Ministry thereof.

5. What a miserable Condition are all those in that reject Christ!

6. It reprehends those who hope or think to find other Ways to Heaven. The
Papists think to get thither by their own Merits, the Quakers by the Light
within, etc.

7. Labor to see a Necessity of Christ.

8. Prize Christ, O value Christ; He is All in All, He is every thing to
Believers; you can never overvalue precious Jesus.

Christ a Rock.
2 Samuel 23.3. The Rock of Israel spoke to me, etc.

Mat. 16.18. Upon this Rock will I build my Church.

1 Cor. 10.4. And that Rock was Christ.


THe Lord Jesus is compared to a Rock.

Metaphor.
I. A Rock is a firm and an immovable thing, good for a Foundation: I will
liken him unto a Man that built his House upon a Rock, Luk 6.47. Mat. 7.24.
etc. That which is built upon a Rock, stands sure in a tempestuous and stormy
Season: The Rain descended, the Floods came, and the Winds blew, and beat upon
the House, and it fell not.

II. Rocks in ancient Times were made use of for Habitations; People dwelt in
them, as well as built upon them; Isa. 22.16. Isa. 42.16. Jer. 48.28.
they hewed out Houses or Habitations in Rocks.

III. A Rock is Locus excelsus, an high Place; tho they have their Root low and
deep, yet their Tops being high and soaring, are lifted far above the Surface
of the Earth.

IV. Rocks being high, or eminent Places for Height, they are exceeding useful
to take pleasant Prospects; from hence one may see afar off: Number. 23.9
From the Tops of the Rocks I see him, says Balaam.

V. Rocks are strong, and were made use of for Defense; they are Cannon-proof;
no Fortifications like some Rocks; they are impregnable: 1 Samuel 13.6.
David for Security came into a Rock.

VI. Rocks are durable, permanent and lasting; there is no removing a Rock;
they grow not weak with Age, but continue the same from one Generation to
another.

VII. Rocks yield Honey: Out of the Rock with Honey would I have satisfied
them; Psalm. 81.16
and elsewhere it is said, He gave them Honey out of the Rock.

VIII. Rocks yield the purest Water, most pleasant Springs proceed from them.
No Water, says the Naturalist, is so clear, as that which comes percolated
through Rocks.

IX. Precious Stones and Jewels are but as it were the Sperm, the Spawn, or (as
Philosophers would have them) the Sweat of Rocks. All rich Mines of Gold and
Silver (as is evident from that in Job) are in and among Rocks.

X. Rocks yield Oil: The Rocks poured me out Rivers of Oil, Job 29.6.
says Job. And in another place it is said, God made Israel to suck Honey out
of the Stone, Deuteronomy. 32.13.
and Oil out of the hard Rock.

XI. Rocks afford a very sweet and refreshing Shadow in hot Countries, to weary
Travelers.

XII. Rocks are dangerous to stumble at, or to fall on, especially, to fall
from. When Men get up almost to the Top of a high and mighty Rock, and suddenly
through want of care fall down, such are broken to pieces, and perish
inevitably.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Christ is a firm and sure Foundation: Upon this Rock will I build
my Church, etc. Behold, Mat. 16.
I lay in Zion for a Foundation, a Stone. -- Another Foundation can no Man lay.
1 Cor.
The Church being built upon Christ, the Gates of Hell shall not prevail
against it. Whosoever lays the Stress and Structure of his Salvation upon this
Foundation, the Powers of Hell, and Rage of Devils, shall never be able to
subvert and destroy. This made the Apostle to break forth in that holy Triumph,
Romans 8. Romans 8.36


II. God in Christ is a Believer's spiritual Habitation; they, like the Dove,
Psalm. 90.1. and 91.9. 1 John 4.
make their Nest in the Clifts of the Rock. He that dwells in Love, dwells
in God.

See Habitation, Dove, etc.

III. Christ, our Rock, is high in respect of the Dignity of his Person; He is
the high God. He was lower than Men in the state of his Humiliation, yet far
higher and more glorious than the Angels. He is high in respect of his
Dewlling Place, being exalted far above all Heavens; high in respect of his
Power and Sovereignty, having absolute Dominion over Devils, Angels, and Men.

IV. He that by Faith ascends upon the Top of this spiritual Rock, may take a
better Prospect and Survey of Heaven, than Moses could of Canaan, when he stood
upon the Top of Pisgah. He sees most of God, and the Glory of the other World,
that stands upon the Rock Christ.

V. God in Christ is the Godly Man's Refuge. He that makes God his Defense, or
flies to Christ for Refuge, needs not fear Devils, nor wicked Men, Psalm. 89.26
and 94.22.
nor what all the Powers of Hell can do unto him.

See Strong-Tower.

VI. The Lord Jesus has the Stability of a Rock in him. He is the Rock of
Ages; the same yesterday, to day, and for ever; He grows not weak; as his
Years, so his Strength decays not.

VII. All sweet Peace and Comfort proceed from the Rock Christ: 2 Pet. 1.4.
Psalm. 19 10
His Promises, are sweeter than Honey, or the Honeycomb.

VIII. That celestial Stream, Spring, and River of Comfort, viz. the Spirit,
proceeds from the Throne of God, Rev. 22.1.
and the Lamb: From this Rock, says a worthy Writer, the clear and crystalline
Streams of living Water bubble forth.

IX. In Christ are hidden all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge, all the
Graces of the Spirit, (which are compared to, but far more excellent than Gold,
Pearl, or precious Stones) are only to be found in this spiritual Rock.

X. Christ affords us Store of precious Oil; the Spirit is so called, with
which the Godly are all more or less anointed: We have received an Unction from
the Holy One. No Oil like that which comes from this Rock.

XI. Christ is as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land; He keeps off all
the hot scorching Beams of the Wrath of God, and Hell.

See Apple Tree.

XII. Christ is a Rock of Offense, many stumble at him, and fall on him, and
some fall from him, whose State of all is very sad: For when Men fall from this
Rock, having gotten up very high by a speculative Knowledge and Profession, they
fall suddenly to the lowest Hell.



Metaphor.
I. ROcks, tho they abide and last long, yet are not everlasting.

II. Rocks in many respects are barren, useless, and unprofitable things, yield
no Fruit; Seed that falls upon a Rock comes to no maturity: Some fell upon a
Rock, etc.

III. Rocks are part of the coursest and grossest Element; they are but Earth,
condensed and congealed into a massy senseless Lump.

Disparity.
I. CHrist abides for ever and ever, he being styled the Rock of Ages.

II. Christ, the spiritual Rock, is very fruitful, and every way exceeding
profitable.

III. Christ is of the highest and best of Beings, He that made and formed the
Elements, and gave being to all Creatures and Things, who, tho called a Rock,
yet is the Lord from Heaven, and a quickening Spirit.



Inferences.
1. TAke heed Christ be not unto you a Stumbling-Stone, and Rock of Offense.

2. Let the Godly, who dwell in this Rock, fear no Evil; their Rock is not like
our Rock.

3. Get into this Rock, be like the Dove, that makes her Nest besides the Holes
Mouth.

4. When you are down in the Valley, and the Waters swell, and threaten to
overflow you, get with David by Faith and Prayer upon the Rock that is higher
than you.

5. Prize the Rock; precious Water, Honey, and Oil flow from it. 1. It Is a rich
Rock. 2. It Is a living Rock. 3. It Is an invincible Rock. 4. It Is a feeding and
fattening Rock. 5. It Is a Rock of Pearls and Diamonds. 6. It Is an eternal Rock.

6. When you see a great Rock, think of Christ.

7. Build all your Hopes of Happiness upon it; let your Anchor be so cast, as
to take hold of this Rock.

Christ a Fountain.
Jer. 2.13. They have forsaken me, the Fountain of living Water, etc.

Zech. 13.1. In that Day there shall be a Fountain opened, etc.


AMong the many Things that Christ is compared to in the holy Scripture, to set
forth his transcendent Excellency, Beauty, Usefulness, and Perfections, this of
a Fountain is none of the least, it being a most profitable Metaphor.

Metaphor.
I. A Fountain is the Spring and Head of a River; Venning.
from thence Waters issue and stream forth: It Is the Rise and Beginning of
Springs and Waters. Genesis 7.11.


II. A Fountain implies Abundance of Water: I will open Fountains in the midst
of the Valleys, Isa. 41.18.
-- that is, Fullness or Store of Water; it denotes Plenty.

III. A Fountain is very tenacious, a Place fit, dense, hard, and well-compact,
to retain the Water, leaving some certain Passage, for to let its Water out in
an orderly manner.

IV. A Fountain, when the Passage or Vent is open, lets out its Water freely.

V. Fountains always empty themselves into low Places; they love to glide in
the Valleys of the Earth: He sends his Springs into the Valleys. Psalm. 104.10.


VI. Fountains, by letting out their Water into Valleys, Meadows, and low
Ground, make them very fruitful, when Mountains, and high Grounds abide barren
and unprofitable.

VII. Fountain Water is usually common to all the Poor, and he that has no
Money may partake of it; none are forbid to come to a Fountain.

VIII. Fountains yield pure and unmixed Water. Streams are sometimes muddy,
they may be defiled; but Fountain Water is clear, fair, and without Filth.

IX. Many Fountains are deep, Men may swim in them; it is hard to find a Bottom.

X. Fountains are pleasant and delightful to behold; it is a lovely thing to
see, and abide by Fountains of Water; they beautify and adorn a Place, and make
it much more pleasant and desirable. Hence Fountains, or Pools of Water,
Solomon reckons up as one of the Delights of the Sons of Men. Eccles. 2.6.


XI. Fountains are Places good to wash and bath in, and have been made use of
in former Times upon that account.

XII. Fountains do not send out sweet Water and bitter, nor fresh and salt;
that which is good, and bad, Jam. 3.12.
proceed not from the same Fountain.

XIII. Fountains are sufficient to fill many great and small Vessels; those
that go thither may take what they need, yea, fill their Vessels to the Brim,
and not diminish of its Fullness.

XIV. A Fountain is constant in its emanations, or continual runnings, and
flowings forth.

XV. Many in former Times used to drink out of their Fountains.

XVI. Fountains have Springs in themselves, says an eminent Writer, and can
never be emptied. Streams may be dried up, Cisterns may be broken, and let the
Water run out; but the Water in a Fountain abides the same, and is lasting.

Parallel.
I. FRom GOD, as from a Fountain, that great and glorious River of the Spirit
flows; it proceeds out of the Throne of God, and the Lamb. Rev. 22.1.
Hence Christ is compared to a Fountain, Jer. 2.13.
as well as the Father. He is the Spring and Rise of all Spiritual Joy and
Consolation, the Head of all the Waters of Life: With thee is the Well (or
Fountain) of Life. Psalm. 36.9.


II. Christ has Abundance, yea, a Fullness, all Fullness of Grace and the Spirit
is in him, he received it not by measure. J^^h. 1.14, 16. Ephesians. 1 22, 23.
He is given to be the Head ^^ver all things to the Church, which is his Body,
the Fullness of Him that fills all things. There is Abundance, nay, a
Redundancy of all Divine Grace, Peace, and Refreshment, in the Lord Jesus, an
Ocean or Sea of Goodness.

III. As the Lord Jesus contains, so he retains the Waters of Life in himself.
He is a spiritual Fountain, every way fit, and well-compact, (in respect of
that glorious Union of the two Natures in one Person) to retain all heavenly
Fullness; and has ordered certain Passages, as Conduit-Pipes, viz. Ordinances
and Promises; which through the help of the Spirit lets out Divine Grace and
Comfort, in a gracious and orderly manner, to all his Saints.

IV. Christ is a Fountain opened. Zech. 13.^^.
He has made a Passage or Vent, by assuming Man's Nature, and dying on the
Cross, to let out his Grace and spiritual Blessings to the Sons of Men. And
with what natural Freeness does this Fountain run! He seems restless, always
diffusing, imparting, and giving forth from Himself, to all thirsty Souls:
Whoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely. Rev. 2^^.17


V. Jesus Christ fills the humble Soul with Goodness; He delights in the
lowly Heart. The lofty mountainous Spirits, or dry heathy Souls, retain not the
Water of Life; 1 Cor. 2.14. Jam. 4.6.
they cannor receive the things of the Spirit. He resists the Proud, but
gives Grace to the Humble.

VI. Jesus Christ, by letting forth his Spirit, and heavenly Grace, into the
humble and lowly Heart, makes it very fruitful in Holiness and good Works. The
Churches of Christ, like low Meadows, near the Fountain, whose Waters
continually flow, are always green and flourishing, and know no Drought; when
the Wicked, like Hills and dry Ground, are barren and unprofitable.

VII. The Waters of Life, which flow from Jesus Christ, the Divine Fountain,
are common to all. None are forbid to come to Christ. The Poor, and He that
has no Money, Isa. 54.1.
(no Worth or Righteousness in him) is invited to come to these Waters.

VIII. The Water in this spiritual Fountain, Christ, is pure, Rev. 22.1, 2.
clear as Crystal; there is no Mud, nor the least mixture of any Defilement in
it. Men have endeavored to foul and pollute the Doctrine of Christ, and his
Ordinances, which flowed from him; but Truth in it self, in the Fountain, is
still the same, and cannot be corrupted.

IX. Jesus Christ is a deep Fountain. We read of the deep Things of God;
Christ's Riches are said to be unsearchable; There are such Depths of Mercy and
Goodness in Christ, that none can find a bottom. His Love and Grace is very
wonderful.

X. Christ is a delightful and pleasant Object. There is no Fountain so lovely
to the sensual Eye, as Christ is to the Eye of Faith. He is called a Fountain
of Gardens, or the Garden swelling-Fountain, or Fountain of the Gardens,
Ainsworth Cant. 4.15.
as Mr. Ainsworth reads it. The Church is a Garden, Christ is the Fountain that
waters it; and how pleasant is a Fountain in a Garden! Psalm. 16.11 Psalm. 36.8,
9.
At his right hand there are Pleasures for evermore. -- And thou shall make
them drink of the Rivers of thy Pleasure.

XI. Christ is the Souls only Bath; in this Fountain Sinners must wash, if ever
they would be clean: It Is his Blood that cleanses us from all Sin; hence he is
said to be a Fountain opened for Sin and for Uncleanness. 1 J^^h. 1 7. Zech.
13.1.


XII. There is nothing unsavory in Christ, nothing bitter nor brackish in him;
whatsoever flows from this Fountain is sweet and good; every drop of this Water
is as sweet as Honey.

XIII. Christ is able and sufficient to fill and satisfy all the Hearts and
Souls of Men and Women that come unto him. Believers may have here what they
really want, and yet diminish not from Christ's Fullness.

XIV. Jesus Christ, the heavenly Fountain, has never ceased running from the
beginning of the World; his Goodness always flows forth, from one Generation to
another.

XV. If any Man (says Christ) be thirsty, let him come unto me, and drink.
Joh. 7.37.


XVI. The Riches and Treasures of Christ are inexhaustible. He is always full:
He has Springs in himself, and can never be emptied, nor dried up. As for
quantity, so for quality, this Fountain is ever the same, never loses its
lively Virtue and Efficacy; the Watees that flow from hence, have the same
Operation that ever they had.



Prophet.
I. FOuntains are beholden to some other Thing (as the Sea, Springs, and
Vapors) for their Waters; the Rise and Original of their Waters is not from
themselves.

II. Fountains only contain earthly and elementary Water.

III. Other Fountains cannot heal Distempers or Diseases of the Soul; but few
have that virtue in them as to heal the Body.

IV. Fountains cannot give Life, tho they may help to preserve and maintain it.

V. He that drinks of the Water of other Fountains may thirst again.

VI. Other Fountains may be filled and stopped up, as the Well that Abraham's
Servants dug; or however the Streams may be stayed.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ is God, and as so considered has all Fullness originally and
independently in Himself, being Superintendent over all Creatures, He that made
Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and Fountains of Water.

II. Christ is a Fountain that contains spiritual Water, of a most divine and
sublime Nature.

III. Jesus Christ is the Fountain that heals all Diseases, both of Body and
Soul. It Is opened for Sin, and Uncleanness, of the inward Man more especially.

IV. Christ gives Life to Men, yea, a threefold Life: 1. Natural Life. 2. A
Spiritual Life. 3. Eternal Life. He raises from the Dead, and quickens whom he
will; hence called our Life. Col. 3.3^^.


V. But he that drinks of the Water that flows from Christ, Joh. 4.14.
this living Fountain, shall thirst no more.

VI. Christ cannot fail of his Fullness; What is meant by thirsting no more, is
opened elsewhere.
He cannot be stopp'p up by the Skill of Men nor Devils; nay, none can hinder
the glorious Streams that flow from Him from watering and refreshing his People.



Inferences.
I. WE may infer from hence, That Sin is of an heinous and defiling Nature;
it is called here Uncleanness, and such Uncleanness that is not easily washed
off.

II, Behold the exceeding Greatness of God's Love, and of the Love of Christ,
to polluted Mankind, in providing such a Fountain to wash their Souls, their
defiled Souls in.

III. Be sure, that God's People shall never want sufficient Means for inward
cleansing and purification.

IV. How inexcusable are those that die in their Filthiness under the Gospel?
If Naaman, after the Prophet directed him to wash in Jordan, had returned
without washing, who would have pitied him if he had died a Leper? Sinner, who
will pity thee, if thou refusest to wash and (...) clean?

V. Let polluted and unclean Sinners come to this Fountain, and for their
further encouragement, observe these following Motives and Considerations.

1. There is abundance of Filth in thy Heart and Life, which must be purged and
washed away, or thou must perish.

Heb. 1.3. Joh. 17. Rev. 15.
2. There is no Fountain can wash away thy Sin but this; all Soul-cleansing is
by Christ's Blood. All the Legal Purifications pointed to the spiritual
Purgation by Christ's Blood: the like does Baptismal Washing; the outward
Washing of the Body, signifies the inward Washing by Faith in this Fountain.

Isa. 53.4, 5. Romans 3.24 1 Cor. 1.2.
3. This Fountain can wash and heal thee, whatever thy Uncleanness and Sickness
is; it cleanses from the Guilt of Sin, and from the Filth of Sin also.

4. This Fountain is opened; which Expression signifies, (1.) The Willingness
of Christ to accept and embrace poor Sinners. (2.) It shows the Clearness of
Gospel-Revelation, above the Legal. Non dubito, etc. says Calvin: I do not
doubt but by this word he shows the Differences between Law and Gospel: Christ
was a Fountain for Sin under the Law; but he was as it were a sealed Fountain,
or hid and veiled under many Types, Shadows, and Ceremonial Washings; the Stone
is now removed, that lay upon the Mouth of the Well. (3.) It shows the
Readiness and Easiness of Access, which is afforded to poor Sinners to come to
Christ.

5. Consider the Multitude of Sinners that have been cleansed by Christ.

6. Consider the Multitude of Sins in every one Sinner washed away.

7. Consider the happy State of all such as are made clean.

8. Thou know not how soon this Fountain may be shut up as to thee.

Caution. Take heed of slighting and undervaluing of the Fountain of Christ's
Blood. What do they less than slight it, who think they can get cleansing from
Sin by the Light within? What do the Papists less, who have other Purgations,
who go to their Mass, and call that a propitiatory Sacrifice; who go to the
Merits of their own Works, thinking thereby to expiate Sin, and purchase God's
Favor? What do all such else, that rely upon the Mercy of God without having
an eye and respect to Christ's Blood? What do all those less, that never come,
tho very guilty and unclean, and often invited to this Fountain? Let the
opening of this Fountain move thee to open thy Heart.

Exhort. To love him who has washed thee, to be thankful, to believe, to be
humble, and deny thy self. When ever thou see a Fountain of Water, think upon
Christ, the spiritual Fountain.

Consolat. Here is Comfort, a Fountain of Comfort for poor Saints: Thou have a
bitter Fountain in thee; here is a sweet one to cleanse thee: Thou have a
filthy Fountain; here is a clear and crystal one, to bathe and wash thee.
Christ is more able to cleanse, than Sin is to defile. Dare thou say, that
thy Filth is greater than this Fountain can wash away? O Soul, Christ can wash
the Black-Moor white. Remember, whatever Satan says, this Fountain is open.

Christ the Head,
Col. 2.19. Not holding the Head.


THe Son of God is very often in the holy Scriptures called an Head, and may be
so for diverse Considerations:

1. In respect of Angels, Ephesians. 1.21.
He is the Head of all Principalities and Powers.

2. In respect of Man, the whole Race of Man; 1 Cor. 11.3
the Head of every Man is Christ.

3. In respect of the Powers of the World; He is the Head of Kings and Princes,
and all the Powers of the Earth.

4. He is the Head of the Gospel-Building: Acts 4.11.
The Stone which the Builders rejected, the same is become the Head-Stone of
the Corner.

5. He is the Head of the Body, the Church, Ephesians. 1.22.
which alludes to a natural Head, and does agree therewith in diverse respects;
of which take these Examples. Col. 1.18.


Metaphor.
I. THe Head is the highest part of the Body, more loftily placed than all the
rest of the Members.

II. The Head is the Seat of the Senses. There is the Eye to see, the Ear to
Ear, the Organs to smell and taste, by which things are truly distinguished,
even the good from the bad, for the benefit of the whole Body.

III. The Head is the common Treasury of the whole Man; whatsoever comes is
lodged there, for the rest of the Members.

IV. The Head does transmit, or cause to be transmitted, by way of
communication, all the Supplies accruing to all other parts of the Body,
whether it be Ease from Pain, by Application of Comfort, etc.

V. The Head is the very Fountain of Strength, and cunning Policy, so signified
concerning the Serpent: He shall bruise thy Head, etc.

Genesis 3 17
VI. The Head is the Place where Burdens are carried, etc. Three Baskets were
on the Baker's Head. Genesis 40.16


VII. The Head is the Seat of Sorrow; there it is received and centered. Genesis
42 38


VIII. The Head receives the Hand of Blessing from the Father. Genesis 48.18


IX. The Head receives the Consecration of God, both in case of Nazarite and
High Priest. Lev. 31.10 Number. 6.7.
The anointing with Oil (or the holy Unction) was upon the Head, whereby the
whole Man became sanctified, and set apart for God.

X. The Head bears the Glory, whether it be the holy Mitre, and sacred Crown,
Ezekiel. 29.6.
appertaining to the Priest; Psalm. 21.3.
or the Royal Diadem appertaining to Secular Princes, and Crown of Gold.

XI. The Head is the principal Object of Envy and Fury, most threatened and
struck at, and receives the Signs of Death. Jezebel threatened the Head of
Elisha; 2 Kin. 6.31
the Wife of Heber struck at the Head of Sisera. Judge. 5.26
The Beast appointed for Sin-Offering was to have hands laid upon the Head;
Rev. 4.4, 15, 24, 29, 33.
this was a Sign of Death.

XII. The Head is the Subject of Humility. When Men have been much affected
with some great Thing, they put Earth upon their Heads. 1 Samuel 4.12.


XIII. But notwithstanding all, the Head is the Glory of the Man.

XIV. The Head shows the greatest Signs of Pity and Sympathy to the poor,
distressed, and afflicted Members.

XV. The Head is the governing Part of the whole Man; the Eyes, the Ears, the
Hands, the Feet, are all governed by the Head.

XVI. The Head loves the Body that belongs to it, and is concerned night and
day for its Prosperity.

XVII. The Head receives Reverence and Respect, Love and Honor, from the
Body, and the Members.

Parallel.
I. THe Son of God, as he was higher by Birth than Men, yea, than the greatest
of Men, Kings, and mighty Potentates of the Earth, etc. so is he by Place and
Office: God has anointed him with the Oil of Gladness above all his Fellows,
Heb. 1.9.
and set him over the Works of his Hands.

II. The Son of God, the mystical or spiritual Head, is the Seat of the
spiritual Senses. There is the clear seeing Eye, the perfect hearing Ear, the
pure, true, and infallible Taste, by which Things are distinguished aright, the
good from the bad, for the benefit of the whole Body the Church.

III. Jesus Christ, as a public Person, and Head of his Church, is
Receiver-General, and common Treasury of the whole Body. Whatsoever came
originally from God, for the Good and Benefit of the Church, is lodged in
Christ as Mediator, and Head of his Church. As David said, Psalm. 82.7.
All my Springs are in thee; so may the Church say of Christ, We beheld his
Glory, as the Glory of the only begotten Son of God, full of Grace and Truth.
It pleased the Father, Joh. 1.14. Col. 1.19.
that in him should all Fullness dwell.

IV. The Son of God does transmit, or cause to be transmitted, by way of
communication, all the Supplies of the Mystical Body, whether it be Peace of
Conscience, Ease for Soul-pains, by an Application of his Blood, and Spirit to
comfort. It Is by Him, that the whole Body, Col. 2.19.
by Joints and Bonds, have Nourishment administered one to another, as knit
together in all parts, and increasing with the Increase of God: Of his Fullness
we all receive, and Grace for Grace. Joh. 1.16.


V. The Son of God is the Fountain of Strength to his Church; it is said, All
Power is given to him. I can do all things, Mat. 28.18. Phil. 4.13.
through Christ that strengthens me.

VI. Jesus Christ was a Man of Labor, that carried our Burdens for us in
Divine respects: The Burden of Temptations from Satan and the World fell upon
him; the Burden of Persecution, even to Death it self. The Lord laid on him
the Iniquities of us all. Isa. 53.6


VII. The Lord Jesus was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief. Isa. 53,
3, 4.
There was no Sorrow like his, it was heaped upon him even to perfection.

VIII. The Lord Jesus is the Man of God's Right Hand, made strong for Himself,
upon whom the Blessing is conferred by the Father, as a Token of Good to the
whole Church: In Him all the Families of the Earth are blessed. Ephesians. 3.15.


IX. Christ, the holy and spiritual Head, received the Consecration of God; for
he was filled with the Holy Ghost from the Womb, and as a perfect Nazarite
continued separate till his Baptism, at which time the holy Anointing being
upon him in a visible manner, did furnish him for his Ministry, and fit him to
be a Priest unto God; this holy Unction descended on him, as it did on the Head
of Aaron, not only drenching his Beard, but all the parts of his Body also,
even to the Skirts of his Garment. Say ye of him whom the Father sanctifies,
and sends into the World, etc. Who through the eternal Spirit offered himself
to God.

X. The Son of God not only bears the Glory of Priesthood, but the highest
Glory of his Father's House, which consists of Kingship, etc. Thou art a Priest
for ever, etc. We see Jesus made a little lower than the Angels, Heb. 2.7* 9
etc. crowned with Glory and Honor.

XI. Christ was the principal Object of Envy and Hatred. The Devil envied him,
the Jews hated him without cause, Herod threatened him. One while they waited to
kill him* at another time they led him to the Brow of the Hill, that they might
cast him down headlong to destroy him. At last they came and laid their hands
upon him in the Garden, where he received the Sign of Death, after his most
bitter Agony; and was soon after offered up on the Cross, as a public
Sacrifice: He died for our Sins, according to the Scriptures. Christ our
Passover is sacrificed for us.

XII. The Lord Jesus was a Subject of great Humility, much affected with God's
Providence, and Men's Wickednesses. He wept when Lazarus died. Christ wept,
when the Jews rejected him to their own Destruction; and, Luke 19.41
as Publius Lettius says of him, he was never seen to laugh, but often to
weep. The Devil, Herod, Pontius Pilate, with the Jews, were not content to
persecute and drive the Son of God to Corners; but after they had agreed with
Judas to betray him, they endeavored, as much as lay in them, to take this
blessed Head off from his Mystical Body; nothing would satisfy them, till they
had slain the Lord of Life and Glory.

XIII. And so is Jesus Christ the Glory of God, the Glory of the Church. She
glories in Him: His Head is as the most fine Gold: He is altogether lovely.
Cant. 5.1^^
This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend, O Daughters of Jerusalem.

XIV. Christ, being in all things like unto us, Sin only excepted, has showed
no small Signs of Pity and Sympathy, as one touched with our Infirmities, as
appears both before he left the World, and since. 1. He comforts them by good
Words and Promises; Joh. 14. Joh. 16. Joh. 17. Acts 19*
he will not leave them comfortless, but will come to them. 2. He assures,
that he would send another Comforter, the holy Spirit. 3. He prays the Father
to take them into his Care and Protection. 4. He cries out from Heaven, when
Violence is offered to them: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? etc.

XV. The Son of God, as Head of the Church, has the Government on his
Shoulders; his Members hear his Voice, and keep his Commandments, and his
Commandments are not grievous unto them.

XVI. Jesus Christ loves his Church, yea, all his Members. He died to save and
redeem them, he shed his Blood to wash and sprinkle them, and went to Heaven to
prepare a Place for them, and is concerned both night and day for their
Prosperity and Welfare; he will come again from thence to solemnize the
glorious Marriage, and receive them unto himself, that where he is, there they
may be also. Rev. 1.5.
I love them that love me. He gave himself, that he might redeem us from all
Iniquity. He has loved us, and washed us from our Sins with his own Blood. I
go to prepare a Place for you. If I go away, I will come again, and receive you
unto my Father, that where I am, you may be also.

XVII. The Son of God receives Reverence and Respect, Love and Honor, from
the Church, and all its Members, when others despise him, and account him an
Impostor and Deceiver. But the Church says, He is the Son of God, both Lord and
Christ, Lord of Glory, Lord of all the Princes of this Life, the Head of
Angels, the choicest and chiefest of Ten Thousand: Whom having not seen, they
love; and tho now they see him not, yet believing, 1 Pet. 1.8.
they rejoice with Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory. He is precious in their
Esteem; his Name is as Ointment poured forth.



Metaphor.
I. THe natural Head is joined but to one numerical and physical Body.

II. The natural Head is joined to the physical Body, by fleshly Bonds and
Ligaments; Veins and Sinews, Nerves and Arteries, etc.

III. The natural Head is sometimes sick, being liable to many Distempers of
very dangerous consequence, as Apoplexies, etc. and being so, it cannot help
the Body.

IV. A natural Head does many times fall asleep, and so becomes unsensible, and
incapable of securing its Body and Members, at that juncture of Time.

V. A natural Head is weak, and wants Help it self; for there is no Man so
wise, but may receive Additions from others, and does so in all Arts and
Sciences: yea the Angels themselves have made known to them by the Church, the
manifold Wisdom of God, and are in some respects charged with Folly.

VI. A natural Head may afford some small help to the Body, but cannot bless
what it affords.

VII. A natural Head may be broken, dashed in pieces, and lose its Power of
helping the Body and Members.

VIII. A natural Head may dye and lie by the Walls, where is then its Help.

Disparity.
I. THe Son of God, the mystical Head, is joined to many numerical and physical
Bodies: He is not only Head of Angels, even of all Principalities and Powers,
but of all Men in some sense; and to the Church, and every true Member thereof,
in a more special and peculiar sense: I would have you to know, that the Head
of every Man is Christ, and he is the Head of the Church, the Fullness of him
that fills all in all.

II. Jesus Christ is joined to the mystical Head, by spiritual and more lasting
Bonds; as the Bond of voluntary Choice, of Promise, and invisible Union. Ye
have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. Because I live, you shall live also,
that they also may be one, at thou, O Father, and I am one. I in them, and thou
in me, that they may be made perfect in one.

III. The Son of God is never sick, but always in a capacity, not only to help
his sick Body on Earth, but also against all Diseases; much more permanent than
the Angels of God, dwelling where Sickness cannot approach: Neither shall there
be any more Sickness or Pain.

IV. But the Son of God is the Angel of God's Presence, and made the Keeper of
Israel, who neither slumbers, nor sleeps.

V. The Son of God is not weak, wants no Help from other Men, in respect of any
Arts or Sciences whatsoever: for if the first Adam had such strength of Wisdom
and Knowledge as to give Names to all things suitable to their Natures, who was
but earthly; much more the second Adam, who was the Lord from Heaven. In whom
are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge.

VI. The Son of God cannot only afford suitable Help to the Body, and Members,
but can bless the Help to them, bless Society and Communion, bless Word and
Sacraments, bless Lenitives and Corrosives, Romans 8.28.
Rod and Staff, make all things work together for good.

VII. The Son of God though he was hard laid to, and much struck at, by the
Powers of Darkness, yet could they never reach high enough to break his Head,
to dash him and destroy his Power, (to help his People in time of need) but
were destroyed themselves in the very Attempt; He spoiled Principalities. Whosoever
shall fall upon this Head of the Corner, Genesis 3.15.
shall be broken to pieces. He bruised the Head of the Combatant.

VIII. The Son of God has passed through the Gates of Death, has conquered
him that had the Power of Death, and can never dye, Death has no more Dominion
over Him: He ever lives to make Intercession for the Saints: lives for evermore.



Inferences.
1. THis shows the great Love and Goodness of God in giving such a Head.

2. The great Love of Christ, and his wonderful Condescension in stooping so
low, as to become a Head to poor Mortals.

3. What a happy Condition the Church and Members of Christ are in. (1.)
Interrested in the same Love with the Head. (2.) Under the same degree of
Election with the Head. (3.) Allied to the same Relations, interested in the
same Riches, and assured by Membership of the same Life and Immortality in the
World to come: Because I live you shall live also.

4. Affords a very great motive to all Men to seek Union and Membership with
him, because as he is, so shall they be also hereafter in the next State; When
he shall appear, we shall be like him. 1 J^^h. 3.2


Christ a Garment for Sanctification.
Romans 13. ult. But put ye on the Lord Jesus, and make no Provision for the
Flesh, etc.


IN this Text are two Parts: 1. An Act. 2. An Object.


I. An Act, (...), it is a Metaphor taken from putting on of Garments, a Phrase
used by the Apostle often in reference to the New Man, Ephesians. 4.24. In reference
to the Spiritual Armor, Ephesians. 6.11. In reference to Acts of Mercy, Col. 3.12.
And here, in reference to the Application of Jesus Christ, in respect of
Sanctification. From the scope of the Text it is evident the Apostle intends
Gospel Holiness, he presses the Saints at Rome to a godly Life, and not only to
walk holily, but to draw all Power of holy walking from Christ, so as to be
clothed with the Virtues and Graces of his Spirit.

Metaphor.
I. GArments are for the covering of the Body, they hide Nakedness and
Deformity.

II. Garments come not naturally, but are prepared and made fit for us.

III. Garments are worn only in some Countries by civilized Nations and People;
some Barbarian, and Heathenish Men and Women go naked in some Nations.

IV. Before new Garments can be put on, the old, defiled, and overworn Garments
must be put off.

V. Garments are of great Utility in respect of Defense, they secure us from
the pricks and scratches of Bushes and Thorns, and from many bruises and rubs
and other hurts, which Nakedness exposes to.

VI. Garments are for keeping of the Body warm: (what should we do who live in
cold Countries were for it not Clothes and useful Garments) she is not fearful
of the Snow, for all her Household are clothed in Scarlet.

VII. Garments tend to the preservation of Health; the neglect of putting them
on, many times brings Sickness, sometimes death.

VIII. Garments are used for Distinction, as:

1. They distinguish one Sex from another, the Man* shall not put on the
Apparel which appertains to the Woman.

2. Garments also distinguish the several Ranks and Qualities of of Men, those
that are clothed in soft Raiment are in Kings Houses. Mat. 11.8.


3. By the Habit or Garment we do distinguish the People of one Nation from
another. Z^^ph. 1.8.


IX. Garments are of a comfortable and refreshing Nature, and of excellent use
to them who put them on.

X. Garments answer not their End in making, neither are they of use till put
on.

XI. Some sorts of Garments were Significations of Grief and Sorrow. Mordecai
put on Sackcloath, so in Joel 1.13.

XII. Garments were also used to testify Joy; as appears in the Case of the
Prodigal: Isa. 61.10, 11. Luke 15.22.
Bring forth the best Robes and put on, and put a Ring on his Finger.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus Christ is a Cover for the Soul, every Man's Nakedness and
Deformity appears that has not on this Spiritual Garment. Rev. 3.17.


II. Naturally we have no Righteousness, that is either accepted of God, or a
suitable Cover for the Soul, Romans 3.12.
this Spiritual Garment is wrought by the Spirit, Psalm. 45.13, 14.
and made fit for us.

III. The Lord Christ is put on for a Garment or spiritual Clothing, by those
Nations and People only, Mat. 7.13, 14. Luke 12.22.
where Christianity is received, and not by many there neither, some are like
Brutes and Hethenish People, naked, without Christ and true Holiness.

IV. Before a Man can put on the Lord Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 4.22, 23, 24. Col. 3.8.
and be clothed with the Garment of Holiness, he must put off the abominable
filthy Cloaks, and Covers of Wickedness, he must be stripped of his filthy Rags,
that he may be clothed with the Spirit and Graces of Christ, Put off the
former Conversation, the Old Man, and put on the New Man, which after God is
created in Righteousness and true Holiness.

V. By putting on of Christ in a way of Faith and Holiness, Acts 24* 16.
the Soul is defended, from the cheeks and smarting pricks of Conscience, Ephesians.
6 22. 2 Cor. 3.6.
from the fiery Darts of Satan, and from the killing Power of the Law and the
Wrath of God.

VI. This blessed Garment keeps the Soul warm; hereby Saints become fervent in
Spirit and zealously affected. If we have any spiritual Heat in us, we must
attribute it to Christ: naturally we are as cold as that Child was when his
Spirit was departed. 2 Kings 4.24.

VII. The Graces of Christ and true Holiness are the only Preservative of the
inward Man from spiritual Sickness: by putting him on, and leading of a holy
Life, we abide in Health: Ps^^l. 119.11. Romans ^^ 13
and those who neglect to put on these Garmens, are exposed to all manner of
Scu^^-Diseases, which end in eternal Death.

VIII. This spiritual Garment makes a Distinction:

1. Holiness distinguishes Believers from Unbelievers, the Godly from the
Wicked: 2 Cor. 5.17.
Who has made thee to differ from another? If a Man be in Christ, he is a new
Creature.

2. This Glorious Garment shows that the Righteous are more excellent than
their Neighbor: as it was said of Jabush, Prove. 12.26. 1 Cor. 4 9, 10.
he was more Honorable than his Brethren; it makes appear the Godly are Kings
Children, having Princely Robes upon them.

3. By a holy Christ-like Conversation, the People and Saints of God are known
to be People of another Country, Citizens of another City, Joh. 13.35. Joh. 15
19.
Ye are not of this World.

IX. This spiritual Garment is of a most excellent, sweet, comforting and
refreshing Quality, the Virtue whereof is not, cannot be felt nor apprehended
by Unbelievers.

X. Men put not Christ to that use for which he came into the World, till they
put him on for Sanctification and Holiness, neither will he be otherwise of
saving Benefit unto them; Ti^^. 2.14. Joh. 3.36. Heb. 12.14
He that believes not shall not see Life; Without Holiness no Man shall see
God.

XI. Such as have put on this Garment, do abundantly demonstrate their great
Sorrow and Grief for Sin; 2 Cor. 7.10. Joh. 16.20. 1 Pet. 5.5.
Godly Sorrow works Repentance, yea shall be sorrowful: All such as put on
Christ for Sanctification, are clothed with Humility.

XII. Such who are clothed with the Robes of Righteousness, have on them the
beautiful Garments of Salvation; Isa. 61.10, 11. 2 Cor. 6.10. 1 These. 5.16.
Phil. 4.4.
which signifies, that they above all; have cause to rejoice; hence, says the
Apostle, As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; Rejoice in the Lord always, and
again, I say, rejoice.



Metaphor.
I. MAterial Garments are made by Man.

II. Other Garments consist of Matter, and are of such or such external Shape,
according to the Party for whom they are made.

III. Other Garments may be bought with Money, and those likely who have most of
it, have the best Robes.

IV. Material Garments render a Man or Woman amiable only in the sight of Man,
etc.

V. Other Garments are the worse for wearing, by long and often using they will
decay.

VI. Other Garments at certain Times are to be put off, or may be changed; As
light or thin Garments for Summer, and more substantial for Winter, etc.

VII. A Man may part with, or dispose of other Garments at his Pleasure as he
thinks fit, to his Friends, or to such as want Clothes.

Disparity.
I. THis Garment of Holiness is wrought by the Spirit of God.

II. This Garment consists of Grace, Divine Virtues, and Spiritual
Qualifications.

III. This Garment may be had without Money or Price; it is true, Christ speaks
of buying etc. white Raiment, That buying, is free receiving: The Porphet
explains this Phrase, Isa. 55.1. No Man has any thing of worth or value to
give for it; the Gift of God cannot be purchased with Money, the poor in Spirit
are better clothed than the rich.

IV. This Garment renders a Man or Woman lovely in the sight of God. The
Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit is in the sight of God of great Price. 1
Pet. 3.4.


V. This Garment the more and longer it is used, the better and more excellent
it is; Heb. 5.14. 2 Cor. 7.1.
Use makes perfect in Godliness as well as in other Cases.

VI. This Garment, (viz.) the Robe of Righteousness, is never to be changed nor
put off Day nor Night, Winter nor Summer; we ought to be good and virtuous in
Sickness and Health at all times, in Prosperity and Adversity; it is good always
to be zealously affected in a good thing. Gal. 4.18.


VII. This Garment, Christ and Holiness, as a Man cannot dispose of it unto
others, so he ought not. No Man has so much Grace as to furnish his Friend
with it; the Wise Virgins had no Oil to give to the Foolish: What thou have
already, Mat. 25.9. Rev. 2.25.
hold fast till I come.



Inferences.
I. WE may from hence admire the Excellencies of the Lord Jesus Christ, he is
Life, he is Meat, hidden Manna, he is Drink; yea he is all in all, and provides
all for Believers.

II. It shows the miserable State of those that are without true Holiness, such
are naked. Now a naked Man is exposed to the Reproach of every Eye, his Shame
appears to all, Nakedness lays open to every Storm, every Shower wets, Thorns
prick them; piercing and nipping Winds make those that are naked to shrink. The
unconverted Sinner has the continual Pricks and Terror of his own Conscience,
and shall thereby be filled with Horror and Shame; much more when the Arrows of
the Wrath of God begin to fly about his Ears.

III. This demonstrates, that wicked Men are mad, or besides themselves. None
but distracted and barbarous Men reject Clothing. Sinners will have none of
Christ, tho they are naked without him; they will not put him on, will not be
persuaded to cover their Shame, turn from their evil Ways, and accept of a Robe
of Righteousness.

IV. Observe, that none are so well clothed, so richly arrayed, as Believers,
as the Godly and Faithful in Christ Jesus.

V. Here is good News for the Poor, and such as are naked; here is a glorious
Garment ready, if they will put it on.

VI. That the Ungodly would be persuaded to put on Christ.

Quest. But some may say, What is it to put on Christ?

Answ. 1. Christ is to be put on for Justification; but in that sense those
Saints at Rome had put him on before.

2. Christ is to be put on by way of Imitation; this refers to Sanctification:
We must follow his Example in his holy and gracious Life; See Christ the Saints
Wedding Garment.
we must apply his Righteousness for our Justification by Faith, and walk by
the glorious Pattern he has left, to teach us to express his Virtues and
Excellencies in a course of Sanctification, and new Obedience. If Christ be not
put on in both these respects, he will profit none to Salvation.

VII. What will become of them, who instead of putting Christ on, and following
of him, put the Devil on; and instead of expressing his Excellencies, they
express the Vices of the Devil, and Abominations of their own base Hearts?

VIII. From hence let Saints be cautionated, from defiling of their Garments; a
small Spot is quickly seen in a white Vesture. Those only who defile not their
Garments, shall walk with Christ in white. Rev. 3.4.


Lastly; Let all take heed to keep their Garments, for otherwise Men will at
one time or other see their Shame. Rev. 16.15


Christ a Lamb.
Joh. 1.36. Behold the Lamb of God!

1 Pet. 1.19. As a Lamb without blemish, etc.

Rev. 14.11. I beheld, and lo a Lamb stood upon Mount Zion, etc.


IN the two first Texts the Greek Word is (...), compounded of a privativo, and
(...), robur, which signifies Strength; that is, Liegh.
not strong. The Article (as Erasmus has observed out of Chrysostom and
Theophylact) is emphatical, distinguishing him from the Typical Lamb; and
denotes also Relation, for it puts in mind of the Prophecies of Esaias, and
others, used Acts 32. The word in Rev. 14.1. is (...), which is a Diminutive of
(...), and signifies Agnellus, a little Lamb, Gent. in Harm.
tener adhuc and immaturus, tender, etc. John 21.15.

Christus vocatur Agnus propter immolationem pro peccatis totius mundi factam,
quam ut Typi praefigurarunt Agni in V. T. immolait; tum propter mansu^^tudinem,
patientiam, innocentiam, beneficentiam, etc. Glassius.
How, and in what respects Christ may be called a Lamb, follows.

Metaphor.
I. THe Lamb is a very innocent and harmless Creature. Bullinger calls it a
Symbol of Innocence. It does no Wrong or Injury to any.

II. The Lamb is made a Prey of, and often worried by Dogs, Wolves, and other
evil Beasts.

III. The Lamb is a meek and patient Creature, bearing Wrongs, not seeking
Revenge upon them that strike and abuse him.

IV. The Lamb is silent, when brought to the Slaughter, does not cry, complain,
nor strive, as other Creatures do.

V. The Lamb is a lovely and very delightful Creature; hence Vriah's Wife is
compared to it. 2 Samuel 12.3, 4.


VI. The Lamb is a contented Creature; let the Shepherd put it into what
Pasture he please, it grumbles not, but seems very well satisfied.

VII. The Lamb is a clean Beast, whose Flesh God appointed for Food; and the
Flesh of no Beast is more generally prized, especially at its first coming,
than Lamb.

VIII. The Lamb was appointed under the Law for Sacrifice, it was to be taken
out of the Flock, to be severed from the rest, to be killed; a He-Lamb, and
without spot, was to be offered up to make an Atonement, and the Blood to be
sprinkled, etc.

IX. Lambs are very profitable Creatures, they enrich their Owners; their
Fleece and Skins are good for Clothing. Also the (...) Chesitah, Nummus, sexta
pars Denarii, Genesis 33.19. Job 42.11. Josh. 24.32. Nummus agni imagine signatus,
does signify both Money and a Lamb. Liegh Crit. Sac.
Money of the ancient Patriarchs was called a Lamb, because the Figure of a
Lamb was on it. Abraham bought a Field for an hundred Pieces of Silver, or
Lambs.

X. The Lamb is a small Creature to other Beasts, therefore the Hebrews call
them (...). Liegh Crit. Sacr. Job 42.12
Aben-Ezra apud Jobum, tenellam Pecudem, vel Agnellum interpretatur: A small
Sort of Cattle, or diminutive Lamb.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ is of a sweet, quiet, and harmless Nature and Disposition:
Such an High Priest became us, who is holy, Heb. 7.26.
harmless, undefiled, separated from Sinners, etc.

II. The Lord Jesus was preyed upon by Devils and wicked Men, Mat. 4.2, 3. Mat.
2.14.
who continually worried him, like hungry and blood-thirsty Wolves, Lions, and
ravening Beasts, whilst he was upon the Earth.

III. The Lord Jesus with a meek and patient Spirit bore all those vile and
grievous Wrongs, Contradictions of Sinners, Mat. 11.2.
Heb. 12.3.
and horrid Blasphemies, in the days of his Flesh, Mat 26.53
without seeking the least Revenge upon them. Austin says, he is compared to a
Lamb because of his Mildness.

IV. The Lord Christ was silent, when he was led to be crucified: He is brought
as a Lamb to the Slaughter, Mat. 26.63
and as a Sheep is dumb before the Shearer, so opened he not his Mouth. -- He
did not cry, Isa. 53.7.
nor cause his Voice to be heard in the Streets.

V. Christ is the Delight of the Father, Prove. 8.30. Isa. 42.1.
very lovely in the Eyes of Saints and Angels; nay, what was said of Titus
Vespasian, may fitly be spoken of Christ, He is the Delight of Mankind.

VI. Christ was abundantly satisfied to become any thing, Heb. 10.7. John
10.15, 17, 18. Phil. 2.7, 8
and to do whatever the Will of his Father was, tho 'twas to be abased so low,
as to be born of a poor Virgin, to live in a mean Condition, and to have no
where to lay his Head, whilst he abode in this howling Wilderness.

VII. Christ was ordained of God to be the Food of our Souls; and there is no
Meat so sweet, or is so much prized by the Godly, especially when they first
receive him by Faith, as this Lamb. My Flesh is Meat indeed, Joh. 6.55.
and my Blood is Drink indeed. Whosoever has fed spiritually on Christ, he
desires no better Dainties.

VII. Christ, the Lamb of God, is our only Sacrifice. He was taken from among
Men, separated from Sinners, Heb. 7.26. 1 Pet. 1.1, 17, 18, 19. Heb 7.27. Heb.
12.24
truly Man. He was a Lamb without blemish, no Spot or Stain of Sin could be
found in him. He was slain or offered up upon the Cross, to make an Atonement
for the Sins of his People; and his Blood must be sprinkled or applied to our
Consciences by Faith.

IX. Christ enriches all that have Interest in him, 1 Cor. 1.30. Isa. 45.24.
Jer. 23.6. and 33.16. Rev. 19.8. Col. 3.3.
or can lay claim to this Lamb; and his Righteousness is for our Clothing. No
Money will pass for current (as it were) with God, but Jesus Christ. He is the
Saints Treasure; their Estate and Inheritance lies in Christ: But of him are ye
in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us Wisdom and Righteousness, etc.

X. Christ made himself of no reputation. In respect of his Humanity, he is
called a Worm, as Annotators expound that in the Psalmist, Psalm. 22.6. I am a
Worm, and no Man, a Reproach of Men, and despised of the People. He was small
and despised in the eyes of the great Heroes of the Earth.



There are several great Disparities between Christ and a Lamb, but we shall
pass by them, and only take notice of two or three

Inferences.
I. IF the Lord Jesus was such an harmless, innocent, silent, and delightful
Lamb, how does this set out and aggravate the horrid Sin of the Jews, and
others, who put him to death!

II. And how does it magnify the Love and Pity of God to us, that he should be
pleased to part with this precious Lamb out of his Bosom, to be made a
Sacrifice for our Sins!

III. From hence also we may learn how to carry it in the World, not to be
high-minded, and seek great things for our selves; he did not so: Let the same
Mind be in you, that was also in Christ Jesus, Phil. 2.5.
etc.

IV. Let us make him our Example, when under Suffering, and in the hands of
wicked Men, who when he was reviled, reviled not again; Romans 12.19. 1 Pet. 3.9.
let us not seek Revenge, nor render Evil for Evil to any Man.

V. Moreover, let us be contented, as He was, whatever it pleases the Father
to exercise us under, or in what Pasture soever he sees good to put us.

VI. And since he suffered so willingly for us, let us labor (when called
thereunto) to lay down our Lives for his holy Namesake.

Christ the Pearl of great Price.
Mat. 13.45, 46. And when he had found one Pearl of great Price, he sold all
that he had, and bought it.


Metaphor.
I. PEarls (as Naturalists tell us) have a strange Birth and Original; Pliny,
lib. 9. cap. 35.
it is the wonderful Geniture of a Shellfish, congealed into a diaphanous
Stone. The Shell, which is called the Mother of Pearl, Reperiuntur in conchis
marinis, ex Rore caelesti certo anni tempore hausto producta, vel potius nata.
at a certain time of the Year, opens it self, and takes in a certain moist
Dew, as Seed; after which they grow big, till they bring forth the Pearl.

II. Those that would find Pearls, must search curiously for them, and resolve
to run through many Dangers, Pliny lib. 9. cap. 35.
among those huge and terrible Monsters of the Sea, says Pliny.

III. It Is not an easy thing to find Pearl; very few know where to seek for it,
it lying usually at the bottom of very deep Waters.

IV. Pearls are things of very great worth: The richest Merchandise of all,
Pliny, lib. 9. cap. 35.
and the most Sovereign Commodity throughout the whole World, are these Pearls,
says Pliny. Moreover, he tells us of one Pearl that Cleopatra had, which was
valued at six hundred thousand Sestertii; hence Men will part with all for
Pearl.

V. Yet notwithstanding, many Men and Women do not know the Worth and Value of
Pearls, and hence they through Ignorance esteem them not above Pebbles; Swine
tread them under their feet, they value Pease above Pearls.

VI. Pearls have a hidden Virtue in them; tho for bulk but small, yet in
Efficacy they are very great.

VII. Pearls are of a splendid and oriental Brightness; for which reason the
Greeks call them (...), a nitore splendente; their Beauty is as much within as
without.

VIII. A Pearl is round, which is an Emblem of Eternity, it has no end.

IX. Pearls are firm, strong, and well-compact, so as Fire cannot consume them,
nor ordinary Strength break them.

X. They need no other Riches, that find a Pearl of great Price and Value; they
are made for ever, as the Proverb is, in respect of this World.

XI. Pearls are a rich Ornament: Such as have precious Pearls in their Ears, or
rich Strings of them about their Necks, are looked upon as honorable Persons.

XII. Pearl is a very rich and Sovereign Cordial, and is of excellent use and
virtue to prevent Poison, to preserve natural Strength, and purge Melancholy.

XIII. Pearls are called Unions by the Latins, Scultet. Exercitat. Evang. lib.
2. c. 41.
because they are found one by one, quod conjunctim nulli reperiantur.

Parallel.
I. THe Original and Birth of Christ is wonderful; God manifested in the Flesh
is the Admiration of Angels: A Virgin (the Mother of this Pearl according to
the Flesh) being over-shadowed with the holy Spirit (which is compared to Dew)
conceived, and when her Time was come, travailed, and brought forth Christ, the
Pearl of great Price: Luke 1.35.
And the Angel said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
Power of the Highest shall overshadow thee, etc.

II. Those that would find the Pearl of great Price, must search and seek after
him diligently, as for hid Treasure; and must resolve to pass through all the
Troubles and Difficulties that attend the Way of true Piety and Godliness.
Eccles. 2.4.


III. It Is no easy thing to find Christ, and obtain an Interest in Him; Cant.
3.2.
many seek him where he is not to be found, in the broad Way, and by the Merit
of their own Performances; few they be that find this precious Pearl.

IV. Christ is of an inestimable value, may well be called the Pearl of great
Price. The Worth and Excellency of Christ far exceeds the Riches of both
Indies. He is the rarest Jewel the Father has in Heaven and Earth, more
precious unto Believers than Rubies, and all that can be desired cannot be
compared unto Him: No mention shall be made of Pearl. Job 28.18.
Hence the Saints part with all for him, and do account the best of earthly
things but Dung, that they may win Christ. Phil. 3.8.


V. The Lord Jesus, tho in himself he is so precious, and prized above all by
the Godly; yet wicked and carnal Persons, by reason of that sordid Ignorance
and Blindness that is upon their Understandings, esteem him not above the
perishing things of this World; nay, some swinish Men prize their own beastly
Lusts above Christ.

VI. Christ has an hidden Virtue, most excellent in Nature: tho He seem weak,
small, and despised in the Eyes of the carnal World, Romans 1.1^^
yet he is the Power of God to Salvation.

VII. Christ is beautiful, fair, and shining; his Oriental Brightness is far
above the glorious Splendour and Brightness of the Sun shining in his Strength:
Heb. 1.3.
He is the Brightness of the Fathers Glory, and the express Image of his
Person. Christ's Beauty is as much within as without.

VIII. Christ, in respect of his Divinity, is from Eternity to Eternity,
without beginning, and without end.

IX. Christ is called a Stone, a tried Stone, and sure Foundation; there is no
Fire can consume him, nor can all the Powers of Hell break or mar him.

X. They that find Christ have enough, they need no more Riches; they are not
only made happy here, but also to Eternity, and may say, with Jacob, they have
all.

XI. Christ is the Saints richest Ornament: Those that are graced and adorned
with this Pearl, are the most renowned and honorable Ones in the World: Prove.
12.26,
The Righteous are more excellent than their Neighbors.

XII. There is no Cordial to a disconsolate and drooping Spirit like Christ;
the Virtue of his Blood, and the Comforts of his Spirit, revive immediately the
sick and fainting Soul. It Is he that keeps us from the Poison and venomous
Sting of the old Serpent, that strengthens us, and purges out all our
Corruptions.

XIII. Christ is singular; there is but one Christ, 1 Timothy 2.5*
one Mediator between God and Man.



Metaphor.
I. PEarls are of an earthly Original.

II. Pearls are of a very small dimension; for tho they be very considerable in
value, yet are the least of all precious Stones.

III. Men may find a rich and precious Pearl, and yet be miserable in diverse
respects, and that cannot help them.

IV. Men that find precious Pearls may sell them if they please, and sin not,
nor injure themselves thereby.

V. Other Pearls are of a perishing Nature, they may be defaced, broken,
dissolved, and come to nothing.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ is the Lord from Heaven.

II. Christ is infinite in respect of his Deity, without measure, filling
Heaven and Earth with his Presence. He is in Heaven, and yet with his People on
Earth, to the end of the World. Mat. 28.


III. He that finds this Pearl of great Price, can never be miserable. Christ
supplies all the Wants and Necessities of Believers.

IV. No Man can sell Christ, nor part with him, but he sins thereby, and ruins
himself, as Judas did.

V. Christ is durable; this Pearl of Price can never be spoiled or dissolved*
nor diminish or lose his Beauty.



Inferences.
1. Happy are they that find this Pearl.

2. They are Fools who will not adventure the Loss of all for Him.

3. Esteem highly of Christ, you can never overvalue Him.

4. Bless God for bestowing his chiefest and best Pearl upon you.

The Name of Christ like to Precious Ointment.
Cant. 1.3. Thy Name is as Ointment poured forth, etc.


THe Spouse knows not how to set out the Transcendent Excellencies of the Lord
Jesus Christ. Before she says, His Love is better than Wine; and here she
compares his Name to Ointment poured forth, etc.

The Words are a Proposition, in which you have two Parts.

1. The Subject. 2. The Predicate.
1. By the Name of Christ, some understand the Doctrine of Christ declared in
the Gospel; others by his Name, his Person, Illyricus in locum, Ye shall be
hated of all Nations for my Namesake; I will show him how great things he
shall suffer for my Name; that is, for my Sake.

2. Christ has several sweet Names or Appellations given him in the Holy
Scripture, that may be compared to Precious Ointment; as first, his Name Jesus,
Emanuel, the Lord our Righteousness, Prince of Peace, etc.

Simile.
I. OIntment is of a fragrant and odoriferous Scent. Precious Ointment yields a
very sweet Smell: the Box of Ointment which was poured upon Christ, the Text
says, the whole House was filled with the Odor thereof.

II. Ointment has an exhilarating Virtue, it chears, elevates, and makes the
Heart glad. Prove. 27.9.
Ointment and Perfume rejoice the Heart; hence the Ancients in their
Banquetings and joyful Feastings, Amos 6.6.
used choice and precious Ointments.

III. Oil has a drawing and cleansing Quality in it; it is powerful in
attracting, or drawing Pollution or noxious Matter, out of Wounds or Sores in
the Body.

IV. Ointment has a mollifying and suppling Virtue, it will soften any hard
Tumor or Swelling in the Body; the Lord alludes to this: They have not been
mollified with Ointment. Isa. 1.6.


V. Ointment is of a beautifying Nature; Psalm. 104.15.
David tells us, it makes the Face to shine, (Naturalists says) there is a sort
of Ointment that will fetch out Wrinkles.

VI. Some Ointments are of great Worth and Value, as appears not only by
Historians, but by what is said of that Box Mary bestowed upon our blessed
Savior. Mat. 26 7.


VII. Ointments are of a healing Nature.

VIII. Some Ointments are of a strengthening Nature; the Joints being weak and
benumbed, or parts of the Body anointed therewith, it recovers their Strength.

IX. Ointment being poured forth, denotes the use of it; it is of little Profit
whilst it is kept close shut up in the Box, nor does it yield that fragrant
Smell till poured forth.

X. Ointment poured forth, denotes Plenty; as one observes upon the place; as
also a free Communication of it.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus is very sweet and of a fragrant Smell to Believers, as has
been showed upon diverse Metaphors; nay, he makes their Persons, Prayers, and
all their Performances as sweet Odours in the Nostrils of God. Christ perfumes
as it were all Persons and Places where he comes; the Person, Example,
Passion, Rev. 8.3, 4.
Intercession, Word, Promises, Ordinances of Christ, are of a sweet Savor.

II. Jesus Christ, and the Spirit that flows or proceeds from him, is of a
glading refreshing and comforting Nature; Heb. 1.9.
he anoints his Saints, gives the Sorrowful the Oil of Gladness for the Spirit
of Heaviness, Thou have put Gladness in my Heart, Isa. 61.3. Psalm. 4.7*
more than in the time when their Corn and their Wine increased.

III. Christ draws the Soul (when his Name is poured out so, that the Soul
feels the nature of his Sovereign Love and Grace) out of the World, and the
Kingdom of Satan, and from all Uncleanness of the Heart and Life to himself.
Says Christ, And if I be lifted up from the Earth, I will draw all Men unto
me; Cant. 1.4. Joh. 12.32 Jer. 31.3*
With loving Kindness have I drawn thee; Draw me, and I will run after thee.
Christ draws the Soul from Sin, and Sin from the Soul; and so cleanses it
thereby.

IV. Christ's Name poured forth, viz. his Perfections and Excellencies made
known to a Sinner, presently softens his hard Adamant-like Heart: all the
Hearts of Sinners that have been broken and made tender, it has been done by
the Virtue of this precious mollifying Ointment.

V. This Spiritual Ointment will fetch out all the Stains and Spots of Sin; all
those Blemishes and Wrinkles of the Soul; of which the Apostle speaks, that so
we may be presented amiable in the sight of God. Ephesians. 5.27.
Believers have no Beauty but what they have from Christ.

VI. The Lord Jesus Christ is of an inestimable Worth; who is able to account
the value of this Box of precious Ointment? Wisdom is the principal thing,
(Christ is the Wisdom) of God, 1 Cor. 1.24. Prove. 3.^^5.
its price is above Rubies,

VII. Christ heales the Soul; he is not only the Physician, but his Blood* and
the precious Graces of his Spirit, is the Balm or Ointment that cures all our
Sores.

VIII. All Spiritual Strength is from Christ; it is he only that confirms and
strengthens the Feebleness, Ephesians 6 ^^0. Heb. 12.^^2
and the Hands that hang down; it is he that strengthens our Hearts in the day
of Trouble, and weakens the Hands of our Enemies. Psalm. 31.24


IX. The Name of Christ has not that fragrant Smell, nor appears of that great
Worth and Excellency, till poured forth in the Ministry of the Word by the
Spirit and in his Ordinances: that is the way of opening this precious
Alabaster Box, 2 Cor. 2^^ 14, 15. 2 Cor. 2.14.
which like Pipes, convey the golden Oil to the Lamps; thus Christ manifested
the Savor of his Knowledge by the Apostles in several places.

X, The Lord Jesus has a great plenty of all good and sweet Perfumes, Col. 2 3.
and precious things in him, and he is free to part with them, Jo^^. 1.14, 16.
or communicate of his Fullness unto us.



Simile.
I. ALL natural Ointments are of humane Composition, they are compounded by
Men, hence called, the Ointment of the Apothecary; Eccles. 10.1.
God created the Materials, Man learned the Skill of using them.

II. Natural Ointments are of great Value, but their Worth is known and may be
computed: Mary's Box of Precious Ointment was valued, but at, or little more
than three hundred Pence.

III. Natural Ointments will not keep their Virtue; the most fragrant of them
in the World, will, tho kept never so closly and carefully, in time corrupt and
lose its Savor: Dead Flies make the Ointment of the Apothecary to send forth a
stinking Smell.

IV. Other Ointment is of a wasting Nature; take but one Dram out, and there is
an Abatement, and so by little and little it will diminish, and shrink till it
comes to nothing.

V. Other Ointments are only good for the Body; one sort pleases the sensual
part, and another makes the Face and Skin of a Man to shine.

VI. No one kind of natural Ointments has all excellent Qualities in it: some
may be of a fragrant Smell, but not healing, others may be good for healing,
but not of a fragrant Smell.

VII. A Person may be anointed with precious Ointment, and in a little time
lose all the Scent and Savor of it.

VIII. The Effects which are wrought by other Ointments, are not quick and
sudden, cannot heal, cleanse, nor make the Face smooth and beautiful in a
moment: The Virgins that were to delight the Persian King, must be anointed six
Months, before their Beauty was perfect. Esth. 2.12.


IX. A very small Quantity of other Ointment does but little Good, nor works
but small Effects, See Roberson.
whether for healing, beautifying, or perfuming; one Drop will not perfume a
whole Room, etc.

Disparity.
I. BUt this spiritual Ointment was not made by Man; the Divinity of Christ is
from everlasting, not made, nor created; and his humane Nature was filled with
the Spirit, he was anointed with the Oil of Gladness above his Fellows that so
he might pour forth this sweet and sacred Unction to his Saints. Heb. 1 ^^.


II. The Lord Christ is of inestimable Worth, and invaluable; all the Pearls
and Diamonds in the World are not worth the least drop or dram of this good and
precious Ointmen^^ those that have it, would not part with it for ten Thousands
of Rivers of Oil; one drop of it infinitely excels all the choicest Ointments
in the World.

III. The duration of this holy Ointment is such, that it will never decay.
Jesus, and the Grace of Jesus is incorruptible, he is as sweet as Fragrant, and
of the same Virtue he was in Abraham's and Abels time; and so will abide for
ever; for he is without beginning or end of Days: Heb. 7.3. and cap. 13.8.
nothing can get into this precious Ointment to make it unsavory to a grievous
Soul; the Cross it self is sweet in him.

IV. Jesus Christ has anointed thousands of the Godly in all Ages since the
Beginning, and yet the Vessel is as full as ever; it is always pouring forth, it
ever runs, yea and that freely too, yet the Ointment does not diminish; there
is not in him one Dram less than there was at the beginning.

V. The Spiritual Ointment is for the suppling, cleansing, 1 Pet. 3.4. Ezekiel.
16.13, 14.
and healing of the Soul, it causes an internal Beauty, and puts a Luster on
the inward Man; which God and holy Angels delight in.

VI. All Excellencies meet together in Christ, there is nothing that is of Use,
Profit, Pleasure, nor Delight, but it is to be found in him, yea and that in
the highest Degree.

VII. He that is anointed with this Ointment, will smell of it as long as he
lives; there will be some Savor of Jesus Christ remaining, though his Lips and
Life may not be always alike, sweet and fragrant.

VIII. Such are the Effects and powerful Operations of the Lord Jesus Christ,
(this spiritual Ointment that no sooner he touches the blind with his Finger
but they see; and the Leopards are cleansed at a word of his Mouth; as soon as
ever one drop of this Ointment is applied, Mat. 8.2.
by Faith to the Soul, the Effect follows; one moment is sufficient for Christ
to accomplish his Work, tho he does not always work so speedily.

IX. A very small Quantity of this spiritual Ointment does wonderful things;
the least measure of true Grace, has glorious and mavelous Effects, as it is
spoken of Faith, tho it be as small as a grain of Mustard Seed, yet, Mat. 13.31.
etc. a little of this Ointment perfumes the whole Soul, House and Family of a
Saint.



Application.
FRom hence you may further take notice of, and admire the Excellencies of
Jesus Christ, in that he is compared to all things that are good, pleasant and
delightful; well may he be called wonderful: O! how wonderful, and pleasant is
that precious and good Name, Isa. 9.6.
that is composed of so many excellent things.

2. This should draw our Hearts toward him, make us love him and delight in
him, and long, and desire after him; His Name being as Ointment poured forth;
it follows, therefore do the Virgins love thee. Cant. 1.3.

3. This also demonstrates the Excellencies of his Grace; it is the Graces of
Christ, that make him be compared to Ointment poured forth; his sweet Ointments
are, as one observes, his Meekness, Patience, and Holiness, etc.

4. The special Graces of Christ, as appears from hence, are not communicated
to all, the holy Ointment under the Law, was only for consecrated Things and
Persons, the Elect and holy Priesthood of God, only have the Name of Christ,
like precious Ointment, poured out; Christ empties himself only to those golden
Vessels, Zech. 4.12.
though common Graces are communicated to all.

5. We may from hence infer, how unsavory all Wicked Men are in their Persons
and Services that have not this good Ointment upon them, their Hearts, Prove.
15.8. Prove. 21.27.
Lives, and Prayers, and all they do, stinks in the Nostrils of the Lord, being
not perfumed by Jesus Christ: The Sacrifice of the wicked, is an Abomination to
the Lord.

6. This teaches us, how to keep our Souls sweet; Sin, the World, and the
Devil strives to make them lose their savor. Therefore pray every day for a
drop or two of this Ointment to sweeten your Prayers, Meditations, and all your
holy Dutys; and be sure carry Christ in your Hearts, Lips and Lives, and this
will make you lovely, and cause you to shine where ever you come.

7. When you smell of any Perfume, think of this precious Ointment, that
perfumes Heaven and Earth.

8. If you are sad and disconsolate, you may know whither to go, it is this
Ointment that cheers, revives, and makes glad every drooping Christian.

9. Are you troubled with hardness of Heart, or any swelling Tumor; why then
with speed, get some of this mollifying Ointment.

10. Be sure to ascribe all true, softness and brokenness of Spirit to Christ
and his good Ointment.

11. He that would be beautiful, must not be without this Ointment.

12. Get store of it, to perfume your Houses, and pray that your Wives and
Children may have store of it poured upon them.

13. What a Mercy is it, to have of this good Ointment, by us, and laid up for
us, seeing we are so subject to be unsavory, subject to Wounds and Sores, and
other Diseases, which this Ointment cures effectually.

Christ the Believers Friend.
Cant. 5.16. This is my Friend, etc.


CHrist is the Churches Friend, and consequently the Friend of every gracious
Soul; a Friend that sticks closer than a Brother; not only compared to a
Friend, but he is really so: the Believer can bear Testimony of it by
Experince. This shows the happy State of the Church, and of all true
Christians, Christ is their Friend. Now to take in the sweetness of this Text,
it is requisite to enquire into the Nature and Property of a true Friend, and
true Friendship.

A Friend.
There are four things to be considered, requisite to true Friendship

I. Knowledge, amongst Men, true Friendship cannot be manifested, and maintained
without it, etc. It Is more than common, it is peculiar: speculative Knowledge
does not always bespeak Friendship, for true Friendship repuires peculiar
Knowledge.

II. Union is also requisite; here can be no true Friendship till the Enmity
amongst Men be removed. What Friends were Jonathan and David, they loved one
another as their own Soul! Can two walk together except they be agreed? Amos
3.3.

III. Intimacy and true Friendship, causes frequent Access one to the other;
this tends to make People to be of one Heart and one Mind.

IV. Love and Affection, this lays the surest Foundation for Friendship.

Now to speak to the Nature and Property of a true Friend.

I. A true Friend loves heartily; cold Friendship, is the Daughter of feigned
Affection; Love is the abundant overflowing of Desire, which comes to the
Party beloved, swiftly and joyfully, but departs slowly and sorrowfully.

II. A true Friend is very needful: what Man living, tho never so prosperous,
but sometimes he wants a Friend? David, tho a great Man and a good Man, 2 Samuel
15.37. 2 Kings 4.5.
yet his Condition required Friends, and he had them, and prized them, viz.
Hushai, and Zabad. The Centurian was a great Man, yet had his Friends, and used
them: Luke 7.6.

III. He that is a Friend indeed, will make his Friends Case his own; This did
Job, if afflicted, he is afflicted with him; if prosperous, he rejoices. Job
16.17.
Where Friends are kind in Love, there Sorrow is easily showed.

IV. A true Friend, does what he can to keep up the Honor and Reputation of
his Friend; he speaks for him, and acts for him, where, and when he cannot for
himself.

V. He is most desirable; no wise Man will choose to live without Friends,
although he has plenty of Riches; Man is a sociable Creature, and therefore
desires to seek Friendship.

VI. A Friend indeed will give Demonstration of his Love and Friendship. 1.
He Will study his Welfare. 2. He Will speak to promote it. 3. He Will act to effect
it.

VII. A Friend indeed gives his Friend a room in his Heart; the sight of him is
pleasing to the Eye, and the Thoughts of him delightful to the Heart.

VIII. A true Friend is always ready to impart his Secrets to those that are
his Friends. This is a great reason why Men do so prize Friendship, that they
may freely disclose their Secrets, and their Hearts one to another; it is a
certain note of Friendship to impart Secrets.

IX. A Friend will not spare Pains nor Cost, nay, will adventure upon great
Hazards, to help him whom he loves. Others may promise what they intend not to
perform; but a true Friend if able, will surely perform all, or more than he
promises.

X. He will not do any thing to the Wrong of his Friend, or justly to purchase
his Displeasure, because he prizeth the Love of him whom his Affection runs out
after.

XI. He loves to be very familiar, and therefore is frequent in sending to, or
conversing with him whom he loves; he delights to give his Friends Visits.

XII. A true Friend is inquisitive into, and desires to know the state of him
whom he loves; not barely that he may know it, but knowing of it, if in
trouble, that he may redress it.

XIII. A true Friend will not suffer h^^m he loves to lie under Mistakes or
Sin, because he knows 'twill turn to his Blemish and great Disadvantage, and
therefore in Love, will tenderly admonish, being grieved to think that he
should be so ensnared: and this is according to the mind of God, Lev. 19.17
yea and it is according to the desire of the Godly; such Reproofs so given is a
great Demonstration of Friendship. Psalm: 141.5


XIV. The Counsel of such a Friend is profitable, and should be acceptable, in
Prosperity it is safe in; Adversity, it is sweet; in Sorrow and Misery it is
comfortable, it usually mitigates Sorrow and augments Comfort.

XV. It is the Property of a true Friend, to be much troubled and concerned at
the Absence of such whom he loves, and nothing more sweet than the meeting of
Friends after long Absence; as appears by Joseph and his Brethren at their
meeting, Genesis 45.
when they knew one another.

XVI. It Is a great Trouble to a true Friend to see his Love and Friendship
slighted; yet it will not easily withdraw his Love, but labors to pass by many
Offenses, and Unkindnesses.

XVII. A true Friend will not suddenly or easily hear any evil Report against
his Friend.

XVIII. If he be sensible of any Combinations against him he will speedily
disclose it, as Paul's Friends did, touching the Combination of the Jews. Acts
23.14, 20, etc.


XIX. A true Friend greatly rejoices in the Prosperity of his Friend, and
cannot but be troubled at such as would rejoice at his Ruin.

XX. He that is a Friend indeed will be faithful; such an one was Jonathan to
David. He will not leave his Friend in Straits, that being a Time that calls
for his Help: And if he has any thing committed to his keeping, he will be
faithful and careful, he will be true to his Trust, and keep safe that
wherewith he is entrusted.

Parallel.
I. CHrist knows his People, not only with a common, but a peculiar Knowledge;
yea, and he has instructed them into the Knowledge of himself, that they might
not only know their Friend, Joh. 10 27
but that they might endeavor to keep up, Joh. 13.18
and highly to prize Friendship with him.

II. What a blessed Union is there between Christ and his Peoples? 1 Cor. 6.17.
and it is of his own procuring; as the Heart of Jonathan was knit to the Heart
of David. Even, so and much more is the Heart of the Lord Christ united to his
People, Ephesians. 2.14, 15, 16. compared
-- for the Love of Christ does very much transcend the Love of all other; the
People of Christ should also have their Hearts knit to him. Cant. 2.14


III. Intimate Acquaintance with the Saints, Christ does really delight in; and
Saints should really delight in it also. 1 John 1.7.


IV. There Is true Love between Christ and his People, which makes those Acts of
Friendship very cordial and desirable.

I. Jesus Christ is a cordial Lover; as he loves so he speaks, and as he
speaks, so he loves; Christ's Love is an abounding and abundant Love to his, he
loves freely and heartily, and has given Evidence of it; and though his Love
be sometimes eclipsed, yet it is not wholly removed: He having loved, loves to
the End. Joh. 13.1.


II. Christ is the most necessary Friend, he is of absolute Necessity, it is
possible, to live comfortable in the World, though a Man has but few Friends,
and to dye happily, though a Man has not one Friend in the World, having
Christ; but living and dying without Christ, thou art, and wilt be miserable;
Multitudes of earthly Friend and Acquaintance will not, cannot save from Hell,
but if Christ be thy Friend, he will. Joh. 17.3.


III. This is evidently seen in Christ. The Text tells us, Isa. 63.9.
He did not only sympathize with them, but saved them; Heb. 4.15. Zech. 2.8.
h^^ is said to be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities: whatever Wrong
is done to his People, he takes it as done to himself: Acts 9.4, 5. Isa. 51.22,
23.
if any raise a Quarrel against them, he will engage himself therein.

IV. Such and much better Friend is Christ. The Members of Christ's Spouse have
been stigmatized by the Enemy, for Heretics, and many other ways; but Christ
has stood up to vindicate their Wrongs and Innocence; he has spoken for them,
where, and when they could not speak for themseves; he had his Gamaliel in the
Council.

V. Such a Friend is Christ, most desirable: Phil. 3.8, 9, 10.
one that is acquainted with Jesus Christ, esteems his Friendship, So Paul: Who
accounted all things but Loss for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Jesus
Christ, etc.

VI. Even so Christ has given full and perfect Evidence of his Love and
Friendship: His Thoughts are about them, Psalm. 139.17. Jer. 29.11.
nay his Words and Works are all for, and in behalf of his Spouse.

VII. So Christ, Isaiah says, Isa. 40.11.
He lays them in his Bosom; He loves to hear from them, rejoices to see
them: Cant. 2.14
and indeed a Saint cannot be satisfied short of a room in Christ's Heart: John
was said, Joh 13.23.
to lie in Christ's Bosom.

VIII. Even so does Christ, and it is according to Promise and Experience. To
lie in the Bosom of Christ deno^^s Union, Intimacy, Secrecy; Psalm. 25.14.
this is that which makes Believers so much prize Christ; says God, shall I
hide from Abraham the things that I do? It is Encouragement to Saints to lay
open their Hearts to Christ.

IX. Herein Christ does also perform the part of a Friend; for he will neither
spare Pains nor Cost, and has adventured upon the greatest Hazards, and all
for the Love he bears to his People; nay he has not put them off with bare
Promises, but will perform them to the utmost; he usually out does his Promises.

X. Even so Christ does nothing to injure his, nor justly to provoke them, or
purchase their Displeasure; the poor Soul is ready sometimes to think such and
such things are against him, as Jacob did in the Case of Joseph and Benjamin.
All his actings and outgoings toward his People speaks forth his desire of
their Love: hence he greatly praises and commends the Love of his Church; Cant.
4.10.
How fair is thy Love my Sister, my Spouse, etc.

XI. So Christ loves to be familiar, Cant. 5.1, 2.
and therefore is frequent in conversing with his people, witness his Word.
This Familiarity is kept up by frequent Converse and Visits, Job 10.12.
and Christ's Visits are as Cordials to the Hearts of his People.

XII. So Christ's desire is to know the State of his People, to the end that he
may evermore supply them; not but that he perfectly knows their State, but to
make them sensible to declare it, Mark 10.51.
as he did to the poor blind Man; even so he will not suffer his People to lie
under Sin, because he knows 'twill turn to their Disadvantage.

XIII. Even so Christ will not suffer his People to lie under Sin, he knows
'twill turn to their Disadvantage; O how is he concerned when they are
ensnared! which does signify his great Trouble, and therefore gives friendly
Reproofs and Admonitions in order to reclaim them; and Believers have found his
Reproofs to be peculiar Acts of Friendship: Psalm. 119.67, 71. Rev. 3.1, 2.
I know thy works that thou have a name to live, and art dead, -- I have not
found thy Works perfect before God, etc.

XIV. O how profitable is Christ's Comfort! it teaches them in Prosperity to
carry it humbly, in Adversity, to carry it contentedly; in the midst of their
Sorrow and Misery it comforts them, Psalm. 49.19. Psalm. 16.7. Psalm. 73.25
this is that which above all things asswageth the Believers Grief: hence it is
that Believers so much prize the Counsel of Jesus Christ.

XV. Even so Christ loves to hear from his People, and is concerned at their
Silence, they are always welcome to him, he takes their Absence unkindly: and
afterward when they come to visit him again with the Acknowledgment of their
Miscarriages; O how welcome are they! such a Meeting is on both sides very
sweet and pleasant.

XVI. Even so it is with Christ, to see his precious Love slighted. Ingratitude
is a Sin which is very offensive, it being a Sin against Truth and Justice.
Against Tru^^h, for it is in effect a denying of the Kindness received: Against
Justice, which calls for a rendering of something back in token of Thankfulness.

XVII. So Christ; he does not (as I may say) take up every evil Report the
Devil, Sin, or wicked Men bring against them: Christ will not take Measures by
their Information, but by that perfect Knowledge he has of them, Heb. 12.8.
and if they have done amiss, he will reprove them, but gently, for their
Profit.

XVIII. Such is the Love and Care of Christ to his People, that if any
Combination be against them, he will give them seasonable Information of it,
for as much as nothing can escape his Knowledge, he being Omniscient, etc.

XIX. Christ the Believers Friend, does greatly rejoice in the Prosperity of
his People, which is evinced from his Bounty toward them; See Comforter.
he leaves them not without Counsel, without a Guide, without Comforts; but is
large in distributing all means of Help to them, as may conduce to their
prosperous Supply, and he has a severe Eye upon such as either help on, or
rejoice at their Afflictions.

XX. Christ is the Believer's faithful Friend; He has been abundantly tried,
but never failed any that trusted in him. He never left his, but was full of
Kindness to them in all their Troubles, not unmindful of those great Concerns,
committed to the charge of this their choicest Friend. Having loved his own
that were in the World, he loved them unto the end. Joh. 13.1. 2 Timothy 4.17.
-- Yet nevertheless the Lord stood by me, etc.



A Friend.
I. FRiendship amongst Men is usually occasioned from the Suitableness of the
Object: Man with Man is suitable for Association, and this is the great moving
Cause of their Friendship; not Man with another Creature, or rarely a King with
a Beggar, or a Courtier or Statesman with an illiterate Countryman, as the
Subject of his Blessing, or Object of his Delight.

II. Usually they apprehend something of Desert in the Person on whom they
bestow their Friendship: Either it is deserved by the Good they see in him, or
may be requited by the Help they may receive from him; for it is possible and
usual, for a poor Man to be useful to a rich Man, and the weakest to him that
is strong.

III. No such Friend has done so much, but it is known, and may be declared.
Christ says, Greater Love has no Man than this, that he lays down his Life
for his Friend; wherein their Love is plainly seen, and may be comprehended.

IV. The best natural Man may sometimes forget his Friend, either through a
multitude of Business, Encumbrance, or weakness of Memory, during which time he
may suffer much.

V. Such a Friend knows no more of his Friend's Condition than is revealed to
him, neither is he able to pass right Judgment respecting him, as in Job's
case, therefore cannot reach the Heart with Comfort.

VI. Such may be thy Condition, that thy best Friend may not know how to help
thee, tho willing, such may be the Affairs thou art to manage.

VII. Tho a natural Friend may know what will help thee, yet it may not be in
his Power to help thee. The tender Mothers in Judah and Jerusalem, their Bowels
moved for the starved and languishing Babes of their own Bodies; and they knew
that Food would have succored them, but 'twas not in their power to procure it.

VIII. These natural Friends may be removed from thee, or thou from them, and
so thou may be left destitute, and this Friendship come to an end. Many have
been clapped up in a Dungeon, and sequestrated from their dearest worldly
Friends, therefore they are uncertain at best; however, if no Dungeon, yet
Death will separate them.

IX. Natural Friends may be made unable to perform their Promises. A real
Friend, through an overheated Zeal, does sometimes out-bid himself, and is not
able to make good his Word; which lays a Man under great Disappointments. I
relied on my Friend's Promise, but he has failed me. Nay, a Friend, when he
promises, may at that time be able to make good his Promise, but some strange
Providence may suddenly disable him.

Disparity.
I. BUt Christ grounds not his Friendship here, there being in fallen Man no
Suitableness of Association; Man being polluted, Angels might be thought much
more suitable: But it is Love and free Grace, that notwithstanding there was
nothing desirable in fallen Man, he being altogether sinful, and so not
suitable for Association* yet Jesus Christ has made choice of Man, Heb. 2.16.
and is become his true and faithful Friend.

II. But Jesus Christ grounds not his Friendship on this Bottom; for fallen Man
is altogether undeserving; nothing that was in them could be the Cause of his
Friendship, but merely his own good Will and Pleasure, Man being utterly unable
to requite his Love and Kindness, or to give any thing to him in requital; so
that it is undeserved Friendship.

III. But Christ has done so much for his People, as is not known, 1 John 3.1.
1 Cor. 2.10 Romans 5.5, 6.
nor can be conceived; and all this when they were Enemies. If it be considered
what he did for them before Time, what he has done in Time, and what he has
prepared for them in Aftertimes, it will appear that there is no such Friend
as Christ, who entertains all his with eternal Mansions Glory.

IV. But this Friend will never forget thee, wherever thou art, Isa. 49.15, 16.
Heb. 13.5, 6. Psalm. 40.17
tho never so remote; let thy Condition be what it will, he is ever mindful of
thee, and of his Covenant. What God said concerning the Temple that Solomon
built, Christ says the same to his People: Mine Eye and my Heart shall be on
them perpetually: 1 King. 9 3 Mat. 28. ult.
Lo I am with you always to the end of the World.

V. But Christ knows our Conditions, and can pass right Judgment concerning us,
and can reach our Hearts to comfort and support them. He knows the Ways I take,
says Job. He is a Soul-Friend, Job 23.10
he it is that teaches the way to true Happiness, and adorns the Soul with
Grace; that is the Friend to be desired.

VI. But Christ can take right measures of thy Condition, and knows always how
to help thee; 2 Pet. 2 9.
He is never at a loss how to help his People; He knows how to deliver thee.
There are none of thy Affairs too hard for Jesus Christ to manage.

VII. As Christ has Wisdom, so he has Power: Mar. 28.18, 19. Acts 8.10.
All Power in Heaven and in Earth is given unto me. What was sinfully said of
Simon, This Man has the great Power of God, may be righteously and truly said
of Christ. 1 Cor. 1.24.
O here is a Friend indeed, that knows in every state how to relieve thee. We
may weep and mourn over our dear Friends, that are in Sorrow and Misery, Joh.
11.33
as they did over Lazarus in the Grave, and as the Women did over Dorcas, when
they were not able to help: So thy Condition may be such, that thy dearest
Friend may say of thy Help, as the Depth and Sea said concerning Wisdom, It Is
not in me. O b^^t it is to be found in this Friend Jesus Christ: He has given
sufficient Proof of his Bowels of Pity to his People, and of his Wisdom and
Power in their greatest Straits.

VIII. But this Friend of Believers nothing can separate from them, no, not
Death it self, for he is immortal. Romans 8.33 Acts 16.25, 26.
Was not Christ with Paul and Silas in Prison? O how sweet is the presence of a
dear Friend in Trouble! Alas! Walls and Guards may keep off other Friends, but
nothing can keep or hinder Jesus Christ from coming unto his People.

IX. But Christ is able to make good his Word to the utmost; he never outbids
himself. Who was ever laid under any Discouragement or Disappointment, that
trusted in Him? In all Changes, in all Providence, Christ is the same. Thou
may commit great Concerns into the hands of thy supposed Friend, and he may
fail thee; nay, into the hand of thy real Friend, and yet be uncertain of
Security; Fire may destroy, or Thieves may rob him, so that being impoverished,
he cannot make good what he received: But Christ cannot, nay, will not
disappoint thee.



Application.
I. IS Christ a Friend, such a Friend? then how greatly does it concern poor
Souls to make sure of this Friend! Does not Self-Interest lead Men to seek for
Friendship, and as much as in them lies, with such as are likely to do the part
of a Friend? etc.

II. Does not this reprove the Ignorance and Folly of those that slight and
reject this great and good Friend? How many, instead of seeking his Favor, are
in Friendship with the World, and their Lusts, and by their wicked Practices
are bidding defiance to him, as tho neither his Favor nor Frowns were to be
regarded?

III. It shows the miserable Condition of those that are unacquainted with him;
He is the Soul's Friend, and it calls aloud upon them, Job 22.2^^.
to be acquainted with him.

IV. Is Christ thy Friend? then here is a sure Ground of Comfort; you can never
want, that have such a Friend, so loving, so sympathizing, so necessary, and so
suitable; a present, a constant, a careful Friend; yea, a Soul-Friend; a wise,
a powerful, a faithful, immortal, and everlasting Friend! This is a Friend
indeed, an honorable Friend, Job. 11.42
that is in favor with God, who never had his Suit denied!

V. Is this thy Friend? O then,

1. Bless God, that has raised up such a Friend for thee, and made thee
acquainted with him.

2. Prize and love this Friend dearly.

3. Visit him often, tell him all the Secrets and Grievances of thy Heart. How
sweet is Communion with him! Psalm. 142.2 Prove. 18.24. 2 Chronicles. 24.22.


4. Be not ungrateful to him, be not like Joash, who forgot the Kindness of his
Friend! May it not be justly said to some, Is this thy kindness to thy Friend?
O it is sad to abuse the Kindness of such a Friend.

5. Trust your Friend, take him at his word, question him not, he is faithful.

6. Have no commerce with his Enemies, but keep close and faithful to him in
every Condition. Achitophel dealt treacherously with David, do thou not so with
Christ.

7. Publish and declare what a Friend thou have, endeavor to get Sinners
acquainted with him.

8. Be sure let nothing part thy Friend and thee: Prize his Presence, dread his
Frowns; follow his Doctrine and Examples, that it may be known that Christ is
yours, and you are his. Let your Light so shine before Men, that they may see
your good Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven. Mat. 5.16.


Christ is the only Friend. A true Friend is tried in a doubtful matter. Christ
has laid down his Life for Believers; what is more difficult to Nature than
Death?

Christ the Rose of Sharon.
Cant. 2.1. I am the Rose of Sharon.


IT is Christ that speaks these words, it becomes not the Spouse thus to
commend her self; says Solomon, Let another, and not thine own Lips praise
thee. The Lord Jesus elegantly expresses his own Excellency, Prove. 27.^^
by comparing Himself unto a Rose, the Rose of Sharon.

Metaphor.
I. A Rose is the Offspring and Fruit of a good, tho seemingly dry Root.

II. A Rose is a beautiful Flower, very pleasant and delightful to the Eye, of
different Colors, red and white, and in some curiously joined and intermixed
together, red and white; shows an excellent Complexion, and makes up a perfect
Beauty.

III. A Rose is a fragrant and sweet Flower, it yields a most excellent and
odoriferous Scent. This may not hold true of every sort of Roses, but it is such
an one Christ compares himself unto.

IV. The Rose is a useful Flower, it is full of Virtue.

1. Roses distilled, afford a most sweet cooling Liquor, good against
intemperate Heat; it gently qualifies Choleric Exhalations, Hieron. Trag. lib.
de S^^irp.
refreshes the Spirit when sad, etc. and is good for the Eyes.

2. Being conserved, and otherwise made use of and applied, they are very
cordial and medicinal: Their Use in Physic, says an eminent Writer, Hieron.
Trag.
words are too few to express.

V. The Rose is called by Naturalists the Queen of Flowers, none being to be
compared to it.

VI. The Roses that grew in Sharon, were the best and chiefest of Roses; they
were singular in Beauty and Property.

VII. The Rose of Sharon signifies in Greek the Flower of the Field, Sharon
being a Place or Plain wherein King David's Herds and Cattle were fed. 2 Chronicles.
27.29.
Roses that grow in a Field, are not planted by Man, and indeed do lie open to
Beasts, to be spoiled, plucked to pieces, or trodden down.

VIII. The Roses of Sharon were free; Persons might have access to them, when
they could not to other Flowers, that were in close and secret Gardens.

IX. Roses, and other delightful Flowers of the Field, are the Beauty and Glory
of the Field, they cloth the Grass.

X. Sharon was a Place (as we said before) of Pasture, a Place of Feeding,
where the Flocks used to rest, a very fruitful Valley.

XI. The Rose yields a very precious Oil, good in diverse cases.

Parallel.
I. CHrist, touching his humane Nature, is the Offspring of David, or a Branch
out of the Stem and Root of Jesse. Isa. 11.1.


II. Christ is said to be white and ruddy. Cant. 5.10
Some understand thereby his two Natures, by the white his Divinity, by the red
his Humanity: The one denotes his natural Purity and Innocence; the other, his
bloody Agony and Suffering for our sakes; hence said to be red in his Apparel.
Isa. 63.2.
No Object so delightful to the Eye, as Jesus Christ is in his Humiliation,
crucified for our Sins; in his Exaltation, appearing at the Father's right hand
for us. True and evangelical Sights of Christ delight the Eye, and ravish the
Soul of a Believer. Christ is a perfect and complete Beauty.

III. Jesus Christ yields a most fragrant and lovely Savor. See Precious
Ointment.
What is so sweet and refreshing to the spiritual Senses of the Soul, as the
Merits and saving Graces of Christ? His very Name is as precious Ointment
poured forth; Cant. 1.3.
He is the Savor of Life unto Life to them that believe.

IV. The Lord Jesus is excellent for Profit and spiritual Virtue.

1. Being crucified for our sakes, what precious Virtue, what Soul-mollifying
Water of Life does he yield us? good against all Choleric Heats and
Exhalations of the Heart and Flesh, making the furious and impatient Man,
gentle, meek, and humble; refreshes the Spirit of a Saint, when dejected, and
under Temptations; and is exceeding good to open the Eyes of the Understanding.

2. Jesus Christ, laid hold on by Faith, and the Virtue of his Blood applied
and kept in the Soul, will prove a Sovereign Cordial at all times. The
medicinal Properties of this Rose of Sharon, for the healing the Distempers of
the inward Man, words (I may well say) cannot express.

V. Jesus Christ infinitely excells all others, whether Angels or Men; none are
to be compared to Him. He is the Head, the Flower, and Glory of Things in
Heaven, and of Things on Earth, whether Thrones or Dominions, Principlaities or
Powers. He is fairer than the Children of Men, the chiefest among Ten
Thousands. Psalm. 45.2. Cant. 5.10


VI. There is nothing eminent and refreshing in any Creature in a natural way,
but it is supereminent, and infinitely more in a spiritual way in Christ.
Christ is singular, touching the Unity of the two Natures in his Person,
singular in his Incarnation, in his Humiliation, in his Conquest and
Exaltation, etc.

VII. Jesus Christ was not planted by Man, but by the hand of the Father; and
when brought forth into the Field of this World, how open did he lie to evil
Beasts, such as Herod and the Jews were? how was he plucked to pieces, as it
were, and trodden under their Feet? He was laid open to almost all manner of
Sorrow and Suffering. Isa. 53.2, 4.5.


VIII. Jesus Christ is free for all poor Sinners, Isa. 55 1. Rev. 22.1.
whoever will may come and take the good and gracious Virtue, and
Soul-refreshing Blessings that are in Him. He is a Fountain opened. Ze^^h. 13
^^.
The Good that is in God is no other ways communicated to Mankind, but in and
through Him.

IX. The Son of God is the Beauty and Glory of Mankind, by assuming of our
Nature into Union with himself. It Is He who is the Crown of Mortals, sitting in
Glory at the right hand of the Majesty in Heaven.

X. Christ is to be found in green Pastures, in his Churches, where his Word is
truly preached, and Sacraments are duly administered: Psalm. 23.2.
He leads me in green Pastures.

XI. Jesus Christ affords a very precious Oil, called the Oil of Gladness,
which is of a most Sovereign Virtue. See Oil.



Metaphor.
I. A Rose is only pleasant and grateful to the external Senses.

II. A Rose can be had but in one Season of the Year; you may look for a Rose
in the Winter, and find it not.

III. The Rose is a very fading Flower; the Naturalists tell us of some that
seem to wither in their budding; all their Beauty and sweet Savor passes away.

IV. A Rose may be taken, presented, given, and received, by an human Hand.

V. One Person can but have one and the same Rose entirely to himself at one
and the same time.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ delights and gratifies the spiritual Senses of the Soul.

II. Jesus Christ, this Rose of Sharon, may be had at any time of the Year, in
Winter as well as Summer. The Soul meets with him rather in Adversity, than in
Prosperity.

III. Jesus Christ is a Rose that never fades, he remains in his full Beauty
and Glory throughout all Generations, he never loses his Savor: If he does not
smell so sweet to our Senses, it is because our spiritual Senses are decayed;
the Cause lies in us, not in him: Jesus Christ, Heb. 13.8.
the same yesterday, to day, and for ever.

IV. Jesus Christ is taken, presented, and given by a divine hand, viz. the
hand of God himself: God so loved the World, Joh. 3.16.
that he gave his only begotten Son, etc. And he is not otherwise received but
by Faith, the spiritual hand of the Soul.

V. Jesus Christ, the Rose of Sharon, is of such a Nature, that Thousands may
have him entirely to themselves, as if but one only had him, and this at one
and the same time.



Inferences.
1. IF Jesus Christ be the Rose of Sharon, so sweet and lovely a Flower; let me
advise all Ladies and young Virgins, and others, who delight in Flowers, above
all to get this Rose; you never found the like in all your Lives; none so
sweet, nor yields such a fragrant and odoriferous Smell as Christ does: Nay,
and more than that, 'twill be a glorious Ornament unto you, 'twill make all
good and gracious Ones in love with you.

2. Moreover, this shows us, that most of the Men and Women in the World have
lost their Smell, their spiritual Senses are gone; they can find no such Savor
in Religion, no Sweetness in a reproached, persecuted, and crucified Jesus; no
Delight in Ordinances, Prayer, hearing the Word, nor in Sacraments.

3. Labor to be stored with the Conserves, and precious Virtues of this Divine
Rose; prize the Distillation of it. You love to wash in Rose Water, it is very
grateful and pleasing to you; come then and wash in the sweet and fragrant
Water of the Rose of Sharon; let Heart and Hands be washed in it. It will not
only cleanse away the Filth, but will supple and heal all the Wounds and
Bruises of your diseased Souls. If you wash in the Water of the Spirit, that
flows from a crucified Christ, it will make you a sweet Savor in the World,
your Conversations will be of a fragrant Scent.

4. Besides, it shows how happy they are that have got Jesus Christ; and what
Fools Men of the World are, who slight and dis-esteem him. They prize the Thorn
and Briar, the pricking Pleasures and Profits of the World, above the Rose, the
lovely Rose of Sharon.

5. You that are God's Children, that have had the sweet Scent of the Rose of
Sharon, value him above your chiefest Joy; account him (as indeed he is) the
Rose and Diadem of your Souls; bear him not only by an outward Profession in
your Breast, but take down the sweet smelling Savor of his Grace into your
Hearts. Ye can never overvalue Christ.

On the Rose of Sharon.
IF Nature such a Magazine discloses,
Of artless Beauty in our common Roses,
As does the Pencil's Artifice outvie,
Commanding notice from each curious Eye:
Whose Sense-refreshing Fragrancy does yield
Perfumes, enriching the enameled Field:
Sweetning the ambient Air, to entertain
With Balmy Odours, the invading Train
Of flanting Gallants: Does to each distribute
A lovely Nosegay, as a Vernal Tribute.
Yet it is but fading: With the Suns up-rise
Unfolds its Bud, and in the Evening dies.
What shall we say to this Illustrious Bud,
This Rose of Sharon! Language never could
Express its Glories, Glories that excel!
In Beauty peerless, uncompar'd in Smell!
No Myrrh, no Cassia, nor the choice Perfumes
Of bruised Spice, or Oriental Gums,
Breath equal Sweetness! All the Flowers that be
Tinctured with Nature's rich Embroidery,
Yield Him the chief Preheminece: Then let
Each Soul make haste our Sharon's Rose to get.
In Him is Life, we perish if we taste not:
In Him are Joys, eternal Joys that waste not.
Christ an Advocate.
1 John 2.2. We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.


ADvocate, in the Greek ((...)) is one called or retained to speak or plead for
them who have Indictments against them, or otherwise were impleaded in any
Court of Judicature, and entreated to favor another in Judgment, and

XIV. An Advocate has the Judges Ear more than those that are but standers-by,

because he expects him to speak to the purpose, who has Authority so to do.

XV. An Advocate gives free access, and is ready to be spoken with by all
Persons that have any Business with him.

XVI. An Advocate undertakes high and desperate Causes, he refuses not to
speak for Men greatly obnoxious to the Law, he sticks not sometimes to plead
the Cause of Traitors, where the Law admits of a legal Plea, tho in very great
danger of their Lives, by reason of the grievous Crimes wherewith they stand
charged against their Prince.

too far, and have stayed too long, they are past remedy.

XXVII. A wise and honorable Advocate lies fair for Preferment, viz. In some
space of Time to be a Judge himself, when his Work and Business of Advocateship
cease.

Parallel.
I. CHrist is a wise and learned Person, In whom are all the Treasures of
Wisdom and Knowledge; Col. 2.3.
The Lord God having given him the Tongue of the Learned, etc. Isa. 50.4.


II. The Lord Jesus is related to God, and the high Court of Heaven, the Man
that is God's Fellow; Zeck. 13.7. Psalm. 80.15.
The Man of his Right Hand, made strong for himself.

III. Jesus Christ was born and constituted under the Law, Gal. 4.4.
and made it his Rule in all Cases, would not vary in the least from what God
had required or enjoined therein.

IV. Jesus Christ took not this Place and Office upon himself, Heb. 5.4.
but was called and appointed to it by God, as Aaron was to the Priesthood.

V. Christ does undertake Causes for any, if they come to him: If any Man sin,
we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; Who is the
Propitiation for our Sins, 1 John 2.1, 2.
and not for ours only, but for the Sins of the whole World.

VI. The Lord Jesus pleads all Causes that he undertakes, did it when here on
Earth, Holy Father, Joh. 17.6, 11.
keep through thine own name, those whom thou have given me, etc. Thine they
were, etc. they have kept thy Word. Father forgive them, they know not what
they do: Luke 23.34.

VII. Christ knows the Weight of every ones Cause, and knows how far it will go
if well managed; He knows who will carry the Cause, and who will lose it: he
that relies upon him alone by a lively Faith, in a way of Holiness and new
Obedience, is certain of the Cause, when all others are like to miscarry: He
that believes and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believes not,
shall be damned: Mark 16.16.

VIII. Jesus Christ being Justice it self; will be faithful in all Causes
wherein he is entrusted; he is not only called Jesus Christ the Righteous; but
he did as a due Proof thereof, 1 John 2.1. Mat. 4 8.
refuse the tender or offer of the whole World, for the sake of Sinners, rather
than he would betray his Trust, or yield up the Cause of Men's Souls into the
hand of their cruel Adversary the Devil.

IX. Jesus Christ the wonderful Counselor, he sets his People in a hopeful way
and Method to improve a Cause, when carried against an Adversary: Go thy way
and sin no more, Isa. 9.6. Joh. 5.14.
lest a worse thing come unto thee, etc.

X. Christ did nothing of himself, but what he received from the Father; he is
a strict Observer of all Rules of Righteousness, so as to lead at all times in
the Ways thereof, Joh. 12.49. Prove. 8.20.
and in the midst of the Paths of Judgment; and that he might appease the great
Judge in all things, he came up to the demands of Justice, and answered the Law,
and now pleads the Merits of his own Blood in the Court of Heaven for us.

XI. Jesus Christ out-does all Advocates under Heaven in all things, for he
speaks so as never Man spoke like him; Joh. 7.46. Joh. 14.13.
He bids them ask what they will, and he will do it for them: Ask and it shall
be done, Joh. 16.24.
that your Joy may be full.

XII. Christ most fully answers to this, where he says, Father, Joh. 17.24.
I will that those whom thou have given me, be with me, where I am, that they
may behold my Glory, etc.

XIII. The Lord Jesus knows the fittest times to manage Business, on the behalf
of Souls, there is an acceptable time for him to be heard and to do his Work;
when Satan tempts, when he desires to sift, when he accuses to God, as in the
Case of Job, when Provocation is given and the Enemy lays Siege against the
Soul; then is a fit time for our Advocate to work; this Christ is well
acquainted with, Simon, Simon, Satan has desired to have thee, that he may
sift thee as Wheat: Luke 22.32.
but I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not, etc.

XIV. Christ has the Ear of the Heavenly Judge, because he always speaks to the
very life of the Cause. He was heard in all things, and at all times: I know
that thou hear me always: Joh. 11.42
He only is authorized to plead for poor Sinners.

XV. Jesus Christ invites all that are weary and heavy laden, Mat. 11.28
to come to him for Rest, with a Promise of free access, Whosoever comes to me,
I will in no wise cast out: Joh. 6.36.

XVI. The Lord Jesus, this wise and able Advocate has undertaken desperate
Causes, such as Mary Magdalen a great Offender, Peter a great Backslider, Paul
a great Blasphemer and Persecutor. The Gentiles that were Thieves and
Idolaters, by the Fall: desperate was the Cause of all he undertook: 2 Timothy
1.13. Joh. 17.20. Isa. 53.12.
I Pray not for these alone, but for all that shall believe on me through their
Words: He makes Intercession for the Trangressors.

XVII. Christ is very much honored by God, he calls him his Fellow, and will
have all Men honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.

XVIII. Jesus Christ knows much of the mind of God, being skilled in all the
Laws, Natural, Moral, and Evangelical, well understands his Nature and
Disposition, being always by him, Prove. 8.30.
and as one brought up with him, Joh. 1.18.
being daily his delight, etc. so near and familiar that he lay in his Bosom.

XIX. Jesus Christ had unspeakable Confidence, in so much that he feared not to
appear amongst great and learned Doctors in the Temple, Luke 2.^^.
hearing them and asking them Questions, to the Astonishment and Amazement of
all them that heard him; He appeared too mighty and learned for all the
Pharisees, Sadduces, and Priests of the Jews.

XX. The Lord Jesus stands not on Fees, or Gratuities, for indeed none are able
to give unto him a Reward for his Work, Romans 11.35. Isa. 55.1.
but he acts on the same terms that God gives Wine and Milk, and that is,
without Money, and without Price. Whosoever will, may come, and take his Counsel
and Advice, Water of Life freely: Luke 1.53.
He has filled the Poor with good things, but the Rich he has sent empty
away; Their Cause falling to the ground.

XXI. Christ did frequently, when on Earth, and since his Departure into
Heaven, carry Causes doubtful to others: He carried the Cause in a great Trial
against Satan, who made strong Attempts against him, Mat. 4.3* 4, 8, 9. Rev.
5.5, 6. Romans 5.7. Gal. 3.13.
after he had fasted forty days. And when none was found worthy to open the
Books, and unloose the Sea's, and look thereon, at which John wept, The Lion of
the Tribe of Judah prevailed. In due time Christ died for the Ungodly, he has
delivered us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.

XXII. Jesus Christ is watchful to keep up the honor of God and his Laws,
because the Contempt thereof would prove of ill Consequence; I honor my
Father, I have glorified thee on Earth; Joh. 17.4.
Not one jot of the Law shall fail; think not that I came to destroy the Law,
etc. Romans 3 26.
He answered the Demands of it, that God might be just, and the Justifier of
those that believe in Jesus.

XXIII. Christ is very diligent, never guilty of any Neglects in acting for his
People; he went about doing Good, pleaded often, pleaded strongly, with Crying
and Tears, used mighty and prevailing Arguments with God, on the behalf of his
Flock on Earth; pleads for great things for them, for the holy Spirit, for
divine Protection, Union, and for their safe Conduct to Heaven: Father, Joh.
17.17, 21, 24.
I will that all they whom thou have given me, be with me where I am, that they
may behold my Glory.

XXIV. Jesus Christ is successful, he has carried many, yea multitudes of
Causes for his People; nay, indeed it may be said, when did he miscarry? what
Cause was lost when the Sinner did sincerely and in good earnest engage him? he
carried the Cause for poor Peter, to the preventing his utter Destruction; he
prevailed for the Protection of God to the twelve Apostles, that continued with
him; He pervailed for the sending the Comforter, when he went away; he carried
Paul and the suffering Saints away Conquerours; has made us more than
Conquerours: Romans 8.38.
He manages effectually all the Affairs of his Elect throughout all the Earth.

XXV. Jesus Christ is greatly grieved, to see Men miscarry in the great Cause
of their Souls through their own neglect, because they did not, they would not
come to him, retain him, make use of him; Joh. 3.40. Luke 19.41, 42. Mat. 23.37.
He drew near the City, He beheld it, and wept over it. O Jerusalem, that thou
had known, even thou in this thy day, the things that belong to thy Peace!
But now they are hid from thine Eyes; their Cause was irrecoverably lost,
because they would not come unto him.

XXVI. Jesus Christ will not take the names of some into his Lips, he leaves
them wholly to themselves, to stand or fall; says of them, as once it was said
of Ephraim, Let him alone; such are the hardened Hypocrites and Reprobates,
horrible Apostates, the Blasphemers of the holy Ghost, of these it may truly be
said, as in Eccles. 4.10. Woe unto him that is alone; and they may say of
themselves, The Harvest is past, the Summer is ended, Hos. 4.17.
and we are not saved. God has sworn in his Wrath against some, that they
shall not enter into his Rest; and Christ will neither plead nor pray for them;
Jer. 8.20.
He will take no foul Cause into his pure Breast, but clearly leaves them out
of his Intercession and Advocateship: I pray not for the World, etc, Joh. 17.9.

XXVI. The Lord Jesus is the wisest and honourablest Advocate that ever was,
and therefore is the undoubted Heir to Preferment; yea, to the greatest of
Preferments, He being appointed the Judge of all the World, Acts 10.42. Joh.
5.22.
by a former and unalterable Decree: Him has God ordained to be the Judge of
the quick and dead; God judges no Man, but has committed all Judgment unto
the Son; He has appointed a day, Acts 17.31.
in which he will judge the World in Righteousness, by that Man whom he has
ordained, etc.



Advocate.
I. AN Advocate here below, is concerned but for a few Clients, cannot serve
many, much less all that need an Advocate to plead their Cause for them.

II. An Advocate here below, is but of short standing, comes in an hour and
goes out in an hour, the Eldest are but of yesterday and of small Experience.

III. An Advocate here below leaves his Clients doubtful, because they know not
how a Cause will go before Trial.

IV. Some Advocates here below do more often miss than carry Causes, and many
of them lose more Causes than they gain.

V. An Advocate may carry a Cause here below, and there may lie an Appeal
against it in some of the superior Courts, as the Court of Chancery, etc. The
Cause may be carried for a Person in one Court, and lost in another.

VI. An Advocate in these lower Courts, tho he be an able Man, yet he may be
over-match'd and outdone by others; it being a Rule in most Cases, Not one so
good, but he may find his Equal, etc.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ is an Advocate for his whole Church, all may come and make use
of him; I pray not for these alone, but for all them that shall believe on me
through their Word: Whosoever comes, Joh. 17.20.
none is refused, that has an Appeal to make to the great God, who is Judge of
all the World, etc.

II. But Christ this great Advocate of Souls, who appertains to the high
Court of Heaven, is of long standing and great Experience, possessed the Place
of an Advocate from the Fall; nothing can surpass his Cognizance, he stood
before the Ancient of days, in the days of Noah, Daniel, Job, etc.

III. But Jesus Christ knowing all things relating to the Judgment-day, gives
assurance to his Saints, before Trial, it shall go well with them: He that
sees the Son and believes in him (has the Cause) has eternal Life, and
shall never come into Condemnation. Joh. 5.24. Romans 8.1


IV. But Christ, this high and holy, this great and good, this wise and just,
this true and righteous Advocate, carries every Cause he undertakes. He will
not undertake any Cause, to plead effectually, but the Believer's: He will not
speak a word for the Sons of Belial, that will not submit to his Laws: I pray
not for the World, but for those thou have given me. Joh. 17.9.
For those that willingly submit to his Laws, he is successful to a Wonder;
whatever he desires is done for them, his Prayers being always heard.

V. But the Lord Jesus, the Churches Advocate, makes sure Work; when He
carries a Cause, it is done in the highest Court it self, from whence there is
no Appeal. Every Cause that Christ carries, is, like the Laws of the Medes and
Persians, unalterable, and like the Covenant, 2 Samuel 25.4, 5. Luke 10.42
ordered in all things, and sure; it is as the good Part Mary chose, that shall
never be taken from her; neither Men nor Devils shall be able, by Fraud nor
Force, to take it away from them. It Is God that justifies, who is he that
condemns? Romans 8.33, 34.
It Is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen again, who also makes
Intercession for us.

VI. Christ has no Match or Equal, but he very much transcends all his
Opposites. Beelzebub has had a great Name, but he is nothing to Jesus; Christ
makes him fly before him, and fall like Lightning. He has an awful Majesty in
his words, that if he does but say, Mat. 4.11. Zech. 3.2.
Get thee behind me, Satan, The Lord rebuke thee; Satan shrinks off shamefully:
He dares not, cannot stand before this powerful Advocate.



Application.
I. BEhold the mavelous Goodness of God, that he should (in mere Mercy to us)
appoint such an able Advocate, to whom the very Angels themselves are inferior,
in point of Wisdom, Power, Office, and Honor. Job 38.7* 1 Pet. 1.12
Those Sons of the Morning shout for Joy at his Appearance as an Advocate, and
pry into the Mystery of his honorable Work.

II. There is great Encouragement to come to this Advocate: God invites Men to
come to Christ for advice, and to take his Counsel: Mat. 3.17.
This is my beloved Son, hear Him. He is not concealed in some secret Chamber,
where he cannot be found, but stands at the opening of the Gates, Prove. 1.20,
21, 22. Isa. 49.6.
at the Place of the chiefest Concourse. God has given him to be a Light to
the Gentiles, and his Salvation to the ends of the Earth. Whoever believingly
and in truth desires to have him for their Advocate, my have access unto him,
and have their Cause undertaken, pleaded, and effectually managed by him, who
is the Judge's own Son. The Motives to this Duty are many.

1. When poor Sinners come to this holy Advocate, they are kindly embraced.

2. They have their Work readily undertaken, they are not tired out with Delays.

3. They have it very carefully managed; the Cause is not lost, nor suffered to
fall to the Ground, for want of prudent and careful Management, etc.

4. It is a great Case, that cannot safely be trust in any other hand, it is
about a Title to an Inheritance, wherein if a Man miscarry, he is utterly
undone, yea, utterly undone to Eternity.

5. Their Cause is admitted of, and undertaken, without Fees or any kind of
Charges; He will do all freely without Money.

6. There is much Peace, Satisfaction, and Security in it. A Man that has
committed his Cause to this Advocate, may sleep in Peace, go about his Business
in Comfort; neither need he in the least doubt or fear of what will follow, for
there was never any one that trusted in him confounded or put to shame. There
was never a Cause left by any Man, to the wise Counsel and Management of this
most powerful and holy Advocate, but it carried the Day. He is not only able to
save, but able to save to the utmost, Heb. 7.25.
not only some, but all those that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives
to make Intercession for them.

III. Who then would refuse coming to Jesus Christ, or neglect to make use of
this Advocate?

IV. It also shows us the Cause why Men perish, and miss of God's Favor, and
lose eternal Life: It is not for want of free Tenders of Grace, or because
there is no Advocate to plead for them; but it is because they will not open at
his Knock, nor take his Counsel, etc. They will not come unto him, Joh. 5.40.
that they might have Life.

Lastly; Let all Saints, who through Satan's Temptations have been overcome,
and have sinned, and wounded their Consciences, remember, that there is an
Advocate for them with the Father, 1 John 2.1, 2.
Jesus Christ the Righteous.

Christ an Apostle.
Heb. 3.1. Consider the Apostle and High Priest of your Profession, Christ
Jesus.


AN Apostle signifies in the Greek one sent; and it has something peculiar to
it, to distinguish the Office from other Offices, appertaining to the Gospel,
and the Church: for tho John Baptist was one sent, with many others, yet were
they not called Apostles, but dignified by some other Names, Titles, or
Epithets; as Forerunner, Disciple, and Servant of the Church, etc. Now
inasmuch as one Rank and Order of Men have this Title given them, and by it are
distinguished from others concerned in Divine Service, we may suppose it to
signify their Commission and Qualification for their designed Work; which
Commission, Qualification, and designed Work, seems to be comprehensive of
these three things, viz. 1. Immediately sent; 2. Marvellously inspired; 3. The
Master Builders of the Gospel-Foundation for the Christian Religion. That all
these are declared and set forth concerning Jesus Christ, is evident. Therefore
in that Christ is here called an Apostle, it must or may signify, that He was
sent after a higher and more extraordinary manner than common Messengers.

An Apostle.
I. AN Apostle was immediately sent by Christ.

II. The Apostles, In pursuit of their Commission, went up and down preaching
the Gospel, etc.

III* The Apostles had Christ always with them in their Work, in an
extraordinary manner.

IV. An Apostle was to bear witness to the Truth, and to Christ's Name.

V. The Apostles were to open Mysteries that had been kept hid.

VI. The Apostles were endued with Divine Power to do Wonders and mighty Works.

VII. The Apostles were to take care of the Church whilst they lived, and after
their Decease Paul had the Care of all the Churches upon him: He sent for the
Elders, Acts 20.
and gave them charge, etc. St. Peter took care, that after his Decease the
Churches might be secured from Danger.

VIII. The Apostles had a Dispensation committed to them, from which they were
not to depart. A Dispensation of the Gospel is committed to me. 1 Cor. 9.17
Woe is me, if I preach not the Gospel. They also ordained other Ministers.

IX. The Apostles went through good and evil Report unweariedly, 2 Cor. 6.8.
till they had finished their Course, and then committed themselves to Him that
judges righteously, in expectation of a Crown of endless Glory: Henceforth is
laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, 2 Timothy 4.
etc.

Parallel.
I. CHrist Jesus was immediately sent by God: He came not of himself, but the
Father sent him.

II. Christ Jesus went about preaching the Gospel, doing Good, Acts 10.38.
and healing all that were oppressed.

III. Christ Jesus was not alone, Joh. 8.16.
but the Father was with him. God was with him in an extraordinary manner,
beyond what he ever was with any Mortal.

IV. Christ, as the great and chief Apostle, bore witness to the Truth: For
this cause came I into the World, Joh. 18.37.
and^^

V. The Lord Jesus came, as the chief Apostle, Luke 4.18.
to open Mysteries that had been kept hid.

VI. Christ Jesus had not the Spirit by measure, Joh. 3.34.
but was filled with the Spirit to do and speak mighty things.

VII. Christ more especially took care of his Church before he left them. He
forewarned them of Evils to come, he cautioned them against Fears and
Apostacies, and committed them to the Care of his Father: Keep through thy Name
those that thou have given me. Jo^^. 17.^^


VIII. Jesus Christ, as the great Apostle, had a Dispensation committed to him:
The Work that my Father gives me to do, shall I not do it? Joh. 9.4.
I must work the Works of God. Tell that Fox, Luke 13.32
I do Miracles this day, to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected. He
had Power also to ordain other Officers and Ministers.

IX. Christ suffered great Contradiction of Sinners against Himself, H^^b. 12.3.
fought as the Captain of our Salvation, with all Difficulties and Enemies,
till he had finished his Work, and could say, Father, it is finished, into thy
hands I commend my Spirit. He for the Joy that was set before him, Heb. 12.2.
endured the Cross, despised the Shame, and is sat down at the right hand of
God.



An Apostle.
I. THe Apostles were but mere Men, whose Original was from the Dust.

II. The Apostles had but small measure of the Spirit, and were not without Sin
and Infirmities. 1 Cor. 3.9


III. The Apostles were but Fellow Servants, 1 P^^. 5.3.
and not Lords over God's Heritage; not like some we have had since their Time.

IV. The Apostles did but show and direct to a Savior, to Salvation, and
eternal Life; they were not able to save, nor could they give Salvation to any:
Was Paul crucified for you? etc.

Disparity.
I. CHrist was Emanuel, the eternal Son of God, God, v^^ry God, Isa. 7.14.
of God, Lord of all, whose Descent was from Heaven: I came down from Heaven.
M^^t. 1.23. 1 Cor 15.47. Joh 1.1^^.
The second Man was the Lord from Heaven.

II. Christ had the Fullness of the Divine Spirit dwelt in him, and rested upon
him. Jo^^. 3.34. Heb. 9 14. Joh 14.30 Heb. 7.26.
God gave not the Spirit to him by measure. Through the eternal Spirit he
offered himself to God without spot. The Prince of this World came, and found
nothing in him. He was holy, harmless, and undefiled, separate from Sinners.

III. But Christ is Master, Head, Lord, Ruler, and Governor, a complete Prince
and King, as well as Priest, and Prophet, and Apostle. He is Lord of all, over
all, God blessed for evermore. Romans 9.5.
Which made Mary say, They have taken away my Lord; and Thomas say, My Lord,
and my God. Joh. 20.28


IV. But Christ did more than show and direct to a Savior: He was that Savior
himself, and the Author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him. He had
Help laid upon him, Heb. 5.9. Psalm. 78.19 Luke 2.11.
being mighty to save; was born a Savior: To you is born in the City of David
a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And that great Salvation is not to be
neglected without eminent Danger: How shall we escape that neglect so great
Salvation? Heb. 2.3.




Inferences.
I. BEhold the great Goodness of God to the Church and World! that he should
send so great an Apostle, so wise an Ambassador, to treat with Souls, and for
Souls, and to settle, govern, and establish the Church.

II. What great Love Christ had to Sinners, that he should leave his Riches and
Glory above, to come down to be an Apostle, a Fellow Servants, ^^ Cor. 8.9
for our sakes. He that was rich became poor, that we through his Poverty might
be made rich.

III. What need have we of the Pope and his Cardinals, seeing God has been so
kind, to give us Christ to be our Apostle and High Priest? We own none but
Christ to be the Apostle and High Priest of our Profession, who can do all
things for us by his Word, Heb. 3.1.
Spirit, and Ministers. Away therefore with that grand Antichrist, and vile
Impostor, whom they call His Holiness, with all his Antichristian Crew.

IV. This may serve to inform us, that we ought to listen to him, and be taught
by him, for there is great reason for it.

1. God sent him: I came not of my self, the Father sent me.

Joh. 7 46.
2. He spoke so as never Man spoke. No Man ever yet, nor ever will speak like
the Man Christ Jesus. He spoke like one that had Authority, Mat. 7.29.
and not like the Scribes, learned Doctors, and wise Men among the Jews. Many
were astonished at his Understanding and Answers in his tender Age.

Mat. 17.5.
3. God commands us to hear him: This is my beloved Son, hear him.

4. God threatens us if we do not hear him; it is dangerous to refuse to hear
him: Heb. 11.25
How shall we escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from Heaven?

Christ the Bread of Life.
John 6.48, 50, 51. I am the Bread of Life: This is the Bread which comes down
from Heaven. I am the living Bread, which came down from Heaven.


IT is not my Business here to give the various Opinions of Men touching the
Bread in the Text, (Some hold it to be Christ's Doctrine; others, Christ in the
Sacrament; others hold it is Christ in a more invisible Administration); but to
show metaphorically, that whatsoever Bread properly so called, is to Men,
considered as Men; that Jesus Christ is unto Believers, and all true
Christians, according to the Gospel.

Metaphor.
I. BRead is prepared and made fit for Food.

II. Bread is a Substance well suited for the Subject to which it is appointed.

III. Bread is good in it self, and of its own nature.

IV. Bread is not inherent in us, but a distinct thing from us, and a Gift from
another.

V. Bread is ordained to an high and most excellent End, even to preserve the
whole Race of Mankind.

VI. Bread, tho it be prepared, be suited, be good, given and ordained to an
high, a very high and excellent End, yet it must be taken and used according to
the Intent of the Giver, and proportionable to the end of it, otherwise we
shall starve in the midst of Plenty.

VII. Bread is pleasant to the taste of all, but especially to the needy: The
full Soul loathes the Honey Comb, Prove. 27.7.
but to the hungry every bitter thing is sweet.

VIII. Bread renews Strength and preserves Persons Lives: not only David and
the Samaritans found it so, but it is the common Experience of all Mankind,
without it Faintness immediately succeeds, and soon after Life expires.

IX. Bread as it renews Strength and preserves Life, so it fits for Work and
Business, no Man can work much, or continue long in Business without it.

X. Bread is of universal necessity and benefit, the Rich want it as well as
the Poor, the Landlord as well as the Tenant; the King as well as his Subject:
Children in their Nonage, young Men in their full Strength, and the old Man
that is going out of the World, they all need it, and have Benefit by it.

XI. Bread is the best of all earthly Blessings; Beauty, Ornament, Wealth,
Treasures, are below it; and inferior to it, and not to be valued with it: A
Man will pawn his Clothes, dispose of his Treasure, mortgage his Land rather
than want Bread.

XII. Bread has a hidden Virtue in it, which cannot be known, but by Taste or
Experience. A Man may see and hear much, but this is nothing, it is Taste,
Relish and Experience that discovers the Virtue of it; and a small Morsel
tasted, is better than the great King of Babylon's Feasts that were seen, and
not partaken of.

XIII. Bread is a free Portion, and common to all that will work for it, it
belongs to the Poor as well as the Rich, none excepted from it; but on a
Forfeiture he that will not work, neither let him eat.

XIV. Bread is absolutely necessary to common Happiness; a Man cannot enjoy
himself, his Relations without it; if he has glorious Apparel, sumptuous and
fair buildings, gallant Gardens, large Fields, and Pasture, if it were possible
to have the Wisdom, Wealth, and Glory of Solomon, and want Bread, he could take
no Comfort in it; the fretting and hungry Humor would haunt him, and like the
Worm, and devouring Caterpillars of Egypt, eat up and devour all his Comforts.

XV. Bread, in a sense of the want of it, will occasion violent Motions,
according to the old Proverb: Hunger will break stone Walls, etc.

XVI. Bread as it comprehends the greatest of Blessings when promised, so the
greatest of Judgments when denied; Bread shall be given, and thy Waters shall
be sure.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus was prepared by God the Father, to be a meet and fit
Savior, and Food for our Souls; A Body have thou prepared me. Heb. 10 5.


II. Jesus Christ is well suited to the Soul or Subject that is to receive him,
all Qualifications which are really useful to support and refresh the Soul are
in him; viz. Mercy, Kindness, Goodness, Gentleness, Pity and Sympathy; Mat.
11.28, 29.
He administers to the Poor, feeds, fills, satisfies, etc. Of his Fullness we
receive, and Grace for Grace. Joh. 1.15.


III. Christ is good in himself, and in his own nature, and he cannot but be
so, because there is no evil quality can mix, incorporate or convey the least
Tincture into him; although he seems to refuse the Attribute of absolute Good: Why
call thou me good? Mat. 19.17.
etc. Yet was he really and completely good in his whole Nature and Quality,
being God, etc.

IV. Jesus is not inherent in us, (as some imagine) but is a distinct Person,
or Substance without us, Col. 2.6. Joh. 4.10.
the Gift of God to us, He came to his own, but his own received him not. But
to as many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God,
etc. Joh. 1.11.


V. Christ was ordained of God to a very high and excellent end, even to uphold
the whole Race of Mankind; this Lamb was foreordained, 1 Timothy 1.15. Act. 13 47.
That through him Sinners might be saved; Thou shall be my Salvation to the
ends of the Earth.

VI. In like manner, tho Jesus Christ the blessed Savior be prepared and
suited, be good, and given, be ordained and appointed to a very high and
excellent End, yet if he be not taken and made use of according to the intent
of the Giver, and proportionable to the end, for which he was given, misguided
and careless Men may perish: the Supper of the great King did only benefit the
Receiver; the rest, that came not when invited, perished: Luke 14.24.
They that were hidden shall not taste of my Supper. The Prodigal had starved,
had he not come to his Father's House for Bread.

VII. In like manner Jesus Christ is pleasant and sweet to a hungry Soul that
is sensible of the want and need of him; 1 Pet. 2.7.
Unto those who believe he is precious, etc.

VIII. In like manner Jesus Christ renews, strengthens, and preserves the Souls
of Men: before he comes, they are without Strength, Romans 5.6. Joh. 8.2*
and those that refuse him, shall certainly die in their Sins, etc.

IX. Even so Jesus Christ received, does fit for spiritual Work and Business: I
can do all things through Christ that strengthens me: Phil 4 13.
But without him nothing can be done to any purpose: Without me ye can do
nothing. Joh. 15.5.


X. The Lord Jesus is of universal necessity and benefit; the Rich want him as
well as the Poor, the Landlord as well as the Tenant, the King as well as the
Peasant; young Men in their full Strength, old Men when they are going out of
the World, they all need him; For there is no other Name given under Heaven, by
which Men can be saved: All have some Benefit by him; Acts 4.12.
He is the Savior of all Men, but especially of them that believe.

XI. Jesus Christ is the best of Blessings, beyond compare; The Chiefest among
ten thousand; Song 5.10.
He is that Bread that adds Strength to the Faculties, creates a healthful
Appetite in every right Receiver; yea, Beauty, Ornament, Wealth, Treasures, are
below him, and not to be valued with him, he is better than Gold; yea, the most
fine Gold; Better than Rubies, Prove. 3.13, 14, 15.
and all things that can be desired, are not to be compared unto him. Wise Men,
Masters of the best Reason have sold, left, forsaken all, for him. Moses left
all the Riches and Honors of Egypt, for Jesus Christ. David cries, Whom have I
in Heaven but thee? Psalm. 73.25 Acts 20.24
etc. The Primitive Saints parted with their Substance, their Clothes, their
Peace; yea, their Lives, and all, for Christ's sake: We have left all and
followed thee, etc. I account not my Life dear unto my self, etc. for whom I
have suffered the loss of all Things, etc. Heb. 11.24, 25, 26.


XII. In like manner the Bread of Life, the Bread of God has hidden Virtue in
him, which none can know but those that have tasted, that the Lord is gracious:
Therefore O taste and see how good the Lord is. Experience works Hope. Psalm.
34.8.
This was that which Christ meant when he said, Except ye eat the Flesh of the
Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you: Joh. 6.53.
When you taste, relish, and experience the hidden Virtue that is in Christ,
the use of his Name, the sight of his Person, the hearing of him preached will
do you no good.

XIII. Christ is a free Portion, a common Right to the Poor as well as the
Rich; he that will endeavor to get him, that will labor for the Meat that
perishes not may have him; Prove. Mat. Joh. Phil.
He feeds the hungry with good Things: None are forbidden to take of this
Bread; those that will not look out for it, will certainly lose their Souls at
last. The Sloathful shall beg in Harvest, and have nothing; his Desires slays
him. We are to seek, 2 These. 3.10.
to ask, to knock, to strive, to labor for the Meat that perishes not: Joh.
6.27. or perish for the want of it, Joh. 6.27.


XIV. Jesus Christ is absolutely necessary to Men's Happiness; there is no Joy,
no Peace, no Tranquillity of Mind, no Content or Satisfaction, no Freedom from
the fretting Humor of a distempered Mind, from the hungry craving of a galled
Conscience without him. If Relations speak, what is it? if he cloth himself
with Silver, if he adorn himself with Jewels, if his Rooms be hung with rich
Tapestry, if he stretches himself on a Bed of Ivory, all is as nothing, it
will not stop the Mouth of Hunger, nor minister one nights solid Content or
Satisfaction; the height of all his Happiness lies but in the Folly of
Advancement, that vanishes upon the first opening of his Eyes, and seeing
himself lost, and, th^^ saddest case without Christ in the World: Rev. 3.17.
He dreams he has spiritual Food; but when he awakes, his Soul is
hunger-starved, and sinks within him, he thinks he is full and needs nothing,
but is naked, poor and miserable and wants all things. And there can be none
but miserable Comforters round about him, that can say little more than there
is no Help for him in his God, because he has neglected this spiritual Bread:
For he that has not the Son, has not Life, Joh. 3.36.
but the Wrath of God abides upon him: Joh. 3.36.

XV. A true and real sense of the want of Christ, will occasion violent
Motions, as it did when the Poor pressed into the Gospel; The violent took it
by Force: The Blind-man cried when forbidden; Mat 15.25, 26, 27, 28.
the Woman came for Crumbs upon the sharp point of great Repulses, and would
have no Denial.

XVI. Jesus Christ, as he is the Bread of God, the Bread of Heaven, the Bread
of Souls, is comprehensive of the greatest Blessings when promised or enjoyed,
he is the Light of our Eyes, the Joy of our Hearts, the Life of our Souls, his
approach to us, far exceeds the Joy of Harvest to an Husbandman. But the
greatest of Judgments when denied, there follows a lean, miserable, starved,
decayed, sinking, dying, destroyed and damned Soul for ever and ever: My
Servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; I will break the Staff of Bread,
etc.



Metaphor.
I. BRead is an earthly Substance.

II. Bread is a dead Substance.

III. Bread properly is for the Body.

IV. Bread properly so called will perish, as the Manna in the Wilderness.

V. Bread properly so called, is literally eaten, as the Fathers did eat Manna.

VI. Literal or corporeal Bread is given by the hands of Men, as Parents give
to their Children, when they ask it.

Disparity.
I. BUt Christ is the Bread that came down from Heaven, the second Man was the
Lord from Heaven.

II. But Jesus Christ is living Bread, was dead for a while, but is alive, Rev.
Heb.
and lives for evermore: He ever lives to make Intercession, dies no more, etc.

III. But Jesus Christ is bread, Meat, Refreshing, Life for the Soul: Whosoever
has Christ, shall have him for ever, Joh. 6.
shall never die.

IV. But Christ is durable, the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever; Joh.
6.
Whom God would not suffer to see Corruption.

V. But Jesus Christ is eaten spiritually, not as the Papists do imagine, not
to his Hurt or Punishment, but to his Honor and Delight; not as the Fathers
eat Manna in the Wilderness.

VI. Christ is given by the hand of God, and by the Ministration of the Spirit:
He shall take of mine and show unto you. Joh.




Inferences.
IF this Doctrine be true (as certainly it is) which has been discovered, then
it affords us matter of Instruction:

1. It teaches us God's great Goodness in providing such Bread for us, that is
so good in it self, so necessary unto us, that we die and perish without it.

II. It shows Jesus Christ's great Goodness, in vouchsafing to become Bread and
Food for us; what manner of Love is this, that the Son should undertake to feed
and save (...) etc.

3. It shows the indispensible Necessity of Men's coming to Him, their receiving
and being Partakers of him: All Soul-Bread is in him, all Life, yea, all
spiritual Life is in him. Those that refuse him, choose Death. The eternal Life
that God gives, Prove. 8. John 1.
is in his Son.

4. It shows the Blessedness of those that are made Partakers of him: Whosoever
has the Son, Joh. 5.24.
has the Father also. And he that has the Son, has Life, and shall never
come into Condemnation.

5. It teaches Good and Bad to pray: The Good, that God would evermore give
them this Bread, every day give them Bread: Give us this day our daily Bread.
Mat. 6.
The Bad, that God in Mercy would not let them die before they are made
Partakers of Christ, the true Bread, the Bread of God, the Bread of Life, that
whosoever dies without, dies never to live again, he dies the second Death. O
cry to God, to the Lord of Life, that whatsoever you want of this Life, you may
not eternally perish without Jesus Christ.

Christ the Sun of Righteousness.
Mal. 4.2. But unto you that fear my Name shall the Sol (...) quod solus
appareat (...).
Sun of Righteousness arise, with Healing in his Wings, etc.

Psalm. 84.11. The Lord God is a Sun, and a Shield: Which, as Mr. Ainsworth
notes, may refer to Christ, Mal. 4.2.


Observe. JESUS CHRIST is, and may fitly be compared unto the Sun, to the Sun in
the Firmament, the great Light of Heaven.

Metaphor.
I. THere is but one Sun to give Light to the Universe, and from its
Singularity it may take its Name, Sol quia solus. There are many Stars, but one
Sun.

II. The Sun is not only Light, but a Fountain of Light, the Eye and Soul of
the World.

III. The Sun is a pure, bright; and spotless Creature, the Beauty and Ornament
of Heaven. His Brightness is such, that a Man cannot look upon it, but it
da^^les and blinds his Eyes; unless looking downwards, and beholding it in
Water, which (tho thick and gross, yet) is a proper Medium. The Sun, tho he
looks (as it were) with an open face upon the Filth and nauseous things on
Earth, yet contracts from thence no Filthiness or Pollution.

IV. The Sun has his Orb, his Tent, or as the Scripture speaks, his
Tabernacle. Psalm. 19.4.


V. The Sun is a communicative Creature, placed in the Heaven to enlighten the
World; he is always sending forth his Beams of Light.

VI. The Sun is at the Lord's Commandment, in his rising and setting, standing
still, or going back; he does all by God's special Order and Appointment.

VII. The Sun sends forth his Light universally to all the World; it shines
upon the Just, and upon the Unjust; it is not confined to one Nation or People,
or to this or that Man, but it is free to all.

VIII. The Sun is the Superintendent over the World, the chief Governor, as it
were, and Head of Influences, called the Queen of Heaven. Jer. 7.18.


IX. The Sun is of a mavelous Magnitude, Genesis 1.16.
called a great Light; and is affirmed by some to be one hundred sixty and six
times bigger than the Earth.

X. The Sun communicates his Light to the Celestial Bodies, viz. to the
Firmament, Moon, and Stars, who have no other Light but what they derive from
it.

XI. Were it not for the Sun, what a dark World would this be! If God should
say to the Sun, Shine no more; or should deprive the Earth of the Light
thereof, who would desire to live one moment longer here?

XII. The Sun is a wonderful and amazing Creature, all gaze on it with
admiration. The Persians and others ignorantly adored it as a God. Some
insensible Creatures, as the Marygold and Tulip, open their Leaves at its
approach, to receive its reviving Influence, and shut up at its departure, as
if mourning for its absence. Others bow and hang down their Heads, and wrap up
themselves, when he withdraws his Beams, in a seeming Sympathy, that shows an
unwillingness in them to be seen by any eye but his.

Of the Motions of the Sun.
XIII. The Sun in its Motions and Operations is very strong, and Giant-like; he
goes forth like a strong Man in his Might; who can stay the Sun in his Course?

XIV. The Sun in his Motion is very swift; he makes haste, as one who runs a
long Race, even the whole Circuit of Heaven.

XV. His Motions are constant, he is ever in motion, he always keeps the same
Pace; if he ever stood still, it was not to ease himself, it was not for his
own, but his Creator's pleasure.

XVI. The Sun's Motion is regular; he never goes without his Bounds, keeps
always in the Zodiac, moving in the Ecliptic, betwixt the two Tropicks.

XVII. The Sun is never weary, tho in a continual Journey; the Swiftness of his
Course does not tire him, nor is he spent by his restless Motion, but is still
as glorious as ever.

The Operations of the Sun.
XVIII. The Sun is powerful in its Operation, in expelling Darkness; the Night
vanishes at its approach; the Clouds, and dark Vapors of the Morning, are also
scattered and dispersed by the Operation of its powerful Beams.

XIX. When the Sun has chased away the thick Vapors and dark Fogs of the
Morning, it causes a very sweet and lovely Day, shining forth with great
Splendour and Brightness.

XX. The Influence of the Sun is very extensive, it reaches to every Creature,
it penetrates into the Bowels of the Earth, and dives as deep as the Bottom of
the Sea; nothing is hid from his Heat. He shoots forth his Beams like so many
Darts, to pierce the Body of the Earth, and with his light-giving Rays, makes
search into the lowest and darkest Dungeons. His Remoteness from the Earth
impedes not his Operation.

XXI. The Sun dries up and exhales the gross and filthy Vapors of the Earth,
which otherwise would corrupt the Air, and render it pestilent and infectious,
and is therefore of a healing quality.

XXII. The Sun is useful to Generation and Production; many precious Fruits are
brought forth by it. It makes the Plants, which were laid (as it were) in the
Grave, to rise and spring up again. Hence the Sun is called by some, Anima
Mundi, the Soul of the World, because it animates the Creatures.

XXIII. The Sun visits not every Hemisphere, nor shines in every Horizon at the
same time; and it differs in the degrees of Heat, in the respective Latitudes,
according as they are nearer to, or more remote from the Equinoctial. Some
Places beyond the Tropicks, as Greenland, etc. see it not in many Months. And
it is well known, that according to the Situation of Places, as they bear from
each other, East and West, the Sun rises sooner or later, proportionable to the
Difference of Longitude of each Parallel.

XXIV. The Sun is of a more healing, warming, refreshing, and reviving quality,
than any Creature in Nature. It is also of a burning quality, for by a
Burning-Glass it will set combustible things on fire.

XXV. The Sun is of an illuminating and discovering quality, exposes to view
what the Night hides, which the Moon (tho unclouded, and at Full) cannot so
well do. It shows things as they are. In the Dark we may stumble and fall, yea,
handle venomous Creatures, or fall into Dens, and tumble from Precipices, etc.
So that by its Light we are guided in all the Actions of our natural Life.

XXVI. The Sun is of a very pleasing and rejoicing quality: as Darkness and
Sadness are Companions, Job 30.11
so are Light and Joy. When the Heavens are obscured with black Clouds, the
whole Creation sympathizes, and looks sadly; but when the Clouds are scattered,
and the Sun appears in its native Brightness, its Light is sweet, and (as
Solomon says) It Is a pleasant thing for the Eyes to behold the Sun. Eccl. 11.7.


XXVII. The Sun makes the several Seasons of the Year, Winter and Summer,
Spring and Autumn, according to its access and recess to and from the several
and respective Climates. When it rises higher in our Horizon, it makes the
Spring, clothing every Bush with Leaves, and crowning the Gardens and Fields
with Flowers; but when the Sun retires, every thing hangs down its Head, the
Grass and Flowers wither, and all their Beauty and verdant Fragrancy vanish.

XXVIII. The Sun operates according to the Matter it shines upon. It softens
Wax, melts Snow and Ice, but hardens Clay. It causes a Dunghill to send forth a
more corrupt and unsavory Scent; but makes Roses, and other Blossoms yield a
more fragrant and delightful Odor.

XXIX. The Sun is often covered with Clouds, and even in its Meridian Altitude
or Exaltation it is sometimes hid from our Eyes; yet nevertheless its powerful
Influence and Efficacy is not then gone.

XXX. Some cannot bear the powerful and scorching Heat of the Sun.

XXXI. The Sun drowns and swallows up the Glory of the lesser Luminaries, as
the Moon and Stars.

XXXII. When the gross Body of the Moon interposes betwixt us and the Sun, it
becomes eclipsed, either wholly or in part, in our Horizon.

XXXIII. The Sun is said to rejoice in his Course, as a strong Man that runs a
Race.

XXXIV. The Sun is of a ripening quality, makes all things ready for Harvest;
it ripens Tares as well as Wheat, bad as well as good Fruit.

Parallel.
I. THere is but one Sun of Righteousness; God has many adopted Sons, but he
has but one begotten Son: 1 Timothy 2.5
There is but one Mediator betwixi God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus; but one
Savior or Redeemer for Mankind, wherever they live throughout the whole
Universe.

II. Jesus Christ is Light in himself, respecting his Deity, the Fountain and
Perfection of Light and Glory. The Sea is not so full of Water, nor the Sun of
natural Light, Joh. 1.14.
as Christ is full of Grace and Divine Light.

III. Christ is clearer than the Sun, therefore much fairer than the Children
of Men; and needs must this be so, Psalm. 45.2.
he is the Brightness of the Father's Glory. Heb. 1.3.
O there is such Beauty, Purity, and Glory in him, that in his eternal Being
and Godhead we cannot behold him; but if we look down upon his human Nature,
where his Glory is veiled, he has been seen in the Flesh, he was visible, 1
Pet. 3 10
yet so as in him was no Spot, no Guile was found in his Mouth. He is
altogether lovely, Cant. 5 10 Heb. 4 13.
the chiefest among Ten Thousands: Before whose Eyes all things are naked, all
the abominable Thoughts, filthy Ways and Works of Men; yet he contracts no
Stain of Sin, nor did he when he conversed with Men in the Days of his Flesh
upon Earth.

IV. Christ has his Tabernacle in the Heavens, at the Father's right hand,
Heb. 7.25.
there to plead and make Intercession for us.

V. Jesus Christ communicates of his Influences and spiritual Light. There is
never a day, but Christ is ministering and giving forth Light and Goodness to
the World, especially to his Saints: Joh. 1.16.
Of his Fullness we all receive, and Grace for Grace.

VI. Jesus Christ rose and came forth out of the Bosom of the Father at God's
command. He spoke not but as he received Commission from the Father; he laid
down his Life, and took it up again, Joh. 10.10.
and all by the Commandment of the Father.

VII. Jesus Christ is an universal Light, good to all: I am, says he, Joh.
8.12.
the Light of the World. He enlightens every one that comes into the World,
either naturally, morally, or spiritually; he holds forth Light and Grace to
all. What Nation is the Gospel confined to? Mark 16.15.
Go unto all Nations, preach the Gospel to every Creature.

VIII. Jesus Christ is the great and only Potentate, Mat. 28.18 Heb. 1.2. Joh.
17.2. Ephesians. 1.22.
all Rule and Government is committed into his hands; it is He who makes Day
and Night in Souls and Nations. God has made all things subject under his Feet.

IX. Jesus Christ is infinite in Power, Wisdom, and Goodness; his Being and
Greatness are unmeasurable, respecting his Deity; a glorious and immense Being;
the Fullness of him that fills all things; there are no Bounds nor Limits to
his Greatness.

X. Jesus Christ communicates of his Fullness to the Angels. Col. 2.10. Ephesians.
1.21.
He is the Head of Principalities and Powers, etc. and to Saints, Prophets, and
Apostles, who are called Lights: Ye are the Light of the World. Mat 5.14. Joh.
1 9.
John Baptist is called a bright and shining Light: Yet are Saints but dark
Bodies of themselves, they have no Light but what they receive from Christ.

XI. What a dark and dolesom Dungeon, what a Babel of Confusion, what a worse
than Egyptian Slavery would this lower Creation be, if God should deprive us of
the Light of Christ, communicated in the Gospel by his Word and holy Spirit.

XII. Christ is wonderful; Isa. 9.6. 1 Timothy 3.16.
Angels and Saints for Love admire him; the World and Devils with Fear tremble
at his Name. He has the Admiration of Angels and Saints, and Consternation of
Devils and wicked Men. The Saints adore and worship him, as it is their Duty,
because he is God; and were there ten thousand Suns, the Saints would love and
admire Christ ten thousand times more than them all. He does so attract and
ravish their Hearts, by the beaming forth of the Rays of his Love on them, that
they open when he visits them, and shut when he withdraws, drooping and
languishing in his absence, and will not be kissed by any Lips, nor embraced by
any Arms but his.

XIII. The Motions and Operations of Christ are strong and powerful, Ephesians. 1.20.
as when he moves to convert Souls, to help and deliver his People, or in
revenging himself upon his and their Enemies.

XIV. Christ's Motions are swift and speedy. Psalm. 8.10. Cant. 2.8, 9.
He flies on the Wings of the Wind, and skips like a young Roe, especially when
he comes to help and relieve his People.

XV. Christ's Motions are constant, he is never out of action: Romans 8.34 Heb.
7.25.
He ever lives to make Intercession. He is always moving and working for his
Creatures good, tho in his Providence, Psalm. 77.1^^
because his Footsteps are in the dark, we are not able to discern him stir nor
move one foot, his Motion (like the Sun's) being certain, tho undiscernible.

XVI. Christ's Motions also are regular, that is, Joh. 12.^^9
wholly according to his Father's Will; that is the only way he takes, and the
Line out of which he never goes: Not my Will, but thine be done. Luke 22.42


XVII. Christ is unwearied and indefatigable in all his Movings, Workings, and
Journeyings for the Good of his People. His Bounty and Liberality do not waste
his everlasting Treasure of Grace, Col. 2.3. Ephesians. 3 19.
nor can his laying out diminish it; He is as powerful, as rich and glorious as
ever.

See the Metaphor Light.

XVIII. Christ appearing and rising upon the Soul, Acts 9.18.
drives away and expells Darkness, turns Night into Day, and scatters all the
Clouds and black Mists of Sin, Ignorance, and Unbelief, in the Soul; and not
only so, but also by the Influences of his Word, and glorious Operations of his
Gospel, he dispells the dark Fogs of Ignorance, Error, and Confusion in the
World.

XIX. The Lord Jesus, when he has scattered and drove away, by the glorious
and powerful Rays of his Word and heavenly Doctrine, all Error, Heresy, and
Antichristian Darkness, will make a lovely and glorious Day in the World, Isa.
60.1, 3, 4, 5, 19, 20. and 62.2.
as he does now in the Soul of a Believer.

XX. The Influences of Christ reach to every Creature; there is nothing in
Heaven, Earth, or Hell, which he finds not out; all things are naked to him,
Heb. 4.13. Psalm. 139.7* 8.
because his Eye is every where. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither
shall I fly from thy Presence? If I ascend up to Heaven, thou art there; and
if I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there, etc. Tho he be seated in
Heaven, yet his Hand reaches to the Earth, as well as his Eye. He is present,
by his Knowledge and powerful Working, in every place and corner of the Earth.

XXI. Christ exhales and dries up the stinking polluted Sinks of Sin and
Corruption, Isa 61.1. and 53.5. Mat. 9.20.
which else would infect and destroy the Souls of his People. He purifies the
inward Man, always refining it from the Dregs of the Flesh, and the Root of
Bitterness; and is therefore the Soul-Physician.

XXII. By the Spirit of Christ we are regenerated or born again. Holiness, Joh.
3.5. Gal. 5.22.
Faith, Love, Joy, etc. and all such precious Fruits, are the Productions of
the holy Spirit, through Christ. Such as lie (as it were) buried in the Grave
of Sin and spiritual Misery, Ephesians. 2.1.
shall (when the quickening Beams of this spiritual Sun shine upon their Souls)
have a Resurrection from that Death; and by its efficacy shall their Bodies
also be raised from the Dust at the last Day. Joh. 5.28. 1 Thessalonians. 4.16.


XXIII. The Beams of Gospel Light, and Divine Illumination, do not shine alike
in every Nation, nor in every Soul. In some European Countries, especially in
England, they are more bright and radiant than elsewhere. A great many Places
want the Comfort of this Spiritual Sun, more than Greenland wants the Presence
of the created Sun; for there the Sun shines half the year, but in many Heathen
Countries the Sunshine of the Gospel has not yet arose; yea, even in
Palestine, and the adjacent Countries, where it first shined most gloriously,
its Light is for the most part (if not altogether) removed, and communicated to
the Isles afar off, to the Glory of his rich and unspeakable Grace and Love to
us, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

XXIV. Christ warms and heats the Soul, which of it self is cold, earthly, and
of a benumbed Constitution. He sends the Comforter, by him we are quickened,
etc. He gives Rest, Joh. 14.16 Joh. 11.25
he is the Resurrection, and the Life of his People, and therefore their
Reviver. As a Refiner's Fire, he burns our Dross, Hay, Stubble, etc. And if
this Fire be cherished, it parches and dries up the Weeds and Trash, the Thorns
and Briars that grow in our Souls, as predominant Sin and Lust, all Self-love,
Corruption, and carnal Confidence, etc. which else would choke the Word, and
stiffle all good Motions in us. See Refiner.

XXV. Christ is the Light of Men. Joh. 1.4, 5, 9.
Natural or Moral Light is too dim (like the Moon) to discover the secret
Pollutions of the Soul; it cannot make you see the Corruption and Filth of such
as lie in their Blood, being Captives to Satan; the Heart does receive no
Light, but what comes from this Sun of Righteousness; without it which we shall
stumble and fall, converse with Sin which envenoms the Soul, and at last tumble
blindfold into Hell and eternal Damnation. By this blessed Light is discovered,
1. What Sin is, and its Nature and Consequences; for tho natural Conscience (if
it may be so called) arraigns us for Immorality, or any Breach of the Law of
Nature, yet it is too dark, and far short of discovering the horrid Filth and
abominable Evil of Sin in a Gospel-way; that is the Work of the Spirit, and
it is only spiritually discerned. 2. This spiritual Sun, or Gospel Light, shows
the sad and lamentable Condition of fallen Man by Sin. 3. How insignificant the
World, with all its outward Pomp and imaginary Glory, is to release him, and
afford any solid Content or Satisfaction. 4. It discovers the Craft and
Subtilty of Satan, that Arch-Enemy of Souls. 5. It reveals (as far as frail Man
can comprehend it) the Being of God, in his glorious Attributes, and most
sublime Perfections. 6. It holds forth the transcendent Excellency of Jesus
Christ, and the absolute Necessity there is for poor fallen Man to have an
Interest in him, in order to his Peace with God. 7. It informs us which are
false Ways, who are Heretics, where the false Church is, etc. Which are things
not to be known, but by the blessed Light of this Sun of Righteousness, shining
in his Word, viz. the holy Scriptures.

This Sun of Righteousness gives us Light and Direction in all the Ways of
God's holy Worship; this Soul-Guide leads in the right way of Wisdom, and in
the midst of the Paths of Judgment: He leads the Blind by a Way they knew not,
and makes Darkness Light before them, and crooked things straight. [ See the
Metaphor Light.]

XXVI. What can be so desirable, so comfortable, as the Light of God's
Countenance, to have this Sun of Righteousness shining on us? David accounted
it the one thing desirable, Psalm. 27.4.
That he might dwell in the House of the Lord all the days of his Life, to
behold the Beauty of the Lord; and to enquire in his Temple. If the Beams of
this spiritual Sun be withdrawn, the Soul is restless till it finds them,
seeking every where, and crying out with the Spouse, Saw ye him whom my Soul
loves? Cant. 3.2. Psalm. 63.2, 3.
His Favor and Loving Kindness is better than Life.

XXVII. When Christ draws near the Soul by his heavenly Influences, he causes
it to become green and flourishing. When this Gospel-Sun rises high, and shines
hot in any Kingdom or Country, it causes them wonderfully to flourish, it
fertilizes Souls and Nations, and makes them to bring forth beautiful Blossoms,
and wholesome Fruit; but in his Retreats and Withdrawings, how do they languish
and pine away! Cant. 5.6.
It Is Night where Christ is absent, and Day where he is present. His being at a
distance is the Soul's Winter, and his blessed Approach is Summer. As Birds
chant their warbling Notes in the Spring, rejoicing at the Sun's coming; so do
the Saints with spiritual Melody congratulate the Approaches of Christ.

XXVIII. Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, shining forth in the manifestation
of the Gospel, causes the Heart of one Man to dissolve and melt like Wax, Luke
22.61, 62. Act. 2.37. Act. 16.29, 30.
distilling him into Tears of Repentance; others are hardened and grow obdurate
as a Rock, not through the Gospel's fault, but their own obstinate and
rebellious Minds. To some the Word is a Savor of Life unto Life, 2 Cor. 2.15,
16.
and to others a Savor of Death unto Death.

XXIX. Christ is often veiled, so that we cannot see him, viz. when strange and
dark Providence attend us, as in the case of Job. How often do our Sins
interpose like Clouds, betwixt us and this blessed Sun of Righteousness,
leaving our Souls in the dark? Yet in these Withdrawings the Soul is sensible
that his Efficacy and Virtue are not removed.

XXX. Some (like Felix) cannot bear the powerful Influences of Christ's Word
and heavenly Doctrine. Act. 24.25*


XXXI. The dazzling Light, and transcendent Glory of Christ exceeds all the
Glory of the World, and all that is therein; their Light is but Darkness, when
compared to him.

XXXII. The Sun of Righteousness is to us eclipsed, when this World gets
between us and Christ, when our Hearts and Eyes are so much upon it, that we
cannot see him in his Beauty. Christ is never totally eclipsed to a gracious
Soul, because Sin is infinitely less than him.

XXXIII. Jesus Christ rejoices in doing the Work of the Father; his Meat and
Drink was in doing the Will of him that sent him: Lo, I come to do thy Will, O
God. Heb. 10.7.


XXXIV. Christ by his blessed Word, through the Influences of the holy Spirit*
ripens his chosen Ones for the Harvest, Mat. 13.30
which is the end of the World, and prepares them for Glory: And the Wicked,
through their own Perverseness, are fitted, as Vessels of Wrath, for
Destruction. Romans 9.22




Metaphor.
I. THe Sun is a Creature, and had a beginning; and when Time is swallowed up
of Eternity, it will set and rise no more. Joh. 1.3.


II. The Sun gives Light, but cannot give Sight; the Sunbeams, tho never so
powerful, cannot make a blind Man see.

III. The Sun shines but in one Hemisphere at once; when it rises to us, it
sets to our Antipodes.

IV. The Sun has endamaging as well as healing Qualities, defaces Beauty,
makes Men faint; Fruits are sometimes withered to nothing by it. Cant. 1.6.


V. The Sun is inanimate, has neither rational, sensitive, nor vegetative
Life, tho in some sense called the Fountain of Life.

VI. The Sun is the Servant of Men, from the Root (...) to minister. It Is
Idolatry to worship it.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ is God, in his Essence uncreated, and without beginning*
Christ endures for ever, Rev. 1.8.
he is Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last.

II. Christ gives Sight as well as Light, he made the Blind to see. Mat. 20.30
He also cures spiritual Blindness, as Readiness, by Ananias, Acts 9.17.

III. Christ is able to shine over the whole World at once. It may properly be
said of him, as of the King of Assyria, The Stretching out of his Wings are
able to cover the World at one moment. Isa. 8.8.


IV. Christ has no hurtful quality; he quickens the Soul, never makes it
faint. He makes Deformity beautiful and lovely, ripens, but never withers the
Fruits off Grace. His Beams are destructive to none, but such as have no root;
Mat. 13.6.
such indeed he withers.

V. Christ has Life, Light, and Heat, and is often in Scripture called our
Life; Col. 3.3, 4.
for he gives and maintains both natural and spiritual Life.

VI. Christ is our Lord, whom Men and Angels must worship; all the Host of
Heaven adore him. It Is gross Impiety not to worship him.



Inferences.
I. HEnce we may learn to know the Worth and Excellency of Christ, as also the
indispensible and absolute Necessity every Soul lies under of receiving Divine
Illuminations from this everlasting Sun: for as natural Bodies perish without
the Influence of the natural Sun; so will Souls, if the Sun of Righteousness
give not his Life-cherishing Efficacy.

II. Hence we may also see, how greatly we are concerned to pray earnestly to
God, that our Hemisphere may never be deprived of this Sun of Righteousness,
nor overspread with the Clouds of superstitious Popery, nor other Heretical
Errors and Darkness.

III. This may show the Folly and Madness of such as would drive the Light of
the Gospel out of the World: 1. In respect of the Wrong and Injury they would
do the World thereby, if they could effect it. 2. Their Inability to accomplish
it.

IV. Hence we may infer the Necessity of laboring whilst it is day; we know
not how soon our Sun may set, and we are not sure of another. The Lord thus
threatens the Prophets, that cause the People to err, I will cause the Sun to
go down at Noon, etc. Which Judgment the Lord God in Mercy deliver England
from. Amos 8.9.


Christ the Root of David.
Rev. 22.16. I am the Root and Offspring of David, etc.


THere is a great and glorious Mystery in these Words; many understand not how
Jesus Christ should be the Root, and yet the Offspring of David. This Text
agrees with those Words of our Savior, If David called him Lord, Caryl o^^ Job
29.19.
how then is he said to be his Son? They understood him not. Christ, as he is
God, is David's Lord, and the Root of David: but as he is Man, he is his
Offspring, and hence elsewere called the Branch.

Christ is and may fitly be called and compared to a Root.

The Root of 1. Grace. 2. Glory.


Metaphor.
I. A Root is that from whence the Tree and Branches do proceed.

II. A Root is a thing hidden in the Earth, and not obvious or visible to the
Eye.

III. A Root has Life, nay, it is the Center of Life: the Life of any Tree or
Plant is principally in the Root.

IV. The Root bears the Body of the Tree, and all the Branches thereof.

V. The Root communicates Sap and Nourishment unto the Body, and all the
Branches thereof.

VI. The Body and Branches have a necessary dependence on the Root.

VII. There is much Life and Sap in the Root, when the Tree and Branches seem
dead, dry, and sapless.

VIII. As is the Soundness and Firmness of the Root of a Tree, the more sound,
firm, and stable is the Tree it self, with the Branches thereof; these being
likely to endure, when those that have no Root fall away.

IX. The Root is best secured of any part of the Tree, being excellently
fortified by Nature in the Earth.

X. Those that would utterly destroy the Tree, strike at the Root.

XI. The Root communicates of the same Life and natural Virtue to the Tree and
Branches.

Parallel.
I. FRom the Lord Jesus Christ, the Root of David, all Believers do proceed: I
am the Vine, ye are the Branches. See Christ the true Vine.

II. The Deity or Divine Nature of Jesus Christ is a hidden thing, cannot be
seen with mortal Eyes. Christ's Glory was veiled under Afflictions, Reproaches,
Poverty, etc. as a Root is under the Earth.

III. In the Lord Jesus Christ is Life; He is called the Way, the Truth, Jo^^.
5.26.
and the Life. As the Father has Life in himself, the Son also has Life in
himself. Life is in Christ, as Sap is in the Root of a Tree.

IV. The Lord Jesus Christ, this Root, bears up his Church, Romans 11.
and every Member thereof.

V. The Lord Jesus Christ conveys Sap and Nourishment to all his Church, and
every particular Believer or Branch thereof; hence he is called our Life. Col.
3.3.


VI. The Saints and Church of God have the like dependence on the Lord Jesus
Christ: Without thee we can do nothing. Joh. 15.5.


VII. There is much Sap and Life in Jesus Christ for the Godly, when oft-times
they seem like withered and dry Branches.

VIII. The Goodness, Firmness, and Soundness of this Divine Root, the Lord
Jesus Christ, shows us the very happy, steadfast, and secure State of the
Church. This Root cannot fail nor decay, and consequently the Church and People
of God shall endure and stand against all the Storms and Blasts of the Devil,
Antichrist, Mat. 13.16
and all wicked Enemies.

IX. The Lord Jesus Christ is secured from Hurt and Danger, (whilst his Church
is daily exposed thereunto) being hid in God, as it were: You are dead* Col.
3.3.
and your Life is hid with Christ in God.

X. The Devil's grand Design being utterly to destroy all the Godly, struck
most furiously at Jesus Christ, the blessed Root. Mat. 4.5, 6


XI. Christ communicates of his Spirit and Divine Nature to his Church: Romans 11.
If the Root be holy, even so are the Branches. Be ye holy, even as I am holy.
He that has this Hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 1 John 3.3.




Metaphor.
I. NAtural Roots of Trees and Plants are in the Earth.

II. Natural Roots, as well as the Body and Branches, decay, grow old, Job 14.8.
and die: Tho the Root thereof wax old, etc. says Job.

III. A natural Root usually bears but one Tree; if it bears (as some Roots do)
many Bodies, yet not all of one species or kind; there may be many thousands of
Roots.

IV. Natural Roots are subject to the Wills, Humors, and Pleasures of Men.

Disparity.
I. BUt this blessed Root, the Lord Jesus Christ, is in Heaven. Heb. 9.24.


II. This Root of Believers, the Lord Jesus Christ, never grows old, decays,
nor dies: Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, Heb. 13.8.
to day, and for ever.

III. Christ is a Root that gives consolation and satisfaction to all. He was
the Root of the Church both before and since his Incarnation, both Triumphant
and Militant; the Root of Abraham, Job, David, etc. and of all the Prophets and
Saints that ever had spiritual Life in them.

IV. The Lord Jesus Christ is a Root which neither Men nor Devils can touch,
destroy, or dig up, for he is God.



Application.
Object. HEre we may enquire, If Jesus Christ be the Root of David, how is he
said to be the Stem or Branch out of the Root of Jesse? Is Jesse Christ's Root,
and yet is Christ the Root of Jesse?

Ans. Jesse is the Root of Christ according to his human Nature, and Christ is
the Root of Jesse according to his Divine Nature; as he is (...) God and Man in
one Person, he is both these, viz. the Root and Branch (...)

Doct. From hence note, That Christ is God.

Isa. 9.6. 1 John 5.20 Jude 25. Romans 9.5. Joh. 1.2, 3. Heb. 1.10. Joh. 21.17
Mat. 9.1, 2, 4. Mark 2.5, 6, 7. Luke 5.21. Zech. 2.19. Joh. 10.16 1 Cor. 4.7.
Joh. 5.23.
1. He is called God, the mighty God, the true God, the only wise God, and God
blessed for ever. 2. He made the World, all things in Heaven and Earth: (...)
of the Earth, and the Heavens are the Work of his Hands. 3. He (...), was
before all things, and by him all things consist. 4. He is omniscient, knows
all things, etc. 5. He searches the Heart. 6. He is the first and the last,
Alpha and Omega. 7. He ought to be prayed unto, all Divine Worship and
Spiritual Adoration belongs to him. 8. He has Power to forgive Sins. See the
Metaphor where the Word is compared to Light.
9. He thought it no Robbery to be equal with God. 10. He had Power to raise
himself and others from the Dead: Ergo, He is the eternal God.

Jesus Christ is the Root of Nature, as well as of Grace and Glory, tho we run
the Metaphor under that Notion.

Infer. I. If Christ be the Root of all the Grace that the Saints and the
Church receive, then from hence we may justly infer, That all the Divine
Goodness any Person or Persons have in them, they derive from Christ; it is He
that makes one Man to differ from another: Who made thee to differ? etc. What
have thou that thou have not received?

II. From hence we infer, That as Christ is God, so he ought to have all the
Glory. All should honor the Son, as they honor the Father.

III. Then let us fear to offend him, and let all our dependence be upon him,
etc.

IV. What is thy State and condition, Sinner? Thou have heard Christ is the
Foundation and common Root of all Believers, art thou taken out of the dead and
corrupt Root of Mankind, viz. the first Adam, and engrafted into Christ? Do
thou grow upon this living Root? does thy Fruit flow from spiritual Union with
him?

V. If thou art not taken out of that evil, fruitless, and sapless Root, labor
now to be transplanted, get an Interest in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Root of
David.

VI. This shows the happy State and blessed Condition of the Church and People
of God: Joh. 14.19
Because I live, says our Divine Root, ye (my Branches) shall live also. Although
the Graces of his Saints may sometimes seem to fail, and their Greenness decay,
yet out of this full and blessed Root shall they have sufficient Supplies: For
in him all Fullness dwells. Joh. 1.16.


Christ the true Vine.
Joh. 15.1. (...). I am the true Vine: And Verse 5. I am the A Vine, in Latin,
Vitis, quia lenta, because flexible, from Vi^^o^^, to bind with Twigs; or as
Scaliger says, ex ferendo Vino, because it bears Wine. It Is called in Greek
(...), from the Adverb (...), una, cum, together, with; of the Hebrew (...),
Ham, cum, and (...), which in the Ioniam Dialect signifies Wine. It Is called in
Heb. (...) Kerem, a Vine or Vineyard; or, (...), Gephe^^, etc.
Vine.


IN this Text the Lord Jesus Christ is pleased to express what he is to his
Church and People, by the elegant Metaphor of a Vine; the Nature and Properties
of which, with the Parallels and Disparities follow.

Metaphor.
I. THe Vine seems not so lovely, stately and amiable to look upon as some
other Trees; it is not so high and lofty as the Cedar, nor to be compared for
strength to the Oak; nor for Beauty to the Palm or Firr-Tree.

II. The Vine nevertheless has a more honorable Name given to it than other
Trees. The Lord's choicest Plantation (the Church) is expressed by it; and
therefore it is dignified with the Title of Goodly and Noble. Ezekiel. 17.8 Jer.
2.21. Psalm. 80.9.


III. The Vine gives large Shoots, grows much in its young and tender Age, and
brings forth Fruit in a short time after it is planted.

IV. The Vine wonderfully abounds with Sap, and inward Virtue, bearing and
nourishing many large Branches, which spread exceedingly; yet all partake of
its Root and Fatness (as it is said of the Olive Tree) where there is enough to
feed all, Romans 17.17.
and make them flourish and bear Fruit abundantly.

V. The Vine is a most fruitful Plant. A great Naturalist tells us of one
Stock, one single Vine planted by the Empress Livia, Plin. l. 14. c. 4.
that yielded 12 Amphoras (that is, 108 Gallons of our measure) of good Wine
yearly. There are sometimes found hundreds of Grapes upon one Cluster, several
Clusters upon one Branch, and abundance of Branches upon one Stock. The
Scripture when it would express Plenty, borrows a Term from the Vine, which
denotes Increase. Psalm. 128.3.
Thy Wife shall be as a fruitful Vine upon the Walls of thy House.

VI. The Vine brings forth pleasant Fruit, sweet and delightful beyond others;
it is said to make glad the heart of Man. Give Wine to those that are of heavy
heart; Psalm. 104.15. Prove. 31.6, 7.
let them drink and forget their Poverty, and remember their Misery no more.
When the new Wine languisheth, the merry-hearted do sigh; Isa. 24.11.
all Joy is darkened, the Mirth of the Land is gone.

VII. The Vine yields profitable Fruit; The Blood of the Grape (as it is called,
Deuteronomy. 32.14.) is a great Strengthener and Supporter of Nature. Paul advises
Timothy to drink a little Wine for his Stomachs sake, 1 Timothy 5.23.
and often-infirmity. The good Samaritan is said to pour in Oil and Wine into
the Wounds of the Man that fell among Thieves. Luke 10.34.


VIII. The Vine is a shadowy Plant, its spreading Branches and large Leaves
afford a delightful and refreshing Shade, and is therefore used for covering of
pleasant Arbors.

IX. It Is a very soft and tender Plant; so that if it be, cut bruised, or any
way wronged, it will abundantly weep and bleed out its Sap and Moisture, as
Naturalists report.

Hieron. Tragu^^ in his Com. de Stirp. l. 3. p. 1059.
X. An eminent Writer says, That the Tears of the Vine (like Gum congealed in
the Stock of it) dropped into dim Eyes, remove the little Clouds that begin to
gather there, drive away Darkness, and clear the Sight: And further says, Quid
possit Vitis, and alia quae fundit, sermon explicare nemo potest; that no
Tongue could sufficiently tell the Virtues of the Vine: Plin. l. 14.1.
the like says Pliny.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ in his state of Humiliation, did not appear in that outward
Glory, Pomp and Magnificence, which the proud Grandees of the Earth glitter in;
he was not entertained with the Royalties of Imperial Palaces (for his Kingdom
was not of this World. Mat. 8.20. Joh. 18.36.
) He was looked upon in comparison of the Mighty Men, who are compared to the
Cedars of Lebanon, and Oaks of Bashan, as a poor mean and contemptible Shrub;
as the Prophet foretold: He shall grow up before him as a Tender Plant, Isa.
53.2, 3.
and as a Root out of a dry Ground; he has no Form nor Comeliness, and when we
shall see him, there is no Beauty, that we should desire him.

II. Jesus Christ has a Name above every Name; Phil. 2.9.
he infinitely excels whatsoever is good, great and glorious in Angels, Saints
and Men. Heb. 1.14.
The spendor and Stateliness of Monarchs Courts is nothing in comparison of
that unexpressible Luster and Majesty that surrounds him. The Heavenly
Luminaries are dim to him; he is the Royal Offspring of Heaven, of the sublimest
Extraction. When he brings the first begotten into the World, he says, Heb.
1.6.
and let all the Angels of God worship him.

III. Christ when in his young and tender Age, Luke 2.52.
grew much in favor both with God and Man; and when he was twelve years old,
disputed with the Learned Doctors, hearing them, and asking them Questions;
Luke 2.46, 47.
and all that heard him were astonished at his Understanding and Answers, etc.

IV. J^^sus Christ is full of Life and Divine Virtue; the Treasuries of his
communicable Graces are immense and unspeakable; Col. 1.19.
Joh. 1.14.
All Wisdom and Knowledge are hid in him: In him all Fullness dwells: his People,
mystically united to him, are his Branches; them he supplies with spiritual
Quickening, Nourishment and Growth, and though scattered over many Kingdoms and
Nations, his Protection environs them round about, provides a sufficient Supply
for their spiritual Wants, which is to be found no where else. Joh. 15.6.
If a Man abide not in me, (says he) he is cast forth as a Branch that is
withered, etc.

V. Christ the Spiritual Vine, is not only a green, spreading and flourishing
Plant, but also exceeding fruitful; he was so in his Life, Acts 10.38. 1 Cor.
13.
going up and down doing good, both to the Bodies and Souls of Men; fruitful in
his Death. In that Cluster there is much choice Fruit; Dan. 9.24.
as Atonement, Reconciliation, Redemption, Victory over Sin and Satan, the
abolishing of the Law, and establishing the everlasting Righteousness: he was
fruitful in his Resurrection, Ascension, Intercession, etc. The Graces of the
Spirit, Holy Ordinances, Hos. 14.8.
and Promises of Eternal Life, are all Fruits of this heavenly Vine; from him
is all our Fruit found. See Metaphor Light.

VI. The Lord Jesus brings forth the most pleasant and most desirable Fruit. I
sat down under his Shadow with great delight, says the Spouse, Cant. 2.1.
and his Fruit was pleasant to my Taste. No Cup so refreshing as the Cup of
Divine Consolation. Ephesians. 2.1, 5, 6.
No Wine nourishes or quickens the Body so much as the Love of Christ, Peace
with God, Reconciliation, Pardon of Sin, Justification, Adoption, etc. Psalm.
34.8.
These Blessed Fruits of this mystical Vine do cheer, feed and enliven a
Drooping and Languishing Soul.

VII. The Lord Jesus yields Fruit every way profitable. 2 These. 2.17. Romans 1.5.
Romans 5.11. 2 Cor. 4.1.
All the Good that Soul or Body is capable to receive, flows from him, and is
the Fruit of his Love, purchased by his Death, and communicated by his Word and
Holy Spirit: It warms, supports and strengthens the Souls of his People. His
Grace is of a healing, Ephesians. 2 5, 8. Psalm. 103.4
quickening, and vivifying nature. See Metaphor, Wine and Ointment, etc.

VIII. Jesus Christ is a Shadow to his Church, a hiding place from the Wind,
Cant. 2.3. Isa. 32.2.
and a Cover from the Tempest; as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land:
He defends from the Rage of Satan, from Sin, from the Fury of Man in the heat
of Persecution; yea from the wrath of God, 2 Samuel 22.2, 3, 4. Isa. 53.5. Lam.
3.22.
by which (were it not for the interposition of this blessed Skreen or Shade)
we should be scorched, burnt, yea utterly consumed. See Rock, Apple Tree, etc.

IX. Christ, the Spiritual Vine (being affronted, Luke 19.41
rejected and abused by the rebellious, obstinate and unbelieving Jews) when he
approached and beheld the City, Mark 3.4.
He wept over it, was grieved for the hardness of their Hearts; Mat. 26.38.
but more especially when he came under the execution of Divine Wrath for Man's
sake, and in his stead, which he did willingly undergo; Isa. 53.7. Luke 22.44
how did his bruised and abused Body sweat (as it were) great drops of Blood,
until he yielded up his blessed Life and precious Spirit for us?

X. The Grace of Christ, Rev. 3.^^8.
the Spiritual Vine, is precious Eye Salve, which removes those thick Clouds of
Darkness and Ignorance that are upon the Understanding; by which a Soul
spiritually comes to have a clear Prospect of those never-fading Glories of the
other World, and plainly discerns the gilded Follies and transitory Vanities of
all things here below. In a word, no Tongue can sufficiently exalt the
transcendent Virtues of this ever-blessed Vine.



Metaphor.
I. THe Vine is a Plant of an earthly Extract; the choicest and goodliest are
only the Plantation of Men.

II. The Vine is not always green; the Leaves fall off in Winter. You may look
for Fruit when the Vintage is gathered, and find none.

III. The Fruit of the Vine taken to excess, is offensive to God, hurts and
injures the Soul, breeds Diseases and destructive Humors in the Body, bereaves
Men of Reason, intoxicates the Brain, etc.

IV. The Fruit of the Vine diminishes, by gathering Cluster after Cluster you
may soon strip it off all.

V. The Fruit of the Vine is only good for the Body.

VI. The Vine wants Support; unless it be underpropt, it falls, being not able
to bear the weight of its own Branches.

Disparity.
I. CHrist is of an heavenly Original and Extraction, Joh. 6.51.
a Vine of God's own planting, who prepared a Body for him, Heb. 10.5.
and appointed him to the work of Redemption. He is the true Vine, Joh. 15.1^^
and God the Father is the Husbandman; no other could plant so Noble a Vine as
Christ is.

II. Christ, the Spiritual Vine, perpetually flourishes, always abounds with
Fruit, and knows no Winter; he is the same from Generation to Generation, Heb.
13.8. Jam. 1.17.
yesterday, to day, and for ever, without variation, or shadow of turning;
there is always a full Vintage, that never diminishes, withers, nor decays,
never grows old, but ever remains in its full growth and absolute Perfection.

III. The Fruit of Christ, the Spiritual Vine, never hurts any; no danger of
Surfeit here; the more you eat and drink the better it is; here is no fear of
Excess. The Wine of Consolation neither gluts nor inflames, nor intoxicates,
but nourishes, and feeds the Soul, still begetting a sharper Appetite for more.

IV. All the Believers in the World may partake plentifully of the Fruit of the
Spiritual Vine (the Lord Jesus) every day, Mat. 5 6. Mat. 11.28. Isa. 55.1.
yea, every moment; there is enough for Millions, and to be taken freely, yet
the Store is never the less. How many have been nourished thereby since the
beginning? yet it is as full as ever, and so will ever be.

V. This Fruit is good for the Soul; it comforts and revives the Inward Man.

VI. Christ the Spiritual Vine, is of excellent Strength and Ability to support
his spiritual Branches, (the Saints) and needs no help from any another.



Corollaries.
I. FRom this Metaphor we may learn what an infinite Blessing and unspeakable
Mercy the Lord Jesus Christ is to his Church, and all true Believers; how
helpless Saints are of themselves; for the Branches cannot stand without his
Divine Support, nor bear Fruit, Jo^^. 15.4.
unless this blessed Root communicates Sap and Nourishment to them.

II. It shows what a sweet and blessed Union there is between Christ and
Believers; such a Relation as is betwixt the Root and Branches; it is a Mystical
(yet the nearest and most real) Union.

III. It shows, That our whole Dependence ought to be on Christ; for he only
can uphold us, as the Root does the Branches: Without him we can do nothing; we
can neither grow, Joh. 25.5.
bear Fruit, nor stand firm in a boisterous and tempestuous Season, nor suffer
for his Name; but with his help we can do all.

IV. It shows, That Christ is very sensible of all the Wrongs, Injuries and
Outrages that are done to his Saints: They that lay hold on, and offer Violence
to the Branches, Zech. 2.8.
come very near the Tree; such touch the Apple of his Eye. And let Believers be
sweetly comforted from hence; That under all their Decays, and want of more
Grace, there is abundance of more Sap and Spiritual Nourishment in the Root and
Body of this Blessed Vine, which (according to the nature of the Metaphor)
shall in due time be communicated to all the Branches, that are truly grafted
in him, which shall revive them, and make them flourish both with Leaves and
Fruit, to the Glory of God and their own Eternal Happiness.

This Humble Plant calls for our Imitation:
This Noble Plant deserves our Adoration:
Its early Fruit provides us early Food;
Its Plenty stores us with what is rich and good:
Its pleasing Sweetness gratifies our Taste;
Its Profit fills us without fear of Waste;
Its Shadow shelters from Extremes of Heat,
(Circling the Church) His choicest Cabinet;
A Tender Plant; How can we then abuse him?
An Eye Salve; healing all the Blind that use him.
Christ the Lilly of the Valleys.
Cant. 2.1. I am the Rose of Sharon; and the Lilly of the Valleys.


MOst Expositors agree that these (foregoing Words) are the Words of our
blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: I am the Rose of Sharon, and the Lilly
of the Valleys. Wherein he expresses his own Excellencies, to draw, allure and
enamour the Souls of those that love, and long after him: how fitly he may be
compared to a Rose we have showed in this Book, in some other Place, to which
we refer you. And as there is great and lovely Beauty and Amiableness set forth
by a Rose; so here, I shall by his Assistance, endeavor to set forth his
Delicious Qualifications, by a Lilly; the Lilly of the Valleys.

Metaphor.
I. A Lilly is a sweet and a fragrant Flower, yea of such a strong and
odoriferous Scent, that a Man's Senses (Naturalists say) will be easily
over-turn'd with the sweet Savor thereof.

II. A Lilly is white and very beautiful; within it are seven Grains or Seeds,
of the color of Gold, so amiable, that our Savior says, Solomon in all his
Glory was not adorned like one of these: Tagus p. 793.
for Whiteness it exceeds all Flowers.

III. It is observed that the Lilly is exceeding fruitful; Vna Radice
quinquagenos saepe emittente bubbos; one Root puts forth fifty Bubbs or
Colors. Plin. lib. 21. c. 5.


IV. Pliny says, The Lilly is the tallest of Flowers, c. 21. p. 5.
yet hangs down its Head.

V. The Lilly is a Flower that has many medicinal Virtues; the distilled Water
of a Lilly is good to restore a lost Voice, it helps Faintness, good for the
Liver, helps the Dropsy; and the Oil of it is good for diverse Maladies; Inquit
Galen.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus Christ may very fitly be compared to the Lilly, whose Savor
and spiritual Sweetness very much excels and transcends the Sweetest of any
Odours that can be mentioned; the Honey and the Honeycomb are sweet to the
smell, and sweeter to the taste: O then how sweet is the precious Savor of our
blessed Savior! See Rose of Sharon.

II. Whiteness denotes Holiness; it is said of the Bride, the Lamb's Wife, to
her was granted, that she should be clothed in White. And of those few Names,
Rev. 19.8.
in Sardis, which had not defiled their Garments, these (says Christ) shall
walk with me in white, for they are worthy. Purity is essential, Rev. 3.4.
originally, perfectly, and absolutely inherent in Christ; he is Holiness it
self, his Glory is infinite, within and without every way glorious; the
Perfection of Beauty.

III. Jesus Christ is exceeding fruitful, from this Root, (for so is he called)
how many Lillies, or holy, and heavenly Churches, have there sprung? yea, from
this Blessed Lilly many thousands of holy and sanctified Christians? See the
Metaphor of the Vine.

IV. Jesus Christ is higher than the Mighty Princes, Kings and Emperors of the
Earth, higher than Heaven or Angels, and yet humble and lowly in Heart;
Therefore he is compared to the Lilly of the Valley, in his Exaltations, as God
very high:* but in his Humiliation, he seems to hang down his Head.

V. The great and incomparable Virtue that is in the Lord Jesus Christ, is
excellently good to cure all the Diseases and Maladies of the Soul; it cures
Spiritual Blindness, it softens an hard Heart, it cures Stubbornness and
Obstinacy, by his blessed Infusion of Grace; in a word, there is no Malady too
hard for this Spiritual Physician. See Physician and Heart. And for other
Properties of the Lilly, see more where the Church is compared to it. For the
Disparity, See Rose of Sharon.



Application.
FRom hence we may seasonably learn to be humble, seeing the Lilly which is
said to be of a tall growth, yet hangs down its Head. As Christ is humble, so
Holiness and Humility are the glorious Ornaments of a Christian. That Christian
that has most Holiness, has most Humility. The Ear of Wheat which is well
kern'd and fullest, hangs down its Head most.

Christ under the Similitude of an Apple Tree.
Cant. 2.3. As the Apple Tree amongst the Trees of the Wood, so is my beloved
amongst the Sons; I sat down under his Shadow with great Delight, and his
Fruit was sweet unto my Taste.


AS Christ sets forth the Praise of his Church in the second Verse, She
excelling all the Daughters, as the Lilly did Thorns; so the Church sets forth
Christ's Glory and Praise in this; He excelling all the Sons, as far as the
Apple Tree excels all the Trees of the Wood.

Simile.
I. THe Apple Tree is very profitable to the Owner, as it is observed by some;
it far excels other Trees; hence Pliny s^^ith, there were many about the City
of Rome, which were set at a yearly Rent of two thousand Sesterties; yielding
them more Profit and Revenue by the year than a pretty good Farm.

II. The Apple Tree yields diversity of Fruit. It has (says Mr. Ainsworth)
more variety of Fruits than any other Tree that grows; it is not easy to reckon
up the various sorts of Apples.

III. The Apple Tree yields sweet and pleasant Fruit.

IV. The Apple Tree does wonderfully excel the wild and barren Trees of the
Desert, which bear no Fruit, or else that which is sour and unwholesome.

V. The Apple Tree, whether you take it in the Blossom, or when its Fruit is
fully ripe, is a very beautiful Tree, and to look upon very lovely and amiable.

VI. The Apple Tree in its Leaves, Buds, Blossoms, Fruits, etc. has very
sweet and comfortable Smells: Cant. 1.5.
The Spouse alludes to it when she cries to her Beloved to comfort her with
Apples.

VII. The Apple Tree, Naturalists observe, is a very tender Tree; Pliny says,
Pliny, lib. 17. c. 546.
it is the tenderest of all Trees.

VIII. An Apple Tree is a very shadowy Tree; its Shadow refreshes, and by
common Experience is found comfortable to sit under in the heat of the Day, etc.

IX. It Is a rare sight to see an Apple Tree grow in a Wood.

X. The Leaves and Fruit of the Apple Tree are Medicinal.

XI. An Apple Tree in the midst of the Trees of the Wood affords oftimes much
Refreshment to weary Travelers.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus Christ yields his Father more Profit, and brings more Glory
to him than all the Angels in Heaven, or Saints on Earth* do or ever did, and
not only brings Glory to God, but also infinite Profit to all his People, who
are Partakers of his Grace, Joh. 1.^^* ^^6.
and of the great plenty of Fullness that dwells in him.

II. Jesus Christ excels in variety of precious Graces. What good thing is
it that any true Believers wants, or can want of any sort, but it is to be had
in Jesus Christ, whether Grace or Gifts, things for the Soul, or things for the
Body, whether common or special Mercies? Joh. 1.16.
Of his Fullness all we have received, and Grace for Grace.

III. Jesus Christ the Divine Apple Tree bears most sweet and pleasant Fruit;
his Fruit was sweet (says the Spouse) to my Taste. See the Metaphor of the
Vine.

IV. Jesus Christ infinitely excels and surpasses all Objects and Things
whatsoever, He is the chiefest amongst ten thousand, Cant. 2.3.
yea, the chiefest in the whole World, none like to him in Heaven or Earth.

V. Jesus Christ is very beautiful; whether you consider him in his
Incarnation, or Exaltation, he is most amiable and lovely, Joh. 1.14.
We beheld his Glory as the Glory of the only begotten Son of God, etc.

VI. How transcendently sweet is the Scent and Odor of our Blessed Savior!
How sweet are the Comforts of his Spirit, his Word and heavenly Doctrine! Thy
Word, says David, Psalm. 1.19.
is sweeter than Honey or the Honeycomb; Words fitly spoken are like Apples of
Gold in Pictures of Silver: Prove. 25.11.
God's Word is not only sweet, but rare and valuable; Christ is wholly
delectable, his Conception, Birth, Life, Death, Burial, Resurrection, Ascension
and Intercession smell exceeding sweet. See Vine.

VII. Christ is of a soft and tender Heart, full of Bowels, of Compassion to
poor Sinners; weeping over perishing ones, and thus 'twas foretold of him by
the Prophet; He shall grow up as a tender Plant, Isa. 53.2.
and as a Root, out of the dry Ground.

VIII. Jesus Christ is a Shadow many ways to his Church; Cant. 2.5.
I sat down under his Shadow with great Delight; Psalm. 17.8. Isa 4.6. Isa.
25.4. Isa. 32.2. Psalm. 57.1^^ Psalm. 91.1.
He is a Cover from the scorching heat of the Wrath of God, a Shadow for need;
and he is a Shadow for Delight, Refreshing and Pleasantness. Shadow is often
used in Scripture to denote Protection and Mercy. See Rock, Habitation, Vine,
etc.

IX. It was a rare sight to see Jesus Christ in the days of his Flesh, dwelling
in the Wood of this World amongst Men.

X. The Leaves of this Tree of Life, are for the healing of the Nations. Rev.
22.1.


XI. So when a poor, weary Soul, or spiritual Pilgrim meets with this Divine
Apple Tree, and partakes of the Fruit thereof, he is sweetly refreshed and
supported thereby.



Metaphor.
I. AN Apple Tree is subject to decay; in time it does wither and dye.

II. The Fruit of the Apple Tree will soon rot and come to nothing.

III. The Fruit of the Apple Tree has some pernicious Qualities in it, it is
only external and it perishes in the using.

IV. An Apple Tree has no Fruit, Leaves, nor refreshing Shadow on it, for one
great part of the Year.

Disparity.
I. THe Lord Jesus Christ never decays, nor cease from yielding Fruit.

II. But the Fruit of the Lord Jesus Christ is incorruptible, and will never
fade nor decay, it endures for ever.

III. But Christ's Fruit has no bad nor hurtful Quality; it is sweet, but
surfeits not, breeds no Worms; but on the contrary, purges the Soul from all
inward Filth, and makes it healthful; this Fruit is satsifying. The Spouse by
eating herereof had abundance of Rest, Peace, Content and Satisfaction.

IV. There is Fruit always to be found on Christ, and a refreshing Shadow; this
Tree is ever green and knows no Winter. Heb. 13.8.




Application.
I. IS Christ compared to an Apple Tree, among the Trees of the Wood: Then from
hence we may infer, not only the Excellency of the Lord Jesus above others, but
Sinners* Strangers, and whoever will, may come to him and eat of his Fruit, and
sit down under his Shadow; He, the Tree of Life, is not pal'd, fenced, nor
walled in, as such which are planted in a Garden or Orchard, Joh. 55.1. Rev.
2.2.
nor is there an Angel or flaming Sword, to keep the way of this Tree of Life;
nor is the Fruit of this Tree forbidden. An Apple Tree in a Wood is common and
free to all, Joh. 7.37.
poor Beggars and Strangers may have free Access thither, and who will forbid
them? Whoever will, may come and partake of Christ's Fruit freely.

Motive.
II. Be exhorted then (Sinner) to hasten to the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the
Tree of Life.

1. Consider the Barrenness and Unfruitfulness of all other Trees, or Objects
of the World, that grow in the wide Wilderness where you live; what is all the
Fruit of earthly Pleasure, Profits and Honors of this Life, to the Fruit of
Jesus Christ? To Pardon, Peace of Conscience, Communion with God, Eternal Life?
etc. Let us more particularly consider the nature of Christ's Fruit:

2. It Is exceeding sweet and pleasant to the Taste, 'twill sweeten all your
Bitters.

3. It Is safe Fruit, it will do you good abundantly, and no hurt, nothing is of
a surfeiting Nature in it.

4. It Is satisfying Fruit, no other Fruit can satisfy; not only good for Food,
but choice and satisfying Food!

5. There is store of Fruit on this Tree, see how the Tree hangs! the Boughs
thereof are wonderfully laden, the Plenty is great in this; it is like the Tree
spoken of by Daniel. Dan. 4.12.


6. Its Fruit is lovely and delightful to the Eye; do not the Looks of these
Apples invite you?

7. Its Fruit is durable, cannot corrupt nor decay.

8. It Is the Tree of Life. Eat of this Fruit, and thou shall not dye, but live
for ever: Such are past from Death to Life, and shall not come into
Condemnation; Joh. 5.2^^.

9. It Is Fruit that those that eat thereof, shall be made wise by it.

10. It yields a sweet Smell, comforting under Faintness.

11. It is medicinable, the Fruit of this Tree will purge out the evil Venom
and horrid Poison, that came into our Natures by old Eve's eating of the
forbidden Fruit, contrary to the Command of God.

12. Its Shadow is most excellent for refreshing, it gives great Consolation;
yea, the greatest Consolation to poor fainting, wear^^ed Souls, that willingly
sit down under this Tree.

1. He shelters from the scorching heat of God's Wrath due for Sin.

2. He shelters, or is a Covert from the hurt and heat of Persecutors or Rage
of such.

3. It Is a delightful Shadow, Refreshing to the weary Soul, and in a troublsome
Land a sweet Resting Place.

4. It Is a Shadow that yields full Content and Satisfaction, -- I sat down; in
the Text, signifies, her acquiescing there, or making her Abode under the same;
she desires no better nor no other Happiness, seeks no^^ to Angels, to Saints,
nor to her own Works. 1. I sat down with Delight; now this Delight is neither
carnal nor sinful, but it is spiritual. 2. It Is great Delight which the Church
has, even ravishing Joy. 3. It Is abiding and lasting Delight, increasing it
will be more and more, as it is said of the Light of the Righteous, it shines
more and more to the perfect Day. 4. This Delight is an Earnest of that Delight
which the Soul shall have in Heaven.

5. It Is a complete and perfect Shadow, it answers all Needs, a Shadow for the
Head, Heart, and every part, and at all times.

From hence we infer,

1. What great cause have we to admire the Goodness of God; tho he denied us in
Adam to eat of that Tree of Life after the Fall, yet has he provided us
another Tree of Life to make us immortal!

2. What Fools are all those, who refuse to eat, and live for ever!

3. Let us also learn from hence, when we are faint and weary, to seek to none
but Christ, the Tree of Life, for Refreshment.

4. How happy are Believers, who sit under the Shadow of Christ's Protection,
his Ordinances and Divine Doctrine!

Christ an Ambassador.
Mal. 3.1. And the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come into his Temple, even
the Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in, etc.


THe Words, Ambassador, Legate, or Messenger, are synonimous Terms, properly
such as are commissioned or deputed betwixt distant Parties, to transact
Affairs of moment. The Term is applied to Christ, who is the Angel, Messenger,
or Ambassador of the Covenant, who not only transacted, but completed the Work
of Redemption, thereby reconciling God and Man, who were before at variance and
Enmity: Which shall be further manifested in the following Parallel.

Metaphor.
I. AN Ambassador or Messenger of Peace is an honorable Person, and usually a
great Favorite to the King.

II. An Ambassador is a wise Person, skilled in State Affairs, and knows how to
adjust National Differences, or to make up a Breach or Breaches that may be
between one Kingdom and another.

III. An Ambassador must be of known Integrity and Faithfulness, as well as of
Ability, great Trust being reposed in him.

IV. An Ambassador is appointed and made choice of to this great Employment,
and Place of Trust, by the determination and decree of the King.

V. A Person that is chosen to go an Ambassador, must accept of the Place and
Work, before he takes his leave of the Court.

VI. An Ambassador is entrusted with Matters of great weight and moment, things
that concern Peace and War, the Weal and Woe of Kingdoms and Nations.

VII. An Ambassador, as he is chosen, and entrusted with Matters of great
consequence; so likewise, that he might be invested with a Legal Power, he
receives a special Commission from the Prince or State he represents, which
does authorize him to that Work and Office.

VIII. An Ambassador, having received his Commission, leaves his own Kingdom,
and goes into that Country, to which his Prince has ordered him, there to
negotiate the Affairs that are committed unto him.

IX. An Ambassador of Peace represents the Person of the Prince or State that
sent him; so that the same Honor and Dignity, or Indignity, that is showed to
him, is showed thereby to the Sovereign whom he represents: And it is easy to
guess how much they esteem the Prince, by the Respects they pay to his
Ambassador.

X. An Ambassador is strictly tied to the prescribed Rules, Precepts, and
Directions, which are delivered to him, and does not, must not proceed contrary
unto them.

XI. An Ambassador is oftentimes sent to prevent or put an end to War, that
thereby great Effusion of Blood, Ruin, and Desolation might be stopped and
prevented.

XII. An Ambassador offers Terms, or makes Proposals to the adverse Party,
thereby finally to conclude and make a lasting Peace.

XIII. An Ambassador that has a tender Heart, is greatly grieved when he sees
his Mediation and merciful Terms of Peace to be slighted and rejected; and from
the consideration of the woeful Misery and Calamity that is like to follow, he
is the more importunate, using many Arguments to cause Compliance.

XIV. An Ambassador has many Servants, or a great Retinue waiting upon him,
and is a Person deserving much Honor, in discharging his Trust with very much
Awe and Fidelity to his Prince.

XV. An Ambassador has Power given him to ratify and confirm Articles of Peace
between Kingdoms and Nations, who are at variance, that so there may be
Commerce between them in future Times.

XVI. A faithful Ambassador is received with abundance of Joy at his return
home, and is highly preferred, as a Testimony of great Favor, for his Works
sake.

XVII. An Ambassador not having success in his Business, in bringing the
Adversary to amicable Terms of Peace and Reconciliation, many times against
those Nations or People that refuse, bloody War is proclaimed, and great
Desolation follows.

XVIII. An Ambassador is oftentimes an Instrument to save Thousands, and Ten
Thousands of Souls from Death, and Kingdoms from Fire, Sword, and Destruction;
and thereby he raises Trophies to his Fame and Glory.

Parallel.
1. CHrist, the Ambassador or Messenger of the Gospel of Peace, is a most
noble, honorable, and renowned Person, Lord of Lords, most excellent in Worth
and Dignity, one near-allied, 1 Timothy 6.15.
and a great Favorite in the Court of Heaven.

II. Jesus Christ, the Messenger of the Covenant, 1 Cor. 1.24. Romans 8.6. Ephesians.
2.13, 14, 16.
or God's Ambassador to Sinners, is full of Wisdom and Skill in all the grand
Affairs which concern the Glory of his Father, and the Welfare of Sinners: He
knows how to end the Differences between God and Man, and to make up that
grievous and destructive Breach that has been so long between them.

III. The Lord Christ has in him all the Perfections of the glorious Deity; He
is called the faithful and true Witness. Never did Ambassador act with such
Integrity to Prince and People, Col 1.19. and 2.3.
as Christ does between God and Sinners. He would not have God dishonored,
Romans 3.24, 26.
nor Man to miss of Pardon.

IV. Christ was chosen and appointed Messenger of the Covenant, by the
Determination, Counsel, Purpose, Acts 4.28. Acts 2.23.
and Foreknowledg of the King of Heaven; hence is Christ said to be a Lamb
slain from the Foundation of the World. Rev. 1^^.


V. The Lord Jesus Christ, when chosen to be sent on this great Embassy, or
Message of Peace to Sinners, readily accepted it: Lo, it is written in the
Volumn of the Book, I come to do thy Will, Heb. 10 8.
O God.

VI. Jesus Christ, the greatest Ambassador and Plenipotentiary of Heaven and
Earth, has Matters of such weight and moment committed to his Trust, that very
far exceed those things that concern Peace and War amongst Men and Nations; for
they are Matters in which are wrapped up the spiritual and eternal Weal or Woe
of all People and Nations of the World. He is entrusted with those high and
wonderful things, that concern the Glory of God, and the Peace and eternal
Felicity of our Souls.

VII. As Christ was chosen and ordained God's Messenger, and entrusted with the
great Concerns, and sole Management of the Covenant of Grace; so that he might
every way be rightly constituted, authorized, and empowered, he received a
special Commission from the Father. Joh. 12.49
He gave me Commandment what I should say, and what I should speak. I have a
greater Witness than that of John; Joh. 6.36.
for the Works which the Father has sent me to do, the same bear witness that
he has sent me.

VIII. Christ, that he might negotiate, and fully accomplish and complete the
great and important Affairs, of making Peace between God Almighty, and poor
Sinners, left his own Kingdom, and the Glory he had with the Father, and came
into this World: Gal. 4.4.
When the Fullness of Time was come, God sent forth his Son.

IX. Christ Jesus, the Messenger of the Covenant, represents the Person of God
himself; Mat. 10.40
so that whosoever reverences the Son, reverences the Father also: He that
receives me, Luke 10.16
receives him that sent me; and he that rejects me, rejects him that sent
me. The Father judges no Man, but has committed all Judgment to the Son, Joh.
5.22, 23.
that all Men should honor the Son as they honor the Father. He that
honors not the Son, honors not the Father which has sent him.

X. The Lord Jesus Christ did require and command nothing of Mankind, but what
was the absolute Will and Pleasure of the Father: My Doctrine is not mine, Joh.
7.16.
but the Father's that sent me* I lay down my Life, that I may take it up
again. Joh. 10.17, 18.
This Commandment received I of the Father, etc.

XI. Christ was sent to put an end to that dismal and desolating War, 2 Cor.
5.19. Romans 5 10
which was occasioned by Sin, and the horrid Breach of the first Covenant,
between God the Creator being offended, and the sinful, guilty, and rebellious
Creature. God was in Christ, reconciling the World to himself, etc. For if
whilst we were Enemies, Ephesians. 2.16, 17. Col. 1.21, 22. Mark 1.15* and 16.16.
Mat. 11.21, 22.
we were reconciled to God, by the Death of his Son; much more, being
reconciled, shall we be saved by his Life. And that he might reconcile both
unto God in one Body by the Cross, having slain the Enmity thereby. And came
and preached Peace to you that were afar off, and to them that were nigh. And
to you that were sometimes alienated, and Enemies in your Minds by wicked
Works, yet now has he reconciled in the Body of his Flesh, through Death.

XII. Christ, the Messenger of the Covenant, Mark 1.15*
offers gracious Terms of Peace and Reconciliation to Sinners: Repent, Mark
16.16. Mat. 11.28.
and believe the Gospel. Believe, and be baptized. He that believes, and is
baptized, shall be saved. Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden,
and I will give you Rest. O what sweet and easy Terms of Peace are these! It Is
but to acknowledge our own Guilt and Vileness, lay down our Arms, and accept of
Mercy by believing in the Lord Jesus. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all ye
Ends of the Earth. Whoever will, Isa. 45.22. Rev. 22.17*
let him take of the Water of Life freely.

XIII. Jesus Christ, the Messenger of the great God, was greatly grieved, to
see the Jews, to whom he was first sent, Luke 19.41, 42.
stubbornly to refuse and reject that glorious Salvation, offered to them by
himself. When he came near the City, he wept over it, Mat. 23.37.
saying, If thou had known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things
that belong unto thy Peace; but now they are hid from thine Eyes. O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, Luke 13.34.
how often would I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen gathers her
Chickens, and ye would not. O that Israel had hearkened unto me.

XIV. Jesus Christ has many Servants, who wait on him in the Accomplishment of
this great and glorious Work, Luke 22.43
viz. the holy Angels, and the blessed Apostles and Ministers of the Gospel.
The Lord Jesus deserves eternal Honor for this glorious Work: Let the Angels
of God worship him. Heb. 1.6*
All ought to honor the Son, as they honor the Father. At the Name of Jesus
every Knee shall bow.

XV. The Lord Jesus Christ ratified and confirmed the Covenant of Grace between
God and Man by his own Blood, and thereby opened a free Commerce with God: Ephesians.
2.18.
For through him we have access by one Spirit to the Father. Saints may with
boldness come to the Throne of Grace by the Blood of Jesus. Heb. 4.16.


XVI. The Lord Jesus, when he had done his Work, returned home unto his Father,
and is highly honored, being clothed with Glory and Majesty, Ephesians. 1.20.
and is set down at the right hand of God on high, far above Principalites and
Powers.

XVII. Those People and Nations that refuse the Offers of Grace and Peace made
to them by Jesus Christ, God proclaims War and eternal Death against them. He
that has the Son has Life; Joh. 3 36.
but he that has not the Son, has not Life, but the Wrath of God abides on
him. It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment,
than for that City. Mat. 10.14
If we sin wilfully, after we have received the knowledge of the Truth, there
remains no more Sacrifice for Sin, Heb. 10.26, 27.
but a fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, that shall
devour the Adversaries, and all those that have stubbornly refused the free
Tenders of Grace.

XVIII. Jesus Christ was and is the only Instrument in the hand of God to save
the World from utter Destruction and Ruin, and many Thousands of poor Sinners
from eternal Torments, under the incensed Wrath of an eternal God, and is
hereby become the everlasting Wonder and Praise of Men and Angels: Worthy is
the Lamb to receive Power, and Riches, Rev. 5.9, 10, 12, 13, 14.
Wisdom, Strength, etc. Thou wast slain, and have redeemed us to God by thy
Blood, etc.



Metaphor.
I. HUman Ambassadors are but weak, mortal, and unstable Men, and many times
cannot accomplish the Business they are employed about; or otherwise, by reason
of Unfaithfulness, betray the Right and Prerogative of their Sovereign.

II. Ambassadors among Men, tho nobly descended, yet always are of a lower Rank
than the Prince that sends them.

III. Ambassadors among Men are employed to make up National Differences only,
and appease the Wrath of Men.

IV. Ambassadors among Men, at their first Arrival to treat of Peace, appear in
much outward Pomp, Splendour, and worldly Grandeur.

V. Ambassadors amongst Men are sometimes very long and tedious, when they
begin, before they can effect the Issue or Product of their Negotiations.

VI. An Ambassador among Men, when he has made up a long and destructive
Breach between Kingdoms and Nations, and they are at perfect Peace and
Friendship, yet he cannot keep them always so, but in time new Discord arises,
and the Breach is as wide as it was before.

Disparity.
I. CHrist is God as well as Man, one mighty to save, perfect, all-wise,
stable, of one mind, no ways defective, able to accomplish all his Pleasure,
true to God, highly standing for his Honor, wills not that he should abate a
tittle of his Sovereignty; and rather than his Glory should be stained in the
least, to save Sinners he laid down his own Life, and has offered whatever the
Will and Counsel of God was.

II. Jesus Christ thought it no Robbery to be equal with God; Phil. 2.6, 7.
hence called God's Fellow, and the express Image of the Father's Person; and,
as touching his Divinity, Heb. 1.3.
not inferior to him.

III. Jesus Christ was chosen to make up the spiritual Breach between God and
Sinners, to appease his Wrath, Isa. 53.5, 6, 7.
and satisfy Divine Justice; Joh. 5.24.
that he might not only save Men's Bodies, but their Souls also; not to deliver
from natural only, Joh. 3.17.
but eternal Death.

IV. The Lord Jesus, when he came, when he appeared to the World, Luke 2.12*
it was in a low, mean, and contemptible Condition: He veiled his Glory, Phil.
2.6, 7, 8.
and made himself of no Reputation; and tho his Retinue was glorious, yet
invisible to the Men of the World.

V. Christ did the great Work of his Embassy in a short time: By one Offering
he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified; Heb. 10.14.
he soon removed the Enmity by the Blood of his Cross.

VI. This blessed Ambassador having made Peace between God and Believers, this
League and Covenant by means of his Mediation is everlasting, this Peace shall
not, cannot ever be broken, 2 Samuel 23.5.
it is well ordered in all these things, and sure, being confirmed by Blood and
the Oath of God; Heb. 6.16, 17.
For the Mountains shall depart and the Hills be removed, but my Kindness shall
not depart from thee, neither the Covenant of my Peace be removed, says the
Lord, that has Mercy upon thee: Isa. 54.10.



Application.
I. THis may then really teach us to bless and praise God, for the Lord Christ
the Messenger of the Covenant, or blessed Ambassador of Peace between God and
us; it was the Father that chose and sent him on this Errand and Message.

II. With what due and great Reverence ought we to receive the Lord Jesus, he
being the Son of, and represents the Magnificent King not only of this World,
but also of Heaven? as in the Scripture-Parable, Surely, says he, they will
reverence my Son.

III. Accept of the terms of Peace offered to you by Jesus Christ, and
stubbornly stand out no longer; it is your Wisdom to submit and yield speedily
thereunto, for fear lest it should be said to you, as once to Jerusalem, etc.
If thou, even thou, had known in this thy day, Luke 19.42.
the things that belong to thy Peace; but now they are hid from thine Eyes; now
it is too late.

1. Consider, That the Breach and Enmity that is between God and Man, was
occasioned by our Sin, Some Motives.
we first brake League and Friendship with him.

2. Consider, how unable a Man is to stand and hold out in a War against God:
Who ever hardened himself against him and prospered? Job 9.4.
Who can stand before his Indignation? etc. Who knows the Power of thine Anger?
Psalm. 90.11


3. Consider, What a black foul and guilty Soul art thou! dare thou strive
with thy Maker, and join in a Confederacy and comply with his Enemy?

4. Consider how willing God is to be at Peace with you, though the offended
Party, he first seeks for Peace and Reconciliation!

5. Consider how long this blessed Messenger of the Covenant has waited on
you, and how often by his Ministers he has invited and sent to you!

6. Consider what gracious Promises he has made to pardon and forgive all
bypast Treasons, if you will come in, and accept of his good and peaceable
Terms?

7. Consider what great and irresistible Power there is in his Hands (are not
the Bowels of his Compassion very tender) to ease himself of his Enemies? Isa.
55.9.


8. Consider what a sweet thing is it to be at Peace with God, Isa. 1.24.
it passes all Understanding!

9. Consider now is the day of your Visitation, 2 Cor. 6.2.
this great Work admits of no delay, now is the day of your Salvation: O how
sad will it be when Christ shall say, you having not accepted the free tender
of Salvation, the things that concern your Peace, are now hid from your Eyes!

10. Consider Jesus Christ condescended very low, you may have Peace on very
easy Terms, (viz.) Hear, and your Souls shall live; (i. e.) hear faithfully and
savingly, Isa. 55.3, 4.
etc. and I will make an everlasting Covenant with you, etc.

But by way of Objection, some may say, What must we do to have Peace with God?

Answ. 1. You must fight no more against God, neither must you join with those
that in any wise take up Arms against God, nor resist his Word, his Spirit, nor
cast a deaf Ear to the Reproofs of Conscience.

2. You must not only break your League with Satan, but must also fight against
him and rebuke him, and so, that you may have no more Commerce with him, but
must always desire Divine Assistance to resist his Temptations: though he
pretends Love to you in offering worldly Profits, Pleasures, and Honors, yet
his grand Design is to damn your Souls.

3. Do not any longer hold a Confederacy with Sin, no not so much as a secret
Friendship with your Delilah, your choice and pleasant Sin, but put all thy
Sins (as it were) to the Sword; Mortify the Deeds of the Body, etc. If you
would have Peace, you must deal with your Sins, as the Israelites were to deal
with the cursed Caananites.

4. Possitively. Confess all your former Rebellions, Unbelief,
Earthly-mindedness, Pride, Passion, Lying, Drunkenness, yea, all Sins, and
forsake them.

5. Take hold of Christ, receive the Atonement he has made for thee.

6. Enter into Covenant immediately, seal it now, defer it not on pain of Death.

7. Join thy self to the Lord's Vovenant People with speed, delay not, etc.
Jer. 50.45.


Application.
1. From whence we may infer, That those that reject Christ, the great
Ambassador of Peace, are undone to all Eternity.

2. Let those, that through Grace are in a reconciled state and condition,
ascribe all to Christ; Omnis Adoratio, and Laus tribuenda Christo.

Christ a Witness.
Rev. 1.5. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful Witness.

1 Timothy 6.13. Who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good Confession, etc.

John 18.37. For this cause came I into the World, that I should bear Witness
to the Truth.

Rev. 3.14. These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness the
Beginning of the Creation of God.


THe Greek Word, (...), signifies a Witness or Martyr. Beza upon Acts 22.20.
says, Hic ego Graecum vocabulum servare malui, etc. i. e. Here I have chosen
rather to keep the Greek Word, ( viz. where Stephen is called a Martyr) than to
translate it a Witness; for common Use has so prevailed, that they are
peculiarly called Martyrs, who not only by Confession of Mouth, but also by
their Blood, testify the Doctrine of Christ. See Piscator upon the Place. The
Greek word signifies any Witness, yet in all Tongues, except Greek, a Martyr is
a loser of his Life for the Gospel; and often in Greek too in Ecclesiastical
Writers.

Christ in a spiritual sense is called a Witness; Isa. 43.10. and 55.4. Rev.
1.5. and 3.14. (1.) Because he is the most assured Testimony to us of Divine
Truth, John 18.37. (2.) Because he has exactly fulfilled all that was foretold
of him in the Old Testament, Joh. 1.17. And (3.) because he was martyred upon
the Cross for us, to complete our Redemption, and confirm the Gospel.

As Witnesses amongst Men are absolutely necessary to the keeping up of
Justice, and deciding all matters of moment between Man and Man: Even so
Almighty God, intending to deal with Men according to this Rule, has in Wisdom
thought fit to provide Himself with a Witness for the keeping up of Justice,
and deciding of all matters between Himself and Mankind; and according to his
own rich and admired Grace, he has provided a Witness, who is free from all
exception, both in respect of his Faithfulness and Knowledge of things, and
that is Jesus Christ himself, who is set forth to be the true and faithful
Witness, the beginning of the Creation of God, who in point of Antiquity is
very capable to set forth and attest whatsoever is necessary to be known of
God, and in whatsoever a faithful and true Witness (in point of usefulness) can
be unto Men, that and much more is Jesus Christ between God and Mankind. For
the illustration whereof take these following Considerations.

Metaphor.
WItness imports something done that is to be attested when it shall be
required.

II. A Witness has respect to a future Judgment, where a Difference may come
upon trial between two Parties.

III. A Witness is, or ought to be a person of Knowledge, who is necessarily
qualified for the Work.

IV. A Witness is usually called to give Testimony, and that in matters of
which he has very good knowledge.

V. A Witness gives in a Testimony, and leaves the matter on Record that he is
called to bear witness unto.

VI. A good and credible Witness makes a Cause valid to which he gives
Testimony.

VII. A Witness is so necessary in all matters of moment, especially that which
relates to Judgment, and to the determination of things, that they are seldom
done without one.

VIII. A Witness is to speak the whole Truth, when no less will serve to clear
the Case.

IX. A good Witness is a just and impartial Man, that abhors Lying.

X. A good and credible Witness ends Controversies upon Trial the right way;
and leaves those that are cast without Excuse or Relief.

Parallel.
THere was something done between the Father and the Son in respect of Man
before the World began, which God thought Christ a fit Person to bear Witness
unto. 1. That God had a purpose of good will to Man, and in pursuit of which
made a gracious Covenant in behalf of Man. 2. That God promised Happiness to
Man (through that gracious Covenant) whom he saw fallen. And this Jesus Christ
has born Witness unto, in hopes of Eternal Life, that God (who cannot lie)
promised before the World began. This Covenant, Promise, Tit. 1.2.
and all other gracious Acts of the Father that attend them, as they are
brought to light by Christ in the Gospel, he is a Witness of, together with the
Being and Perfections of God, the necessity of Faith and Holiness, and Belief
of the Resurrection of the Dead, and of Eternal Judgment, and the World to come.

II. The Witness of Christ has a full and clear respect to a future Judgment
where a Difference is to be tried between God and Man. He that rejects me,
and receives not my Word, I judge him not: Joh. 12.48
the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.

III. Jesus Christ is a Person of the greatest Knowledge in Divine Things,
being always with the Father, and in his Bosom; spoke on Earth what he saw and
heard in Heaven. He had the Word of God immediately from his own mouth, which
no others had besides himself, and therefore qualified to be a Witness in the
highest degree; as it is said, Him that God has sent speaks the words of God.
Joh. 14.10. Joh. 3.4.
I speak not of my self, but my Father that dwells in me he does the works.

IV. Jesus was not only called to be a Priest, as Aaron, but also to be a
Witness; God called him from his high and exalted Glory in Heaven, to go forth
as his great Witness to the World, to testify what he knows of the Father's
Will from Eternity. Hence, said he, I came not of my self, but my Father sent
me: and for this cause came I into the World, that I might bear witness of the
Truth. Joh. 18.


V. Jesus Christ has given in a full Testimony, and born Record of all things
depending between God and Mankind; He has testified, that God loved the World,
and sent him to be a Savior; and that there is forgiveness of Sin, and eternal
Life through his Name; and that God will condemn all those that believe not: He
that believes, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believes not,
Mark 16.16.
shall be damned.

VI. Jesus Christ however accounted a false Witness and Deceiver by the Jews,
yet has by his excellent Doctrine, his holy Life, and stupendous Miracles,
given such a Testimony to the World of God's Grace, and Good Will in making a
Covenant, of his Faithfulness in performing and making good the same, of the
reality of his Intentions, to make Men happy through believing, that he renders
the matter on God's side valid against all Contenders whatsoever, so as that
God shall be clear in Judgment, Joh. 5.10.
and none be able to answer him one word of a thousand.

VII. Jesus the faithful and true Witness, was so necessary to the
determination of matters relating to God and man, that it could not be done
without him, otherwise another might have served in his room; but none in
Heaven nor Earth was found worthy to open the Book, and loose the ^^eals
thereof, Rev. 5.4. If I had not come and done what no other did, you had not
had Sin, but now you have no cloak for your Sin; John 15.22, 24.

VIII. Christ, as the chief Witness, has spoke the whole Truth, left nothing
concealed that either concerns God's Glory, or Men's Good, either by himself
before he went to Heaven, or by his Apostles since; Rev. 22.19. Acts 20.27.
he has declared the whole Counsel of God, so that the Record of his Testimony
is able to make us perfect and complete in the whole Will of God; and if any
add to, or take from his Word, he shall lose his part in the Book of Life and
heavenly Jerusalem.

IX. Jesus is so just, and impartial a Witness; yea, and so great an Abhorrer
of Falsehood, that he is called the Truth it self, Joh. 14.6 J^^h. 1.17.
yea, Grace and Truth came by him; He was holy, harmless, separate from Sinners.

X. As the Testimony of Jesus will put an end to all Controversies the right
way, and leave the Wicked wholly wi^^hout Excuse, and clear the Justice of God:
So it shall be more tolerable for the Land of Sodom, in the day of Judgment,
than for that City, Romans 2.15, 1^^. M^^t. ^^.15.
that refuse and reject the Word and Testimony of Christ in the Gospel. Divine
Justice however will be cleared in the eyes or view of Men, and Angels, in
condemning them that had the Light, and would not be determined by it. See
Christ a Prophet.



Metaphor.
I. THe greatest Witnesses amongst Men, are but of a short standing, they are
but of yesterday; know but in part, therefore can testify but in part.

II. Earthly Witnesses are but Servants, and in many things return the Matter
of their Testimony by Information.

Disparity.
I. BUt Jesus Christ is an Ancient Witness of long standing, was with the
F^^ther from the Beginning, Joh. 1.1, 2.
saw and ^^eard all things that he spoke and did: I was by him, as one brought
up with him, etc. Before Abraham was I am.

II. Jesus Christ is the Son of the great King and Law-gi^^er, Prove. 8.24.
and has the whole matter of Testimony by Sight and personal Knowledge: The
Father has showed the Son all things that hims^^lf does, etc. Joh. 5.20. Joh.
8.38.
And what he has seen and heard that he testifyeth: Joh. 3.32.



Inferences.
I. THese things show the great value God puts upon the Souls of Men, that
rather than they should miss the Knowledge of his Will, and perish for want of
Testimony to confirm the Truth, he sent Jesus Christ his own Son to witness and
testify Divine Things to them: God who at sundry times, and in diverse manners,
spoke in time past unto our Fathers by the Prophets, Heb. 1.1.
has in these last days spoken unto us by his Son.

II. That the Gospel is to be highly valued as the perfect Will of God
witnessed to, not only by him that was true and faithful, but perfect and f^^ee
from the least stain or spot of Sin.

III. They deserve to be damned that live under the repeated Testimony of
Christ the true Witness, and yet will not believe it, so as to be reformed by
it. How shall we escpae, if we negl^^ct so great Salvation? Heb. 2.2, 3.


IV. What Confirmation, Establishment, and Consolation also, is here to all
that belie^^e and embrace the Gospel in Sincerity? 1. This is the Truth, as it
is in Jesus* The true Grace of God wherein ye stand. 2. There is a high degeee
of Blessedness to them that have not seen and yet believed. 1 Pet 5.12 Joh. 20
29 Romans 8.16, 17.
3. The abiding by this Testimony and Witness of Jesus Christ gives an Interest
^^, and Right unto Eternal Life. 4. It advances the great Honor, makes Men no
less than the Children of God, and Joynt-Heirs with Christ.

V. An Exhortation to all them that have received the VVitness and Testimony of
Jesus Christ, to hold it fast against all Opposition whatsoever. There is great
danger in being ashamed of, and relinquishing the Word, and Testimony of the
Son of God: He will be ashamed of them before God, Luk 9.26.
and the Holy Angels.

VI. To them that have not received his Testimony, to receive it with all
speed, because it is the word of Life, the very Doctrine of Salvation. It a
fearful thing to refuse him that speaks from Heaven, Heb. 12 25.
and trample under foot the Blood of the Son of God.

Christ an Altar.
Heb. 13.10. We have an Altar, whereof they have no right to eat who serve the
Tabernacle.


THE Greek word (...), properly signifies an Altar, where the slain Sacrifices
were offered; and sometimes, as Brightman says on Rev. 16.7. The Altar of
Incense or Perfumes. -- It is derived of (...), which signifies a Sacrifice or
Offering. In this Text it Metaphorically denotes the whole Mystery of Christ
the Mediator, and is put by a Synecdoche for the Oblation or Sacrifice, ( viz.
Christ.) See 1 Cor. 9.13. and 10.18. The meaning is, that such as still stick
to the Ceremonies of the Law by serving the Legal Tabernacle, and thereby seek
their Justification, cannot eat of this Spiritual Altar; that is, they cannot
be Partakers of the Benefits of this Sacrifice purchased by the Death of Christ.

Metaphor.
I. THe Altar of Perfume was appointed by the Lord, to be made of Shittim Wood,
overlaid with Gold, having a Crown of Gold about it.

II. The Altar of Burnt-Offerings was ordaind for Sacrifices, to atone for
Sin; the Flesh of Beasts was offered thereon.

III. All Sacrifices were to be offered upon the Altar of Burnt-Offerings; and
all Incense to be burnt upon the Altar of Incense.

IV. The Altar of Burnt-Offerings was but one, and in one place; and the
Sacrifice to be offered thereon, in this place only.

V. The Altar did sanctify the Sacrifices which were laid upon it.

VI. The Altar was a place of Refuge, 1 Kings ^^.50. 1 Kings 2.14.
Men that were in danger, fled to the Horns of the Altar, and there entreated
for Favor.

VII. The Horns of the Altar were to be sprinkled with Blood, and so was the
Altar of Incense once a year. E^^od. 29.12. and 30.10.


VIII. The Altar had four Horns on the four Corners thereof. E^^od. 27.2


Parallel.
I. CHRIST's Humane Nature was covered and over-laid (as it were) with the
Divinity, and crowned with Majesty, as the Gold adorned the Wood, and circled
the Altar.

II. Christ was appointed for Sacrifice, his Humane Nature was offered up as a
Propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World. Heb. 9.14.
1 John 2.2, 3.


III. All our Duties are to be performed and done through Christ's Name, and
all our Prayers, which are our Spiritual Incense are to be made through his
Mediation; Col. 3.17.
Rev. 8.4.
all must be done which God has appointed, upon his own Altar, or 'twill be
abhorred.

IV. The Saints spiritual Altar Jesus, Christ, is but one, who only once, and
in one place offered up a sufficient Sacrifice for Sin. Heb. 9.26. Heb. 13.12


V. The Lord Jesus our spiritual Altar, does sanctify all our Duties and
Prayers, Rev. 8.3, 4, 5.
which are in themselves impure.

VI. Jesus Christ is a Believers only Refuge; it is through him, and by flying
to him, God comes to be entreated, and is kind, and merciful unto us.

VII. Christ was not only sprinkled with his own Blood, but we may thereby
learn, that all our Prayers and Duties are not only accepted through his
Intercession, but also by the Means of his shedding, and sprinkling of his
Blood.

VIII. These four Horns signified the Power and Glory of Christ's Priesthood,
for the Salvation of his Elect from the four Corners of the Earth. Ainsw.




Type.
I. THe Altar and Sacrifice, the Altar and Incense, were two things.

II. Other Altars only sanctified the Gift ceremonianlly or figuratively, and
could not otherways.

III. Other Altars were to stand but for a time, it is a Sin now to erect such
Altars; because the Antitype or Substance of them is come.

IV. Other Altars were made of corruptible Matter, viz. Shittim Wood.

Disparity.
I. CHRIST alone is both the Sacrifice and Sacrificer.

II. Christ sanctifies all the Prayers and Duties of the Godly, really by
reason of that intrinsecal Worth, Virtue, and Excellency there is in him and in
his Death, etc.

III. Christ our Altar and High Priest abides for ever. Thou art a Priest for
ever after the order of Melchisedec: Heb. 5.6.

IV. Christ is incoruptible; that was of a perishing Nature, but this Altar
perishes not.



Inferences.
I. THis reproves those that erect Altars in their Churches, as the Papists,
and others do: Saints own no Altar but Christ.

II. We may infer from hence, that those that serve at the Jewish Tabernacles,
have no Right to eat of this Altar, for they thereby deny him to be their Altar.

III. This shows the Gospel Church and Worship, is far more glorious than the
Legal Church and Worship was.

Christ Heir of all things.
Heb. 1.2. Whom he has appointed Heir of all things.


THe term Heir, (in Greek (...), from (...), Sors, or a Lot, and (...) Lex, the
Law) is one that inherits an Estate, Lot, or Portion by Law; and therefore God
the Father being the Sovereign Owner and Proprietor of all things, devolves the
Inheritance upon his only begotten Son Jesus Christ. And so though he is really
and properly an Heir, yet the Term is by a Metaphor borrowed from worldly
Heirs. This word (...), is appropriated by Custom to the ^^lergy, or
Eccl^^siastical Persons; but it really signifies God's Lot or Inheritance,
(...) is all ^^he Faithful, and therefore, 1 Pet. 5.3. should not be translated
God's Clergy, but God's Inheritance, Weemes Divin. Exercit. The most probable
Derivation of the wo^^d (...), is from the Hebrew (...) Goral, which by a
Transposition of Letters, and the letter Gimel changed into the Greek Kappa,
will be (...) Coral, which is of near Affinity in sound and signification to
the Greek (...), whence as was said, comes (...) an Heir. Now the universal
Body of Believers is the Inheritance, or Clergy (if we must so call it) of God,
Isa. 19.25. which Universal Church is distributed into particular Churches, as
it were by Lots or Parts, neither ^^s the Term any where in Scripture
pecul^^arly attributed to the Pastors of the Churches; as Laurentius and
Gerhard, upon 1 Pet. 5.2. demonstrate.

Metaphor.
I. AN Heir is the Firstborn usually, though it holds not universally so; for
all Right to Estates, Kingdoms and Possessions are not Hereditary.

II. An Heir is the Head of a Family, the chief and Supreme of all his Father's
House.

III. Sometimes a Person is made Heir, and has both Title and Possession by
virtue of a Grant and Surrender made by another that is allied, or bears good
will to him.

IV. An Heir is the Support and Stay of a Family, all depend and rely upon him,
the whole Estate and Inheritance being his.

V. An Heir is Lord of all, he has Headship, Dominion and Power over all
whatsoever he is the Heir of, whether Persons or Things, one or more Kingdoms.
See Gal. 4.1.

VI. An Heir distributes Portions to others, he enricheth all his younger
Brethren and Sisters, and gives Gifts (if a kingly and mighty Heir) to all his
Friends and Favorites.

VII. A Princely Heir, or one that is an Heir to a Crown and Kingdom, is
proclaimed, and his Right asserted.

VIII. An Heir at a certain time comes to the Inheritance, or takes actual
Possession of that which he is Heir of.

Parallel.
I. CHRIST the Heir of all Things, is the Fathers Firstborn. I will make him,
my Firstborn* higher than (or high above) the Kings of the Earth: Psalm. 89.27.

II. Christ is the Head of the heavenly Family. He has put all things under
his Feet. And gave him to be Head over all things to the Church: Ephesians. 1.21, 22.

III. Christ, as he has absolute Right, or, is Heir of all things: As he is
the Firstborn among many Brethren, he has also a delegated Right, he has his
Title and Possession by Grant from the Father; hence it is said: Heb. 1.2.
He is appointed Heir of all things. God the Father, in the pursuit of the
Sovereign Purpose of his Will, has granted unto the Son* as Incarnate, and
Mediator of the New Covenant, according to the eternal Counsel between them
both, a Sovereign Right or Heirship, the Possession of an absolute Proprietor
to dispose of all things at his pleasure.

IV. Christ is the only Support and Bearer-up of the whole Church, by whom the
whole Family in Heaven and Earth are named, so all the Faithful depend and rely
upon him for all things; Col. 2.3. Joh. 1.14, 16.
In whom are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge: It pleased the
Father that in him all Fullness should dwell.

V. Christ, who is the true and undoubted Heir, is Lord of all: Mat. 28.18, 19,
20.
That in all things he might have the Pre-eminence. All Power in Heaven and
Earth is given to me; the Father has subjected all things unto him. 1 Cor.
15.27.
And it is reasonable that Christ should have this Sovereign Power and Headship;
since all things were made by him and for him, it was meet he should be Lord of
all. Besides, this made good the Promise, Rev. 4.1^^.
made to Abraham, which was that his Seed should be Heir of the World.
Moreover, hereby is the grant of that Request of Christ to the Father; He shall
have the whole World for his Inheritance, the ends of the Earth for his
Possession; Psalm. 2.8*
He is both King of Saints, and King of Nations.

1. He is Lord over Angels, he is Head of Principalities and Powers, Thrones
and Dominions; He has Power and Authority over the good Angels, these are part
of his Inheritance. Let all the Angels of God worship him.

2. He has Pre-eminence and Dominion over the evil Angels, they fly before
him, He has spoiled Principalities and Powers, etc. Col. 2.15.

3. He is the Head, and has Pre-eminence over Men, He is Lord both of the Dead
and Living; all the Elect are given to him, they are his in manifold respects,
Children, Servants, Brethren, Disciples, Subjects, Spouse, etc. Romans 14.9.


4. The Power and Headship of Christ, as Heir of all things, extends to all
Mankind universally, all owe him Homage, and shall submit and bend their Knees
to Him. Phil. 2.10* 11.
He has an absolute, unlimited, and Universal Power; may pull down and set up
at his pleasure, kill and make alive, all mighty Monarchs are but Tenants at
Will to him.

5. He has Power and Headship in an especial manner over all things to the
Church. Frist, Judaical or Old Testament things. Secondly, Christian or
New Testament things; Christ being Heir and Lord of all things whatever; the
Sovereign Disposer of all those Rites and Ordinances of Worship, about which
the Jews contended, must needs be in his Hand, to change and alter them as he
saw good. Dr. Owen on Heb. 7.^^
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath; and as he is Head over all things, He
has Right and Sovereignty to make, ordain, or appoint Laws, Ordinances and
Institutions; and to prescribe Rules how and after what manner God is to be
worshipped, belongs only to Christ the Heir of all things, and Head of the
Church.

VI. Christ distributes in a glorious manner to others, he gives large Portions
to the Saints, whom he is not ashamed to call Brethren: Mat. 12.5^^
He that does the Will of my Father, the same is my Brother, Sister and Mother:
Regenerating quickening, sanctifying, assisting, comforting and sealing Grace is
bestowed and freely given to Believers, with Pardon, Peace, Sonship and eternal
Life; yea, all things are given that appertain to Life and Godliness, to such
that are Heirs and Joynt-Heirs with him; when he ascended on high, he gave
Gifts unto Men. Ephesians. 4.8.

VII. Christ the Heir of all things, when he first came into the World, was
proclaimed by the Angels of God, as the rightful Heir of the Crown and Scepter
of both Worlds; He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest,
Luk 1.32* 33.
and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his Father David: And he
shall reign over the House of Jacob for ever and ever, and of his Kingdom there
shall be no end. His Right was often asserted by himself; as Mat. 28. Joh.
13.3. and by others, his Apostles, etc.

VIII. There was a set time agreed upon, when Christ as Mediator should come to
his Inheritance, who is appointed Heir, etc. (...), may denote either those
special Acts, whereby he came into the full Possession of his Heirship, or it
may be extended to other Preparatory Acts, that long preceded them, especially
if we should take it to be of the same Importance with (...) in the second
Aorist. In the former sense, it denotes the glorious Investiture of Christ in
the full Possession of his Kingdom after his Resurrection, with the
Manifestation of it in his Ascension, and token of its stability in his sitting
down at the Right Hand of God. By all these God made him, placed Him with
solemn Investiture, Heir of all. The Grant was made to him upon his
Resurrection, Mat. 28.18. and then fully declared to others. The Solemnization
of it was in his Ascension, all was sealed and ratified when he took Possession
of the Throne, by all which he was made and declared to be Lord and Christ, the
true Heir of all things. Acts 2.36. cap. 4.11. cap. 5.30, 31.
And such weight does the Scripture lay upon the glorious Investiture of Christ
in his Inheritance, that it speaks of his whole Power, as then first granted
unto him, Romans 14.9. Phil. 2.7, 8, 9, 10. and the reason of it is, because he
had then actually performed that Work and Duty; upon consideration whereof that
Power and Authority were eternally designed and originally granted unto him.
God's actual committing all Power over all Things and Persons in Heaven and
Earth to be executed and managed for the ends of his Mediation, declaring this
Act, Grant and Delegation, by his Resurrection, Ascension, and sitting at his
Right Hand, is that which this Word denotes,: Notwithstanding the time of the
visible Possession of his Right is not yet come, he will take unto him his
great Power, that is, the visible Exercise and Execution of it, and Reign. Will thou at this time restore the Kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them, Rev.
11.1^^ Dr. Owen.
It is not for you to know the Times and Seasons, which the Father has in his
own Power.



Metaphor.
I. AN Heir many times is one that succeeds in the Possession of the Right and
Goods of one deceased; and till then cannot possess the Inheritance.

II. An Heir is many times disinherited of his Right, cut off, excluded, and
utterly deprived of his Crown and Kingdom by an usurped Power.

III. An Heir among Men, has comparatively but small Possessions.

Disparity.
I. CHrist enjoyes all, as he is Heir of all things, with the Father, who dies
not, but is like the Son, immortal, eternal, not subject to any Change. The Son
being Heir, does not eclipse nor diminish the Glory of the Father.

II. Christ shall not, cannot be disinherited. Tho wicked Men take Counsel
together to obstruct and hinder his visible Exaltation, yet all is in vain, He
that sits in Heaven shall laugh; The Lord shall have them in Derision, Psalm.
2.2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
and will set his King upon his holy Hill of Zion. I will make my First born
higher than the Kings of the Earth.

III. Christ (you hear) is Heir of all things; He is Head and Chief Lord over
Angels and Men, over all Ranks and Degrees of Men, Emperors, Kings, and all
the Nobles of the Earth, over all Persons Civil and Ecclesiastical, over Devils
and all the Powers of Darkness. He is Heir of the World to come, the new Heaven
and Earth, and of all the Glory of it, as of the Earth, or the Kingdoms of this
World.



Inferences.
I. FRom hence we may perceive how exceedingly God has honored the Lord Jesus
Christ as Mediator. He has a Name above every Name in this World, or that
which is to come. Phil. 2.15.


II. Moreover, it is evident from hence, Christ is very Rich. Who would not
marry such an Heir, or choose the Lord Jesus for their Husband? The Riches of
his Kingdom, the good things of his House, the Revenues of his Dominion are
infinite and inexhaustible, and he is very gracious and bountiful in his
Communication of them unto all that take hold of him.

III. It Is easy to conclude from hence, that those that intend to be Partakers
of any good in Heaven or Earth, in a way of Right in a way of Love and Mercy,
must get an Interest in Christ, and abide in continual Obedience to the Gospel.

IV. In vain are all the Endeavors of wicked Men in keeping him from the
Possession of his Right: He will soon dash them in pieces, and tread them under
his Feet, who oppose his coming to the Throne, Psalm. 2.9.
and the taking full Possession of his Inheritance.

V. Let us have our Eyes continually up unto him, and pray that he would make
haste to lay claim to his Right, and take unto him his great Power, and reign.
Let us cry, Thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven, etc.

Christ the only Foundation.
Isa. 28.16. Behold, I lay in Zion for a Foundation a Stone, a tried Stone, a
precious Cornerstone, a sure Foundation, etc.

1 Cor. 3.11. For other Foundation can no Man lay than that which is laid,
which is Jesus Christ.


THis Term Foundation is Relative, it relates to a House; the Metaphor is taken
from Architects. The Church of God is compared to a House or Building, and
Jesus Christ to the Foundation thereof: the Greek (...), from (...), to put or
place, metaphorically denotes the chief, head, or principal thing, without
which, what depends upon it cannot subsist, no more than a Structure without a
Foundation. Metaphora a Fundamentis aedificiorum sumpta, quae firma and immota
esse opportet. Victorin. Shigel. in Nov. Test.

METAPHOR.
I. A Foundation, of a House or Building is the Contrivance of a wise and
skilful Architect, or chief Master Builder.

II. A Foundation as to the Form, Manner and Dimension of it, is agreed upon,
and laid out by the chief Master Builder.

III. A Foundation is the first part of a Building; it is laid before the
Superstructure can be raised; it is the bottom of the whole Fabric*

IV. A Foundation of a stately Structure is laid deep, and much of it is out of
sight, and hard to find the Bottom of it.

V. A Foundation of a House must be laid of suitable Matter, or that which is
sure and safe to build a Superstructure upon; hence the Foundation is usually
laid with Stone, if a stately House, because durable.

VI. A Foundation of a stately Structure or Building is laid with tried Stones,
such Stones that the Builder knows the Nature and Temper of, and not only so,
but to be sure he oft-times proves them himself with the Hammer, and sets his
Servants to prove and try them likewise.

VII. A Foundation is a necessary part of a Building; there can be no House
built without a Foundation. And it is very dangerous to build upon a false and
rotten Foundation, witness the overthrow of the House built upon the Sand. Mat.
7.27.


VIII. When the Foundation-stone or Bottom of the Building is laid, there are
many Stones added and joined to it, and all the whole Structure is united and
fitted to the Foundation.

IX. The Foundation is the strongest part of the House; it is that which bears
up and supports the whole Fabric.

X. There is Proportion between the Foundation and Superstructure; you may judge
of the House for Matter and Form by the Foundation thereof.

XI. As the Foundation bears the weight of the whole Fabric and Structure;
so also the whole Furniture, and all which does adorn it, is born by it.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus, the Spiritual Foundation, is the glorious Contrivance of
the eternal God, who is the wise, and chief Master Builder of Heaven and Earth.
Heb. 3.4.


II. The Father having chosen Christ, God-man, for this glorious Design, laid
him for a Foundation, in his eternal Decree; and brought him forth and
manifested him to the World, for all Men that would be saved to build upon,
Behold I lay in Zion for a Foundation, a Stone, etc. Isa. 28.16.


II. Jesus Christ is first proposed to Sinners by the Father, as the Pillar or
Foundation of Grace and Salvation. If he had not been found out as a Foundation
for the Saints and Church of God to be built upon, how could the House of God
have been raised? hence Christ was by Decree and Promise very early laid; Genesis
3.15*
The Seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents Head. The Lord Jesus Christ is
laid as the Bottom of our Justification, the Bottom of our Pardon, Peace, and
Salvation.

IV. Christ the Spiritual Foundation was laid in the deep and hidden Counsels
of the glorious Trinity. Who is able to find out the Bottoms and see the depths
of that eternal Purpose and Decree of God, being so mysteriously laid for a
Foundation!

V. The Lord Jesus Christ is suitable and fit for a Foundation, he is called a
Rock; to build upon a Rock, is safe; Mat. 16.18. 1 Co. 10* 4. Isa. 28.16.
and he is called a Stone, I lay in Zion for a Foundation, a Stone. The Father
saw that the Lord Jesus would be every way fit and meet to erect that glorious
Building, and heavenly Structure of the Church and our everlasting Salvation
upon.

VI. Christ is a tried Stone, therefore called a sure Foundation. Isa. 28.16.
God the Father will adventure to build his Church upon Christ, and venture him
with his Covenant as Mediator and Surety of it, and all with him, he is a
chosen and select Stone, picked out from amongst Men and Angels; and no^^ only
so, but also a tried Stone, he has been in the Furnace of his Father's Wrath,
and under God's Hammer, and under great Temptation from Men and Satan; he was
tried to the utmost, and found by the Saints in all Ages a safe and sure
Foundation, he never failed any that built their Hope and Salvation upon him.

VII. Christ the Foundation must be laid, or down will the Building go;
Salvation is to be had no other way; if Men do not build and rely only upon
him, their Foundation will deceive them, they will fall into Hell. Let their
Structure seem never so famous; they refusing this sure Rock, build upon the
Sands, and their House will fall, Mat. 7.27. 1 Cor. 3.11. Joh. 8.22.
for another Foundation can no Man lay. If ye believe not that I am he, ye
shall dye in your Sins.

VIII. Upon Christ the Foundation are all Believers, as well hewed and squared
Stones, laid to build up the spiritual House, to whom coming as to a living
Stone, disallowed indeed of Men, 1 Pet. 2.4, 5, 6, 7.
but chosen of God and precious, ye also as lively Stones are built up a
Spiritual House, etc. All the whole Superstructure being fitly framed, is
united and joined to Christ the Foundation by Faith and Obedience. Ephesians. 2.20,
21, 22.


IX. The Lord Jesus Christ is the whole Strength and only Support of the
Church; all Saints rely and depend on him for Grace, Righteousness,
Justification, 1 Co. 1.30
Pardon of Sin, Safety, Isa 45 24. Ephesians. 6 10. Joh. 15.7.
Direction and eternal Life. In the Lord shall one say* I have Strength; be
strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might; without me ye can do nothing.

X. There is a Suitableness and Proportion between Christ and the Church; as
the Foundation is Holy, Divine and Spiritual, excellent in Nature and Form; so
is the House or Temple of God.

XI. The Lord Jesus Christ does not only bear the weight of the whole Church,
but also all that appertain to it, all the Pillars, Braces, under-props and
supports, viz. the Prophets, Apostles, Ministers, etc. that are called Pillars
in the House of God. He bears up the Covenant, the Covenant stands firm in him;
I have, says God, made a Covenant with my Chosen: He is the Mediator and
Surety of it; Psalm. 89.3.
all the Precepts of God are built upon him. He is the Foundation of every
Ordinance, Appointment and Institution of the Gospel. What ever any Man
preaches or practices for Doctrine or Discipline, that has not its Rise,
Ground, and footing from Christ the Foundation, it ought to be cast away and
utterly rejected and abominated as altogether unfit for Gods Building. All the
Promises are built upon him. To Abraham and his Seed, were the Promises made,
not to Seeds, as if many, but to thy Seed, G^^l. 3.16.
which is Christ, all the Promises are in him yea, and in him Amen, etc.

Union and Reconciliation with God are founded on Christ, it is he who has made
Peace by the Blood of the Cross. Ephesians. 2, 13, 14, 15, 16. Romans 5.10
When we were Enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
Justification, Sanctification, Righteousness and Redemption, Vocation, all are
built upon him, they all have their Rise and Foundation from Christ. Moreover,
Pardon of Sin, and Peace of Conscience, are from him; Woman, thy Sins are
forgiven thee, go in Peace! My Peace I give unto you. 2 Cor. 1.20 2 Cor. 5.18,
19.
All Duties of Religion are built upon Christ, it is he that has commanded
every thing that is to be done by us, whether it respects the first or second
Table; all is to be done in Christ's Name by his Authority, and in his
Strength, and by the help of his Spirit, and to his Praise and Glory, Faith,
Love, Hope, yea every Grace; and all Gifts of the Holy Ghost which adorn the
Soul and House of God are from Christ, they are purchased by him, and do flow
from him to us by the Spirit. Again, the Ministry is from him, Romans 5.10, 11.
he is the great Subject of Gospel-Ministration, We preach Christ crucified,
etc. The Efficacy of all is from him, he gives the Increase. Lastly, Eternal
Life is built upon him; Col. 1.20, 21.
This is the Record that God has given to us Eternal Life, and this Life is in
his Son; He that has the Son, has Life, and he that has not the Son, has
not Life. 1 John 5.11, 12.



METAPHOR.
I. OTher Foundations are laid with many Stones joined and cemented together.

II. Other Foundations are laid of senseless breathless Stone or Brick; things
that are natural, things that are terrestrial congealed into a massy lump, or
artificially made and prepared.

III. Other Foundations many times decay, and by that means the whole Building
is in danger, and tumbles down.

IV. Other Foundations are laid by some Man; for as Man builds the House, so he
it is that first lays the Foundation thereof.

V. Other Foundations are laid of Stones of little Value and Worth
comparatively; the Foundation of a House is not laid with precious Stones, as
Jasper, Saphyr, Beril, Jacinth, Amythist, Diamond, etc.

VI. A Foundation is often removed, fault being found with it, and another laid
in the room of it; a Man may remove a Foundation which he has laid at his
pleasure, or may lay more Foundations than one.

VII. Other Foundations may be shaken, an Earthquake may remove them out of
their place.

VIII. Other Foundation cannot preserve the House that is built upon it, that
may be totally demolished and destroyed, and yet the Foundation may remain.

Disparity.
I. THis Foundation is but one whole entire Stone, which adds to the Strength
and Firmness of it, Behold, I lay in Zion for a Foundation, a Stone, Isa. 28.16.
not Stones; nothing besides Christ, nothing of our own, must be built upon as
a Foundation for Salvation.

II. Christ is a living, lively, and active Spirit, hence called a living
Stone, disallowed indeed of Men; 1 Pet. 2.4, 5.
he created the Stones and Dust of the Earth; as God, he has his Being of
himself and from everlasting, not made nor created.

III. Christ being a living Stone, in whom is Spirit and Life, does not, cannot
decay; and by this means the Church of God, and every particular. Soul that is
built upon him, stands sure; he transforms the Building into his own nature,
and so keeps and preserves it from Rottenness and all manner of Decays
whatsoever. Living things do not rot nor putrify, as other things do. And as
the Body by Joints and Bands from the Head has Nourishment ministered and knit
together, grows and increases in Strength and Beauty; Col. 2.19.
so is it with the glorious Body, the Church and Soul of a true Believer, that
is joined to Christ this blessed Head and living Foundation; Because I live, ye
shall live also. Joh. 14.19.


IV. Christ is laid as a Foundation for us, and in our Souls, by the Father;
it is God's Act and not our own; Behold, I lay in Zion, etc. Who can lay Christ
for a Foundation but God? He was first laid by God in his Decree, and then he
laid him by the Prophets and Apostles. And lastly, by the Spirit also, is he
laid in the Hearts of Believers. Christ is infinite. How can a finite Hand or
Power move an infinite Being or Thing? God first removes or razes by his Spirit
all other Foundations; he takes of Man's hopes off Heaven, by his own Works,
Legal Conviction, Tears, Humiliations, Vows, Covenants, Resolutions, etc. and
in the place and room of all, lays Christ crucified, as the ground of Hope and
Happiness. -- Hence is all Boasting excluded, and Salvation wholly of Grace.
See Mr. Tillinghust, Christ the only Foundation. Romans 3.2


V. Christ the Spiritual Foundation is a precious Stone, to whom coming as to a
living Stone, disallowed indeed of Men, 1 Pet. 2.6.
but chosen of God and precious; Christ is not a common Stone, but a choice
rich Stone, a Stone of inestimable Value, and Price; Behold, Isa 28.16.
I lay in Zion for a Foundation a Stone, elect and precious. This sets forth
the Excellency of a Foundation, and not only so, but it adds a Luster and Glory
to the House which is built upon it. The Foundation of New Jerusalem is said to
be laid with all manner of precious Stones; and then you read of the Excellency
of the Superstructure, the Building of the Wall was Jasper, Rev. 21.18
and the City was of pure Gold: O how glorious must that City needs be, that
has such a Foundation as Christ is! and not only so, but how durable also are
some precious Stone: The Diamond is the hardest Stone, it cuts Glass, there is
nothing, as Naturalists say, can break it; Jesus Christ makes Impression on the
hard hearts of Men by his Graces; O then how safe must it of necessity be for
us to build upon this Foundation!

VI. Christ is the only Foundation: as he is every way fit and meet to be laid
in the bottom of the Building, so he is without Fault; 1 Cor. 3.11*
And no other Foundation can be laid, than that which is laid, which is Christ
Jesus. But though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Gospel to you
than what we have preached unto you, let him be accursed: Gal. 1.8.

VII. Christ is a Foundation that can never be shaken, the greatest
Revolutions, Mutations, Changings, Turnings and Over-turnings that can come,
cannot over-turn this Foundation, nor remove it out of its place. Foundations
of Kingdoms, Heb. 12.28.
Nations, Commonwealths and Constitutions of Antichristian Churches, may, and
shall be shaken; but Christ the Foundation of the true Church shall abide for
ever.

VIII. Christ the Spiritual Foundation is able to uphold and preserve the
H^^use or Soul that is built upon him; I know whom I have believed and am
persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him. 2 Timothy
1.12.
Upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail
against it: Mat. 16.18.



Inferences.
I. THis informs us of the great Wisdom and Condescension of God, in contriving
such a blessed Foundation for the Church and all true Believers to build upon;
it was the purpose of God to found his Temple upon a sure Basis, even the Rock
Christ Jesus.

II. It also sets forth the happy and glorious State of the House of God; what
can add greater Glory to it, than to have a Foundation so precious, lasting,
and permanent!

III. It shows the Honor and Excellency of Gospel-Ministration; Ministers do
not only propound Christ, but in a subordinate sense, in the Ministry of the
Word may be said to lay Christ as a Foundation; Hence Paul says, I have laid
the Foundation, etc. for we are Laborers together with God: 1 Cor. 3.9, 10.

IV. It reproves those that lay aside and reject this Foundation, and build
upon others; as,

1. The Papists, that build upon Peter, and on their own Merits; and what their
Merits are, England and other Nations can soon resolve.

2. The Quakers, who build upon the Light of Natural Conscience; they refuse
the Person of Christ, and the valuable Price of his Blood, and introduce in his
room an inward Quality, viz. that Beam of Light that shines in Men from Jesus
Christ, Joh. 1.9.
considered as Creator.

3. Such as build but in part on Christ, come justly under the verge of this
use of Reprehension, because they do not lay all the stress and hope of their
Salvation upon this Foundation.

V. It serves also to put Men and Women upon Trial, to see whether the Lord
Christ be their only Foundation or not.

1. Do you really remove your selves off all other Foundations?

2. Do you not build on, nor confide in Pharisaical Righteousness, even a
Righteousness of your own. Mat. 5 20.


3. Do you not build upon Federal Holiness, and upon Birth-Privileges; think
not to say within your selves, Mat. 3.9.
We have Abraham to our Father.

4. Do you not build upon Legal Conviction, or outward Reformation.

5. Do you not build upon a bare believing the History of the Gospel, upon the
Faith of Credence.

6. Do you not build upon a Confession of Sin?

7. Do you not build upon outward Privileges, upon visible Church Membership,
and External Ordinances; Mat. 25.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
remember the Foolish Virgins.

8. Do you not build barely on the Mercy of God, not well considering he is
just as well as gracious, Exodus 34.6, 7.
and will not acquit the guilty, notwithstanding your Repentance and moral
Righteousness, without the Atonement made by the Blood of Christ.

9. Do you not build upon present Purposes and Resolutions to change your ways
and course of Life hereafter: is not this that which supports and stays your
Minds?

10. Do you not build upon Learning, Parts, and that Knowledge you have in
Divine Things above others. See Mr. Tillingh.


11. Do you not build upon Men, Ministers, the Church; taking all upon Trust
that such and such Doctors and able Divines say.

VI. This may caution all Preachers of the Gospel, to take heed how, and what
they build. Upon this Foundation if they build Wood, Hay, or Stubble they will
suffer Loss. Let them be very careful they preach nothing for Doctrine but what
Christ has given in Commission, and receive none, lay none into the Building
but living Stones, such as are well hewed and squared, and fitted by the Spirit
and Word for the Spiritual Building: for God's Temple must be built with Gold,
Silver, and precious Stones.

VII. Let all such that are not built upon this sure Foundation, be exhorted
with all speed to get an Interest in this Rock: for otherwise your Building
will be on the Sand, and you will fall into the lowest Hell at last.

VIII. It demonstrates the happy State of those that are built upon this sure
Foundation, the Prophets and Apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
Cornerstone, in whom all the Building, Col 2.9. Ephesians. 2.21, 22.
etc. And let all those that speak the Truth grow up in Love unto him in all
things, who is the Head Labor, to be well fixed, cemented and united to this
Foundation, that you may be established in the Faith.

IX. And lastly, This may comfort the Godly in the worst of Times; for as it is
a Foundation of God's laying, and of so excellent a nature in its self, you may
be sure it is not in the Power of Men nor Devils to raze or destroy it; be sure
you shall be saved, whoever you are, that build in a right manner on the Rock
of Ages, the Lord Jesus Christ.

Christ the Cornerstone.
1 Pet. 2.6. I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone, elect and precious.

Psalm. 118.22. The Stone which the Builders refused, the same is become the
Head of the Corner.


CHRIST by a Metaphor (called Anthropopatheia) is not only called a Stone, but
also (by a very emphatical Phrase) a Cornerstone, (...) Mat. 21.42. Acts 4.11.
1 Pet. 2.6. And whereas Builders place the strongest and most durable Stone in
the Corner-Foundation, it denotes the firmness, strength, and duration of
Christ the Foundation, or Spiritual Stone, upon which the whole Church is
built. It is said, (...). 3.17. The Lord will smite the corner of the Head (so
the Hebrew) of the Daughter of Zion. The exterior Angle of an Edifice has a
Prospect to each side, and is put for Principality, or the chief Ruler, Judge.
20.2. 1 Samuel 14.38. Isa. 19.13. hence it is attributed to Christ, Psalm. 118.22.
expounded Ephesians. 2.15, 16, 17, 20. he having the chief oversight of, as well as
he is the principal Foundation to his Church.

METAPHOR.
I. A Cornerstone sustains, and upholds the building; if the Corner of the
House fall, the whole Structure is in danger. There came a Wind from the
Wilderness, and smote the four Corners of the House, Job 1.19.
and it fell upon the young Men, and they are dead. Some Stones may drop out of
the middle of the Building, and yet it may stand; but if the Corner or
Foundation gives way, down it falls.

II. Corner-Stones are the Medium, by which the Walls of the House are united
in one Building. Pull out the Corner-Stones and the two sides of the House are
separated the one from the other.

III. The Cornerstone is for Direction in a Building, an Under-workman is to
take Rule from hence. All other Stones must be laid level and even with that,
not further out nor in. So that being fitly placed, they know how to proceed
from thence.

IV. The Cornerstone preserves the House; hence a Builder lays strong and firm
Stones in the Corner; for Experience shows, that most of the dangerous rubs and
hurts a House is exposed to, usually falls upon the Corner of it, and that
keeps off hurt and wrong, that otherwise the rest of the Building would sustain.

V. As the Corner-Stones are the strongest for bearing and preserving, so the
fairest Stones for Beauty and Ornament. If the Corner-Stones be graceful, rich,
and curiously wrought, the whole Building is the more comely. Much Art and Cost
is bestowed on the Corner-Stones, they are better and more rich usually than
any others.

Parallel.
I. CHRIST may be compared to a Cornerstone in respect of Sustentation; He is
the Sustainer and Upholder of the Church, the great Pillar that bears up his
Elect. The Churches Safety, Peace, Grace, Comfort and Salvation is upheld by
him: Eliakim was a Type of Christ in this. He shall be fastened as a Nail in a
sure place. And be shall be for a glorious Throne to his Father's House, and
they shall hang upon him all the Glory of his Father's House, Isa. 22.21, 22,
23, 24.
the Offspring and the issue, all Vessels of small quantity, from Vessels of
Cups, to Vessels of Flagons. All Believers from small to great, are born up by,
and hang upon Jesus Christ.

II. Jesus Christ that entire and glorious Cornerstone, unites Jews and
Gentiles together; He has made both one. He made them but one entire House and
spiritual Building; Ephesians. 2.14, 15.
He cements all Believers together in one Body; He makes them one, in Mutual
Love and Affection; makes them all Partakers of the same Grace, Privileges and
Salvation.

III. Jesus Christ is a Believer's Direction, He is our Rule by which we must
proceed in all spiritual Things; that which is not done by Christ's Command or
Example, or by plain Rule and Direction from him, must be all undone and pulled
down again; all must run parallel with the Line of Christ's Doctrine or
Example: Learn of me. Mat. 11.28
And in another place, says He, I have given you an Example that ye should do
as I have done to you. Joh. 13.15. Having left us an Example that we should
follow his Steps: 1 Pet. 2.21.

IV. Christ preserves the Church of God; He receives all the rubs of Enemies in
his own Person, which had they met with us, would soon have broken us to
pieces, and defaced our Souls. It Is he who by his Strength keeps those great
Dangers from us that we continually are exposed to from Satan, Sin, and wicked
Men, and the Wrath of God. All our Strength and Help is in him: what a great
Mercy is it, that God the great Builder has chosen such a sure Stone for the
Corner? Thou shall preserve me from Trouble, O Lord, from the Hands of the
Wicked preserve me, from the violent Man, who has purposed to overthrow my
Goings. Psalm. 32.7. Psalm. 140.4


V. Christ is the beauty of all God's Building; as he bears up and preserves,
so he beautifies likewise the Church, and all Believers. There would be no
Comeliness in the House of God, all would be but as a deformed heap, were it
not for this Cornerstone. What is the Glory and Beauty of the Saints to Jesus
Christ? He is fairer than the Children of Men. Psalm. 45.2.
We have no Comeliness but what he puts upon us. Ezekiel. 16.14.
God has spared no Cost to place such a rare and choice Stone in the Corner.
Christ is a Stone curiously wrought, if I may so say, richly adorned with the
Divine Nature, full of Grace and Truth: Joh. 1.14.



METAPHOR.
I. OTher Corner-Stones of all material Buildings are inanimate, senseless, and
lifeless things.

II. Corner-Stones of a material House, are fashioned and laid by Men.

III. Other Stones may drop, or be drove out of the Building, or be greatly
marred, defaced and spoiled.

IV. Corner-Stones in a material House, as they strengthen the Building; so
they also receive Strength from the Building, and are some security to the
Corner.

V. Other Buildings must have many Stones for one Corner, cemented and joined
together to complete and finish the Superstructure, and those Stones that are
laid for one Corner, will not serve for every Corner of the same House.

VI. It Is rare to see a material Building to have Corners laid with precious
Stones, as Jasper, Onix, Diamond, etc.

VII. An House tho its Corners should be laid with precious Stones, and Pearl,
and all the Structure suitable, and so thereby may be more glorious and durable
than Corner-stones of other Buildings, yet may it moulder away, be defaced,
lose its Beauty, and perish.

VIII. Other precious Stones are of a small dimension, and of small weight; you
may put many of them, the largest that were ever seen, in a small Vessel or
Cabinet.

IX. Another precious Stone may have many excellent Properties in it; but no
one has all Virtues, Excellencies, Forms, and Colors in it.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ is a living Stone, he has Life in himself, and communicates
Life unto the whole Building; and from hence, Believers are called Lively
Stones. 1 Pet. 2.5.


II. Christ is both fashioned, polished and laid in the Spiritual Building by
God himself; Behold, I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone: 1 Pet. 2.6.

III. Christ is a Stone that cannot be loosed nor disjoined, nor drove out of
God's House, by all the skill of Men or Devils; nor can be marred, spoiled, or
any ways hurt.

IV. Christ the Spiritual Cornerstone, receives no Strength from any Stone or
part of the Building; what need has he of Help from any of his Saints? What
can weak Believers add of Support to him?

V. Christ the Cornerstone is but one whole entire Stone, yet every corner of
God's House has the same Stone; and tho the Building be raised never so high,
yet he fully supplyeth each Corner from the bottom to the top, and there needs
no other Corner-Stones besides himself.

VI. Christ the Cornerstone of the Spiritual Building, is a Precious Stone:
Behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone, 1 Pet. 2.6.
elect and precious; no Jasper, Onix, Diamond, or Sapphire is to be compared to
Him. He is of infinite Worth and Value, ot only so in the Opinion and Esteem of
others, but really so in himself; hence called the Pearl of great Price. Mat.
13, 4^^


1. He is precious in himself, being God coequal and coeternal with the
Father; The express Image of his Person; Heb. 1.3.

2. He is so, it appears, in that he is the choice Diamond, the Delight and
Jewel of his Father's Heart, his only begotten Son, who lay in his Bosom.

3. He is most precious, in that he is preferred so much above Angels, and in
his being able to undertake the Work of our Redemption, which none in Heaven or
Earth had Worth enough in them to do. Nothing less than this choice and
valuable Jewel or precious Stone would be received, as a sufficient Price to
satisfy the Justice of God, or make full Compensation for Sin, the Breach of
God's holy Law.

4. He is most precious in respect of his Qualifications; He has the fullness
of the Godhead in him. It pleased the Father that in him, all Fullness should
dwell: Joh. 1.14, 16. Heb. 1.9.
hence said to be full of Grace and Truth. God, even thy God has anointed thee
with the Oil of Gladness above thy Fellows. He has not, say Divines, the
Fullness of Parts, but the Fullness of Degrees: There may be some Addition made
to that Fullness that is in Believers; but there can be no Addition made to his.
There is in Christ, not only enough, the Fullness of Sufficiency, but also the
Fullness of Redundancy. Angels may have no want, but in Christ is an Overplus to
redound to others. He has enough to fill thousands, and millions of thousands.
Of his Fullness we have all received, and Grace for Grace.

5. Christ is precious in the esteem of the holy Angels, the Angelical Host, to
honor and show their high esteem and awful respects to him, at his Birth sang
with a loud voice, Glory to God in the Highest. They adore and worship him
continually. All the Godly accounted, and will for ever account of Him as the
most precious and inestimable Jewel in Heaven or Earth. The Saints in Heaven
for ever proclaim his glorious Worth and Praise; they cry, Power, Riches,
Wisdom, Strength, Honor, Rev. 5.11, 12. Phil. 3.8, 9, 10. Cant. 5.10
Glory and Blessing to the Lamb for ever and ever. To all the Saints on Earth
he is precious. Paul accounted all things as dung, that he might win Christ;
The Spouse cries out, He is white and ruddy, the chiefest amongst ten thousand.
Believers have parted with all things in this World freely for his sake; Nay,
in love to him, and to show how they did adore and honor him, have been made
Sacrifices in dreadful Flames, rather than they would undervalue or deny his
holy Name. Christ is precious, very precious, most precious, always precious,
altogether precious; Precious in his Nature, precious in his Name, that is as
precious Ointment poured forth; precious in all his Offices; his Spirit, Grace,
Word, Ordinances and Promises are precious. Can Believers value him enough, who
is their Life, Life External, Life Internal, and Life Eternal? Christ is their
Light, he is their Mediator, Surety, Friend, Food, Clothing, Ornaments,
Portion, etc. in a word, He is All in All to them.

VII. Christ being a precious Stone, never loses his Strength or Beauty, as he
cannot be defaced by Men nor Devils; Eternity it self cannot dissolve this
Stone, nor diminish its brightness. Christ is durable: Heaven and Earth shall
fade away, and wax old, like a Garment, but Jesus Christ is still the same, and
his years fail not, he is the same yesterday, to day, Heb. 13.8.
and for ever.

VIII. Christ Jesus, the spiritual precious Stone, is exceeding great: As God,
he is of infinite dimension, filling Heaven and Earth with his Presence. He is
large enough for the whole Foundation, and every Corner; this one entire Stone
serves for all.

IX. All manner of Perfections, Virtues, choice and admirable Excellencies,
meet together in the Lord Jesus; his Brightness is far above the Brightness of
Diamonds, his Whiteness excells the Whiteness of Pearls; and there is no
medicinal Virtue or Quality in any precious Stone, but in a spiritual way is
far more transcendent in him. He cures the Sight, strengthens and cures the
Heart, makes fruitful, resists Poison, etc.



See the Metaphors, Pearl of great price, and Foundation.

Inferences.
I. FRom hence we may infer, That the Church of God is a very rich and glorious
Building, as 'twas foretold it should be: O thou afflicted, tossed with
Tempests, Isa. 54.11, 12.
and not comforted; behold, I will lay thy Stones with fair Colors, and thy
Foundation with Sapphire.

II. Ascribe all the Beauty and Glory of the Church, and of the Saints, to the
Lord Jesus.

III. Bless God for this choice and precious Stone of the Corner. The more
excellent Christ is, the more it should draw out and enlarge our Hearts to
bless and praise God for him.

IV. For Trial. Is Christ precious to you? I shall lay down a few Rules,
whereby you may try your selves.

1. Do thou own Christ to be very God? He cannot be valued nor esteemed by
any, as he is in himself, till they thus account of him, and believe in him.

2. Do thou honor, adore, and obey Him, as thou do honor, adore, and obey
the Father? All Men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. Joh.
5.23.


3. Is there nothing here below, which thou valuest and prizest above Christ?
An Hypocrite has always something that lies in his Bosom, which he esteems and
prizes more than Christ: Their Hearts go after their Covetousness. Ezekiel. 33.31.
The young Man went away sorrowful, Mat. 19.22
because the World was uppermost in his Affection. If Christ be truly precious
to any, he is superlatively precious to them.

4. If God should bid thee ask what thou will, as he did Solomon, what would
thou request of him? Would it be (think thou) this precious Stone, this
Christ, this Pearl of great price, to have a Right to him, to be like him, to
enjoy him, to be with him for ever?

5. Is Christ much in your Thoughts? Where your Treasure is, there your Hearts
will be also. Mat. 6.21.


6. Have thou denied thy self of all things, or art thou ready so to do, and to
follow Him? For whom I have suffered the Loss of all things, and do account
them but Dung, that I may win Christ. Phil. 3.8.9, 10.


7. Can thou not be satisfied with any thing thou do enjoy without him?
Can thou say, with one in another Case, Yet all this avails me nothing, so
long as I see not, or have not a clear Evidence of my Interest in Jesus Christ.

8. Do thou build wholly upon Him? Is He All to thee? Do thou see him all
in Pacification? 'Twas he that appeased the Wrath of the Father, satisfied both
Law and Justice. He is All in Justification: Who is the Lord, our
Righteousness. He is All in Election, the first and chief of his Father's
Choice, the way of it: He has chosen us in him. Ephesians. 1.4. and 5.11.
Is He All to thee for Acceptance: Who has made us accepted in the Beloved.
He is All in Conversion? It Is he that shows us the Necessity of it, that does
quicken and beget us by his Word and Spirit; it is he that forms a new Spirit in
us. Is he All to thee about Pardon of Sin? He purchased Pardon. It Is by his own
Blood, viz. that Atonement which he has made, we come to have our Sins
forgiven; it is he that gives us a Heart to ask it, and a Hand to receive it. Is
Christ All to thee in respect of every Grace? He gives Faith; it is he that is
the Author and Finisher of it; it is he that sheds Love abroad in our Hearts,
Romans 3.5.
by the Holy Ghost. All Grace is treasured up in him all Grace is communicated
to us through him. Is he all to thee in the Ministry of the Word? it is Christ
that is preached, it is he that gives Grace to preach, and opens the Ear to hear
the Word preached, and helps the Soul to receive the Word. Is Christ all to
thee in Ordinances? The Lord's Supper holds forth his Death, his Body broken,
and his Blood shed. He is the sum and substance of it. Baptism shows his
Burial, and his Resurrection. In Ordinances or Duties, art thou not satisfied
unless thou meetest with Christ Jesus?

9. Art thou willing to accept of Christ as the Father offers him? Art thou
willing to have him to be thy Prince, as well as thy Savior? to destroy thy
Sin, as well as to save thy Soul?

10. Do thou long to be like him? art thou willing and desirous to be holy,
as to be happy? to live to him here, as well as to live with him hereafter? Is
every thing in Christ, or that belongs to Christ, precious to thee?

V. Reproof; This reprehends those that lay aside, and would build without this
precious Cornerstone. Who they are, see Metaphor, Christ the Foundation.

VI. Labor to esteem and highly value Jesus Christ. What are all things
without him? If he is not precious to thee, nay thy All, all thy profit by him
at last will be nothing at all; what will thou do at Death?

Qu. Some may say, What shall we do to get Christ, to obtain him who is so
precious?

1. Let thy Sins go. 2. Let all thy Righteousness go in point of dependence, do
not trust to that. 3. Let all Consultations with Flesh and Blood go, and close
immediately with Christ. 4. Improve the Means of Grace God is pleased to afford
thee, attend upon the Ministry of the Word. Lastly, Here is comfort to all true
Believers; you that have Christ, have all; and let me tell you, you can never
have less than all, for this precious Stone can never be taken away from you,
you having made the blessed Choice, that one thing needful, with Mary.

Christ the Wonderful, Counselor.
Isa. 9.6. And his Name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, etc.


Counselor, is a word of a double Signification, respecting two ranks of Men.
(1.) Such as appertain to the high Courts of Princes, called Counselors of
State. (2.) Such as appertain to the high Courts of Judicature, who are called
Counselors at Law. These two Ranks of Men have their proper Work and Business
peculiarly appropriated to them, etc. The first of these Ranks of Men are in
Council with the King, to make and establish Laws; therefore called Elders, or
Senators, etc. 2. The proper Work and Business of the second Rank or Order of
Men is to unfold and plead Law; therefore called Barresters or Counselors,
etc. Many things belonging to each Station, do very fairly agree to the Son of
God, who therefore is not unfitly called Wonderful, Counselor, etc. Wonderful*
Luke 2.47.
because the greatest and wisest that ever was. Counselor, because his Place,
Work, and Circumstances agree thereto, as appears in these following
Considerations.

Counselor.
I. SOme Counselors are of a noble Extraction, well descended, which gives
them Advantage above others. Such have a double Advantage. 1. In respect of
Honor. 2. In respect of Education. Men basely or meanly born and descended,
are seldom or never advanced to the Honor of Counselors in the highest
Courts, especially of Parliaments.

II. A Counselor is brought up to useful Learning for so great an Employ or
Office; Men who are illiterate being unfit for it.

III. A Counselor is a Man of Worth, otherwise unfit for that Function, or to
appertain to any Court.

IV. A Counselor of State is, or ought to be a Man of an high and heroic
Spirit, not concerned about Triffles and things of an inferior Nature, but
mostly taken up with the more weighty and more considerable matters of the Law.

V. A Counselor of State, is chosen to that high Sphere and Dignity; he comes
not in of himself, but by choice.

VI. A Counselor of State is admitted into the Kings Court; takes his place at
the Council Table, and his chief Business lies there.

VII. A great and wise Counselor of State, is made acquainted with the most
secret Purposes of the King himself, without whose Counsel and Consent there is
nothing acted, nor brought to light.

VIII. A Counselor of State is one, who is thought worthy to be the Kings
Familiar, and Companion.

IX. A Counselor of State, is one of the highest Ranks of Men, none above him
but the King himself.

X. A Counselor of State is concerned in the agitating of Great Affairs, such
as immediately concern the King, and the good of all his Subjects; as the
issuing out of Proclamations, and the approving of other Ministers to be
employed in the King's Business.

XI. A wise, worthy and good Counselor of State, tho he be a Subject and
Favorite to the King, yet he is a great Glory to a Kingdom, and it is the more
respected for his sake.

I. A Counselor at Law is a public Officer belonging to a Court of Judicature.

II. A Counselor at Law gives Advice and Council, from whence he derives the
Denomination of being called a Counselor.

III. A Counselor at Law makes known the Law to those that are ignorant or
unlearned; he being the Mouth (as it were) of the Law.

IV. A Counselor at Law resolves doubtful Cases, which other Men cannot.

V. Counselors at Law make Conveyances of Estates; and most Men think these
Conveyances not sufficient, unless made by such able Men as they.

VI. Counselors at Law have great respect amongst Men, especially those who
do most need them, and make use of them.

VII. A Counselor at Law puts an end to Controversies, by Non-suiting, or
Overthrowing the Party which is on the Adversaries side.

VIII. A Counselor at Law makes Contracts in great and weighty Cases between
Parties.

IX. A Counselor at Law discovers Flaws in Evidences, to undeceive the
over-credulous.

X. A Counselor at Law is of general use to Men, since their tempers have been
corrupted, their manners vitiated, and a necessity of multiplying Laws to
correct them, etc.

XI. A Counselor at Law is a Pleader of Causes, which is none of the least
part of his work.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus is of an high and sublime Extraction, well descended
according to the Flesh, of the Blood Royal, of the Lineage and Stock of David
the King of Israel: and in respect of his Divini^^y, the eternal Son of God,
Possessor of Heaven and Earth; He is Lord of the Angels, and King of Saints and
Nations; and also King of all the Kings of the Earth; Ephesians. 4.6. 1 Cor. 15.47.
Joh. 1.14.
be that comes from above, is above all. The second Man is the Lord from
Heaven; the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth; having the
advantage of the greatest Honor, and highest Education being by the Father,
brought up with him, and daily his Delight.

II. Jesus Christ is qualified and fitted every ways with heavenly Learning,
for the highest Undertaking of this kind whatsoever; having been with God, Joh.
1.1, 2.
and also is God, knows every thing, that is done in Heaven and Earth; knows
the tempers and manners of all People. He has Rules of Judgment above others,
he has received the Gift of Oratory from the greatest Master of Tongues and
Languages in the World. The Son does whatsoever he sees the Father do. The
Lord God has given him the Tongue of the Learned, etc. so that he can
understand without an Interpreter, Isa. 50.4.
and speak without humane Assistance.

III. Jesus Christ is a Man of worth, most fit to be Counselor in the high
Court, above, and that in these four following respects. 1. In respect his
great Wisdom. 2. The Knowledge of all Laws and Customs amongst Men. 3. Of his
long Standing and Experience. 4. As he is united to the Ancient of Days; who is
the Center of all Perfection.

IV. The Lord Jesus was a Man of a great and noble Spirit, not busied about low
and inferior things, of a mean Consideration; but about Matters of the most
weighty moment, to establish Principalities and Thrones in Heaven, to reform
Nations and Kingdoms, to reclaim the whole World, and bring Heaven and Earth
into an amicable Correspondence. That he might gather together in one, all
things in himself, whether they be things in Heaven, or things on Earth. Ephesians.
1.10.

V. Christ the great Counselor was elected, and chosen by God himself to act
in this high Sphere and Capacity, called The Man of his Right Hand. His Elect
in whom his Soul delights, Acts 2.34.
One chosen out of the People. Psalm. 89.19.


VI. Jesus Christ was admitted into the hight Court of Heaven, took his place
there at the Right Hand of the Majesty on high, in the presence and view of all
the Angels, and the seven Spirits that are before the Throne. He is entered into
Heaven, Ephesians. 1.20. Heb. 12.2. and 8.1.
and is set down at the Right Hand of God.

VII. Christ that great and wise Counselor, is made acquainted with the great
and wise Purposes of the great and wise King of Heaven and Earth; nothing is
hid from him as God: without him there was nothing created or done. No Man has
seen God at any time, Joh. 1.18.
save the only begotten that is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared
him. 1 Timothy 6.16.
He brought Life and Immortality to light through the Gospel.

VIII. The Lord Jesus is God's Familiar and Companion. Awake, O Sword, Zach.
13.7.
against my Shepherd, and the Man that is my Fellow. Who being in the form of
God, thought it no Robbery to be equal with God. Phil. 2.6.

IX. The Lord Christ is of the highest Rank, not of Men only, but is indeed
exalted above all his Fellows, whether Men or Angels; has no Superior (as
Mediator) but the Father. 1 Cor. 11.3. Col. 2.10. Joh. 5.28.
The Head of every Man is Christ. He is the Head of all Principalities and
Powers. The Father is greater than I. The Head of Christ is God.

X. Jesus Christ is concerned in the agitating of the greatest Affairs of
Heaven and Earth, such as immediately concern God himself, and the good of all
his People; the Proclamations and Tenders of Grace, Peace, and Pardon, come
through his Hands; He has the Approbation of all Ministers that are employed
in the Business of the great King, either in Matters Civil, Military, or
Ecclesiastical, viz. Kings, Princes, Rulers, Deputies, Judges, Generals of
Armies, Apostles, Bishops, Ambassadors, and the like. All suitors to God for
Favor, whether Ministers or People, for the Soul or the Body, their Petitions
come to the hands of Christ. By him we have access to the Father; of him all
receive, even Grace for Grace. Joh. 1.16. Romans 5.2.


XI. Christ is the Delight of the Father, and as a wise, worthy and good
Counselor, he is a Glory to Heaven it self, and Heaven is the more longed for,
for his sake. Psalm. 73.25
This is generally acknowledged by all that have the Knowledge of him, or
Interest in him.

So much may suffice concerning Christ, as compared to a Counselor of State; I
shall now speak concerning him under the other acceptance of the Word, viz.
Counselor at Law, etc.

I. The Lord Jesus Christ is a public Officer belonging to Heaven, the highest
Court of Judicature. I am not of this World; glorify me, with the same Glory,
Joh. 17.16. and v. 5.
that I was glorified before the World was, etc.

II. The Lord Jesus gives the best Advice and Council, and most worthily
deserves the title of a Counselor. I will bless the Lord who has given me
Council. Psalm. 16.7.
Go thy way, sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee. I counsel thee to
buy of me Gold tried in the Fire, Joh. 5.14.
and white Raiment that thou may be clothed, etc. Rev. 3.18.


III. Jesus Christ makes known the Law of God to those that are ignorant and
unlearned; he illustrates all the parts of it, and shows to what degree it
extends, etc. He also shows what are the Privileges of keeping it, and what
are the Damages of breaking it: Joh. 6.3, 7* etc. to the End. Joh. 14.15.
For if you forgive Men their Trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive
you, etc.

IV. Christ resolves doubtful Cases that other Men cannot, in that he says,
Son, be of good cheer; Daughter, be of good cheer, Mat. 9. from v. 1, to v. 9.
thy Sins are forgiven thee, etc.

V. The Lord Jesus makes over the heavenly Mansions to Men; and no Man can have
a good Title to this Heavenly Inheritance, unless Christ makes the Conveyance.
As the Father has Life in himself, so has he given the Son to have Life in
himself, Joh. 5.16.
and has power to give Eternal Life to as many as are given unto him.

VI. Jesus Christ has great respect amongst Men; the Turks own him for a great
Prophet, the Papists for the Son of God, but his own Disciples, that see an
Excellency in him, and an absolute necessity of him, make use of him, own him
to be their Savior. -- Yea and doubtless I count all things but loss, for the
Excellency of Jesus Christ my Lord, etc. Phil. 3.8. -- He is the Chiefest among
ten thousand. Cant. 5.10.

VII. The Lord Jesus puts an end to Controversies, by Non-suiting, or
Overthrowing the Devil and all other Adversaries of the Soul in their own Plea:
-- I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not. Luke 22.32 2 Cor. 12.9. Rev.
12.9. 1 John 3.8.
-- My Grace is sufficient for thee, etc. -- And the Dragon, and his Angels
were thrown out of Heaven, etc. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that
he might destroy the works of the Devil.

VIII. So Christ makes Contracts between the great God and his People, in that
weighty Case that concerns their Salvation; and mediates and seals the Covenant
between them; for which cause he is called, The Mediator of the New Covenant,
Heb. 12.24. See Mediator.

IX. Christ has discovered Flaws in Evidences, to undeceive those that have
been mistaken about their Right to the Heavenly Inheritance. Thou say, I am
rich, and increased in goods, and have need of nothing, and know not that
thou art wretched, and poor, and blind, and miserable, and naked. Rev. 3.17.
Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God. John 3.3.

X. So Christ is of general use to Men, since the nature of Mortals has been
so generally corrupted by the Fall, by which means there is a necessity of him
not only as a Priest to offer Sacrifice for us, but also as a Prophet or
Counselor, to expound the obligations to Holiness, and the spirituality of
the Laws of God to us; for want of which many go on in their Errors, till they
forfeit all Privileges, fall under the strokes and penalties of the Law, and
become miserable for ever through ignorance, unbelief, and disobedience.

XI. Jesus Christ is a Pleader of Causes, which is none of the least part of
his work: for which see Advocate opened.



There are many Disparities; Christ excels all other Counselors in many
respects. See Advocate.

Inferences.
1. SInners may learn from hence whither to go in all doubtful Cases for
Counsel, in all Cases relating to their spiritual condition.

2. If thou do not know the way to Heaven, go to Christ by Prayer, and take
the directions of his Word.

3. If thou do not know how matters stand between God and thy Soul, go to
Christ, read his Word, that will inform thee whether thy Condition be good or
b^^d: if any Sin is lodged in thee or be loved, and spared by thee, He tells
thee thou will miscary for ever.

4. If thou refusest to take his Counsel, but rather followest the Counsel of
thine own Heart, or the Counsel of wicked Relations, Neighbors or great Ones
of the Earth, who labor to draw thy Heart from God, and from following the
Counsel of Christ, thou art undone.

5. Take heed when thou know what Christ's Counsel is, thou do not reject
it like the Pharisees, who refused to be baptized with the Baptism of John.

6. Happy are all such who take the Counsel of Christ. Christ gives
Soul-Counsel, wise Counsel, right Counsel, early Counsel, needful Counsel,
chief Counsel, safe Counsel, Counsel that will enrich the Souls of Men, Counsel
that will make them good, great, and renowned, and happy for ever: say then
with David, Thou shall guide me by thy Counsel, and afterward receive me to
Glory. Psalm. 73.24.

The Compassion of Christ to Sinners under the Similitude of a Hen.
Mat. 23.37. How often would I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen
gathers her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not!


THE Lord Jesus shows by these words his great Compassion and Affection to the
Jews, who refused the offers of his Love and infinite Favor.

Three things are considerable in the Text.

1. Christ's Grace and good Intention to them, How often would I have gathered
thy Children together, etc.

2. The way or manner which he took in order to the accomplishing of his
gracious Design and Purpose touching them, -- as a Hen gathers her Chickens
under her Wings.

3. The Jews Obstinacy; Ye would not.

The Lord condescends very low in making this Simile of a Hen; the nature and
property of which Creature take as follows, so far as it will hold Parallel to
the Case in hand.

Simile.
I. NVllum enim Animal circa pullos suos tanta Compassione movetur, etc. Says
Bernard; There is no Creature that is moved with so much Compassion toward her
young ones, Bern. de pass. Dom. cap. 5.
as the Hen.

II. The Hen is observed to fly in the very face of such ravenous Birds as
strive to destroy her Chickens; she strives to save and defend them with all
her might, tho with the utmost hazard of her life.

III. Such is the Hens care of, and affection toward her Chickens, that she
for their sakes is made weak in all her members, and brought to extreme
faintness. Hoc genus animantis magnum affectum in filios habet, ita ut eorum
infirmitate affecta, etc. (says Austin) this Creature shows great affection
toward her young ones, that being affected with their weakness, she also is
made weak.

IV. The Hen clocks often, and with a mournful voice, as it were, calls her
Chickens to her, when she perceives they are in danger by the Kite, or any
other enemy, to be destroyed.

V. The Hen stands ready prepared to receive her Chickens under her Wings to
defend them against all Violence that may happen to them.

VI. The Hen is very desirous to gather all her Chickens together, and cover
them with her Wings; she would not have one of them wanting.

VII. The Hen gathers her Chickens to her; and that they may have Food as well
as Nourishment and Shelter, she looks about and scratches to get them Meat.

VIII. The Hen succors, refreshes and makes lively such Chickens that are weak
and hang down their Wings, and can scarce go; she soon recovers them when she
gets them under her Wings.

IX. The Hen, it is observed, if she finds any Crumbs, Corn, or any other good
thing, she gives it to her Chickens, though she wants it her self; she spares
out of her own Mouth, and puts it into theirs.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus was moved with the greatest Compassion imaginable toward
the poor Jews and Jerusalem, which he was first sent to, and came to seek and
to save. This is signified abundantly by that wonderful Passion, that seized
upon his Spirit, Mat. 23.3. Luke. 19.41, 42.
when he came near the City, and by his Expressions in the Text, etc. it is
said, he wept over it, etc. and cried out with a mournful Voice, O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem! etc.

II. The Lord Jesus Christ to save and defend the Offspring of Israel, and the
poor Sinners of the Gentiles, did not refuse to encounter with the greatest of
their Enemies: He resisted the Devil, who sought to make a prey of them, etc.
Mat. 4.6, 8
No Enemy that strove to devour us, but Christ endeavored to defend us from
him.

III. Christ, that he might save poor perishing Sinners, by taking Man's nature
upon him, was made weak in the same sense, as it is said he became poor: such
was the greatness of his Love and Affection toward us, that he bare our
sickness, and carried our sorrows. Isa. 53.4.
To what extremity of faintness was he brought, when he sweat as it were great
drops of Blood! Mat. 26.30. Luke 22.44.
and when the ponderous Cross was laid upon him, as they led him to Golgotha,
it is said, he fainted. He was touched with the feeling of our infirmities, Heb
4.15.
being made like to us in all things, sin only excepted.

IV. Christ calls to poor helpless and impenitent Sinners very often, with a
mournful Voice, and Tears in his Eyes, O that that had known, in this thy
day, the things thou belong to thy peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes!
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Luke 19.42.
Why, what is the matter? An Enemy is at hand, Ruin is at the door; Ezekiel. 18.31.
Why will you die, O House of Israel? Now it is to England, yea, to London; O
that they would once hear Christ's Calls before it is too late, and the things
that concern their peace be hid from their eyes! etc.

V. The Lord Jesus stands with his Arms and Heart open ready to receive all
true penitent Sinners, that come unto him; Isa. 65.2. Mat. 11.28, 29.
I have spread out my Hands all the day long, etc. Come unto me all ye that
labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest, etc.

VI. The Lord Jesus has such Bowels of Pity and Compassion to sinful Mankind,
1 Timothy 2.2, 3, 4.
that he would have none of them perish, But come to the Knowledge of the Truth,
and be saved; How desirous is he to get them all under his Wings of Grace and
Protection; Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die, O House of Israel? turn and live,
Ezekiel. 18.31, 32.
says the Lord, How often would I have gathered thy Children together! etc.

VII. The Lord Jesus calls to Sinners, that they may have the Bread of Life.
Isa. 55.1.
Ho, every every one that thirsts, come ye to the Waters, etc. Eat ye that
which is good; yea, the Bread that never perishes. Joh. 6.27.
Christ gives Bread that never perishes.

VIII. All sin-sick and diseased Souls that are weak and hang down their Heads,
or their Wings, and go drooping all the day (as it were) half dead, no sooner
are they got under the Wings of Christ, but he graciously succors and refreshes
them, making them brisk and very lively.

IX. Christ out of his infinite Bowels to his People, finding no other Meat was
so good and excellent for them, gave them Food from Heaven, even his own Body,
My Flesh is Meat indeed, etc. Joh. 6.55.




Simile.
I. THe Hen cannot save and defend her Chickens under her Wings, when she has
gathered them to her, being a poor, weak inconsiderable Creature.

II. The Hen when her Chickens are grown up, cares not for them; she will ('it is
noted) rather strike at them, and beat them from her.

III. The Hen loses oftentimes her Chickens; the Kite gets them away from her,
and makes a Prey of them.

IV. A Hen soon forgets her Chickens, which she has bred and brought up.

Disparity.
I. THe Lord Christ is strong and able to save, hide and defend all his People
that come to him, under his Wings, being the most High, Omnipotent, Eternal
Jehovah: The Father and I am one; He thought it no Robbery to be equal with
God. Phil. 2.6, 7*


II. Our Blessed Savior will never cease to take care of, and provide for his
poor Children; his Eye is as well upon the oldest and strongest Christians as
upon the weakest and youngest; Cast all your Care upon him for he cares for
you, etc.

III. The Lord Jesus Christ cannot, will not lose one of them that the Father
has given him, those, that thou have given me I have lost none, Joh. 17.12.
but the Son of Perdition, etc. I give them Eternal Life, and they shall never
perish, etc. Joh. 10.28.


IV. Christ never can, nor will forget his Saints. Can a Woman forget her
Sucking Child, Isa. 48.14, 15, 16.
that she should not have Compassion on the Son of her Womb? yea, she may, but
I will not forget thee.



Inferences.
I. WHat great Encouragement does this Similitude afford to all, yea to the
vilest of Sinners? O what Compassion is there in Christ's Heart toward you,
how willing is he to gather you to himself!

II. It also informs us of that great Blindness and horrid Obstinacy which is
in the hearts of wicked Men; How often would I have gathered Israel, and they
would not be gathered! I would, but ye would not! How dare Sinners then to
charge their eternal Overthrow, Perishing, and Ruin upon the Lord Jesus
Christ? Know, O Sinner, Hos. 13.9.
thy destruction is of thy self.

III. It also truly informs us, that all Safety and Salvation is in the Lord
Jesus Christ. Under his Wings we must get if we would be secure from the Enemy
of our Souls, and be delivered from eternal danger; Unto Him shall the
gathering of the People be.

IV. Of what amazing nature was the great Condescension of the Blessed JESUS,
Genesis 49.10.
who made himself of no Reputation! became weak, poor, and sensible of our
Infirmities (touching the Flesh,) that we might be strong, rich, and partake of
his Perfections, Phil. 2.7.
and Glorious Fullness.

V. Here is also very much Comfort to all true Believers, whoever they be, that
are gathered by the Word and Spirit unto Christ: He will succor, guide,
revive, and defend them for ever. He infinitely out-doth the Hen; his Bowels
exceed the Bowels of the tenderest Mother to her sucking Child. He is strong
enough also, as well as tender, not only willing but able. Fear not Satan, he
has swallowed up Death in Victory. The Kite has (as one observes) as it were
an aching tooth at the Chickens, fain would he make a prey of them: so would the
Devil of Believers. Christ knows how to preserve them, by gathering them all
under his Wings. Soul, fear not, if thou art under the Protection of the Lord
Jesus Christ, thou art in safety from all temporal and spiritual dangers.

VI. If Christ be so tender and compassionate unto Sinners, and seeks to gather
them unto him; who will pity them if they perish at last and are damned, when
all is from their own vile stubborn and wilful Obstinacy?

VII. If the Lord Jesus Christ be so tender of, and kind to his Saints which he
has gathered to himself, and sheltered under his Wings; Then let this Doctrine
teach Christians in an especial manner to be kind one to another, and tender
one of another, and to do their utmost endeavor to defend one another in this
evil day, from the common Enemy both of Body and Soul.

VIII. This may serve for seasonable Reproof to all those, who profess the Name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and hope for Preservation by him, and Shelter under
his Wings, yet (instead of endeavoring to the utmost to help one another,
revile, backbite and persecute one another) for small and circumstantial
Differences in Profession, and thereby give the common Enemy Advantage upon
them both; A divided House cannot stand. Mark 3.25.


Christ the Captain of our Salvation.
Heb. 2.10. To make the Captain of our Salvation perfect through Sufferings.


THis is a military Term, the Greek (...), a Captain, being derived from (...),
which signifies to lead; and (...) also a Captain, derived from (...), which
signifies Beginning, Chief, or Government, denoting in a borrowed sense from
Military Commanders, the Rule, Dominion and Principality of Christ over all,
and that he leads his Spirtual Militia safe through all Perils in their
Christian Warfare. Being to enter upon a Military Subject, and the chief of
that Rank, we shall consider Captain in a threefold respect.

In respect of his 1. Qualifications. 2. Place and Office. 3. Progress or
Actions*


METAPHOR.
I. A Captain is supposed to be a Man qualified for his Place, to which there
are these things necessary. 1. That he be free and willing to take that Work
and Office upon himself; it is not meet he should be forced to do it. 2. It
behooves him to be one faithful in all things to his Sovereign. 3. A Captain
must be valiant and courageous, not easily dismayed, tho he meet with never
such hard and difficult Service. 4. He ought also to be well skilled in the
Work and Duty of his Place and Office.

that Capacity.

III. A Captain has the Power of listing Soldiers under his Command, to serve
in the King's War.

IV. A Captain by virtue of his Place and Office does nominate his Officers,
and appoint them their proper Work, gives out his Orders, beyond which they are
not to venture.

V. A Captain has the keeping of Muster-Rolls, wherein all the Names of his
Underofficers and Soldiers are entered, by which he calls them over, and knows
them all by Name.

VI. A Captain leads his Soldiers out into the Field to be exercised and

their Duty, and shows them the dangers of Neglect and Remisness.

VIII. A Captain has Power to casheer, can take in or shut out, as he sees
Cause.

IX. A Captain is the Head of a Company, Commander over a Band of Men.

X. A Captain when he has taken his Place, marches in the Head of his Company,
runs the greatest Hazard, deserts not his Men for fear of Danger.

XI. A Captain gives the Word of Command to his Soldiers, which they are
carefully to learn and observe.

XII. A Captain by his Place is engaged to War, both offensive and defensive as
occasion shall require.

XIII. A Captain meets with Enemies to try his Skill and Courage.

XIV. A Captain makes use of Armor and Weapons, of which there is no small need
in the day of Battle.

XV. Captains are commonly stout Men, and will make good their Ground against
an Enemy, scorn to yield till they die.

XVI. A good Captain takes care for his Men to preserve and secure them,
whether he lives or dies himself.

XVII. A Captain has the power to prefer his Men to Office, that he approves
of to be fit and worthy.

XVIII. A wise Captain puts the best Men into the greatest Service; he makes
not young and unexperienced Men, Commanders of Companies, and Leaders of
Parties, lest the Work should miscarry in their hands.

XIX. A Captain in weighty Affairs is joined with the Council of War, without
whom there is nothing of grand Importance transacted.

XX. A Captain's place is a place of Honor, where the Subject is justly worthy
of it, and the Army legally raised.

XXI. A valiant and Noble-hearted Captain offers terms of peace to the Enemy,
before he falls upon them and fights them, to prevent effusion of Blood if
possible.

XXII. Captains when their Favor is refused, put Men to the Sword, and make
slaughtering work in the World.

XXIII. A Captain does not only come off a Conqueror, but improves his
Conquest and Victories to many degrees of Advantage. 1. To the discouragement
of Advarsaries. 2. In spoiling their Forts and Strength. 3. In the erecting
Trophies. 4. In disposing the Prey, to gratify, and reward his Soldiers that
engaged with him in the War.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ the Captain of our Salvation, had not only these four, but all
other honorable, and necessary Qualifications, that made him fit to be a
Leader. For, 1. Jesus Christ was free and ready, had no force put upon him, but
came voluntarily and of his own free will to undertake this Office, etc. he
looked round about, and saw that there was none to help or to undertake this
Work, then said he, Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God. 2. Jesus Christ was
faithful over his own House, called the faithful and true Witness, Isa. 63.5.
Heb. 10.7. Heb. 3.6.
he never so much as thought in the least, of betraying of his Trust. It was
impossible indeed he should be unfaithful, who was without Sin, the holy and
immacculate Lamb of God. 3. Christ was valiant and resolute, the danger of
Death, and Threats of an ill natured King, could not make him retreat, when he
had entered the Field, slighted his Enemies high Words and vain Florishes. Go,
tell that Fox that I work Miracles this day and to morrow, the third day I
shall be made perfect. Luke 13.32. The Contempts of his Enemies, nor Persuasion
of his Friends, could not at all abate his Valor, he knew he must, and resolved
he would be about his Father's Business. Luke 2.49. 4. Christ was fitted with
Wisdom and Understanding, he is called the Wisdom of God. 1 Cor. 1.24.


II. Christ was commissionated by God, after his qualifications did commend him
to this Place: for though he offered freely to accept, yet he acted not of
himself, but by Command and Authority from the Father. I came not of my self,
Joh. 8.42.
the Father sent me. I received Commandment from the Father.

III. Jesus Christ has the Power of listing Spiritual Soldiers under his
Command, to serve in the Wars of the Soul, and Battle of the Lord of Hosts. He
took the Names of Nathaniel, Zacheus, Cephas, Peter, James, and John, who
listed themselves under his Command; with many others we read of in the Gospel.

IV. Jesus Christ does appoint Saints their proper Work, and gives forth his
Orders, beyond which they are not to pass. He nominated the twelve Apostles to
be next to himself, and gave. Orders that they should not march beyond the
confines of Judea, but tarry at Jerusalem till fresh supply of Strength came
in. Go not to Samaria, nor the Cities of the Gentiles, Mat. 10.5. Luke 6.15.
Acts 1.3.
But tarry at Jerusalem till you are endued from on high. Add not to his Word,
etc.

V. Christ has a Book wherein the Names of his Saints and faithful Followers
are recorded, called in Scripture, the Lamb's Book, or Book of Life; Rev. 21.27
whose Names are in the Book of Life; the Book of Life of the Lamb, Rev. 20 ^^2.
slain from the Foundation of the World. Joh. 10.3.
He calls his own Sheep by Name, etc.

VI. Jesus Christ lead his Saints to the Sea side, to the Mountains, Mat. 5.1.
Mat. 13.1.
to the Desert, to exercise and make them fit for Service against the day of
Battle, by which he taught their Hands to war, as it were, and their Fingers to
fight against the Devil, the Flesh and the World.

VII. Christ made large Speeches to all his Followers (see his Sermon in the
Mount) to encourage them in the way of their Duty, and show them the great
dangers of Neglect and Remisness. Mat. 5.4, 5, 6.
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after Righteousness, etc. Blessed are
the meek, etc. But except your Righteousness shall exceed the Righteousness of
the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven. Mat. 5.20. Ye that have abode with me in my Temptations, I appoint unto
you a Kingdom, etc. With a multitude of such like Speeches which are contained
in the holy Gospel, which he uttered, to encourage and animate all his
Disciples in their Spiritual Warfare.

IX. Jesus Christ takes in and shuts out, as he sees Cause; he cashereed Judas,
Demas, Hymeneus, Philetas and Alexander, 1 Timothy 1.20.
and takes in Paul, Barnabas, and Apollo into his Company.

X. The Lord Jesus is the Head of all true Christians, and Commander of the
Church Militant in chief, all the Bands of the white Reigment march under his
Banner; H^^ is the Head of his Body the Church; Isa. 55.4. Ephesians. 1.21, 22.
Given to be a Leader and Commander to the People.

X. Christ when he was baptized by John, took his Place in the Minstry, as the
Leader of his Church, and ran the greatest Hazard, yet deserted not his
Followers for fear of Danger; He not only loved them to the end, Joh. 13.1.
but did bear them company, and abode with them to the last, even till he
suffered for their sakes, the bitter Death of the Cross, etc. Mat. 28.20
And is spiritally with them all ways to the end of the World.

XI. Christ gives the Word of Command to his Saints, which they are to observe.
If any Man will serve me, Joh. 12.26
let him follow me. Mat. 28.20
Teach them to observe all things that I command you.

XII. So is Christ by being the Captain of our Salvation for War, not
originally from his own natural Disposition, for he is for Peace; but by reason
of the resolved Opposition that is in the hearts of his Enemies against him. I
came not to send Peace on the Earth, but to bring a Sword. Mat. 10.34.

XIII. Jesus Christ met with Enemies, not only Flesh and Blood; yea, potent
Flesh and Blood, Ephesians. 6.12.
Men in Power and high Places, such as Herod, Pontius Pilate, and the Rulers of
the Jews, but Principalities and Powers, no less than Beelzebub himself, and
all his Train, Mat. 4.5, 6, 7.
whom he fairly engaged with eminent Success.

XIV. Jesus made use both of Armor and Weapons; he saw no small need for it.
viz. Ephesians. 6.14, 15, 16, 17.
1. The Breastplate of Righteousness, when Satan, and wicked Men, by their
Temptations would have drawn him from his Allegiance, by great Proffers of
Power and Glory. See the nature of the Christian Armor under the Head of
Metaphors relating to the Graces of the Spirit.
2. The Sword of the Spirit, by which he cut down the Devil, and the wicked
Jews, in all their Assaults: It is written, it is written, etc. 3. The Shield
of Faith, when he came to the last and most bloody Battle of all: For the Joy
that was set before him, he endured the Cross, Heb. 12.2.
despised the Shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.

XV. Jesus Christ, like a most valiant Captain, made good his Ground against
all the Force and Artillery of Hell, in a glorious manner, even to the death of
the Cross.

XVI. Christ took great care of his Saints, to preserve and secure them, how
ever it fared with himself. 1. He left them good Orders to observe in his
absence, the Rules of the holy Gospel. 2. He took care to send them a good
Guide for their Conduct, no less than the Holy Ghost, Joh. 14*16. Joh. 17.11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 20. Joh. 17.11, 15.
the Comforter. 3. He prayed for them on Earth, and he prays in Heaven, to
engage the Protection of Almighty God for them: Father, keep through thine own
Name those that thou have given me, etc.

XVII. Jesus Christ prefers his Saints and Followers, whom he finds worthy: He
gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers,
Ephesians. 4.11.
for the Work of the Ministry, etc. I thank Christ Jesus, who has put me into
the Ministry. 1 Timothy 1.12.


XVIII. Christ made not Novices, and unexperienced Christians, Ministers and
Pastors of Churches, 1 Timothy 3.6*
and Leaders of Societies; He set Peter, James, and John to be Apostles and
Leaders in the first place; and Paul, Sylvanus, and Timotheus, stout and brave
Commanders, to bring up (as it were) the Rear: God has set forth us the
Apostles last of all, as it were, 1 Cor. 4.9*
appointed to Death.

XIX. Jesus Christ, in all weighty Affairs, is joined with the Father and holy
Spirit, the great Council of Heaven; and without Him, who is called Wonderful,
Counselor, Isa. 9.6.
there is nothing of grand Importance transacted either in Heaven or Earth;
nay, without him was nothing done at first; All things were made by him, and
without him was not any thing made that was made. Joh. 1.3.
When Commission was givn to Creatures of all kinds to act in their proper
sphere, Christ was there. See Counselor.

XX. Christ's place is a place of Honor, because he was Worthy; and the Army
that he has raised is not a Rebellious Army, but legally raised, Rev. 5.3, 4.
and behave themselves well; they are kept under good Government and
Discipline, not one debauched person in the Army is continued in the
Muster-Rolls, but presently turned off, blotted out, and delivered up to Satan,
when discovered by his inferior Officers to be such. 1 Cor. 5.5.
Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness: From such turn away.
Deliver such over to Satan; turn him into his own Kingdom. Because thou have
loved Righteousness, and hated Iniquity, Heb. 1.9.
therefore God, even thy God, has anointed thee with the Oil of Gladness above
thy Fellows. That all Men might honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.
Joh. 5.23.


XXI. Jesus Christ offers Terms of Peace and Reconciliation, because he would
prevent their Ruin, if possible, before he falls upon them and fights against
them with the Sword of his Mouth. Turn at my Reproof: Prove. 1.23.
how often would I have gathered thy Children together, etc. In what Place
soever you enter, say, Peace, etc. I gave her space to repent of her
Fornication, Mat. 23.
but she repented not. Rev. 2.21. I will kill her Children with Death, etc.

XXII. Jesus Christ when his Grace and Offers of Mercy are refused, has, and
will make slaughtering work in the Earth. O what work was made upon Jerusalem!
not long after the refusing the terms of Peace, and offers of Grace and Favor
by Jesus Christ. See the lamentable Story in Josephus, etc. And what work will
shortly be made with bloody Rome, in the day of Death. Mourning and Famine that
is coming on apace, Rev. 16.5, 6.
when she shall have Blood given her to drink, and shall be utterly burnt with
Fire. And what Devastation will be made by this great Captain, (who is red in
his Apparel, and his Clothes as them that tread in the Wine Press) at the
Battle of Armagedon, when the vast Armies of the Beast shall be slaughtered and
destroyed, by the sharp Sword that goes out of his Mouth, And Blood shall come
forth to the Horses Bridles, Rev. 14.19, 20. Ezekiel. 39.12.
for a thousand and six hundred Furlong^^; The Fowls of Heaven shall be filled
with their Flesh, there shall be burying work for Multitudes, seven Months. By
Fire and Sword shall he plead with all Flesh, and the slain of the Lord shall
be many. Isa. 66.15, 16.

XXIII. Jesus Christ at his first coming did weaken the Kingdom of Satan,
spoiled Principalities, set up Trophies of his Victory, Ephesians. 4.9. Col. 2.15.
made a show of them openly, led Captivity in Triumph, and will complete the
Work at his second Coming, will take the old Dragon and bind him for a thousand
Years. And at the end of the thousand Years, cast the Dragon, the Beast, and
the false Prophet, into the perpetual Dungeon. Rev. 20.2. v. 20. He will then
give a Reward to all his Prophets, and Saints, both great and small, make them
Rulers over Cities, over all Nations, To bind Kings in Chains, and Nobles in
Fetters of Iron; Psalm. 149.8, 9.
and dash them in pieces like Potters Vessels; give the Upright Dominion over
them in the Morning; place them upon Thrones with Palms in their Hands; make
them Kings and Princes in all the Earth, to Reign with him till he deliver up
the Kingdom to the Father, which puts a final End to all* the Wars; 1 Cor.
15*24, 28.
but retains the honorable Title of being the Captain of our Salvation, for
ever, even for ever, Amen.



Inferences.
I. FRom hence we may infer what great Danger Christ's Enemies are in, and the
certainty of their being spoiled if they stand it out against him. The Enemies
of the Lord shall be broken to pieces. 1 Samuel 2.10. the Lamb shall overcome
them. Rev. 17.14.

II. That it is best for all Christ's Followers to keep close to their Leader,
not to forsake their own Captain; they can never choose one like him: with him
there is safety, and certainty of Victory. Let us say to him, as Peter did,
Whither shall we go? (Thou art on the strongest side) for thou have the words
of Eternal Life.

III. That it is the Interest of all his Enemies, to submit to him whilst Terms
of Peace are offered to them, there is no standing out against him. Can thy
Heart endure? can thy Hands be strong in the day that he (the Lion of the Tribe
of Judah) shall deal with thee? Many, even of the Mighty, have fallen under
him, the Dragon and his Angels could not stand before him. How much less than
Man, that is a Worm; and the Son of Man, which is a Worm? Job 25.6. See
Metaphors, Consuming Fire, Ambassador, and Man of War.

Christ a Refiner.
Mal. 3.2, 3. For he is like a Refiners Fire, etc. He shall sit as a Refiner
and Purifier of Silver, etc.


THIS Similitude is taken from Refiners, who in Crucibles melt their Metal, and
separate the drossy parts from that which is pure: So Christ by a Divine Heat
and Warmth refines and purifies the Graces he bestows on Believers, consuming
the wicked and vicious parts, which are elsewhere called Dross. This Refining
is called the fiery Trial, 1 Cor. 3.13, etc. upon which place Chemnitius says
this fiery Trial is exercised either by outward Troubles, or by Temptations of
Conscience, or by a more clear Manifestation of Truth by the Word, which leads
Men from the darkness of Error and Ignorance to the Light, which purges out
those Dregs that agree not with the pure Graces of the Spirit.

Simile.
I. A Refiner is one that tries and refines Metals, whether Silver or Gold, etc.

II. The Gold, or Silver, before a Refiner's Fire refines, it as it is taken out
of the Earth, is full of drossy matter.

III. A Refiner to purge and purify Gold, that so he may make it very pure,
has his Furnace, and uses Fire.

IV. A Refiner knows before Gold is tried and refined in the Fire it is not for
his use, it is not pliable.

V. A Refiner, melts the Gold, and makes it very soft, and thereby makes it fit
for his purpase.

VI. A Refiner to hasten, and the better to accomplish his Work, makes the Fire
more hot, or adds to the heat thereof.

VII. A Refiner separates the dross from the Gold, and makes it much more fine
and pure than it was before, and thereby makes it very valuable. A little
refined Gold is much set by, and prized above that which is course and drossy.

VIII. A Refiner refines Gold once and again several times, if he designs to
make it very pure. We read of Silver, Seven times refined in a Furnace of
Earth. Psalm. 12.6.

IX. A Refiner finds it necessary to add or put something of another nature
into Gold, an allowed proportion of Allay, Pliny li. 33. p. 465. The Lord
Bacon's Natural Hist. p. 224.
whereby he opens and refines it the sooner; and indeed if something of that
nature be not done, Refiners would tell you Gold would be long before (if ever
so well) refined, and fitted for the Hammer.

X. A Refiner does not put his Gold into the Furnace to waste or spoil it, but
contrariwise that there it might be purified, not to receive loss thereby, he
would not lose a grain of it.

XI. A Refiner lets his Gold remain no longer in the Fire than till the dross
be consumed, and it is made pure and fit for his purpose.

XII. A Refiner in refining his Gold, wastes his Fuel.

XIII. A Refiner resolves by putting his Gold into the Fire to destroy all the
Dross; and indeed there is nothing besides the pure Gold that can endure and
abide the Fire; all Filth and drossy Matter, flies away like Smoke.

XIV. A Refiner finds by Experience, that pure Gold receives no detriment by
the Fire; Plin. lib. 33. c. 465.
though it grow less in quantity, and so that way may seem to waste, yet it is
much better in Nature or Quality.

XV. When a Refiner has purged and refined Gold, it is formed into choice and
rare Vessels, and other things fit for Use and Ornament.

Parallel.
I. JESUS CHRIST tries and refines his People, Lam. 4.2*
who are compared to Gold; and he not only tries them, but also their Graces.

II. The Hearts of God's People before Christ the Spiritual Refiner, refines
and purges them, are full of Corruption, Sin, Job 25.4. Mat. 15.19
and Filthiness. Naturally Men and Women are very foul and drossy.

III. Jesus Christ, that he may purge and purify his People, puts them into a
Furnace of Affliction. As the Fining-Pot for Silver, and the Furnace for Gold,
Prove. 17.3. Isa. 48.10.
so the Lord tries the Heart. I will refine thee, etc. I have chosen thee in
the Furnace of Affliction.

IV. Jesus Christ finds that until the Hearts of his People be purified and
refined by Him (which he does several ways) they are not yielding and pliable
in his Hand, they will not subject to his Will, nor be fit for his use.

V. Jesus Christ melts and softens his People by Affliction, and by the Spirit.
Thus says the Lord of Hosts, Behold, Jer. 9.7.
I will melt them, and try them; for what should I do else for the Daughter of
my People? As much as if he should say, What way else can I use to bring them
to be pliable, that I may fit them for my purpose? Job 23.16.
God (says Job) makes my Heart soft.

VI. Jesus Christ, if he sees that a small Fire, and easy Afflictions will not
refine and purify the Soul of a Believer, adds greater Afflictions, puts them
into a very hot Fire, great Trials, according to his own Wisdom, and good
pleasure of his Will. If need be, you are in heaviness, through manifold
Temptations: That the trial of your Faith, being much more precious than Gold,
1 Pet. 1.7.
etc. Think it not strange concerning the fiery Trial, which is to try you, 1
Pet. 4.1^^
as if some strange thing happened unto you.

VII. Jesus Christ by refining his People, separates their Dross from them,
separates Pride, Passion, Luke-warmness, Worldly-mindedness, etc. and thereby
makes Them and their Graces exceeding valuable. Tried Faith, tried Patience,
tried Love is highly esteemed; it is far beyond tried Gold. This is the fruit of
all, the taking away of your Sin. I will make a Man more precious than Gold,
even a Man above the Golden Wedg of Ophir. And Christ by refining, and putting
the whole Church into the Furnace, separates the Gold, the sincere Christians
from drossy Hypocrites.

VIII. Christ to refine and thoroughly purge and purify his Church, and the
Hearts of Believers, puts them into one Fire, one Affliction, and then into
another; hence God speaks of purifying his People seven times: for if you will
not for these things obey me, I will punish you seven times more according to
your Sins. God has many Fires.

IX. Christ adds something of another nature, other Metal (as I may say) into
his Gold, ( viz. his Church and People that are in the Furnace) there is the
additament of his Word and Spirit: Did not he add these to his People, 1 Cor.
6.11.
to refine and purify them, they would be long in the Fire before their Dross
would be washed and consumed away; nay, without the Word and Spirit,
Afflictions could never accomplish nor perfect the Work, and make them fit for
his use.

X. Jesus Christ does not put his Church (or any one believing Soul) into the
Furnace, to destroy, or any ways to hurt them, but purely out of a gracious
Design to make them more pure and serviceable unto him. Heb. 12.8, 9, 10.
Fathers for a few days chasten us after their pleasure; but he for our profit,
that we might be partakers of his Holiness. After he has tried me, I shall
come forth as Gold. Job 23.10
He takes much care that nothing be lost, none of them receive detriment
thereby.

XI. Christ will not suffer his People to remain in the Furnace, or under
Afflictions, any longer than he sees need of it, no longer than till all their
dross and filth be purged away. It Is but in measure, Isa. 27.7, 8
he knows when it is enough, and then he soon abates the Fire.

XII. Christ oft-times in refining of his Church, wastes the Wicked, who are
his Fuel, by which he many times purges them. In a secret way they hereby come
many times to be bruised and smitten, Psalm. 60.8.
the Fire of God's Wrath seizes upon them (as in the case of Pharaoh) whilst
they are persecuting his People.

XIII. Christ Jesus by putting his Children into the Furnace of Affliction,
resolves to burn up, waste, and destroy all Hypocrites and drossy Professors:
in a day of fiery Trial, they pass away like Smoke, Psalm. 37.20.
But the Wicked shall perish even like Smoke, they shall consume as the Smoke
vanishes, Psalm. 68 2.
so shall thou drive them away.

XIV. The Lord Jesus knows that sincere Souls, or faithful Christians, will
abide the day of his coming, when he sits as a Refiner, Mal. 3.2, 3.
viz. in a day of Distress and Tribulation; and though the Church thereby is
made less in bulk or quantity, the formal and drossy part being many times more
than the other; yet in quality, the Church thereby will shine forth more
gloriously, and consequently more acceptable unto God.

XV. Jesus Christ when he has thoroughly refined and purged his Saints, they are
made choice and golden Vessels, the delight of Christ, and for the use and
ornament of the Church. In a great House there are not only Vessels of Gold and
Silver, etc. 2 Timothy 2.20. The precious Sons of Zion comparable to fine Gold,
how are they esteemed as Earthen Pitchers! etc. Lam. 4.2. See Vessels.



METAPHOR.
I. A Refiner refines but a little Gold at a time; comparatively his Furnace is
of small Dimension.

II. When a Refiner has put Gold into a Crucible, to be melted in order to
make it pliable, and fit to be wrought, adds a quantity or allowable proportion
of Allay, which is of less value, as Silver, or Copper.

Disparity.
I. CHrist many times in one Furnace of Affliction, refines almost all the
Gold, or godly Ones in a whole Kingdom, as he dealt with the whole House of
Israel.

II. Christ when he puts his Saints into his Furnace, to make them maleable,
and fit to be wrought by the Hammer of the Word, into the Image of God; he puts
in a measure of the Holy Spirit, which is of more worth and value than the Gold
it self, ( viz. the Saints) for indeed so hard is the Heart, notwithstanding
the Fire of that Affliction, that there is no work can be made of it without
the Spirit.



Inferences.
I. THis may inform us concerning the purpose and design of Christ, respecting
fiery Trials, which the Godly meet with in this World; that Afflictions are not
for the hurt or injury of the Church.

II. It also shows us what Filth and Corruption is in our Hearts; what reason
have we to bewail our inward Pollution, that nothing will purge and cleanse us,
1 John 1.7. Isa. 27.9.
but Christ's Blood, his Word, Spirit, and Affliction.

III. Moreover, let us learn from hence, to cry to God, when we are in the
Furnace, when in the Fire, that Christ would apply his Blood, Word, and Holy
Spirit to our Souls; for if otherwise, all Sufferings and Afflictions will be
unprofitable unto us.

IV. And O that Christians would take heed! in days of Liberty and Prosperity,
to walk humbly and holily before the Lord, and beware lest they contract Filth
and Pollution upon their own Souls, and so provoke Christ to put them into his
Furnace. If the shaking of the Rod would bring us upon our Knees, and reform
our Hearts and Lives, Christ would not bring slaying and fiery Dispensations
upon us.

V. It may put us all upon the search, to see if we are sincere, Gold, and not
Dross: for if we are corrupt Matter, the Furnace will make a clear
Discrimination of it; Mal. 3.18.
for indeed, Every Man's Work shall be tried so as by (or out of the) Fire. 1
Cor. 3.13.

VI. Let all Professors from hence be wakened; Christ the Refiner is near, and
the day of Trial comes on apace; but how will thou stand when he appears? There
is an Amazing Dispensation at hand, the Church of God shall be thoroughly purged
and made white, the drossy Christian e're long shall be consumed, and pass away
like the Smoke of a Refiners Furnace.

VII. How good is God to take so great Pains with us? that he might make us fit
for fit for his own Use and Eternal Life. This way he makes us meet to be
Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. Col. 1.12. As Heaven is
prepared for us, so Christ is preparing us for Heaven.

VIII. This may support and comfort us under Affliction: for tho no Chastening
seems joyous at present, but grievous; yet nevertheless afterward it yields
the peaceable Fruit of Righteousness, unto them that are exercised thereby.
Heb. 12.


Christ compared to an Eagle.
Exodus 19.4. Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on
Eagles Wings, and brought you unto my self.

Deuteronomy. 32.11, 12. As an Eagle stirs up her Nest, fluttereth over her Young,
spreads her Wings, looks to them, bears them on her Wings; so the Lord
did lead him, etc.

Rev. 12.14. And to the Woman were given two Wings of a great Eagle, that she
might fly into the Wilderness, etc.


SOme say, that the word (...), Aquila, an Eagle, is derived of (...), to be
carried violently: Others from an intensive (...), and (...), which signifies a
Year, because it is lively, from whence came the Proverb, Vivacior Aquila,
livelier than an Eagle. Others say, That the Latin, Aquila, is derived ab
aquilo color, from its dun color. For its swiftness, and seldom returning,
Job says, chap. 9.26. My days pass away as the Eagle, etc. that is, swiftly,
and never to return. Because of its velocity and forcible flight, it denotes
the quick invasion of an Enemy. Jer. 48.40. and 49.22. Hos. 8.1. Micha 1.16.
which describes the greatness of the Calamity.

Exodus 19.4. I have born you on Eagles Wings; that is, the Lord has lovingly
supported and cherished you, as Eagles do their young, who bear them safe over
craggy and dangerous places. See Jer. 4.13. Lam. 4.19. It Is said, Psalm. 103.5.
Thy youth is renewed like the Eagles; that is, he has strengthened thee so, as
to go through all Difficulties, etc. Galatinus says, that the Messiah is
called an Eagle, Prove. 30.19, etc.

But in the Texts alleged, viz. Deuteronomy. 32.12. Exodus 19.4, etc. the Lord is
compared to an Eagle, with respect to the Protection and Safety of his People,
the Swiftness of his Deliverances, and his tender Care and Affection to them.

The great Eagle (Annotators tell us) signifies the Lord Jesus: and it seems
to be an Allusion to that Flight of the Church from Egypt to Canaan, Ainsworth
Wilson.
which she undertook not by her own Counsel, but by the Lord's Command; and
performed not by her own Strength, but by the Lord's. As the Church of Israel
fled from the Dragon, Deuteronomy. 32.11, 12. Eze^^. 29.3 Rev. 12.14 Exodus 9.4. Deuteronomy.
32.11, 12.
Pharaoh, as he is called, Ezekiel. 29.3. So the Christian Church fled from the
Serpent or Dragon here, Ainsworth
with two Wings of a great Eagle.

Now tho I deny not, but these Scriptures refer to God the Father; yet may they
as safely, and in the Judgment of some, more properly refer to the Lord Jesus
Christ. Stephen, speaking of Christ, says, This was he that was with the
Fathers in the Wilderness, which spoke to them in Mount Sinai, etc.

Simile.
See Caryl on Job 39.30.
I. THe Eagle is a Royal Bird, the Princess or Queen of all the Birds of the Air.

II. The Eagle is a very strong Fowl; Naturalists speak much of the Eagle in
this respect: Eagles carry the Prize, says Pliny, both for Honor and Strength.

Plin. lib. 10. c. 3. Job 39.27.
III. The Eagle mounts up exceeding high, out of the reach, or sight of Men.

IV. The Eagle has a very piercing Eye: when she is on high, can see down to
the Earth, Pliny.
nay, behold the small Fish in the Sea.

Deuteronomy. 28.49. Job 9.25. 2 Samuel 1.23. Job 8.1.
V. The Eagle is a mighty swift Creature: My Days are swifter than an Eagle. She
is swift in pursuit of her Prey.

VI. The Eagle, Historians tell us, fights with Dragons and Serpents, Pliny,
lib. 10. cap. 4.
and overcomes them.

VII. The Eagle has strong* and long Wings, which she easily spreads forth for
the succor and help of her young. Ezekiel. 17.3


VIII. The Eagle bears and carries her young upon her Wings, she spreads abroad
her Wings, Deuteronomy. 32.11, 12.
takes them, bears them upon her Wings.

IX. The Eagle hides her Young in high and mighty Rocks, where her Nest is,
even in the same ragged place of inaccessible Rocks. Job 39.27, 28.


X. The Eagles Voice (Naturalists tell us) is so terrible, that when he is
angry, Wolfang, Frantz. Hist Animal. de Aquil. p. 325, 338.
he makes all living Creatures to be afraid. Dracones, audito etangore
Aquilarum, fugerunt in speluncas: The Dragons, when they hear the angry Voice
of the Eagles, fly into the Dens to hide themselves.

XI. The Eagles way in the Air cannot be known. Prove. 30.


XII. Historians say, the Eagle can look on the Sun in its brightest Splendour
without being dazzled. She tries her young Ones the same way, to see whether
they be her true Offspring; for if they cannot behold the Sun but wink, or
their Eyes water, they turn them out of their Nest, and disown them, as
Degenerates or Bastards.

XIII. The Eagle trains up her Young to be like her self, and to mount up as
she mounts.

XIV. The Eagle is very careful and tender of her Young.

Aelian. l. 14. c. 14. See Caryl on Job 39.
XV. Naturalists tell us, the Eagle gives her Young Ones of her own Blood, when
she cannot get other Blood for them to drink.

XVI. The Eagle is very long-lived. The Greeks express her by a word signifying
Longevity. And some give the Reason, not only from the excellent Temperament of
her Body, but because she lives in such a pure Air, free from all evil Vapors,
and noisome Smells.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, King of Kings, Rev. 1
5. Rev. 19.16
and Lord of Lords. As the Eagle among Birds, so Christ, both amongst Men and
Angels, has the pre-eminence.

II. The Lord Jesus Christ is called the Mighty God: I have laid help on one
that is mighty. Psalm. 89.19
For Strength he is compared to a Lion. What is all human and natural Power, to
the Strength and Power of Jesus Christ!

III. The Lord Jesus, after his Resurrection, mounted up exceeding high, into
the highest Heavens, Ephesians. 4.10. Heb. 7.26.
far out of the sight of Man's natural Eye, where he cannot be reached by
wicked Men or Devils.

IV. Jesus Christ has a wonderful piercing Eye, sees not only from the
highest Clouds, (whither the Eagle mounts) but from the highest Heaven; can
look into the Secrets of every Man's Heart, even into the Hell of wicked Men's
diabolical Counsels, and can thoroughly see their bloody Purposes and
Contrivances; although they dig never so deep, yet they cannot hide themselves
from his Omniscience, for he sees what they are doing.

V. The Lord Jesus is swift when he comes to fight against the Enemies of his
Church, he is swift in the executing of his Judgments, swift to deliver and
help his People. See Metaph. Sun, Heart, etc.

VI. Jesus Christ, the spiritual Eagle, fought with that great red Dragon the
Devil, Genesis 3.15.
and has bruised the head of the Dragon.

VII. The Lord Jesus has strong Love, enlarged and great Affections, which
like two long Wings he stretches out easily in the way of his gracious
Providence, for the help and succor of his People; He shall arise with healing
under his Wings. Mal. 4.2.


VIII. The Lord Jesus bears and carries his faithful Children upon the Wings
of his Power and Sovereign Grace; thus he bare and carried Israel of old, I
have borne you upon Eagles Wings. Hearken unto me, O House of Jacob, Exodus
19.14. Isa. 46.3, 4.
and all the Remnant of the House of Israel, who are borne by me from the
Belly, which were carried from the Womb: I will bear you, I will carry you, etc.

IX. The Lord Jesus hides his Children in the Secrets of the Almighty, that
glorious Rock of Ages: Isa. 33.16.
Their Place of Defense shall be a Munition of Rocks. David knew what he did,
when he fled to God for Shelter: Under the Shadow of thy Wings will I make my
Refuge, Psalm. 57.1.
until these Calamities are overpast. See Refuge.

X. Jesus Christ when he utters his Voice in Anger, and rises up to the Prey,
he will cause all the Inhabitants of the Earth to tremble; they will call to
the Hills and Mountains to fall upon them, Rev. 6.18.
and to hide them from the Face of him that sits upon the Throne, and from
the Wrath of the Lamb. Nay, the Time will come, when the old Dragon will be
glad to fly into his Den. The Devils were afraid of him, when he came as a
Lamb: Art thou come to torment us before the time? Be wise now therefore, O ye
Kings; be instructed, O ye Judges of the Earth: Kiss the Son, lest he be angry,
and ye perish from the day, Psalm. 2.10, 12*
when his Wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their
Trust in him.

XI. The way of Christ's Love, Wisdom, Providence, Job 11.17 Ephesians. 3.1^^.
etc. cannot be known or found out to perfection.

XII. Jesus Christ has a glorious and clear Sight, can behold with open Face
the Glory of the excellent Majesty, and the highest Splendour and Beauty of that
immortal and inaccessible Light, which no natural Eye can approach unto. And
although none of his People can see as he sees, who is infinite in Knowledge; yet
those that pretend to be his Offspring, Phil. 2.5, 6 1 Pet. 1.16 Col. 3.1.
and are not like him in Grace, Heavenly-mindedness, and Holiness, nor
endeavor after it, from that Excellency they behold in it, Christ will utterly
disown them, as being none of his Seed or Offspring.

XIII. The Lord Jesus teaches all his People to be like himself, Isa. 40, 31.
so far as they are able, and to mount up as with Eagles Wings, and to live on
high.

XIV. So is the Lord Jesus of his People. Joh. 21.15


XV. The Lord Jesus suffered himself to be wounded for us; his Hands and Feet,
yea, his very Heart was pierced, that we might have his Blood to drink in
believing: My Blood is Drink indeed. Joh. 6.


XVI. The Lord Jesus Christ is not only long-lived, but he lives for ever: He
was from everlasting, Rev. 1.18*
and he will be to everlasting. He is the King eternal, the Father of Eternity;
so the Hebrew. Isa. 9.6.




Simile.
THe Eagle has many evil Qualities: She is neither fair nor comely, has no
sweet Voice, nor is she good for Food; but she is quarrelsom, preying,
devouring, solitary, envious to others, proud and lofty, the Plague and
Tormentor of all other Birds or Fowls of the Air, an Enemy to Peace: She has
horrible Claws; feeds on Serpents, Fish, and Carrion; snatching up Geese,
Hares, Lambs, etc. Gesner reports, that a certain Eagle's Nest was found,
wherein were three hundred Ducks, one hundred and sixty Geese, forty Hares, and
many Fishes. An Eagle is very crafty: She fills her Wings with Dust, and gets
upon a Stag's Horns, and beating the Dust and Sand into his Eyes, she blinds
him, and then soon conquers him. She carries Shell-Fishes on high, letting them
fall upon the Rocks to break them, etc.

Disparity.
IN all these things there can be no greater Disparity imaginable; and upon
this account wicked Men, or Tyrants, are compared to Eagles.



Inferences.
I. Fly to Christ, to bear you upon his Wings.

II. To hide you under the Wings of his gracious Protection: Under thy Wings,
says David, will I make my Refuge, till these Calamities are overpast, etc.
Psalm. 57.1.


Christ compared unto a Bundle of Myrrh.
Cant. 1.13. A Bundle of Myrrh is my Beloved unto me.


THis Book expresses, under many different Metaphors and Similitudes, the
Greatness of Christ's Love to his Church, and the Sincerity of the Churches
Love to Christ. Sometimes you have Christ commending his Spouse, sometimes the
Spouse speaking in the praise of Christ, as she does here, A Bundle of Myrrh, a
Cluster of Camphire, is my Beloved unto me. A Soul espoused to Jesus Christ
has a great Love to him, and an high Esteem of him, knows not how to set out
that excellent Worth and Beauty it beholds in him.

Myrrh is a kind of precious Fruit, plentifully growing in Arabia; it is
somewhat bitter, but most fragrant, and of excellent use in Physic.

METAPHOR.
I. MYrrh has a perfuming quality; it is of a fragrant and odoriferous Nature;
it is used for perfuming Garments, and other things, to make them cast a
pleasant Smell: Psalm. 45.9.
All thy Garments smell of Myrrh, Aloes, and Cassia. The Harlot says, Prove.
7.17.
She had perfumed her Bed with Myrrh, Aloes, and Cinnamon.

II. Myrrh is a rare and rich Perfume, a fit Present for a King; hence the wise
Men of the East honored Christ with Myrrh at his Birth. Mat 2.


III. Myrrh has a preserving Quality; it keeps things from corruption,
putrefying, and rotting. Hence the Friends of Christ brought Myrrh, Joh 19.39,
40.
Aloes, and other Spices, for the embalming of his Body after his Crucifixion.

IV. Myrrh has a beautifying quality. The Virgins that prepared themselves for
Ahasuerus, made use of Myrrh. It Is good to take away the Wrinkles from the
Face, and to make the Skin smooth and shining.

V. Myrrh, that which is the right and true Arabia Myrrh, is not easily known
by the Vulgar, Plin. lib. 12. cap. 16.
as Pliny notes. Many cannot make Judgment about it; some take the false Indian
Myrrh, that grows upon a Thorny Plant, for the right Sort.

VI. Myrrh has a healing quality: Physicians make use of it for the removing
of several Distempers. Plin. lib. 12.
Pliny says, it dries up Rheums, clears the Voice, helps the ill Savor of the
Breath, etc.

VII. Myrrh was the first and principal Ingredient of the holy anointing Oil,
that was appointed to be made use of for the anointing of Aaron, Ainsworth
the Tabernacle, and the Pertinents thereof.

It Is called a Bundle, or (as Ainsworth reads it) a Bag of Myrrh:

1. To denote the Plenty or Fullness of that odoriferous Gum.

2. A Bundle or Bag keeps things safe that are of worth: The Soul of my Lord
shall be bound in the Bundle of Life, 1 Samuel 25.29.
with Jehovah his God.

Parallel.
I. JEsus Christ has a perfuming Virtue. See how the Church describes him for
his Fragrancy: Cant. 3.6.
Who is this that comes out of the Wilderness, like Pillars of Smoke, perfumed
with Myrrh and Frankincense, with all the Powders of the Merchant? We read of
the sweet Scent of the Church; but how comes she to smell so rarely, but from
the Communication of the sweet Graces of Christ to her. Sinners are very
unsavory, until this Myrrh-Tree has dropped upon them.

II. Christ is the richest and purest Perfume Heaven and Earth can afford; none
so sweet. How fragrant is he in the Nostrils of God the Father! He even
ravishes the Senses of Angels and Saints, Rev. 8.4, 5
makes us, and all our Duties, as sweet Odours unto the Father.

III. Christ has in him a preserving Quality or Power; were it not for that
Life he has communicated to us, and the rest of Mortals, how soon would our
Bodies rot? But in a special manner he preserves our Souls. Sin is of a
rotting, stinking, and putrefying Nature, compared to a Leprosy, and filthy
Sores; Isa. 1.5, 6, 7.
now if Christ did not drop daily a little of his Myrrh, I mean, the Grace of
his Spirit, into our Souls, how loathsome should we soon become?

IV. Jesus Christ makes every Believer beautiful; they have no Comeliness but
what he has put upon them. It Is he that makes their Faces to shine, Ezekiel.
^^6.14. Ephesians. 5.27.
who takes away every Spot and Wrinkle, and presents them a perfect Beauty in
the Father's sight, by imputing and imparting of Righteousness unto them
through Faith.

V. Christ, the true Christ of God, is not easily known to the ignorant; many
take a false Christ for the true Christ. Some are so blind, that they think the
Light which is in every Man, the Light of natural Conscience, is the Christ of
God, and Savior of the World.

VI. Jesus Christ has many medicinal Virtues; By his Stripes we are healed.
Isa. 53.5.
He dries up all evil and offensive Rheums; makes Prayer, the Breath or
Breathings of the Soul, savoury; clears the ^^oice, and helps our Infirmities,
by which ^^eans we pray more elegantly and ferven^^y, in the Spirit; takes away
all Impediments, so that our Prayers are heard and accepted by the Father.

VII. The Spirit of Christ, Joh. 2 20. Heb. 1.9.
and Graces thereof, are compared to Oil: He is the Myrrh-Tree, from whence the
Divine Oil flows, wherewith the Ministers and Saints of God are more or less
anointed.

See Oil of Gladness.

1. In Christ is abundance of Divine Sweetness; not a Sprig or two, but a great
Bundle; not two or three Grains, but a Bag filled with it, or a Bundle of
heavenly Myrrh.

2. Whatever is good in Christ, is laid up safe. Believers may waste or lose
much of the Grace of Christ in them; but none of that which is bound up in this
sacred Bundle can be lost.



METAPHOR.
I. MYrrh has some Dregs in it, tho never so purely refined.

II. Other Myrrh may be bought for Money.

III. Other Myrrh will lose its Virtue, if kept overlong.

IV. The Myrrh-Tree does not always drop; Pliny.
this Gum distills but at certain Seasons of the Year.

Disparity.
I. IN Christ is no Dregs, no Sin, nothing but what is invaluably precious.

II. All the Riches of both the Indies cannot purchase one drain of this Divine
Myrrh.

III. Christ's Virtue is ever the same. Heb. 13.8.


IV. Christ, the spiritual Myrrh-Tree, is always dropping.



Application.
1. CHrist is a precious Jesus, and saving Grace worth the prizing; it is like
to sweet smelling Myrrh.

2. What a Mercy is it to have our spiritual Senses so exercised, as to discern
between things that differ?

3. What Eyes do they see with, that despise and slight Jesus Christ? This
Bundle of Myrrh, this Rose of Sharon, this Lilly of the Valleys, is not so much
regarded by the most of Men, as a Bundle of Thorns and Briars.

4. You that love a sweet Smell, here is a precious Perfume for your unsavory
Souls: Notwithstanding all your rare Gums, Odors, and fragrant Flowers, Spices,
and choice Powders, you will smell rank and unsavory in the Nostrils of God,
if you have not this Bundle of Myrrh to perfume your Souls and Services.

5. If Believers receive all their Graces and Sweetness from Christ, Rev. 5.12,
13.
let them make grateful Acknowledgments thereof to Him.

Christ the Saints Wedding Garment.
Mat. 22.11, 12. And he said unto him, Friend, how came thou hither, not
having a Wedding Garment? etc.


THIS Text, is part of the Parable of the Marriage; Mat. 22. And the Word
Parable, is thus expounded by Jerome, Tom. 3. Epist. 51. ad Algasiam q. 6. p.
359. Parabola, hoe est, Similitudo quae ab eo vocatur, quod alteri, (...), hoc
est, assimilatur, and quasi umbra praevia Veritatis est. A Parable, that is, a
Similitude so called, because it is like another thing, and is as it were a
previous shadow of Truth. The word (...), is derived of (...) to compare or
liken, Jansen. in Conc. Evang.
it answers to the Hebrew (...) Mashal. In the New Testament it signifies an
Enigmatical, or Allegorical Comparison, etc. For further account, the Reader is
referred to the Place where we treat of Parables.

The Phrase (...), (the Wedding Garment) is borrowed from a custom among the
Ancients, where every Guest at that Solemnity, was arrayed in a Habit peculiar
only to such Feasts, and such as wanted it were accounted Intruders, viz. such
as without any Right thrust themselves in. Now in this Parable all Orthodox
Expositors affirm, that by the King, ver. 2. we are to understand JEHOVAH; by
his Son, the Messiah; by his Servants, the Ministers of the Gospel; by such
that found pretenses of Absence, worldly-minded Persons, that prefer their
temporal Pleasures before Grace and true Religion; by the Invitation of the
Guests, the calling of the Gentiles, etc. by him that wanted the
Wedding Garment, Hypocrites, or such as have not put on Christ spiritually,
(that is, are not clothed with his Righteousness by Faith) whose doom is
damnation, ver. 13. All the best Expositors agree, by the Wedding Garment is
intended Christ's Righteousness, or Imputed Righteousness, which is put on the
Soul by Faith for Justification. For the further demonstration hereof, see the
following Parallel.

METAPHOR.
I. THe use and necessity of Garments came in by the Fall, Adam in Innocence
had no need of them.

II. Garments are to cover Nakedness, that Shame and Deformity may not appear
to others; for this reason did our first Parents sew Fig Leaves together to
cover themselves, and from hence God afterward made them Coats of Skins, Genesis
3.21.
etc.

III. Garments differ much in Worth and Excellency, we read in Scripture of
filthy Garments, and likewise of glorious Apparel.

IV. Garments are for Ornament, they set off natural Excellency, making Men and
Women appear very lovely and amiable in the eyes of others.

V. Garments are of great Utility in respect of Defense, they secure us from
many Hurts and Dangers, which naked ones are exposed to; they are Munimenta
Corporis, they are as light Armor to the Body in the Winter, they save the Body
from peircing Cold; in Summer they preserve and defend from parching Heat:
every Blast would pinch us, were it not for our Garments, every Thorn would
scratch us, every Blow would bruise us. Robinson.

VI. Garments are prepared and made fit for the Person that is to wear them, or
otherwise they are not comely.

VII. When a Person puts on a Wedding Garment, all other Garments are laid
aside as invaluable, and unseemly for a Bride to have on.

VIII. A Wedding Garment is usually very rich, if provided for a Person of
Honor, a Princess or some great Heiress.

IX. A rich and glorious Wedding Garment, is put on as a sign of Joy, and a
good Day.

X. Those who were invited to a Marriage amongst the Jews, as History tells us,
if they had not on a Wedding Garment, they were not entertained, nor suffered
to be amongst the Guests, but were (if observed) turned out of the
Wedding-Chamber.

XI. The Bride that is gloriously clothed, and adorned in her Marriage-Robes,
is delighted in, and rejoiced over by the Bridegroom.

Parallel.
I. THe necessity of Christ and his Righteousness, Genesis 1.27.
came in by original Depravity. Psalm. 51.5.
Man in Innocence had no need of a Savior, was perfect and wanted nothing.
Romans 7.17, 18.


II. Christ is the Souls Spiritual Cover. 1. He hides all our natural
Filthiness. 2. He hides and covers all our actual Sins and Pollutions. 3. He
covers all the Spots of our Holy Duties. Romans 3.25 Exodus 25.17, 18, 20.21.
Guild, Moses unvailed p. 101. Mr. Robinson's Christ all in all. p. 45.
The Cherubims under the Law covered the Mercy-Seat, the Mercy-Seat covered the
Ark where the two Tables of the Decalogue lay: this Mercy-Seat did typify
Christ. Jesus Christ covers all the Sins which Believers commit against the Law
of God. He delivers us from the Curse and Accusation thereof. Hence it is said,
God beheld no Iniquity in Jacob; he does not see it to impute it, because it is
hid under the covering Mercy-Seat, Jesus Christ.

III. All our Righteousness is as filthy Rags; and in another place compared
to a menstruous Cloth; Isa. 64 6.
our best Services are grievously defiled and polluted with Sin. But Christ is
a glorious Robe, his Righteousness is of inestimable Value, glorious Apparel,
which by Faith all true Believers are clothed with.

IV. Christ's Righteousness put on the Soul by Faith, Ezekiel. 16.12.
is the most beautiful Ornament, that ever Mortals were adorned with, Isa.
45.24.
this makes Men and Women amiable and very comely in the Eyes of God, Isa.
61.10.
and Holy Angels.

V. The Lord Jesus, clothing us with his Righteousness, defends us; 1. From
Sin, Sin has not Power and Dominion over us, it cannot bear sway nor hurt the
Soul, Romans 8.
because Christ has condemned it in the Flesh. It Is a vanquished wounded and
crucified Enemy. 2. Christ defends us from the smarting Pricks and Checks of
Conscience, when for want of Light, a Believer is accused and condemned, and is
driven almost into despair. Christ's Righteousness is a glorious Garment to
guard and keep off Conscience from mauling, breaking and bruising of him in
pieces; through Christ Saints obtain Deliverance. Come to me all ye that
labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest to your Souls. Mat. 1^^
29.
-- My Grace is sufficient for thee. 3. Christ defends us from the fiery Darts
and cruel Assaults of Satan. This roaring Lion would tear us in pieces, if this
impenetrable Garment were not between his Teeth and our Souls. His fiery Darts
would stick to the very Heart, did not this Garment blunt and dead them.
Notwithstanding all the Malice and Rage of the Devil; he cannot destroy us,
because we are clothed with Christ's Righteousness, and have the Lord Jesus to
be a Cover for us. 4. Christ defends us from eternal Wrath. God is to all that
are naked (to all that have not Christ on for Clothing) a scorching and
consuming Fire, the hottest Flames cannot touch the Body till they have burned
the Garments; but Wrath cannot seize any more upon Christ, he has overcome it,
and quenched its Burning; he has lain under it once for all, and therefore it
cannot seize on a Believer, who is circled about with Christ, and with his
Righteousness as with a Garment. The Fire cannot burn the Man whilst the Screen
is between him and the Flame. Jesus Christ is a Believer's Screen, which stands
continually between him and the devouring Flame of God's Anger. Robinson.

VI. Christ's Righteousness prepared for Believers, is made fit for the Soul,
it answers to the Law and Justice of God, it every way suits, accommodating
every Part, leaving none uncomely nor uncloathed in the sight of God.

VII. When a Soul puts on Christ's Righteousness by Faith it lays aside its own
Rags, Phil. 3.8, 9.10.
having no Confidence in the Flesh: if a Man is not stripped of all Hopes, Trust,
and Reliance, in respect of his own Righteousness, he will not seek for
another, neither can he put Christ on, for Christ is the (only) Garment for
such who are naked, and see an absolute necessity of that which is by Faith in
order to their being accepted in the Eyes of the Bridegroom.

VIII. Christ's Righteousness is a very rich and glorious Robe, curiously
wrought, the Person for whom it is provided, being nobly descended, born from
above, Ezekiel. 16.10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
and espoused to the Prince of Heaven and Earth. I clothed thee with
Embroidered Work, and covered thee with Silk; I decked thee with Gold, and thy
Ra^^ment was of fine Linen. The Kings Daughters were among the Honorable
Women. Psalm. 45.9, -- 13. Upon thy Right Hand did stand the Queen in Gold of
Ophir.

IX. The Righteousness of Christ put on by Faith, signifies Joy, Isa. 61.10,
11. 2 Cor. 6.10 1 These. 5.16.
and a good Day; the Soul that is clothed with this Robe of Righteousness,
that Beautiful Garment of Salvation, has infinite cause of Joy and Gladness;
hence says the Apostle, -- as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing. Rejoice in the
Lord always, and again, I say, rejoice. Phil. 4.4.

X. Those that have not the Spiritual Wedding Garment in the day when our
Bridegroom comes, shall not be entertained amongst Christ's Guests, but shall
be put out of the Wedding-Chamber, and turned into Eternal Darkness. And when
the King came in to see the Guests, he saw there a Man that had not on a
Wedding Garment: And he said unto him, Friend, how came thou in hither, not
having on a Wedding Garment? And he was speechless. Then said the King to his
Servants; Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into utter
Darkness, there shall be weeping and wailing, and gnashing of Teeth. Mat.
22.11, 12, etc.

XI. That Soul that has this Wedding Garment on, that is clothed and adorned
with Christ's Righteousness, that is justified and accepted by Faith; the Lord
Jesus takes great delight in, As a Young Man who marries a Virgin, etc. And as
a Bridegroom rejoices over the Bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee. Isa.
62.5.



METAPHOR.
I. A Garment can cover but one at once, it cannot cloth several Persons.

II. Every material Garment will not serve to cover every part of the Body:
that which is proper for the Head, will not cover the Loins, and that which
fits the Body will not fit the Feet; every part of the Body has a distinct
clothing which is only proper for it self.

III. There is not one particular Garment that serves for all uses for the
Body; some Robes are good for Covering, but are not for Beauty; other Garments
serve for Ornament, but they do not serve for Defense; some Garments are good
to wear in cold Winter-Weather, but not good for the Heat in the midst of
Summer. Persons of Ability have several Garments for several uses, because
there is no one Garment good on all occasions.

IV. No one Garment will fit all Bodies; that which sits decently on one Sex,
would be uncomly on another; that which will fit a Child will not fit a Man,
that which is proper for a Prince will not become nor suit a Subject.

V. Other Garments may be pierced, a Sword may be thrust through them, they may
be spoiled, burnt or cut to pieces.

VI. All material Garments may be corrupted, Moths may eat them, they may be
worn out by using and turn into Rags, even the strongest Garments that ever
were made.

VII. The best and richest Wedding Garment that ever was made, the Price
thereof may soon be accounted and easily reckoned up.

VIII. Other Garments may be stained, catch Spots and Dirt, and many ways be
defiled.

Disparity.
I. THis is a large Garment, the Robe of Christ's Righteousness can cover many,
though they be at never so great a distance. Should I say, says Bernard, Rev.
7.9.
That Christ's Righteousness will not serve for him and me; Non est pallium
breve quod duos operire non potest. All the Elect of God tho they live in
several Nations, tho they be a Multitude which no Man can number; yet they are
clothed, and sufficiently, with this one Garment. I saw a Wonder in Heaven, a
Woman clothed with the Sun. Rev. 12.1.
This Woman is the Church of God, this Sun is Jesus Christ, Mal. 4.2.
the Sun of Righteousness (as he is called.) All Believers are covered,
clothed and adorned with one and the same Garment, and every one has it as an
entire Garment to himself.

II. This Spiritual Garment fits every part, Christ is a Diadem, or Crown upon
the Head, and Shoes for the Feet. Luke 15.22
Christ's Righteousness is a complete suit of Apparel from head to foot; the
Soul that has this Wedding Garment on, is perfectly and completely clothed.

III. This spiritual Garment is for all Uses, and all Seasons, it is both for
Covering and Ornament; it is as proper and necessary in Winter as in Summer, and
in Summer as in Winter; it is good for the Travellor, it is the Laborers
Garment, it is the Soldiers Garment, it is good to fight in; it is the Princes
Garment, yea, and the Subjects Garment, it is the Christians Garment, it is
very light and pleasant to walk in, and yet thick to defend from Stormy
Weather. Christ suits all occasions, states and conditions of the Soul or Souls
that have an Interest in him. He is made of God unto us Wisdom, Righteousness,
Sanctification and Redemption. 1 Cor. 1.30.

IV. This Spiritual Garment, the Righteousness of Christ is as fit for one as
for another, it is as fit and as proper for the Peasant as for the Prince; the
same Garment here that is for the Man, is for the Woman, for the Child as for
the Father. There is neither Barbarian, Scythian, Col. 3.11.
Jew nor Gentile, Male nor Female, Bond nor Free, but ye are all one in Christ.
The Righteousness of Christ is a fit Garment for the Souls of Men, there is no
Soul too big, no Soul too little, none too small, none too great for Christ's
Righteousness to array and cover.

V. But this Garment no Dirt nor Spear can pierce or enter into, no Devil can
tear nor rend it, nor can all the powers of Hell, Sin or Darkness burn or
destroy it.

VI. But this Spiritual Garment is durable and lasting, the Moth cannot corrupt
nor consume it, it never grows old, nor can it be worn out, it is as fresh and
as beautiful at the last as at the first putting on.

VII. The worth and price of this Wedding Garment can never be valued, it is
worth Millions, yea thousands of Millions, the Riches of the whole World are
nothing in comparison of it. What would a Christless Soul give, in the great
Day for this Robe, viz. to be clothed with Christ's Righteousness?

VIII. This Robe cannot be defiled, the Garment of Sanctification may take
Spots; hence we read of some who had their Garments spotted with the Flesh; and
of others, who had not defiled their Garments; but a Christians Wedding-Robe
can sustain no Pollution; the Life of Christ was without Spot, his
Righteousness pure and perfect, which Saints are clothed with in respect of
Justification: hence Christ calls his Love, his Dove, his undefiled One. Thou
art all fair, my Love, and there is no Spot in thee. See Metaphor, Christ a
Garment for Sanctification.



Inferences.
I. THis shows the miserable State of those that are without Christ, such have
not on the Wedding Garment, they want that excellent Robe that renders the
Godly Person amiable in the Bridegroom's sight; and all that have it not on,
shall be shut out of the Wedding-Chamber.

II. It shows also the happy and blessed Condition of all sincere and godly
Ones. See Garment of Sanctification.

Christ the Bright and Morning Star.
Rev. 22.16. I am the Root, and Offspring of David, and the Bright and Morning
Star.


MOrning Star, in the Greek (...), a Star of exceeding Brightness,
Metaphorically signifies, the shining Light of the paths of the Just. Prove.
4.18. (where the Hebrew word is Lucifer, for the Morning Star) so Job 11.17. A
fuller Knowledge of God by inward Illumination. 2 Pet. 1.19. The King of
Assyria. Isa. 14.17. The glorious Light of Eternity. Rev. 2.28. (see Dan. 12.3.
1 Cor. 15.41, 42.) Lastly, Christ the Savior of the World. Rev. 22.16. for
which see Phil. Sacra. chap. 8. of an Anthropopathy, and the following Parallel.

METAPHOR.
I. THe Morning Star is a very solid Light, without twinkling, corruscation or
sparkling, as other Stars do.

II. The Bright and Morning Star is the Harbinger to the greatest of natural
Joy ( viz.) rising of the Sun, what does the Earth desire more?

III. The Morning Star is a great Ornament to the Heavens: this is so visible,
that it needs no Instances to prove it.

IV. The Morning Star is a very pleasant Object to all that have Eyes to behold
it and love the Light.

V. The Morning Star is esteemed not a little useful to guide Mariners when
they have lost the light of their more common Guide, ( viz.) the Pole Star.

VI. The Morning Star is by Astronomers accounted a Star of the first Magnitude.

VII. The Morning Star is observed to be a terror to Thieves and evil Men, when
they see this Sun of the Morning appear they haste away to hide themselves,
lest the light of the Day should overtake and discover them.

VIII. The Morning Star (as other Stars) is fixed in its Orb, wherein it
performs a constant Motion.

IX. The Morning Star gives most Light just before break of Day.

X. It is the Opinion of some, that the Morning Star does send forth very
blessed Influences upon those Bodies that are under its Dominion.

XI. The Morning Star does chiefly govern pleasant and delightful Plants.

XII. The Morning Star is accounted the master Planet, for Moderation, said to
cause gentle Storms in Winter, and moderate Heat in Summer.

XIII. The Morning Star is said to be the cause of Beauty.

XIV. The Morning Star does most Service in Winter, because the greatest part
of that Season is Night and Darkness.

XV. The Morning Star has an honorable Name, it is called the Son of the
Morning.

XVI. The morning Star is known to be the Evening Star as well as the Morning
Star, and in both respects is useful to the World.

XVII. The Morning Star, tho it may be obscured by Mists, Fogs, Clouds, and
dark Vapors; yet nothing can hinder its Course, but it constantly keeps its
Motion and Circle in the Heavens, cannot be prevailed against by any malignant
Power whatsoever. Thieves and evil Men like not its Appearance, yet cannot
obstruct its Motion in the Firmament, nor stop its Light from shining on the
Earth.

XVIII. The Morning Star, as it has those Properties and Excellencies already
expressed; so lastly, it exceeds all other Stars for Brightness and Glory.

Parallel.
I. THe Lord Jesus is a very solid Light, whose Glory is not like others who
have their Intermissions; but he abides steady, his Glory and Bright-shining is
always alike, his whole course of Life was as if it had been but one continued
Act of Goodness; He is the same in the Morning, Noon and Night; Yesterday, to
day and for ever. Heb. 13.8.

II. Jesus Christ he is the Harbinger of the great Joy to all Nations. How
joyful was that time, when the Dayspring from on high did first visit us? The
People that sat in Darkness, saw great Light, and to those that dwell in the
Valleys of the shadow of Death, great Light is risen, etc. His coming was the
fulfilling of God's gracious Promise unto the Fathers, and as the blessed
manifestation of God's rich Favor and good Will to Man; he is also the
Forerunner or the Harbinger of that Dominion that the Just shall have in the
Resurrection, the morning of the longed-for Day. The path of the Just is as a
shining Light, that shines more and more to the perfect day. Prove. 4.18. The
upright shall have Dominion over them in the Morning. The Night is far spent,
Psalm. Romans 13.11, 12.
the Day is at hand. This (above all others) is the day that the Lord has made
(for good Men) therein to rejoice and be glad. Psalm. 118.24.

III. Jesus Christ is not only an Ornament to the Christian Church and
Profession, far beyond what Moses was to the Jews; but even to Heaven it self,
and the Holy Angels, who did not a little rejoice at his ascending into Heaven.
God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a Trumpet; sing Praises
to our God, sing Praises. Psalm. 47.5.

IV. Jesus Christ is a very pleasant Object to Men that are spiritually
enlightened; therefore it is that they do ardently desire to be near him, and
with him where he is. David, tho he had not so clear a sight and prospect of
this bright and morning Star, as Men have under the Gospel; yet that prospect
he had, made him use this pious Prayer; O when shall I come and appear before
God! Psalm. 42.2. Then shall I be satisfied when I awake with thy Likeness, etc.
Psalm. 17.15. I have a desire (says Paul) to depart and to be with Christ, etc.
Phil. 1.23. Those that look for him do also cry, Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.

V. Jesus Christ is highly esteemed by all that sail Heaven-wards, no steering
the right Course without him; He gives good Assurance to all that follow him,
they should not abide in Darkness, but have the Light of Life. The Following of
Christ Jesus is the most certain way to avoid the Rocks, the Sands, and the
Hands of all spiritual and temporal Enemies.

VI. Jesus Christ is really the most excellent and chiefest Light that ever God
set in the Church; Moses and the Prophets, John Baptist, and the three Beloved
Apostles, Peter, James and John, and Paul who was most eminent, were shining
Lights and glorious Stars, who adorned the Profession of the Holy Gospel; but
in all things this Bright and Morning Star infinitely surpassed them in
Splendour and Brightness. Heb. 1.3.


VII. Jesus Christ is a great Terror not only to wicked Men, but wicked Angels,
to all that love Darkness more than Light, they hate him and fear him, they
consulted against him, and more times than once attempted to pluck this Star
out of the Firmament, that so they might walk in Darkness, carry on their black
Designs and Deeds without discovery. Satan attempted his Destruction from the
Pinnacle of the Temple, sets a Squadron of the black Regiment to resolve upon
his Death, Mat. 4.5.
knowing him to be the Forerunner of the Day, which Thieves and Robbers cannot
endure; Come, let us kill the Heir, Mat. 21.38
etc. They hate the Light, come not to it, lest their Deeds should be reproved.
They led him to the Brow of the Hill, that they might cast him down headlong.
Luke 4.29. The evil Angels thought he came too soon, Why art thou come to
torment us before the time? Mat. 8.29.


VIII. Jesus Christ is constant in his Orb or Station, he is a Priest for ever,
a Prophet to guide for ever, a King to govern for ever; he leaves not his
Office as inconstant Men do, but makes good his Word as settled in Heaven. And
lo I am with you always, to the end of the World. Mat. 28.20. Heb. 13 5.
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee; or leave thee to a forsaking.

IX. Jesus gave a great Light unto the World by the Ministry of John, by the
Appearance of himself, and by the Ministry of the Apostles and their immediate
Successors. But the greatest Light is reserved to the flying of the Angel
through the midst of Heaven with the everlasting Gospel, before the great and
notable Day come, wherein the whole Earth shall be lightened with his Glory,
both Jews and Gentiles shall acknowledge the Blessed Messiah. Arise and shine,
for thy Light is come, the Glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. The Gentiles
shall come to thy Light, and Kings to the Brightness of thy rising. Isa. 60.1,
3. The Earth shall be filled with the Knowledge of the Glory of the Lord, as the
Waters cover the Sea. Hab. 214.

X. Jesus does send forth very blessed and sweet Influences upon the Bodies and
Souls of Men that are under his gracious Rule and Dominion; it is he who sends
down the Holy Ghost. If I go away, I will send you another Comforter, the
Spirit of Truth, etc. Joh. 16.7, 8.

XI. Jesus Christ, tho all Power in Heaven and Earth be given unto him, by whom
Kings reign and Princes decree Judgment and Justice, Nobles rule, even all the
Judges of the Earth, Who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; yet his chief
Rule and Government is over the pleasant and delightful Plants, the Saints who
are on the Earth, the Excellent in whom is all his delight; it is they that hear
his Word, obey his Voice, and do his Will, etc. The hundred forty and four
Thousand are pleasant and delightful ones; Rev. 14.1, 4. Rev. 7.17.
(1.) The Father's Name is upon them; (2.) They are not defiled with Women;
(3.) They follow the Lamb whithersoever he g^^eth. These are governed by the
Lamb.

XII. Jesus Christ is the Master of all Moderation both for soft Words and
gentle Instructions, who by good Doctrine did so eminently qualify his
Followers, that he fitted them for every Season, when cast down, he comforted
them with good Words and Promises: Let not your hearts be troubled; ye believe
in God, believe also in me. If I go away, I will come again and receive you to
my self, that where I am, you may be also. Joh. 14.1, 3. When hot and fiery, he
cools and abates Choler. You know not what Spirit you are of. The Son of Man
came not to destroy Men's Lives, Mat. 11.28, 29.
but to save them. Love your Enemies. Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in
heart, and you shall find Rest for your Souls.

XIII. Jesus Christ is really the cause of all Beauty to the true Church, and
to all the Members thereof. 1. In respect of Imputed Righteousness, by which
they are justified. 2. In respect of Grace and Virtue, by which they are
adorned. 3. In respect of Good Life and Conversation, which arises from his
Spirit, Doctrine, and good Example. Act. 13.39.
By him all that believe are justified -- But the fruits of the Spirit are
Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness,
Temperance. Gal. 5.22. You are complete in him, who is the Head of all
Principalities and Powers.

XIV. Jesus Christ does greatest kindness in the Winter, or dark time of the
Church; then it is he makes Intercession, manifests Care, and sends Relief
and Succor to the Saints, performs all the parts of a merciful High Priest and
Mediator: but when the Winter is past, the darkness gone, and the night quite
spent, then his Office of Priesthood and Mediatorship shall cease; Then shall
the Son deliver up the Kingdom to the Father, and God shall be All in All. 1
Cor. 15.24.

XV. Jesus Christ has a very honorable Name, Jesus which is Savior, Phil.
2.9. Mat. 1.21. Acts 4.26. Joh. 6.59. Psalm. 4.5. 1 John 5.20. Act. 13.15. Rev.
1.5. 2 Timothy 1.10. Heb. 1.4.
Christ which is Anointed; The Son of God, the only begotten, well beloved; the
Emanuel, God with us; and he has a Name above every Name. Thou shall call his
Name Jesus, for he shall save his People from their Sins. The Rulers set
themselves against the Lord and his Anointed. And we believe thou art Christ
the Son of the Living God. God is gone up with a shout. This is the true God,
and Eternal Life; Lord of all, Lord of Glory, Prince of Life, Prince of Peace,
Prince of the Kings of the Earth. The Day Star from on high, that brings Life
and Immortality to light, by the Gospel. He has by Inheritance obtained a more
excellent Name than the Angels.

XVI. Jesus Christ is Omega as well as Alpha, the Finisher as well the as
Author or Beginner of our Faith; the Re^^egard, as well as the Captain of our
Salvation; gives the latter, as well as the first fruits of the Spirit; trains
as well as conducts; he rewards according to the Works of Piety and Goodness,
as well as he commands to do them; he concludes this day of Grace when he comes
to judge, as well as he began it when he came to save. He ushers in the dismal
night of Darkness to the wicked, as well as he ushers in the day of glad
Tidings and great Joy to the Righteous; He appears after the going down of the
Sun and shutting up of Mercy, as well as before the rising of the Sun, and
clear approach of Mercy; He is a Harbinger to Captivity, as well as to the year
of Jubilee and Deliverance; He sends down to Hell and Darkness, as well as as
sends up to Heaven and Glory. I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End.
Rev. 1.8. Heb. 12.2.
Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith.

XVII. Jesus Christ, and the Light of the Gospel, although sometimes obscured by
the means of misty foggy Clouds, Powers of Darkness, Ignorance, Unbelief and
Heresy; yet nothing can hinder his Course, but he constantly keeps his glorious
Circle in his Dispensation, and keeps a continual Motion in a way of Divine
Providence, until the time of his Kingdom and Patience is over. Heb. 10.37.
He that has promised to come, will come, and will not tarry. The Lord whom
you seek, Rev. 1.7.
will suddenly come to his Temple. Behold, I come quickly, and my Reward is
with me. He cannot be prevailed against by any malignant Powers of Earth or
Hell. Herod, Pontius Pilate, the High Priest, the whole body of the Jews, the
Romans, Mahomatans; and Papists that hate him and his glorious Appearance,
cannot obstruct his Motion and Operation in the Church or World, nor in
any-wise extinguish his Light from its glorious Splendour. Hereafter shall you
see the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven with Power and ^^reat Glory.
It Is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks. The Disciples waxed bold and
multiplied. Mat. 24.30 Act. 9.5.
The Blood of the Martyrs was the Seed of the Church. O Galilean! thou ^^a^^
overcome me, says wicked Julian. On this Rock will I build my Church, Mat.
16.18
and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. The Administration of
Christ is like the Path of the Just, that sh^^neth more and more to the perfect
day. Of his Kingdom there shall be no end, Isa. 9.7.
upon the Throne of David, to order and establish it with Judgment and with
Justice from henceforth, even for ever.

XVIII. Jesus Christ in all that has been or can be said, exceeds in
Brightness and Glory; for (as has been manifested) he is the Brightness of his
Father's Glory, in which respect he exceeds Angels and Men, for tho he was the
Offspring of David, yet he is the Bright and Morning Star. Rev. 22.16




METAPHOR.
I. The Morning Star did not make it self, nor other Stars.

II. The Sun, and Morning Star, are two things; for the Morning Star is much
inferior to the Sun in light and glory.

III. The Morning Star gives but external light to the corporal sense.

IV. The Morning Star gives light only in the night, but loses its glory when
the Sun arises.

V. The Morning Star gives Light only to the visible World.

VI. The Morning Star shall fall from Heaven, or be dissolved at the general
Conflagration of the World; the Heavens and the Earth that now is are reserved,
etc.

Disparity.
I. JEsus Christ the Bright and morning Star, made the Orbs wherein the Stars
are fixed, with the Sun, Moon and all the World besides. And thou Lord, in the
beginning did lay the Foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the Work
of thy Hands. Psalm. 102.25.


II. Jesus Christ thought it no Robbery to be equal with God. Phil. 2.6, 7.
And he is not only the bright and Morning Star, but also the Sun of
Righteousness, (see Sun.) the brightness of his Father's Glory, and the express
Image of his Person, Heb. 1.3.
and he upholds all things by the Word of his Power.

III. Jesus Christ gives internal light, which illuminates the Minds and Souls
of all Believers. This is the true Light, who is not only the Light of the
World, but delivers also all those that truly follow him out of darkness, and
bestows on them the Light of Life. Joh. 8.12.


IV. Jesus Christ gives light continually, and can never lose his Glory,
because a greater Light than he cannot arise; The night and the day are alike
to him. The Light shined in Darkness, and the Darkness comprehended it not.
Joh. 1.5. Isa. 60.20.
He is the Lord that is an everlasting Light.

V. Jesus Christ gives Light to the visible and celestial too, to this World,
and to the World to come, or heavenly Jerusalem, which City has no need of Sun
or Moon to shine in it, but the Lord God and the Lamb is the Light thereof. Ye
are come to Mount Zion, to God the Judge of all, Heb. 12.
and to Jesus the Mediator.

VI. Jesus shall never fall from Heaven, nor be dissolved, but abide and
continue when the Heavens shall be no more. And thou Lord, Psalm. 102.25, 26, 27.
have laid the Foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the Work of thine
own Hands: they shall wax old as does a Garment; and as a Vesture shall thou
shall fold them up, and they shall be changed; Heb. 13.8.
but thou art the same, and thy Years fail not; Jesus Christ the same,
yesterday, to day, Heb. 3.8.
and for ever.



Inferences.
I. WHat great Love does God bear? and what Care does he take of Believers? in
placing such a Star as Jesus Christ is, to be a Light unto them, to direct them
how to steer their Course in the darkest time, so as to miss all dangerous
Rocks and Sands, and to arrive in safety at the desired and longed-for Haven.

II. How safe are they that do always steer their Course by his Light, and
follow his Conduct? they shall not be at a loss in their Journeys or Voiages,
nor suffer Shipwrak by Rocks, Sands or Storms, but shall have the Light of
Life, Act. 16*32.
shall never perish. Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shall be saved.

III. This may show also the certainty of their perishing in the Dark and in
the Deep, that continue their Course to the end of their Voyage without the
Light and Guidance of this Bright and Morning Star. This is the Condemnation,
that Light is come into the World, and Men love Darkness rather than Light,
Joh. 3.12.
because their Deeds are evil.

VI. Hence all true Christians (that have experimentally enjoyed Inlightnings,
Refreshings, and Conduct by Jesus Christ, as the Bright and Morning Star) may
be stirred up and persuaded yet more and more to look unto Jesus, who is not
only the Author and Finisher of their Faith, but causes his Glorious Light to
shine upon their Path; by reason whereof, the nearer they approach to the end
of their joyful Journey or Race, the more and more will the Light shine unto
the perfect day. Prove. 4.18.
Take you heed therefore to that more sure word of Prophecy, as unto a Light
that shines in a dark place, until the Day dawn, and the Day Star arise in
your Hearts. 2 Pet. 1.19


V. Lastly, If Christ be the Bright and Morning Star; then let us look and wait
for the Day, which he is the forerunner of; seeing the Morning Star has
appeared and is up, be sure the Day is at hand, and a glorious Day it will be
to them who are ready and prepared for it.

The Coming of Christ compared to the Coming of a Thief in the Night.
1 Thessalonians. 5.2. But you your selves know perfectly, that the Day of the Lord so
comes, as a Thief in the Night.


THere are various Opinions concerning the Day of the Lord, or the Coming of
Christ, spoken of, Mat. 24. Luke 21. 2 Pet. 3.9, 10. and in this Text. But if
the Scope of the Text be but carefully considered, it will clearly appear, that
the Coming of Christ here spoken of, is his Coming at the last Day to Judgment,
when the Dead shall be raised. Read the latter part of the fourth Chapter, etc.

Why the Day of the Lord is compared to the Coming of a Thief in the Night,
will appear by the following Parallel.

Simile.
I. THe coming of a Thief in the Night, is with a design to circumvent an
unwatchful House, and to take his Prey.

II. A Thief comes provided for his purpose, with a resolution to fight, and
Instruments to make way to his Design, Keys to unlock Doors, Bars to break them
open, or the like.

III. A Thief comes at a Time when all is still, and People are least
thoughtful of Danger, but are careless, at ease, even asleep upon their Beds,
thinking themselves secure, till they are invaded, and their Goods taken away.

IV. The coming of a Thief into a House puts the careless Family into a great
Fright, when they see themselves surprised, and cannot tell how to help it.

V. The approach of a Thief in the Night, makes the poor amazed Family to
forget all their former Pleasures and Enjoyments, and expect no more than their
Lives for a Prey, and glad would they be of them too.

VI. At the coming of a Thief in the Night, Execution is oftentimes done, to
the Ruin of the People where he comes.

Parallel.
I. THe Coming of Christ, or Day of the Lord, will be with design to circumvent
the careless Professors, who sleep in a sinful secure State, as if there was no
God to fear, no Jesus Christ to look for, no Heaven to be sought, no Hell to be
avoided; to such he will come, and seize them for his Prey, to cut them
asunder, and appoint them their Portion with Unbelievers and Reprobates.

II. Even so will the Lord Jesus Christ, at his second coming, be provided for
his purpose, with Fire and Sword to accomplish his Design, which is to make a
Desolation in the Earth: For by Fire and Sword shall the Lord plead with all
Flesh, and the slain of the Lord shall be many. He shall be revealed from
Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in Flames of Fire, 2 Thessalonians. 1* 7, 8.
etc.

III. The Day of the Lord will come, when all is still, and the World least
thoughtful of Danger, but are careless, eating, and drinking, and marrying, and
sleeping, till the Heavens rend asunder, the Archangel utter his Voice, and the
Judge himself come upon them: Mat. 24.37
But as the Days of Noah were, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.

IV. The Day of the Lord will in like manner put the sleepy Generation (that
shall then be) into a great and dismal Fright, when they see themselves on a
sudden surprised, but know no way of Escape: Men startled, Women quaking,
Beasts crying, but none to help them. Then they will say to the Rocks and
Mountains, Fall on us, and hide us from the Face of him that sits on the
Throne, Rev. 6.16, 17.
and from the Wrath of the Lamb; for the great Day of his Wrath is come, and
who shall be able to stand?

V. The coming of the Day of the Lord will make the World much amazed, and
forget all their former Pleaurses and Enjoyments, as if they had never been,
and would gladly accept of their Lives for a Prey, or to be extinguished, or
cease to be; but alas! it is in vain, nothing but Hell and eternal Burnings
remain for them, where they shall be always dying, yet never dead.

VI. By the coming of the Day of the Lord, there will be such Execution done,
as will be to the utter Ruin and Un-doing of wicked Men, who shall be stripped
of all they have formerly set their Hearts upon, and would now give the whole
World, were it in their possession, for so much Grace as would help them to
Heaven, Mat. 25.8.
and save them from the dreadful Judgment.



Simile.
I. A Thief comes with a wicked Intent, to gratify his wicked Will
unrighteously.

II. A Thief's coming may be prevented.

III. The coming of a Thief is but to a few, and the Damage he does is but to
a few Families.

Disparity.
I. THe Lord comes with a good intent, to fulfill his Father's Will, to save
his People from all their Troubles, and to render Justice to God's Enemies.

II. But the coming of the Day of the Lord cannot be prevented: 2 Pet. 3.10.
The Day of the Lord will come, in which, etc.

III. The coming of the Day of the Lord, and the dismal Effects of it, will be
to all the Wicked: The Lord comes with Ten Thousand of his Saints, Jude v.14,
15.
to execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly, etc.



Inferences.
1. REproof, 2. Caution, 3. Exhortation.

1. Reproof to ungodly Men; that there should be such a Day to come, and notice
given of such a thing, and they so heedless and careless about it.

2. Caution to the Godly, to take heed, and carefully mind the Counsel of
Christ, Mark 13.35, 36, 37. Luke 21.34 36.
and Warnings of his Servants, unto such a due Watchfulness, as may prevent the
Danger of being found sleeping, and so the Day come upon them at unawares.

3. Exhortation to all, both good and bad, to make ready; for only they that
shall be found ready will go in with him into the Marriage-Chamber; Mat. 25.20
and 24.44.
the Door will be shut against all others, whether Professors or Profane: Be
ye therefore ready, for at an Hour you think not of the Son of Man comes.

Christ the Judge of All.
Acts 10.42. And be commanded us to preach unto the People, and to testify,
that it was He which was ordained of God, to be the Judge of Quick and Dead.


THe Term (...), a Judge, is derived of (...), to judge, which word has various
Significations. See Lieghs Crit. Sacr. on the Word.
And tho the word [ Judg] is not brought here as a Metaphor, Christ being
really and properly a Judge; yet it being a Phrase alluding to earthly Judges,
we shall (for Edification sake) run the Parallel, wherein are amply set forth
the Qualifications and Properties, as well as the Authority of a temporal Judge,
with the correspondent Analogy and Disparity, when applied to Christ, the Judge
of ((...)) the Living and the Dead.

METAPHOR.
I. A Judge necessarily supposes a People under a Law to be judged by; for there
can be no Action where there is no Object, nor any Exercise of Power, or
Judicial Proceeding, without a Subject.

II. A Judge is, or ought to be a Person fit for the Place and Office whereto he
is called.

1. A Judge ought to be a Man of great Wisdom and Prudence.

2. A Judge is a Man of Knowledge; it is necessary that he should be well
acquainted with all the Laws of his Sovereign.

3. A Judge is, or ought to be, a Man of Goodness, not subject to Anger, Malice,
or Revenge; and it is very requisite it should be so, otherwise great Damage
might ensue, upon the ill disposition of the Judge.

4. A Judge is, or ought to be, a Man of Justice and Impartiality, that will not
respect Persons in Judgment, take Bribes, or know the Faces of any, tho never
so great among Men. Aaron was not to know his Father nor Mother in Judgment.

5. A good and upright Judge is a Man of Courage and Boldness, will not say to
the Wicked, Thou art righteous; nor excuse the Faults of great Men through fear.

III. The Place and Work of a Judge is grounded upon good Reason: 1. The Honor
of the Sovereign. 2. The Reasonableness of Sovereignty or Authority. 3. The
Justness of the Laws. 4. In respect of the Subject.

IV. A Judge is appointed to his Place and Office; he acts not of himself, but
by Commission.

V. A Judge has his set Time or Days limited, wherein to keep a general
Sessions, or hold a solemn Assize, for the Honor of his Sovereign Lord the
King.

VI. A Judge, when he has received his Commission, and the set Day is come,
has power to summon all Parties concerned, and order all Offenders to appear
before him in Judgment.

VII. A Judge, after this great Appearance upon his Summons, enters upon his
Work, which consists chiefly in three great Points: 1. To open the Law. 2. To
examine Witnesses. 3. To arraign the Offenders.


VIII. A Judge charges Matter of Fact in Judgment, and proceeds to clear Proof
and Evidence, by a sufficient Number of proper Witnesses touching the same.

IX. A Judge, by this Order and Method of Proceeding, keeps up the Honor of the
Law, which he makes his Rule in all his Acts of Judgment.

X. A Judge is very terrible upon the Seat of Judgment, in three respects: 1. He
is clothed with Majesty. 2. He has very great Attendants; as the Sheriffs,
Justices of the Peace, and the Gentry of the County about him. 3. He passes a
solemn and fatal Sentence upon guilty Criminals.

XI. A Judge has the Command of Officers to see Sentence executed and
pronounced, as Sheriffs, deputy Sheriffs, with Keepers of Prisons, and the like.

Parallel.
I. CHrist being called a Judge, does clearly hold forth, that there are a
People to be judged by him; Mat. 25 32 2 Cor. 5.10. Rev. 20.12, 13.
Before him shall be gathered all Nations. We must all appear before the
Judgment Seat of Christ. I saw the Dead, both small and great, stand before God.

II. Jesus Christ infinitely excells all other Judges in respect of Fitness to
this Office, or Excellency of Qualifications, as will appear by what follows.

1. Christ is wise, not only far beyond David and Solomon, but all the Angels
in Heaven; the Learned amongst the Jews admired his Wisdom: He is called (as
has been often hinted) the Wisdom of God. 1 Cor. 1.24.


2. Jesus Christ fully knows all Divine Laws, as well that which is written in
the Heart of Man, as that which was written in Tables of Stone; and then as to
the Law of the Gospel, that is called the Law of Christ, Mat. chap. 5, 6, 7.
because he gave forth all the Precepts contained there^^^

2. The Lord Jesus Christ is full of Goodness, full Proofs of which he gave
before his advancement to his Dignity. He is not forward to accuse, is free
from Anger, not subject to take advantage by the Weakness of an Offender, but
ready to pity and forgive, if the Circumstances of the Cause will bear it: An
Instance of which we have in what Christ said to the Woman taken in Adultery:
He that is without Sin, let him cast the first Stone, etc. Joh. 8.7.


4. The Lord Christ is a Man of Justice, that will not be flattered with fair
Words. His Impartiality appeared in the days of his Flesh. He told Nicodemus, a
great Ruler, that he must be born again; Joh. 3.3.
called Herod the King a Fox. He told the Rulers of the Jews, Mat. 26 64
that they should hereafter see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of
Power and Glory; that is, as a Judge, to arraign them for their Injustice,
Cruelty, etc

5. The Lord Jesus, tho he be a Lamb for Meekness, and a Dove for Innocence,
yet he is a Lion for Bold^^ess and Courage, and in his time will show himself
so to be to all the Ungodly of the Earth, whether Kings, Captains, or mighty
Men: They shall cry to the Rocks to fall upon them, and Mountains to cover
them, to hide them from the Face of him that sits upon the Throne, Rev 6.16*
^^7.
and from the Wrath of the Lamb.

III. The Work assigned to the Lord Jesus, as a Judge, is grounded upon the
highest Reason: 1. The Authority of God the Father, who has committed all
Judgment into the hands of the Son. 2. The Reasonableness of his Authority: He
gave to all their Being, and therefore may challenge a Right more than earthly
Sovereigns, to sit as Judge over them. 3. The Equity of his Laws, which are
holy, just, and good; there is nothing amiss, Romans 7.12
no fault can be found in them. 4. In respect of his Subjects: God is not
unrighteous, to forget their Work of Faith, and Labor of Love, etc. of the
Godly: And it is a righteous thing with him to recompense the Ungodly according
to their Deeds: He shall render unto every Man, according as their Works shall
be. Rev. 22.1^^


IV. The Lord Jesus Christ is appointed to take the Place and Office of a Judge;
He acts not of himself, but by Commission from the great and mighty Potentate
of the whole Universe. God judges no Man, Joh. 5.22.
but has committed all Judgment to the Son. It Is he that is ordained of God to
be the Judge of the Quick and Dead. He has appointed a Day, in which he will
judge the World in Righteousness, Act. 13.31. Heb. 9.27.
by that Man whom he has ordained. It is appointed unto Men once to die, and
after Death the Judgment, to which end Christ shall appear the second time.

V. In like manner is there a set Time, a certain Day limited, for the Lord
Jesus, the great Judge, to keep a general Sessions, and hold a solemn Assize,
for the Honor of the eternal God, called the Day of Judgment. It shall be more
tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment, than for that City.
Mat. 10.15


VI. The Lord Jesus, as Supreme Judge, by virtue of his Authority and
Commission, when the set Time is come, will summon the whole World, even all
Offenders, to appear before his Judgment Seat: The Time is coming, when all
that are in their Graves shall hear his Voice, Joh. 5.28.
and come forth. The Trumpet shall sound, and the Dead shall be raised
incorruptible. 1 Cor. 15. Act 24.15 2 Cor. 5.10.
There shall be a Resurrection from the Dead, both of the Just and Unjust. The
Lord shall descend from Heaven, with a Shout, with the Voice of the Archangel,
and the Trump of God, and the Dead in Christ shall rise first. We must all
appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, etc.

VII. The Lord Christ, immediately after Summons, upon this great Appearance
before his dread Tribunal, enters upon his last and great Work. First, to open
the three great Law Books, Rev. 20.12
that Men have lived under, viz. 1. The Law of Nature, 2. The Law of Moses, 3.
The Gospel-Law. The Judge being set, the Books are opened; next in Order the
Witnesses appear, and first those that gave the Laws; and they are of three
sorts: 1. God, that wrote the Law of Nature after an invisible manner on the
Hearts of Men: I will come near you to Judgment, and be a swift Witness against
you, says the Lord. 2. Moses, that delivered the Law to Israel: There is one
that accuses you, Mal. 3.5. Joh. 5.45.
even Moses, in whom you trust. 3. The Apostles, that published the Gospel-Law,
not to Jews only, but to the Gentile World: These will appear not only to judge
the twelve Tribes of Israel, but the Gentiles, whose Persons and Works also
must be tried by Christ, as well as the Jews: He shall judge the Secrets of all
Men. Romans 2.16


VIII. Jesus Christ will judge the World, viz. all Men, both Jews and Gentiles,
according to their Works: God shall bring every Work into Judgment, Eccles. 12.
ult.
with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. The
Necessity of which appears in these four Cases: 1. The Scripture will not else
be fulfilled, and made good, which does fully assert the bringing to Light the
hidden things of Darkness, and making manifest the Counsels of the Heart. 2.
The Ungodly will not otherwise be convinced of all their ungodly Deeds, Jude 15.
and all their hard Speeches, which ungodly Sinners have spoken against the
Lord. 3. The Judgment will not otherwise appear just, upon which the Glory of
the Judge does so much depend: It Is for his Glory, to overcome when he judges.

And unless Matter of Fact be charged, due Proportions will not be weighed out
and awarded according to Desert, with clearness and satisfaction, either in a
way of Mercy or just Severity, to all Spectators. Therefore the Gentiles shall
be charged with Matter of Fact against the Law of Nature: Wh^^remongers and
Adulterers God will judge. Heb. 13.4.
The Jews shall be charged for rejecting Moses, and killing the Prophets. The
Jews and Gentiles jointly, that they have neglected Faith and Charity, Mat.
25.41, 42. Romans 2.16
under the Vouchsafement of the Gospel: He shall judge the Secrets of Men by
Christ Jesus, according to my Gospel.

The forementioned Witnesses are sufficient to prove Matter of Fact, both in
point of Number and Capacity. The first and chief Witness will be God himself,
who knew all things, and there can be nothing hid from him. The second Witness
will be Conscience, which was and is with Men in all Places and Actions, which
Man could never leave at home, nor shun his Company, when he went out, or when
he came in. Romans 2.15
He is with him in his most secret Retirements, and has often told him, that
there was one above (even God) that sees all things.

Besides these two Witnesses that are of such mighty Credit, there may be three
more added, namely, 1. The good Angels, which are much busied in this World to
watch Men, and inspect their Ways. 2. The evil Angels, who are never out of
Men's Company, and have voluntarily of their own accord been Accusers of the
Brethren, who will give Testimony at the Bar of Christ against their own
Proselites, if God calls for it. 3. The ordinary Companions of Transgressors,
with whom Counsel was held about evil Projects, Designs, and Actions of Murder,
Theft, Drunkenness, and Adultery, whose Tongues shall (no doubt) be as ready to
accuse their Comrades, as to confess their own Faults, concerning whom we are
informed, that not only every Knee shall bow, but every Tongue shall confess,
etc.

IX. Jesus Christ will magnify the Law, and make it honorable, in that the
Word or Law spoken by Angels, by Moses, by Himself, and his holy Apostles,
shall be the Rule of Judgment at the last Day.

X. Jesus Christ, the high and great Judge of Heaven and Earth, at the end of
the World, on his Judgment Seat, will be very terrible in three respects. 1. He
is set forth as being clothed with Majesty, as Judges are with their
Scarlet-Robes: Red in his Apparel, clothed with a Garment down to his Foot,
Isa. 63 2. Rev. 1 13, 14.
girt about the Paps with a Golden Girdle; his Hair like Wool, as white as
Snow; his Eyes like a Flame of Fire, and his Feet like fine Brass, as if it
burned in a Furnace; his Countenance as the Sun shining in its Strength; and
his Voice like the Roaring of a Lion, the Noise of Thunder, or the Sound of
many Waters. 2. He will have great Attendance, even all the Angels in Heaven:
Ma^^. 25.31
When the Son of Man shall come, and all the holy Angels with him, he shall sit
upon the Throne of his Glory. All the Saints that ever were in the World since
the beginning thereof, shall sit upon the Throne with him: The Lord my God
shall come, and all the Saints with him. Zech. 14.
Know you not that the Saints shall judge the World? 3. He will pass a most
solemn and fatal Sentence upon the Ungodly: They shall not stand in this
Judgment, Psalm. 1.5.
nor Sinners in the Congregation of the Righteous. The Sentence will be, Depart
from me, ye workers of Iniquity, I know you not. Go ye cursed into everlasting
Fire, Mat. 5. from 41, to the end.
prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Which with the Consequences of it, and
Reasons assigned, you have at large Mat. 25. O the sad Shreeks, the hideous
Noises, the woeful and lamentable Out-crys, from high and low, that will attend
this solemn Sentence! which no Tongue of Man is able to express.

XI. So Jesus Christ the Universal and Supreme Judge, has the full Command of
all the good and elect Angels, who attend the Court at the great Assizes, to
see that no Resistance nor Escape be made, but that Sentence be fully executed
upon all the treasonable, black, rebellious and condemned Crew; Take and bind
them hand and foot, and it follows, These shall go away into everlasting
Punishment. Mat. 25.4^^




Inferences.
IF there be a Judge, a Time, a Place, and work of Judgment, we do infer these
three things.

I. What great need Unbelievers, Rebels, Traitors, and all Offenders have of
Pardon, there being nothing else will stand them in stead when they appear
before the great Judge, where there will be no pleading, not guilty, because of
full Evidence as to matter of Fact; no pleading Ignorance, because a known and
established Law is broke; No benefit of Petitions, because the King is gone off
the Mercy-Seat. No relying upon the wrong Verdict of Corrupt Jurors, because no
such Persons will be found there to afford help. Nothing avails with the Judge
in this Judgment-Day, but a white Stone, a Wedding Garment, the spotless
Righteousness of Jesus Christ: Mat. 22.1^^
all who want this Robe will in that day be speechless.

II. How sad will it fare with all those that go out of this World without
Faith in the Son of God, without the Pardon of their Sins! Woe unto such in that
day that ever they were born. Look to it all you Unbelievers, Swearers,
Whoremongers Persecutors, Liars, Sabbath Breakers, lovers of Pleasures more
than lovers of God, Covetous Persons, Proud Persons, Thieves, Drunkards, and
Backsliders, 1 Cor. 6.9, 10.
what will you do in that day? as sure as God lives you will be all condemned
(unless you repent and believe in Christ) to the Lake that burns with Fire
and Brimstone. Luke 13.3, 5
What will you do in this day of Visitation? who shall plead for you, now you
have lost the prevailing Advocate? Where will Sinners and ungodly Ones appear?
Rev. 21.8.
how will you be able to look the Judge in the Face? How can you escape this
Judgment, that have neglected so great Salvation? How can you escape the
Damnation of Hell, that have no Christ, Heb. 2.3.
no Faith, no Pardon?

III. But thrice happy are they who appear before this great and mighty, this
high and terrible Judge, with a white Stone, with a Wedding Robe, with a Pardon
under Hand and Seal.

1. The Law is silent, being fully answered.

2. The Judge smiles, and takes Knowledge of them as the Favorites of Heaven,
Well done, good and faithful Servant, etc. Come ye blessed of my Father, Mat.
25 34
enter into the Joy of your Lord. -- Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, etc.

3. The Witnesses are freed from Trouble, and excused from giving Testimony
against them, because Guilt was owned, the Fact was confessed, a self Judgment
passed, and the King's Pardon obtained, through the Redemption that is in
Christ's Blood. Romans 3.25. c. 8.33, 34.
Now if God be for us, who can be against us? If God justifies, who shall
condemn? who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? Who shall
condemn if Christ has died, shed his Blood, and sent his Spirit to seal that
Pardon; God the chief Witness is pleased, Conscience is purged, Peace being
there, his Power to accuse is gone, the inward Thoughts are for excusing
altogether. What remains now but Liberty proclaimed? There is no Condemnation
to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the
Spirit. Romans 8.1. And the Joyous Jubilee sounded forth; Lo, this is our God, we
have waited for him, the Lord is our Lawgiver, our Judge, our King; He is come
to save us, we will be glad and rejoice in his Salvation. He is come to be
glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe; Sing Praises to
our God, sing Praises to our King, sing Praises to our Judge, sing Praises.
Glory be to God, and to the Lamb, to the King and to the Judge for ever and for
ever, World without end, Amen.

Christ compared to the Brazen Serpent.
Joh. 3.14, 15. As Moses lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness; even so must
the Son of Man be lifted up: that whosoever believes in him should not perish,
but have Everlasting Life.


Type.
THe People were stung with fiery Serpents, and thereby mortally wounded.

II. Neither Moses, nor the Law, could cure the People that were stung with
those fiery Serpents, but the Brazen Serpent.

III. The Serpent of Brass was to be lifted upon a Pole.

IV. After many People died that were stung, the Brazen Serpent was appointed
to be lifted up, as an Ordinance of healing.

V. A Serpent wounded, and a Serpent healed. The first that wounded had Poison
in him; but the second, tho called a Serpent, it was without Poison or Sting:
it had the Similitude of a Serpent, but had no Venom.

VI. The Brazen Serpent was not forged by Man's Hand or Hammer, but in a Mould
in the Fire.

VII. It was made of Brass and not of Gold; which Metal besides that it is of a
fiery Color, and so might resemble the color of the Serpent, it is also strong
and durable. Is my Strength (says Job) the Strength of Stones, or, is my Flesh
of Brass?

VIII. They that looked up unto the Brazen Serpent tho never so greivously
wounded or stung, yet were healed and saved from Death.

IX. They who looked upon their Sores to and grievous Wounds, and not the sign
that was erected by God's Appointment, died, notwithstanding the Serpent of
Brass.

X. If they sought to Chirurgeans or Physicians, or used any Salves or
Medicines of their own, or others, yet they perished.

XI. The Brazen-Serpent was an unlikely thing or way to Human Reason, to heal
such deadly Wounds.

XII. He that had a weak Eye or Eyes, and yet looked up to the Brazen-Serpent,
was cured.

XIII. It was a wonderful means of Cure, and undeservedly appointed by God, of
his mere Pity, against the Merit of those Murmurers.

Parallel.
SInners are stung with Sin, Romans 3.13. See more where Sin is compared to a
Serpent.
that is like the sting of a Serpent; The poison of Asps is under their tongue.
Sin wounds the Soul; My Wounds stink, and are corrupt.

II. So neither the Law nor Levite, nor any Creature could cure Mankind, nor
redeem them from the sting of Sin and Death but only Jesus Christ.

III. So Christ was lifted up upon the Cross, Joh. 12.34.
and is lifted up in the Ministry of the Word, and the Ordinances of the
Gospel, and thereby in the hearts of Believers.

IV. So after Mankind sinned, and was brought under Death, Christ came by the
appointment of God to die and be crucified, or lifted up upon the Cross, to heal
and recover us of our Wounds.

V. So (says Mr. Guild) as the first Adam lost Mankind, Meses unvailed p. 85.
the second Adam redeemed Mankind. The first had Sin and venomous Poison in him
by means of his harkening to the old Serpent; Heb. 7 26, 27.
the second, tho called a Sinner, and made to bear our Sins, A^^nsw.
and had the Similitude of of a sinful Man, but yet without Sin.

VI. So Christ was not begotten by Man, Guild.
but conceived by the Holy Ghost in the Womb of the Virgin.

VII. So was Christ sent not with outward Glory or worldly pompous Show, but
mean and humble in outward Appearance; Brass being strong, etc. in this
respect, it might figure out the Strength of Christ, Ainswer.
who is able by the power of the Godhead to endure and overcome all his
Tribulations.

VIII. So they who look up to Christ by a true Faith, tho never such great
Sinners, shall be healed and saved from eternal Death. By recovery of natural
Life^^ in the Israelites, was figured Eternal Life by Christ.

IX. So they who are bitten and grievously wounded with Sin, if they fix their
Eyes thereon and grieve and mourn in the sight of it, and do not look unto
Christ by believing, they despair and die eternally, notwithstanding the blessed
Savior.

X. So whosoever seek to any for help but Christ, or endeavor by their own
Works, or Reformation of Life, to have Peace with God; or trust to, and rely
upon the bare Mercy of God, considering his Justice; and do not come to Jesus
Christ, and look up to him as crucified, to satisfy for their Sins, are like to
perish for ever. Let the Men that talk of the Light within look to this.

XI. So Christ crucified is to the Jews, and many others in the World, an
unlikely way to save Men's Souls: 1 Cor. 1.22, 23.
We preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a Stumbling Block, and to the Greeks
Foolishness; but unto them that are called, Christ the Power of God, etc.

XII. So he that has but a weak Faith, yet looks up unto Christ, shall be
saved. We read of three Degrees of Faith in the Gospel, and yet the weakest
obtained Help and Cure from Christ. First, one comes to him, and says, Mark
5.28
If I can but touch the Hem of his Garment, I shall be whole. The second says,
Lord, if thou will, Luke 5.12.
thou can make me whole. The third said, If thou can do any thing, have
compassion on us, Mark 9.22
and help us. One would think the last had no Faith at all, it seemed so weak,
he questioned the Power of Christ. A weak Faith, if true, will justify and save
the Soul, as well as a strong Faith.

XIII. So is the Death of Christ to sinful and rebellious Mankind, an admirable
Work of unmerited Mercy, infinitely above what we deserved; it was not only
above, but against our Merits: God so loved the World, etc. Behold, Job. 3.16.
1 John 3.1.
what manner of Love is this! etc.



Type.
THe Brazen Serpent cured only the Wounds of the Body, and saved thereby only
from Temporal Death.

II. The Brazen-Serpent retained not always its Virtue to cure; also it was not
to be worshipped, it was gross Idolatry so to do; and when in the days of
Hezekiah it came to be that way abused, 1 King. 18.4.
it was destroyed, and broken in pieces.

Disparity.
CHrist cures all the Diseases and Wounds of the Soul, and thereby saves from
Eternal Death. See Physician.

II. Christ, the Antitype of the Brazen-Serpent, retains the like Virtue and
Efficacy to save that ever he had, ought to be worshipped, is the same
yesterday, to day, and for ever. Heb. 13.8.




Inferences.
THis shows not only the Necessity of a Savior, but also of Faith in him. None
were healed, but those that looked up to the Brazen Serpent; so no Man shall be
saved, but he that looks up by Faith to Jesus Christ.

1. Look up timely. 2. Look up daily, for Sin daily wounds thee. 3. Look up
with a fixed or single Eye.
Christ is All, and in All.
Col. 3.11. Where there is neither Greek, nor Jew, Circumcision, nor
Uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, Bond nor Free; but Christ is All, and in
All.


NOw to conclude with this second Head of Metaphors, Similies, Types, Parables,
and other borrowed Terms, concerning the Lord Jesus, I may well infer from the
whole of what has been said, That Christ is All, and in All. The Words are a
Proposition, in which you have, 1. The Subject, But Christ. 2. The Predicate,
He is All, and in All.


Christ is All in all things that are necessary to Salvation, and that to all
Persons that do believe on him. Christ is a Believer's All, and he esteems him
so to be: Not to exclude the Persons of the Father, and of the Holy Ghost; for
what Christ is as God, they all are, being but one and the same eternal Being:
So that he that honors the one, honors the other also; he that honors
the Son, honors the Father, and the Holy Ghost.

I. Christ is All in All in the First Creation, (though this I do not say is
directly intended in this place.)

1. He was before all things.

2. He is the Original of all Creatures, the Founder, or (to use the
Scripture Phrase) the Beginning of the Creation of God, Rev. 3.14. He made all
things, Heb. 1.2, 3
all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was
made.

3. He upholdeth all things by the Word of his Power, etc. Col. 1.16.
And by him all things do consist.

4. As he was before all the Original and first Former of all things, and as he
upholdeth them; so likewise for him all things are and were created.

5. He has the disposing of all things: By him Kings reign, Prove. 8. Mat.
28.18, 19.
and Princes decree Judgment. All Power is given to him in Heaven and Earth. He
has the Keys of Hell and Death. He sets up, and pulls down, kills and makes
alive at his Pleasure.

6. He is Heir of all things. He has universal Lordship over Angels, Saints,
wicked Men, and Devils. See Christ the Heir.

II. But more directly, Christ is All in All in the second Creation.

1. He is the Substance of all Shadows: Col. 2.17.
Which are Shadows of good things to come, but the Body is of Christ.

2. He is the Antitype of all Types, the All which Moses and the Prophets
pointed to.

3. He is all in all in Pacification, and Reconciliation of God to Man, and of
Man to God: He has abolished in his Flesh the Law of Commandments, contained
in Ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new Man, so making Peace.
Col. 1.19, 20. Ephesians. 2.15. 2 Cor. 5.21. Isa. 57*6. Jer. 33.16. Isa. 45.24.


4. Christ is all in all in Satisfaction, and Payment of our Debts: He was made
Sin for us, that knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in
him. The Lord has laid on him the Iniquities of us all.

5. Christ is all in all in Justification: He is the Lord our Righteousness. It
is in him all the Families of the Earth, and every believing Soul is justified:
In the Lord shall one say, have I Righteousness and Strength.

6. Christ is all in all in Election, he is the Root of it, the first of
Election, the Sum of our Election* we are chosen in him, for him, and given to
him: None shall be saved but such as are elected; but had it not been for
Christ, none had been elected; had not Christ been found as the Fruit of the
Wisdom of God, what would have signified Election, the Fruit of the Grace of
God?

7. Christ is all in all in Vocation; He it is that has called us, and that
makes that Calling effectual to us: Who has saved us, and called us, not
according to our Works, 1 Timothy 1.7
but according to his Purpose and Grace.

8. Christ is all in all in Sanctification: But of him are ye in Christ Jesus,
who of God is made unto us Wisdom, 1 Cor. 1.1
and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption. He has loved us, and
washed us from our Sins in his own Blood.

Rev. 1.5. Ephesians. 1.6.
9. Christ is all in all in Acceptance: He has made us accepted in the Beloved.

10. Christ is all in all in respect of Salvation, he is the Author of
Salvation: I looked, and there was none to uphold, therefore mine own Arm
brought Salvation. He has no Partner or Competitor: His Name shall be called
JESUS, because he shall save his People from their Sins: Neither is there
Salvation in any other.

Acts 4.12.
11. He is all in all in Conversion. (1.) It is he that shows the Soul the Need
and Necessity of it. (2.) He it is that quickneth us: You has he quickened, who
were dead in Trespasses and Sins. Ephesians. 2.1.
(3.) He it is that has begotten us by his Word and Spirit, and has given a
new Heart to us, and has planted a new Principle of Life in us.

12. He is all in all in the Pardon of Sin. (1.) He purchased Pardon for us.
(2.) He gives us a broken Heart in order to it, and a Heart to ask it, and a
Hand to receive it. (3.) Pardon is given for his Name's sake.

13. Christ is all in all in every Grace. (1.) He gives Faith: To you it is
given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer
for his sake. (2.) It Is he that has shed abroad the Love of God in our Hearts,
Phil. 1.29. Romans 5.3, 6. Joh. 1.16. Heb. 12 2.
by the Holy Ghost. All Grace is treasured up in him: Of his Fullness have we
all received, and Grace for Grace. He is the Author, Increaser, and Finisher of
our Faith, and all other Graces in us.

14. Christ is all in all in the Ministry of the Word. (1.) It Is Christ that is
preached: We preach Christ crucified. (2.) It Is Christ that gives Grace and
Gifts to preach: 1 Cor. 1. Ephesians. 3.8.
To me is this Grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the
unsearchable Riches of Christ. (3.) It Is he that ordains and appoints Men to
this Work, and puts all true Preachers into the Ministry. (4.) It Is he that
opens the Mouth to speak, and the Ear and Heart to hear and receive the Word.
Take Christ away, and what Gospel can be preached? etc. What is Paul? and what
is Apollo? I am nothing. Gospel Ministry, and Ministers are nothing without
Christ. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, 1 Cor. 3.7
neither he that waters, but God that gives the Increase.

15. He is all in all in every Ordinance.

First; In Baptism. 1. This Ordinance shows forth Christ's Death. 2. It holds
forth his Burial: We are buried with Christ in Baptism. 3. It holds forth his
Resurrection, Romans 6.
take Christ away, and what signifies Baptism?

Secondly; In the Lord's Supper, Christ is all in all. 1. It holds forth, that
his Body was broken, and his Blood was shed. 2. It shows his Love to us, and
his Suffering for us.

Thirdly; In Prayer Christ is all in all. 1. We must ask in his Name. 2. By the
help of his Spirit. 3. It Is he that presents and makes our Prayers acceptable
to God. 4. What is Prayer, or any Duty Saints can perform, if they meet not
with him in it, and if it be not done to his Glory? An Ordinance without
Christ, is but as a Cabinet without a Jewel, or a Shell without the Kernel.

16. Again, Christ is (as one says) all from the Father, all to the Father,
and all with the Father.

(1.) All from the Father: I am come that ye might have Life, (Life here, and
Life hereafter, Joh. 10.10
) and that ye might have it more abundantly. The Life of Grace, and of Glory,
they are by Christ.

(2.) Christ is all to the Father: I am [the] Way, [the] Truth, and [the] Life.
Every Word here has its Article in the Greek: Joh. 14.6.
No Man comes to the Father, but by me. Christ is the Way wherein, the Truth
whereby, and the Life whereunto we walk: Christ is the Way without Error, the
Truth without Falsehood, and the Life without Death. Truth lies between Way and
Life, as if the Way to Life were through Truth.

(3.) Christ is all with the Father: I know thou hear me always. Christ has
God's Ear at all times. He is the Object of the Father's Delight: This is my
beloved Son, in whom I acquiesce; so the Greek: It is an emphatical Word, and
signifies an infinite Affection. (...) Mat. 3.17.


17. Christ is all in all in respect of Merit: He has merited all for us, and
conveys all to us. As we have all propter Christum, so we receive all we have
per Christum, through Christ. He is not only the Fountain, but the Medium or
Conduit-Pipe.

18. Christ is all in all, or the Sum of the whole Gospel; all the Good here,
or the promised Good we shall receive hereafter, is through him; he is
virtually every thing unto us, in every Condition. (1.) Art thou sick? Christ
is thy Physician, and thy Physic too. (2.) Art thou poor? Christ is thy
Riches. (3.) Art thou weary? Christ is thy Rest: I will give you Rest. (4.) Art
thou in Trouble? Mat. 11.28, 29.
Christ is thy Peace: This Man shall be our Peace, when the Assyrian comes into
our Land. (5.) Art thou a Stranger? He is thy Way, and the End of thy Journey.
(6.) Art thou despised and contemned by Men? Christ is thy Honor: To you that
believe he is precious; in the Greek, He is an Honor.

Quest. Who is he that makes Christ his All?

Answ. 1. He makes Christ his All, that owns him, believes in him, obeys,
worships, and adores him, as God over all, Romans ^^.5.

2. He that loves him above all.

3. He that denies himself of and forsakes all for Jesus Christ's sake, and
follows him.

4. He that aims at Christ, and exalts him in all he is, has, does, or
undergoeth: Yea, doubtless I account all things but Loss, for the excellency of
the Knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord, for whom I have suffered the Loss of all
things, Phil. 3.8. Gal. 2.20.
and do account them but Dung, that I may win Christ.

5. He makes Christ his all, that wholly lives by him, for him, and to him.

6. He makes Christ his all, who cannot be satisfied with any thing this World
affords, or can afford, without him.

7. The Man that makes Christ his all, will not take any of his Right and
Honor from him; he will not diminish his Glory, or ascribe that to the
Creature which belongs to Christ.

8. He that makes Christ his all, will not be contented in any Ordinance or
Duty, if he have not his influencing, quickening, and comforting Presence.

9. He makes Christ his all, who, when it comes in competition, will let all
go, even his own Life, before he will part with him.

10. He that makes Christ his all, likes and loves him in all: He loves not the
Saints chiefly because they are of his Opinion in every thing, but for that of
Christ he sees in them.

11. He makes Christ his all, that longs above all things to be like him, and
to have his Image implanted in his Heart.

Quest. Why does a true Christian make Christ his All?

1. Because he is God over all; it were a Sin thus to exalt him, were he not
God.

2. Because he has a Name given him above all, above every Name: Romans 9^^.
Phil. 2.9, 10.
At the Name of Jesus every Knee shall bow, etc.

3. Because Christ has suffered and done all those things for us, which we
should have done and suffered.

4. Because a Believer sees himself unable to do any thing without him.

5. Because he is made of God all in all things to them.

6. Because nothing is of any worth in a Saint's eye, without Christ.

7. Because in having Christ, he has all.

Application.
IS Christ all? then this reproves them that esteem of any thing here in this
World above him.

1. It reproves such as esteem the Pleasures, Honors, and Profits of the World
above him.

2. It reproves, and may eternally shame them that esteem of their Sins, and
base Hellish Lusts, more than him. Many will adventure the Loss of Christ,
rather than forego their evil Courses.

3. It reproves them that esteem and exalt Christ in some things only; he is
not all in all to them.

4. How then does it reprove them that make Christ nothing at all, who wholly
cast him away, and build their Hopes of Salvation upon another Foundation?

Secondly; Be advised from hence, whosoever thou art, to make Jesus Christ thy
All.

Motives.

1. Thou have nothing that will stand thee in any stead, till Christ be thy all.

2. If thou have not Christ to be thy all, thy Knowledge and Profession of him
will not prove to be worth any thing at last.

3. If thou have not Christ for thy all, when Death comes, what will become of
that thou have? Thou will then have nothing.

Quest. How shall a Person come to have Christ to be his All?

Answ. 1. He must let all his Sins (...)

2. He must let all Consultings with Flesh and Blood go.

3. He must let all his own Righteousness go, so as not to rest and depend upon
it for Salvation.

Thirdly; This affords much Comfort to the Godly.

1. Is Christ thy All? Thou have a great All; what can there be more? Thou
may say with Jacob, I have enough; the word is, all.

2. Thou can never lose thy All, because thou can not lose thy Christ.

3. Thou can never be undone, tho thou losest all thou have in this World for
Christ's sake, because to thee Christ is All, and in All.

THE Third HEAD OF Metaphors, Allegories, and Similes, With other borrowed
Terms, Respecting the HOLY SPIRIT, OR, THE Third Person of the Blessed Trinity.
The Holy Ghost a Comforter.
John 14.16. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.

Verse. 26. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in my Name, he shall teach you all things, etc.


THE Comforter, (...), o^^ the Advocate: He shall give you another Comforter.
The Word [ Paracle^^] in the Greek comes from a Word of a large Signification,
and consequently may be rendered Advoca^^e, Exhorter, or Comforter.

METAPHOR.
A Comforter implies one or more to be in Trouble and Dis^^ress, or attended
with Sorrow and Affliction: A Man that is not in any Trouble, stands not in
need of a Comforter.

II. It implies or holds forth, that those who are troubled, and in a sorrowful
condition, are capable of Relief and Succor.

III. Comforter is a Name or Appellation belonging to a Person, or a personal
Appellation.

IV. A choice and true Comforter takes care to come unto a Person he loves, at
the greatest time of need, when he is most cast down and discomforted. Thus the
Jews came to Mary, to comfort her, when they heard that her Brother Lazarus was
dead; and Job's Friends, when he was in the depth of Sorrow, came to comfort
him.

V. A Comforter imports a Person able and willing to comfort and relieve such
as are in a sorrowful, mournful, and afflicted condition.

VI. A faithful Comforter manifests much Love and Tenderness to his oppressed
and afflicted Friend; particularly, 1. In coming to him. 2. In supplying the
Want he sustains of those things he is deprived of.

VII. A wise Comforter uses many and weighty Arguments to infuse Comfort into a
distressed and disconsolate Soul: it is not enough to come and give a bare Visit
and look upon a Friend, but to take apt and suitable Words and Motives to do it.

VIII. A Comforter sympathizes with him he comes to visit, to comfort him in
his Grief and Trouble. Job's Friends lifted up their Voice, Job 2.12, 13.
and wept, and they rent every one his Mantle, and sprinkled Dust upon their
Heads: So they sat down with him upon the Ground seven days, and seven nights,
etc.

IX. A true Comforter will intercede to others, (to administer, support and
relief) in whose power it is to succor, as well as himself.

X. A true Comforter will search into a Persons State and Condition, to know
how it is with him, that thereby he may the better understand how to speak a
word of Comfort to him.

XI A Comforter sometimes is slighted, by the Person or Persons he comes to
visit, and administers Succor unto, and all his good and sweet Advice is not
regarded for a time.

XII. A Comforter many times keeps his Friends from utter despondency, and
wonderfully revives and consolates his Soul, and thereby makes Sighing and
Heaviness to fly away. Job 16.5.
The moving of my Lips should assuage your Grief, etc.

XIII. A faithful and true Comforter will not only give his distressed and
disconsolate Friend a Visit, but if he sees there is need of it, will make his
Abode, even stay with him many days; Job's Friends did so.

XIV. A good faithful Comforter is highly esteemed and greatly beloved by his
Friend, especially when the worth of him is known, or he is sensible of the
Profit and much good rejected by him.

XV. A faithful Comforter will deal plainly with his Friend, and not speak
Peace and Comfort when he knows there is not just and good reason so to do, but
will reprove sometimes also if he finds cause for it.

Parallel.
THe Saints and People of God are in this World attended with manifold
Troubles* Afflictions, and Sorrows: Many are the Afflictions of the Righteous;
for all the day long have I been plagued, Psalm. 73.14
and chastened every morning* Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall
weep and lament, Joh. 16.2^^
but the World shall rejoice; and ye shall be sorrowful, but your Sorrow shall
be turned into Joy.

II. The Disciples of Christ, tho they mourn here, or are in a sorrowful State,
upon many considerations, yet they are capable of Comfort, and fit Subjects of
it: They are not such as u^^terly refuse, or are una^^e to receive Relief and
Comfort. Such as have committed the unpardonable Sin, or are already in Hell,
are incapable of receiving true Peace and Comfort; but so it is not with God's
People: Whatever their State and Condition is, it admits of Relief, tho through
Satan's Temptations they are sometimes backward to take hold of it.

III. The holy Spirit is a Divine Person; he is placed in the same Rank and
Order, without any Note of Difference or Distinction, as to a distinct
Interest, in the Divine Nature, with the other Divine Persons: Mat. 28.19 Joh.
15.7.
Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost. There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Son,
and the Spirit; and these three are one. 2. He has also the Names proper to a
Divine Person only, for he is called God: Acts 5.3, 4
Why have thou lied unto the Holy Ghost? Thou have not lied unto Man, but unto
God. 3. He has personal Propertie^^ assigned him, viz. a Will, He divides to
every Man severally as he will; and an Understanding: The Spirit searches all
things, yea, the deep things of God. 4. He is voluntary Author of Divine
Properties; he of old cherished the Creation, he formed and garnished the
Heavens; he inspired, acted, and spoke in and by the Apostles. 5. The same
regard is to be had to him in Faith, Worship, and Obedience, as unto the
Persons of the Father and the Son; for our being baptized in his Name, is our
solemn Engagement to believe in him, yield obedience to him, and worship him,
as it puts the same Obligation upon us to the Father and Son.

IV. So the holy Spirit comes unto a gracious Person in the time of greatest
Need, when he is most dejected and discomforted, whether it be under
Temptation, Affliction, or Persecution, for Christ's sake. Hence the Apostle
says* When we came into Macedonia, 2 Cor. 7.7
our Flesh had no Rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were
Fightings, and within were Fears: Nevertheless, God that comfort those that
are cast down, comforted us, etc. I will not leave you comfortless, I will come
unto you. Jo^^.


V. The holy Spirit is able and willing at all times to comfort sincere
Christians in their Afflictions. Such is the Power, Ability, and Efficacy of
the Spirit upon this account, th^^t it is more c^^pable and able to comfort
Believers, than the bare bodily Presence of the Lord Jes^^ is able to do:
Nevertheless, I tell you the Truth, it is expedient for you that I go away,
Joh. 16.7.
pray mind the Reason our Savior gives of it: For if I go not, the Comforter
will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him.

VI. The holy Spirit does manifest much Love and Tenderness to Believers, which
appears, 1. In his coming to them that are poor and contemptible in the eyes of
the World. 2. By making up the Want of Christ's bodily Presence. 3. In bearing
Repulses from them; how often has the Spirit been slighted, and his Motions
rejected, instead of being friendly entertained, when in Love he comes to them.

VII. The Holy Spirit does not only come and give poor Believers a bare Visit
in their Distresses, but also uses fit and suitable ways and means to comfort
and support their Souls, He shall bring all things unto your Remembrance that I
have spoken unto you; Joh. 14.26
Joh. 16.^^5
He shall take of mine and shall sh^^w it unto you, and he shall show you
things to come* etc. The Spirit usually comfort Believers in and under their
Sorrows and Afflictions.

(1.) By showing them whatsoever Christ has done and suffered for them.

(2.) By opening and applying the gracious Promises of Christ unto them, he
shall bring whatsoever I have said to your Remembrance.

(3.) By sealing up Christ's Love unto them; As many as I love, I rebuke and
chasten. It Is no sign they are hated by Christ, or not in his Love and
Affection, that they are chastised and so often under this and the other
exercise of Affliction; and this the Spirit labors either by his Word, or
Ministers, and other ways to convince them of.

(4.) By showing from the Word that the like Afflictions, if not greater, many
of God's Children have met with before them, or are now under, knowing that the
same Afflictions are accomplished in your Brethren that are in the World; what
are thy Sorrows, says the Spirit, to those that holy Job and many of the
Blessed Martyrs met with?

(5.) By showing them the Design and gracious End of God in all his
Dispensations and Afflictions; he does it not simply for his own Pleasure as an
Act of Sovereignty, But for our Profit, that we might be partakers of his
Holiness. This is the fruit of all, Heb. 12.
the taking away of your Sins, it is for the trial of your Graces, says the
Spirit. Job 23.
When he has tried me, I shall come forth as Gold. It Is to convince the Devil
and wicked Men, that you are sincere and upright Ones, and do not follow Christ
for Loaves. Does Job (says Satan) fear God for naught. But put forth thine
hand now, Job 19.1^^
and touch all that he has, and he will curse thee to thy Face. God, says the
Spirit, has brought this and the other Trouble upon thee, to clear thy
Innocence, and to show that Satan is a Liar.

(6.) By showing them that all their Afflictions are but short lived, that they
will soon be over, they will last but for a Moment.

(7.) That they will add to their Advantage here and hereafter. Our light
Affliction which is but for a Moment, works for us a far more exceeding and
eternal weight of Glory. 2 Cor. 4.1^^
It Is, says the Spirit, to show forth the excellent nature of true Grace;
Faith, Love, and Patience never shine forth in their proper Luster and Glory,
until they come under exercise. The trial of your Faith is much more precious
than Gold that perishes, 1 Pet. 1.7.
tho it be tried with Fire. And it will hereby be found unto Praise, Honor and
Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

(8.) (...) ^^irit comfort Believers, by showing them that all their Sorrows
will in a little (...) be turned into Gladness. Now ye are sorrowful, but I
will see you again, and your Hear^^ shall rejoyee, and your Joy no Man takes
away from you. Ye shall be sorrowful, but you (...) shall be turned into Joy.
Those that go forth weeping, bearing precious Seed, shall doubtless come again
rejoicing, bringing their Sheaves with them. Isa. 61.2, 3*
God will give unto them (says the Spirit) that mourn in Zion, Beauty for
Ashes, the Oil of Joy for Mourning, the Garments of Praise for the Spirit of
Heavines^^, that they may be called Trees of Righteousness, the planting of the
Lord, that he ma^^ (...) glorified.

(9.) The Spirit comfort by showing Believers that all their Sorrows (...)
in this World, the wicked have all their sweet things here, and the godly have
their bitter things here; but as the wicked shall have nothing but bitter
hereafter, so the godly shall have nothing but sweet hereafter. Son, remember
that thou in thy life time, Luke 16.
receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things, but now he is
comforted, and thou art tormented.

(10.) The Spirit comfort by convincing Believers, that God does not punish
them as their Sins do deserve; He has visited thee little or nothing (says
Elibu) so the Word will bear it* The least Mercy is more than we deserve, He
has not dealt with us after our Sins, nor rewarded us according ^^o our
Iniquitie^^.

VIII. The holy Spirit sympathizes with every gracious Soul in their Distresses
and Troubles (according as God in his Word speaks to our Capacities,) In all
their Afflictions he was afflicted; his Soul was grieved for Israel. And in
that of the eighth Chapter to the Romans, the Spirit particularly is said to
sigh and groan after such a sort that cannot be uttered* Rom 8.26
and hence the Apostle exhorts the Saints not to grieve the holy Spirit of God,
Ephesians. 4.30.
whereby they are sealed to the day of Redemption.

IX. Likewise the holy Spirit also helps our Infirmities; Romans 8.26, 27.
for we know not what to pray for as we ought: But the Spirit it self makes
Intercession for us with Groans, which cannot be uttered. And he that searches
the Hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes
Intercession for the Saints, according to the Will of God. Romans 8.26, 27. Hence
the word Advocate or Comforter.

X. The holy Spirit searches the Heart and Reins of every Soul he comes to
comfort, Psalm. 239.23. Jer. 17.10. Romans 8.27.26. 1 Cor. 2.10.
to discover the State and Condition of a Person to him; David cries out, Search
me, O God, and know my Heart, etc. I the Lord search the Heart, etc. He that
searches the Heart, etc. The Spirit searches all things, etc.

XI. So the holy Spirit is sometimes slighted and grieved, Ephesians. 4.30.
through the Power of Temptation, by a Believer, and his sweet and heavenly
Advice is not minded, nor followed as it ought to be, but all Comfort is
rejected for a time, but afterward (tho sometimes long first,) the Soul with
Joy takes hold of it.

XII. The Holy Spirit keeps the Heart of a Believer from utter Despondency, and
greatly revives and consolates him; hence the Apostle says, 2 These. 2.16.
God has given us everlasting Consolation, and good hope through Grace; we are
troubled on every side, but not in Distress, 2 Cor. 4.8.
we are perplexed but not in despair. I have seen his ways and will heal him
also and restore Comforts to him, etc. Isa ^^7.18.


XIII. The holy Spirit knows there is an absolute necessity for him not only to
give the Saints a Visit and immediately be gone, but also to abide with them
always, for they cannot be without his glorious Presence one Moment: It Is true
sometimes they may be without his eminent comforting Presence, which causes the
Church to cry, Lam. 1.1^^.
the Comforter that should relieve my Soul is far from me, yet his supporting
Presence is ever with them. I will pray the Father, and he shall send you
another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of
Truth, etc. and he is said to dwell in us, and to make his Abode with us. But
if the Spirit of him that raised Jesus from the Dead, dwell in you, he that
raised up Christ from the Dead, shall also quicken your mortal Bodies by his
Spirit that dwells in you.

XIV. The Holy Spirit is exceedingly prized, and much beloved by every godly
Man, but more especially when they find by Experience the great Worth of him,
and the great Good and Profit they receive by his means.

XV. The Holy Spirit deals faithfully with every Man, he will not speak Peace
to any Person but to those to whom it does belong, nor at a time when the Soul
is fallen into any Sin, or under some great Temptation to sin, but will at such
times rather rebuke and reprove them. The Spirit is first, a Spirit of burning,
and then a Spirit of Consolation: the humble sincere and brokenhearted Ones he
comforts and revives.



METAPHOR.
ANother Comforter, tho wise and very compassionate, and every way capable to
speak Words to a disconsolate Person, yet finds sometimes the Condition of his
Friend to be such, that all he can say and do will not take place, nor
administer present Relief to him, but after all, remains very sad and
disconsolate.

II. Another Comforter many times misses the Case of a poor, afflicted Person,
and thereby cannot accomplish the Work; this did Job's Comforters, they mistook
his Case, whereby they proved miserable Comforters to him.

III. Other Comforters are many times wearied out, and leave their Friends in
the midst of their Sorrow.

IV. Another Comforter may be absent, nay, at a great distance when his poor
distressed Friend stands in most need of him; besides, he can visit but a few
Persons at one and the same time, and cannot be at above one Place at once.

V. Other Comforters can speak to the Ear, but scarce able to reach the Heart;
Spira had many words of Comfort spoke to his Ear, but they could not speak to
his Heart.

Disparity.
THe Holy Spirit sometimes finds gracious Persons very much disturbed and cast
down under heavy Pressures of Affliction, and that no other can comfort him;
yet when he comes to a Resolution to relieve, and refresh and comfort him, all
his Sorrow, Temptations and Disquietments fly away. Let a Saint be never so
sad, if the Spirit sees it is a fit time to speak Peace and Comfort to him, he
does it effectually. If he speak Peace, who can cause Sorrow? For I have
satiated the weary Soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful Soul. Jer.
31.25.

II. But the Holy Spirit never does, nor can mistake any Person's Condition.
Being God, he knows, and is the Searcher of the Heart; all things lie naked and
open to his Eyes. The Spirit searches all things, yea the deep things of God.

III. But the Holy Spirit cannot be wearied nor tired out. The Creator of the
Ends of the Earth faints not, there is no searching of his Understanding. Isa
40.28.


IV. But the Holy Ghost is omnipresent. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?
Psalm. 138* 7.
or, whither I shall fly from thy Presence? He is always near, and at hand, and
needs none to bring him News how it goes with any Person. Being the Omniscient
God, He can visit Thousands, and ten Thousands at one and the same time; is
every where, not circumscribed nor limited to Place.

V. The Spirit can speak to the Heart of a poor Sinner. I will (says God)
allure her, and bring her into the Wilderness, and speak comfortable Words unto
her. Hos. 2.4.
In the Hebrew, (...), loquar super Cor, or, ad Cor ejus, I will speak to her
Heart. In this the Holy Spirit infinitely excels all othe^^ Comforters, he can
in a moment cause all Sorrow to cease, by speaking to the Heart.



Inferences.
WE may infer from hence, the great Love of Christ to his own People, he will
not leave them comfortless, nor send one to them that is not able to speak
Peace, or administer true Comfort and Consolation to their Souls.

II. It should teach us in our trouble, to cry for the Holy Comforter to come
unto us.

III. It reproves such, who deny the Holy Ghost to be God, and a Divine Person*
this being an Appellation that properly belongs to a distinct Person.

IV. Let us take heed we never grieve the Holy Spirit, who is such a choice and
blessed Friend to us.

V. It may also caution every Soul against receiving Comfort, when God by the
Spirit speaks it not to then.

1. The Holy Spirit speaks not Comfort to any unconverted Soul, who love, and
live in their Sins, but rather Terror.

2. The Holy Spirit speaks not Comfort to carnal and loose Professors, and
Hypocrites in the Church, Mat. 25.3. Isa. 33.14.
that have Lamps and no Oil, the Name of Christ upon them, but not his Nature
in them; much Knowledge, but want Charity: Fearfulness will (says the Spirit)
surprise the Hypocrite.

3. The Spirit speaks no Comfort to an Apostate and Backslider in Heart and
Life; he tells them, They shall be filled with their own ways, and led aside
with the Workers of Iniquity. Psalm. 125.5


4. The Spirit speaks no Comfort to the moralized Person, who wholly rests upon
his own Righteousness, and sees no need of a Savior, nor of the Righteousness
of God, which is by Faith in Jesus Christ.

5. The Spirit speaks no Comfort to Persecutors and Murderers of the Godly, --
to cursed Plotters and Haters of the true Religion, and Lovers of Idolatry;
such that worship the Beast, and are Followers of the Romish Church, or
Upholders of the same: They (the Spirit says) shall drink of the Wrath of God,
and be tormented with Fire and Brimstone for ever and ever. Rev. 14.9, 10, 11.


But the Spirit speaks comfort to all true penitent ones; to such, who tho they
have been great Sinners, yet now loath themselves in a true and through sense
thereof, and forsake it.

1. To those who do believe and wholly rely upon Jesus Christ for Life and
Salvation.

2. To those who desire to be holy as well as happy, to have their Sins
mortified as well as pardoned, to be sanctified as well as saved, to live to
God here as well as to live with God hereafter.

3. To such who are universal in their obedience, that take up their Cross and
follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes.

4. To such that obey the Precepts of God, as well as believe the Promises.

5. In a word, To all sincere and upright ones.

Quest. How does the Spirit speak Comfort to the Souls of Men?

Answ. 1. Usually by bringing Christ's Word and Promises to their remembrance.

2. By using many Arguments, some of which I have hinted at already.

3. By his shining Influences, sweet and comfortable Operations upon the Soul.

4. By sealing up Christ's Love, and giving good hope and assurance of Eternal
Life unto them.

The Spirit compared to the Wind.
Cant. 4.16. Awake, O North Wind; and come, thou South, and blow upon my
Garden, etc.

Joh. 3.8. The Wind blows where it lists, and thou hear the Sound
thereof, but can not tell whence it comes, etc.

Acts 2.2. And sudddenly there came a Sound from Heaven, as of a rushing mighty
Wind, and it filled all the House where they were sitting, etc.


THe Hebrew Word (...), and the Greek, (...), (which comes from a Verb that
signifies to breath, or to blow) signifies sometimes Air, sometimes Wind, and
sometimes a Spirit. The several Metaphorical Notations of Wind may be read in
our Philologia Sacra, p. 116. to which we refer you. Sometimes it denotes
things that are vain, light, and empty; as Eccles. 5.16. Hos. 12.1. etc. In the
Texts cited, by an express Similitude it is compared to the Holy Spirit, as you
may see in the following Parallel.

METAPHOR.
THe Wind is invisible; no Man ever saw it, nor is the way of it known; it
passes the Skill of Man, Joh. 3.8.
to find out from whence it comes, and whither it goes.

II. The Wind blows at God's Command; He is said to hold the Wind in his Fist.

III. The Wind has a purging quality in it; it cleanses and purifieth the Air,
which otherwise would be hurtful and prejudicial to Man; it drives away those
ill Vapors and Stinks that arise from the Earth.

IV. The Wind has a cooling Property; how much do People in hot Countries
desire to have the Wind blow, to lay the Extremity of Heat?

V. The Wind has a clearing quality, dispersing Clouds, and causing Serenity,
expelling all Mists and Foggs which darken the Air.

VI. The South Wind, as Naturalists observe, is of a thawing quality, which
Experience oft-times shows to be true.

VII. The Wind is of a searching quality; it finds out the most hidden Places,
it passes through the most private Corners, and undiscernible Crannies.

See Pliny, lib. 2. cap. 19.
VIII. The Wind (Naturalists ob^^erve) has also a drying and ripening Property;
it dries up filthy and unclean Places, that are not passable, and helps to
ripen things for Harvest.

IX. The Motions of the Wind are various; sometimes it blows one way, and
sometimes another; when it blows on high in one part of the Kingdom, it is low,
or hardly blows at all in another part: Its several Motions also have various
Effects and Properties.

X. The Wind blows freely where it lists; we cannot command the Wind to blow
when* and how we would.

XI. The Wind blows and works sometimes powerfully, strongly, and
irresistibly; it has a mighty force in it, bearing down all that stands in its
way; it turns up the Cedars of Lebanon, rends the Mountains, and breaks Rocks
in pieces.

XII. The Winds many times by their blowing cause Rain, by dissolving the
Clouds.

XIII. Men observe or take good notice of the blowing of the Wind, and by
certain Signs, viz. by beholding the Clouds, Vanes, etc. they know which way it
blows.

XIV. The Wind, Naturalists observe, causes some Flowers to wither, and hang
down their Heads.

XV. The Wind, tho it be invisible, and cannot be seen, yet it may be heard,
and its Effects are seen, and its Influences evidently felt and experienced by
all.

XVI. The Wind cherishes, and causes Plants and Grass to grow and thrive; as
it is observed by some, that nothing will grow and thrive without it. It Is
thought, that the Roots of Things being moved by the Wind, it causes them to
root the more, making the Ground to give way unto them, by which means they
take the faster hold.

XVII. The Wind is useful for Navigation, to carry a Ship from one Port unto
another; for if the Wind does not blow, they are becalmed; nor can they sail at
all without it.

XVIII. The Wind is very profitable to fan or winnow Wheat, to sever the Chaff
or light Seed from the good Corn or Grain.

XIX. The Wind rises high, and blows powerfully; sometimes it rises on a
sudden, and at other times gradually.

XX. Naturalists tell us, that an Earthquake is occasioned by the Wind; See
Pliny; also Speculum Mundi, p. 173.
certain Exhalations (or Wind) being got into the Earth, shake it.

Parallel.
THe holy Spirit is invisible, and works invisibly; none of the Ways and
Operations thereof can be perceived or seen by mortal Eyes: Neither does the
natural Man understand the things of the Spirit, 1 Cor. 2.14.
nor can he. The Workings and Operations thereof are of a hidden and mysterious
Nature, hardly to be found out by the Godly themselves.

II. The Operations of the Spirit are from God; it is He that causes or commands
the Spiritual Winds to blow upon the Souls of Men and Women.

III. The holy Spirit cleanses the Soul of a Sinner, purging out all those
hurtful Fumes, that arise from the inward Corruption of the Heart; it expells
and works out Deadness and Indisposedness to Good, and removes those things
that cause a Man to be unsavory in his Place and Generation, and which indeed
makes him not to savor of the things of God.

IV. The Spirit also is of a cooling nature, which abates the burning Lust of
Concupiscence, and the scorching of Satan's fiery Darts and Temptations, Ephesians.
6.16.
(as is further opened in the Metaphor of Water.) How comfortable is it in time
of Temptation, to have the Wind of the Spirit blow upon the Soul? the Desire
after Evil is presently allayed thereby.

V. The holy Spirit disperseth the Clouds of Ignorance and Darkness in the
Understanding, Ephesians. 1.18.
and drives away those Mists of Temptation, which cause Men to lose their way,
and by its powerful Influence makes fair Weather in the Soul.

VI. The holy Spirit melts or thaws the cold and frozen Heart of a Sinner. The
Hearts of Men are naturally congealed, like Ice, hard and obdurate; but no
sooner does the Spirit come to blow upon it, but this hardness thaws and
dissolves into a Flood of Tears. Acts* 2.36, 37.


VII. The Holy Spirit tries the Heart and Reins, and finds out the very
Thoughts of Men; it is said, to search all things, yea, the deep things of God;
1 Cor. 2.10. Heb. 4.1^^.
It pierces even to dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit, Joints and Marrow,
and is a Discerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart.

VIII. The Spirit dries up the filthy Issue of our sinful Humors, which makes
our way to Heaven very hard and difficult; and also ripens us (like Wheat) for
the Lord's Harvest. It Is by the Influence of the Spirit, that we are made meet
for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. Col. 1.1^^.


IX. The Spirit moves and operates variously; sometimes it blows upon one
People, and sometimes upon another; sometimes upon one Church it blows
powerfully, when upon another at that time its Operations are hardly
discernible. Again, sometimes the North Wind of the Spirit blows, which is
sharp, cold, and nipping, (Rebukes and Reproofs of the Spirit, and Afflictions,
are like the blowing of the North Wind) which tends to kill the Weeds and Worms
of our Corruptions. And then again, at another time the South Wind blows, which
is warm, See Garden.
comfortable, and refreshing; Peace, inward Joy, and Consolation of the Spirit,
are signified thereby, as the Learned observe.

X. The Spirit of God is a free Agent; it moves, blows, and operates as it
pleases; it is not at our Command. But all these things works the one and the
same Spirit, 1 Cor. 12* 11.
dividing to every one severally as he will.

XI. The holy Spirit is powerful in its Operations, there is no standing before
it. It brings down and levels all high, mighty, lofty, and towering Thoughts of
Men; when in good earnest it begins to work upon the Heart, no Opposition that
is made against it is able to stand. Tho Satan, and evil Relations, may
endeavor to obstruct its workings, and hinder the Soul in its Purposes and
Resolutions Heavenwards; yet nothing is effectual to impede the powerful
Influences of the Spirit, and Grace of God; Mountains of Sin and Opposition are
broken in pieces by it. When it once blows briskly upon the Soul, it presently
cries out, Lord, what would thou have me to do? Immediately, says Saul, I
conferred not with Flesh and Blood. Gal. 1.16.


XII. The Spirit dissolving the Clouds of Iniquity, waters the Heart with Tears
of Repentance and Godly Sorrow.

XIII. The Blowings or Operations of the holy Spirit ought carefully to be
observed, with the access and recess thereof* for a Christian can make no
Earnest of the Duties of Religion, unless these Winds blow. Moreover, there are
certain Signs, whereby a Man may know which way the Spirit blows. 1. If the
Desires of the Soul are after God and Holiness, it is one sign the Wind is in a
right Point. 2. If the Understanding be enlightened, and Clouds of Ignorance
scattered, the Affections changed, so that heavenly Objects are principally
delighted in; if the Will is brought to yield, and readily to submit to the
Will of God, the Spirit blows the right way. 3. If a Man leaves his old and
evil Courses and Company; if that which was once pleasant to him, is now become
grievous to him; if his Discourse be savoury, and his Life holy, you may know
which way the Wind blows: They that are after the Spirit, do mind the things of
the Spirit. Romans 8.5.
4. If there be new Habits wrought in the Soul, so that although a Man may
sometimes be obstructed in his way, and hindered in his course Heavenward, yet
immediately, as it were by a natural or divine Instinct, he falls into his
former Way and Course of Grace and Holiness again; it is a sign which way the
Wind blows. You know the Wind is sometimes obstructed or stopped in its usual
course, by Houses or Trees, etc. so that you can hardly discern by Vanes or
Smoke, etc. which way it is; so it may be with a Christian. Besides, sometimes
you can scarcely perceive any Wind to blow at all, no more can you the
Operations of the Spirit.

XIV. The Spirit of God blowing upon the Soul of a Sinner, causes his Pride and
external Glory to fade away, which is compared to the Flower of the Field. The
Rod has blossomed. Pride has budded. All Flesh is Grass, Ezekiel. 7.10 Isa.
40.6, 7.
and the Goodliness thereof is as the Flower of the Field: The Grass withers,
the Flower fades, because the Spirit of the Lord blows upon it.

XV. The holy Spirit, tho it be invisible, and its Operations mysterious, and
not to be discerned by many Men; yet they may see and hear the Effects of it,
they may perceive what Alteration and Changes it makes in this and that Man:
such as were very vicious and ungodly, are by the Workings of the Spirit formed
into another likeness, and become pious, and truly religious; that Tongue that
was wont to blaspheme God, they now hear to praise and admire him, etc. And
Believers themselves clearly feel and experience the blessed Effects and
Operations thereof in their own Souls.

XVI. The Spirit of God causes the Saints to grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge
of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Spirit moves upon the Affections, and every other
Faculty of the Heart, and by that means causes the Seed of Grace to take the
deeper Root. The Ground or Spirit of a Christian must be broken, and loosened
from the World, and from the Love of sensual things more and more, by the Wind
of the Spirit, or he will not be fruitful in Grace and good Works.

XVII. Unless the Spirit blows upon the Soul, or upon the Church, they lie
becalmed, and cannot sail toward the Haven of eternal Happiness; no Duty or
Service, performed in public or private, can avail any thing; we get not a Bit
of Ground, nor any real Advantage by them, unless they are performed by the
Help and Influence of the Spirit: God is a Spirit, Joh. 4.24.
and they that worship him must worship him in Spirit and in Truth.

XVIII. The holy Spirit winnows and fans God's People, who are compared to
Wheat and good Grain. It Is said of Christ, His Fan is in his Hand, Mat. 3.12.
and he will thoroughly purge his Floor. How does Christ fan and purge his
People, but by his Word and Spirit? it is that which cleanses and makes them
pure from the Dross and Pollutions of Sin and Wickedness, as the Apostle
observes, 1 Cor. 6.11.

XIX. The Spirit of God sometimes comes on a sudden upon a Soul, and by its
powerful Operation, in a short space makes a great and wonderful Change; as
appears in the Case of Saul: but at other times it rises and works upon some
Men's Hearts gradually.

XX. The holy Spirit, when it gets into the Heart of a Man, by its powerful
Operation it makes him tremble, and shakes him to pieces, as it were, causing
strange, tho glorious Workings in the inward Man. This he does by setting the
Evil of Sin before his Eyes, and his woeful Condition thereby. A Man never
trembles as he should, till the Spirit enters into him. Saul was taken with
such a trembling, when the Spirit entered into him, and began to work, that he
could not stand upon his Feet.



METAPHOR.
SOme Winds are sent in Judgment, to destroy and overthrow; which many times
blow down Houses and Trees, and make great Desolation: witness that prodigious
Wind in the Year 1661.

II. Some Winds are of a blasting Nature, and cause the Fruit to fall before it
be ripe.

III. There has been a Wind, in which the Lord has not appeared. 1 King.
19.11.


IV. Some Winds are compared to Words, and Speeches of one that is desperate.

V. Sometimes Wind is made use of to set forth that which is vain and empty.
Prove. 11.19.


VI. Some Winds are without Rain. Whosoever boasts himself of a false Gift, Prove.
25.14.
is like Clouds and Wind without Water.

VII. If some Winds be observed, Men must not plow, nor sow their Seed: He that
observes the Wind, Eccles. 11.4.
shall not sow; and he that regards the Clouds, shall not reap.

VIII. Man's Iniquity is compared unto the Wind.

Disparity.
BUt the Spirit being the great Promise of the Father, and the Fruit and Effect
of Christ's Ascension, is sent in Mercy to strengthen and establish, and is so
far from destroying or overthrowing, Ephesians. 3.17.
as that it causes the Church in general* or a Christian in particular, to
take the more firm Root, and stand the faster. Col. 2.7.


II. But the Spirit, as compared to the North and South Winds, ripeneth a
Christian in Grace, Cant. 4. ult. Psalm. 84.1^^
and causes the Spices thereof to flow forth: Grace ripeneth and fitteth for
Glory.

III. But there is no greater Demonstration of the Lord's presence with his
People, or with a Soul, than by the Indwelling of his Spirit: Joh. 14.17 Mat.
18.20.
Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I, says Christ.

IV. But no Man speaking by the Spirit, calls Jesus accursed. 1 Cor. 12.3 Luke
Men are by the Spirit brought into their right Minds* witness the Prodigal.

V. But wherever the holy Scriptures make mention of the holy Spirit, it is
to set forth Persons and Things, as they are, substantial; Gal. 5.22.
neither is there any thing that is more opposite to Lightness or Vanity, than
the Work of Grace wrought by the Spirit in the Hearts of Believers.

VI. But the Wind of the Spirit is always attended with sweet Dews and Showers
of Rain, being frequently thereunto compared in Scripture.

VII. But whosoever ploweth or sows, in expectation of a blessed Crop, must
observe the Wind of the Spirit, without which his Plowing and Sowing will be
altogether unprofitable, if not Sin.

VIII. But contrary-wise, there is no Work of the Spirit in the Hearts of Men,
but what is directly contrary thereunto, and tends to the mortifying of all Sin
and Iniquity whatsoever.



Inferences.
WE may infer from hence, how hard a thing it is for us to know the Nature of
the Work of the Spirit in Regeneration upon another Man's Heart, some of its
Operations being so secret and invisible.

2. Let it teach us to pray to God, that he would be pleased to raise this
Wind, and cause it to blow briskly upon our Souls and Churches. And let us be
contented with that Wind of the Spirit which God sends to blow upon us, whether
it be the North Wind of Affliction, Adversity, and Rebuke, or the South Wind of
Peace, Joy, and Prosperity, both being absolutely necessary; as we would have
the one, so we cannot be without the other.

3. Bless God when you find the Influences of the spiritual Wind upon your own
Souls, or upon the Souls of others.

4. Let it be also a Warning to all true Believers, as they would be preserved
in their Christian Course, and be kept from being tossed to and fro, and so
from the Danger of Rocks and Sands, to take heed in steering their Course, by
what Wind they sail, because there are some Winds of Doctrine, that arise from
the Sleight of Men, and cunning Craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
deceive; Ephesians. 4.14.
called also diverse and strange Doctrines, Heb. 13.9.

The Holy-Spirit compared to Fire.
1 Thessalonians. 5.22. Quench not the Spirit.


In this Place the Spirit of God, in his Gifts and Operations, is compared to
Fire, which is largely opened under the Head of Metaphors that respect the
Word, to which we refer you.

The Oil of Gladness.
Psalm. 45.7. Therefore God, thy God has anointed thee with the Oil of Gladness
above thy Fellows.

1 John 2.20, and 27. But ye have an Unction from the holy One, and ye know all
things. But the Anointing which ye have received from him, abides in you; and
ye need not that any Man teach you: but, as the same Anointing teaches you all
things, etc.


BY a Metaphor called an Anthropopathy, Oil or Anointing is attributed to God,
Psalm. 45.7. Heb. 1.9. Cant. 1.3. where the Holy Spirit with his Gifts are
understood. Which appears by comparing this Place with Isa. 61.1. Acts 10.38.
Joh. 3.34. where the Unction of Christ as King and Priest, is treated of. Hence
comes the Derivation of the Name of our Savior, who is called (...) Vnctus,
anointed, Joh. 1.25. and 4.25. (...), by way of Eminency. Believers in a
measure, are made Partakers of this Unction; who by true Faith, adhere to
Christ the chief Head.

METAPHOR.
OIL is of a softning and mollifying nature, a sovereign good for all hard
Tumors in the Body. The Prophet complains, Plin. lib. 23. p. 160.
that the Sores of Judah were not mollified with Ointment. Isa. 1.6.


II. Oil is of an healing nature, the Samaritan poured Oil and Wine into the
Man's Wounds who fell among Thieves. Luke 10.34
Oil searches into the bottom of Wounds.

III. Oil, Pliny says, is contrary to Scorpions, and in a wonderful manner
expels dangerous Venom and Poison, that may accidentally be taken into the
Body; it secures the Vitals from the penetrating Insinuations thereof, which
else would seize upon and destroy them.

IV. Oil will hardly, if at all, mingle or incorporate with other liquid
things; it is observed, put it into what you please, Vening.
it will not be kept under, but will get uppermost.

V. Oil warmeth, comfort, and refreshes the Body, Plin. p. 432.
it being anointed and bathed therewith.

VI. Oil cannot be dried up by the heat of Summer, as Water and other liquid
things will, it will conserve and maintain its being against the scorching heat
of the Sun.

VII. Oil according to Pliny, clears the Eyesight mightily, and disperseth
Mists and Clouds that cause Dimness in the same.

VIII. Oil is excellent good to open Obstructions, Plin. lib. 23. p. 162.
and help them who cannot breath freely.

IX. Oil is fat a and feeding Substance, it is a very nourishing thing ('it is
thought) there is nothing more wholesome to the Body of Man.

X. Oil eaten with some other things (that have some hurtful Quality,) makes
them very good and nourishing, whilst others who eat them without Oil are
surfeited thereby.

XI. Oil, Naturalists tells us, is good against Shakings, Tremblings, and
Convulsions, which many are troubled with, Plin. lib. 23. p. 162.
so that on a sudden sometimes they fall down, and foam at Mouth.

XII. Oil was made use of under the Law, in cleansing him who had the Plague of
the Leprosy. The Priest was to put Oil on the top of his Right Ear, Levit.
14.17, 18.
and upon the Thumb of his Right Hand; and the Remnant of it upon his Head.

XIII. Oil is used for Lamps, whereby they burn long, and give light to them
that are in the House, the use whereof is very well known to all.

XIV. Oil has a beautifying Virtue; the Virgins that were prepared for the
Persian King, used Ointments to make them fair, for six Months space they used
sweet Odours, and six Months Oil of Mirth. This Oil, Naturalists say, has a
beautifying Quality, and fetches Wrinkles out of the Skin. David, speaks of
Oil, saying, it makes the Face to shine.

XV. There are some Men that cannot endure Oil, they love it not, will not be
persuaded to put a little into their Mouths, they are naturally averse to it.

XVI. The Joints and Limbs being anointed with some sort of Oil, 'twill very
much strengthen them, and make a Man more agile, nimble and fit for Motion.

XVII. The Priests, Kings and Prophets under the Law, were anointed with Oil.

Parallel.
THE Spirit softens a hard Heart, asswageth and brings down those obdurate and
hard Swellings of Pride and vain Glory, which naturally are in the Souls of Men
and Women, making them willing and pliable to the Will of God.

II. The Spirit opens the Heart, and searches into every Corner thereof; it is
said to search all things: There is no Sin nor secret Corruption, but it will
find it out; and when it has softened and mollified the Heart and Conscience,
it does in a gracious manner heal it.

III. The Spirit is contrary to Satan that old Serpent, and all the cursed and
killing Venom and Poison of Sin, and does wonderfully expel and purge it out of
the Soul, when God is pleased to give a suitable measure thereof; it secureth
from the Insinuations of Sin, and 'twill cause a Man to vomit it up by
unfeigned Repentance, by which means, the Life of the Soul is preserved: for if
by the Operation of the Spirit, Sin is not vomited up, Death will certainly
follow. Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. Luke 13.3. For the
Flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh, and these
are contrary the one to the other. Gal. 5.17.

IV. The Spirit of God will never mingle, nor become one with the Flesh; the
Spirit is from above, and ever endeavors to be uppermost, in what Heart soever
it is, 'twill not be under the command of Sin nor Satan. Walk in the Spirit,
and ye shall not fulfill the Lusts of the Flesh.

V. The Spirit wonderfully revives, comfort, Acts 2.3. 1 These. 5.19.
and infuseth Spiritual Warmth and Heat into the Soul of a Believer, when he is
anointed with it; and indeed nothing else will refresh, Rev. 11.11 Joh. 14.19.
enliven and warm the inward Man: hence it is compared to Fire, and called the
Spirit of Life, and blessed Comforter.

VI. the Spirit cannot be dried up by the heat of Persecution, nor the
scorching beams of Satan's Temptations, that will live and abide the same in
the Souls of sincere Converts, losing none of its gracious Influences and
Operations. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Comforter, that shall abide with you for ever. Joh. 14.16. See Comforter.

VII. The Spirit clears the Eyes of the Understanding, it is called Eye Salve;
and from hence the Apostle prays for the Ephesians, That the God of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, Ephesians. 1.17.18.
would grant them the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of him,
That the Eyes of their Understanding being enlightened, they might know what was
the hope of his calling, etc. Clouds and Mists of Darkness are upon the Eyes of
all that have not received the Spirit, so that they cannot behold things a far
off.

VIII. The Spirit of God is the only Remedy for all Obstructions of the inward
Man, those that scarce breath or pray at all, by receiving a measure of the
Spirit, breath out freely their desire to Almighty God: Likewise the Spirit
helps our Infirmities: Romans 8.26.
for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit makes
Intercession, etc. No Man can say Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. 1 Cor.
12.3.

IX. The Spirit feeds the Soul, yea it makes it fat and well liking; nothing
nourishes comparable to the Spirit; the Word and Ordnances of God, are but dry
Bread to it: Isa. 25.6.
this is the chief of those fat things full of Marrow, by which God feasts,
Isa. 58.11.
and makes fat the Bones of his Saints.

X. The Spirit of God being received and lived upon, the Abundance of the
things of this World, that have in them by means of Sin, some hurtful and
surfeiting Quality, are made hereby very good and profitable to Believers; but
for want of the Spirit's seasoning and sanctifying, they become deadly and
destructive to wicked Men, their Table, Bed, and all they enjoy, are made
Snares to them. Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your Hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and Drunkenness, and the Cares of this World,
etc. Luke 21.34.

XI. The Holy Spirit is of exceeding great use against all Tremblings and
Convulsions of the Soul in evil Times, it frees the Godly from all slavish
Fears, which shake some Men for want of it, out of their Faith, Honesty, and
Religion; and it keeps sincere ones steadfast, and imovable, from being shaken
by false Doctrine and lying Spirits; which have troubled many with strange
Convulsions, Shakings and Tremblings in this Nation; so that (as my Author
says) they have even foamed at the Mouth, when Quakerism first came up amongst
us.

XII. The Holy Spirit is made use of by the Lord Jesus Christ, our Heavenly
High Priest, in cleansing the Leprosy of Sin, he puts it into, (or upon) every
Faculty of the Inward Man, the Will, the Affection, the Understanding, the
Conscience, the Head, the Hand, the Heart, the whole Soul is anointed
therewith, before it is pronounced clean by the Lord. I will put my Spirit
within you, and you shall be clean from all your Filthiness. Ezekiel. 36.25, 26,
27. Joh. 6.63. Joh. 15.3.
Now are you clean through the Word that I have spoken to you; the Words that I
have spoken to you, they are the Spirit and the Life.

XIII. The Spirit of God is that spiritual Oil, that the Wise Virgins took in
their Vessels and in their Lamps, by which means they were accepted by the
Bridegroom, and the Foolish for want of it, Mat. 25.8, 10.
their Lamps of Profession went out, and they not suffered to go into the
Wedding-Chamber.

XIV. The Holy Spirit has an excellent beautifying Quality, there is no scar,
spot nor deformity in the Soul, but the Spirit can purge and cleanse it, they
that are anointed with this Oil, shine in the Eyes of God and good Men; 'twill
make a Blackmore white and beautifful, fetches out those Wrinkles and
foul-Staines and Spots, Ezekiel. 16.14.
that naturally are in the Souls of Men and Women; it takes of Christ's Beauty,
and puts it upon the Soul, and so places a shining Luster upon the Inward Man.
Thy Beauty, Ezekiel. 16.14.
for it was perfect through my Comeliness, which I had put upon thee, etc. How
glorious and beautiful to be hereby? And all that sat in the Council, looking
steadfastly on him, saw his Face as did Stephen appear if it had been the Face
of an Angel. Acts 6.15.

XV. There are some, nay many Men in the World, that love, not like not the
Spirit, they are naturally so averse to it, that they will not be persuaded to
make trial of it; they cannot believe there is any Sweetness, Benefit, or Savor
in it. The Natural Man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
are Foolishness unto him; neither can be know them, because they are
spiritually discerned. 1 Cor. 2.14.

XVI. The Spirit is good to strengthen the weak and decayed Hands and Knees of
a poor Saint; and thereby makes the Soul more fit for Motion Godwards, lively,
quick, agile, and fit for Heavenly Service.

XVII. The Lord Jesus was anointed with the Spirit, that Oil of Gladness, above
his Fellows. Heb. 1.9.
Moreover every Minister of the Gospel must be anointed therewith, or he is not
accepted of God.



METAPHOR.
OTher Oil is of an earthly Extract, and several sorts of it are prepared and
made fit for use by the Art and Wisdom of Man being extracted from earthly
things.

II. There is not one sort of Oil, that has all kind of excellent Qualities in
it; that which may be good to beautify and of a dulciferous Scent, may not be
medicinable.

III. Oil will not last long, its Virtue is soon gone, it quickly decays and
becomes unsavory.

Disparity.
THe Spirit is from above, and without beginning, Flowing from the Throne of
God and the Lamb. But the Comforter, Rev. 22.1. Joh. 15.26
even the Spirit of Truth which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of
me.

II. The Spirit has all excellent Qualities in it; 'twill not only beautify
and perfume, but it is also sovereign good for healing all Distempers of the
Soul; what rare Property is there in any sort of Oil, but the Spirit in an
heavenly manner far excels it?

III. The Spirit ever abides the same, never corrupts, nor loses its Virtue,
it lasts from everlasting to everlasting.



Inferences.
FRom hence we may see the excellent Nature, Properties and Usefulness of the
Spirit.

2. It may move and stir us up to pray to the Father for fresh Anointings.

3. Let us ascribe all tenderness and brokeness of Heart, to the mollifying
Virtue of this Precious Oil.

4. When ye see choice and excellent Oil, think seriously on the Holy Spirit?

5. Labor to get much of it in your Vessels, lest your Lamps go out, and you
go to buy when it is too late.

The Holy-Spirit the Earnest of the Saints Inheritance.
Ephesians. 1.13, 14. After ye believed, ye were sealed with the Spirit of Promise;
which is the Earnest of our Inheritance, etc.


METAPHOR.
AN Earnest is usually part of the best things which are in common Use and
Estimation among Men; as Gold, Silver, etc.

II. An Earnest imports some thing bought or sold, as also an Agreement, or
Consent between two Parties, for the confirming of some Contract or Promise,
which before was not settled.

III. An Earnest is given as a Pledge of some future good thing, purchased or
promised to a Person.

IV. An Earnest oftimes of a great Bargain or Purchase is a considerable Sum,
twenty or thirty Pounds, sometimes more has been given in earnest of an
Inheritance: an Earnest is commonly proportioned according to the worth or
value of the Purchase.

V. An Earnest is that which confirms or makes sure a Bargain or Contract
between two Parties, by the means of which each claims his own Interest and
Property.

VI. An Earnest puts a Bar to any who would unjustly stop, disanul, or make
void the Covenant agreed upon.

VII. An Earnest confirms a Bargain, so that it gives assurance to him, that
receives it, of the Inheritance or Purchase of whatsoever it is the Earnest.

VIII. An Earnest though it may be in it self, something of considerable value;
yet it is always far short in worth to that which it is the Earnest of.

IX. An Earnest as it is something given of a valuable consideration, to
confirm a Bargain so; the Person that receives it, immediately enjoys it, he
has it in hand for his present Profit and Advantage; and many times a Man has
nothing else to live upon till he receives the whole Sum, but the Earnest-Mony.

X. There is always some distance of Time between the laying down of the
Earnest of an Inheritance, and full enjoyment of it, or entering into the
Possession thereof.

Parallel.
THe Holy Spirit ( viz.) the Gifts, Graces and Operations thereof, is part of
the best things which the great God (in this World) gives unto his dear
Children.

II. The Earnest of the Spirit does also denote (as it is observed by some) that
spiritual Bargain which is made between God and a Believer. The Lord in a
solemn Contract, requires of us our whole Soul, Life, Strength, the best we
are, and are capable to perform for the Glory of his holy Name, and to the end
he might have (as I may say) the Bargain punctually observed, has given us an
Earnest, Romans 12.2. 1 Cor. 6.19, 20.
to wit, his Spirit, and we in receiving of it, show our Assent and Consent to
the Contract, to serve the Lord and become his for ever.

III. The Spirit is given by the Father to Believers as a Pledge or Earnest of
the blessed Inheritance, which Christ purchased by his Blood for them, and upon
the account of his own free Grace is promised to them. Who has also sealed us,
and given us the Earnest of the Spirit in our Hearts. 2 Cor. 1.22.

IV. The Spirit which God gives to Believers, as the Earnest of Eternal Life,
is a great Sum, or that which is of considerable Value; the Purchase being
infinite or invaluable, it is meet the Earnest should bear some Proportion to
it; who is able to account or reckon up the worth of the Spirit of God, which
is the Earnest of the Saints Inheritance? We may judge of the Value and
Excellency of it by the fruits thereof, which are Love, Joy, Peace,
Long-suffering, Gentleness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance, etc. Gal. 5.22, 23.
Phil. 4.7.
One particular Fruit of the Spirit ( viz.) Peace is such an inestimable Jewel,
that the Apostle says, It passes all Understanding.

V. The Earnest of the Spirit which God has given to his People, confirms that
mutual Contract and Agreement which is between him and them: God hereby claims
a new Covenant-Right to Believers, and Believers claim Interest and Property in
God. Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given
us of his Spirit. 1 John 4.13.

VI. The Earnest of the Spirit prevents Satan from steping in to break and make
void the Spiritual Bargain, or Contract between the Soul and the Lord Jesus
Christ. A Saint can by this means say, I have received Earnest of God, I am not
mine own, I have agreed, covenanted, and sold my self to him. Depart from me,
ye evil doers; Psalm. 119.115. Zech. 3.2.
for I will keep the Commandments of my God. The Lord rebuke thee Satan, etc.
And hereby God looks upon himself concerned to secure and make sure of the Soul
to preserve his Right and Interest he has in his People against all Enemies,
that he might not lose his Bargain.

VII. The Spirit confirms the Covenant of Grace so to Believers, that it gives
them an assurance of Eternal Life and Glory to come; hence it is called, The
Earnest of the Saints Inheritance, Ephesians. 1.14.
until the Redemption of the Purchased Possession.

VIII. The Gifts, Influences and Graces of the holy Spirit, tho they are in
themselves of great Worth and Value, and accordingly greatly prized by the
Godly; yet not to be compared to the full Fruition of God and the glorious
Inheritance which the Spirit is given as the Earnest of.

IX. The Spirit which is the Earnest of Glory, is given to Believers for their
present Profit; God's infinite Favor bestows Grace, Peace, Joy, and the like,
1 Cor. 12.7. Gal. 5.22.
whilst Saints are in this World: and indeed it is upon this Earnest-Mony they
live, and it is so much as is sufficient to bear all their Charges, and def^^ay
all their Expenses till they receive the everlasting Kingdom. Gal. 5.25.


X. There is also a distance of Time between the Saints receiving the Spirit,
which is the Earnest of that glorious Inheritance, and the full Possession of
it. They receive the Spirit as the Earnest when, or soon after they believe,
the Time when they receive the Inheritance is not till they die, and not the
full Fruition or perfect Enjoyment of it till the Resurrection: Henceforth is
laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which God, the righteous Judge, will
give me at that Day, etc. 2 Timothy 4.8




METAPHOR.
AN Earnest among Men is usually a certain Sum, either more or less, of Gold or
Silver, which are but corruptible and earthly Things.

II. The best and greatest Purchase an Earnest among Men is given for, consists
but of temporal things, that pass away and perish, as all Sublunary Things do.

III. Sometimes among Men, a Person who has given Earnest for such or such a
Commodity, does afterward recant his Bargain.

IV. Sometimes the Purchaser loses his Earnest, by flying from the Bargain, and
so never has the Inheritance.

V. Amongst Men, the Earnest of an Inheritance is given by the Purchaser to the
Seller, and he expects something of equal worth for that he parts withal for it.

VI. An Earnest among Men is given by the Purchaser, with an intent or design
to advantage himself thereby; it is chiefly his own Interest and Profit which he
aims at in this Action.

Disparity.
THe Earnest of the Saints Inheritance is of an inestimable value, being of an
heavenly and sublime Nature, the holy, blessed, and eternal Spirit of God, in
the Operations, Gifts, and Graces thereof.

II. The holy Spirit is the Earnest of an Inheritance, incorruptible, and
undefiled, and that fades not away, 1 Pet. 1.5.
reserved in Heaven for us. Be thou faithful unto Death, Rev. 2.10.
and I will give thee a Crown of Life.

III. There never will be any recanting about giving or receiving this
Spiritual Earnest; God will never repent that he gave his Spirit to his
faithful Children, it being bestowed upon them as the Result of his eternal
Purpose in Jesus Christ. And Believers have no cause to recant their Bargain,
in yielding themselves up to God, both Body and Soul, all they are, and are
capable to do, for the Glory of Free Grace; for their Gain will be unspeakable
thereby: Godliness is profitable to all things, having the Promise of the Life
that now is, 1 Timothy 4.^^
and that which is to come; it is great Gain.

IV. God will never, can never lose those Souls, for whom he gave his Son, as
the Price of their Redemption, and his Spirit as an Earnest to make sure of
them: My Father which gave them me is greater than all, Joh. 10.2^^
and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hands.

V. The Spiritual Earnest is given by the Father, upon the account of Christ's
Purchase, unto Believers. The Lord Jesus bought the Inheritance, and received
the Earnest of it for us, as Mediator, who freely gives it to us; out of his
own good Will he bestows it upon us, as an Assurance of the full possession of
eternal Life.

VI. The Lord giving his Spirit as the Earnest of future Blessings, designs
('it is acknowledged) his own Glory thereby; but chiefly the Profit will be ours:
'Twas our Good, our Advantage Christ designed and aimed at, in dying for us,
and in giving his Spirit to us.



Inferences.
WHat admirable Grace and Favor is here! Did God give Christ to die for us, to
redeem us from Sin and Wrath to come? and did he receive the holy Spirit, as
Mediator, to give it unto us, the Earnest of that purchased Possession? Let
this be to the Praise of his Glory, Christ purchases that we might possess.
Others purchase that they might inherit themselves, and give Earnest to make
sure the Estate to themselves; but the Lord Jesus needed not to do so, he was
Heir from everlasting, and all that he did as Mediator was for us, to enrich
and make us happy and blessed for ever.

2. If God has given to Believers the Holy Spirit, as the Earnest of their
Inheritance, let them take heed they do not go about to defraud him of his
Bargain: They are not their own, they are bought with a Price, and they have
consented to this holy Contract, 1 Cor. 6.19, 20.
by taking an Earnest from his hand. It Is great Injustice to deprive or keep
back any part of a lawful Bargain from the Buyer, especially when he has given
Earnest for it.

3. This shows what certain Hopes and good Assurances a godly Man has of
eternal Life: It Is bought or purchased for him, it is given by Promise to him,
the Promise is sealed; nay, more than this, he has received a Pledge or Earnest
of it. What little ground is there then for any Soul to despond, or doubt of
the eternal Inheritance? The holy God deals with us after the manner of Men,
about the great Concerns of another World; the bare Promise of God would be
Security enough, we need not require a Seal and an Earnest of him. O how does
Divine Goodness condescend to poor Creatures, H^^b. 6.
that the Heirs of Promise might have strong Consolation.

4. From hence Believers may learn how to repel and withstand the Temptations
of Satan. Simon, says our Savior, Satan has desired to have you, etc. But
might not Simon (and so consequently every true Christian) say, Luke ^^2.31
I am not mine own, thou come too late, Satan, I have received Earnest of a
better Estate, of a better Kingdom than thou have: I have given up my self to
Jesus Christ, and he has taken possession of me by his Spirit, that I might
possess and enjoy him to Eternity.

5. And let Sinners, who would have an Interest in God, and enjoy this eternal
Inheritance, learn from hence the ready way to come to it.

First; They must believe: The Saints that are sealed with the Spirit, which is
the Earnest of the purchased Inheritance, are said to trust in God, after they
heard the Word of Truth, the Gospel of their Salvation: In whom (says the
Apostle) after that ye believed, Ephesians. 1.13.
ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of Promise, which is the Earnest of our
Inheritance, until the Redemption of the purchased Possession, to the Praise of
his Glory.

Secondly; As they must hear, attend upon the Word, go out of themselves to
Christ, rely upon him, and trust in him, believe and receive the Record God
has given of his Son; so they must submit to his Ordinances. The Spirit is
promised to those that keep his Commandments, John 14.15, 16. If this be done
in Truth and Sincerity, you shall certainly receive the Earnest of future
Happiness, as well as others.

6. Those that would have a Trial of their Estates and Conditions, who desire
to know whether they have received the Spirit of God or not, may read the
Metaphor where the holy Spirit is compared to a Seal. Nothing is more needful;
all may see from hence to make sure of the Spirit; take heed you be not
mistaken about it, etc.

And let them that have received it, live upon it. Such need not fear wanting
any good thing; this Earnest-Penny will (as has been shown already) defray all
their Charge whilst they are in this World. It Is a great Sum; God gives like
himself, and answerable to that Inheritance prepared and purchased for
Believers.

7. What Fools are they that slight and despise this Earnest? God offers Men in
the Gospel everlasting Life, and, to assure them of it, promises them, if they
will come to his Terms, to give them his Spirit as the Earnest thereof: Turn
you at my Reproof; Prove. 1.23.
behold, I will pour out my Spirit upon you, I will make known my Words unto
you.

The Holy-Spirit compared to a Seal.
Ephesians. 1.13. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the Word of Truth* the
Gospel of your Salvation; in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed
with that holy Spirit of Promise.

Ephesians. 4.30. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto
the Day of Redemption.


A Seal is an Instrument fitted to make an Impression or Mark, by which a Man
knows the thing done, whatsoever it be, to be his own and not another Act; as
also to ratify and make authentic Bonds, Covenants, etc. And in opening this
Metaphor, of Believers being sealed by the holy Spirit, these things are meet
to be noted.

1. The Letter written, or the Vessel filled with Treasure, every true
Christian.

2. The Wax appointed to the Seal, and that is the Heart, 2 Cor. 3 3. 2 Cor.
4.7.
the relenting and pliable Heart of a Sinner, Heb. 10.16.

3. The Sealer, that is, as some conceive, the Father, or the Lord Jesus
Christ; others more immediately the holy Spirit, or third Person of the Trinity.

4. The Seal, as some understand, is the Word of God, others the Spirit; we
include both jointly considered.

5. The Sealing or Impression active, is the Act of applying the Word in the
Ministry of the Gospel, by the help of the Spirit, to the Soul.

6. The Print or Impression passive, or Image of the Seal left in the Wax, is
called the Image of God, or Knowledge, Faith, Love, Truth, Holiness, etc. which
are originally in God, and communicated to us by the Word and Spirit from him.
Wilson.


7. The End of Sealing, which is Secrecy, Property, and Security, which things
will appear more fully in opening the Metaphor.

METAPHOR.
A Seal (especially if it be the King's Seal) is highly prized, and very
carefully kept.

II. A Seal makes an Impression in the Wax like it self, or leaves a
resemblance of it.

III. Before the Seal can make an Impression, the Wax must be melted, or made
pliable, soft, and fit to take it.

IV. The Seal alters the Form of the Clay it is set or stamped upon. A piece of
Clay is a rude Lump, without form or figure, says Mr. Caryl, but if you take a
Seal and stamp upon it, See Caryl on Job 36.14.
that Clay receives any Figure, or Coat of Arms, that is engraven upon it.

V. A Seal is to confirm and make sure Bonds, Contracts, or Covenants that are
made between Man and Man. If an honest Man makes a Promise of such and such
things to his Friend, he thinks he has ground to hope those good things, so
promised him, are his own; but if he gives it under his Hand in Writing, he
concludes he is more sure; but if the Writing, Covenant, or Promise be sealed,
it is as firm and as sure as he can desire to have it.

VI. A Seal is used to distinguish or differ things one from another, whereby
Property is known and secured; a Merchant knows his Goods from other Men's by
the Seal or Mark he sets upon them.

VII. A Seal is used to confirm and make Laws Authentic; till they have the
King's Seal stamped upon them, they oblige not the Subject to Obedience.

VIII. A Seal is used to secure, preserve or keep safe several things, which
otherwise might be spoiled, run out, and become good for nothing. Things that
we would not have any to touch, nor meddle with, we set a Seal upon.

IX. A Seal many times is counterfeited by ill Men, they endeavor to imitate
it as nigh as they can, to cheat poor ignorant People thereby.

X. A Seal is used to hide or keep back others from the Knowledge of things; if
a Man have any thing to write unto his Friend that he would not have others
know, he seals up his Letter, upon the account of Secrecy, tho it is like
afterward, in convenient time, those things so concealed are discovered.

Parallel.
THe holy Spirit is the King's Seal, the glorious King of Heaven and Earth, and
therefore is highly valued and prized by every true Christian.

II. The holy Spirit makes an Impression on the Heart, there is in a Believer a
Similitude, a Likeness or Resemblance of God; every Saint has the Image of the
Spirit upon him, he is holy, harmless, heavenly, etc.

III. Before the holy Spirit seals any Person to the Day of Redemption, the
Heart is broken, softened, and made pliable by the Word, and powerful Operations
of Grace, and so made fit to take that heavenly Impression. And thus you have
David speaking, I am poured out like Water, and all my Bones are out of Joint:
My Heart is like Wax, it is melted in the midst of my Bowels.

IV. The Spirit makes a change upon the Soul of a Man or Woman that receives
the Impression of it, it alters every Faculty, and puts a new Form or Figure
(as it were) upon it. Man naturally is a rude Lump, a gross and confused Piece,
by reason of Sin, till the Spirit stamps upon him, or infuses into him new
Habits.

V. The Holy Spirit confirms and makes sure the Covenant and Promises of God to
Believers; Psalm. 22.14
God has not only made gracious Promises to them, of Pardon, Peace and Eternal
Life, etc. But he has left these Promises written in the Holy Scriptures; and
not only so, but such is his great Love and Kindness to them, he has given
them his Seal, they have his Promise, his Word, 2 Cor. 1.22
and his Spirit also, that they might not doubt of the Truth and Stability of
his Covenant. Ephesians. 1.13. Acts 5.3.
We are his Witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Spirit, whom God
has given to them that obey him.

VI. The Holy Spirit distinguishes or differs one Man from another; God has
set his Seal or Mark upon all his People. The Foundation of God remains sure,
having this Seal, 2 Timothy 2.19. Romans 9.
The Lord knows them that are his. If any Man has not the Spirit of Christ,
he is none of his.

VII. The Holy Spirit is the broad Seal of Heaven, Mark 16.20. Heb. 2.3, 4
by which all the Laws and Institutions of the Gospel were ratified and
confirmed, with Signs and Wonders in the Primitive Time; by which means they
come to be Authentic, and everlasting Laws, obliging all Men to Obedience; and
all Laws of Spiritual Worship, Traditions, and Institutions, enjoined by any
Potentate, Assembly, or Council whatsoever, that were not thus sealed or
witnessed to, are utterly to be rejected.

VIII. The Spirit secures, preserves, and keeps safe all true Believers from
the Danger they continually are exposed to, from Sin, Satan, and the
Insnarements and Mischiefs of this evil World. Satan, nor wicked Men must not,
cannot destroy the Servants of God, because of the Mark or Seal he has set
upon them. Set a Mark upon the Men that mourn, etc. saying, Hurt not the Earth,
Ezekiel. 9.4. Rev. 7.3. Rev. 9.4.
etc. till we have sealed the Servants of our God in the Forehead, etc. And it
was commanded them, that they should not hurt the Grass of the Earth, neither
any green thing, neither any Tree, but only those Men, which have not the Seal
of God upon their Forehead.

IX. The Spirit is oftimes counterfeited by Satan, who transforms himself into
an Angel of Light, as do his Ministers, as if they were the Ministers of
Righteousness; hence they pretend to Light, Spirit and Holiness, and beguile
the ignorant and unwary Souls to their Eternal Ruin.

X. The Holy Spirit has hid or sealed up some things from some Men; Rev. 8.16.
Bind up my Temstiony, seal the Law amongst my Disciples. Many things are hid
from Saints themselves, in dark and mysterious Prophecies in the Holy
Scripture. Seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered, etc. Yet in
due time those things shall be revealed, and not only so, but the Saints of God
themselves, by the Spirit are such a sealed and hidden People, that but a very
few can read and understand them, though legible to be read of all the chosen
and elect Seed, and Heirs of Promise, and in that great Day they shall be known
by all the World.



METAPHOR.
A Seal among Men, after a Bond or Covenant is sealed therewith, may be defaced
or broken, and thereby the said Bond or Covenant may lose its Virtue, Efficacy,
and not be deemed good and Authentic in Law.

II. A Seal among Men can make no Impression without a Hand, or one to seal
therewith.

III. A Seal is an Instrument made by the hand of some Artificer of earthly
Matter or Substance, and makes only a humane or external Impression.

IV. A Seal may be lost, or grow old and defective, and so make no perfect and
clear Impression.

Disparity.
THe Holy Spirit having once made a gracious and glorious Impression in the
Soul of a Man, neither Devil, nor any other Enemy can ever, by all their
Strength and Skill utterly deface, tear or break it, so as to make the Covenant
of Grace to lose its Virtue and become of none Effect to the Soul; hence
Believers are said, Ephesians. 4.30*
To be sealed to the day of Redemption.

II. The Spirit is not only the Seal, but the Sealer, he makes the Impression,
needing no other, and also is the Seal by which the Impression is made.

III. The Spirit is an uncreated Being, or an immortal Substance, and makes a
divine and heavenly Impression in the Mind or Soul of a Man or Woman, which by
the operation of God's Grace is made pliable and meet to receive it.

IV. The Spirit can never be lost, grow old, be wore out, or become defective;
so that the Impression it now makes, is the same in every respect with that it
made five thousand Years ago.



Inferences.
FRom hence, we may perceive by whom the Change or Difference is made, which is
in any Person. Man is born in Sin, and rather resembles Satan, bears his Image,
than the Character and Likeness of God Almighty, till the Holy Spirit stamps a
new and heavenly Character upon them, or infuses a spiritual Habit into him.
Who makes thee to differ from another, or what have thou, which thou have not
received, etc.

II. It may serve to stir every one up, to examine their Hearts, whether they
have received the Impression of this Spiritual Seal: as is the Seal, such is
the Impression it makes. They that are after the Spirit, mind the things of the
Spirit: But we all with open Face, beholding as in a Glass, the Glory of the
Lord, are changed into the same Image, Romans 8.5. 2 Co. 3 18
from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

III. For further Trial take these few brief Notes following.

1. Were your Hearts ever humbled in the sense of Sin, broken in pieces,
melted, made soft, and pliable to receive the Seal? The Heart of Man naturally
is hard and obdurate, and will not take this spiritual Impression.

2. Did the Spirit ever set home, and seal any Promise in particular, or
Promises in general upon your Hearts? so that you can say with the Prophet
David, Lord remember the word unto thy Servant, upon which thou have caused me
to hope. Psalm. 119.49. The Ephesians are said to be sealed with the Spirit of
Promise. Ephesians. 1.13.

3. Are you formed into the Likeness and Image of the Spirit? There is in that
Soul that is sealed by the Spirit, a certain Impression of Divine Light; former
Darkness flies away, and the Eyes of the Understanding are enlightened, the Soul
sees an Excellency in God, and in Jesus Christ, Phil. 3.9, 10, 11, 12.
a transcendent Beauty in divine Objects, and values the Knowledge of Jesus
Christ and him crucified, above all the things in this World.

4. Are you holy, heavenly, spiritual? are there Principles of true Piety and
Godliness wrought in you? Do you love God because he is holy, and love his Word
because of the purity of it? Do you breath and pant after a further Conformity
and Likeness to him?

5. Is thy Heart washed from its Filthiness? If thou art not cleansed from thy
former Wickedness, and swinish Nature, thou may assure thy self thou have
not the Spirit of God in thee, thou art far from being sealed therewith. It Is
by the virtue of those Promises that are imprinted upon the Soul by the
Holy-Gost, that a Man comes to cleanse himself from all Filthiness of the Flesh
and Spirit, and to perfect Holiness in the Fear of God, 2 Cor. 7.1.

6. Does not thy Heart condemn thee, for allowing thy self in any known Sin, or
for living in the continual neglect of any one known Duty? The Spirit
witnesses with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God. Where it is a
sealing Spirit, it is a witnessing Spirit. It compares the Heart and Life of a
Man with the Rule of the Word: and if the Bent and Stream of the Soul be
Heavenward, and his sincere Design is after God, and to live to him in this
World, as well as to live with him in the World to come; to be holy here, as
well as to be happy hereafter; then the Spirit witnesses for him: But if
otherwise, it witnesses against him, and his own Spirit condemns him.

IV. Moreover, this may inform sincere Christians to their unspeakable Joy, how
firm and sure the Covenant of Grace is to them. They are sealed with the holy
Spirit unto the Day of Redemption; they are marked for Heaven, and cannot lose
their Title to the eternal Inheritance, because they cannot lose the Seal of
it: As they have received the Earnest of it, so they have the Witness and Seal
of it, that it might be every way firm and sure to them.

V. Let all who profess the Gospel, and pretend to the Spirit, strive to get
this Seal. It Is not enough to read of the Covenant of God, and to have some
external knowledge of it, and dispute about it; but labor to get it sealed to
you by the holy Spirit.

VI. If the Spirit be the Earnest and Seal of this blessed Inheritance, do not
grieve it; this is the Counsel the Apostle gave to the Ephesians. Do not quench
the Motions of it, nor turn a deaf Ear to the tender and gracious Reproofs it
daily gives you. Do not give way to Sin or Satan; neglect not your Duties; pray
often, and hear the Word, and be found in your places where the Word and Spirit
has directed you: Live in Love, and let all Bitterness, Wrath, Anger, Clamor,
and Evil-speaking be put away from you, with all Malice; and be kind one to
another, and tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God for Christ's sake
has forgiven you: And hereby you will not grieve the holy Spirit, whereby you
are sealed unto the Day of Redemption.

Lastly; Take heed Satan does not deceive thee with a counterfeit Seal. Many
are confident they have the Spirit, Light, and Power, when it is all mere
Delusion. The Spirit always leads and directs according to the written Word: He
shall bring my Word, says Christ, to your remembrance. Some Men boast of the
Spirit, and conclude they have the Spirit, and none but they, and yet at the
same time cry down and vilify his blessed Ordinances and Institutions, which he
has left in his Word, carefully to be observed and kept, till he comes the
second time without Sin unto Salvation.

The Spirit compared to a River.
Psalm. 46.4. There is a River, the Streams whereof make glad the City of God.

John 7.38. He that believes, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living
Water.

Rev. 22.1. And he showed me a pure River of Water of Life, as clear as
Crystal, proceeding out of the Throne of God, and the Lamb, etc.


METAPHOR.
EVery River has a proper Head or Fountain, from whence it does proceed.

II. A River has much Water in it, a Cistern or Vessel will contain but small
quantities; some Rivers contain abundance, and can never be emptied.

III. A River lies open and free to all; every Man that passes by makes use
of a River, if he needs it. Fountains and Conduits are many times sealed, or
locked up, and it is hard to come at Water out of them; but a River does freely
send forth its Streams, that run continually, never cease day nor night.

IV. Many Rivers are very deep. Although in some places they may be so shallow, as
that a Man may wade in them; yet in some other places they are mighty deep and
dangerous, so that none dare adventure into them: Hence Marks and Bounds are
many times set up to give notice.

V. A River is the proper Element of Fishes, and many living Creatures; they
are produced by it, and live in it.

VI. A River is good to wash in, to cleanse, purge, and carry away Filth, and
noxious Pollution.

VII. A River has its Banks to keep it in its proper Bounds, and make it run
in its own Chanel, by which means People know whither to go, if they would
partake of the Benefit of its Waters.

VIII. Some Rivers overflow their Banks at some certain times, and greatly
enrich the Soil, and make it fruitful; as particularly, the River Nilus in
Egypt.

IX. A River is profitable for Commerce, Traffic, and Navigation; it is the
means of Conveyance of the rich Commodities of one Kingdom to another, and of
one City to another; by which means, People, Cities, and Nations are greatly
enriched. What a great Convenience is the River of Thames to the City of
London! By this means also one Friend can soon go to another, and often hear
each from the other.

X. Some Rivers run very swiftly, bear all down before them, are so impetuous,
as they cannot be stopped in their Course and Chanel. A swift Stream washes
away Filth best.

XI. Some Rivers environ Towns, and are instead of other Fortifications to
them, making them strong, and hard to be taken.

XII. A River causes those Trees that are planted by the side of it, to thrive
and grow exceedingly. The Waters softening the Ground, their Roots spread
forth, they flourish; when those that are planted on Heaths, and barren
Mountains, wither and fade away in a Time of Drought.

XIII. A River is very pleasant and delightful, as well as profitable to them
that dwell by it; and they can take their Walks by the sides thereof.

XIV. A River carries, or conveys, by the help of Boats, and other Vessels,
many Things and Persons, (whose Purposes and Intentions are that way steered)
into the Ocean.

XV. Sometimes a River is so still, calm, and quiet, that you cannot discern
any Motion; and then without mere human artificial means, no Ship, Boat, or
Vessel can sail or move along.

XVI. Some Rivers divide one Country or Nation from another.

XVII. After a great Rain, a River rises higher, runs more swift, by reason of
the Land-Floods that come down, and run into it.

XVIII. A River will carry and bear up a Ship of a great Burden, and many
other heavy things; and according as its Waters run, either more slowly or
swiftly, so do those things which sail or swim along in it.

XIX. The Water of a River, and running Streams, is usually more clear and
savoury, than Pools or standing Waters. A River purges it self; and if a
Branch or small Stream runs through a loathsome Ditch, it carries away the
Pollution of it.

XX. The Waters of a River are good to drink, and satisfy Thirst.

Parallel.
THe holy Spirit is said to proceed from the Father: Joh. 15.26
But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,
even the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of
me: It proceeds out of the Throne of God, Rev. 22.1.
and the Lamb.

II. The holy Spirit is called a River, (not a Cistern, not a Vessel) to denote
that Fullness of the Water of Life which is in it, the Abundance of heavenly
Blessings that flow from it; all the Godly in all Ages, from the beginning of
the World, have been supplied from this River: Thousands, and Ten Thousands,
have drawn out of it, have been filled with it, have had their measures of it,
as God in his Wisdom saw good to communicate it to them; yea, and our blessed
Savior received it without measure: And yet the River is as full as ever, in
it self, there is no emptying of it.

III. The holy Spirit is a River that lies open to all poor Sinners: whoever
will may come to these Waters; none are forbidden, no Restraint is laid on any
Soul that desires to have them: I will give freely to him that is thirsty, Rev.
22.
even the Waters of Life. Ho every one that thirsts, Isa. 55.1.
come to the Waters, etc.

IV. This spiritual River is wonderful deep, there is no searching out the
Depths thereof. Romans 8.27
Who knows the mind of the Spirit, but he that searches all things? The
Purposes, Decrees, and secret Ways of the Spirit, are unknown to Men in many
respects, tho some of his Ways, Influences, and Operations are discernible.
Believers may adventure a little way, as far as their Bounds and Limits permit
them. We must not pry too curiously into the Depths of God, he having set
Bounds by the Word how far we should go; and let all take heed on their Peril
that they adventure no further.

V. The holy Spirit is the proper Element of all true Believers; they are born
by the Spirit, live by the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit. Joh. 3*5. Gal. 5.26.
Ministers are Fishers of Men. See the Parable of the Net.

VI. This River is good to wash, purge, and carry away Filth, and all
abominable Pollution of Sin, both in Souls, Churches, and Nations, where the
Water of this River runs: Such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are
sanctified, 1 Cor. 6.11
but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
God.

VII. The Spirit has its proper Bounds, and always runs in its spiritual
Chanel, viz. the Word and Ordinances, God's public and private Worship; and
thither all must have recourse, Exodus 20.24.
that would receive the precious and glorious Blessings and Benefits thereof;
if you would have these sacred Waters, you must observe the Chanel where this
River runs: Acts 2.1, 2, 3.
Where I record my Name, I will come unto thee, and will bless thee. When the
Disciples were assembled together, they met with the Spirit, that being their
Duty, and Christ's Institution.

VIII. This spiritual River has several times overflowed, there being a
Redundancy of Water in it. Great Multitudes have been marvellously watered, and
made fat and fruitful on a sudden, and shall again when the time is come. God
sometimes extends Mercies and Gospel-Blessings beyond his usual method; being a
free Agent, may, if he pleases, anticipate his own Order. He has promised to
open Rivers in the Desert: And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord
shall bear off from the Chanel of the River, unto the Stream of Egypt. God
meets with some, Isa. 27.12.
as he met with Paul, who was running from him. The Scripture speaks of a Time,
when the Knowledge of the Lord shall cover the Earth, as the Waters cover the
Sea. In that day this River shall overflow, and cover the whole World. Isa.
30.25.
There shall be on every high Mountain, and on every high Hill, Rivers, and
Streams of Water. I will open Rivers upon high Places, I will make the
Wilderness a Pool of Water, and the dry Land Springs of Water. Behold, I will
do a new thing, now it shall spring forth, shall ye not know it: I will even
make a Way in the Wilderness, and Rivers in the Desert: Isa. 40.19, 20.
The Beasts of the Field shall honor me, the Dragons, and the Owls; because I
give Waters in the Wilderness, and Rivers in the Desert, to give Drink to my
People, my Chosen.

IX. The holy Spirit is gloriously advantageous for spiritual Commerce and
Traffic. It Is that which, by the use of Ordinances, conveys the Riches of
Heaven to Dwellers here below: He shall receive of mine, and show it unto you:
He will bring all things to your remembrance. It Is the Spirit that stores the
City of God with all its Divine Riches. There is no Trading to Heaven, but by
sailing in this River; Faith can do nothing without it. If these Waters do not
run, our Souls can make no good Return from the Celestial Shore. The Church,
and every Family of the Godly, would soon be starved, were it not for this
heavenly and spiritual River; hence it is said to rejoice the Righteous: There
is a River, the Streams whereof make glad the City of God, the holy Place of
the Tabernacle of the Most High. Psalm. 46.4.
By means of this River we often take a Voyage to our Father, and come to Jesus
Christ, and daily in the Word hear from them: For through him we both have
access by one Spirit to the Father.

X. This spiritual River, as it is deep, so it is very swift, tho it is not always
discerned to be so by us, nor does the Stream indeed seem to us to run always
with a like Motion. But when God does (as it were) open the Floodgates, then
it runs very swift, and is so impetuous, that it drives all down before it:
Lord, Acts 9.6.
said Saul, what would thou have me to do? When God causes its Passage to
be clear, it bears down all Opposition, carries away our slavish Fears, our
Unbelief, our Earthly-mindedness, and all Consultings with Flesh and Blood,
making thereby our Souls very clean, washing us as in a Stream which is very
powerful, carrying away all our great Defilements. It Is not in the Skill of Men
or Devils to stop this River, even the strong Operations of the Spirit, in a
Person, Church, or Nation, when God opens the Sluices for it.

XI. This River is a Believer's Strength: Not by Might, nor by Power, but by my
Spirit, says the Lord. Zech 4.6.
It Is the Churches sure Fortification: When the Enemy comes in like a Flood,
Isa. 59.^^.
the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a Standard against them. Those that are
environed by the Spirit, need not to fear the Stormings of Men or Devils, even
those Churches or Souls, who enjoy the smooth and sweet Streams of this River.

XII. Those Churches or Souls, who enjoy the blessed Streams of this spiritual
River, grow, flourish, and bring forth much Fruit. He shall be like a Tree
planted by the Rivers of Water, Ps^^l. 1.3.
that brings forth his Fruit in due season, his Leaves shall not wither. They
shall spring up as Grass, as Willows by the Watercourse. Isa. 44.4.
Blessed is the Man that trusts in the Lord, Jer. 17 7, 8
whose Hope the Lord is: For he shall be as a Tree planted by the Waters, which
spreads forth his Root by the River, and shall not know when Heat comes, but
her Leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful when the Year of Drought
comes, neither shall cease from yielding Fruit.

XIII. This spiritual and heavenly River yields the Church, and all true
Believers, much Joy and sweet Delight; no Pleasures like those that flow from
the Spirit: The Fruit of the Spirit is Joy, Gal. 5.22.
Peace, etc. And sometimes when they partake of these Celestial Streams, they
are so delighted thereby, that they cannot forbear breaking forth into singing:
There is a River, the Streams whereof make glad the City of God, etc.

XIV. This spiritual River, in the use of the Ordinances and Appointments of
the Gospel, will carry a Soul, whose Purpose and serious Intention is bent that
way, to God, the Ocean of all Fullness, and into the great Depths of everlasting
Bliss.

XV. The Spirit of God sometimes seems not to strive or move at all upon the
Hearts of Men and Women, (not only upon the Wicked, of whom God has said, Genesis
6.
My Spirit shall not always strive with Men); but also the Godly themselves
cannot sometimes perceive a visible or sensible Operation thereof. And then
their Spirits seem like Vessels becalmed; no Duty or Service performed has any
Life or Activity in it, it being only performed by the Strength of natural or
acquired Parts and Abilities.

XVI. This spiritual River divides the Church from the World, Believers from
Unbelievers: For who makes thee to differ from another? 1 Cor. 4.7.
And what have thou which thou did not receive?

XVII. After brokenness of Heart, or a Multitude of unfeigned Tears, and true
Contrition of Soul, how high do the Waters of the Spirit rise? how does Peace
and Joy abound in the inward Man?

XVIII. This spiritual River carries and bears up the weight of the whole
Church, which sails like a Ship along these Waters; and every Saint,
notwithstanding all those heavy Weights of Sin, and other unprofitable
Burdens, that are in and about them, are sustained by these Divine Waters.

XIX. The Spirit is a pure Stream, as clear as Crystal; Rev. 22.1.
its Waters are sweet and savoury, and wheresoever they come, they cleanse and
wash away all Corruption. No Man's Heart, tho it be never so much polluted and
foul, like a stinking Ditch, yet if a small Stream or Branch of this River be
let into it, 1 Cor. 6.11.
and has a free Passage, it will carry away all the Filth and Pollution
thereof.

XX. The Waters of this River are exceeding good for the Soul to drink, and
nothing else can allay or satisfy the inward Thirst and Desire thereof. Joh.
4.13, 14.




METAPHOR.
ALL earthly and elementary Rivers have a beginning.

II. Other Rivers are fed by Springs or Fountains, etc. They have not their
Waters from themselves; a River is not the same Head or Original from whence it
proceeds.

III. Other Rivers are subject to decay, do not always run with the same
Strength; a dry Summer makes abatement of its Waters; many Rivers have been
quite dried up: God threatened the Egyptians, Isa. 11.15.
that he would deal so with the River Nilus.

IV. The Waters of natural Rivers only cleanse and wash the Body from external
Filthiness.

V. Other Rivers may grow muddy, foul, and unsavory, the Water not good, nor
wholesome to drink of.

VI. Other Rivers may be locked up, or turned another way; it is possible to
turn the Chanel and Course thereof. Many Rivers have been made to forsake their
ancient Currents. This goodly River, which feeds London, may be locked up, and
turned another way by an Enemy.

VII. Other Rivers may be frozen up; tho running Streams do not freeze so soon
as standing Waters, yet sometimes they freeze also.

VIII. Other Rivers breed noxious Creatures, of strange and different
Qualities, Creatures that will eat and devour one another.

IX. The Length, Breadth, and Depth of other Rivers may be measured, and are of
a small dimension comparatively.

Disparity.
THis River, the Spirit, is from everlasting to everlasting, without beginning,
and without ending.

II. This River, the Spirit, is a Fountain as well as a Stream; tho it is said
to proceed from God, yet it is God himself. But Peter said to Ananias, Why has
Satan filled thine Heart, to lie to the Holy Ghost? Act 5.3, 4.
Thou have not lied to Man, but to God. There are three that bear Record in
Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these Three are One. 1 John 5.7.
The Spirit of the Lord has made me, etc. The Spirit knows all things,
shows us things to come, Job 33.4.
is the Object of Divine Worship; the Sin against the Spirit can never be
forgiven. From all which Instances, it is evident that the Spirit is God. See
the Metaphor Light, Book 3. page 22, 23, 24.

III. This River, the Spirit, never decays; it has as much Water in it as
ever it had; it is as broad, as deep, and as full now as it was at the
beginning, tho many Thousands have taken plentifully of it. No Drought can
abate its Crystal Streams; it is infinite in it self. Tho God has provided a
Chanel of Ordinances, to convey some of its Waters to his Chosen, yet it cannot
be circumscribed nor limited, as it is in it self.

IV. The Water of this River cleanses the Soul and Conscience; it washes away
all spiritual or internal Pollution and Uncleanness.

V. This spiritual River can never be foul'd, nor made muddy, nor be unsavory;
it is beyond the Power of Men or Devils, to corrupt the Spirit of God.

VI. The River of the Spirit cannot be diverted, or forced to leave its Chanel.
It Is impossible to lock it up, or turn its Course. How can Men of finite
Beings, obstruct the infinite God in his ways and manner of working? Psalm. 13.97
Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? I will work, and who shall let it?

VII. This River can never be frozen. The bleakest Wind, the sharpest Air, the
coldest Season, cannot change it. These Divine Waters run as freely in the cold
Winter, as in the Heat of Summer; they are of a very warming and comforting
quality.

VIII. This Spiritual River brings forth only Creatures of a harmless
Quality. All Believers, so far as they are regenerated, are the Production or
Offspring of the Spirit, and are of the same holy, heavenly, merciful, and
harmless Disposition.

IX. This River is of great dimension: Who by searching can find out God to
Perfection? His Length, Breadth, and Depth, are past finding out. The Spirit is
incomprehensible, an immense and infinite Being. These Waters are like those
spoken of by the Prophet: Afterward he measured a thousand Cubits, and it was
a River that I could not pass over, Ezekiel. 47.5
for the Waters were risen, Waters to swim in, a River that no Man could pass
over.



Inferences.
WE may perceive from hence the Excellency and Necessity of the holy Spirit: He
is much more useful and necessary to the Church, than Rivers of Waters are to
the World: For our Hearts are naturally dry and parched, like the Heath in the
Wilderness, and it is the Spirit that moistneth them; our Hearts are hard, and
the Spirit mollifieth them; they are naturally filthy, and he washes and
cleanses them; yea, our Hearts are barren, and the Waters of this River make
them fruitful.

II. It also shows us the Excellency of Ordinances, which are as the Chanel
in which the Waters of this River run, or the Pipes through which these Streams
are conveyed to the Soul.

III. Bless God for this River, for his opening a free Passage through Jesus
Christ, for its flowing forth unto us, and for causing us, the People of
England, to live by the side of such a Crystal Stream. O what a happy Land is
that, which has a River of Water of Life running through it!

IV. When you see profitable and delightful Streams, think seriously of this
sacred and heavenly River.

V. Let all be persuaded to come to this River: Ho^^ every one that thirsts,
come to the Waters, Isa. 55.1.
etc.

Four Motives considerable.
1. Consider, have you not great need to have your Hearts purged and softened by
this Spiritual River? etc.

2. There is no other River, no other Way, no other Fountain, that can supply
your Wants. If you wash your selves with Snow-Water, it will not do away your
Filth; if you could bathe your Souls in a River of Tears, yet unless you are
washed in Christ's Blood through the Spirit, your Sin will cleave to you.

3. This River is large enough; and yet as it is large, it is free. All may come
and partake of these Waters; Rev. 22.17.
none are excepted: Whoever will may come, and take of the Waters of Life
freely.

4. This River is near, the Streams thereof run by your Doors.

VI. Moreover, from hence let Professors try themselves, whether they have been
washed and bathed in this River, and have tasted of its Waters, yea or no.

Art thou mollified? Is thy Heart made tender? Art thou cleansed? Is thy Life
and Heart made holy? Art thou healed of the Sores and Wounds of Sin? These
Waters have a healing Virtue in them; Ephesians. ^^.18.
they will heal a wounded Spirit, a gauled Conscience; they are good to clear
the Sight, causing one to see far off. Are the Eyes of thy Understanding
enlightened? Do thou prize the Ordinances of God, that convey these Waters of
Life unto thy Soul? Is the Water of this R^^ver sweet to thy Taste? Is this
River thy chief Element? Do thou live in the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit?

VII. When you remove from one Place to another, from one Country to another,
from one Land to another, be sure to plant your selves near the Chanel of this
River, go not from these Waters: Labor to live near the Ordinances of God,
and where the Water of Life is to be had.

VIII. Pray fervently, that God would never turn the Course of this River
another way. What would become of God's Church in England, were it not for
this Crystal Stream?



The Holy-Spirit compared to Water.
Ezekiel. 36.25. Then will I sprinkle clean Water upon you, etc.

Joh. 7.38, 39. He that believes on me, as the Scripture has said, out of his
Belly shall flow Rivers of living Water. But this spoke he of the Spirit, which
they that believe on him, should receive, etc.


In both these places, and diverse others, the Holy Spirit is compared to Water.

METAPHOR.
WAter for its rise, is from the Ocean; thence it comes, and thither it returns.

II. Water cleanses from Filth and Pollution. Clothes and other things that are
defiled, are usually washed and made clean in Water. It is indeed the Bath of
Nature, which the God of Nature has appointed for the cleansing of things or
Creatures that are polluted.

III. Water has a cooling Virtue, it cools the Earth after a vehement hot and
parching Season; so the sweating Travellor cools himself by washing in Water.
When the Sun by its scorching Beams, has made a Room hot, wash it with Water,
and it is brought immediately into a cool Temper.

IV. Water makes the Earth fruitful, it is of a fructifying nature. How barren?
how unprofitable is it in a great Drought? The Grass fades, withers, and is
dried up: but when a soaking Shower falls upon it, how green and flourishing is
it immediately made thereby.

V. Water softens and mollifies the Earth. David speaking of the Earth, says,
Thou waterest the Ridges thereof, Psalm. 65.10
and make it soft with Showers.

VI. Water has a healing Virtue in it. Some great Wounds have been healed only
by washing in Water. Some Waters in England are sovereign good to cure many
Distempers and Diseases of the Body, Joh. 5.2.3, 4.
like the Pool called Bethesda.

VII. Water is so necessary a thing, that we cannot live without it, many have
perished for want of it.

VIII. Water is good to quench ones Thirst, to allay the heat of our Stomachs,
and to satisfy the longing Desire, and remove the intolerable Pains that rise
from an excess of Drought.

IX. Water is free and cheap, easy to come at, it does not cost us much, it is a
common Element, none are barred from it.

X. Water is necessary to quench Fire; when by Treachery of Enemies, our Houses
have been set on fire over our Heads, how serviceable have we found Water to be
to quench it!

Parallel.
THe Spirit flows from God, the Ocean of all Fullness. But when the Comforter is
come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth,
which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me. Joh. 15.26.

II. The Spirit of God purges and washes the Conscience from the horrid
Defilement of Sin. I will sprinkle clean Water upon you, and ye shall be clean
from your Filthiness. And such were some of you, 1 Cor. 6.11.
but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of
our Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. The Spirit cleanses, by applying
Christ's Blood, and by creating clean Dispositions in the Soul. See River.

III. The Spirit has a cooling Virtue in it. The Heart of a Man, is subject to
great Heats, sometimes its sweltered with Temptation. Satan by shooting his
fiery Darts, puts a Believer into violent Heats. Psalm. 42.1, 7.
As the Heart is by the Hunter put in a foaming Sweat, and brays after the
Water-brook; so Satan, that Blood-Hound, makes the Soul thirst after the Water
of Life. Sometimes Men are put into great Heats by prevailing and raging
Corruptions; They are (says the Lord) as an Oven heated by the Baker. Hos.
7.6, 7
The Spirit cools this Heat, partly by subduing the lustings of the Flesh, and
partly by strengthening the renewed part. Jesus Christ opens the Oven of a
distempered Heart; and by casting the Water of the Spirit upon it, brings it
into a cooler Temper. Acts 9.
When Saul was in that hot and raging Heat, to shed the Blood of the Saints,
the Spirit quickly allays his Rage and Fury.

IV. The Spirit where e're it falls, makes the Soul fruitful. Men's Hearts
naturally are barren, and like the parched Heath in the Desert; but when this
sacred Rain comes down upon them, they quickly look green, and in a glorious
manner fructify and bring forth the Fruits of Righteousness; as appears in the
Case of Zacheus, no sooner did he receive of this divine Water, and Salvation
was come to his House, but he cries out, Half my Goods I give to the Poor. Acts
9.


V. The Spirit softens the hard and flinty Heart, by applying the Blood of
Christ. No sooner does the Water of the Spirit come down upon a stubborn and
rocky-hearted Sinner, but he is made tender and pliable thereby. Lord, (says
Soul) what will thou have me do? Acts 9.6.
He was soft, mollified, and melted, willing to do what ever the Will and
Pleasure of God was.

VI. The Spirit heals all the Wounds and Diseases of the Soul. Lord, Psalm. 41.5.
be merciful unto me, and heal my Soul (says David) for I have sinned against
thee. Psalm. 107.20.
He sent forth his Word and healed them. No Soul that ever took down one
draught of these Waters, but was cured of whatsoever Disease he had. It
searches to the bottom of every Sore, and purges out the Corruption, and then
by applying the Blood of Christ it heals the Soul of all its Wounds perfectly.

VII. The spirit is of absolute necessity, without it we cannot live to God,
cannot live the Life of Faith, the Life of Holiness; many perish and are utterly
lost for want of the Spirit, for not coming to these Waters.

VIII. The Spirit of God allays that great Drought that is in Men and Women
naturally after perishing things. Joh. 4.14.
But whosoever that drinks of the Water that I shall give him, shall never
thirst, etc. It greatly satisfies the spiritual Desires of the Soul, giving
Peace, inward Contentment and Joy through believing.

IX. The Spirit and the Blessings thereof are free. Ho, every one that
thirsts, Isa. 55.1.
come ye to the Waters. Whoever will, Rev. 22.17.
let him take of the Water of Life freely.

X. The Spirit quenches the Fire of Lust, the Fire of Pride, the Fire of
Passion, which Satan and our own treacherous Hearts are ready at every turn to
kindle in us, and which would, were it not for this sacred Water, burn and
consume our Souls, and bring us to utter Desolation.



METAPHOR.
OTher Water many times does prove prejudicial to the Body; when it is received
at certain times too freely, it surfeits, and indangers the Life.

II. Waters, (whether taken in the common Acceptance, elementary Water, or
cordial Waters or Spirits prepared by Art) are not Waters of Life; no Water can
beget Life, nor give Life to the Dead.

III. Water may be defiled, made muddy, and become unwholesome and unfit to
drink or wash in.

Disparity.
THe Spirit never hurts any who drink thereof, though in never so great a heat;
you may freely take down this Water, and not be hurt thereby, it surfeits none,
no danger of drinking to excess here.

II. The Spirit is called the Spirit of Life, and Water of Life, and may fitly
be so termed. 1. Because it begets spiritual Life in all poor dead Sinners. 2.
Because it maintains Life: that which gives Life and Being to us, as we are Men
or Christians, preserves the same, Whether it be natural or spiritual. 3.
Because it makes the Hearts of Christians lively, and increases Life in them.
4. It Is called Water of Life, because it brings unto everlasting Life. Joh.
4.14.
The Water that I will give him, shall be in him, a Well of Water, springing up
into Everlasting Life.

III. The Spirit ever remains pure, and admits of no Filth; it is impossible to
defile this Water, or make it unfit for the Souls of Sinners. See River.



Inferences.
FRom hence we may infer, that those who have not received of the Spirit, or
drank of this sacred Water, have no spiritual Life in them. Rom 8.9.
If any Man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. Those that have
not this clean Water sprinkled upon them, their Filthiness remains.

II. What Fools are those Men, who refuse to drink of the Water of Life? it is
but drinking, and live for ever!

III. Be exhorted to pray earnestly, long for, and endeavor after a
Participation of the Spirit. How ready are Men and Women to go to this Well and
that Well to drink Water, for the help and healing of Bodily Distempers, go
many Miles, dispense with all other Affairs, that they may be recovered of
external Diseases: But how few inquire after the Water of Life? or leave all
their secular Business for the good and health of their immortal Souls? To
persuade you to acccept of a word of Counsel, take these few Motives.

You are invited; Ho, every one that thirsts, come ye to the Waters, etc.
Isa. 55.1.
These Waters are free, you may have them, if you have a Heart and Will in you
to them; the Well is open, and Christ stands with his Arms spread forth to call
and embrace you. Joh. 7.37.
If any Man thirst, let him come to me and drink.

The Holy-Spirit a Witness.
1 John 5.6, 10. It is the Spirit that bears Witness, because the Spirit is
Truth. He that believes on the Son of God, has the Witness within himself.

Romans 8.16. The Spirit it self bears Witness with our Spirit, etc.

Romans 9.1. My Conscience also bears me Witness in the Holy Ghost, etc.


A Witness is absolutely necessary for the keeping up of Justice, deciding of
all Matters of Moment, or to the putting an end to Controversies that may arise
between Parties; and for the confirming and establishment of Truth.

METAPHOR.
WItness imports something to be done, that is to be attested when it shall be
required, or when there is need of it.

II. A good Witness is a just and impartial Person, one that will tell only the
Truth.

III. A good and faithful Witness decides Controversies upon Trial the right
way.

IV. One Witness is not sufficient to the deciding of some Differences, in some
Cases there should be more than one Witness. In the mouth of two or three
Witnesses, shall every Word be established.

V. A Witness is highly esteemed, and his Testimony prized by a Man falsely
accused, when his Life lies at stake thereby; especially when such clear
Evidence is given in for the Defendant, that tends to the clearing up his
Innocence and absolutely to acquit him, and to his great Honor, set him at
liberty, notwithstanding those cruel and false Accusations of his Enemy.

VI. A good Witness many times gives in such clear Proof and Circumstances, to
the deciding of Controversies and ending Differences, that the Matter appears
exceeding plain in the sight of all Persons.

VII. A good and faithful Witness brings a Man sometimes off triumphantly, that
all were ready to conclude was a dead Man.

VIII. A Witness is so necessary to confirm Bonds, Contracts and solemn
Covenants that they are not looked upon Authentic, and good in Law without.

Parallel.
THere is something done by Christ for us, and in us, which it is needful there
be a Witness of, to confirm and establish both. (1.) Whatever the Lord Jesus
did in the days of his Flesh, as the sent one of the Father, was born witness
to by the Holy Spirit, by those mighty Works which were done by the means and
power thereof. (2.) The Lord Jesus has also done great things in those who do
believe the Truth, of which the Holy Spirit bears Witness.

II. The Holy Spirit is a just and impartial Witness. 1 John 3.6.
The Spirit bears Witness, because the Spirit is Truth.

III. So the Holy Spirit decides and ends the great doubt that arises in the
Heart about the work of Grace the right way; will not speak Peace to him to
whom it does not appertain; will not clear the Guilty, ( viz.) him that
believes not, notwithstanding his seeming Zeal, Holiness, etc. nor condemn the
holy and sincere Person, notwithstanding the Weaknesses and Infirmities of his
Life.

IV. So in the great case of Interest or no Interest in Jesus Christ, or about
Faith and Regeneration, there must be two or three Witnesses, no more is
required. First, The Spirit of God. And secondly, Our Spirit, or the Testimony
of our own Conscience. The Spirit it self bears Witness with our Spirits,
Romans 8.16
that we are the Children of God.

V. When the Spirit of God, with a Man's own Conscience, gives in Evidence for
him touching his Sincerity, when accused by Satan and by wicked Men, and
rendered as a vile Hypocrite, as Job was, it does clear him and makes his Heart
light; and how does he prize and esteem of such a Friend? Alas! had not a
Christian the Witness in himself, to clear and bear up his Soul, he would sink
down many times into utter Despondency: but this made holy Job to triumph over
all his Enemies; Behold, Job 16.19
my Witness is in Heaven, and my Record is on high. As much as if he should
say, though many Witnesses are against me, yet I will keep my Conscience clear,
I will not have my own Heart to charge me, or witness against me as long as I
live.

VI. So the Holy Ghost gives in such clear Demonstration and Proof to the
clearing up of a Man's Evidence for Heaven, that when all Cases are clearly
considered, a poor Saint, though doubtful before, comes to a good and full
Satisfaction therein, God's Spirit and Conscience compares a Man's State with
the Word of God; and if upon Trial, it appears that those Qualifications are
wrought in his Heart, that the Word expressly mentions, concerning the Truth of
Grace, he then finds he has no more cause to doubt of the goodness of his
Condition.

VII. So the Holy Spirit and Conscience bring off a Christian with abundance of
holy Joy and Triumph, notwithstanding his Case may seem very dangerous by means
of strong Accusations of Satan, 2 Cor. 1.11, 12.
as it was with Job; For this is our rejoicing, the Testimony of our
Conscience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, we have had our
Conversation in the World, etc.

VII. So the Spirit or God confirms the Covenant of Grace to the Soul of a
Believer, for when the true Fear of God is wrought in the Heart, the Spirit
witnesses to it, and thereby assures us, that all the Promises that are made
therein, are undoubtedly our own, and shall be performed to us.



Inference.
HOw happy is the State of the Godly? what good Assurance have they of Eternal
Life? they have received an Earnest of it, it is sealed unto them, and they
have two infallible Witnesses to confirm it to them. See Conscience a Witness.

The Holy-Spirit a Teacher.
Luke 12.12. For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought
to say.

Joh. 14.26. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in my Name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all thing to your
Remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.


THe Holy Spirit is the great Teacher of the Church, and every particular Saint
and Member thereof, unto whom the Accomplishment of that great Promise is
committed; And they shall be all taught of God: Joh. 6.45.

Teacher.
A Teacher is a personal Appellation.

II. A Teacher implies one or more, that needs Instruction, or Teaching; it
argues Weakness of Knowledge and want of Understanding in some Persons, about
such things, they ought to be well instructed in.

III. It behooves an able Teacher to have great Knowledge and Understanding
himself, in all those Things and Mysteries he instructs others in.

IV. A spiritual and able Teacher opens diverse dark, deep, hidden, and
mysterious things to the Understandings of Men.

V. A divine and able Teacher by this means greatly inlightneth the World, and
causes Darkness and Ignorance to fly away, enriching Men's Minds with the
precious Knowledge of sacred Truths.

VI. An able Teacher instructs ignorant Persons by degrees, as they are able
to take in, conceive and apprehend things, first to read the a, b, c, and then
the Bible, and afterward the Grammar, or any other Things of Learning they
desire to be instructed in.

VII. Some Teachers teach their Scholars out of a Book; their great Business is
to help them rightly, and distinctly to understand that.

VIII. A Teacher exercises much Patience toward them whom he instructs;
especially when he meets with such that are very dull and unapt to learn, he is
forced to take much Pains with them.

IX. Some Teachers, tho very deserving, have been greatly slighted by those
very Persons they have showed much Love to, and taken great Pains with for
their good, which has sorely grieved them.

X. Some Teachers, after they have found those, whom they were employed to
teach and instruct, grown to such a great degree of Stubborness and Obstinacy,
that they have utterly despised and refused to betaught by them, and have cast
all Counsel behind their Backs; then they have left them, and wholly given them
up as hopeless Persons.

XI. Godly Teachers are so great a Blessing to People, that it is a great Loss
to lose them; nay, a sore and lamentable Judgment upon the Church and the World
to be deprived of, or have their Tea-chers taken away from them or forced into
a Corner.

Parallel.
THe Holy Ghost is a Divine Person. See Comforter.

II. There is no Man whatsoever but needs the Divine Teaching and Instruction
of the Holy Ghost; For what Man knows the things of a Man, save the Spirit of
a Man which is in him? Even so the things of God knows no Man, but the Spirit
of God. 1 Cor. 2.11.

III. The Holy Ghost has great Knowledge, yea, he is infinite in Understanding,
there is nothing that he is ignorant of, that either concerns God's Honor, or
our Good; The Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God. 1 Cor.
2.10.


IV. The Holy Ghost opens many dark, and deep Mysteries: what hidden
Mysteries did he reveal to the Prophets, and open and unfold to the blessed
Apostles? Which in other Ages were not made known unto the Sons of Men, Ephesians.
3.3.
as is now revealed unto the Apostles and Prophets by the Spirit.

V. The Holy Ghost inspiring, and teaching the Prophets and Apostles (who were
the holy Penmen of the sacred Scripture) has greatly enlightened the
Inhabitants of the Earth, where their Record is known, and also when he has
opened the Eyes of the Understandings of Men in those profound and glorious
Mysteries contained in the holy Scripture, how are their minds enriched with
the Knowledge of divine Truths?

VI. The Holy Ghost teaches and instructs poor Sinners gradually, first the
a, b, c, of Religion, viz. the Knowledge of Sin, and their lost and undone
Condition thereby; the Vanities of this World, together with the necessity of a
Savior: and then in the second Place, he instructs them in higher Mysteries,
opening and explaining the Covenant of Grace, as also the glorious Mystery of
Union and Communion with God, the Mystery of the Trinity, the Incarnation of
Christ, his Priesthood, and other things relating to him as Mediator; together
with many dark Sayings and Prophecies of the Scripture, which those who are
unlearned, 1 Pet. 3.16.
( viz. who have not the Spirit's teachings) wrest unto their own Destruction:
I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.

VII. So the Holy Ghost teaches Sinners the Knowledge of the Scriptures: for as
the Spirit gave them forth so he is the best Interpreter of them: Luke 24.45
Then opened be their Understandings, that they might understand the
Scriptures. He shall teach you all things, Joh. 14.26.
and shall bring my Words to your Remembrance; he shall take of mine and show
it unto you etc. that is, he shall open and explain my Word and Doctrine to
you. How ignorant are some Men of the Scriptures, and of those glorious
Mysteries contained therein? notwithstanding all their humane Learning (or that
Knowledge they have of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin) for want of the Spirit's
Teaching.

VIII. So the Holy Ghost exercises much Patience toward Sinners, whom he
comes to teach and instruct in the way of Salvation; Mankind being generally
very dull and unapt to learn the Knowledge of themselves, Sin, Christ, and
Salvation; therefore he drops now a Word, and then a Word for their Conviction.

IX. So many Men that the Holy Ghost has showed much Love unto, and labored
greatly with, have notwithstanding slighted and disregarded all his Counsel and
Instruction; like as Israel did of old: Thou gave them thy good Spirit to
instruct them, Neh. 9.20.
and withheld not thy Manna from their Mouth, etc.

X. So the Holy Ghost, who labored to instruct the old World, finding they
were grown to a fearful degree of Hardness, Rebellion, and Obstinacy, utterly
refusing to return or be reformed, after he had waited many Years upon them,
left them to perish in their Sins God declaring sometimes before the Flood came
upon them, Genesis 6.3.
That his Spirit should not always strive with Man: and in like manner the
Spirit deals with stubb^^rn, obstinate Sinners; for after long-waiting and
abused Patience, he leaves them and gives them utterly up to their own Heart's
Lust, and to walk in their own Counsel.

XI. The Holy Ghost is such a great Blessing to the Church and People of God,
nay, and unto Sinners too, that there can come no greater Judgment upon them,
than to be deprived of this sacred and heavenly Teacher, tho it is sad with the
Church, Dr. Owen.
When her Teachers are removed into a Corner, and her Eyes see them not; yet we
had better lose all other Teachers, and that utterly, than lose this great
Teacher only; for tho he is pleased to make use of them, he can teach
effectually and savingly without them, were they removed and taken away; but
they cannot teach without him unto the least spiritual Advantage; and those who
pretend to be Teachers of others, and yet despise his Teaching-Assistance, will
once find they undertook a Work which was none of theirs.



Inferences.
IS the Holy Ghost the great Teacher? how dare any then reproach and villify
him, or slight his Teaching, or those who are lead and instructed by him?

2. It may also stir up all Persons to a readiness and willingness of Heart,
and Mind to be taught and instructed by him.

Quest. How may we know, say some, the Spirit's Teachings? who are they that
are taught and instructed by him?

Answ. This you may take as an undoubted Truth, that The Spirit never teaches
any thing contrary to the written Word because so the World might be at a
certainty about a good and true Teacher in matters of Religion; the Spirit has
left us the holy Scripture, and he always teaches as that teaches, opening
and explaining what dark and obscure things are contained therein; so that he
that walks faithfully up to the written Word, is lead and taught by the
Spirit.

Quest. But does not the Apostle say, We have an Unction from the holy One, 1 John, 2.20, 27.
and know all things, and need not that any Man teach us? We need no other
Teacher therefore but the Spirit.

Answ. That is a great Mistake, and apparent wresting of the Text; for the
Spirit of God, that holy Unction, was in the Primitive Saints in a more
glorious measure than he is in any now; and yet Christ called forth and
ordained diverse other Teachers for them, who were to build them up in their
most holy Faith; 2 Timothy 2.2.
And the things (says Paul to Timothy) that thou have heard of me, among many
Witnesses, the same commit thou to Faithful Men, who shall be able to teach
others also? A Gospel Ministry is to abide till Christ's second Coming, they
are appointed for the gathering together, building up and perfecting of the
Saints, until we all come into the Unity of the Faith, Ephesians. 4.
and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, etc. Therefore the
meaning of the Holy Ghost in that Place is this, We need not that any Man teach
us, but as that Anointing teaches; if any Man teach us such and such things
that are not written; things that the Spirit never taught, in the Word of God,
we ought not to hearken to them; we need no Teaching but that which is
according to the Spirit's Teachings, and agreeable to its Blessed Rule, left
upon Record, viz. the Holy Scriptures of Truth.

The Holy-Spirit compared to a Dove.
Mat. 3.16. And he saw the Spirit of God descending like a Dove, and lighted on
him.


The Holy-Spirit is represented by a Dove, or appeared in the shape of a Dove,
and may in some things be resembled thereto.

Simile.
A Dove is a Bodily Substance, or has a Subsistence of his own.

II As at the beginning of the Creation, says a Reverend Divine, Dr. Owen.
the Spirit, (...) incubabat, came and fell on the Waters, cherished the whole,
and communicating a prolifick and vivifick Quality unto it, as a Fowl or Dove
in particular gently moves it self upon its Eggs, until with, and by its
generative Warmth it has communicated vital Heat unto them.

III. A Dove is a meek, harmless, and innocent Creature; Be ye as harmless as
Doves.

IV. A Dove has a quick, sharp Sight or Eye, as it is hinted, Cant. 1.6. chap.
4.1.

V. A Dove brought Tidings to Noah of the ceasing of the Flood of Waters, and
so consequently, that the Wrath of God was abated likewise.

VI. A Dove is a most swift Creature: hence David cries out, O that I had the
Wings of a Dove! Psalm. 55.6.
then would I fly away, and be at rest.

Parallel.
SO the Holy Ghost has a personal Existence, It was (...), a bodily Shape, and
that (...) of a Dove.

II. So now (says he) at the Entrance of the new Creation, the Spirit comes as
a Dove upon Christ, who was the immediate Author of it, and virtually comprised
it in himself, carrying it on by virtue of his Presence with him; and so this
is applied in the Syriack Ritual of Baptism, composed by Severinus; And the
Spirit of Holiness descended, flying in the likeness of a Dove, and rested upon
him, and moved on the Waters.

III. So the Holy Spirit is of a most sweet, meek, pure and Dove-like
Disposition, the Perfection of all excellent Qualities being in him, as well as
upon the Dove Christ, as he was figured forth thereby.

IV. The Holy Spirit has a quick and sharp Sight, can discern the very
Thoughts and Intents of the Heart; what can be hid from his Eyes, Heb. 4.13*
before whom all things lie naked and bare?

V. So in the Assumption of this Form, there may be some respect had to Noah's
Dove, signifying Peace and Reconciliation by Christ, and the ceasing of the
Wrath of God to all those who shall fly to the Lord Jesus, and rest upon him by
a lively Faith.

VI. The Holy Ghost is swift; God is said to fly upon the Wings of the Wind;
the Spirit is God, and the Flight of the Dove, says Reverend Blackwood, Mr.
Blackwood on Mat. 3. p. 85.
denotes the divine Influence of the Spirit coming from Heaven into the Members
of Christ, as well as into the Head; the Holy Ghost can quickly come to the Aid
and Succor of a Believer, when in Trouble or beset with Temptation, or to
strengthen him when, he has any great Work and Business to do for God. That
Spirit appeared like a Dove, and yet the Learned tell us, it was of a fiery
Color, and we must not think this Substance, says Mr. Blackwood, or Body
resembled by a Dove, to be hypostatically united to the Holy Spirit, as the
humane Nature of Christ is to the divine: but as Angels appeared oft-times to
Men in humane Bodies, and laid them down again; so did the Holy Ghost.



The Holy Spirit the Saints Guide.
Joh. 16.13. He will guide you into all Truth, etc.

Romans 8.14. As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.


The Spirit is the Saints Guide.

Guide.
A Guide is very necessary for Strangers in a Wilderness, where there are many
ways and turnings.

II. An eminent and able Guide is well skilled in all ways, and able to give
Directions in the most difficult Cases that are very hard to find out.

III. A faithful Guide gives notice of all the Dangers that are in the way, and
shows also how a poor Travellor may escape them, and so go safe unto his
desired Place.

IV. An able Guide frees a Man, that commits himself to his Guidance, from many
Cares and Fears that attend such who have lost their Way, and have no Guide.

V. An able and faithful Guide gives plain and full Direction to the ignorant,
so that they cannot well miss the way, if so be they exactly follow his
Directions.

Parallel.
SO the Guidance of the Holy Spirit, as it is contained in the Holy Scripture,
is necessary to Believers whilst they pass through the Wilderness of this
World, where one says this is the way, and another that.

II. So the Holy Spirit is able to guide poor Sinners in all the ways of God;
he led Moses and the Prophets under the Law, and led the Apostles and all the
Primitive Christians, under the Gospel-Ministration. Holy Men of God spoke as
they were moved and guided by the Holy Spirit. 2 Pet. 2.21
There is no Precept nor Promise of God needful for the Children of Men to be
instructed in, but the Spirit in the holy Scripture has left it upon Record
for our Direction and Consolation; and whatsoever is hard to be understood,
that is contained therein; The Spirit that searches all things, can open and
explain it to a gracious Soul: the Spirit guides in the way of Morality, in the
way of Faith and Gospel-Obedience, in the way of Church-Constitution and
Discipline, and in Gospel-Holiness and Conversation.

III. The Holy Spirit has in the Holy Scripture (for in that is contained all
the Directions of the Spirit, touching all matters and cases necessary to
alvation) given notice to all Spiritual Travellors of all the Dangers that may
attend them in the way to Heaven. First, the Danger of Unregeneracy, the common
Road that most Men and Women walk in; the Spirit^^ has told us positively,
Joh. 3.3.
if we go in that way, we shall perish for ever: Except a Man be born again, he
cannot see the Kingdom of God. Secondly, The great Danger of the way of
Presumption. Thirdly, The Danger of Despair. Fourthly, The Danger of Idolatry,
Heresy, and Error. Fifthly, The Danger of Disobedience to Christ's Commands,
Acts 3.22.23. Sixthly, The Danger of loving or liking of any one Sin.
Seventhly, The Danger of Hypocrisy. Eighthly, The Danger of Apostasy, etc.

IV. So the Holy Spirit frees a poor Saint from many Fears and Cares (which
attend others) whilst he wholly commits himself to the Guidance of God's Word,
and to the Directions of the Spirit: many are at a loss, and know not what to
do, nor which way to go, whilst he rests satisfied, resolving to go wholly by
this Guide.

V. So the Holy Spirit in the Scripture of Truth, has given such plain and
clear Directions in all Cases of moment about Faith and Holiness, that the
ignorant and unlearned cannot miss the way to Heaven, if they carefully observe
the Rules laid down therein.



Guide
OTher Guides, tho very skilful, and have good Knowledge of a way or matter they
undertake to guide Men in, may, notwithstanding in some things, miss; being not
infallible, cannot give infallible Demonstrations to all doubtful Persons that
they are right, and that those who follow their Directions, shall never go
astray.

Disparity.
BUT the Holy Spirit in such a glorious manner, by many Signs and Wonders, so
confirmed the way to Heaven, (as they are recorded in the Holy Scripture) that
those that follow his Counsel, shall not go astray; he is an infallible Guide,
and never imposed any Rules, Laws, or Precepts upon Men, but left such
convincing Evidence of the Truth of his Testimony, that there remains no just
ground for a Doubt or Objection; as might be showed in respect of the giving
forth both of the Law and Gospel: therefore those who pretend they are led by
the Spirit or Inspiration, and yet cannot prove and demonstrate what they say
to be true, by such ways and means that no Deceiver can pretend unto, or do the
like, etc. lie, and abuse the Holy Ghost, who is a certain and infallible Guide.



Inferences.
BLess God for this Spiritual Guide in matters of Faith and Practice, and that
there are such sure Rules left by him in the written Word. What should we have
done, had God never afforded us such a Teacher and Guide as the Holy Ghost is?

1. For Man naturally is blind; I will lead the Blind in ways they knew not,
etc.

2. There are many By-ways, and were there not one sure and perfect Guide, how
could a Man find his way? It is as easy for one Man to say he is led by the
Spirit and Inspiration, as it is for another; and how shall a Man (were it not
for the Word) know which of them is in the right?

3. Some pretend they are led by the Spirit, and they walk quite contrary to
the Scripture, which contains all the Truth of God necessary to be known, 2 Timothy 3.16, 17. Joh. 16.13.
believed and practiced in order to Salvation: He shall guide you into all
Truth, he shall bring my Word to your Remembrance.

Quest. How shall we know who follows the Spirit's Guidance?

Answ. Art thou led to repent, to leave thy Sins, to believe in Christ, to obey
his Commands, to live a godly Life, to keep a good Conscience toward God, and
toward Men? these are part of those things the Spirit guides Men in, Romans 8.14
and such who thus live, are led by the Spirit of God, and are the Sons of God.

THE Word of God Compared To LIGHT. The Fourth Head of Metaphors, Allegories,
Similitudes, and other borrowed Terms in Scripture; that relate to the most
Sacred Word of GOD.
Psalm. 119.105. Thy Word is a Lamp unto my feet, and a Light unto my path.

2 Pet. 1.19. We have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well
that ye take heed, as unto a light that shines in a Dark place, etc.

2 Cor. 4.4, 6. Least the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ who is the
Image of God should shine upon them, etc.


In handling this Metaphor we will (1.) Show what Light is. (2.) Give its
various acceptations. (3.) Run the Parallel, and largely open the Properties of
Gospel Light; Concluding with Practical Improvements upon that and some
Dependant and Collateral Points.

LIght properly taken, is thus defined, Lux est claritas seu splendour in
Corpore luminoso, vel extra a corpore luminoso exiens -- that is, Light is a
Clarity, Brightness or Splendour in a luminous body, or proceeding from it --.
It is called in Hebrew (...) ( Or) from whence comes the Greek (...), cerno, to
behold, which cannot be done, but where there is light --. The Hebrew word
(...) Maor is properly a lightsome or lucid body, as the Sun, Moon, Stars, Genesis
1.14, 15, The Greeks call it (...); Matthew. 17.2. Act. 26.23. the Latins lux
and lumen --. It is threefold, viz. there is a Natural light, a light of Grace,
and a light of Glory; the first is common to all that have the Sense of Seeing,
the second to Believers only on Earth, the third to the Saints and glorified
Spirits in Heaven.

The second sort of which we treat, proceeds from Christ who is called the
light Joh. 1. and his Gospel, which is also called Light, because it has the
same influence and Efficacy in illuminating the Minds of Men (which without it
are spiritually dark,) as the Sun and other lucid bodies have, to help our
Corporal Eyes in the discovery of Objects.

Light Metaphorically is put for life it self, Job. 3.16, 20, 21. (2.) For any
Prosperity and Joy of Mind arising from thence Esth. 8.16. (3.) For the open
and manifest state of things, Matthew. 10.27. Zeph. 3.5. Joh. 3.21. 1 Cor. 4.5.
(4.) For Favor and Good Will, Prove. 16.15. (5.) For the Mystery of
Regeneration, (1) With respect to the Organical Cause of it, viz. the Word and
Spirit of God, Psalm. 43. Prove. 6.23. Isa. 2.5.20. 2 Cor. 4.6. 1 John 2.8. (2)
With respect to the formal Cause, which is the Saving knowledge of Christ, and
true Faith, Act 26.18. Ephesians. 5.8. 1 Pet. 2.9. 1 John 1.7. Hence Believers are
called the Sons of Light, Luke 16.8. Ephesians. 5.8. 1 These. 5.5. and the Graces of
the Spirit and effects thereof, the Armor of Light, Romans 13.12. (3) With
respect to the final Cause, the last scope and effect of Faith, which is life
Eternal, Isa. 6O 19, 20. Joh. 8.12. Act. 26.23. 2 Timothy 1.10. etc.

More particularly by a Metaphor Light is put for Knowledge, Dan. 5.11. Isa.
60.3. For Beleivers, Ephesians. 5.8. For the Ministers of the Gospel, Matthew. 5.14.
For God himself, 1 John 1.5. Natural light was the first perfect Creature that
God made of this visible world, Genesis 1.3:

Light is put for the Morning, Neh. 8.3. And he read unto them -- from the
light (so the Hebrew) until Midday -- Noon light (in the Hebrew (...)
Zocharajim) signifies double light, or that which is extraordinary shining. The
Devil is called an Angel of Light, 2 Cor. 11.14. that is by himself or Agents
he assumes a specious and seeming Sanctity on purpose to ensnare and deceive
the Godly. God is said to dwell in unapproachable Light, 1 Timothy 6. that is in
such transcendent Glory, that no Mortal Eye can approach unto. There is nothing
so illustrious and glorious as Light, hence the joys of Heaven are set out by
it.

In what respect the Word or Gospel is compared to Light, take as follows,
METAPHOR.
1. Light is pleasant and very Comfortable. Eccl 11.7
Truly Light is sweet [saith Solomon] and a pleasant thing it is for the Eyes
to see the Sun. (...), sweet is the light.
How grevious is it to be blind or to be kept in a deep and dark Dungion
without seeing or beholding the Light.

2. Light has a penetrating quality, it is of such a piercing and subtle
Nature, that it conveys it self into the least Crevise; you can hardly make a
Fence so Close as wholly to keep out light.

3. Light makes manifest. Great Light discovers and makes things manifest,
causing them to appear as they are in their proper nature: which in the dark
many times are taken to be that which indeed they are not. When you would see
what a thing is that you may make a true Judgment of it, you bring it to the
Light. Whatsoever makes manifest [saith the Apostle] is Light. Ephesians. 5.13.


4. Light has a Directive virtue, it Guides men in their way: the Traveller by
the Benefit of Light sees what path to keep: and how to avoid the Dangers that
may attend, should he turn to the Right hand or to the Left.

5. Light has a Chearing, Warming and Reviving Quality, Light contributes much
to the Vegetation, Growth and Life of Plants and other Creatures: Light and
Motion are the cause of heat which the Heavenly Bodies send down upon the
Earth. Light is that Instrument whereby all Influences of Heaven are
communicated and dispersed to the World.

6. Light has a purging and purifying Virtue. Fogs and Mists that are gathered
in Darkness are dispersed and scattered when the Light comes, hence Light is
called the refining-pot of Nature. The World [saith a worthy Divine] would be
an unwholsom Pesthouse if it had no Light.

7. Light is of an undefileable Nature. Though it passes through sinks and most
polluted places, yet it Contracts no defilement; it cleanses all things but is
defiled by nothing. It Is a quality so spiritual that nothing can fasten upon it
to pollute it.

8. Light is Glorious for beauty and splendour. Hence the Glory of Heaven is
called Light. There is nothing of all created beings so Glorious as the Sun,
and light is a resplendency and shining forth of it.

Parallel.
1. The Word or Gospel of Jesus Christ is very pleasant, and a delightful
thing. How woeful was the state of England in former times when men were kept in
the Dungeon of Popish Darkness, without the Precious Light of Gods Word. Light
is compared to Gladness, and a good Day; Ps. 97.11.
many Good Days have we enjoyed since God sent out his Light and Truth amongst
us. Ps. 43.3.


2. The Word of God is of a searching and penitrating nature, the Apostle
says, it is quick and powerful, Heb. 4.12.
sharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of
soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
thoughts and Intents of the heart.

It Is a hard matter for a Man, though never so wicked, to shut out or Prevent the
Light of Gods Word from darting into, and piercing of his Evil and accusing
Conscience.

3. The Word and blessed Gospel of Christ is so Great a Light, that it makes
wonderful Discoveries to the Children of Men.

1. It makes Manifest not only that there is a God, but also what a God he is*
Not only his Being but also his manner of Being.

2. It Discovers the Creation of the World.

3. The State of Man, before he fell and after his Fall.

4. The horrid nature of Sin.

5. The secret Counsel and Eternal Love of God to lost Man, together with the
severity of God toward the fallen Angels.

6. It makes known the Lord Jesus Christ and his Blessed Design in coming into
the World: his Incarnation, Nativity, Life, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and
Intercession, etc.

7. It Discovers how God is to be Worshipped: all his Laws, Ordinances, and
Institutions are revealed by it.

8. It discovers the True Church which otherwise cannot be known.

9. Lastly, It makes manifest whatsoever is needful or necessary to be known, 2 Timothy 3.15, 16, 17
believed or practiced in order to Salvation.

4. The Word of God Directs and Guides Men in the Right way. Hence David
says, Psalm. 119.105.
Thy Word is a Lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths. God is Gracious
to mankind in this respect ( viz.) he leaves them not at an uncertainty without
an infallible Guide in matters of Religion. Take away this Un^^erring Rule, and
what confusion would the Christian World be in: one Man might say this is the
way, and another that; I walk says one by the Guidance of the Spirit; and so
says another that teaches quite Contrary things. Says a third you are both
out of the way, it is I alone that am led by Inspiration and ye are in Darkness.
Others plead for the Pope and General Counsels which have been miserably
Contradictory one to another and none of these can Give better Demonstrations
(touching the truth of what they Preach or Practice) then the Rest: being not
able to Confirm their Doctrine by Miracles; and so consequently how shall a
poor doubtful Soul be directed in the way to heaven by either or any of them.
For were not the holy Scriptures the Rule; but Contrariwise the Light within,
or Inspiration, etc. then must a Man be able to Confirm and Prove what he
says in such a way, or by such means that no Deceiver or Impostor can pretend
unto, or do the like.

Object.
But is not the Spirit of God above the Scriptures, which you call the Word,
did not the Spirit give forth the Scriptures? if so, sure then that is of the
Greatest Authority and only Light that can best Direct men Into the right way.

Answer.
That the holy Spirit or third Person of the holy Trinity is a Greater Light
then the holy Scripture is not Denied, by virtue of which holy men of old were
Inspired that gave them forth; yet the Question is, Whether any Man now has
such a measure of the Spirit in him which is a greater Light than the written
word, and to whom others are bound to adhere and be directed by: for it is this
only which is Denied.

5. The word and Gospel of Christ has a Chearing and Quickening Virtue. Psalm.
119.50. Psalm. 119.93.
This is my comfort in my affliction, thy word has Quickened me. And in
another place, I will never forget thy precepts, for with them thou have
Quickend me. As it is grevious to be Spiritually blind, or in the Dark Region
and Dungeon of Idolatry, Sin and Unbelief; so on the other hand how comfortable
is it to enjoy the blessed word and Gospel of Jesus Christ.

6. The Word and Gospel of Christ has a Cleansing, Purging and purifying
Virtue in it. Ps. 119.9.
Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according
to thy word. Joh. 15.3.
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. The Gospel and
word of God Disperseth and Scatters all the Fogs and Mists of Darkness and
Error. It is the refining-pot of Truth. What an unwholesome Pesthouse would the
World be, in a Spiritual Sense were it not for the Light and Excellent Virtue
of Gods holy Word.

7. The Word and Gospel of God is very pure and of an undefilable Nature;
Psalm. 119.1*40.
what filthy sinks has it past through, and what means has been used by the
Popish Adversaries and others to Corrupt and Polute, it and yet no defilement
cleaves to it, it remains unmixed, and pure, still shining forth Gloriously
such is the Excellent nature of it, it purifieth the hearts and lives of men,
and nothing can fasten upon it to polute it.

8. The Word and Gospel of Christ is called by the Apostle, The Glorious
Gospel, 2 Cor. 4.4.
the Gospel is exceeding full of Glory. There is nothing in it but that which
is very Glorious. Here you have a Resplendency and Shining forth of the Sun of
Righteousness. Gloria quasi clara, says Aquinas, because Glory is the bright
shining forth of Excellency, now its transcendent Excellency and Splendour
shines forth as may be demonstrated many ways.



1. Its Glorious, in Respect of the Author and Fountain from whence it proceeds.

2. It Is Glorious in a Comparative sense.

3. It Is Glorious in respect of it Self.

1. Gospel glorious in respect of the Author and fountain from whence it
proceeds. 2. Gospel glorious in comparison of the law.
First, As light is Glorious because it is the most Excellent Rays,
Resplendency and Shinings forth of the Sun; so is the Gospel, because it is the
glorious shining forth and resplendency of Jesus Christ the Sun of
Righteousness.

Secondly, It Is glorious in a comparative sense, it Excells the Law, hence
called a better Testiment; though that was glorious, yet it had no glory in this
respect, 2 Cor. 3.10.
by Reason of the glory that Excels.

I. The Gospel excels the Law in respect of the names of the one and the names
of the other.

1. The Law is called the Letter; the Gospel, the Ministration of the Spirit.

2. The Law is called a Ministration of death, the Gospel a Ministrator of life.

II. The gospel excels in glory above the law.

1. In regard of the light and perspicuity of it, the law was full of obscurity
clothed with many Ceremonies and mysterious Sacrifices.

2. They were at a great loss touching the main drift and end thereof, 2 Cor.
3.13. God spoke as it were under a Vail.

III. The gospel is clear and plain; Christ beheld, heard, handled, etc. the
Mysteries long hid, opened and explained fully: we behold with open face, etc.
2 Cor. 3.17, 18.


IV. The law was appointed to be but a leading Ministration, and in
subserviency to the gospel, our Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. Gal. 3.24.


V. The gospel more glorious, or excels the law in respect of the strength of
the one and weakness of the other; what the law could not do, Romans 8.3.
in that it was weak through the Flesh, God sent forth his Son, etc.

The law wounds, but cannot heal; it shows a man he is dead, but it cannot give
him life; it shows man he is naked, but it cannot cloth him.

The gospel gives life, heals, clothes and comforts; the one shows we are in
Prison, the other brings us out, no Salvation by the one, and none without the
other.

VI. The gospel excels in glory above the law in regard of the discovery there
is made therein of the Mercy and Grace of God; the one shows God is just and
severe, and will not clear the guilty; the other shows he is not only just, but
also gracious. If any grace shone forth under the law, it was only beams of
gospel light darting forth darkly in it.

VII. The gospel is more glorious in regard of the chief Administrators of the
one and of the other. The one were, (1) Angels, Heb. 2.1, 2 Act. 7.53.
if the Word spoken by Angels were steadfast, who have received the law by the
disposition of Angels and have not kept it. (2.) Moses, a Servant, one that
spoke on earth, Heb. 12.25. The other Christ, the Lord of life and glory who
speaks from heaven. How shall we escape if we turn away from him that speaks
from Heaven. Heb. 12.25.


VIII. The gospel excels the law in respect of Preisthood, Aaron and his Sons
were Priests of the law, Christ is the only Priest of the gospel.

1. The Priests of the law were Men, no more than Men; Christ, God-Man.

2. They had infirmities, sin and guilt in their hearts and lives as well as
others, Christ had none, in his Mouth was found no guile.

3. They were made Priests without an Oath, but Christ with an Oath; Heb. 7.21.
so greater solemnity at his instalment into Office.

4. They could not continue by reason of Death, and they truly were many
because shey were not suffered to continue, by reason of death; but Christ
dies not, Heb. 7.23, 24, 25.
he ever lives to make intercession for us, but this man because he continues
for ever has an unchangeable Priesthood.

5. Christ was more merciful and filled with greater bowels than they, he has
compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way, Heb. 5.2.

6. Christ as Priest, was the substance, the Antitype of Aaron and his
Priesthood.

7. There is compleatness and perfection in Christ's Priesthood; but it was not
so touching Aarons. If therefore perfection were by the Levitical Priest, Heb.
7.11.
etc. the law that made nothing perfect.

IX. The Priesthood of Christ under the gospel excels Aarons in respect of Work
and Office, etc.

1. He was to enter into the holy place. 2. To appear before God. 3. To bear
the sins of the People, Exodus 28.38. 4. To make an Atonement. Lev. 16.32. 5. To
Judge of Uncleanness, Lev. 13.2. 6. To offer Incense, Lev. 16.17.8. 7. To
determine Controversies, Deuteronomy. 17.8. 8. To Bless the People; and many other
things which Jesus Christ infinitely Excels in.
1. Christ is entered into the true Holy Place, Sanctum Sanctorum, the Holy of
Holies, Heaven it self.

2. He appears really before God for us, being set down on the right hand of
the Majesty on High, etc.

3. He has as the great Antitype born our sins upon his own Body on the Tree.

4. He has made a complete and perfect Atonement.

5. He Judges of our uncleanness both of the Heart as well as of the Flesh.

6. He resolves all our Doubts, ends Controversies; speaks peace to the
disconsolate, a word in season to him that is weary.

Rev. 8* 3.
7. He offers Incense; And there was given to him much Incense that he should
offer it with the prayers of all Saints.

Act. 3.26.
8. He gives down Blessings; Him has God sent to bless you in turning away
every one of you from his iniquities, etc.

IX. The gospel excels the law in respect of Sacrifices.

1. Those Sacrifices under the law were not so Excellent, there was not that
worth in them as is in the Sacrifices of the gospel. What was the blood of
Bulls, Bullocks, and Lambs? these were part of those Legal Sacrifices.

Christ offered up his own Body, poured forth his precious Blood to take away
our sins.

2. They were offered often to Atone for Iniquity daily, every year;

Heb. 10.14.
But Christ has offered up himself in Sacrifices once for all, by one offering
he has perfected for ever them that are Sanctified, that which they were
always or continually a doing and yet could not accomplish, he did by one
single Sacrifice and that for ever.

X. The law required perfect righteousness, and nothing less would be accepted,
and so consequently no soul could thereby be delivered from terror and bondage;
but the gospel (through Christ's perfect righteousness acted in his own Person
for us) accepts of Sincerity in the room and stead of the perfect keeping the
whole Law.

XI. In respect of the extent of the one and of the other.

The law was only given to Israel, or unto the lineal Seed of Abraham and to
the Proselyte Stranger; he dealt his Laws and Statutes to Israel, he did not so
to any Nation, etc.

The gospel is extended to all People and Nations under the whole Heavens: Go
into all the World and preach the Gospel to every Creature, Mar. 16.15.
Whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal Life. Joh. 3.16.


XII. The gospel excels the law in the easiness and sweetness of it; the
precepts of the law were many more in number, and hard to learn and remember,
and very difficult and painful some of them to do (particularly Circumcision)
and also very chargeable beyond what the Gospel is: Mat. 11.28, 29.
My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

XIII. The gospel is glorious above the law in regard of the Promises of it,
called better Promises, better Covenant, better Hope, Heb. 7.19.

XIV. It is more glorious in respect of its Duration the law was but for a
time, the Servant abides not in the house for ever, but the Son abides for
ever, an everlasting Covenant, Joh. 8.35.
an everlasting Priesthood, an everlasting Gospel. No other Ministration is to
be looked for till the end of the World.

3. The Gospel glorious in respect of the Historical part of it.
Thirdly, The gospel is glorious in respect of it self. (here we shall be large)
If we have respect to the Historical part, the gospel contains a glorious
history, there is that in it which may affect every person, please every
Curiosit^^, what is there in any History which may Commend or illustrate its
glory and excellency which the gospel comes short in?

1. Some Persons delight to Read and hear Histories that treat of Love, and
amorous stories.

2. Some are more affected with such that treat of Martial-Exploits or
Achievements of Wars, of the conquering of Kingdoms and Nations, and
overcoming mighty Champions, etc.

3. Some rather Commend such Histories that treat of those great rarities which
are in many Nations and Kingdoms of the world, and of the Cities, Laws,
Customs and other things of the like nature that are in some Countries.

4. Others are more pleased with such Histories that treat of things different
to all these.

Now the Gospel of Christ contains variety of matter upon every Respect what is
there Famous, Rare, Delightful, or Marvelous, but it is out done here.

First concerning Love, what history may Compare with the Gospel in this
respect, here you have an account of a mighty King whose Dominions, Power and
Glory was Infinite, who was higher than the highest, and Ruled over all, who
had but one Son and he most Dear to him and lay in his Bosom, the Joy and
Delight of his heart, the very express Image of the Father; whose Beauty,
Lovelyness of his Person, and other Personal Excellencies and Perfections had
we the tongue of Men and Angels, we could not set forth the Thousandth part
thereof. This Glorious King had a mind to dispose of his Son in Marriage, and
to this end very early proposed the matter to him, and whom he had Chose for
him. As also the way, means and manner how or what he must do in order to
obtain her for himself. To which the Son with abundance of Joy consented to.
And so it had fell out, that the Person agreed upon to be the Intended Spouse,
was once in great favor with this mighty King, and a near dweller to him in
Eden: but for horrid Rebellion and Treason was banished his presence and was
fled into a far Country. And now there was no ways for the glorious Prince to
accomplish his business but he must suit himself in a fit Equipage, and take a
Journey into that Country where this Creature was astrayed away.

1. Now were the nature and glory of the Kingdom considered, which Jesus Christ
left, or the place from whence he came.

2. The greatness of his glory there, and excellency of his Person.

3. The length of that Journey he undertook.

4. The nature of the Doleful and Miserable place or Country into which he
came.

5. His great abasement or manner of his coming.

6. What he met with, or how entertained at his first Arrival.

7. What the quality and condition of the Creature was, for whose sake he came.

8. What he suffered and underwent from the greatness of that precious Love he
bore to the said Creature.

9. And how after all this he was slighted and rejected by this Rebellious one,
and of his much Patience and Long-suffering before he took his last Denial,
together with the powerful arguments and ways he used, and does use to obtain
the Souls affection. If these things I say were Considered, this history will
appear to every Discerning Person the most pleasantest and glorious for Love
that ever Mortal heard. See Metaphor Bridegroom.

Secondly, Should we speak of warlike Achievements, what history in this
respect can compare with the history of the gospel, was there ever such a
Champion as Jesus Christ, or such terrible Battles fought as were fought by
him? as witness that glorious battle of his with Satan the mighty King of the
bottomless Pit; Mat. 4.2, 3, 4
also those conflicts he had with sin and wrath in the Garden; and last of all
with Death the King of terrors, over all which he obtained a perfect Conquest.

Thirdly, As touching great Rarities and wonderful things, which some histories
abound withal; none afford such wonders as does the gospel, is it not
mavelous that a Woman should compass a Man? that he that made the world
should be born of a Woman? that the Ancient of Days should become a Child?
that Death should be destroyed by Death? and many other like Mysteries the
Gospel abounds with.

Secondly, As the word and gospel of God is glorious in respect of the
historical part thereof, The Gospel glorious in respect of the Titles or Names
given to it.
so its glory appears in Respect of those Titles or Epithets given to it.

I. It Is called the word of Reconciliation.

1. Because it shows how Peace and Reconciliation is made between an offended
God and offending Creatures.

2. Because by it terms of Reconciliation are offered to poor sinners.

3. Because it is the medium or means God offered to remove the Enmity that is
in sinners hearts.

Acts 20.24.
II. It Is called the gospel of the grace of God, and may well be so termed.

1. In respect of the Testimony that is born therein of Gods great grace and
favor to men in giving Jesus Christ for them.

2. In respect of its being the clearest discovery of Gods grace that ever was
afforded to the Children of men.

3. Because it is the Instrument or Means by which God works grace, or makes the
Souls of Men gracious, who were once void thereof and ungodly, so that Faith
comes by hearing, Romans 10.17.
and hearing by the word of God.

4. Because it is the way by which God increases, strengthens, and perfects his
blessed grace in the Souls of his Elect. Ephesians. 4.12.


Ephesians. 6.15. Isa. 57.19.
III. The gospel is called the gospel of Peace.

1. It is a message of Peace; Peace, peace to him that is a far off, and to him
that is near. Ephesians. 2: 17.
And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were
nigh.

2. Because it is that, which being received, alone pacifies the Conscience of
a wounded sinner, Psalm. 107.20.
He sent his word and healed them.

3. Because as an Instrument it brings the Soul into a state of Peace and
Friendship with God, and reconciles men one to another.

Mat. 24.14. Luke 10.11. Mark 15.41. Mat. 11.12.
IV. It is called the gospel of the Kingdom.

7. It shows men the Ready way to the Kingdom of Glory, and from hence may
fitly be called the gospel of the Kingdom.

Phil. 2.16
V. The gospel is called the word of Life.

Col. 3.4.
1. Because it shows who is our Life.

2. It shows the way how we come to be made alive [ viz.] by Christ Receiving
the Spirit of Life for us as Mediator, and laying down the price of his own
blood, he died that we might live. Joh. 10.10.
I am come that you might have Life, and that ye might have it more abundantly.

3. The gospel may be called the word of Life, because by the help of the
Spirit it works life in us, it is hereby we are quickened, and raised from death
to life, the Dead [saith our Saviour] shall hear the voice of the Son of God,
Joh. 5.25.
and they that hear shall life.

4. It Is by the Word and gospel of God life is maintained in us, it is the
support of our spiritual live.

Mat. 4.4.
Man Lives not by Bread alone, but by Every word that proceeds out of the mouth
of God.

5. It leads to Eternal Life; all those who believe and follow the holy Rules
and Directions thereof.

Romans 1.16.
VI. The gospel is Called the Power of God to Salvation, i. e. a mighty and
glorious Instrument or means of Gods saving Power: Metalepsis.

Heb. 12.19 Deu. 25.8, 9, 10.
VII. The gospel is called the Joyful sound, the law was a sound of Fears and
Terror, a sound or voice of words that were Exceeding Dreadful. The Gospel is
the Antitype of the sounding the Trumpet of the great Jubilee, to proclaim full
Liberty and Freedom from all bondage and Tyranny of Sin, Satan, Hell, and Wrath.

Ephesians. 3.8.
VIII. The gospel is called the unsearchable Riches of Christ.

1. It shows how Rich our Mediator and Husband is, In him are hid all the
Treasures of wisdom and knowledge, Col. 2.3. and 1.19.
it pleased the Father that in him all fullness should dwell.

2. It shows the nature of his Riches both of grace and glory. Ephesians. 1.7, 18.
chapter 3.16.


3. The gospel makes all spiritualy and gloriously Rich, who truly Receive it,
though never so poor before.

4. All true Riches are communicated to us through the gospel, such that would
have this golden Ore must dig in this Mine, this is the Field where the Pearl
lies hid.

IX. The gospel is called the word of Faith. Romans 10.8


1. It presents the object before the Soul.

2. It opens the way to see this Object.

3. It gives [by means of the Spirit] a hand to take hold of the Object.

X. The gospel is called the faithful word. Because whatever its promises are
they be faithfully performed. Tit. 1.9.


XI. It Is called the Ministration of the Spirit; because through it Persons
come to receive the Spirit, Received ye [saith the Apostle] the spirit by the
works of the law, 2 Cor. 3. Gal. 3.2.
or by the hearing of Faith.

XII. It is called the gospel of Salvation.

1. It Interesteth the Soul [through the Spirit] into Salvation, as well as
shows the way of it.

therein.

XIII. It Is called the glorious gospel of God. 1 Timothy 1.11.


1. The glory of God shines forth in it.

2. It was the glorious contrivance of his eternal wisdom.

3. It wholly Exalts God, and sets him forth in all his blessed and most
glorious Attributes and Perfections, beyond what any other Ministration does
whatsoever.

XIV. The gospel is called a Book. Rev. 22.18.


1. Yea it is a Book by the inspiration of God, as all holy Scriptures were.
All other books, save the Bible, are humane, but this is Sacred and Divine.

2. There is a Blessing pronounced to him that reads this book. Rev. 1.3.


3. And a much greater Blessing to him that understands it, and keeps the
things therein contained.

4. It Is a Book of all truth and no error: can that be said of any other book?

5. It Is a Book Ratified and Confirmed by wonders.

6. It Is a Book that all other books point to. Moses points to it, the Prophets
point to it, all holy books of godly Men point to it.

7. It Is a book that all good and godly books are taken out of.

8. It Is a book that has filled the world with good and profitable Books.
These things considered, may serve as a sound Gradation to set forth the glory
of the gospel and word of God.

4. The Gospel glorious in respect of the time when it was contrived.
Thirdly, To come more directly unto the thing it self to set forth and further
illustrate the glory and splendor of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

1. It Is glorious in respect of the time and contrivance of it. It was found
out or contrived before the world began. Hence Christ is said to be a Lamb
slain before the foundation of the world.

2. It is brought in as the result of that great and glorious Council which was
held in Eternity. Hence Jesus Christ our Mediator is said to be delivered up by
the determinate Counsel and foreknowledge of God. -- God, that is Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, all agreed that the second Person should assume Man's nature,
and by shedding of his blood proclaim Peace and reconciliation to sinners. The
Counsel of Peace [saith the Prophet] shall be between them both. Zech. 6.13.

3. It may not be unnecessary to note here the matter this great Council had
before them, and did then debate about, and that was how a way might be found
out that God might display his own Glory and magnify himself in every one of
his glorious Attributes, particularly how the two great Attributes of Justice
and Mercy might meet together in sweet harmony and shine in equal glory, that
God who is Just might appear so, and yet exceeding gracious.

4. It was to find out a way how in a glorious manner God might destroy the
works and designs of the Devil: Romans 3.26.
1 John 3.8.
for to this purpose (we Read) the Son of God was manifested.

5. It was a Council held upon the account of sinful man, lost man, (whom God
then saw dead and fallen) how he might be delivered from sin and eternal wrath,
'twas not a Council held to ruin and destroy men, but to save and make them
happy. This is the third thing to illustrate this Great truth that the gospel
or word of Christ is a glorious Gospel.

Fourthly, The gospel is glorious upon the consideration of that Revelation
there is in it of God (personally considered) or the Persons of the Blessed
Trinity, or Gods manner of being.

1. Though God is often called a Father in the old Testament, yet how hard is
it without help of the gospel to find out where he is so called or taken in
distinction from the Son, and holy Spirit, since Father (as many Divines
observe) in some places of Scripture respects all the three Persons, and hence
the Jewish Rabbis (who allow not of the new Testament) manifestly declare
their Ignorance touching this Great Truth of the Trinity, though that may in part
be imputed to that Judicial blindness they are left under, yet it must be
granted there is in the gospel a more clear and full discovery of this glorious
Mystery then in the Law or old Testament, how plainly and by manifest testimony
is this bore witness to.

1. By the Angels, Luke 1.32.

2. By that Voice from the Excellent glory. Mat. 3.17. 2 Pet. 1.17.

3. By the testimony of Christ himself. I thank thee Father, Lord of Heaven and
Earth -- even so Father -- the Father that sent me is with me -- the Father
loves the Son -- the Father has not left me alone -- I and my Father are one;
and it is observed that he calls God Father near an hundred times in the gospel
of John.

4. By the Testimony of the holy Apostles how clearly is this witnessed by them
especially by the Blessed beloved Apostle, and Paul the great Apostle of the
Gentiles.

5 The Gospel glorious in respect of the Revelation made therein of the Trinity.
Fifthly, The gospel appears yet to be more glorious upon the Consideration of
the glory of every one of the Persons in the blessed Trinity which shine forth
most excellently therein.

I. In respect of the Father who did not design to vail his own glory, but to
greaten and magnify it by the gospel. For though the Lord Jesus is held forth in
the gospel touching his Deity to be Equal with the Father, yet this does not,
must not lessen or diminish the Fathers glory; all are to honor the Son as
they honor the Father, but not above the Father, nay what can or ever did
demonstrate or greaten the honor which is due to God the Father, like the
honor and adoration ascribed and given to him by the Lord Jesus as Mediator, O
how did he strain to set out and promote the Glory of God the Father! My
Doctrine is not mine but the fathers that sent me. As the living father sent
me, Joh. 6.57. Joh. 14.28. Joh. 12.49.
and I live by the Father, etc. My father is Greater than I, I Honor my
father, but ye dishonor me, for I have not spoken of my self, but the Father
which sent me, he gives me commandment what I should say and what I should
speak.

Quest.
Wherein does the gospel manifest the Fathers glory.

Answ.
The Fathers glory shines forth therein to Admiration in respect of his infinite
Grace, Love and Rich Bounty to poor perishing men.

The Glory of the Fa- shines forth in the Gospel.
1. Whatever Relief succor and saving Benefit any sinners do Receive in this
world, or have the promise of Receiving in the world to come: the Gospel wholly
ascribes it in the first place to God the Father, his Compassion, his Bowels
and his Love and Bounty is set forth in the gospel to be such to his poor
Creatures, that no tongue is able to Express it. He is great and glorious;
Alexander is said to give like himself, be sure the Father has has out done
him and Araunah too. He gives not to Kings, but like a King, yea like the King
of Kings, he is wonderful, in grace and rich bounty he is wonderful.

II. Consider what it is he has given, what he has parted with for and to
poor sinners, has he not parted with his Choicest Jewel, his best and Choicest
treasure: God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that
whosoever believes in him might not perish but have everlasting life. Joh.
3.16.


If it had been a Servant, his Noah, his Abraham, his Moses, his David, his
grace and bounty had been great: but alas they could not Redeem us, none were
found worthy to open the Book nor loose the Seals thereof amongst all the
Children of men or Saints of God that ever lived.

Or had it been an Angel, one of the glorious Seraphims or Cherubims, the
favor had been unspeakable, considering what we were: but to think it was and
must be his Son; his only begotten Son that lay in his Bosom, his dearly and
welbeloved Son in whom he was well pleased, a Son that never offended, a
glorious Son the Joy and Delight of his heart.

III. Consider whether he sent this his dear Son, and wherefore.

1. He sent him into the World.

2. Into a sad World, into a strange Country where he was not known.

3. He sent him amongst Enemies, amongst wicked men, such that hated him and
his Father.

4. Nay amongst Devils.

5. He sent him to be Abased, he was Vilified, Contemned, and Spit upon, He was
despised and rejected of men. Isa. 53.3*


6. Nay he sent him to Die, to pour forth his Soul to Death to become a Ransom
for many, he commanded him to lay down his Life. Joh. 10.8.


IV. Consider for whose sake he sent him to suffer all this.

1. Was it for his Friends, such that he was beholden to?

2. Or was it for some dear Relation?

3. Or was it for some worthy or deserving Creature that had Merited such
Favor and Grace from him?

No it was for such that were his Enemies who Deserved nothing but Hell and
Eternal Wrath for ever.

V. And Lastly, Consider what was his great and glorious design in all this.

1. Which was to make peace. God was in Christ Reconciling the world to
himself. 2 Cor. 5.19.


2. To Espouse and Marry poor Sinners to himself for ever.

3. To Convey a gracious and Legal Pardon to them, Act. 5.31. Rev. 1.52
and to wash them from their sins in the blood of his Everlasting Covenant.

4. To bestow the blessing of Adoption upon them, i. e. to make such his own
Children by Favor and Grace who were his Enemies and Children of Wrath by
nature. 1 John 3.1


5. To Purchase a Kingdom for them. Ephesians. 1.13.


6. To save them from Eternal wrath and death, and to bestow upon them Eternal
Life.

And thus the glorious Mercy of God the Father shines forth in the gospel: for
these things fully set forth that the Father is gracious. And in the next place
let me speak a little of his Justice also, for his glorious Justice as well as
Mercy shines forth in the Gospel.

First, It must be considered that Justice as well as Mercy is in God, as his
Mercy is Infinite so is his Justice. Exodus 34.7.


Secondly, It must be granted also that Justice was injured by the Fall and Sin
of Man, and called for Satisfaction which was signified 1. By the Execution of
the Sentence pronounced upon the account of Man's Disobedience. 2. By turning
him out of the Garden. 3. By the flaming Sword. 4. By the Law upon Mount Sinai.
5. By many severe expressions and fearful Threatenings mentioned in the holy
Scriptures, God is angry with the wicked every day, his Soul lothed them, Ps.
7.11. Zech. 11.8
he has whet his Sword, etc.

Thirdly, In the next place consider Justice must be satisfied or we must be
Damned, that God will not save in a way of Mercy to the wronging of his Justice.

Fourthly, It behooves us therefore to know what will satisfy Gods Justice and
appease his wrath. And indeed nothing less will do this than perfect and
complete Obedience to the Law for the time to come, and a plenary compensation
for the wrong done in time past. Thou must be holy, pure, without sin in thine
own person, or have such a Righteousness by Faith imputed to thee.

What will the sinner now do? may be he will say, I will cast my self upon the
Mercy of God, that is thy only way, but if thou have not an eye to the
Atonement and Satisfaction made by Christ Jesus, thou will Perish
notwithstanding; Exodus 34.7, 8.
for he that said he was Gracious, Merciful, abundant in Goodness and Truth,
said also he would by no means acquit the Guilty.

The gospel shows Gods Wrath must be appeased, and that it must be appeased by
Sacrifices, but if we should Sacrifice a 1000 Rams or 10000 Rivers of Oil; nay,
do as the Gentiles did, Sacrifice our Children, or cause them to pass through
the fire as the Jews did to Moloch, and give the fruit of our Body for the Sin
of our Soul, it will not be accepted.

And as a Child cannot [by being Sacrificed] make an atonement for Sin,
neither can any man's Brother do it for him, Psalm. 49.7, 8.
they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their
Riches: none of them can by any means Redeem his Brother, nor give to God a
Ransom for him; for the Redemption of their soul is precious, etc.

What will the sinner now say, or what course take, that he may please God,
pacify his wrath and be saved. May be he will say I will reform, I will amend
my Life: this is Good, but alas 'twill not do: because thou owe ten thousand
Talents. Will promising [nay indeavouring] to run no more in Debt pay off the
old Score? Well says the sinner, if it be so, I will repent and mourn for my
sin and pour forth tears before God, and see if that will do. Alas! should
thou weep Rivers of Tears, nay could thou weep Rivers of blood and nothing
but weep as long as thou live on earth: yet this will not satisfy the
Justice of God nor make a compensation for thy Iniquity, this shows God is just
indeed: and thus Glorious Justice shines forth in the Gospel.

And now to satisfy Divine Justice, Jesus Christ as the act of Mercy is
constituted and appointed by the Great God to be our surety who entered into a
Covenant to pay all and discharge such sinners who shall believe on him: and
that there is no pardon nor Salvation but by this way ( viz.) by Christ 1. I
shall show. 2. Show why Salvation is by Christ Jesus. 3. Answer an Objection.


1. That it is so, see Act. 4.12. where the Apostle Peter speaking of Jesus
Christ says, neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is no other
name under Heaven given whereby we can be saved. Compared with Acts 13.38. Heb.
10.5. but further to demonstrate it must be so.

Isa. 53.4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 2.24. Heb. 9 22.
1. Because Christ is said to bear our sins, that is he was constituted and
placed by the Father as Mediator in our room to bear the punishment due to us
for our Iniquities.

2. Because the Scripture says without shedding of blood there is no
Remission, and that no other blood would do but the blood of this immaculate
Lamb.

Ephesians. 2.13, 14, 15.
3. Because Christ is said to make Peace, Reconcile and make us near to God by
his blood.

4. Because we are said to be bought with a Price, or Redeemed and purchased by
the Lord Jesus, 1 Cor. 6.20. 1 Pet. 1.18. Acts 20.27. Ephesians. 1.6. Isa. 45.24. 1
Cor. 1.30. Rom 4.3. 2 Cor. 5.21. Act. 4.12. 1 John 1.2.12.
the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister; and to give his
life a Ransom for many.

5. Because our acceptance with God is through Christ wherein he has made as
accepted in the beloved, and that this is through the imputation of Christ's
Righteousness.

God imputes not our sins to us they are laid upon another (viz.) Our surety
he was made sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the Righteousness
of God in him.

6. Because it is said there is no Salvation but in and through him and all that
we receive whether grace here or glory hereafter is for his sake.

Why is Salvation by Jesus Christ and by the shedding of his blood? Quest.


1. Because of the absolute Purpose and Decree of God, God has decreed this way
and no other way to save sinners. Answ.


2. I might show the necessity of Salvation by Christ from the nature of Sin
which men stood charged with, sin is so contrary to God he could do no less
than require the satisfaction of his own offended Justice.

3. In respect of the Law, perfect Righteousness being required of Man in point
of Justification.

4. Salvation came in this way that God might be glorified in every Attribute,
and eternal life be wholly of Gods free grace, Romans 3.24, 25.
through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus.

How can we be said to be freely forgiven our sins in a way of grace and favor
if Christ has made a full compensation to the Justice of God for them? Object.


1. It Is wholly of grace though not without Atonement and Redemption made by
Christ blood which might be made appear many ways. Answ.


2 Cor. 5.19.
1 In that God is so gracious as not to require satisfaction of us and Impute
our Trespasses to us.

2 Because God was at his own free choice whether he would bring forth a
Savior for us or not.

Joh. 33.24. Joh. 3.16.
3. Because the surety is wholly of his own providing, and nothing but his love
and precious grace moved him to send him into the world.

4 Moreover it is further demonstrated by Gods gracious acceptance of this
satisfaction for us and not for others, for though there is a worth and
sufficiency in it for all; yet it is only made effectual unto them, for whom it
was intended or appointed by that glorious agreement or compact between the
Father and Son in Eternity.

5. It Is further manifest also in respect of Gods gracious goodness in
affording us the knowledge of this blessed Atonement; there is an absolute
necessity of Faith in order to a sure Interest into this Salvation, Romans 10.14,
1^^ Ephesians. 3.4.5 Gal. 1.14* 15.
and Faith comes by hearing the Word Preached, had not God afforded us the
gospel, we should have known no more of this glorious Mystery of Redemption,
nor had any more faith than Pagans and Infidels.

6. It appears to be wholly of Gods free grace; upon the consideration of Gods
working those meet qualifications in order to Pardon and Salvation ( viz.) it is
he that gives a broken Heart and Repentance, it is he that works faith in us and
by whom we are begotten to a lively hope.

7. Lastly, It Is of his own free grace in that he parted with and spared not
his own dear Son rather than we should die in our Sins, Isa. 42.4.
who could not fail nor be discouraged but was every way capable to accomplish
the work of Salvation for us.

1. He was a person holy and undefiled, yea without the least stain or spot of
sin.

2. He was one that was free and could dispose of himself to be a surety and
sacrifice for others.

3. He consented and agreed with the Father to undertake this glorious work and
office. Heb. (...)


4. He was able to overcome all difficulties and thereby fully discharge the
Sinner.

5. One so glorious in Nature, that from the Excellency and worth of his Person
Satisfaction comes to be received. Thus the Gospel appears glorious as it makes
manifest, and does Reveal the Glory of God the Father.

The Gospel glorious in respect of the Revelation made therein of the great
Subject thereof, J. Christ.
Secondly, I shall show you the Gospel is glorious as it Discovers and holds
forth the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ the Second Person of the Trinity.

1. The gospel Reveals the Son clearly who was long prophesied of and pointed
at, and that more principally in five respects.

1. In respect of his glorious Person. 2. In respect of his glorious Offices,
as Mediator. 3. In respect of his glorious Love. 4. In respect of his glorious
Riches. 5. In respect of his glorious Power, Headship and Sovereignty.
The Gospel is glorious in respect of the chief Subject thereof, Jesus Christ.

1. In respect of his glorious Person and Personal Excellencies.
1. And first in respect of the Excellency of his Person; which, had I the
tongue of Men and Angels, I could not declare the hundredth part thereof; so
far does he Excel in personal Excellencies and Perfections the Children of Men,
what can one think of Christ, speak of Christ, hear of Christ, or Read in holy
Scripture of Christ but may affect our hearts? the gospel is a glorious
Subject, but it is Christ who is the glorious Subject of the gospel: as all we
have, flows from or through the gospel to us, so all the gospel has in it,
flows from Christ. That he is excellent and glorious in this respect is
expressly declared in the holy Scripcures, Psalm. 76.4. Ps. 45.^^ Cant. (...) 10,
1^^. (...) Heb. 1.3.
Thou art more Excellent (says the Psalmist speaking of Christ) than the
mountains of Prey. And in another place, Thou art fairer than the Children of
Men, (or sons of Adam,) Grace is poured into thy Lips. My Beloved is white and
ruddy, the chiefest amongst ten thousand, he is altogether Lovely. He is the
brightness of the Fathers Glory, and the Express Image of his Person.

That his glory is very great, might be demonstrated by two or three Arguments.

1. Because he is the Object of the Fathers Delight, nay the Father himself
commends his beauty and glory to the Children of Men.

2. Because, in that the holy Angels are taken with him, the Angels stand and
wonder, he was seen of Angels, such a Person they never beheld before, 1 Timothy
3.16.
and they worship him.

3. Because Saints and all truly enlightened Souls do admire him and know not
how to set him forth, Phil. 3 ^^.
Paul accounted all things loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ.

4. He is called the desire of all Nations.

1. There is enough in him to fill the desire of all Nations.

2. None ever in any Nation that had a true sight of him but did desire him.

3. The Nations will never be satisfied until they have and do enjoy him, and
are under the Influences of his glorious grace and government.

5. Because there never were any who saw his glory but did admire it.

Quest.
Wherein does his personal Excellencies consist?

Answ.
In his being Man, such a Man, there is one God, and one mediator between God
and man, 1 Timothy 3.5.
THE man Christ Jesus: Compared with Acts 2.22. Heb. 7.24.

Quest.
What a Man is Christ?

Answ.
A Man of Men, the Son of Man, a Man without spot fault or stain of sin, the
Excellency of humane Nature, made like unto us in all things, sin only excepted.

The Godhead or Deity of Christ. Luke 2.36.
He is not only glorious in respect of his being man, such a man, but in
respect of his being God, also in this he Excels! Oh here, in this his glory
shines forth as the light; The Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of
the Highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing that shall be
born of thee shall be called the son of God.

Heb. 1.8.
1. He is called God, but unto the Son he says thy Throne O God is for ever and
ever, etc.

2. Not only God, but the Mighty God; His name shall be called wonderful,
counselor, Isa. 9.6.
the mighty God, the everlasting Father, etc.

1 John 3.20.
3. Not only God, the mighty God, but also the true God; And we are in him that
is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal Life.

4. He is called the only wise God.

Romans 9.5.
Lastly, He is called God blessed for ever whose are the Fathers, and of whom as
concerning the flesh Christ came, who is God blessed for ever, amen.

Secondly, The gospel declares that he made the world, this proves that Christ
is God and greatly magnifies his glory, he that made the world must needs be
God Eternal, for none could do that but the glorious Jehovah it is ridiculous
and most absurd to think that the Creature could make it self before it self
was. God in respect of his Infinite glory and wisdom upon this account
expostulateth and reasons with his People (glorying if I may so say) in the
Greatness of his Power and Majesty and thereby proving his unwordable Essence
and dreadful Godhead, Isa. 40. and all the Gods of these Nations to be but
Idols, and that the same power in respect to creating, Col. 2.16.
which is ascribed to the Father, is attributed to Jesus Christ. See Joh. 1.1,
2. for by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in
earth, visible and invisible, etc. Compared with Heb. 2.10.

Thirdly, The gospel shows that Jesus Christ did not only create, but also does
uphold all things that are created, Heb. 1.3.
who being the brightness of his glory, and the express Image of his person and
upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our
sins, Col. 1.17.
sat down on the Right Hand of the Majesty on high, etc. he is before all
things, and by him all things consist.

Fourthly, The gospel shows that Jesus Christ knows all things, such Knowledge
is too wonderful for Men or Angels. In several places of Scripture, the blessed
God does prove his glorious Being by his Omnisciency, Ps. 139.6.
and that the like in respect of Knowledge is said of Christ, is evident, and
he said unto him, Lord thou know all things, Joh. 21.17. Compared with Joh.
2.24, 25. but Jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men
and needed not that any should testify of him, for he knew what was in man, in
another place it is said he knew from the beginning who they were that believed
not and who should betray him.

Fifthly, The gospel declares that Jesus Christ searches the heart; (though this
Argument depends upon the last, yet for Illustration sake I make another of it)
he that searches the heart, ought to be acknowledged and owned to be the
Almighty and Eternal God, for who can find out the depths and deceits thereof
but the Infinite Majesty? the Heart is deceitful above all things and
desperately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord search the heart and try the
Reins, Jer. 17.9, 10.
as if he should say there is none save my self alone knows or can know it,
but that the Lord Jesus who died for our sins searches the Heart and the
Reins, he himself positively asserts it, Rev. 2.23. I will kill her Children
with Death (speaking of the woman Jezebel) and all the Churches shall know that
I am he which searches the Reins and the Heart, and I will give unto every one
according as his work shall be.

Sixthly, The gospel shows that Jesus Christ is the First and the Last, and he
that is the First and the Last, must of necessity be acknowledged to be the
everlasting and eternal God, for from this very ground and consideration the
Almighty argues and reasons with his people of old to convince them of his
Deity, and that there is no other God besides himself, I AM the first, and I am
the last, Isa. 44.6. chapter 48.12.
and besides me there is no God: Compared with Isa. 48.12. Hearken unto me O
Jacob, and Israel my called, I am be, I am the first and I am the last, etc.
And that the same is spoken of the Lord Jesus Christ; See Rev. 1.8. I am Alpha
and Omega, Rev. 1.8.
the beginning and ending, which is, and which was, and which is to come the
Almighty; Ver. 17. And when I saw him (says John) I fell at his feet, and he
laid his Right hand upon me saying, I am the first and the last.

Seventhly, The gospel declares that Spiritual Worship or Divine Adoration,
does appertain or belong to Jesus Christ, which proves undeniably he is God
Eternal and from Everlasting, for that it is Idolatry spiritually, to adore and
worship a Creature. That Christ was and ought to be worshipped with the same
worship that is due to the Father; see Mat. 8.2. chap. 28.17. Luke 24.52. Joh.
9.38. chap. 5.23. And again, when he brings his first begotten into the
world, he says and let all the Angels of God worship him.

Eighthly, The gospel shows Jesus Christ has power to forgive Sins; Mat. 9.1,
2, 4, 6. Mar. 2.^^6 Luke 5.21 Act 9.14. Romans 10.9, 10, 11, 12 1 Cor. 1.2. Joh.
2.19.21. Joh. 10.18. Phil. 2.5, 6, 7. Zec. 13.7.
none have power to forgive Sins but God. Ergo, Jesus Christ is God.

Ninthly, He to whom the Saints ought and do Pray, is the most high God; but
the gospel shows the Saints do and ought to pray to the Lord Jesus Christ,
therefore he is the most high God.

Tenthly, The gospel shows that Jesus Christ had not only power to lay down his
own life, but also to take it up again, destroy this Temple and in three days
I will raise it up again, but he spoke of the Temple of his body. This proves
clearly his Divinity, for who besides him that was God could give Resurrection
to himself.

Eleventhly, He that was in the form of God, and thought it no Robbery to be
equal with God, and whom the Scripture calls Gods Fellow, must needs be God
blessed for ever: but Jesus Christ was in the form of God and thought it no
Robbery to be equal with God, and is called Gods Fellow, therefore he is God.

Twelfthly, He that is the Object, Author and Finisher of the true Believers
Faith, Heb. 12.2.
is God Eternal, Blessed for ever Amen. But Christ is the Object, Author and
Finisher of true Believers Faith, Ergo.

Thirteenthly, He that has Power to Baptize with, and give the holy Spirit,
Mat. 3.11 Mar. 1.4. Ephesians. 4.8, 9, 10, 11.
and the saving graces thereof, is God. But the Lord Jesus Christ has power to
Baptize with and give the holy Spirit, Ergo, He shall baptize you with the holy
Spirit and Fire: when he ascended up on high he gave gifts to men, etc.

Fourteenthly, He who can in his own Name, and by his own Power and Authority,
give power or privilege to others to become the Sons of God, must needs be
God. But the gospel shows that this power the Lord Jesus Christ has, Ergo,
Joh. 1.11, 12.
-- He came unto his own, and his own received him not, but as many as Received
him, to them gave HE power to become the Sons of God, even to them that
believed in his name. He Adopts, Regenerates and makes men and women Gods
Children by the effectual workings of his own blessed Spirit in their hearts,
by which they are Interessed into all the Privileges, Promises and Blessings
of the Covenant of Grace, which none can do but God alone.

Fifteenth, He that is the Believers life is God; Deuteronomy. 30.20. Col. 3.4.
but Jesus Christ is the Believers Life: therefore God.

Sixteen, He that is Omnipresent must be God: but the gospel shows the Lord
Jesus is Omnipresent, who, can go out of Christ's Presence? Lo, Mat. 28. ult.
I am with you always to the end of the world.

Seventeen, He that sees all things, or before whom all things are naked and
bare, and hears all the Cries and Prayers of his People in what place or corner
of the earth soever they live: is God. Bernardus no^^ vidit omnia. Joh, 1.48.
Act. 9:11.
But all this the gospel shows to be true of the Lord Jesus Christ: Ergo.

Eighteen, He that is the Savior of all the Elect and Chosen People of the
Lord, is God: but Jesus Christ is the Savior of all such and therefore God.
How often is he called our Savior, Neither is there salvation in any other.
Act. 4.12.
His name shall be called Jesus.

Nineteen, He that can and will Raise the Dead by his own power at the Last
Day, is God. But Jesus Christ will raise the Dead by his own power at the last
Day; Ergo, Joh. 6.44. chapter 5.28.
No man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him, and I
will raise him up at the last day. Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in
which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth, etc.

Thus we have briefly showed the gospel is glorious in respect of the
Revelation that is made therein of the Lord Jesus

First, In respect of the excellency of his Person, which we have showed
appears by his being Man.

Secondly, By his being God which has been evinced.

Thirdly, His glory and excellency consists in his being both God and Man;
truly Man and truly God in one Person. Can Heaven and Earth make a Lovely and
an Admirable Beauty? O then Christ is he.

He is David's Root, and David's Offspring; David's Lord, and David's Son. See
Metaphor Branch and Root.

Quest.
What Kind of Beauty and Perfections, is the Beauty and are the perfections of
our Lord Jesus Christ?

Answ.
You have heard it is the beauty of God; the beauty of Man, the perfection of
those Beauties, which are in God and Man. But to answer this Question more
distinctly.

1. He is the original of all Beauties and Perfections of Beauty, that is in
Angels, the Soul, the Body, the Face of a Man, the Sun, the Stars, the
Firmament, etc.

2. His Beauty is a desirable Beauty, saw ye him whom my Soul loves, with my
soul have I desired thee in the night? Isa. 26.9. Ps. 27.4.
One thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after: that I may
dwell in the house of the Lord for ever that I may behold the Beauty of the
Lord and inquire in his Temple. And hence he is called the desire of all
Nations.

3. It Is holy and chaste beauty, there is no snare nor pollution in it; Joseph
was a beautiful Person, but it was attended with a Snare, here you may look and
love and fear no danger.

Prove. 31.30.
4. It is a Real beauty, not a seeming beauty, a paint on a wall. What Is humane
beauty to the beauty of the Son of God?

5. Christ's beauty is a soul engaging beauty, how did it make Moses to leave
all, Peter and John leave all: who ever saw him and could forbear to Love him,
neglect all and follow him?

6. It is a Communicative beauty, he can transmit his beauty to the making
others beautiful, Ezekiel. 16.14.
and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty, for it was perfect
through the comeliness which I put upon thee, etc.

7. It is satisfying and delighting beauty, it fills and contents each Soul to
the full who beholds it.

8. It is a mystical and hidden beauty, carnal eyes cannot see it, they behold
no beauty nor comeliness in him to desire him. Isa. 53.2.


9. It is an admirable and wonderful beauty: Angels in Heaven, and Saints on
Earth are amazed and stand astonished at the sight thereof.

10. It Is a lasting and never fading beauty: The beauty of Mortals is like a
flower which withers and passes away in a Moment.

You gentle Youths whose chaster Breasts do beat
With pleasing Raptures, and Loves generous heat:
And Virgins Kind, from whose unguarded eyes
Passion often steals your hearts by fond surprise:
Behold the Object, this alone is he!
Ah none like Christ did ever mortals see!
He is all fair; in him's not one ill feature:
Ten thousand times more fair than any Creature
That lives, or ever lived on the earth,
His beauty so amazingly shines forth.
Angelick nature is enamored so,
They Love him dearly, and admire him too.
His head is like unto the purest Gold;
His curled Tresses lovely to behold.
And such a brightness sparkles from his eyes,
As when Aurora gilds the morning Skies:
And though so bright, yet pleasant like the Doves;
Charming all hearts, where rest diviner loves.
Look on his beauteous cheeks and thou wilt espy,
The Rose of Sharon dect in Royalty.
His smiling Lips, his speech, and words so sweet,
That all delights and joy in them do meet,
Which tend at once to Ravish Ear and Sight,
And to a Kiss all heavenly Souls invite.
The image of his Father's in his face:
His inward parts exce. he is full of Grace.
If heaven and earth can make a rare complexion,
Without a spot, or the least imperfection;
Here, here it is; it in this Prince does shine:
He Is altogether lovely, all Divine.
If you his beauty saw, his Riches weigh:
'Twill charm your eyes, your best affections sway,
And in dark minds spring an eternal day.
He Is fairer than all others; Beauty such:
As none can be enamored on too much
This Object choose, yield him a holy Kiss
That thou at last may sing, Raptured in Bliss,
My Well beloved's mine, and I am His.
Secondly, Christ is glorious in respect of his Offices as Mediator. See
Mediator; also King, Priest and Prophet.

Thirdly, As the gospel is glorious upon the Consideration of the Revelation or
Discovery which is made therein of Jesus Christ in respect of the excellency of
his Person and Perfections, so likewise it is glorious as it reveals or makes
known his glorious love to the Children of Men.

Christ's love glorious love*
Christ's Love held forth in the gospel is glorious Love

1. From the earliness of it, he loved us from Everlasting. We love him because
he first loved us, he loved us when we had none to him; 1 John 4.19.
nay when we were his Enemies and hated him.

2. Christ's Love is a glorious Love upon the account of the freeness of it,
there was no constraint laid upon him to fix his eye upon fallen man, Hos. 14.4.
the Soul is Christ's own free and voluntary Choice, and he does not grutch us
his Love, he does not think he is too High, too Rich, too Honorable or too
good for poor sinners.

3. Christ's Love held forth in the gospel is a glorious Love, in that it is a
drawing, Hos. 11.3. 1 John 4.19. 1 Kin. 19.20. Luke 14.23.
engaging or attracting Love, it is like Elijahs mantle which he cast upon
Elisha, Christ's Love has a kind of Compulsion in it, not by Violence but by
sweet Influence.

4. Christ's Love held forth in the gospel is a glorious Love, in that it is an
undeserved love, an unmerited love. Where Is the soul that can say it deserves
Christ's Love? some will say, O such a person is worthy she deserves and merits
your Love, but it cannot be said so here.

5. Christ's Love held forth in the gospel is glorious Love in respect of the
strength of it; what Solomon speaks of Love, Cant. 8.6. is true in respect of
Christ, his love is stronger than death. Cant. 8.6.


1. Consider from whence it brought him.

2. Consider whether it brought him.

3. Consider how it stripped him and disrobed him.

4. Consider what he endured and underwent, as the Effect of his great Love and
Affection.

6. Christ's Love held forth in the gospel is glorious Love, because it is a
matchless Love, it is wonderful, it is so deep no finding of a bottom, so long no
measuring of it, none never loved as Christ loved us, Ephesians. 3.17.18, 19. Rev.
1.5.
he has loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood.

7. Christ's Love is a glorious Love in that it is a conjugal or an espousal
Love, Christ loves not as the Master loves his Servant, nor (only) as the
Father loves his dear Child, but as a Bridegroom his Spouse, the choice and
delight of his heart, or as a man loves his dear Wife.

8. Christ's love held forth in the gospel is glorious love in that it is an
abiding and eternal love, Romans 8.35. Joh. 13.1.
nothing can separate the Soul from Christ's love; having loved his own that
were in the world he loved them unto the end.

9. Christ's love is glorious love, because it is a love of complacency, he
takes delight in his love, and in the soul beloved. Christ loves all men with a
love of pity, but he loves his Elect with a love of Complacency.

10. Christ's love held forth in the gospel is glorious love, because it draws
forth or does beget glorious love in the Soul to him; the love which is in us
to him, is but the glorious Effects of his love to us. It makes us to love him
so as to admire him, not being able to set his worth and excellency forth:
Glorious love causes a longing and languishing till the soul enjoys Christ,
Cant. 5. ult.
it is with the soul as 'twas with Ahab touching Naboths Vineyard. Christ runs
much in the Mind and Thought of such; yea, and it makes them willing to go
through hardships and difficulties for him as Jacob did for Rachel, such will
abide with Christ in Adversity as Jonathan did with David, it carries the Soul
to love Christ above all other things.

Glorious love is attended with fruit, Simon son of Jonah love thou me more
than these? Joh. 20.
feed my sheep --. If you love me keep my Commandments.

Such delight in Christ's Presence, and greatly prize every token of his Divine
love and grace, and mourn at Christ's absence, nothing will comfort if Christ be
gone. Glorious love leads the Soul to visit Christ often, and to love them that
he loves, and and long to look for his appearing.

Glorious Riches of Christ shines forth in the Gospel.
Thirdly, The gospel is glorious in respect of the glorious subject of it,
(viz.) Jesus Christ, upon the consideration of the discovery there is made
therein of his glorious Riches. 1. The gospel shows that Christ is Rich. 2. In
what respect he is Rich. 3. That he is gloriously Rich; it also Reveals why he
is held forth to be so Rich.

1. Riches imply plenty, and plenty of good things, whether it lie in Money,
Lands, Houses, Wares, etc. He that has abundance of either having absolute
propriety in them is accounted Rich. In Christ are hid all the Treasuries of
Wisdom and Knowledge. Col. 2.3.


1. Christ is Rich in Wisdom. 2. Christ is Rich in Grace, Ephesians, 1.7. 3. Christ
is Rich in Goodness, Romans 2.4. 4. Christ is Rich in Glory, Ephesians. 1.18. Chap.
3.16.
Quest.
How did Christ come by his Riches?

Answ.
1. He was Rich from Eternity, he is God and so all things in heaven and earth
are his, all things that the Father has, are mine, (says Christ) Joh. 16.15.

Heb. 1.2.
2. He is Rich as Mediator; so it pleased the father in him all fullness should
dwell, he was made heir of all things.

Mat. 28.18. Joh. 13.3.
3. The gospel shows the father has given all things to him he came by them as
the free Donation of the Father.

4. Christ obtained his Riches also by Conquest, he has recovered them for us
by overcoming his and our Enemies, all the Riches Christ has as Mediator, he
got by quest, as Israel got Canaan Sin and Satan, those spiritual Thieves had
Robbed us of our Riches, but Jesus Christ has rescued or recovered them again
out of the hands of these Robbers.

Ephesians. 4.8. chap. 1.14 Ps. 78.54. Act. 20.27
5. Christ (the gospel shows) has obtained his Riches by purchase, Grace is
purchased, gifts are purchased, glory is purchased, the Church which is called
his Inheritance is purchased; Heaven is purchased.

Quest.
How do you make it appear that Jesus Christ is gloriously Rich?

Answ.
1. Because he had enough to pay all our debts, yet never a one of us owed less
than Ten Thousand Talents. Mac: 18.


2. Christ's Riches were glorious Riches because they will satisfy glorious
Justice, which no other Riches could do, no not the Riches of Ten Thousand
Worlds, nor all the worth and Riches of the Angels of Heaven.

3. Because he provides for and maintains all in heaven and earth at his own
charges, and as all have their beings from him, so likewise they are fed and
sustained by him, Psalm. 104.24. Col. 1.16, 17.
they all eat at his Table, none keeps such a house, has such a family as
Christ, he has a good stock, great comings in that thus abundantly lays out.

4. Christ's Riches are glorious Riches, appears in that he has enriched so
many Men and women since the World begun, and not only so but also with variety
of Choice and precious Riches, oh what abundance of Souls has the Lord Jesus
enriched, thousands and ten thousands, how many before the Law, and under the
Law and under the Gospel, who can account or reckon up their number? John
declares the number of them that he beheld Round about the Throne to be ten
thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, how many has he made
great, Rev. 5.11.
Advanced on high, honored greatly on earth, bestowed vast Treasures and
Riches upon, how many Millions has he Adorned and gloriously Dect with Jewels,
Precious Stones and Pearls of an inestimable value* and yet never the poorer.

5. Christ's glorious Riches appears in that he is generally Rich; Rich in all
things, all the gold and silver and precious stones in the world are his, he is
the proper Proprietor of them, the earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof.
The Cattle upon a thousand hills. The Wool, Flax, and Oil are his, nay moreover
all Divine virtues and spiritual gifts are his, he is Rich in wisdom and
knowledge, in grace and glory.

6. Christ is gloriously Rich, appears in that he has a Kingdom, yea a glorious
vast and splendent Kingdom and Crown to give to every one of his faithful
followers. Every Saint shall have a Kingdom and Crown that fades not away;
Rev. 2.10.
Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.

7. Because his Riches are of such an Excellent Nature that they enrich the
Soul of Man; other Men may have vast Riches, may have store of gold and silver,
and other good things, and yet none of these Riches can enrich their Souls,
spiritually they may be poor and miserable notwithstanding their great
abundance.

8. Christ is gloriously Rich appears in that he has enough to enrich all,
come who will, thousands and ten thousands, yea millions of thousands if they
come to him, he has Riches of grace and glory for them all. Oh there is
abundance, yea a redundancy of grace and Riches in Christ, he is as fall of
grace as the Sea is full of water, or the Sun is full of Light.

9. Christ is gloriously Rich because his Riches are Incomparable, in respect
of their nature and quality; Prove. 3.13, 14, 15
Happy is the man (says Solomon) that finds wisdom and the man that gets
understanding, for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
silver, or the gain thereof than fine gold, she is more precious then Rubies
and all the things thou can desire are not to be compared unto her A little
Faith though it be but as a grain of Mustard seed is worth more then Thrones,
Crowns and Kingdoms of the earth, one dram of grace is better then all the gold
of Ophir.

10. Christ's Riches are glorious Riches because they cannot be spent, Christ's
Treasury is inexhaustible, it can never be drawn dry, Christ gives abundantly
out, but never wastes his Stores, nor has a farthing the less, the Riches of
Christ are unsearchable; O the height, the depth, the breadth and length of
Christ's Riches, who can find out the bottom of his Rich love and grace, the
bottom of his Rich wisdom and knowledge, we may well cry out upon this account,
with the Apostle, O the depth of the Riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
God, Romans 11.33.
how unsearchable are his Judgments and his ways past finding out.

11. Christ's Riches are glorious riches, because his riches are harmless (as a
Divine well observes) they are riches that will not hurt nor harm the Souls of
such that possess them, never were any made worse by being spiritually Rich.
The riches of the World have undone many, they have been as Thorns to them, by
which they have been peirced through with many sorrows. Many will one day curse
the Day that ever they had such store of earthly riches; Riches are a snare to
the Possessors, hence Christ says, it is hard for a Rich man to enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven.

12. Christ's riches are glorious riches, because they are satisfying riches.
Silver and Gold will not satisfy; he that loves silver shall not be satisfied
with silver, Eccl. 5.10
nor he that loves abundance of Increase: he that has Christ and his riches
has enough, nay he has all, he has Pardon and Peace of Conscience, what can he
desire more that has God and Christ and a Title to Heaven. Hence the Scripture
says, Joh. 4.13, 14.
he shall abide satisfied, such thirst no more, their Inordinate desire after
the world is allayed.

13. Lastly, Christ's riches are glorious riches because they are Permanent,
they are lasting, yea everlasting riches. Other riches fly away like smoke,
they are here to day and gone in a moment with one spark of fire or with one
blast at sea, but Christ's riches are durable, riches and honor are with me yea
durable riches and righteousness. Prove. 8.18.


Quest.
Thirdly, Why is Christ held forth in the Gospel to be thus gloriously Rich?

Answ.
1. That the Doubts and Scruples that are in sinner hearts might be removed, is
there enough in Christ, is there enough Grace, enough Pardon, enough Strength,
etc.

2. Because the Gospel holds Christ forth to be the store house of all Divine
grace and blessings, he is ordained to convey all spiritual Riches to his
Church and to every Member thereof.

3. To allure and engage souls to love him and close in with him, how can any
refuse such a friend, reject such a Savior, that is so beautiful to look upon
and also so exceeding Rich.

4. That it might leave all men and women without excuse in the great Day, what
will they have to say that reject such a Savior, that turn their backs upon
such a Christ, when they are called to answer in the Day of Judgment.

5. To relieve the tempted Soul.

6. To strengthen the Faith and cheer the hearts of all that do believe in him.

Christ's glorious power shines forth in the gospel.
Fourthly, The gospel is glorious in respect of Christ the glorious Object of
it, as it reveals his glorious Power.

Power in Scripture is taken two manner of ways, or it shows a twofold power in
Christ.

1. A Commanding Power, his power of Sovereignty, or Regal power, that which we
call Authority.

2. The power of working or effecting that which he would have done. Some have
power to command, but want a power to Effect that which they command; cannot
accomplish what they would have done, but what Christ commands he can do or
cause to be done at his Pleasure.

1. I shall show that the power of Christ is a glorious power.

2. Show why Christ has such power.

1. Christ has a commanding Power, he has great Authority, he has a Regal
Power or Superiority over all.

1. Over Angels. 2. Over the Church. 3. Over the Devils.
Christ is meant hereby.
I will lay upon the shoulders of Eliakim, the Keys of the house of David, Isa.
22.22. Keys is a borrowed speech signifying Government and Legal Power, Christ
has the Keys of David, Rev. 3.7. All Power in Rule and Government, in
Commanding, Forbidding, Punishing, Binding, Loosing, Damning, Saving, is in
Christ's hand; See Christ the Head, and Heir of all things. Keys of Hell and
Death signifies Christ's Regal power over the Devils, and delivering up unto
Death and Hell, or keeping out of it.

1 Timothy 6.15.
Over men, mighty men, Kings of the Earth, He is the only Potentate, King of
Kings and Lord of Lords. They are all his Subjects, shall and must Submit to
him.

Rev. 19.16.
4. He has an universal Power, therefore glorious Power; the Sun, the Moon, the
Stars, the Winds, the Seas obey him.

Ps. 15.3.
5. Christ's Power is absolute, he bears the Image of God, he is God; (as you
heard before). None has absolute power but God; he does what he pleases

6. Christ's Power is Just, therefore glorious in Power; it is not a Might
without Right; Mat. 28.18.
it is in him Essentially as God, and is given to him as Mediator: in the one
Respect he derived it from none, in the other sense he received it from the
Father.

7. Christ's Power is Infinite; he made the World, he upholds the World,
therefore glorious in Power. Ephesians. 1.21, 22.
He could have made a Thousand Worlds, can do beyond all that we can conceive
or speak.

8. Christ's Power is glorious because he can bring all other Power to naught in
a moment at his pleasure whether of Men or Devils.

9. Christ's Power is glorious Power, in that it is everlasting Power. Men may
be powerful for a time, but they may soon lose it; must die and so cannot hold
it long, but Christ sits King for ever, Psalm. 145.13, and 66, 5. Psalm. 104.32.
his power is from everlasting to everlasting, of his Kingdom there shall be no
end.

10. Christ's power is Dreadful, he looks upon the earth and it Trembles, he
can make all tremble before him: who can Thunder like God.

1. He has a glorious commanding Voice.

2. A glorious restraining voice, what is swifter than the Sun which he can
stop in a moment.

3. Glorious in his reproving voice, Psalm. 50.21.

4. In his threatening voice, Rev. 2.16. and Chap. 2.23.

11. He has a Glorious, Victorious, Conquering and Subduing Power he has
overcome Sin, Devil, Death, Hell, etc.

12. Christ's Power is Glorious, because nothing is too hard for him to do, nay
nothing is hard for him to do, he can do what he will with a word of his mouth.

13. Christ's Power extends not only over the Body but over the Soul also works,
mightily in us as well as for us, and can do wonderful things by weak
Instruments, by foolish and contemptible ones in the eye of the World. What
mighty things did he do by a few poor Fishermen, and others not accounted off.

14. Lastly, Nothing is hard for Christ to do, though all the Devils of Hell, and
Men on Earth oppose and resist him. I will work and who shall let it. Isa.
43.13.


Quest.
Why has Christ as Mediator such great and glorious Power given to him.

Answ.
1. From the greatness of his work he is to accomplish.

2. Because no Souls [whatsoever Discouragements they meet with] should despair
in coming to him or in relying upon him.

3. That he might be feared and dreaded by all, yea that his very enemies might
tremble before him.

4. That he might be honored and adored, Honor belongs to Sovereignty.

The Gospel glorious in respect of the Revelation made therein of the Holy
Ghost.
Thirdly, As the gospel is Glorious in respect of the Revelation made therein of
God the Father and of our Lord Jesus Christ. So likewise in Respect of the Holy
Ghost; the gospel shows the Spirit in himself to be a distinct living powerful
intelligent Divine Person. Not only a distinct self subsisting Person, but also
a participant of the Divine Nature not the chief of all created Spirits and so
the head of all good Angels as some imagine but that he is uncreated, truly and
ready God coeternal with the Father and the Son. This we shall speak a little
unto together with his glorious work Office and Operations.

The holy Ghost is God.
First, The Word of God holds forth and positively declares that the holy
Spirit is, in himself a distinct intelligent Divine Person, and which ought to
be believed concerning this great truth ( viz.) the Diety and Personality of
the holy Ghost, may be seen in the ensuing Testimonies, according as they are
Collected to our hands by a Reverend Divine.

Dr. O. upon the Trinity, page 90, 91.
Psalm. 33.6. By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made and all the host of
them by the spirit of his mouth.

Job 26.13. By his spirit he has garnished the Heavens.

Psalm. 104.30. Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created.

Mat. 28.19. Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the holy Ghost.

Act. 1.16. That Scripture must needs has been fulfilled which the holy Ghost
by the mouth of David spoke.

Act. 5.3. Peter said to Ananias why has Satan filled thy heart to lie to the
holy Ghost, Ver. 4. Thou have not lied to man but to God.

1 Cor. 3.16. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of
God dwells in you.

1 Cor. 12.11. All these works that one and the self same Spirit, dividing to
every severally man as he will. And there are diversities of operations, but it
is the same God which works all in all.

2 Cor. 13.14. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Love of God, and
communion of the holy Spirit be with you all.

Acts 20.28. Take heed to the Flock over which the holy Ghost has made you
Overseers.

Mat. 12.31. All manner of Sin and Blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, but
the blasphemy against the holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.

Psalm. 139.7. Whether shall I go from thy Spirit.

Joh. 14.26. But the Comforter which is the holy Ghost whom the father will
send in my name he shall teach you all things.

Luke 12.12. The holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to
say:

Acts 13.3: And as they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the holy Ghost said
separate me Barnabas and Paul for the work whereunto I have called them.

Ver. 4. They being sent forth by the holy spirit departed, etc.

It Is evident upon consideration that there is not any thing which we believe
concerning the holy Ghost, but that it is plainly revealed and declared in
these Testimonies.

He is directly called God, Act. 5.3. which the Socinians will not say is by
virtue of an exaltation unto an Office or Authority (as they say of the Son;)
that he is an Intelligent voluntary Divine Person, he knows, he works as he
will, which things if in their frequent repetition they are not sufficient to
evince an Intelligent Agent, a Personal subsistence, that has Being, Life,
Will, We must confess that the Scripture was written on purpose to lead us into
mistakes, and misapprehensions of that we are under penalty of eternal Ruin,
rightly to apprehend and believe. It declares also, that he is the Author and
worker of all sorts of Divine operations requiring Immensity, Omnipotency,
Omnisciency and all other Divine excellencies unto their working and effecting.
Moreover it is revealed that he is peculiarly to be believed in, and may be
sinned against. Also that he together with the Father and the Son created the
World, Joh. 33 4.
the spirit of God has made me, that he is the Author of all grace in
Believers and order in the Churches. The sum is, that the holy Ghost is a
Divine Distinct Person, and neither merely the power or virtue of God, nor any
created Spirit whatsoever. This plainly appears from what is Revealed
concerning him, for he who is placed in the same series or order with Divine
Persons without the least note of difference, or distinction from them as to an
Interest in Personality; who has the names proper to a Divine Person only, and
is frequently and directly called by them, who also has Personal Properties,
and is the Voluntary Author of Personal Divine Properties and the proper Object
of Divine Worship, he is a Distinct Divine Person. And if these things be not
a sufficient Evidence and Demonstration of a Divine Intelligent Substance, I
shall as was said before, despair to understand any thing that is expressed and
declared by words. But now thus it is with the Holy spirit according to the
Revelation made thereof in the word and gospel of God.

One Consideration which has in part been before proposed, I shall premise, to
free the subject of our Argument from ambiguity. And this is that, this word or
name Spirit is used sometimes to denote the Spirit of God himself, and
sometimes his gifts and graces, the Effects of his operation on the Souls of
men, and this our Adversaries in this cause are forced to confess, and thereon
in all their writings distinguish between the holy spirit and his Effects. This
alone being supposed, I say it is impossible to prove the Father to be a
Person, or the Son to be so, both which are not acknowledged any other way,
(than we may and do prove the holy Ghost) to be so. For he to whom all Personal
Properties, Attributes, Adjuncts, Acts and Operations are ascribed, and unto
whom they do belong, and to whom nothing is or can be truly and properly
ascribed, but what may and does belong unto a Person, he is a Person, and him
are we taught to believe so to be. So know we the Father to be a Person; as
also the Son. For our knowledge of things is more by their properties and
operations, then by their Essential forms, especially is this so with respect
to the Nature, Being and Existence of God which are in themselves absolutely
incomprehensible* Now I shall not confirm the Assumption of this Argument with
reference unto the holy Ghost from this or that particular Testimony nor from
the assignation of any single Personal property unto him, but from the constant
uniform tenor of the Scriptures in ascribing all those properties unto him. And
we may add hereunto that things are so ordered in the wisdom of God, that there
is no personal property that may be found in an Infinite Divine Nature, but it
is in one place or other ascribed unto him.

First, He is placed in the same rank and order without any note of Difference
or Distinction as to a distinct Interest in the Divine Nature, that is as we
shall see, personality, with other Divine Persons, Mat. 28.19. Baptizing them
in the name of the Father, and the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. 1 John* 5.7.
There be three that bear witness in Heaven, the Father, the Son, and the
Spirit, and these three are one. 1 Cor. 12.3, 4, 5, 6. No man can say the Lord
Jesus Christ is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost; Now there are diversities of
gifts, but the same Spirit, and there are differences of administrations but
the same Lord, and there are diversities of operation but it is the same God
which works all in all. Neither does a denial of his Divine Being and
distinct Existence, leave any tolerable sense unto these expressions. For read
the words of the first place from the Mind of the Socinians, and see what it is
can be gathered from them; Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the virtue or efficacy of the Father. Can any thing be more
absonant from Faith and Reason, than this absurd expression? and yet is it the
direct sense, if it be any, that those Men put upon the words. To join a
quality with acknowledged Persons and that in such things and cases, as wherein
they are proposed under a Personal Consideration, is a strange kind of Mystery,
and the like may be manifested concerning the other places.

Secondly, He also has the Names proper to a Divine Person only. For he is
expressly called God, Act. 5. He who is termed the holy Ghost, ver. 3. and the
Spirit of the Lord, ver. 9. is called also God, ver. 4. Now this is the name of
a Divine Person, on one account or other. The Socinians would not allow Christ
to be called God, were he not a Divine Person, though not by Nature, yet by
Office and Authority. And I suppose they will not find out an Office for the
Holy Ghost whereunto he might be exalted on the account whereof he might become
God, seeing this would acknowledge him to be a Person which they deny. So he is
called the Comforter, Joh. 16 7. A Personal Appellation this is also, and
because he is the Comforter of all Gods People it can be the name of none but a
Divine Person. In the same place also it is frequently affirmed that He shall
come, that he shall and will do such and such things, all of them declare him
to be a Person.

Thirdly, He has Personal properties assigned unto him, as a Will. 1 Cor.
12.11. Chapter 2.10.
He divides to every man severally as he will, and understanding the spirit
searches all things, yea the deep things of God. As also the actings that are
ascribed unto him are all of them such, as undeniably affirm Personal
Properties in their Principle and Agent. For

Fourthly, Genesis 1.3.
He is the voluntary Author of Divine operations he of old cherished the
Creation, the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. He formed and
garnished the Heavens, he Inspired, Acted and Spoke in and by the Prophets,
well spoke the holy Ghost by Isaiah the Prophet unto our Fathers. Act. 28.25,
26. 2 Pet. 1.21.
The Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man. But holy men of God
spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost: He Regenerateth, Enlighteneth,
Sanctifies, Comfort, Instructs, Leads, Guides all the Disciples of
Christ, as the Scriptures every where testify. Now all these are Personal
Operations, and cannot with any pretense of Sobriety or consistency with Reason
be constantly and uniformly assigned unto a quality or virtue. He is as the
Father and Son, God with the Properties of Omniscience and Omnipotence, of
Life, Understanding and Will; and by these Properties, works, acts, and
produces effects according to Wisdom, Choice, and Power.

Fifthly, The same regard is had to him in Faith, Worship, and Obedience, as
unto the other Persons of the Father and Son. For our being Baptized into his
name is our solemn engagement to believe in him, to yield obedience to him, and
to worship him, as it puts the same obligation upon us to the Father and the
Son. So also in reference unto the worship of the Church, he Commands that the
Ministers of it be separated unto himself. The holy Ghost said, separate me
Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them, Acts 13.2. ver. 4.
So they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed. Which is comprehensive
of all Religious Worship of the Church.

And on the same account is he sinned against as Act. 5.3, 4, 9. for there is
the same Reason of Sin and Obedience. Against whom a man may sin formally and
ultimately, him he is bound to Obey, Worship and believe in. And this can be
no quality, but God himself, for what may be the sense of this expression, thou
have lied to the efficacy of God in his operations? or how can we be formally
obliged unto Obedience to a quality? There must then an antecedent unto Faith,
Trust and Religious Obedience be supposed as the ground of rendering a Person
capable of being guilty of Sin toward any. For Sin is but a failure in Faith,
Obedience or Worship. These therefore are due unto the holy Ghost; or a man
could not sin against him so signally and fatally as some are said to do in the
foregoing Testimonies.

I say therefore unto this part of our Cause, as unto the other, that unless we
will cast off all Reverence of God, and in a kind of Atheism, (which as I
suppose, the prevailing wickedness of this Age has not yet arrived unto) say
that the Scriptures were written on purpose to decieve us, and to lead us into
mistakes about and misapprehensions of what it proposes unto us, we must
acknowledge the holy Ghost to be a Substance, a Person, God. yet distinct from
the Father, and the Son. For to tell us, that he will be our Comforter, that he
will Teach us, Lead us, Guide us, that he spoke of old, in and by the Prophets,
that they were moved by him, acted by him, 1 Cor. 2.10
that he searches the deep things of God, works as he will, that he appoints
to himself Ministers in the Church. In a word, to declare in places innumerable
what he has done, what he does, what he says and speaks, how he acts and
proceeds, what his will is, and to warn us that we grieve him not, sin not
against him with things innumerable of the like nature, and all this while to
oblige us to believe that he is not a Person, an Helper, a Comforter, a
Searcher, a Willer, but a quality in some especial operations of God or his
power and virtue in them, were to distract men not to Instruct them, and leave
them no certain conclusion but this, that there is nothing certain in the whole
book of God. Gospel glorious in respect of the works and operations of the holy
Spirit.
And of no other Tendency are these and the like immaginations of our
Adversaries in this matter. Dr. Owen.

Secondly, The Gospel is glorious in respect of the Revelation made therein of
the Spirit touching his glorious Works and Operations.

1. The framing, forming and miraculous Conception of the body of our Lord
Jesus Christ in the Maximum in tota creatura Testimonium de Divinitate spiritus
sancti corpus Domini est; quod ex spiritu sancto esse creditur secundum
Evangelistam, Mat. 1. Sicut Angelus ad Jos^^phum dicit quod in ea natum est de
spiritu sancto est. Athanasius de fid. un. and Trin.

Creatrix virtus altissimi, superveniente spiritu sancto, in virginem Mariam,
Christi Corpus fabricavit; quo illo usus Templo sine viri natus est semine.
Didym. de Sp. Sanct. lib. 2.


Womb of the Blessed Virgin was the peculiar and special work of the Holy
Ghost. This work I acknowledge in respect of designation and the Athoritative
disposal of things is ascribed unto the Father, for so the Lord Christ speaks
unto him, A body have thou prepared me, Heb. 10.6. but this preparation does
not signify the Actual, Forming and making Ready of that body, but the eternal
designation of it, was prepared in the Council and Love of the Father. As to
the voluntary assumption, it is ascribed to the Son himself. Heb. 2.14. For as
much as the Children were partakers of flesh and blood he himself partook of
the same. He took unto him a Body and Soul, entire humane nature, as the
Children or all Believers the same Synedochically expressed by flesh and blood,
ver. 16. He took on him the Seed of Abraham. But immediate Divine Efficiency in
this matter was the peculiar work of the Holy Ghost. Mat. 1.18. When his
Mother Mary was Espoused to Joseph, before they came together she was found to
be with Child of the holy Ghost: Luke 1.35. The Angel answered and said unto
her, the holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall
overshadow thee, therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
shall be called the Son of God.

(1.) The Person working is the holy Ghost, he is the wonderful Operator in
this glorious work, and therein the power of the most high was exerted. For the
Power of the most High is neither explicatory of the former expression, the
holy Ghost: as though he were only the power of the most High. Nor is it
adjoining of a distinct Agent or Cause unto him, as though the holy Spirit and
the power of the most High were distinct Agents in this matter. Only the manner
of his effecting this wonderful matter, concerning which the Blessed Virgin had
made that enquiry, how can this thing be seeing I know not a man.

The holy Ghost (says the Angel) acting in the power of the most high, or in
the Infinite power of God shall accomplish it.

(2.) As the humane nature of Christ was formed by the miraculous working of
the holy Ghost, he was hereby formed absolutely Innocent, Spotless and free
from sin as Adam was in the day he was Created.

(3.) The Spirit also -- the Gospel shows -- in a peculiar manner anointed him
with those extraordinary Powers and Gifts, which were necessary for the
exercise and discharge of his Office; The spirit of the Lord God is upon me,
because he has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek, Isa. 6.1.1.
Luke 4.16.
etc.

4. It was in an especial manner by the power and operation of the holy Ghost
by which he wrought all those great and miraculous works, by which he attested
and confirmed his Doctrine. Hence it is said God wrought miracles by him, Jesus
of Nazareth a man approved of God by miracles, wonders and signs which God did
by him. Act. 2.22.
He affirmed that what he did, he did by the finger of God, that is, Luke
11.20. Luke 4.36
by the infinite power of God; hence these mighty works are called (...)
Powers, because of the power of the Spirit of God put forth for their working
and effecting. See Mark 6.5.

5. The Lord Jesus was guided, directed, comforted and supported in the whole
course of his Ministry, Temptations, Obedience and sufferings by the Spirit, he
was led thereby into the wi^^derness presently after he was baptized, the holy
Spirit guided him to begin his contest with Satan. Dr Owen.
The continuation of the discourse in Luke will not admit that any other spirit
can be intended, and Jesus being full of the holy spirit returned from Jordan
and was led by the spirit unto the Wilderness, namely, by that spirit which he
was full of. And it was by the spirits assistance that he was carried
triumphantly through the course of his temptations, in the power of the spirit
he returned (...) into Galilee, that is, Luke 4.14.
powerfully enabled by the holy spirit unto the discharge of his work.

6. Moreover the Scripture affirms that he offered himself up unto God through
the eternal Spirit, Heb. 9.4.
some understand by the eternal Spirit in this place is meant the Divine
nature, his Deity giving sustenance unto his humane nature in the Sacrifice of
himself, in that he had power to lay down his life, and to take it up again,
yet many able Divines (both Ancient and Modern) do Judge that it is the Person
of the holy Ghost that is intended. See Dr. O. page 143.


7. It is also thought by the Learned that the holy Spirit was eminently
concerned in raising him up again from the dead, but we cannot dwell here.

8. The work of the new Creation is managed and gloriously carried on by the
workings and operations of the holy Ghost, it is the work and office of the
Spirit to make the whole work of the Mediation of Christ effectual to the Souls
of the Elect.

9. All those glorious and extraordinary gifts that were powered forth either
upon the Prophets or Apostles were by the operations of the holy Spirit. 1 Cor.
12.


10. The gift of Prophecy whether ordinary or extraordinary was always the
immediate effect of the operation of the Spirit who inspired the Penmen of holy
Scripture both of the old and new Testament in the writing and giving of them
forth, and in the opening of and explaining of them to the Sons of Men. The
Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, 2 Pet. 1.21.
but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost.

11. The holy Ghost supplies the bodily absence of Jesus Christ, and by him he
does accomplish all his promises unto his Church.

12. As he represents the Person and supplies the Room, Person and Place of
Christ, so he works and effects whatever the Lord Christ has taken upon
himself to work and effect toward his Saints whereas the work of the Son was
not his own work, but rather the work of the Father; so the work of the holy
Spirit, is not his own work* but rather the work of the Son by whom he is sent
and in whose name he does accomplish it. Howbeit when the spirit of truth is
come, he will guide you into all truth, Joh. 16.13, 14, 15
for he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
speak, and he will show you things to come. He shall Glorify me, for he shall
Receive of mine and shall show it unto you. All things that the Father has are
mine, therefore I said he shall take of mine and show it unto you.

13. The holy Spirit is the Spirit of Grace, and the immediate efficient cause
of all Grace and gracious effects in men wherever there is mention made of
them, or any fruits of them, it must be acknowledged as part of his work, though
he be not expressly named, etc.

Grace is taken two ways in Scripture: (1.) For the Grace, Free Love, and
favor of God toward us. (2.) For the Gracious, Free, and Effectual Operations
in us.


In both senses the holy Spirit is the Author of it as unto us; in the first as
to its Manifestation and Application; in the second as to the Operation it
self. The Nature, Excellency, and Glory of Grace in the latter sense we shall
in the next place insist upon.

But since some men in these days as in former times do much Eclipse the Glory
of the Spirit touching the work of Grace and Operation of the Spirit in
Regeneration, or the quickening them who are dead in Trespasses and Sins, in
affirming that saving Conversion does principally consist in a moral swasion.

It may not be amiss to add something briefly here in confutation of these men
whose Principles are in our Judgment fairly stated by Reverend Doctor Owen Dr.
O. in his book entitled PNEYMATOLOGIA. or a discourse of the Spirit. page 256.
.

(1.) They say that God administreth grace unto all in the declaration of the
Doctrine of the Law and Gospel.

(2.) That the reception of this Doctrine, the belief and practice thereof is
enforced by Promises and Threatenings.

(3.) That the things revealed, taught and commanded are not only good in
themselves, but so suited unto the Reason and Interest of Mankind as that the
mind cannot but be disposed and inclined to receive and obey them unless
overpoured by prejudice and a course of Sin.

(4.) That the Consideration of the Promises and Threatenings of the Gospel is
sufficient to remove these prejudices and course of sin.

(5.) That upon a compliance with the Doctrine of the Gospel and obedience
thereunto men are made partakers of the Spirit, with other privileges of the
New Testament, and have a right unto the promises of the present and future
Life.

This, says the Dr. is a perfect Systeme of Pelagianism. Those that would see
his Answer hereunto, may read from page 257. to page 286.

That we say is this ( viz.) that mere Moral swasion without powerful
Influences and Divine Operations of the holy Ghost, will not bring a Person
effectually to Believe and Close in with Jesus Christ, or work true Conversion
in the Soul, though we always say the power which the holy Ghost puts forth in
Regeneration is such in its acting or exercise, as our Minds, Wills and
Affections are suited to be wrought upon and to be effected by it according to
their nature and natural Operations, Turn thou me, and I shall be turned. Draw
me, we will Run after thee. He does not act in them otherwise than they
themselves are meet to be moved, and move to be acted and act, according to
their own natural Power and Ability. He does not in our Conversion possess the
Mind with any Enthusiastical Impression, nor acts absolutely upon us, as he
did in extraordinary prophetical Inspirations of old: when the Mind and Organs
of the Bodies of Men were merely passive Instruments moved by the spirit above
their own natural Capacity and Activity; not only as to the Principle of
Working, but as to the manner of Operation. But he works on the Minds of Men in
and by their own natural actings through an Immediate Influence and Impression
of his power. Create in me a clean heart, O God. He works to will and to do.
He therefore offers no Christus non, dicit, duxerit, ut illic aliquo modo
intelligamus precedere voluntatem, sed dicit, traxerit quis autem trahitur si
jam volebat? and tamen nemo venit nisi velit, trahitur ergo miris modis ut
velit, ab illo qui novit intus in ipsis hominum cordibus operari non ut
homines, quod fieri non potest, nolentes credant, sed ut volentes ex nolentibus
fiant. August. cont. duas epist. Pelag. cap. 19.

Certum est nos velle, cumvolumus, sed ille facit ut vellemus, de quo dictum
est, Deus est qui operatur in nobis velle Idem. de Great. and lib. Arbit. cap.
16.


Violence or compulsion unto the Will. This, that faculty is not naturally
capable to give admission, unto. If it be compelled it is destroyed. And the
mention that is made in Scripture of compelling, ( compel them to come in)
respects, the certainty of the event, not the manner of the operation on them.

But whereas the will in the depraved condition of fallen nature, is not only
habitually filled and possessed with an aversation from that which is good
spiritually ( Alienated from the life of God.) but also continually acts an
opposition unto it, as being under the power of the carnal Mind, which is
Enmity against God, and whereas this grace of the Spirit in Conversion does
prevail against all this opposition, and is effectual and victorious over it;
it will be inquired how this can any otherwise be done but by a kind of
violence and compulsion, seeing that we have evinced already that Moral
persuasion and objective allurement is not sufficient thereunto.

Answ. It is acknowledged, that in the work of Conversion unto God, though not
in the very act of it, there is a Reaction between Grace and the Will, their
acts being contrary, and that Grace is therein Victorious; and yet no violence
or compulsion is offered unto the Will.

1. The opposition is not ad idem. The Enmity and Opposition that is acted by
the Will against Grace, is against it as objectively proposed unto it. So do
men resist the holy Ghost; that is in the External Dispensation of Grace by the
Word. And if that be alone they may always resist it; the Enmity that is in
them will prevail against it, ye always resist the holy Ghost.

The Will therefore is not forced by any Power put forth in Grace in that way
wherein it is capable of making opposition unto it, but the prevalency of Grace
is of it as it is internal, working really and physically, which is not the
Wills Opposition, for it is not proposed unto it, as that which it may accept
or refuse, but works effectually in it.

2. The will in the first act of Conversion (as even sundry of the Schoolmen
acknowledge) acts not but as it is acted, moves not but as it is moved, and
therefore is passive therein in the sense immediately to be explained. And if
this be not so, it cannot be avoided, but that the act of our turning unto God
is a mere natural act, and not spiritual or gracious. For it is an act of the
Will not enabled thereunto antecedently by Grace. Wherefore it must be
granted, and it shall be proved, that in order of Nature, the acting of Grace
in the will in our Conversion is Antecedent unto its own acting, though in the
same Instant of time, wherein the will is moved it moves; and when it is acted
it acts it self, and preserves its own Liberty in its exercise. There is
therefore herein an inward Almighty secret act of the power of the holy Ghost
producing or effecting in us the Will of Conversion unto God, so acting our
wills, as that they also act themselves and that freely, so Austin. cont. duas
epistol. Pelag lib. 1. Cap. 19. Trahitur, (homo) miris modis, ut velit, ab illo
qui novit intus in ipsis cordibus hominum operari non, ut homines, quod fieri
non posset, nolentes credant, sed ut volentes ex nolentibus fiant.

The holy Spirit who in his power and operation is more intimate, as it were to
the Principles of our Souls than they are to themselves, does with the
preservation, and in the exercise of the liberty of our Wills, effectually work
our Regeneration and Conversion unto God. This is the substance of what we
plead for in this Cause, and which declares the Nature of this work of
Regeneration, as it is an Inward spiritual work, I shall therefore confirm the
Truth proposed with Evident testimonies of Scripture, and Reasons contained in
them or deduced from them.

1. Because the work of Grace in Conversion is expressed by words denoting a
real internal efficiency, such as creating, quickening, forming, giving a new
heart, etc.

2. It is attributed to be wholly of Grace to the end God might have all the
glory, and all boasting might be excluded.

But (1.) The Doctrine of these men as the Doctor observes, ascribe the whole
glory of our Regeneration and Conversion unto our Selves, and not to the grace
of God, for that act of our wills on this supposition, whereby we Convert unto
God is merely an act of our own, and not of the Grace of God, this is evident,
for if the Act it self were of Grace, then would it not be in the power of the
will to hinder it.

(2.) This would leave it absolutely uncertain notwithstanding the Purpose of
God, and the Purchase of Christ whether ever any one in the world should be
converted unto God or no. For when the whole work of Grace is over, it is
absolutely in the power of the will of Man whether it shall be effectual or no.
And so absolutely uncertain, which is contrary to the Covenant, Promise and
Oath of God, unto and with Jesus Christ.

(3.) It is contrary to express Testimonies of Scripture innumerable. Wherein
Actual Conversion unto God is ascribed unto Grace as the immediate effect
thereof. This will further appear afterward. God works in us to will and to
do, Phil. 2.13
the Act therefore it self of willing in our Conversion, is of Gods operation,
and although we will our selves, yet it is he who causes us to will, by
working in us to will and to do.

And if the Act of our will in Believing and Obedience, in our Conversion to
God, be not the effect of his Grace in us, he does not work in us both to will
and to do of his own good pleasure.

1. The work of Conversion it self, and in especial the act of Believing or
Faith it self is expressly said to be of God, to be wrought in us by him, to be
freely given unto us from him; the Scriptures says not that God gives us
ability or power to believe only. Namely, such a power as we may make use of,
if we will or do otherwise, but Faith and Conversion themselves are said to be
the work and effect of God.

Object.
But it maybe Objected that every thing which is actually accomplished in
potentia before. There must therefore be in us a power to Believe before we do
so actually.

The Act of God working Faith in us, is a creating work, for we are his
workmanship created in Christ Jesus. Answ.
And he that is in Christ is a new Creature, Ephesians. 2.10.
now the Effects of creating acts are not in potentia any where but in the
active Power of God, so was the World it self before its actual existence. This
is termed potentia logica; which is no more but a Negation of any Contradiction
to existence; not potentia physica which includes a disposition unto actual
existence. Notwithstanding therefore all these preparatory works of the Spirit
of God which we allow in this matter, there is not by them wrought in the Mind*
and Wills of men such a next power (as they call it) as should enable them to
believe without further actual grace working Faith it self. Wherefore with
respect to believing the first act of God is to work in us to will; So Phil.
1.13. he works in us to will. This God works in us by that grace which
Austin and other Learned men call gratia operans.

Act. 5.
2. Faith and Repentance. It Is said to be given of God. Him has God exalted to
be a Prince and a Savior to give Repentance unto Israel and remission of sin
to you it is given in behalf of Christ not only to believe but to suffer for
his sake By Grace ye are saved through faith, and that not of your selves, it
is gift of God. Our own ability, be it what it will, however assisted and
excited, and Gods gift are contra-distinguished. If it be of our selves it is
not the gift of God, if it be the gift of God it is not of our selves, and the
manner how God bestows this gift upon us is declared, ver. 10. For we are his
workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good work. And from hence Faith is
called the Faith of the operation of God.

3. Love, that precious prevailing Grace is planted in the Soul by the Spirit,
causing the Soul with Delight and Complacency to cleave unto God and his ways,
the Lord God will Circumcise thine heart to love the Lord, Deuteronomy. 30.6. Hope
makes not ashamed because the Love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
holy Ghost, Romans 5.5. The fruit of the spirit is love, Gal. 5.22.

4. It might be further demonstrated by considering how Conversion with the
manner how it is effected, Deuteronomy. 30.6.
is set forth in the holy Scripture; The Lord thy God will circumcise thine
heart and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,
etc. What is this but the putting off the Body of Sin? Col. 2.11. This is the
mediate work of the Spirit of God, no man ever Circumcised his own heart. A new
heart also will I give you, Ezekiel. 36.26.
and a new spirit will I put within you, and will take away the stony heart,
that is, that impotency and enmity which is in our hearts unto Conversion.

5. The work of grace upon the Soul is called a vivisication, we are by nature
dead in Sins and Trespasses; in our Deliverance from thence we are said to be
quickened. The Dead shall hear the voice of the son of God and Live, being made
alive, now no such work can be wrought in us but by an Effectual Communication
of a Principle of Spiritual Life and nothing else will deliver us. Some think
to evade the power of this Argument by saying that all these Expressions are
metaphorical and arguing from them are but fulsome Metaphors. And it is well if
the whole Gospel be not a Metaphor unto them. Dr. O. page 279.


But if there be not an Impotency in us by nature unto all Acts of spiritual
Life, like that which is in a Dead man unto acts of Life natural, if there be
not an alike Power of God required unto our deliverance from that Condition*
and the working in us a Principle of spiritual Obedience as is required unto
the Raising of him that is dead: they may as well say that the Scripture speaks
not truly, as that it speaks metaphorically.

6. Believers are said to be begotten and born again of the Spirit, by which it
appears that our Regeneration is not an Act of our own. I mean not so our own
as by outward helps and assistance to be educed out of the Principles of our
nature. Of his own will begot he us by the word of truth, Jam. 1.18. 1 Pet.
1.23. Joh. 1.13.
etc. Born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, etc. Which were
born not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God. This being so it
behooves them who plead for Active Interest of the will of Man in Regeneration,
to produce some Testimonies of Scripture where it is assigned unto it, as the
Effect unto its proper Cause where is it said that a man is born again or
begotten anew by himself? and if it be granted, as, it must be so, unless
violence be offered not only to the Scripture, but Reason and common sense,
that whatever be our Duty and Power herein, yet these Expressions must denote
an Act of God and not ours, Regeneration being thus proved to be the glorious
working and operation of the holy Ghost, we shall now proceed to show further,
the nature and excellency of grace as it shines forth in the gospel and is
experienced by every sincere Christian.

The Gospel Glorious in respect of Grace and the saving operations of the
spirit.
1. Gospel grace is glorious, because, when received in Truth, it delivers the
Soul from Bondage, it breaks the bonds. For the Soul is not set at liberty by
the bare shedding of Christ's blood, without the application of it by the spirit
or infusion of grace into the heart.

2. The gospel through the grace of it when received in Truth, opens blind
Eyes, it makes them see, that never saw (in a spiritual sense) before, it opens
their eyes that were born blind, how blind was Saul till the gospel grace shone
upon him or rather in him?

3. The gospel through the grace of it, when received in Truth raises the dead
Soul to Life. It Is hereby we come to be quickened, the flesh profits nothing,
it is the Spirit that quickens; (that is) the Humane nature without the Divine
cannot accomplish Salvation for us; nor shall any Soul receive any saving
Benefit by the flesh, or Death of Christ, unless he be quickened by the Spirit.

4. The gospel in the grace of it, when received in Truth; works out that
cursed enmity that is in the heart against God, and thereby reconciles the
sinner to the blessed Majesty of Heaven.

5. The grace of the gospel works Regeneration, makes the sinner another Man, a
new Man. It forms the new Creature in the Soul.

1. It infuses new qualities.

2. It makes the Proud Person humble, and not to vaunt himself.

3. It makes the Unclean Person Chaste, and to loath Lascivious thoughts.

4. It makes hard-hearted sinners full of Bowels.

5. It makes the impatient Soul to bear all things. 1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6, 7.


6. It makes the Covetous Person Liberal and to distribute to the poor.

7. It makes the worst Husband the best Husband, the worst Wife the best Wife,
the worst Children the best Children, the Rebellious ones to be Obedient ones.

6. The gospel in the grace of it, brings the Soul into Union with God. No
Grace, no Christ. God is the Fountain of this Union, Christ is the Conduit-pipe
as Mediator, the Spirit and the grace thereof is the stream. Union is let into
the Soul at this door, no grace no God, no union with him, and no Union with
him no Communion with him.

7. The grace of the gospel washes the polluted Soul; 1 Cor. 6.11. Tit. 3.4, 5
Act. 15.9.
it cleanses the filth of the heart and Pollution of the Life. He put no
difference between them and us, purifying their hearts by faith.

8. The grace of the gospel or saving operations of the Spirit heals the
wounded Soul, he poured in Oil and Wine, etc. Luke 10.34.


9. Gospel grace gives the Soul a right to all the Blessings of a Crucified
Christ, it is that which puts on the Wedding garment. It was a pretty saying of
a good Man.

1. The Father weaves this Garment, he was first concerned about it, he
prepared the matter with which it is made. 2. The Son made it, he has wrought
Righteousness for us. 3. The Spirit puts it on.
10. The grace of the gospel makes a glorious Soul, a glorious Man, a glorious
Woman, a glorious Family, a glorious Church, a glorious City, a glorious
Kingdom, where it is generally received in Truth.

It makes a glorious Soul; It finds it naked, and clothes it. It finds it
starved (as it were,) and feeds it. It finds it wounded, and heals it. It finds
it cold and warms it. It finds it unclean, and sanctifies it. It finds it poor,
and inriches it. It finds it in bonds, and sets it at liberty. It finds it an
Enemy to God, and reconciles it. It finds it Condemned, and justifies it. It
finds it Dead, and gives it Life.

11. The grace of the gospel adornes the Soul, it puts Ornaments upon the head,
and Chains (beyond those of Gold) upon the Neck. It decks it with Jewels, Prove.
1.8. Ezekiel. 16.12, 13. Luke 15*22. 1 Pet. 3, 4.
I decked thee with ornaments I put Bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on
thy neck; I put a Jewel on thy forehead, earings in thine ears, and a Beautiful
Crown on thy head, thou wast dect with Gold and silver, with silk and broidered
work. It puts a Ring on the Finger, it adorns the Soul with a meek and a quiet
Spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.

12. The grace of the gospel makes a man to behold a beauty and glory in the
gospel, to love it, and to suffer for it. The gospel is worth little in the
sight and esteem of that man, that has not the grace of the gospel. What is the
word of grace without the grace of the word.

13. Gospel grace is an excellent preservative against the Plague of Sin. No
Pestilence so bad as this. How shall I (says Joseph) do this thing and sin
against God. It is also a Potion to work it out, as well as to preserve from it.

14. Gospel grace is good, really good, always good and glorious at all times,
it is good in health, the Soul cannot have health without it; good in Sickness,
it is good in Prosperity, it is good in Adversity, it is good in good times, and
woe to them that want it in bad times, we are blessed that have it, but they are
cursed that are without it, whatsoever Profession they make. For the Profession
of the gospel without the grace of the gospel will do a man no good; it is but
the name without the nature; the Cabinet without the Jewel; the Lamp without
the Oil.

15. The grace of the gospel makes men like to Christ, to love Christ, and to
die for Christ.

16. Gospel grace makes men to live to God; they live to themselves that have
it not; they live to God that have it. It makes men wise, to be men of
Understanding, to live sober to themselves to live righteously to men, and to
live holy toward God, to live in Subjection to God, to obey God, to delight in
God, and to live in Obedience and Subjection to his Church.

The Gospel glorious in respect of the tenders and offers made therein.
6. The gospel is glorious in respect of the tenders and offers made therein to
the Sons of Men.

What is tendered? Quest.


Repentance is tendered, Pardon is tendered, Peace is tendered, Bread and
Water of Life is tendered, perfect Righteousness is tendered, Adoption is
tendered, Answ.
Glorious Liberty is tendered, in short God is offered, he makes a tender of
himself. Christ is tendered with all his Benefits who is the Pearl of great
price, worth Millions; yea more than ten thousand worlds, a Marriage with
Christ is tendered, the Spirit is tendered with all the blessings of it, a
Kingdom is offered in the gospel, a Crown is offered, a Crown of endless glory,
a Crown that fades not away, Eternal Life is tendered.

Who is it that makes these tenders and offers in the gospel? Quest.


The great God, he that has them to bestow, and a right to give them. Answ.


Who are they offered to? Quest.


To such that are his Enemies, Rebels, even the worst of Sinners, in a word,
Answ.
who ever will, Rev. 22.17.
he that has a will to receive them may have them.

Upon what Terms are they offered? Quest.


Freely offered without Money and without price though a man as to Righteousness
has nothing of worth nor Beauty in him, Answ.
being in himself but a Lump of Sin and Filthiness, Isa. 55.1, 2, 3.
yet he may have these things, they are offered unto such.

They are sincerely and faithfully offered, God does not mock men and women,
offer them such things as these, and yet never intend to bestow them upon them,
if they have a heart a Mind to them, my Life for theirs they may enjoy all
these and many more like glorious good things. Nay and more then this they have
been often tendered with much Affection and in Bowels of Compassion, God
bewails, and Christ bewails the state of such who do refuse them, O then what
Fools are mortals to slight and reject these tenders.

Gospel Reconciliation, glorious Reconciliation.
7. The gospel is glorious in Respect of the glorious things that are brought
about and accomplished thereby.

The first I shall mention is Reconciliation which is a glorious blessing, what
is more fully opened and held forth in the gospel than Reconciliation with the
means and manner how, and by whom accomplished? which will appear 1. By
Considering the parties Reconciled. 2. By Considering the Nature of the breach
that was between them. 3. By Considering the means and manner how it is
accomplished. 4. By Considering the Fruits and Effects of it.


1. Considering the Parties that were at Variance, who by the gospel are
Reconciled. God and Man, the infinite God, the holy God and Man, these were at
Enmity, it is sad when a difference rises in a Family, in a Congregation, in a
City, in a Kingdom, or between one Kingdom and another: but much more sad is it
to have God and sinners at Enmity, Adam runs from God, hides himself, he knew
God was now become his Enemy, the word declares the Creature to be Gods Enemy,
whilst he stands in old Adam in the state of nature, and you that were
sometimes alienated and enemies in your minds; etc. And then God declares
himself to be the Sinners enemy, Col. 1.21.
he is angry with the wicked every day; he is said to fight and war against
them which plainly shows he is their Enemy. But now what a glorious blessing is
this to have these two Parties reconciled, when we were enemies we were
reconciled to God by the death of his Son. Romans 5.10.
You that were enemies in your minds by wicked works (or as in the Margent,
Col. 1.21 22.
by your minds in wicked works) yet now has he reconciled in the body of his
flesh through Death.

Gospel Reconciliation glorious as to the nature of the branch.
Secondly, Gospel reconciliation appears to be glorious reconciliation if we
consider the nature of the breach that was between them.

1. It was an old breach, no sooner was man made but straitway he became an
Enemy to God; nay, every Soul that comes into the world, comes into it an enemy
of God, or in a state of enmity.

2. It Is so great a breach that all the Angels in heaven, nor all the Saints on
earth could not make up.

3. It was such a breach that lays the Soul obnoxious to Gods fearful Curse.

4. It is such a breach that makes the Creatures of God at enmity one with
another, and Mankind in danger of being Devoured by them; and also has set man
one against another.

5. It is such a breach that sets man against himself, it has caused his own
Conscience to be his Enemy, and to accuse, and fight against him and condemn
him; 1 John 3.21.
If our Hearts condemn us, God is greater etc.

6. It is such a breach, that unless made up will produce an eternal Separation
from God, Mat. 25.41.
depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devils and his
Angels, etc.

Gospel Reconciliation glorious in respect of the means and manner how it is
accomplished.
Thirdly, It Is glorious Reconciliation if we consider the means and manner how
and by whom it is wrought about and accomplished, every Person in the glorious
Trinity has a hand in it and are eminently concerned about it. God was in
Christ reconciling the world to himself. 2 Cor. 5.18.
All things are of God who has reconciled us unto himself by Jesus Christ,
etc. The Lord Jesus the second Person is employed, (we may see from hence,) as
one fitly qualified to make up this dreadful Breach: and in order thereunto he
took our Nature on him. There was a necessity of Christ's coming to reconcile
God and man: God, his Law and Justice was wronged, and God was resolved to have
this wrong made up and his Justice satisfied, which none but Christ could do,
God was willing to be reconciled, yet nevertheless he will (wherein he was
wronged) be righted, and have his Justice fully and completely satisfied.
Christ knew what would appease and satisfy both Law and Justice, what he has
done has infinite worth and efficacy in it, this way tends most to glorify
God the Father, the Son is glorified most this way, the Spirit is glorified
most this way, and there was no way like this to melt the Sinners heart, to
abase him and lay him at the feet of God. -- See Christ the Mediator, etc.

2. Christ does not only reconcile God to the Creature, but also reconciles the
Creature unto God; he undertakes to bring God near to Man, and Man near to God,
whose heart is full of Sin and Enmity to his Maker, and not subject to his Law,
he lays his hands upon both, the first is done by his death, Christ like Jonas
is cast into the Sea (as it were) of wrath, to make a Calm. The second is done
by the Spirit, he breaks the heart, changes the inward qualities and evil
dispositions, he takes away the heart of stone, and gives a heart of flesh.

Gospel reconciliation is in respect of the nature of it.
Fourthly, Gospel Reconciliation is glorious in respect to the nature of it.

1. It is a free Reconciliation it is a work of free grace alone: it is not of
man, not of him that wills, or him that runs; but of God that showed
mercy. Romans 9.16
Hence the Apostle says, All things are of God; speaking of Reconciliation.

2. It is mysterious Reconciliation, we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world begun to our glory,
the Spirit searches all things, yea the deep things of God; This is one of
those deep things, 2 Cor. 2.7.
which many because they cannot comprehend it in their own natural Wisdom,
cavil against it.

3. It is a certain reconciliation, God is at Peace and fully Reconciled in
Jesus Christ Christ shall not, will not loss his glorious design in coming into
the world, and taking our nature on him, and dying the cursed death of the
Cross. Those therefore that are brought to accept of the terms of Peace and
Reconciliation as offered in the Gospel, stand in a state of Real Peace and
Friendship, neither let any once imagine that after all these glorious
transactions of the blessed Trinity about this work that the issue of the whole
in order to the making of it effectual, depends upon the Will and power of man.

4. The Soul is taken into perfect Love and Union with God, God hereby entirely
loves us, and is so for us, or on our side, that his Friends and Allies become
our Friends and Allies, and all our Enemies become his Enemies, so that what is
done to us, he takes as done to himself.

5. It is an honorable Reconciliation, it is a Reconciliation upon honorable
Terms, God suffers not in any of his glorious Attributes: If God had passed
by our offenses so that we had Pardon and Reconciliation without more ado,
without a compensation for sin, Mr. Borroughs.
the Devils perhaps (says a Divine) might have cried out against him, and have
said, where is the Glory of thy justice, these have sinned against thee, as
well as we, and the breach they have made upon thy justice is no ways made up:
but now their mouths are stopped for ever. This Reconciliation will be to the
glory of God in the sight of Angels and Men to Eternity, and it is that which
God Rejoices in as being exceedingly pleased with it, seeing his honor is made
up in this Reconciliation.

6. It is an abiding, firm, and everlasting Reconciliation there is nothing can
make a breach between God and his People any more; the Union cannot, shall not
be broke, it is beyond the power of Devils, Men, Sufferings, nay or Sin either
to do it, Romans 8.39
Who shall be able to separate us from the Love of God which is in Christ Jesus
our Lord.

Gospel reconciliation glorious in respect of the effects of it. Ephesians. 2.14, 15,
16, 17 Romans 5.1.
Fifthly, Gospel Reconciliation is glorious in respect of the Fruits, Effects,
and Consequences of it.

1. In that all that Enmity that was between God and the Soul comes hereby to
be removed and man consequently to have peace with God. For he is our peace who
has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of Partition between
us, having abolished in his Flesh, etc. and that he might Reconcile both unto
God in one body by the Cross, having slain the Enmity thereby, and came and
preached peace. Being justified by faith we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ.

2. Peace of Conscience is another fruit and effect of this Reconciliation.

3. There is also as the effects of this Reconciliation, Peace and sweet
Harmony in the Soul between all the Faculties; they do not fight as formerly
one against another, the Conscience drawing one way and the will another, the
Will opposing that which Conscience would have done, the Judgment may be
convinced in some measure as Balaams was, who cried out that Gods ways were
best, how Goodly are thy tents O Jacob, and thy tabernacles O Israel, Number. 24.5
and yet the Affections may be for sin, and love the wages of unrighteousness.

4. The next thing that I might mention is joy in the holy Ghost, when once a
Soul knows he is reconciled to God then he comes not only to have Peace, but
also to be filled with joy in beleiving, the Kingdom of God is not meat and
drink, but Righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.

5. Free access to God is another fruit and effect of Gospel reconciliation,
such may go with boldness to the Throne of Grace, through him we both (i. e.
Jews and Gentiles who believe) have access by the spirit to the Father. Ephesians.
2.18.


6. Hence there is a free and blessed Trade open between heaven and earth,
between God and the Soul, as in Countries that are in war one with another,
there can be no Trade nor Traffic between them, but when Peace is made, and a
sure League concluded betwixt them, Trade is open again, so is it between God
and the Soul when Reconciled.

7. By this means we come in a special manner to be under the Care and
Protection of God, there shall not one hair fall to the ground without the
Leave and Permission of God, he has hereby Interested himself in all our
concerns, and many other blessed effects attend our Reconciliation with God,
which are elsewhere insisted upon. Gospel glorious in respect of the pardon of
sin.
See Mediator.

Eighthly, The gospel is glorious in respect of remission or Pardon of sin,
gospel remission is glorious Remission.

1. By Considering who it is that is Pardoned, or who they are that God
forgives?

1. Rebels, such that had broke an holy and just Law.

2. Rebels to God, such that had conspired against him, joined and sided with
Satan against the Majesty of Heaven.

3. Such that were greatly in Debt, owed ten thousand Talents, and nothing to
pay. See Metaphor Poor.

4. Such that were liable to eternal Wrath.

II. By considering the Causes, and chief ground or way of Pardon, Christ's
blood must be shed to procure it; without shedding of blood there is no
remission of sin. Heb. 9.22.


III. By considering the Nature and Effect of Pardon.

1. All sins that ever the poor sinner committed are promised to be forgiven.
2. For ever forgiven. 3. The Pardoned Person is not only forgiven, but
Justified also. 4. None can condemn such. 5. They have Peace with God, through
our Lord Jesus Christ.
IV. And Lastly, Gospel Remission Is glorious in respect of God that gives
forth the Pardon. I am he that blotteth out thine Iniquity, Isa. 43.2^^
this antidotes the Soul against the Venom of Satan's Temptations.

1. He Pardons the sinner that has Power to do it; who but God can forgive Sin?

2. Who can accuse the Soul? I will, says Satan; thou art a sinner: What
then, says the Soul, see what I have here, behold a Pardon from the King
himself.

3. None can Revoke this Pardon or make it ineffectual.

4. God himself never repents the giving them to any poor Believer; as others
cannot, so he will never revoke free gospel pardon and remission himself.

The Gospel Glorious in respect of Peace as it is the effect of Grace and
Remission.
Ninthly, The gospel is glorious in respect of Peace, the fruit and effect of
grace. Not Peace with God, for that we have already spoken off, but Peace of
Conscience* Great peace have they that love thy law, etc. My peace I leave with
you, Joh. 14.27.
my peace I give unto you, let not your hearts be troubled, let the peace of
God rule in your hearts, etc.

Tenthly, The gospel is glorious in respect of the Ordinances and Institutions
of it, The Gospel glorious in respect of ordinances.
which we shall insist upon, under its proper head; Particularly that of
Baptism and the Lords Supper, which will be made appear to be glorious
Ordinances.

Gospel glorious in respect of the promises.
Eleventhly, The gospel is glorious in respect of the Promises thereof.

The Promises of God in the gospel given through Christ are great, glorious,
and exceeding precious. The Promises may be compared to the Land of Promise,
they flow with Milk and Honey, they are like a Rich Mine, abounding with
precious Treasure, the further you dig, the more precious gold you will find.
Or they may be compared to a lovely and choice Garden that abounds with all
sorts of rare and excellent Flowers, but it is a garden always green and
flourishing, flowers that knows no drought nor winter, that never decays; not
only for Pleasure, but for Profit. A gospel Promise is something that God has
engaged to give to Christ, or unto us through Christ, or for his sake.

And they consist either in his free bestowing of good, or his gracious
removing of Evil. In his bestowing of good here, or good hereafter; or in
removing of evil here, or evil hereafter. And they either are Absolute or
Conditional.

Gospel Promises are glorious Promises, called precious Promises; and better
promises than those of the Law or first Testament.

1. This appears if we consider who it is that makes and gives these Promises
forth, Romans 1.2.
viz. the great God, Men think they have enough when they have the Promise and
Word of a King (touching this or that) to rely upon, but what is the Promise
or Word of an Earthly King, to the Promises of the King of Heaven and Earth,
they oft-times fail in their Promises; but this King never did.

2. Glorious, if we consider the time when given, and that was before the
Foundation of the World. In hopes of Eternal Life, Tit. 1.2, 3*
which God that cannot lie promised before the world began.

3. Glorious Promises, if we consider the Vileness, Unworthiness, and
Nothingness of them (as they are in themselves) to whom the Promises are made.

4. Gospel Promises are glorious Promises, considering through whom and by what
means they are given; Christ procures the Promise as well as Remission, by
pouring forth his precious blood he paid dear for them, that the Slave might be
adopted and saved, the Son is sacrificed.

5. They are free Promises; not made for any merit or worthyness in us, but
purely proceed from the free Grace and Favor of God: Tit. 3.5.
and therefore Glorious. God does not sell himself, his Son, and precious
Promises to Sinners, but they are given freely, without money, and without
price; not for thy Beauty, Righteousness, Excellency, etc. he that has
promised to love us freely, pardons us freely. Thou have bought me no sweet
cane with money, neither have thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices;
but thou have made me to serve with thy sins, thou have wearied we with thine
iniquities. Isa: 43.24, 25.
I, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgression for mine own sake, and
will not Remember thy sins.

Salvation is freely promised, not by works of Righteousness that we have done,
but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of Regeneration and
renewing of the holy Ghost. Tit. 3.5.


6. Gospel Promises are glorious, if we consider the extent of them, they Run
not only to the lineal seed of Abraham, but to all Believers, to Jew and
Gentile, bond and free, none are excluded: whoever will, let him take of the
water of life freely.

7. Gospel Promises are glorious Promises in respect of what is given.

Hos. 2.16.19. Isa. 62.5.
1. Christ is given, God has given his Son, not only for the sinner, but to the
sinner. Christ promises to give himself, offers to betroth himself to us for
ever. The Spirit is promised with all the blessing, grace, gifts and operations
thereof.

2. God promises in the gospel to give himself, I will be your God, and you
shall be my People. This Promise is the highest the fullest and sweetest of all
promises, Austin speaking of it, breaks forth in Admiration, What is better
than this goodness! what is or can be greater happiness than this! can God give
any thing greater than himself?

3. Whatsoever he is, has, or can do in a gracious way is promised to be given
in this one promise. He is one Eternal, All-sufficient, Immutable, Infinite,
Glorious, Incomprehensible, Omniscient, Omnipresent, Holy and Gracious God. His
Goodness, Truth, Power, Wisdom, Mercy, Loving Kindness, Faithfulness is
engaged for Believers.

4. O what is in man that thou art mindful of him! is all below thy self too
little and not good enough for man, that thou give thy self to fill and
satisfy him? All that God is or has so far as communicative is promised, etc.
Life, Light, Grace, Strength, Wealth, Riches, Pleasure, Honor is the
Believers.

5. Whatsoever he can do so far as comports with his own glory and our good is
pomised ( viz.) to feed, support, suppress fears, prevent danger, keep in or
deliver out of trouble, etc.

6. The greatness of this Promise will appear by Considering what all other
things are in comparison of God, if heaven be nothing, what is earth in
comparison of him, all other things come from him as water from a Fountain;
what are all things without him whether Spiritual or Temporal, consider the
necessity of him, men make a shift to live without enjoying God (though such are
dead whilst they live) but know not how to die without him, nothing but God is
a suitable good for the Soul. It Is not Clothes that can Cloth it, it is not
Silver, Gold nor Pearl which can adorn it, it is not fire that can warm it, nor
bread can feed it, nor wine can cheer it, nor money can satisfy it, nor
earthly Friends can comfort it, it is God only that can supply all the wants
and necessities of the Soul.

7. This is a great promise because nothing is yours till God is yours, by
Union with him the Soul is interested into all spiritual and temporal good
things.

8. It Is a part and portion which can never be spent, you may live upon God,
there is enough in him for Millions, Ps. 73.45.
and Millions of Millions; -- See God a Portion. God is better than heaven,
better than grace, better than glory, better than things present, or things to
come, the promises are like a rich Ring of Gold, but this is the rare Diamond
in that Ring, it is the Crown, the Top, Excellency of all promises; his Wisdom
is the Souls for Direction, his Power for Protection, his Grace for its
Acceptance, his Spirit for its Consolation, his Creatures on earth to serve
us, his Angels to Guard us, his Ordinances to Feed and Strengthen us, his Grace
to Adorn us, his Riches to Advance and Crown us to Eternity.

This is a great Promise, the greatest Promise; God gives Light when he gives
himself, he gives Life when he gives himself. God is Light without Obscurity,
how sweet is that Light! he is Life without Mortality, how sweet is that Life!
Peace without perplexity, Love without Mutability, how sweet is such Love! God
fills and satisfies all that enjoy him, beyond God the heart can desire nothing.

8. Promises of the Gospel are glorious and precious Promises, if we consider
the seasonableness and suitableness of them.

Rest is Promised to the Weary Soul. Food to the Hungry Soul. Clothes to the
Naked Soul. Pardon to the Guilty Soul. Liberty to the Captive Soul. Strength to
the Weak Soul. Health and healing to the Sick and Wounded Soul. Courage to the
Faint-hearted Soul. Riches to the Poor and Needy Soul. Light to the Blind Soul.
Life to the Condemned Soul.
Were a man cast for Life and condemned to die a painful and horrible Death,
suppose it were to be burnt or roasted alive, and a pardon should be proffered
to him in the very nick of time, how sweet and precious would that be to him,
even so seasonable and sweet are the Promises of the Gospel to poor condemned
sinners, God gives them into the Soul when it sees it is just dropping into Hell
to be burned for ever in eternal Flames.

9. Promises of the Gospel are glorious in respect of the firmness and
stability of them. Gospel Promises are firm and sure Promises.

1. Made or given forth by one who cannot lie nor deny himself. Tit. 1.1. 2 Timothy 2.13. 2 Cor. 1.
In hope of Eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world
began.

2. They are not yea and nay, not uncertain, doubtful, mutable, and variable,
but yea and Amen in Christ Jesus. God ever kept his Promise with his People.

1. He Promised Noah he would not drown the World any more, and how graciously
has he kept that Promise and continued the token of it in the Cloud unto this
day.

2. God promised Abraham a Son, and will work Miracles rather than not make
that promise good.

3. God Promised to give the Land of Canaan and rest therein to his seed, how
punctual was he in performing of it, as Solomon well observes, 1 Kin. 8.56.
Blessed be the Lord that has given rest to his people Israel according to all
that he promised there has not failed one word of all his good promise, etc.
it was declared to Abraham that his seed should be strangers in the Land of
Egypt four hundred years, and Moses shows that at the end thereof, nay the very
self-same day, the Lord brought them out of the said Land: Exodus 12.41.

4. God promised to send a Savior, and accordingly when the fullness of time
was come, he sent him into the World.

5. And that Gospel Promises might be firm and sure to all the faithful and
Covenant People of God, they are put into Christ's hand, who having shed his
Blood to procure the good Promised, has Received the Promises for us as our
Trustee; Acts 2.33. Therefore being by the Right hand of God Exalted, and
having received the Promise of the holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which
ye now see and hear.

6. That the Promises might be made sure to all the seed, Christ has brought
himself under an Obligation to make them good. Luke 24.29.
And the Lord Jesus is not only engaged, but the Father also.

1. In respect of his Goodness and Mercy, Heb. 10.23. 1 John 1.9.

2. In respect of his Faithfulness and Truth: 1 Cor. 10.13.

3. Nothing can hinder or obstruct God in accomplishing whatsoever he has
promised.

4. They must be made good because of the nature of the Covenant, 2 Samuel 23.5.
Heb. 9.15, 16, 17.
it is ordered in all things, and sure. It Is unto God as the waters of Noah,
Isa. 54.10. They are left in Christ's last Will and Testament, that was
confirmed by his blood. See Testator.

And for this cause he is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of
death for the Redemption of the Transgressions that were under the first
testament, they which are called, might Receive the promise of eternal
inheritance.

5. But if all this is not enough, God has engaged himself by oath to make
them good, he has (if I may so speak) pawned his own Being, Life, Power, Truth
and Holiness upon the performing whatsoever he has promised to his own
Vovenant People, for when God made a Promise to Abraham, because he could swear
by no greater, he swore by himself; Genesis 22.16, 17. Saying, surely in blessing
I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thee. And so after he had
patiently endured, he obtained the promise; for men verily swear by the
greater, and an oath of confirmation is to them an end of all strife. Heb.
6.13, 14, 15, 16 17, 18.
Wherein God more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability
of his counsel confirmed by an Oath, ver. 17. That by two immutable things in
which it was impossible for God to lie we might have strong consolation who
have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. May not this
cause a Believer to venture upon a Promise of God, and to rest satisfied until
it is accomplished.

10. Gospel Promises are glorious promises, because they are generally and more
especially Soul or spiritual promises. What is it to have a promise of such or
such an Estate or Lordship, or to be blessed in the Basket and store, or with
all earthly good things, these are the blessings, it is granted, that worldly
men seek after; I have goods, Luke 12.19.
says the Rich Glutton, laid up for many years; (blind wretch!) but how poor
and miserable was his Soul! Now gospel promises are of a spiritual, heavenly,
and sublime Nature, as you have heard before; soul-food, soul-strength,
soul-health, soul-riches, soul-peace, soul-liberty, soul-life; a Christ, a
Kingdom, and Crown that fades not away, for the Soul. This is the Tenth:

11. Gospel promises are glorious promises, because it is by virtue of these
thou come to take hold of, and obtainest an interest in the Lord Jesus
Christ. Is not that a precious promise that will make thee sure of a Savior, a
bare Promise for (of his) Interest, is security enough, though he has
condescended in a gracious manner to us not only to make over himself and
eternal Life to our Souls by Promise; but has given us an earnest also into
our hearts; nay, more then that, Sealed us also by his Spirit unto the day of
redemption. Ephesians. 1.13. and 4.30.
See earnest, and Seal, under the head of Metaphors respecting the Spirit.

The Promises are the ground of Faith and Hope, that Faith is a Fancy, and that
hope will be but as a spiders Web that is not grounded upon the Promise of God.

12. Gospel Promises are glorious in a comparative sense above the Promises of
the Law.

1. Better in respect of perspicuity or clearness of them, those were Promises
under obscure Types and shadows; Justification was held forth by several
Sacrifices: burnt-offerings and sin offerings, etc. Sanctification held forth
under several Ceremonial washings.

Deuteronomy. 28.34.
2. Better in regard of the Nature or Quality of them; the former were generally
promises of Temporal or Earthly things.

3. In respect of the Efficacy and Power that is in these, over what was in the
other. The Law made nothing perfect; Heb. 7.19
many blessings were made indeed in case of Obedience, but the Law gave no
power to perform the Condition or help the Soul in that Obedience.

4. They are better in regard of extent and Duration.

13. Gospel Promises are glorious in respect of the variety of them; there is
variety of all good things promised therein, answering to every condition the
Creature may be under. They tend in a sweet manner to remove all objections,
doubts and discouragements of the Soul whatsoever, as you may perceive by
taking a brief Taste.

I am a vile sinner, says the Soul, mine Iniquity is gone over mine head as a
heavy burden; Obj.
they are more then can be numbered, and are ever before me, I have sinned
against Light and Knowledge and hated Instruction. Is there any Hope or Promise
for such a wretch, such a Rebel and Monster of wickedness as I am.

Answ.
See the promise, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity, and ye
scorners delight in their scorning, Prove. 1.22. Isa. 55.1, 8.
and fools hate knowledge; turn at my reproof. Behold I will pour out my spirit
upon you, I will make known my words unto you. Let the wicked forsake his way,
and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord and he
will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon. Come
unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Mat.
11.28.


Here are promises that may be grounds of encouragement to the vilest sinner.
Were there no Promises but to righteous Persons, or to men and women, so and so
qualified, it were sad. But through Christ, and in closing with him in the
Gospel, there is pardon offered to sinners as sinners, though they have been very
vile and notorious in wickedness.

But alas, says the Soul, I have made God mine Enemy, his Curse and Judgments
are denounced against me; Obj.
I may say with Job, God pursues me, Job 6 4. And hell is ready to receive me,
whilst I suffer his terrors, I am distracted, Psalm. 88.15.

Answ.
The storm of Gods wrath is over in Christ, where God remits the sin, he remits
the Punishment. Go proclaim these words toward the North, and say, return,
Jer. 3.12.
and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you, for I am merciful says the
Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever. He retains not his Anger for ever,
because be delights in Mercy.

Obj.
But alas, I am Ignorant of God and of Christ, and know not God, and he will
come in flaming fire to take vengeance on such, 2 These. 1.7.8. VVo is me.

Answ.
God has promised to teach thee the knowledge of himself, and to guide thee in
the way thou should go. Good and upright is the Lord, Ps. 25.8.
therefore will he teach sinners in the way. Nay, and though thou art blind, see
what a gracious promise he makes, Isa 42.16. I will bring the blind by a way
that they know not, I will lead them in paths they have not known. I will make
darkness light before them, and crooked things strait, these things will I do
unto them, and not forsake them.

Obj.
But my heart is dead and obdurate, you know not the naughtiness of it; O I am a
filthy Creature, I cannot mourn nor melt under the word of God.

Answ.
And they shall loath themselves for the evils they have done; and not only for
what they have done, but also for the baseness of their vile stubborn
Rebellious and whorish heart, as is minded by the same Prophet, and see what a
Promise God is pleased to make to those polluted and hard-hearted ones. A new
heart also will I give you, Ezekiel. 20.43. and 36.26.
and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart
out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh. God has promised to pour
out the Spirit of Grace, and that he will melt thee under the sense of thy Sin,
and cause thee to mourn in a right manner for thy sin, God will not only break
thy stony heart, but will also take it away. O blessed Promise, he will take it
away because it is good for naught, it is not fit to be wrought upon, it is not
soft or pliable, there is no mending of it, it must be new made, new cast, like
a cracked bell, before Gods Image can be formed in it or engraven upon it, etc.

Obj.
Ay, but I have been so vile and wicked, that I know not what evil things I
could do more against God, than what I have done.

Answ.
So it is said of Juda and Israel, Jer. 3.5. Behold thou have spoken, and done
evil things as thou could; yet mind the promise of God to them. Return, --
and I will not cause my anger to fall upon you, I am merciful says the Lord,
only acknowledge thine Iniquity, etc. ver. 12, 13.

Obj.
But I cannot think there is Mercy and Pardon for me; it cannot enter into my
thoughts.

Let the wicked forsake his way, and the ungodly man his thoughts, and turn to
the Lord, Isa. 55.7, 8, 9.
and he will have mercy upon him, Answ.
and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon: for my thoughts are not your
thoughts, says the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are
my thoughts higher than your thoughts, etc.

Obj.
But says another soul, I have backslidden from God, there is therefore no
comfort and Salvation for me.

Answ.
I will heal thy backslidings, and love thee freely, Jer. 3.12, 14. Hos. 14.4.

Obj.
But this and the other sin and corruption will be too hard for me; I shall one
day fall by the hand of Saul, says David; so may I say in respect of one base
sin that way^^ lays me, and does always beset me.

Answ.
Soul, thou shall not finally be overcome, though thou fall thou shall rise
again, what says God to thee, I will subdue your Iniquities. Mal. 7.18, 19.
sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law: but under
grace. Romans 6.14. Psalm. 67.3.

Obj.
But Satan will be too many and mighty for me, he will break my bones, and
devour me at one time or other.

Answ.
But what says God, the Promise runs, he shall but bruise thy heel, not break
thy head: he has also promised to bruise Satan under thy feet shortly, Romans
16.20. My Grace is sufficient for thee. 2 Cor. 12.9.

But I have no power to stand, I shall fall when Persecution comes, I shall not
be able to go through fiery Trials. Obj.


Answ.
I will give thee power, says the Lord, He gives power to the faint, and to
them that have no might. Fear not worm Jacob and ye men of Israel, I will help
thee, I will uphold thee, etc. when thou go through the fire I will be with
thee, etc.

Obj.
If I follow God and his ways, my Friends will leave me, nay my Father and
Mother will forsake me, and how shall that loss be made up

Answ.
When my Father and Mother forsakes me, says David, the Lord will take me up;
Ps. 27.10. Heb 13.
I will never leave thee, says God, nor forsake thee.

But what shall I do for a Father?

Obj.
I will be a father unto you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, says the
Lord Almighty; Answ.
Jer. 3.19. 2 Cor. 6.18.

Obj.
But I am weak, and not able to speak when I am brought before Rulers for
Christ's sake.

Answ.
Take no care, it shall be given to you the same hour.

But notwithstanding all this, I am afraid, I shall deny the Faith, and depart
for ever from God. Obj.


Answ.
I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me. -- my
sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give them
eternal Life, Jer. 32.39 John 10.27, 28.
and they shall never perish neither shall any pluck them out of my hands.

Obj.
But strange evils have befallen me.

Answ.
All things shall work together for good.

Obj.
I am afraid I shall want bread.

Answ.
The young lions want and suffer hunger, but they that fear the Lord shall not
lack any good thing -- He will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he
withold from them that walk uprightly.

Obj.
But those that live Godly are in danger to be undone, to follow Christ is the
way to loose all, say what you will.

Answ.
Godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that
now is, and of that which is to come. It Is the only way to grow Rich, those
that loose any thing for Christ's sake, shall have a hundrd fold in this Life,
and in the World to come Life Everlasting.

Obj.
But I may lose my life if I keep faithful to the Lord Jesus.

He that loses his life for my sake, shall find it; Such shall have an heavenly
Life for an earthly one. Answ.
An Eternal Life for a Transitory one; and thus by the help of the Spirit, the
Promises sweetly tend to answer all doubts and objections that may arise in
poor sinners, or in the hearts of weak Believers, which is the last thing I
shall mind, as to the glorious excellent nature of Gospel Promises.

Gospel glorious in respect of privileges.
12. The Gospel is glorious in respect of the Privileges thereof; here I might
insist upon Adoption or Sonship, free access to the Throne of Grace, a
dewlling place in Gods house, right to the Ministry, and all the gifts
thereof, whether Paul or Apollos, all is yours, and right to partake of the
Prayers of the Church, and many other privileges that have occasionally been
mentioned, which here I shall omit.

Gospel salvation glorious salvation.
13. The Gospel is glorious in respect of the Salvation wrought about by the
Lord Jesus, as recorded and revealed therein. That Gospel Salvation is glorious
Salvation does appear from what has been said.

1. In respect of God, who in his eternal Wisdom, first found it out, or was
the contriver of it.

Heb. 5.9.
2. In respect of Christ who is more immediately the Author thereof.

3. In respect of the price of this Salvation, ( viz.) the Blood of Jesus
Christ.

4. In that all the glorious Attributes shine forth in their own glorious
splendour and luster therein. They all meet together in sweet harmony:
righteousness, and truth meet together, Justice and Mercy do (as it were) Kiss
each other, as has already been hinted; the gospel shows that God in
magnifying one Attribute, does not eclipse the glory of another.

5. In respect of the Publishers of it.

1. The Angels. 2. The Lord Jesus himself. 3. The Apostles.
6. In respect of all other Salvations, what was that glorious Salvation God
wrought for Israel at the Red Sea, in comparison of the Salvation of the Gospel
by the Lord Jesus? Many conclude that Salvation of Israel, and other great
Salvations spoken of in the old Testament, were as Types and Shadows of this.

7. In respect of the Confirmation of it by signs and wonders and diverse
miracles and gifts of the holy Ghost, the Dead were raised, the Blind saw, Heb.
2.3, 4
the Temple rent asunder, the Sun darkened, the Graves opened, the Spirit
miraculously given down, and all to confirm the Salvation of the Gospel.

8. Gospel Salvation is glorious Salvation in respect of the workings and
operations of the holy Spirit upon the heart, in order to the interesting of
the Soul into the grace and blessings thereof, as has been showed already --.
The holy Trinity are Employed and concerned in working about, and finally
accomplishing of this Salvation.

9. In respect of the seasonableness of it; every thing therein being
gloriously fitted and suited as to time and the necessity of poor sinners; in
due time Christ died for the ungodly. See Promises.

10. Upon consideration of what we are hereby delivered from, ( viz.) Sin,
Satan, the Law, Wrath of God, Death, and everlasting Burning.

11. In respect of all those things and blessings we are hereby invested with,
and hope to receive.

12. Gospel Salvation is glorious, because it is a free Salvation; not by works
of righteousness that we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us,
Tit. 3.5.

13. Because it is a full Salvation, it supplies the Soul with all things it
wants whether Grace, Light, Power, Wisdom, Peace, or any thing else in order to
interest in it, or the perfect accomplishment of it.

14. Because it is a sweet Soul-satisfying Salvation. Every one that sees his
interest in it, may say with good old Simeon, Now let thy servant depart in
peace, for mine eyes have seen thy Salvation.

15. It Is a certain and sure Salvation.

16. It is an Eternal Salvation. Israel shall be saved in the Lord, with an
Everlasting Salvation. And being made perfect he became the Author of Eternal
Salvation to all them who obey him, Heb. 5.9.

Inferences.
1. This may Inform and fully Convince all considerate Persons, what the reason
and cause is that the Devil is such an implacable Enemy to the Gospel, and uses
all means immaginable to prevent it or hinder the light thereof from shining
into our hearts. If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 2 Cor,
4.3.4.
in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not,
lest the light of the Glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God,
should shine unto them.

2. It also shows us what a great blessing God has bestowed upon this nation.

3. It may be a means to stir up all poor sinners to believe and obey it, to
prize and esteem it.

4. It may teach us to contend earnestly for it, and to hold it fast, in spite
of all opposers whatsoever.

5. What Motives might hence be inferred to prevail with all sincere Believers
to be earnest with God, that they may behold in this glass more of his glory,
to the end it may by its reflected Rays, change them into the same Image from
glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. That it may shine into their
Hearts.

(1.) As they would be as burning and shining Lights to others.

(2.) As they would live in the Joy and Comfort of it themselves.

(3.) As they would approve themselves Wisdoms Children, by justifying and
standing by, and for, this glorious Gospel held forth in the word of God, in
the worst times.

6. If the Gospel be so glorious it may put each man upon Examination, do
thou perceive and clearly behold the glory which shines forth in it? Some (it
is to be feared) never saw the gospel in the glory of it; it is as a sealed
Book to them; they see but the outsides of the book, they are not able to
discern the luster and glory which is contained in it; the God of this world
has blinded the minds (says the Apostle) of them that believe not, lest the
light of the glorious gospel of Christ, 2 Cor. 4.3.4.
who is the Image of God should shine unto them.

Some men commend the gospel only because it contains so many righteous and
good Laws, and holy Rules of Justice and Morality, teaching men to live
soberly, and to do as they would be done unto, but see but little more in it;
which shows these men have but little of the Mystery, and Glory of the Gospel
opened to them; for though it be granted, that it is one part of the excellency
of it, yet it is not the chief, as appears by what has been said.

Again, There are others who seemingly are much affected with the Gospel (that
Book of Books) and yet cry up, and magnify the Light within above it, as if
that was a more perfect Rule than the holy Gospel, and Word of God; which
shows how little of the Gospel glory appears to them.

In the last Place, if the Gospel be so glorious, O pray (whosoever thou art)
that God would be pleased to open thine eyes, that thou may see it so to be;
and cry mightily, that he would be pleased never to take it away from this poor
Nation, nor suffer its Glory and Brightness to be Eclipsed by letting in Popish
darkness again amongst us. If we once lose the Gospel, we may all cry Ichabod,
the glory is departed from England; and, with the Church of Old, say, the Crown
is fallen from our heads, woe to us that we have sinned.

Quest.
But some may say why does Satan endeavor to hide the Gospel?

Answ.
1. It is because he is such an implacable Enemy to Mankind, he cannot endure
the light himself, and he would not (such is his hatred to us) have the light
of the Gospel shine upon us.

2. Because of that Malice he bears to the Lord Jesus, he would fain keep men
ignorant of a Savior; Not only out of hatred to man, but also out of
implacable enmity to the Lord Christ, that so he may as much as ly's in him
hinder our Saviors chief design and intention in coming into the World; which
was to bring men out of Darkness into the Light.

3. Because he knows whilst he can keep men ignorant of the Gospel, he has
them fast enough, what Profession soever they make of Religion, though they hear,
read, pray, give Alms, nay, and in many things reform their lives; yet if they
see not the way of Salvation, as it is revealed in the Gospel, he matters it
not, they still remain his Captives.

4. Because, it is hereby, his Kingdom is like to fa^^; it is the light of the
Gospel that tends to the utter overthrow and ruin of the Kingdom of darkness.

What wonderful things has the Gospel done in the World, and what Power is
there in it, by the help of the Holy Spirit to dis-Throne Satan, and break all
his Chains to pieces; therefore he bestirs himself to hinder the breaking out
of Light and Knowledge in every Nation, and causes fierce opposition to be made
against those, who endeavor to sup-plant him, and lay open his grand designs.
This informs, us, how it comes about there is so much Ignorance and gross
Darkness in the World; not only in Popish Countries, but also where the Gospel
is Preached: Though Men hear it Preached every day, yet O how Blind and
Ignorant are many Sinners. Men rest satisfied with the bare notion of Things,
and Name of Christians, never minding Religion in good earnest, but in a most
fearful manner, are grown so foolhardy, and venturous, as to hazard and expose
their Souls unto eternal ruin. The Devil has blinded their minds, this also
shows us from whence it is, there are, and formerly have been, so many false,
and detestable Opinions, Errors, and cursed Heresies in the world. Alas, the
Devil this way, endeavors to obstruct and hinder the Gospel from being
received, he has indeed strove a long time wholly to overthrow the very
foundation of the Christian Religion, and to bring in another Gospel; he
strives to cheat Men of the true Savior, and in his stead to Preach another,
of whom the Scripture is wholly ignorant, how have many Impudently asserted the
Light in all men to be the true Christ, and Savior of the Word? He does not
only strive to take away his glorious Soveraignity, and set up another
Universal Head, who has power to make Laws, and repeat them in matters of
Religion at his pleasure, (as the Followers of the Beast affirm) But now of
late endeavors to take away the very Person of the Holy Jesus. Also to change
the Ordinances, or wholly to deny them, (has been, and is another of his
Stratagems) which witness to the true Christ, his Death, Burial and
Resurrection. And lastly, Satan has always endeavored also to bring into
contempt the Ministers of the Gospel, or else raise up Persecution upon them;
and all these things he does to hinder the Gospel from shining, or obstruct the
promulgation thereof.

The Kisses of Christ's Mouth.
Cant. 1.2. Let him kiss me with the Kisses of his Mouth, for thy Love is
better than Wine.


LEt him (that is, Christ) kiss me. By these Expressions (says Ainsworth, and
others) the Church desires to have Christ manifested in the Flesh. Ainsworth
Guild, Sibbs. Durham. Wil^^on, Glass^^us, Illyricus, in locum.
Others, by Kisses, understand most friendly, familiar, and sensible
Manifestations of Love, for they are so amongst Friends; as 'twas betwixt
Jonathan and David, and so it is between Husband and Wife. It is evident that
Kisses are mentioned on sundry Occasions, used for diverse Ends, and signifying
several Things.

1. We read of a Kiss of Salutation, 1 Samuel 20.41. 1 Thessalonians. 5.26. 2. A Kiss of
Valediction, Ruth 2.9. 3. A Kiss of Reconciliation, 2 Samuel 14.33. 4. A Kiss of
Subjection, Psalm. 2.12. 5. A Kiss of Approbation, Prove. 2.4. 6. A Kiss of
Adoration, 1 Kings 19.18. 7. A traiterous Kiss, Mat. 26.49. 8. A Kiss of
Affection, Genesis 45.15.
And since the Church desires, in the Plural Number, Kisses of Christ's Mouth,
it may refer,

1. To a Kiss of Reconciliation, or Manifestation of Peace, Unity, and
Friendship.

2. A Kiss of Affection, which is very sweet, to have Christ express or
manifest his gracious Love to her.

3. A Kiss of Approbation which is (says Mr. Guild) sweetest of all.

The Text is purely Allegorical, as the whole Song is acknowledged to be by all
Divines.

METAPHOR.
KIsses betoken Love and Good Will to the Party they are given to.

II. They betoken a hearty Conjunction, and cordial Union of two Parties.

III. They betoken such a Friendship, as allows a Liberty of Access and
Communication at all times.

IV. They leave such Impressions, as engage the Affections to a future
Remembrance of the Object.

V. They oblige the Giver to show further Favors, and Acts of Love and
Kindness, to the Party he bestows them on.

VI. They are a Confirmation of the endeared Love and Reality we profess.

VII. They are the Privilege and Right (in a more peculiar manner) of
Covenant-Relations, as Husband and Wife, etc.

VIII. In Reconciliation, (after a seeming Breach between dear Relations) they
are highly prized and longed for by the Party offending.

IX. A Kiss is looked upon as a very high Honor, when received by an inferior
Person from a great King or Prince, and begets in others a longing after the
like Manifestation of Sovereign Grace and Favor.

X. They are very sweet and comfortable to very dear Friends, after long
absence.

XI. They are the first Ceremony or Initiation of kind and comfortable
Entertainment; as in the case of the profuse and extravagant Prodigal. (...)
1^^.20


XII. To be admitted to kiss the hand of a Prince, is a great Honor, because
of his Royalty and Grandeur; but to kiss his Mouth, is extraordinary, and only
allowed to great Favorites.

Parallel.
THe Spouse in the Text desires of the Lord Jesus, Tokens, or further
Manifestations of his Love and Good Will to her.

II. The Church desires further Tokens and Assurances of that blessed
Conjunction and Union, that is between her self and the Lord Jesus Christ.

III. Gracious Souls desire a more near Access unto Christ, and spiritual
Intimacy and Communion with him: O when will thou come unto me! It Is the Voice
of my Beloved that knocks. Cant 5.2. Isa. 26.9.
With my Soul have I desired thee in the Night.

IV. The Spouse desires such Favor, and Manifestations of Christ's Love and
Grace, that she may never forget his Love: We will remember his Love more than
Wine. Cant. 1.4.


V. The Spouse desires (as does every gracious Soul) that Christ would lay
himself under such Obligations of Love and Friendship to her, that he may never
forget her. The Death of Christ is the greatest Expression of his Affection to
his Elect. Let him seal up his Love to us by the Kisses of his Mouth, viz. by
his gracious Promises, and we are sure enough.

VI. The Spouse desires the greatest Confirmation of Christ's Love and gracious
Affection to her, to have clear Evidence of her Union with him, and eternal
Life.

VII. Manifestations of Christ's Love do belong properly to the Church, and
covenanted People of God. Hence the Spouse presumes to speak thus unto her
Beloved, Let him kiss me with the Kisses of his Mouth: I have the Liberty and
Privilege to request it of him.

VIII. Manifestations of Christ's Love are greatly prized by gracious Persons,
after there has been a seeming Strangeness or Breach in their Apprehension
between them, knowing they were wholly in the fault, and the only Cause of the
Breach.

IX. The Love Tokens, or Expressions of Christ's blessed Favor to the Spouse,
make the Daughters of Jerusalem to long after Christ's Love and Favor as well
as she: Whither is thy Beloved gone, Cant. 6.1.
O thou fairest among Women, that we may seek him with thee? This was after she
had declared, His Mouth is most sweet, Cant. 5.16
he is altogether lovely.

X. How sweet and exceeding comfortable are the Kisses of Christ's Mouth, or
Evidences of his Love, after a long time of spiritual Desertion.

XI. Manifestations of Christ's and the Father's Love, are glorious Tokens or
Acts of Acceptance of poor Sinners, who having been very vile and rebellious,
return home at last to their Father's House, and embrace a precious Savior.

XII. The Kisses of Christ's Mouth, (who is the only King and blessed Potentate
of Heaven and Earth) are an infinite Honor; can a poor Creature be more
eminently dignified?



Let him kiss me with the Kisses of his Mouth.
Ainsworth
BY Mouth, Annotators generally understand is meant his holy Word, or his own
lovely and gracious Doctrine; that is, Let me have expressions, or give
evidence of thy Love to me from thy Word: Kiss me with the Kisses of thy Mouth,
by a Metonymy of the Cause, viz. Cum causa organica, sive sermonis formandi
instrumentum, pro ipso sermon sive loquela ponitur: That is, when the
Organical Cause, or the Instrument that forms Speech, is put for the Speech it
self; as the Mouth is put for Testimony, Deuteronomy. 17.6. and 15.19. Mat. 18.16.
which is expounded, John 8.17. It is also written in your Law, that the
Testimony of two Men is true. The Mouth is also put for a Command or
Appointment, as Genesis 45.21. where the Mouth of Pharaoh (so it is in the Hebrew)
signifies the Command of Pharaoh: So the Mouth of the Lord is put for his
Command, Word, and Appointment, Exodus 17.1. Numb. 3.16, 39. and 20.24. and
27.14. Deuteronomy. 1.26, 43. and 34.5. Where the Hebrew (...) juxta Os Domini, at the
Mouth of the Lord, (with us translated Word) is by the Targum attributed to
Jonath. Vziel, rendered (...) ad osculum Verbi Domini, To the Kiss of the Word
of the Lord. Lying Lips do not become a Prince; that is, lying Words. Now the
Reason why the Church desires Kisses of Christ's Mouth, may be as follows.

METAPHOR.
KIsses of the Mouth are Expressions of high Favor, much more than to kiss the
Hand.

II. Kisses of the Mouth have Virtue in them; they tend to increase Love in the
Object, or beget more ardent Affection.

III. Kisses of the Mouth are plain and visible Evidences of cordial
Affections, and many times put a Person out of doubt about the Reality of the
Giver's Love.

IV. The Mouth is the Instrument or Medium to convey the inward Conceptions of
the Heart and Mind, (whether it respects Thoughts or Actions,) to the Knowledge
and Understanding of others.

Parallel.
CHrist in a high manner expresses his Favor and exceeding great Affection
unto his People in his Word: I lay down my Life for my Sheep. Joh. 10.15 Joh.
15.13
Greater Love than this has no Man.

II. Evidences of Christ's Love from his Word and gracious Promises are full of
Life and Virtue; they wonderfully draw out the Soul in Love and Longings after
Christ. How did that sweet Word (or Kiss) of Christ to Mary endear her to the
Lord Jesus; Woman, Luke 7.49, 50.
thy Sins are forgiven thee.

III. Evidences or Manifestations of Christ's Love to a believing Soul, are
clear Demonstrations of Christ's real Affection. When a Promise is set home,
and imprinted upon the Soul or Spirit of a doubting Christian, it causes all
his Fears to fly away: Psalm. 110.49.
Remember thy Word unto thy Servant, upon which thou have caused me to hope.

IV. The Word of Christ is the Way or glorious Medium he makes use of, to
convey or make known those gracious, Joh. 1.1. Mat. 11.27 Heb 11, 2. Joh. 10 10
Joh. 20.30
high, and eternal Conceptions of his Heart and Mind to his Elect; also hereby
he opens and explains to us the End of his Coming into the World, and his
Design in dying, and in all things he did, which otherwise would have been hard
to us to have found out.



METAPHOR.
OThers many times kiss them they do not love, out of Complement.

II. Others give sometimes a flattering and dissembling Kiss, like that of
Absalom's kissing the People, thinking thereby to steal away their Hearts from
David his Father.

III. Others salute Persons oftentimes with an unchaste and wanton Kiss.

IV. Others kiss when they design to murder. Thus Joab kissed Abner, and slew
him; Judas our Savior, and thereby betrayed him.

Disparity.
CHrist never vouchsafes any the Kisses of his Mouth, but to those that he
dearly loves.

II. Christ always, when he vouchsafes his gracious Favor to any Soul, does it
in all Simplicity and Integrity of Heart, in his Heart is no Guile or Deceit.

III. All Christ's Kisses are holy, chaste, heavenly, harmless and innocent.

IV. Christ's design is to save those whom he kisses: He came to seek and to
save that which was lost. I come that ye might have Life.



Inferences.
FRom hence we may perceive what a vast difference there is betwixt the Godly
and the Wicked: The one have their Hearts set upon heavenly Objects, the other
on carnal; the Desires of the one are holy, heavenly, and spiritual; the
Desires of the other are fleshly, earthly, and sensual.

II. If the Kisses of a Savior, or Evidences of his Love are so sweet,
methinks this should stir up all to desire Kisses of Christ's Mouth.

III. It may be some Souls are ready to enquire, How may I come to attain this
great Happiness and Honor, to be embraced in the Arms of the Lord Jesus?

1. Would thou have the Kisses of his Mouth? Thou must with Mary Magdalen,
fall down, and first kiss his Feet, and bedew them with the Tears of a broken
Heart; be humbled for thy Sin.

2. If thou would have him give thee a Kiss of Reconciliation and Affection,
do thou kiss him with a Kiss of Subjection: Psalm 2 15.^^
Kiss the Son lest he be angry.

If thou want Motives, take these following:

1. The Father presents his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, before your Eyes in the
Gospel (as he does the like himself) as a Person every way deserving your Love
and Affection, to see whether you will respect him or not.

2. The Father highly honors the Son; he has given all things into his
hand, he is his Heir.

3. The Father has sent him into the World, to seek himself a Spouse.

4. He became Flesh, that he might be a fit Object for Sinners.

5. Christ has a great desire to give himself unto you, and so become yours
for ever.

6. He has abundance of Love, great and strong Affection.

7. Christ left his Glory, and came into the World in a low and contemptible
condition, and denied himself for thy sake; and wilt not thou accept of him?

8. Shall he die, and come through a Sea of Blood to engage thy Affection? and
wilt not thou yield him a Kiss of Subjection?

9. Shall he send his Ministers, as Spokes-men, to entreat you? and will you
say, Nay?

10. Shall he move you by the Motions of his Spirit, and Checks of Conscience?
and will you still refuse to close in with him?

11. Shall he knock loud and long, and cry continually to you? and can you
still stand it out against him?

12. Will not your Gain and Preferment be great? what Honor and Dignity,
excelling Union with Christ, can you think to meet withal?

13. Are not you like to be miserable at last, if you die before you have an
Interest in him: If any love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
Maranatha.

IV. But some may say, How comes it to pass the Spouse is so bold, and thus
familiarly speaks to Christ, Let him kiss me? Should not Fervor of Affection
have with it Humility of Reverenee?

To this says Bernard, Ne causamini presumptionem, ubi affectio urget; reclamat
pudor, s^^d urget am^^r, qui nec consilio temperatur, nec pudore fraenatur. Be
not presumptuous, where Affection presses forward; be neither kept back by
Advice, nor restrained by B^^shfulness, in your Approaches to Christ. Besides,
Saints, who truly love Christ, may boldly come to Christ. Tokens of Love, and
Evidences of Divine Favor, are the proper Rights and Privileges of Believers;
they may be bold with their dearest Friend.

The Word of God compared to a Net.
Mat. 13.47. Again, the Kingdom of God is like a Net cast into the Sea.


SOme understand by the Net, and Kingdom of Heaven, that our Savior intends
the Church; others the Gospel. It may have respect to both, but in my
Understanding it is more clearly applicable to the Gospel.

Parable.
A Net is made or prepared, as a convenient thing to catch Fish.

II. A Net is made use of by skilful Fishers; it requires Wisdom rightly to use
it, to the End it is appointed. A Fisher uses oft-times much Policy and Craft,
in putting in, and drawing of his Net.

III. A Net is cast into a Multitude of Waters, at an Adventure, the Fisherman
not knowing whether it may catch many, or few, or any at all.

IV. A Fisherman works hard with his Net, sometimes a great while together, and
catches nothing.

V. A Net takes Fish of every sort, some great Ones, and some little Ones, some
good, and some bad; as it is expressed in this Parable.

VI. A Net takes Fishes out of their own natural Element; and as soon as they
are taken out of the Water they die.

VII. A Net takes or compasses sometimes a Multitude of Fishes at once. When
Simon Peter put in his Net at the special Command of Jesus Christ, Luke 5.6.
he enclosed a great Multitude of Fishes.

VIII. A Net, tho it be cast into the Sea, and has taken many Fishes, yet it is
not known of what kind or sort they be, until the Net is drawn up.

IX. After the Fisherman has drawn his Net about so long, that he concludes it
has taken all it is like to enclose and compass in, he then draws it to the
Shore, and severs the Good from the Bad; the Good he puts into Vessels, and the
Bad he throws away.

THe Gospel or Word of God is appointed to catch or convert the Souls of Men:
Fear not, Luke 5.10.
from henceforth thou shall catch Men.

II. The Word of God is made use of by skilful and able Ministers; and it
requires much spiritual Wisdom, rightly to use it for the Conversion of
Sinners. Paul being crafty, tells the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 12.16.
He took (or catched) them with Guile.

III. The Gospel is preached by a faithful Minister to a Multitude of People,
(who are compared to Waters in many Places of Scripture) and yet he knows not,
when he preaches, or casts his Net in, whether he shall take many or few
Souls, nay, whether one Sinner shall be reached or converted thereby, or not.

IV. So a Minister sometimes labors a long while together, and takes much
Pains in preaching the Gospel, and yet converts not one Soul; Isa. 53.1.
Who has believed our Report? etc. They may sometimes say with Peter, We have
labored all Night, and have taken nothing. Luke 5.5.


V. So the Gospel-Net takes hold of some of every sort and degree of Men: Some
great and honorable, rich and mighty in the World, tho not many such; some
little Ones, such as are mean and poor in the World. Again, some great and
notorious Sinners are taken, such as Mary Magdalen and Paul were, before
converted; and some that are not such great and capital Offenders: For tho
every Man is a great Sinner in a proper sense, yet comparatively some are
greater, or more guilty and profane than others: And there was a Woman in the
City, that was a Sinner: Not but that all the Women in the City were Sinners,
but this Woman was a notorious one, or one noted and eminent for Wickedness.
Also the Gospel and Church of God takes some bad Professors, and counterfeit
Christians, as well as such as are sincere.

VI. The Gospel or Word of God, the spiritual Net, takes Sinners out of their
natural Element; and as soon as they are savingly taken thereby, they die to
Sin, and to all sensual Objects, and carnal Delights of the Flesh, and this
World, and to their own Righteousness, Romans 6.2, 6, 11.

VII. The Gospel-Net also sometimes takes hold of, or encloseth many Sinners at
one Cast. At one Sermon three thousand Souls were converted, by that glorious
Preacher, Acts 2.37, 40.
and famous Fisher of Men, the Apostle Peter.

VIII. So the Gospel and Church of God, tho it takes many Souls, yet it is not
fully known of what sort they be, until the Time comes that Christ draws the
Net up.

IX. The Gospel and Church of God having taken many Sinners, or all being
brought in, that are to be taken by this spiritual Net, Christ will (as it
were) at the last Day draw it to Shore, and then he will sever the Good from
the Bad, the Sheep from the Goats, the sincere Ones from Hypocrites; and the
one shall be saved, atd the other thrown away, viz. be damned. Again, the
Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net that is cast into the Sea, that takes of
all sorts, which when it is full, Mat. 13.47, 48, 49.
Men draw it to Land, and gather the Good into Vessels, and cast the Bad away:
So shall it be at the End of the World: The Angels shall go forth, and separate
the Bad from the Good, and shall cast them into the Furnace of Fire; there
shall be wailing, and gnashing of Teeth.



Parable.
A Fisherman has one Net prepared to take small Fishes, and another to take
great Oone.

II. A Net many times proves defective, and comes to be broken, and by that
means the Fisherman loses her Draught of Fishes.

III. A Net takes Fishes out of their own natural Element, to their great hurt,
the Fisher's design in taking them, being to kill and destroy them.

Disparity.
THe Gospel or Word of God is but one and the same Net, which takes the great
and small Metaphorical Fishes.

II. There is no Defect in the Word, the Gospel-Net is never faulty, nor is it
from thence so few Sinners, or spiritual Fishes, are taken; but rather from
themselves, and Satan, 2 Cor. ^^.3, 4.
who endeavors to obstruct (as much as in him lies) their being taken thereby.

III. The Gospel-Net takes Sinners out of their natural State, viz. Ways of Sin
and Wickedness, for their great Good and Advantage; Isa. 55.3. Prove. 8.55 Prove.
22.4 Joh. 3.36. Romans 8.1.
it being the Design of God, and his Servants, the Ministers of his Word, to
save their Souls alive thereby.



Inferences.
THis Parable informs us, how useful the Gospel, and the Ministry thereof is,
to take and gather in Souls to Jesus Christ.

2. Moreover, That all who seem to be wrought upon by the Word are not sincere
Converts; a Net takes bad Fishes as well as good.

3. It also shows us what will become of the false Professors at the last Day.
The bad Fishes shall be cast away; the rotten and unsound Professor, as well as
the openly profane Person, that never made any Profession, shall be both cast
into a Furnace of Fire, there shall be wailing, and gnashing of Teeth.

The Word of God compared to Gold.
Psalm. 19.10. More to be desired are they than Gold, yea, than much fine Gold.

Psalm. 119.72. The Law of thy Mouth is better to me than Thousands of Gold and
Silver.


THo these Scriptures do not directly compare the Word of God to Gold, but
rather set out the great Excellency of it above Gold, and show the great
disproportion there is between Gold and it; yet we shall (as some Divines have
done) run a Parallel between Gold and the Word, and then in our usual Method
show the Disparities.

Simile.
GOld is a precious sort of Metal, and is esteemed the chiefest of all
Minerals. Plin. lib. 13. p. 465.
See Pliny.

II. Gold contains much in little; a small quantity of Gold is worth much
Brass, Greenhil.
etc.

III. Gold is a weighty and a firm sort of Metal.

IV. Gold has much Beauty and Splendour in it; the Color shines, and is
glorious.

V. Gold is made use of to deck and adorn with. The Father of the Prodigal
called for a Ring to put upon his Finger. Nay, more than this, the Crowns of
Kings and Princes are usually made of Gold.

VI. Gold is used to make Vessels. We read, that God appointed under the Law
many Vessels to be made of pure Gold; diverse such were in Solomon's Temple, all
which were figurative.

VII. Gold is durable: It abides the Fire, it will not lose or waste by being
put into the Furnace, as other Metals will.

VIII. Gold enriches him that finds much of it: It is esteemed as a precious
and principal Treasure; and as such, See Pliny, lib. 33. p. 455
both in former and latter Times, has it been hid and laid up: Job 22.25.
Then shall thou heap up Gold as the Dust, etc. Tyrus heaped up Silver as the
Dust, Zech. 9.3.
and fine Gold as the Mire of the Street.

IX. Men take much Pains to get Gold, they dig through Hills and Mountains for
it, and endure much Labor and Pain before they can obtain it.

X. Gold is a sort of Metal that is often tried, to see if it be what it is
taken to be, whether it be so good, pure, etc.

XI. Men that get much Gold, are oftentimes set upon by Thieves, and are in
great danger of being robbed; and from hence take care to secure it and
themselves as well as they can.

XII. Gold is known to be a rich and Sovereign Cordial, and excellent good to
cure several Diseases of the Body, particularly the King's Evil.

Parallel.
THe Word of God is very precious, and so esteemed by all true Christians: Thy
Word is very pure, Psalm. 119. Job 23.12.
therefore thy Servant loves it. I esteem the Words of thy Mouth above my
necessary Food.

II. The Word contains much in little. Fear God, O how much is contained in
that! God manifest in the Flesh; Christ, 1 Timothy 3.16. Col. 1.
the Image of the invisible God: It pleased the Father, that in him should all
Fullness dwell. Very much is contained in one of these short Sentences.

III. The Word of God is ponderous, and very weighty. The Words of Men
oft-times are airy and empty, and, when weighed in the Balance, as light as
Vanity, and not to be regarded; but what God speaks, is firm. And such as find
it not heavy and weighty now, so as to let it sink into their Hearts, shall
find it will one day sink them down to Hell: Jo^^. 12.50.
The Words that I speak shall judge you at the last Day.

IV. So is the Word of God. The Gospel is said to be glorious, it is indeed
transcendently excellent; 2 Cor. 4.4.
its Glory shines forth, and may be demonstrated many ways. See Metaphor Light.

V. The Word of God most gloriously decks and adorns every true Christian, that
has store of it in his Heart, in whom it dwells richly. The Church is said to
be clothed with wrought Gold; the Word of God, and the Graces thereof, are
doubtless intended thereby. The Gospel is the Saints Crown, and Royal Diadem;
should God suffer it to be taken away, they may cry out with Israel of old, The
Crown is fallen from our Head, Lam 5.16.
woe to us that we have sinned. The Law of God is said to be an Ornament unto
the Head, and Chains about the Neck, called, Cant. 1.10. Chains of Gold.

VI. The Word of God is made use of by Jesus Christ, to make many Golden
Vessels, Golden Saints, Golden Churches, called by the Spirit Golden
Candlesticks. Rev. 1.20. See Candle stick and Vessel.
No People in the World are so glorious, precious, and amiable, as God's People.

VII. The Word of God is durable. All the Endeavors of wicked Men from time to
time, have been to destroy the Word; it has been in many Fires, (as I may say)
and yet it remains and abides the same. Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but
my Word shall not pass away. Mat. 5.18. 1 Pet. 1.24, 25.
All Flesh is Grass, and all the Glory of Man as the Flower of the Field: The
Grass withers, and the Flower thereof fades away. But the Word of the Lord
endures for ever: and this is the Word which by the Gospel is preached to you.

VIII. The Word of God is of a Soul-enriching Nature; it enriches the Mind with
the Wisdom and glorious Knowledge of Jesus Christ, and blessed Experience of his
rich Love and Grace: Let the Word of God dwell in you richly, Col. 3.16.
in all Wisdom. No Treasure is like to the Treasure of God's Word: 2 Cor. 4.7.
We have this Treasure in earthen Vessels. (See Metaphor Treasure.) David hid
it; Psalm. 119.11.
and Mary, as a precious Treasure, laid it up in her Heart.

IX. So those that would be enriched with the Word of God, have much of it in
their Heads and Hearts, must take Pains; they must dig in these Golden Mines
(as it were) for it. Joh. 5.39.
Search the Scriptures, says Christ. It is a Word taken from Miners, such as
seek for Gold; they must do it carefully, vigorously, and resolvedly. If they
would find the Power, Virtue, and Excellency of the Word, so as to make it
their own, they must seek for it as for hidden Treasure. Prove. 2.4.


X. The Word of God is called a tried Word; it has been tried by many thousand
Christians, and found to be what it is taken to be, viz. pure Gold, sacred
Truth; yea, Psalm. 119.203. Psalm. 19.10 and 12.6.
and sweeter than the Honey, or the Honeycomb. It never failed them that
trusted to it. As for God, his Way is perfect. The Words of the Lord are pure
Words, as Silver is tried in a Furnace of Earth, purified seven times.

XI. Those People, or particular Souls, that do possess and enjoy much of the
glorious Word of God, are in danger of being set upon by spiritual Thieves and
Robbers; Satan, and many other his Emissaries, will be sure to assault such.
What experience has England had of this for many Years, but more especially of
late? How is it beset by bold, impudent, and bloody Romish Thieves? What is the
reason? Why, England is rich, it has got much Gold in it, much of the Word of
God: Here are a rich People, many rich Churches, rich Souls; and therefore this
grand Thief has consulted with many of his Company, to set upon us, and rob us
of all our Treasure. And hence it is we take, or ought to take such Care, to
secure the Word of God, and our selves from being undone by losing it.

XII. So the Word of God is by all true Christians known, and by common
Experience found, to be a most Sovereign Cordial for the Soul, to revive and
comfort a desponding and drooping Spirit, excellent good to cure inward
Distempers.



METAPHOR.
GOld, and earthly Treasures, are (by the permission of God) at the Will and
Command of Men. Daniel tells us, that the vile Person shall have Power over the
Treasures of Gold and Silver, etc. They may take away, and dispossess us of the
best of earthly things.

II. Gold may canker and corrupt: Your Gold and Silver is cankered, Jam. 5.2.
and the Rust of them shall be a Witness against you.

III. Tho Gold will do many things for the Body, yet it cannot profit the Soul;
it will beautify and enrich the outward Man, but it cannot beautify, purge, or
enrich the inward Man.

IV. Gold and Silver will not satisfy or fill the craving Desires of Man:
Neither is his Eye satisfied with Riches. Eccles. 4.8 and 5.10.
He that loves Silver, shall not be satisfied therewith.

Disparity.
THe Word of God received into the Heart, viz. into the Affection and
Understanding, etc. no Man can take it from us; it is not in their Power to rob
and dispossess us of this sacred Gold. They may take away our Bibles out of our
hands, but cannot take the Word of God out of our Hearts, as it is engraven
upon the fleshly Tables thereof.

II. The Word of God is incorruptible, so pure, that it can never canker,
neither lose any of its excellent Glory, Beauty, and Virtue, it admits not of
any Rust or Pollution: Being born again, 1 Pet. 1.23
not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which
lives and abides for ever.

III. The Word of God enriches, beautifies, and purges the Soul: Now are you
clean, Joh. 15.3.
through the Word that I have spoken unto you. He is spiritually the richest
Man, that has most of the Word of God abiding in him, who has store of
precious Promises laid up against a Time of Need.

IV. The Word of God received in Truth, is of a Soul-satisfying Nature: The
Fear of the Lord tends to Life, Prove. 19.23
and he that has it shall abide satisfied, etc. This is that Water of Life,
that whosoever drinks thereof shall thirst no more, have no more an
inordinate and unsatiable desire after worldly things. See Water.



Inferences.
1. FRom hence you may see who are the richest Men in the World.

2. It reproves them that desire Gold above the Word, and that labor for it
above the Blessings of the Word, and grieve more for the Loss of it, and of
other earthly Treasure, than for the Loss of the Word, and other spiritual good
things.

3. It may also stir up all to hold fast the Word, and every part and parcel of
it. Let the Saints of God in England consider of the Worth of the Word, and
that it is more precious than Gold. How will Men expose themselves, before they
will be robbed of Thousands of Gold and Silver?

4. Esteem of the Precepts and Promises, and of every Jot and Tittle of God's
Word, above Gold. Be not careless of it, nor throw it by, but lay it up as
carefully as you lay up Gold, hide it in your Hearts.

The Word of God called Milk.
1 Pet. 2.2. As newborn Babes, desire the sincere Milk, of the Word, that they
may grow thereby.

Heb. 5.13. For every one that uses Milk, is unskilful in the Word of
Righteousness, for he is a Babe.


BY Milk here, we must understand the Doctrine of the Gospel, which is easily
taught unto the Capacities of such as are Children in Understanding.

METAPHOR.
MIlk is good to nourish the Body; and Physicians tell us, Where it is well
digested, it makes good Blood.

II. Milk is proper Food for Children, and newborn Babes; it nourishes them
exceedingly; they grow and thrive thereby, tho they have nothing else to feed
upon.

III. Newborn Babes greatly desire and long after the Milk of the Breast.

Schola Saler^^, cap. 43.
IV. Milk is a Restorative, excellent good in Consumptions, or for them that be
lean.

V. Milk was one of those choice Blessings that Canaan did abound withal: It Is
called a Land flowing with Milk and Honey; as much as to say, it is a Land of
rare and choice good things.

Parallel.
THe Word of God is good Food for the Soul: Man lives not by Bread alone, Mat.
4.4.
but by every Word that proceeds out of the Mouth of God. Where the Word of
God is received, and well digested in the Understanding, it tends to make a
sound Christian.

II. The Word of God is proper Food for those that are born again by the
Spirit, or are truly regenerated. Such, like newborn Babes, grow and thrive by
feeding spiritually upon the Word, Precepts, and Promises of God; and many
have lived upon it, and have been satisfied thereby, when they have had nothing
else to feed upon.

III. So upright and faithful Christians greatly thirst after and desire the
Word of God: As newborn Babes, 1 Pet. 2.2.
desire the sincere Milk of the Word.

IV. The spiritual Milk of the Word is an excellent Restorative for a
consumptive, wasted, and decayed Christian: They that wait upon the Lord, shall
renew their Strength. Isa. 40.31*


V. The holy Word of God is one of the choicest Blessings God has bestowed
upon his Church and People. Those that would see the Excellency of the Word
and Gospel of Christ, may read the Metaphor Light.



Application.
YOu may know by this, whether you are born again or no. Do you cry for, and
greatly desire after the pure Word of God, the sincere Milk of the Word,
without humane Mixtures and Ceremonies? The Word of God feeds best, when it is
without any Composition of human Invention.

The Word of God compared to Strong-Meat.
Heb. 5.14. But strong Meat belongs to them that are of Age, etc.


AS the Word of God is called Milk, so it is also called Strong Meat. By strong
Meat, is meant the more profound, perfect, and mysterious Doctrine of the
Gospel, which is to feed strong Christians.

METAPHOR.
STrong Meat is not meet or convenient Food for Babes; if they could eat it,
yet they want strength to digest it.

II. If Children, after they are grown up, and arrived to Years of Maturity,
refuse strong Meat, and cannot feed upon any thing but Milk, there may be cause
to fear they are some way defective or diseased.

III. Strong Meat yields strong and perfect Nourishment; such as can feed
upon, and well digest it, are more able and capable for Business, than those
that only feed or live upon Milk.

Parallel.
THere is something contained in the Word of God, that young Christians, who
are like newborn Babes, cannot receive it so as to understand it; it is not
proper for them. Heb. 5.12, 13.
The Milk of the Word, (such things as are easily taken in) is for them; strong
Meat belongs to strong Christians, Men of Experience.

II. So if Christians, who have been a great while converted, and in the
Profession of the Gospel, and yet cannot take in, nor feed upon any thing but
the Milk of the Word, strong Meat, being offensive to them, it argues some
great defect in their Understanding, or that they are spiritually distempered.

III. So those Christians that can feed upon the strong Meat of the Word, who
in their Understandings can in some measure relish and digest the Mysteries of
the Gospel, or those deep things of God, 1 Cor. 2.10
get most spiritual Strength, and are more fit for Business, than the Weak, who
only live upon Milk.



The Word of God compared to Honey.
Psalm. 19.10. Sweeter than Honey, and the Honeycomb, to my Taste.

Psalm. 119.130. How sweet are thy Words unto my Taste! yea, sweeter than Honey
unto my Mouth!

Rev. 10.9. But it shall be in thy Mouth as sweet as Honey.


SWeeter than Honey, or the Honeycomb; not only the most fine and delicate
Honey, but all things which be delightful and pleasant to the Taste, by a
Synechdoche. Because nothing is generally so precious and pleasant as Gold and
Honey, thence Comparisons are taken from these rather than other things, to
express the very great Worth and Sweetness of God's Word. Wilson.

Simile.
HOney is exceeding sweet to the Taste: Jud. 14.18.
What is sweeter than Honey?

II. Honey, if it be added or put into other things that are bitter, it will
take away (in a great measure) the bitterness thereof, and so cause a Man to
receive it down with less difficulty.

III. But notwithstanding Honey is so sweet and pleasant, yet there are some
Men that do not care for it: The full Soul loatheth the Honeycomb.

IV. Naturalists affirm, that Honey is good to dissolve and dissipate Tumors
and Swellings, and to mollify Hardness; and that it is of an healing nature,
and serves for an infinite number of Uses.

V. Honey is also of a purging Quality.

Parallel.
SO the Word of God is very sweet and pleasant to the Taste of gracious Souls.
What is more desirable to a sincere Believer, than the sacred Precepts and
Promises of the Gospel?

II. So if the Soul be under Affliction, Temptation, Persecution for Christ's
sake, (which are bitter things in themselves) yet if God be pleased to add or
put into this Bitter, but some of the sweet Promises of the Word, how
wonderfully is the Bitterness abated, and with what ease can a Christian bear
up under them!

III. Tho the Word of God is so precious and desirable, yet there are many
wicked and ungodly Ones, that cannot endure it. A vile Papist, in the Massacre
of Ireland, took up a Bible, and cursed it, saying, That had done all the
Mischief. Sinners are so glutted with the filthy Trash of this World, that they
loath this sacred Honeycomb.

IV. The Word of God is of most Sovereign Virtue to dissolve and dissipate all
spiritual Tumors of the Soul, and to mollify and break in pieces the Hardness
of the Heart. How did it mollify the Hearts of the three thousand Peter
preached unto. See Hammer. Acts 2.36, 37.


V. The Word and Spirit of God, when they operate together in the Soul, are the
best spiritual Purgation in the World: Psalm. 119.9. John 15.3.
Now are ye clean, through the Word that I have spoken unto you.



Simile.
THere are several hurtful Qualities in Honey, which may be prevented by taking
the Advice of the Learned Physician.

II. There is much Dross in Honey.

Disparity.
THere are no hurtful Qualities in the Word of God; that needs no humane Skill
to correct or clarify it.

II. There is none in the Word of God: Thy Word is very pure, Psalm. 119.140.
therefore thy Servant loves it.



Inferences.
HEnce let us learn, with the industrious Be, to gather some Honey out of
every Flower of God's Word. How does that little Creature labor in the Summer,
to store her self with Food against Winter? Let every Christian learn of them,
but more especially the Ministers of God's Word, that their Lips may drop like
the Honeycomb. And let us examine, whether we ever as yet experienced the
Word sweet as Honey to our Taste?

The Word compared to Fire.
Jer. 20.9. His Word was in mine Heart as a burning Fire, etc. And Chap. 23.29.
Is not my Word like as Fire?

1 These. 5.19. Quench not the Spirit.


The Holy-Spirit and Word of God, is, and may be fitly compared to Fire.

METAPHOR.
FIre is of an illuminating or inlightning Quality.

II. Fire is of a warming and heating Quality; there is not only Illumination,
but Calefaction.

III. Fire will burn any combustable matter it can seize upon, separating Metal
from Rust and Dross, it discovers whether Metals be of a current or counterfeit
and base allay. Whatever Fire seizes effectually upon, it converts it into a
Flame.

IV. Fire is of an ascending Quality, greedily mounting to its proper Seat, and
will not rest till it incorporates with its own Elements. Earth and Water
incline to their own Centers, though sometimes artificially made to ascend.

V. Fire is of a melting and softning Quality, Iron, and other Metals are made
pliable by it, and fit to receive any Figure whatsoever, as Wax keeps the
Impression of the Seal.

VI. Fire has a vivifying inlivening and quickening Quality, it refreshes and
restores that Heat and Warmth, which the prevailing Cold deprives us of.

VII. Fire is of a comforting and consolating Quality or Nature

VIII. Fire is of a penetrating or piercing Nature, there is no pore or secret
Passage of the Body thrown into it, but it pierces it.

IX. Fire is of an assimilating Quality, that is, it changes all Materials into
its own Nature, or sets them on fire.

X. Fire is a very profitable Element, there is a necessity of it; many Trades
cannot be followed without it, nor can Men and Women live without it.

XI. Fire is oft-times quenched, and in a great measure put out, to the damage
of those for whom it was kindled.

Parallel.
THe Word and Spirit is Light. The Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is Light;
inlightning the Eyes. Prove. 6.23.
Psalm. 19.8. The Entrance of it gives Light. Psalm. 119.130. By it the Eyes of
our Understanding are enlightened: By which we know the Riches of his Glory. See
Metaphor Light. Ephesians. 1.17, 18.


II. The Word and Spirit of God, give Heat and Warmth to the benumbed Soul of a
poor Sinner; they give Zeal and Fervency (that is) Heat of Spirit to serve the
Lord.

III. The Word and Spirit of God burns and consumes all that is fit Fuel for it;
when thoroughly kindled upon the Souls and Consciences of Men, 1 Cor. 3.11, 12,
13, 14, 15.
it destroys the Hay, Stubble, Wood, Chaff, etc. of Sin and Corruption; and
leaves no Metals in the Building unconsum'd, save what is built upon the
Foundation, Jesus Christ, who like Gold, Silver and precious Stones will endure
the Fire; it also causes the Soul to burn in Love to Christ, Luke 24.32
to be lifted up with transported Ardency of Affection after him, and desiring
to be united to him also. All Men are to be tried whether with respect to
Doctrines or Practices by God's Word, and what disagrees with this Standard, or
will not bear touch with this Touchstone, is to be rejected as counterfeit,
and of no value.

IV. The word of God when it has by the Spirit, kindled the Soul of a Sinner,
it immediately causes his Affections and Desires to ascend and mount up to
Heaven as to its Center and only Place of Satisfaction, leaving (as the Fire
only leaves Ashes) his dreggy and impure Part behind; the Soul seems to be then
on the Wing wholly for Heaven, too pure and ^^enned for Communion with corrupt
things. They shall dwell on high, etc. Isa. 33.16.

V. The Word by the Spirit, softens the hard and stony Heart, and makes it a
Heart of Flesh, disposes the Soul, and makes him fit to receive or take the
Seal or heavenly Impression, and Image of God. See Zeal.

VI. The Word and Spirit quickens the Soul of a Sinner, nay raises to Li^^e
those who have been, in a spiritual Sense, Ephesians. 2.2*
dead in Sins and Trespasses. It Is the Spirit that quickenns, the Flesh profits
nothing. Joh. 6.63. Romans 8.2.
The Law kills, but the Spirits gives Life.

VII. The Spirit of God, called the Comforter, administers the greatest, nay,
the only Consolation to the Soul of Believers: Joh. 14.16, 17.
O what Comforts have some poor deject Christians received from the gracious
Promises of God's Word!

VIII. The Word and Spirit of God searches all the Faculties and Powers of the
Soul; Heb. 4.12.
it penetrates not only the Head but the Heart, Judgment, Affections,
Conscience, Will, etc. It leaves no Corner unvisited, nor secret Place
undiscerned.

IX. The Word and Spirit of God makes the Soul spiritual, Joh. 3.6. 1 Cor.
2.15. 1 Cor. 6.17. 2 Pet. 1.4.
transforms the carnal Mind, and makes it partaker of its own divine Nature, it
sets it in a flame of Love and spiritual Zeal for Christ and his blessed Truth.

X. The Word and Spirit of God is of such absolute necessity, Rev. 11. Job 2.12.
that Saints cannot live one Moment without it. Hence the Spirit of Christ is
called, The Spirit of Life. Moreover, the Word of God was esteemed by Job,
above his necessary Food; and by David, above thousands of Gold and Silver. Man
lives not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds out of the Mouth of
God. Mat. 4.4. A Christian can perform no Duty aright acceptable to God,
without the Divine Help and Influences of the Spirit of God.

XI. So is the Divine Fire many times quenched and put out in a great measure,
to the hurt and damage of Christians. Quench not the Spirit. 1 These. 5.19.



METAPHOR.
FIre is an external Element, and only useful for the Profit and Comfort of the
outward Man.

II. Fire is a bad Master, when it has got to a head and violently breaks out,
it does much Mischief, and destroys wonderfully.

Disparity.
THe Spirit of God and his Word are divine, sacred, and heavenly, profitable to
the Soul of Man.

II. The Word and Spirit of God never hurts or injures those that it gets the
Mastery and Victory over; if it destroys it is only Sin, and such things that
would ruin and spoil the Soul; happy are those, in whom the Word of God and
his Spirit does reign and predominate.



Inferences.
IF this be so, take heed you do not quench the Word or Spirit of God; which
you may be said to do:

1. By a bating of the Spirit's Heat in its Operations, or by diminishing or
lessening the Graces and good Motions thereof, when the Spirit loses the vigor
of his Operations, as when Zeal decays, Convictions wear off, and Affections
die; this is like slacking the Heat, and lessening the Burning of the Fire.

2. When Men do not only diminish and lessen the Burnings and Operations of the
Spirit in the Graces, Influences, and Motions thereof, but yield to Sin and the
Devil, so far as to put the Fire quite out: The common Motions and Operations
of the Spirit may be quite extinguished. Give us of your Oil, for our Lamps are
gone out. Mat. 25.8.
We read of some twice dead, plucked up by the Roots.

Quest. Which way may the Spirit and the Word of God be quenched?

Answ. 1. By witholding of Fuel. Where no Wood is, the Fire goes out. We feed
that Fire which we would not have extinguished, we labor to add fit matter to
it, Prove. 26.20.
that we may keep up the heat and burning of it. Persons may be said to quench
the Spirit, when they neglect the Means which God has appointed for the
keeping feeding and preserving of it in its full Vigor, Heat, and Operations in
the Soul, when they neglect Prayer, reading, hearing of the Word, Meditations,
the Fire of the Spirit, Zeal and Fervency soon decays.

2. The Spirit of God may be quenched, by neglecting to stir it up. Paul
exhorts Timothy to stir up the Gift that was in him. If Fire be not stirred and
blown up, it will soon lessen its Burning, and go out. No Man stirs up
himself to take hold of thee. Isa. 64.7.
It Is not enough to pray, read, and hear the Word; but to stir up our selves to
do these Duties of Religion fervently: if there be never so much Wood on the
Fire, yet, if it be not blown and stirred up, the dead Ashes will obstruct the
Burning. So in like manner, tho Men be never so much in the performance of
Religious Duties, yet if they let the Ashes of Formality and Deadness remain
upon their Hearts, the Fire of the Spirit decays.

3. Fire is quenched by opposing somewhat of a contrary Nature and Quality to
it, as Water, (or the like.) Fire and Water are contrary the one to the other,
by reason of their contrary Qualities; a little matter will weaken and lessen
the burning of Fire, and if a Man pour in much of it, 'twill soon quite
exstinguish it; so in like manner the Word and Spirit, by suffering a little
Sin and Corruption to remain in the Heart or Life, will soon decay in its
Operations. Sin is unto the Spirit, as Water to the Fire. The Flesh lusts
against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh, and these two are
contrary the one to the other. Gal. 3.17.

But now, if a Man yields to some Sins, to some heinous Sins, or once lay the
Reins loose as it were upon the Neck of his Lusts, plotteth and premeditates
Sin; regards it, likes it, and watches an Opportunity to sin; this will soon,
like much Water, quench the Fire; also Sin reiterated and often committed, tho
not so notorious or scandalous, has the like Effect. The frequent acting of
Sin, is like a continual dropping upon the Fire, nothing more dangerous than a
trade in Sin.

That you may escape this great Evil, of quenching the Word and Spirit, observe
these Particulars following.

1. Consider, It Is a divine Spark which is kindled in your Souls, it is heavenly
Fire, it is a holy and sacred thing, Men know not what they do when they quench
the Motions of the Spirit, and will not suffer the Word to kindle in them.

2. Consider, Who it is that has kinled this Fire in thee, or strives to do
it; is it not the Almighty, the ever blessed God? will thou adventure to put
out the Fire which the Majesty of Heaven and Earth has kindled in thee?

3. Consider how much Pains God has taken to kindle it; how long was it, and
what means did the Lord make use of before he could cause (to speak after the
manner of Men) the Word to take hold of thee? Did he not send a Spark upon thee
at one Sermon? and then blow upon it, that it might break out into a Flame? and
then send another Spark, another Sermon, and then another, and another, and may
be after all, he brought thee into Affliction, and used many ways to effect
this great and good Work of his own Spirit and Grace upon thy Heart; and will thou adventure to mar and spoil this Work, and quench this Fire? which is thus
of the Lord's kindling. If a Father, Mother, or any eminent Superior should
take much Pains, and be at great Charge to kindle a Fire, and a Child should
know this, and yet adventure to throw Water upon it, and put it out; or yield
to a cursed Foe of theirs so to do, would it not be judged a notorious Offense?

4. Consider the gracious Design of God in kindling this Divine Fire in the
Soul, it is that he might raise thee to Life, give thee Light, melt thy hard
Heart, and make it fit to receive an heavenly Impression, it is to cement and
unite thy Heart to himself, that thou might glorify him, enjoy him, and be
glorified with him for ever.

5. Consider, If this Fire go out, thou can never kindle it again; it is
beyond thy Skill and Wisdom. If thou quench another Fire, it may be thou may
kindle that again, and make it burn as before; but it is not in thy Power to
make this Fire burn. Of his own Will begat be us, with the word of Truth. As
many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to
them that believe on his Name. Jam. 1.18. Joh. 1.12, 13. Phil. 1.6. Isa. 26.12.
Who were born not of Blood, nor of the will of the Flesh, nor of the will of
Man, but of God. He is said, to begin this good Work in us, He is the Author
and Finisher of our Faith. Lord thou will, says the Prophet, ordain Peace for
us, for thou also have wrought all our Works in us.

6. Consider, Thou know not whether God will ever set about this Work again,
or no, should thou hearken to thy Lusts and Satan's Temptations, to quench
the Spirit and put out those good Motions and Desires that are in thy Mind;
Genesis 6.
remember that Word, My Spirit shall not always strive with Men. And also what
our Savior in the Gospel spoke concerning Jerusalem, O that thou had known,
even thou at least in this thy day, Luke 3.19, 42.
the things that belong to thy Peace, but now they are hid from thine Eyes.

7. Consider, It Is grievous to the Spirit to be quenched, the Spirit is thy
great Friend, thy Comforter, the Spirit helps thee at every dead Lift, Joh. 16
7. Romans 8.26
and makes Intercession for thee with Groanings, which cannot be uttered. And
therefore do not grieve him; Will thou quench and put out the Motions of such a
Friend? Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed to the day of
Redemption. Ephesians. 4.30.


8. Consider, The Spirit is thy Light, put out the Spirit, and thou will become
a dead Man; or lessen his Burnings and gracious Operations, and thou will
become a dying Man: would thou not have thy Eyes out of thy Head nor thy
Life out of thy Body? then do not quench the Spirit, the Eye and Life of thy
Soul.

9. Consider what the Cause and Reason is, Men quench the Spirit.

1. Is it not because they would be indulged in their Sins, and lie down on the
Bed of Sloth and carnal Security? Men put out their Fire when they have a mind
to go to Bed.

2. Is it not because the Fire burns too hot for them? it has kindled such a
Fire in their Consciences, that scorcheth them so sorely, that they know not
how to endure it; and from hence wickedly go about to quench the Spirit. Thus
'twas with Felix, he heard Paul preach of Righteousness, Temperance, and
Judgment to come, and he trembles, his Conscience smote him; but now to quench
the Spirit and allay that, Heat he might find within, he sends away Paul: When
I have (says he) a convenient time, I will call for thee.

3. Is it not because this Fire of the Word and Spirit is too chargeable and
costly for them? they, like Men, grudg that which the Fire consumes, or will,
if it be kept burning. The Young Man in the Gospel was not willing to sell his
Possession, and part with all for Christ. When Men see they must part with so
much to the Minister, ( God having ordained that they who preach the Gospel,
should live of the Gospel) and so much to the Poor Saints, and besides all this
be exposed to suffer the Prosecution of such and such Penal Laws; this great
Charge they see already fall upon them, and what further they know not may fall
upon them by keeping up the Fire of the Word and Spirit, the thoughts of which
they cannot bear: and from hence, wickedly go about to quench the Spirit.

4. Do not Men quench the Fire, or lessen its Burning when it makes the Pot
boil over, when they fear that all that is in the Pot or Vessel will be lost?
even so some Men, when the Fire of the Word and Spirit is so hot and strong,
that it is like to boil out a beloved Lust which they have prized for its
Profitableness, like a Right Hand, or for Pleasures, like a Right-Eye, then
they haste to lessen the Fire; See Theophilus P^^lwhele, of quenching the
Spirit, p. 33.
and like Judas, think there needs not be so much waste. Now what a vile thing
(says one) is this, to quench the Fire of the Spirit, rather than the Scum and
Filthiness of Sin should be worked and boiled out thereby? See how God
threatens such. Ezekiel. 24.6. Woe to the Pot whose Scum is therein, and whose Scum
is not gone out of it? therefore says God, Verse 11. Set it emptey upon the
Coals, that the Brass of it may be hot and may burn, and that the Filthiness of
it may be molten in it, that the Scum of it may be consumed. She has wearied
her self with Lies, her Scum shall be in the Fire. In thy Filthiness is
Lewdness. Her Obstinacy was such, that tho God had made use of means to purge
her, she refused to be purged. And therefore God pronounced that dreadful
Threatening against her, Thou shall not be purged from thy Filthiness any more.
Some are not willing to part with their Sins, they would keep the poisonous
Liquor and Scum in the Vessel, and for this the Vessel and Scum must be burned
together, and shall never be parted.

5. Do not Men quench the Fire, and put out their Candle when it is like to
expose them to danger, when Thieves and cursed Enemies are abroad, out of fear
they keep all close, and are not willing any should see Fire-Light nor
Candlelight, nor any thing should discover them. So out of Fear in time of
Common danger, some Men quench the Fire of the Word and Spirit; the Word like a
Candle, is thrust under a Bushel or under a Bed, and the Motions of the Spirit
for a public Testimony are put out.

6. Men quench the Fire, says the same Author, when it is like to set the House
on fire; so some Professors quench the Spirit, when they see what fiery Trials
they are like to pass through, if they continue in the heat of their Zeal.

7. Some Men quench the Fire when they are warm enough without it; they warm
themselves by the Sparks of their own kindling, these, says God, Isa. 50.11.
shall lie down in sorrow; they conclude their own Righteousness, and their old
Ways and Conversation will be sufficient, and so turn with the Dog to his
Vomit, 2 Pet.
and with the Sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the Mire.

8. Some Men let the Fire go out, says he, through a multitude of Business;
Luke 10.
their Minds being taken up with other things, they forget it: So some Men
forget the Word, Spirit and Religion, being like Martha, troubled about many
things. Now what a wicked thing is it from all, or any of these Causes, to
quench the Spirit?

10. Consider, It Is by the Spirit thou must mortify the Deeds of the Flesh,
which thou must do or be damned. Romans 8.13. And how can thou do that, when
the Spirit is quenched; it is no marvel if Corruptions prevail, when the Spirit
is put out that should burn them up.

11. Consider, It Is by the Spirit and Word, which is called the Sword of the
Spirit, by which you should wrestle, and resist all the Temptations of Satan;
but when the Fire of the Spirit is quenched, it puts an Opportunity in Satan's
hand, to kindle the Fire of Pride, Malice, and Lust of Concupiscence in thy
Heart; when the Spirit is quenched, and the Sword thrown away, what Execution
can be done upon this spiritual Enemy?

12. Consider, It Is by the help and influence of the Holy Spirit thou must
perform all Duties of Religion, or they will never be accepted of God; and how
can that be done when the Spirit is quenched, and the Motions and Operations
thereof cease?

If the Word and Spirit be compared to Fire, let us bless God for kindling this
Fire in our Hearts and Nation, and pray that he would be pleased to blow more
and more upon it, that it may burn up all the Chaff and Dross of our
Corruptions, and inflame our Souls with a greater degree of Love to God, and
Zeal to Religion.

And let us take heed we do not quench the Spirit in others. Wicked Men would
fain put this Fire quite out; what unwearied Attempts have they made from time
to time in this and other Nations, to extinguish the Light of the Word? Ungodly
Papists cannot endure the heat of this Fire, they are not more ready to kindle
other Fires (to the spoiling and impoverishing of the Kingdom) than they are to
put out this: they will not suffer it to burn in themselves, so they, as much
as in them lies, endeavor to quench it in others; like those Men whom our
Savior reprehended in the days of his Flesh, who would not go into Heaven
themselves, nor suffer them, who would go thither, to enter in.

But in the last place, Let them, and all other wicked Persons, take heed how
they quench this divine Fire; for if it burn not up their Sins and Corruptions,
and kindle Grace and Holiness in them, they must burn one day in Hell: for
either this Fire must be suffered to burn in them, or they be condemned to
eternal Burning for quenching of it.

The Word of God compared to a Hammer.
Jer. 23.29. Is not my Word like as a Fire, says the Lord? and like a Hammer
that breaks the Rock in pieces?


IN these Words, the Word of God is compared to Fire, which we have already
spoken of.

2. As the Word is compared to Fire; so likewise to a Hammer.

3. The Heart of a Sinner is compared to a Rock. We shall here only speak of
the Word as it is compared to a Hammer.

Simile.
A Hammer is a fit Instrument to break Rocks, and beat Stones in pieces, etc.

II. A Hammer can do nothing of it self without the hand that uses it.

III. According to the Strength, Design and Wisdom of the Workman, a Hammer
does effect this or that, etc.

IV. A Hammer is not only a fit Instrument to break things in pieces withal;
but also to drive home Nails, etc. and to clench and fasten them also.

Parallel.
THe Word of God is prepared by the Almighty, as a fit means to break in pieces
the stony, and rocky Hearts of Sinners.

II. The Word of God cannot of it self break in pieces the Sinner's Heart: God
must use it by the hand of the Spirit, if ever it accomplish that for which he
sent it.

III. So according to the Design, Wisdom and Strength the Holy Ghost is pleased
to put forth upon the Heart of a Sinner, is the nature of the Work that is
effected or accomplished thereby.

VI. So the Word of God in the hand of the Spirit is very useful to drive home
and fasten, (1.) The Nails of Conviction; (2.) To drive home and fasten
Precepts; (3.) To drive home and fasten Promises. God is the great Master of
Assemblies, Eccles. 12.11.
who fastens the Words of the Wise as Goads and Nails, given from one Shepherd.



Inferences.
EXamine your selves: have you experienced the Word to be like a Hammer?

(1.) Have you been broken in pieces by it? have you been under Grief and
Trouble for your Sins?

(2.) Are you broken off from your Sins?

(3.) Are your Hearts soft?

(4.) Has the Word and Spirit of God fastened Convictions so upon you, that
you cannot get free of them? Do they abide like a Nail in a sure place? Have
the Precepts of God in like manner been drove home, that you cannot rest till
you have submitted to them? Have Promises been so fastened, as that you do
believe, and steadfastly apply them to your own Souls?

II. If you would have the Word of God break your hard and rocky Hearts, then,

(1.) Consider the Severity of it, touching the Threatenings thereof, Gal. 3.10.
Mark 16.16. Luke 13.5.

(2.) Consider what has been executed upon such who break the Word. 1. Adam.
2. The old World. 3. Korah and his Company. Those that broke Moses 's Law, dyed
without Mercy under two or three Witnesses. Heb. 10.28.

(3.) Consider the Truth of the Word. Mat. 5.18. Job 36.17. Luke 21.22.

(4.) The Power and Authority of the Word.

(5.) The Torments of the Damned.

(6.) Read often, and consider the Sufferings of Christ.

(7.) Cry to God that he would be pleased to take the Hammer of the Word into
the hand of his Spirit, and smite your rocky Hearts. See Simile, stony and
rocky Heart.

The Word of God the Sword of the Spirit.
Ephesians. 6.17. And the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.


TWO things may be inquired into, and in both these respects we shall run the
Parallel.

1. Why the Word of God is compared to a Sword? 2. Why the Word is called
the Sword of the Spirit?
1. Some take (as Mr. Gurnall observes) the Abstract here to be put for the
Concrete, (...) for (...), Sword of the Spirit, for the spiritual Sword;
Garnall's Christians Armor. p. 297.
as if it were no more but take the spiritual Sword which is the Word of God,
according to that of the Apostle. 2 Cor. 10.4. The Weapons of our Warfare are
not carnal, but mighty; that is, spiritual Weapons: Indeed Satan being a
Spirit, must be fought with spiritual Weapons; and such is the Word of God,
viz. a spiritual Sword; but this tho true, reaches not the full sense of the
Place, where (...) is taken Personaliter, for the Person of the Holy Spirit.

METAPHOR.
A Sword is a Weapon generally made use of by all Soldiers of every Rank and
Quality: the Captain, as well as the ordinary Soldier, has and ought to have
his Sword.

II. A Sword is a Weapon by which they do not only defend themselves, but also
do great Execution upon their Enemies.

III. A Sword is a keen, sharp, piercing Weapon; it will enter into the Body
and pierce the very Heart of a Man.

IV. A Sword is an honorable Weapon, and of great Antiquity; it has been in
use from the beginning, a Weapon that no Enemy has any just cause to quarrel
with.

V. Some Swords have two Edges, they will cut both ways, they will cut
backwards and forwards, as they go in and as they come out.

VI. A Sword will cut off a Member; many a Leg and Arm have been cut off
therewith.

VII. Some Wounds of a Sword are so mortal, that there is no cure for them.

VIII. A Sword is born oft-times before a Magistrate to signify Authority and
Justice. He bears not the Sword in vain. Romans 13.8


IX. A Sword is a very victorious Weapon, it has done great Execution in the
World. Joshua made great Slaughter upon the seven Nations of Canaan with the
Sword; it is said, he put all the Souls in several Cities to the Edg of the
Sword.

Parallel.
THE Word of God, the spiritual Sword, every Christian (of what Rank or
Quality soever) makes use of, and cannot, ought not to be without it; the
Captain General fought with this VVeapon himself, Ministers, Mat. 4.4, 5, 6, 7,
8.
as well as every private Christian, ought always to be armed herewith.

II. So the Word of God is a spiritual VVeapon, by which a Christian does not
only defend himself from the danger of Sin, and Satan, the World, etc. but by
it he offends, yea, cuts down and overcomes and vanquishes all these and other
cruel Enemies of the Soul, (1.) The Word is a defensive VVeapon. (Says
David.) By the Word of thy Lips, I have kept me from the Paths of the
Destroyer. Unless thy Law had been my Delight, Psalm. 17.4. and 119 92.
I should have perished in my Affliction. (2). Offensive; by it our blessed
Captain made the Prince of Darkness fly. It is written, thou shall not tempt
the Lord thy God. Mat. 4.


III. The Word of God is sharper than any Sword. If the Spirit uses it, Heb.
4.12.
it will soon enter into and pierce the Heart of a Sinner; as appears by that
notable Instance concerning those Jews that put the Lord Jesus to death; whilst
Peter preached the Word to them, it is said, they were pricked in their
Hearts. Act. 2.37.


IV. The Word of God is an honorable VVeapon, our Savior and all holy
Prophets and good Men would never else have made use of it: it is also of great
Antiquity, the Writings of Moses, as it is observed by diverse, were before any
humane Records. No Devil nor vile Heretic has any cause to except against it,
or to quarrel with the Holy Scripture.

V. The Word of God is quicK and powerful, sharper than any two-edged Sword;
it has a twofold Operation at one time, as it is used by the Ministers of the
Gospel, it wounds the Souls of the Elect in order to healing, and it wounds the
Reprobate in order to damning, to such it may be called a killing Letter. To
one we are the Savor of Life unto Life, to the other the Savor of Death unto
Death. 2 Cor. 2.


VI. The Word of God has cut off many a Member of the old Man, it will cut
off a Right Hand lust, of Profit, or a Right-eye lust, of Pleasure.

VII. So some VVounds that many Sinners receive, are such, that there is no
cure for them, ( viz.) such who have sinned the unpardonable Sin. There is a
Sin unto death.

VIII. He that bears the Word of the Spirit, 1 John 5.
shows he is a Man that has great Authority for what he says, and that he is a
Person for Right and Justice; it is that which decides all doubtful Cases, etc.

IX. So the Word of God, the Sword of the Spirit, is a glorious and victorious
VVeapon, which will appear, If we consider how many it has struck down dead,
and sentenced unto eternal Death; how many strong Enemies have been slain and
subdued by it, strong Lusts, strong Devils, strong and vile Heretics; it is a
victorious Sword. It is called the Sword of the Spirit;

1. Because it is a spiritual Weapon, but that is not all.

2. Because the Spirit is the Author of it, a Weapon it is, (says Gurnal)
which his Hand alone formed and fashioned, Page 297.
it came not out of any Creatures Forge. Holy Men of God spoke as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost. 2 Pet. 2.21.


3. The Holy Spirit is the only true Interpreter of the Word, whence we have
that known Passage of Bernard; Quo Spiritu factae sunt Scripturae, eo Spiritu
legi desiderant, ipso etiam intelligendae. The Scriptures must be read, and can
be understood by no Spirit, but that a lone, by whom they were made.

4. Because the Spirit only can give the Word its Efficacy and Power in the
Soul; it is the Office of the Spirit, Sigillare animum rerum creditarum. Except
he lays his weight on the Truths we read, and hear, to apply them close, and as
it were cut their very Image in our Minds and Hearts, they have no more
Impression than a Seal sets upon a Stone or Rock. The Spirit will do nothing
for Believers without the Word, and they can do nothing to purpose without him,
the Word is the Sword, and the Holy Spirit of Christ the Arm that weilds it; So
that,

5. The like use that a Sword is of to a Soldier in War; the same is the Word
to the Spirit in order to the cutting down, and spoiling all his and others
Enemies.



Inferences.
THis may teach Believers, what excellent use the Word is of in all their
spiritual Wars with the Devil, Sin, and all other mortal Enemies of their Souls

2. It may inform us what the great Design of Satan is, in seeking so many
manner of ways to take away the Word of God from us, or in making of it of
little or no use to us.

3. This justly reprehends the cursed Papists and Church of Rome, in respect of
their Cruelty to the Souls of Men, in disarming them of their Weapons; a People
disarmed are soon overcome, and made a Prey to their Enemies; how can we defend
our selves when our Sword is taken out of our hands? They have some Fig Leaves
(says one) to hide their shameful Practice; they endeavor to persuade Men
they do them a Kindness thereby, lest they should cut their Fingers with it,
etc. How does the Apostle condemn speaking in the Church in an unknow Tongue?
All Men are exhorted to read the Scriptures, search the Scriptures, but the
Pope makes it no less than Death, if not Damnation, for the Laity to have them
in their own Language to read or search, fearing lest it should spoil his Trade.

4. It reproves them for casting such Contempt upon the Scriptures, as if they
were insufficient to direct us in the way of Salvation. What horrid Blasphemy
and Reproach is this (says the same Author) to the great God, to send his
People into the Field, and put such a wooden Sword into their hands, as is not
sufficient to defend themselves or vanquish their Enemies? And how much
contrary is it to that of the Apostle Timothy, who says, It is able to make us
wise unto Salvation, through Faith in Christ Jesus, perfect, thoroughly
furnished to all good Works. 2 Timothy 3.15, 17.


5. Let us bless God and be truly thankful, we have this Weapon left us yet,
this is in our hands, and that all the World may know it has done great things
in our Hearts. Let every true Christian and true Englishman resolve to die upon
the Spot, rather than lose the Word, or suffer their Sword to be taken from
them.

6. Let it also caution all Christians to take heed how they engage their Enemy
without their Sword.

7. Labor also to know the right use of it, and how, and when to offend your
Enemy hereby. Satan is a cunning Warrier: sometimes when thou art tempted to
sin, may be he will tell thee it is a little one, what is a merry Jest, to sport
and game, Romans 13.14. ^^ct 8.13. 1 Pet. Heb. 12.14
to drink and carrouze a little? when thou art thus beset draw thy Sword. Make
no Provision for the Flesh; If ye live after the Flesh, ye shall dye. Put off
the former Conversation: without Holiness no Man shall see God. How shall I do
this thing, and sin against God?

8. Again on the other hand, may be he will aggravate thy Sin, to drive thee
into despair, and tell thee by his evil suggestions, that there is no Mercy for
thee; Prove. 28.13 Ezekiel. 18.32. Mat. 12.13 1 Cor. 6.11
then draw thy Sword again. But he that confesses and forsakes his Sin, shall
find Mercy. I desire not the Death of him that dies. All manner of Sin and
Blasphemy against the Father and the Son shall be forgiven unto Men, etc. Such
were some of you, etc.

9. Yield up all your Sins tho never so pleasant and profitable, to the Edg of
the Sword.

10. Prize and highly value the Holy Scriptures, the Word of God, and say (as
David once did when he wanted a Sword, and it was told him there was none but
the Sword of Goliath) none like that. Satan will, it is feared, e're long, make
a diligent search for Arms; do as David did, hide thy Sword: Thy Word have I
hid in my Heart, that I might not sin against thee. Get many Promises ready
against thou art beset, Psalm. 119.9.
and shall have need of them.

The Word of God compared to Leaven.
Mat. 13.33. Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto Leaven, which a Woman
took and hid in three measures of Meal, till the whole was leavened.


SOme understand by Leaven in this place the Word of God, others Grace; the
one concludes it is the Word of Grace, the other the Grace of the Word; a
third sort understand the Church of God is intended by it.

The Word and Grace of God may be compared to Leaven in three or four
Considerations.

Parable.
LEaven is of a diffusive Quality, it infuses it self into every part, till the
whole Lump is leavened.

II. Leaven is of an assimilating Quality, it turns the Meal in which it is hid
into its own Nature.

III. The Woman took the Leaven and hid it in the Meal. Leaven must be hid,
that so it may leaven the Meal the better.

IV. Leaven secretly and invisibly works and alters the Meal, and makes a
Change therein, turning of it into Dough.

V. Leaven does not change the whole three measures of Meal all at once, but it
accomplishes its Work by degrees.

VI. A little Leaven will leaven the whole Lump. 1 Cor. 5.6. Gal. 5.9.

Parallel.
THe Word and Grace of God is of a diffusive nature, it will where it is
received in a spiritual sense, leavens every Faculty of the Soul, until the
whole Man, Body, and Spirit is leavened therewith. By three measures of Meal,
some understand the Body, Soul and Spirit to be meant.

II. The Word of God, where it is in Truth received (such is the assimilating
Nature thereof,) does convert by its powerful Operation the whole Soul into its
own Likeness, it changes the evil Quailties thereof, and works divine and
spiritual Qualities in the room of them, making a glorious and visible change
in the Heart and Life.

III. The Word of God must be received into the Heart, it must be hid as it
were there like Seed that is covered in the Earth, that so it may have its
blessed Effect in order to leaven the Soul in a spiritual Sense the better:
Psalm. 119.9
Thy Word have I hid in my Heart.

IV. So the Workings and Operations of God's Word are secret and invisible; our
Savior alludes to this, when he compares the Work of the Spirit in
Regeneration to the Wind, as is well observed, the Word and Spirit work
secretly, their Operations are invisible to the outward Eye.

V. So the Word and Grace of God, works not that blessed Change in the Soul all
at one instant; but Grace is carried on in Believers by degrees. I deny not,
but at the first Infusion of Grace or Act of Faith, a Man is really and
actually justified; yet the Work of Conversion, and Holiness is gradually
carried on, and may be a great while before it is perfected.

VI. So a small Quantity, or but a dram of true Grace will spiritually leaven
and change the whole Man; hence Grace in the beginning is compared to a Grain
of Mustard Seed.



Parable.
LEaven is taken in the Scripture in an evil sense for Hypocrisy, evil
Doctrine, Malice and Wickedness, from that sour Quality that is in it.

Disparity.
THe Word of God has no unpleasant or sowring Quality in it, but contrariwise
it is the only means through the Spirit to purge out that old Leaven, whether
it be evil Doctrine, Hypocrisy, Malice, or Wickedness, that sowreth and
corrupts the whole Man.

2. This may further inform us, touching the nature of the Word and Grace of
God. And from hence we may be able to make some Judgment, whether Conversion be
truly wrought in our Souls? or whether the Kingdom of God, (where Christ
spiritually rules, which is Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy
Spirit,) be in Truth begun in us or no?



The Word of God compared to Glass.
2 Cor. 3.18. Beholding as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord; and like unto a
Man, beholding his natural Face in a Glass.


BERNARD understands by Glass here, to be meant the Gospel, with diverse others;
and we see no cause to question this Exposition.

Simile.
A Glass is a Medium, that represents Persons and things unto the sight of our
external Eyes.

II. Some Glasses show us such things, that we cannot see, nor discern without
them (as common Experience shows,) which are called Perspective-Glasses.

III. A Glass seems to bring such things near to us that are at a great
distance. Some by looking in a Glass have discovered Things and Persons many
Miles of, as if they were just by them.

IV. A true Glass shows or represents unto a Man his own natural Face; by
looking therein he may see what manner of Man he is, he may take a plain view
of himself, whether fair or deformed.

V. A Glass is used by some as a thing to dress themselves in; by it they know
how to put on their Attire, and to deck themselves with all their Ornaments: if
any thing be wanting or amiss, which they would have on, they soon perceive it
by looking in a Glass.

VI. A Glass is a thing that some Persons take much Delight to look into.

VII. He that would have a full or plain sight of a Person or Persons that he
has a desire to behold in a Glass, must look therein with open Face, he must
not look asquint upon it.

VIII. A Man that beholds his natural Face in a Glass, and goes his way, soon
forgets what manner of Man he was; if he saw Spots, or Blemishes, or other
Deformity in his Face, or any uncomly Features, he soon forgets them.

IX. If a Man looks into a Glass, he sees there but the Image, Resemblance, or
Representation of a Person or a Thing, not the Person or the Thing it self.

Parallel.
THe Gospel is the best Medium which represents God the Father, the Lord Jesus
Christ, and holy Spirit, Angels and Saints, with things past, present, and to
come, to our spiritual Sight, or to the Eyes of our Faith.

II. The Word of God shows us such things and Mysteries, that without it we
could not see nor have the least Knowledge of; as the manner of the Creation of
the World in six Days; the cause why God sets his Bow in the Cloud; the
glorious Attributes of God, together with God's manner of being, or the
glorious Trinity; the Conception, Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection, and
Ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ; as also God's positive Law and instituted
Worship.

III. The Word and Gospel of God brings things that are afar off, very near; it
represents to our Faith the Judgment-Day, and shows us how matters and things
shall be managed then; who shall be cleared, and who condemned; it brings near
to the Eye of our Faith, the glorious Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and many things
of like Nature.

IV. So the Word of God shows forth, not only the Glory of God in the Face of
Jesus Christ, as also what this World is, what Sin is, etc. But it shows what
Man is before Grace, how wretched, blind, naked, deformed, polluted! and also
after Grace through Christ, how happy, adorned, beautiful and glorious!

V. So the Word of God is absolutely needful or necessary for all Christians to
look into, who would dress and deck themselves with the Ornaments of Grace,
that they may be comely in the sight of God. By looking into the Word they may
see what Ornaments are wanting, and how to put them on so as to be completely
dressed, and every way ready for the Bridegroom's coming.

VI. The Word of God is a thing that all true Christians take much Delight to
behold, daily pry and look into, by Reading and Meditation: His Delight is in
the Law of the Lord, Psalm. 1.2.
and in his Law he does meditate both Night and Day.

VII. So he that would have a clear sight of God in his glorious Attributes and
Perfections, must look into the Gospel with open Face; he must look with a full
and single Eye, as one that is resolved by the help of the Spirit, according to
the nature of his sight, to see what may be beheld therein; and not cast a
squint Look as it were upon it, seem to look toward God, when his Heart is
more upon other Things and Objects: We with open Face, etc. If thy Eye be
single, thy whole Body it full of Light.

VIII. So he that does cast but a transient Look into the Word of God, or is
but a bare Hearer thereof, may, whilst the Word is a preaching, see, or have
some sense of his Sin, and deplorable Condition he is in by Nature, and be
somewhat troubled for it a while; but not putting into practice what he hears,
but turning to his former Course again, he soon forgets what a deformed and
miserable Wretch he is, which is the principal Import of that Text in James.

IX. So a Christian that looks into the Word and Gospel to behold the Glory of
God, has but the sight of the Image, Resemblance, and Representation of God
shining therein before his Eyes.



Simile.
ONe Glass has not all the Properties which we have here mentioned.

II. Some Persons use too frequently to look into a Glass, as others do, to an
evil End, viz. to paint, patch, and spot their Faces, and to see their vain
Beauty, which tends to increase Pride, and foolishly to lift themselves up.

Disparity.
THe Gospel or Word of God is a spiritual Perspective-Glass, as well as a
Looking-Glass.

II. A Christian cannot look too often into God's Word, provided he do not
neglect his particular Calling in so doing, or let one Duty interfere with
another; neither does his looking into the Word of God tend to lift him up, but
rather to humble and abase him; for the more we see of God, the more with Job
and Isaiah, we shall abhor and be ashamed of our selves.

There are diverse other Disparities which we pass by; they are the Contrivance
and Workmanship of Man, and brittle things, etc. besides many of them are
false, giving not a true Representation of Persons and Things, etc.



Inferences.
LEt this teach every Soul the Folly of spending so much time in looking into a
carnal Glass to see their own Faces, and vainly to trim and deck their Heads
and Bodies, whilst they greatly neglect looking into this Glass, wherein the
Glory of God in a glorious manner may be seen. (See Metaphor Light.) And
thereby they may learn how to make themselves ready for Christ's Coming, as
also what their happy Condition is, if truly in Christ.

2. When you see a Glass, or enjoy the useful Benefit thereof, remember the
Glass of God's Word; and as you slight not, nor throw away that Glass by which
you obtain your End, viz. a Medium to behold what you desire; be persuaded
never to slight or throw away the Word of God, but improve it to the Ends for
which God gave it, till you come to have the Faculty so suited and fitted to
behold the Object, that you shall see as you are seen, and know as you are
known, which will be in a State of Glory, and not till then.

3. To inform the poor, dark, and blind World, that as a Glass of what nature
soever it be, yet it is altogether useless to a blind Man, till his Eyes are
opened; so till God opens blind Eyes, poor fallen Man cannot see any of the
Glory of God, nor understand this glorious Gospel or Word of God.

4. Let it persuade all Christians, (who do steadfastly believe that the Holy
Scriptures, or Word of God, are, or may be compared to a Glass in many of the
Particulars afore-going) to look more into it with earnest Prayer, that as it
is a Glass as clear as Crystal; so the Eyes of their Understandings may be
opened, to the end they may, as in a Glass, Behold the Glory of the Lord, and
be changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of
the Lord. 2 Cor. 3.18.

Professing the Gospel compared to the Plough.
Luke 9.26. He that puts his hand to the Plow, and looks back, is not fit for
the Kingdom of Heaven.


HE that puts his hand to the Plough, etc. Our Savior means, Preaching,
owning, or professing the Gospel.

The professing the Gospel may in diverse respects be compared to a Plough.

Methapor.
A Plough is an Instrument made fit for the Husbandman, to break up and till
his Ground.

II. The Plough cannot break up the Ground of it self; it must be held and
drawn, or nothing can be done by it.

III. It is a hard and difficult thing to plow up some Ground, especially that
which is rocky, full of Roots, or has long lain fallow.

IV. The Plough pierces deep into the Earth, makes (as it were) deep Gashes or
Wounds in the Heart of it, discovering what sort of Earth it is.

V. The Work of the Pluogh is but Opus ordinabile, a preparative Work in order
to sowing the Seed.

VI. It is best Plowing, when the Earth is prepared and mollified by the
Showers of Heaven, then the Work goes on sweetly.

VII. The Plough turns up by the Roots, and kills those rank Weeds that grow in
the Field.

VIII. That Field is not well plowed up, where the Plough jumps and skips over
some part of it, making Baulks; it must turn up all the whole Field alike.

IX. New Ground is much more easily plowed, than that which has lain a long
time untilled.

X. In the last place, and more directly to the main Drift and Scope of the
Text, the Plough must be held throughout the whole Journey; a Man must not put
his hand to it, and presently grow weary, and look back.

Parallel.
THe Gospel is an Instrument, prepared and made fit by the Almighty, to break
or plow up the fallow Ground of our Hearts. Jer. 43. Hos. 10.12


II. The Gospel must be believed and professed by us; we must lay our hand to
it, and by the Power of the Spirit it must (as it were) be drawn upon our
Hearts, or it can do nothing.

III. So it is a very difficult thing to convince and humble the hard and
obdurate Heart of a Sinner, which is compared to a Stone, and as firm as a
Rock: Ezekiel. 36.26. Amos 6.12
Shall Horses run upon the Rocks? Will one plow there with Oxen?

IV. The Gospel pierces the Heart of a Sinner by powerful Convictions: Acts
2.37.
When they heard this, they were pricked ((...), punctim cedo, pungendo
penetro, or pierced point-black,) to the Heart. Then the Word divided (as it
were) between the Soul and Spirit, laid the Heart open, made a discovery of
what was hid within.

V. So the Gospel and Word of God (as a Plough) by its powerful Convictions
upon the Conscience, is but a preparative Work, Hos. 10.12, 13.
in order to the sowing the Seed of Grace in the Heart.

VI. Never does the Word of God so kindly work in plowing up the fallow Ground
of the Heart, as when the Gospel-Clouds dissolve, and the true Grace and Love
of Jesus Christ comes sweetly showering down upon it.

VII. So the Word of God, by its powerful Convictions and Operations upon the
Heart, kills Sin at the Root, causing the Soul to loath what it formerly loved.

VIII. That Heart is not savingly wrought upon, where one Lust is spared, and
left untouched, or when it reaches not to the changing the evil Qualities of
every Faculty. The Word must no^^ reach the Conscience only, but the Judgment,
Will, and Affections also.

IX. So Youth, before evil Habits, or a Custom and Course of Sin, be taken, and
more abundantly cleave to them, are (as it is found by experience) sooner
wrought upon by the Word of God, than old Sinners, when Sin has got Root in
their Hearts.

X. So the Gospel, and the Profession thereof, must be held, owned,
acknowledged, and professed, in Truth, and in Uprightness of Heart, constantly,
to the end, even through the whole Journey, Length, and Race of our Lives; we
must not grow weary, Gal. 6.9.
nor faint in our Minds. He that sets his hand to the Plough, (i. e. professes
the Gospel) and looks back, is not fit for the Kingdom of Heaven.



Inferences.
THis may convince all Persons, what need there is of the Spirit to join in,
and work with the Word: For our Gospel came not to you in Word only, but also
in Power, 1 Thessalonians. 1.5
and in the Holy Ghost, and in much Assurance.

2. See that your whole Soul is wrought upon, that there is a Work upon every
Faculty thereof.

3. Take heed of a long continuance in a Course of Sin. Let the old Sinner
tremble, but if wrought upon in his old Age, admire the infinite Grace of God.

4. From hence you may perceive the hardening Nature of Sin.

5. Tremble at the Thoughts of Apostasy, and take heed you do not shrink your
hands off in the Day of Trial, or refuse to plow, because it is cold, or
because the Sun shines hot, etc.

Mr. John Flavel's Poem upon the Plough.
There Is Skill in Plowing; that the Plowman, knows:
For if too shallow, or too deep he goes,
The Seed is either buried, or else may
To Crows and Rooks become an easy Prey.
This, as a lively Emblem, fitly may
Describe the Blessed Spirit's Work and Way,
Whose Work on Souls with this does symbolize;
Betwixt them both thus the Resemblance lies:
Souls are the Soil, the Gospel is the Plow;
God's Workmen hold, the Spirit shows them how.
The Spirit draws, and in good Ground does bless
His Workmens Pains with sweet and fair Success.
In Hearts prepared God scatters in the Seed,
Which in its season springs. No Fowl or Weed
Shall pick it up, or choke this springing Corn,
Till it be housed in the heavenly Barn.
When thus the Word plows up the fallow Ground,
When with such Fruits his Servants Work is crowned,
Let all the Friends of Christ, and Souls say now,
As they pass by these Fields, God speed the Plow.
The Word of God compared to Seed.
Mat. 13. The Seed is the Word of God.


METAPHOR.
GOod Seed is prepared by the Husbandman, and is reserved out of the choicest
Wheat, and principal Barley; it is that which the Husbandman highly esteems and
values.

II. The Ground, before the Seed is sown, is plowed up, and made fit to receive
the Seed.

III. The Husbandman either sows the Seed himself, or employs a Seedsman to sow
it, one that has Skill in that Employment.

IV. When Seed is cast into the Earth, it must be covered, or else the Birds
may pick it up; besides, it will not otherwise so well take Root.

V. Seed lies some time in the Ground, before it springs up; Clods also
oftentimes hinder it from springing up.

VI. Frost and Snow conduce very much to the well-rooting of the Seed; they
tend also to kill the Weeds, which otherwise might choke it under the Clods: by
which means it roots, spreads, and flourishes more abundantly.

VII. The earlier Seed is sown, the better it is rooted, and enabled to endure
the Sharpness of the Winter.

VIII. Some Seeds which the Sower sows fall upon stony Places, and some on
thorny Ground, (as Experience shows) which Seed brings not forth Fruit unto
perfection; and some also falls by the High-way-side, which the Birds devour.

IX. Fruitfulness of Seed depends much upon the Sun shining, and the Rain
falling upon it; by this means it is quickened, and abundantly springs up.

X. Weeds many times come up with the Seed, and if they are not plucked up, or
weeded out, they will hinder the Growth of the Seed, if not quite choke it.

XI. The good Ground only brings forth Fruit unto perfection.

XII. Men are very diligent and industrious in sowing their Seed, they are up
early, and labor hard, morning and evening.

XIII. Winds and Storms do not prevent Sowers in the sowing of their Seed; but
let the Wind be high or low, blow from the North, or from the South, yet they
do and will sow.

XIV. Men usually are not sparing of their Seed, but scatter it abroad so
plentifully, that all and every part of the Field which they intend to sow, may
be sown therewith.

Parallel.
THe Word of God is a choice and precious thing, and that which God highly
values and accounts of: Psalm. 138.^^
He has magnified his Word above all his Name. Thy Word it very pure. Psalm.
119.


II. Our Hearts are naturally hard, and have need to be plowed up, which is
also done by the Word, and Conviction of the Spirit; hence the Gospel is called
a Plow. See Plow.

III. Jesus Christ is the spiritual Seeds-Man; it is he that sows the Seed, who
wants neither Care nor Skill to do it: The Sower is the Son of Man.

IV. So the Word of God ought to be hid or covered in our Hearts, Mat. 13.37
that Satan may not steal it away from us, and that it may take good Root
downward, and bring forth Fruit upward. Psalm. 119.9
David hid the Word of God in his Heart. It is not enough to have it in our
Heads, but in our Hearts: Let the Word of God dwell in you richly. We ought to
labor to understand it, to love it, Col. 3.16.
and keep it in our Memories, yea, and to let it be well rooted in every
Faculty.

V. The Word of God does often (like Seed) lie hid for a while in the Heart of
a Sinner, before it eminently shows it self. Clods of Corruption, and
Temptations, hinder its Growth and springing up.

VI. So Affliction (when sanctified to gracious Persons, which they meet with
after their Conversion, and many times in their very Seed-Time) tends to kill
the Weeds of Corruption, and breaks and mollifies the Heart, by which means
they come to be better rooted in Grace, and strengthened in Holiness.

VII. So when the Word of God is early received in the Love of it, (when a
young Person is sanctified in the Bud) Grace many times flourishes more
abundantly. Such have treat Advantage above others. Long Experience tends much
to the strengthening of Grace, enabling the Soul to hold out in an evil Day. It
was a great Advantage to Timothy, 1 Timothy 3.
that he knew the Holy Scriptures from a Child.

VIII. The Seed of God's Word, which the Son of Man by his faithful Ministers
sows in the Ministration of the Gospel, falls oftentimes upon a hard and
rocky-hearted Sinner, who tho he receive the Word with much seeming Joy, Mat.
13.2^^
yet in time of Persecution falls away: Because of the Word be is offended.
Others, like thorny Ground, receive the Seed; but the Cares of this World, and
the Deceitfulness of Riches, choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful. The
other hear the Word, and understand it not; then comes the Devil, (called the
Fowl of the Air) and catches away that which was sown in the Heart: This is he
that receives Seed by the High-way-side.

IX. So the Fruitfulness of the Word in Men's Hearts, depends upon Christ's
gracious blessing, and shining upon it, and the Spirits bedewing and watering
it: It Is God that gives the Increase. 1 Cor. 3.6


X. So when the Word of God is received in truth into the Heart, Sin and
Corruption will, Mat. 13.
if not carefully weeded out, spring up, and hinder the Growth of the spiritual
Seed. Hence the Apostle gives charge to the Saints, That they should look
diligently, lest any fail of the Grace of God; Heb. 12.5.
lest any Root of Bitterness spring up, and trouble them.

XI. So none but honest and sincere Christians stand in the Day of Trial, and
bring forth Fruit unto Eternal Life. Mat. 13.23


XII. So such as God has sent to preach his Word, do diligently attend their
Ministry, early and late, in season and out of season, 1 Cor. 15.58.
as knowing that their Labor shall not be in vain in the Lord.

XIII. Even so has the Seed of the Word been sown in all Ages, notwithstanding
the Storms have beaten, and the Wind of Persecution has blown very roughly,
sometimes one way, and sometimes another; yet this has not in the least
prevented the sowing of the spiritual Seed of the Word.

XIV. How plentifully has the Word of God been preached in England, and in
other Countries? and how plentifully was this spiritual Seed dispersed by the
Apostles and Servants of Christ: They went every where preaching the Word.
Which is come unto you, Col. 1, 6.
as it is in all the World, and brings forth Fruit, as it does also in you,
since the day ye heard of it, and knew the Grace of God in truth.



METAPHOR.
SOme Men, either through want of Judgment, or to save Charge, sow bad Seed,
such as will not bear much Fruit, although the Ground whereon it is sown be
never so good.

II. No Seed that Men sow can be at all fruitful, or yield increase, except the
Plow go before to break up the Ground, which the Seed cannot do of it self by
any Art of Man.

III. Many Men have sowed good Seed, and that upon good Ground, and it has
taken Root, and flourished, and yet by some Accident or other, they have had a
bad Harvest, brought but little Corn into the Barn, Hag. 1.6, 9
or sometimes none at all.

IV. The Seed which Men sow is not quickened, 1 Cor. 15.36.
except it die.

Disparity.
But the Seed of the Word of God is good Seed, and was never sown into good
Ground, (that is, a good and honest Heart) but it took Root, and became
fruitful, as all true Believers have experienced.

II. But the Word of God, through the mighty Operation of the Spirit, is not
only Seed, but also the spiritual Plow, by which the fallow Ground of the Heart
is broken up, and made fit for it self to sink into, and take deep Root there.

III. But never was the Seed of God's Word sown in a good and honest Heart,
taking Root there, and flourishing, but a blessed Harvest always followed; nay,
tho they sow in Tears, they shall reap in Joy: He that goes forth, and
weepeth, Psalm. 126.5, 6.
bearing precious Seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his
Sheaves with him.

IV. But the Word of the Lord dies not, but lives and abides for ever: The
Words that I speak unto you, Joh. 6.63.
they are Spirit, and they are Life.



Inferences.
IT may inform us, that the Cause why some Persons fall away, and turn with the
Dog to his Vomit, and with the Sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the
Mire, is, Because they were never sincere, nor upright in Heart. The honest and
upright Soul falls not away, cannot fall so as never to rise again, but brings
forth Fruit to everlasting Life, (as our Savior clearly shows.)

II. O then let Men and Women take heed to their own Hearts, and see whether
they were ever thoroughly broken in the sight and sense of their Sin. The Word
and Gospel must first be as a Plow unto them, to break up the stony and fallow
Ground of their Hearts, before (like Seed) the Word can be received by them.

III. Remember, that notwithstanding a poor Soul may meet with many Storms, and
go through much Difficulty and Trouble, both within and without, rise early,
and lie down late, (whilst he keeps his Hand on the Lord's Plow, in this
Seeds-Time of the Word) yet the Harvest will make amends for all: You that have
sowed in Tears, shall reap with Joy. Nay, the Day is at hand, wherein both the
Sower and the Reaper shall rejoice together.

The Word of God compared to Rain.
Deuteronomy. 32.2. My Doctrine shall drop as the Rain, etc.


Simile.
RAin is the immediate and proper Work of God; He gives us Rain from Heaven,
and fruitful Seasons. Are there among the Vanities of the Gentiles they that
can cause Rain? Jer. 14 22.
Or can the Heavens give Showers? art not thou he, O Lord?

II. Rain falls by divine Direction and Appointment; God causes it to rain upon
one City, Amos 4.7.
and not upon another. You often see a Cloud dissolve and spend it self upon
one place, when there is not a drop within a few Miles of it; one Land may have
Rain and a fruitful Season, when another may have none.

III. There is a great deal of difference in the Showers of Rain that fall upon
the Earth, sometimes you have it in small Drops; a drisling Rain which comes
gently, but continuing long, it waters the Earth and the Fruits thereof
thoroughly, going to the very Root; at other times it comes down in a hasty and
violent manner, causing the Streams to run, but it is gone presently, and does
but little good.

IV. Some People in the World have no Rain, as the Egyptians, for it is said,
that it seldom or never rains there.

V. Rain comes down successively and gradually, now a little and then a little;
it does not fall all at one time, before it gives over, but it comes now a
Shower and then a Shower, as the Earth and Fruits thereof need it.

VI. The Rain comes down (as is noted of Dew) irresistibly; when God does by
his Word of Command, speak to the Clouds to distill it down upon the Earth, it
is not in the power of all Creatures to hinder its falling.

VII. Rain is most beneficial to the Earth, when there comes sweet, warm Rays
of the Sun with it, or as clear shining after it, then Herbs, Flowers, and
Corn, as also other Fruits, grow abundantly.

VIII. Rain is necessary at Seed-time, to make the Earth ready and fit to
receive the Seed; Thou visitest the Earth, and waterest it; thou greatly
enrichest it with the River of God, Isa. 30.23.
which is full of Water: Thou preparest them Corn. Thou waterest the Ridges
abundantly, thou setlest the Furrows thereof; Psalm. 65.9, 10.
thou make it soft with Showers, thou blessest the springing thereof, thy
Paths drop Fatness. This is called the former Rain, and as it is necessary at
or about Seed-time, so also it is needful at earing-time, to ripen the Corn,
and to bring it to Perfection; both these are needful to produce a good
Harvest, both the former and latter Rain.

IX. Rain makes the Earth soft and tender, which otherwise would be very hard
and dry, and unfruitful, as we see in time, of great Drought.

X. After much Rain, sometimes comes a great Drought.

XI. Clouds let down the Rain upon the Earth; God makes use of them as Vessels
to retain the Water, and that also at his Pleasure, they may let it out, and
distill it down upon the Earth.

XII. Rain has been sent down from Heaven as the Answer of Prayer; Prayer has
as it were opened the Windows of Heaven, that it might rain upon the Earth.

XIII. Rain comes down from Heaven, and returns not thither, without
answering the end for which it is sent.

Parallel.
THe Word of God, and the Blessings that attend it, are all from God, it is he
that makes the Divine Rain to fall upon Men's Souls; you are not to look upon
those Truths that Ministers dispense as the meet Effects, and Fruits of their
Inventions and Parts: He is the Minister of God, etc. the Office is from
Heaven, the Doctrine he preaches is from Heaven, the Efficacy and Success of it
is from Heaven: What I received of the Lord, 1 Cor. 11.23.
I delivered also unto you.

II. So the Word of God is sent to one People and not to another, to one
Kingdom and not to another: what glorious Influences of the Gospel has God
sent to this Land; and what a Drought and Scarcity it is there of it in many
others not far off? and what precious Showers have some Places had in England
beyond what others enjoy? To you is the Word of this Salvation sent: Act. 13.26
it comes not by chance, but by Commission and the special Command of God.

III. The Word of God in like manner sometimes comes down moderately, yet
continuing long before God takes it away from a People or Soul, at length it
proves effectual, and thoroughly waters and soaks their barren Hearts, and makes
them fruitful; but at another time, the Word in a Sermon, comes like a sudden
Spout of Rain, seeming to carry all before it, and startles the Sinner, but
it is soon over, and does but little good, it abiding not upon the Conscience.

IV. So there are some People, nay, many in the World, that never had the
Gospel preached as yet to them.

V. So the Word drops and distills like Rain and Showers that water the Earth,
now a little and then a little, as the Condition of the Soul requires; a drop
in this Sermon, and a drop in another Sermon; Precept must be upon Precept,
Line upon Line, here a little and there a little: Isa. 28.10.
now one comforting Influence and then another; now one quickening Impulsion and
then another, now one Promise is rained down and then another. 1. Christ would
that his People have a constant Dependence on himself. 2. He would have them
wait upon every Sermon, upon every Ordinance and Opportunity. 3. He would not
have them surfeit upon his Word, therefore he observes a successive
Distillation of the Blessings thereof upon them. 4. He would have every
Doctrine, and Precepts, and Promises soak into their Hearts. 5. Christ would
indear every drop of his Grace, and morsel of his Word to his People; he would
have them lose nothing he bestows, and therefore gives it them as they are able
to receive it. 6. The Souls of Believers are like narrow-mouthed Vessels, they
cannot receive much at a time without spilling. 7. We are such bad Husbands,
Christ will not trust us with all at once.

VI. The Word falls upon Sinners. When God gives Command with mighty Power, the
Influences of the Word and Spirit work with mighty Efficacy upon the Heart; the
Word is quick and powerful, it breaks the Heart in pieces; in Conviction it
causes the Sinner to cry out, Lord, what will thou have me do? it shall
accomplish that for which 'twas sent. See Light.

VII. So it is in respect of the Gospel, when the Sun of Righteousness shines
upon the Soul, under the Word and blessed Doctrine thereof, O this makes a
Believer, and all his Graces to flourish exceedingly!

VIII. The Gospel has a twofold Use and Benefit, it is necessary as the former
Rain at the beginning or first working of Grace upon the Heart; so it is needful
afterward, to ripen and prepare the Soul for Heaven. Be glad then ye Children
of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God, for he has given you the former
Rain moderately; and he will cause the Rain to come down, the former Rain and
latter Rain, etc. We cannot be without either; we shall soon decay in our
Spirits, if we have not spiritual Moisture of the Grace and Word of God upon
our Souls: the Ministry of the Word is not only appointed to implant Grace in
us, but also to perfect Grace so rooted and implanted.

IX. So the Word of God makes the hard and flinty Hearts of Sinners very soft
and tender; it is of a mollifying, fructifying Nature, it makes the Saints
fruitful in Grace and Good-works.

X. So after great plenty of divine and spiritual Rain, when People are glutted
with a Fullness of Gospel-Mercies, God sometimes sends a Drought, shuts up
Heaven. Ministers are like Clouds without Rain.

XI. Ministers are the spiritual Clouds that God has appointed to retain the
Word and saving Knowledge of divine Things, so that they may also at his Command
let the Water of Life down, or distill it upon Men's Souls. See Clouds.

XII. Divine Rain has been sent down as the Answer of fervent Prayer; The
Prayer of the Godly has prevailed with the Almighty, for sending of the Word
and Spirit down upon the World, and Church of God: hence Paul earnestly begs
the Saints Prayers, That he might open his Mouth boldly, Ephesians. 6.19. 2 These. 3.1.
to make known the Mystery of the Gospel.

XIII. So, says the Lord, shall my Word be that goes out of my Mouth, it
shall not return unto me void, Isa. 55.10, 11.
but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing
whereto I sent it.



Simile.
RAin is not necessary at all times; there are Seasons when the Husbandman
craves none: he is sometimes afraid of a Shower, and prays for fair Weather;
Rain in Harvest is not welcome.

II. Rain is no distinguishing Argument between good and bad Men; it falls
promiscuously upon the Righteous and the Wicked; for tho it does not fall every
where, in every City and Place, yet where it comes, it usually falls alike.

Disparity.
THe Word of God is necessary at all times: Preach the Word, be instant in
Season and out of Season: There is indeed no time, but this divine Rain is
needful, and we cannot say we want it not, for we cannot be without it one day.

II. But the Word of God and Blessings thereof, are a distinguishing sign of
God's special Favor: the peculiar drops of divine Grace are not communicated
to all alike, tho all may have the Word preached to them: My Word (says
Christ) has no abiding in you.



Inferences.
PRay that the Divine Clouds may be filled with Spiritual Rain.

2. And know from hence the necessity of the Word, that there is as much need
of the Word, for the Growth and Comfort of the Soul, as there is of Rain for
the Growth of the Fruits of the Earth.

3. How blind are they who are offended at the Doctrine of the Gospel?

4. Has the Word, like Rain or Dew fallen upon your Souls? Consider the
Effects of Rain, and examine your selves thereby.

5. When ye see it rain upon the Earth, think upon the Word and Doctrine of the
Gospel with secret Groans and Desires of Heart, that your Souls may be made
fruitful by it.

6. And lastly, Take heed you do not provoke God to shut up Heaven, that there
be no more Rain. God can make spiritual Clouds empty, or scatter them in a way
of Judgment; now your Eyes behold your Teachers, 2 Chronicles. 7*
and they seem like Clouds filled with Water; but he can soon cause them to be
driven into Corners, as a Punishment of your Sins, or make them like Clouds
without Rain, that so you may know what it is to abuse the spiritual Plenty you
have so long enjoyed, by feeling Want and Scarcity, that may be over all the
Land: Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will send a Famine in the
Land; not a Famine of Bread, nor a thirst for Water, Amos 8.11.
but of hearing the Word of the Lord.

The Word of God compared to the Dew of Heaven.
Deuteronomy. 32.2. My Doctrine shall drop as the Rain, my Speech shall distill as Dew,
etc.


METAPHOR.
DEw falls insensibly and invisibly; you may be in the Field all night, and not
perceive the Dew fall, and yet find great Dew upon the Grass.

II. As Dew comes down undiscernibly, and invisibly, so also very sweetly, and
in a mild manner.

III. Dew is of a fructifying Nature; for falling especially on Herbs and
tender Plants, it soaks into the Roots of them, and makes them fruitful.

IV. Dew comes down irresistibly; who can stop or hinder the Dew from falling
on the Earth?

V. Dew does usually fall in the Night.

Parallel.
SO the Operations and Blessings of the Word, and Graces thereof, are
invisible; we feel the Work, but the manner of the working thereof is unknown
to us. No Man can see the Conversion of of another, (says an eminent Minister)
nor can well discern his own. Dr. Sibha.
The Word works by little, and little like as the Dew falls.

II. So the Gospel comes upon some Men in a sweet and mild manner; it distills
as it were upon them like Dew, although on others ('it is true) the Word comes like
a mighty and fierce Rain. See Rain.


III. So the Word of God causes the Soul to grow in Grace, it makes the
precious Plants of God's Vineyard to be green, and flourish in all the Fruits
of the Spirit. The Saints at Thessalonica, after they received the Word, 2 Thessalonians. 1.3. Hos. 14.5.
their Faith grew exceedingly. I will be as the Dew unto Israel, and he shall
grow as the Lilly.

IV. Who can hinder or stop the Word from operating upon the Sinner's Heart? If
God will work, who shall let? My Word shall not return to me in vain, it shall
accomplish that for which I sent it. Isa. 55.11.


V. So the Word only comes upon Men's Hearts like Dew, whilst the Night of this
World continues. In the State of Glory, the perfect Day, this Dew will fall no
more; no more Preaching, nor Means of Grace will then be afforded to Sinners,
neither will Saints have need of it: For when that which is perfect is come,
then (and not till then) will that which is in part be done away. Romans 13.




METAPHOR.
DEw is not sufficient to water some Ground, nor to make the new-mown Grass to
spring and grow; that needs a plentiful Rain.

Disparity.
THe Word of God is not only a Dew, that sweetly waters and refreshes the
tender Herbs; but also it is sufficient to soak and well water the driest
Ground: hence it is compared to Rain, as you heard before.



The Gospel compared to Treasure.
2 Cor. 4.7. But we have this Treasure in earthen Vessels, etc.


WE shall first show, that the Word and Gospel of Christ is a Treasure, yea,
most choice Treasure, tho it be never so much slighted by wicked Men.

Secondly, we shall run the Parallel, etc.

Arg. 1. That which is set forth by the choicest and rarest things in the whole
World, must needs be a Treasure: But the Gospel is set forth by the choicest
and rarest things, as Gold, Silver, precious Stones, etc. therefore the Gospel
is a Treasure.

Arg. 2. That which is of such value, that its Worth cannot be known or
computed, must needs be a Treasure: But the Gospel is invaluable, Ergo, etc.

Arg. 3. That by which the Grace and Love of God is communicated, must needs be
a Treasure, or that which is of great worth: But the Gospel is that by which
the Grace and Love of God in Christ is communicated; Ergo, etc.

Arg. 4. That which the best, wisest, and holiest Men have esteemed and prized
above all earthly and worldly Things, must needs be a Treasure: But such have
so prized the Gospel, and Word of God; Ergo. Psalm. 119.14, 127. Job 23.12.

Arg. 5. That which good and holy Men have died for, rather than to part with,
must needs be a Treasure, or that which is of great worth: But holy Men have
rather chosen Death, than to deny or part with the Gospel; Ergo. Phil. 1.7.
Heb. 10.29. and 11.26. Acts 20.24.

Arg. 6. That which enriches all that really partake of it, or enjoy it, must
needs be a Treasure: But the Gospel does so; Romans 11.12. Ergo, etc.

METAPHOR.
RAre or excellent Treasure is more in quality than quantity, more in Worth
than Show.

II. Treasure enricheth those that have it.

III. Treasure has a great Influence upon the Hearts of the Sons of Men.

IV. Treasure is much sought after, with great Care and Pains; and when
obtained, Men are very loath to part with it.

V. Treasure is usually kept in some strong or secure place, to the end it may
be safely preserved.

VI. Treasure sometimes signifies Store and Plenty of good Things. Prove. 15^^


VII. Much Treasure makes Men great and honorable in the World.

VII. Treasure will carry a Man a great way, in and through great Straits,
Afflictions, Sorrows, and Sufferings.

Parallel.
THe Gospel is much in little; it has been of that Esteem, that in the time of
its scarcity, a Load of Hay has been given for one Leaf of the Epistle of
James in English. See the Word of God compared to Light.

II. So does the Gospel. How many poor, miserable, wretched Men and Women have
not only been supplied, (as to their need) but enriched thereby?

III. So has the Gospel, through the Spirit; and therefore the Lip of Truth
says, Where the Treasure is, there will the Heart be also. Mat. 6.21.


IV. What Pains did the holy Men of old use, in seeking after a Discovery of
the Truth of the Gospel, and of the things therein contained! And what a Cloud
of Witnesses are there, who rather than they would part with this Treasure,
parted with their Lives, and all they had.

V. So the Word and Gospel of God has been preserved in the worst of Times,
when the great Design of Men and Devils has been to destroy or corrupt it: Thy
Word have I hid in mine Heart. Psalm. 119.11.


VI. There are Store of good Things held forth in the Gospel, viz. Christ,
Grace, Glory, and every good Thing else, with him, and by him.

VII. Faith in the Gospel raises to great Honor. O what Dignity arises from
that noble Birth that is from above! until which, how mean and disgraceful an
Object is fallen Man!

VII. So the Gospel, and the Grace of it, O how far, and through what
Difficulties will it carry a Man! With what contentment have Christians behaved
themselves in the want of all outward Enjoyments, having had a little of this
Treasure!



METAPHOR.
ALL Treasures here, be they never so rich or rare, yet they are but earthly,
or from the Earth.

II. Earthly Treasures are corruptible, and many times are spoiled; they become
worth little or nothing. Lay not up Treasure on Earth, Mat. 6.20.
where Moth and Rust does corrupt, etc.

III. Earthly Treasures, tho they may go far, and supply many bodily Wants, yet
they cannot supply Soul-Wants.

IV. The Poor have but little of worldly Treasure, and therefore it is they are
accounted poor; it is mostly in the hands of the great Men of the Earth.

V. Men by their natural Care and Industry may get worldly Treasure, and grow
rich thereby.

VI. Worldly Treasure may be taken away by Thieves, as well as eaten by Moths.

Disparity.
BUt such is the Glory of the Gospel, as that it is a Treasure from Heaven, and
of an heavenly product and extract.

II. But the Gospel, and Grace thereof, is a Treasure incorruptible, it cannot
putrify, or be spoiled; its Splendour and Glory is durable: But of
incorruptible, -- the Word of God, etc. 1 Pet. 1, 23


III. But the Gospel, or Word of God, extends to the Supply both of the Soul
and Body. The Gospel heard and received by Faith, makes up a full Supply to the
Soul of whatever it needs: My God shall supply all your Wants, etc. Phil. 4.19.


IV. But it is evident, that the Poor receive the Gospel; and James says
expressly, Jam. 25.
that God has chosen the Poor of this World, rich in Faith, etc. The Poor of
this World have generally most of this sacred Treasure, and so are the richest
Men.

V. No Man whatsoever, tho never so worldly wise, ingenious, careful, and
industrious, in laying out all his natural Parts, can enrich himself with this
sacred Treasure: What have thou which thou have not received?

VI. But the Gospel is a Treasure that cannot be taken away by Thieves, nor can
the Moth corrupt it; it is called the everlasting Gospel. Luke 12 33 Rev. 14 6.




Inferences.
THis shows who are the truly rich Men and Women in the World, and what is
indeed the true Treasure, that will make them so here, and to Eternity, Jam.
2.5. 2 Cor. 6.10.

II. It shows the Folly and Madness of those that slight and despise the
Gospel, Heb. 2, 2, 3. Jer. 8.8, 9.

III. What strong Motives might I produce in order to the getting of this
Treasure?

1. Would you be rich for ever, would you have durable Riches? etc.

2. Would you be defended, and know how to subsist another Day? Then get much
of this Treasure?

Quest. But is not this the way to be in the more danger? For it is not the Poor
that the Thief cares to meddle withal, but the Rich: We see what Assaults they
meet withal that have this Treasure, therefore it is best to be at ease and
quiet, and forbear to middle with it?

Answ. God's Power and Strength is laid out for its Preservation, and of the
Vessels in whom it is. It is God's Treasure, and the Vessel too, for his People
are his peculiar Treasure: He will keep it night and day, lest any hurt it;
meaning his People, Isa. 27.3.
whom he has enriched with this Treasure.

Quest. But why is this Treasure put into such earthen Vessels? Is it not in
the greater danger therefore to be lost, they being so subject to be broken?

Answ. 1. They are (tho mean in the Worlds eye, and also in their own, yet)
chosen and sanctified Vessels, and fitted for the Lord's use; so that the
Treasure can suffer no loss by the Vessel.

2. The Power of God is the more manifested, in preserving this Treasure in an
earthen Vessel.

Object. But these Vessels may be, nay, have been, and are often broken, and
turned to Dust.

Answ. Yet God never wanted a Vessel for this Treasure; nay, those that are
turned to Dust are not destroyed; they are but dissolved, that the Treasure
might be the more diffusive, and spread it self. 2 Cor. 4.8, 9, 10, 11. 1 Cor.
6.14
The Blood of the Saints has been the Seed of the Church.

FINIS.
ADVERTISEMENT.
THere is a second Volume ready for the Press, which consists of two Parts.

The First opens, by way of Metaphor and Parallel, etc. about One hundred sixty
eight Metaphors, Similes, Allegories, and other borrowed Terms, contained in
the holy Scriptures, consisting of all the principal Metaphors, Similes, etc.
that the Authors can meet with, under these ten Heads following.

1. Such as concern the Graces of the Spirit, and Ordinances of the Gospel. 2.
Such as concern the holy Angels, and the Souls or Spirits of Men. 3. Such as
respect the Church of God. 4. Such as concern, (1.) Man in general, (2.) Good
Men, (3.) Wicked Men. 5. Such as concern the Ministers of the Gospel. 6. Such
as respect Sin, wherein the odious Nature of Sin is largely opened. 7. Such as
concern the Devil. 8. Such as concern the false Church, and false Teachers.
Under which Head is most evidently showed, that the Church of Rome is
absolutely meant by the great Whore, Rev. 17. and the Papists Objections
answered; which was expected in this Volume, but could not be put in without
palpable Injury to both, by confounding the Heads, etc. 9. Such as concern
Affliction and Providence. 10. Of the Life of Man, and the four last Things.
The Second Part elegantly opens and explains most of all the Types, and many
Parables in the Holy Scripture; a Work much desired.

Both Parts will contain upwards of a Hundred Sheets, and will be printed by
Subscriptions, viz. Four Shillings down, and four more when the Books are
delivered in Quires; and those that subscribe for Six (as the usual way is)
shall have one gratis, etc.

Had not the Authors found it impossible to contract the Work so, as to bring
the whole into the Compass of One Hundred and Fifty Sheets, they would have
handled some Things more concisely.
