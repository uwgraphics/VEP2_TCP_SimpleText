THE MISTRESS, OR SEVERAL COPIES OF LOVE-VERSES.

Written by Mr. A. Cowley, In his Youth, and now since his Death thought fit to
be published.

-- Haeret lateri lethalis arundo.
LONDON, Printed for Rowland Reynolds at the Sun and Bible in Postern-Street
near More-Gate, 1667.

To the Reader.
A Correct Copy of these verses and (as I am told) written by the Author
himself, falling into my hands, I thought fit to send to the Press; chiefly
because I hear that the same is like to be done from a more imperfect one. It
is not my good fortune to be acquainted with the Author any further then his
fame (by which he is well known to all Englishmen) and to that I am sure I
shall do a service by this Publication: Not doubting but that, if these verses
please his Mistress but half so well, as they will generally do the rest the
world, he will be so well contented, as to forgive at least this my
boldness, which proceeds only from my Love of Him, who will gain
reputation, and of my Country, which will receive delight from it. I shall use
no more preface, nor (...) one word (besides these few lines) to the Book; but
faithfully and nakedly transmit it to thy view, just as it came to mine,
unless perhaps some Typographicall faults get into it, which I will take care
shall be as few as may be, and desire a pardon for them if there be any.

Farewell.
THE MISTRESS, OR SEVERAL COPIES OF LOVE VERSES.
The Request.
1.
I 'Have often wished to love; what shall I do?
Me still the cruel Boy does spare;
And a double task must bear,
First to woo him, and then a Mistress too,
Come at last and strike for shame;
If thou art any thing besides a name.
I Will think Thee else no God to be;
But Poets rather Gods, who first created Thee.
2.
I ask not one in whom all beauties flow,
Let me but love, what ere she be,
She cannot seem deformed to me;
And I would have her seem to others so.
Desire takes wings and strait does fly,
It stays not dully to inquire the why
When I Am that thing a Lover grown.
I shall not see with others Eyes, scarce with mine own.
3.
If she be coy and scorn my noble fire,
If her chill heart I cannot move,
Why I Will enjoy the very Love,
And make a Mistress of mine own Desire.
Flames their most vigorous heat do hold,
And purest light, if compast round with cold:
So when sharp Winter means most harm,
The spring Plants are by the Snow it self kept warm.
4.
But do not touch my heart, and so be gone;
Strike deep thy burning arrows in:
Lukewarmnesse I account a sin
As great in Love, as in Religion.
Come armed with flames, for I would prove
All the extremities of mighty Love.
The excess of heat is but a fable;
We know the torrid Zone is now found habitable.
5.
Among the Woods and Forests thou art found,
There Bores and Lions thou do tame;
Is not my heart a noble game?
Let Venus Men, and Beasts Diana wound.
Thou do the Birds thy Subjects make;
Thy nimble feathers do their wings oretake:
At every spring they chant thy praise;
Make me but love like them, I Will sing thee better lays.
6.
What service can mute Fishes do to Thee?
Yet against them by Dart prevails,
Peircing the armor of their Scales;
And still thy sea-borne Mother lives i'th'Sea:
Do thou deny only to me
The no-great privilege of Captivity?
I beg or challenge here thy Bow;
Either thy pity to me, or else thine anger show.
7.
Come; or I Will teach the world to scorn that Bow:
I Will teach them thousand wholesome arts
Both to resist and cure thy darts,
More then thy skillful Ovid ere did know.
Music of sighs thou shall not hear,
Nor drink no more on wretched Lovers Tear:
Nay, unless soon thou woundest me,
My Verses shall not only wound, but murder Thee.
The Thraldom.
1.
I Came, I saw, and was undone;
The Lightning through my bones and marrow run;
A poynted pain pierced deep my heart;
A swift, cold trembling seized on every part;
My head turned round, nor could it bear
The Poison that was entered there.
2.
So a destroying Angels breath
Blows in the Plague, and with it hasty Death.
Such was the pain, did so begin
To the poor wretch, when Legion entered in.
Forgive me, God, I cried; for I
Flattered my self I was to dye.
3.
But quickly to my Cost I found,
'Twas cruel Love not Death had made the wound.
Death a more generous rage does use;
Quarter to all he conquers does refuse.
Whilst Love with barbarous mercy saves
The vanquished lives to make them slaves.
4:
I am thy slave then; let me know,
Hard Master, the great ask I have to do:
Who pride and scorn do undergo,
In tempests and rough Seas thy Galleys row;
Thy part, and groan, and sigh, but find
Thy sighs increase the angry wind.
5.
Like an Egyptian Tyrant, some
Thou weariest out, in building but a Tomb.
Others with sad, and tedious art
Labor in the Quarries of a stony Heart;
Of all the works thou do assign
To all the several slaves of thine,
Employ me, mighty Love, to dig the Mine.
The Given Lover.
1:
I Will on; for what should hinder me
From Loving, and Enjoying Thee?
Thou can not those exceptions make,
Which thin-sould, under-mortalls take;
That my Fate's too mean and low;
'Twere pity I should love thee so,
If that dull cause could hinder me
In Loving, and Enjoying thee.
2.
It does not me a whit displease,
That the rich all honors seize;
That you all Titles make your own,
Are Valiant, Learned, Wise alone.
But if you claim over Women too
The power which over men ye do;
If you alone must Lovers be;
For that, Sirs, you must pardon me.
3.
Rather then loose what does so near
Concern my Life, and Being here,
I Will some such crooked ways invent,
As you, or your Forefathers went:
I Will flatter or oppose the King,
Turn Puritan, or Any thing;
I Will force my Mind to arts so new:
Grow Rich, and Love as well as You.
4.
But rather thus let me remain,
As Man in Paradise did reign;
When perfect Love did so agree
With Innocence and Poverty.
Adam did no Jointure give,
Himself was Jointure to his Eve:
Untoucht with Av'arice yet or Pride,
The Rib came freely back to 'his side.
5.
A curse upon the man who taught
Women, that Love was to be bought;
Rather dote only on your Gold,
And that with greedy av'arice hold;
For if Woman too submit
To that, and sell her self for it,
Fond Lover, you a Mistress have
Of her, that is but your Fellow slave.
6.
What should those Poets mean of old
That made their God to woo in God?
Of all men sure They had no cause
To bind Love to such costly Laws;
And yet I scarcely blame them now;
For who, alas, would not allow,
That Women should such gifts receive,
Could They themselves Be what They give.
7.
If thou, my Dear, Thy self should prize,
Alas, what value would suffice?
The Spaniard could not do it, though he
Should to both Indies jointure thee.
Thy beauties therefore wrong will take,
If thou should any bargain make,
To give All will befit thee well;
But not at Under-Rates to sell.
8.
Bestow thy Beauty then on me,
Freely, as Nature gave't to Thee;
It Is an exploded Popish thought
To think that Heaven may be bought.
Prayers, Hymns, and Praises are the way;
And those my thankful Muse shall pay;
The Body in my verse enshrined,
Shall grow immortal as thy Mind.
9.
I Will fix thy title next in fame
To Sacharissas well-sung name.
So faithfully will I declare
What all thy wondrous beauties are,
That when at the last great Assize
All Women shall together rise,
Men strait shall cast their eyes on Thee,
And know at first that Thou art She.
The Spring.
1.
THough you be absent here, I needs must say,
The Trees as beauteous are, and flowers as gay,
As ever they were wont to be;
Nay the Birds rural music too
Is as Melodious and free,
As if they sung to pleasure you:
I saw a Rose But o'pe this morn; I Will swear
The blushing Morning opened not more fair.
2.
How could it be so fair, and you away?
How could the Trees be beauteous, Flowers so gay?
Could they remember but last year,
How you did Them, They you delight,
The sprouting leaves which saw you here,
And called their Fellows to the sight,
Would, looking round for the same sight in vain,
Creep back into their silent Barks again.
3.
Where ere you walked, trees were as reverend made,
As when of old Gods dwelt in every shade.
Is It possible they should not know,
What loss of honor they sustain,
That thus they smile and flourish now,
And still their former pride retain?
Dull creatures! it is not without cause that she,
Who fled the God of wit, was made a Tree.
4.
In ancient times sure they much wiser were,
When they rejoiced the Thracian verse to hear;
In vain did nature bid them stay
When Orpheus had his song begun,
They called their wondering roots away
And bad them silent to him run.
How would those learned trees have followed you?
You would have drawn Them, and their Poet too.
5.
But who can blame them now? for, since you're gone,
They are here the only Fair, and Shine alone.
You did their Natural Rights invade;
Where ever you did walk or sit,
The thickest Bows could make no shade,
Although the Sun had granted it:
The fairest Flowers could please noe more, near you,
Then Painted flowers, set next to them, could do.
6.
When e're then you come hither, that shall be
The time, which this to others is, to Me.
The little joys which here are now
The name of Punishments do bear;
When by their sight they let us Know
How we deprived of greater are.
It Is you the best of Seasons with you bring;
This is for Beasts, and that for Men the Spring.
Written in Juice of Lemon.
1.
WHilst what I write I do not see,
I dare thus eve to you write Poetry.
Ah foolish muse, which do so high aspire,
And know her judgment well
How much it does thy power excel,
Yet dare be ready by, thy just doom, the Fire.
2.
Alas, thou think thy self secure,
Because thy form is Innocent and Pure:
Like Hypocrites, which seem unspotted here;
But when they sadly come to die,
And the last Fire their Truth must try,
Scrauld ore like thee, and blotted they appear.
3.
Go then, but reverently go,
And, since thou needs must sin, confess it too:
Confes't, and with humility cloth thy shame;
For thou, who else must burned be
An Heretic, if she pardon thee,
Mays't like a Martyr then enjoy the Flame.
4.
But if her wisdom grow severe,
And suffer not her goodness to be there;
If her large mercyes cruelly it restrain;
Be not discouraged, but require
A more gentle Ordeall Fire,
And bid her by Loves Flames read it again.
5.
Strange power of heat, thou yet do show
Like winter earth, naked, or clothed with snow,
But, as the quickening sun approaching near,
The Planets arise up by degrees,
A sudden paint adornes the trees
And all kind Natures Characters appear.
6.
So, nothing yet in Thee is seen,
But soon as Geniall heat warmes thee within,
A newborn Wood of various Lines there grows;
Here but an A, and there a B,
Here sprouts a V, and there a T,
And all the flourishing Letters stand in Rows.
7.
Still, seely Paper, thou will think
That all this might as well be writ with Ink.
Oh no; there is sense in this, and Mystery;
Thou now must change thy Authors name,
And to Hand lay noble claim;
For as She Reads, she Makes the words in Thee.
8.
Yet if thine own unworthiness
Will still, that thou art mine, not Hers, confess;
Consume thy self with Fire before her Eyes,
And so her Grace and Pity move;
The Gods, though Beasts they do not Love,
Yet like them when thei'r burnt in Sacrifice.
Inconstancy.
FIve years ago (says story) I loved you,
For which you call me most inconstant now;
Pardon me, Madam, you mistake the man;
For I am not the same that I was than;
No Flesh is now the same 'twas then in me,
And that my mind is changed your self may see.
The same Thoughts to retain still, and Intents
Were more inconstant far; for Accidents
Must of all things most strangely Inconstant prove,
If from one Subject they t'another move;
My Members then, the Father Members were
From whence These take their birth, which now are here.
If then this Body love what the other did,
'Twere Incest, which by Nature is forbid.
You might as well this Day inconstant name,
Because the Weather is not still the same,
That it was yesterday, or blame the Year,
'Cause the Spring Flowers, and Autumn fruit does bear.
The world's a Scene of Changes, and to be
Constant, in Nature were Inconstancy:
For 'twere to break the Laws her self has made,
Our Substances themselves do fleet, and fade;
The most fixed Being, still does move and fly,
Swift as the Wings of time it is measured by.
T'imagine then that Love will never cease
(Love which is but the Ornament of these)
Were quite as senseless, as to wonder why
Beauty and Color stays not when we dye.
Not Fair.
It Is very true, I thought you once as fair,
As women in the Idea are.
What ever here seems beauteous, seemed to be
But a faint Metaphor of Thee.
But then (me thoughts) there something shined within,
Which cast this Luster over thy skin.
Nor could I choose but count it the Suns Light,
Which made this Cloud appear so bright.
But since I knew thy falsehood and thy pride,
And all thy thousand faults beside:
A very Moore (me thinks) placed near to Thee,
White as his Teeth would seem to be.
So men (they say) by hells delusion led,
Have taken a Succubus to their bed:
Believe it fair, and themselves happy call,
Till the cleft Foot discovers all:
Then they start from't, half Ghosts themselves with fear;
And Devil as, it is, it does appear.
So since against my will I found Thee foul,
Deformed and crooked in thy Soul,
My Reason strait did to my Senses show,
That they might be mistaken too:
Nay when the world but knows how false you are,
There Is not a man will think you fair.
Thy shape will monstrous in their fancies be,
They Will call their Eyes as false as Thee.
Be what thou will; hate will present thee so,
As Puritans do the Pope, and Papists Luther do.
Platonic love.
1.
INdeed I must confess,
When Souls mix it is an happiness:
But not complete till Bodies too do join,
And both our Wholes into one Whole combine:
But half of Heaven the Souls in glory taste,
'Till by Love in Heaven at last,
Their Bodies too are placed.
2.
In thy immortal part
Man, as well as I thou art.
But something it is that differs Thee and Me:
And we must one even in that difference be.
I Thee, both as a man, and woman prize:
For a perfect Love implies
Love in all Capacities.
3.
Can that for true love pass,
When a fair woman courts her glass?
Something unlike must in Loves likeness be,
His wonder is, one and Variety.
For he, whose soul naught but a Soul can move,
Does a new Narcissus prove,
And his own Image love.
4.
That souls do beauty know,
It Is to the Bodies help they owe;
If when they ow't they strait abuse that trust,
And shut the Body from't, it is as unjust,
As if I brought my dearest friend to see
My Mistress, and at the instant He
Should steal her quite from Me.
The Change.
1.
Love in her sunny Eyes does basking play;
Love walks the pleasant Mazes of her Hair,
Love does on both her Lips for ever stray;
And sows and reaps a thousand kisses there.
In all her outward parts Lov's always seen:
But, oh, He never went within.
2.
Within Loves foes, his greatest foes abide
Malice, Inconstancy, and Pride.
So the Earths face, Trees, Herbs, and Flowers do dress
With other beauties numberless:
But at the Center, Darkness is, and Hell;
There wicked Spirits, and there the Damned dwell.
3.
With me alas quite contrary it fares;
Darkness and Death lies in my weeping eyes,
Despair and Palenesse in my face appears,
And Grief and Fear Loves greatest enemies;
But, like the Persian Tyrant, Love within
Keeps his proud Court and never is seeen.
4.
Oh take my Heart, and by what means you will prove
Within too stored enough of Love:
Give me but Yours, I Will by that change so thrive,
That Love in all my parts shall live.
So powerful is this Change, it render can
My outside Woman, and your inside Man.
Clad all in White.
1.
FAirest thing that shines below,
Why in this robe do thou appear?
Would thou a white most perfect show,
Thou must at all no garment wear:
Thou will seem much whiter so,
Then Winter when it is clad with Snow.
2.
It Is not the Linen shows so fair:
Her skin shines through, and makes it bright;
So Clouds themselves like Suns appear,
When the Sun pierces them with Light.
So Lillies in a glass enclose,
The Glass will seem as white as those.
3.
Thou now one heap of beauty art,
Naught outward, or within is foul;
Condensed beams make every part:
Thy Body's clothed like thy Soul.
Thy soul which does it self display,
Like a star placed in the the Milky way.
4.
Such robes the Saints departed wear,
Wooven all with Light divine;
Such their exalted Bodies are,
And with such full glory shine.
But oh, they 'tend not mortals pain:
Men pray, I fear, to both in vain.
5.
Yet seeing thee so gently pure,
My hopes will needs continue still;
Thou would not take this garment sure,
When thou had an intent to kill.
Of Peace and yielding who would doubt,
When the White Flags he sees hung out?
Leaving Me, and then loving many.
SO Men who once have cast the truth away,
Forsook by God, do strange wild lusts obey;
So the vain Gentiles, when they left to adore
One Deity, could not stop at thousands more.
Their zeal was senseless straight, and boundless grown:
They worshipped many a Beast, and many a Stone.
Ah fair Apostate! could thou think to flee
From Truth and Goodness, yet keep Unity?
I reigned alone, and my blessed Self could call
The Universal Monarch of her All.
Mine, mine her fair East Indies were above,
Where those Suns rise that cheer the world of Love;
Where Beauties shine like gems of richest price:
Where Coral grows, and every breath is spice:
Mine too her rich West Indies were below,
Where Mines of gold and treasures grow.
But as, when the Pellaean Conqueror di'd,
Many small Princes did his Crown divide,
So since my Love has vanquished world forsook,
Murdered by poisons from her falsehoods took,
An hundred petty Kings claim each their part,
And rend that glorious Empire of her Heart.
My Heart discovered.
HEr body is so gently bright,
Clear, and transparent to the sight,
(Clear as fair Crystal to the view,
Yet soft as that, ere Stone it grew;)
That through her flesh, me thinks, is seen
The brightest Soul that dwells within:
Our eyes through the radiant covering pass,
And see that Lilly through its Glass.
I through her Breast, her Heart espy,
As Souls in hearts do Souls descry.
I see it with gentle Motions beat;
I see light in it but find no heat.
Within like Angels in the sky,
A thousand gilded thoughts do fly:
Thoughts of bright and noblest kind,
Fair and chaste, as Mother Mind.
But oh, what other heart is there,
Which sighs and crowds to hers so near?
It Is all on flame, and does like fire
To that, as to it is Heaven aspire.
The wounds are many in it and deep;
Still does it bleed, and still does weep,
Whose ever wretched Heart it be,
I cannot choose but grieve to see:
What pity in my Breast does reign?
Me thinks I feel all its pain.
So torn and so defaced it lies,
That it could neera be known by the eyes:
But, Oh, at last I heard it groan,
And knew by th'Voice that it was mine own:
So poor Alcione, when she saw
A shipwrackt body to'wards her draw
Beat by the waves, let fall a Tear,
Which only then did Pity wear:
But when the Corpse on shore were cast,
Which she her husband found at last:
What should the wretched widow do?
Grief changed her strait, away she flew,
Turned to a Bird: and so at last shall I
Both from my Murdered Heart, and Murderer fly.
Answer to the Platonicks.
SO Angels love, so let them for me;
When I Am all Soul, such shall my Love too be:
Who nothing here but like a Sp'rit would do,
In a short time beleeve'twill be one too,
But'shal our Love do what in Beasts we see?
Even Beasts eat too, but not so well as We.
And you as justly might in thirst refuse,
The use of Wine, because Beasts Water use,
They taste those pleasures as they do their food;
Undrest tstey take it, devour it raw and crude:
But to us men, Love cooks it at his fire,
And adds the poignant sauce of sharp desire,
Beasts do the same, it is true: but ancient fame
Says, Gods themselves turned Beasts to do the same.
The Thunderer,, who, without the female bed,
Could Goddesses bring forth from out his head,
Chose rather Mortals this way to create;
So much he 'steemd his pleasure, 'bove his state.
Ye talk of fires which shine, but never burn;
In this cold world they will hardly serve our turn:
As useless despairing Lovers grown,
As Lambent flames, to men in the Frigid Zone.
The Sun does his pure fires on earth bestow
With Nuptial warmth, to bring forth things below;
Such is Loves noblest and divinest heat,
That warmes like his, and does like his beget.
Lust you call this, a name to yours most just,
If an inordinate Desire be Lust:
Pygmalion, loving what none can enjoy,
More lustful was, then the hot youth of Troy.
The vain Love. Loving one first because she could love no body, Afterward
loving her with desire.
WHat newfound Witchcraft was in thee,
With thine own Cold to kindle Me?
Strange art! like him that should devise
To make a Burning-Glasse of Ice:
When winter so the Plants would harm,
Her snow it self does keep them warm:
Fool that I was! who having found
A rich and Sunny Diamond,
Admired the hardness of the Stone:
But not the light with which it shone:
Your brave and haughty scorn of all
Was stately, and Monarchical.
All Gentleness with that esteemed
A dull and slavish virtue seemed:
Should you have yielded then to me,
You'had lost what most I loved in thee:
For who would serve one, whom he sees
That he can Conquer if he please*
It fared with me, as if a slave
In Triumph lead, that does perceive
With what a gay Majestic pride
His Conqueror through the streets does ride*
Should be contented with his woe,
Which makes up such a comely show.
I sought not from thee a return,
But without Hopes or Fears did burn:
My covetous Passion did approve
The Hoording up, not Use of Love.
My Love a kind of Dream was grown,
A Foolish but a Pleasant one:
From which I Am wakened now, but oh,
Prisoners to die are wakened so.
For now my Fires and Wishes are
Nothing but Longings with Despair.
Despair, whose torments no men sure
But Lovers and the Damned endure.
Her scorn I doted once upon,
Ill object for Affection.
But since, alas, too much it is proved
That yet 'twas something that I loved:
Now my desires are worse and flee
At an Impossibility:
Desires, which whilst so high they soar,
Are proud as that I loved before.
What lover can like me complain,
Who first loved vainly, next in vain?
The Soul.
1.
IF mine Eyes do ere declare
They'have seen a second thing that is fair:
Or Ears that they have Music found,
Besides thy Voice in any Sound;
If my taste do ever meet,
After thy Kiss with ought that is sweet;
If my abused Touch allow,
Ought to be smooth, or soft but You:
If, what seasonable Springs,
Or the Eastern Summer brings,
Do my Smell persuade at all
Ought Perfume; but thy Breath to call:
If all my senses Objects be
Not contracted into Thee,
And so through Thee more powerful pass,
As Beams do through a Burning Glass:
If all things that in Nature are
Either soft, or sweet, or fair,
Are not in thee so Epitomized,
May I as worthless seem to Thee
As all, but Thou, appears to Me.
2.
If I ever Anger know
Till some wrong be done to You;
If Gods or Kings my Envy move,
Without their Crowns crowned by thy Love;
If ever I an hope admit,
Without thy Image stamped on it:
Or any fear till I begin
To find that You Are concerned therein;
If a Joy ere come to Me,
That tastes of any thing but Thee:
If any Sorrow touch my Mind,
Whilst You are well and not unkind:
If I a minutes space debate,
Whether I shall curse and hate:
The things beneath thy hatred fall,
Though ^ll the World My self and all:
And for Love; if ever I
Appear to it again so nigh,
As to allow a Toleration
To the least glimmering Inclination;
If thou alone do not control
All those Tyrants of my Soul,
And to thy Beauties tyest them so,
That constant they as Habits grow;
If any Passion of my Heart,
By any force, or any art,
Be brought to move one step from Thee,
May Thou no Passion have for Me.
3.
If my busy Imagination
Do not Thee in all things fashion:
So that all Fair Species be
Hyeroglyphick marks of Thee;
If when She her sports does keep,
(The lower Soul being all asleep)
She play one Dream with all her art
Where Thou have not the longest part.
If ought get place in my Remembrance
Without some badge of thy resemblance,
So that thy parts become to me
A kind of Art of Memory:
If my Understanding do
Seek any Knowledge but of You
If she do near thy Body prize
Her Bodies of Philosophies,
If She to the Will do show
Ought desirable but You,
Or if That would not rebel,
Should she another Doctrine tell:
If my Will do not resign
All her Liberty to thine;
If she would not follow Thee,
Though Fate and Thou should disagree:
And if (for I a curse will give,
Such as shall force thee to believe)
My soul be not entirely Thine,
May thy dear Body never be Mine.
The Passions.
1.
FRom Hate, Fear, Hope, Anger, and Envy free
And all the Passions else that be,
In vain I boast of Liberty,
In vain this State a Freedom call:
Since I have Love, and Love is all:
Sot that I am, who think it fit to brag,
That I have no Disease beside the Plague*
2.
So in a zeal the Sons of Israel,
Sometimes upon their Idols fell:
And they deposed the powers of Hell,
Baal, and Astarte down they threw,
And Accaron, and Molock too;
All this imperfect Piety did no good,
Whilst yet alas the Calfe of Bethel stood.
3.
Fondly I boast that I have dressed my Vine
With painful Art, and that the wine
Is of a taste rich and divine,
Since love by mixing poison there,
Has made it worse then vinegar.
Love even the taste of Nectar changes so,
That Gods chose rather water here below.
4.
Fear, Anger, hope, all passions else that be,
Drive this one Tyrant out of Me.
And practice all your Tyranny;
Thec hang of ils some good will do;
The oppressed wretched Indians so,
Being floves by the great Spanish Monarch made,
Call in the States of Holland to their aid.
Wisdom.
It Is mighty Wise that you would now be thought
With your grave Rules from musty Morals brought,
Through which some streaks too of Div'nity ran,
Partly of Monk, and partly Puritan:
With tedious Repetitions too you have taken
Often the name of Vanity in vain.
Things which I take it, friend you would nere recite,
Should she I love, but say t'you, Come at night.
The wisest King refused all pleasures quite,
Till Wisdom from above did him enlight:
But when that gifts his ignorance did remove,
Pleasures he chose and placed them all in Love;
And if by event the counsels may be seen,
This wisdom 'twas that brought the Southern Queen.
She came not like a good old Wife to know
The wholesome nature of all plants that grow:
Nor did so far from her own Country rome,
To cure Scaled heads, and broken shins at home:
She came for that which more befits all Wives,
The art of Giving, not of Saving lives.
The Despair.
1.
BEneath this gloomy shade,
By Nature only for my sorrows made,
I Will spend this voice in cries,
In tears I Will wast these eyes
By Love so vainly fed;
So Lust of old the Deluge punished.
Ah wretched youth, said I!
Ah wretched youth! twice did I sadly cry;
Ah wretched youth! the fields and floods reply.
2.
When thoughts of Love I entertain,
I meet no words, but Never, and In vain.
Never (alas) that dreadful name,
Which fewells the infernal flame:
Never, my time to come must ^^st;
In vain, torments the present and the past.
In vain, in vain! said I*
In vain, in vain! twice did I sadly cry;
In vain, in vain, the fields and floods reply.
3.
No more shall fields or floods do so;
For I to shades more dark and silent go:
All this worlds noise appears to me
A dull ill-acted Comedy:
No comfort to my wounded sight
In the Suns busy and impert'nent Light.
Then down I laid my head;
Down on cold earth, and for a while was dead:
And my freed Soul to a strange Somewhere fled.
4.
Ah sottish Soul, said I:
When back t'o his Cage again I saw it fly:
Fool to resume his broken chain!
And row his Calley here again!
Fool to that body to return,
Where it condemned and destined is to burn!
Once dead, how can it be,
Death should a thing so pleasant seem to Thee,
That thou should come to live it over again in Me?
The Wish.
1.
WEll then, I now do plainly see,
This busy world and I shall nere agree:
The very honey of all earthly joy
Does of all meats the soonest cloy,
And they me thinks deserve my pity,
Who for it can endure the stings,
The Crowd, and Buz, and Murmurings
Of this great Hive, the City.
2.
Ah, yet, ere I descend to the grave
May I a small House, and large Garden have!
And a few Friends, and many Books, both true,
Both wise, and both delightful too!
And since Love near will from me flee,
A Mistress moderately fair,
And good as Guardian Angels are,
Only beloved, and loving me.
3.
Oh, Founts! Oh, when in you shall I
My self, eased of unpeacefull thoughts, espy?
Oh, Fields! Oh, Woods! when, shall I be made
The happy Tenant of your shade?
Here Is the spring head of Pleasures flood:
Here Is wealthy Natures Treasury,
Where all the Riches lie that she
Has coined and stamped for good.
4.
Pride and Ambition here,
Only in far fetched Metaphors appear:
Here naught but winds can hurtful Murmurs scatter,
And naught but echo flatter.
The Gods when they descended, hither
From heaven did always choose their way;
And therefore we may boldly say,
That it is the way too thither.
5.
How happy here should I,
And one dear She, live, and embracing dye?
She who is al! the world, and can exclude
In deserts solitude.
I should then this only fear,
Lest men, when they my pleasures see,
Should all come im'itate Me,
And so make a City here.
My Diet.
1.
NOw by my Love, the greatest Oath that is,
None loves you half so well as I:
I do not ask your Love for this,
But for heavens sake believe me, or I die.
No Servant ere, but did deserve
His Master should believe that he does serve;
And I Will ask no more wages, though I sterve.
2.
It Is no luxurious Diet this, and sure
I shall not by it too lusty prove;
Yet shall it willingly endure,
If It can but keep together Life and Love.
Being your Prisoner and your slave
I do not Feasts and Banquets look to have,
A little Bread and Water's all I crave.
3.
O'n a sigh of Pity I a year can live,
One Tear will keep me twenty at least,
Fifty a gentle look will give;
An hundred years on one kind word I Will feast:
A thousand more will added be
If you an Inclination have for Me:
And all beyond is vast Aeternity.
The Thief.
1.
THou rob'st my Days of business and delights,
Of sleep thou rob'st my Nights:
Ah lovely Thief, what will thou do?
What? rob me of Heaven too?
Even in my prayers thou hauntest me;
And I, with wild Idolatry
Begin to God, and end them all, to Thee.
2.
Is it a Sin to Love, that it should thus
Like an ill Conscience torture us?
What ere I do, where ere I go,
(None Guiltless ere was haunted so)
Still, still, me thinks thy face I view,
And still thy shape does me pursue,
As if, not you Me, but I had murdered You.
3.
From books I strive some remedy to take,
But thy Name all the Letters make;
What ere it is writ, I find that there,
Like Points and Comma's every where;
Me blessed for this let no man hold,
For I, as Midas did of old,
Perish by turning every thing to Gold.
4.
What do I seek, alas, or what do I
Attempt in vain from thee to fly?
For making thee my Deity
I gave thee then Ubiquitie.
My pains resemble Hell in this;
The divine presence there too is,
But to torment Men, not to give them bliss.
All over, Love.
1.
It Is well, it is well with them (say I)
Whose short lived Passions with themselves can dye:
For none can be unhappy, who
'Midst all his ills a time does know
(Though nere so long) when he shall not be so.
1.
What ever parts of Me remain,
Those parts will still the Love of Thee retain;
For 'twas not only in my Heart,
But like a God by powerful Art,
'Twas all in all, and all in every Part.
3.
My Affection no more perish can
Then the first Matter that compounds a Man.
Hereafter if one Dust of Me
Mixed with another Substance be,
'Twill Leaven that whole Lump with Love of Thee.
4.
Let Nature if she please disperse
My Atoms over all the Universe,
At the last they easily shall,
Themselves know, and together call,
For thy Love, like a Mark, is stamped on all.
Love and Life.
1.
NOw sure, within this twelvemonth past
I 'have loved at least some twenty years or more:
The account of Love runs much more fast
Then that with which our Life does score:
So though my Life be short, yet I may prove
The great Methusalem of Love.
2.
Not that Loves Hours or Minutes are
Shorter then those our Being's measured by:
But they are more close compacted far,
And so in lesser room do ly.
Thin airy things extend themselves in space,
Things solid took up little place.
3.
Yet Love, alas, and Life in Me
Are not two several things, but purely one,
At once how can there in it be
A double different Motion?
O yes, there may: for so the self same Sun,
At once does slow and swiftly run.
4.
Swiftly his daily course he goes,
And walks his Annual with a statelier pace;
And does three hundred rounds enclose
Within one yearly Circles space.
5.
When Soul does to my self refer,
It Is then my life, and does but slowly move;
But when it does relate to her,
It swiftly flies, and then is love.
Love's my Diurnall course, divided right
'Twixt Hope and Fear, my Day and Night.
The Bargain.
1.
TAke heed, take heed thou lovely Maid,
Not be by glittering ills betrayed;
Thy self for Money? oh, let no man know
The Price of beauty fallen so low!
What dangers oughtst thou not to dread,
When Love that is Blind, is by blind Fortune led?
2.
The foolish Indian that sells
His precious Gold for beads and bells,
Does a more wise and gainful traffic hold,
Then thou who sell'st hy self for gold.
What gains in such a bargain are?
He Will in thy Mines dig better Treasures far.
3.
Can Gold, alas, with Thee compare?
The Sun that makes it is not so fair;
The Sun which can nor make nor ever see
A thing so beautiful as Thee
In all the journeys he does pass,
Though the Sea served him for a looking glass.
4.
Bold was the wretch that cheapened Thee,
Since Magus none so bold as he,
You Are so divine a thing, that Thee to buy,
Is to be counted Simony;
Too dear he will find his sordid price,
Has forfeited that, and the Benefice.
5.
If it be lawful Thee to buy,
There Is none can pay that rate but I:
Nothing on earth a fitting price can be,
But what on earth's most like to Thee.
And that my Heart does only bear:
For there Thy self, Thy very self is there.
6.
So much thy self does in me live,
That when for it thy self I give,
It Is but to change that piece of Gold for this,
Whose stamp and value equal is.
Yet lest the weight be counted bad,
My Soul and Body, two Grains more, I Will add.
The long Life.
1.
LOve from Times wings has stolen the feathers sure,
He has; and put them to his own:
For Hours of late as long as Days endure,
And very Minutes How'rs are grown.
2.
The various Motions of the turning Year,
Belong not now at all to Me:
Eeach Summers Night does Lucies now appear,
Each Winter Day Saint Barnabie.
3.
How long a space since first I loved it is?
To look into a glass I fear;
And am surprised with wonder when I miss,
Gray hairs and wrinkles there.
4.
The Old Patriarchs age and not their happiness too
Why does hard fate to us restore?
Why does Loves Fire thus to Mankind renew,
What the Flood washed away before?
5.
Sure those are happy people that complain,
OF the shortness of the days of Man:
Contract mine, Heaven, and bring them back again
To the ordinary Span.
6.
If when your gift, long Life, I disapprove,
I too ungrateful seem to be;
Punish me justly, heaven: make Her to love,
And then it will be too short for Me.
Council.
1.
GEntly, ah gently, Madam touch
The wound, which you your self have made;
That pain must needs be very much,
Which makes me of your hand afraid.
Cordialls of pity give me now,
For I too weak for Purgings grow.
2.
Do but a while with patience stay;
For Counsel yet will do no good,
Till Time, and Rest, and Heaven allay,
The vi'olent burnings of my blood,
For what effect from this can flow,
To chide men drunk, for being so?
3.
Perhaps the Physick's good you give
But nere to me can useful prove:
Medicines may Cure, but not Revive;
And I Am not Sick, but Dead in Love.
In Loves Hell, not his World, am I;
At once I Live, am Dead, and Die.
4.
What new found Rhetoric is thine?
Even thy Disswassions me persuade,
And thy great power does clearest shine,
When thy Commands are disobeyed.
In vain thou bidst me to forbear;
Obedience were Rebellion here.
5.
Thy Tongue comes in as if it meant
Against thine Eyes t'assist my Heart;
But different far was his intent:
For strait the Traitor took their part.
And by this new foe I Am bereft
Of all that Little which was left.
6.
The act I must confess was wise,
As a dishonest act could be:
Well knew the Tongue (alas) your Eyes
Would be too strong for That, and Me.
And part of the Triumph chose to get,
Rather then be a part of it.
Resolved to be beloved.
1.
It Is true, I have loved already three or four,
And shall three or four hundred more:
I Will love each fair one that I see,
Till I find one at last that shall love Me.
2.
That shall my Canaan be, the fatal soil,
That ends my wanderings, and my toil.
I Will settle there and happy grow;
The Country does with Milk and Honey flow.
3.
The Needle trembles so, and turns about:
Till it the Northern point find out:
But constant then and fixed does prove,
Fixed, that his dearest Pole as soon may move.
4.
Then may my Vessel torn and shipwrackt be,
If it put forth again to Sea:
It never more abroad shall rome,
Though It could next voyage bring the Indies home.
5.
But I must sweat in Love, and labor yet,
Till I a Competency get.
They Are slothful fools who leave a Trade,
Till they a moderate Fortune by it have made.
6.
Variety I ask not; give me One
To live perpetually upon.
The person Love does to us fit,
Like Manna, has the Taste of all in it.
The same.
1.
FOr Heavens sake what d' you mean to do?
Keep me or let me go, one of the two;
Youth and warm hours let me not idely loose,
The little Time that Love does choose;
If always here I must not stay,
Let me be gone whilst yet it is day;
Lest I faint and benighted lose my way.
2.
It Is dismal, One so long to love
In vain, till to love more as vain must prove:
To hunt so long one nimble prey, till we
Too weary to take others be;
Alas it is folly to remain,
And wast our Army thus in vain,
Before a City, which will nere be taken.
3.
At several hopes wisely to fly,
Ought not to be esteemed Inconstancy:
It Is more Inconstant always to pursue
A thing that always flies from you;
For that at last may meet a bound,
But no end can to this be found,
It Is naught but a perpetual fruitless Round.
4.
When it does Hardness meet and Pride,
My Love does then rebound t'another side:
But if it ought that is soft and yielding hit;
It lodges there, and stays in it.
What ever it is shall first love me,
That it my Heaven may truly be;
I shall be sure to give't Eternity.
The Discovery.
1.
BY Heaven I Will tell her boldly that it is She;
Why should She ashamed or angry be,
To be beloved by Me?
The Gods may give their Altars over;
They Will smoke but seldom any more,
If none but Happy Men must them adore.
2.
The Lightning, which tall Oaks oppose in vain,
To strike sometimes does not disdain,
The humble Furzes of the Plain.
She being so high, and I so low,
Her power by this does greater show,
Who at such distance gives so sure a blow.
3.
Compared with her all things so worthless prove,
That naught on earth can toward her move
Till't be exalted by her Love.
Equal to her, alas, there is none;
She like a Deity is grown:
That must Create, or else must be alone.
4.
If there be man who thinks himself so high,
As to pretend aequality,
He deserves her less, then I;
For he would cheat for his relief;
And one would give with lesser grief
To an undeserving Beggar, then a Thief,
Against Fruition.
NO; thour't a fool, I Will swear, if ere thou grant:
Much of my Veneration thou must want,
Whence once thy kindness puts my Ignorance out
For a learned Age is always least devout.
Keep still thy distance; for at once to me
Goddess and Woman too, thou can not be;
Thour't Queen of all that sees thee; and as such
Must neither Tyrannize, nor yield to much;
Such freedom give as may admit command,
But keep the Forts, and Magazines in thine hand.
Thour't yet a whole world to me, and do fill
My large ambition; but it is dangerous still,
Lest I like the Pellaean Prince should be,
And weep for other worlds hav'ng conquered thee;
When Love has taken all thou have away,
His strength by too much riches will decay.
Thou in my fancy do much higher stand,
Then Women can be placed by Natures hand;
And I must needs, I Am sure, a loser be,
To change Thee, as Thour't there, for very Thee.
Thy sweetness is so much within me placed,
That should thou Nectar give't would spoil the taste,
Beauty at first moves wonder and delight;
It Is Natures Juggling trick to cheat the sight,
Wee'admire it, whilst unknown, but after more
Admire our selves, for liking it before.
Love, like a greedy Hawke, if we give way,
Does over-gorge himself, with his own Prey;
Of very hopes a surfeit he will sustain,
Unless by fears he cast them up again.
His spirit and sweetness dangers keep alone;
If once he lose his sting he grows a Drone.
Love undiscovered.
1.
I Others may with safety tell
The moderate Flames which in them dwell;
And either find some Med'cin there,
Or cure themselves even by Despair;
My Love's so great that it might prove
Dangerous to tell her that I Love.
So tender is my wound, it must not bear
Any salute though of the kindest air.
2.
I would not have her know the pain,
The Torments for her I sustain.
Lest too much goodness make her throw
Her Love upon a Fate too Iow.
Forbid it Heaven my Life should be
Weighed with her least Conveniencie;
No: let me perish rather with my grief,
Then to her disadvantage find relief.
3.
Yet when I dye my last breath shall
Grow bold, and plainly tell her all.
Like covetous men who nere discry
Their dear hid Treasures till they dye.
Ah fairest Maid, how should it cheer
My Ghost, to get from Thee a Tear*
But take heed: for if me thou Pittiest then,
Twenty to one but I shall live again.
The given Heart.
1.
I Wonder what those Lovers mean, who say
They have given their Hearts away.
Some good kind Lover, tell me how;
For mine is but a Torment to me now.
2.
If so it be, one place both hearts contain,
For what do they complain?
What courtesy can Love do more,
Then join Hearts, that parted were before?
3.
Woe to her stubborn Heart, if once mine come
Into the self same room;
'Twill tear and blow up all within,
Like a Granado shot into a Magazin.
4.
Then shall Love keep the ashes and torn parts,
Of both our broken Hearts;
Shall out of both one new one make
From hers, th'Allay, from mine the Metal take.
5.
For of her heart, he from the Flames will find
But little left behind:
Mine only will remain entire;
No dross was there, to perish in the Fire.
The Prophet.
1.
TEach me to Love? go teach thy self more wit;
I chief Professor am of it.
Teach craft to Scots, and thrift to Jews,
Teach boldness to the Stews,
In Tyrants Courts teach supple flattery,
Teach Sophisters and Jesuits to lie.
Teach fire to burn, and winds to blow,
Teach restless fountains how to flow,
Teach the dull earth fixed to abide,
Teach Women kind, Inconstancy and Pride*
See if your diligence here will useful prove;
But, neither, teach not me to Love.
2.
The God of Love, if such a thing there be,
May learn to love from Me.
He who does boast that he has bin
In every Heart since Adams sin,
I Will lay my Life, my Mrs. on it, that is more;
I Will teach him things he never knew before:
I Will teach him a Receipt to make
Tears, which shall understand, and speak:
I Will teach him Sighs, like those in Death,
At which the Soul goes out too with the breath*
Still the Soul stays, yet still does from me run*
As light and heat does with the Sun.
3.
It Is I who Loves Columbus am; it is I:
Who must new Worlds in it descry.
Rich Worlds that yield of Treasure more,
Than all that has been known before.
And yet like his (I fear) my Fate must be,
To find them out for others, not for Me.
Mee'times to come, I know it, shall
Loves last and greatest Prophet call.
But, ah, what is this, if she refuse,
To hear the wholesome Doctrines of my Muse?
If to my share the Prophets Fate must come.
Hereafter Fame, here Martyrdom.
The Resolution.
1.
THe Devil take those foolish men,
Who gave you first such powers;
We stood on even grounds till then,
If any odds, Creation made it ours.
2.
For shame let these weak chains be broke;
Lets our slight bonds like Sampson tear;
And nobly cast away that yoke,
Which we nor our Forefathers ere could bear.
3.
French Laws forbid the female Reign,
Yet Love does them to slavery draw,
Alas, if we will our rights maintain.
It Is all Mankind must make a Salique Law.
Called Inconstant.
1.
HA! ha! you think you have killd my fame;
By this not understood, yet common Name;
A Name, that is full and proper when assigned
To Womankind:
But when you call us so,
It can at best but for a Metaphor go.
2.
Can you the shore Inconstant call,
Which still as Waves pass by, embraces all?
That had as leife the same waves always love,
Did they not from him move?
Or can you faults with Pilots find
For changing course, yet never blame the wind?
3.
Since drunk with vanity you fell:
The things turn round to you that steadfast dwell;
And you your self who from us take your flight
Wonder to find us out of sight.
So the same error ceazes you
As men in motion think the Trees move too.
The Welcome.
1.
GO, let the fatted Calfe be killed;
My Prodigall's come home at last:
With noble resolutions filled,
And filld with sorrow for the past.
No more will burn with Love or Wine:
But quite has left his Women, and his Swine.
2.
Welcome, ah, welcome my poor Heart;
Welcome: I little thought, I Will swear,
('It Is now so long since we did part)
Ever again to see thee here:
Dear wanderer, since from me you fled,
How often have I heard that you were dead.
3.
Had it thou found each woman's breast
(The Lands where thou have traveled)
Either by Savages possessed,
Or wild, and uninhabited?
What joy could take, or what repose
In Countries so unciviliz'd as those?
4.
Lust the scorching Dog-starre here
Rages with immoderate heat;
Whilst Pride the rugged Northern Bear,
In others makes the cold too great.
And where these are temperate known,
The Soil's all barren Land, or rocky Stone.
5.
When once or twice you chanced to view
A rich, well-governed Heart,
Like China, it admitted you
But to the Frontiere-part.
From Paradise shut for evermore,
What good is it that an angel shut the Door?
6.
Welfare the Pride and the Disdain
And Vanities with Beauty joined,
I nere had seen this Heart again,
If any Fair one had been kind;
My Dove, but once let loose, I doubt
Would never return had not the Flood been out.
The Heart fled again.
1.
FAlse foolish Heart, did thou not say
That thou would never leave me more
Behold again it is fled away;
Fled as far from me as before.
I strove to bring it again,
I cried and hollowed after it in vain.
2.
Even so the gentle Tyrian Dame,
When neither Grief nor Love prevail,
Saw the dear object of her flame
Th'ingratfull Trojan hoist his sail*
Aloud she called to him to stay;
The wind bore him and her lost words away.
3.
The doleful Ariadne so,
On the wide shore forsaken stood:
False Theseus, whither do thou go?
A fair false Theseus cut the flood.
But Bacchus came to her relief;
Bacchus himselfe's too weak to ease my grief.
4.
Ah senseless Heart to take no rest,
But travail thus eternally!
Thus to be frozen in every breast!
And to be scorcht in every Eye!
Wandering about like wretched Caine,
Thrust out, ill used by all, but by none slain!
5.
Well, since thou will not here remain,
I Will even to live without Thee try;
My Head shall take the greater pain,
And all thy duties shall supply;
I can more easily live I know
Without Thee, then without a Mistress thou.
Women's Superstition.
1.
OR I Am a very Dunce, or Woman-kinde
Is a most unintelligible thing:
I can no Sense, nor no Contexture find,
Nor their loose parts to Method bring,
I know not what the Learned may see,
But they are strange Hebrew things to Me.
2.
By Customs and Traditions they live,
And foolish Ceremonies of antic date
We Lovers, new and better Doctrines give.
Yet they continue obstinate
Preach we, Loves Prophets, what we will,
Like Jews they keep their old Law still.
3.
Before their Mothers Gods they fondly fall,
Vain Idol Gods, that have no Sense nor Mind:
Honors their Ashtaroth, and Pride their Baal,
The Thundering Baal of Womankind.
With twenty other Devils more,
Which They, as we do Them, adore.
4.
But then like Men, both Covetous and Devout,
Their costly Superstition loath t'omit,
And yet more loath to issue Moneys out.
At their own charge to furnish it.
To these expensive Deities
The Hearts of men they sacrifice.
The Soul.
1.
SOme dull Philosopher when he hears me say,
My Soul is from me fled away.
Nor has of late informed my Body here,
But in another's breast does lie,
That neither, is nor will! be I,
As a Form Servient, and Assisting there.
2.
Will cry, Absurd! and ask me how I live:
And Syllogismes against it give;
A curse on all your vain Philosophies,
Which on weak Natures Law depend,
And know not how to comprehend
Love and Religion, those great Mysteries.
3.
Her Body is my Soul; laugh not at this,
For by my life I swear it is.
It Is that preserves my Being and my Breath,
From that proceeds all that I do,
Nay all my thoughts and speeches too,
And separation from it is my Death.
Echo.
1.
Tired with the rough denialls of my prayer,
From that hard she whom I obey,
I come in and find a Nymph much gentler here,
That gives consent to all I say.
Ah gentle Nymph, who like so well,
In hollow, solitary Caves to dwell.
Her Heart being such, into it go,
And do but once from thence answer me so.
2.
Complaisant Nymph, who do thus kindly share,
In griefs whose cause thou do not know!
Had thou but Eyes, as well as Tongue and Ear,
How much compassion would thou show!
Thy flame, whilst living, or a flower,
Was of less beauty, and less ravishing power;
Alas I might as easily,
Paint thee to her, as describe Her to Thee.
3.
By repercussion Beams engender Fire,
Shapes by reflection shapes beget,
The voice it self, when stopped, does back retire
And a new voice is made by it.
Thus things by opposition
The gainers grow; my barren Love alone,
Does from her stony breast rebound
Producing neither Image, Fire, nor Sound.
The rich Rival.
1.
THey say you are angry and rant mightily,
Because I love the same as you;
Alas! you are very rich, it is true;
But prithee Fool what is that to Love, and Me?
You have Land and Money, let that serve,
And know you have more by that then you deserve.
2.
When next I see my fair One, we shall know,
How worthless thou art of her bed?
And wretch, I Will strike thee dumb and dead;
With noble verse not understood by you;
Whilst thy sole Rhetoric shall be
Jointure, and Jewels, and Our Friends agree.
3.
Pox o'your friends that dote and Domineere:
Lovers are better friends they they:
Let Us those in other things obey,
The Fates, and Stars, and Gods must govern here.
Vain names of Blood! in Love let none
Advise with any Blood, but with their own.
4.
It Is that which bids me this bright Maid adore;
No other thought has had access!
Did she now beg I Would love do less,
And were she'an Empress I should love no more;
Were she as just and true to Me,
Ah, simple soul, what would become of Thee!
Against Hope.
1.
HOpe whose weak Being ruined is,
Alike if it succeed, and if it miss;
Whom Good, or Ill does equally confound,
And both the Horns of Fates Dilemma wound!
Vain shadow, which do vanish quite
Both at full Noon, and perfect Night!
The Stars have not a possibility
Of blessing Thee;
If things then from their End we happy call,
It Is Hope is the most hopeless thing of all;
2.
Hope thou bold Taster of Delight,
Who whilst thou should but taste, devour'st it quite!
Thou bringst us an Estate, yet leave us Poor,
By clogging it with Legacies before!
The Joys which we entire should wed,
Come deflour'd Virgins to our bed;
Good fortunes without gain imported be,
Such mighty Customs paid to Thee.
For Joy, like Wine, kept close, does better taste,
If it take air, before his spirits wast.
3.
Hope, Fortunes cheating Lotterie!
Where for one prize an hundred blanks there be;
Fond Archer, Hope, who take thy aim so far,
That still or short or wide thine arrows are!
Thin, empty Cloud, which the eye deceives
With shapes that our own Fancy gives!
A Cloud, which guilt and painted now appears,
But must drop presently in tears!
When thy false beams ore Reasons light prevail
By Ignes fatui for North Stars we sail.
4.
Brother of Fear, more gaily clad!
The mer'rier Fool ot'h two, yet quite as mad:
Sire of Repentance, Child of fond Desire!
That blows the Chymicks, and the Lovers fire!
Leading them still in sensibly on
By the strong witchcraft of Anon!
By Thee the one does changing Nature through
Her endless Labyrinths pursue,
And the other chases Woman, whilst She goes
More ways and turns then hunted Nature knows.
For Hope.
1.
HOpe, of all Ills that men endure,
The only cheap and universal Cure!
Thou Captiv's Freedom, and thou sick-Mans Health!
Thou Losers Victory, and thou Beggars wealth!
Thou Manna, which from Heaven we eat,
To every taste a several Meat!
Thou strong Retreat! thou sure entailed Estate,
Which naught has power to alienate!
Thou pleasant, honest, Flatterer! for none
Flatter unhappy Men, but thou alone!
2.
Hope, thou first Fruits of Happiness!
Thou gentle Downing of a bright Success!
Thou good Preparative, without which our Joy
Does work too strong, and whilst it cures, destroy;
Who out of Fortunes reach do stand
And art a blessing still in hand!
Whilst Thee, her Earnest Money we retain,
We certain are to gain,
Whether she her bargain break, or else fulfill
Thou only good, not worse for ending ill!
Brother of Faith, 'twixt whom and Thee
The joys of Heaven and Earth divided be!
Though Faith be Heir, and have the fixed estate,
Thy Portion yet in Movables is great.
Happiness it selfe's all one
In Thee, or in Possession!
Only the Futures Thine, the Present His!
Thine's the more hard and noble bliss,
Best apprehender of our joys, which have
So long a reach, and yet can hold so fast!
4.
Hope thou sad Lovers only Friend!
Thou Way that may dispute it with the End!
For Love I fear's a fruit that does delight
The taste it self less then the Smell and sight.
Fruition more deceiptfull is
Then Thou can be, when thou do miss;
Men leave thee by obtaining, and strait flee
Some other way again to Thee;
And that is a pleasant Country, without doubt,
To which all soon return that travail out.
Loves Ingratitude.
1.
I Little thought, thou fond ungrateful Sin,
When first I let thee in,
And gave thee but a part
In my unwary Heart,
That thou would ere have grown,
So false or strong to make it all thine own.
2.
At mine own breast with care I fed thee still,
Letting thee suck thy fill,
And daintily I nourisht Thee
With Idle thoughts and Poetry!
What ill returns do thou allow?
I fed thee then, and thou do sterve me now.
3.
There was a time when thou wast cold and chill,
Nor had the power of doing ill;
Into my bosom did I take,
This frozen and benumbed Snake,
Not fearing from it any harm;
But now it stings that breast that made it warm.
4.
What cursed weed's this Love! but one grain sow
And the whole field it will over-grow;
Strait will it choke up and devour
Each wholesome herb and beauteous flower!
Nay unless something soon I do,
It Will kill I fear, my very Laurel too.
5.
But now all is gone, I now, alas, complain,
Declare, protest, and threat in vain.
Since by my own unforc't consent
The Traitor has my Government,
And is so settled in the Throne,
That it were Rebellion now to claim mine own.
The Frailty.
1.
I Know it is sordid, and it is low;
(All this as well as you I know)
Which I so hotly now pursue;
I know all this as well as you)
But whilst this cursed flesh I bear,
And all the Weakness, and the Baseness there,
Alas, alas, it will be always so.
2.
In vain, exceedingly in vain
I rage sometimes, and bite my Chain;
For to what purpose do I bite
With Teeth, which nere will break it quite?
For if the chiefest Christian Head
Was by this sturdy Tyrant buffeted,
What wonder is it, if weak I be slain?
3.
As when the Sun appears,
The Morning Thickness clears;
So, when my thoughts let sadness in,
And a new Morning does begin,
If any Beauties piercing ray
Strike through my Trembling Eyes a sudden day;
All those grave sullen Vapors melt in Tears.
Coldness.
1.
AS water fluid is, till it do grow
Solid and fixed by Cold;
So in warm Seasons Love does loosely flow,
Frost only can it hold.
A Woman's rigor and disdain
Does his swift course restrain.
2.
Though constant, and consistent now it be,
Yet when kind beams appear,
It melts and glides apace into the Sea,
And loses it self there.
So the Suns amorous play
Kisses the Ice away.
3.
You may in Vulgar Loves find always this;
But my Substantial Love
Of a more firm and perfect Nature is;
No weathers can it move:
Though heat dissolve the Ice again,
The Crystal solid does remain.
The Enjoyment.
1.
THen like some wealthy Island thou shall lie;
And like the Sea about it, I;
Thou like fair Albion to the Sailors Sight
Spreading her beauteous Bosom all in White:
Like the kind Ocean I will be
With loving Arms for ever clasping Thee.
2.
But I Will embrace Thee gentlier far then so;
As their fresh Banks soft Rivers do,
Nor shall the proudest Planet boast a power
Of making my full Love to ebb one hour;
It never dry nor low can prove,
Whilst thy unwasted Fountain feeds my Love.
3.
Such Heat and Vigor shall our Kisses bear,
As if like Doves wee'engendred there.
No bound nor rule my pleasures shall endure,
In Love there is none too much an Epicure.
Naught shall my Hands or Lips control;
I Will kiss Thee trough, I Will kiss thy very Soul.
4.
Yet nothing but the Night our sports shall know;
Night that is both blind and silent too.
Alpheus found not a more secret trace --
His loved Sicanian Fountain to embrace,
Creeping beneath the Aegaean Sea,
Then I will do to enjoy, and feast on Thee.
5.
Men, out of Wisdom, Women, out of Pride,
The pleasant Thefts of Love do hide.
That may secure thee, but thou have yet from Me
A more infallible Security.
For there is no danger I should tell
The Joys, which are to me unspeakable.
Sleep.
1.
IN vain, thou drousy God, I thee invoke;
For thou who do from fumes arise,
Thou who Man's Soul do over-shade
With a thick Cloud, by Vapors made,
Can have no power to shut his eyes,
Or passage of his Spirits to choke,
Whose flam's so pure that it sends up no smoke.
2.
Yet how do Tears but from some Vapors rise?
Tears that bewinter all my Year?
The fate of Egypt I sustain,
And never feel the dew of Rain,
From Clouds within the Head appear,
But all my too much Moisture owe
To overflowings of the Heart below.
3.
Thou who do Men (as Nights to Colors do)
Bring all to an Equality:
Come thou just God, and equal me
A while to my disdainful She;
In that condition let me ly;
Till Love does the same favor show;
Love equals all a better way then You.
4.
Then never more shall thou be invoakt by me;
Watchful as Spirits, and Gods I Will prove:
Let her but grant, and then will I
Thee and thy Kinsman Death defy.
For betwixt Thee and them that love,
Never will an agreement be;
Thou scorn'st the Unhappy, and the Happy Thee.
Beauty.
1.
BEauty thou wild fantastic Ape,
Who do in every Country change thy shape!
Here black, there brown, here tawny, and there white;
Thou Flatt'rer which complyest with every sight!
Thou Babel, which confounds the Eye,
With unintelligible variety!
Who have no certain when, nor where,
But vary'st still, and do thy self declare
Inconstant, as thy she-Possessours are.
2.
Beauty Loves Scene and Maskerade,
So gay by well-plac'd Lights, and Distance made!
False Coin, with which th'Imposture cheats us still;
The stamp and Color good, but Metal ill!
Which Light or Base we find when we
Weigh by enjoyment and examine Thee!
For though thy Being be but show,
It Is chiefly Night which men to Thee allow:
And choose to enjoy Thee, when Thou least art Thou.
3.
Beauty, Thou Active, Passive Ill!
Which dy'st thy self as fast as thou do kill!
Thou Tulip, who thy stock in paint do wast,
Neither for Physic good, nor Smell, nor Taste.
Beauty whose Flames but Meteors are,
Short-lived and low, though thou would seem a Star,
Who dare not thine own Home descry,
Pretending to dwell richly in the Eye,
When thou, alas, do in the Fancy lie.
4.
Beauty, whose Conquests still are made
Over Hearts by Cowards kept, or else betrayed!
Weak Victor! who thy self destroyed must be
When sickness storms, or Time besieges Thee!
Thou'unwholsome Thaw to frozen Age?
Thou strong Wine, which youths Fever do enrage,
Thou Tyrant which leave no man free!
Thou subtle thief, from whom none safe can be!
Thou Murderer which have killed, and Devil which would Damn me.
The Parting.
1.
AS Men in Groen-land left beheld the Sun
From their Horizon run;
And thought upon the sad half year
Of Cold and Darkness they must suffer there.
2.
So on my parting Mistress did I look,
With such swollen eyes my farewell took;
Ah, my fair Star, said I,
Ah those blessed Lands to which bright Thou do fly?
3.
In vain the Men of Learning comfort me;
And say I Am in a warm degree;
Say what they please; I say and swear
It Is be yond eighty at least, if you are not here.
4.
It is, it is; I tremble with the Frost,
And know that I the Day have lost;
And those wild things which Men they call,
I find to be but Bears and Foxes all.
5.
Return, return, gay Planet of the East,
Of all that shines Thou much the best!
And as thou now descends to Sea;
More fair and fresh rise up from thence to Me.
6.
Thou, who in many a Prop'riety
So truly art the Sun to Me,
Add one more likeness, which I Am sure you can,
And let Me and my Sun beget a Man.
My Picture.
1.
HEre, take my likeness with you, whilst it is so;
For when from hence you go,
The next Suns rising will behold
Me pale, and lean, and old.
The Man, who did this Picture draw,
Will swear next day my face he never saw
2.
I really believe, within a while,
If you upon this shadow smile,
Your presence will such vigor give,
(Your presence which makes all things live)
And absence so much alter Me,
This will the substance, I the shadow be.
3.
When from your well-wrought Cabinet you take it,
And your bright looks awake it;
Ah be not frighted, if you see
The new sold Picture gaze on Thee,
And hear it breath a sigh or two;
For those are the first things that it will do.
4.
My Rival Image will be then thought blessed,
And laugh at me as dispossessed:
But Thou, who (if I know thee right)
In The substance does not much delight,
Wilt rather send again for Me,
Who then shall but my Pictures Picture be.
The Concealment.
1.
NO; to what purpose should I speak?
No wretched Heart, swell till you break!
She cannot love me if She would;
And to say truth, 'twere pity that she should.
No, to the Grave thy sorrows bear,
As silent as they will be there:
Since that loved hand this Mortal wound does give,
So handsomely the thing contrive,
That she may guiltless of it live.
So perish, that her killing Thee
May a chance Medley, and no Murder be.
2.
It Is nobler much for me that I
By'her Beauty, not her Anger dye;
This will look justly, and become
An Execution, that, a Martyrdom.
The censuring World will never refrain
From judging men by Thunder slain.
She must be angry sure, if I should be
So bold to ask her to make me
By being hers, happier then she
I will not; it is a milder Fate
To fall by her not Loving, then her Hate.
And yet this death of mine, I fear,
Will ominous to her appear:
When, sound in every other part,
Her Sacrifice is found without an Heart.
For the last Tempest of my death
Shall sigh out that too with my breath.
Then shall the world my noble ruin see,
Some pity, and some envy Me,
Then She her self, the mighty She
Shall grace my fun'ralls with this truth;
'Twas only Love destroyed the gentle Youth.
The Monopoly.
1.
WHat Mines of Sulphur in my breast do lie,
That feed the eternal burnings of my heart?
Not Aetna flames more fierce or constantly,
The sounding shop of Vulcans smoky art;
Vulcan his shop has placed there,
And Cupids Forge is set up here.
2.
Here all those Arrows mortal Heads are made,
That fly so thick unseen through yielding air;
The Cyclops here, which labor at the trade
Are Jealousy, Fear, Sadness, and Despair.
Ah cruel God! and why to me
Gave you this cursed Monopoly!
3.
I have the trouble not the gains of it;
Give me but the disposal of one Dart;
And then (I Will ask no other benefit)
Heat as you please your furnace in my Heart.
So sweet's Revenge to me, that I
Upon my foe would gladly dye.
4.
Deep into'her bosom would I strike the dart;
Deeper then Woman ere was struck by Thee;
Thou giv'st them small wounds, and so far from The Heart,
They flutter still about inconstantly.
Curse on thy Goodness, whom we find
Civil to none but Womankind!
5.
Vain God! who women do thy self adore!
Their wounded Hearts do still retain the powers
To travail and to wander as before;
Thy broken Arrows 'twixt that Sex and ours
So'unjustly are distributed;
They take their Feathers, we the Head.
The distance.
1.
I'Have followed thee a year at least,
And never stopped my self to rest.
But yet can thee overtake no more,
Then this Day can the Day that went before.
2.
In this our fortunes equal prove
To Stars which govern them above;
Our Stars that move for ever round
With the same Distance still betwixt them found.
3.
In vain, alas, in vain I strive
The wheel of Fate faster to drive;
Since if round swiftlier it fly,
She in it mends her pace as much as I.
4.
Hearts by Love strangely shufled are,
That there can never meet a Pare!
Tamelier then Worms are Lovers slain;
The wounded Heart never turns to wound again.
The Increase.
1.
I Thought I Will swear I could have loved no more
Then I had done before;
But you as easily might account
'Till to the topp of numbers you amount,
As cast up my Loves score.
Ten thousand millions was the sum;
Millions of endless Millions are to come.
2.
I Am sure her Beauties cannot greater grow;
Why should my Love do so?
A real cause at first did move;
But mine own Fancy now drives on my Love,
With shadows from it self that flow.
My Love, as we in Numbers see,
By Ciphers is encreast eternally.
3.
So the new made, and untride Spears above
Took their first turn from the hand of Jove;
But are since that beginning found
By their own Forms to turn for ever round.
All violent Motions short do prove,
But by the length it is plain to see
That Love's a Motion Natural to Me.
Loves Visibility.
1.
WIth much of pain, and all the Art I knew
Have I endeavored hitherto
To hide my Love, and yet all will not do.
2.
The world perceives it, and, it may be, she;
Though so discreet and good she be,
By hiding it, to teach that skill to Me.
3.
Men without Love have so often cunning grown,
That something like it they have shown,
But none that had it ever seemed to have none.
4.
Loves of a strangely open, simple kind,
Can no arts or disguises find,
But thinks none sees it, cause it self is blind.
5.
The very Eye betraies our inward smart;
Love of himself left there a part,
When through it he past into the Heart.
6.
Or if by chance the face betray not it,
But keep the secret wisely, yet,
Like Drunkenness, into the Tongue it will get.
Looking on, and discoursing with his Mistress.
1.
THese full two hours now have I gazing been,
What comfort by it can I gain?
To look on Heaven with mighty Gulfes between
Was the great Misers greatest pain:
So near was he to Heavens delight,
As with the blessed converse he might,
Yet could not get one drop of water by it.
2.
Ah wretch: I seem to touch her now, but, oh,
What boundless spaces do us part?
Fortune, and Friends, and all earths empty show,
My Lowness, and her high Desert:
But these might conquerable prove:
Nothing does me so far remove,
As her hard Souls aversion from my Love.
3.
So Travelers that lose their way by Night,
If from a far they chance t'espy
The Uncertain glimmerings of a Tapers light,
Take flatterring hopes and think it nigh;
Till wearied with the fruitless pain,
They sit them down, and weep in vain,
And there in Darkness and Despair remain.
Resolved to Love.
1.
I Wonder what the Grave and Wise
Think of all us that Love;
Whether our pretty Fooleries
Their Mirth or Anger move;
They understand not Breath, that Words do want;
Our Sighs to them are unsignificant.
2.
One of them saw me the other day,
Touch the dear hand which I admire;
My Soul was melting strait away,
And dropped before the Fire.
This silly Wiseman, who pretends to know,
Ask't why I looked so pale, and trembled so?
3.
Another from my Mistresse' door*
Saw me with eyes all watery come;
Nor could the hidden cause explore,
But thought some smoke was in the room;
Such Ignorance from unwounded Learning Game;
He knew Tears made by Smoke, but not by Flame.
4.
If learned in other things you be,
And have in Love no skill,
For Gods sake keep your arts from me,
For I Will be ignorant still.
Study or Action others may embrace;
My Love's my Business, and my Books her Face.
5.
These are but trifles I confess,
Which me, weak Mortal, move;
Nor is your busy Seriousness
Less trifling then my Love.
The wisest King who from his sacred breast
Pronounced all Vanity, chose it for the best.
My Fate.
1.
GO bid the Needle his dear North forsake,
To which with trembling reve'rence it does bend;
Go bid the Stones a journey upward make;
Go bid the ambitious Flame no more t'ascend:
And when these false to their old Motions prove,
Then shall I cease Thee, Thee alone to Love.
2.
The fast-link'd Chain of everlasting Fate
Does nothing ty more strong, then Me to You;
My fixed Love hangs not on your Love or Hate;
But will be still the same, what ere you do.
You cannot kill my Love with your disdain,
Wound it you may, and make it live in pain.
3.
Me, mine examples let the Stoiks use,
Their sad and cruel doctrine to maintain,
Let all Predestinators me produce,
Who struggle with eternal bonds in vain.
This Fire I Am born to, but it is she must tell,
Whether't be beams of Heaven, or Flames of Hell.
4.
You who men's fortunes in their faces read,
To find out mine, look not, alas, on Me;
But mark her Face, and all the Features heed;
For only there is writ my Destiny.
Or if Stars show it, gaze not on the skies:
But study the Astrol'ogy of her Eyes.
5.
If thou find there kind and propitious ways,
What Mars or Saturn threaten I Will not fear;
I well believe the Fate of mortal days
Is writ in Heaven; but, oh, my Heaven is there.
What can men learn from Stars, they scarce can see?
Two great Lights rule the World, and her two, Me.
The Heartbreaking.
1.
IT gave a pittious groan, and so it broke;
In vain it something would have spoke:
The Love within too strong for it was,
Like Poison put into a Venice Glass.
2.
I thought that this some Remedy might prove,
But, oh, the mighty Serpent Love,
Cut by this chance in pieces small,
In all still lived, and still it stung in all.
3.
And now (alas) each little broken part
Feels the whole pain of all my Heart:
And every smallest corner still
Lives with that torment which the Whole did kill.
4.
Even so rude Armies when the field they quit,
And into several Quarters get;
Each Troop does spoil and ruin more,
Then all joined in one body did before.
5.
How many Loves reign in my bosom now?
How many Loves, yet all of you?
Thus have I changed with evil fate
My Monarch Love, into a Tyrant State.
The Usurpation.
1.
THou'hadst to my Soul no title or pretense;
I was mine own and free,
Till I had given my self to Thee;
But thou have me Slave and Prisoner since.
Well, since so insolent you are grown,
Fond Tyrant, I Will depose thee from thy Throne;
Such outrages must not admitted be
In an Elective Monarchy.
2.
Part of my Heart by Gift did to Thee fall;
My Country, Kindred, and my best
Acquaintance were to share the rest;
But thou, their Covetous Neighbor, drav'st out all:
Nay more, thou make me worship Thee,
And would the rule of my Religion be:
Was ever Tyrant claimed such power as you,
To be both Emperor, and Pope too?
3.
The public Mise'ries, and my private fate
Deserve some tears: but greedy Thou
Insatiate Maid!) wilt not allow
That I one drop from thee should alienate.
Nor will thou grant my sins a part,
Though the sole cause of most of them thou art,
Counting my Tears thy Tribute and thy Due,
Since first mine Eyes I gave to You
4.
Thou all my Joys, and all my Hopes do claim,
Thou ragest like a Fire in me,
Converting all things into Thee;
Naught can resist, or not increase the Flame.
Nay every Grief, and every Fear
Thou do devour, unless thy stamp it bear.
Thy presence like the crowned Basilisks breath,
All other Serpents puts to death.
5.
As men in Hell are from Diseases free,
So from all other ills am I;
Free from their known Formality.
But all pains eminently lie in Thee.
Alas, alas, I hope in vain
My conquered Soul from out thine hands to gain,
Since all the Natives there thou'ast overthrown,
And planted Garrisons of thine own.
Maidenhead.
1.
THou worst Estate even of the sex that is worst;
Therefore by Nature made at first,
To Attend the weakness of our birth!
Slight, outward Curtain to the Nuptial Bed!
Thou Case to buildings not yet finished*
Who like the Center of the Earth,
Do heaviest things attract to thee,
Though Thou a point imaginary be.
2.
A thing God thought for Mankind so unfit,
That his first blessing ruined it.
Cold frozen Nurse of fiercest fires!
Who, like the parched plains of Africks sand,
(A sterill, and a wild unlovely Land)
Art always scorcht with hot desires,
Yet barren quite did thou not bring
Monsters and Serpents forth thy self to sting!
3.
Thou that bewitchest men, whilst thou do dwell
Like a close Conj'urer in his Cell!
And fear the days discovering Eye!
No wonder it is at all that thou should be
Such tedious and unpleasant company,
Who liv'st so Melancholy!
Thou thing of subtle, slippery kind,
Which Women lose, and yet no Man can find!
4.
Although I think thou never found wilt be,
Yet I Am resolved to search for thee;
The search it self rewards the pains,
So, though the Chymick his great secret miss,
(For neither it in Art nor Nature is)
Yet things well worth his toil he gains:
And does his Charge and Labor richly pay
With good unsought exper'iments by the way.
5.
Say what thou will, Chastity is no more,
Thee, then a Porter is his Door.
In vain to honor they pretend
Who guard themselves with Ramparts and with Walls,
Them only Fame the truly valiant calls
Who can an open breach depend.
Of thy quick loss can be no doubt,
Within so Hated, and so Loved without.
Impossibilities.
1.
IMpossibilities? oh no, there is none;
Could mine bring thy Heart Captive home;
As easily other dangers were overthrown,
As Caesar after vanquished Rome,
His little Asian foes did overcome.
2.
True Lovers often by Fortune are envied,
Often Earth and Hell against them strive;
But Providence engages on their side,
And a good end at last does give;
At last Just Men and Lovers always thrive.
3.
As stars (not powerful else) when they conjoyn,
Change, as they please, the Worlds estate;
So thy Heart in Conjunction with mine
Shall our own fortunes regulate;
And to the Stars themselves prescribe a Fate.
4.
'Twould grieve me much to find some bold Romance
That should too kind examples show,
Which before us in wonders did advance;
Not, that I thought that story true,
But none should Fancy more, then I would Do.
5.
Through spite of our worst Enemies, thy Friends,
Through Local Banishment from me;
Through the loud thoughts of selfe-concerning Ends,
As easy shall my passage be,
As was the Am'orous Youth's ore Helles Sea.
6.
In vain the Winds, in vain the Billows roar;
In vain the Stars their aid denied:
He saw the Sestian Tower on the other shore;
Shall th'Hellespont our Loves divide?
No, not th'Atlantick Oceans bound less Tide.
7.
Such Seas betwixt us easily conquered are;
But, gentle Maid, do not deny
To let thy Beams shine on me from afar;
And still that Taper let me 'espy:
For when thy Light goes out, I sink, and dye.
Silence.
1.
CUrse on this Tongue that has my Heart betrayed,
And his great Secret open laid!
For of all persons chiefly She,
Should not the ills I suffer know;
Since 'dis a thing might dangerous grow,
Only in her to Pity Me:
Since it is for Me to lose my Life more fit,
Then it is for her to save and ransom it.
2.
Ah never more shall thy unwilling ear,
My helpless story hear.
Discourse and talk away does keep
The rude unquiet pain,
That in my Breast does reign;
Silence perhaps may make it sleep.
I Will bind that Sore up, I did ill reveal;
The Wound if once it Close, may chance to Heal.
3.
No, 'twill nere heal; my Love will never dye,
Though it should Speechless lie.
A River ere it meet the Sea,
As well might stay its source,
As my Love can his course,
Unless it join and mix with Thee.
If any end or stop of it be found,
We know the Flood runs still, though underground.
The Dissembler.
1.
UNhurt, untoucht did I complain;
And terrified all others with the pain:
But now I feel the mighty evil;
Ah, there is no fooling with the Devil!
So wanton men, whilst others they would fright,
Themselves have met a real Spright.
2.
I thought, I Will swear, an handsomely
Had been no sin at all in Poetry:
But now I suffer an Arrest
For words were spoke by me in jest.
Dull, sottish God of Love, and can it be
Thou understand'st not Raillerie?
3.
Darts, and Wounds, and Flame, and Heat,
I named but for the Rhyme, or the Conceit.
Nor meant my verse should raised be
To this sad fame of Prophecy;
Truth gives a Dull Propriety to my style,
And all the Metaphors does spoil.
4.
In things, where Fancy much does reign,
It Is dangerous too cunningly to feign.
The Play at last a Truth does grow,
And Custom into Nature go.
By this cursed art of begging I became
Lame with counterfeiting Lame.
5.
My Lines of amorous desire
I wrote to kindle and blow others fire:
And 'twas a barbarous delight
My Fancy promise'd from the sight;
But now, by Love, the mighty Phalaris, I
My burning Bull the first do try.
The Inconstant.
1.
I Never yet could see that face
Which had no dart for me;
From fifteen years to fifties space
They all victorious be.
Love you are a Dev'ill; if I may call thee One,
For sure in Me thy name is Legion.
2.
Color, or Shape, good Limbs, or Fate,
Goodness or Wit in all I find.
In Motion or in Speech a grace,
If all fail, yet it is Womankind;
And I Am so weak, the Pistol need not be
Double or treble charged to murder Me.
3.
If Tall, the Name of Proper slays;
If fair, she is pleasant as the Light;
If Low, her Prettiness does please;
If Black, what Lover loves not Night?
If yellow hair'd, I Love, lest it should be
The excuse to others for not loving Me.
4.
The Fat, like Plenty, fills my heart;
The Lean, with Love makes me too so,
If Straight, her Body's Cupids Dart
To me, if Crooked, it is his Bow.
Nay Age it self does me to rage incline,
And strength to Women gives, as well as Wine.
5.
Just half as large as Charity
My richly-landed Love's become;
And judged aright is Constancy,
Though it take up a larger room:
Him, who loves always one, why should they call
More Constant, then the Man loves Always All?
6.
Thus with unwearied wings I flee
Through all Loves Gardens and his Fields;
And, like the wise industrious Be,
No Weed, but Honey to me yields!
Honey still spent this diligence still supplies,
Though I return not home with laden Thighs.
7.
My Soul at first instead did prove
Of pretty strength against a Dart,
Till I this Habit got of Love;
But my consumed and wasted Heart
Once burnt to Tinder with a strong Desire,
Since that by every Spark is set on Fire.
The Constant.
1.
GReat, and wise Conqueror, who where ere
Thou come, do fortify, and settle there!
Who cavst defend as well as get;
And never had one Quarter beat up yet;
Now thou art in, Thou nere wilt part
With one inch of my vanquished Heart:
For since thou took'st it by assault from Me,
It Is garrisoned so strong with thoughts of Thee,
It fears no beauteous Enemy.
2.
Had thy charming strength been less,
I'had served ere this an hundred Mistresses.
I Am better thus, and would compound
To leave my Pris'on to be a Vagabound.
A Pris'on in which I still would be,
Though every door stood open to Me,
In spite both of thy Coldness and thy Pride,
All Love is Marriage on thy Lovers side,
For only Death can them divide.
3.
Close Narrow Chain, yet soft and kind,
As that which Spir'its above to good does bind!
Gentle and sweet Necessity,
Which does not force, but guide our Liberty!
Your Love on Me were spent in vain,
Since my Love still could but remain
Just, as it is; for what alas can be
Added to that which has Infinity
Both in Extent and Quality.
Her Name.
1.
WIth more then Jewish Reverence as yet
Do I the Sacred Name conceal;
When, ye kind Stars, ah when will it be fit
His Gentle Myst'ery to reveal?
When will our Love be Named, and we possess
That Christning as a Badge of Happiness?
2.
So bold as yet no verse of mine has been
To wear that Gemme on any Line;
Nor, till the happy Nuptial Muse be seen,
Shall any Stanza with it shine.
Rest mighty Name, till then; for thou must be
Laid down: by her, e're taken up by Me.
3.
Then all the fields and woods shall with it ring;
Then Echoes burden it shall be;
Then all the Birds in several notes shall sing,
And all the Rivers murmur Thee;
Then ever'y wind the Sound shall upwards bear,
And softly whisper't to some Angels Ear.
4.
Then shall thy Name through all my Verse be spread,
Thick as the flowers in Meadowsly,
And, when in future times they shall be read,
(As sure, I think, they will not die)
If any Critic doubt that they be mine,
Men by that Stamp shall quickly know the Coin.
5.
Mean while I will not dare to make a Name
To represent thee by,
Adam (Gods Nomenclator) could not frame
One that enough should signify.
Astraea'or Caelia as unfit would prove
For Thee, as it is to call the Di'ety Jove.
Weeping.
1.
SEe where she sits, and in what comely wise
Drops Tears more fair then others Eyes:
Ah, charming Maid, let not ill Fortune see
The attire thy sorrow wears,
Nor know the beauty of thy Tears;
For she will still come to dress her self in Thee.
2.
As stars reflect on waters, so I soye
In every drop (me thinks her Eye.
The Baby, which lies there, and always plays
In that illustrious sphere,
Like a Narcissus does appear,
Whilst in his flood the lovely Boy did gaze.
3.
Nere yet did I behold so glorious weather,
As this Sunshine and Rain together.
Pray Heaven her Forehead, that pure Hill of Snow
(For some such Fountain we must find
To waters of so fair a kind)
Melt not, to feed that beauteous stream below.
4.
Ah, mighty Love, that it were inward Heat
Which made this precious Lymbeck sweat!
But what, alas, ah what does it avail
That she weeps Tears so wondrous cold
As scarce the Asses hoof can hold,
So cold, that I admire they fall not Hail.
Discretion.
1.
DIscreet? what means this word Discreet?
A Curse on all Discretion!
This barbarous term you will not meet
In all Loves Lexicon.
2.
Jointure, Portion, Gold, Estate,
Houses, Household-stuffe, or Land,
(The Low Conveniences of Fate)
Are Greek no Lovers understand.
3.
Believe me, beauteous one, when Love
Enters into a breast,
The two first things it does remove,
Are Friends and Interest.
4.
Passion's half blind, nor can endure
The careful, scrup'lous Eyes,
Or else I could not love, I Am sure*
One who in Love were wise.
5.
Men, in such tempests tossed about,
Will without grief or pain,
Cast all their goods and riches out,
Themselves their Port to gain.
6.
As well might Martyrs, who do choose
That sacred Death to take,
More for the Clothes, which they must loose,
When they are bound naked to the Stake.
The Wayting-Maide. (Suspected to Love her.)
1.
THy Maid? ah, find some nobler theme
Whereon thy doubts to place;
Nor by a low suspect blaspheme
The glories of thy face.
2.
Alas, she makes Thee shine so fair,
So exquisitely bright,
That her dim Lamp must disappeare
Before thy potent Light.
3.
Three hours each morn in dressing Thee
Maliciously are spent;
And make that Beauty Tyranny,
That Is else a Civil Government.
4.
The'adorning thee with so much art
Is but a barb'arous skill;
It Is like the poys'ning of a Dart
Too apt before to kill.
5.
The Min'istring Angels none can see;
It Is not their beauty' or face,
For which by men thy worshipped be;
But their high office and their place*
Thou art my Goddess, my Saint, She;
I pray to Her, only to pray to Thee.
Council.
1.
AH! what advice can I receive?
No, satisfy me first;
For who would Physic potions give
To one that dies with Thirst?
2.
A little puff of breath we find
Small fires can quench and kill,
But when they are great, the adverse wind,
Does make them greater still.
3.
Now whilst you speak, it moves me much;
But strait I Am just the same;
Alas the effect must needs be such
Of Cutting through a Flame.
The Cure.
1.
COme, Doctor, use thy roughest art
Thou can not cruel prove;
Cut, burn, and Torture every part,
To heal me of my Love.
2.
There is no danger if the pain
Should me to a Fever bring;
Compared with Heats I now sustain,
A Feavour is so Cool a thing,
(Like drink which feverish men desire)
That I should hope 'twould almost quench my Fire.
The separation.
1.
Ask me not what my Love shall do or be
(Love which is Soul to Body, and Soul of Me)
When I am sepa'rated from thee;
Alas I might as easily show,
What after Death the Soul will do;
'Twill last, I Am sure, and that is all we know.
2.
The thing called soul will never stir nor move,
But all that while a livelesse Carcass prove,
For it is the Body of my Love;
Not that my Love will fly away,
But still continue, as, they say,
Sad troubled Ghosts about their Graves do stray.
The Tree.
1.
I Close the flour'ishingst Tree in all the Park,
With freshest Boughs and fairest head;
I cut my Love into his gentle Bark,
And in three days, behold, it is dead?
My very written Flames so vi'olent be,
They'have burnt and withere'd up the Tree.
2:
How should I live my self, whose Heart is found,
Deeply graven every where
With the large History of many a wound,
Larger then thy Trunk can bear?
With art as strange, as Homer in the Nut,
Love in my Heart has Volumes put.
3.
What a few words from thy rich stock did take
The Leaves and Beauties all?
As a strong Poison with one drop does make
The Nails and Hairs to fall:
Love (I see now) a kind of Witchcraft is,
For Characters could nere do this.
4.
Pardon ye Birds and Nymphs who loved this Shade;
And pardon me, thou gentle Tree;
I thought her name would thee have happy made,
And blessed Omens hoped from Thee;
Notes of my Love, thrive here (said I) and grow;
And with ye let my Love do so.
5.
Alas poor youth, thy love will never thrive!
This blasted Tree predestines it;
Go tie the dismal Knot (why should thou live?
And by the Lines thou there have writ
Deform'dly hanging, the sad Picture be
To that unlucky History.
Her Unbelief.
1.
It Is a strange kind of Ignorance this in you!
That you your Victories should not spy,
Victories gotten by your Eye!
That your bright beams, as those of Comets do,
Should kill, but not know How, nor Who.
2.
That truly you my Idol might appear,
Whilst all the People smell and see
The odorous flames, I offer thee,
Thou sit'st, and do not see, nor smell, nor hear
Thy constant zealous worshipper.
3.
They see it too well who at my fires repine;
Nay th 'unconcern'd themselves do prove
Quick-Ey'd enough to spy my Love;
Nor does the Cause in thy Face clearelier shine,
Then the Effect appears in mine.
4.
Fair Infidel! by what unjust decree
Must I, who with such restless care
Would make this truth to thee appear,
Must I, who preach it, and pray for it, be
Damned by thy incredulity?
2.
I by thy Unbelief am guiltless slain;
Oh have but Faith, and then that you
May know that Faith for to be true,
It shall it self by'a Miracle maintain,
And raise me from the Dead again.
3.
Mean while my Hopes may seem to be orethrowne*
But Lovers Hopes are full of Art,
And thus dispute, that since my Heart
Though in thy Breast, yet is not by thee known,
Perhaps thou may not know thine Own.
Love given over.
1.
IT is enough; enough of time, and pain
Have thou consumed in vain;
Leave, wretched Cowley, leave
Thy self with shadows to deceave;
Think that already lost which thou must never gain.
2.
Three of thy lustiest and freshest years,
(Post in storms of Hopes and Fears)
Like helpless Ships that be
Set on fire 'ith midst of the Sea,
Have all been burnt in Love, and all been drowned in Tears.
1.
Resolve then on it, and by force or art
Free thy unlucky Heart;
Since Fate does disapprove
The ambition of thy Love,
And not one Star in heave'n offers to take thy part.
4.
If ere I clear my Heart from this desire,
If ere it home to'his breast retire,
It nere shall wander more about,
Though thousand beauties called it out:
A Lover Burnt like me for ever dreads the fire.
5.
The Poet, the Plague, and every small disease,
May come as often as ill Fate please;
But Death and Love are never found
To give a Second Wound,
Wee're by those Serpents bit, but wee'redevour'd by these.
6.
Alas, what comfort ist' that I am grown*
Secure of be'ing again orethrowne;
Since such an Enemy needs not fear
Least any else should quarter there,
Who has not only Sacked, but quite burnt down the Town.
TO THE READER.
IN stead of the Authors Picture in the beginning, I thought sit to fix here
this following Copy of Verses, being his own illustration of his Motto, and
(as I conceive) the more lively representation of him.

Tentanda vita est qua me quoque possim
Tollere humo victorque virum volitare per ora.
WHat shall I do to be for ever known,
And make the Age to come my own?
I shall like Beasts or Common people die,
Unless you write mine Elegy;
While others great by being borne are grown;
Their Mothers Labor not their own.
In this Scale Gold, in the other Fame does ly;
The weight of that mounts this so high.
These men are fortunes Jewels, molded bright;
Brought forth with their own fire and light.
If I, her vulgar stone, for either look;
Out of my self it must be struck.
Yet I must on; what sound ist' strikes mine ear?
Sure I Fames Trumpet hear.
It sounds like the last Trumpet; for it can
Raise up the buried Man.
Unpast Alps stop me, but I Will cut through all;
And march, the Muses Hanniball.
Hence all ye flattering Vanities that lay
Nets of Roses in the way.
Hence the desire of Honors or Estates;
And all, that is not above Fate.
Hence Love himself, that Tyrant of my days,
Which intercepts my coming Praise.
Come my best Friends, my Books, and lead me on;
It Is time that I were gone.
Welcome great Stagirite, and teach me now
All I was borne to know.
Thy Scholars Vict'ories thou do far out-doe;
He conquered th'Earrh, the whole World you.
Welcome learned Cicero, whose blessed Tongue and Wit
Preserves Romes Greatness yet.
Thou art the first of Or'atours, only he
Who best can praise thee, next must be.
Welcome the Mantuan Swan, Virgil the wise;
Whose Verse walks highest, but not flies,
Who brought green Po'esie to her perfect age;
And made that Art, which was a Rage.
Tell me, ye mighty Three, what shall I do
To be like one of you?
But you have climbed the Mountain's top, there sit
On the calm flourishing head of it,
And whilst with wearied steps we upward go,
See us, and Clouds below.
FINIS.
