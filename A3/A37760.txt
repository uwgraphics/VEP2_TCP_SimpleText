A most Complete COMPENDIUM OF GEOGRAPHY, GENERAL and SPECIAL; Describing all
the Empires, Kingdoms, and Dominions, IN THE Whole WORLD. Showing their Bounds,
Situation, Dimensions, Ancient and Modern Names, History, Government,
Religions, Languages, Commodities, Divisions, Subdivisions, Cities, Rivers,
Mountains, Lakes, with their Archbishopricks, and Universities. In a more Plain
and Easy Method, more Compendious, and (perhaps) more Useful than any of this
bigness. To which are added, General Rules for making a large GEOGRAPHY Very
necessary for the right Understanding of the Transactions of these Times.
Collected according to the most late Discoveries, and agreeing with the
choicest and newest MAPS. By LAVRENCE EACHARD, of Christ's-Colledge in
Cambridge.

London: Printed for Thomas Salusbury at the Sign of the Temple near Temple Bar
in Fleet Street. 1691.

To the Reverend and truly Learned Dr. JOHN COVEL, Chancellor of YORK, AND
MASTER OF CHRIST-COLLEDGE IN CAMBRIDGE.
Reverend Sir,
WHen you first find your Name prefixed to this Book, you will no less marvel
at my Boldness than Folly; but the Right of Dedication, which every Scribler
assumes to himself, may in some measure save me harmless; and your Goodness,
which truly knows how to pardon the rash Attempts of Youth, has animated me to
shelter this small Trifle under the Patronage of your Name. I will not go about
to extenuate my Crime, by such fulsome Panegyricks as Dedications are usually
stuffed withal; for those are the common Badges of mercenary Pens, which too
often betray the Wit as well as the Integrity of such Writers. I do not pretend
in the least to better your Understanding by this small Compendium, or to add
any thing to the knowledge of a Person who is already so well acquainted with
the World, and has seen so many famous Countries: Neither do I make use of your
Name to avoid (the common Fate of Young Writers) Envy, for to be thought worthy
of that, shall be my greatest Glory; but chiefly because the Name of so Eminent
a Patron may give the greater encouragement to others, and that this Science
may be the more esteemed in our University; and lastly, that I may let the
World know how much I am honored by publishing my self

Your most humble and devoted Servant, LAU. EACHARD.

THE PREFACE.
THere is no Man, I believe, can with very much Reason find fault with the
Subject of this Book, being so noble and useful; for this is a Science which is
most perfectly adorned with all the Beauties that may create delight, and
satisfy the curious, so that it needs no Vindication. The Book it self I am
afraid will be condemned by the more nice sort of Persons, when they first see
it, who will perhaps look upon it as superfluous, and altogether useless, since
there have been already so many excellent Books both small and great of this
kind. To answer this perhaps will not be thought so agreeable to true modesty;
but howsoever I shall take leave to say thus much of it, and that without any
sort of vanity. That I have never met with any yet, that have used a more exact
Method, or have kept so close to their Method as this, neither do I know of any
that have been so particular in the Sub-divisions and Soveraignties as this.

I am truly sensible that several worthy Persons who heard of my design of
putting out a Geography, have censured me as to bold an Undertaker after so
many accurate Pens, but the Judgment of these Persons may well be suspected,
since they were so very little acquainted with my Studies, and not at all with
my Book. For my part, I had so little esteem of it my self as to have kept it
wholly for my own private use, for which it was first designed; neither would I
ever have ventured my Reputation (which as yet is very tender) among so many
Critics, if I had not two several times been encouraged by Mr. Neuton (most
deservedly) our Mathematick Professor, (a Person whose judgment and skill is so
well known as not to be disputed) who approved of the Method and Brevity when
it was much less perfect than it is now, and said, That he did not see how a
General Geography so full, could be easily brought into less room. The first
time he saw it, he did me the Honor to correct several Faults with his own
Hand.

As to the Method in every Country, I first begin with the Bounds, Situation,
Dimensions, from named Places, Ancient and Modern Names; then the Historical
part, with the present Government; then I name the Religion, Language, and
Commodities, with the chief place of the whole. After this I come to the
particular Provinces. When they are over, I mention all the chief Rivers,
Mountains, and Lakes; with the number of the Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops,
and Universities. As for the Provinces themselves, I have been very careful to
set them in such order as they may be most easily found in Maps, beginning with
the most Northern, N. Eastern, or N. Western Province (so likewise on the
Sub-divisions); then naming that which lies next to it, so that one cannot well
be mistaken. I have also given all their Dimensions, Situations, Sub-divisions
and Soveraignties, and giving them their proper Titles, as Dukedom, Earldom,
etc. with all their chief Towns, or Cities. This Method I have used in every
particular Country, as much as the Subject would permit.

I have all the way intermixed the old Geography with the new, not only in
every Country, but in every Province where I could, though it is done with so
much brevity, it may easily be understood. I have been very curious in the
distinguishing the one from the other, and giving the true extent of the old
Provinces, and have discovered several faults which are often committed by many
Geographers, as making Hetruria the same with Tuscany, Latium, the same with
Campania de Roma; Liguria the same with the State of Genoa, Helvetia the same
with Switzerland, etc. Also some other faults, in not distinguishing the old
Albania from the new, the old Persia from the new, etc. these are faults which
by many others have been little observed, therefore I took the more care to
correct them.

As for the length and breadth of the Countries and Provinces (the truth of
which, I am afraid, will be scrupled by several) they are made according to no
Book whatsoever, but wholly according to Maps, and those the best and newest I
could procure, which were for the most part De Wits, Vischer's, Sanson's, and
Berry's, in these I have found no very considerable difference in the Provinces
of Europe. I would not have the Reader expect the true Dimensions of every
Province to a mile, for no Maps are so exact, especially in Asia, Africa, and
America, where they are seldom without great faults: neither would I have him
count it a fault, if by chance in measuring I have mistaken one mile in twenty.
Though these Dimensions are designed (I mean those of the inferior Provinces)
rather as an Ornament to complete this Book, or rather to show a way to others;
yet I have taken such care that there should be no considerable fault, but what
must be attributed wholly to the Maps.

The Miles that I have made use of are exactly the 60th part of a Degree in the
Equator, which are somewhat larger than our measured miles (for those are
found to be about the 69th part of a Degree) agreeing for the most part with
our vulgar counted Miles; so that France, Spain, Italy, Germany, etc. will be
found to be somewhat less in this than in most other Geographies. Another thing
I must advertize the Reader, which is concerning Longitude, mentioned in the
Situation of every Country; that in all the Countries in Europe and Asia, I
have reckoned the Longitude from Teneriffe, one of the Canary Isles, according
to F. de Wit's Maps; but in Africa and America, (because Sanson's and Berry's
Maps were so, who were my chiefest Guide in those parts) I have reckoned the
Longitude from Ferro, another of the Canary Isles, just two Degrees West of
Teneriffe.

I am afraid that I have made the Preface too large for the Book, yet before I
make an end, I must desire the impartial Reader to consider it thoroughly before
he condemn it, and if it does not perform what it promises, I do with all
modesty submit my self to the judgment of the Ingenious; for to those Persons
Nature has commonly given a Soul so truly noble and generous, as will never
insult over the weakness of a yielding Person, nor too much discourage the good
Intentions of a young Writer. In short, if there be any Person whatsoever that
shall find half as much profit or pleasure in the Reading of this Book, as I
have in the Writing, I shall count it a Reward much beyond the meanness of my
deserts.

ADVERTISEMENT.
THE Reader is desired to take Notice, That E. W. N. and S. stands for East,
West, North, and South; chapter T. for chief Town or City; l. and br. for long and
broad; m. for miles; an. for anciently; Lon. and Lat. for Longitude and
Latitude; K. D. Mar. Earl. Prin. Bar. Bish. and Ter. for Kingdom, Dukedom,
Marquisate, Earldom, Principalities, Barony, Bishopric, and Territory.

These Verses were sent to the Publisher by one who, it seems, had seen my
Book, and says (in his Letter) they were designed only for a Vindication.
Notwithstanding I had refused several Copies of Verses before, I should now
prove my self very ungrateful to refuse the kind proffers of one who has shown
himself so modestly Ingenious; therefore I have published them, not out of
vanity, but as a mark of gratitude.

To his Worthy Friend, the Author of this ensuing Treatise.
SIR,
EXpect not now those high-flown towering strains
(Which, as 'twas, in a Trance enslave Men's Brains)
TO enhance the useful Art, your skill or pains:
No; what a stumbling Muse, or Love imparts
Led by the influence of your dear Deserts,
Here you may find; nor dare I hope to raise
A brighter Luster to its native Praise.
As painful Bees over spacious Fields do roam,
With laden Sweets come to their welcome Home,
And there dispose them in the Honey comb;
So you great Volumes rack, to find what is true,
And in a Method most concise, yet new,
Lay out those Treasures to a Public view.
Drake's Ship though bigger than this little spot,
Yet never past more Seas, more knowledge got,
Though a far greater loss of time was there,
For what is an Hour now, was then a Year*
Nay Life perhaps fat trembling at Death's Door.
Whilst fearless here we ransack all your store:
So what can grateful Man desire more?
Methinks Geography would be enough,
To give the snarling World a generous proof
How it deserves; for surely all would know
The Figure, Form, and State of Things below.
But when with you so regular we pass,
No cooling Rub over all the extended Mass.
Good God! what brutish Animals are those,
Would not such precious Secrets here disclose,
Would not admire and praise the brave Design,
The World encompast in one small Machine?
Regiomontan's Eagle could not vie,
With your small Landscape of Geography;
And such like Labors need a greater skill
Which are confined to Rules not wrought at will.
Go on, dear Sir, and as you have begun,
O'review the World, like to the Rising Sun,
Enlight'ning still, whilst we all ought to pray
To your Endeavors, a long Plus ultra.
Yours, ANONYMUS.

A most Complete COMPENDIUM OF GEOGRAPHY, GENERAL and SPECIAL; Describing All
the Empires, Kingdoms, and Dominions, in the Whole WORLD.
GEOGRAPHY is a Science which teaches the Description and Dimensions of the
Earth.

The Earth is situated, according to Ptolomy and Tycho, in the Center of the
World, but according to Copernicus, between the Orbs of Mars and Venus; its
subsistence so wonderful, as may well express that unlimited Power which
performs things infinitely beyond what we can imagine.

It is a Sperical Body, which, together with the Water, make up one Globe, of
so perfect and exact a form, and so beautified and adorned by the God of
Nature, that from the eligancy and beauty thereof, it was called by the Greeks
(...), and by the Latins Mundus.

It is in Circuit 21600 Miles, (allowing 60 to a Degree) its Diameter 6872
Miles, its Superficies in Square Miles 148510584, and its Sollid Content just
169921796242 Cubical Miles.

The Earth may admit of a fourfold Division, Viz. 1. It Is Imaginary Parts. 2.
Its Real Parts. 3. In respect of its Inhabitants. And, 4. Its National Parts.

1. Imaginary Parts.
The Imaginary Parts are only supposed for the better understanding of this
Science, divided into 1. Poles, 2. Circles, 3. Zones, and, 4. Climes.

1. The Poles are the extreme points of the Axis, which is supposed to pass
through the Center of the Earth, and on which it is supposed to move daily
about. They are the furthest distant from the Equator; in number two, viz. the
Artick or North Pole, and the Antartick or South Pole.

2. The Circles are divided into the Greater and Lesser: the Greater divide the
World into two equal parts; in number four, Viz. 1. The Equator, compassing
the Earth equally between (and furthest from) the Poles: when the Sun is here,
the days and nights are equal. 2. The Zodiac, in which is the Ecliptic
cutting the Equator obliquely, through which the Sun passes in a Year. These
two are Immovable. 3. The Horizon, dividing the Visible parts of the Heavens
from the Invisible. 4. The Meridian, dividing the Horizon into two equal parts:
when the Sun is here, it is Noon. These two are Moveable.

The Lesser Circles divide the World into two Unequal Parts; they are 1. The
Tropicks, which terminate the Sun's distance from the Equator, being 23 degr.
and one half from it: when the Sun is in these, it is either Winter or Summer.
They are two, viz. of Cancer on the North, and of Capricorn on the South side
of the Equator. 2. The Polar Circles, 66 degr. and one half of the Equator,
and 23 and one half of the Poles; they are called the Artick and Antartick
Circles. 3. The Parallels, which are parallel to the Equator, set in Maps to
show the Latitude, as the Meridian Lines are to show the Longitude of Places.
(Note, that Latitude is the distance from the Equator, and Longitude from the
first Meridian, made commonly to pass through the Canary Islands.)

3. The Zones are certain spaces of Earth, included between two lesser Circles.
In number five; viz. one Torrid Zone, which lies between the Tropicks; two
Temperate Zones, between the Tropicks and Polar Circles, and two Frigid Zones,
between the Polar Circles and the Poles.

4. A Climate is a space of Earth between two Parallels, in which the longest
day is increased half an hour: As for example, In the first Climate the longest
Day is 12 Hours and a half, in the second Climate 13 Hours, in the third
Climate 13 hours and a half, etc.

2. Real Parts.
The Real Parts of the Earth are such as have a real Existance upon the
Superficies of the Earth. Didived into 1. Water, and 2. Land.

1. Water is divided into 1. Ocean, called a general Collection or Rendezvous
of all Waters, giving bounds to the four Regions of the Earth. 2. Sea, a part
of the Ocean encompassed with Earth, except and straight, such as the
Mediterranian and Baltic. 3. Straight, a part of the Ocean, restrained into
narrow bounds, opening the way to a Sea, as those of Magalanica and Gibralier.
4. Lake, a large space of Water wholly encompassed with Land, as Parima and
Zaire. 5. Creek or Gulf, a crooked Shore, thrusting forth as it were two Arms
to hold the Sea, as those of Venice and Lepanto; Rivers, Brooks, Fountains,

It is famous for the Creation of Man, for the Place of Paradise, for the
Confusion of Tongues, for the Assyrian and Persian Monarchies, for being the
Scene of the Chief Actions recorded in the Scriptures, and more especially for
the Birth of our Savior CHRIST. It now wants much of its ancient greatness.

Religions may be reduced to four Principal Heads, viz. 1. Mahomitan, 2. Pagan,
3. Chri^stian, and, 4. Jewish Religion. The Languages are chiefly four, viz.
Persian, 2. Turkish, divided into Turkish and Tartarian, 3. Arabic, and, 4.

Turkish Language (for the better sort speak the Sclavonian) is originally
Tartarian, intermixed with many Persian, Arabic, Grecian and Italian words.
The Persian and Arabic Tongues are also in much esteem among them.

and the greatest part of Sarmatia Asiatica* with a little of old Persia.



It has remained unconquered under several Governments, till Anno 1162, the
Tartars, an obscure People, overran this Country, and erected a Monarchy,
which still remains, but a good part of it is fallen away. The Emperor is
called, The Great Cham of Tartary; who has also the famous Country of China.
Some part of it is under the Russians; the rest under several independent
Princes. The imperial Seat is at Chambalu, as it is supposed.

The Inhabitants are both Mahomitans and Pagans; in some places all Mahomitans,
in others all Pagans, which seems to be in most esteem. Here are also some
Christians of the Nestorian Sect. Their Language is the Tartarian, very
boisterous and clamerous, almost the same with the Turkish, having some mixture
of Persian and Scithian words. In some places they use the Persian Tongue. The
chief Commodities are Sable, Martins, and other Furs, Silks, Camlets, Flax,
great store of Rhubarb, Musk, Cinnamon, etc. It is divided into five great

parts of Kanduana, about 1750 miles; and in breadth from the N. parts of Cabul
to the S. parts of Guzarat 1240 miles. It contains the greatest part of the
East Indies, with some of old Persia; now often called by the name of Indostan.

It was first conquered by Bacchus, afterward by Alexander the great. We hear
scarce any thing of it till of later Ages it was conquered by the Tartars, who
then erected that Monarchy, which still continues. So that it is now governed
by its own Emperors or Moguls, who are absolute and have vast Revenues,
exceeding the Persian and Turk together. His Imperial Seat is at Agra.

The Inhabitants are many of them Mahomitans of the Turkish Sect, above two
thirds are Gentiles, Banians or Persees; and here are also some Christians,
called Christians of St. Thomas, and several Jews and Jesuits. Their Language a

being in length from the N. parts of Orixa in Golconda, to Cape Comeri in
Malabar, about 1000 miles; in breadth from Narsingapatan to Dabul 490 miles.

We can find but little how it was anciently Governed; but it is at present
under the Government of about fifty several Kings, of which three or four are
greater than the rest, and some parts are under the Europeans, as the
Portuguez, Dutch, and English. The chapter T. of the whole is Goa, under the
Portugals.

The Inhabitants are of several Nations besides the Natives; they are both

borders of Quantung in China about 900 miles: by this account it contains some
of the old Sina.

As for the ancient Government, we can give no certain account; at the present
it is a barbarous Country, dismembered into a great many Estates under their own
Kings and Governors, of which four or five are of considerable note. Besides
these the Portuguez and Dutch have several places on the Coasts. The chapter T. of
all is Pegu.

The Inhabitants are chiefly Idolaters; here are also some Mahomitans on the
Coasts, and some Christians converted by the Jesuits. Their Language in Siam

neighboring Countries, Sanglai; by the Natives, Taine, and Taibinco; and the
Inhabitants, Tanges.

It had its own King for many Ages, (some say above 3000 years) till conquered
by the Tartars; then again it had its own Kings, till of late again conquered
by the Tartars, who still have it; under which are 32 Princes, or petty Kings.
There are also several Princes (says Gabriel Magailans) which own no Superior.
It is (if we may credit the Jesuits Relations) the most famous Country in the
World. The chapter T. is Peking.

The Inhabitants are Gentiles for the most part. Here are also some few
Christians, converted by the Jesuits, but hardly suffered. Their Language
differs from all others, having but 300 Words, and above 50000 Letters; by
which they express their minds with much vivacity and efficacy: they write
right down from the top to the bottom. Their chief Commodities are Gold,
Silver, Precious Stones, Quicksilver, Porcelline Dishes, Silks, Cottons,
Rhubarb, Sugar, Camphire, Civet, Musk, Ginger, China-wood, etc. It contains 15

10. Oriental Islands.
THE Oriental Islands are a vast number of Isles of all sorts, (some say 150000
in number) lying on the E. and S. E. parts of Asia. The Inhabitants are for the
most part Gentiles. The Language in Iapan is one of its own; in Sumatra, Iava,
and Moluccoes, they speak the Malaize. Here are also several other Tongues
little known to us. They are under a great many of their own Kings and Princes:
Also the English, Dutch, Portuguez, Spaniards, and French, have considerable
shares in those parts. They may be divided into, 1. Iapan, on the E. of China,
distant from it 210 miles, being 710 m. l. and 200 br. It contains five

great and potent Prince. Here are also many other lesser Isles which belong to
Iapan; as, 1. Ximo, chapter T. Figen. 2. Xicoum, chapter T. Xiowith; and others of less
note. 2. Philippine Islands, which are a great knot of Isles lying on the S. W.

little Kings, of which he of Candea is chief. 8. The Maldives, a vast number of
very small Islands on the S. W. of Ceilon, chief of which is Male. They are

Thus much for ASIA.
III. AFRICA.
AFRICA has on the North the Mediterranian Sea; on the West, the Atlantic or
Western Ocean; on the South, the Ethiopian or Southern Ocean; on the East, the
Oriental Ocean; and on the N. East, the Red Sea, which with an Isthmus of 110
miles parts it from Asia. It is a Peninsula, and the greatest in the World;
situated between the 3d and the 83d and 30 min. of Lon. and between the 35th
and 30 min. of N. and the 35th and 10 min. of S. Lat. being in length from Cape
Verde in Negroland, to Cape Guadafu in Ajan about 4800 miles; and in breadth

anciently called Hesperia Olympia, Ammonis, Ortygia, Escha^^ca, and Eoriphe,
and now Africa; by the Aethiopians, Alkabulam, and by the Indians, Besecath.

It is greater than Europe, and lesser than Asia, but not so considerable as
either, being in many places full of vast Deserts and unhabitable places, some
parts so little known, that we can give but an uncertain account of them. Here
are also many remarkable Beasts and Birds, not so common in other places, as
Elephants, Crocodiles, Lions, Leopards, etc. The Religions may be reduced to
five general Heads, viz. 1. Mahomitan, 2. Pagan, or Gentilism, 3. Jewish, 4.
Christian, and, 5. Libertinism; the two first are most predominant. The
Languages are chiefly six, viz. 1. Arabic, 2. Hitbissine, 3. Egyptian, 4. that
called Aqueamerig, 5. that called Sungai, and, 6. that called Gubio. The Jews
speak the Chaldean or Syriack.

It is under the Government of three Emperors; viz. Abissina, Morocco, and
Monomo^apa; many inferior Kings; the Turks, who have a considerable part; and
several of the Europeans, as Portuguez, English, Dutch, and French.

and by the Italians and Spaniards, l' Egitto.

It first had its own Kings; conquered by the Persians; soon after by the
Macedonians; then again it had its own Kings; then conquered by the Romans;
afterward by the Saracens; then it had its own Princes again, till at last
wholly conquered by the Turks, who still have it. Governed by a Beglerbog,
residing at Cairo. This, together with the greatest part of Barca, make up that
part of the Turkish Empire which is called the Government of Miser or Cairo.

The Inhabitants are Copti, Moors, Arabians, Turks, Jews and Greeks, and are
chiefly Mahomitans. Here are also some Christians, called Copti, Iacobites in
Sect, but differing from them and all others in many Points. Their Language is

Writing is little different from the ancient Greek. Their chief Commodities are
Sugar, Flax, Rice, all sorts of Grains and Fruits, Linen Cloth, Salt, Balsom,
Butargio, Senna, Cassia, etc. It is divided into four parts, which are, 1.
Erif, or the Lower Egypt, the most N. Province, containing the old Proper Egypt
and Augusticana. Divided into four Caciefs or Governments; viz. 1. Caliobeck;

Africa. Situated between the 8th and the 60th degr. of Lon. and between the 28
and 25 min. and the 35th and 30 min. of Lat. being in length from the W. parts
of Morocco to the E. parts of Barca about 2760 miles, and in breadth in the
widest parts not 300 miles, and in several places but 60 miles. It was
sometimes called Africa, and contains those Provinces which the Romans called
Mauritania, Numedia, Africa Propria, Byzacenia, Tripolitana, Cyrenaica, and
Marmarica.

It was anciently a great part of it under the State of Carthage, till
conquered by the Romans; afterward by the Vandals; then again by the
Emperors, till conquered by the Sarazens; after that divided into several
Kingdoms, till at last the Turk conquered part of it; so that it is under
several; the Xeriffs or Emperors of Morocco have the Western parts; the Turks
the Eastern; the Spaniards and Portuguez several Towns on the Coasts; and some
keep their freedom. The chapter T. of all is Fez.

The Inhabitants are all Mahomitans (except the Europeans) and very zealous in
their Religion. Their Language is for the most part the Arabic, but in Fez and
Morocco, and in some few other places they use that called Aquil-amerig or the
Noble Language, the same with the Punick or old African, intermixed with some
Arabic words. The chief Commodities are Honey, Wax, Oil, Sugar, Flax, Hemp,
Hides, Marokins or Cordavans, Dates, Almonds, Mantles, Alheicks, etc. It is
divided into six parts, which are, 1. Kingdom of Morocco, the most W. Province,

Ommiriboli.

Chief Mountains are the Mountains of Atlas or Aiducal, which part this Country
from Biledulgerid.

BIledulgerid or the Country of Dates, is a large but inconsiderable Country on
the S. of Barbary and W. of Egypt; situated between the 5th and the 60th and 30
min. of Lon. and between the 21st and 45 min. and the 32d degr. of Lat. being
in length from the Atlantic Ocean to the borders of Egypt about 3000 miles,
and not 450 broad in the widest place, and in some places not above 100. It
contains that part of the ancient Lybia Interior which was called (not the
Roman) Numidia.

It remained unconquered till Anno 710. It was overcome by the Saracens, but
afterward left again; so that it is now under several petty Princes and
Arabian Chiefs, many of them pay some acknowledgment to the Xeriffs of Morocco;
in some places they have scarcely any Government at all. Chapter T. is Dara.

The Inhabitants are for the most part Mahomitans, brought in Anno 710, a great
many are still Idolaters. Their Language is chiefly the Arabic, but in some
places toward Barbary, they use the Punick or old African. The only
Commodities that I find are Dates. It contains ten Provinces, which are, 1.

THE Deserts of Sarra or Zaara lies on the S. of Biledulgerid, situated between
the 4th and the 56th degr. of Lon. and between the 12th and the 28th degr. of
Lat. being in length from the Atlantic Ocean to the E. parts of Gaoga about
2840 miles, and in breadth from the N. parts of Berdoa, to the S. parts of
Borno about 780 miles, in some places but 240, in others but 120 miles. It
contains that part of the ancient Lybia Interior, called Deserta.

We can hear little of it in former times concerning Government, being so mean
and inconsiderable: It has now several petty Princes and inferior Lords, with
some Arabian Chiefs. The chapter T. of the whole is Zuenziga.

The Inhabirants are Mahomitans and Gentiles with some Libertines, who have not
the least signs of Religion or Worship. Their Language, Arabic and Punick, and
in some places that of the Negroes. Their only Commodities are Dates and

and 20 min. and the 65th and 40 min. of Lon. and between the 10th and 5 min.
and the 23d and 5 min. of Lat. being in length from the borders of Egyp^ to the
borders of Biafara about 1080 miles and the breadth about 650 miles: According
to this situation, it is a part of the ancient Lybia.

How it was in ancient times, we can tell b^^ little. At present we hear it is
governed by it own Kings, who, as some say, have a very great Power, and able
to raise a vast number of Soldiers. His S^at is at Nubia.

The Inhabitants are both Mahomitans and Pagans, but yet retain some signs of
Christianity, as Baptism in some places. They have a Language which seems to be
made up of Arabic, Chaldean and Egyptian. The chief Commodities are Gold,
Civet Sanders, Sugar, Ivory, Arms, and a most subtle Poison, an Ounce of which
is valued at 100 Ducates.

It is so little known to us, that I cannot find how it is divided, but I find

of Melli 920, and in some places but 400 miles. It is a part of the ancient
Lybia Interior, now sometimes called Nigritia and the Land of Blacks.

We heard little of it till conquered by Joseph King of Morocco, then by the
five Nations of Lybia Deserta, but the Inhabitants again recovered their
Liberty, and instituted several Kings of their own. So at present it is under
many Kings, but three or four have the greatest power, to which the rest are
for the most part tributary. The Portuguez and Hollanders have some of the
Coasts. The chapter T. of the whole is Tombute.

The Inhabitants are in some places Mahomitans, in others very simple

The Fortunes of it has been much the same with the rest of Negroland; so that

tributary to the Kings of Mandinga in Negroland, and also to some of the
Europeans, as English, Danes, Dutch, and Portuguez. The chapter T. is Arda.

The Inhabitants are for the most part gross Idolaters, every one making a God

How it was governed formerly we know not, but at present it is chiefly under
the government of the King of Congo, besides several other inferior
Governments; some part is under the Portuguez. Chapter T. is St. Salvador.

The Inhabitants are for the most part Idolaters, unless some few Christians

length from the N. parts of Barnagasso, to the borders of Monomugi about 2100
miles, and the breadth from the borders of Medra to the borders of Adel about
1500 miles. It contains the greatest part of the ancient Aethiopia Superior,
called sometimes Ludim, Aetheria, and Atlantia, now Abissina or Abissinea; by
the Italians, Habascia; by the French, Habech, and by the Germans, Shabath or
Hhabash.

It has been for many Ages and is still subject to its own Emperors, which are
often called the Emperors of Prester John. It was partly conquered by the
Romans, and now of late very much impaired by the Turks, Arabians and the
neighboring Princes on every side, several of the parts have their own
Princes, so that not above one half is under its own Emperors. The Imperial
Seat is supposed to be at Chaxumo.

The Inhabitants are for the most part Christians, (which is much in Africa)
having many Jewish Ceremonies, and differing from all others in many Points.
Their Language is the Habassine, which is said to have much of the Arabic in
it. In some few places they speak the Arabic. The chief Commodities are Gold,

Oriental Ocean; on the E. of Abissina, and reaches from the 22 degr. of N. to
the 17th and 45 min. of S. Lat. so if it be measured from the borders of Egypt,
to the most S. parts, it will be about 3000 miles but the breadth in the widest
place is not above 360 miles, and in some places but 60 miles. It contains part
of the ancient Aethiopia, and a great part of it went by the name of Barbary.

Some part of it was formerly under the Ethiopian Empire; but the Government
at present is under diverse petty Princes, and some of the N. parts under the
Turks. The chapter T. of the whole is Mosambique.

Inhabitants are for the most part Idolaters, with some few Christians and
Mahomitans. Their Language is chiefly the Habassine, and in many places the
Arabic. Their chief Commodities are Rice, Mill, Cattle, Lemons, Citrons, etc.
divided into three principal parts, which are, 1. The Coast of Abex, the most
N. Province, lying along the Red Sea, 1080 m. l. and 200 br. chapter T. is Erecco.

THE Empire of Monomotopa, lies on the S. W. of Zanguebar, and S. of Abissina,
being almost encompassed with Cafferia. Situated between the 43d and 45 min.
and 62 degr. of Lon. and between the 11th and 10th min. and the 31st degr. of
S. Lat. being in length from the N. E. to the most S. parts 1350 miles, and the
breadth about 780 miles. It is a part of the ancient Aethiopia Inferior,
sometimes called Benemotana and Benemotaxa.

How it was governed formerly we know not, but it is now chiefly under its own
Emperor, who is the most considerable Prince in all these parts, having many
others tributary to him. The chapter T. is Monomotapa.

The Inhabitants are chiefly Idolaters, with some Mahomitans, and (as I take
it) some Christians lately converted. Their Language, as far as I can
understand, is that called Gubio. Their chief Commodities are Gold, Silver,
Ivory, Rice, Milk, Oil, etc. Divided into two great parts, viz. 1. Kingd. of
Monumugi, on the N. 780 m. l. 570 br. It has, 1. Chicova, chapter T. Chicova. 2.

The principal Lake is that called Lachaf.

12. Cafferia.
CAfferia, or the Land of Libertines, contains the most Southern parts of all
Africa, almost incircling Monomotapa. It extends from Zanguebar to Congo along
the Coasts about 3600 miles; the breadth in the widest place not above 400
miles, in some places not above 130. It is part of old Aethiopia Inferior.

The Caffers have not the least sign of Religion or Worship, living without
both Law and Government. Their Language such as no man could ever understand
but themselves, being so inarticulate, it resembles the Clucking of Hens and
Gabling of Turkies. They have no Town, so nothing is here remarkable but the
Cape of Good Hope, being the most Southern Point in all Africa.

Under the name of Cafferia, in the extent before mentioned, are included,
besides Cafferia it self, the Kingdoms of, 1. Quietera, chapter T. Mongalo. 2.
Sofala, chapter T. Sofala. 3. Sodanda, chapter T. Bocra. 4. Chicanga, chapter T. Milan.
These lie on the E. of Monomotapa. There are two others on the W. as, 5.

Thus much for AFRICA.
IV. AMERICA.
AMERICA has on the East, the main Atlantic or Western Ocean; on the West,
the Pacifick Ocean or Mar del Zur; on the South, wherein ends in a Cone the
Magalanick Streights; the Nothern bounds are yet undiscovered. The known parts
are situated between the 240th and 348th degr. of Lon. and between the 63d of
N. and the 55th of S. La^. being in length from Huson's Streights to those of
Magilanica about 7000 miles, and the breadth from the W. parts of Peru to the
E. parts of Brasil about 3360 miles, in the middle not above 60 miles. It goes
by the name of the New World, and also the West Indies.

It was found out by Christopher Columbus, a Genoese, Anno 1490. It is
plentifully stored with all Spices and Fruits, and blessed with such abundance of
Gold, that in many of their Mines they found more Gold than Earth. It has also
many rich Commodities, and also many Creatures of strange shapes and natures,
altogether unknown in these parts.

The Religions and Languages that are used here are mostly the same with the
Europeans that govern these parts, except the unconverted Natives, who are most
commonly Gentiles, yet have some dark Notions of the Soul's Immortality, and
the Rewards and Punishments after this Life. They have almost as many Tongues
as Villages, but those of Mexico and Cusco are understood in almost all parts
of America. I would not have the Reader expect that I should speak of the
Religions and Languages in particular Countries, as I have done before, for it
will be of no use.

It is under the Government of the Europeans and Natives. The Europeans are
Spaniards, English, Portuguez, Dutch, French and Danes. The Natives have
several small Governments, and Maintain their Liberty as well in the known as
unknown places.

1. Canada.
CAnada is a great Country not well discovered, to the N. parts of America, and
N. W. of New England; it is of a large extent, but the true magnitude I find
not. It sometimes goes by the general name of New France.

The known parts were first discovered and are chiefly under the French, but of
no great advantage to them. The chapter T. is Quebeck.

It is full of Stags, Conies, Foul and Fish. Their chief Commodities are
Beavers, Mouse-skins, and Furs. It contains three Provinces, which are, 1.
Canada, the most N. Province, in which there are 23 sorts of People, but no
Town. 2. New France, on the S. E. of Canada, 950 m. l. and 100 br. chapter T. are

Continent, which as much as are found lie between the 290th and the 310th degr.
of Lon. and between the 30th and 35 min. and the 47th and 25 min. of Lat. being
in length from the N. parts of New England to the S. parts of Carolina about

It was first discovered by the two Cabots, Anno 1497, now possessed by the
English, and ruled by many petty Governors under the Protection of our King.
The chapter T. is Boston. The Natives also in several parts have diverse Lords, whom
they call Weroans.

The chief Commodities here are Tobacco, Corn, Fruits, Cattle, Deal-boards,
Iron, Tar, Beavers, Furs, Silks, Cottons, Indigoes, Ginger, Rozin, Turpentine,
Copper, Maize, etc. It comprehends seven Provinces, which are, 1. New England,
properly so called, bordering on New-Scotland, the most N. Province, 370 m. l.
and 270 br. chapter T. are Boston, London, and Warwick. 2. New York, once
New-Nederland, on the S. W. of New England, 270 m. l. and 130 br. chapter T.
New Haven and Milford: To this belongs two Islands, viz. 1. Long-Isle, chapter T.
Ashford, and, 2. Manhattens, chapter T. New York. 3. New-Iarsey, on the S. of
New York, 200 m. l. and 60 br. divided into two parts, viz. 1. West New-Iarsey,

Sasquabanagh, and 4. Albermarl.

Chief Mountains are the Apalachian Hills.

3. Florida.
FLorida is a large Country lying on the S. W. of New England, and on the N. of
the Gulf of Mexico; situated according to Berry's Maps between the 369th and 30
min. and the 294th and 40 min. of Lon. and between the 25th and the 40th degr.
of Lat. so that the length from East to West is about 1200 miles, and the
breadth from North to South about 600 miles.

It was discovered by the English Anno 1497, but more fully by the Spaniards
Anno 1527. The known parts are chiefly under the Spaniards and French. The
Natives are distributed into several Nations under the Government of
Sagainoises or the eldest of their Families.

This Country is extraordinary well stored with Venison and Fowl, having all
sorts of excellent Fruits, and enriched with diverse considerable Mines of Gold
and Silver.

Here are a great many Provinces (some say 43 in number) but little known to
us. The chapter T. that I find in the Midlands is Coca, chapter T. in the Peninsula
called Tegeste, are St. Augustin's, St. Mathea and Vitacucho.

Rivers of greatest note are two, viz. 1. Chucagoa, and, 2. Holy Ghost.

Chief Mountains are those called Apalachei.

4. New-Mexico.
UNder the name of New-Mexico (or as some call it New-Granada) are comprehended
all the N. Western parts of America, having a very large extent, but the true
Magnitude cannot well be given.

These parts are very little known to us, those that are, are chiefly under the
Spaniards, discovered by them Anno 1540, but of no account, being poor and
barren. Chapter T. is St. Fe or New-Mexico. The Natives have their Governors,
called Caciques.

Here are a great many Provinces and as many sorts of People, different in
their Language, Customs and Manners. The chief of these Provinces are
New-Mexico, chapter T. St. Acomo, Cibola, Quivera, Marata and Anjan. Of these, but
more especially of the last, there is much uncertainty.

The Island of Calafornia comes also into this account, which (if the vulgar
Maps be right) is about 1650 m. l. and 450 br. but very little discovered. The
N. parts go by the name of New Albion, partly under the English. I find not the
name of one Town, but only some Capes not worth the naming.

Chief Rivers are, 1. the North River, and, 2. Tecon.

5. New-Spain.
NEw-Spain or Mexico, lies on the S. E. of New-Mexico, washed on two sides with

A great part of it was formerly under the Kings of Mexico, till Anno 1521
conquered by the Spaniards, and still continues under them, governed by a
Viceroy. It is the most considerable Country that they have in all these
parts. The chapter T. is Mexico.

The chief Commodities of this Country are Gold, Silver and Metals, all sorts
of Grains and Fruits, Wool, Cotton, Sugar, Silk, Cochenel, Scarlet, Feathers,
Honey, Balm, Amber, Salt, Tallow, Hides, Tobacco, Ginger, with many medicinal

divide into many other Parts.
These have I set in as good order as I could, binding no man to follow them
any more than his own reason shall guide him, but howsoever, I presume that
they are not wholly to be despised.

The most considerable Writers of Geography were Ptolomy, Pliny, Strabo,
Dionysius, Mela, etc. among the ancients. The later are Mercator, Munster,
Ortelius, Maginus, Heylin, Bleau, Johnson, Cluverius, the Authors of the
English Atlasses, with a vast number of less note.

The chief Travelers are Morison, Sandys, Herbert, Tavenor, Thevenot, Charden,
Brown, with several others of less note, as Lassels, Blunt, Ray, Burnet,
Magallans, etc.

The most approved Maps are Sanson's and Duval's, Frenchmen; De Wit and
Visscher, Dutchmen; and Berry, an Englishman.

Here are some Faults committ^d ^y reason of my distance from the Press, the

great injury.
