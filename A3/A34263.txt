THE CONFINEMENT Of the SEVEN BISHOPS.
WHere is there Faith, or Justice to be found?
Sure, the World Trembles, Nature's in a sound,
To see her Pious Sons, Designed to Fall,
A Victim, for Religion, Truth and All.
The Charms of Piety, are no Defense,
Against the New found Power, that can Dispense
With Laws, to Murder Innocence:
Surely, unless some Pitying God look down,
And stop the Threatening Torrent, it will drown
Divinity it Self. --
The Bishops Prisoners are, we tamely see;
The Reverend Prelates forced to Bow the Knee
To Antichrist: No, Mighty Monarch, know,
Though we must pay to Caesar what we Owe;
There is a Power Supreme, by which You Live,
Whose Arm is longer, and Prerogative
Larger by far, than Yours, whose very Word
Can blast Your Hopes, and turn Your two edged Sword;
Can make this Titular Vicegerent know,
Virtue, like Palm's Deprest, does higher grow.
Though Roab'd in all the Grandeur of the State,
Courtiers, like Radient Stars about You wait,
Midst of Your Glorious Joys, when You put on
That Awful Presence, which becomes a Throne:
Belshazzer like, Three Words upon a Wall,
'Twill Dash Your Joys, and make Your Glory Fall:
His Holiness, That Patriot of Strife,
Though he can grant You Pardon, cannot Life.
Arise then, Mighty Sir, in God-like Mean!
As of thy Valor, Let thy Truth be Seen,
Free from Mistrust, Let all Your Words be clear
By Action; Let Your Promises appear,
Protect the Church, which brought You to the Crown;
You know it is Great, and Honorable to Own,
A Kindness done; But to Reward with Death,
The Happy Instruments, That gave You Breath,
Is mean; and might a Catholic Conscience sting,
To cut the Hand of that, Anoints You King.
