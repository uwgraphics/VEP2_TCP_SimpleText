AN EPITAPH ON Mr. JOHN SMITH, alias ASHBVRNHAM, Who having been an Eminent and
most Notorious Robber on the Highway was Executed on the 26th of this present
May, 1684. for Murder committed on the Road; and hangs now on Samford Hill in
Chains.
HEre Un-interr'd suspends that Highway Man
Sur-named Smith, Nicknamed Ashburnham:
Who for his Ill Deeds, and Notorious,
Is in Chains thus trussed up before us.
Justice and Law Ordained him to be
So sad an Object of Mortality:
Thereto remain, a Terror to affright
All wicked Men that do in Sins delight.
As that of Murder, Rapine, Robery,
Lust, uncleanness, and of Adultery,
Riot, Drunkenness, and of Gluttony:
Abuse of Plenty, full Carousing Bowls,
Prizing the Life of Sense above their Souls.
This is the Reason, and the Cause that they
May Warning take, and not in the Highway
Be Hanged in Chains, as he does to the Shame
And Disgrace of's Family and Name.
But yet his Body is Entombed in Air,
Arched over with Twenty thousand fair
And Glorious shining Stars; and I have
Faith enough to believe, that 'though a Grave
Be wanting to's Body, yet's Soul may be
Truly Happy to all Eternity.
For as his Sins were very great and many,
So his Repentance scarce outdone by any.
Faelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cantum.
LONDON, Printed by George Croom, at the Sign of the Blew Ball over against
Baynard's Castle in Thames street, 1684.
