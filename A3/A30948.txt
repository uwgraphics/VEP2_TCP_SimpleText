Parvis componere magnus. LONDON, Printed for H. B. at his Holinesses Gun in
Pouls Churchyard, where they will be Delivered to you Gratis. Feb. 10th.
1680.

Honest Roger,
PArdon the Expression I beseech you, I know I wrong you; but it is my Natural
way of Speaking to all my Benefactors right or wrong, in the Front of whom I
must ever place you as Chief Squire of the Quill to my Body; and the only
Broom-staff of my support and maintenance, for it is thee dear Roger, who have
supplied my Cannon with Jesuits Balls and Powder for above these Fifteen Years,
and made it roar louder than all his Holinesses Bulls, or the Tantivy
Trumpeters: I do not in the least Question your safe Arrival at Hanslardike,
having those wonder-working Priests in your Company (men of miracles) and not a
Mass said without ye: These together with that good old Proverb (I most rely
on) he that is Born to be hanged (for in my Conscience that is the end on it) need
never fear Drowning; secure me of your good passage, but to the business; yours
from Scotland never came to my hand till Printed, through the unhappy mistake
of the Messenger, who thought the Gun and Elephant had been all one, with that
in Smithfield, in the Fair time, and so carried it to Smiths Castle in
Cornhill; whence it came to me by Intelligence: I was Strangely confounded,
when I read your hard usage there, (what thought I) is Englands Crack-fart the
Churches Champion, the Kings confident the Tongue-Plotting Dialoguing
Discovering Maskerading Just-Asse, Trusty Roger, now forced to screen himself
under Jockeys Blue Bonnet of the Presbyterian Cut under the very Nose of his
great Master for Shelter; it had like to broke my Heart Strings (had they not
been double twisted) for grief and madness, but more of this (for a Remedy) by
the next.

Honest Tomson set out (soon after the Dissolution) for Bristol, where no less
than four Dozen of our Friends came forth to receive him, but the Asses being
twice the number of their Horses, it seems they were obliged to ride double,
whom the Heretics have concluded them all Abhorrors, and I fear may Burn them
(in Effigy) at his Holinesses next Procession: Father Patch has summoned all
the Musty good Cu-Rats in his Territories, to meet on a Certain day at the sign
of the Popes Bathing Tub in Rooks-all-street, in order to Choose some
Par-Lee-men, that may join with them to Consecrate the Bath for Holy Water, and
then take it with them (in Pint Bottles) to Oxon, in order to Expel Plots and
Plotters; which Tompson Swears, (as a Tried man) 'twill do infallibly; and
offers (the second time) to pawn his Soul on it.

The old Cock-loft Roger, where you and Tompson Lay has been searched for you
no less than Nine times already: But that which most vexed me (besides their
calling me Rascal for hiding you, and then so stoutly denying on it) they
brought that poor Rogue Robin Hog; and made him hold the Candle to them; where
he (like an owl) Blundering on the Old Coffer at the Beds feet, cries out
what is here, a Printing Press; no sooner had they forced it open, but their (as
the Devil would have it) they found your white Hat, Laced Band and Sword, with
your Just-asse-ships Gold Button Coat, and the under Petticoat you had of Madam
Vaultinglass wrapped up together in Tompsons Canonical Gown: All which I had
(though unluckily) just before (with much ado) Redeemed from the Lavender in
Long-lane; here is the Rogue, pull him out, says the Short-staff-man: I had
almost Burst my self, to see them so prettily deceived, though 'twas Damned
hard (Roger) to loose the Premises, knowing your occasions for them: However
off they carried them, Swearing though they missed your Carcass, they had got
the Better half on you; and stuffing them out, with my old Brooms, and your
Papers which lay Rusting by me, (for faith Roger, all we can Write or Print is
but wast Paper, it will not take now adays) putting a Papist mask on them (as
much to the Life as possible) they carried them into the Strand, and have hung
you up Roger (in Effigy) on the May Pole; where you may be sure you want not
for Spectators, the Heretics Flock by Droves to see you; though few knew what
to make on you, that is the best on it; some says its Tom Blood in his
Crown-Cheat, others it is a true Son of the Church Tom of Bristol, a third say
it is a Hermophrodite Strange-lee compounded of Giles and Cellier, a forth it is
a Protestant in Maskerades, a fifth it is the mack-niny Just-asse hung up
against St. David's day, to make a Taffee on, a sixth it is Nolls Fiddler
Metemorphost; others say it is a Mare-maid (neither Fish nor Flesh) because of
the Petticoat Roger, but the wiser sort, swear down right, it is old Touser, and
Touser is all of them.

Pray acquaint your Orange Mistress with the Birth of her Royal Brother (by the
Fathers side) which dropped lately in Scotland, to the great joy of all good
Catholics, who swear (by the Mass) he is born to be a Pope infallibly; coming
into the World, with his Left great-Toe in his Right hand, which posture makes
the sign of the exactly: and is so hopeful a Bantling, he has the Breviary and
all the Office of our Lady by heart already; and constantly says his Pater
noster Eleven times in a day; though somewhat Snuffling through the nose, which
John Cadbury says (having calculated his Nativity together with the way of his
procreation,) proves him to be the son of his nown Daddy, descending in a Right
line from old Fenney the Sage and as like him as possible, Laxative to
Admiration.

Here has happened some M^racles lately (besides that of the comet and the
Dissolution) old Will Stafford (it seems) is forced to do Penance, for telling
so much truth of the Plot and (mack-niny) our Master; though troth (Roger) I
think it somewhat hard measure, I dare swear he near intended it living nor
dying: Besides one would have thought (in good conscience) his last Holy Lying
in denying on it, together with his Sufferings, might have made amends for that
oversight, he has held several headless conferences with their Lordships in
the Tower (and some out on it) to find out some way (ere to late) how to keep
off the Approaching evil day (for it must and will come Roger) either by
stroaking Toms Cheeks with yellow boys in order to an escape, or else to
multiply them into so many Thousands, as may pay (in part) our out guards, and
some other pressing necessaries (male and Female) in order to dissolve the
Enemy: for look ye Sirs (quoth Will) I tell you Vows, Oaths, Dispensations,
Sham-plots, Countermines Lying and Denying, no nor the promises of either
Captain or Lieutenant or both, how e're they flatter you, can (if once they get
you at the Boarded Theater at Westminster) help you off with your Necks whole;
you see (if the Fathers will give you leave to believe your own lies) I speak
by experience, as well as Ned Coleman, and to say truth theirs no knowledge like
it: this Last (Roger) I am informed was agreed on as the Best (because the
Last) Remedy; upon which old Will took his leave, paying as much respects to
their Lordships as was possible for any one under his circumstances, and took
his way directly to Newgate, to visit the dispairing Fathers (his last
Speech-makers) where he found them in a most profound consult (together with
Lame Giles and Betty Cellier in St. Colemans Apartment) how they should also
escape the approaching Nooses: Beelzebub be with ye (says Will) if he be not
here already; if he be not (quoth Manson) you Lop headed Dotard, did his
Devilship ever leave any of our Profession, so long as we had a single minutes
time left for Plotting; but the question, like you, and your late Reading (we
heard on it) did ever Puppy Mumble over his Lesson at such a fate as you did the
very Catholics (as Blind as they are) as well as Heretics swore they could
see you Lie: Oh unpardonable Mortal Sinner to be so discovered, had you as many
heads as Hydra, you deserved to loose them all, for that your Drunken Folly;
you should have Wished, Cursed, Swore, invoked God, Angels, and Men, to bear
you Witness (though in a Lie) and Dared Heaven it self to contradict you) this
had been right Catholic indeed, like our dear Brethren at Tybura; and at worst
but Piae Frauds; this sharp Greeting raised the Old Gentleman's Choler to the
same height, as when he Buggered the Boy in Hey-nauls, and Swore by Hell and
Rome he would tare them into Ato^^s, and so save the Hangman the Labor, at which
menaces away Flies Giles for his Pillory Armor, and Betty to Act the second
part of the Bloody Bladder, crying out, good my Lord, don't be worse than
Savage, to a Woman in Labor, the Priest mean time on their Knees, at
Exorcisims, Damming him by Bell-Book, Salt Spittle and Candle, with a whole
Cart load of Church Curses to Pepper him; But Will defied them all, laying
their Telping came to late (like Colemans Pardon) he was as bad as bad could be
already, tickling them the while with Langberns Whip, it is thought they will
not live long after it; and if not hanged the sooner, will petition the Hangman
for Execution; however the good man escaped not Scot-free, for they had sore cut
the late Stitches in his disjoynted Neck in the Rencounter, so that he was
forced [like St. Denis] to carry it under his Arm, down to his Holinesses
Slaughterhouse to have it have the Sommerset; where the old Woman, that
happened to see Godfreys holy usage; and began to Cackle of it; not
understanding [it seems] those Duke-all Directions, of that Blessed intreague;
'twas thought fit by the Fathers, to send her privately on an Errand into
Purgatory; where it probable old Will came acquainted with her, this very Woman
[I say] getting loose, and coming [in the Dead of Night] to pay her respects to
her great Mistress, attending her [as formerly] with a Chamber pot and fine
Towel, met old Will at the Door of the Bed chamber, and seeing his Lordship in
that pickle offered him very civilly the use of her Utensils which the good man
accepted of very kindly; and so fell to Dabling his separated Noddle in the
Chamber-lye, which (I assure you Roger) was afterward put into a Basin [
Consecrated for that purpose] and placed in the Wall of the Chapel, next to
the Shrine of our Lady, by the little Door, on the right hand of the Altar, the
very self-same Spot, where you used to kneel Roger, with a Red-cross over it,
and Roger believe me, I speak not only the real sense of my own tried
experience, but it is also the Catholic Faith, of all our Believing Romans its
now the Best Holy Water that ever Catholic dipped in, for notwithstanding its
original was but from that Chip in Porridge, it is wonderful in its operation,
even to a Thousand Miracles, and of Fifty times the value of George Wakemans
Bottle.

As to the old Woman she continues very diligent, in opening and shutting the
Doors and Casements, making the sign of the In every Corner showing the
Pictures, and Relics to Friends, giving some signs of her own and Godfrey's
Exit, pointing to the several places where they laid him; But the Fathers are
hard at it (and if prayers fail) they are resolved to Bribe never failing Betty
to lay her: But of this Roger not a word, for fear the Heretics Smoke it; old
Will I hear is for certain, posted down into all Quarters (with others) our
indefatigable Jesuitical, Levitical, Atheistical, Pentionary, Plotting,
Trumpetting, Damning, Betraying, Abhorring Friends, to Act their utmost in this
new Bussle, procured (For) and By us; with Bills of Exchange, for Thousands of
French (Lumber-street) Dust, may Bubbie the unthinking: For trust me (Roger)
what e're you design on the other side the Herring-Brook, now is the time, or
never; to save our Bacon; here is an odd Story (Roger) runs about Town, of a She
Heretic (But all of our Faith believe her mad) who says (and offers to Swear
to) something in White Appears to her often, foretelling the removal of some
Body (to the Westward) by Poison into Limb^^ Patrum, much about Cuckoo time:
Certainly (Roger) this can be no Angel of ours for they (you know) are all
Black; besides the Devil (surely) has more wit than to spoil a Design so much
to his (and our) advantage, by telling on it, that would be to much like the
Heretics, who we hope, will ruin themselves e're long by Dividing: Hell be
praised for 't; yet Roger suppose (for once) it were an Angel of Light; we have
taken that care before hand; he shall be Credited at Court, just like the Plot
in Utopis and signify no more to them then the Comet which (they Swear) only
foretold the Death of Nelles Lap Dog: But (Roger) now I am here, let me
acquaint you with my Observations, I know 'twill please you, nay there is no
true Catholic, but si^g^te Deam Laudam^^, for it all the World over those
Boanerges who thundered so loud lately at Romes Doors, his Holinesses could not
sleep (nay stir) for them; met with a Northern blast the other day: puffed them out
(at pleasure) to the Westward; had you been here (hodge) you had split your
Guts with Laughing.

2. To see them look (when 'twas too late) like things that could (or at least,
at present would) not help it: But above all to see our late sculking Friends
so Strange-lee revived upon it, Damming them as brisk as ever: I have been told
the Bible says somewhere (for that is a Book I seldom meddle with) when their
was no King in Israel, the People did what they would themselves: But Faith
(Roger) we have just turned the Tables, ours in (and our) oth' Church, do it
when there is no Parliament; had you but heard (the 31th. past) Tantivy
Pelt-ing pay them off, with 40 and 48. you would have sworn, he had out done you
and Tompson, he told the Heretics plainly (though we shed it) the Martyrs
Blood out did the Blood of Jesus, and forced it for his Argument: Next (Roger)
have at the Virgins-Milk, that may outdo them both, and then he is fit for
Cardinal; here I could enlarge my self (Roger) on the Fathers, 22 out of 26 at
the least: But it is needless, 'twill do it self shortly; therefore (since it is
late) I Will here conclude, assuring you what now I have writ is certain truth in
every syllable, and you may swear it (Roger) morally, much safer (without a
Dispensation) than that you are no Papist. But a Pox on it (now I think on it)
theirs a List of Queries Bawld about the Town, far worse than that oth'
Pentioners, I must acquaint you wi^h them, and they must be answered too (it
Hell and Rome can do it) or else we may Write, Plot and Swear our hearts out,
they will not believe us: They call it a Match for Touzers Heraclitus Ridens,
that Damned Paper has put them on it, the Devils in it, you must be Scribbling;
it is like your Stranges case that Brought a Dozen Witnesses to Light, who
proved you (through your own Fooling) to be a forsworn Villain, and a Down
Right Papist; which never (perhaps) had otherways been heard of: But I Will not
be passionate least I misinform you; therefore in Cool Blood (Roger) 'twixt
Jest and Earnest take them as you find them, put by Heretics, here is just half
a Dozen of them 1. Querie, whether those Popish Arbitrary Designing Knave, who
talk so loud of 41 and 48, ought not to begin their reckoning somewhat about
30. in the long intervals of Parliament, and tell us the whole story fairly on
both sides (viz.) Monopolizing Ship money, hectoring our Birthrights
(Parliaments) book of liberties, Scotch Voyage, Star Chamber, Bishops Courts,
Corrupt Judges, Massacre in Ireland (in which were Hellishly Murdered above
200000 Protestant Souls (yet Papist no Rebels remember that) seizing the
necessaries (near Chester) sent by the worthy Citizens of London, to cloth and
relieve those poor languishing Protestants, who had escaped the Savage Papists
and lay naked under the Walls of Dublin, Commissions of Army, setting up the
Standard, declaring War, now Tery say (withal your impudence, who begun first;
tell us that (in truth) we will allow the Rest, in earnest. 2. Querie, whether
Scotch Oaths (with others since) Douglases Sermon, Beeda promises liberty of
Conscience, Mock marriages, War with France, saving Flanders, be not in Jest 3.
Querie, whether breaking Leagues, Dutch Wars, Chattam Victory, S^^irna fleet,
French measures loose of Shipping, Poland-Letters. Wars in Christendom Blood of
Protestants, be not in Earnest. 4 Querie, whether Divine Right, fair Speeches;
true Protestant love to Parliaments just Rights, English Liberties, Plot
Ignorance, Hanging Traitors, be not in jest, 5 Querie, wether grand Debauchery,
Whoring Courtiers, Popish Councels, Cheating Rogues, Hellish Plottings, saving
Traitors, Rotten Peaches, French Pentioners (and Cursed English ones to) Nells
of Whores, Swarms of Bastards, Macks Cut throats, horrid Murders, Burning
Cities (and the Provosts house too) Sham-plotting, Counterminings, Suborned
Villains, False Buggeries, Papist Officers (by Sea and Land to) French
Agreements, Dissolutions, buying voices, false Returns, designs to Ruin us, be
not in Earnest. 6. Querie, whether Church Papist, Divine Bishops, Tantivy
Abhorrors, Touzers Barking, Papists Scribbling, (to save their Bacon) and
deceive the People, for Swearing the Plots mack-ninles Title, Jesuits Councels,
French Assistance, to conquer Ireland, subdue Scotland, gain Flanders, beat the
Dutch, get their Shipping, be masters of the Seas, force a Rebellion, keep up
the Plot, Retreeve our Cause, by getting (this Bout) a Popish Pentionary,
Abhorring, Betraying, English, French, Irish, mack mongrel Parliament, who
shall betray their Country, enslave posterity, destroy themselves (at last) to
save Papist Traitors from hanging, whether this (I say) can be done, by all the
Arts, means, ways or money, Pope or French, Duke or Devil can invent or supply;
time must show:
But oth' my Conscience (Roger) to speak freely it is now too Late to do the
Trick: This also will prove a Jest in (Conclusion)

Now Crack-fart Roger, let your Crack-farts Fly
The Tell tale Comet, Scrible out oth' Sky.
Thy Pen Does wonders, wheels of Charles 's wain
Turn somewhat stiff, you will set them Right again.
I in a Hop-sack, it is such Knaves as you
Crack both the Poles, and stopped their moving true.
Go on and Scrible, till the Gallows find
You out of Breath, the Halter stops your Wind.
Sic voluere Fata.

yours H. B.
