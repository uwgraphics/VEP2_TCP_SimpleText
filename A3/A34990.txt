A DESCRIPTION of the CHVRCH OF SCOTLAND: WITH A Word of Reproof to the
Priests, and Teachers, and Officers therein, for their many corrupt Doctrines
and Practices; also a warning, and gentle invitation to all People, that lives
under their Tyrannical Government, to come to the Truth, which will free them
from the Bondage they have long lain under; and to the light which will show
them the way to escape, being longer Partakers of their sins; and so they shall
escape, being Partakers of the Plagues which shall shortly be poured forth
without mixture upon them, which continue in their ungodly Deeds and Works of
darkness, in Rebellions against the light that makes them manifest. Herein is
their Church made manifest: 1 In its Foundation: 2 In its Members wherewith it
is builded: 3 In its Officers: 4 In its Doctrines, of God, of Gods Word, of
Faith, and of Election: 5 In its Ordinances of Baptism, and the Lords Supper,
(as they call them.) 6 In its Discipline. With an Exhortation to all People to
come out from amongst them, to that which makes them manifest, which is the
true Light that lights every Man that comes into the World.

Written in love to the simple-hearted in that Nation, and in witness of the
Truth, and in Testimony against the false Teachers, and their false Doctrines,
Way^s, and Worships; by One who desires that people might be brought to the
Truth in their inward parts, to worship God in that, by the leading of his own
spirit, that so they might be accepted; (...) who am known among Men by the
name Stephen Crisp.

A Description of the Church of Scotland, etc.
TO the several Presbetryes in Scotland, and to every Member of them, and to
the Scottish Church in general, is this directed and sent as a word of
reproof and warning from him who is the head of the true Church, which is pure
and underfiled, and sent by, and given thorough his Servant, who being a Member
of that Church, and participating of the power and wisdom of the Head
(according to the proportion of (...) Member) do thereby comprehend your
Church of which I am not a Member; and in obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ
the true Head, do hereby reprove you of your adultery and hypocrisy, and
several other spots and wrinckles that are in and upon your Church, which now
with the light are made manifest; And in the fear and name of the Lord, do
warn you to return, and come to that which makes manifest and makes clean,
before ye be cast upon the bed of misery and perpetual sorrow with Babylon
your Mother, and Jezebell your Prophetess, by the power of whose sorceries and
enchantments, in and among her Merchants and Disciples, many p or people in
thi^ Nation, are seduced and deceived and kept from the anointing, which
teaches freely the truth, which no lie is of nor springs from, and they whom
you keep from this which teaches freely, that so they might buy or hire
teaching of you, among whom they are ever learning and never learned, nor
brought to know the truth which makes them fre^ that abides in it: These I say
can never know the true Church which is the ground o^ truth, in which none can
be Pillars, but such as overcome sin and transgression and death which entered
thereby, and came over all Men, in which state Gods Church is not, and there is
but two states: namely the state of sin and transgression, the wages whereof i^
death; and the state of redemption from sin, which is through the power of the
resurrection from the dead, which is the state of the Church, between which two
states is an absolute antipathy, for they that are in the transgression are not
in the Church, for then i^ would be spotted, and they that are in the Church
are not in the transgression, because the Church is in God where transgression
cannot be; and they that are holden in sin and death are not risen from the
dead, and they who are made partakers of the resurrection and life which is
Christ; they are not holden in sin, but the same power that raised (...) Jesus
from the dead, raised them from the power of sin and death, and being thus
raised makes them Members of the Church, which is pure and undefiled, which is
separate from the sinners and from the sin, by the mighty operation of the
cross, which is the power of God, by which we are translated from death to
life, from sin to righteousness from being Members of the Harlot and her
Church, to be Members of Christ and h^^ Church, and this is the Church which we
own and witness.

Now as concerning your Church, I have not a few things against it, but even
many, where in you are to be reprooved, and must be amended or rather changed,
before you can justly b^ called, and accounted the Church of Christ, or any
part thereof: Therefore listen a while and give attention, ye Priests and
Presbetryes of Scotland, who has a long time been talking of reforming and
amending and purging and making clean your Church, and I will declare unto you
your way, which ye ought to take, to accomplish that which you so much pretend
for, and cannot yet accomplish, nor indeed never can till that be removed which
has and does hinder a right and through reformation.

Now the first thing in your Church that is presented to my understanding, to
be repoved, is the foundation thereof upon which it is builded, it not being
the same which the Church of Christ was, and is builded upon, as will thus
appear.

The foundation of your Church is that which stands in the fleshly part of man:
namely forms and names of the things the Saints wrought off, without the
power, which are attainable by the fleshly wisdom of this world, by which God
is not known nor the body which is the Church discerned; but he that can get
the Saints words to speak although he be out of their life, yet such are
accounted fit members of your Church, and of such members, and upon this
foundation is your Church builded, the Saints words being the chief corner
stone thereof, but Christ said be would build his Church upon that which the
knowledge of came not by flesh nor blood, but revelation from God his Father,
which is in heaven, as you may read in the 16. Math. 17.18. And this is the
rock which is now made manifest by revelation, through the spirit, which thing
you deny to be in these days, and so are not builded upon what comes to be
known so, but upon that which the knowledge of comes by flesh and blood, and
you that have laid another foundation for your Church, then what is by
revelation, your foundation must be raised, and your Church must fall, the
Pillars whereof are already shaken, and shall shortly be removed.

Therefore come all to the true foundation, which was and is the foundation of
the true Church which is Christ the Son of the living God, who is the light of
the world, and lights every man that comes into the world with the true
light, and let that be the beginning and foundation of your building, and that
will stand for ever, this was before transgression was, and before will worship
was, against this the gates of hell cannot prevail.

This is the cornerstone which ye builders have rejected, and do still
reject, [the light] and so refecting it, are building Babylon (as it were)
which is now confounding, and ye are put to a stop, and can proceed no
farther, for the people sees your confusion in many parts of the Nation, and
begins to love and embrace them whom you have cast out of your Church, who have
the light for their foundation, which answers the witness of God in all, and
whosoever builds and not on this, their building shall come to naught, and the
builders shall be ashamed, for that which should uphold them, will come a top
of them, and break them to pieces.

The next thing reprovable in your Scottish Church, is the matter whereof it is
composed, and in this also are you contrary to the true Church the Spouse of
Christ, for your Church is composed of evil and ungodly men and women whose
hearts is delighting in ungocly practices, as wearing, and lying, and
cousening, and dissembling, and scoffing, and scorning, yea in striking, and
beating the innocent, such is your Church made up of; dead stones, whose h^arts
are as an Adamant, their mouths filled with cursing, and their tongues filled
with venom, and their hands filled with violence; these is your materials
with which ye have builded, but the Lord God of light and power is making you
bare and manifest, and by his power is throwing you down, where shame shall
cover your Church, where the scorner shall be scorned in the day of their
calamity, and the strikers shall be st ucken with a rod that will break them
to pieces, the sword of the almighty is drawn, and shall wound them in their
inward parts, that have wounded his Children in their outward bodies, and
greived his holy spirit, and then shall howling and lamentation come upon your
Church, but there shall be none to pity for the double reward of your doings
to Gods Children, shall shortly come upon you, and that is the word of the Lord
to you.

But if you demand, how is all this proved that our Church is compassed and
made up of such persons as these, I answer, I prove it thus, not only by the
hearing of the ear, nor by what I have seen of you, in the eternal light of
the Son of God before my coming among you, but also being an eye witness of
your behavior fowards me, who when I have in obedience to God, and love to
your souls, but proclarmed the fear of God amongst you, in one of your
Masse-houses or Markets, what an offense has it been counted by you, who are
of the Scottish Fresbiterian Church, some crying kick him, kick him, knock him
down, and such like language and usage have I and many of my brethren and sist
rs found amongst you, as in particular the behavior of the people of Dalkieth
on the 13th of the 9th month, 59.) may witness where had not the Soldiers
appeared as a stop to your murderous purposes against me, your works of
mischief had more appeared, but your spirit is seen and known to be of one
nature with the scarlet colored where, whothirsteth after and is drunk with the
blood of the Saints, besides there needs no greater proof of this charge
against your Church, but what has and does proceed out of your own mouths, who
are daily confessing your selves to be such kind of people, and so are judged
out of your own mouths, as all such slothful servants ever was, does not your
Priest say that ye are all going astray, every one after the lusts of his own
heart, and have forsaken God, the fountain of living waters, and dug to
your selves Cysterns that can hold no water, and that your hearts are estranged
from God, regarding lying vanities, and many such like things might be
mentioned from your own mouths, the breath whereof as fire shall devour you,
now if it benot so, why do you say so, lying against your own souls, and if it
be so, how can your Church be the Church of God, pure, and undefiled,
unspotted, and without wrinkle, or any such thing, answer for your selves, or
cease from deceiving your selves and others with the name Church of God, for
with him dwells no iniquity.

Now if the light were the foundation, then would none be counted fit members
of your Church but such as walked in it, and so your fellowship would stand in
the light as the true Church Fellowship did and does, but evil doers, as
Scoffers, Liars, Proud, Covetous Persons, Strikers, fierce D spisers, Railers
and Persecutors, such hates the light, and denies and rejects it, and so may be
continued in your Church Fellowship, which is in sin for term of your lives
and shall be continued in the inheritance of utter darkness in the end, where
shall-weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth for ever.

Another thing reprovable in your Church is the officers thereof, they being in
all thing contrary to the qualifications signified by the scripture of truth,
as ye might well see, if t^^ God of this world, the Prince of darkness had not
blinded your eyes, a little of the disproportion between them and the officers
spoken of in the Scriptures, (for the simples sake wh^ desires to be informed)
I shall instance, and first of all concerning your Presbitries, for the
Presbitry which the Scriptures speaks of, who laid their hands on Timothy, 1 Timothy 4.14. We such with whom was the power of God, as was manifest by Timothyes
receiving a gift by the laying on of their hands, who had rec^ived the gift of
God themselves, and had also receive power to communicate the same, but you who
are proud men and covetous men, who usurp Authority, and presumes to be called
by the name, and deny that power to be extant with you or any else, or that any
can be immediately called or gifted for the ministry, you are of th^^ sort
mentioned, in the 1 Titus 16. Who profess ye know God, but in woe ks deny him,
b^ing abominable and disobedient, and to every good work reprobates, for these
qualificatio^ does belong to such men as ye profess your selves to be, which
I shall set down, and then let (...) sober people judge whether ye be
reprobate unto them yea, or nay.

1 They ought to be blameless, and whether ye be so or nay, be your own
Judges, who (...) none can live without sin, and so consequently not without
blame, for all sin is blameabl^ (...) this particular ye have excluded your
selves; then watchful, but what do ye watch for ^^cept it be opportunity, to
promote your corrupt honor, or to augment and exact your (...) gain; then of
good behavior, that is not to rail, and to curse, and to stir up people (...)
^^mults, and to stoning those who are not of your judgment, this is evil
behavi^u^; then giv^^ to hospitality, as to this, let the poor people who in
your Parishes goes in cold and hunge^ while you live in fullness and idleness,
bear witness against you, then apt to teach, in the also are ye far short,
who must take a weeks time to study, to teach the people two or thr^^ hours,
and yet cannot get your devised studied stuff to hold together, but one while
is co^firming that, which it may be the same day, or shortly after, you will
deny again, then (...) given to wine, no strikers, how many of you have been
guilty herein, in drunkenness, a^^ striking, and setting others on to strike,
would be too tedious to mention here, but who desi^^ to be informed of them and
their manners, let them in sincerity take notice of th m, a^^ they shall come
to understand their spirit, also some of their works of this nature are alre^^
printed and presented to public view, then not greedy of filthy lucre, and in
this particul^^ how far your greedynesse has appeared beyond all that have
gone before you, let the sufferi^^ of them, who for conscience sake, could not
put into your mouths, bear witness against y^^ again says the Apostle in the
7th. verse of that 3. Chapter of the 1st. Timothy, he m^^^ have a good report
of them that are without, but how far are ye short of this, who can^^^ keep
up a goood name amongst them of your own Church, but your covetousness and
dece^^ is mannifest among them, notwithstanding your tyranny does much stop
their mouths, and bl^^^ their eyes that they yet see not so much of your
deceit, as shortly they will come to see.

But in brief, the description of the Church Officers in the whole Scriptures
of the Apo^tles is that they be blameless, which ye say none now can be, and
that they be filled with the holy Ghost and with says, which ye say they
cannot be, for sin must have a room ^n them, then they cannot be filled with
the other, and that they hold the mi^tery of faith ^n a pure conscience which
ye say they cannot do, for some sin must remain, and that defiles the
conscience, that they should be gentle toward all Men, in meekness
instructing them that oppose themselves; But out of this and all these
qualifications ye being found, ^our officiating must be like your Officers,
and your Officers are like the Members, a body ^it for destruction together,
which the Lord is appearing against in his mighty power to ^ut of head and
tail, root and branch together.

4thly, The Doctrines of your Church also are reprovable and corrupt in many
things contrary to the Scriptures, and first in your Doctrines of God, whom you
say is to be known and believed on, as in the distinguishmant of three Persons,
and herein ye teach contra^y to the Scriptures of truth, which ye say is your
rule, and by it are all such Dreamers and Deceivers judged, and by the spirit
which gave them forth, which speaks no where (...) three Persons, as ye
imagine and teach, but declares of the only wise God, who is one (...) being
and subsistence individual, infinite, who divides all things, and to every
(...) ^^eir portion, who limiteth all things, and is not limited, whose power
and spirit is (...) ^able from him, who is the Father of the spirits of all
flesh, who by his power (...) ^^th, and by his spirit quickens all living
Creatures, whose power is the Christ, (...) whose spirit is the holy and
eternal life, which they partake of, who waits for his ^ppearance in his
power, and these does not the Scriptures call three Persons, but the one
witness in the Heaven which you are all ignorant of, who dreams and divines
to the people of a distinguishment of Persons in the Godhead; therefore cease
your deceit ye Deceivers and Sooth sayers of Egypt, and come to the light
that shines in the heart, that by it ye may come to the true knowledge of God
your Creator, and of his power by which ^^e were created, and of his spirit by
which he quickens into newness of life all those who ^eares him, and waits
for his salvation, which now by the light is making manifest.

2dly, Your Doctrine concerning the word of God is altogether reprovable, who
teach people to beli ve, that that is the word of God that can be bought and
sold for money, and the knowledge thereof attained by humane learning, namely
the Scriptures of the Prophets and Apostles, that you say is the word of God,
and they that say otherwise, you say must be cursed, but I tell you this curse
will return upon your own heads, who preach contrary to the Scriptures, which
says Christ is the word of God; now if he be the word ^f God, then the
Scriptures is not except they be Christ, which if you think they be, de^lare
your meaning plainly, and if you know any other Christ then the Scriptures,
then ^all ye him the word of God, and call the Scriptures a Declaration
according as they are ^alled by them that wrote them, who knew the word of God
it self, which ye being ignorant of, have as it were changed the glory of the
incorruptable and immortal word of God which abides for ever into the
similitude of writings, which had a beginning (...) and must come to an end,
and in the end shall you know the word of God to be that wh^^^ searches your
hearts, and Judges your ungodly thoughts and purposes, this shall abi^^ with
you in the end, for this was in the beginning, which the Scriptures was not,
a^^ this is it by which the Scriptures and all other things came to have a
being so th^^ if the Scriptures must be called the word of God: because the
word came to (...) Saints, and bid them write them, then might Noah's Ark, or
Solomon's Temple, (...) the Priests Garments, or any other thing of the like
nature be called the word of Go^ because by it they were commanded to make
them, and furthermore, that which the word of God is that which was made flesh,
and if you can tell how or wh^^^ the Scripture was made flesh, then declare it,
or else let that be called the word of G^^ henceforth that did become flesh,
again without the word was nothing made that (...) made, and if the scriptures
be this word then declare to us, how you know that they w^^^ before the
creation, for that which makes, must needs be before the things that by it
(...) made, farther the word of God, says the Apostle is quick and powerful,
and shar^ then a two edged sword, deviding between the soul and the spirit,
but if this be (...) Scripture then tell us what is the reason that your souls
are not thereby divided from (...) spirit of iniquity and d ceipt that rules
over them, but ye imagine that death onel^ (...) make that division as if
death were more powerful then the word of God, oh ye^ (...) and ignorant
Priests and people, how long will ye regard lying vanities, expec^^^^ (...)
where it is not to be had, and like the Pharisees of old, think to have
eternal (...) Scriptures, but will not come to Chri^ whose life is your light
turn in your mind (...) own hearts, and feel if Gods word (which is as a
hammer) be not striking at (...) ^^ther of your sins and corruptions, and wait
then to feel the sharpness of it, to cut and (...) you from your sins, that so
you may witness the word in your flesh (and not in a Book destroy the works of
the Devil, that the word in the heart ye may know which lives (...) abides
for ever, when that by it is destroyed, which cannot abide for ever, which is
your which hitherto has separated you from the knowledge of God and of his
powerful w^^^.

3dly, Your Doctrine of faith is reprovable, and you in it found contrary to
the (...) Ministers of Christ, for you preach that faith cannot be without sin,
and you say it is h^^^sie and error in any to say that it can, now this I say,
if ye knew the true faith which saving, ye would see that it is contrary in all
things to sin, and would know that in (...) of an impossibility to separate
them, it would be impossible to unite them, for faith (...) the scriptures is
the gift of God, and the gift of God is perfect, and God nor his gift (...) no
concord with sin, but gives the true believe victory over it.

But as for your faith which ye say cannot be without sin, is therewith
corrupted, a^^ not the like precious faith, which the Saints obtained, by which
they wrought righteous^ and were accepted with the, Lord without which it is
impossible for you to please him, th^^ ye perform never so many performances,
for this, faith which is mixed with sin, whi^^ the faith of the Church of
Scotland, is not that by which the just lives, but among (...) profess this
faith, is the just slain in your own particulars, by the sin which ye con^^
in, and say ye must continue in as long as ye live, so ye are fur short of
the Saints hope ^o brought them to purify themselves as God is pure, and your
faith and hope and confi^^e which is thus mixed with sin and unrighteousness is
excluded from leading any of you in^^e inheritance of the promise which is
eternal life, for it is the feigned or made faith (...) hardens the heart, and
continues you in the transgression, and begets in you a bold confi^^e in your
dark imaginations, which shortly shall fail you, and ye shall be strict of
(...) says and hope, and be left naked to your perpetual shame and confusion,
and ^^esore all that desire to come to the true faith which gives victory over
the (...), and that which is in the world, they must first come to that which
true faith is placed in, (...) is the light wherewith Christ Jesus has
enlightened every one that comes into the (...), and that all men through him
might believe and Christ himself said that they should ^^ve in the light, and
this is it which does secretly make manifest, and reprove the works ^arkenesse
which are done out of the faith, and are displeasing to God and who believes in
(...) light they must believe against sin and the power of it, and so as they
abide steadfast in the (...), watchful to that in which they have believed,
then the power of this faith comes to be in the creature, that as they have
believed against sin, so they come to receive power a^^ sin, for according unto
their faith so happens it unto them, and according unto your faith (...) ^ive
you can never be made free from your sins, so also will it happen unto you, so
long ^^^de in that belief ye shall abide servants of sin, and so free from
righteousness.

^^^bly, Concerning election, and herein have ye erred exceedingly from the
truth, and (...) truth ought ye to be reproved and judged, who holds forth in
your Church that God (...) ^^pected a certain number of persons to himself
without cause or quality in them scene ^sidered, and that these he has elected
unto salvation, by an unalterable decree that they be saved from the wrath of
God, and that all the rest are under an irrevocable decree of nation; for when
no way of salvation is left, nor no effectual means found for the salva^^ of
them, that doctrine is not of God but of your Father the Devil, who was a liar
from beginning, if he tells a lie it is of himself, but if ye tell a lie it
is of him, and from is thy doctrine sprung, who rules in the Kingdom of
darkness, and desires that none might (...) to the knowledge of the truth, nor
be saved, and so has set you to preach this doctrine ^^rdly unto ignorant
people, (who generally have believed it) while he in the mean time ^^relly
suggesting in some of them, that they are elected, and so what sin soever they
live in, of mar their election seeing it is without condition or qualification,
and man's works of alter nor change Gods decrees, and many such like reasonings
as this learn they from deceiver within, and from the deceivers without, and he
also is persuading others that they not elected, but are of the greater number,
which the Priests says no salvation nor re^^^tion is for, and so they may take
their course, and spend their time in pleasure, for can but go to hell in the
end, and all their godliness and soberness, and strickt^^^, and abstinence
from pleasure, and whatever they can do cannot change the purpose of God
concerning their damnation, and so by these and such like means and
instruments does the devil uphold his Kingdom, and keep you from preaching
him or believing on him, who is the way to the Father, Christ Jesus the light
of the world, who lights every man with the true light with which he may see
that which was wrought in darkness (which is the reprobate state) and be led
out of it according to Christ's words, who said I am the light of the world, he
that believes on me shall not abide in darkness, but shall have the light of
life; he said not if the elect believe on me but [he that] a general term to
every one that comes into the world and is enlightened with this true light,
and this is the love of God to the Sons and Daughters of men, who wills not the
death of them that do dye, [marke] them are reprobated that do dye, but God
wills it not, but rather that they should turn and live; but ye that preach
this doctrine, ye would live without turning, but the Sword of the Lord is
drawn against your life, and shall cut it off, for it stands, but by an
imagination of such a decree, as by which sinners might be saved in their sins,
and then you shall know, that the way of salvation was set open to you, in that
the light shined in your hearts; but ye rejecting that way, and seeking to
establish a way of your own; so ye became excluded, and shut out of the
Kingdom after long talking of it.

And therefore all ye people of Scotland, and to whomsoever this shall come of
wh^^ people or country soever ye be, consider in the fear of God, whether ye
be lighted (...) a light that does make manifest your evil deeds, and words,
and purposes in the secret (...) your hearts, yea or nay, and if ye find such
a thing, then mind diligently its working in you, for in it is reproves of
instruction which the Scriptures says is the way of life, and the way of life
is but one, and having found it, every one in your own particulars, then no
longer follow nor harken to the deceivers, who for a long time has beguiled
you, leading you from the light, the way, the truth, and the life of men, and
so kept you in death and darkness, where salvation is not to be found, and
these have told you, that they have preached the Gospel to you, for the
salvation of your souls, and yet tells you also that as many of you as ever
shall be saved were saved before you were borne, then to what purpose is all
their preaching to you, if they cannot convert a reprobate, nor an elect person
cannot sin unto condemnation, where then is the use of their ministry which
they have so many thousands of marks and hundreds of pounds a year for, if
they answer and say this is the means to gather in them that are elected; I
answer, God will not loose any for want of means, and therefore he has
afforded the means freely without money or prise to all the sons of men who
bath so loved the world that he has given his only begotten Son a means and
a way of salvation for as many as believe on him, and he is the grace by which
the Saints were and are saved which appears to all men, and brings
salvation nere unto all without respect of person, who are taught by him to
deny ungodlynesse, and wordly lusts, and to live soberly and righteously in
this present World, but if ye still continue to be taught by them that turn
the grace of God into wantonness, and despise that which shines in the heart,
to lead out of sin, which it makes manifest, then shall you perish in your
gainsaying, and in the day of your calamity and misery ye shall know and
confess to your unspeakable sorrow and torment, that a prise was put into your
hands, and a way of life was declared and made manifest, but ye loving your
sins and iniquitys, your delights and pleasures, which the light and way of
life appeared against; were unworthy of this free salvation, and so your
condemnation, ye shall confess to be of your selves in that day, when God the
righteous Judge will be clear of all your blood, and then saying God is partly
too blame, and man is partly too blame that Men go to Hell will not serve
turn, which one of the chief Priests of your Scottish Church affirmed, [Henry
Foreside Priest of Lingich] but his folly and many such blind guides is now
made manifest with the light, which they are risen up against, but they shall
not proceed much farther, for their skirts are discovered to their shame.

Many more of the Doctrines of your Church are reprovable, and for condemnation
with the light, which light as the diligent Readers comes to mind, in its
working and breaking forth, they shall see and be able to measure and to try
your Doctrines therewith, and will be able to comprehend your deceit in many
other of your Doctrines, which now I am not free to insist upon; As of
sanctification, in which ye allow an (...) sanctified part to remain, and so
never brings people to know nor to hope for the ^^^row cleansing, which the
Saints witnessed, except it be after death, when no such ^^rke can be wrought,
and also your Doctrine of justification in sin will be seen, and Gods
righteousness will be cleared against your lying and deceit, and so of
Adoption, and Resurrection, and Glorification, and what else is preached
amongst you, will be seen with the light, by them that loves it, to which I
commend them, in whom is sincerity of heart, and shall proceed a little further
to your Ordinances.

1st, And first concerning that rotten tradition, which you call an Ordinance,
or Baptism, namely your casting a few drops of water upon the face of an
Infant of about eight days old, this you call an Ordinance, but could never
yet find out the institution thereof by Christ nor his Disciples, for any
sign or signification whatsoever, much less can you prove it to be the one
Baptism, neither can you prove that ever any such thing was done by any of
them; so ye have neither precident nor precept from the holy men of God, and
therefore well may I call it a rotten tradition that has not so much as a
president to support it, except it be a Popish one, from whence it was derived,
from the Whorish Church of Rome your Mother, whom you rail against in words,
and obey in her unwarrantable practices, and with her shall you have your
portion, now this conceited charm, or trick of casting a few drops of water
upon Childrens faces, you call Baptism, wherein you have proclaimed to all
understanding people, that from the greatest of you to the least, you are all
ignorant of the Baptismes the Scriptures speaks of, which had a time and
service, and ended it that which abides for ever, and so being ignorant of
them, have in their room set up a conceit and tradition, which has not so
much as the least ground in the Scriptures of truth, neither is mentioned
therein, nor was it invented many years after, and th^^ was it instituted by
the Pope, obeyed by the Papists, and since continued and observed in your
Scottish Church, which from thence is sprung; but the true Baptism is that
which was instituted by Christ, and is owned and witnessed by the Saints, and
denied by the Romish and Scottish, which Baptism is into the name of the
Father, Son and Holy Spirit, which name is a strong Tower, and all that are
baptized into it find strength in it, and help against temptations, and in the
time of trouble finds deliverance by it, and this the Saints witnessed, who
witnessed the one Baptism by one spirit into one body; for says the Apostle
in the 6 Romans 3, 4. for so many of us as were Baptized into Jesus Christ, were
baptized into his death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the
glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life: now in
that he dyed, he dyed unto s^n; and they that are baptized with the one
Baptism, they are planted together with Christ in the likeness of his death
which is unto sin, verse 10. and such also come to partake of the resurrection
and life which is in Christ Jesus, and in that they live, they live unto God
and not unto themselves, having crucified the old Man with his deeds, and has
the body of sin destroyed, and henceforth being dead unto sin they serve it
not, but witnesses the Baptism which now saves, making clean the
conscience in the sight of God by the washing of Regeneration.

Now all people that desire farther to know of this one Baptism which is a
dyin^^ unto sin, and a cleansing or washing from the filthiness both of flesh
and spirit; you must turn your minds to the manifestation of Gods spirit
within, which is given freely of God for you to profit withal, and with it
will you see the spots that remains upon you, notwithstanding your outward
traditionall Baptism of what sort or manner so ever it be, and also it will
give you to understand that the Baptism which is the answer of a good
conscience, and which is the similitude of Christ death which is unto sin is
yet wanting; and so by waiting in that which makes manifest those things which
ye should dye unto, then will ye feel the name of God revealed in you, which
is the strength and power which only is able to kill sin, and trusting and
believing in this the true faith comes first to be witnessed, and then the one
Baptism which cleanses and purifieth will be witnessed, which brings into
the everlasting Covenant which God is making with his holy Seed, which he is
now gathering from ^^^der all the shadows, and also from among all the
inventions of Men to serve him in meekness and fear in that worship which is
inward in the spirit and in the truth.

2dly. The next thing is your imitable custom of eating and drinking Bread and
Wine which you call a Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and in this imitation
stands much of your dark fellowship and communion, but no warrant from
Scripture have you for any such practice, for Christ nor his Apostles never
commanded Swearer, and Liars, and covetous Persons, and Fighters, and
Persecutors, that they should observe any such thing at any time such as ye
are, for when ever ye eat or drink it is unworthily, as ye your selves
sometimes confess, and so your damnation must needs be the greater.

Notwithstanding Christ the same night he was betrayed gave his Disciples his
flesh to eat and his blood to drink who afterward was to partake and enjoy him
in that which was signified by the Bread and the Cup, when he took Bread and
blessed it, and said take eat this is my body which they took and eat and
discerned his body of which they were Members, and as often as they did this they
remembered him who said I go away; but I come again, and so also the cup he
said was the new Testament in his blood which they then participating of, and
keeping in remembrance him who dyed, who was to be raised up from the dead
through faith and patience they came to have the new covenant in their hearts,
which was the substance of the figure in the blood, they being first therewith
sprinkled from an evil conscience, and washed in their bodies with pure water
which is one with the blood; but ^ow far ye are from this state let Gods
witness in your consciences, and your own mouths bear witness: Now
notwithstanding Christ did institute such a thing as this among his Disciples,
who had followed him in the regeneration, and had continued with him in his
temptations, this was nothing to them, who believed not on him, neither is it
any thing to you who are cursing them that bear witness to him, that he is
come a light into the world, and has lighted every man that comes into the
world, and that witness, he is come again the second time without sin unto
salvation according to his promise these you curse and persecute: so your cup
is not the cup of blessing which the Apostle speaks of, 1 Cor. 10.16. Which is
the Communion of the blood of Christ which cleanses from all sin: neither is
that bread which they break the Communion of the body of Christ, for Paul
says, they them selves were the bread and the body which is but one; but this
he said he spoke to wise men, and if any have an ear, let them hear, but as
for your part ye are so foolish and unwise, that the bread ye break is
carnal loaves which feeds nothing but the carnal body which is no part of
Christ's body that is hid from your carnal eyes, and sealed from your carnal
imaginations, and his second coming which is without sin ye cannot believe,
and so his first coming will do you no good, and your carnal bread and wine
will never bring any of you to know nor remember his death, nor to show it
forth, for in that he dyed, he dyed unto sin, neither will his coming be unto
salvation; when he appears again unto you; but unto damnation who discer^^^ ^ot
his body but curses and persecuteth his members, but all that desires to know
the Supper of the Lord in sincerity, they must come to the light in the heart
which comes from Christ, and that will show them that which has crucified
Christ and slain the Lamb, and oppressed the just in their own particulars, and
then the fear of God being placed in the heart, and the want of Christ being
felt, who by sin and through transgression is crucified, then shall you
secretly come to feel a hope of his resurrection, and so then as often as ye
eat and drink it will be in the fear of God and in remembrance of your own
unworthiness, and also in rememberance of him who is to come to sanctify the
creatures; which as he comes to be raised to life which has been slain in
you, this appearance is the second appearance which is without sin unto
salvation, and till ye witness this, as often as ye eat and drink, do it in
the fear of God and in remembrance of Christ so showing forth his death till he
comes, who when he comes will show forth his own life, who is God over all
blessed for ever, Amen.

And these two, you call Sacraments, which you have as little ground for, out
of the Scripture, as you have to practice them; but are delighting your selves
in the works of your own hands, and giving names to your Idols; like the
Heathens and Idolators before you. But if you say they are obliging mysteries;
I answer, how comes it to pass, that you, who have been so long exercised
therein, is no nearer obliged to God, but remains in the alienation of your
minds; such strangers to him, that one of your own Priests said to a company
of you, in my hearing, that the lowing of Oxen, and the blee^ing of Sheep,
would give as good an account of what God and Christ was, as your answers would
do, if ye were asked; but your Idols shall be broken, and their names shall
you be ashamed off, as they were ashamed of the Groves, and the green Trees,
under which they had worshipped their Idols, whom God confounded before you,
and then your Water, and Wine, and Cakes, and such like things, which you call
Sacraments, and your Masse-houses, which you call Churches, signed with the
Popes Gross, your predecessors, these things will but all add to your shame
and sorrow. Therefore whilst you have time lay aside these carnal and foolish
traditions, and come to the light which lets people see over them all, to the
one Baptism it self, and to the Supper (and Table of the Lord) it self, and
to the Church it self, which is in God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, as
you may read, 1 Thessalonians. 1.2.

And lastly, the Discipline of your Church, does appear contrary to the
Discipline of the true Church, and in this particular ye have so far proceeded
already, within these few years, that ye have thereby much manifested your
selves, even to many, who did not before see you; for this many has looked
upon, as a tail of a Scorpion, with which ye have sought to bend that sting,
and venom, which lodged in your hearts, against the true Church, which ye
could not vent with your tongue nor hands; but this also will the Lord cut off,
that the Scorpions shall hurt no more; your sting begins to decay, and your
force to fail you, and people begins to walk safely in the path of peace, and
in the way of righteousness; notwithstanding your tail, or your tongue, to
the grief of your hearts, which is filled with mischeife, against the
righteous in the Land: But the Lord is their deliverer, and according to the
evil of your desires against the innocent; even so shall your reward be.

Now the true Church they did observe, that if any that was called a Brother,
should be a Fornicator, a Railer, and Extortioner, a Covetous person, an
Idolater, or a Drunkard, with such a one not to eat; now if you would observe
this in your brotherhood, ye would quickly be scattered one from another;
your Priests suspended, for their Coveteousnesse, and Drunkenness, and
Railing; the people suspended for their Fornication, and Idolatry, and
Extortion, and Railing, and Fighting, and many other misdemeanors; your
Communion would soon fall; but you, who are a body, or Church so called, made
up of such as these, ye take another course to uphold your fellowship; for if
any, who has been one with you in these things before mentioned, does come to
see with the light, wherewith Christ has lighted them, that these things are
displeasing to God, and so dares not go on with you any longer in them, but
declares against your Idolatry, your covetousness, your railing, and it is
with such a one, that you will not eat, nor drink, nor buy, nor sell. Oh
abominable depth of Satan, this is the way you have found out, to keep people
from believing in the truth, and from departing from your corrupt and cursed
practices: In short, this is as your Fathers the Jews did, who were the
crucifiers of the Lord of life; if any then did confess him to be the Christ,
that said, I am the light of the world; who lights every man that comes into
the world, they must be cast out of their Synagogue, [marke] out of the
Synagogues of the unbelievers, and crucifiers: such as ye, who cannot, nor
will not have any fellowship with them, that beleives in the light, that they
may be made Children of the light, your latter end shall not be like unto
theirs.

Furthermore, the Apostle exhorted the Corinthians, to deliver the incesteous
persons to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that his soul might be
saved in the day of the Lord; but he did not intend the destruction of his
body, as ye wickedly do, who thirsts after blood to assuage the flame of your
envy, but the Lord will quench that flame, and ye that desires blood, ye
shall have blood to drink, but the Apostle fought not with flesh and blood,
but against spiritual wickedness, and against incestion and fornication, and
Idolatry; but ye make war against the flesh and blood, and seeks the
destruction of the outward bodies as much as in you lies; but those who
believes in the light, and trusts in the Lord, the God of our salvation: the
power that saves out of sin, and unrighteousness, them will he deliver out of
your bloody hands, and from your cruel teeth, and from the reach, and venom
of your hurtful tail; but it may be you will say, although we have no
criminal fact to lay to their charge; whom we have cast out of our Church, of
whom you speak; yet they are Heretics, and it was Paul's council that one
that is an Heretic after the first and second admonition, Reject. I answer, if
this were observed among you, there would be none found to reject? for all
would be found to be rejected, and this is the reason, that whosoever comes to
be members of the true Church; does reject you, because of your Heresy in
doctrine, and corruption in conversation? but after that way which you call
Heresy, worship we the God of our Fathers, who wrought the holy Scriptures by
inspiration of the holy spirit, and according thereunto, we believe in the true
light, that lights every man, that comes into the world; which (our)
belief you call Heresy, and we believe that this light wherewith every man is
enlightened, is a sufficient light, to lead all that follow and obey it, to
eternal life, and this you call Heresy: and that this light is the perfect
and beavenly gift of God, and whosoever yields himself into the obedience of
it, shall thereby be translated from darkness, and the works thereof which is
sin, and be brought to live righteously and holyly in this life, and this also
you call Heresy, and many more things, which in the Scriptures are declared,
and by us believed and witnessed, do you call Heresy, as may appear in a
book lately published by the Presbitery, at Edenborough, to their shame called
a testimony against the petition, for tolleration; wherein your envious and
bloody spirit is sufficiently set forth, to every judicious Reader, against the
life of the Scriptures, and whomsoever into it is come; But your cainish spirit
is seen, and your end is at hand, and your reward shall be according to your
works.

And now all ye people of Scotland, in whom is sincerity and simplicity unto
whom this shall come; consider in the fear of the Lord, where you are, and who
you are joined with, and against whom ye take part, while ye abide in this
Church, and search the Scriptures, your selves, and see whether these things be
so or nay, and come out from amongst them, and partake no longer of their sins;
least you partake also of their plagues, which is near coming upon them; and
praise the Lord, who has spared you until now, and caused his light to break
forth to discover their ways, and works of darkness; before ye are
overwhelmed by his judgments, and as in sincerity, ye come to try these
things with the light in it, ye will see more light, and by it an
understanding will be opened in you, to see into their abominations, and
deceits; beyond what is hear declared; but if ye reject this, the day of your
visitation, then shall ye be shut up in darkness, and your ignorance shall
increase; and your hearts shall be heardened, and ye made fit for the
indignation and wrath of God, to be powered forth upon, when the measure of
your iniquityes shall be fulfilled.

While you have time, prise it, and while you have light love it, and believe
in it that you may be made Children of it.

S. C.
