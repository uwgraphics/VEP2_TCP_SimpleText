To the Two LIGHTS of ENGLAND; the Two UNIVERSITIES of this Kingdom: And to all
their most worthy HEADS and MEMBERS, Truth, Wisdom, and Honor from God our
Father, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST.
Ye celebrated Men of Wisdom and Learning,
THe TRIPLE-CROWNED-LITTLE-HORN, has so worried the Saints of the Most High,
out of the World, with his blasphemous Endeavors of changing TIMES and LAWS,
that Men know not how to keep Time for their Laws, nor have any Law for their
Time.

But the Learned Dr. MORE (and several others) in their COMMENTARIES on DANIEL,
have laid the CHANGE of TIMES and LAWS at the Doors of ROME. Yet because (Dolus
versatur in universalibus) they seem not to be concerned.

There wants a NATHAN to say, Thou art the Man. (2 Samuel 12.7.) There wants some
to say, what Times, and what Laws, the Angel spoke of to Daniel? Dan. 7.25.

To which purpose I did write to the Most Reverend ARCHBISHOPS, and BISHOPS,
on the King's Birthday; and the most Honorable JUDGES in Term time, in the
very beginning. And now to your Selves (against your Days of Solemnity) that
many Hands may make light Work. Plus vident Oculi, quam Oculus.

If then you are pleased to make a Discovery of those TIMES and LAWS, you do
well; but if you can restore them, you do better: For (so extravagant is yet
the LITTLE-HORN in England) that if any Single Pen should draw the Curtain, and
discover the Nakedness of ANTICHRIST in those Times and Laws, they would
immediately bestow upon him the Curse of CHAM, or adjudge him to Fire and Faggot.

And the SCENT of the HORN is yet so Rank, that it is not in the Power of KING
and PARLIAMENT, to make a perfect Restoration.

Yet do not you refuse your helping hand --

Est aliquid prodire tenus, si non detur ultra. How strange would it appear, if
after all your Silence, my Goos-Quill should make a Noise, and awaken the
CAPITOL of ENGLAND, to prevent a (total) Desolation prophesied by the Lord
Jesus Christ, (Mat. 12.25.)

Let not this Service be unseasonable from

June 19, 1682. Your most humble Christian Servant Peter Chamberlen.
