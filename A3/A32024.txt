BY THE KING.

A Proclamation commanding all His Majesty's Subjects and Servants that have
any Office, Place, or Fee, of His Gift or Grant, forthwith to give their
attendance upon His Person.
WHEREAS by a Statute made in the Eleaventh year of Our Royal Progenitor King
Henry the seventh, all Our Subjects (other then those that are excepted in
that Act) having any Offices, Fees, or Annuities of Our gift or grant (besides
their common bond of Allegiance) are bound under the penalty of loosing and
forfeiting their Offices, Fees and Annuities, to give their Attendance upon Us,
when We shall fortune to go in the Wars in Our own Person, for the defense
of the Realm, or against Rebels for the subduing and suppressing of them: And
whereas diverse of Our Subjects that have Offices, Fees or annuities of Our
gift or grant, and diverse of Our Meniall Servants, who by their Places and
Offices ought at all times to give their attendance upon Our Person, have
neglected their attendance in the time of this Rebellion, when We have been
engaged in the War in Our own Person; some upon pretense of leave, or
dispensation from Us, and some upon other pretenses, which We shall no longer
permit, as well in regard of Our Honor, as Our safety, being resolved to go
in Person, for the subduing and repressing of the Rebels in Arms against Us:
We have therefore thought fit to publish this Our Proclamation, and do hereby
Command and Require, all Our Subjects and Servants whatsoever, that have any
Offices, places, Fees, or Annuities from Us or of Our gift or Grant (other
then such as are in present Service or employment in Our Armies, or are
otherwise employed in Our special service by our immediate Command) forthwith
to repair to Our Court at, Oxford, and give their Attendance upon Our Person
there with all convenient speed, and at the farthest, before the twentieth day
of April next coming, any leave or dispensation, or pretense of License from
Us, of any other pretense or excuse whatssoever notwithstanding letting them
hereby know, that in case they shall fail in their attendance at the day
before prefixed, contrary to Our Cormmand published in this Our Proclamation,
or shall notafterwards continue their Service and Attendance upon Us according
to their duties, they shall incur Our just displeasure, and We shall hold
their Fees and Annuities as void and determined, and dispose of their Places
and Offices to others, as lost and forfeited by their absence. And We do
hereby revoke and recall all licenses, leave or dispensations for absence
formerly granted or obtained.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, the twenty second day of March, in the
Nineteenth year of Our Reign. 1643
