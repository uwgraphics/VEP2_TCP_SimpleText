A PROCLAMATION For the more effectual and speedy Discovery and Prosecution of
the Popish Plot.
CHARLES R.

WHereas the late horrid Plot and Conspiracy of diverse Priests and Jesuits, and
other Papists, against His Majesty's Sacred Person, and for the Subversion of
the Protestant Religion and Government Established in this Kingdom, has been
so far Discovered that the sad Effects thereof have by His Majesty's Care, and
the Blessing of Almighty God, been hitherto prevented, and the most notorious
Offenders therein, brought to Condign Punishment, or are Secured, or fled from
Justice; and His Majesty considering that nothing would more conduce to the
lasting Safety of His Majesty, His Kingdoms, and the Protestant Religion
therein Established, then that there might be a full and perfect Discovery of
the said Conspiracy; And whereas it is to be suspected that many persons
contrary to the Duty of their Allegiance, do still conceal their knowledge of
the said Plot, and the conspirators therein, presuming that at any time
hereafter (though never so late) when they shall offer a Discovery, they may
obtain His Majesty's Pardon for all their Offenses: Now for the more speedy and
full Discovery of the said Conspiracy, and to Deter all persons whatsoever from
Concealing any longer their knowledge thereof, His Majesty does by this His
Royal Proclamation (with the Advice of His Privy Council) strictly Require and
Command all and every person and persons whatsoever who know, or can make
Discovery of any person or persons engaged in the said Conspiracy, or of any
matter or circumstance relating thereunto, to Discover and make known the same
to the Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council, or one of His Principal
Secretaries of State, or to the Lord Chief Justice, or one of the Justices of
the Court of Kings Bench, before the last day of February next, His Majesty
Declaring, That after that time His Pardon is not to be expected for any such
Treasons, or Misprisions of Treason.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the One and thirtieth day of October 1679. In
the One and thirtieth year of Our Reign.
