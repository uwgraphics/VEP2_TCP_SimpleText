At the Court at White Hall, The 13th. of July, 1682. THE King's most Excellent
Majesty: etc.
HIS Majesty having been Informed by the Lord Mayor, and diverse of the Aldermen
of London; That the Disorders and Riots arisen in that City, upon the Day
appointed for the Election of Sheriffs, have been chiefly Occasioned by the
Proceedings of the Common Hall in an Irregular way, Contrary to what has been
Anciently Accustomed: His Majesty by the Advice of his Council has thought
Fit, for the better keeping of the Peace, of the City, to Direct, and hereby to
Require the Lord Mayor to Maintain and Preserve entire the Ancient Customs of
the City. And for the better doing thereof, to take Effectual Order that at the
Common Hall to be held to Morrow, all Proceedings be begun anew, and Carried on
in the Usual manner as they ought to have been upon the Twenty Fourth Day of
June Last.
