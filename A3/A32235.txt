Death of His Royal FATHER.

Being a Form of Prayer to be Used by all those that yet Retain a spark of
Religion to God, or Loyalty to their Prince.

and Adversity.

PARIS: Printed by His MAJESTY'S special Command. 1649.

FOrasmuch as it has been the late Resolves of those that call themselves The
Commons Assembled in Parliament, to forbid Preaching and Praying in that
Vniform-way formerly agreed upon and enjoined by Our royal Father, and Free
Parliaments: Therefore We have thought good to Commend unto all Our Loving
Subjects a short and easy Method of Prayer, that by jointly seeking unto God,
he may (as from the Ninivites) turn away his fierce wrath from Us miserable
Creatures, that so We may receive forgiveness of al Our manifold witkedness
wherewith We have justly provoked his vengeance to destroy Us: Therefore as We
have humbled Our Self before him by Fasting and Prayer, so We desire all Our
Loving Subjects to do the like; that We being delivered from the destruction of
Our Enemies, may again be restored and brought to all good temprature of
Government, Love, Unity, Charity, and all other Blessings; Which is the Only
desire of

Your Afflicted Sovereign Charles Rex.
From our Court in Jersy September. 14. 1649.
A Form of PRAYER.
A Prayer for all oppressed People.
ALmighty and everlasting God, We acknowledge and confess from the bottom of
our hearts, That we are justly plagued for our manifold sins and infirmities:
We beseech thee, for the merits of thy Son, to look upon our manifold Miseries
with the eye of thy Mercy; and of thine infinite goodness vouchsafe to limit out
some portion of our Deliverance unto us, as may seem most conducing to the
Glory of thee, and thy Son Jesus Christ: let not the children of iniquity, O
Lord, any longer triumph over us; let our (...) thee let the blood of Christ
shed in his members appease thy justly incensed anger against us for our sins:
O Lord, behold how they have not only destroyed their King, who was the lively
Image of thy Sacred Majesty on Earth, but yet rest so unreasonable, and
unsatisfied, that they content not themselves with the destruction of him and
his loyal Subjects, but seek the destruction of his whole Posterity: their
tongues O Lord are far sharper then their Swords: they delight in nothing more,
then to slander the footsteps of thine Anointed: in the place where they should
proclaim Peace and Salvation, they have Trumpeted forth Rebellion, Schism, and
War, and the way of Peace they have not known: as the blind Jews, they have
denied the holy One, and the Just; and desired a Murderer and a Rober to be
granted unto them; holding it liberty to be led Captive by their own sin;
rather choosing to live in perpetual bondage under the Iron-yoak of a wicked,
perverse, and ungodly generation of men, then under the peaceable Government of
a most gracious King: forgive we beseech thee the crying sins of this Nation,
the chief of which are Perjury, Murder, Sacrilege, and contempt of thy holy
Word and Commandments; O Lord, we acknowledge there is an account due for
every idle word at thy Tribunal, then how much more for the breach of so many
Oaths, Covenants, and Solemn Declarations pronounced with lifted up hands
before thee? thou haste, O God, commanded us to fear thee, and honor thy
Vicegerent; but we quite contrary, have despised thee; and dishonored, nay
Murdered him thou command us to honor: Thou command us to love one
another, even as thy Son loved us: but instead of loving, we have hated, nay
killed and robbed one another: thou command us to eat the sweat of our own
brows, but we are contented with nothing more then to eat the sweat of others;
nay make it our work, and sweat in defrauding our Neighbors; we have neglected
those things that were necessary for our eternal Salvation, and cleaved to the
Momentary things of this World; we have not frequented thy house, and now a
Rebellious House of Robbers and Thieves prey upon us: we were become a
stiff-necked and rebellious Nation; and now thou have put an iron yoke about
our necks, and made us slaves to slaves themselves, the meanest (and most
contemptible) of the People; whose Designs are Treasonable, whose Religion is
Hypocrisy, whose Practice is Bloody, whose Power is Usurpation, whose Ambition
is Power; who by irreligious Policy seek always to prevent us from returning
to our former Allegiance to our lawful King, as thou have commanded; Lord make
them all as Athaliah, or as Rebellious Absalom, and deliver us thy people, that
put our only trust in thee; raise up we beseech thee a Moses to thy People, and
a Jehojadah to their King, that we being delivered from these Usurpers, may
serve thee with fear and reverence all our days, Amen.

A Prayer in the time of Danger.
O Lord ever merciful and pitiful to those that truly repent, and cry unto
thee in their Afflictions, though our sins are many and grievous, that we may
still rather expect thy further anger, then any Deliverance to free us thy poor
Servants from so many heavy Plagues and Burdens that are laid upon us by our
fellow Subjects, who now Usurp Rule, and Tyrannize over us; O Lord, since thy
Mercies are over all thy Works, and that thou never failest to Relieve all
those who with humble hearts, and unfeigned Affections come unto thee by
Repentance: We beseech thee for the Merits of thy only Son that suffered death
for us, to protect us from the malice of all our cruel Enemies; since they have
taken our Means, Lord, let not our Lives be the objects of their hatred; Call
in we beseech thee the Heir of our Vineyard, that we may weed out those Brambls
that with their sharp fruitless thorns catch us as in a trap, and by their
tyranny and injustice hold us till they have destroyed us: We beseech, thee
since they will not frame their Will to thy Word, according to thy Word, let
them perish: let them be as Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, sawllowed up by the
Earth or meanest of the People, although they have exalted themselves to heaven
by their Prosperity in wickedness, (accounting their success therein thy Work)
yet make them know, that they have been but all this time digging their own
graves, and earning the wages of death, nay double damnation: Lord we beseech
thee pull off this Mask of Religion from the face of Rebellion, that thy people
may be no longer deceived, but plainly see their Hypocrisy, and Restore unto
us Justice, Piety, and Truth, that so we may again be made capable of Peace,
Prosperity, and all other Blessings: O deliver thy Servants from the poison
under their tongues, from the snares of their lips, and from the fire and
swords of their words, that under Color of long-Prayers have not only sought
to devour the Houses of their Brethren, but of their King and their God,
wresting thy holy Word to their own destruction, have heaped unto themselves
false Teachers of the Calves of Jeroboam to serve themselves in their
wickedness, and Prophecy Lies till they devour the Churches Patrimony, and the
Kings Life that was her Nursing Father, and the Peoples Obedience, that were
her dear Children; their eyes swell with fatness, and as their Lust moves them,
even so they do; accounting it the dictates of thy holy Spirit, when it is the
powerful working of Satan in the Children of disobedience: by the craft of
their tongues they corrupt Diverse, so that many people fall unto them, out of
whom they suck no small advantage, they have no misfortune happens unto them,
neither are they chastized as others, but puffed up with Pride, and overwhelmed
with Cruelty, they prosper in the world, have the Houses of God and the King in
possession, they lay snares privily to take the upright in heart, that they may
shed his innocent blood, and devour him; they have prepared instruments of
death (Hooks, Pullyes, and the like) to persecute the Anointed of the Lord, and
tread down his Life and Honor in the dust: Stand up O Lord in thy wrath, lift
thy self up because of the indignation of our enemies; when thou make
Inquisition for Blood remember them; and forget not the Complaint of the poor:
let the Wicked be trapped in the work of their own hands, and sink down into
the Pit they have dug for others, and caught in their own Net; let them be
turned backward into Hell, and all perish that forget God, and set at naught
his Commandments; their mouths are full of Fraud, Deceit, and Cursing; they
are become so proud that they care not for God, neither is the Almighty in any
of their thoughts, their ways are grievous to thy People (because they discern
not thy Judgments) they defy the men that are more righteous then themselves,
they lurk privily in the theevish Corners of the streets, and in their Dens to
murder the innocent: their eyes are set against the poor, they dissemble, fall
down and humble themselves, that the Congregations of the poor may fall into the
hands of their Captains: they flatter with their lips, and dissemble with their
double hearts; they have said, With our Tongue we will prevail, we are they
that ought to speak, who is lord over us? their throat is an open Sepulcher,
the poison of Asps is under their lips, and their tongues are tipped with deceit,
their speeches are of Cursing and bitternrss, their feet are swift to shed
Blood, destruction is in their ways, and the way of Peace have they not known:
they work mischief every day, and eat up the people as it were bread: they
swear unto their Neighbors, and dis-appoint them, and their Judges take a
Reward to destroy the Righteous: Arise O Lord and save thy People that are in
great adversity and tribulation: who is God but the Lord? who has any strength
except our God: It is he that will Guide our King with strength of War, and
make his way perfect: He shall teach his hands to fight, and make his arms to
break a bow of Steel: He shall cause him to follow his Enemies and overtake
them, and shall not return till they are destroyed: the Lord will deliver him
from his Cruel Enemies, and set him up above his adversaries, even from the
strivings of the people shall he deliver him and make him the head of the
Heathen, a strange People shall serve him: then shall the English Rejoice and
give thanks to thee O Lord, and sing praises unto thy Name that have heard
their Prayers, and (after much Chastizements) have showed they loving kindness
unto thine Anointed, and to his Seed for ever.

Save us O Lord, and hear us, O King of Heaven, when we call upon thee. Amen.

A Prayer for the King.
ALmighty and most merciful Father, We humbly beg and beseech thee (for Jesus
Christ his sake) to shower down thy Blessings abundantly on the head of thy
Servant and our Dread Sovereign Lord King Charles: We beseech thee give us
Obedient and Loyal hearts to Him, as He unto thy Commandments; increase in His
Loyal Heart true Faith, godly Zeal, and love of the same; that He may always
incline to thy Will, and walk in thy ways: give Him power and strength, that
He may re-gain His Rights, vanquish and overcome all His Enemies, and after a
long and prosperous Reign, attain everlasting Joy and Felicity, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.

A Prayer for the Queen, and the rest of the Royal Branches.
O Almighty God, the Fountain of all goodness; We beseech thee to bless our
Gracious Queen Mary, and all Her Royal Offspring: give Them a full measure of
Joy after all their Sorrow, and evermore mightily Defend Them: endue them with
thy holy Spirit, enrich Them with thy Heavenly Grace, prosper Them with all
Happiness, and bring Them to thine everlasting Kingdom, through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.

A Prayer to be said this time of War.
O Almighty God, King of all kings, and Governor of all things, whose power no
Creature is able to resist; to whom it belongs justly to punish rebellious
Sinners, and to be merciful to all those that be Obedient, and truly repent:
Save and deliver us (we beseech thee) from the hands of our Cruel and Bloody
Enemies; abate their Pride, assuage their Malice, and confound all their Plots
and Devices; that thy Servants being armed with thy Defense, may be evermore
preserved from all perils and dangers to glorify thee that art the only giver
of all Victory, through the Merits of thy only Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

FINIS.
