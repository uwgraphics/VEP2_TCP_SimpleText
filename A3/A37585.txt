laid, as well in Foreign parts beyond the Seas, as also within this Nation, to
the great endangering His Highness Person, and the embroyling this Commonwealth
in new and intestine Wars, and Seditions, to the utter Ruin and Subversion
thereof, if the same had taken effect. Therefore, and for the preventing of
such great Perils and Mischiefs as may hereafter ensue, by the like detestable
Conspiracies and Practices; The Parliament, sout of a deep Sense and
