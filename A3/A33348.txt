THE WICKED LIFE, AND WOEFUL DEATH OF HEROD, the Great, In whose Time our LORD
CHRIST was Born.
HEROD, surnamed the Great, Herod's Pedigree.
was the Son of Antipas, or Antipater, an Idumaean, a prime man both for birth,
and wealth amongst them: His mothers name was Cyprus, born at an eminent place
amongst the Arabians, so that when this Herod acquired the Kingdom of Judea,
that Prophecy of old Jacob was fulfilled, Genesis 49.10. The scepter shall not
depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come.

This Antipater, riding his circuit about the Province of Judea, whereof Julius
Caesar had made him Governor, repressed them who were desirous of innovation,
both by threats, and counsel; telling them, that if they would be content with
their Prince Hyrcanus (whom Caesar also had confirmed in the High Priesthood)
they might live happily in their own possessions: but if they promised
themselves new hopes, and thought that they should gain much by innovations,
they should have him a Master instead of a Governor, and Hyrcanus a Tyrant
instead of a King: and Caesar, and the Romans bitter enemies instead of
Princes; for that they would by no means suffer any thing to be altered, from
what they had settled. But Antipater perceiving Hyrcanus to be dull, and idle,
he settled the state of the Province as himself pleased, making his elder son,
Phasaelus, Governor of Jerusalem, and the Countries adjoining: and to Herod
his second son, being then a very young man, Herod is made Governor of Galilee.
he committed the care of Galilee.

Herod being Prefect of Galilee, there was one Esekias, a Jew, who associating
to himself many other lewd persons, exercised thievery, and used to make
incursions into Syria in Troops: These Herod pursued, and having taken Esekias,
he put him to Death, He puts Esekias to death.
which fact of his gat him much ^^vour with the Syrians, which Province also was
then under his Government.

The violence, and bold nature of Herod, who was desirous of the Tyranny, much
terrified the Princes of the Jews, wherefore they addressed themselves to
Hyrcanus, and ope^^ accused Antipater; but especially they complained of Herod
for that h^ had put to Death Esekias, with many others, without any Commission
from Hyrcanus, in contempt of their Laws, by which, no man ought to suffer,
though never so wicked, unless he were first condemned by the Judges. The
Mothers also of them that were killed, ceased not daily in the Temple to weary
both the King and the people with their continual ^xclamations, desiring that
Herod might be made to give an account of these his doings before the Sanhedrim
He is cited before the Sanhedrim.
whereupon Hyrcanus moved herewith commanded H^rod to be called before the
Council, an^ to plead his own cause.

Herod having ordered the affairs of Galilee as he thought best for his own
advantage, being forewarned by his Father that he should not come into the
Council as a Private person, he took with him a moderate, but yet a sufficient
Guard: not too great, least he should terrify Hyrc^nus, nor too little, lest
he should expose him^^lf to danger from the Judgment. When Herod therefore
presented himself before the Sanhedrim in his royal robes, Appears with a
Guard.
and his Guard in arms, they were all astonished, neither durst any one of
them that accused him in his absence, now speak a word against him; but all of
them kept silence, not knowing what to do. Then one of the Council, called
Sameas, a just man, Sameas his boldness.
being not at all distracted with fear, rose up, and not only accused Herod of
presumption and violence, but laid the fault upon the Judges, and King himself
who had granted him so great a liberty, and told them, that afterward, A
prediction.
by the just Judgment of God they should be punished by Herod himself; and the
event made him a true Prophet. For the Judges of that Council, and Hyrcanus
himself were afterward put to death by Herod when he came to be King. But
Hyrcanus perceiving that the Judges were inclining to pass sentence of Death
upon Herod, put off the business till the n^xt day, and privately advised him
to shift for himself, and so he departed to Damascus as if he fled from the
King, Herod flies
and presenting himself before Sextus Caesar, and having secured his own
affairs, he professed openly, Refused to appear when again cited
that if he were again cited by the Judges he would not appear, which they took
in great disdain, and endeavored to persuade Hyrcanus that all these things
tended to his destruction.

Herod to increase his power, gave a great sum of money to Sextus Caesar, who
thereupon made him Governor of Caelosyria: He, Is made Governor of Caelosyria.
being elated with this advancement, and taking it impatiently that he had been
called before the Council, raised an Army, and went against Hy^canus: But his
Father Antipater, and Brother Phasaelus meeting him, by their entreaties
prevailed that he should not go against Jerusalem, but be content to have
affrighted them, adding that it would be dishonorable for him if he should
attempt any thing further against him that had advanced him to his dignity;
hereupon he desisted, judging it sufficient for his future hopes that he had
showed to that Nation of what power he was.

^assius and Marcus, two R^man Generals, coming into Syria, after the death of
Julius Caesar, Is confirmed in it.
confirmed Herod in his Government of Caelosyria, and delivered to him great
forces both of horse and foot, and ships at Sea, promising him also the
Kingdom of Judea, after the war should be ended which they were waging with M.
Anthony, and young Caesar.

Not long after Antipater (the Father of Herod) was Feasted at Hyrcanus his
house, at which time, one Malichus corrupting the Kings Butler, poisoned
Antipater, Antipater poisoned.
and presently raising a band of Soldiers, seized upon the Governmen of the
City of Jerusalem. Phasaelus and Herod being grievously offended hereat,
charged Malichus with their Fathers death, which he stiffly denied: But Herod
had a great mind presently to revenge the murder, and to raise an Army for
that purpose, had not Phasaelus interposed, who ju^ged it more meet to
circumvent Malichus by Policy, least they should seem to be the beginners of a
civil war, and accordingly Ph^^aelus made as though he accepted of M^lichus his
justification, and believed that he was not guilty of his Fathers Death, and so
busied himself in building a stately Monument for him.

In the mean while Herod coming to Samaria, and finding it in a desperate
estate by reason of their Civil dissentions, he appeased the discords amongst
the Inhabitants and restored it to peace: and not long after, the Feast of
Penticost approaching, Herod goes to Jerusalem
he went to Jerusalem accompanied with some soldiers, of whom Malichus being
afraid, persuaded Hyrcanus not to suffer him to enter, which Hyrcanus
accordingly did, alleging that amongst the holy People that came to the
Feast, it was not lawful to bring in a mixed multitude of profane men. But
Herod making small account of the prohibition, entered the City by night, and
thereby mightily terrified Malichus; who, thereupon, according to his wonted
dissimulations, openly bewailed with tears the Death of Antipater, as of his
dear Friend: And it was judged meet by Herod's Friends, that he should take no
notice of this dissimulation, but courteously again intertain Malichus.

He is excited to revenge his Fathers death.
Herod by letters certified Cassius of his Fathers death, who very well knowing
the temper of Malichus, wrote back unto Herod to revenge the same, and secretly
also gave order to the Tribunes that were at Tire to be aiding to Herod in his
so just undertaking.

Cassius afterward having taken the City of Laodicea, Governors came from
every place, bringing Crowns and Presents, to him: and here Herod, expecting
that Malichus should do the like, intended to have him punished for the
Murder of his Father: But Malichus had another design on foot, purposing, that
whilst Cassius was busy in prosecuting the war against M. Anthony, to stir
up the Nation of the Jews to revolt from the Romans, and to depose Hyrcanus,
and get the Kingdom to himself; But Herod being Politic and understanding of
the treachery, invited him and Hyrcanus, with some other of their companions to
supper: At which time he sent one of his servants, under pretense of providing
for the Banquet, whereas indeed he sent him to the Tribunes to desire them to
set upon Malichus, with their weapons, who being mindful of the Commands of
Cassius, finding Malichus, they ra^^^m through, and slew him, at which Hyrcanus
being astonished, Malchus slain.
fell into a swoun, and being scarcely come to himself, he asked who had slain
Malichus, and when one of the Tribunes answered that it was done by the command
of Cassius, he said, Truly Cassius has preserved me and my Country, in kiling
him who was a Traitor to both; but whether herein he spoke as he thought, or
that through fear only he seemed to approve the fact, is uncertain.

After Cassius was gone out of Syria, A sedition at Jerusalem.
there arose a sedition at Jerusalem. For Paelix, who was left there by C^ssius
with soldiers, in revenge of the death of Malichus, set upon Phasaelus, and
the people betook themselves to their Arms. At which time Herod was with
Fabius, the Governor of Damascus, and had a mind to help his Brother, but was
hindered by a sudden sickness: Yet did Phasaelus get the better of Faelix,
forcing him into the Town, and afterward agreeing upon quarter, suffered him
to go out: But he was very angry with Hyrcanus, that after the receipt of so
many favors from him, he yet favored F^elix, and suffered the Brother of
Malichus to seize upon some Castles, and amongst the rest, of the Castle of
Massada, which was a most strong piece.

Herod's Valor.
As soon as Herod was recovered, he went against the Brother of Malichus, and
took from him all the Castles that he had seized upon, and Massada also, where
he took him Prisoner, yet afterward set him at liberty upon composition. He
also recovered three Castles that were seized upon by Masion, the Tyrant of the
Tyrians in Galilee, but gave Quarter to all the Soldiers, and sent them home
well rewarded, by which means he procured the love of the Citizens, His Policy
but he greater hatred of the Tyrant.

Shortly after Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, Brother to Hyrcanus, invaded
Judaea, being assisted by Ptolomei, the son of Menaeus, and Fabius the Governor
of Damascus, and Masion, the Tyrant of the Tyrians, who adhered to him for the
hatred that he bore to Herod, whom Herod meeting, when they had scarce entered
the borders of Judea, overcame t^^^ in Battle, He overcomes Antigonus.
and drove them thence, whereupon Hyrcanus honored him with Crowns, as soon
as he returned to Jerusalem: For he was already accounted as one of the Family
of Hyrcanus, being to marry Mariamn^, or Mary, the daughter of Alexander, the
son of Aristobulus, the Brother of Hyrcanus, and of Alexandra, the daughter of
Hyrcanus.

M. Anthony having overcome Brutus and Cassius, there met him Ambassies from
all Nations in Bythinia, and amongst the rest, some of the Rulers of the Jews,
to accuse Phasaelus, and Herod, alleging that Hircanus ruled only in show,
but in truth, all the power was in the two Brothers: Yet Anthony highly
honored Herod, who was come thither to wipe off all those objections, whereby
it came to pass that his adversaries were not so much as admitted to speak
with Anthony: and this Herod had obtained by his Bribes.

Yet not long after there came an hundred of the most honorable amongst the
Jews to Daphne, near Antioch in Syria, to Anthony, Herod accused to Anthony.
to accuse Phaesaelus and Herod, having chosen out of their whole number the
most Eloquent, to manage their business: But Mess^la undertook the defense of
the two Brothers, Herod accused to Anthony.
with whom also Hyrcanus joined, who had betrothed his Granddaughter to Herod.
Both parties being heard, Anthony asked Hyrcanus whether of the two parties
were fittest to Govern a Commonwealth? who speaking for the young men, But
acquitted.
Anthony that loved them for their Fathers sake, his old Friend, he made them
both Tetraerchs, leaving to them the Government of all Judaea, writing his
letters to the same purp^se, and clapped fifteen of their Adversaries into
prison, and would have put them to death, had not Herod entreated for them. But
when the People did nothing but ran upon Herod, Anthony in displeasure slew
them all.

Antig^nus the Son of A^^st^bulus hired the Parthians to tran^ ate the King
^ome from Hyrc^nus to himself and to kill (...), who c^ming along with him, and
some Jews also joining themselves to him, he came to Jerusalem, and they set
upon the Kings House: War between Antigonus and Herod.
But Phasaelus and Herod defended it against them; and in the Market place,
overcomming them in a fight, forced them to fly into the Temple, where they
shut them in, and placed sixty men in some adjoining houses to prevent their
flight: but the people having the two Brethren set fire on those Houses, and
burnt the men in them, which so enraged Herod that he slew many of the people:
and each laying wait for the other, ev^ry day some were murdered.

The day of Pent^c^st being come, many thousands of men, as well armed as
unarmed gathered together about the Temple from all parts of the Country, Herod
prevails.
and seized upon the Temple, and City, all but the Kings House, which Herod
kept with a few soldiers, as Ph^selus did the walls. These brothers assisting
each other, assaulted their enemies, in the suburbs forced many thousands of
them to fly, some into the City, and some into the Temple, and others into a
rampire that was near the City.

Hereupon Antigonus desired that P^c rus, the G^^erall of the P^^thians might
be admitted to make peace between them: The Parthians falsehood.
which Phasaelus assented to* and Pacorus persuaded him to go with him as an
Ambassador to Barzapharnes (an other General of the Parthians) laying an
ambush for him by the way: Phasaelus assented, though much against the mind of
his Brother Herod, and was willing to go with Pac^ru^, and took Hyrcanus along
with him. Pac^rus leaving two hundred Horsemen with Herod, and ten whom they
called El^utheri, went along with the Ambassadors. And as soon as they were
come into Galile, Barzapharnes entertained them with a cheerful countenance,
and bestowed gifts upon them, but watched an opportunity to entrap them: and so
Phasaelus was brought with his company to a place near the Sea side called
Ecdippon; where Ophellus, a rich S^ri^^. understanding of the treachery
intended against them, offered Ph^sae^us some ships to carry him away: But he
unwilling to leave Hyrcanus, and his Brother Her^^ in danger, expostulated with
Barzapharnes about the injury offered to ^^m who were Ambassadors, who swore
that these things were not true, and presently went to Pac^^us.

No sooner was he gone, but Hyrcanus and P^^^^lu^ were clapped up in Prison,
much detesting the perf diousness of the Parthians: and an Eunuch also was sent
to Herod with a command to surprise him if he could get him out of Jerusalem.
Herod flies from Jerusalem.
Herod having intelligence what had happened to his Brother, taking with him
such forces as he had in readiness, and his Mother Cybele, his sister Salome,
his wife Mariamne, and his wives Mother Alexandra, the daughter of Hyrcanus,
and his youngest Brother Pheroras, with their servants, he privately by night
took his flight into Idumaea.

In their journey, his Mother, by the overthrow of her Coach, was in great
danger of death, and Herod, fearing least the enemies should overtake them
whilst they stayed there, drew forth his sword, thinking to kill himself: He
would have killed himself.
But being restrained by those which stood by, he went toward Massada, a very
strong place, which is seated in Arabia, and Palestine, by the nearest way that
he could possible: The Parthians first, and also the Jews pursuing him by that
he was sixty furlongs from the City, but he repelled them both in fight.

The next day after Herod had fled from Jerusalem, the Parthians plundered the
City, and the Kings house; Jerusalem plundered.
only the Treasure of Hyrcanus which was three hundred Talents, remained
untouched. A great part also of Herod's substance which he had not carried away
with him, they siezed upon; and not satisfied therewith, they harrassed all the
the Country also, and rased the rich City of Marissa.

Antig nus being thus settled in Judaea by the Parthians, Antigonus made King
of the Jews.
he received into his Custody Hy canus, and Phasae^us, who were prisoners: yet
he was much grieved that the women were got away, whom he had intended to
deliver to the Pa^th^^^^, tog there with the money which he had promised to gave
them. Being afraid also least Hyrcanus should ag^in (...) the favor of the
people be restored to his Kingdom and Priesthood, he cut off his ears, Cuts

sought to lay violent hands upon himself, but being hindered by reason of his
chains, he dashed out his brains against a stone: Yet before he was quite dead,
hearing by a woman that his Brother Her^d was escaped, he greatly rejoiced that
there was one left to revenge his death. The Parthians, though they missed of
the women, which they most of all desired, yet having settled all things at
Jerusalem with Antigonus, when they departed, took Hyrcanus along with them
Prisoner into Parthia.

Herod not hearing of his Brother Phasaelus his death, Herod flees to Malchus

went to M^lchus, the King of the Arabians [Nabathaeans] who were obliged to
him by many favors he had done them, purposing so soon as possiblely he could
to redeem his Brother for three hundred Talents from the enemy: For which cause
he carried along with him young Phasaelus, his Brothers Son, about seven years
old, to leave him for a pledge with the Arabians: But there met him some that
were sent from Malchus, Is rejected by him.
to command him to depart from the bounds of his Kingdom, for so the Parthians
had required: Yet he pretended that he did it by the request of his Noble men,
purposing to cozen him of that great treasure which his Father Antipater had
committed to his trust. Herod taking this very heavily, turned aside into a
certain Temple, where he had left many of his followers: but the next day, when
he came to Rhinocorura he heard of his Brothers death.

Malchus, upon second thoughts, repenting of his ingratitude, sent in all have
after Herod: but the messengers could not overtake him: for he was gone far on
his journey toward Pelusium, Herod goes into Egypt.
where the Mariners that were sailing to Alexandria, refused to take him in.
There, by the Magistrates of the City he was honorably entertained, and
brought to Cle^patra, the Queen, who could not prevail with him to stay at that
time, because he was hastening to Rome, From thence into Italy.
though the sea was very tempestuous, and as then the affairs in Italy were in
no very good condition. As he sailed from A^exandria toward Phamphilia he met
with a very great storm, which made him cast overboard much of his substance,
and scarcely got he to Rhodes.

He comes to Rhodes.
At Rhodes two of his greatest friends met him, Sappinas, and Ptolomaeus, and
finding that the City had suffered much in the war against Cassius, he could
not be restrained, no not by his present poverty, but that he would do
something for it, even beyond his ability: After which he caused a Frigot to be
built, and embarking himself with his Friends in it, So into Italy.
he arrived at Brundusium in Italy, and from thence went to Rome, declaring
unto M. Anthony those things that had happened to himself and his Family, and
that thorough many tempests, and dangers he had retired unto him, Anthony
favors him.
as his only refuge, in whom all his hope lay.

This Narration moved compassion in Anthony; remembering also his Fathers
friendship toward him, but that which prevailed most, was the promise of a
great sum of money if he would help him to the Kingdom: Anthony also hated
Antigonus as a man of a turbulent spirit, and an enemy to the Romans. Caesar
And Caesar.
also partly for that Antipater [Herods Father] had been fellow soldier with
his Father in Egypt, and for other courtesies which he had showed him, and
partly to gratify Anthony, whom he saw to be well affected to Herod, was
willing to promote his designs: whereupon the Senate being assembled, Messala,
and Atpatinus, brought in Herod, and after they had praised him, reckoning up
the love, and services that both he, and his Father had done for the Romans,
and accusing Antigonus both for former crimes, and for that newly he had
received the Kingdom of the Jews from the Parthians in contempt of the Romans:
and when Anthony also had declared to the Senate how much conducing it was to
the P^rthian war, then in hand, that Herod should be made King: Antigonus was
declared an enemy, The Senate make him King.
and the Kingly Title was devolved upon Herod by their genearll suffrage.

Whilst these things were transacting at Rome, Ventidius, the Roman General
easiely recovered Palestine, Antigonus, the King thereof, being much afraid of
him, and he exacted great sums of money from all men, but especially from
Antigonus, Herod's Family besieged.
who in Herod's absence had besieged his Family in Massa^a, which place, though
it abounded with all other kinds of provision, yet it wanted water, so that
Joseph, Herod's Brother, who commanded in chief there, with two hundred of his
friends intended to fly to the Arabians; for that he heard that Malchus now
repented him of his former ingratitude toward Herod: But the very night a
great shore of rain falling filled their cisterns, which made him chan^e his
purpose, A special providence.
and the next morning, making a ga^lant salley forth, they killed many of
Antigonus his men.

Ventidius encamped near to Jerusalem, and drew from Antigonus a sufficient sum
of money, and to the intent that his fraudulent dealing should not be
discovered, he left one Silo there, with part of his forces, under a pretense
of helping Joseph, who also was to be feed by Antigonus, lest he should raise
him some new troubles; which Antigonus submitted to, hoping that the Parthians
would shortly come to his aid.

After the Senate was dismissed, Anthony, and Caesar went out, leading Herod
betwe n them, who was also accompanied with the Consuls, and other Magistrates,
and so they went all together up into the Cap t^l, to sacrifice to the Gods,
and to place there the D^ ^^e of the Senate: and the new King, the first day of

Herod being returned out of Italy to Pt^^e^ais, quickly gathered store of
Soldiers, both of such as he hired, as also of his own Countrymen, p^lling
through Galile against Antig^nus: being aided by Si^, and V^^^dius, who were
comman^e^ by (...) to conduct him into his Kin dom; and as he w^nt on, his
forces daily increased, and all Galile, except a ^ew, fi^ed with him.

he hasted toward Jerusalem; and though Antig^^us had laid ambushments for him
in diverse places, yet he drew near to the City, Silo following and the Jews
being terrified with his power. When he had encamped on the West side of the
City, they upon the walls shot at him with darts and arrows: others also
sallying out in Troops, beat up some of his quarters. Then did Herod by an
Herald proclaim round about the Walls, that he came for the public good, and
to preserve the City from ruin, and withal, he promised pardon for all former
actings. On the other side Antigonus, directing his speech to Silo, and the
Romans, told them, that it was unjustly done of the Senate to give the Kingdom
to Herod, a private man, and an Idumae^^, and so but an half-Jew, whereas by
custom it was to be given to one of the Highpriests line. His men also
shooting valiantly from the Towers, drove the enemy from the walls: and Silo
(who was beforehand bribed by Antigonus) suborned some of his Soldiers to
demand of Her^d more provisions, and larger pay, and to be withdrawn into
commodious winter quarters. The Army being thus troubled, and beginning to
dislodg, Herod entreated the Captains, and Soldiers of Silo's Army, that they
would not now forsake him, he being sent both by Anthony, Caesar, and the
Senate, to take possession of the Kingdom; and withal he sent into all the
Country, and brought in such store of provisions, that there was no occasion
for Sil^, and his Army to complain. He commanded his Friends also that
inhabited about Samaria, that they should bring to Jericho Corn, Wine, Oil,
Cattle, and other necessaries, that the Soldiers for the future might have
plenty.

Antigonus having intelligence hereof, sent forth some to intercept the
victualers: but Herod taking with him some Cohorts, viz. five of the R man's,
and as many of the Jews, with some foreign Soldiers, and a few Horse mixed
with them, Herod takes Jericho.
flew out to Jeric^^ and found the City forsaken of the Inhabitants, and five
hundred Families of them were fled to the tops of the Hills, whom h^ took, and
dismissed in safety: But the Romans entering the City, plundered it, where they
found all sorts of preciou^ movables. H^^od leaving a Garrison there, returned
to his Camp before Jerusalem, and then dismissed the Romans, sending them into
winter quarters in Idumaea, Samaria, and Galile, which Countries were lately
surrendered to them: But Antigonus by bribes obtained of Silo, that part of the
Roman Army should be quartered in Lyada, currying thereby favor with Anthony:
and thus the Romans lived in plenty, and without bearing Arms.

mischief. Then he march^d with his whole Army, whom the enemy met, and
encountered resolutely, in so much as Herod's left wing began to waver, till

ground, and caused the enemy to flee, whom he followed as far as Jordan: by

Soldiers a hundred and fifty Drachm^s, and more to his Captains, he ^^sm fled
them into their winter quarters.

There came Silo to him with his Captains who had wintered with Antig^nus, and
who now would maintain them no longer comma^ding the Inhabitants thereabout to
spoil the Country of all v^ctuals, and to retire to the mountains that the
Romans might p^rish through famine: But Herod committed the charge ^f

Ventilius in Syri^ sent for Silo to assist him against the Parthians, but
commanded him first to assist Herod, and to bring Herod, and the rest of the
Auxiliaries of those Provinces along with him: But Herod sending Silo to him,
went himself with his Soldiers against the Thieves that lived in Caves; and in
the mean time made Ptolomy Governor of the Country, which fell out ill for
him; for being set upon by those who had formerly disturbed the Country, he was

their united forces they might make war upon Antig^nus. Thus after much
entreaty he was reconciled to M^chaeras, and so leaving his Brother J s^p^ with
his Army, he commanded him in his absence that he should not put a l to the
hazard of a battle; but himself hasted to Anthony, Herod goes to Anthony.
whom he found besieging S^m^^^^, a City near to the River Euphrates, and
carried a^^^g with him some Auxiliaries both of Horse, and Foot. Ant^^ny
entertained him very honorably, and much praised him for his valor.

Joseph, unmindfull of his Brothers command, taking with him his own forces,
and five Roman Cohorts that were given him by Machaeras, went toward Jericho,
purposing to reap the enemies Corn, now that it was ripe, and encamped in the
mountains, because the Roman Cohorts were raw Soldiers, most of them being
lately taken up in Syria: yet there he was circumvented by the enemy in the
midst of those fastnesses, and having lost six Cohorts, he himself valiantly
fighting, was slain: Joseph is slain.
Antigonus being in a rage, caused the dead body of Joseph to be whipped,
though Pheroras his Brother, offered fifty Talents to have redeemed it: After
this loss, the Galilaeans revolting from their Governors, drowned those that
were of Herod's p^rty in the Lake: In Idumaea also there were many innovation^.

Anthony having made peace with his enemy* commanded Cains Sos^us to assist
Her^d against Antig us with two Cohorts: When Herod came to D^phne, the Su^urb
of Antioch, he heard of his Brother J^s^phs death, which caused him to hasten
his journey, and coming to Mount Liba^^^, he took thence with him eight hundred
men, and one Cohort of the Romans, and so came to Pt^l^mais, from whence in the
night he passed with his Army through Galile: Here his enemies met him, Herod
overcomes his Enemies.
whom he overcame in fight and forced them into the Castle, from whence they
had issued the day before: Them he assaulted, but was compelled to desist by
reason of the extremity of the weather, and to retreat into some neighboring
Villages: but upon the coming of another Cohort from An^h ny, they in the
Castle were so affrighted, that they forsook the same by night: Herod then
hastened to Jericho, purposing to revenge his Brothers death: and being come
thither, he feasted his No^les, and the feast being ended, A special
providence.
and his guests dismissed, he retired into his chamber, and presently the room
wherein they had supped, being now empty of company fell down without hurting
any, which made many to think that surely Herod was beloved of God who had so
miraculously preserved him.

The next day six thousand of the enemies came down from the Mountains to fight
with him, and their forlorn-hope with darts and stones so terrified the Romans
and some of Herod's Soldiers that they fled, and Herod himself received a wound
in his side.

Antigonus, desiring to have his strength seem greater than it was, sent one of
his Captains, named Pappus, with some forces into Samaria, whilst himself went
against Machaeras. In the mean time Herod took in five Towns, and therein put
two thousand of the Garrison Soldiers to the sword, and setting the ^owns on
fire, he went against Pappus, and was strengthened by many that came to him ^ut
of Jerico and Ju^ea* yet was the enemy so confident that he would j^yn bat^le
with him, but in fight, Herod's beats his Enemies.
H rod overcame them, and being inflamed with a desire to revenge his Brothers
death, he pursued th^^ that fled, sl w many of them, and fol^owed them into a
Village, and there sl^w many more o^ them who retreated into houses, the rest
fled: After which victory, He^^d had presently gone to Jerusalem, and put an
end to the war, had not the shar^^ess of the winter hindered him; for now
Antigonus bethought himself to leave the City, and fly elsewhere for safety.

a yet hot in his Armor* went into a chamber, attended with one only servant
to wash himself, wherein some of his enemy armed whom fear had forced thither,
were hidden; and whilst h^ was naked, and washing himself, first one, and then
a second, and a third, ran out armed with naked swords in their hands so
asto^^shed that they were glad to s^ve thems lv^s without pr^ff ring the least

H^^od in the beginning of the th rd year after he had been declared King at
Rome, Her d ^esieges Jerusalem.
comin with an Army ^o J^^usalem, encamped ne^r the City, and from thence
remov^ng to that p ace where the Wall* were fittest to be assaulted, he p^^ched
his Te^ts before the Temple, intending to attempt them, as P^mpey had done in
times past: and h ving encompassed the place with three Bulworks, by the help
of many workmen he raised his batteries; fetching materials from all places
thereabouts, and appointing fit men to oversee the work; and then himself went
to Samaria to solemnize his Marriage with Mariamne, Marries Mariamne.
the Daughter of Alexander, the Son of Aristobulus, who was formerly betrothed
to him.

The Marriage ceremony being over, Sos^us came with an Army of Horse and Foot,
being sent by Anthony to the aid of Herod, and Herod also took a great party
with him from Samaria to Jerusalem; Herod's great Army.
so that the whole Army being come together, consisted of eleven Legions of
^oot, ^^d six thousand Horse, besides the S^^i^^ Auxiliaries, which were very
many, and so they pitched on the N^rth sid^ of the City. Over this great Army
were two Generals, (...), and Herod, who purposed to displace Ant^g^nus as an
enemy to the people of Ro^^, and to establish Herod in the Kingdom according to
the Decree of the Senate.

The Jews being gathered together out of the whole Country, The Jews fight

and shut up within the Walls, made a valiant resistance, boasting much of the
Temple of the Lord, and saying, that the Lord would not forsake his people in
the time of danger. By secret sallies also they burnt up, and spoiled all
provision without the City both for Man and Horse, whereby the besiegers began
to be pinched: But Herod provided against their excursions, by placing
ambushments in convenient places, and sending parties to fetch in provision
from afar off, so that in a short time the Army was well furnished with all
necessaries.

By reason of the multitude of workmen the three Bulworks were soon finished,
it being Summer time, so that no untemperateness of weather hindered them: and
with his Engines Herod often battered the Walls, and left nothing unassayed: but
the besieged fought valiantly, and were every way as active and subtle to make
void his endeavors; often sallying forth, and firing their works, both those
that were finished, and others that were but begun, and coming to handistrokes
with the Romans, they were nothing inferior to them but only in Martial skill.

brought a famine upon the besieged Jews, notwithstanding which they built a
new Wall within that which was beaten down by the battering Rams, and so
countermined the Enemies mines, that many times they came to handistrokes under
gr^und, and making use of despair instead of courage, they held it out unto the
last, though Pollio, the Phari ee, and Samias his Disciple advised them to
receive Herod into the City, saying, that they c^uld not avoi^ his being their
King by reason of their sins.

They held out the siege for five months space, though there was so great an
Army before the City: But at length twenty of Herod's choicest Soldiers got
upon the Wall, and after them the Centurions or S^sius. So that the first Wall
was taken on the forti'th day, and the second on the fiftieth, and some
Galleries about the Temple were burnt down, which Herod charged (though falsly^
upon Antigonus, thereby to bring him into hatred with the people. When the
outward part of the Temple was taken, and the lower City, the J^ws fled into
the inward part of the Temple, and the upper City: and fearing lest they should
be hindered from offering their daily Sacrifices unto God, they sent Ambassadors
unto Herod, to desire leave that such Beasts only might be brought in which
were to be sacrificed: This request Herod easily granted, hoping that by this
means they would leave their obstinacy, and submit to him. But perceiving that
this courtesy prevailed not, and that they were still resolute to continue the
Sovereignty in Antigonus, Jerusalem taken by Herod.
he gave a general assault and won the City on the Kalends of Janu^ry, on the
second month, Cislu, being the day on which the Jews were wont to celebrate a
Fast in commemoration of the holy Roll that was burnt by Jehoiakim.

The City being taken by assault, all places were filled with murders: the
Romans being incensed against the Jews for holding out so long; Cruelty.
and the Herodian Jews endeavoring to extirpate the contrary faction, so that
there were continual slaughters in the Porches, and Houses, yea, the reverence

a capital crime, be^^re he was King, sp^ring only (...), and S^mias, his

Then did he gather together all the Regal O^^aments, and much silver and gold
which he ex^cted from rich me^, all which he gave to Anthony and his Soldiers.
He put to death also forty and five of Antigonus his chief Noble men, setting
watches at their doors that none of them might be carried out under pretense of
being dead: and what gold or silver soever was found, was all carried to Herod,
so that there was no end of the peoples miseries, the covetousness of the needy
conquerours consuming all their estates. The fields also lay untilled, because
it was the Sabbaticall year, in which it was unlawful to sow the ground.

Of these miserable times, amongst others, were spectators, Who were spect^tors

Holy, and Joseph: Anna also the Prophetess of the Tribe of As^r, and Simeon the
Just, who received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death,
till he had seen the Lord Christ. Luke 2.26.

Anth ny being thus possessed of Antigonus, intended to keep him Prisoner to
adorn his Triumph; But Herod feared that if Antigonus was brought to Rome by
Anthony, he might there contend with him before the Senate for the Kingdom:
Considering also how the Nation of the Jews hated him, and favored Antig^nus:
he thereupon gave great sums of money to Anth^ny to cut off his head, Anthony
slew Ant^gonus.
which accordingly he did at Antioch: Antigo^us being the first King that was
thus put to death by the Romans: and in him ended the Principality of the
H^sm^naean^: It being from the Captainship of Judas M^ccabaeus to the death of
Antig^nus a hundred twenty six years, and two or three months, and by this
means H^r^^, a stranger, got the Kingdom, and was totally freed from his fears.

Hy^^^^as (as we heard before) being carried Prisoner to Phraates, the King of
the Parthians, he entreated him courteously for the Nobility of his descent,
and after a time, freeing him from Prison, he suffered him to live in Babylon,
Hyrcanus honored in Babylon.
where were great store of Jews, who honored him no less than as their King
and High Priest: and not only they of Babylon, but all the rest of the Nation
of the Jews did the like, who in old time had been carried captive beyond the
River Euphrates by the Ass^rians, of whom there were many millions. But
Hyrcanus hearing that Herod was made King of the Jews, he began to cast his
hopes that ways, expecting favor from Herod, whose life he had saved when he
was called in question before the Sanhedrim. He consulted therefore with the
Jews that came to visit him, about his return into Judaea, who by all means
dissuaded him from it, yet could they not prevail with him. Besides, Herod
desired by all means to get the poor old man into his clutches, Herod's subt^lty.
and thereupon wrote to him to get leave of Phraates, and the Jews that he
might return, and that they would not envy him the joint ru^e with his Son in
Law, the time being now come wherein he could requite the favors that Hyrcanus
had showed hi^, in being his nourish r, and preserver. He sent also his
Ambassa^or to P^ra^t^s with great Presents, intre^ting him that he would not
hinder him from being thankful to him that had deserved so w^l^ of him.
Hyrcanus being forward of himself, dism^ssed by the Parthian^, and honorably
^^^nishe^ by the J^w^ for the expenses of his j^urney, he came at last to
H^r^^, who entertained him with all honor, gave him the upper hand in all
Assemblies, and the more honou^able place at all feasts, calling him Fat^^^,
hereby to delu^e him, lest he should suspect any treach^ry.

to (...) for a Priest of a base parentage, whom formerly he had been acq^ainted
with, of the rac^ of th^se Priests that had been carried away beyond Euphrate,
whose n^me was Ananclius, or Hananeel, and to him he gave ^he H^^^-^^iesthoo^.

Alexand^a takes it ill.
This Alexand^a the Daughter of H^rc^^us, the Wife of Alexander, the Son of
(...), and Mother in Law of Herod, took in ill part; for that Ari^bu^u^ her
Son, and Brother of M^^ia^re wa^ neglected, and another from a strange place
should be made High Priest: whereupon she wrote to Cleopatra Queen of Egypt,
and Anthoni^s darling, that she would procure the High Priesthood of Anth^n^
for her Son. Cleopatra neglected her request; but shortly after, D^^lius a
friend of Anth^^nie^ coming into Ju^ea, ^^rswaded her to send the Pictures of
her Son Arist^bulus, and of her Daughter Mariamne to Anthony, who then would
deny her nothing: This she assented to, and sent them by Dellius, who told
Anthony that they seemed rather to be of a Divine than of a humane race.

Anthony was much inflamed herewith, Anthony sends for Aristobulus.
yet thought it undecent to send for a Lady that was married to Herod, shunning
also the jealousy of Cleopatra: whereupon he wrote to Alexandra to send her
Son to him under some honest pretense: But these things coming to the ears of
Herod, he thought it not safe that Ari^tobulus, now in the flower of his age,
being but sixteen, should be sent to Anthony, the most potent man amongst the
Romans, and very much given to his lusts. Wherefore he wrote back, that if the
youth did but step out of the Kingdom, all the Country would be up in Arms, the
Jew^ hoping for some innovations under a new King, and by this means he
satisfied Anthony.

Her^d being continually molested with the entreaties of his Wife Mari^mne,
that he would give the High Priesthood to her Brother Ari^tobulus, it being his
right, he called a Council of his frien^s, to whom he inveighed against his
Mother in Law A^^xandra, as if she had privately wrought treason against his
Kingdom, and had endeavored by Cleopatra's means to translate it to young
Aristobulus; yet, lest he should seem to neglect both his piety to her, and the
rest of that kindred, he told them he would now restore the Priesthood to her
Son, Aristobulus made High Priest.
which hitherto A^anelus had supplied, ^y reason of the young man's tender
years: Alexan^ra being herewith overjoyed, and withal grieved th^^ she was
suspected, tell a weeping, clearing her self of those accusations, and gave him
many thank for her Sons honor, promising that hereafter she would be most
obedient unto him And thus Herod, in the lifetime of An^n^^u^, gave the
High Priesthood to Ari ^^bulus, being then but s^venteen years old.

Yet Herod fearing lest his Mother in Law Alexandra Alexandra confined.
should seek occasion to raise new troubles, confined her to the Palace, and
commanded her to do nothing by her own authority: yea, he set so strict a guard
over her, that nothing was concealed from him of all that she did, to the very
expenses of her Table. This she took very heavily, and wrote to Cleopatra, She
complains to Cleopatra.
complaining of her hard condition, and desiring her to yield her assistance:
Cleopatra advised her with her Son to fly to her into Egypt, which she liked,
and therefore provided two Coffi^s, one for her self, the other for her Son,
commanding her servants that were privy to the plot, to carry them out by
night, and to convey them to a Ship that was ready prepared to carry them into
Egypt. This business Aesopus, one of her servants, blabbed to Sabbation, a
friend of Alexanders, supposing that he had known all before: which as soon as
Sabbati n knew, though hitherto he was an enemy of Herod's, as being suspected
to have been in the plot of poisoning his Father Antipa^^, he took this
occasion of being reconciled to the King, by discovering the matter. She is
surprised by Herod.
Herod being thus informed of the ^l^t, dissembled the matter till it was in
execution, and then surprised her in her flight, and brought her back: Yet did
he pardon her fault, not indeed daring to punish her, lest thereby he should
discontent Cle patra, that was willing to take any occasion against him:
wherefore under a color of a magnanimous spirit, he made show as if he
pardoned her out of mere clemency.

The Feast of Tabernacles being now come, the new High Priest Aristobulus,
being just past seventeen years old, was to offer Sacrifice according to the
Law, and being clad in his Pontifical attire, he came to the Altar, and
performed the Ceremony with all decency, whose excellent beauty and stature,
Aristobulus highly honored.
being higher than was usual for his age, and carrying in his countenance the
honor of his Lineage, drew the eyes, and love of all the multitude upon him,
every one calling to mind the worthy, and memorable actions of his Grandfather
Ari^tobulus, and therefore, as overcome with affections toward him, they were
so overjoyed that they could not contain themselves, but openly prayed for him,
and wished him all joy, and that more freely than was meet in those jealous
times under such a King, proclaiming openly both the memory, and thanks that
they owed to the Famely for all the benefits they had received from it.

As soon as the Feast was ended, Aristobulus was entertained at a Banquet by
his Mother Alexandra: Herod also pretended favor to him, and enticed him into
a convenient place to sport with him after the manner of young men, and when
they were hot, and weary, and left their sport, they walked out to the Fish
Ponds, which were near the Court to take the fresh air, where also they beheld
some of the servants that were swimming: At last by the persuasion of Herod,
Arriobulus undrest himself and went in amongst them: Then they, who were
suborned by Her^d, as it were in sport and jest, ducked him as he was swiming,
holding him under water, He is drowned.
and never left off till they had drowned him. This was the end of Aristobulus
in the eighteenth year of his age, and in the first year of his
High Priesthood, which immediately returned to Ananelus.

The report of these things coming to the Women, they were all on an uprore,
and did nothing but weep, and howl over the body of the young man: Yea sorrow
overspread the whole City, every one bewailing the calamity as if it had been
h^s own: But Herod endeavored by all means to make the people beli^ve as if it
had fallen out by chance without his privity, not only feigning sorrow, Herod's
subtilty.
but tears and grief also: and that he might the more comfort the Women, he
buried the bo^y in a most magnificent manner, being liberal to prodigality in
adorning his Monument, and in perfumes, and other ^recious things.

But his Mother Alexan^ra, knowing the treason, though she was often ready to lay
violent han^s u on her self, yet repressed her passion, seeming not to be
suspicious, till an opportunity of revenge might offer it self.

And shortly after she wrote to Cleopatra of the treachery of Herod, and of the
lamentable death of her Son. Alexandra complains to Cleopatra.
Cleopatra pitying her misfortune, to^k a particular care of thy business, as
if it had been her own, and never rested from persuading Antho^^ to revenge the
young man's death: telling him that it was an unpardonable crime, that he who by
his help, enj^yed a Kingdom that was another right, should rage so insolently
against the famely of the lawful Kings. Anthony being prevailed with hereby,
when he came to Laodicea in Syria, sent for Herod to come before him to answer
what should be objected against him about the Death of Arist^bulus.

Herod questioned by Anth ^y.
Herod, during t^^ time of his absence committed the care of his King^om to hi^
(...) J^^^p, privately commanding him, the (...) should do him any mischief, he
should presently put his W^fe Mariamne to death, pretending that he so lov^^
her, that he should esteem it a great wrong if any but himself should enjoy her
beauty, yea though it was after his Death.

When Herod came to Ant^ ^^, he so appeased him with rich presents that he
brought on purpose with him from Jerusalem, But cleared by his bribes.
and by his frequent conferences with him, that afterward Cleopatr^'s
instigations prevailed little: For Anthony said, that it was not fit that a
King should be accountable for his actions, otherwise he would cease to be a
King^ For having once given him the honor, the free exercise of his Kingly
power was to be admitted unto him. He told Cleopatra also, that it was not fit
for her too much to meddle with other men's matters.

During Herod's absence, Joseph governing the Kingdom, he had occasion many
times to converse with Mariamne, partly upon business, and partly to do her
honor, and in their discourses there was often mention made how much Herod
loved her, which discourse was laughed at by the Ladies, especially by
Alexandra: But he was carried on with such a desire of proving the Kings love
to them, that he told them what private command the King had given him,
supposing this was an infallible argument of his love, because he could neither
endure to live without her, nor in death to be disjoined from her: but the
Ladies were not of his mind, rather abhorring the Tyranny of Herod, who, though
he were dead, yet would he seek their lives.

Presently after a rumor was spread about the City, that Anthony had put Herod
to death, which much troubled all the Court, especially the Ladies: whereupon
Alexandra persuaded Joseph; that, taking them along with him, he should fly to
the Roman Legions that lay before the City under the command of the Tribune
Julius, so that if any trouble arose in the City, they might be secured by the
Romans: adding, that she hoped if Mariamne came but once to the sight of
Anthony, she might obtain any thing of him, yea, even the Kingdom, with
whatsoever belonged to the Royal Famely.

Whilst these things were under debate, there came Letters from Herod, which
dashed all, signifying how Anthony had honored him both in the public
Assemblies, and in inviting him to his Feasts, and that, during the accusations
(...) Cleopatra: so that he feared her not for the time to come, but hoped
shortly to return to them, Anthony having given ^^^s^ria unto Cleopatra instead
of Judea, upon condition that she should not hereafter demand Judea, nor
trouble him any further about that business.

As soon as these Letters were received, the speech about flying to the Romans
vanished, but yet their debate about it was not hid; For as soon as Herod had
brought Anthony part of his way against the Parthians, he returned into Judea,
Herod's, return.
and immediately his Sister S^lome, and his Mother C^p^us told him what
Alexandra's counsel was; neither was she herewith contented, but she accused
her Husband Joseph, as if he had been too familiar with Mariamne: and this she
did out of an old grudge, because the Queen (a woman of an high spirit) in
their womanly brabbles, had upbraided her with her obscure birth.

Mariamne by her Oath assured Herod of her chastity, who told her again how
much he loved her; but she replied, that it was not the part of a lover, to
command that if he died, she should be put to death also. Herod judging that
this secret could never be known, except she had committed adultery with
Joseph, had much ado to refrain from killing her immediately: but love
overcoming his passion, he refrained; yet did he command Joseph to be put to
death Joseph put to death.
without suffering him to plead for himself, Alexandra also he cast into
prison, as the cause of all these evils.

Cleopatra having brought Anthony part of his way toward Parthia, returned
toward Egypt, and by the way, was entertained by Herod, who assured unto her
that part of Arabia which was granted unto her by Anthony, to which he added
the reve^ues of Jericho, where are great store of the best Date Trees and where
Balsom grows, Gardens of Balsom.
which being a precious Ointment only grows there, in two Gardens, both which
are the King, the one of twenty Acres, the other of less.

By this means Herod grew into great familiarity with Cleopatra, who sought to
assure him to her lust, either through her great intemperance, or because she
sought by this means to betray him; but though she pretended love to him, yet
H^^^d refused, and held a consultation with his friends about killing her, who
dissuaded him from it, and therefore having appeased her by great presents, and
all manner of obs^quiousness, he accompanied her as far as Pelusium: yet
searing both her, and the people of the J^w^, he reserved the Castle as a
refuge for himself, laying in as many Arms there as were suffi^ient for ten
thousand men.

Herod paved duly to Cl^^patra the Tributes of Ju^aea and Arabia, which Anthony
had given to her, not thinking it safe to give her any occasion of disgust
against him,

Herod being now free from troubles, and having taken Hyrc^^^^, a Town which
hitherto a Sister of Antigonus had kept, the A^ian War brake forth between
Augustus Caes^r, and M^rk A^th^^, whereupon Hero^ made great preparation for
the assisting of Anth^^^, He^od prepares to assist Anthony.
but he freed him from the trouble, telling him that he needed them not, and so
dismishing him, H^^^d returned home with a well-furnished Army, wherewith he
invaded Arabia, going as far as Diosp^lis, at which place the Ar^bians met him,
and after a fierce confl ct, the J^ws gat the victory.

After this Herod made many inrodes into Arabia in the seventh year of his
reign after the death of Antigorus, at which time the A^ian War being begun, A
great Earrhquake.
Judea was shaken with such an Earthquake as never was the like before, in
which ten thousand men were overwhelmed by the ruins of the houses, yet the
Soldiers received no damage, because they lay in the open fields. This being
much aggravated by report, so emboldned the Arabians, that they laid hold on
the Ambassadors of the Jews, who, in this their affliction came to demand
peace, and slew them, and presently prepared for war with all earnestness.

Herod hearing hereof, encouraged his men, offered Sacrifice according to the
custom, and so in all have, marched with his Army over J^rdan, and having
encamped at Philadelphia, there the fight began about the taking of a Castle
that lay between him, and the Arabians, Herod^ overcoms the Arabians.
in which the Jews got the better, and after continual skirmishes, forced the
Arabians to flight, who in their have treading one upon another, they lost in
all five thousand men: the rest were besieged in their Camp, and extremely
wanting water, they sent Ambassadors to Herod, who would not admit of them,
and was more eager upon them for offering but fifty Talents for their freedom:
They being parched with continual thirst, came out of their Camp by great
companies, offering themselves to the Jews, by which means they took five
thousand of them in five days: and at last the rest in the Camp came out to
fight; but despairing of any good success, there fell of them in the first
conflict about seven thousand more. By this overthrow the courage of the
Arabians was tamed, and Herod was declared Governor of that Nation, and so
returned home with great Glory.

The Actian war being finished, wherein Caesar finally overthrew Anthony,
Alexandra hoped that Herod should be severely punished by Caesar, for assisting
Anthony against him, whereupon she solicited her Father Hyrcanus, not any
longer to suffer the affliction of their Family, Alexandra's restlesness.
but rather to reserve himself for better times: For which end she advised him
to seek for protection and entertainment of M^lchus, the King of Arabia. These
solicitations her Father at first repulsed, but at last being overcome by her
womanish importunity, he sent Letters to Malchus by one Dositheus a friend of
his, desiring him to send some Horsemen to convey him to the Lake Asphaltitis,
which is distant from Jerusalem about three hundred furlongs. This Dosicheus
was kinsman to Joseph, whom Herod had put to death, yet, to curry favor with
the King, he showed him the Letters: Herod thanked him, and withal desired one
courtesy more, that he would seal up the Letters, and give them to Malchus, and
bring his answer to him. This he did, and the Arabia^ sent back word, that he
was ready to entertain Hyrcanus and his Famely, and all the Jews that were of
his party, and that he would send a band of Soldiers to conduct them in
safety, who should be obedient to Her^anus in all things. Herod having received
this answer, called Hyrcanus and asked him if he had any confederacy with
Malchus? who denying it, he produced the Letters in the Council of the
Sanhedrim, and commanded him to be put to death.

Herod goes to Caesar.
Herod having thus dispatched Hyrcanus, resolved to post unto Caesar, and
expecting no good from him, because of his great friendship to Anthony, he was
very jealous of Alexandra, lest, taking this opportunity, she should stir up the
people to rebel, and so fill the Kingdom with domestical seditions. Wherefore
committing the care of his Kingdom to his Brother Ph^roras, he left his Mother
Cyprus, and his Sister Salome, and all his kindred in the strong Castle of
Massada: And commanded his Brother, that if any thing befell him otherwise than
well, he should retain the Government of the Kingdom in his own hands: and
because his Wife Mariamne, by reason of some differences, could not live with
his Mother, he placed her with her Mother Alexandria in Al^xandri^n, committing
^he custody of them to his Treasurer Joseph, and to S^^^us, an Ituria^, under a
color of doing them honor, but yet he gave them this command, that it they
should certainly know that any sinister hap befell him, His cruel command.
they should presently put both the Ladies to death, and to the uttermost of
their power, keep the Kingdom for his Children, an^ his Brother Pheroras.

Herod having thus settled his affairs at home, posted to Rhodes to meet with
Caesar there, whither when he was come, laying only his Crown aside, but
retaining other his Princely Ornaments, he was admitted into Caesar's presence,
where, with great constancy, and magnanimity of spirit, he freely confessed the
love he bore to Anthony, as also the supplies he had sent him of Corn, and
Money: adding moreover that he was ready with the same Faith to keep friendship
with Caesar. This Caesar exhorted him to, Caesar honors him.
and restoring his Crown to him, exceedingly honored him. Thus beyond all
expectation, is Herod again confirmed in his Kingdom, both by the free gift of
Caesar, and also by a Decree of the Senate, which Caesar procured for him: and
Herod gave great Presents both to Caesar himself, and to all his friends about
him, even above his ability, to show the greatness of his mind

During his absence, his Wife Mariamne, His wife and mother are full of
discontents.
and his Mother Al^x^ndra, took it very ill that they were shut up in that
Castle as in a Prison, so that they could neither enjoy their own, nor make use
of other men's goods: especially when by their femenine flatteries they had
fished out of Sohemus, what Herod had commanded concerning them: She then began
to wish that he might never return home, supposing that she should live a most
intolerable life with him: all which she afterward dissembled not, but openly
confessed what it was that did afflict her. For Herod returning beyond all
expectation, and relating to Mariamne what successes he had, she seemed not to
regard them, and at all the carasses that he made her, she would sigh, so that
Herod plainly perceived the hatred of his Wife against him, insomuch that
himself was wavering between love, and hatred toward her.

Not long after Caesar passing through Syria toward Egypt, Herod's bounty to
Caesar, and his Army.
Herod entertained him with all Royal magnificence at P^olemais, and showed
all hospitality toward his Army, giving them plenty of all sorts of victuals,
by which means he was counted one of Caesar's chiefest friends, and used to ride
about with him when he mustred hi Army. He presented him also and his Frinds
with a hundred and fifty Men, all clad in most sumptuous, and rich apparel,
yea, he suff red them to want nothing in their march to Pelusium, through
barren places, and such as wanted water, yet did he provide plentifully for
them, with which the Soldiers were much delighted. He also presented Caesar
with eight hundred Talents: yea, he gave such satisfaction to all, that they
confessed that it was greater than the Kingdom could afford.

Herod is jealous of his wife.
Herod wavering between love and hatred toward his Wife Mariamne, was
continually incensed against her by the false accusations of his Sister Salome,
and his Mother Cypros, who labored to kindle his hatred and jealousy against
her: whereupon, probably he had proceeded rigorously with her, but that news
came seasonably that Anthony and Cleopatra were both dead, He meets Caesar.
and that Caesar had won Egypt, and was coming back, whom in all have he went
to meet, and so left his Famely as it was. At his departure he commended
Sohemus to Mariamne, professing that he owed him much respect for the care he
had had of her: and gave to him also the Government of a part of Judea.

Caesar enlarges his Government.
Herod meeting with Caesar before he was come out of Egypt, in confidence of
his Friendship, spoke freely to him, and was highly honored by him: For he
bestowed upon him the four hundred Galatians, who were formerly of Cleopatra's
Guard, to be his Guard, and restored to him that part of his Country which
Cleopatra had seized upon, and added to his Kingdom Gadara, and Hippon, and
Samaria; and by the Seaside, Gaza, and Anthedon, and Joppa, and the Tower of
Straton, which added much splendor to his Kingdom.

In Caesar's return through Syria, Herod conducted him as far as Antioch. At his
return, for the space of a whole year, suspicions increased daily between him
and his Wife Mariamne, Herod's suspicions of his wife are increased.
she neglecting his carasses, and often upbraiding him either with the death of
her Grandfather Hyrcanus, or her Father Aristobulus, so that Herod could scarce
refrain from striking her, and Salome by the noise, perceiving that Herod was
much moved, she sent in the Butler, whom long before she had suborned for that
end, who told Herod that he was solicited by Mariamne to deliver him a love
potion, which he had by him, but what it was he knew not. Herod hereupon
examined the most faithful servant of Mariamne by torture, being assured that
she would attempt nothing without his privily, who not enduring the torments,
confessed that she was offended for something that ^ohemus had declared unto
her, which when the King heard, he cried out, that Sohemus, who had ever been
most faithful both to him, and the Kingdom, would never have spoken of these
things, had there not been some more secret familiarity between them than was
fitting; and thereupon he commanded Sohemus to be apprehended and put to death;
and having called his Friends to Counsel, he accused his Wife for practicing to
poison him, which he so aggravated, that all that were present perceived that
he had a mind that she should be condemned, Mariamne condemned to death.
which was accordingly done by the general consent of them all: and whereas
they thought that the ex cution should not be over speedy, but rather that she
should be secured i^ some of the King^ Castles, Salome excee ingly urged the
King that she should presently be put to death, for ^ear lest there should be
some commotion among the people she being alive and in Prison: and thus was
Mari^mne brought to h r death.

When her Mother Al^xandra saw her going to execution, and considered that she
must look for the same at Herod's han^s, that she might not seem to be guilty of
the some crime, she began to up^raid her daughter as being wicked, and
ungrateful toward her Husband, saying, Her mother^ Hypocr sie.
b^t she deserved death who ^urst ^tt^mo^ so hamous an act. Whilst she
counterfeited these things, and made as i^ she wou^^ have pulled her Daughter
by the hair, they that were present condemned her hypocrisy; Mariamnes Death.
but she that was led to death returned her no answ^r, but refelle^ the fals^
accusation, with a resolute countenance, and mind, and underwent her death
without fear.

She being dead, Herod began to be more inflamed with love toward her, Herod's
excessive grief for her.
often calling upon her Name and lamenting her death beyond decency; and
although he sought to div^rt his grief by pleasures, feastings and drinking,
yet all availed nothing. Whereupon he cast off the care of his Kingdom, and so
far gave up himself to sorrow, that he would bid his servants call Mariamne, as
though she were y^^ living.

A great (...)
As Herod was thus tormenting himself, there came a great Plague, which swept
away a great part both of the Nobility, and Commons, every one judging that
this Plague was sent by God for the unjust death of the Queen. The Kings
discontents being increased hereby, he at last hid himself in a solitary
Wilderness under a pretense of hunting; where still afflicting himself, he fell
into a great sickness, Herod's Melancholy and sickness.
which was accompanied with an inflammation and great pain in his neck, so that
he began to rave; neither could any applications ease him, but rather made the
disease more painful, so that those about him began to despair of his life:
and his Physicians, partly because of the stubborness of the disease, and
partly because in so great danger there was not any free election of diet, they
gave him leave to eat whatsoever he would.

Alexandras treason and Death.
Herod lying thus sick in Samaria, and Alexandra being at Jerusalem, she
endeavored to get the two Castles of the City into her hands, the one
adjoining to the Temple, the other situate in the City: For which end she
solicited the Governors of them to deliver them up unto her, and to the
Children of her and Mariamne, lest that Herod being dead, they should be seized
upon by others: But they who had ever been faithful to Herod, were now much
more diligent in their Office, both out of an hatred of Alexandra, and because
they thought it a great offense to despair of the recovery of their Prince.
Hereupon they presently sent messengers to Herod, to acquaint him with
Alexandra's attempt, who thereupon commanded her to be slain. At length
overcoming his disease, he recovered his strength both of body and mind, but
grew so cruel, Herod grows cruel. Salome leaves her husband and comes to Herod.
that upon the least occasion he was ready to put any one to Death.

Salome, Herod's Sister, having been married to Cossaborus an Idumean, a
difference now arising betwixt them, she, contrary to the custom of the Jews,
sent him a Bill of Divorce, and came away to her Brother Herod, telling him
that she preferred his love before her tie to her Husband: the reason which she
pretended was, that Cossaborus had practiced some innovations with Lysimachus,
Antipater, and Dositheus, confirming it from this, because he had privily kept
in his Country the Children of Bebas, now for the space of twelve years from
Herod's taking of Jerusalem: Herod's cruelty.
As soon as Herod heard this, he sent some to their hiding places, and killed
them, with many others, to the intent that none should remain of the kindred of
Hyrcanus: He also took out of the way all such as excelled in any dignity, that
he might do whatsoever seemed him good, there being none to resist him.

Herod by these practices growing more secure, He instituted Games to the
discontent of the Jews.
he began to degenerate more and more from his Country fashions, violating them
by foreign inventions. For first he instituted wrestlings every fifth year in
the honor of Caesar, for the exhibiting of which, he began to build a Theater
in Jerusalem, and an Amphitheatre in the plain, both of them very sumptuous
for the workmanship, but clean contrary to the Jewish customs: Yea he would
have thi^ solemnity to be enrolled, and to be proclaimed in the neighboring
Countries, and to remoter Nations, and by propounding great rewards, he
invited, not only those that were skillful wrestlers, but also excellent
Musicians, and such as played on several instrum^nts Yet that which above all
troubled the Jews, were the Trophies, which being covered with Armor, they
thought to be Images, forbidden by their Law; but Herod to satisfy them
commanded the Armor to be taken off, and showed them that they were mere
stocks of wood, whereupon all their anger was turned into laughter.

Herod having many ways provoked the Jews, ten Citizens of Jerusalem made a
Conspiracy against him, A conspiracy against Herod.
amongst whom one was blind, who made one not because he could do any thing,
but to show how ready he was to suffer with those that defended their Country
rights: Herod had appointed secret spies to discover such plots, one of which
had fished this matter out, and acquainted Herod with it, who caused them to be
apprehended, The conspirators are put to Death.
and when they were brought before him, with undaunted countenances they drew
out their weapons from under their garments, protesting, that, not out of any
private respect, but in the behalf of the public wea^, they had undertaken
this conspiracy. Then were they led way, and put to death with all manner of
tortures. Not long after, their accuser being hated of all men was slai^ by
some, and being cut in pieces, was thrown to the Dogs. Yet were the authors
hereof concealed, till after long, and wearisome inquisitions, it was by
torture wrung out from some silly women who were privy to it When Herod had
thus found out the authors, Herod's. cruelty. He fortified Samaria, and built a
Temple there.
he punished them with death, and their whole Famelies.

Herod the better to secure himself from the seditions of the tumultuous
people, in the thirt^^^nth year of his reign, began to fortify Samaria, which
was a day^ journey from Jerusalem, and called it Sebaste (or Augu^^a,) The
circuit of it was twenty furlongs, in the midst whereof he built a Temple of
a furlong and an half, which he wonderfully adorned, and so ordered, that many
of the Soldiers, and of the neighboring Nations came and dwelt there.

He built s^verall Castles.
Herod also built another Cidadel to be as a bridle to the whole Nation, namely
the Tower of Straton: Also in the great plain he built a Castle and chose of
his Horsemen by lot, to keep it. Another he built in Galile, and one in Peraea:
which Castles being so conveniently disposed in several parts of the Country,
took away from the people all opportunity of rebellion.

Plague, and Famine.
About this time very grievous calamities befell the Nation of the Jews. First
there was a long drought, after which followed a Famine: After the Famine, by
reason of their ill diet, there came diverse sicknesses, and the Plague; and
Herod, having not wherewithal to supply the public wants, was forced to melt
the gold and silver that was in his Palace, Herod's care to provide for the
people.
not sparing any thing for the curiosity of the workmanship: no not so much as
the vessels which were for his own daily use. These being turned into money, he
sent to buy provisions into Egypt, where Petronius was Governor under Caesar,
who though he was pestered with multitudes that repaired to him upon the like
necessity, yet being Herod's friend, he gave his servants leave to export Corn,
and was assisting to them, both in the buying, and carriage of it.

When the Corn was brought to Herod, he was very careful to see it divided,
first to such as had most need, and then because there were many who by reason
of old age, or some other weakness, were unable to dress it themselves, he
appointed them certain Bakers to provide their food for them: By this means he
procured the good will of the people, and the praise of a prudent and provident
Prince.

He provided also for his subjects against the sharpness of the winter, taking
care that none should want clothing, their Cattle being dead, and wool, and
other materials failing. And when he had made provision for his own People, His
bounty to strangers.
he took care also for the neighboring Cities of the Syrians, to whom he
allowed feed for sowing of their ground: and the Castles, and Cities; and those
of the Common people, who had great Famelies, coming to him for succor, he
found a remedy for them also: Insomuch that he gave to those that were not his
Subjects ten thousand Cores of Corn, each Core containing ten Athenian bushels.

As soon as the Corn was ripe for harvest, Herod dismissed fifty thousand Men,
whom he had fed in the time of Famine into their own Countries: by which
diligence he restored the almost ruined estate of his own Subjects, and did
not a little relieve his neighbors, who groaned under the same calamities.

At the same time also he sent aid to Caesar, to wit, He sends aid to Caesar.
five hundred chosen M^n of his own Guard whom Aelius Gallus led into the
Ar^bian Wars, where they did most excellent serv^ce.

H^^od also built himself a Palace in Sidon, He built himself a Palace.
in which he built two very large and stately Houses, with which the Temple it
self could in no wise compare, and called one of them by the name of Caesar,
and the other by the name of Agrippa.

He makes a new High Priest: and marries Mariamne. He built another Palace
Herod having removed from the Priesthood Jesus the Son of Phales, made Simon
(a Priest of Jerusalem, the Son of Boethus of Alexandria) Priest in his room,
and took also his Daughter M^rimne to Wife, that was the most beautiful Virgin
of that age.

The marriage solemnities being over, he began to build another new Palace,
unto which he adjoined a Town, which he called Herodion, in a place distant
from Jerusalem, about sixty furlongs toward Arabia, in the place where he had
overcome the Jew, when he was thrust out by the Arms of Antigonus

And Sebast^ and a stately Haven.
He buil^ ^lso Se^^^e, and having finished that, he beg^n to build another most
magnificent City in a place by the Seaside, where Str^^^n stood, which he
called (...), and added to it an Haven of admirable work, equal in bigness to
the H^ven ^^raetus (...) which he (...) in twelve years space, sparing neither
ab^^r nor cost about them.

He sent his sons to Caesar.
Then did he send hi^ two Son^, A^xander, and Ari^obulus (whom he ha^ by
M^^i^mn^ the Asm^nae^n) to (...) to Caesar, to be there educ^^ed under (...),
for whom Lo^gi^gs were prepared at the H^u^e of P^^^^, Herod's great (...).
Caesar entertained the young men very cour^eously, and gave H^r^d power to make
which of his sons h^ p^e^sed the heir of his Kingdom: Caesar enlarged his
Kingdom.
he added also to his Government Trach^niti^, ^^tu^s, and ^^^nitis.

When Herod had received Trach^ni^s, he took guides, and went to the Den o^ the
Thieve^, He repressed the thieves.
restraining their villainies, whereby the people live^ in quiet: But Zenodorus,
the former Governor, being move^, p^rtly thorough envy, and partly with the
loss of his Government, went to R me to accuse H^r^^, but could effect nothing.

About this time Herod went to M^ ch^n^, to salute his chiefest friend Agrippa,
and so returned into Judaea: and presently after some Citizens of G^^^ra went
to Agrippa to accuse Herod, He went to Agrippa.
whom he vouchsafed not so much as to hear, but sent them bound to Herod: Yet
did he spare them: for though he was inexorable toward his own people, yet did
he willingly contemn, and forgive injuries received from strangers.

Zenodorus had solemnly sworn to the Gadareus, that he would do his utmost with
Caesar to get them freed from the jurisdiction of Herod, and to be annexed to
the Province of Caesar: Many of themselves also exclaimed against Herod, Herod
accused to ^ Caesar.
calling him cruel Tyrant, complaining to Caesar of his violence and rapines,
and for rasing, and robbing their Temple: Yet was Herod nothing herewith
terrified, being ready to answer for himself: But Caesar used him courteously,
and was nothing alienated from him for all these tumultuous complaints: The
Gadareus therefore perceiving the inclination of Caesar and his Friends toward
Herod, despairing of good success, and fearing to be delivered into Herod's
hands, some of them cut their own throats, others fearing torments brake their
own necks, or drowned themselves in the River, and thus, seeming to forejudg
themselves, Caesar absolved Herod from all their accusations.

Zenodorus also having his bowels burst, through much blood that came from him,
ended his life at Antioch in Syria; whereupon Augustus Caesar gave his
Tetrarchy to Herod: he made him also one of the Governors of Syria, Caesar
still enlarged his Dominions.
commanding the rest of the Governors of that Province, to do nothing without
his advice.

Hero^ bestowed upon his Brother Pheroras a hundred Talent^ out of the revenues
of his Kingdom, and begged a Tetrarchy for him of Caesa^, to the intent that if
himself should hap^en to die, Pheroras estate might be secure, and not subject
to Her^^s children.

Caes^^ coming into the East, having settled his affairs there He^^^ conducted
him to the Seaside, and so returned into his own Kingdom, where he built a
goodly Temple in honor of Caesar, all of white Marble, near to P^nion, Her^d
built a Temple: and eased his Subjects.
at the foot of which mountain were the spring-heads of Jordan. He also
remitted to his subjects some part of their Tribute, under pretense that he
would ease them after the great dearth, but indeed to appease the minds of his
subjects, who were offended at his vast works, which seemed to tend to the
destruction of Religion and good manners, as was commonly talked. As also to
prevent these reports, he forbad all private meetings in the City, and to
frequent Feastings: His jealousies.
He had spies also who would mingle themselves in all companies, and mark what
people said: yea himself would go about in the night in the habit of a private
person, and mingle himself in the company of people to hear what they thought
of him: and such as peremptorily disliked his doings, he would punish without
all mercy: the rest of the multitude he bound to him by Oath, requiring that
they should not depart from their fidelity, and duty: Yea he required this Oath
of many of the Pharisees, as of Pollio, and Sameas, etc. which though he could
not get them to take, yet did he not punish them as he did others, in regard of
that respect that he bore to Pollio: Neither did he impose it upon the Esseans,
whom he much esteemed for one Manaherus sake, who was a Prophet, and when Herod
was but a boy, he saluted him King of the Jews, and foretold that he should
Reign above thirty years.

Herod in the eighteenth year of his Reign, propounded to the Jews his building
the Temple at Jerusalem, He rebuilt the Temple at Jerusalem.
whom when he saw troubled least, when he had pulled down the old, he should
not be able to finish a new one, he told them, that the old Temple should
remain whole as it was, till all the materials necessary for the new Fabric,
should be fully prepared: neither did he deceive them for he provided a
thousand wagons to carry stones, and he chose out of all the Artificers ten
thousand that were the most exquisite workmen, and a thousand Priests, clothed
in their Priestly garments at his cost, who were not altogether ignorant of the
Masons, and Carpenters Art, to oversee them.

All necessary materials for this stately work being provided in the space of
two years, Herod began to build the Temple at Jerusalem, forty six years before
the first Passover of the Ministry of Christ and therefore that text Joh.
11.20. should be thus translated, This Temple has been built forty six years
hitherto: So the learned Primate of Ireland, and our Countryman Lydiat, read
it,

Indeed the building of the Temple under Zorobabel began in the first year of
the Monarchy of Cyrus, and after some interruptions, was finished in twenty
years space, viz. in the sixth year of Dari^^ Hystaspes: but the magnificent
building of it, begun by Herod at this time was finished in nine years space
and an half: Nine years it was in building.
and truly the riches of Herod alone, were not sufficient to perfect so
magnificent a structure, but all the holy treasures of many ages, that were
sent to them from all the parts of the world to Jerusalem, were spent about it.

Not long after Herod set sail for Italy, to salute Caesar, and to see his
Children at Rome, and as he passed through Greece, He goes into Jtaly.
he was, not only present at, but Judge of the Olympic exercises, where,
observing that they did not answer the resort that was to them, through the
poverty of the Elienses, he bestowed toward them an yearly revenew, that so
their Sacrifices might be made the more splendid, as also other things that
tended to the gracing of so great a meeting: For which bounty he was declared
perpetual Judge of those exercises. His bounty.


When he came to Rome, Caesar entertained him courteously, and delivered to him
his Sons sufficiently instructed in the Liberal Sciences, and so from thence he
went into Galatia.

At Jerusalem, by the diligence of the Priests, the building of the Temple
properly so called, that contained the Holy, and the Holy of Holies, was
finished in a year and an half; during which time, it is reported that it never
rained in the day time, but only in the nights: and in the eight years
following, the Porches, the Ranges, and the rest of the buildings about the
Temple were all finished.

When Alexander, and Aristobulus were returned into Judea, and had gained all
men's love, Salome the Sister of Herod, and her Faction, fearing that at some
time or other they would reveng their Mothers death, cast out a rumor amongst
the people, that they hated their Father, because he had caused their Mother to
be slain: But Herod as yet sus^^cting no ill, used them with all Honor, as
they deserved: and because they were now grown to men's estate, he provided them
Wives: Herod's Sons married.
for Alexander, Bernice, the Daughter of Salome, and for Aristobulus, Glaphira,
the Daughter of Archelaus, the King of the Cappadocians.

Then Herod hearing that Agrippa was again come into Asia, he went to him, and
begged of him that he would come into his Kingdom as to his Friend, and Guest;
and as he came, Herod entertains Agrippa.
he entertained him in all the Cities that he had newly built, showing him the
public buildings, and presenting, both to himself and friends all kind of
delights which might set forth his magnificence, at Sebaste, and the Port of
Caesarca, and in the Castles of Alexandrion, Herodion, and Hyrcania. He brought
him also into the City of Jerusalem, where all the People met him in their
best, and Festival attire, and with acclamations of joy: Agrippa also
sacrificed an Hecatombe to God, and feasted the People; and though he would
willingly have stayed longer there, yet, fearing storms, the Winter now drawing
on, he hasted to sail into Jonia, both he and his Friends having been honored
with great presents by Herod.

As soon as the Spring came, Herod hearing that Agrippa was going with an Army
to Bosphorus, made have to meet him, and taking his way by Rhodes, and Chios,
he came to Lesbos, thinking there to find him: But Agrippa being driven back by
contrary North-winds Herod stayed at Chios, to whom many came privately to
salute him, upon whom he bestowed many princely gifts, Herod's great bounty.
and when he perceived that the Gate of the City that was thrown down in the
War against Methridates, as yet lay buried in its ruins, and that by reason of
the poverty of the Inhabitants, it could not by them be restored to its former
beauty and greatness, he bestowed upon them so much money as would abundantly
suffice to finish it, and exhorted them to hasten the restoring of their City
to its former beauty, and grandeur.

As soon, as the wind served, he left Chios, and sailed to Mytilene, and from
thence to Byzantium, and there understanding that Agrippa had already passed
the Cyanian Rock, he followed him with all speed, and overtook him at Sinopi, a
City in Pontus, where, beyond Agrippa's expectation, he arrived with his Navy:
His coming was very grateful to him, and they embraced each other with
singular affection, His love to Agrippa
Agrippa looking upon it as an evident argument of his fidelity and friendship,
that leaving his manifold occasions, he would come to him in so seasonable a
time. Wherefore Herod still abode with him in the Army, was companion with him
in his labors, and partaker of his counsels: He was also present with him when
he went to be merry, and was the only man that he used in difficult matters,
for the love that he bore unto him.

Agrippa having forced the B^sphorans to lay down their Arms, in his whole
journey thorough many countries and Cities, he gratified Herod in many things,
Agrippaes love to him.
and at his entreaty, relieved the necessities of many: If any one needed an
intercessor to Agrippa, Herod was the only man, by whom he could obtain his
suit and assisted many in whatsoever they had need of.

When they were come into Jonia, a great multitude of Jews that inhabited that
Country, complained of the great injuries that they suffered from the Jonians,
who would not permit them to live after their own Laws, but that upon their
Festival days, they haled them before their Tribunals, and forbad them to send
holy money to Jerusalem, which also they perverted to secular affairs, contrary
to the privileges granted them by the Romans: Herod's savor to the Jews in
Jonia.
Herod took care that Agrippa should hear their complaints, and allowed them
Nicholas Damasc^ne, one of his friends, to plead their cause, which when he had
largely performed before Agrippa (many honorable Romans, and some Kings and
Princes being present) the Grecians denied the thing, excusing themselves that
the Jews were troublesome to them: But they on the contrary proved that they
were freeborn Citizens, and that they lived according to their own Laws without
injuring of any; wherefore Agrippa answered, that both for his friend Herod's
sake, as also because that which they demanded was just, he would gratify them
therein: He ordered therefore that the privileges which were formerly granted
them, should remain inviolable, and that none should molest them for living
after their Country Laws. Then Herod rose up, and gave him thanks in the name
of them all: and so after mutual embraces, they took their leave each of
other, and departed from Lesbos.

Herod in a few days after, having a prosperous gale, arrived at Caesarea, and
from thence went to Jerusalem, where, calling all the people together, Herod
ingratiates him elf with the Jews.
he gave them an account of his journey, and told them what immunities he had
procured for the Jews in Asia; and to win them the more to his friendship, he
professed that he would remit to them the fourth part of his Tribute; with
which bounty they being exceedingly taken, wished him all happiness, and
departed with great joy.

He is incensed against his Sons.
Presently after his return, he was greatly incensed by the false accusations
and artifices of his Sister Salome, and his Brother Pheroras, against his two
Sons that he had by Mariamne, Alexander, and Aristobulus: whereupon to take
down their spirits, he began to use them more hardly, and publicly he put
hopes of the Kingdom into his Son Antipater, whom he begat when he was a
private man, his Mother also being a woman of mean parentage, whom formerly he
had banished the City in favor to his two other Sons, and writing often unto
Caesar for him privately, he gave him great commendations: and at the
entreaties of Antipater, he recalled also his Mother Doris, whom he had put
away when he married Mariamne.

He visits Agrippa.
Agrippa afer his ten years Government in Asia, being now to depart, Herod
sailed to salute him, taking with him of all his Sons only Antipater, whom he
delivered to Agrippa with many gifts, to be carried to Rome, and to be brought
into Caesar's favor.

Antipaters subtilty.
Antipater was much honored at Rome, being commended to all his Friends by his
Fathers letters: and though he was absent, yet desisted he not by writing to
incense his Father against the Sons of Mariamne, pretending his great care of
his Fathers safety, but in truth, to make way for his succession in the
Kingdom. About this time Agrippa died, and being brought into the market place
of Rome, Augustus commended him in a Funeral Oration.

Herod being now incensed against his Sons, Her^d accuses his Sons.
Alexander and Aristobulus, he sailed with them to Rome to accuse them before
Augustus, and not finding him there, he followed him as far as Aquileia, before
whom he accused them of treachery against him; but the young men satisfied all
that were present by their Apology for themselves mixed with prayers and tears,
so that they were reconciled to their Father. After which, giveing thanks unto
Caesar, they departed together, and with them Antipater also, who pretended
much joy that they were received into favor again.

A few days after Herod gave Caesar three hundred Talents, Caesar's favors to
Herod.
and again Caesar gave him half the revenues of the metal Mines in Cyprus,
and the other half also he committed to his oversight, and having honored him
with other gifts of Hospitality, he gave him leave to choose which of his Sons
he pleased to be his successor, or if he liked it better to divide his Kingdom
amongst them, which when he was about to do, Caesar told him that he would not
suffer but that he should have his Kingdom during his life in his own power, as
well as his Sons.

In Herod's absence there was a rumor spread in Judea that he was dead,
whereupon the Trachonites revolting, fell to their old trade of thieving; but
by the diligence of his Captains that he had left in his Kingdom, Thieves
subdued.
they were subdued, and forty of the Chief of them, being terrified by the
punishment of those that were taken, left their country and fled into Arabia
Nabathaea, where they were entertained by Silaeus (who was an enemy to Herod,
because he had denied him his sister Salome to wife) who gave them a place to
dwell in that was well fortified.

Herod and his Sons sailing homeward, Herod returns with his Sons.
arrived at Sebaste in Cilicia, where they met with Archelaus King of
Cappadocia, who courteously entertained Herod, much rejoicing that his Sons
were reconciled to him, and that Alexander had fairly ans^^red the crimes that
were objected against him: and so gi^ing royal gifts each to other, they
parted.

Herod being returned into Judea, called the people together, and told them
what he had done in his voyage, and declared to them that his sons should reign
after him, first Antipater, and then Alexander and Aristobulus, that he had by
Mariamne.

About this time, in the year of the world 3994, Agrippa the first King of the
Jews of that name, Agrippa born.
was born, who dyed when he was fifty four years old, being struck by an Angel,
Act. 12.23. Also that lame man was now born, who being above forty years old,
was healed by Peter, at the Beautiful gate of the Temple, Act. 4.22.

Herod having finished Caesarea Stratonis in the twenty eighth year of his
Reign, he dedicated it with great solemnity, and many sports and pastimes:
After which he began to build another Town in a field called Capharsala, Herod's
great buildings.
which he called Antipatris, after his Fathers name; and a Castle also, which
he called Cyprus after his Mothers name. In honor also of his dead brother, he
built in Jerusalem a very fair Tower, not inferior to the Egyptian Pharos,
and called it Phasalus: and afterward he built a Town of the same name in the
valley of Jericho, from whence the country there about^ is called Phaselus,

Herod having wasted his wealth by his great prodigality, and now wanting money,
after the example of John Hyrcanus, in the night, He robs David's Sepulcher
without the knowledge of the people, he opened David's sepulcher, where, though
he found no money, yet he found great store of precious things, and ornaments of
gold, which he took away: for the expiation of which fact, he afterward built
a most sumptuous Monument of white Marble at the entrance of the Sepulcher.

Antipaters subtilty.
Antipater, suborning other men falsely to accuse his Brethren, Alexander and
Aristobulus, takes upon him their defense, that making a show of good will to
them, he might the easier oppress them: and by these subtilties he so wrought
upon his Father, that thought him to be his only preserver. Hereupon Herod
commended his Steward Ptolomy unto Antipater, and communicated all his Counsels
with his Mother Doris, so that all things were done as they pleased, and still
the King was imbittered against those, whom it was their profit that he should
be angry with.

About this time Pheroras (Herod's Brother) fell so madly in love with his own
servant, that he refused marriage with Cypros, the Kings Daughter, that was
offered him by his Brother: He also accused Herod to his Son Alexander, as if
he had been greatly in love with his Wife Glaphyra: for both which Herod was
highly displeased with him.

In the year of the world 3996, he began to be diseased, who, lying at the Pool
of Bethesda, was after 38 years, restored to health by Christ, Joh. 5.5.

Alexander, by the subtilties of his adversaries, Alexander reconciled to his
Father.
being even driven to desparation, was at this time reconciled to his Father by
Archelaus, King of the Cappadocians, who came to Jerusalem to visit Herod, and
being accounted one of Herod's chief Friends, received great gifts from him, and
when he departed, Herod brought him as far as Antioch.

Not long after Herod went a third time to Rome to visit Caesar, in whose
absence those Thieves of Trachonis, Herod goes again to Rome.

but all Caelosyria; Syllaeus affording them both impunity, and ^^curity.

He^^^ being returned from R^me, He returns and dedicates the Temple.
celebrated the Dedication of the T^^^le, reedified by him in the space of nine
years and ^h^ on the very b^rth day of his Kingdom, which he wa^ ^ont to
celebrate with great joy, at which time he Sacr^^ced unto God three hundred
Oxen, and other of the people off^red an innumerable company of Sacrifices,
every one according to his ability.

Herod finding that in his absence his People had sustained much damage by
those Thieves of Trachonis, Thieves do much mischief.
and seeing he could not subdue them, being under the protection of the
Arabian, he therefore entered Trachonis, and destroyed their Famelies, which yet
did but incense them the more; so that, contemning all dangers, they molested
Herod's Countries with continual excursions, driving, and carrying away the
peoples goods.

Herod, hereupon sent to the Presidents of Syria, Saturninus, and Voluminous,
desiring that he might have the punishing of the Thieves of Trachonis, who by
their incursions had often wasted his Country. They, when they heard hereof,
being increased to the number of a thousand, began to waste both fields, and
villages, cutting the throats of all that fell into their hands; wherefore
Her^d demanded those Thieves to be delivered over to him, and withal, required
the sixty Talents that he had lent Ob^das upon Syllaeus his security, who had
thrust Obodas from the Government and now ruled all himself: But Syllaeus
denied that the Thieves were in Arabia, and deferred also to pay the money;
whereupon the business was debated before Saturninus, and Voluminous, and in
conclusion it was determined by them; that within thirty days space, both the
money should be repaid, and the runawayes of both Countries should be delivered
up, and Syllaeus swore by the Fortune of Caesar before the Presidents of Syria,
that he would perform what was enjoined.

But when the time was expired, Syllaeus being unwilling to stand to the
agreement, went to Rome: and in the mean time Herod, by the permission of
Saturninus, and Voluminous, to punish those obstinate people, raised an Army,
entered Arabia, and marched as far in three days as they used to do in seven;
and when he came to the Castle where the Thieves kept, Herod destroies the
Thieves.
he took it at the first assault, and demolished a Fortress also called
Raeeptu: and when a Captain of the Arabians came to their aid, they joined
battle, in which few of the Herodians were slain, but there dyed twenty five
of the Arabians together with their Captain, whereupon the rest fled. Being
thus revenged of the Thieves, he brought three thousand Idumaeans into
Trachona, to restrain the theiveries committed there, and certified the Roman
Generals, that he had only used that power which they had granted against those
obstinate Arabians, which upon enquiry, they found to be true.

There were Letters posted away to Rome to Syllaeus, Caesar incensed against
him.
that related matters far otherwise, aggravating every thing after their
manner, by which Lies Caesar was so much incensed against Herod, that he wrote
threatening Letters to him, because he had marched with an Army out of his own
Kingdom without his leave: and he was so far provoked, that he would not hear
his Ambassadors, but dismissed them without an answer.

The Trachanites, and Arabians taking hold of this occasion, molested the
Garrison of the Idumaeans that Herod had set over them; but Herod being
affrighted with Caesar's anger, was fain to connive at it.

About this time Obodas, King of Arabia Nabathaea dyed, and one Aeneas
succeeded him, who changed his name into Aretas; which Syllaeus hearing of at
Rome, endeavored by false accusations to have him thrust from the Kingdom, and
to get it to himself, bestowing much money upon the Courtiers, and promising
great things unto Caesar, whom he knew to be offended with Aretas, for assuming
the Kingdom without his consent. In the mean while Aretas sent Letters, and
rich presents unto Caesar, and amongst them a Crown worth many Talents: But
Caesar would not hear his Ambassadors, and scorned his Presents, and dismissed
them without any thing done.

Herod being continually vexed with the insolences of the Arabians, sent
Nicholas Damascene to Rome, to see, Herod falls out with his Sons, and imprisons
them.
if by the mediation of his Friends, he could get Justice from Caesar: But in
the mean time the discord with his Sons that he had by Mariamne, was greatly
heightened by the artifices of Euri^hus a Laced^^ nian, which occasioned Herod,
to find out their s^pp^s^d treachery, to put to death by various torments, many
both of his own, and of his Sons Friends, yet could he find no other evil by
them, but some too free complaints of improvident young men, concerning their
Fathers immoderate cruelty, and his too easy harkening to base pick-thanks, of
the wicked deceits of their Brother Antipater, and of the faction that was
combined against them, and that, to free themselves from these mischiefs, they
were said to think of flying to Archelaus King of Cappadocia, which thing
indeed they did not deny: Hereupon Herod cast them into prison, as i^ they had
been convicted of treason against their F^ he^, resolving to punish them
according a^ his ff ^rs went at Rome and concerning this busin^ss h^ sent
L^tters to Caes r by Voluminous, the Roman General, and Olympius, his Friend.

At Rome Nicholas Dam^scene joined himself to the Arabians that cam^ to accuse
Syllaeus, professing that he was his accus^r also before Augu^us, and not
Herod's defender, and this he did, lest he should be repuls^d as others had been
before him. When by this means he had gotten access into Caesar's presence, he
indeed laid open many of Syllaeus his crimes, and withal added, that Caesar
was circumvented with his lies in the cause of Herod, which he confirmed by
certain authentic records: This so prevailed with Caesar that he condemned
Syllaeus, and remanded him into the Province, that when he had satisfied the
debt, he might be punished.

Caesar is reconciled to Herod.
From this time Augustus was reconciled to Aretas, and and Herod, and then
received the Presents that before he had so often rejected, and confirmed the
Kingdom of the Arabians to Ar^tas. He advised Herod also by his letters, to
call a Council of his Friends at Berytus, and joining the Presidents of Syria,
with Archelaus, the King of Cappadocia, by their joint advice to determine of
the business about his Sons.

About this time the Angel Gabriel (who long before had foretold to Daniel the
coming of the Messiah by a certain number of weeks) appeared at the right side
of the Altar of incense to Zachary An Angel appears to Zachary.
the Priest, of the course of Abia, telling him, that there should be born to
him now in his old age, his wife El^zabeth also being well stricken in years
and barren, a Son called John, a Nazarite, and the forerunner of the Lord, in
the spirit, and power of Elias: which he not believing was made dumb, Luke 15,
22.

Herod having received Augustus his letters, rejoiced exceedingly, both because
he was returned into his favor and for that he had granted him power to do
what he would with his Sons, and hereupon he convened by messengers all those
that Caesar had appointed, to Berythus, except only Archelaus, and kept his
sons not far from the place, in a City of the Sidonians: and the Case being
opened, Saturninus, one that had been Consul, delivered his opinion, but
moderated with circumstances, that Herod's Sons were to be condemned, Herod
procures his Sons to be condemned.
but not to be put to death: After him, his three Sons that were his
Lieutenants, delivered their opinions to the same purpose: But Velumnius
pronounced that they were to be punished with death, whose opinion the ma^^r
part followed: and so the Council being ended, Herod took his Sons with him,
and meeting with Nicholas Damascene at Tyrus, they went together to Caesarea.

Here, when as a certain old Soldier named Tyro, had smartly reprehended Herod
Herod's cruelty.
for his wickedness determined against his Sons, and told him that three
hundred more of his Captains were of the same opinion, Hero^ commanded him to
be cast into prison: Trypho the Kings Barber, taking this occasion, accused
Tiro for that he had often solicited him to cut the Kings throat with his
razor, as he was triming him, and immediately both Tiro, and his Son, and the
Barber were tortured: and Herod bringing those three hundred Captains, and Tiro
and his Son, and the Barber, accused them before the People, against whom the
people throwing any thing that came next to hand, slew them every one.

Then were Alexander, and Aristobulus led to Sebaste, Herod's* Sons strangled.
and there strangled by their Fathers command, and their bodies were buried in
the Castle of Alex^ndrian, where Alexander, their Grandfather by the mothers
si^e, and many of their Prog^nitors, had been buried.

Antip^ter, Antipaters. Treason.
when his Brethren were now dead, intended to remove his Father also out of the
way: and knowing that he was hated by many in the Kingdom, he endeavored by
Bribes to get the good will of his Fathers Friends, both at Rome and in Judea;
but especially of Saturninus, the President of Syria, and of P^eroras, and
Salome, the Brother and Sister o^ Herod.

At ^^is time Herod sent home Glaphira, the widow of his so^ A^exander, to her
F^ther Ar^helaus the King of C^op (...) and g^^ her a D^wry out of his
Treasury, lest some ^^^roversie should a (...) concerning it, and withal, he
took (...) care ^f ^^e young children of Alexander, and Ari^to^^^ wh^^h
A^tipa^er took very heavily, fearing lest when ^^ey should come to age, they
would hinder his design^ ^^ough^ in ^ef^re their destruction: and he so overcam
^erod b^ his flatteries that he s^ffered him to marry the d^ughte^ (...)
Aristobulus, and his son to marry the daug^ter of (...) U^cle Pheroras.

About th^^ ^he Herod invited Zamaris, a Babilonian Jew, and gave him a Country
in Tra^honis to inhabit, and this he did, that he might be a guard to that
Country against Thieves: and Zamaris coming with five hundred Horse, and an
hundred of his kinsmen, erected Castles in diverse places of that Country, by
which means he secured the Jews that came from Babylon to the Feasts at
Jerusalem from the Thieves.

Antipater working treason against his Father, drew in his Uncle Pheroras, and
some of the Kings women, that were most addicted to the Sect of the Pharisees,
Of the Pharisees.
except Salome, who constantly adhered to her Brother Herod. These Pharisees
were a crafty people, arrogant, and enemies to Kings, and they only of the
whole nation of the Jews, refused to swear allegiance to Herod and Caesar, and
were about six thousand. For which cause Herod fined them, and the wife of
Pheroras paid their fine for them, to whom, by way of requital, they foretold
that the Kingdom should be taken from Herod, and his children, and be
transferred upon her Husband, and her, and their children: these things Salome
made known to Herod, Herod slew some of them.
who examining the business, put some of the Pharisees to death, and with them,
the Eunuch Dagoas, and his darling Carus, who was commended to him for his
handsomeness; and besides these, all the rest of his Family whom he found to
have conspired with the Pha^^s^^^*

Herod having punished the Pharisees, called a Council of his Friends, and
before them began an accusation against the wife of his brother Pherora^, and
when Pheroras, tho to grafie his Brother, would not fors^ke her, he forbad
Antipater Pheroras his company: and Antipater, that he might remove all
suspicion from himself, procured by his friends that his Father should send him
immediately to Augustus: and accordingly Herod Herod sends his Son to Caesar.
sent him with great presents, and his Will, in which he declared that
Antipater should succeed him in the Kingdom: but if he died before him, then
his Son that he had by Mariamus, the daughter of Simon the High Priest.

In the sixth month after John was conceived, The Angel appears to Mary.
the Angel Gabriel was sent to Nazareth in Galilee, to the blessed Virgin Mary,
betrothed to J^seph, of the same Tribe with her: viz. of the stock of David,
and declared to her that she should bring forth the Son of God, and call his
name Jesus, and she being more fully taught of his admirable conception by the
power of the Holy Ghost overshadowing her, with great Faith, said, Be it to the
handmaid of the Lord according to thy word, Luke 1.26, 38. and presently after
she went into the Hill-Country, into a City of Judah (viz. Hebron, a City of
the Priests, situated in the mountains of Judea, Josh. 21.10, 11.) where, when
she entered into the House of Zachary, and saluted her Cousin Elizabeth, the
babe sprang in her womb, and she, being filled with the Holy Ghost, declared
that Mary was blessed, etc. Luke 1.39, 56.

Herod banished his Brother Herod banishes his Brother.
Pheroras into his Tetrarchy, because he would not part with his wife, who
swore that he would never return till he heard of Herod's death, so that a
little after, Herod falling sick, and often sending for him, to receive some
private instructions, he refused to come for his oaths-sake.

When Elizabeth^ time was come, she brought forth a Son, who wa called Jo^n,
John Baptist is born.
and Zacharies speech being restored to him, he prophesied, saying, Bl^ssed be
the Lord God of Israel etc. Luke 1.57, ^8. and Joseph finding his betrothed

God in a dream, he took her to wife, M^t. 1.24.

Pheroras Pheroras dies.
falling sick, and Herod, beyond expectation, being recov^red, went to visit
him, and very kindly sought help for him, but he died within a few days after,
whose bo^y was brought to Jerusalem, and interred by Herod, who honored him
with public mourning.

At this time two of Pheroras's freed men, declared to Herod how he was killed
by poison, g ven him by Doris, the Mother of A^tipater, which whilst Herod
enquired into, by little and little ^e found out greater Villainies, and the
manifest treason^ ^f his Son Antip^^e^, Antipaters Treason.
who, when he went to Rome, had delivered a deadly poison t^ Pheroras, that was
sent him out of Egypt from his Uncle ^heodore, the brother of Doris,
wherewithal to m^ke aw^y (...) Father, that so the suspicion of the Parracide
should not lie upon him, being so far absent.

Hereupon Herod put Doris out of the Palace, and took from her Jewels that
were worth many Talents: He also put from him his wife Mariamne, the daughter
(...) the H^gh Priest, as a partner of all these secrets, and blotted h^ son
out of his Will, and deprived her ^ather of the High Priesthood, and
substituted in his room Ma^thias, the Son of Theophilus, that was born at
Jerusalem.

Presently after came Bathyllus, Antipaters freed-man from Rome, who being
tortured, confessed that formerly he had brought poison, and given it to D^ris,
and Pher^ras, that if the first proved too weak, they should be sure to
dispatch Herod with the second. There came also letters from his Friends at
Rome, to the King, written by the entreaty of Antipater, Antipaters Craft.
in which Archelaus and Philip, H^rods sons, were accused for often complaining
of the death of Alex^n^^^ and Aristobulus, pitying the misfortune of their
murdered brethren: For these young men were studying at Rome, and their Father
had now commanded their return: whereupon Antipater by great gifts corrupted
those friends, that by their letters they might make the young men suspected to
their Father, who if they lived, might be an hindrance to his hopes.

About this time Augustus taxing all the Roman world, our Lord Christ was born,
Christ is born.
Luke 2.4, 5.

Shortly after there came wise men from the East, the Star being their guide,
to Herod at Jerusalem, and there, being taught that the birth place of Christ,
was Bethlehem of Judea, thither they went, and entering into the house, which
was showed them by the Star that stood over it, they found the Child, and fell
down, and worshipped him, etc. Mat. 2.1, 12.

After the Angel of the Lord appeared unto J^seph in a dream, warning him to
fly into Egypt, Joseph flies into Egypt.
where he remained till the death of Herod, Mat. 2.13, 14, 15.

Herod thinking that the Child was still at Bethlehem, that he might destroy
him amongst the rest, killed all the children Herod kills the children.
which were in Bethlehem, and in all the Coasts thereof, from two years old,
and under, according to the time (of the Star first seen in the East) that he
had enquired of the wise men, Mat. 2 10.

Herod receiving letters from Antipater from Rome, in which he signified, that
having dispatched all his business according to his own mind, he would shortly
return into his own Country, he wrote back to him again, Herod ensnares his Son.
dissembling his anger, that he should make have, lest any thing should befall
him in his absence that he should not like of; and also gently complaining of
his Mother, he promised that he would remit all differences after his return.

Antipater heard no news all this while either of the death of Phero^^s, or of
those things that were on foot against him, though there were seven months
space between the wickedness proved against him, and his return. Antipaters
return.
For in his journey at Tarentum, he met with a letter of the death of Pheroras,
and in Cilicia those letters of his Father that called him back so hastily; and
when he came to C^lenderis, a Town of Calicia, he began to doubt of his return,
hearing of, and being extreme sorrowful for the disgrace of his Mother, yet
sailing forwards, he came to Sebaste, a Port of Caes^rea, where, being saluted
by none, he went to Jerusalem.

It happened that Quintilius Varus, was the same time at Jerusalem, being sent
as Successor to Saturninus into Syria, and then called thither by Herod to
assist him with his counsel in those his weighty affairs. As they were sitting
both together, in comes Antipater not knowing any thing, and in his purple
garment that he used to wear, entering the Palace; but himself being entered,
the Guards suffered none of his followers to come in with him: As he was coming
near, his Father thrust him from him, reproaching him with the murder of his
Brethren, and his intention of poisoning his Father, telling him that the next
day Varus should hear, and determine all things betwixt them, and accordingly
the next day, Varu^, and the King, sitting in Judgment, his Father himself
first began the accusation, and left the prosecution, and confirmation thereof
to his old Friend, Nicholas Damascene, one that knew all the business, and when
Antipater Antipater accused by his Father.
could not clear himself from the crimes obj^cted against him, Varus commanded
the poison that he had prepared for his Father to be brought forth, which being
given to a condemned man, killed him immediately: after which Varus rose from
the Council, and the next day went to Antiochia: but Herod cast his Son into
prison, and signified so much by letters to Caesar: sending also messengers,
who by word of mouth might acquaint him with the cursed treason of Antipater.

As these messengers were posting to Rome, Herod Herod's sickness.
fell sick, and made his Will, leaving his Kingdom to his youngest Son, Herod
Antipas, being exasperated against his two elder Sons, Archelaus, and Philip,
by the false accusations of Antipater.

Judas the son of Sariphaeus, and Matthias, the son of Margalothus, two of the
most learned of the Jews, and best Interpreters of the Law, knowing that the
Kings sickness was incurable, persuaded some young men, that were their
Scholars, to throw down the Golden Eagle The Golden Eagle hewn down.
that was set up by Herod, over the great gate of the Temple; who accordingly,
going up at noon day, pulled and hewed down with their axes the Eagle, a great
multitude being in the Temple, and beholding it: which as soon as it was told
the Captain, he came with a strong band of soldiers, and laid hold upon some
forty of the young men, together with their Masters, and brought them to Herod:
These constantly defending what they had done, Herod commanded them to be
bound, and sent them to Jericho: Then calling for the Rulers of the Jews, into
whose Assembly he was brought in a Litter, by reason of his weakness, he
complained to them, not so much of the injury done to himself, as to God (as he
said) These denying that it was done by their order, somewhat pacified him,
only he took away the High Priesthood from Matthias, whom he suspected not to
be a stranger to that fact, and made his successor Jazer, the Brother of his
Wife Mariamne, the daughter of Simon the High Priest; but he burned alive the
other Matthias that was the author of this sedition, and his companions.

Herod's Herod puts them to death. His sickness increases.
disease began now to grow worse: for he was burned with a slow fire, which was
not perceived so much by the outward touch, as by the inward effects of it,
which burnt up his very bowels: He had also the disease called the Bulemia, or
Dog-like appetite, which provoked him to a continual desire of eating, and yet
nothing would satisfy him: He was also continually tormented with ulcers in
his bowels, and pains of the colic: His feet swelled with a moist phlegm, and
his thighs also: His members rotted and were full of worms, which occasioned an
intolerable stink: He was no less troubled with a Priapisme: and moreover was
vexed with grievous convulsions, and difficulty of breathing.

And though he was so grievously tormented, that every one judged that he could
not be able to endure it long, All means of cure fail him.
yet he hoped that he should break through it, being very careful to send for
the ablest Physicians, and sought medecines from every place: He went also
beyond Jordan to the hot Baths at Calli^h^e, which run into the Asphaltite
lake, which besides the medecinal virtue, are pleasant, and good to be drunk:
There being, by the advice of his Physicians* set into a bathing tub of oil, he
seemed to them to be giving up the Ghost, yet by the sudden crying out, and
lamentations of his Friends, he came to himself again, and now seeing no hope
of recovery, he commanded fifty D^a^h^aes to be given to every soldier, and
having showed much liber^lity to his Captains, and Friends, he returned again
to Jericho.

Augustus being told that amongst the children which Herod had caused to be
slain at B^thlehem, there was a son also of his own slain, He said, That it was
better to be Herod's hog than his Son.

Herod by an edict called together to Jericho, all the most Noble of the Jews,
and when they came, he shut them all up together in a place called, the
Hippodrome, giving command to his sister Salome, and her husband Alexus, that
as soon as he was dead, they should cause his soldiers to slay them all, His
cruelty.
that so the people might have cause of sorrow, who otherwise (he feared) would
rejoice at his death.

At this time letters came from Rome from the Ambassadors whom he had sent to
Caesar, wherein they certified him that the Emperor left Antipater to his
Fathers pleasure, either to banish, or to put him to death. Herod hearing this,
was a little cheared: but presently his torments returning, and being greedy of
mea^, he called for an apple and a knife to pare it, intending with the k^ife
to have stabbed himself, He attempts to murder himself.
which also he a^tempted: but Archelaus, his Nephew, prevented him, and holding
his right hand, called for help. This accident caused much sorrow, fear, and
tumult through the whole Palace, as if Herod had been dead.

Antipate^ perceiving the noise, thought verily that his Father was dead, and
thereupon begin to tamper with his Keeper about letting him out, promising him
great rewards, both for the present, and for the fu^ure when it would lie in
his power amply to reward him: This his practice the Keeper told to the King,
who for indignation cried, and though he was so near death, yet did he raise up
himself on his Bed, and commanded o^e of his Guard to go presently and kill
Ant^pater, Antipater slain. Herod's Will.
and to bury him in the Castle of Hy^canion without any honor, which was done
accordingly.

Then did he make a new Testament: for Antipas, whom before he had made
successor to his Kingdom, he made Tetrar^h of Gal^lee, and Petre^: To his son
Philip he assigned the regi^ns of Gaulanitis, T^a^h^nitis, B^tan^a, and Pancada
in the name of a Tetrarchy, but he gave the Kingdom to his Son Archelaus: To
his sister Sal^me he gave Jamnia, Az^tus, and Thasaelis, with five hundred
thousand Dra^hmaes: To the rest of his kindred he gave money, and yearly
Pensions. To Cae a^ he gave ten Millions of Drachmaes of silver, and all his
Plate, as well of Gold as of Silver, and a great quantity of precious
movables: and To Livia, C^sars wife, and some certain friends, he gave five
Mil^ions of Dra^hmaes.

Having thus ordered these things, five days after Antipater was put to death,
His Death
he dyed himself, having enjoyed the Kingdom 34 years after the death of
Antigonus: but from the time that he was declared King by the Romans, 37 years,
about the 25th of our November, in the year of the world 4001, and after the
birth of Christ, about two years.
