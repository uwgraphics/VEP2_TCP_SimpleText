The INSCRIPTION UPON MACDUFFS CROSS, Which stands above the NEWBVRGH, near
LVNDORES, upon the Confines of STRATHERNE and FYFE.
Maldraradrum dragos Malairia largia largos
Spalando spados sive nig fig knippite gnaros
Lorea lauriscos lauringen louria luscos
Et Coluburtos sic fit tibi bursea burtus
Exitus et blaradrum sive lim sive lam sive labrum
Propter maegidrim et hoc oblatum
Accipe smeleridem super limpide lampida labrum.
THough I had this of an ingenious Gentleman, telling me he came by it from the
Clerk of Crail, who informed, that several succeeding Clerks there, have, for a
considerable time, engrost this as a true Copy in their Books, to preserve it
from utter perishing, for it is now quite worn off the stone, at least
altogether illegible. But be it so recorded in Crail, Newburgh or elsewhere,
yet with their good favor, scarcely can I judge this a true and exact Copy;
whether the fault has lain in the first Copiator from the stone, or from the
Engraver, or partly both: For, none who knows the History of Mackbeth, Malcom
Canmore and Mackduff, will, I hope suppose, that such a King as Malcom Canmore,
when he intended to witness a favor for Mackdaff's services, and such a
subject as Mackduff, when he was willing to publish the royal Bounty of his
Master, would upon the Cross of so famous a Sanctuery (as this was) have
inscribed but nonsense. And though the true meaning and purport of the words
be dark and abstruse to us, who now live at such a distance; yet I wonder why
the learned Skeen should brand them as barbarous (I hope he only means
unintelligible, and not nonsensical) For questionless they are (for what I have
said) significative, and I doubt not but to purpose; and most probably they
were written, either to signify the Privileges given by King Ma^colm to
Mackduff, with the benefits he enjoyed by virtue thereof, or the Immunities,
Freedoms and Pardons indulged by, and conferred upon, that Girth, if not in a
complicated sense, all of these together. So then, allowing them to signify
sense, which few men in a sober charity can well refuse; lets see (as far as we
may) to what Language the words are best reducible, for to any single one they
cannot: for, albeit the termination, flexion and construction I take to be most
after the Latin, and that there be some Latin words intermixed, yet none will
aver it all to be Latin; so to some other Language we must go, which is but
one of two. Our old High-land or Irish tongue, or the Saxon: And as I hardly
think it the High-land or Irish, as well, because I never, heard that brought
under Roman Terminations, Constructions, or Declinations; So even those that
would wrest it to that Language in some words, cannot follow it out in all,
although they be seen in the Irish Tongue. And it is strange, none of our
Highlanders, tho Scholars ever interprets it; therefore I much rather incline
to deduce it (at least most of it) from the Saxon, which I hope will not seem
strange to the Intelligent when he remembers what footing the Saxons had in
this Isle, and how Malcome Canmore was not only long an Exile at an English
Saxon Court, but that he had interest in Northumberland, Cumberland, and
Westmorland, which was but sometimes a Province of the West Saxons And as there
came 10000 English Saxons then in with Sibardus the Kings Grandfather, so they
must be but Novices in our Language, who do not find Vestiges of the Saxon in
it almost every where. Taking then this Inscription to be Saxon (as to the
main) aped in a Latin dress, as to the main, I say, for suppose some words
might savor of a Danish, or old French Extract, it needs not import, since
both are of a Teutonick Origin, aped, I say, in a Latin dress, whither from
the fancy of the Author, to make it to run the smoother with the n^erlaced
Latin in this his hexametrall composure, or from some inclination of King
Malcome himself, of whom and of whose time, says a grave Author, as now the
English Court by reason of the abundance of Normands therein, became most to
speak French, so the Scottish Court, because of the Queen and many English that
came with her, began to speak English, I understand the English Saxon, the
which language it would seem, King Malcome himself had before that learned, and
now by reason of his Queen, did the more affect it; thus far he, where if I
might be allowed a conjecture, perhaps this Sanctuary was granted at that pious
Queens entreaty, and here inscribed with her native tongue for her greater
honor, and the rather under a Latin Vizorn, to invite the Scots (of no
language more studious then Latin) to some love and knowledge of the Saxon.
And so let us now with allowance, to rectify what Escapes may be in the
Orthography, modestly examine the Words themselves; but lest I be thought to be
too peremptory to impose my naked Conjectures, in a matter of such Antiquity, I
shall bring my Vouc^ers where I have them, with the probable Motives that
prevail with me to such a sense, still leaving a just Liberty to all who can
find out better.

First then (as the words ly in order) I take Maldraradrum to be a
supposititious Genitive, in the plural number after the Greek way, from Maldra,
Maldrus, the German Maldar, pro modio seu certa mensura frumentaria; and
Spelman says, Maldri vocabulum est Alemanicum; and have we not to this day
with us the Word Melder and a Melder of corn, and this Genitive Maldraradrum I
construe with dragos, conjoined with its Latin adjective Largos, and this
Dragos I supose de^izon'd a Roman from drach or drache of the Greek (...)
manipulus (...) prehendo, manu arripio, Fut. 2. (...), from which belike we
have the words Draught (as applied to Cups and Fish-netts) drag, draw, so that
largos, dragos, maldraradrum, may signify large quantities or measures of
Corn, to be taken by some compulsive or distreinziable Force, as will I hope
anon be sound agreeable with the rest of the Sentence.

Malairia, I fancy here by wrong Orthography mis-written for mairia, Officium
Majoris, Majoratus, Praefectura, says Spelman, (sufficiently known in the
Burrowes Royal:) And does not our Skeen in his 15. Chap. of the Statutes of
Alexander the Second, call the Earl of Fyfe, Marus Regis Comitatus de Fyfe,
(whereof more anon) M^iria, I take to be in the Ablative Case, for we must not
here be tied to the strict Rules of Metrical Quantities, or Grammatical
Constructions.

Largia, mis-written I suppose for Lagslita, or Laghslita, by inadvertency or
transposing of the Saxon Letters; yea, and the Saxons sometimes in their
Capitals, placed Letters within Letters, and were somewhat odd in their
Contractions and Abbreviations, especially in Monumental Inscriptions;
Lagslita, Transgressio Legis, Legis violatae poena, proprie ruptio legis, seu
mulcta pro transgressione legis, Lag and Lagh, Lex, and Slit, rupta, Vox
Danica, and in Anglo-Danorum Legibus primum deprehensa, says Spelman; But what
needs me cite Spelman, have we not the Phrase, ilk land has its Laugh, and is
not the word Slit, as obvious as beneficial to every Tailor: Lagslita, I take
to be in the Accusative Case, which must be supplied with the Preposition
propter, and yet for all this the sentence is but mank without the help of a
Verb, which must be borrowed in knippite, written belike for knighthite, by
placing the Roman p for the Saxon th, which yet may be excused; since Spelman
finds that fault in the Transcriber of Canutus Laws, upon the word Thegen, or
Pegen. Knighthite then, or Knippite, being a supposititious Verb, (for I know
not the Saxon Constructions or Conjugations) after the Latin form, from the
Saxon knight, or knyt, signifying famulus minister, may import as much as,
Receive ye as my Servant or Deputy, and being joined with Mairia, as my
Lieutenant, (for so is yet a Maire within Burgh) so that famulus minister in
this word here must be honorable, and (...), as it is in Theini, Theigni,
Thani, who from Thien to serve, were but famuli ministri, and yet were those
famuli Regni Barons, as Spelman notes. And thus the sentence may be expounded,
Receive for your Service as my Lieutenant, and through and by virtue of your
Office of Lieutenantry, uplift and distreinzy large quantities and measures of
Corn, for the Transgressions and Breach of the Laws, and why then should Skeen
term that Barbarous, who himself homologats the same sense in another
Language, in that his above cited Chapter of King Alexander the second,
Entitled, De Forisfacturis levandis ab illis qui remanent ab ^xercitu, where
in the marginal Gloss upon the 4. Para. speaking of the Earl of Fyfe, his words
are, Et ille non sicut Comes, sed sicut Marus Regis Comitatus de Fyfe, ad
rectitudines suas exigendas: and does he not again, in his De Verborum
significatione, in the word Clanmackduff, say out of Boettus, that amongst
other Privileges, Mackduff and his Clan had the Privilege and Right of a
Regality; yea and does not the learned Spelman say, what was Gildwite to the
English Saxons was Laghslite to the Danes, and and both forisfactura to the
Normans, ( amerciaments with us) where may be noticed the judicious exactness
of the composer, in his prefixing the general word Laghslita, to be amerciat by
victual or corn; For Laghslitae, says one, anumerandae sunt mediis and
levioribus delict^, quorum mulctae pietatis intuitu, and per misericordiam
imponuntur. Nec graviora crimina, says another, inter Laghslitas simplices
numerata aut levia, quaeque instar graviorum mulctata quisquam opinabitur. And
so how methodically does here our old versificator proceed to faults and crimes
of greater guilt, and more special denomination yet for a while still under the
Conduct of Knippite.

Sive gnaros spalando spados, I conjecture to signify, whether such as are
known cunning, or accustomed to want, or put away their Weapons of Warfare: the
two first words being Latin, I hope will not be refused; the construction of
spaland^, I take to be a Gerund for an Infinitive, gnaros spalare a counterfeit
Conjugation from an old French word, espaler to scatter, cast away, or spread
abroad. Spados from espade or espadon, in the same language, a sword, and by a
Metonymy, for any weapon. Neither needs it be strange that these Words are
borrowed from the old French, which did depend upon the Teutonick and high
German, as the modern does now more upon the Latin^; and that wanting and away
putting of weapons of warfare were with us reputed Crimes, and punished as
such, see Skeen himself, in the 27 chap. of the first statutes of King Robert
the Bruce, de armaturis pro guerra and poena little quo eas non habent; Which is
there said to be forfaulture, or escheate of all his goods, and in the last
chap. of the same Statutes, entitled, Non licetrendere arma hostibus Regni:
The punishment is loss of Life, and Limb, and all they can tyne to the King,
which must be Goods. And it were but frivolous to allege that these Statutes
are long after the upsetting of Macduffs cross: For, how many things are
punishable by the Common Law and practick of the Kingdom, before they become
Statutorie: And does not their coming under a Statute, imply a prior Custom?
Yea, an^ who knows, but that after such a catastrophe as was at, and before,
the Bruces coming to the Crown, they might be rather but revived, then
original. And have not our subsequent Laws for Weapon-shawings been founded
upon their Customs, to prevent such inconveniences for the future?

Sive nig, And here we must return again to the Saxon, nig, For nighwite, the
Syllable Wite, mulcta poena, being left out, which is sometime ordinary (our
Ancestors delighting much in Monosyllables) and the rather allowable in this
Metrical composure, nig or nigh contracted from nithing, Nidling or niderling;
such as stay away from the host; For, says not Malmesberiensis, Jubet
(scilicet ^ex) ut compatriotas advocent ad obsidionem venire, nisi siqui velin^
sub nomine Niderling, quod nequam sonat remanere, Angli qui nihil miserius
putarent quam h^jus^e vocabuli dedecore aduri catervatim ad Regem, confluunt
and invincibilem exercitum faciu^t And says not Matthew Paris, Vt ad
obsidionem ventant jubet nisi velint sub nomine Nithing, recenseri* Angli qui
nihil contumeliosius and vilius estimant, quam hujusmodi ignominioso vocabulo
etc. And does not Spelman deduce Nidling, a vocabulis Anglo Normanicis, Nid, id
est, nidus and Ling pullus, ac si ignavi isti homines, qui in exercitum
proficisci nolunt pullorum instar essent, qui de nido non audeant prodire domi
latitantes and torp^scentes. And have we not the above cited 15 chap. of our
Alexander the second, entitled, De foris facturis levandis ab illis qui
remanent ab exercitu Regis, Where the Earl of Fyfes privilege is expressly
reserved to him, qua marus Regis ad rectitudines suas exigendas; And wh^t be
the pains and punishments of such as stay from, or desert the Kings Host, are
they not sufficiently known, and freshly remembered by us to this day?

Fig for Figwi^e, Figwita, or Fyghtwita, the mulct of such as by fighting
raises a fray, trouble, or disturbance in the Host, or perhaps more generally,
mulcta Rixarum cum verberibus, vel ipsae pugnae and Ranulphus Cistrensis calls
Fy^twite, amerciamentum pro conflictu* And have we not a severe certification
in a subsequent statute against such a raises a fray in the Host, 54 Act, 12.
Par. Ja 2d. And is not the word Fight yet plain with us?

Lorea by wrong Orthographie* pro Lothea (I suppose) from the Saxon Hloth,
Hlode, the Saxon aspiration being left out in the transcribing as is ordinary,
the Saxons having a peculiar way of fixing aspirations on their consonants, by
engrossing them with the same figure, as the Greeks in their (...) and the R.
here written for Th, the Saxon figure of both being apt to impose one for
another, if not narrowly noticed: Qui de Hloth suerat accusatus abneget per
centum viginti Hidas, and sic emendet: hoc est, says Spelman, qui ^urmae
illegitimae interfuisse arguitur, etc. And Hlothbota, mulcta ejus est qui
turmae il^egitimae intersuerit, Bo^e Saxonicum, compensatio emendatio; And have
we not a phrase in some places, they clod together, from the Saxon Hlode,
turma, and how far unlawful meetings and convocations of the Liege; have been,
and yet still are troublesome to this Kingdom, these that run may read: And if
this word be rightly deduced, it seems, our forefathers have very prudently
here placed it among the thick of the Cryms, which makes me the rather admire,
why so much noise has in this our Age been made for suppressing them, as if
unlawful meetings had never been thought a Crime with us, till of late, I know
some may incline to deduce this word from Lot, of the Saxon Hlot, sors, pars
tributi sive solutionis alicujus quam inter alios quis tenetur praestare, says
Sp^lman; So that such would make the meaning here to be a gift or s^r^ender of
all Unlaws or Escheats belonging to the King, and in that so often cited 15
chap. of the Statutes of Alexander the second, in the 5 parag. some ground may
be there for such a conjecture from de Cavellis vero, etc. And some such
privilege is yet granted to the house of Argyle, in point of escheats (or
unlaws for Crimes) which yet here I conceive sufficiently included in
knigththite, mairi^, and therefore likes best of the first exposition of the
special Crime of unlawful Convocations, with liberty to the candid Reader to
choose as he pleases.

Lauriscos, I suppose should be read Leudiscos, from leudis, leodis and leudum,
quae verba dicuntur pro Wergildo, de capitis estimatione leudi soccisi scilicet
de compositione quam aliter Weram and Wergildum, vocan. Leudis, vasallus,
cliens, homo ligius, subditus: So leudiscos may signify the amerciaments which
were then due to the King by and attour the Kinbote) for killing of a free
Leidge. And that it was the custom among the Northern Nations, rather to
amerciat then to take blood for blood, Hear Tacitus, Germani veteres and
Aquilonares gentes, qui jugum pariter and leges omni Europae imposuere
gravissima delicta ipsaque homicidia pecuniis commutabant: And another saying,
Poenarum enim ratio apud mediorum Saeculorum homines in mulctis, potius quam in
sanguine sita fuit.

For lauringem, I willingly would read laricingin, Robbrie and theft, for thus
with the n it is in the plural number from Laricinium, the French Larrecin, and
both belike from the Latin Latrocinium, where says Spelman, Prisca Anglorum
lex Larricinium divisit in majus and minus, the one with violence and force,
the other without, the one in things of greater moment, the others of less:
Hence the legal term Petit larcens, yet in use with the English.

Lauria, I would read lairia, for lairwite layrwit, or leirwite, Stupri seu
concubitus illegitimi mulcta in adulteros, fornicatores, virginumque
corruptores animadversio ( belike in their lines a rape, as they are expounded
relative to the Girth) from the Saxon lagan, concumbere legar, concubitor, and
wi^e, quasi concubitoris mulcta. And says not clearly Spelman, Ad maneriorum
dominos (nescio an ad omnes ex consuetudine) olim pertinuit jurisdictio de
nativis suis (id est servis and ancillis) corruptis cognoscendi multamque
delinquentibus, tam viris quam foeminis inferendi ad quosdam etiam non de his
solum sed and de aliis quibuscunque intra dominium ipsorum sic peccantibus, and
have we not yet the word Laire in Childbed Laire and others.

Luscos, I do not here take to be the Latin Luscus, but that the word should
be rather written, liscos, for, or from Fliscos, the letter F, being lest out
to make the line run the closser upon the letter L. Fliscos, Fugitivos,
Fugitives, the words Flee, Flight, and Flisk, sufficiently known, as to flisk
up and down here and there, as Fugitives use to do, who dare not well stay long
in one place, all from, or in great affinity with Leipa, Si quis a Domino suo
sine licentia discedat, ut Leipa emendetur, which Spelman understands, de
profugo.

Et Coloburtos, I read, Colovurtos, or yet rather Colovortos, or Colovertos:
But like the Vowel u, is written in the third Syllable, to clinch the better by
Bur, with the last word of the line: And every Bajane knows the affinitive
betwixt the letters, B. and U. The signification however I take to be
runawayes, such as run away from their colors, and Culvertagium, I find a
reproachful term of Cowardice, which Spelman thinks to come from Culvert a
Dove, a columbina timidiatte, perhaps (as well, if not better) from vertere
colobium: sure I am, we have the word Turn-coat, allusive to its sense; and may
not our disdainful word Collie derive its pedigree hence?

Sic fit tibi bursea burtus, and so through the amerciaments and unlaws of the
above written Crimes, your purse shall be heavy, that is, your gains and
advantage the greater, Bursea for Bursa, and is not the word Burden, of known
signification to the meanest? And their above written words would I rather, at
least more especially expound with a relation to the Regalitie, and its
Privileges, in favors of the Earl, yet not excluding some benefits of a
Sanctuary to the transgressors (upon a composition) as the Reader at his
pleasure may best incline to. But for my own part (with a just deference to
better judgments) as I should attribute the preceding lines, rather to the
Regalitie, so should I give the subsequent more to the Sanctuary.

Exitus et Blaradrum, would I read exitus et bladadrum, a genetive, as
Maldraradrum, from blade a weapon by which a mortal wound is or may be
inflicted: Hence with us Blade, a sword, or sharp edged weapon, and with the
Countrymen, to give a Blad, blaw, or after the English dialect, a blow, all
(it would seem) from the Greek (...), laedo, And does not Spelman say, That the
Saxons in their Language agreed with, and followed much more the Graecians,
then the Romans.

Sive lim, whether on a limb, Sive lam, id est, Lath, Lith, ^ra Lit, the vowel
i, commuted for a, and the letter m, fort, or th, It being usual for the Poets
then, who were the Priests, to run much upon a letter; and is it not given for
a rule, literae ejusdem ordinis and organi inter se sunt permutabiles; And here
Th, being consonans aspirata, is not so entirely and depress'dly a Mute, but
that it may be changed for a liquid in a Saxon Poem. Limb, membrum cum ^sse
Lith, articulus cum nervis. And is not Lath used for what is pliable by, with,
or on some ligament.

Labrum, I take here to signify life, by some Catechresis of the Author,
allusive to the phrase, Our life is in our lip.

Propter magidrim* I would write, magidrin, Familias cognationis, seu
cognatorum, from the Saxon maeg, Cognatus, says Spelman, the diphthong being
abreviated to the vowel, (as is ordinary in the transcribing or compounds of
that Language) mag, mage, or maghe, a kinsman, or Cousin: whence we use the
word maech, for affinis to this hour and Hired, hidre, or hider, which
Verstegan interprets a Lineage, a Family, hidrin, in the plural number: The
Saxons making that by adding n, as we do now s, and leaving out the aspiration
in the composition: Does not thus Magidrin better quadrat and agree with the
privilege Skeen gives by that Girth, to the Clanmack-duffe, then to take
propter for prope, as some would, and Magidrim for Mugdrim, because forsooth,
the cross stands upon, or near a place of that name: But allowing their
conjecture, what sense or cohaesion can they make from this, their prope
mugdrim? Yet a little to convince them, Dare they not rather think, their
mugdrim bears that name from this magidrin, in the lines, and imports as much,
as the land, or place lying beside, or about the cross, of the kindred. And
seeing there are yet the vestiges of some old buildings at mugdrim, Would it be
any Heresy to think, that sometimes dwelt there an Overseer, to notice such as
came to, and claimed the benefit of, the Sanctuary? which Skeen says, was
such to the Kindred of Mackduff, that when any Manslayer, being within the
ninth degree of kin and blood to Mackduffe, came to that cross, and gave nine
Kye and a Colpindach, he was free of the slaughter committed by him. And thus
has our learned Skeen made us understand, hoc oblatum.

Accipe smeleridem, And for your Oblation, Receive an Oblivion, an Indemnitie,
a Pardon; whence belike we yet have the word smeire, smeare, smore, as if a
thing so covered over, by consequence may be presumed to be forgotten, or
smeleris, smeleridis, (after the Greek way, as from Spelman, I have said, was
but ordinary with the Saxons) Quasi abstersio, detersio, purgatio, form (...),
abstergo, detergo, purgo. I know some would have smeleridem, to signify a
kiss, from smeirikin, a word so used in some places: but sure, our Smeleridem
here must import more otherwise, Alas! this privilege would prove to the
manslayer, but as in the proverb, A kiss and a drink of cold water: But
because the conjecture came (as I heard) from a man of reverence and reading,
let me ingross it thus, For this your offering or gift (to wit, of the kye) and
by kissing of the Cross, receive ye an Oblivion.

Super limpide lampida labrum, sufficiently explained already, only I could
have wished they had come to my hand under a more Saxon Garb: limthite lamthita,
the Saxon th, in the transcribing being often turned to b, d, or p, whether
from the ignorance of the Saxon Character, or Euphoniae gratia, for good
companies sake of the Words with which they are conjoined: And that I had
reason to reduce most of these Words to the Saxon, I now (from what I have
said) referr to the Courteous Reader, and hope I shall not be judged
unreasonable to think these Lines, as I got them, might be miswritten in their
Orthography, whether from the misunderstanding of the Saxon Character, if they
were so ingraved, or (after so many Centuries) even of any other in which it
might have been cut, since none who knows any thing, but knows it wants not its
own difficulty to read but the Characters of an Age or two from our selves, be
they written in Parchment, or engraven in Brass or Stone: as for instance, I
shall not stick to say they be no small Clerks, whom I could hold upon a Wager,
would they go to St. Andrews, they should hardly at the first View, read me
distinctly, with one Breath, the Inscription of Bishop Kennedies Tomb, in the
Chapel of St. Salvators College, though he died but in the Year, 1466. And
seeing I have heard several Copies and various Readings of these Lines (should I
rather say of the Inscription upon this Cross) all differing amongst
themselves, why may not I (seeing Skeen, of the two last which being most
stuff with Latin, might be thought most legible, says no more, then, that
they appeared to be conform to that purpose) crave Leave to offer mine, which
to the intelligent will not appear very dissonant from the Copy I have already
here transcribed, and the less will the difference yet be, to any who knows the
Saxon Character, yea, and what if in some Characters our Predecessors wrote
not as the English? does not every Language have its Dialects differing
sometimes in whole Syllabications, as in the Lettering, Writing, and
Pronunciation, (not to speak of the Injuries of Weather in so long a Tract of
time) so upon all Adventures, I willingly would rectify and read my Copy thus,
Maldraradrum dragos Mairia laghslita largos
Spalando spados sive nig fig knighthite gnaros
Lothea leudiscos laricingen lairia liscos
Et Colovurtos sic fit tibi bursia burtus
Exitus et bladadrum sive lim sive lam sive labrum
Propter magidrin et hoc oblatum
Accipe smeleridem super limthide lamthida labrum.


And this my Reading with their Orthographical Amendments, I submit to the
discretion of the judicious, allowing any to use either the Roman p or the
Saxon th, in what words I have here altered as they think fit, or shall agree
best with their Ear and Fancy; And having already been so full upon every Word,
I hope a closs interpretation needs not be here expected, because belike it may
relish better, that (from what I have said) every man be his own Interpreter.
Yet not too much to burden the Memory of the Reader, may I briefly paraphrase
it; for a verbatim Exposition here, as in all the old Tongues (and they say the
Teutonick, whereof the Saxon is but a Branch, came with Twisco from Babel)
would sound a little harsh, as well in respect of the idiotisms of the two
languages, as that most of the Words are legal Terms, or relating thereto, and
so will hardly allow a narrow and precise Exposition: and although the ground
work be Saxon, yet appears it under a Latin Mask; therefore as I said, I crave
pardon to Paraphrase it under one View thus,

Ye Earl of Fyfe, receive for your Services, as my Lieutetenant by Right of
this Regality, large Measures of Victual or Corn, for the Transgressions of the
Laws, as well from those as want or put away their Weapons of Warfare, as of
such as stays away from or refuses to come to the Host, or those that raises
Frayes or Disturbances therein, or from such as keep, haunt, and frequent
unlawful Convocations; together with all Amerciaments due to me, for the
slaughter of a free Liege, or for Robbery and Theft, or for Adultery and
Fornication within your Bounds, with the Unlaws of Fugitives, and the Penalties
due by such Cowards as deserts the Host, or runs away from their Colors; thus
shall your Gains be the greater. And yet further, to witness my kindness, I
remit to those of your own Kindred, all issues of Wounds, be it of Limb, Lith,
or Life, in swa far as for this Offering (to wit, of nine Kyne and a Queyoch)
they shall be indemnified for Limb, Lith, or Life. And thus have I adventured
to read and explain this Old Inscription, quae molta tenet anteiqua sepolta;
and which, with Skeen's good Leave, I can no otherwise condemn for Barbarous,
then that it is Saxon under a Latin Cover; where it would be remembered, that
after the Goths and Vandals came into Italy, the Purity of the Roman Tongue was
at a loss, until somewhat revived in the last Centurie, and that the Poets
about Malcome Canmore's time, were ordinarily the Priests, and those of no
great Reading, and for the most part no great and exact Linguists, or so neat
and closs in their Poesy; as witness that Composition of the Carmelite Frier's
upon the battle of Bannockburn, some hundreds of years after the setting up of
this Cross: And as this was one of, if not the oldest Regality in this
Country, so by the Privileges hereby granted, it will to any understanding
man appear to be very great; whence belike we have that common Phrase, The
Kingdom of Fife, (an Epithet given to no other Shire) as if Mackduff had
enjoyed his Estate much after the way of Hugh Lupus (or more properly de
Abrincis) in his Earldom of Chester, of whom it is said, he enjoyed that
Earldom from his Uncle the Conqueror, Adeo libere ad gladium, sicut ipse Rex
tenebat totam Angliam ad Coronam; and yet I cannot affirm that Fife was ever a
Palatinate; But sure the Privileges of this Regality and Sanctuary were
somewhat more then ordinary. And this our Mackduffs posterity continued in a
line male till the days of King David the Bruce: for one of them I find
Governor of Perth for the second Baliol, after the Battle of Duplin, for
which, whether he was forfaulted, or that his Estate and Honors, through want
of issue-male, went with a Daughter, I cannot positively averr: For, one
William Earl of Fife I find a witness in a Charter, granted by King David 2d,
to the Scrimzeour of Didupe, in the 29. year of his Reign, whom I conceive to
be that William Ramsay said by Skeen to have been made Earl of Fife by King
David, withal Privileges, and cum Lege quae vocatur Clanmackduff, who might
have married a Daughter of Earl Duncans, as well because he got all the old
Privileges confirmed to him* as that in the Scrimzeours Charter, he is placed
before the Earl of March; It not being so probable that the King would have
given the privileges, and precedencie of the old Earls of Fyfe to a new
Stranger, if he had not had an interest of blood. And why should we too rashly
conclude that noble Family, whose predecessors had deserved so well of the
Crown, extinct upon a forefaultour for holding the Town of Perth for the second
Baliol: Since our Historian says no more, But that he was sent Prisoner to the
Castle of Kildrummie, and that he makes him also a prisoner to the Baliol, with
the Earls of Murray, Monteth, and others; who, as he says, after the battle
of Duplin, were Rebus desperatis coacti jurare in verba Balioli.

Neither were the Bruce's too strick and severe in their forefaultours, (but
upon great and singular provocations) studying rather to gain and reconcile the
Subject by Indemnities, and Oblivions, then to exasperate them by too sharp
punishments (especially when the Baliols had some pretense and shadow of Right)
But what became of this William Ramsay, I cannot say; whether he was
forefaulted, or whether through want of issue, the Earledom of Fyfe returned to
the Crown, or whether he had a daughter who was married to Robert the
Governor, who enjoyed the Estate and Honors of Fyfe: But if as full in its
privileges as the old Mackduffs, or William Ramsay, I dare not determine. But
Skeen does positively tell us, that one Spence of Wormeston laid claim to, and
enjoyed the privilege of the Sanctuary, upon his killing of one Kinninmonth,
as being within the degrees of kindred to Mackduffe.

The Earl of Weems, and the Lord of Mackintosh speak themselves truly
descended in a line Male from this our Mackduffe, by two of his sons; But since
I have seen nothing in write, as I shall be tender of their honor, not
doubting but that they are sufficiently able from good documents, to evince
their assertions to any who may be concerned; So I hope, it shall give no
offense, though I glance at what I have from Tradition. Mackintosh then (be he
the elder or the younger brother) in his Mother Tongue calls himself to this
very day, Maktosich^ Vichdhu^e, (that is, Filius Thani filii Duffi: the son of
the Thane, who was the son of Duffe) whose Predecessor some three or four
generations down from Mackduffe, was in the days of K. William the Lion, by
means of his Uncle Mackdonald of the Isles, matched to the Heretrix of the
Clanchattan, by whom he got the Lordship of Lochaber: the Jurisdiction or
Stewartrie whereof, as the Lord of Mackintosh yet retains, so quarters he the
coat of Mackduffe in the chief corner of his shield. The Earl of Weems (be he
from the younger brother or elder) yet possesses for his Inheritance, a part of
the old Mackduff's Estate in Fyfe: And whose Progenitor, Sir David Weems,
Ambassador for the Maiden of Norway upon the death of K. Alexander the third,
is by Buchanan (nothing lavish of his Titles) styled, Equus Fifanus illustris.
And does not the Earl of Weems quarter also the Arms of the Earl of Fyfe, in
his first and last Escutcheons.

But as upon conference, I have met with an objection or two, so indulge me,
Reader, I pray, for your fuller satisfaction, briefly here to repeat them with
my answers: which (seeing I leave every man to his own judgment) may I hope, be
neither an impertinent, nor altogether an unpleasant diversion.

First then, Was it alleged, That neither Mackintosh, nor Weems, give the
Surname of Mackduffe: And what then? Will any pretender to the least knowledge
of any Antiquity, or Reading, urge the arguement as conclusive, That therefore
they are not of the same Stock, or Blood; yea, even by a line Male But (not
here to debate, whether at that time any other Surnames, then Patronymicks,
were fixed to a Family or Progeny) Can there be a clearer deduction then Duffe,
Mackduffe (who was the Thane) and Macktosich-Vichdhuie, or would the movers of
this objection, put me upon the question, when surnames (as now in use) first
settled amongst us? And what if that was not before, perhaps considerably after,
the days of Macolm-Canmore (I wish those Disputants would be pleased to teach
me, what were the surnames of the old Earls of Stra^^erne, Lennox, and Rosse)
Yea, and does not the native exposition of Mackint^sh, imply him begot en (and
perchance he was of age too) ere Mackduffe was dignified with the tittle of
Earl, and consequently, before the return of Malcolm Canmore, with whom (some
say) first came in as well that order of Honor, as the customs of our
surnames. And seeing Weems was Mackintosh's Brother, might not he have been (and
if elder surely, and even though the younger belike) in the same condition,
begot before his father went to England, seeing Buchanan says of Mackbeth, that
upon Mackduff's escape, in uxorem and liberos omnem iram effudit: The latitude
whereof I leave to be measured by such, who can best fathom the passions of an
exasperated Tyrant. But what if I should say, as Boethius observes upon the
Stuarts in a much later time, that it was customary with us (as yet somewhat it
is with the second sons of Barons in France) for Cadets to quit the surnames,
they might have from their Paternal Family, and betake themselves and their
posterity to others, and most ordinarily to the names of their proper
possessions (as Weems here, from that word signifying Caves, whereof there be
no scarcity thereabout) and so much the more easily in this case, where the
Paternal it self Mackduffe, is but a Patronymick. Yet shall I not escape
without a second Attacque, managed with I know not what confidence: To wit,
That Mackduffes race, save in Mackintosh and Weems, continued not above a
generation or two: Sure then, has our Buchanan exceedingly abused us; who all
along, even down to the battle of Duplin, and the siege of Perth thereupon,
writes them still Mackduff; his words in his ninth book, being, Mackduffus,
Fifae Comes qui oppidum Balioli nomine tenuerat, and a little before that
above cited place, yet more particularly, Duncanus Mackduffus, Fifensis Comes
(with others) apud Hostem captivus. And as all our Writers do unanimously rank
this Duncan, the first Secular of the six Governors, after the death of K.
Alexander the third, so have I my self read him, in a letter from the
Parliament at Abirbrothock to the Pope, anno 1320. First of all named, and
signing as Earl Primier of the Kingdom, where his seal yet appends fresh, four
times bigger then any of the rest, with the Impresse as they Record the Arms
in the books of Herauldrie for the old Earls of Fyfe, and as yet they are
quartered by Mackintosh and Weems. But thirdly, it is retorted upon me, that if
the Earl of Weems, and Lord of Mackintosh, had been true Cadets in a line
Male, then if the Mackduff of Fyfe had not been forefaulted, one or other of
them would undoubtedly, as the nearest Heir Male, have fallen to, and enjoyed, if
not the Estate, at least the Honors of Fyfe. But the starters of this doubt,
would be pleased to remember the slipperiness of its grounds; For are not
Feudal Tailzies, and seclusive Provisions to Heirs Male, of a far later date
with us: And so might that Earledom as well in its Honors, as Fortune, have
gone with a daughter (as heir of line) to William Ramsay, and by a grand, child
to Robert Stuart: Yea, and who well knows in what terms our grants of honor,
(if then in Malcom Canmor's days consigned to writ) were conceived, or if they
reached Collaterals* And the Predecessors of the Earl of Weems and Lord of
Mackintosh, having come off many generations before the Family failed in the
issue Male, the Honors might (the relation being remote) the more readily have
been conveyed by a new Patent, with a Daughter or Oye in favors of some noble
Minion, such as (belike was this William Ramsay, and) that Robert Stuart the
Kings second son, who was sometimes Governor of Scotland, and Duke of Albanie,
in the person of whose Son, Duke Murdoch, was that Earldom forefaulted to the
Crown, in the days of K. James the first, and not as yet given out again, none
ever since enjoying the Title and Dignity of Earl of Fyfe.

But having thus far presumed upon, if not quite wearie^ your patience, in this
so thornie and mistie affair; I must now, Courteous Reader, stand to the
discretion of your Censure, where I shall allow you, That Rebus in priscis, ad
unguem haud est quaerenda veritas.

If on the other hand you will be pleased to grant me, Fidum annalium genus,
sunt pervetusta carmina.

And suffer me to conclude with what Skeen closes the Preface to his De
verborum significatione, Si quid novisti rectius istis,
Candidus imperti: si non, his utere mecum.


FINIS.
THat, Gentle Reader, I may conceal you nothing; Just now, as it was a doing
under the Irons am I told there is an exact Coppie, with a true exposition of
this Inscription at the Newburgh, in the hands, or books of the Clerk there:
And yet my Informer, though with us a good Antiquarie and Historian, could
neither tell me the lines, nor the exposition. And pity it were that so old
and famous a Monument in this our Kingdom, should be so closlie dormant, in a
poo^ Countrey-village, without being communicate (for ought I know) to any: For
it should seem, our Clerk-register Skeen, had neither seen nor heard of it,
otherwise (me thinks) he would hardly have called the lines so barbarous. But
this, however, I hope may invite those of the Newburgh to divulge it, (if
any-such thing they have) for it is only truth, (not vanity) that here I am in
quest of. And as this my weak Essay, I have adventured upon, without the help
of any living^ So crave I no it other Patron, but, Courteous Reader, your own
Candor and Ingenuity.
