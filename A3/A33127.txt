PERTH, 7. Januar. 1651.
THE COMMISSION of the GENERAL ASSEMBLY, Seriously considering the present
Distress and Danger of the LORDS PEOPLE in this KIRK and KINGDOM, through the
Unjust Violence and Oppression, and the Pernicious Errors of the Sectarian
Army of ENGLAND, continuing now a long time in this LAND; Have found it
necessary to emit this SOLEMN WARNING, for Information of all the Members of
this KIRK, and stirring them up to their duty at this time: AND, Do Ordayn
the same, To be Publictlie read in all the CONGREGATIONS of this KIRK; Whereof
PRESBYTERIES are to take especial care, And to make report.

Perth, 7. Januar. 1651.
A Solemn Warning, to all the Members of this Kirk, From the Commission of the
General Assembly.
AS it has pleased the LORD, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in
working, in the carrying on of His Work, since the time of the first receaving
of our National Covenant, for the Mayntenance of that Work in this Kirk and
Kingdom, and entering into the Solemn League and Covenant, with our neyg^bour
Kingdoms of England and Ireland, for propagating and advancing the same amongst
them, to exercise His people with many trials: So it has been His great
Mercy, not only to p^^serue the public judicatories of this Kirk faithful
and steadfa^t with him in his Covenant and Cause: But also to furnish them with
Wisdom and Cowrage, to discern and give seasonable Warnings against diverse
Tentations and Snares of the times, and to hold forth to the people of GOD
their duties in every trial; whereby it has come to pass, through the LORDS
Blessing upon their labors, that such as feared GOD, have been much helped to
stand fast in the Cause of GOD, in the saddest hours, and greatest Tentations,
until the LORD did make a way to esc^pe.

And now, the LORD in His Wise and Most Holy Dispensation, having brought His
People of this Land, unto as sad a trial, as any that ever we have been in
since the beginning of the Work, by the Invasion, Prevalencie, and Oppression
of the Sectarian Party of England; Although at the time of their first
Invading of this Kingdom, the Injustice and Perfidiousness of their Cause, was
abundantly discovered by the Committee of Estates, and the General Assembly,
and Seasonable Warning was given against compliance with them, (which we hope
all who truly love GOD, Religion, and Government, have not yet forgotten and
casten behind their back, But will make conscience to follow) Yet, considering
that the LORD for our trial has suffered the Tentation to grow, and
perceaving that some already perfidiouslie and unnaturallie have gone in to
them; We des^ring to be faithful to GOD in our Station, find it a duty
i^cumbent to us, to renew the Word of Exhortation to all the people of GOD in
this Land; hoping that the LORD according to His wonted way of Blessing the
Word of His Servants, w^^l not let it be ineffectuall upon the hearts of such
as fear HIM.

In the first place, therefore, We exhort, and as the Servants and Messengers
of JESUS CHRIST, Do in His Name, charge the People of GOD in this Kirk and
Kingdom, To avoid all sors of Complying with these foresaid Enemies; Whether by
speaking favourablie of them, and their ways, or speaking disrespectfullie of
the public, just, and necessary Resolutions and Proceedings of Kirk and
State, for opposing their wicked Designs, against this Kingdom, and delyvering
the Land from their Unjust and Cruel Oppression, or reproaching such in Kirk
and state, as have been constant in the COVENANT and CAUSE of GOD, and adhered
to our first Principles, with Imputations and Aspersions of Malignancie, and
Back-slyding, because of their Zeal against that Enemy, and care to have the
Liberties and Government of this Kingdom mayntayned against their Violence, or
by Conversing with them familiarlie, or by Contributing any thing in an active
way, for their mayntenance and help: But especially, by keeping correspondence
with them mediatelie, or immediately, to give them intelligence of the
Counsels, Resolutions, and Proceedings of Kirk or State, by going in unto, or
joining with them in Counsel or Arms, or any other way of acting for their
Cause, or seducing others to any of these: And to the effect, that all may be
the more stirred up to guard themselves against their fair and entysing words,
and against the suggestions and insinuations of any that are Agents for them,
We desire and warn all People of the Land, to take notice of, and consider,
beside such things as have been represented in former Papers:

First, That as they did most Unjustly and Perfidiously Invade this KINGDOM,
contrary to Covenant and Treaties, as was cleared before the world, by the
Papers emitted both by Kirk and State, at their first incomming, the intentions
of this kingdom, as then, so now, being no other, but the mayntenance of
Religion, their own just Rights, Liberties, and Government, not owning any
Malignant interest, nor owning any interest what-so-ever of man's, But according
to the COVENANT, in subordination to Religion, and the saferie of these
Kingdoms; So that as their Invasion was most Unjust and Perfidious, So is their
guiltiness now exceeding much increassed, and heightened, by much innocent
Bloodshed of the People and Saints of GOD in this LAND, the more than
Barbarous usage of our Prisoners, by sterving many hundreths of them, with
Hunger and Cold, and sending away many others, as Slaves unto remote parts of
the world; by laying many Congregations of the Land waste, chasing Ministers
from their Charges, Spoiling, Plundering, and Oppressing the People of GOD in
the Land.

Now, For any of this Kirk and Kingdom, to comply and join with this Enemy,
and to act any ways for them, were it not besides the unnatural Treachery of
it, against their Native Country (a Villainy which has been abominable and
execrable, even amongst all Heathen Nations, much more amongst Christian
People) Were it not a most manifest, personal, and formal Violating of our
Solemn Covenant, where in we are bound to mayntayn Religion, the Liberties,
and Government of the Kingdom, the Kings Majesty's Person, and Government, in
the defense of Religion, and every one another in this Common Cause? And,
also, To be accessorie unto, and bring upon themselves the guiltiness of all
these men's opposition to the Work of GOD, usurpation, persecution of faithful
and steadfast COVENANTERS in the other two Kingdoms, and of their Unjust
Invading of this Kingdom, all the Bloodshed, Despyte against the Ordinances of
GOD, Violence, Oppression, and Villainies, which they have done since they came
into it: And would it not, not only render us vile and reproachful to all
Nations round about us; But also draw on the Wrath of GOD, Who is a Severe
Avenger of the breach of COVENANTS made in His Name; though they be but with
men? Verily, our hearts do tremble to think, and all People in this Land, have
cause to mourn before the LORD, that any have been found among^t us, who have
already fallen into such abominable and fearful defection, contrary to so
Solemn Vows, Especially having so clear and well grounded Testimonies and
Warnings tymously given them, both by State and Kirk, to avoid such Courses.
These that hitherto have been preserved from such falling, would be the more
watchful over their hearts, and take heed, lest they fall, and be not high
minded, but fear. We do not think it necessary to insi^t in guarding the mynds
of People against the Snare of that Argument, Which the Enemies take from the
great success, and series of providence, wherewith their undertakings and
course have been followed* whereby they would dazzle the eyes of the Ignorant
and Simple, this being abundantly dashed in former Papers, and even of it
self evidently absurd, the Word of GOD being so clear for this, and experiences
in all Generations yielding so manyfold examples thereof, That often times in
the LORDS Holy Providence; wicked men, in most wicked courses; even against
GODS own People, may have much prosperity, for a time, for the trial and
humbling of his own, and the greater judgment upon their Enemies, when they
have filled up the measure of their iniquity. Providence are not our Rules,
whereby to judge of the justice, or injustice of a course, But the Law and the
Testimony, if they speak not according to this Word, there is no light in
them, what-so-ever be the successes of men; But we shall exhort every one,
and it will be their wisdom, to watch against and to he aware of the Snares
of such, as by subtle suggestions, and whisperings, labor to alienate the
hearts and affections of People from these that are in public trust in State
and Kirk, and to render all their Resolutions for the public safety
suspicious and odious, the hearkening where unto, is indeed a step unto
Defection, and may readily lead on to down right compliance with the Enemy.

In the next place; We earnestly desire all People to consider, That it is not
enough for them in these times, Not to join or act with, or for these Enemies;
But that they ought also according to the utter most of their power, to act,
and improve them selves against them: And, therefore, we do exhort every one,
in the Fear of GOD, to give all loyal and hearty obedience, unto such
necessary and lawful Orders, and Commands, as are, or shall be emitted by the
Civil Authority, in reference to acting against the said Enemy. If ever
there was People in the world, who had cause to be a willing People to this,
and to bestir them selves, with all their power, to oppose, and defend them
selves, against an Enemy, We certaynlie, the People of this Land, at this
day, have cause to do so, against this present Enemy; Whether we consider the
Enemies what they are, and what is the cause of their Invading, and Persecuting
us; Or whether we consider our Concernments, that are in hazard of their
Designs, and Cruelty; Or whether we consider the Bands and Obligations,
whereby we are tied before GOD, and the World, to mayntayn and defend the same.

For the first, We shall not need to add any new thing to that which was
holden forth by the COMMITTIE of ESSTATES in their answer to the declaration
of the pretended Parliament of England, and the declaration of that army, when
they first entered into this Land, we shall only desire that what was said
there, may be now called to mind, and reviewed, Page 17.18.

For the second, we shall desire all ingenuous, honest, and godly hearts, to
consider these things, 1, How many of our dear brethren, flesh of our flesh,
and bone of our bone, are slain with the sword, innocentlie, and without cause,
and how many carried into Captivity, and therein sterved with hunger or cold,
and sent away as slaves. 2. A great part of our Land subdued, and lying under
their feet, and the LORDS people our brethren there, oppressed, spoiled,
inslaved in their bodies, endangered in their souls, which lie open to the
poison of their pernicious errors, being destitute of the ordinances of GOD,
and their Ministers, who might inform, comfort, and strengthen their hearts in
the LORD, whose distressed condition, and sadd afflictions, cry to us for help
and relieff, and cry to Heaven against us, if we shall lie by, for that woe,
which is pronounced against these that are at case in SION, and remember not
the affliction of Joseph. 3. What these are already suffering, that the same
is threatened against the rest of the Land, and cannot be avoided, if we shall
not tymouslie rise up, and seeking the LORDS help and assistance, faythfullie
and actively make use of that power (which GOD has mercifully in His
providence left yet in our hand) against their violence. 4. Is any thing less
intended, and persued by these men, then the destruction of our King, now in
Covenant with GOD and his people, the utter overturning of our government,
under which we have lived, and subsisted for so many generations, and the
enthralling us and this ancient Kingdom in bondage and slaverie unto them, as
without all which, they conceive they cannot promise security to them selves
in their violent and wicked unparallelled usurpations at home in their native
country? 5. Is not Religion also, and the cause of JESUS CHRIST (which ought
to be dear and more precious unto us, nor any thing or interest worldly under
heaven, and for defense of which our lyves ought not to be dear to us) in
danger of utter subversion and ruin, by these men's cruelty, and impiety?
What they have done in their own country, in the matters of Religion, by
continual obstructing the work of reformation, by crafetie under myninges,
whill it was carrying on, and then at last, breaking it in pieces, when they
had gotten power in their hands, by avowing all sorts of impious and
blasphemous errors, and setting up ane abominable toleration thereof, and now
at last of popery; by oppressing, persecuteing, and casting out honest and
faithful Ministers of CHRIST, for preaching, and speaking against their
errors, injustice, and usurpation, and refusing to approve their usurped
power, Is now so manifest before the world, that none can be ignorant thereof.
And albeit in their invadeing of us, they pretend only to be acting civil
matters, as they say, their liberty and safety, yet certainly, because they
cannot promise themselfs security in their errors, confusions, and impieties
in England, so long as Religion stands inteer in this kingdom, especially so
long as presbyteriall government, which is the hedge of truth, and a terror
to heresies, and Heretics, is keiped up, and our religious League and
Covenant, which binds to the maintenance of Religion, is avowed by any of
these nations, their cruelty and violence will have no rest, if they get way,
until they have overwhelmed us with the same confusions in Religion, which
they have effectuated on the neighbor kingdom, and when Religion is
overthrown, and destroyed, these kingdoms (which GOD avert, and we hope he
shall, for his own glory and Names sake) is it not endangered in all Orthodox
protestant kirks abroad round about us? Who this day are looking at the
standing or falling of it in these kingdoms, as the apparent means of the
standing or falling of it amongst themselfs also. By this brief narration, may
be seen, that which we doubt not but every sensible man does see by him self;
That what so ever can be dear and precious to any people in the world, are all
to us now lying at the stake, and that therefore every one amongst us, as we
would not render our selves reproachful to all nations round about us, and
willingly involve our selves in the greatest miseries that a people can be
brought unto, ought to take their life in their hand, and according to their
stations, places, and power, to be forthcoming to the defense of these things
against unjust violence.

And now in the third place, Let every one of us add to these things, the
consideration of the bonds and obligations, that lie upon us to this duty, by
the Law of GOD, the law of nature, our National Covenant, and Solemn League
and Covenant, and the pains therein contained, whereunto we have devoted our
selves, if we shall desert, or faill in performing that duty, and we think
every sensible heart may tremble to intertayne any thought of lying back from,
or slacking in the duty, being called thereunto by lawful authority.

We doubt not but sundry things may be, and are already suggested to the
people of GOD in this Land, to weaken their hands, and to discowrage their
hearts, in doing their duty, and to obstruct necessary raising and levying of
forces at this time, against which we-desyre all, in the fear of GOD, to arm
and guarde them selves, that they hearken not thereunto, as they would not
bring upon them selves the guilt of all that the Land has already suffered, and
all that it may yet suffer, in Religion, Liberties, Government, the lyves and
estates of people, from that enemy, if they be not with-stood. Certainly we
know nothing which ought to move any to lie back, or to slacken their hands in
any wise.

As to what is suggested by some, for treating with the enemy, rather than
hazard the effusion of more blood, we confess that blood, especially the
blood of GODS People, should be very precious, and rather than the effusion of
it be hazarded, very much damnage in our matters, should be sustained, and
borne with, yea much in outward things quitt and renounced; And we confess
that we should seek peace with all men, as far as is possible, and follow
after it, And if there might be a Treaty with these enemies, even after all
the wrongs they have done in this Land, without wronging Religion, in these
kingdoms, united in Covenant, for mutual defense, and maintenance of
Religion, without making our selves accessorie to all the violence done by them
against Religion, and Government, in England, without falsifying our vows
made to GOD, our Declarations and Treaties, made and emitted before the world,
to maintain the Kings person, just right, and authority, by all lawful and
necessary means, according to the Covenant. In a word, without quyting the
Covenant, and running into the same guiltiness of perfidiousnesse, and
perjurie, that they have run into, we should not be against it, but we leave
it unto all honest and judicious hearts to think if that can be.

But the maine and principal thing, which we perceave may be represented unto,
and may breed scruple in the minds of honest people in the Land, as to acting
at this time, in the way and course agreed upon, and appointed in the publict
resolutions, is, Because of the admission of such to act against the enemy, as
have been formerlie excluded; For removing this scruple from the minds of
these that are honest and godly (who we acknowledge ought to be had in tender
respect) we do desire, first, That the course resolved upon, and the
necessity requyring the same, may be looked upon, and seriously considered,
The resolution is this, That all sensible persons be raised, and permitted to
act against the publict enemy, for defense of the kingdom, excepting such as
are excommunicated, or forefaulted, or knowe^^^e profane, and flagitious, or
have been from the beginning, or continue still, or are at this present time
obstinate enemies to the Cause and Covenant; And provyding that no person get
such power put into their hands, as may be prejudicial to the Cause of GOD:
The necessity of this course is so great and evident, that no man can but see
it, Considering the necessary duty of just defense, against an enemy
intending by violence to destroy our Liberties and Government, and to force us
to quyte and renounce our Covenant, sworn to the most High GOD; And
considering, That our former forces being ruined, a great part of the kingdom
being absolutely under the power of the enemy, It is not possible to raise a
competent power, in warrantable prudence, to oppose the enemy, unless there
by a more general calling footth of people, in parts that are yet free, then
have been before. Now the case being thus, can the calling of such as are
subjects of the kingdom, limited with such exceptions, and provisions, be a
sinful course, or sold any truly godly and honest subjects, withdraw their
necessary concurrence, for the just defense of the kingdom.

For first, It has been through all generations, and is the universal,
uncontroverted practice of all Christian kingdoms and States, approved by the
judgment of the soundest Protestant Divynes, in case of just and necessary
defense, against foreign invasion, to employ all such as are acknowledged
subjects and citizens, in such a way as is not evidentlie destructive to
Religion, and particularly the practice of our own first reformers of this
Kirk, who did receive and admit unto communion of Counsels, and acting
against the Queen Regent, and her faction of Frenches, and others, sundry of
the subjects, who had been before upon her part, opposing the Professors of
the true Religion, then called the Congregation, when as they came to
acknowledge the error of their former course, and were willing to join with
the Congregation in the Cause of GOD.

Secondly, As the law of nature does bynd and obliedge every one, that is a
member of the politic body of a kingdom, or State, to endeavor to the
uttermost of their power, the preservation of the whole, and of the fellow
members, in a just quarrel and cause, against unjust violence, which if they
refuse to do, they are guilty of murder, and treachery against the
Commonwealth: So this same law of nature allows the body, and lays an
obligation upon such as are Rulers, to call for the help and assistance of
every member, as necessity requires, for defense and delyverance of the
body, from destruction (provyding it may be without the undoing of a greater
good, than is the preservation of the body, as it is in the present case and
publict resolution) which if they refuse, or neglect to do, they run them
selves into the same guiltiness, and betray their trust.

Thirdly, The Word of GOD does hold out to us sufficient clear warrant for
this practice: We may find in the book of Judges, That, when upon defection
from the purity of Religion, and the Covenant of GOD, that ancient Kirk was
brought under the oppression of foreign enemies, yet so soon as the LORD, of
His good pleasure, raised up Governors, for their defense and delyverance, the
whole people were raised, and gathered together for that end, and called out
promiscuouslie, not-with-standing a great part of them, no question, had been
in the defection, and it cannot be said, without groundless rashness, that
all such had given convincing evidences of their repentance, nor do we find
that any godly refused to concur with their fellow subjects, or that any of
their Governors are reproved for not excluding from rising in arms, for the
necessary defense, and delyverance of the Land, such as had been in the
defection: But on the contrary, we synd such sadly reproved, and terrible
curses pronounced against them, who came not forth to join in the work, See
Iud: 5. verse. 15.16.17. and 23.2. The like may be seen in the History of the
Kings, and Chronicles, where after defection from Religion, and the Covenant of
GOD, gracious reforming kings arose, and had to do against foreign invasion.
3. We do find in 1. Sam. 11. a clear exemple of this practice, approven of
GOD, and followed with His Blessing, making it succesfull, where Saul, in the
case of Iabesh Gilead, besieged by a foreign enemy, commands all Israel to
come forth, for the desence and delyverie of their brethren, under the pain
of severe civil censure, and accordingly, all being moved by the fear of
GOD, falling upon them, as it is said, They did come forth, as one man; yet as
we may perceive Cap. 10. verse. ultim. many of them (as is apparent a great
faction) were sons of Beliall, wicked and turbulent persons, who as they had
before turbulentlie rejected Samuels government, and required a king; so then
had they opposed the Word, and clear revealed will of GOD, in calling Saul to
the government of his people. Neither is there any thing can be brought in
Scripture, which speaks against this resolution in our present case, to wit,
Of just and necessary defense, against foreign invasion, whereby the whole
Kingdom, Lyves, Liberties, and estates of the people thereof are in danger of
utter ruin.

As for any scruple or doubt, which may be in the mynds of honest and godly
people, against the publict resolution, there may be clear and sufficient
satisfaction unto such as are not wilfully resolved unto the contrary: For,
as to former declarations and publict resolutions, and our solemn
acknowledgement and engagement, made after the unlawful engagement against
England, whereby many are debarred from places of power, and trust, in
counsels and armies, It would be considered, that these things were done in
relation to acting in a way of prosecution of the cause; but were no ways
intended to the prejudice of just and necessary defense of the kingdom
against foreign invasion, for which we are allowed and bound by the law of
nature (which no humane laws or resolutions can infringe or prejudge) to make
use of all subjects in the kingdom, if the making use of them be not sinful
in it self. And to the end it may appear unto all who are scrupled from the
solemn engagement concerning the present publict resolution for acting against
the enemy, That the intention and end of that engagement was no other then
what has been presently said, we do desire it may be remembered that at the
time when that solemn acknowledgement and engagement was a forming and drawing
up, it was represented by some then present that it might be a thing
prejudicial to the kingdoms safety incase of foreign invasion, if so many
were absolutely debarred from taking arms. And it was then answered
publicly, that in such a case, all subjects within the kingdom, might and
ought to rise for the just defense thereof: And therefore in the obligatorie
part of the acknowledgement and engagement in the 6. article thereof, page 12.
which concernerh complying with malignants, nothing is expressed which
imports the bynding up of the hands of the kingdom from employing any that
are acknowledged subjects for the necessary defense thereof, nor is there so
much as any mention of ARMIES made therein at all. These things are well
known, and cannot be forgotten by such as were upon the Commission at that
time. As for any thing that is said in latter declarations, concerning this
matter, even in relation to defense against our invaders, as it stretches
further then the known intentions of our first resolutions; So it is to be
considered, that it was in a time when the whole kingdom was inteere, and
their might be choice made of instruments to act, we confess that in such a
case choice should be made of the best instruments; But the case is altered,
and yet, neither at this time, is it resolved that any shall be employed, that
are profane or continuing in enmity to the Covenant or cause of GOD. As to
what is alleged from the eminent danger, apprehended to follow upon, and
accompany the way resolved upon, because, thereby many being to be employed,
who have formerlie been in opposition, and courses prejudicial to the cause,
It may be feared, that these having gotten power in their hands, cannot but
employ the same according to their own principles, and for establishing their
own ends, destructive to the Work of GOD, In answer to this, We desire it be
considered: 1. Suppose there were some danger in this kind, yet it is not
certain and inevitable; And on the other hand, if necessary help, in it self
not sinful, be not employed, there is certain ruin, from the wickedness and
cruelty of our enemies, both to kingdom and cause, without an extraordinary
divine work, which we have no warrant to look for, neglecting ordinary means.
2. Many of these who have been debarred hitherto, have been formerlie active
and forward for the Covenant and Cause of GOD, have now ackowledged the
sinfulness of their fall from their steadfastnesse, and have bound them selves
to steadfastnesse and faythfulnesse in time coming, by all the bonds that can
be imposed upon men. 3. The reason why many of these did oppose the Cause of
GOD, was their sinful preference of the Kings interest, which was then in
opposition to the Cause; But now, that being removed, and the Kings interest,
and the Cause of GOD being joined, there is not such danger that way.

We acknowledge, that it is all one with GOD, to save with many, or with few,
and that, as it is a great provocation to put trust and confidence in
multitudes, or in the strength of means, so also it is a great sin to be
misbelieving, when GOD in His Providence redacteth us to scarcetie of
secundarie means; yet this is no ground for us to neglect the use of lawful,
necessary, and competent means, when GOD does afford them, such as He has
left, blessed be His Name, to us in this Land yet in some measure; But how a
competent means can be had, no man of understanding can see, without such a
calling forth of the people in these parts of the Land that are yet free from
the oppression of the enemy, as is held forth in the public resolution,
which course being not sinful in it self, and being necessary in the present
case and condition of the kingdom, if any shall stumble thereat, the scandal
is not GIVEN, but taken; And if they do refuse to concur therein, according
to the duty whereunto they are bound, by the law of nature, and the Covenant,
they cannot but highly sin against GOD; Yea, suppose the civil Magistrate
should employ some instruments for defense of the Land, whom they ought not to
employ (which we hope they will not do, and if they should, we would not fail
to testify against them) yet this will be no just ground, nor give warrant to
any godly in the Land, to desert, or lie back from performance of that
necessary duty, which they owe to their native country, in a just cause,
but their part were to go about this with all diligence, mourning for the
sin of the Magistrate.

Therefore, we do again in the Name of the LORD, inform, and exhort all the
people of GOD in this Kirk and kingdom, that in obedience to the lawful
command of Civil Authority, they shall readily, honestly, and cheerfully,
go about all the duties, that relate to our own just defense, That none, in
such an exigent, either through base mynding their own ease, and personal
safety, more than the public safety of the Land, and Cause of GOD, lie
aback, or by the suggestions or whisperings of any, slandering the public
resolution of Kirk and State, obstruct, or retarde the present necessary
Levies, for the Defense of the kingdom, and Cause, or suffer them selves to be
hindered from their duty; But that every one in his station, lay out him
self to the outmost, and neither spare his person, nor pains, nor means, for
the acquyting of him self, and encowraging of others. Our cause is righteous,
what-so-ever it has pleased the LORD in His Holy, Just, and Wise Providence,
to bring upon us, for our sins against His MAJESTY, especially our great
misprysing, and contempt of the glorious Gospel, and of His Son JESUS
CHRIST. We stand for the Defense of our Religion, Lyves, Liberties, Families,
Estates, Country, Government, our lawful King, and his just Authority, in
the Defense of Religion, and every thing that is or can be dear unto any
people, all which are in hazard to be destroyed and ruined by our wicked and
perfidious enemies, if so be we shall not in the LORDS Strength activelie
bestirre our selves, for our just Defense. And now also the sadd and desolate
condition of the City of our solemnities, and the oppressions of all our dear
Brethren, under the feet of the enemy, cry alowd to us, who are bound by
nature, and Covenant, to account the injuries done to them, as if they were
done to our selves; who knows but the LORD who heretofore has not gone out
with our Armies against this enemy, will now return, and have mercy on His
people, and show forth His displeasure against these who are helping forward
the affliction? Certaynlie the measure of their iniquity is filling up, and
their feet shall slide in due time, for the day of vengeance is in the LORDS
heart, and the year of recompense for Zions contraversie, He will not always
contend, nor be angry for ever with His people, nor suffer the rod of the
wicked to rest upon their lot, lest they put forth their hands to wickedness.
Let us arise, and do our duty, trusting IN HIS NAME, and believing the words
of His Prophets; And that our sins may not stand up to separate betwixt us,
and our GOD, let all of us, King, Nobles, Pastors, and people of all ranks,
labor more seriously, and sincerely, to search out our provocations against
GOD, and to be more deeply humbled for the same, to apply the LORD JESUS by
faith, for our peace and reconciliation with GOD, and to power out our souls
before Him, that He may have mercy upon us through JESUS CHRIST. and save us
for His own Names sake. AMEN.

Perth, 14 December, 1650.
Act for censuring such as act, or comply, with the Sectarian Army, now
infesting this Kingdom.
THE Commission of the General Assembly, considering how greevous sin
against GOD, and scandal to Religion, it were, for any of this Kirk and
kingdom, to join, or comply with the Sectarian enemy who having most
injustlie and perfidiouslie invaded this kingdom, have shed so much of the
blood of GODS people, are destroying the Land, and are so wicked enemies to the
Truth of GOD, and work of Reformation; And having heard that some already
have fallen into these sins: Therefore, the Commission, for removing so
greevous scandal, Ordain, that all such as have, or shall join in Arms, or
counsel, with the foresaid enemy, upon the clear notice and evidence
thereof, shall be excommunicate, and all such as shall be found to have
procured protections from the said enemy, execute any orders from them, or
given them intelligence, or have spoken favourablie of them, and to the
advantage of their cause; And all such as shall be found in any other way to
comply with them, shall be censured, according to the degrees of their
compliance, as others have been censured, who have complied with other enemies
of the Covenant, and Cause of GOD, and the Peace of this Kirk and kingdom: And
to the effect all persons may be warned to guard and keep themselves from
being misled, or carried away by any inducement, or tentation, into such
course. It is appointed that this Act be read publicly in all the
Congregations of this Kirk.
