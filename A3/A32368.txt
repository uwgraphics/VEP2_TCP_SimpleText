A PROCLAMATION Commanding all Masters and Owners of Ships to stay for their
Convoy before they put to Sea.
CHARLES R.

WHereas His Majesty out of His Printely Care and Compassion of all His
Subjects Trading by Sea, has for their better Protection and Security,
Ordained and Appointed several Ships of War, to be unto them as Guards and
Convoys through their several Voyages; and yet nevertheless, some persons
neglecting their own safeties, and being desirous to make more then ordinary
haste unto the Foreign Markets, do frequently put to Sea, without staying for
their appointed Convoys; and that either singly, or in such small numbers, that
they very easily, and very often become a Prey to the Turks and Moors, who by
such Advantages are encouraged to hold out, and not to yield to Peace upon
reasonable Terms, to the great Damage of the Kingdom in general, and the utter
ruin of the particular persons thus needlessly exposing themselves: Therefore
for remedy hereof, His Majesty by the Advice of His Privy Council, has thought
fit to Publish this His Royal Proclamation, and does hereby stra^tly Charge and
Command all Masters and Owners of Ships, which are or shall be bound for any
Voyage, for which any Guard or Convoy is or shall be appointed, That they
presume not to depart from the Port, or set out to Sea, without having their
appointed Convoy in Company. And as His Majesty will cause all His Officers to
be severely Punished, if by their Negligence or Default any of His good
Subjects shall be Delayed or Hindered of their Voyages; So His Majesty does
likewise Declare, That if any of His Subjects shall presume to adventure out to
Sea without and before the Appointed Convoy, and shall afterward be taken
Captives, His Majesty will leave them under such their Misfortunes, nor shall
any part of the Charitable Contribution for Redemption of Captives be at any
time hereafter applied to the Relief of such persons, who shall be found to
have Broken and Contemned these His Majesty's Royal Commands: And hereof His
Majesty Requires all His Subjects whom it may concern, to take notice at their
utmost perils.

Given at Our Honor at Hampton Court, the Twenty third day of June, 1681. In
the Three and thirtieth Year of Our Reign.
