THE English Lovers: OR, A GIRL Worth Gold.

BOTH PARTS, So often Acted with General Applause; now newly formed INTO A
ROMANCE.

By the accurate Pen of I. D. Gent.

LONDON, Printed for H. Brom at the Gun in Ivy-lane, 1662.

TO THE Truly Virtuous Lady, The Lady ELIZABETH BLOUNDEL.
Madam.
It Is not the Ambition I have to let the World know how much I honor your
Virtues, that emboldens me to make this present Dedication; but to let You see
that I would in some part correspond with the many obligations, those of Your
Worthy Family, have thrown upon me, which lie like so many burdens upon my
Soul, and make the very Favors themselves a Torment, whilst I behold my self
to have without merit received them, and to be without Abilities Rightly to
acknowledge them.

I cannot I must confess but blush, to bring so poor and unworthy a Gift to
kiss your Ladyships fair Hands: But I know your Generosity will easily find an
excuse for my boldness, and not counterpoise my weak Abilities with your
superexcellent Worth and deserts.

If not Madam, let me make this excuse for my self, That whilst the poorness
of my Fortunes struggle with the gratificatory motions of my Soul; I remain so
oppressed under the weight of those favors, that seem to participate Divinity
whilst conferred without interest, that I should think my self guilty of the
blackest injustice and ingratitude, if should not at least acknowledge those
debts, which I cannot discharge.

This Madam has begot in me that presumption, to lay this piece at your feet,
that I might have opportunity to confess the infinity of those favors I have
received, and to tell both your Ladyship and the whole world that they are
engraven in my heart, with an Indelible Character.

Let your goodness then accept of this poor expression of my thanks, which
however mean in it self, please too look upon, as proceeding from a heart
desires to be grateful, and excuse me if I enter not into a praise of your
Virtues, lest I lessen them. For certainly nothing can proceed worthy so noble
a Person from the Pen of

Madam, Your Ladyships Most unvvorthy, but most obsequious Servant John Dauncey.

TO THE READER.
EVery age has it is several humors and times like men, their sundry
constitutions; That which might be approved of in the blustering Storms of Wars,
when the contentious Drums and Trumpet sound allarms to the field, would seem
harsh and displeasant in the calm, and gentle quiet of a salutiferous Peace,
when the pleasant groves are filled, not with destructive Arms, but the svveet
and vvinning embraces of Lovers.

Yet is there nothing more difficult then in any time to please all men, for in
the serenest calms there are some turbulent Spirits. The World was never nor
ever will be free from Cri^icks; whose envenomed Souls will throw dirt upon
that which only for humor sake they cannot disaprove, what is their arrogance
or folly, they will have counted their judgment; and think themselves wise
enough, if they can but find fault with any thing of another man's.

I cannot doubt but this Book will fall under that Epidemical fate, but if it
do, the Author has the confidence to laugh at such carping Momus's, as shall to
harshly censure it. I confess, I would not willingly have what was my pastime,
prove my disgrace; yet I must arm my self with the same patience, that far more
worthy Authors have been forced to make use of.

If I meet with any ingenious Reader, I know they will be so generous as not to
censure rashly; If with others, they will but make themselves the Subject of my
scorn and laughter, whilst they endeavor to make me so of theirs.

OUr late confused times were much averse

Precise, illiterate Fools that looked a squint
On what had any thing of learning in it;
The Muses hung their heads, for in those days,
Good Bullets were in more request then bays.
But now the tide is turned; sharp wit again,
Good plays, pure fancy, and Romances reign,
And this revived and refined Age
Behold the slighted, long unpractised stage
Enjoy it is ancient Splender; then be kind
To wit, for fear you in short time do find
Dull stupid Ignorance again afright,

And think those worthily deserve the Bay's,
Who wit from ignorance light from darkness raise.

THE ENGLISH LOVERS: Or the Mirror of Constancy.
The first Book.
SCarce had the Sun broken and dissipated the darkness of the preceding stormy
and blustering night, when Sigr. Georgio Spinola (Son to the Ancient Senator,
Francisco Spinola, of whose virtues and greatness few can be ignorant, who
have either heard of Flanders or Ostend) according to his wonted custom, taking
the opportunity of the pleasant coolness of the morning, a happiness and
blessing in those hot and scortching Countries, was walked along the Seacoast
some pretty distance of his Fathers Palace which stood upon the Riviera, and
not much more then six miles from Genoua, a City whose famous and magnificent
structures makes her exalt her head above the proudest in Italy, wherein
diversity of cogitations viewd and admiring where the Rouling Seas which
disturbed by the last nights winds were not yet pacified, he might as the waves
advanced themselves epsy something tumbling and tossing toward the shore, and
by the reflection of the morning beams see somewhat glisten, which yet at first
by reason of the great distance of the object, he rather thought a fancy of his
deluded imagination then any reallity, but at length the force of the waves
driving it nearer, he might easily perceive that it was a man, with a naked
Sword in his hand, whom the cruelty of the Seas had deprived of all hopes or
shelter, but only what the Mast he bestred could afford him; no sooner was
generous Spinola satisfied with the certainty of what he first doubted, but his
magnanimous soul pitying the distress of him he knew not, he with the wings
of compassion flies toward Lizari (for there stood the Palace of his renowned
Ancestors) and with all possible speed manning out a Felucca ventures himself
in person in that rough and boystrous Sea to save the miserable stranger to
whom otherwise no hope of life could be left, whilst either want of strength
longer to sustain himself upon his rouling Barque, must render him a prey to
the merciless Seas, or a more cruel death certainly befall him, if by the
violence of the waves he should be thrown headlong among the sharp and
obdurate Rocks. But the quick speed of of the worthy Spinola prevented his
ruin, for though having arrived him, he found him utterly spent with
endeavoring to keep himself firm upon his skittish, though inanimate
Cowrses, insomuch that his Sword which he at first brandished above his head
with an unexpressible gallantry, growing too weighty for his weak and tired
Arm, hung down in the Sea, as as if it would be revenged on that which would
prove the devourer of its Master, yet he came time enough to see some hopes
that his almost departed spirits might again by some cherishing be revived, and
therefore taking him into his Fellucca, and there disposing his speechless
Corpse with the greatest ease so small a Boat would afford, he now made as much
have to shore as he had before done to Sea, fearing least his goodness should
want the desired effect, and the Gentleman (for so he perceived him to be both
by his air and habit) for want of those Cordials which the shore might supply
him with, yield up his tired spirit; but the stranger whose speechlesnesse
proceeded merely from the benumedness of his senses (having now been three
days in the water) was soon by the warmth of those clothes wherewith the
compassionate Spinola had caused him to be covered, revived, when looking about
and finding himself still at Sea, but not so solitary as before, he amazedly
demanded where he was, and how he came there; to which the courteous Spinola
told him in what manner he had espied him floating upon the Main, withal
freely profering what ever civilities lay in his reach either by his power in
the Country, or otherwise assuring him he should be honored if he would please
to command him; in the mean time desiring that till he should regain that
strength which he must of necessity have lost by being driven up and down the
Ocean, he would accept of what entertainment his Fathers Palace would afford;
for (continued the generous Spinola) though I very well know both by your
countenance and habit that you are an English Man, and am not ignorant of the
great stops that those of your Nation have by their valor and magnanimity put
to the progress of my Fathers glory and fortunes in the Nether-lands, besides
that the intimate friendship between us and his most Potent Catholic Majesty
against whom your Virgin Queen has to the wonder of the World so long and so
prosperously maintained a War, should incite us to a disaffection of you, yet
you shall find I hope that generosity in our spirits, as shall persuade you
that neither envy, affection, nor interest, can sway us to the least forfeiture
of those rules of charity which enjoin us to succor and relieve the distressed,
especially when we find such persons cast into the depth of miseries who least
of all deserved any, in which number said he (making a congue) I doubt not but
you may be enrolled; The English stranger was very much perplexed what answer
to return so much civility which made him for some time silent, till at length
making a due acknowledgment of the vastness of his obligations, protesting
that as by the saving of his life it was indebted to him, so it should be for
ever at his command and service; withal hoping that fortune would in time be
so favorable to him as to put him into a capacity by some personal service to
express the gratitude of his soul, which by words he should never be able to
do; scarce had he finished to speak when the Fellucca came to land, where too
servants stood ready with a Sedan to conduct the English stranger to Spinola's
Palace; whither come, he was immediately carried into one of the most sumptuous
Chambers of it; and sumptuous Chambers there were both for building and
furuiture, as any Court in Europe could boast of; the square of the Palace it
self being supported by one hundred and fifty Pillars of pure Carara Marble,
the Court Yard adorned with four most stately Fountains or Waterworks, and the
Palace every where imbellished by the great number of curious and ancient
Statues.

But neither the stateliness of the place, the great care which was taken of
him whereby he in short time recovered perfect health, nor the daily
conversation of Spinola, who extremely delighted in his company, could at all
divert the English Stranger from his melancholy thoughts, which appeared more
transparent every day then other to great wonder of the worthy Spinola, who
endeavored by all means possible to banish from him his solitary pensiveness
by inventing new sports and pastimes to recreate both his body and mind, but
all his endeavors proved in vain; for the more he strove to make him merry,
the sadder still grew, insomuch that had not gratitude obliged him, he would
have shunned the company of his preserver, as his did that of all others.

Often had the good and generous Spinola desired his unknown Guest to impart
unto him the cause of this his melancholy, but was ever put off with excuses
and desires that he would not put him to the remembrance of so dismal a story,
till at length they two being according to the custom walking in a private
Garden, Spinola more earnestly then ever pressed him to reveal that which could
possess him with so great a trouble and dejection of spirit, protesting that
as he had been instrumental once in the saving of his life, so he would devote
his life or what ever might be more dear to him to procu^^ a remedy for his
solitary disease, for whilst that continued he still seemed dead to him,
promising that in requital he would relate to him the story of his life, which
he would f^nd not to have been free from misfortunes, though perhaps they were
such as were not fit to be weighed in the scale with his.

The stranger endeavored by all means possible to excuse the relation of his
miseries, but being again and again importuned by him to whom he owed his life
as his preserver, he could no longer deny to satisfy the desires of his
generous friend, and therefore retiring into a pleasant Arbor which stood at
the end of the Walks, he thus began.

The Loves of Capt. Goodlake AND MARIANA.
MOst Noble Friend and generous Preserver, when you shall have heard through
how many various changes and chances of fortune I have run, you will think,
considering my age, that every minute of my time (my childhood only excepted)
had been a new and distinct misfortune: My birth you already know to have been
in the Kingdom of England, a Kingdom sufficiently famous throughout all the
World, both for its outward force and inward plenty, which as you say, has
miraculously for so many years maintained a War against the most Potent
Catholic King, and still in all attempts made upon that mighty Monarch gained
the upper hand; but because this Kingdom is besides the annexion of Ireland and
Wales in her self divided into several Shires or Counties, many of which have
formerly been particular Kingdoms; 'twill be convenient to give you an account
of the exact place of my Nativity. Know then noble Sir, that I was borne nigh
unto the famous City of Sarum in the County of Sommerset, in which Shire my
Father enjoyed a yearly Revenue of near fifteen hundred pounds per annum; his
name was Goodlake, my Mothers Seymour, which of the two I must needs confess
is the more noble and ancient name; my Father had besides my self three Sons
and two Daughters, of all which I was the youngest, and so like to enjoy the
least part of my Fathers wealth, though during his life he was not at all
sparing in giving me as liberal education as my Brothers; of whom he took so
great care that he thought it not sufficient to have them endowed with learning
except they were likewise adorned with all qualities necessary to make a
perfect and complete Gentleman, such he thought Fencing, riding the great
Horse, and other active Exercises which might make them fit upon occasion to
serve their Country; nor was he sparing in his cost to learn them Dancing,
singing, and other less useful exercises, as things fitting to distinguish
them from the vulgar.

My Father died about that time that I arrived to seventeen years of age,
leaving me besides those Gentleman-like qualities that might make me fit to
gain a livelihood and honor in foreign Countries, but a small parcel of his
estate, yet such as with moderation I might have lived upon, but it was hard
for me who had been highly bred during my fathers life to conform my self now
to a pension, and so small a one too as threescore Marks a year was, so that
before two years were expired I was indebted twice as much as my annuity came
to, which made me begin to perceive that whilst I took those courses I headlong
pursued my ruin, my debts begun to be daily called for, which if I paid I must
leave my self incapable to subsist, and if not run the hazard of being
imprisoned. Fear of this last made me finding delays to increase the danger,
on a sudden to make a contract with my elder Brother, and to sell him my
annuity, whereby I not only paid my debts but had a considerable sum of money
in my purse with which I was resolved to prove my utmost fortunes.

And hoping that I might have the same good hap which oftentimes befalls younger
Brothers who have nothing but their gentility to maintain them, that is by
gaining the favors of young Ladies whose plentiful portions might better be
given to supply the wants of such persons, whom the ill Laws, or rather the ill
customs of England had made poor, then added to the better fortunes of those
who already abounded with superfluity of worldly riches. I put on a resolution
to cast in my lot among others, and clothing my self in a garb much above my
slender fortunes, by degrees I got into the acquaintance of many Ladies, among
whom I resolved to choose one, both of whose Person and portion I could
approve, and in short time pitched upon the beauteous Mariana, Joint heiress
with her Sister of the great estate of Sir Robert Mollineaux, a Family famous
in the Western parts of England: I confess at first the greatness of her
beauty, parts, and riches did somewhat daunt me, who knew my self so far
beneath her in all. At those words the worthy Spinola interrupted him by saying
noble friend, though by what your self report, I dare believe your estate much
inferior to that of your beauteous Mistress, yet I must needs say that I find
this by that small experience I have had of your conversation, that no Woman
could be possessor of so much virtue, whereof you deserved not to be Patron,
and I seriously protest that were I to be Judge, I durst affirm that for parts
and Person, you merit the greatest Princess in Christendom. The Captain
returned him a civil thanks for his so good an opinion of him, but withal
told him that what he spoke were but Hyperbolies, and far above his merit, but
to continue my sad story, (said he, (which I only relate as an introduction to
a sadder) I being resolved in my former determinations, addressed my self unto
her in the most humble manner, either my learning, Genius, or condition could
furnish me with, but ere I had three times conversed with her, such was the
goodness of her nature, that I found that she who had captivated me, was
become my vassal, nor were my visits more pleasing to me, then they were
acceptable to her; in sum, we past a contract, appointed our day of marriage,
and the place where we should the morning before meet, for she was under the
tuition of a rigid Uncle her Guardian, who would by no means have consented to
match her with a Person of so low and mean an estate as I was of.

Could I tell you, noble fr^end, what inexpressable passions of joy my soul
was possessed with at this happy success! I thought every minute a year, nay an
age, till the prefixed time approached; but alas how soon were my contents
blasted? from what great hope did I on the sudden fall? both our loves and
contract, were by her treacherous Chambermaid discovered to her Uncle, who yet
like a subtle and revengefull Fox concealed his knowledge of it, til at the
very time when I hoped to have met my beloved Mistress at the Woodside, nigh
her Unkles house, I and my two friends who accompanied me, were set upon by
seven Villains, who lay there by his appointment to destroy me; I confess I
was then raw and unexperienced in fights, but the consideration of the
business I went about made me resolute, and I think it would have added to my
courage, had I known the design, as I only thought them Thieves; In short this
storm was soon distipated, for almost at the first my two generous friends
gallantly assisting me, we might behold three of the slaves trampled under the
feet of our Horses, two others wounded, and ready to surrender themselves to
our mercy, whilst their two remaining Companions escaped, and took shelter in
the wood, those two whom we had taken, began with pitiful moanes to beg our
mercy, telling by whom they had been set on, and withal relating the story of
my misfortune. Gods! into what an ecstasy of passion did I fall at their
relation, though their swords could not force me from my Horse, their piercing
words effected it, for I immediately fell into a swound, and my poor Beast
sensible of the weight of my sorrows, seemed likewise to yield and fall with
me, whilst one of my friends guarding the two Prisoners, the other endeavored
to bring me again to life, the other performed, they jointly strove to comfort
me with all the persuasive arguments that either love or friendship could
furnish them with, that there could be no doubt of Mariana's love and constancy
to me, and whilst that endured I had no reason to despair. That her Unkles
violent hatred to me would rather make firm, then abate her love: That if he
kept her immured from my sight, (as it was to be supposed he would do) it would
but set her wits at work how to find means to escape him. That they would
always be as ready as they now had been to venture their lives and fortunes to
accomplish my desires. That therefore I should set my heart at rest, and
consider with them for our present safety, the way to which we all concluded to
be the carrying of our two Prisoners to the next Justice, which we did, and
they without hesitating, confessing what they had before told, were committed
to Goal, but soon after by the power of Mariana's Uncle released, whilst I lay
yet open to his further revenge.

In the mean time I made all possible enquiry (but very privately) after my
Mariana, seeming publicly to disown any intention I ever had of courting her,
and at length found that by the cruelty of her Uncle she was indeed chamber'd
up, and so many spies set upon her, that it was impossible for me either to
visit or convey a letter to her; yet at length by the help of a Lady, who often
used to visit her, I adventured to send her a letter, an answer to which I
three days expected, but instead of that came the following Challenge.

To Mr. Edward Goodlake.
SIR,
That I know you a Gentleman I confess, I should otherwise have taken a more
suitable course to have ere this chastised your boldness in attempting
courtship to a Person so far above your birth and fortunes, yet were you* in
those equal to your fair Mariana, I must let you know that she must and shall
be mine, which since she will not be during your life, your death must make her
so* Meet me therefore (with your second) to morrow morning on the backside of
the East Wood, at least to show that you may make you worthy so noble a Lady.

Hatton.


This unexpected Challenge most extremely surprised me, but I was much more
amazed when I found it subscribed by one of my dearest friends, who had before
assisted me in my former attempt to steal away the fair Mariana, and who very
well knew that I was contracted to her, I began to muse with my self how this
might come about, but the Gentleman that brought it, put me out those dumps by
desiring my speedy answer, which I told him I would find either a friend or a
servant of my own to carry, with which he returned to his friend, and I
immediately went to seek out Mr. Spencer, the other Gentleman whose courage had
saved me from being assasinated by those Villains which Mariana's Uncle had
set by the Woods side to deprive me of my life, but alas! now I expected a
second help from this my worthy friend, (on whom indeed the chief part of my
story will depend) I found him sick of a violent fever, and he altogether
unable to help me, yet such was my passion that I could not refrain to show him
Hatton's Challenge; Heavens! into what extremity of frenzy did he fall into at
the reading it? he in fury leapes out of his Bed, and protests that neither
sickness nor death it self should hinder him from assisting me to revenge such
abominable treachery; Nor could I without the help of his Physician persuade
him to return to his rest, and not go immediately with me to seek out the
perjured Villains, (for so he styled him) but at length overswayed by my
arguments, and by the Physicians: That by it before the next morning he would
absolutely endanger the loss of his life, and then I should not only be
destitute of his help, but likewise loose my dearest friend, he was content to
desist, but withal telling me that she did not doubt but the justness of my
quarrel would make me able of my self to revenge such damned infidelity, that
though he knew Hatton to be sufficiently valiant yet his treachery would
cowardice his soul, and therefore I should not fear to attempt him single,
that he had for many years been an intimate friend of Hatton's, but never knew
him guilty of any falceness till now, which he (as well as I) had the charity
to believe, proceeded rather from the inticements of Mariana's Uncle then his
own spirit, hardly had he finished to speak to me when Hatton stepped into the
Chamber, but seeing me there before him, retired with as much have as he had
entered with, only saying as he past out, that he wondered he had received no
answer from me, which I told him he should not much longer wait for, nor did
he, for immediately I took Pen, Ink, and Paper, and by Spencer's advice, writ
him as follows.

For Mr. George Hatton.
SIR,
THough I am now become your enemy, (for what reasons I know not) yet our
former friendship might have engaged you to have declared in more civil
language, I know not what pretenses you may have to the beauteous Mariana, but
you cannot but know that she is mine by Contract, nor have I (I think) given
you any occasion to believe that I will let what Heaven has bestowed upon me,
be snatched away without indangering of my life, or forcing that Person, be he
who he will that shall treacherously endeavor to deprive me of my only
Happiness; I shall not fail therefore Sir to meet you at the appointed place,
though without a second, for I am unwilling to engage friends in a business in
which none but my self is concerned, though I could wish you would rather
disclaim your unjust pursuit, and let us meet as we used to do, friends.

Goodlake.


This having sealed, I posted away to him by Mr. Spencer's Page, who
immediately returned with an answer, that he was content to meet me single, and
withal brought along with him a Ribband, which we guessed to be the length of
his sword, and I found it to be the just measure of mine. That night Spencer
engaged me by all the loves between us, not to depart from him, till the
morning I went to fight, so we passed away the most part of the night in
discourses of Hatton's baseness, but concluding that the greatness of his
estate had moved Mariana's Uncle to proffer her in marriage to him, and that
her beauty and riches had been the motives to make him accept of the proffer.
In the morning about five a clock I took a solemn leave of my dear friend,
not knowing but it might be the last, (though that misery was reserved to a
more unfortunate hour) who having poured forth his prayers for my good
success, which (says he) I do not doubt will attend the justness of your
cause, bid me adieu, and I fearing least I had overslipped some minutes of the
time, made have to the appointed place, where I found my adversary ready to
receive me, We both without speaking began to strip of our Doublets, and being
now ready to encounter each other, he first broke silence, telling me that if I
would resign up to him my interest in the beauteous Mariana, and set her free
from all promises and contracts, I might live; otherwise his sword should force
her from my heart: to which I replied, That he could not but know that I prized
the enjoyment of my dear Mariana (for mine said I) I will in despite of you
call her) far above my life, and therefore any proposition of parting with her
rather then may dearest blood was vain and irrational, that I might with more
reason persuade him to relinquish pursuit of that to which he had nor could
pretend any right to: To this he made no other reply, but that we came not then
thither to talk but do, and therewith made a desperate pass at me, but it was
my fortune to put by his point, and before he could recover himself to give
him a mortal thrust into the right side, at which he fell, saying no more then
go now and enjoy the price of my blood they Mari-a-na- I must confess I was
sorry when I saw him fall, for I would not willingly have killed kim, hoping he
might yet have been persuaded to desist further pursuit of his love, and have
proved as true a friend as at first he had been, but seeing that his wound was
past remedy, 'twas in vain for me to stay and lament him, but rather study my
own safety, having therefore wrapped his body in his Cloak, I took my Horse
from the hedge where I had tied him, and with all speed galloped to tell
Spencer what I had done, he at first expressed a great deal of sorrow for the
so sudden death of one that was once his friend, but you tell me no more
(says he) then what I expected, and think he deserved, so that we have more
reason to lament his folly then his death, but however (continued he) the
strict Laws lately made against duelling will hardly admit of such defensory
excuses, and though he might fall justly by your sword, yet the power of his
friends will endanger your life, let me therefore advise you to make all
possible speed out of England, and because I know not how your slender fortunes
may have furnished you, let me beg of you to accept this (taking down a little
Cabinet from the Beds head, and giving it me) as token of my love, which if I
live and have the happiness to know where you reside, I shall be most highly
obliged if you admit me to supply farther, otherwise, if I dye I shall dedicate
some of my last breath to the remembrance of our friendship, I could not tell
what to answer to so noble and generous a friend, but distilling some tears
out of grief, that I was forced to depart from him, I let him by those silent
showers know how much I prized his goodness, and that the gratitude of my
soul was greater then my tongue could express, having therefore kissed him
again and again, and poured forth ten thousand Prayers for his health, as he
did for my good success; we sorrowfully bid farewell, and I taking Horse rid
with all speed possible to the Sea Coast, where finding a Ship going with fresh
supplies of provisions to the English-Souldiers in Holland I embarked my self
on her, and in seven days we came to Vlishing, whence I traveled to the Hague,
and there changing my name to Love-ill listed my self a Soldier, to recount
to you Noble Spinola any passages of this war, were but to give you a dark and
blind repetition of a thing which your self already know most perfectly: I
confessed (said Spinola) I have from my Father and other friends, besides some
small experience of my own, received an exact relation of those wars, nor must I
now forget that I have often heard him mention you as a Person, who of all the
English Captains, behaved your self with most courage and nobleness; I
confess (continued Goodlake) I was in a small time of being there, more by the
partial favor of the English General, then any desert of mine, commissioned
Captain of a Foot Comp^ny, and such a Company as had they had a Captain
equal, either in Courage or experience to the meanest of them, might have
performed wonders. But to return to my said story, my dear Mariana sadly
lamented my loss and absence, and would her self, had she not been so
narrowly watched by her Uncle, have adventured to have found me, but yet was
she not by reason of my absence so closely restrained from her liberty as
formerly, so that we found ways, by means of my dear friend Spencer to keep a
correspondence, for the generous Spencer still continued his nobleness to me
in that high degree, that he not only seveveral times sent me supplies of
money, but had expended great sums, and spent his whole stock of Interest at
Court in endeavoring to procure me a pardon from the Queen, but it could not
be blamed, nor would (such was the power of my adversaries friends) ever have
been granted, had not my fortune, and the resolution and courage of my Company,
rather then any personal valor of mine, allotted me to be the first, that upon
storming the Brill, entered the Cittadell, I have (said Spinola interrupting
him) heard many gallant Persons descant upon that action, and they have
generally concluded it an act rather of desperation then prudence, there being
little to be said in justification of it, but only that it prospered; I speak
not this, continued Spinola, of your particular assault, (for that being
pursuant to command, demonstrated you truly valiant) but to the action in
general; It Is very true, (said Goodlake) it was so esteemed by many
understanding Soldiers, but however it might be in it self, sure I am it
proved fortunate to me, for by it I got that pardon, which for so many years
before I had sued for in vain; You may easily imagine my dear friend, that I
had after seven or eight years banishment a great desire to see again my
native Country, but a far greater to see my beloved Mariana (who still for my
sake continued a Virgin) and my dear friend Spencer; I therefore having with
very small entreaty obtained leave of the General, to pass over to England,
imbarqued my self at Rotterdam, and Favente Neptuno arrived in two days at
Dover, where my earnest desire to see my friends, made me stay no longer then I
could provide my self with Horses to post toward them, which diligent care
soon found, and unwearied speed made me the next day in the evening, to arrive
at the House of my generous and noble friend Spencer, where without further
Ceremonies I entered, and surprised him in a sad and serious discourse with his
Sister, and some other Ladies, but little did I think that that grief which I
saw, had overshadowed their visages, did so much concern me, my dear Spencer
immediately came running toward me and embracing and kissing me ten thousand
times congratulated my safe arrival, at length to my Native soil and friends,
but yet me thought that his countenance was somewhat clouded, and not so serene
and complacent as I had formerly known it, besides I observed that there were,
whilst I was renewing (as it were) my friendship with Spencer, strange
whisprings among the Ladies, and that their former bemoanings were turned into
a dumb silence, me thought this boaded something extraordinary but what to
think I could not tell, nor did I at all imagine that it had so nearly
concerned me, till having saluted the Ladies, I desired them to make me
partaker of their sorrows, by knowing the cause of them, alas Sir, said one of
them, our sorrow (if there be any here whose looks or other jesture may make
you deem them sorrowful) is no other then what is caused either by the dullness
of the weather, or some unknown reason which we cannot be sensible of, Alas
Madam, said I, your goodness must pardon me, if I do yet believe, that so
great a dejection of spirit, (as I perceive in this whole company) must
necessarily proceed from some greater occasion then the dullness of the
weather, which to me seems pleasant, unless (said I) I be that unknown reason
from whence it does proceed, and turning thereupon to Mr. Spencer, whose visage
testified more discontent then any other; I told him, that he had not formerly
used to receive me with such a show of grief and sadness, and therefore
desired him to let me know the occasion, for otherwise I should be enforced to
believe that some malicious Person had scandalized me to him, and possessed him
with such things as might make him think I had justly forfeited his former
friendship which if so, I desired to know my crime and accusers, that I might
confess and crave pardon, or right my self; Hereupon with many vows he
protested there was no such thing, that I was as high in his good opinion, and
that he esteemed my friendship as much if not more, as ever that his present
melancholy and dejectedness proceeded from he knew not what inward cause which
had likewise poured its influence upon the whole Company, This though it little
satisfied me, yet I was forced to conform my humor to theirs, for I could not
persuade them from you, and indeed I who had the most reason to be sad knew no
cause for it, till Bedtime being come my dear Spencer accompanying me to my
Chamber, I began more seriously to examine why he who was always wont to be of
a joviall temper, had now so utterly banished mirth from his soul, especially
at my arrival, Oh my dear friend (said he fetching withal a deep sigh) since
I must tell you the cause which I would not do, did I not know you a Person
who could absolutely command your passions; know that the very sight of you
increased my sorrow, for your sake did I first conceive it, and you are the
only Person in the World it most concerns. I was somewhat startled to hear
him say so, and what is it (said I in some passion) can make me so miserable
that you should thus have cause to grieve for me? is Mariana turned inconstant?
and has she now I am come home fraught with full hopes to enjoy her, plighted
her faith unto another? It cannot sure be, oh no, (replied he) she continued
constant to you even to her last; to her last? (said I) and is she then dead?
oh Heavens! what cursed stars was I born under, thus to conspire to make me
miserable for ever? Well Mariana since after so many delays I can^^ot enjoy
thee living, I will follow thee to ^^eath; and therewith drew my sword,
intending to have peirced my bosom, but was hindered by my too pitiful
friend; and what (says he) though Mariana was (whilst living) your only
comfort, what comfort will it be to you to follow her in death, where you can
have no further hopes of conversing, whilst her constant and innocent soul is
fled to Heaven, when yours, blackt with that hideous crime of self murder,
must necessarily be hurried to a blacker region. Live, live, and live, so that
since the fates have denied you to enjoy each other here, you may enjoy eternal
Society hereafter, I could not tell how or what to answer him, but throwing my
self into the Bed, I lay there (and Spencer by me) for he would not trust me
alone lamenting my misery, in such sort, that before morning I had contracted a
most violent burning Fever, which I wished heartily might have carried me to
my grave, and it had answered my hopes (notwithstanding all the care of
Physicians) had not the sweet converse of the generous Spencer been more
effectual then all their Potions, here it was (during my sickness) that he
and I contracted an indissoluble knot of friendship, so firm that nothing but
a most cruel and perverse fate could have ever parted us; Just at those words,
came a servant to acquaint Spinola that a Messenger from the Senate attended to
speak with him, which he desired to do with all speed, the business as he said
being of great importance, He therefore craving excuse of Captain Goodlake for
his forced al^^ sense, with promise immediately to return, we^^ into his Palace
where in the great Hall he found the Messenger attending him, who brought him
not only letters but an express command to repair immediately to Genoua,
having dispatched the Messenger, and perused his letters, he returns into the
Arbor to Captaln Goodlake, whom he finds sitting with his eyes fixed on the
ground according to his accustomary melancholy posture, but raising himself up
at his approach, was about to continue his story when he was stopped by Spinola's
telling him; that at the earnest entreaty of the Mantuan Ambassadors the Duke
and Senate of Genoua had granted one thousand Horse, and two thousand Foot to
the Duke of Mantua to assist him in his present wars against his too potent
enemy the Duke of Ferrara, whereof they had thought fit, for what deserts of
his he knew not to nominate him General, to which charge he was ordered
immediately to repair; That though he durst not presume to desire his Company
in those Wars, yet he would willingly to gain it, could he be dispensed with by
the Senate, surrender to him his place of General, and accompany him in what
inferior rank he should think him worthy of, but since the place of General
was conferred on him by the Senate (who used not to entrust any strangers with
the chief command of their Forces) and could not therefore be disposed of by
him, yet he desired that if his spirit inclined him yet to the Wars, he would
be pleased to accept of being Lieutenant General of his Horse, and next Person
in command to himself; The offer was so generous that Captain Goodlake could
not refuse it, though he would not at first seem to accept it, but rather
desired he might attend him as a private Person till overcome by Spinola's
importunities, he undertook the charge, though as he told him that being a
stranger he could not but expect the envy and hatred of many gallant Persons of
his Nation who might themselves justly aspire to that employment, and think
themselves wronged if a stranger were therein preferred before them; To which
Spinola replied that he doubted not but to find such gallant behavior in him,
as would make him above the envy of the proudest Genouese, Goodlake thanked him
for his good opinion of him, but the business requiring have, they left off
farther complements, and the Captain being furnished with Horse and attendants
by the generous Spinola, they set forward together toward Genoua, but in their
way, and not half a mile from the City, they might see their small Army both
Horse and Foot ready drawn up to attend the coming of their Commander, who
having first well viewed them, and then recommended Goodlake as a Person whom
he had thought fit to appoint their Lieutenant General, and they upon his
commendations received him with great applause, he ordered them to march and
take up their quarters toward the borders of Mantua's Country, and himself in
two days time following them overtook them at Friuli, a little Town in that
Dukes Territory, not ten miles from which between four and five thousand
Savoyards (who were come to the assistance of the Duke of Ferrara, and had by
treachery taken a Castle belonging to the Flaminij a noble Family of the
Mantovess) were encamped, upon these by the advice of Goodlake, the noble
Spinola resolves to give the first assault, and therefore advancing from Friuli
in the dark of the night lodges his Army within a mile of the enemy, intending
about break of day to fall in upon them at unawares, but they having advice by
their Scouts, had drawn out into an advantageous ground ready to receive them,
yet that not at all abated Spinola's courage, but having given the charge of
the right wing of Horse to Goodlake, and of the left to Segr. Alexandro
Iustiniani, himself commanding the body, began the fight about break of day,
which continued doubtful (the Savoyards being more in number then the
Genoveses) for about two hours, till Captain Goodlake first, and after him
Iustiniani having broken both the wings of Horse, the battle clearly showed it
self on the Genoveses side, for Captain Goodlake having left sufficient
numbers to pursue the enemies scattered left wing, and make good what he had
gained with a select party of Horse, came flying to the succor of the noble
Spinola, who was somewhat oppressed, for the Savoy infantry being both more
numerous and better experienced Soldiers then the Genovese had gained ground
of them from the very beginning of the fight, and were now ready to put them to
a total rout, when Captain Goodlake falling into the rear of the enemies
infantry turned the scale so, that those who before were ready to fly were now
pursuers for the Savoyards; Seeing themselves deserted by their own Horse on
both sides, were no longer able to bear the brunt, but confusedly breaking
their ranks, either ran away or yielded themselves to mercy; Yet a small party
of them resolutely maintained the Field till Iustiniani coming in likewise with
a party of Horse, and they now seeing nothing but the visage of ghastly deaths,
presented, threw down their arms, and cried for quarter. Thus was the whole
force of Savoy, which came to the assistance of the Duke of Ferrara, either
totally dispersed or taken Prisoners, and the generous Spinola having loaded
Captain Goodlake and Iustiniani with the honor of that days victory to pursue
his good fortune, immediately advanced with his Army to the Seige of the Castle
of Flaminii, a place accounted almost impregnable both for its situation and
fortification, and won only by the Savoyards golden bullets shot into the purse
of the treacherous Governor, before it he sits down, resolving that if he
could not by force yet by starving he would gain it before he parted, but
gallant Goodlake not approving such delatory proceedings (things natural to
the Italian) with much entreaty persuaded him to play his batteries, though
against the opinion of most Commanders in the Army, who alleged that it was
impossible with Bafilisco's, much less with their small artillery to move those
impenitrable walls, that should they make a breach, yet there was so great a
power in the Castle both of officers Soldiers fled in the late defeat, that
it would be impossible to assault it, or having assaulted to carry it; That
their own numbers within would soon consume them, and give them an easy
victory, but Spinola waved all the reasons of his other Commanders to comply
with the Council of his English Lieutenant General, who used no other argument
to persuade him then that by how much greater the danger, by so much more
glorious would the conquest be, so the Artillery incessantly played upon the
Castle for two days and nights, which not only terrified the Defendants, but
about the evening of the second day made a considerable breach in the wall,
which the next morning Captain Goodlake with a choice party assaulted, and
after two repulses from his resolute enemies entered, and left room for the rest
of the Army to follow him, who rather expected to have ransomed his body to
burial, then to have followed his steps so easily into a place by them thought
impregnable. Here it was that Spinola being received in at the Castle Gates,
began with astonishment to admire Goodlake's valor, and to tell him that
whatever honor the Genoveses had gained by these exploits, ought justly to be
transferred upon him, and therefore desired him to accept of the government of
that Castle which being a frontier, could not be put into more trusty and
valiant hands, but Goodlake taking little notice of his extravagant praises,
(as he called them) desired first to be excused from that employment, as
delighting more in field actions, then to be immured between walls: He then
presented him the Prisoners he had taken in the Castle, desiring his mercy for
them, and that they might have liberty to return to their own Country; to which
Spinola replied, That though it was not the usual custom of the Italians to
be so merciful to their enemies, yet for his sake (whom he found endowed with
as much compassion as valor) he was ready to yield to their release, and
therefore he commanded that they might have liberty to depart; but complements
being passed over, care was taken to refortifie the Garrison, during which time
Spinola received Orders from the Duke of Mantua to lodge there with his Army,
because he had received advice, that the Duke of Savoy was with all speed
raising a second Army to regaine that honor which the first had lost, that he
thought no Men were fitter to combat the second then those who had been
victorious over the first, that for his own Forces he thought them of strength
enough to engage Ferrara's Duke. This idleness, though it displeased Spinola,
robbing him as he thought of some glory, yet was pleasant to him again,
because he had now the oppertunity to desire Goodlake to continue the story of
his misfortunes which he readily assented to; and pursued thus.

The Loves of SPENCER AND The Magnanimous Maid.
MOST noble friend, what I before told you of my self in particular, was only
as an Introduction to the story of a Person whose strange variety of fortunes,
will certainly both delight and afflict you, it is the worthy Spencer, whom
I Am sure you remember to have often heard me mention in the relation of my
private misfortunes, as my dearest friend, a Person he was born of a noble
Family, and enjoyed an estate suitable to his blood, nor were his qualities any
other then such as might make him esstemed by all, his friendship indeed was
the only thing that revived my spirits, which would elce certainly have droopt
for the loss my beloved Mariana, he often protesting that he would be an ^ther
Mariana to me, and that it should be my fault if ever our friendships were
severed or disturbed; who would not have rejoiced in so noble a friend, or who
would not lament the loss of him, oh heavens! the very thoughts of it confound
my senses; (at these words he seemed to be in a great confusion, which made the
generous Spinola desist from interrupting him in breathing forth his passion,
till again recollecting himself he continued) The time of my recovery after my
violent Fever for the loss of my dear Mariana, was at the same instant, that
an Army was levying to make assault upon Fiall, in which (when the thrice noble
Earl of Essex was declared General) many of the Gentry of England listed
themselves as Reformadoes to accompany so gallant and worthy a Person: I have
indeed heard much (said the generous Spinola interrupting him) of the prowess
and valor of that renowned Person, which makes it a riddle both to me, and
indeed to all the World, how he should since by the malice of his enemies be
reduced to so much misfortune, it is very true, continued Goodlake, and I have
often heard the Queen's judgment highly taxed in throwing him so easily from
her favor, but he was then (continued he) in his glory, and accounted so
gallant a pattern for the English youth, both of the Gentry and Nobility to
follow, that they strove to emulate one another who should show himself most
ready to serve him, amongst the rest my noble friend Spencer engaged himself to
wait upon him in this gallant enterprise, and that intimate friendship which we
had now contracted, made me rather choose to quit my command in the low
Countries, then my friend whom I was resolved nothing but death should rob me
of; nor was he conscious of less: eso^utions on his part, but being acquainted
with my determination to accompany him with most affectionate embraces told me,
that he should be by me of all Men most happy, having so faithful and trusty a
friend to be a Spectator and guide of his actions, which would provoke him to
those noble attempts which want of skill and experience might otherwise detain
him from; I returned him a thanks suitable to the honor he did me in those
expressions, withal desiring him that we might make all speed possible to
Plymouth, for there the whole Fleet was to randevouze, least by delay (the
confluence of the Gentry to attend upon the General in this voyage being so
great) we should be deprived of those accomodations, which other wise we might
enjoy, he highly approved my motion, so in three days having provided our
selves of all necessaries fitting, we set forward, but at our arrival at
Plymouth found not the Fleet in so great readiness as we expected, but that we
might have taken more time to have given Conge to our friends and acquaintance,
yet being now there we thought it a vanity to return, least so many Ceremonies
with them might in the end hinder us of our intended voyage, so in that Town we
provided our selves with such lodging as we could get, resolving with patience
to attend the motion of the Fleet, whilst in the mean time the same of a most
beauteous Virgin, who though but of mean Parents, being but a Tanners Daughter
of Somersetshire, and at present Servant at a Tavern in that City) was for her
excellent and most bewitching features, but above all for her sweet and modest
carriage, which seemed to show somewhat of nobleness in her beyond her birth
or present condition, styled the glory of the West) invited us (out of
curiosity to see her) to go and repast our selves one afternoon at her Masters
house, whether the same drew many more Customers then we, I confess at the
first report of her (which was to all Men's seeming given somewhat
extravangantly) I did believe her fair, but not such a wonder of beauty as she
was represented, but when I came to see her, me thought she had somewhat in her
that resembled my dead Mariana, and so far exceeded the report I had heard of
her, that had not the remembrance of her restrained me, I had certainly been
taken with her, but the snare I escaped my dear friend Spencer fell into, for
having by some experience made proof of the sweetness of her disposition,
observed her noble yet modest carriage, he was so passionatly affected with
her, that nothing but enjoyment could satisfy his desires, for they were not
yet come to that pitch of love as to think of marrying one so much beneath him
both in birth and fortunes; You will wonder noble friends that I trouble your
ears with this relation of a Person of so low condition, but when you shall
have heard the full progress of their loves, you will find that which will
both delight and content you; no means, did my dear Spencer leave unassayed
by promises, gifts, courtships, or whatever elce can or might endeare Man to
Woman, to accomplish his desires; but so impregnable did he find the rock of
her chastity, though she seemed likewise to express a very great affection for
him, but that with such a modesty as became her birth and the difference of
their fortunes; In sum, after he had made a tedious trial of her honesty, and
endeavored but all in vain to blast her honor, he resolves with himself to
marry her, and to me imparts his resolutions, I was surprised to hear him speak
so much below himself, and what then said I, will you now leave this glorious
enterprise wherein you have engaged your self, and whereon your eternal honor
may depend to tie your self here at home to a Person so much beneath you in
birth and fortunes, a Tanners Daughter, a Tavern Servant, one who perhaps only
sensible of the passion wherein you burn for her, counterfiets a chastity to
you whilst in this public place she prostitutes her self to others, Do not
(says he in extremity of passion) profane so much goodness, my very soul
tells me she is all virtue, nor can I think but my gifts and promises which I
believe have been greater then any others would tempt her were her spotless
virtue to be corrupted, In sum says he, should the General himself but tell
me she were vicious, I would make him feel the point of my sword, which I shall
as readily draw in defense of her honor, as of my own life; therefore by the
inviolable friendship contracted between us let me beg you to desist, from
further mentioning her birth, or blemishing her fame, for my ears are not
capable of hearing any other sound, then that she is fair and virtuous; to
which I (seeing him so resolute) replied, that what I spoke, was but the advice
of a true and cordial friend, who prized his honor as my own, but since I
found him so absolutely determined in his love to Besse Bridges, (for so was
that fair Maid called) I would not only desist to persuade him from it, but
assist him what I could in it, but withal advising to make some farther trial
of her, and not point blanck to marry her, for he might easily be sensible how
great a blemish it would be to his honor, if she should afterward be found
trainted: He was so rejoiced to hear these comfortable words of mine, (for so
he termed them) that clapping his arms about my neck, and kissing me, oh now
says he, I know thou art my friend indeed, but how is it possible (says he)
that I can make trial of her farther, the Fleet being almost ready to depart,
and no excuse can I in honor make to stay here when they are gone, you must
venture that Sir, (said I) it may be before the departure of the Fleet somewhat
may happen, which may give you occasion both to make trial of her love and
honesty, but little did I think when I spoke those words, that such a fatal
occasion would happen indeed, as there did soon after, for my Spencer
continuing his wonted visits to his beloved Elizabeth, it happened one day that
some Gallants desiring the sight of her, (for as I told you Sir before, 'twas
her same drew Company to the House) and she not being permitted by Spencer to
go to them, they with a boistrous rudeness, not only forced into our room, but
in a most uncivil manner began to abuse her mean birth and present state,
which so enraged her Spencer, that by a desperate thrust he deprived one of
them of the further use of his tongue, for having now used it so lavishly, his
two friends* seeing him fall easily, gave us way to make an escape to our
lodging, which was pretty private, whether being come, Spencer in an excess of
passion throws himself upon the Bed, laments his hard fortune, curses his
stars, and in a desperate manner, would have attempted his own death, had not I
prevented him, yet could not all the arguments I could use, assuage his extreme
grief, for how (says he) can you speak me a word of comfort, who am reduced
to this miserable condition, for my inconsiderate rashness has not only
burdned me with the black stain and guilt of murder, and has laid me open to
an ignominious death, but that which above all grieves me, forces me to lose
the presence of a love so fair, so sweet, so good, so chaste, so virtuous that
the World cannot parallel her, oh Goodlake tell me not then of comfort; Alas
Sir (said I) it is true you have laid your self open to all these
inconveniences, but yet the way shun them or at least remedy them is not this,
immoderate grief, if you stay here the law as you say will very speedily
pursue you, and what comfort will it be for you to see me dye with you, could I
dye for you, I should let the World and you know and see how willingly and
undauntedly I would sacrifice my life for so good a friend, come Sir cheer up
your spirits, there may yet be remedies to all these miseries, fly and secure
your self; Fly and secure my self (said he) why that is my greatest misery
that I must be forced to do so, and leave my love behind me; That may be but
for a short time (said I) remember that others (my self) have been made
subject to the same frowns of adverse fortune, let those arguments of yours
which were too powerful for me to gainsay the flying from my dear Mariana,
now prevail with you, besides (said I) you have now an occasion offered to
make trial of your Loves fidelity, and whether she be worthy those attributes
which you are pleased to give her. And art thou still doubtful of her virtue?
(said he, raising himself from the Bed) thou shall see me make such trial of
her constancy, as shall make thee declare her worthy not only of mine, but of
the love of the greatest Prince in Europe, but alas! (continued he) how do we
feed our selves with fancies? how is it possible that we should either speak
with, or send to her, for that trouble not your self, (said I) but give me
your ring and I will undertake to rid you of that care, he immediately slipped it
of his finger, and I having before sent his Boy for one Mr. Forset, a Gentleman
of whose approved fidelity I had often had experience in the Netherlands, he
just at that instant entered the Chamber, to whom I gave a full relation of our
sad disaster, entreating him first to provide the best Horses he could procure
in the Town, and having left them at an appointed place in the Road to Foy, a
Haven Town in the west of England, where one squadron of our Fleet lay under
the command of that famous Cavalier Sir Walter Rawleigh, to go with that Ring
to Besse Bridges, and acquaint her with that the owner of it expected her at
the place appointed where we would not fail to meet her in the dusk of the
evening which then approached; He performed all things according to our wish,
for when we came thither we found Horses ready both for our selves and our men,
and scarce had we looked upon them, but in came Forset and Besse Bridges laden
with gold, for so noble a spirit had this virtuous Maid far above her birth,
and education, that she did not only desert her Lover in this his extreme
necessity, but likewise brought him fifty pieces out of her own stock (besides
one hundred which he had left in her custody) fearing least (being far from his
Friends and Country) he might be surprised and taken before he could send for
money to facilitate his escape, we left the two Lovers to take their leaves,
which was done with that affection as those who are true Lovers indeed, are
only able to be judges of, and Spencer having returned (her with many applauses
of her fidelity, and vows never to be any others then hers) both her fifty
pound given her the hundred pound she had in custody, consigned over to her his
Trunks with things of very rich value, and allotted her a House in Foy part of
his possessions to live in till his return, but especially recommending his
picture to her which she vowed to keep during her life, and given he^ a strict
charge, that as she had hitherto maintained her self chaste and virtuous in
despite of the scandals, and to the envy of the World, so she would for the
future conserve her honor as a jewel more precious then beauty or riches,
took a sad farewell of her. And we immediately Horsing, rad with all speed
possible to Foy, where we arrived next morning early, just at the nick of time
that the Fleet had order to sail, so immediately getting aboard the Admiral,
we to our thinking bid adieu to the English shore, for longer time then we were
absent from it, for we were by an unhappy accident forced again to visit it
sooner then we thought for, our Squadron having joined with the rest of the
Fleet, had scarce got forty leagues from our beloved Country, when a hideous
and dreadful tempest from the Northwest assailed us with so much fury, that we
were not able to bea^e up our sails against it, whilst a thick and black mist
surrounded us, taking away all light, but what the terrible flashes of
lightning afforded, the Sky with horrible thunder, and the troubled Sea with
boistrous whirling storms beating the billows against the Ship with dreadful
noise, wrought so fearfully for the space of four days, that the very
Mariners themselves were abashed, the Soldiers affrighted, and the Fleet
dispersed, not without very great danger recovered the Coast, where being come,
though others were glad of their safety, yet Spencer grew melancholy, fearing
the danger he was in, should he be discovered, but fortune was so favorable
unto us, that our Ship could not reach Plymouth, so we put into Falmouth the
very uttermost part of England, yet not very far distant from Foy, where
Spencer had enjoined his beloved Besse Bridges to reside in an House of his
own, for no small parcel of his estate lay thereabouts, yet though he was so
nigh he durst not adventure either to go or send to her, least some sinister
accident might discover him (for it was given out that he had deserted the
Fleet and was fled another way) and so his covetise to have but one short sight
of her, might deprive him both of her and his life together, yet she hearing of
the Fleet, being driven back, and that the Ship which only she and Forcet knew,
he was imbarqued upon, was put into Falmouth, not being able to restrain her
passion, was more adventurous then he, but withal cautious, and therefore
recommended to the care of Forcet (whom she knew faithful) a few lines to this
purpose.

The Unworthy Bess Bridges To the worthy and Noble SPENCER.
THough I dare not call that passion which your so often professed affection to
me has made me burn withal, Love, whilst I know such a disparity of our
births and fortunes, yet your obligations to me are so great that they enforce
me to think my self bound to acknowledge it a duty I ow to your worth and
goodness, which no danger or hazard whilst not yours shall restrain me from
tendering; accept but it and the continual Oraisons by me poured up for your
safety, as a token of the gratitude I ow your bounties, and it shall be not
only a satisfaction but a glory to her whose life and death are in your hand
and at your service.


Forcet having received this Letter from her with further instructions what he
should say, fled on the wings of friendship to Falmouth, and in less then a
days time got aboard our Ship; should I tell you (noble Spinola) with what joy
he was received by Spencer, or with what affection he enquired after the health
of his beloved Mistress, you would think I hyperbolized, for it certainly
exceeded all passions that the most in^nared Lover was ever yet sensible of,
but being briefly informed by him of all things to his utmost content, he
addressed himself to return an answer to her Letter, which he did in these
words.

SPENCER, To the Glory of the West.
HOW ever worthy I may seem to you, yet I find my self so much unworthy to be
accounted, so by so much beauty and virtue, that I dare not accept of any such
thing as you style Duty, for I shall never live happy till you change that (to
me) harsh dialect, and call your passion Wit; I find in me to be sincere Love,
which if you will but once profess to preserve with so assured a constancy as
I vow to you, I shall not only think that my Tutelar Angel and Guardian of my
safety, but esteem my self of all men most blessed.


Having recommended this Letter with innumerable loves to his dear Mistress to
Foreet, and taken Conge of him, he retired himself to to his Cabin, and spent
the most part of that night in melancholy cogitations and lamentatitions of
his misery that he was forced to depart from one who so much loved him and was
so much beloved of him; when the next morning those thoughts were broke off by
the noise the Mariners made, which gave him and me notice the Fleet was again
departing, wherefore getting up, we found our selves already under sail with a
prosperous gale, which for some days we were favored with, but being come
into the Bay of Biscaia were the second time encountered with a violent storm,
though not so terrible as the first, yet by it we lost the main yard of our
ship which forced Rawleigh with his Squadron to stay behind the General, and
thereby loose him the opportunity of burning the Spanish Fleet in Faroll, but
having mended our yard, we made all possible speed we could after Essex who had
steered his course to Fiall, but coming there before him, and being distressed
for fresh water, perceiving likewise from aboard ship that the inhabitants were
packing up their goods to fly, and that the Haven was commodious to land in,
without staying longer for the General we landed four miles from the Town, and
having routed a party of Spaniards which came thither to oppose us, we entered
the City, which we found destitute of inhabitants; I should not trouble you Sir
with a relation of this enterprise which was so publicly known, if it were not
to hint to you that this very action did contribute much to the fall of that
Gallant Essex, who being seduced by some evil Counsel as to believe that
Rawleigh had made this attempt only to rob him of his glory, and accused that
he had in contempt of him and his authority broken the discipline war by
landing without the consent of the Commander in chief, which Essex greedy of
glory, and sensible of ambitious mind and ill affection toward him, easily
believed, and though he were one of the three Commanders of the Fleet,
publicly checked him and cashired several Captains his friends and favorites,
whereby he contracted to himself an enemy, who had not the least hand in his
ruin and destruction: This Town we kept near upon two months, Spencer
beginning by action and absence to shake off his Love Melancholy, so that we
jovially passed away the days, till about the time of our departure there
happened an accident which of all but one that I ever felt most afflicted me,
as we were walking together without the walls of the Town, we espied two
Captains earnestly disputing and each challenging the other to have basely
robbed him of his honor got in the skirmish with the Spaniards, when my dear
friend Spencer perceiving that from words, they began to draw their swords, ran
in unto them, and by persuasions endeavored to draw them from such rash
encounters, telling them that before they yet went home they might chance ^^nd
enemies enough to employ their valors on, and not destructively weild their
swords to one another ruin; That that which they ^ccounted courage, was
nothing but a despe^ate folly, fitter to be practiced by Beasts than Men. but
they being deaf to all wholesome persuasions, and not at all giving ear to what
he advised them, began desperately to foine at one another, when Spencer
extending his piety so far, as to endeavor the parting of them, received a
wound (to all our apprehensions) and his own too) mortal; I was en^^raged to
see that he should so suffer for his too much goodness, and was ready to have
revenged ^his wrong, had he not charged me by all ties of friendship to desist
from any such attempt, and withal advised the two Captains to take care of
their own safety, which generous offer of his they (having first expressed
their sorrow, for having unwillingly abused his too noble spirit) accepted, and
left me alone with my (to my best apprehension) dying friend, who I endeavored
by all means to comfort in this his last condition; nor was he of himself
uncomfortlesse, but rather seeming not at all dejected, bid welcome to his
death, which he confessed a just revenge of his having so rashly and suddenly
slain the Gentleman at Plymouth; this was the sum of his discourse to himself
whilst I was busied in binding up his wound, which bled so fast, that I was
fearful that if perchance the wound might happen not to be mortal, yet the too
violent effusion of blood might deprive him of his life, and so it almost had,
for notwithstanding my endeavors (which though they were the utmost I could
do, were but poor in themselves) he was in a manner absolutely fainted away
before I could get any assistance to help me carry him to the town, but at
length before he was quite spent, there came in three or four Soldiers,
running not so much to assist him as to seize me for his murder, for they no
sooner arrived at us, but they began violently to lay hands upon me, so that to
have freed my self from their causeless gripes, I had like to have committed
that upon some of them which I was falsely supposed to have done upon Spencer,
and their rudeness (for so I interpreted that) had assuredly been the cause of
my sending some of them to their eternal mansion, had not one who seemed to
have some influences over the rest, commanded them to desist from further
oppressing me, and withal told me that my opposing my self against their
numbers, would not only prove a piece of desperation rather than valor, but
would likewise increase my guilt; I forced him to stop at that word guilt, for
I wondered I must confess extremely what he meant by it, and therefore
earnestly pressed him to tell me from whence such discourses might proceed;
from whence (said he) can you imagine, but from the death of that Gentleman
(pointing to Spencer;) I was more amazed then before to hear him say so, yet
had less cause; for I now supposed that the two Captains fearing least I
should not be so generous as to make good my Spencers promise to them, and
engagement of me not to reveal them, had resolved (hoping him absolutely dead)
by this stratagem to take away my life, and so the better acq^it themselves; in
which imaginations I had almost broken that tie of friendship wherein Spencer
had bound me not to disclose them, and revealed them as the actors of that
Tragedy, but recollecting my self, and observing that the Gentleman had taken
notice of my discomposure, and still expected what answer I would make to his
charge; I told him, That by what he had said, I might easily guess that they
were come thither to apprehend me for the supposed murder of that Gentleman,
that I was very well content to yield my self his prisoner, though I were
innocent of the least thought of such an action, which without the prosecution
of the Law I should sufficiently demonstrate by putting in execution my resolve
not long to outlive him, That I had yet some hopes that his wound was not
mortal, but that the great effusion of blood had brought him into that weak
condition, out of which some care might perhaps bring him at least for so long
time as that he might clear me, for though (said I) I am resolved to follow him
in death, I would not willingly do it with the aspersion of being his murderer;
and therefore I craved the assistance of some of those that attended him to
carry the body of my dear friend into the town, where we might have the help of
some Surgion, not only to bring him again to those senses which he had lost
with excess of bleeding, but likewise to give judgment upon the wound, and if
pssible effect his cure: The Gentleman very readily assented to what I desired,
and having commanded some of those that were there, to take up the body with
all tenderness possible, and others to guard me (though I told him it was
unnecessary, for I would not fly from the body of my so dear friend, unless
it were to find out some death) we soon reached the town, and as soon after by
the help of a Chyrurgion belonging to a Merchants ship then in the Road, my
dear friend recovered his senses, and lifting up his eyes (not knowing well
where he was) he was a good while silent, till espying me; And art thou there
my dear Goodlake (said he) have the fates been so happy then as to permit me
once again to see thee before I die? then are my joys complete, and I shall
willingly yield my self into the jaws of death, if that cruel Tyrant will but
give me so much time as to lay some commands upon you, which I shall enjoin you
to be true to; these words and his relation that endeavoring to part two
persons strangers to him, he by chance from one of their swords received that
fatal wound, acquitted me in all men's judgments, so the guard was dismissed,
but the Gentleman who commanded them would have stayed longer, had not there at
that instant come in a messenger, who acquainted him that al persons whatsoever
belonging to the Fleet, were by the General commanded immediately to repair to
their several ships upon pain of death, for the Fleet was even ready to set
sail, whereupon having wished me all happiness, and Spencer the recovery of
his health, he took his leave, and I having waited on him forth, and returned
him a due thanks for his civility, made have in again to enjoy alone the
company of my dear friend, whom I found in a manner even ready to give up the
ghost, his faintness having again seized him, yet at sight of me he seemed
somewhat comforted, and rearing himself up in the bed, told me that he had
several commands to lay upon me, which he would conjure me by all the ties of
friendship, by all the obligations he had upon me, by his last dying words
punctually to obey; O Lord! sir, (said I) think not that I have or can have any
power to obey any command whatsoever, except it be to follow you in death; but
why should I talk of death since there is yet hopes that you may live, and I
live happy in the enjoyment of your friendship; flatter not your self (said
he) with any such vain thoughts, for I find death to have even already seized
me, but let me command you live, that since I must die I may rest in peace;
since then (replied I) you think my life necessary to the quiet and rest of
your soul, I shall endeavor to live, if it be but so long as till I fulfilled
your injunctions, which be they what they will, I here protest by those
indissoluble bonds of friendship which have been so often confirmed betwixt us
inviolably to perform; here I stopped, expecting what he would enjoin me, but
he first desired me to take out of his pocket a bundle of Papers wrapped up in a
scroule of parchment, in which says he you will find my last Will and
Testament; I according to his desire took out the bundle and, having found it
out, what is your further command concerning this (said I) That Will (said he I
confirm my last, therein thou will find that I have divided my whole estate
between thee my dear friend, and my beloved Bess Bridges, but with this
proviso, that if thou shall find her in the least tainted, or to have falsified
that faith wherewith she made her self mine, that five hundred pound per annum
which I had resolved to estate her in, let me beg of thee likewise to accept,
and in requital of it to obey these easy commands; First, That thou will
restone this Ring to my beloved Besse, the last pledge she gave me of her
faith, which if she have kept entire, will rejoice her heart, and ease it
somewhat of grief for my death, if not, 'twill be a strong witness against
her to condemn her as the most light, inconftant, and very woman, in the world;
secondly, That if thou-shalt find that she has either broke her faith, or
forfeited her honor, thou will not fail to take from her my picture, which how
unworthy soever, is too good to be enjoyed or breathed on by one unchaste; and
thirdly, that thou would make what have possible thou can to the ship,
least thou lose the opportunity of this passage, and leave me to my fate,
farewell; Farewell? (said I) O ye Heavens! and is Spencer then so unkind as to
command me from him? this command does more afflict me then when he bid me
live; for without his presence I am but dead in my own conceit, but to be
forced from him when he is even ready to render his soul to heaven, is worse
then death! either (said I) command me not from you, or command me not to live:
If (said Spencer) the peace of my mind were not concerned in your absence, I
should be as unwilling to be deprived of you, as you seem willing to be
deprived of you, as you seem willing to die for my sake; but since neither my
dying desires, nor our former ties of friendship can work upon you to leave me,
I must rest content, and as well as I can, pacify my spirits: Nay, now (said
I) you are unjust, if my earnest love made me speak somewhat disgustfull, what
reason have you to blame me? I will go, but who shall then close up your dying
eyes? who shall see you interred? what friend shall weep a tear upon your
funeral hearse? must it be added to the rest of my torments, that I cannot
perform the last duty of a friend to you? for that (said he) trouble not your
self, and ad not your afflictions to the heap of my miseries, you are not the
first that has lost a friend, but the first (replied I) that ever lost so
faithful a friend, farewell, for I cannot stay here and obey your commands,
farewell; that word parted us, for since his injunctions were so absolute, I
thought it would but ad to his grief, and perhaps hasten his death to stay
longer, so having with a heavy heart given the Surgion charge of him, and left
him a sufficient number of crowns, I hastened on shipboard, having no desire
now to live, but to obey his commands; being arrived on shipboard and under
sail, we might hear the Great Bell of the City toul, which was as it were a
sad Omen of that news I after heard, and which made me inquisitive into the
cause of some Mariners, who having staid too late, pursued the Fleet in a swift
Fellucca, at length overtook us, who told me what my own fears predicted, that
it was for one Spencer a Gentleman, and well known in the Fleet, who was just
at their leaving the town, dead of a mortal wound; all these circumstances
confirmed it was my dear friend, nor could I refrain so much my passions, but
that overwhelmed with grief, I fell down upon the Deck, and had not the great
care of my friends and acquaintance again revived me, I had been made incapable
of ever performing the injunctions of my dead friend, yet what with their
persuasions and the comfort I had of having some service to perform to his
memory, I assuaged my grief, and began to bethink my self how I might
carefully observe his commands, they were outwardly easy, but whosoever
considers how close women are in their actions, will judge it a hard task to
prove them unchaste, yet at length I bethought my self that Mr. Forcet the
person who assisted us in our escape from Plymouth, might very possibly give me
an account of the since carriage and deportment of Bess Bridges; he having
expressed to me his intention of residing at Foy, where this Magnanimous Maid
(for so when you have heard her gallant deportment, you will think her worthy
to be called) was by her lover enjoined to live; to him therefore at my arrival
(which was after a very short and prosperous voyage) I addressed my self, and
easily persuaded him to give me the following Relation.

The Continuation of the STORY OF THE Magnanimous Maid.
COuld I dear friend (said he) summon up all those rhetorical Epithites, which
have by the most famous and renowned wits been given to virtue or chastity, I
might undertake before I entered into a story of her carriage and demenour since
your absence, and the absence of your worthy friend Spencer, to give you a
character of this unparaleld Maid, but since that is impossible for me, i will
give you leave to judge by her actions how much she deserves applause above the
thought of Man or reach of eloquence; No sooner had she recovered from the
swound which she fell into at parting from her beloved Spencer, but she began
to repeat what he had left her in charge, and first said she virtue and
chastity, did then my Spencer doubt or mistrust me, oh no, 'twas love, 'twas
love, and care of me (said she correcting her self) that made him give me that
counsel, else why should he be so auxious and careful for my being, and
surely would have been so for my wel-being, my living chaste and virtuous, had
it been in his power, to me then that remains which when I forgo, or make
forfeite of my honor or faith to him plighted, let me not be thought unworthy
of my Spencer, but to live upon the Earth, here she began again to lament her
misfortune, which had made her so miserable as to be deprived of her Spencer,
when she had but just been made sensible of his ardent love and affection to
her, and had assuredly fell into a second swound, had not I endeavored by all
possible arguments to comfort her, and divert those thoughts, by putting her in
mind of his charge, for her speedy removal to Foy, which she delayed no longer
then the succeeding day, when making even accounts with her Master, and taking
care to pack up those goods which were left her by Master Spencer, (but
especially taking care to preserve his picture, which she kissed ten thousand
times, with as much affection as if it had not been the dull representation,
but her real living love,) she in very few days removed from Plymouth, and in
as few more was settled at the Windmill in Foy, whither her same spread all over
England, drew her such custom that she was the envy of all those of her Trade,
I wonder (said Spinola interrupting his valiant Lord General) that Master
Spencer being so much inamoured of her beauty and virtues, having an estate so
great, and being a Gentleman of such quality, did not rather provide a private
appartment, or habitation like a Gentlewoman, or at least a Person he thought
worthy his affection, rather then expose her again to the public temptation of
the World: (Your Objection answered) Captain Goodlake is no more then what I
expected, and what I my self had very often made to himself, but could never
get any farther reason of that action from him, then that thereby he should
make the greater trial of her virtues: but in my judgment (replied Spinola)
the trial was too hazardous of a Person whom he so entirely affected; You say
true, (said Goodlake) but there is no disputing the reasons of past actions,
especially such as spring from the private bosoms of particular Personages,
but (continued he) to proceed in Forset's relation, amongst these many Guests
(said he) there could not want some who would prove Suitors to such an
excellent face, especially when they perceived that it was likewise embellished
with virtue, and that set forth by no despicable estate, which the stock left
her by Master Spencer had in small time acquire, amongst the rest there was one
Master Hopton, a Gentleman of a very good Family, and great revenue in that
Country, who for a long time labored in her love, nor was he wanting to
endeavor to force her to an acceptance of such presents as he would daily
send, but such was the nobleness of her mind, that she would not accept of the
price, where she could not make good the bargain expected, love, Nay so
generous was she, that (contrary to the common humor of that Sex, who love not
only to have many Suitors, but to lull them still on in hopes of their desires)
she not permitting the poor Gentleman to languish in vain expectations of what
he could never obtain, he had no sooner discovered his passion, but she plainly
told him, that her love was not hers to give, being already disposed to one,
with whom should she break her faith, she had just reason to suspect she should
not only be abhorred by all Persons whatsoever, but especially by him who so
earnestly solicited her to it, yet this answer did not at all satisfy my young
Gallant, who with no less eagerness then before still pursued his suite, till
finding by her continual repulses there was left no hopes of victory, he
resolved upon travel, as the fittest cure for his lovesick mind, should I
(said Forset) give you a particular account of all her Suitors, I should make
the relation tedious, and spend as much time in it, as there was spent in their
several actions, I shall therefore only particularize two more.

But as Captain Goodlake was going forward in this story came a Messenger in,
whose countenance betrayed the have of what he had to deliver, yet so much
breath had he lost by his violent running, mixed with fear, that a good while
it was before the illustrious Spinola could make him deliver his message, which
at length they understood to be caused by a sudden incursion of about five
thousand Savoyards upon the Camp, for the Duke of Savoy incensed at the last
defeat of his Forces, had with all possible speed raised another Army, and
commanded them to march night and day, till they revenged their rout, and
regained the honor lost by their Countrymen, these express Orders joined with
the vigilance of their General made them fly with such speed that they even
like Caesar outwent the report of their coming, and (still in their way
recruting themselves with such as either fled from the other Battle, or whom
the charity of Spinola, at Captain Goodlake's request had released at the storm
of the Castle) they were come within view of the Genovese Camp before they had
(such was their security, and the negligence of the Scouts) any notice or
advice of their coming, which sudden surprise had so much disordered them,
that without speedy help they must necessarily fall into an inevitable ruin,
this news extremely stratled the two valiant Captains, but not at all abated
their wonted courage, nor lessened in them the care to assist their distressed
Camp, wherefore Spinola drawing out a selected party of Foot out of the
Garrison, and Goodlake the like of Horse, they seemed to fly to the assistance
of their friends, spurred on not only by their own innate valor, but by the
earnest desire they had still to maintain, and keep alive that honor, which by
the last Campagna they had so happily given birth to; Scarce were they come
within sight of their almost scattered Troops, but their Soldiers having
advice that their Generals were posting to their relief, began to encourage
their fellows, and gathering together into several close battalious, first put
a stand, to the pursuing fury of the Savoyards, this unexpected sight made
their Commanders spur on more eagerly to the relief of those Soldiers, who so
valiantly maintained their grounds and their Countries honor, whilst the
Savoyards angry to see a stop put to their full hopes, and almost assurance of
an absolute victory, pressed with more fury upon their Enemies, whose present
valor they accounted but like the blaze of a dying Taper before its
extinction, and indeed so it had proved, (notwithstanding the great care and
valor of Iustiniano, who resolutely adventured his Person amongst the thickest
and most daring of his enemies, thereby to double the courage of his almost
wearied Soldiers) had not Spinola and Goodlake come in with their opportune
assistance, the first that arrived was Goodlake, who having wheeled about, fell
into the Enemies Flank with such a brave resolution, that at the first charge
he put them into disorder, but such was their courage that (notwithstanding his
advantage here, and that Spinola with his fresh supply of gallant infantry the
Savoyards were forced to give some ground) spurred on with their confidence of
victory that rather renewing then abating their fury, they continued the
battle till the darkness of the night parted both Armies, and forced them to
an unvoluntary retreat on both sides, the Genoveses being forced
notwithstanding their gallant resistance, to yield so much of the victory to
their enemies as to give them leave to pass freely into the Territory of the
Duke of Mantua, and join with the Ferrarian Forces, which more grieved the
generous Spinola, valiant Goodlake, and the noble Iustinino, then the wounds
they had received in the battle, but finding it in vain to repine at their ill
fortune, they thought it fitter to retire to the Castle to consult of Deeds
then to rest there by helpless words to bemoane their ill success.

THE END Of the First Part of the First Book.
THE ENGLISH LOVERS: A ROMANCE.
The Second Book.
STrange was the passion that possessed the generous Spinola for the last days
oversight, and willingly would he have thrown by all thoughts of redressing it,
to have prosecuted his revenge on those by whose neglect it sprung, had not
Goodlake persuaded him that it was now no time to think of punishments, but
rather to consult of some means to redeem not the loss of honor, for he was
sensible of no such thing, whilst though the enemy had gained the pass, they
yet stood upon equal terms with them, but the regaining the advantage they had
got, which might by a speedy pursuit easily be done, and they yet either driven
out of the Mantouse Territories, or utterly cut off; that the whole Army seemed
to him guilty of the yesterdays neglect, and though some might seem more
concerned then others, and according to the strict rule of Martial discipline,
might deserve a severe punishment: yet in this pinch of necessary service
required from them, it would seem a great deal better to pass it by, they now
wanting rather encouragements to spur them on, then punishments of some few, to
damp the courage of the rest. That he might easily discern by the Armies
courage, and resolute endeavors by force, to regain what by want of care they
had lost, that they were so really sorry for their negligence, that they were
willing to expiate that crime with their bloods. That therefore he should lay
aside all thoughts of rigor, and (only by some words making them ashamed of
their fault) by a free pardon beget in them in a desire of amendment. Though
the worthy Spinola was very sensible that this advice of his Lieutenant
Generals was most seasonable, yet whether swayed by his passion, or out of
inbred hate to that family, he would not rest satisfied till a Captain of the
house of the Grimaldi's (who having that night the charge of the watch, was
therefore thought most culpable) was called to answer the surprise, and
assuredly his death had only sufficed to expiate his neglect, had not those
great services he had often performed, the murmurs of the Soldiers, and
Goodlakes persuasions, overswaied Spinola's intentions, who finding that his
death would probably breed a mutiny, or worse discontents in the Army, though
it would better suit with his honor and Grandezza, to give that life freely,
which he could not take away with safety, and therefore having first at large
laid down the penalties due to those neglects, whereof he had confessed himself
guilty; he concluded, that though the world might very well believe that the
enmities between their families, might make him rejoice at so just an occasion
offered, to take away the life of one of the Grimaldi's yet no thoughts of
private enmity, or revenge, could restrain him from giving due honor and
respect to his very enemies, that his former services sounded so loud in his
ears, that for their sake he was content to remit the present forfeit of his
life, not doubting but he would by future services so redeem the fault, that
his Country should think him deserving of the pardon. The Captain returned him
a thankful answer, but in such doubtful terms, that he might easily guess that
he thought his life more due to the love of the Soldiery, then to Spinola's
curtefie, concluding his Speech more clearly, by telling him, that he hoped his
Country should never have occasion to think either him, or any of his Family,
unworthy of life, whilst though they never had the happiness to arrive to that
height of command, which some of other Familes, perhaps less worthy, had been
entrusted with; yet none should be more ready then they to sacrifice their
utmost abilities to its service.

Spinola, though he knew these words were levelled at him, yet so brideled his
passion, that returning him no other answer, then that he did not doubt but the
Duke and Senate were well satisfied with the worth of those whom they employed,
that though they could not advance every man who deserved it to a supreme
command, yet their favor would shine no less clear upon that Captain, who
faithfully discharged his trust as upon their General himself; that it argued
some thing of self-guiltiness, at least selfconceit, to arrogate to ones self a
reward of imagined merits; that for his, he wished they might prove so clear,
that the Senate might think him fit to confer upon him the Generalship of their
Army, which when so, he should willingly resign it; and therewith dismissing
him to his charge, he gave order that the Army should immediately be put in a
posture to pursue their enemy, and if possibly, hinder their conjunction with
the Forces of Ferrara; his commands were immediately obeyed, and the whole body
both of horse and foot were in very few hours upon their march after their
foes, but with very small hopes of reaching them, for finding their Army
extremely broken, they adventured not to stand another shock, but in the dead
of the night were marched away with an incredible speed, intending to join with
the Duke of Ferrara, who then with a potent Army faced the Mantouese; their
flight more animated the generous Spinola, and his whole Army, who now looking
upon then as conquered, and pursued, fied with the wings of revenge to arrive
at an easy slaughter; but they were deceived in their expectations, for after
two days march, they had advice that the enemies Army, being increased with the
addition of two thousand Ferrareses, was turning back to encounter them; nor
long had they received this news, but a messenger arrived, who all bloody and
trembling, related to them the cause of their enemies advance toward them,
which they were before almost incredible of, his very countenance betrayed the
ill news he brought, nor need Spinola ask him what it was, for with a kind of
stammering he began to tell him, That the Armies of the two Dukes having
several days faced each other, the soldiers of either side by continual
skirmishes still provoking their enemies to the battle, at length by a joint
consent, drew out their forces, and on the spacious plains of Miraneula, began
so terrible a battle, that the Sun, though but newly risen from his warry bed,
not daring to look upon such ghastly deaths as each side strove to give the
other, crowded himself under the blackest and most dismal clouds, whilst the
two hosts with various fortune disputed the victory, till about the time when
the Sun having arrived to his greatest height, began again to decline; Fortune
seemed most to favor us, for the right wing of the enemy was absolutely
defeated, and their main battle began to give ground, so that we were in a
manner assured of victory; our shouts of joy ecchoing our confidence to the
skies, but alas! Fortune did only flatter us, for what we gained on one side,
we lost on the other, for our right wing began apparently to give ground, and
by the valor of one sole stranger was in a manner defeated. Gods! with what fury
did he pierce our Squadrons? his victorious sword like an overthrowing
thunderbolt tumbling down all before it? how did he make our greatest spirits
bow, as if death and destruction had been entailed on his arm, yet could not
touch his body? In sum, notwithstanding the valiant Lorenzo posted with a fresh
supply of horse, to the assistance of our all-most scattered wing, as if his
indefatigable arm knew no weariness, he flew like lightning amongst our bravest
troops, and seconded by a select party (and who would refuse to follow so
gallant a Commander?) quickly forced them to accompany their before-wearied
fellows in a shameful flight. This success put a new courage into their Main
battle, so that again regaining their ground, they maintained a sharp fight
with us, yet something doubtful, till the valiant stranger, having left
sufficient numbers to pursue our defeated right wing, attacqued us with his
Troops, which struck such a pannick fear into the coward heart of our soldiers,
that if hell with all its terrors had affaulted them, it could not more have
appaled their dastard spirits; for as if they knew no resistance for his
victorious arm, they immediately threw down their Arms, and with al^speed fled
toward Mirandola; the victorious enemy spurred on by revenge, still pursuing
and sacrificing to Bellona thousands of their coward-souls.

Captain Goodlake all the while the messenger was making this relation, was
meditating who this mirror of courage should be, and no longer able to restrain
his desire of knowing him, here interrupted him, by demanding if he knew of
what Country the valiant stranger was? Sir, answered the messenger, I know him
no farther then by the effects of his valor, which were so prodigious, that it
makes me believe those which I formerly thought fables of the ancient Hero's
might be truths, and that some of their noble souls might be transmugrated into
this man's body; Heavens how did our best Commanders yield up their souls when
ever his sword was pleased to command them; the valiant Lorenzo that famous
soldier, Petruchio, Horatio, Alonzo, and the too young and too valiant
Schiarra, were all made dead Trophies of his living valor. And is Schiarra then
dead? said Spinola, interrupting him; he is, said the messenger, and with him
dead all our hopes of courage, or goodness. He was indeed a person (said
Spinola, turning to Captain Goodlake) to whom the graces seemed to strive,
which should be most prodigal of their bounties, a youth beloved both of Gods
and men, affable, courteous, noble, generous, valiant, and no way deserving so
hard a fate; but how did the noble Duke escape, said he to the messenger, or is
he dead? or rather fallen into the hands of his triumphantenemies, tell us,
that we may hear all our miseries together? The Gods have yet preserved the
noble Duke, replied the messenger, yet to try the fortune of another day, if
he can but again rally up his scattered forces, which we have some hopes may be
done, for as yet the whole left wing of our horse remains entire, who only now
watch an opportunity to join again to the rest of his scattered Army; and
though the slaughter was great on our side, yet was not the victory cheap on
the enemies, for the greatest part of their right wing was cut off, or taken
prisoners, and no small number fell in their Main battle; our Musters at
present in Mirandola amounnt to about seven thousand foot, and two thousand
horse, so that were your Army joined with ours, and our left wing come up, we
might presume, notwithstanding their conjunction with the Savoyards, again to
take the field.

At these words there came in one of the Scouts to acquaint the General that
the Savoyards, strengthened with two thousand Ferrarese, were now within three
leagues of him, and made all possible speed to arrive him before night,
whereupon laying aside all other affairs, he immediately called a Counsel of
War, to consult what was fittest to be done, some advised that the best course
was to make a swift retreat to the Castle of the Flaminii, and there strongly
encamp themselves till they could get relief, it being impossible that with
half the number of their enemies (for they were no more) they should be able to
stand out an encounter; but both the generous Spinola, and Captain Goodlake,
were of a contrary judgment, and rather inclined to fight them, which opinion
of theirs being seconded by the valiant soldiery, who filled the skies with
loud exclamations, that they would never fly them were they thrice as many,
that they would never doubt of victory, whilst their valiant General, and
Lieutenant General were with them, and that therefore they should not stay
their coming, but advance; these Echoes, I say, of the soldiers, to the votes
of Spinola, and Goodlake, made those who before were for a retreat, quickly
change their minds and consent to a battle; so the Army dislodged, and about
the time that the Sun had made two hours descent toward the Western Ocean,
attacqued their enemies, who confident in their numbers, and looking upon this
encounter of the Genoueses as an act rather of fury and desperation, then
wisdom and valor, assured themselves of an absolute victory, and had already
divided among themselves the Genouese Nobles, and proportioned their Ransoms;
but had they not been so confident of a conquest, they might perhaps have
conquered, whilst their thoughts of its certainty utterly lost it, for both
the Commanders and common Soldiers, assured in their numbers, neglecting their
orders, ran themselves into inevitable ruin, which yet they perceived not till
they saw themselves utterly deserted by their horse, (whom the valiant Goodlake
on the one side, and the Illustrious Pallavicini on the other, (for the gallant
Iustiniano lost his life at the first charge) had utterly routed) when the main
body of Infantry drew up closer together, resolving either to gain the victory,
or to sell their lives at a dear rate, in recompense of their folly; this last
indeed they effected, for they maintained the fight till near Sunset, though
galled on both sides by the enemies horse, with an infinite slaughter of their
enemies, to whose swords they were no less made sacrifices, till at length
wearied out, and hemmed in on all sides, tow thousand three hundred, the
remains of four thousand Infantry, yielded themselves to the mercy of the
Conquerors.

This Victory put the Mantuan affairs again into a gallant posture, the news of
it much rejoiced the Duke, who was then anew completing his before-broken Army
at Mirandola; but more was he rejoiced at the arrival of the generous Spinola
there, whom he received withal imaginable pomp and splendour, and he having
first presented the prisoners taken in the last conflict, next recommended unto
him his valiant Lieutenant General Goodlake, as a person to whom, though a
stranger, he ought all his present happiness; the Duke amazed at his great
Obligations, to one whom he had never yet seen, immediately sent for him, and
he as readily obeyed his summons; when being come into the presence, where the
Duke sat in his Chair of Estate, having made his obeisance, he kneeled down,
but his Highness not permitting that Ceremony, fit only for Subjects, to one
to whom he acknowledged himself beholding both for his life and Dukedom, rising
from his Chair, and taking him into his embraces, told him, that he understood
by the generous Spinola, that he was the person to whose gallantry he was
indebted for all his good Fortunes, that his Obligations were so much the
greater by how much they proceeded from a person whom he had no way obliged;
that for the future, he would endeavor with all possible address to quit the
score of his debts, which were so many and so great, that it was impossible
that a short time should find out a proportionable recompense; that he would
therefore make it his future study, and that now he did not doubt to vie Forces
and valor to his enemy of Ferrara, since as well as he had a Stranger, and a
valiant Stranger to be his Champion. Captain Goodlake endeavored to return a
suitable answer to his over-civil reception of him (for so he styled it) by
telling him that the Noble Spinola had wronged both himself and him, the first
by robbing himself of that honor which was only due to his worth, and the
second by attributing to him things far above his deserts; that if he had done
any acceptable service to his Highness, 'twas sufficiently recompensed in being
accepted, and that he should always account it the greatest honor could accrue
to him to spend his life in so just a cause as his. Many complements of the
like nature passed till such time as the Duke thought it fit time to conduct
these two gallant Commanders to their appartment, which he did himself in
person, leaving them into a room richly hung with Arras, and fit for the
entertainment of so Noble Guests, where leaving them alone; Captain Goodlake
perceived that a strange and unusual melancholy had seized upon the worthy
Spinola, and that he whose comportment used to be always pleasant and
Debonaire, was now dull and heavy, he would not presently trouble him to demand
the reason of it, hoping it was but some sudden fit which soon would be past
over, but finding it to continue, and rather augment then decrease, he
interrupted his fixed cogitations, by telling him, That he was not sensible of
any accident which had happened, which might deserve of him so great a
dejection, or if there were, that he could not but imagine that his friendship
to him was lessened, whilst he kept from him the cause of his sorrow, who had
made him partaker of all his griefs. The Noble Spinola at these words awaked as
it were out of a dream, looking steadfastly upon him, replied; My griefs are
now, dear friend, made in some measure parralel with thine, for I have lost a
friend whom I prized above my very soul, my dear friend Schiarra. Schiarra,
replied Goodlake, was that generous youth whom the messenger, who brought us
advice of the Dukes defeat, reported to be slain by the hands of the Stranger,
who in Ferrura's cause performed such wonders, so much your friend as to
deserve such sorrow? Our friendship, replied Spinola, was so firm, that nothing
but death and envious fate could have separated, or broken it. I confess, said
Goodlake, I perceived at the first relation of the news, that your countenance
strangely altered, though I could not then guess the cause of it; but since you
have been pleased to make me, I know not whether I may say happy or unhappy in
its knowledge, let me further conjure you by those noble favors you have
already done me, to give a relation of that person, for I know he must have
been one in all things worthy, who could from you merit so entire a friendship.
Though it will but be a renewing of the memory of my sorrows, replied Spinola,
I have been so much obliged to you for the relation of your own, and some part
of the Fortunes of the generous Spencer, that I cannot deny you this request,
and perhaps it may prove a disburdner of my sorrows to impart them.

The Loves of Schiarra and Florelia.
KNow then noble friend (continued Spinola) that when I arrived to about the
third Luster, my Uncle Ambrogio Spinola, to whose care I was committed by my
Father during his absence in the Netherlands, thought me at an age fit to
entrust me with the sight of other Countries, as looking upon travel as the
enlivener of the soul, and stirrer up of generous minds to an emulation of
other virtues, and because the glory and splendour of Florence (by reason of the
absolute Government of the Medici Dukes of Tuscany) seemed to exceed that of
all other Italian Cities, he sent me thither, recommanding me to Signor Alonzo
Schiarra, an ancient Nobleman of that City, and both a great friend of, and
somewhat alied unto those of our Family; I was received by him with all
possible expressions of Love and Affection, with protestations of having the
same care of me that he would have of his own and only Son Giorgio Schiarra, a
youth of about twelve years of age, of a sweet and affable nature, comely
carriage and behavior, and with all exceeding beautiful, with him I associated
my self in learning those excercises of riding, fencing, and other qualities
and studies which the Nobility of Italy do most delight in, and generally breed
up their sons, to the better to enable them when they should arrive at riper
years to serve their Country; such was the delight that we took in each others
company, and so did our friendship flourish in those our tender years, that it
grew up as it were to an inviolable bond, to the great delight of the old
Alonzo, who gloried to see how we strove more and more to endear our selves
together, and yet would endeavor to exceed each other in duty and respect to
him, so that he would often say, that if we had but both been his children, no
Father could have boasted a happiness like his; thus we lived together for
about three years, and upwards, never parting by our good wills neither night
nor day, or if by any chance we were for some time forced to be asunder, that
time was either spent in dull melancholy, or in pouring forth prayers for each
others safety; but whilst we thus lived in all bliss and content imaginable,
adverse Fortune renewed an old Feud, which had long lain asleep between the
Families of the Schiarri and the Donati, a Family observed to be most guilty
(though they had least cause) of pride of any one in Florence; the occasion of
the raking up the embers of this long concealed fire, were so slight, that they
are not worth relating, let it suffice that it soon grew into such a flame, as
disturbed the whole City of Florence, and many murders were committed on both
sides, Almerigho Donati, son to Lorenzo Donati, one of the chief of that
Family, was the first that felt the fury of this difference by the loss of his
life, which was too soon revenged upon Giovanni Schiarra, a youth in whom all
Nobleness flowed, but of too tender years to be made a concern in this bloody
difference, who being set upon by three of the opposite Family, though he
bravely defended himself, being overpowred, was made a sacrifice to their
revenge. This baseness extremely heightened the difference, yet it made somewhat
well for the Schiarri, who gained thereby the friendship of almost the whole
City, for they generally condemned the Donati for committing so horrid and
unworthy a murder, upon the person of one so young and tender, that he scarce
yet knew the handling of offensive Arms; in sum, scarce a day passed but either
wounds or deaths given or taken; yet my Schiarra and I passed unaffronted,
which proceeded not from any want of malice in the Donati to him, for they
particularly coveted his death as the son, and only son of one of the chiefest
of their enemy family; but because they knew that our friendship was such (and
seldom or never did we walk asunder) that it was impossible for them to engage
him, and not endanger me, and very sensible they were that should I have
miscarried by their swords, my Father would either by Embassy have procured,
or by war have forced the Grand Duke to have executed a severe vengeance on my
murderers; nor was the old Alonzo Schiarra insensible that it was out of fear
of me, for those reasons before recited, that his son passed unassaulted, and
therefore he took special care that he walked not out single, nor indeed in any
company but mine; but he might have spared those thoughts, for such was the
sweet harmony we found in one another society, that all others, except our
selves, seemed a jarring discord; and yet it happened one morning that I being
somewhat indisposed, and keeping my bed, he accompanied me in my chamber, till
about ten a clock, when I falling into an easy slumber, led by I know not what
evil Angel, he adventured to go abroad into the Piazza; scarce was he gone but
I awaked, and calling for him, a servant told me that he was newly gone forth,
I started to hear him say so, for me thought his very words were like the
passing Bell which rang out any friends funeral, I leapt out of bed, and put on
my clothes with a propicious speed, made all haste toward the Piazza, where I
found that true which my fears had boded to me, for just at the corner of the
street that entered upon the place, I espied him valiantly defending himself
against two of the Donati, I flew with all possible speed to the place, but
just as I arrived to his assistance, I had occasion given me to think that all
help of mine was too late, for brandishing my sword at one of of them, I had no
sooner said, And will the Donati never forget to be treacherous? but he fell at
my feet, fainting rather through effusion of blood, then for any dangerous or
mortal wound received; but seeing him fall I stopped my speech, and desperately
ran at one of his Assailants, whom I made measure out his length on the earth,
to accompany my dear friend, whilst the other trusted to his feet for his
safety, not need he have ran overswiftly, for my care of Schiarra would not
permit me to pursue him: but coming to my friend, who lay stretched out upon
the ground, I perceived in him very few symptoms of life yet I thought it more
convenient to cherish some hopes that he might recover, and by them encourage
my self to have his wounds quickly recommended to the Surgions care, then delay
time by an unprofitable grief, the only way utterly to loose him; and
therefore having got the assistance of some Citizens thereabouts, we carried
him home in a chair, the Surgions whom I had sent for, overtaking us, who after
they had laid him with the greatest ease they could upon the bed, began to use
those arts they thought most fit to return him to life, which in half an hours
time they effected, and in as much more having dressed his wounds, assured me,
that though they were very many, there was not one of them mortal, or
dangerous, but that his fainting was only for loss of blood, which out of so
many Orifices must needs find passage in abundance, that if they could now
(which they would use all their Arts to do) keep him from falling into a
fever, there could not be the least doubt of his recovery, and that in very
few days. I had no sooner received this comfortable news, but I ran with all
possible speed to communicate it to the good old Alonzo, who overcome with
excess of grief, had retired himself into his closet, and would by no
persuasions either be drawn thence, or restrained from tearing his gray hairs
and reverent beard, and miserably afflicting himself; being come to the door. I
knocked at it, and withal told him, that I had brought him news that would
rejoice him; And am I then so miserable, said he, as to hear Spinola tell me
now of rejoicing? Open the door Sir, said I, and if I do not perform what I
have promised, blot me out of the list of your friends; herewith he opened the
door, and looking steadfastly upon me, what, says he, my dear Spinola, have thou
now to tell me that can make me rejoice? now that I have lost my son, is it
that thou will be another Giorgio to me? I know thou will, and I accept it, but
alas! he was my own son, my own flesh and blood, give me leave then to lament
him; and herewith he began again to tear his hair and beard, but I stopped his
fury, by telling him, Alas Sir! why should you thus cruciate your self for a
supposed loss? your Son lives, and may, I hope, yet live to be as aged as you
are now: Fie, fie Spinola, said he, think you to make believe these are any
other then mockeries? I could never have believed you so cruel, did I not see
him dead? It Is true, replied I, he was both to yours and my appearance dead,
but it was only loss of blood, which was the cause of his fainting, for now
his spirits being revived, the Surgions assure me, he will in very few days be
easily recovered, none of his wounds being either dangerous, or mortal: If this
be true, replied he, how am I blessed, and blessed be thou that bring'st me
joyful news indeed; and thereupon going to take me about the neck to embrace
me, joy had so overpowred his soul, that his spirits failing, he fell into a
swound, but soon recovered, when yet he would not believe what I had related to
him, till his eyes had confirmed it: to be brief, three weeks time rendered
Schiarra by the great care and industry of the Surgions, perfectly whole,
during which time I never stirred from him, nor indeed durst I stir abroad, the
whole Family of the Donati having solemnly vowed my death, though they all lost
their lives, for the rescue I gave Schiarra, and for the wounding their
Kinsman, for slain he was not, and now my friend was recovered, we began to
consult our own safeties, for we were both equally concerned; the opinion of
old Alonze was, that I should return to Geno^a, where I might presume my self
secure, and that to my care he would commit his son, whom he did not doubt I
would preserve as my self, till the storms in Florence were blown over: I
returned him a hearty thanks for the honor he did me in making such a motion,
assuring my self that it would be seconded by my dear Schiarra, whose
friendship and mine had taken so deep root, that I was very confident nothing
but death, or inevitable necessity could separate us; so all parties being
agreed, we next advised how to take our journey with all possible privacy,
which to effect all things succeeded to our wish; so we departed from Florence,
taking our leaves of the good old Alonzo, who with many tears offered up
oraisons for our safety: In four days time we arrived at Genoua, where I used
my utmost endeavors to entertain Schiarra, according to best rules of
friendship, recommending him to those of my relations, whom I knew the greatest
honorers of worth and ve^^ue, but he would often tell me that my company was
the only solace of his soul, which I took care he should not want, for I
protest really that I believe in all the time which we spent in Genoua, which
was near a year, we never were three hours together absent from one another;
our sports were alike, our studies alike, and as yet we had not been wounded
with Loves which might separate and estrange our affections. About a
twelvemoneth, as I said, being past in the pleasures of Genoua and the Riviera,
I received Letters from my Father, commanding me to attend him at the Leaguer
of Ostend, that I might there to the Theory which I had learned, add some
knowledge of the practical part of War; this message extremly perplexed me, for
I was commanded to attend the messenger in his return, which was within six
days, and doing so, I was fearful least in that we should not procure license
from old Alonzo to permit my Schiarra to accompany me, and though I knew it
would be as great a trouble to him to part from me, as for me to be deprived
of him, yet I was confident without his Fathers license* he would not adventure
to go, much less not stay, should he command it: but hoping I might procure so
much favor from Alonzo as to permit him to accompany me in so honorable an
enterprise, thinking every hours delay a years; I communicated my Letters to
Schiarra, withal acquainting him with my resolution to write to his Father, to
beg the leave of his further society; for, said I, my dear Schiarra, I can as
well die as part from thee; He professed the same to me, and added, that
himself too would write, and that in such winning terms, that he should not
have the power to deny him; I rejoiced to hear him say so, but, said I, what we
do, must be done with all expedition, for within six days must the messenger
return with an answer of those letters he brought from my Father to the Senate,
with whom I am commanded to go: this made him sensible of the necessity of
expedition, so we immediately posted away a messenger on purpose, with order to
make all the haste imaginable, whilst we in the mean time provided all things
for our journey: but alas! the sixth day was now come, and our post not yet
returned, nor any news of him, the messenger whom I was to attend, would by
no means be persuaded to stay one minute; in this Agony we knew not what to
do, or what course to take, at length we resolved that Schiarra should
accompany me to the foot of the Alps, and if our Post overtook him not before
that time, or there, without a concession to go further, that then we should
part, and patiently endure our hard fortune; so we set forth, but a tedious and
melancholy journey it was, for we in vain every minute expected what yet came
not, three days we journeyed thus, till we came to the Mountains foot, the
place appointed for our taking conge of each other, and so fearful were we that
that adverse lot would certainly befall us, that we thought the next morning not
sufficient to bid one another adieu, but began as soon as we came in to our
Inn at night to bethink how we should wean our selves one from another; The
Illustrissimo, whom we attended, perceiving our mutual affection, was highly
pleased with it, and pitied so much our feared misfortune, that he, who at
Genoua refused to stay a minute, now proffered to wait a whole day there, in
hopes our Post might in that time arrive, for we had left order at Genoua he
should follow us thither, we equally strove who should first return thanks for
this great favor of this Illustrissimo's, who kindly accepted it, but by out
better fortune we needed not his courtesy, for that night going to bed with
somewhat more alacrity then formerly, our joys, hopes and fears, kept us still
awake, pouring forth Oraisons for the Posts arrival before the favorable time
of stay granted by the Illustrissimo were expired, when it happened that
whilst we thus busying our selves, we might at a great distance hear a horn,
which seemed to draw nearer to us; Schiarra no longer able to contain his joy,
nor doubting but that it was a Post sent from Genoua with Letters from his
Father, immediately lept out of bed, and in all haste putting on his
Nightgown, ran down stairs to meet the unexpected messenger of his and my
bliss, I followed him with all expedition possibly, and coming down into the
road, found him just examining of the Post, who gave him an account far beneath
his expectations, to wit, that he was come from Modena, and was bound in all
haste to Turine: Schiarra was almost angry with himself that he had flattered
himself into such mountanious imaginations, which in the end brought forth
somewhat less then a Mouse, nothing; and there-withall began to cry out, (...)
Schiarra! Nay rather unhappy Spinola^^^ I, when at those words a fellow, who
seeing us rise at that unseasonable time of night, and to come out of the Inn
into the street, out of mere curiosity had followed, hearing us name our
selves, accosted me, and tells me, Truly Sir, if you had now by chance named
your self I should have despaired of finding you out, for I had enquired for
you of almost every person in the Inn. And what is thy business, said I, that
thou were so inquisitive for me? not dreaming that he had brought such joyful
news. Business, said he, I have brought you, Sir, a return of your Letters from
Florence. From Florence, said Schiarra, delay not to deliver them Letters, that
I may know whether I am made miserable or happy, for on them depends my doom;
and there-vvithall snatching them out of the fellows hands, he ran in, and
calling for a candle, breaking off the cover, which was wholly to me, there
was enclosed one to me, and another to himself, mine he flings me, and with
fury breaking up his own, one might e're he had read one half of the Letter,
perceive by the serenity of his countenance, that it brought what his heart
desired; I adventured likewise to break up mine, where I found our blessings
confirmed to the height of our content, and therefore running to him, and
embracing him, now, said he, need we not to be beholding to the Illustrissimo's
courtesy, since we are made free to wait on his commands when he pleases: But
how strangely fortunate were we, said I, in the approach of the (...) ost,
without whom we had not found (...) own messenger, whose good news shall
never by me pass unrewarded: Nor by me, said Schiarra, who must, and do hold
my self as much obliged by it, and concerned in it, as your self, for now I
enjoy you in whom are all my joys completed, and therefore, dear friend, let
him accompany us forward in our journey; I readily assented, and therewith we
thought fit to take some two hours repose for it; now drew near morning, that
we might be the better able to travel the next day, when we set forth with
more joy and content then we had done at any time formerly. To recount unto
you the particulars of our journey, will be too prolix, it will suffice to
say, that it was prosperous, and that in six vveeks time from our departure
from Genoua, we arrived in the Camp before Ostend; here I endeavored to have my
Father receive my dear Schiarra, with the same affection that old Alonzo had
showed me, nor was he at all backward in performing my desires, striving
rather to exceed my self in kindness: having passed the first complements of
entertainment, we went to view the Leaguer, which had now lain two years
before that Town, or rather before some mounts of earth, for upon what was at
first the Town, our Camp was Pitch, and yet a Town held out against us; but I
am now dear friend, come to give a relation of those things in which your
self, as well as I, have been an actor, I shall therefore omit all passages of
that War, as to you tedious and superfluous, and only tell you, that Schiarra
did there things worthy himself and his family, and deserving my Fathers
greatest friendship and affection, who rejoiced that I had made choice of so
Noble and Gallant an Associate; we staid together in the Netherlands for some
years, after the surrendering of that once thought invincible Town of Ostend,
improving our selves as well as we could in the practice and policy of Arms,
in both which, blushing I speak it, Schiarra so far exceeded me, that were it
not to do my friend right, I should shame to acknowledge it. Your modesty it is
Sir, said Captain Goodlake interrupting him, that thus extenuates your own
deserts, and your generosity that amplifies the merits of your friends, which
how great soever, give me leave to think that they could not exceed yours.
Platter me not so, said Spinola, for of all men breathing you have least
occasion; But, continued he, my Father at length thought fit I should return
home, as being arrived at an age fit for Loves, and the care he had to see
children spring from the loins of me his only son, made him recommend unto me
several Ladies of the Genouese Nobility, out of whom he enjoined me to take a
wife, yet with all telling me, that he would not limit my fancy absolutely to
those, but leave me to choose where I pleased always, provided that I stained
not my birth or honor by too inferior a match: so Schiarra he recommended my
sister a Lady (as your eyes have been vvitness) of no despisable beauty,
assuring him that he should be happy if their affections could meet with these
instructions; we took our leaves, and arriving at Genoua, dedicated our selves
to the Courtship of Ladies; for my own part, I confess, I found in my self
little propensity to marry, yet I observed that Schiarra seemed to bear a kind
of affection to my sister, yet not so violent a one as I found afterward she
bore him, for his was not so fixed as appeared afterward, but that it could
stray away to the Love of another Lady, as it did by the strangest accident
that you have ever heard, to one, I must confess, of an excelling beauty, and
no way inferior to my sister Isabella in Nobility of birth, or riches; it
chanced one day that walking on the banks of the Riviera, where the Nobility of
the City use to solace themselves in the cool of the evening in their Coaches,
that Schiarra mistaking a Coach, which he thought to belong to one of our
peculiar friends, sifted up the curtain, but seeing his mistake, he craved
pardon for his unwilling offense, which he thought had been granted, but such
was the rage of the Gentleman, who accompanied only with one Lady was in it,
that though at present the expressed not his disgust, yet he awaited his
revenge, which my forced departure into the City about some urgent occasions,
gave him the better opportunity of effecting, for having traced careless
Schiarra into a private walk, he very rudely conjures him to draw; Schiarra was
so amazed that he could not at first find any answer, but that he believed the
Gentleman was mistaken: But the other with a kind of Spanish Bravado, answers,
that he should find his eyes had found out their true object, and that if he
refused to draw, he would send his coward soul to hell. Sir, replied Schiarra,
you seem to be noble, and by your garb should be at least a Gentleman, but you
must give me leave to admire your judgment, that so rashly seeks a quarrel
with me, who I am confident never injured you, nor to my knowledge ever saw you
before, but let me but know the reasons induce you to it, and you shall quickly
find I am no coward; all the reason in the world could produce no other answer
from the furious Gentleman, then that he had offered him an affront, which he
was resolved to revenge, and therefore advised him to draw, otherwise his sword
should force him; well answered Schiarra, since I must of necessity make trial
of your valor, I shall endeavor to make you repent it; and therewithal drawing
his sword, they made two passes in v^n one against the other, (...) it was
Schiarra's fortune, to give him a wound in the side, at which issued such (...)
of blood, that he immediately fell; now Sir, said Schiarra, you will be pleased
to give me a reason why you were so desperately and rashly valiant? Scarce had
he ended those words, when he might hear the cries of some Lady, piercing his
ears, and looking about, might perceive one running toward him, and crying,
Oh! for pity sake save my dear Lorenzo's life, or if nothing but blood can
satisfy your fury, sacrifice mine in stead of his to your victorious arm; such
was the amazement of the gallant Schiarra at the sight of her, and so much were
his senses captivated at the excelling beauties of her face, and harmony of her
voice, that not able to return an answer, he stood leaning on his sword, as if
her looks had the power of Medusas to turn men into Statues. The Virgin still
anxious for her friend, and fearing lest if her request were not granted soon,
it would be for ever too late, falling down on her knees, and embracing him,
began in a Language which would have charmed Adders to sue for the saving of
his life; Do not noble Sir, said she, let the tears and prayers of an
unfortunate Virgin, who never sued before, be now spent in vain, but redeem the
dear forfeit of my brothers life, or if you yet be so cruel that nothing but
gore can cancel your anger, here, here sheath your bright weapon between these
white breasts, this blood may sooner quench your ireful heat! let me die, so he
may live! with these words the tears so fast trukled down upon her Rosy
Cheeks, that it would have made the fiercest Scythian relent and turn pityfull;
but Schiarra still stood mute, as if her sweet voice had rather been thunder,
and struck him dumb, till at length recollecting himself, he endeavored to
raise her from the ground; but she refused to rise, crying, Oh! no Sir, here
will I for ever lie prostrate, till you confirm my boon, and grant Lorenzo
life; to which Schiarra seeing she would not rise, kneeling likewise down;
replied, Goddess, for so your celestial beauty, and Angelical voice confirm,
yea, pardon my inconsiderate rudeness (the child of my astonishment to look
upon so divine a presence) that has permitted you to kneel and beg that which
you may command. I am no Goddess, replied she, but a hapless Virgin, who here
lie prostrate for my brothers life. How readily Madam, answered Schiarra, would
I grant your boon, but that I fear by it I shall be too soon exiled from the
blessing your presence so fully affords me. Will you not then let him live?
replied she: Yes Madam, said he, he must live since you command it, and happy,
thrice happy it is being vanquished to have so fair a saver; would Heaven had
made his sword my Conqueror, so I might then have deserved so divine a pity;
Rise Madam, rise, and receive your brother, but let me now beg one boon of you
to know what made him my enemy? It was, said she, your lifting up the curtains
of our Coach, which though you excused, he in heat of blood pursued you to seek
revenge. 'Twas a mistake Madam answered Schiarra, that made me so discourteous,
which I will yet redeem with my life when ever you shall please to command it.
It Is too great a forfeit Sir, answered she, for so slight an offense, let me
now only beg your help to lift my brother into the Coach, which Schiarra
readily assented to, though with an inward unwillingness, because he should
thereby be deprived of the sight of his Saint: Scarce had he done it, and the
Coach departed, but I arrived at the place where this accident had happened,
and found Schiarra in the same posture which I represented him in at the first
sight of the Lady, having on his drawn sword, and fixing his eyes upon the
ground, with a countenance sufficiently demonstrating some strange and unusual
melancholy had possessed him, I wondered to see him stand in that manner, and
fearing lest my absence might have endangered him I ran to him, and pulling him
by the arm, demanded if he had been assaulted by thieves? He was no less
startled at his surprise, then I was to se^ him in these dumps, and had not his
eye been quicker then his hand, he had assuredly sheathed his sword in my
bosom, but seeing it was I who had disturbed his serious thoughts: Yes my dear
Spinala, said he, I have met with one who has robbed me of one of my choicest
Jewels, I am undone, for ever lost. Fie, said I, this is passion, fancy not to
your self a misery when none attends you, what is it thou have lost? Lost,
replied he, I have lost my self, but what is more I have lost you: Me, said I,
Hell it self is not capable of robbing me of so high prized a friendship, dear
friend dally not thus with me. Alas! Alas! said he, Heaven knows I da^ly not,
and that you may know I am serious too, here take my sword, and sacrifice me to
your just revenge. I must be sensible of an injury first, said I, for I am
confident none but your self can accuse you. True, said he, none but my self
and this treacherous heart of mine can be witness against me, I have forfeited
all those Obligations of friendship, in which you have bound me, these
traitorous eyes of mine have ruined me. Prithee how, said I, undeceive thy
self, this cannot be other then a delusion. Would to Heaven, said he, it were
so, but let me tell you plainly, and then I am confident you will your self,
without my entreaty, be ready to take my sword and make me a just victime to
the wrong I have done you. Alas! said I, my dear Schiarra, what can it be that
can make thee thus to fancy thou have wronged me? thy soul can never contract a
guilt so great but I shall be as ready to pardon it as you have been slow in
delivering it. Talk not of pardon, said he, for in confidence that you will
revenge it with my blood, I will impart it. It Is this assume it is this, all
those shows of Love which I have made to your virtuous Sister are vanished into
Air, that bond which should have bound fast our friendships to eternity, is
broken, utterly broken, for I now pay my devotions to another Saint. He could
not have invented a greater affliction to me then these words were, I started
and stood as amazed as I found him at first. I considered the passionate
affection which my Sister but few days before expressed to me she bore him, and
above that the great dishonor would be done to our Family should she be thus
slighted, but above all how ill my Father would comport such an affront to have
his daughter refused, because proffered by him, that in a rage snatching his
offered sword from his willing hand; Do but, said I, again confirm this
disloyalty, and you shall not need to beg me your Executioner. By the hopes I
have, answered he, that you will take a just revenge upon me, all that I have
told you is true, my heart is stolen by another. And can thou perfidious
man, said I, then leave my sister languishing, whom thou have betrayed into so
ardent an affection of thee, here take thy sword and defend thy self. I will
receive it, said he, not to make resistance, but in assurance that it will
provoke you to make me fall by yours, strike then, and let out this treacherous
blood. I could willingly, I confess, have made him an oblation to my poor
Sisters Love, and the honor of our Family, but the sacred name of friend so
often vowed between us, begat a palsy in my blood, and withheld my arm, so
turning from him: no false man, said I, I Will not become thy butcher, Heaven
shall work thy ruin, for be assured, who ever thou now make thy Spouse, will
prove a faithless Strumpet; At these words I was going away, but he called
after me, crying, thou lie, return, I Will now fight not in my own defense, but
hers whom I adore, for know she whom I now love is one whom thou oughtst not
mention unless with reverence on thy knees, one whose heavenly looks would
tempt a Hermit, who had spent his whole life in contemplation, nay, for whom
Angels would desert their bliss, and count it a greater happiness then Heaven
to enjoy her; return, for were thou armed with thunder, this sword should reach
thee. These words gave me assurance that he was irrevocably lost, I began to
consider that more sisters I had, more friends so worthy were not to be found,
and therefore returning to him, come Sir, said I, sheath your sword, and know I
pity you, and if my service can assist you in gaining your new love, command
it. Alas! my dear Spinola, said he, this is worse then killing me, to tantalize
me thus, for I know thou can not so much wrong thy self and sister. I do
think, replied I, you have never found me faithless, by all the Gods, by all
our vowed friendship, not all my sisters wrongs, shall make me prove disloyal
to you, let me then know who is now thy Mistress, that I may assist thee in
obtaining her. Am I then, said he, yet so happy in my misery? Talk not, said I,
farther of misery, for thou shall be fully happy, if all my skill and power can
effect it, let me first know your Saint. Alas! said he, that is my misery that I
know her not, yet it is she that was in the Coach we this day overtook: it is
then, said he, the fair Florelia, daughter to the Marquess of Senazzaro, so
famed for beauty over all the Genouese Territories. Be comforted dear friend,
said I, for my acquaintance with Gilberto, Steward to Sanazzaro, shall easily
procure your admittance, come and you shall easily perceive how zealous I will
be in thy service. Heaven, answered he, be propitious to our designs, and so
coming along we soon reached the City, and at the gates parted, he taking the
way to our Palace, and I to that of the Marquess Sanazzaro, where meeting with
Gilberto, I disclosed unto him Schiarra's Loves to Florelia, and desired that
he would invent some way to gain him admittance to her; he at first was
somewhat backward to attempt any thing, alleging that therein he should betray
his Master, and likewise abuse my friend, by feeding those hopes which would
prove but vain, she being already promised by her Father to one with whom he
will not break, and therefore, says he, noble Spinola, urge me no farther in
it. I knew 'twas gold that must make him relent, and therefore giving him a
pretty quantity, and promising more, he began to mollify, and to tell me, that
the person whom her father had allotted for her husband was by her violently
hated, yet such was the perverseness of the old Marquess, that he had
resolutely determined to force her to marry him, and that very speedily, so
that there was now no way left for to remove him, but the death of him he had
chosen for her Spouse. Do but name him, said I, and assure your self he is
sealed for dead. It Is, said he, Petruchio* eldest son and heir to the Count de
Ligue; in the mean time do you and your friend come to morrow night with some
Music to her chamber window, and doubt not of gentle audience.

I returned to my friend with joy, to have effected thus much, who embracing
me, and calling me the Author of his happiness, told me, that he had likewise
discovered somewhat which would not displease me. What is it, said I, Prithee?
why, says he, no sooner was I come home, but Catharina your sister Isabellas
servant calling me aside, began to tell me very seriously, that she was sorry
she must be messenger of such ill news, desiring me to arm my self with a noble
patience, and not let passion grow predommant at the hearing it. I began to
muse what it should be, and feared nothing more then that thy sister Isabella
having discovered my falsehood, had chalked out some path for revenge; but those
fears were soon dissipated, by the maids telling me, almost with tears in her
eyes, that Isabella had forgot all her loves to me, and now doted on the
Lorenso son to the Marquis of Sannazzaro, whom she had only espied out of a
window carrying in a chair to be dressed of a wound he then seemed to have
newly received. I easily (said Schiarra) guessed it to be the person whose life
my Florelia had begged, and so was I rejoiced at the news that I could hardly
feign to her to be troubled, which I thought fit to do. You did well, said I,
to do so, but you must now think of going to entertain your Mistress, which he
accorded to, and we having soon provided our selves of Musicians, addressed our
selves through the Postern, which Gilberto had of purpose left open for us, to
Sannazzaro's garden, and placing our selves under Florelias window, after the
Music had a while played, Schiarra caused his boy to sing this song, which he
had of purpose composed: I.
^ Airest Florelia rise,
And with thine eyes
Turn these sable clouds to light;
If thou but shine,
Thy rays divine,
Like glorious Sol will banish night;
Show but thy beauties, and the skies
Viewing the luster of thy eyes,
Will swear to yield unto that purer flame,
The Sun departed not of course, but shame.
II.
Rise Florelia, and view
A fire as true,
Though not yet so clear as thine;
It is thy light
Must make it bright,
And turn it to a flame will shine,
Shine so gloriously that none
Shall equal it but thine alone;
Look forth Florelia then, and with thine eyes
Make this Scorch't heart of mine thy sacrifice.


Scarce had he ended the first Stanza when we might hear the window open, and
Florelia and her maid discoursing with a seeming wonder who it should be that
at that time of the night had bestowed that Music on them; the maid guessing
it to be Petruchio, whose impertinency she discoursed on, and aptly discovered
to us the hate his Mistress bore him: but the Song being ended Florelia her self
demanded who it was, that when night had with its sable mantel beclouded the
world, durst there adventure with so much danger on her secrets? It is one,
answered Schiarra, whom you (when for your sake he saved your brothers life)
promised so much to honor as to keep in memory. If you be he, answered
Florelia, I confess I am obliged to honor your Nobleness, but you must excuse
me if at these untimely hours I dare admit no conference, your Music Sir, I
thank you for, and so much do I love you that I would not endanger you, for if
you should be seen here, your life would run a hazard, therefore farewell: here
she was about to shut the window, when Schiarra with a passionate voice cried
out, for Loves sake, stay Madam, for were there here dangers as thick as there
are Stars above us, nay were even death it self, here I would scorn his fury,
and believe that whilst you stay, I am by your presence made immortal. I am
content, replied she, lest you should condemn me of discourtesie to stay, but
you must then be brief in telling me what you desire. Oh! Madam, replied
Schiarra, confine me not to such hard terms, and yet why should I crave greater
license since all I wist for is summed in these few words, Madam, I love you,
and desire your love. And is that all, said she, then Sir farewell, and herewith
she made a second proffer to shut the window, and had done it, had not Schiarra
withheld her by crying; Oh Madam! let me conjure by the blood, which yet for
your sake flows in your brothers veins, to stay and hear me further. That
charms me for some time, replied she, but consider, I pray, both your danger
and mine, and therefore conclude with speed. Know then Lady, continued
Schiarra, that my zeal could tell you, that you are above expression fair, that
your eyes illuminate the night, and Eclipse the Stars in their greatest
brightness, that you are the Masterpiece of Nature, in which she strove to wed
Art and Beauty together, but these terms though they want nothing of truth, yet
are only fit to be used by those whose loves lie in their lips, my deeds shall
speak the truth and constancy of my love. Should all the actions in the world
confirm your love, answered Florelia, I must still return you the same answer
that I dare not, cannot love you, for my more honest thoughts permit me not to
deride your passions with frustrate species, or flatter them with vain hopes,
but as you have been brief in your desires, I will be the same in my denial; in
confidence of the truth of which, I desire you to rest satisfied, and assure
your self, that whilst you persist farther in it, you do but plough the seas,
and write in the sand. You are noble, answered Schiarra, thus to rid me of my
torment, and not permit me languishing to burn in those hot tortures, behold
this blade, which once for your sake did refrain from shedding your dear
brothers blood, shall now make me a victime to your cruelty, and here-withall
he was about to have sheathed his sword in his bosom, and had done it, had not
I who stood hard by perceiving his intent, ran to him and stayed his arm, which
Florelia perceiving, Fie, said she, what a fainthearted soldier are you thus to
despair at the first repulse, grant that I could affect you, would you not
account me light should I at the first assault be won, before I had made any
experience of your faith and loyalty; nor can I without my fathers consent
adventure to love any, get that, and you may perchance find heartroom in my
breast. Me thinks those words, replied Schiarra, return me to a new life, me
thinks the enamoured Stars hangs over thy lips, expecting a blessing from them.
Be not too hasty Sir, said Florelia, for it is yet impossible I should love
you, being already contracted. And yet it is in your power, replied he, to love
your servant. Well, said she, I can hold out no longer, and if what Anatomists
write, that in the Center of our hearts, there is a little concave where
resides our best affections, be true, then is your Augury a divine truth, for
all the love lies therein engaged to the worth of another, not to the jealoufie
of him to whom my father has contracted me. May I be so happy Madam, said
Schiarra, as to receive from your sweet lips the name of the person whom you
are pleased to make so blessed? Know then Sir, said she, for I can no longer
conceal it, but let the night yet shroud me with a blacker cloud, to hide from
you the blushes of my face, that from the first time I saw you, and observed
the nobleness of your temper, in saving my brothers life, which he had rashly
forfeited to your just revenge, I become a true devotarist to those virtues
which to me seemed heavenly: Here she made a small stop, expecting that
Schiarra should return some answer, but into such an ecstasy had his joy
transported him, that he was not so sensible of his happiness as to return a
due thanks for it, when his silence gave Florelia occasion to continue thus; I
fear Sir, my to soon yielding to your desires has abated, or utterly
extinguished that love you but now zealously protested to bear me, but if it
have, I can but blame my own credulity; farther she would have proceeded, when
Schiarra recollecting himself, interrupted her by crying out; Oh! Madam, do not
believe my silence to proceed from any other cause then the exuberance of my
joy, your words have ravished me beyond my hopes, and made my heart too narrow
to contain that bliss, which now you have made it entertainer of. Then Sir,
replied she, excuse my jealous mistake, and if you please walk round about the
house, my maid shall attend to give you entrance. I will fly to such happiness
Madam, said he, and therewithal we were just going, according to her command,
when betrayed by that perfidious villain Gilberto, we were encountered by
Petruchio, the contracted Lover of Florelia, I was the foremost, and therefore
the first that met him, murmuring to himself in such terms as I easily guessed,
that he had overheard all their discourse, yet had I carelessly passed by him,
had he not bid me stand, and withal told me, that he had an arm Heaven it self
would not let falter in revenge of such impious injuries; what art thou, said
I, that after thou have made a forfeit of thy life by over-hearing our secrets,
dare thus rashly tempt thy death, be gone, be gone, and bless that fate that
spare thee. Be gone, said he, were you encompassed with whole Legions, this
single sword would dare to encounter them, and force a way to my revenge. Your
very valiant, replied I, or else some strange and unknown desperate frenzy has
seized you, retire Sir, or tell what it is has prompted you to this madness.
You shall find it is not madness but justice, said he, which of you two is it
that dates attempt to court my Florelia, mine I call her, since both her self
and father have confirmed her so. Dare Sir, replied Schiarra, it is I dare dot,
and will, what dare thou do to oppose it? I dare Sir revenge it, said he, but
first I Will tell that wrong you do both heaven and me, in striving to deprive me
of my betrothed Spouse, she is mine, nor can she while I live be any others.
This sword shall clear my passage to her, replied Schiarra, and since you must
have a Mistress, I Will send you to choose one amongst the Infernal deities. Dear
friend, said he, turning to me, put up your sword, this glorious quarrel does
concern none but my self; come Sir draw, (again to Petruchio) and let our
weapons decide whose she must be. Stay Sir a little, said Petruchio, you seem a
person well qualified, and let me with your badness of your cause chill that
blood which flows so violently in your veins, consider that with your blood you
strive to ravish her from me, who both by her self and father has been
confirmed mine, before whole quires of Saints and blessed Angels; let not your
lust then blind you to run headlong to a sin so horrid and abominable. Oh!
Sir, consider, and hazard not your souls salvation on a quarrel so unjust,
should it be my fate, as in justice it must be, to kill thee, consider what a
mass of endless woe (have thou no other sins to charge thy conscience with)
thou pluckst upon thy head, sure this must cause an earthquake in thy blood. I
am no Schoolboy, replied Schiarra, to be thus Catechized, words are to weak to
force me from the love of the Beautous Florelia, if you will enjoy her you must
fight for her, which with what reason you can do, when you know that after your
sword has gained her from me, you must likewise force that will which cannot
love you; come Sir prepare your self, or resolve Lamb-like to die her
sacrifice. Since you are so resolute, replied Petruchio, this sword shall
quickly find your heart, and therewith drawing made a sudden thrust at
Schiarra, who as nimbly avoided it, and with the point of his weapon found a
smooth way to his enemies heart, who without speaking a word fell down and
died, and Schiarra glad that it was done with so little noise, and I proceeded
to find our entrance into the house, at the back door of which we found
Florelias maid attending, who joyfully received Schiarra, and both desired me
to walk to my Palace, the maid assuring me that my friend need fear no danger;
I left them, but my soul boding some further evil, I could not depart, but
resolved to watch my Schiarra's coming out till the morning, but before that
approached, I might hear a bustle in the house, and epsy one fetching a
dangerous leap out of a window, which I supposed to be Florelias; I ran toward
the place with all speed possible, where I found Schiarra set upon disarmed,
and almost naked as he was, by a villain, whose person the darkness of the
night hindered me from discovering, but obstructed me not from taking a just
revenge of depriving him of life, and rescuing my friend, who all breathless as
he was, desired me to assist him to make the quickest escape we could toward
our Palace; I seconded his desires, and wondering at what should be the occasion
of this Tragical event, should scarce have contained my desires of knowing it,
till we came home, had not my fear of being too close pursued and surprised,
witheld me, but being come home, I was earnest with Schiarra to know the manner
and cause of his fright, but all he could tell me was, that when he was close
clasped in the embraces of the beautous Florelia, her father, by whom informed
of his being there he knew not, he came into the chamber, and had there
sacrificed his life to his rage and fury, had not the window by chance been
open, out of which he leaped, and had there again been slaughtered, had not I
come into his rescue. I was amazed at what he told me, and began now to imagine
that Gilberto had betrayed us, and was fearful lest in the morning we should be
pursued for Petruchio's, and the others death; but those doubts were soon over
by the general report of the accident spread about the City, that old
Sanazzaro, finding his daughters incontinency, had in rage murdered her, that
Petruchio her betrothed Spouse was found dead in the garden, and the Marquesses
Steward Gilberto slain under Florelias window, that there was no means left to
find out the causers of this Tragedy, but by some cloths and a sword which was
left in the chamber, and supposed to be his who had robbed Florelia of her
honor; these reports confirmed unto us Gilberto's treachery, yet we were glad
he could now no farther betray us, but above measure was Schiarra afflicted for
Florelias murder, whom I endeavored to comfort as well as I could, and further
advised to depart with all speed, for though it should not be found out that
those clothes were his, yet should any of Sannazzaro's kindred but entertain
the least suspicion of him; they would watch some opportunity to take away his
life; he liked my advice, and his quarrel between the Dukes of the Ferrara and
Mantua being then breaking forth, upon my assurance that our State would assist
the Mantouse, and that my self would come thither in person, he choose to go to
Mantua, and attend my coming, during which time how he joined himself with the
Dukes forces, and how unfortunately he fell, you have too lately heard.

Captain Goodlake was extremely affected with this Tragick-History of young
Schiarra, which so delighted him, that though the night was well past, he could
have wished it had continued till morning, but being ended, these two generous
friends addressed themselves to their sleep, but their troubled thoughts not
permitting them to take any quiet rest, as it were by one consent, Spiuola
desired, and Goodlake proffered a continuance of the History of the virtuous
English Maid, which he pursued as follows.

THE CONTINUATION Of the HISTORY Of the Magnanimous Maid.
THe boisterous Savoyards said Goodlake, disturbed me in the midst of the
Relation of Mr. Forcett, made me of the Comportment of this virtuous Maid,
during the absence of her Lover, that amongst the number of her Suitors she had
turned away some, whose birth and fortunes of persons might seem to bear equal
balance with her beloved Spencers, which yet could not batter her well-fixt
Constancy, but that it still flood as firm as a Rock in the midst of the
boisterous waves: But amongst the rest, continued he, two Suitors there were,
out of whose ridiculous humors she made her self sport, the one son to the
Mayor of the Town where she lived, clownish in every thing, yet forced by his
father to make address unto her, the old man hoping that by his power in the
Town, he might gain her for his son; to tell you (said Forcett) the antic
postures in which both the old man and his son courted this fair Virgin, the
great proffers, and many invitations they made, would seem but tiresom, I shall
therefore omit them and proceed to the other; who having usurped the Name of
Captain, though never guilty of the least valor, or daring to look an enemy in
the face, did think by his Rhodomontado terms rather to force than win
affection, so that in the end he became a continual plague and vexation to her;
neither her self nor any of her house being able to rest at quiet, or be free
from his boisterous rudeness; her servants he commanded as his own, and with a
kind of an imperious boldness would assault her, as if his bellowing words
like so many Cannons, were sufficient to batter the fortress of Faith. Thus was
he for a good while her continual trouble, which she bore with patience, till
at length she found out such a way to curb his domineering rudeness, as
sufficiently demonstrated her of a high and magnanimous spirit, far above her
birth; often had she complained to me (said Forcett) of the roarings of this
boisterous Captain, but I was as ignorant as her self how to remedy it, much
less could have invented such a course as she her self one day imparted to me
she resolved to undertake, which seemed indeed at first so strange, that I
stood amazed at the very mention of it, as I believe you will be when you hear
every particular: It was briefly, calling me one time after she had just before
been vexed with his debauchedness, she began to tell me that I could not but be
sensible how grievous it was to her, to see her self controuled, her servants
beaten, and her whole house commanded by a ranting fellow, who having learned
some high-flown speeches, thought he might with them domineer over the world,
that for her part she could no longer endure it, and therefore had bethought
her self of a remedy, which if I would assist her to effect, and promise to be
secret in, she would put in execution: I told her I should be ready faithfully
to perform whatsoever she pleased, and that I was honored she would so far
entrust me: Then know, continued she, that I cannot believe that this Bumbast
Captain is any thing but an empty vessel, that all his boasts and
Rhodomontado's of valor, are nothing but an empty and airy sound, and he as
destitute of valor as he is of good manners, I have therefore resolved to make
trial of him; and if you will but furnish me with Clothes and a Sword, attired
like a young Gentleman, make an attempt of his courage. I could not imagine what
answer to return to such a strange proposition; but are you serious indeed,
said I? Serious, said she, if you doubt it, I will trouble you no further, but
request this courtesy of some one else. Nay, said I, if you be resolute, I
shall assist you what lies in my power: but had you not better let me do this,
than hazard your self? suppose he should fight, what resistance is your tender
arm able to make? Fear not, said she, I cannot in the least suspect he will
dare to oppose me, but if he do you shall see I will not yield basely. I
laughed heartily (said Forcet) to hear her so confident, and promised her to
furnish her out at all points; but then, said he, how will you do to meet him
out of town? It must be your care, answered she, to train him forth: I
concluded, said he, it should, and having appointed the place whither I would
bring him, and to which I might have a fair excuse for; having over night
furnished this Amazonian Maid with all necessaries, I easily persuaded him to
walk next morning to the place destined for his disgrace; he all the way we
walked chanting to me in a sublimated tone his almost unexpressible valors, and
wishing that we might meet with some. Hector that durst affront us, that I
might bear witness of his courageous spirit. I soothed his humor, and taking
leave of him at the place appointed, which was a style that led across a large
field, I pretending that I would only call at a house which stood on this side
the hedge, and at the further corner of the field, and promising him to meet
him on the other side; no sooner was I gone over, but I perceived that by
reason of the thickness of the hedge, he could not discern whether I took the
way I promised or no, I clapped my self down close to the ground, looking through
to behold the period of this Heroic Adventure, when scarce had the Redoubled
Lance-prizado passed thirty yards from the hedge, but he was met by this
Magnanimous Virago, clad like a spruce young Gallant, who boldly jostled him, so
that she almost overthrew him, yet though he tottered two or three yards out of
the way, yet his patience was not at all shaken, for without grumbling or
seeming offended at his Affront, he courteously saluted our Amazon, and would
have passed away, had not she now resolved to prosecute her intended revenge
upon him to the height, and therefore following him, demanded with an angry
countenance, wherefore he had jostled her? To which my roaring Captain very
submissively replied, Indeed noble Sir, I hope you will be pleased to excuse
me, for I intended no harm, but you were pleased to thrust your poor servant
out of the way. Villain thou lie, cries this manly Maid, and therefore with
thy sword either give me satisfaction for my abuse, or here I vow to lay thee
dead, why do not draw? Hold, let me entreat you, hold, as you are a
Gentleman, replied the Rhodomontado, for I have made a solemn Oath that I will
not this day draw my sword against any. No, said she, thou have taken the lie
already, will not that provoke thee, I Will try if this will do, and
therevvithall gave him a full box on the ear. You may this day noble Sir,
replied he, do what you will with me, for I have solemnly resolved that I
will not break my Oath. Villain thou lie, thou have made no Oath, said she,
it is Covvardice, mere Cowardice vvithholds thee, not Oaths, base Catife; why
art not thou Roughman that furious Ajax, whom no day does pass but you either
vvound, or kill, pray how comes this out of your Calender? Who I noble Sir,
said he, I kill or wound? Alas! I never drew this sword in anger, unless it
were on some poor vveak fellow that never durst wear steel about him. And
dare thou villain then, said she, dishonor all noble soldiers by vvearing
that sword thou dare not use, deliver it me, or by Heaven I Will send thy
Coward soul to Pluto. I could hardly, said Forcett, forbear laughing so loud
that they might hear me, to see with what a mild temper that man, who in a
Tavern would Thunder as if he had been able to encounter half the world, now
delivered up his sword to a woman, and with humility submitted to permit her
to tread over him; vvhilest I seeing the bufiness to have so happily succeeded,
made haste to meet him at the other side of the field, where I, making haste,
arrived just as he came there, and before I could speak to him, began in a
thundering tone to tell me, that just as he had prophesied, so it fell out, for
he was scarce parted twenty steps from me, but he was encountered by one
whose valor did as far exceed the Trojan Hectors, or Grecian Achilles's, as
their did Dametas and Climas's. You tell me, said I, of a miracle, but of what
stature and years might this Hero be? I must confess, replied he, that he was
of no gigantick proportion, nor did I believe count more then the sixth part of
long-lived Nestors days, but for the agility of his body, strength, and
nimbleness of his arm, he exceeded all those monstrous Giants, talked of to be
slain by George a horseback, Bevis of Southampton, or Guy of Warwick. ^^smiled
within my self, said Forcet, to hear these extravagancies, but because I
would make no show that I knew of the disgrace put upon this Coward Bravo; I
all the way as I went and returned to the Town, highly applauded his
insuperable valor, as I termed it; nor did he want to give me occasion to do
so, by ravelling up actions which he thought he had enforced me into a belief
of, far beyond all the labors of Hercules. But that, continued he, which gave
most occasion of pleasure in this adventure, was his desire that I would go
with him to Besse Bridges her house, whom as he told me, he would acquaint
with this his resolute combat; I easily consented to go with him, because I
knew that there we should soon make him sensible of his shame; being arrived
there, he began to pursue his accustomed domineering fashion over her servants,
and vvithall commanded her presence, and she being come, began to relate to her
his adventure in such thunder-thumping words, that the furious battle between
the Centaures and Lapithites, contained not more horror then he expressed this
with: Had you, said he, seen two tilling Meteors justle in the middle Region,
you would have made it an apt simile to that force and fury with which we
encountered; Briarius's self with his hundred Giant hands, could not have dealt
blows thicker, and more fierce, then this brave Trojan, yet were they all by
the force of this invincible arm, able to repel thunderbolts, put by, and on
his head redoubled. Alas! said this Magnanimous Maid, I fear me this too much
valor of yours will make you one (...) subject to the law, if it have not
already, I tremble to think what became of your enemy. You may tremble, said
he, to think of the fury of our fight, but I so hackt and hewed him, that if he
be not past all fear and trembling, I Will never more put trust in this good
sword. But if he be in such danger, replied she, why fly you not, and so
escape the clutches of the Law? The Law, said he, I fear it not, for I was
once told by a Conjurer I should never die for murder. He knew thy constitution
very well, replied she, that told thee so, and I dare believe her; come hither
Bragadochio, and tell me, was not this Giant with whom thou did encounter a
youth, and of my pitch? Deny it if thou dare, or if thou have the impudence
to do it; see here, is not this the Suit he wore? this is the very shoe thou
stoopedst to unty, and this the leg that did bestrid thee, whilst thou like a
beastly Coward layest along, this hand returned again thy sword which thou
yieldedst up at my first demand, deny but this, and in this woman's habit I will
force it from thee.

You cannot imagine (said Forcett) that I could contain my self and not burst
into laughter, to see how gallantly she carried this Affair, whilst our
high-flown Rhodomontado in as low a style as he could invent, confessed that
all she had said was true, begging of her not to make his shame public. Redeem
it then (said she) and I shall not be backward, with as much civility as I can
aff^rd, to grace you as much as you have now disgraced your self. You have
wakened me, replied he, and kindled in me that fire of valor, which clouded by
some coward thoughts has so long layen asleep, and made me prize my fameless
then my blood: you have, I say, awaked me, and if I defer by some valiant
deed to repair my wounded honor, you will do but justly to make me the scorn
and reproach of boys and children; nor was he more slack in performance then he
had been in promising, for quite leaving of his bragging humor, he became truly
and worthily valiant, and now deserves the commendation of all deserving
personages, so great a cure had this Magnamious Maid wrought. These are, said
Forcett, some particular passages of her life in your absence, to which the
Generals have been so correspondent, that should I strive to applaud her
virtues, truly I should but whisper to you, what her Fame blazons forth to the
world.

I was both affected and afflicted, continued Goodlake, at this relation of
Forcetts, and I must needs confess that I was never so nigh to have swerved
from the course of virtue, as I was now for the estate which my dear friend
Spancer had left to her, I thought unworthily bestowed, and could more
willingly have hearkened to a Story of her inconstancy and incontinency, that I
might have enjoyed the other moiety of his lands, then thus to have heard the
whole world applaud her virtue: nay so much was I transported, that whether it
was out of covetize in my self, or a real sense of the unreasonableness of the
gift to one of so mean birth, that I was tempted to make a trial of this so
fained piece of chastity and virtue, which at length I resolved to do, and in a
disguise for some days frequented her house, attempting her by all allurements
of courtship, and promises of rewards, such as would in my thoughts have
tempted an Angel; but I found her still lamenting the death of her Spencer,
(which she had heard of by some Gentlemen that came over in the same ship with
me) and resolutely bent that since she had not the fortune to enjoy him as her
Love, she would never enjoy any; one day above the rest I pressed into her
privacy, where I found her lamenting over the Picture of her beloved Spencer, I
stood some time aside listening, when I might hear her say; It cannot sure be
true that thou art dead my Spencer, death could not be so cruel to take thee in
thy prime! but if he has, how happy is that earth that does contain thy
breathless corpse, how do the cold clay incircling thy tomb, rejoice that it is a
neighbor to so noble corpse! Oh! that I were so happy to lie by thee, but since
that cannot be, I Will study how to dye, that though our bodies lie at this vast
distance, our souls may meet and safely harbor together! and yet, why should I
be so cruel to my self, to whom thou vvast so unkind as not to leave me some
few commands before thy death! this Picture which is thy lively representation,
is more courteous, 'twill not deny me twenty thousand kisses, since the fates
deny me thee, it shall be my husband, for here I vow never to marry other! At
those words I stepped to her, and snatching away the Picture, would have
departed with it, had not she, taking hold of my clothes, stopped me, and
falling down on her knees, cried out, Oh Sir! for goodness sake deprive me not
of that Jewel which I prize above the wealth of both the Indies, rather let me
beg you to possess your self of all I have, and leave me only that. You beg in
vain, said I, nor must you think that bribes will make me so much wrong my
friend as to leave his will unperformed. What was that friend, said she? 'Twas
one, said I, loved you too well, nor did deserve such inconstancy as you have
been guilty of, which made him charge and command me when his soul was now
ready to expire to come hither, and force from thee this Picture, unfit to
grace a Strumpets chamber. Suspend not my fear Sir, replied she, but let me
know the name of this cruel friend of yours. Spencer, said I Villain, said she,
starting up, thou lie, and so much more damned is thy lie, by how much thou
wrongest by it the dead soul of him, who whilst living, would have pulled out
that treacherous soul that durst have wronged that chastity, which I have so
entirely preserved for him, and will for his memory. Nay, said I, if you will
be angry vent your passions alone, farewell. Oh! stay, cried she, and though my
Spencer could be cruel as to deprive me of what I prize above my life, the
only remembrance I had of him, yet be not you so inhumane as to deny me to
take my last farewell of it. I do not much care, said I, if I grant your suit,
provided you will promise immediately to return it. As I am chaste I will,
replied she, and therewithal gave her the picture, which having kissed over,
she began afresh to cry out, Oh! thou perfect resemblance of my Love, my
dearest Love, for whose safety I have every morning before the Larks with their
sweet Notes saluted bright Aurora, and every night when all other humane
Creatures were buried in sleep; and none but Stars were vvitnesses, poured
forth Oraisons to Heaven, for whose sake I have remained constant and
unspotted, though he has been so unkind with his last words to blast my
memory, accept yet this, and this kiss for my last farewell! and here Sir, said
she, since it must be so, take this remembrance of my Lord, the sight of which
has often made me give alms, visit prisoners, and lend money to needy
Travelers, that Heaven might repay it Spencer, but with it let me beg one
boon, that if some few days hence you hear I am expired, you will for his sake,
to whom you were once a friend, accompany my corpse to the grave. I was so
extremely transported with this excess of virtue, (for what else to call it I
know not) that I was neither able to take the Picture, nor to undeceive her,
but recollecting my self, and pulling off my disguise, no, said I, keep both it
and withal this Ring from off your Spencers finger, nor did his love cease
with his life, this Will brings you a Legacy of five hundred pound per annum.
Oh! now you have told me that, replied she, which makes my loss the greater by
how much his love was more superlative. But I hope Captain Goodlake, continued
she, you will excuse me for my being so rash with you, 'twas your disguise
caused it. I must rather beg excuse, replied I, that I have been so harsh to
you, though I doubt not your pardon; since, said I, it is now in vain to lament
Spencers death, and that he has divided his Estate betwixt us, let those loves
which we severally ought to him, be joined together in us. Alas! Sir, replied
she, my love is buried in his grave, and my resolutions never to enjoy any
other, sealed with a solemn vow* but because you were his friend, I will impart
to you a secret, which none else must know, and in which I doubt not but you
will be partaker with me. Willingly, said I, be it to pass through dangers
never undergone by men or devils yet. Go then, said she, and e're you know
farther, purchase for me that ship which lies for sale in the rode, see her
well fitted and manned, I have money ready to defray all charges, and this done,
you shall know farther; I went according as she desired me, though I could not
yet imagine what design she intended: I soon fitted the Frigate according to her
order, coloring both the Hull with black, and furnishing her with Sable Sails,
and Colors; this done and the Frigate, (which she would have named the Negro)
being munitioned with sixteen brass Guns, and threescore and twelve stout men,
I went to acquaint her that she was now in readiness to put to Sea, whom I
found to have (whilst I was taking care about the ship) had the same care in
sitting her self out for the voyage, having settled her Estate in case of
miscarriage, and bestowed most of it to pious uses; being thus prepared, we
soon set to sea, her self vested in man's apparel, and having administered an
Oath to all in the Ship, not to discover her sex upon any disasters whatsoever
without her free consent; to me she gave the command of the Ship, and made
Roughman, into whom she had by her Magnanimous spirit inspired valor, my
Lieutenant, Mr. Forcett accompanied us as a voluntier; we were for many days
blessed with prosperous winds, steering our course directly toward the
Islands, within two days sail of which we were encountered by a Spanish Man of
War, who stoutly attacqued us, but found that resistance which he little
expected, in sum, after two hours fight (during all which time this Magnanimous
Maid behaved her self with a more then manly courage, cheering up the soldiers,
and her self in person ventring amongst the thickest dangers) the Spaniard
instead of making us his Prize became ours, only with the loss of seven of our
best Seamen, but that was recompensed by the damage which the enemy fell, to
wit, not only of ship, goods and liberty, but the lives of near forty of their
men; yet such was the generosity, that only distributing some of the riches of
the spoil amongst the Mariners, and disarming the Vessel, she gave those that
survived the Ship, and sent them away with blessings for her courtesy; two
days after this encounter we arrived in the Port of Fial, where she first
discovered to the whole company what she often before had in private told me,
to wit, that her whole intent of coming thither, was only to fetch the body of
her beloved Spencer, and intomb it in a place where her self might afterward
sleep with him; she therefore told them, that now she must make the utmost
proof of all their affections to her, which would best be expressed by their
valorous attempting the Town, and redeeming out of it the body of her there
slain Lover; they all seemed ready and willing to accomplish her will, and
though we were but 65. in number, not any man's fears, or doubts of ill success
appeared in their faces, but all were ready to fall on, yet I was loath to
think that so many good men should be cast away, and lost in vain, for with so
small number to have attaqued a Town then newly and strongly refortified by the
Spaniards, would have been an act of so great desperation, that we should
hardly have escaped the censure of being guilty of our own murders; I therefore
advised that we should first man out our Boat, to see if by the taking some
straggling Spaniards, we might come to know what force was in the Town, before
we attempted so hazardous an enterprise; this counsel, after a small
deliberation, was agreed and assented to, and Mr. Forcett with ten men taking
the command of the Boat, soon brought us in two Spaniards, whom their own fears
made confess, that after the departure of Essex his Fleet, the Spaniards were
returned, and had with a new line begirt the Town, that they had received great
supplies both of men, ammunition, and provision, from the Spanish Fleet, but
lately departed thence; that the soldiers now in garrison, were two Companies
of foot, besides the inhabitants; but all this had not deterred us from
pursuing our first intentions of assaulting it, had not the Spaniards, upon the
enquiry of our Virgin owners, informed us, that the body of Spencer, though at
first buried in the great Church, and a stately Monument reared over it, was
upon the Spaniards repossessing of the Town, it was removed thence as the Corpse
of a Heretic, (as those of your faith are pleased to style us, though I
believe the greatest part of those our Nation rather entertain the Protestant
Religion, as that which they suck in with their mothers milk, then out of any
sounder reason or search into the depth and truth of it) and buried in the
fields, nor was it yet permitted to rest there, for the man that ought the
field doubtful that his Corn would never prosper, whilst his Land was fatted
with a Heretics body, petitioned the Church that it might be taken up and
burnt, which was easily granted, and as readily performed. The impossibility
therefore of effecting our desires, or gaining what we came for, made us desist
from further pursuit of it, but not from some part of our revenge, in battering
down some part of the Town and Church, upon those who dealt so harshly with the
body of our dead friend; this we had scarcely performed when from the main-top
one of our Mariners espied two sails coming in directly toward us, we had no
reason to guess them other then enemies, and therefore immediately made ready
to fight them, and because they should not have the advantage of combating us
in their own Port, we made out, and to draw them somewhat farther off the land,
that they might have no relief from thence, made show of flying from them, and
they as greedily pursued us as the hungry Tiger would his prey, but being as we
thought at sufficient distance from shore, tacked about upon them, and easily
gaining the Windward, when we came nigher we might perceive that the one was an
English Merchant-man, made Prize by the other a Spanish Rover; we were mightily
encouraged to find that we had no ods against us, and therefore readily clapped
them aboard, not doubting but to carry them at the first assault, but our hopes
failed us, for we were not only twice beaten back, but the third time boarded
by them, and had not our men been more then men, we had utterly been lost; but
who would refuse to fight when they saw our Magnanimous Amazon encouraging
them, and her self in the van, prostrating her tender body to the greatest
dangers, her valor it was that at length repelled the Spaniards, and
prosecuting the Victory (whilst I wounded in this last assault was (unable
longer to stand) retired to my Cabin) soon made those proud Dons vail their
Top-sail to her Maiden Flag: And now possessed of her enemy, she next
generously pursues the release of the English prisoners, to whom she freely
restored both their ship and goods, and supplied what damage they had
received, out of the riches of the Spanish Pirate; but surveying the persons of
all the Prisoners, she chanced to cast her eye upon one, whose countenance so
absolutely represented her Spencer, that had she not been confirmed by so many
convincing that he was dead, she would certainly have challenged him for hers,
but confident of his death she refrained, yet the so near remembrance of him
surprised her spirits, so that swounding away, she was conveyed into her
Cabin; nor were his eyes (for Spencer it was indeed) during her stay less
fixed upon her, he believing that he had seen that face, but by reason of her
virile habit, not in the least dreaming it could be she; Roughman who was now
the chief in the ship during our owners indisposition, and my weakness,
dispatched away the Merchants ship to follow her intended traffic, and thus
were these two Lovers, by reason of my wounds, no sooner met then parted,
seeming to know and yet not daring to know each other. The Spanish Prize was
equally divided amongst the Sailors, and the Hull being made unserviceable with
our shot, sunck in; but it was the care of this Magnanimous Maid that the
Spanjards should all be safely set on shore at Fial, which being done, we Roved
for some months over a wilderness of seas, seeking out revenge upon the
Spaniards for their inhumanity to Spencers body; but at length we were forced
for want of fresh water, to put into Mamorrah, a Port belonging to the Kingdom
of Fosse, into which being entered, our noble Virgin owner, weary of her manly
habit, revested her self in most gorgeous feminine Robes, as well for her own
pleasure, as to let the Moors have a sight of those beauties with which England
was enriched; it is the custom in that Country that as soon as any ship comes
into haven, one of the chief Beighs belonging to the King, goes aboard, as well
to take knowledge from whence she came, and for what reasons she came thither,
as to take an account of her lading, which he is at his return to deliver into
the hands of the King his Master; it fortuned that it was the turn of Beigh
Alcade to come aboard our Negro, who being brought into the presence of our
Heroic Maid, was struck with such wonder and amazement at her excelling
beauty, that not able to require an account of us, he stood rather like a
Statue then any living soul, but at length recollecting himself, he fell down
on his knees, and terming her the Goddess of the Sea, made proffer to kiss the
hem of her garments, but being raised up by her, and told that she expected no
such adoration, but only came in thither to desire some relief of fresh water,
and other necessaries for her Seamen; he hardly yet put out of his belief that
she was some Goddess, told her that all they had were offerings too little for
so divine a presence, and that the hearts of men were oblations fitter for her
worth, then such mean and earthly things as she desired: Talk not of divinity,
replied she, for we are all like you, mortals; nor come we hither to be
worshipped (though we know you prone enough to adore novelties) but to supply
our necessities with which desires if you please to acquaint your King, you
will pay us that service which we shall accknowledge as a favor, and endeavor
to requite. I am happy dumb Creature (answered Alcade) that the Gods have at
length been so favorable to me, as to confer a bounty on me worthy themselves,
that is the serving you; our Heroic Virgin returned him thanks for his
professed readiness to supply our necessities, and having caused some rich
presents to be offered him, which he thankfully accepted dismissed him to give
an account to Mullisheg King of Fesse his Master of his adventure, who
earnestly attended the success of it, for the blackness of our sails, Ship,
and colors, had astonished not only himself, but all his Subjects: Alcade
being arrived at Court, the King had not patience to attend his coming up into
the Presence, but meeting him almost at the Gate, demanded of him what ladeing
that mournful Vessel brought, she brings, mighty King (answered Alcade) a
jewel more worth then all your Kingdoms; then all my Kingdoms (said
Mullisheg) what i^estimable thing is that thou talkst of? surely thou must
either overvalue that, or undervalue my vast Dominions; is the whole Ship an
entire Diamond, and all her Cordage Ropes of Orient Pearl, yet were itso it
would not stand in competition with my Potent Realms Alas! great Sir (replied
Alcade) it is not the Ship but her lading that is so inestimable, she bears a
Goddess in her, a Goddess said Mullisheg la^ghing, sure thou art distracted? I
know not whether I am distracted or no (answered he) but sure I am, my senses
are ravished with such Divine Angelical features as never mortal yet beheld,
and if she be less then a Goddess there are certainly no Deities. Mullisheg was
strangely amazed to hear this report, not could he contain (though he almost
believed it but a fancy of Alcade^s) from satisfying his curiosity, having
therefore commanded a present of all sorts of necessary provisions of the
richest and delicatest to be taken out of his Storehouses for those were the
things he understood by Alcade Beigh they most wanted, he caused Ioffer Bassa
his prime Minister of state to accompany Alcade back again to the Negro with
orders to inquire into the birth and Country of this Princess (for he so judged
her to be rather then a Goddess) and if they could possibly either by gifts of
promises of honor and preferments to persuade the Captain to bring on shore
that rich Cargazoon of beauty. According to his orders they came a board, and
found all things to suite with their utmost desires, she her self freely
proffering to attend the Moresco King provided he would first consent to sign
such Articles as she would send him which were in short these. First that there
should be liberty granted to her and her attendants to leave the land at
pleasure. Secondly safe conduct to and from her Ship at her own discretion.
Thirdly that she might live free from all violence either from the King or any
of his subjects. Fourthly that her Mariners might be allowed fresh victuals
aboard; and lastly, That the King should offer nothing upon her person more
then what he should gain by free courtship and entreaty. These Articles were
no sooner sent, but returned, signed, and confirmed; and we in confidence of
their performance accompanied the Bashaw on shore, where we were received with
all Magnificence imagniable: Mullisheg was seated not purposly for our
reception, but according to custom upon a Throne of three ascents, richly
covered with a Canopy of Gold, for the distribution of justice, he had taken
some admiration of her beauty at the report of Alcade Beigh, but had not
fansied it so great as to him now it seemed, for in such amazement was he
stricken at the first glance of her Sun-like beams, that not able to move
himself from his imperial Throne, he there sat as if he had been enchanted;
but raising himself, he descended and taking her by the hand, placed her in the
Chair, where his Royal Queen used sometime to sit, and after having uttered
several extravagant speeches in the praise of her beauty, told her that that
day she should sit as supreme Judge for the trial of all causes should come
before him, amongst the rest there were two Christian Merchants, one of which
for stealing Custom was fined one thousand Ducats, the other condemned to a
forfeiture both of Ship and goods, both which by her intercession were
released, and the life of an English Divine saved, who vainly endeavored to
convert the Moors pardoned; but as these causes were debating, who should come
in as a Petitioner but her beloved Spencer: 'twas strange what amazement seized
upon us two at the sight of that which we could take for nothing but his Ghost,
nor was his wonder less to see us there. I was just going to salute him in that
public place and to try whether he were a reality or a shadow, had not his
fair love detained me, and advised me to take some privater opportunity. Capt.
Goodlake was further persuing this story, then which Spinola confessed he never
heard one more delightful, when he was interrupted by a messenger from the Duke
of Mantua, who came to acquaint these two valiant Commanders, that the Duke of
Ferrara hearing that the Mantoves Army daily increased in numbers, and would in
short time arrive to such power as would be able to force him from his seige,
thought it more honorable to raise it himself, and before their numbers were
too much increased, give a second rout if posible, which effected, the conquest
of his whole Country would assuredly follow; that to the end he might find them
the more unprovided, he had filently raised his leagure, and that his vantguard
was already advanced within 12 miles of Marandola, that therefore the Duke of
Mantua had sent for them to desire their speedy Council what was sit to be
done, Spinola returned answer, that they would presently wait upon his
Highness, though he never went with more regret to consult of affairs which
tended to his honor, because he was forced to forgo the heaving of a story at
an adventure, which he most of all desired to hear.

THE English Lovers: A ROMANCE.
PART II.
Book I.
THE heat of the Sun which was now mounted to the highest of the Zodiak, made
the famous great Duke of Florence retire from his sport of Hunting, to seek
some cooler shade in an adjacent Wood, which with its Verdure seemed to invite
him, as well to delight his Senses with the various Odours of all sweet
smelling Flowrs which Nature had adorned that pleasant Soil with, as to please
his Optics with their variety of Dresses, which the frugal Earth had been
prodigal to bestow upon this fortunate Bower; but more especially to shade
himself from the too violent beams of the Sun, under the broad spreding leaves
of the Oaks and Sycomores.

But riding thus along with all possible delight, accompanied with a brave
Squadron of his Nobles, to seek further pleasure, or to enjoy the fruits of
their former sport, drawing near to their intended repose; a place, which for
its beauties might have deserved the presence of the chaste Diana, a shrill and
woman-like noise, pierced the ears of this famous Duke, who after having
listened from whence their Cries came, posted with his Pegasean Steed, and was
followed with no less swiftness by his Nobles, to the assistance, as they
supposed, of some distressed Virgin.

Being arrived at the place, they might perceive a villainous Bandetti to have
surprised a Lady of excellent beauty, and she not being able to resist his
force, was forced to submit her tender arms to be tied to the boughs of a tree,
which seemed to bow and yield obedience to her, whilst the hellish Ravisher was
preparing to sacrfice her Chasity to his lust; if the grand Duke at the Echo
of her cries made his horses feet strike Fountains out of the Rocks, with the
strength and swiftness of his running, he now flew faster then the winds to
rescue this distressed Lady, and to execute a just vengeance upon the impious
Villain, who durst attempt so horrid an iniquity upon one so like a Goddess;
but the base Catif-conscience of his own desert, armed with the wings of fear
and guilt, fled into the thickest of the Wood, and though pursued for some
space by the Duke himself, yet did those fair spreading boughs for the present
yield both shelter and security to the barberous Ravisher.

The Duke seeing it in vain to pursue him any further, returned to the place
where this beauteous Lady was, so near being made a prey to ugly and deformed
lust, whom he found to be unbound by some of his, and at the sight of him,
advancing toward him; whither being come, she fell down, and kissing his hand.
Noble sir, said she, For this act of succouring a distressed woman, must needs
assure me you are so; Give me leave before I pay my Oraizons to Heaven, or
render that sublime thanks I owe to you, to know to what worthy person of what
estate or degree I owe this wretched life, lest otherwise I prove a Heretic to
good Manners, and strive not to render a thanks worthy the person, since I can
never do it worthy the favor. Fairest of thy Sex, answered the Duke, since thy
Nobleness I need not question, whilst I see it written in thy Forehead, I
should want some of that worth which you impute, if I should deny your request;
Know then, noble Lady, I am styled by my Subjects, Duke of Florence, and Prince
of their Country, whose greatest happiness is, that it can boast to have kissed
your feet. The Prince of this Country (answered she) then thus low must I fall
to do a due Obeisance, and therewithal would have fallen with her face to the
ground, but was taken up by the Duke, saying, O Madam! daign not to this sordid
earth; so great an honor as to kiss those fair lips, which the Owner of this
ground would be proud to receive, and which the greatest Princes may boast a
Favor from. But, Madam, continued he, since my Stars have been so happy as to
make me the Minister to preserve your Honor from barbarous violation; let me
beg to know for whose sake the gods have thrown so great an Obligation upon me,
and how they came so much to forget themselves, as to let you by an adverse
Fate, be hurried into so great danger. Though your Highness (answered she) may
justly demand this as a debt due to the greatest Obligation ever was laid upon
poor distressed woman; yet to the favor of preserving that Jewel which I hold
inestimable; let me beg your Grace to suspend for some time your desires by
believing that my over-pressing grief, will not let me to fulfill them farther
then to tell you, that by the raging of the boisterous Seas, we were made a
Shipwreck on the neighboring Coasts; upon which, I was no sooner safely
landed, and had escaped the merciless Seas, but we became a prey to those
Villains, from whence your Highness rescued me. Cruel were those Seas (answered
the Duke) and ignorant of the great Treasure they supported, when they could be
so obdurate to injure so divine a Beauty: but for those Bandetties, who durst
in my Country (happy only in being your Ref^ge) attempt such Impieties; they
shall assuredly feel both the power and the justice of my Revenge: And
thereupon turning to the Lord Almerigho, Be it your care, said he, to get in
readiness a sufficient power to clear these Woods of those inhumane Robbers,
and in the mean time, let a Bando be published, porclaiming a Reward of one
thousand Crowns, to whoever should bring in the head of that soul and beastly
Ravisher. But, Madam, said he, I suppose that grief through which I see your
Beauties shine, proceeds from the loss of some friend, in this fatal Disaster.
It Is true Sir, answered she, I have lost a friend, who striving to defend me,
over-powred by numbers, I fear me fell by those Bandetties Swords, and cause
enough I have to doubt, lest my Maids Chastity be made a prey to some Ravishers
hot blood: We have delayed too long time to rescue her, answered the Duke; and
therewithal commanded some to go out in search of her, who soon found her tied
to a Tree, in the same manner as her Lady was, but as yet unprejudiced in her
honor; for upon the noise of the Duke's approach, fear had made the Villains
desist from their Design, and fly to seek their safety. The Maid at the sight
of her beloved Mistress, fell down, and embracing her knees, uttered thousand
of expressions of joy for her deliverance, with millions of blessings upon
those who were the Causers of it; but withal, assured her, that she feared her
friend who had fought so gallantly for her was slain, for that she saw him
desperately wounded, and pursued by at least a score of the Bandetti. The Lady
showed feeling expressions of grief in this relation; but the Duke endeavored
by all means possible to comfort her, withal telling her, that since Fortune
had been so adverse to her, as to cast her upon his shore, he hoped she would
not refuse the happiness to bless his Court with her presence. Her present
condition made her easily yield to the generous offers of the Duke: so she was
presently mounted in a stately Chariot, which was come there ready to attend
his Highness, who entering with her into the Coach, fed all the way upon her
excelling beauty, till the little blind god made his heart a prey to her
perfections.

Being arrived at Court, the Duke strove to entertain his strange guest with
such extraordinary solemnity that from thence might be easily perceived, that
he bore her no ordinary affection, the statelyest Lodgings in the whole Court
were appointed for her appartment, and many Ladies of honor ordered to attend
her, but she would suffer none to wait upon her but her own servant Maria.

Nor could all the sumptiousness of her entertainment or the sports purposely
invented by the grand Duke, remove or make her abate his melancholy humor,
which had so fully possessed her that the joy for the misery she had escaped, was
forgot in the great sorrow she felt; for misery she yet thought her self
involved in, yet still so transparent did her beauty shine through that veil of
grief, that it seemed rather as a foil to set of, then ablemish to her
excellencies.

The grand Duke had a great desire to know the person or quality of his fair
guest, but finding her so much over pressed with sorrow at any mention of her
story, his love and civility obliged him not to be troublesome to her, he
therefore addressed himself to her maid, and by gifts endeavored to draw that
from her which her Mistresses griefs would not permit her to relate, but she
having recived a charge from her Lady not to disclose any thing of her various
fortunes, he might as well attempted to have washed a Blackmoore, or done
things most impossible.

But whilst he both in vain persued his love to his fair guest, and his desire
to know her person and quality, an unlookt for accident discovered the last
unto him, for a Merchant by chance, having received from foreign adventures a
rich Casket of the most curious Jewels of the East, thought it his duty to
make the first show of them to his Prince, whose love promted him to command
this Merchant to attend upon his beautiful guest and freely present them to
her ^hoice, as things only fit to adorn so incomparable a Creature.

the Merchant according to the commands of the Grand Duke, attended on the
fair Mistress of his Princes heart, freely making offer to her of the most
precious of his Jewels, all which she slighted making choice of none but a
small Ring and that only because her civility obliged her not to reject the
bounty of so great a Prince.

But upon the return of Tignor Iacomo Bonaventuro, for so was the Merchant
called to the Grand Duke, he brought him a Jewel, which the valued above all
those of his Casket, to wit, the knowledge of the person of his beauteous
guest, assureing him that she was no other then that virtuous English Damsel
whose fame had spread it self from the Court of the King of Fesse over most
parts of the Christian world.

The Duke was extremely rejoiced that it should be his happiness to entertain a
person whom fame had reported so highly deserving, yet seemed somewhat to doubt
the Merchants relation, till he assured that the favor he received from her
(six of her men being rescued from the Galleys by his intercession) had so
ingrafted her Idea in his mind, that it was impossible ever to be eradi^ated or
blotted out.

This conference of the Merchans made the Duke as confidently believe what he
was likewise willing it should be so, and this belief sprung in him a desire to
hear a perfect relation of her particular carriages in the Court of that mighty
King of Fesse and Morrocco, which though he had darkly been informed of (...)
the General by the land Echo of her far resounding fame, yet he wanted that
certain relation which his now knowledge of her person made him desire.

He therefore commanded the Merchant to acquaint him with his knowledge of that
story, which after some excuses of not being able to perform his Highness
desires so fully as he might expect, yet resolving in obedience to his commands
to do his utmost endeavor; he thus prosecuted.

The Continuance of the History of the Magnanimous Maid.
IT was my fortune (dread Sovereign) to be in the Port of Mamorrah, when this
most excellent maid arrived with her Ship called the Negro in that haven, what
her entertainment was, fame has already so fully resounded in your Highness
ears, that I need not make any farther relation of it, no more then I need
give you a recital of the many pious acts, which by the powers her beauty had
gained over that Moorrish King; she did to many Christians, either whose ships,
goods, or liberties had been made forfeit to the Tyranny, or severer Laws, of
those Infidells.

Let it suffice your Highness to take notice of an adventure which surpasses all
that ever I heard, amongst other addresses made to her whilst she sat with
that great King upon the judgment seat there came in a Gentleman seemed to be a
suitor for the release of an English Ship, seized upon by the Kings officers
for some default in ^he payment of customs, it was my hap, so please your
Highness at that instant to be in the Court, when I might perceive a strange
alteration and distraction both in the countenance of that renowned maid and
this strange Gentleman who for manlike beauty and comeliness of Person exceeded
in my opinion all that ever I saw; Gods! how did their eyes dart wonders at one
another, a man might easily perceive in th^r co^^^^iences that they did know,
and yet did scarce believe they knew each other, so great was their distraction
that the Gentleman was not able to make known his desires, and certainly the
King had taken notice of their passion had (...) the Captain of the Negro who
equaly (...) this Gentleman taken him aside and informed (...) himself of that
happiness which before he (...) doubt of.

My curiosity drew me to that part to which they had retired, where I might
understand by the sum of their discourse, that this Noble Gentleman was the
occasion that drew that magnanimous Virgin out of her own Country, Not out of
any hopes ever to enjoy him but out of the excess of love which she had
formerly bore him, to fecht his Corpse (believed to be buried in Fiall) to grace
it with asumptious interment in England, but being arrived there, i^ was
reportde that his body was by the revengfull Spaniards, burnt and the ashes
thrown into the air, so that her intentions being frustrated, accident rather
then design had brought her into that Port.

The strangness of this adventure, made me draw nearer to hear the period of
it, and how this Gentleman so long believed to be dead was now again revived
which I found to be by his own relation thus, that in few days after the
departure of the fleet had recovered of those wounds which by his friend he was
thought to have died of, that the mistake arose from the death of one of his
name, whose ashes might in probability be so abused by the cruel Spaniards,
that himself not finding a passage directly for England had Embarked upon that
Merchantman now forfect, then bound for Mamoroh and so for his own Country,
that they were first taken by the Spaniard, and then soon after released by
that ship Negro, where seeing the owner (for so was this magnanimous Maid
esteemed,) in man's apparel he did think notwithstanding his disguise* that she
much resembled the joy of his heart, at those words his friend embracing him,
cried out how unfortunate were those wounds I ^hen received, for forcing me to
retire from the discovery of thee my Spencer, whose ^ight would not then have
been less dear to me then now, after so many chances and strange variety of
for^unes which according to the vulgar opinion do generally endeare affections;
but we must now, continued he, endeaver to manage our bus^ness wisely, for fear
least the love which I perceive the Moorrish King is inflamed with toward your
Mistress, should work your own and our destruction; go therefore and without
any further notice taking, urge your suite for the release of the English Ship
and goods.

The Gentleman did as his friend the Captain ^ad advised him, nor needed there
much entreaty to prevail in the Suite, whilst that fair Virgin interceded so
its grant; yet so closely, they could not conceal their loves and affection^ to
each other, but it was easily discerned by the enamoured Mullisheg, whose Rage
began to appear in his eyes against his Rival, which being perceived, both by
Spencer and his beautiful^ Mistress, they resolved, seeing they were no^ longer
able to conceal their Loves, freely to^ declare to the King, knowing that by
will^^^ concealment of what was so apparent, the^^ should but lose themselves;
nor could they (...) more if they revealed their Loves; the strange^^^
misfortunes of which, they thought, might move^ the Moor, if he had any sense
of Nobleness (...) Generosity, to grant them the enjoyment (...) their long
labored for desires.

Armed with this Resolution, the genero^^^ Spencer (taking opportunity when the
Moo (...) King was seated Gloriously on his Throne* which showed more
Replendant by being a^ do ned with that Paragon of Beauty) kneelin^ down begged
a Boon of Mullisheg, who having been always hitherto used to grace him for
(...) fa^e of his fair Mistress; bad him freely ask^ promising upon his Royal
word not to deny hi^ any thing. Show your self then most might^ King, said he,
what Fame has Renowned (...) for, and grant me this fair Virgin, whon neithe^
the envious Fates, nor boistrous Seas could (...) me of, to be my Wife.
Heavens! how did (...) Request (...) the Sable Mullisheg, his fier^^ eyes did
seem to dart forth Lightning, and gnash^ing his Ivory Teeth, leapt out of his
Chair (...) State, and shaking his Ebon locks, drew forth his Scimatar with
such violence, as if he would have clest assunder the two Poles, and made the
whole foundation of the Earth sink to its primitive Chaos: In sum, crying
out; And dares any insolent slave attempt to deprive me in my own Court, and at
the foot of my Impeerial Throne, of a Jewel I esteem above my Crown? Base
Caitife, thy Request has spoke thy death, and those audacious Accents of thy
ill instructed Tongue, were the passing Bell to thy deserved Funeral: nor will
I, by Heaven longer defer my Justice: His threatening words had been seconded by
as hasty a blow upon the head of the worthy Spencer, had not the magnnanimous
Maid interposed, and laying hands upon his Arms, cried out: Truce-breaking
Mullisheg, most undeserving the name of a King; who dare thus publicly break
and violate those Oaths thou so lately swor'st to? what faith can ever
hereafter be had in the word of a King, if the great Mullisheg who once was
famed for the most good and just of any of his belief, shall become a perjured
Wretch? And yet know cruel and unjust Tyrant, that if thou persistest in this
villainy* (for other I cannot term it) thou shall be yet further from enjoying
thy lustful and irregular will upon me, for I vow to all the gods I will not
outlive him a moment.

The fierce looked Mullisheg stood as it were astonished at her Generosity, and
amazed at the Majesty of her Anger, his trembling hand let slip his Sword, and
falling back into his Throne, he fixed his eyes upon the ground, and as if he
durst not look upon so much offended Beauty, sat rather like a senseless Statua
then a living Prince.

But after a small time of revengefull Cogitations (though his fury seemed all
the while to abate) he with a voice scarce demonstrating the least passion,
commanded his Attendant Guard to seize on the Generous Spencer, which they were
as ready to effect, as he to command; had not he resolutely determined (knowing
what would be the issue of a Moorish Prison) rather to sell his life at the
dearest rate with his Sword in his hand, then be starved to death in a
loathsome Dungeon.

The Guard seeing themselves thus confronted, and indeed repulsed, by one
single man, in the presence of their Prince, added fury to their Numbers, and
resolved all at once to suppress him, but with such strength and courage, did
he brandish his death-threatning Sword, that like those Rats who were to hang a
Bell about the cats neck, none durst be the first to approach him.

In the mean time, this worthy and magnanimous Maid, snatching from the ground
the Morrish Kings Sword, thrust her self amongst the thickest of the Guard, to
assist or defend her generous Lover; and at length, coming to the place where
he was, she like a Breast Plate clapped her self before him, endeavoring to
receive or defend all blows that were made at him; but the timorous Guard,
whether not daring to offend so much Beauty, or daunted at her heroic Courage,
made no further attempt upon her beloved Spencer.

The falling off of the Guard bred a pity of these two Lovers in the heart of
the Sable Mullisheg; yet he thought fit at first to make no show of it, but
calling them before him with an angry Countenance: Is it possible, said he,
that you should yet dare thus to affront me in my own Court, whilst it lies in
my power to inflict on you the most terrible of Tortures? Tortures (replied
this magnanimous Maid) know base Tyrant, the most fell Tortures that ever
barbarous Africa invented, can no more make us alter our fixed Resolutions,
then Kings are able to make the Heavens bow to do them Reverence: for know,
insulting king, our Loves are like the Center of the World, so strongly seated
in our hearts, that nothing but a general dissolution can shake them. Whilst
the King sat still amazed, and musing upon the Gallantry of the English Maid;
the Captain of the Negro who had not been idle all this whiue, but showed
sufficient demonstrations of his resolutions, to follow the fate of his
friends, adressing himself to Mullisheg; seconded her words with somewhat to
this effect. I need great King (said he) urge how infamous you will become by
breaking that faith which you so lately gave. Kings are easier incited to
action, which will add to their former Glory, then by words deterred from those
would eclipse, He let it suffice that you have now opportunity offered to do
an action which will make the great Mullisheg renowned through the world join
these two lovers hands, the story of whose constancy, were it but related,
would move compassion not in you only but in the very senceless Rocks, O let
not then Sir your intemperate love sway you above your honor, but as you have
been conqueror of mighty Kingdoms, let this action demonstrate to the world
that you are victor over your self and over your immoderate desires, so shall
foreign Nations that never yet heard your name Chronicle your virtues.

This speech of the Captains wrought so effectually with the inclining
Mullisheg that ^ising from his Chair, you have (said he) wakened in me that
heroic spirit; which can never suffer lust to triumph over virtue, Most
excellent Virgin, whom before we loved for the outward graces, but now admire
for that inward ornament of thy soul, thy loyal constancy, accept from my hand
thy long hoped for love; whose story having heard discourst, the greatest
riches of my Kingdom shall Solemnize your Nuptials; Were but the great
Mullisheg (answered this Magn^nimous Maid) of the Christian faith, I should
believe him a god on earth* but let this action however so celebrate his fame,
that he may be an eternal pattern to future Kings, to account it a greater
glory to be conquerours of themselves then of the greatest Empire.

Many other words passed to the like purport, and so the company for the
present withdrew to the Kings Palace, where shortly after all imaginable
preparations were made for the Solemnization of the Nuptials of these two
English lovers, but my occasions mighty Duke, calling me from thence, I could
not stay to see the marriage solemnized, though I afterward heard that it was
performed with wonderful state; and since your Highness tells me that she was
cast by shipwreck into your country; I have reason to believe that great
sorrow which at present overshadowes that nature which used to be civil,
courteous, and debonair, is for the loss of her husband who undoubtedly perished
in the all devouring sea.

The Duke was extremely delighted with this relation of the Merchant, but
especially with the hopes he had of the worthy Spencers loss, for he thought
that might facilitate the enjoyment of his beauteous Mistress, which he
resolved to leave no way unattempted to attain; and therefore commanded the
Merchant to go and present her with own of his ri^hest Jewels, valued at ten
thousand Crowns, knowing how much gifts do prevail over the soft and easy
natures of women; but though her civility taught her to accept the Dukes Jewel,
yet her honor inclined her to a resolution, that not a whole Dukedom should
tempt her to a violation of her chastity.

Scarce was Sig. Iacomo Bonaventuro departed to offer up his rich present, to
the fair hands of the fairest guest, but a messenger arrived to acquaint the
Grand Duke of Florence, that after the long continued bloody wars between the
two Dukes of Mantua and Ferrara, they had concluded a firm and lasting league;
and were resolved within two days to visit Florence, to make his Highness and
his whole Court and Country a witness of their late concluded amity. The Duke
received the Messenger with all honor due to one, who came as agent from two
such Princes, returning them thanks suitable to the honor done him by such a
visit, and withal giving order that his Court should be made to shine with Gold
and Pearls, for their more sumptuous entertainment.

Two days after the two Princes arrived, being met by the grand Duke, with an
infinite train of Nobility on horseback, three miles without the City, and so
with inexpressible state, conducted to the Royal Palace, where the Tuscan being
seated on his Throne, and the two Princes on each side of it, he endeavored to
make their welcome grateful, by telling of them, that the honor they had done
him in leaving their Courts to visit him, should be recorded as an everlafting
Trophy of their loves, and an eternal monument, of a firm and perfect amity
with them both. They returned an address suitable to his civility, by telling
him, that having happily composed their two long lasting differences, they
thought themselves obliged, to make a tender of their united league to his
Highness, as to greatest and most renowned Prince of Italy, selecting him as a
Royal witness of their blessed union: Nor must we, continued the Duke of Mantua,
forget to present unto your Highness this pair of Heroic Englishmen, who as
they defended us severally with their Arms, so they united us in their
friendship. I have heard indeed long since (answered the Tuscan Duke) of their
Noble deeds of Arms, loud fame having blazoned it into most Courts of
Christendom, but that they have been happy in reconciling two Princes, and
stopping that issue of blood, would in time have overflowed their Countries,
makes them more glorious then all their acts of Chivalry, and herewith he Rose
from his chair to salute the two English strangers, whom he perceived made
their addresses to kiss his hand, which he would by no means permit, but
affectionately embracing them, told them that persons of such great worth were
not to be received as Subjects, but Companions to Princes; and though he knew
no way to do it according to their deserts: yet he should study to find one
out, they humbly on their knees returned thanks to the Duke for his Noble
reception, excusing themselves as not deserving any such favor at his hands;
Your fame has already sufficiently spoken your deserts (answered the grand
Duke) but if any of these Noble personages will do me the honor to inform me
of some of the latter passages of that war, I doubt not but your actions will
best speak your character. 'Twas a kind of a pleasant strife to see how the two
Dukes hastened which should first satisfy the Thuscan, and do right to their
Champions, which at length being conceded to the Duke of Mantua Ferrara, being
retired he thus began.

The continuation of the story of the two Worthies Spencer and Goodlake.
AFter the fortunate arms of the Duke of Ferrara, assisted as himself
confesses, chiefly by that noble English Gentleman (pointing to the gallant
Spencer who had hither^o con^ealed his name) to whom I think deservedly he
attributes his whole success, had gained that signal victory over my forces on
the Plams of Merandola, I retreated with a small remainder of my Army, unto
that strong fortress, there to endeavor again to re^^^ire my sha^reted
B^ig^es, though with little hopes ever to appear again in the field, had not
the invin^ible arms of the generous Spinola, and thrice valient Goodlake forced
a victory from the Savoyards and Ferraresses, and joined their forces to mine,
whereby I not only gained their assistance, but other of my Subjects having
their hopes revived by their victory, came flocking in to offer their service
in assistance of my cause, which they now accounted nothing less then desparate.

But the Duke of Ferrara having advice of the great supply which daily came
into my Army, as he was encamped before my Metrapolitan City of Mantua, thought
it the better policy to raise his seige then to be raised from it, and I
suppose it was then debated in his counsel of War, that every delay did but add
more strength to my forces, that the City was yet well provided with all sorts
of provision, strengthened with a strong Garrison, and therefore not likely to
be surrendered or forced in a short time; that if he could once more give a
general defeat to my forces, the City would of it self come in without any
resistance, that therefore the Duke should immediately raise his seige, and if
possible provoke me to a battle.

This last conclusion was made a resolve, and such was their expedition in
advancing toward us, or the negligence of my Scouts, that the whole Army of
the Duke of Ferrara was scarce half a days march distant, ere I had any advice
of their motion, which put me at first into some distraction, but finding all
delays to be so many presenting perils, I immediately called a Counsel of War,
where it was with one voice advised and assented to, that I should with all
speed draw out my whole forces, and give my then Enemy Battle.

Thus were the plains of Merandola the second time to be made the stage whereon
we were to act a bloody Scene, for we had advice that the enemy not much above
four leagues off was entering upon them, nor was that large Champayne above half
a League distant from our Camp. The Sun had about two hours declined toward
the Western Horizon, when our whole Army, consisting of about five thousand
horse, and twelve thousand foot advanced, and somewhat before sunset, faced the
Duke of Ferrara's Camp, who with about the same number of horse and foot, had
seated himself with their backs directly opposing the morning sun.

'Twas strange that two so great Armies should lie so close together with so
little noise, neither being guilty of the least excursion during the whole
night, though I must confess I was advised by some, and that not without
reason, to have immediately fallen upon Ferrara's Forces, whilst I had the
advantage of the setting sun, which darted i'ts rays just into the faces of my
Enemies; besides, it was urged that the Feraresses, having had many long and
tedious marches without intermission, must needs be very weary, and so easily
be overcome by a fresh Army, but all those arguments were opposed by the
generous Goodlake, bravely encouraging me to scorn to take the least advantage
of a foe, whose numbers exceeded not mine.

The next day before the sun had displayed it is Golden Rays upon the Parched
earth, the Drums and Trumpets Alarmed both Armies to their bloody work, my
right wing of Horse I committed to the charge of the thrice Noble Spinola and
the gallant Goodlake, the left wing was committed to the charge of that worthy
Soldier, your Highness Subject, Signior Alonzo Tristamara, my self in person
Commanded the main body of the Army, and as if it were by joint consent, the
Duke of Ferrara had ordered his Forces in the same manner as I had done mine,
the English stranger Commanding the ^ight wing of Horse, Signior Giaspare
Piemontese that approved veteran the left wing, and the Duke himsself having
charge of the maine ^attel.

The Peales of Ordnance, like so many fune^al Knells, having rung out a fierce
Alarm to both parties, and the Drums and Trumpets ^ounded an encouraging
charge, our armies joy^ed just about the time when the sun showed ^is dewy
locks above the Caerulian Sea, and ^here as 'twere stood still to behold the
gallant ^ctions of these two noble strangers, who most ^esolvedly charging in
the heads of their troops, ^n few hours time with an infinite slaughter
in^erchangeably put to flight their opposites, whilst the main Battalias faught
with equal suc^ess, or indeed scarce at all, but amazedly beheld ^he incredible
actions of the two English men. Gods! How like flaming Comets did their
^rightned swords pierce through the Helmets of their enemies; the left wing of
the Duke of Ferrara's Army was forced to yield to the unconquerable Arm of
Goodlake, nor did ours find a milder fate in endeavoring to resist against
that of the other invincible, but yet unknown stranger, when at last Goodlake
leaving Spinola still to pursue the routed Ferraresse in the left wing, came to
the assistance of ours, with a full resolution to meet that gallant stranger who
had wrought such wonders against us.

But it happened that at the same time that Goodlake with a gallant party, came
in to the assistance of our left wing, his other magnanimous Countryman (though
then unknown of him to be so,) was gone with a select Brigade of Horse to repair
the ruins on the Duke of Ferrara's part, Heavens! how soon did their presence
alter the Scene of affairs, those who before were persuers, were now persued;
the gallant Spinola charging in the head of his troops, became a sacrifice to
the sword of Ferrara's Champion, and on the other side those troops which his
presence had before made victorious, now fled as fast as they before pursued,
before my valient Commander. In this variety of fortune did the battle continue
on both sides, for the whole day those two noble strangers, seeming as it were
the souls of the two Armies which moved those great bodies at their pleasure,
till after Sunset the approaching darkness of the night, rather then any other
cause, made us both willingly sound a retreat, as well to rest our wearied
bodies, as to compute^ our losses.

It Is almost incredible (worthy Prince) what infinite slaughter this day made,
those vast and wide-stretching plains seemed covered with the bodies of the
dead; nor could either Army boast above half the number which they had that
morning seen alive and well: Strange fury of men, worse then that of wild
beasts, for these are never ravenous upon those of their own brood, but we
ambitiously strive to destroy one another!

The next mornings light called up the two Armies again, to put a final pe^iod
to this bloody Tragedy, the Trumpets and Drums had sounded the alarm, and now
only attended to change their note to that of another fell and dreadful
charge, when a Herald from the Duke of Ferrara's Army brought me the ensuing
Letter.

To the Puissant Duke of Mantova.
THough we have no reason at all to doubt the strength or courage of our Army,
or to think our cause so bad, as not to venture our Subjects bloods once more
in a fatal conflict; yet when we consider, that the blood which has been shed
in this unhappy contrast, would not only have watered but overflowed those
lands we contend for, we cannot but with tears lament that vast effusion of
humane gore, and with that some happy remedy might be found out to give a
Period to these unhappy discords, rather then by further hazarding our Subjects
lives, increase both the score and the enmity. Think not hereby that we mean to
forgo the left of our right, but this we promise upon the word of a Prince,
that if for preventing further Tradegies, your Highness will make choice of a
Champion to combat ours, we will willingly hazard the loss of that which we
think we may justly call our own, upon his single person, being content that
the conquest of either shall end all differences between us.

D. Ferrara.


This Challenge which I may in some regard call pious (as I understood
afterward from the Duke of Ferrara) proceeds wholly from the generous
entreaties of that worthy stranger, who moved out of a noble pity, to see too
neighbor Princes in that cruel manner, sacrifice their Subjects lives, to
either their disdain or ambition for a thing scarce worth the contention,
freely offered his blood to end the difference, which Ferrara confident of his
valor, as readily accepted.

Nor can I, tell you mighty Prince, with what joy I received his offer, though
I was doubtful when I least had need) who to make choice of for the defender of
my right, for no sooner was the Challenge read in my Council of War, but the
thrice valient Goodlake, falling on his knees, earnestly entreated to do him
the honor to make him my Champion, which he added, he desired not so much out
of a confidence of his own strength or valor, but that he might rerevenge the
blood of the most Noble Spinola, for between them two was there contracted an
inviolable friendship.

I readily assented to his request, nor was there any of the most daring that
murmured at it, either because they had had too much experience of the valor
of the enemies Champion, (for we all believed the stranger) or because they
thought none but him able to cope with him, or else because they thought it
convenient that the other being a stranger none but a stranger should combat*
him. So I immediately returned this answer to Ferrara's Duke.

To the thrice Noble Prince the Duke of Ferrara.
THe pious care you have to avoid the effusion of Christian blood, mak^s me
accept your challenge, being as willing to save the lives of my Subjects, as
you have been ready to sacrifice both yours ana mine to deprive me of my right.
My Champion shall meet yours armed at all points, like a Knight at Arms, in
the Plain between both armies, Hostages being first on both sides given to
perform conditions.

D. Mantova.


A Herald from me being sent, with this returned, with speedy answer that the
Duke of Ferrara, would immediately deliver into my power as Hostages the Count
Lozenzo Porzcachy and Signior Giasparo Piemontese, if in exchange of them I
would send the Count Piedro Giovanni, and Signior Alonzo Tristamara, which I
willingly agreed to, and they were on both sides fairly delivered.

Exchange being thus made, and all conditions agreed upon, the sound of the
Trumpets called forth the two Champions into the field; the first that appeared
was the Challenger, mounted on a black Steed, and his Armor so perfectly black
that there appeared not any thing about him which was not wholly sable, save
only a small green Scarf tied about his wast; my Champion was on the contrary
appareld all in white, being a furniture I purposely gave him to denote the
justness and nocency of my cause, yet his own fancy lead him to incircle his
ar^es with a mourning Scarf.

Having made two or three traverses about the field, the signal was given,
which the two Combatants received with so much readiness as I never yet beheld
the like, their fiery Steeds breathing forth nothing to all men's appearance but
death and destruction; yet ran so fiercely at each other, that they seemed to
threaten the shaking of the whole Universe; yet these two gallant spirits at
the breach of there Lances upon each others helmet sat like two Rocks unmoved
in their Saddles, when furiously drawing out their Swords they made us believe
that the Combat between Ajax Telamon, and the valiant Hector, was again
renewed, such was the ponderousness of the strokes that they would have forced
the Heaven, assaulting Giants to have bowed under them.

But how soon was this storm changed into a calm. These two Champions who but
just before, with such violence and fury assaulted each other; on a sudden to
the amazement of us all threw away their Swords, and leaping of their Horses
cast themselves into mutual embraces: We were doubtful, at first what to think
of this so strange adventure, some were of opinion that they still fought,
affirming that it was the manner of England, not to stand overlong dallying
with their Swords, but by closing try out the issue of the fight by strength;
others believed that by some accident, they had come to make some happy
discovery of themselves to be two friends, and were now embracing (which was
indeed the truth) and renewing their ancient friendship, nor wanted there some
to believe that, one party had yielded to the other, though they could not
guess which; yet either in the interim believed themselves betrayed.

The agreement made that none should stir, from their post, to assist or
encourage either Champion, made us with the greater patience await an issue,
which after no short time of expectation was brought to either side by the
combatants themselves. Good lack being arrived at my Tent, I was very
inquisitive to know the reason of that strange amity so suddenly agreed upon
between two soes, who I believe went with as equal regret and hatred to the
seild, as did Paris and Neoptolomus, when the one vowed* to revenge the death
of a father, the other of a friend and brother.

But the entreated me to restrain my curiosty, till such time as I could call a
general Counsel of War; to whom he desited publicly to declare the event: I
assented to his request, and having summoned all the chief officers of my army
together, seats being taken according to order, he thus began to relate the
story.

That I have, Noble Mantoveses, ever since I entertained your Dukes service,
behaved my self both as became a soldier and Commander, I hope there is none
here will gain say, nor deny that I have always readily ventured my life to
the greatest hazards, perrils and dangers, which the various chance, and
fortune of this war has cast before me; and yet I think never any of you
before heard me so much sound forth my own praises: nor do I now make this
Exordium, either to angment my own, or diminish your worth, but to tell you
that I can now no more hazard my blood for you, that life which before was a
butthen, is now grown precious to me, and I may say that through both yours and
the Duke of Ferrara's Armies, are still in the field as opposites, I have by
your wars gained such a requiem as just a period to my further labors. For I
have found my friend for whose only sake or rather for whose supposed loss I
became your friend, and Ferrara's foe; let your contracts then mighty Sir end
in our friendship, and as we have showed you an example, through away your
blood thirsty swords, and turn your emnity in to embraces.

He would I believe have proceeded farther to our admiration, had not the
arrival of a Herald from the Duke of Ferrara's Camp, requiring speedy audience
obstructed him, who being admitted addressing himself to me, told me that he
believed my Champion had already prepared me with what he came about; that his
Master inclined by the strange accident which had happened between the two
Combatants, was resolved likewise to lay aside his offensive arms, and embrace
me with those of an eternal friendship; that to that effect he had sent me
such conditions, as he thought could not in honor refuse. That he was ready to
yield up to me all those Lands in contention, save only the small Town and
Castle of Torre Necova, which standing on the other side of the River, were
known anciently to belong to the Dukedom of Ferrara, that if I refused these
offers, he doubted not but in the end, I should have reason to repent the loss
of so fair an opportunity to conclude an everlasting amity.

The conditions were so honorable, that it had been a dishonor in me to
refuse them; so with the Herald, I returned an honorable messenger of my own
to acquaint the Duke, that if he would be pleased to grant me an interview
between both Armies, I doubted not but we should have occasion to free our
Countries from further Alarums by concluding a firm and durable league.

My messenger was honorably received, my message accepted, the interview had,
and all things easily agreed upon, and thus (Noble Prince have) I in brief
related to you how those wars, which had cost the lives of so many thousand of
our Subjects, were in few hours space by the mediation of those worthy
persons, terminated in a happy and lasting peace, a witness whereof we are come
to make your Highness, your whole Court and people.

The Grand Duke was extremely delighted with this relation of the Duke of
Mantova uttering forth innumerable praises in honor of the English Nation, and
studying how he might honorably requi^e these Noble persons, who had wrought
so much good in Italy, when there entered into the presence Chamber, a Gentleman
of a gallant aspect, bearing upon the point of his sword the head of one, whom
it appeared he had overcome.

Being come within hearing of the Duke, kneeling down he made this adress to
him. Show your self (Noble Sir) that bountiful Prince to strangers, which all
the world reports you, by paying to me that debt which your Proclamation makes
due to him who could bring the head of the Chaptain of Bandetties, which thus
low I present to your highness feet: We should show our selves ungrateful
(answered the Duke) and much ^etrogade from the honor of Sovereign Princes,
should we deny you your well purchased reward; ^ut let su s farther beg to know
to what Country man we owe this service. I am mighty Prince (said he) by birth
an Englishman; an Englishman answered the Duke, must my Court erect then
farther Trophies to the glory of that renowned Nation. Command the two
Champions hither, for certainly they must be all three allied as well in blood
as in their Noble actions.

A messenger quickly hastened Spencer and Goodlake into the presence, who no
sooner entered were, but Ruffman, for he it was looking steadfastly upon them,
and knowing them to be his dearest two friends, ran and embracing them, cried
out to the Duke, most Ilustrious Prince, you now owe me nothing, to show me
this is a reward beyond your whole Dukedom; and therewithal returned again to
embrace his friends, and they him, with so much ecstasy that all the presence
perceived the affection was not common.

But the earnest desire Spencer had to hear some new's of his dearly beloved,
whom he had lest aboard-ship with Ruffman, and bound for England; made him
desire leave of the Duke to retire with his friends, which being easily granted
they having found out a privacy, he with great importunity demands of Ruffman
what was become of his beautiful spouse, or whether he had deserted her and
sent her alone for England: deserted her, (replied Ruffman) if all the Devils
in Hell had conspired together they could not have possessed me with so much
ingratitude; but pray Sir Arm your self with patience, for I have the
tuthfullest story to relate that ever your ears yet heard. My constant
misfortunes (answered Spencer) have been so sufficient proofs of my patience,
that nothing I believe can now shake it; the Gods grant it answered Ruffman for
I fear it will else totter, when I shall tell you that the next day after you
were by the unkind winds parted from us, we were thrown among the Rocks on this
Coast of Florence; but escaping the furies of the Sea, ran into a greater Sea
of miseries: for set upon by some bloody minded Bandetties, I was enforced by
their number, to permit your beantious Mistress to be snatched away by one,
whose looks dencted rape and murder, nor was it in the power of any but a
deity to rescue her; yet if she be murdered, I have at least given this
satisfaction to her Ghost, to have revenged her on the villan. These words
notwithstanding, his firm resolution could do no less then for present deprive
the generous Spencer of his senses, to which being again by the care of his two
friends revived; they began to comfort him with hopes that the Gods could not
permit such an unparraleld p^ice of virtue and beauty to suffer such outrage,
but would rather themselves descend from Heaven to her succor.

In the mean time the grand Duke thought all the entertainemnts he was forced
to give to the two Princes of Ferrara and Mantua tedious, because it debarred
him from giving a visit to his fair Mistress, whose beauty had gained such
power over his heart, that all things else seemed to him but a trouble and
vexation to him, night therefore approaching he hastened the two Dukes to their
appartment, and that he might give the fire of his love some fuel to feed on,
having selected out some trusty Musicians, he retired under the Chamber window
of his Super-excellent guest, where he caused the ensuing Song to be sung.

1.
LEt not those beauties which adorn that soul,
And make it the Worlds wonder
That passion blame which Kings cannot control.
Nor Jove with all his Thunder;
Great Hercules for Omphale's dear sake,
Did lay down's club, and up the spindle take.
2.
Had that lascivious Trojan youth whose luss,
Bred such a fatal jarr
Seen thee; proud Troyas yet had not been durst
Nor felt that ten years War.
Fair Hellen still had kept the Grecian shore,
And be left her, thy beauties to adore.
3.
Or had the Cretan God beheld those eyes,
Those darting eyes of thine
He had descended from the azine skies
To make thee half divine.
And would those other fancied beauties flee,
Calisto, Danae, Semele, for thee.
4.
Then blame not me that I such power Divine,
Have no power to withstand;
Who dares deny obedience to that shrine
Which does all things command.
That passion must be surely just, when he
That wants it is justly taxed of blasphemy.
The Song ended the Duke adressing himself close to the window, hoping that it
might invite the Mistress of his heart to look out, but she was so overwhelmed
in melancholy thoughts that she neither listened to it, nor believed it
adressed to her, which made the Duke second that first Song with this.

1.
What boots it for me to have command
Or sway a Scepter with my hand,
What boot's it I a Sovereign Reign
Whilst I am forced thus to complain,
Yet get no answer but disdain.
Kings may their Subjects rule, but love
Will over them the Tyrant prove.
2.
What am I better to be high,
Since though my state reached to the sky;
Or stretched it is arms from shore to shore,
I here must fall down and adore,
Yet yet, disdain and nothing more;
Kings may their subjects rule, but love
Will over them the Tyrant prove.
3.
No height or greatness can avail
Or'gainst the charms of love prevail,
A heart once heightend by desire
Does still advance those sparks up higher,
were kindled first at beauties fire;
And so consumes till gentle ease
Come from what first was the disease.
4.
Then fairest stranger pity show
Let not a Prince in vain thus woo
You with that sovereign balm abound
That made me sick, may make me sound
For none but you can salve this wound;
Oh make me partner of this skill
And mix not with such good such ill.
5.
But I alas do crave in vain!
That pity which you will not deigne,
Grant but a glance of your fair eyes
And that alone will me suffice
To crown my thoughts above the skies:
Kings may their subjects rule, but love
Will over them the tyrant prove.
This song made her know that both this and the other were adressed to her, and
that the grand Duke was the person who had taken the pains to give her this
Serenad, she therefore thought her self obliged, in civility to return him some
answer, at least to thank him for his profuse endeavors, but resolving first
to seem not to know him; opening her Casement she roughly demanded, who it was
that presuming to take upon him the person of their Prince, durst at that
season of the night, presume to disturb her rest. I am Madam (said he) the Duke
himself, come to tender the humblest of my services to you; though my forrowes
(answered she) are a degree above what music can bate, yet I must needs
consess my self excessively obliged to your Highness, that are thus pleased to
abase your self, for the entertainment of so poor a guess, beyond all the
degrees of Noble Hospitality. Both I and all others (answered the Duke) are
bound to do Homage to so great beauty, and might I but hope to find love a
reciprocal to that duty, and service that I owe your fair self, I should
account me of all Princes most happy. Is it love then my Lord (answered she)
that prompted you to this pains? Alas mighty Sir, how much do you debase your
greatness, to cast an eye upon so mean and unworthy a person as my self, yet
Noble Prince, consider and let the thoughts of my meaness restrain in you those
wild desires. Thou art all goodness and all beauty (answered he) and that makes
thee greater then I am, oh good my Lord, answered she, dedeceive*** not your
self by thinking to gain that from me by your statteties, which all the power
of men, nor Devils, shall not force from me, desist therefore my Lord from
this enterprise, which will in the end so much dishonor you; and think not my
Lord, that because you preserved my chastity from the villainous Bandetti, that
you have any right to violate it: at these words she was going in, had not the
Duke recalled her, by saying dear Madam stay, and at least grant me this
request, that your Gentlewoman may relate to me the continuance of your story
that if you will not grant me your love, yet I may have liberty to admire you.
In that (said she) or any thing else I may with honor, I am ready to serve
your Highness and so departed.

The Duke remained inwardly vexed for his ill success, so that he could hardly
rest, yet he somewhat comforted himself, with hopes of the pleasant story he
was to hear next morning; and therefore no sooner was the Sun mounted an hours
course, but he sent to his fair Mistress to mind her of her promise, who
immediately sent her Gentlewoman to wait upon his Highness, who carrying her
into an Arbor, fit by reason of the privacy of it, for such a purpose, she
thus began.

The continuation of the story of the Magnanimous Maid.
YOur Highness having already informed me, that you have heard so far of my
Ladies story as arrived to the promise of the Moorish King to unite her hand
(as she had already fixed her heart) with her beloved Spencer I shall not need
to make a new recital of it, but proceed to what follows.

The some urgent affairs of State, rather then the present season of the year
induced Mullisheg; some few days after his Royal promise was past for the
marriage of this Noble and Peerless pair of constant Lovers, to remove his
Court to the famous Sea Port Town of Algiers, whether induced as much by their
own inclination, as the earnest desires of the Moorish King, he was accompanied
by the generous Spencer and his lovely Spouse, whilst the worthy Goodlake took
charge of the Frigate to carry her round by Sea to the same Port.

The grand Duke seemed to be somewhat transported at the name of Goodlake, for
he remembered that the Duke of Mantua had given the same demonstration to his
Heroic Champion, which made him doubt that the other stranger who had done
such famous acts on the part of Ferrara, which was the gallant Spencer, the
husband of his beloved guest, but for the present smothering his imaginations,
Maria thus continued.

Being all arrived in safty at Algiers, the Moresco King having dispatched his
most important affairs of State, was put in mind of his promise, to solemnize
the Marriage rig hts between these two Noble Lovers, which he readily assented
to; himself in presence with his Queen gracing their Wedding, the ceremonies of
which were performed by that English Priest whose life my Ladies intercession
had saved, and costly banquets being prepared at the expense of the Morocco
treasure; there wanted no magnifience which might indeed befit the marriage of
the greatest Princes.

Many days did these Lovers, in the full enjoyment of conjugall bliss, live
with all imaginable content in the black Kings Court, but fortune which
delights in nothing but varieties and changes, soon altered the Scene of their
happiness, and overclouded all their joys by the relapse of King Mullisheg,
who again bewitched with the love of my beauteous Mistress, out of hopes that
he might now sooner gain his desires on her, fell back from that course of
virtue which had made him glorious, and by a violent passion, sought to entrap
her honor.

Nor did perverse chance think it enough, that the great Mullisheg thus
deviated from all the rules of honor, but to make the misery of these two
constant Lovers more complete, the Queen of Fesse, and Morocco, a Lady of a
haughty spirit and not enduring an imagined injury, whether moved out of a
jealousy of her husband, or out of a real affection, was inspired with the
same unruly passion toward the worthy Spencer, as the King her husband was
toward this lovly Bride my dear Lady. Thus did both these Princes strive to
rob two of the most constant and most deserving souls, that ever History made
mention of, of that joy and content which they had yet but enjoyed in the
blossom.

The King who had most power to act, and indeed to force what his lust prompted
him unto, having heard some secret whispers of ouritention to escape his Court,
and getting aboard our Ship, sail home to England, gave order to Alcade Beigh,
to cast a curious eye upon the gennerous Spencer, and my Lady; and if possible,
not to be at any time absent from them, or at least from one of them, so that
all hopes of getting away by stealth was taken away from us, for indeed some
such thing had been determined of, the passion of Mullisheg, being daily
observed to increase more and more, and like a blazing Comet to portend some
prodigious effects: Nor was that of the Lady Tota, his Queen to the worthy
Spencer, utterly hid from us, though she carried it with more policy and
privacy.

Our stay and my Ladies continual being in the presence of the lacivious
Mullisheg, was like fire adding continual fuel to the flames of his lust,
which in the end burnt so strongly, that he resolved by one means or another
to quench it, though by the doing of it, he forfeited all the rules of honor
and hospitality, broke his word given, and murdered those guests he had sworn
to preserve; yet in what manner to attempt it again he knew not, those brave
and Noble, repulses he had before received from her, disheartened him from
attemping it upon her own person, he now thought it fitter to use a Proxy and
therefore resolved to make the virtuous Captain Goodlake, the Baud to his
lustful desires, this determination he of all best liked, yet knew that such
was the goodness of that person, that his very looks would force a blush from
the most savag* Moor, should he but mention to him a thought so vile and
unworthy, he therefore resolved to take the Roman Poets advice, and write those
things which his shame would not let him speak, and accordingly after having
some few days graced the Captain, with extraordinary and unusual honors, he
privately delivered to him this Letter.

The High and Mighty King of Fesse and Morocco. To the Captain of the English
Ship Riding in our Port.
WE have always found thee a Person deserving our greatest honors; nor have
our favors been distributed to thee with a niggard hand; Yet now, if lies in
thy yower to do us a favor, which shall wreath thy front with Gold, and make
thee Command in all our Territories, next to Our Self, embrace then that Fate
which shall make thee for ever Chronicled in thy Native Country, by complying
with our desires. We love thy fair Country Woman, the beautous Elizabeth, and
must enjoy her by thy means, which if thou performest thou gainest our love, if
not, look to be hewne in pieces by the fury of our enraged King. Thy own Fate
direct thee.


Heavens how was the generous Good-Lake startled at the reading of this Letter,
he no sooner came to those Words Love, and must enjoy by thy means, but tearing
it in two pieces and throwing it away, cried out begone thou treacherous Paper,
bespotted not with Ink, but with the Person of Basilikes, Aspes, and Dragons;
Certainly, had a whole Parliament of Devils, had all the feins and furies sat
together in a Synod, they could not in an age have devised an mischief to equal
this, this wherein thousands of mischiefs are summoned up together, to Strumpet
a chaste and virtuous Lady to injure him, who prizes and vallues her honor far
dearer then his life, to set a friend to betray his dearest friend, and rob him
at once of all his joy's; To blast that name of mine, which Heaven has
hitherto preserved in the scrole o^ the virtuous, with that ignominious
reproach of Pardarisme. Could any but a Moor whose wickedness must exceed the
Devils, have spur^^ so many mischiefs in one thread? But what (continued he)
should he mark in me might make him think me fit to act such villainies, what
could he prognosticate in this visage, that he should find there an Index to
such impiou^ Treasons? I have known this Face dart forth ^ look, has made my
enemies shrink beneath it but never knew it accused into a blush for falceness
to it is friend; Nor shall it ever in despite of perjured Mullisheg and all his
Torments.

Whilst he was uttering these exclamations against the Moors perfidiousness,
he was incountred by the valiant Ruffman his Lieutenant, whose looks made show
of no less distractions, then those which had overshadowed the countenance of
the generous Goodlake, yet was the Captain about to disburthen his thoughts^ to
him, had he not been prevented by Ruffmans telling him, that he was just now
come from the Queen Tota, who by threats and promises had been importunately
conjuring him to Solicit Spencer, to grant her the enjoyment of his loves.

This Story no less confounded the generous Captain, then his Lieurenant was
startled, when at his desire he took up the pieces of his torn Letter and read
it, their cases being both alike, they thought fit to resolve on some course
for their own safety, and the preservation of their friends honors, which
whilst they were confusedly consulting about, they were encountered by the two
loyal Lovers, who in their angry fronts could discover no less then a direful
storm; the meaning of which they were as ^nquisitive to know, as they were
doubtful to believe their relation, till they were convinced by the
unresistable testimony of Mullishegs Letter.

It was in vain now to let amazement take ^lace of advice, they therefore began
to con^ult how to escape this cloudy tempest, which hung so threatningly over
their heads, but in a business of so great consequence their opinions were
confused, and indeed they knew not what to do, till my magnanimous Mistress
turning to her beloved Spencer, (and Women they say have the sharpest wits in
such exigencies) My dear Friend, said She, desperate diseases must have
desperate cures, there remains no way to escape the violent lust and fury of
the Moorish King and Queen, but by a violent hazarding our own lives: Yet
before we come to make use of force, we must work with disimulation; you my
dear Soul said I must learn to counter feit an affection to the Queen, whilst
I seem to smile upon the lacivious King, and doubt not but we shall in short
time find a means to escape: the effecting of which, we must leave to the
wisdom, courage, and sole Management of these two their Agents, who I know by
sound experience will not fear death it self, for our safety.

They all seemed to applaud her Counsel, but because the place was somewhat too
public for such a debate, they retired to a greater privacy, where they at
large consulted of what they resolved, afterward to put in execution when
opportunity should offer it self.

Nor was it longer the importunity of Mullisheg forced them to anticipate even
their own thoughts; For he thinking that Goodlake dallyed with him, with open
Threats enjoined him to effect his purpose, or expect the effects of his fury,
nor was the Queen less impatient to have her Lascivious thoughts satisfied by
the noble Spencer, which made these two worthy friends resolve now to use their
utmost art and power, for the delivery of those two loyal Lovers.

Goodlake in the first place, therefore desires the King that an appartment
might be of purpose appointed, as a thing necessary for the bringing his
desires to pass, withal assuring him that he had gained the absolute consent
of my beautous Mistress, to entertain him in her embraces, the night following;
but that she desired that to cover her blushes, that he would be pleased to
approach her in the dark, when she would not fail to entertain his Majesty with
the greatest caresses of love. In the mean time, Ruffman had acquainted the
Queen, that by reason of the sudden change of Lodgings, where with the two
Lovers were yet unacquainted, he would bring her Majesty into the Chamber,
where she should all night lie linked in the Arms of the generous Spencer, and
he receive her as his beloved Bride.

This lascicious pair were both highly contented, in the expectation of their
next nights enjoyment, which being approached, Ruffman silently conducts the
Queen into the Chamber, where the King expected to find his beauteo^s Guest;
and she being disrobed, and lying ^^pecting the renowned Spencer; the King
(...) by Goodlake conducted in thither, who (...) means satisfied them with an
(...) ^^^faction of their desires, and yet (...) bodies chaste.

These two thus lodged there, yet remained the hardest part to act to avert the
dependent Tragedy; The curious eyes of Alcade-Beigh like those of another
Argo's, still waited so exactly upon the generous Spencer, or upon his fair
Bride, that it was impossible for them to pass the gates together; nor could
the worthy Spencer at first persuade my lovely Mistress to leave him to his
better stars, and go with Captain Goodlake, Ruffman, and the rest, to secure
her own Person: But at length overpowred with Arguments, That it must be the
only way to procure all their safeties, she vowing, that if by the next morning
he came not safe aboardship, she accounting him slain, would assuredly follow
him in death; consented to go.

Captain Goodlake having got the Kings privy Signet, and the Military Word, for
that night, under pretense of passing up and down from lodging to lodging for
the better accomodating of the lustful Mullisheg, with my fair Lady, we easily
with them passed the Court Gates, and so securely to the Seaside, where we
found a worthy Gentleman Mr. Forcet, with the Boat well-manned and armed, ready
to waft us aboard whether being happily come, our selves we hastened it back, in
hopes it might return laden with the generous Spencer, whose presence we now
only wanted.

But long did we in vain expect, what we so earnestly desired, and much longer
it seemed, by how much more we did desire it; for after our departure, the
noble Spencer found himself so haunted by Alcade-Beigh, that he could not
possibly pass any venny of the Court, which so enraged him, that he was once
resolved with the sudden death of the Beigh, to rid himself of so burdensome a
Companion, but the great danger in this, having for sometime restrained him, he
at length thought of a slight which much better served his purpose, for knowing
that Alcade-Beigh was not ignorant, that the King his Master had lately
attempted always possible to enjoy his lovely Guest, and that he had the
promises of Goodlake to effect it; he resolved to dissemble a passion, as if he
then really had her in his lustful embraces. The Beigh who had heard him utter
somewhat to this purpose, not only left him to his own guard, but freely
proffered him passage through the Court Gates; Fondly imagining that his
absence would make the King rest more securely with his Spouse.

But Spencer being passed those Gates, there yet attended him a more unluckly
fate, for missing his way to the Sea on that side the Town, where our Boat
waited for him, he unadvisedly ran upon the other, which lying open to a small
Citadel, ingarrisoned by Spaniards, not far distant, makes the Moors
constantly keep a strong Guard, both of Horse and Foot there; a party of about
forty Foot were usually set upon a Bridge, not above two hundred paces from the
Town, amongst these Spencers unhappy stars first led him, by whom he was
commanded to stand, and show a reason of his being there so late; but he now
first sensible of his error, would have returned without returning any answer,
which they perceiving about eight or ten in number swiftly pursued him, who was
resolved upon no conditions to yield himself Prisoner; and therefore with his
Sword in his hand turned upon them, resolving dearly to sacrifice his Life, or
to force a passage through them to his Spouse.

But the slaughter of half of that number, which first pursued this thrice
valliant Hero, making the remaining part to cry out for more assitance, the
whole Guard was allarum'd and great numbers both of Horse and Foot came
thunding in upon this single Gallant, who yet endeavored to make an obstinate
resistance; several of the faint-hearted Moors being forced to fall under the
power of his revengeful arm, in the presence of their Captain Ioffer-Bassa who
stood admiring at the noble courage of this Person, whom yet he knew not. But
at length encompassed on all sides, the worthy Spencer wearied with dealing
wounds, was surprised by his enemies.

But he was yet happy in being thus a Prisoner, for being brought before
Ioffer-Bassa, a Person truly generous; he was accosted by him with all possible
civility; the Bassa as if he had been bred in civil Europe, and nor in
barba^ous Africa, Telling him, that though he could not but wonder at his noble
deeds, yet he must be infore'd to perform the office of a Subject, by keeping
him his Prisoner, though he could rather have wished fortune to have laid open
some way for his escape, and not rendered him a Captive to him, who could only
love and honor him, but not help him: By this nobleness (answered Spencer) I
am confirmed you are Ioffer, chief Bashaw to the Great Mullisheg, whom I have
always found full of worthy and gallant thoughts. And I now know you answered
the Bassa, for that brave Englishman, so highly graced in the Court of the
mighty King of Fesse and Morocco; My Master, which makes me the more admire,
that in requital of his favors you should thus slaughter his beloved Subjects,
by which you have made a double forfeit of your life; for the outrage committed
against his Guard at the dead of night, is death in it self; but those you have
slain in the conflict, makes it exceed all bounds of Pardon; For death,
answered the Gallant Spencer, it does not at all trouble me; but I have some
private thoughts torment me, more then ten thousand tortures could; and
herewith this brave Soul fetching a sigh, could not restrain some tears, which
the thoughts of his beloved Spouse made gush out. When the noble Bassa seeing
his discomposure, commanded the Guard to depart, and leave the Prisoner alone
with him.

The Guard readily obeyed the command of their General, when he taking
opportunity from the Solitude addressed himself to his Prisoner in these
generous terms; Sir, (said he) though I am a Moor, a Nation strange to you
Christians; yet, think that I can be noble; but in you I have observed such
strange contrarieties, that I cannot tell well how to reconcile them; for when
I consider your mighty actions and late greatness of your Spirit, when my men
flew before you like dust before the wind, I cannot but admire at your present
passion, and justly wonder why such a small effuse of blood, let out by these
slight wounds, or the pale-fear of grisly death should draw a tear for such a
Noble eye; Thou most worthy of thy Nation (replied Spencer) do not so much
mistake me, to think that wounds, blood, death, or all tortures imaginable,
could force one drop from hence; but that I now suffer under, as far exceeds
all torments that ever the wicked art, or wit of Man invented, as Hell does
Heaven in pains. This it is, that like the burning Sun extracts from my
declining Soul, this dewy and effeminate morsture: Sir, (answered the Bassa) if
I have yet gained in you an opinion, that I dare be noble, impart to me your
sorrow's, and if any thing in my power can assist you, though it be with the
hazard of my life, rest assured I will perform it. Your Nobleness most
Illustrious Bassa (answered Spencer) obliges me to relate my misfortune, though
I must despair of remedy; yet if you have a heart not wholly composed of
Adamant, it must needs melt it, to consider my misery; and think then Sir, if
you have ever loved, or if ever you loved one so fair, so constant, so chaste,
as my dear Spouse; whether it would not confound you, and make whole Oceans of
tears flow from your eyes, to know that for your sake she was betrayed to a
black and remediless-fate? I confess (answerred the Bassa) It would perplex a
well-blassed Soul; but how can this be your condition? were not all your joy's
but lately consummate, by uniting your Souls, according to your own manner of
marriage, and were you not but yesterday both honored in the highest degree,
by the virtuous Mullisheg? It Is true, worthy Bassa, (replied Spencer) he
honored us at first too much, but at length his lust outway'd his honor, and
as if his Soul had been of a darker Eye then his Face; he sought to take away
that he had given me, and rob me of that Jewel 1 prize far above my Life; but
the fates were yet happy unto me, in that I found means this night to convey my
beauteous Spouse, the Captain, and Lieutenant, and others aboard Ship, and now
my self intended to follow them, but missing my way fell amongst your Guard,
where wonder not that I performed wonders, and durst single oppose my self
against your multitudes; for it was the impression she had left upon my heart,
made me act things beyond a man. But Sir, (replied Ioffer) since she is safe
aboard, recall your noble spirits, and let not your own fates thus distract you.
Ah! generous Sir, (said Spencer) the sting of all is yet behind, I at her
parting from me, swore by the honor of a Gentleman, and by all the vow's and
loves had ever past between us, that if I survived, I would visit her aboard
before the morning Star appeared, which she seconded with a solemn vow, that if
I did not she should certainly esteem me dead, and not Heaven it self should
hinder her from following me to the Grave, This Great Bassa is it; Fear of her
safety not my own, that drew these tears from a Soldiers eyes. 'Twas strange
what noble pity this relation bred in the heart of the thrice worthy Moor:
Noble Sir, said he, you have indeed told me story would move the very Rocks to
pity, and that I may let you know, all moral virtues are not wholly and only
seated in the hearts of Christians; Go freely, pass to your Love and preserve
her Life, I will not desire you to return, but if you do not remember, this
Head of mine goes in exchange for yours, which I cannot lay down in a better
service. My worthy Lord was so startled at this high generosity of the Moors,
that he knew not what answer to return, nor indeed how to accept his so
obliging proffer; but at length considering it would be the preservation of his
dearest Spouse, he resolved not to refuse the Courtesy, but withal desiring
the Bassa to oblige him by some solemn Oath, to return at an appointed hour:
No, (replied Ioffer) it will be sufficient, if you give me your word to return
by that time to morrow, that the Sun shall be mounted to the Meridian: Let
God's and Men (answered Spencer) conspire to make me miserable if I fail one
Minute; Let me then conduct you, said the Bassa, past all watches, and
therewithal himself in Person brought him to the place where the Boat did
attend him, who received him with an inexpressible joy.

The Discourse between the Bassa and Spencer had spent the greatest part of the
night; so that before they arrived at the Boat, it was near break of day, and
before any discovery could be made of them coming toward the Ship, day was
absolutely broke, and the Sun even ready to advance it is head above the
Cerulean Confines. My dear Lady, with infinite impatience had all this while
expected the coming of her Spencer, according to his promise; but finding him
not yet appear, concluding him dead; she began to utter such miserable
lamentations as are impossible for me to recite; and calling for an Hourglass,
resolved as soon as that poor moment of time was spent, either to behold her
dear Spencer safe, or follow him in death.

The last minutes were now running, when with a full mouth of joy one of the
say lors calls from the Topmast-head that the Boat was coming toward us, and
that he did plainly discern the generous Spencer sitting in her stern; 't was
my good fortune to carry this news first to my Mistress, who entertained it
with such a rapture, that her joy now put her into no less an ecstasy then her
grief before had done; but having past over that discomposure, which at her
first hearing these glad tidings had seized her, she issued out of her Cabin
to entertain her Spencer, with a joy suitable to the love she bore him,

It Is impossible for me (mighty Prince) to tell you with what joyful, and what
obliging expressions she entertained him aboard; but how soon was all her joy
turned into a super-abundant sorrow; for he having a great while listened to her
loving expressions, without having returned any answer, at length to her
earnest entreaties, gave this fatal one? Alas! my dear Soul, now I have seen
thee, I must again leave thee: These Words were like a Thunderbolt, which
almost before their noise was heard, bereft my dear Lady of her senses, who
fell entranced at the feet of her beloved Spouse, but our art and care soon
recovered her, at which she seemed somewhat displeased, crying out: Wherefore do
you in vain endeavor to ruin me, for if that Tongue that gave the wound do not
again give present cure, not all Esculapius his art can reprieve me from death.
Alas! my dear Love (said Spencer) arm your self with patience since I must
depart, and endeavor not to make me forfeit by our passion, my own and my
Countries honor, the Faith and Reputation of a Christian all which are pawned
for my return. What will the Moors say? and how justly may they say, That we
that are Christians make great boast of Faith, but they alone do honorable
good and virtuous works.

My Mistress, and indeed all of us sat in a manner intranced to hear Spencers
Resolution, and a dull silence had invaded us all, till Captain Goodlake brake
it by telling him, That he would do well to loose us from that labyrinth of
doubts, wherein his discourse had involved us by a plain discovery of the
reasons, that moved him to this Resolution to return: I am content, answered
Spencer, and there withal related what I have already told your Highness,
happened between him and Ioffer Bassa, concluding that if he should leave the
life of so generous a Person, to be sacrified to the fury of the Moorish King,
he should for ever be a Scandal to virtue and goodness; I must confess
(answered Goodlake) 't was nobly done of the Moor; but what is the Laws of
twenty thousand of those Infidels, to one that is a Christian: You have now
(said he) Liberty and free way to your Country, and will you refuse to take the
advantage, that Heaven has lent you? But as if you scorned their gracious
bounty, betray both your self and us to voluntary death, or bondage; leave,
leave Sir, this fond Resolution, and let us make use of this prosperous Gale,
which so Smilingly invites us to Sea. These Arguments were seconded by Ruffman,
and my dear Mistress, withal the persuasions their desires could furnish them
with; My Lady clasping her Arms about the Neck of her beloved Spencer, and
crying out, Oh Sir! do you now then prize my love no better, then to rate it
beneath the friendship of a Barbarous Moor, or can you to save him, betray and
leave me to an assured death? Can you thus reward the Pains and Travels I have
undergone for your sake; Alas! (said the generous Spencer) do not thus torment
me, I must and will praise my Honor, and the Faith, and Reputation of a
Christian, above whatever the Earth can yield: Shall Fesse report hereafter, to
the shame and disgrace of Ours, and all other Countries of Christendom, to the
scandal and ignominy of our Faith and Religion, tht a barbarous Moor should
exceed us in Nobleness and Gallantry, No! I will first ten thousand times
Sacrifice this Life, rather then make so great a so feit. In sum, when
nothing could prevail to procure his stay, we were enforced with patience to
suffer his departure.

But to return to the King whom we left lasciviously stealing embraces from his
own Queen; so strongly had imagination wrought with him, that he really
believed he had all that night clasped in his Arms my fair and bea^to is
Mistress, and so great was the pleasure, which he thought he had enjoyed, that
having according to agreement stolen from her before day, his impatient bosom
not able to smother his super-abundant joy, communicates it to Alcade Beigh who
very confidently affirms that he had had^ h^lping hand in that nights pleasure;
for he had by a cunning device got Spencer by his own consent out of the Court
Gares, and commanded that neither money no^ entreaties should prevail ^r his
re-entrance, least by some suspitio^s jealousies, he should be emboldened to
disturb his Majesty's rest; The King in requital of his care for the
furtherance of his delights; presently made him one of his Council, and withal
promised farther not to forget his diligence.

But after so great a Calm, Storms usually ^ollow; whilst the King was thus
priming himself in his delights, a Messenger came hastily in, and kneeling
down, desired his Majesty not to ^e offended, if he brought him news that he
^eared would displease him; Whatever it be answered the King, it cannot sour
this nights ^weetness, therefore speak it boldly: Know ^hen Mighty Sir,
(continued the Messenger,) That by virtue of your Royal Signet the English Lady
with the Captain and Lieutenant are his night past the Court Gates, and are
safely^ ot aboard their Negro: away, away, cried ^he King, thou art deceived;
Go see Alcade, ^or we left her but now sleeping on our Royal ^ed: What I affirm
answered the Messenger, ^swear by my Head to your Majesty, is most ^ue; else
let my Life answer my presumption. ^or did the King doubt it to be so, when
Al^^de returned, and told him that there was in ^e Bed neither English Lady nor
any Lady else, ^or the Queen as soon as the King had left her ^as retired into
her own appartment: pleased ^^^ewise with the imagination, that she had en^^yed
the generous Spencer.

The King was extremely enraged at this news, ^^d the more because he believed
the Captain ^^d betrayed some dissolute common Strumpe^ (...) his Bed, but his
fury was much increased when he was informed by a second Messenger, that
Spencer being left behind, had without the Word or Signet passed the Gates,
It Is most true, Answered the King, and thou Traiterous Villan (said he, turning
to Alcade Beigh) that have been a Sharer and Conspirer with these English to
rob us of our Jewels and Treasure, shall as sure as we are King of Fesse and
Morrocco pay the forfeit of thy Treacherous Head. Alas! Dread Sovereign,
(answered the Beigh) 't was willingness to do you Service, which made me commit
this Error: Villain, said Mullisheg, thou lie* 't was bribes; therefore
dispute no more, but let our Guard load him with Irons, and turning to the
Messenger, but is Spencer then escaped, said he? No dread King (said he) for
though at the Bridge with his Gyant-like blow's, he sent several of your
Majesty's Subjects to their graves; yet when by a lou^ Alarm we called the
whole Watch to ou^ assistance, he was forced to yield to our Numbers, and is at
present Prisoner to the Great Ioffer Bassa. It Is well then, answered the King,
for upon him will we revenge all our injuries, go said he to his attending
Guard, command our Bassa to bring him, overpressed wit^ Irons to our Royal
Presence.

The Kings have always some suc^ attending sycophant about them, wh^ like dull
Angels are ready to assist upon all bad occasions, The Messenger that went to
command Ioffer Bassa to produce his Prisoner, fled with a too officious speed,
for there wanted yet several hours to the time of the promised return of
Spencer, and the Bassa knew that the Kings fury was like an unresistable
torrent that would brook no delay; However he nobly resolved to go into the
Presence, and if nothing else could appease the Kings anger, freely lay down
his Life for our safety; but with all dispatched, a speedy Messenger to the Ship
to tell us that we might now safely ^ail away, but Spencers meeting him
prevented his coming.

The Bassa being come before the King, he with a frown which sufficiently
denoted his inward passion, demanded of him how he durst, when he had sent his
express Command that he should produce his Pri^soner, come without him. Mighty
King, answered the Bassa, had you with me beheld his unparrarel'd Prowess, and
withal seen his passions, you would like me pity these disasters, wherein his
unhappy Stars have involved him, Insolent Villain (replied Mullisheg) presumest
thou to prescribe us Rules, we will know no pity for an injury of so high a
Nature, and more then our revenge we have vowed his death; therefore go fetch
him forth. Let me at least (replied the Bassa) for all the services I have done
you, beg of your Majesty to spare him but some few hours; still dare thou
(said the King) Capitulate with us, we tell thee once more that the least delay
is death; Then know mighty Prince (said Ioffer) That he was my Prisoner, and is
so still by promise, for I presuming that such Noble valor could not be
lodged alone without those other virtues; Faith and Honor gave him free
liberty to go to his Ship, only upon his promise to return before the Sun felt
any declension toward the West; Nor do I yet doubt, but your Majesty will find
that Nobleness in him which I have presumed. Foolish Bassa, said the King, thus
to jest away thy own Life, but jest thou did not, you are all Conspirators
against me, and by Mahomet shall all receive the rewards of your Treachery;
Could thou think that a Stranger so remote both in Country and Religion,
being imbarqued at Sea free from our hands, and in the embraces of his sweet
and lovely Bride, His Captain and Sailors all aboard, and fortune it self
supplying him with a fair and prosperous Gale, would expose all these to
voluntary dangers, and himself to a certain death, only for a verbal promise?
At least let your Majesty (replied the Bassa) grant me Life but till the hour
be past, and if he comes not, I shall willingly embrace death, and glory that
though a Moor, I have excceded a Christian in Nobleness. No fon^ Fool (replied
the Moorish King) thou shall not live a Minute, and therewith gave present
order to his Guard to see him put to Death.

Just were the Executioners laying hands upon the Worthy and Renowned Bassa,
when Spencer who had made all possible have to Land, entered with his own Life
to save that of the generous Moor; his presence struck such amazament into the
Great Mullisheg, that confounded with the Gallantry of the Action, he sat for a
good space as one intranced, during which time the Bassa embracing the generous
Spencer with tears in his Eyes, told him, that he was now sorry he had made him
promise to a return; for he had thereby deprived himself of a fame which would
have lasted longer then any Ma^solean Monument, and that he rather wished that
he had broke his Word, that he might have died for so Noble a Person, for now
said he to redeem a Life which I could willingly have Sacrified in so glorious
a Cause, you come to an assured Death. And it is that I come for (said the
generous Spencer,) And to force the King your Master, though he takes away my
Life, yet confess me honorable.

Whilst these and some other Discourses to that purpose passed between those
two Noble Spirits, the King recollecting himself, Commanded Spencer to be
brought before him, And with a Tyrannical fier^eness told him, That he had
misprizing all his gracious favors violated his Laws, infringed the Peace of
his Country, Alarmed his Watch by Night, slain several of his Subjects; and
lastly, having Robbed him of infinite Treasure had stolen to Sea, by every
Circumstance of which he had made a forfeit of his Life, which all the Riches
of Europe should not Redeem; I confess (replied Spencer, with an undaunted
courage) that I have done all thou chargest me with, save only the stealing thy
Treasure, which though I could not do, because thou gave it; yet finding thee
unworthy in thy intentions toward us, I scorned to take with me that which
would have been the price of my dishonor, and therefore of all thy Gold and
Jewels would not permit one dram to be unbarqued; as for that Death thou
threatnest, know proud Mullisheg, I am glad I owe thee nothing, but what I have
in my ability to pay, if my Life be forfeit in taking it, thou take nothing
but what I came purposely hither to tender. Art thou so resolute (answered
Mullisheg) however out of pity to thee, we will yet propose thee one way to
save thy Life, nor any other way ^ast thou to effect it, send then to thy Ship
and surrender up to me the Captain and thy fair Spouse, or otherwise by all the
Rights of our Holy Prophet thou shall not live an hour. Dishonorable Tyrant
(replied Spencer) know that I so much despise both thee and thy Tyranny, that
were there on one side all the Tortures that either Turks or Devils ever
invented, threatened to be inflicted on me; and on the other side, were thou
Commander over all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and should lay at my Feet all
their Crowns and Scepters, and make me Monarch of the whole Universe; rather
then yield up the basest of my Ship-Boyes to become thy slave, much less betray
my Spouse to thee and to thy brutish just, I would endure ten thousand Deaths;
and so thou shall (cried Mullisheg) prepare to torture him.

At that Word my Lady (attended by the Captain, Lieutenant Forcet, and my self,
who never had forsaken her) having followed her beloved Spencer, with a full
resolution to die with him, or for him; entered the Presence, and falling down
on her knees before the Moorish King; Behold cruel Mullisheg, said she, if thou
do delight in blood, but spare that of my beloved Spencer; and in it is stead
I here present thee mine, and those of all my Train, to make a flood instead of
his small Rivulet: The generous Spencer was extremely distracted at our sudden
appearance, and turning to us, all you have wronged me (said he) above injury,
and how sufficiently to express my just anger, I know not, for in you I die ten
thousand Deaths, that could otherwise have tasted but one; and then turning to
the Moor: Mighty King, said he, show your self at least to have somewhat of
humanity, by dismissing these to their Ship, and since my Life is only forfeit,
take but that, and at my Death, I shall proclaim you merciful. Oh! no great
King (said my Magnamous Lady,) It were injustice and not mercy to take his
Life, and spare mine, since what he did was only for my sake and safety; or if
he have committed any fault (said we altogether) let all our lives serve as so
many victimes to expiate his Crime, and appease your anger. Alas! you need not
plead for death, (replied Mullisheg) you shall all assuredly die, but
especially you treacherous Captain, on whom I will execute such a revenge as
shall make future generations to read it: I came not hither great King (said
Goodlake) to be daunted with your threats, but freely to offer my Life (who am
only guilty) to redeem my friends, take then this Body and tear it in pieces
with the most exquisite Tortures that the Savagest Barbarians did ever invent?
and spare but the rest, I shall endure them contentedly. Thou shall not doubt
it, replied the Moor; but villain said he, what infamous Strumpet was it that
thou betrayedst to our Royal Bed. For that Mighty King (said the Queen, who as
well by the several Circumstances, as by Ruffmans Information was confirmed,
she that night enjoyed the King) I must with your pardon excuse him; for having
had private advice of your designs, I wrought him to my purpose; nor was it any
other then my self whom you last night embraced.

The King was visibly seen to abate somewhat of his fury at this relation of
the Queens, and began to consider that the action in the whole contexture of it
was honorable, that he had endeavored to do wrong, but had not been wronged;
That his lust had led into a road of evil actions, where he was riding with a
Carrier, to the loss of that fame which had once proclaimed him good and just,
that it was time for him now to stop, which he resolved to do, and therefore
with a smiling countenance looking toward us, he with a generous passion cried
out, shall lust then still have the prevalency over me? or shall all those
virtuous deeds, for which I have been so long renowned in Fesse be utterly
exiled, shall the Christans still have the honor to be sole heirs to goodness,
and we Moors barbarous and bloody. No (said he rising up from his Throne, and
taking my Lady by the hand) renowned English-woman, I once more give thee back
to thy Husband, and if he think it no dishonor, beg him again to accept of our
grace and favor, and in recompense of those wrongs we endeavored to do him,
render we will thee such an ample Dower as shall renown our bounty, provided we
may but procure your Pardon.

Thus was all our sorrow turned into sudden joy, the worthy Captain Goodlake
was by the King prised amongst the Chiefest of his favorites, for his faith to
him, Zeal to the Queen, and constancy to his Friends, the generous Ioffer Bassa
for his Nobleness to the renowned Spencer, was by the King created Viceroy of
Argiers; but Alcade Beigh, though he was released from Prison, yet was banished
from Court, as a Person who had encouraged and fomented.

Yet for all this, we had some reasons to fear that Mullisheg would again fall
into a Relapse, which made the Noble Spencer earnestly and frequently desire
his leave to visit his own Country; and he at length being no longer able to
deny him, yielded to his Request; and loading our Ship with the Richest
Commodities his Kingdom afforded, Himself accompanied us aboard, where after
some days magnificent Feasting he left us, and we took leave of the Barbary
Shore.

But the fame of our great Riches was gone before us into most parts of
Christendom, which had made many Pirates come out on purpose, in hopes to make
us their pray; two days after we had been at Sea, we espied a great Sail,
which made directly toward us; nor would we seeing but one Ship alter our
Course; or with addition of Sails endeavor to fly from her, so she came easily
up to us, and by the roughness of her salute, (for she immediately powered into
us a whole broadside) gave us to understand what she was, and for what intent
she came.

We had before provided our selves for resistance, and so soon returned her
courtesy in the same roaring terms; she had first spoke to us in, but she
relying upon the number of her men, thought it more advantageous to close with
us, then to fight at distance, which made them twice resolutely board us, but
were both times most courageously beaten off by the valor of the renowned
Spencer, Goodlake, Ruffman, and Forcet, and at length so discouraged that
Spencer and Goodlake hoping to make a Prize of their Assailers, armed with
their Swords and Targets leaped aboard the French Pirat, (for of that Nation it
was,) that before any could follow to their assistance, the ships were by a
sudden Storm severed, nor could we withal our art or endeavors again reach
the French Ship.

I need not tell your Highness what lamentations my Lady made, to be so
strangely and suddenly deprived (as she had just cause to fear for ever) of her
worthy Husband. Your Highness has seen some effects of her grief, as well as
been informed how that some Storm cast us upon your Coast, where after we had
escaped the dangers of the Seas, we fell into the hands of the Bandetties,
where we had like to have been robbed of our honor, a Jewel we prized far
above any the Sea had devoured, had not your Highness rescued us. Here Maria
ended, and the Duke seemed very much affected with the Story; but he was
inwardly displeased at Spencers being in his Court, (for he was confirmed by
many circumstances it was he,) fearing least his discovery should wholly
obstruct his love; he therefore resolved to Cloister up his fair Guest, in the
most private part of his Palace; but this being no time to consult what to do,
having presented Maria a Jewel in recompense of her trouble, and sent by her
all commends to his Mistress; He went to entertain the two Dukes of Mantua, and
Ferrara who expected him.

The End of the First Book of the Second Part.
THE ENGLISH LOVERS: A ROMANCE.
Part the II.
Book the II.
THE Court of Florence abounded in all imaginary delights daily, and before
unfound-out inventions, being put in practice as well for the entertainment of
the two Dukes of Mantoua and Ferrara, as for to endeavor to divert that
Melancholy, which had so strangely overwhelmed all the faculties of the soul
of this Dukes fair Guest; yet all that mirth which seemed pleasant to others,
seemed tedious to her, and so absolutely had sorrow for the loss of her beloved
Spouse, taken possession of her heart, that even all common and known remedies,
proved but Corrasives to her grief.

Oftentimes would she be overheard to lament to her self, and with bitter
exclamations to cry out; Cruel and unjust fates! was it not enough that you
made me suffer so many unspeakable disasters, and dangers, before ye would
permit me the enjoyment o^ my beloved Spencer, but must you still continue to
be perverse by depriving me of him almost as soon as you gave him? Miserable
me! who am no sooner married but divorced; almost as soon a Widow, as a Bride;
permitted only for some few days to enjoy the greatest happiness earth could
afford me, and then on a sudden involved into the deepest gulf of sorrow
possible! How much better had it been for me to have yielded up my life in the
all devouring Sea, where perhaps I might have met my Spencers fate, then to
outlive him, and become thus miserable by his loss^ Oh! that the fates would
yet be so merciful as to cut my thread of life, that I might follow him to the
other World, since they would not permit me to enjoy him in this.

These and such like lamentations she would often in private Echo out, whilst
her maid Maria would frequently interrupt her, and endeavor to comfort her, by
telling her, That her beloved Spencer might still be alive, that the fates
themselves could not be so unjust to two such loyal and constant Lovers; that
she had less reason now to despair of his life, or of her finding him again,
then she had when she believed him buried in Fiall, and his ashes strowed in
the Air: To which, and such like accents of comfort, this afflicted Lady would
reply, Away fond fool, and can thou think then that Pirates are turned
merciful, or that my Spencers arm is able to resist so many hundred villains,
who by continual practice had been inured to blood and cruelty, with the sole
assistance of the Noble Goodlake; and yet suppose them to be victors, we must
then suppose them to be left alone in a wide and almost sinking Vessel, to the
mercy and power of the merciless Seas; O strive not thus to flatter me with any
hopes of his life, but since he is assuredly and utterly lost, endeavor not to
stop that current of grief, by which only the fates have now left me a way to
follow him.

Whilst they were one day in a Discourse of this nature, a noise of the
running of horses just under her window, made Maria first, and after that her
Lady look out, the one out of curiosity, the other to feed her melancholy,
rather then divert it, where they might behold several Gallants with their
Lances in their rests, ready to run at the Ring; they stood marshalled in two
equal Ranks, which might give the Spectators to understand, that they were in
that sport Opposites, being twelve in all, whereof six were chosen by the Duke
of Ferrara, and six by the Duke of Mantua, the two Dukes themselves standing in
the head, and ready upon the signal given, to run the first Carreire in their
own persons; which the Judges of the sport (the lots being drawn who should run
first, which fell upon the Duke of Ferrara,) immediately gave; and Ferraras
Duke mounted on a milk-white Steed, richly caparisoned, and shining with Gold
and Pearl, himself clad in a Suite of sky color Damask, imbroydered with many
curious flowers and fancies, with a large feather of the same color in his
hat, advanced to the place from whence he was to begin his course, where
weaving his Lance thrice over his head, in token of challenge to Mantuas Duke,
he set spurs to his horse, and with a gentle and easy Carreir, took the Ring
with so much dexterity, as was admirable to the Spectators. The Duke of Mantua
who had beheld the good success of his adversary, next fitted himself for the
course, and issuing from before those Cavaliers his adjutants (mounted on a
Dapple-gray Steed, that Heaven-resembling color, his caparison as well as his
habit, being all composed of green silk, imbellished here and there with a
resplendant Diamond) he came to the place appointed, where waving likewise his
Lance three times about his head, made his course, in the midst of which his
horse being somewhat too fiery, gave several bounds, which made not only the
ignorant spectators, but even those Cavaliers who were of his part, fear that
he would miss the Ring, but he finding it must be done by a quick motion, by
reason of his Steeds unruliness, setting spurs to his horse, took it with so
fierce a Carreir, that many, though they saw it upon the point of his Lance,
doubted whether he had it or no. The next who run were the Count Lorenzo
Bentivoglio, on the part of the Duke of Ferrara, and the Marquis of Mirandola,
on the Duke of Mantuas, who both having performed their course with admirable
agility, were followed by the Conte of Villa Corta, on the part of Ferrara, who
having missed the Ring with the point of his Lance, very dexterously let it
fall, and drawing out his sword took it at its point, to the no little wonder
of the spectators. He was followed by the Cavalier Iacomo Amadei, who
notwithstanding his horse, as he almost came to the end of the course, seemed
to stumble, and indeed in a manner to fall, yet he took the Ring with an
excellent dexterity. The Cavalier Alfonso Bernardi, and the Cavalier Thomaso
Medico, both performed their courses with applause; but Girolamo Picolhomini,
and Fernando Contarini, who followed them, both missed the Ring, yet received
no less shouts from the spectators, then those which had performed best, though
I suppose they were not at all pleased with them. The Count of St. Severino was
the next, who ran on the Duke of Ferrara's side, who deservedly gained the
applause, not only of the spectators, but all the Noble Actors; he was
followed by that renowned Cavalier Giovanne del Monte, who to his great
vexation, was this day most unfortunate; for after he had made a most graceful
course, and was now ready to take the Ring, his girts broke, and his horse
withal giving a bound, both himself and saddle came to the ground; But now
appeared on the part of the Duke of Ferrara a person, which made Maria recall
her Mistress to the window, at least to show her a person who resembled her lost
Spencer; she, though somewhat unwillingly, came to behold him, but having
looked upon him, she immediately fell into a swoon, whether overpressed with
joy, believing it to be her beloved Spencer, or with grief, at seeing so near a
resemblance of her lost Spouse: Maria endeavored by all means possible to
recover her, and by reason of this accident, was hindered from making a farther
discovery, though she was absolutely confirmed that it was the generous Spencer
(as indeed it was) both by a little green scarf which he wore upon his left
arm, a badge her Lady had given him at his first going to Fi^ll, as likewise by
a person whom she judged to be Goodlake, and whom, had not her Ladies weakness
hindered her, she would have found some means to have spoken to, but her
faintness increasing, she was forced to retire with her.

The generous Spencer was this day of sport and triumph, as he had ever been
since his forced separation from his beloved Spouse, clothed all in black,
nothing of any other color appearing about him save only the small green
Scarf, but the extraordinary grace wherewith he sat on horseback, and
dexterity wherewith he took the Ring, put the whole Company that viewed him
into admiration: not was it performed with less skill and gallantry by Captain
Goodlake, who was the last that ran on the part of the Duke of Mantua; yet was
the Victory given by the Judges of the field to the Duke of Ferrara's side,
because of the misfortune which happened to the Cavalier Giovanne del Monte,
who thereby mist the Ring.

Yet all persons were well contented, and so accompanied the Grand Duke to his
Palace, where a sumptuous and magnificent Feast was prepared for them at which
the Duke of Florence did more observe Spencer then ever he had done before, and
both by his reserved melancholy, and mourning weeds, but especially by his
generous countenance and actions, concluded him infallibly to be the Spouse of
his fair Guest, and Goodlake undeniable the same person who was Captain of the
Negro, yet he resolved absolutely to detain these two Lovers from the knowledge
of each others safety, till such time as he had attempted all ways for the
gaining of the Love of his beautous Guest, which he was not wanting by
continual solicitations to endeavor to do, and thought all time tedious which
he did not spend in her company, resolving as soon as he could with civility
leave the two Dukes, to visit her.

We left her in a swoond at the sight of her beloved Spencer, from which being
by the care of her maid Maria revived, clasping her in her arms with a fervent
embrace (scarce knowing where she was) And is my Spencer yet alive, said she,
or art thou but his shadow? Alas! Madam, said Maria, I am neither your Spencer,
nor his shadow, but this I dare assure you, that both he and Captain Goodlake
are alive, and at present in this Court, and much I am mistaken if Rufman were
not there likewise to see their justing. Oh me! said her Lady, what a dream
have thou and I been in. A dream Madam, replied she, certain I am that both my
eyes were open, and all the faculties of my soul awake, when I beheld your
generous Spencer with a grace admired by all, take the Ring, and him followed
by the valiant Goodlake; nor do I doubt Madam in few days but to find an
opportunity to assure him of your safety, for I can perceive both by his
dejected countenance, and sable habit, that he as much mourns your supposed
loss, as you do his. But do thou then think it possible, said she, that the
Gods should be yet so favorable to me, as to preserve my Spencer both from the
fury of the Pirates, and the Seas? Madam, the fates could not, answered Maria,
be so unjust as to deprive you utterly of him for whom they had made you endure
so many strange and adverse fortunes, and run through so many perilous
adventures, therefore cheer up your Spirits with an assurance that your Spencer
lives, and that you shall again within few days enjoy him.

In this Discourse was the beautous Elizabetha, and her maid Maria, when the
Grand Duke entered her lodgings, and perceiving in her countenance somewhat more
alacrity then usually, he began to hope that time would wear away her
melancholy, not at all dreaming that she had made any discovery of the safety
of her Love, or his being in that Court; he therefore accosted her with many
Obliging and Amorous expressions. To all which she returned in answer, That the
Vows she had made to the generous Spencer, were not yet, not ever should be
cancelled in her breast. You wrong both your self, and your beauty Madam, said
the Duke, to dote upon a thing that is not, for though I were not fully
sensible of the cruelty of the French Nation, especially of the Pirates of that
Nation, yet I cannot believe that a sinking Vessel could escape that storm,
wherein yours, which was a sound one, perished; and though it may be alleged,
that they might likewise escape the furies of the Sea; yet it is rather to be
supposed that the French ship perished in the vast Ocean, rather then that it
was driven nigh any shore that might preserve them: Aflict not then your self
Madam, continued he, with a vain hopes of that which can never be obtained, nor
repine not at what the gods have done for your greater benefit. If the gods,
answered she, have been so unjust as to deprive me utterly of my Spencer, yet I
will, nor cannot be so unjust to his memory, as so soon to blot out the
remembrance of our Loves, even before I can be certain whether the fates have
been so unmerciful as to deprive me of him or no; not do I know whether it
would savor more of levity in me, to entertain another Lover before I was
surely informed I had lost him; or of cruelty in the deities to part two such
constant Lovers as we have hitherto been.

The Duke was about to have returned answer, and to continue his persuasions,
when one of his Pages entered to acquaint him that a messenger pretending
weighty affairs attended for Audience, which made the Duke for the present,
though unwillingly, leave his Mistress, till he could have some fitter time to
prosecute his desires.

Being come into the presence, the Messenger on his knees presented his
Highness with letters, which he opening found to be from his Admiral Pedro de
Venturo, giving him advice of a great victory obtained by him, against the
Viceroy of Argiers, who had long infested those Seas with a great Fleet both
of Ships and Galleys. The Messenger farther by word of mouth acquainted his
Highness, that Signieur Pedro Venturo was coming himself with the Viceroy his
prisoner, to lay his whole conquest at his feet, that there were likewise
several Christian captives whom he had released, who were coming after to
present themselves to his Highness, and that by reason of an accident which
befell his horse, he once feared the Admiral would have arrived as soon as he,
if not before him.

The grand Duke was extremely rejoiced at this victory, against the common
enemy of Christendom, and immediately sent to acquaint the two Dukes of Mantua
and Ferrara with it, who accompanied with a great retinue of nobles, made all
haste possible into the great Hall of the Palace, to entertain the victorious
Admiral, who soon after arrived, and was received with all those expressions of
joy and respect, which could proceed from a loving Prince to a deserving
Subject.

Usual complements being past, the grand Duke commanded Venturo to relate the
manner of his fight, and how he obtained that signal victory, and the noble
Admiral having composed himself, his countenance to a modesty which would
become the telling of a story, which must in some part Echo out his own
praise, thus began.

Your Highness, (and I think all here present) very well knows that the Potent
Mullisheg King of Fess and Morocco, after he had by a long and tedious civil
war, taken prisoners his two brothers who had strove with him for the Royal
Scepter, and caused them to be put to death, having settled those two Crowns
upon his own head without any fear of competition, made many threatenings to
annoy the Christians whose, sworn enemy his Religion makes him, which threats
he not long since put in execution by commanding this noble Bassa, (for he
wo^thily deserves that attribute) whom he had some time before created Viceroy
of Argiers, with a Fleet of twelve Galleys to scour the Seas, infest our
coasts, make prize of our Ships and goods, and inslave our persons.

And though this Bassa executed his commission with all mildness possible, and
with a nobleness rather becoming a Christian, then a Moor, restoring many whom
he had made prize of to their liberties, and some to their goods; yet the
tyrannies which were acted by some who were Commanders under him, or rather
spies over him, and who ill resented those favors he so often showed to the
Christians, were too great for to comport, which made your Highness with
Sixteen Galleys command me to clear our Seas and Coasts from their pyracies;
which I hope I have effected in so short a time, that your Highness will not
repine at the expense you have been at for the general good of Christendom.

I was not fully a fortnight at Sea, but it was my fortune to espy the Moresco
Kings whole Fleet, under the command of this gallant Bassa, we immediately
hoysed all our syal to make up to them; Nor did they endeavor to shun us, but
standing up toward us, we expected a sharp fight: but nine of his Galleys,
whether terrified by our numbers and valor, or their own coward fear,
immediately yielded to us; two of the other after some resistance, were brought
to obedience, but the Admirals Galley though she were assaulted by at least six
of our Galleys, at once, made a resolute resistance; encouraged, or indeed
acted by the sole valor of this brave man, who did such wonders as I am almost
ashamed to acknowledge, or recount before him, I was enraged that after the
yielding of eleven, one gally, because she was the Admiral, as if the others
had infused all their spirit into her, should make so gallant a resistance, and
that only by the sole valor and prowess of her Captain; and therefore
clapping her aboard, I entered her in person, which I had no sooner done, but
this generous Bassa accosted me, and presenting me the pommel of his sword,
told me, That it was neither desperation nor hopes to escape that had been the
cause of his making so obstinate a resistance against so great odds; but
because, being an Admiral himself, he scorned to yield to any other then the
Admiral. I knew not how to return an answer suitable to his nobleness, nor was
there any thing could have quitted so much worth, but an immediate restoration
of his liberty, which not daring of my self to do, I here humbly present him,
and my self thus low at your Highness feet.

The Renowned Spencer had all the while that the Cavalier Pedro Venturo had
been relating this story, fixed his eyes upon the worthy Bassa, and no sooner
had he finshed to speak, but running to him and embracing him, cried out,
Worthy Ioffer Bassa, and is it possible that fortune should be adverse to cast
down so gallant a person? I shall be enforced indeed hencesorth to account her
blind, and like a Courtier not reguarding deserts or merit. Then kneeling to
the grand Duke, mighty Prince, continued he, did you know the worth that flows
in these black veins, you would not only send him ransomeless to his country,
but honor him, and if (said he) I have merrited any thing from these two Dukes,
(meaning Mantoua and Ferrara) let me beg them to be my intercessors that I may
pay his ransom, and if all I have amount not to what great Florence may
expect, I Will leave my self in hostage. The grand Duke remembredhis excellent
Generosity toward the gallant Spencer, was very ready to comply with his
desires, (though he would not yet seem to know him for that worthy person,)
which he sufficiently manifested by telling him, Noble Englishman so much is
all Italy beholding to you, for reconciling these two Dukes, in whose peace all
the Princes of this country are so much concerned, that I should very ill quit
the obligation you have laid upon our country, if I should not comply with your
desires, your friendship to him is his ransom, which if you will likewise
bless us with, we all account it better then Myriads of gold. Go noble Bassa,
now no more a prisoner, at pleasure return to thy country. The joy which the
generous Spencer conceived for this free grant of the Thusean Dukes, made him
forget to return a thanks due to so great a favor: But running again to the
Bassa and embracing him, noble Ioffer said he, thou savior of my life, and of a
life I prize above ten thousand of my own, how happy am I that I can in some
part renumerate thy kindness, yet this freedom I have procured thee cannot half
renumerate thy worth. Sir, (answered the Bassa) even slavery it self had been
welcome to me, if I might but therewith have enjoyed your sight and presence,
which I had resolved to search all over the world for, and rather then not
obtain, have hazarded the breach of a rash and foolish oath I once made, of
never more returning into my native country. Your native country (said
Spencer,) are you not then a native of Barbery? I must confess I ever doubted
that such nobleness could not reside in any of that rude, and illiterate
Nation: Oh Sir (replied the Bassa, I have things yet to tell you, which will
make you yet hate me; It is impossible (said Spencer,) I must first hate my
self, and my own life sooner then the noble preserver of it. I will now then
(said the Bassa) no longer conceal my self, but if you can receive a brother,
who has long since forfeited both yours, and his fathers affection, embrace
me, this black is like a veil to cover my former miscarriages, which being once
washed off, I shall appear like my first self. Not only the worthy Spencer,
but the Dukes, and the whole presence were astonished at these words of the
Bassas, they all not knowing what to say, or how to believe what he had
uttered, the worthy Spencer had fixed an eye of amazement upon his face, where
though the black still remained, he began to espy some symptoms of his
brothers physiognomy, whilst the Bassa seeing his and all their wonder, thus
continued; Sir, I shall not only by taking away this Moorish hew, clearly
convince you, I am your Brother, but give you likewise such infallible
circumstances, as shall make you not able to deny it; nor think that though I
have changed my color, I have withal changed my Religion, for I protest
before Heaven, I never was yet guilty of receiving into my bosom the least
Turkish Tenent; but perhaps your doubt and wonder may as much accrue from my
not discovering my self before, but when you have heard my reasons to the
contrary, you will rest satisfied; in the mean time, let me beg some respite of
these Princes to redeem my native hue, and I shall soon return like my first
self. The Duke easily granted him that liberty, and withal gave order, that he
should out of his Wardrobe be furnished with befitting Christian apparel.

The whole presence was left in great admiration at this strange adventure,
being unwilling to believe what they yet did believe; but at the return of the
Bassa (for we shall still so call him) their wonder not only increased to see
him so soon changed from a deep black, into a pure white complexion, but to
observe the great similitude which was between him and the worthy Spencer, the
same majesty and gallantry appeared in both their Countenances, with a kind of
pleasing affability, which was somewhat less in the Bassa who was the elder
Brother, and whose visage inclined somewhat more to fierceness than that of the
generous Spencer.

To relate the several Embraces and obliging Expressions, which passed between
these two brothers, would be an Herculean labor; the noble Spencer with tears
in his eyes welcomed into his bosom his long-lost brother, whom he had many
years since accounted dead. The several Congratulations of Goodlake, Ruffman,
and others would take up a Volume to recite them: the Dukes themselves
descending from their thrones, embraced this newfound Christian.

After all these Complements and Entertainments had past, which could be
expected from two Brothers which had been long lost to one another: The Grand
Duke's earnest desire to hear the story of this renowned Bassa, made him
importunate in desiring him to give him and the other Duke, a brief Relation of
it; which, although he was somewhat unwilling to do, yet not knowing how to be
otherwise grateful to those great Personages, he assented to, and began in
these words.

THE HISTORY Of the Famous JOFFER BASSA.
AFter I was (said he with the tears almost gushing out of his eyes) by my
fathers too much provoked anger banished out of his sight, and wholly
dis-inherited of his Estate, armed with disdain, and despair, (the last a
plague and punishment incident to rebellions against Parents) I resolved to go
seek that fortune in other Countries, which his just resentments had denied me
in my own; and indeed shame as well as necessity enforced me to take this
course, for I had not only tired out my fathers patience, but all those
friends whom I had too often employed to make my peace with him. Gathering
therefore up some few debts, which my riot had before scattered amongst my
dissolute companions, I embarked my self upon a ship bound for Civita Vechia,
the chief Port-Town of the Papacy toward the Tyrhene Sea; intending to find
my self employment in those Wars, which had some time before broken out between
the Church, and your Highness renowned father, Cosino de Medices, Grand Duke of
Tuscany.

But as if Fortune now having me in her clutches, had resolved to inflict a
punishment upon me, equal to my former miscarriages; we were no sooner past the
Streits of Gibralter, and sailing thence with a prosperous gale toward out
intended Ports, but we espied three Turkish Men-of-war, belonging to the King
of Tunis who gave chase to our poor Ba que: it is true we could see little hopes
in making any resistance, yet the fear I had to be a slave, and the certainty I
was in never to be redeemed, made me encourage the Captain to fight; but no
arguments of mine, or desires of many of his Seamen, could make his coward
mind admit within it any other terms but those of yielding* vainly imagining
that either his ransom would be less, or his usage better, from those
Barbarians* if he basely submitted, then if he bravely stoo^ it out.

But the major part resolving to fight, and like generous souls, being willing
rather to endure death then slavery, we resolved that since our Captain would
not be persuaded to combat them, either to force him to it, or secure him* the
last of which we had scarcely finished to do* and put our selves in order, but
the first of the Pirates came up to us, and having given us rough salute,
presently clapped us aboard; bu^ such was our resolution, that before either of
the other two could come up to us, we had twice beaten them off our decks, and
were ready to enter theirs, and in all probability to have made a Prize of
those who endeavored to prey upon us, when we were prevented by the furious
assault of the second of the Pirates, a ship of greater force then the first
that had a^tacqued us, yet we for some time likewise obstinately defended our
selves against them, till the third coming up to their assistance, we were
constrained to yield to their power and numbers.

Nothing could be more grievous to me then thus to become a slave, yet my
adverse fates would not admit me to prevent it; for I once endeavored to have
pierced my own heart with my Poynard, but was hindered by the covetous Turks,
who intended to make money of my person, and the very thought of being to be
sold in the market like a bruit beast, made me so desperate, that I should have
accounted the blood of Asps and Vipers, to have been a healing and sanative
potion.

But of all means of freeing my self from slapery by a voluntary death, I was
deprived by being closely chained up amongst the rest between the hatches, and
so close were we together, that if we had strove to find out a death, it must
have been no other then the knocking of our brains out one against another; but
that which somewhat comforted me, was to see our coward Captain in as bad
condition as my self, or indeed worse if possible could be, for he being placed
in the midst of us was forced, endured not only the reproaches, but the
buffers of his own men for his cowardice; five days continued we in this
condition, fed with nothing but a few scraps of bisquet, and stinking water,
which made me with tears begin to bethink my self of that good and noble
condition, out of which I had by my own folly and wilfulness thrown my self.

Being arrived at Tunis, we were immediately carried on shore, and with our
chains about our legs, brought into the public Bazar, where it was my fortune
to be sold to an old Beldam, who employed me in nothing else but to fetch her
water, scour her dishes, and other the most servile drudgery, being
continually subject to the flouts, mocks, and blows, of her imperious son; who
had so much incensed me, that I once resolved to have executed a severe revenge
upon him long before I did it, and thereby with the enduring of a little
torture, to have freed my self from a lasting misery, for I could imagine no
way to escape, but my stars had yet for me in store a better fate, and intended
to punish me, not to destroy me; for so it happened, that my Beldame had some
time before me bought into her house to do her private service, a little female
Jew, with whom in short time I had grown so familiar, that I could discern in
her some love toward me, for she would often assist me in performing those
servile works which were daily imposed; and many times would we sit together
seriously lamenting our misfortunes, and belching out curses against our young
Patron, who was equally insolent to both.

One day as I was brushing and cleansing some of Osmans clothes, for so was the
old woman's son called, she came to me all bloody and lamentably crying, she sat
down in a most melancholy desperate posture by me, I need not ask her from
whence her affliction derived, for I had often my self had experience of it;
but turning to her, must we always, said I, be inslaved to this misery, and be
subject to the insolences of this yound dog, without revenge? That word
revenge, revived her out of her pensive drowsinesses: If thou can be
faithful, said she, and have but valor enough to effect it, let me alone to
invent a way for both our escapes. It is impossible, replied I, that ever we
can pass the Ports. It is true, answered she, as we are it is, but I have an
Art to compose a Juice, which shall turn us in two hours space more black then
the Sunburned Ethiopians, by which means we shall escape the fury of our
Patroness, and certainly we cannot fall into deeper miseries, then are now
overwhelmed. Do but that, said I, and assure your self of a full revenge. But
thou shall first promise me, (said Iosina, for so she was called) thet thou will not forsake me, for, said she, (rising up and embracing me) though I am
like thee a slave here, yet I am of noble Extract, nor has my beauty, except my
friends, and those of my own Nation, flattered me, been accounted despicable;
nor indeed was it, for she was admirable fair, and had she not been so, I was
willing to embrace any thing to procure my liberty; so I swore to her by all
Oaths imaginable, that I would never leave her: she now felt not her blows,
which had before half slain her, but nimbly went about to provide the promised
Juice, which I had not faith enough to credit, till I had found by experience,
that being easily laid on it, turned out skins to a Mauri^anian hew, and that
nothing but Wine Vinegar could remove it; she having thus performed her part,
she pressed me to act mine, which I had within three days opportunity given me
to do, for the old Beldam having sent me to fetch her some water from a Spring
about two miles off, for her own drinking, I in my way encountered Osman, who
far from his usual manner, began fami^iarly to discourse with me, and
accompanied me as far as the Wels; this strange alteration of his, had almost
made me alter my purpose, but knowing it was at present but feigned, and would
break out afterward into greater storms, I resolved to execute it, and hopes
of gaining my liberty, giving a double strength to my arm, I stepped unto him,
and snatching out his sword, and withal turning of his Turban^, without giving
him leave to speak, at one blow I stroke him to the ground, assured of his ever
rising again till the day of Judgment.

My revenge thus happily effected, I covered his body slightly with sand, and
thrusting his Scimitar under my slaves coat, hastened home with my water, which
having delivered to my old patroness, I made as much haste to acquaint Iosina
with what I had done, and showing her the ^word as a testimony of it, she so
rejoiced as I cannot tell well how to express, the night drew on which was
propitious to our designs, for he using seldom to come home, was not at all
searched for, and we had the opportunity by the privacy of it to color our
selves, which we soon effected, each mutually helping each other, though with
as much modesty as we could: I confess it grieved me to lay that black hue upon
her white and angel like skin; but the remembrance of liberty made all things
sweet. About two hours before day, we issued out of the old Beldams house,
taking all the moneys we could find in it, but not meddling with any thing else
lest it should betray us; and both of us speaking the language well, we came
into a Cane or Inn in the town, as travelers newly come out of the country,
which we might well do so early in the morning, it being the custom of those
countries to travel altogether by night.

To remove suspect, though it was impossible for any one to know us, according
to the usual manner, we no sooner came into the Inn, but we laid our selves
down to repose, both in one Chamber, but at a modest distance, but scarce had
we slept three hours, but we were awakened by the noise in the Inn, made by the
Officers of Justice come in search of us; we were about to rise, and be as
inquisitive as others what the business was, but as we were about to do so, the
Officers entered our Chamber, and seeing none but us two Blacks, as they
supposed, as soon departed; we asked some Moors what the matter was? Who told
us, that Osman Chellabee was murdered by his mothers slaves, who being fled
upon it, they were now in search of them.

All things being again quieted in that Cane, and the Officers gone to search
in some other, we called for some repast, and were very jocundly merry at our
so cleanly escape; but in the midst of our mirth, it was, I cannot tell
whether our good or ill fortune to remember, that we had left our spunges with
a bowl of the juice which had dyed our skins at home, and though we imagined,
that at first sight they could not tell what to make of it, yet we thought some
accident might discover for what intention it was: This suddenly changed all
our mirth into sadness, we could not a good while resolve what to do; but at
length our own safety prompted us immediately to leave the town before our
artifice should be discovered, for though the gates upon this murder were
securely watched, that no Christian slave should pass, yet those of our
complexion might have free Egress and Regress.

We passed therefore forth of that gate, which leads toward Argiers, choosing
to go thither, both because Iosina having past and repast that way, was
acquainted with it, and also because we might there securely change our
complexions, and so find some Christian ship to transport us to this blessed
shore.

Our feet had before been surbated with labor, so travel was not tedious to us,
and our poor outsides secured us from thieves, for we had scarce more cloth,
then would cover our nakedness, though I had near two hundred checqueens tied
in a girdle about my waste, so that we feared nothing but wild beasts, which
often in those deserts assault. Most of our discourse to shorten the time, was
about our difference in religion, and unto so good a conceit had I brought
Iosina of our belief, that she promised me if I would carry her into
Christendom she would forsake her Religion, for parents, friends, and kindred
she had none living, for me and my faith.

Thus travayled we with all imaginable content, till we came to the large^and
spacious forest of Albemquel, which spreads it self over nine mountains, but
has no other inhabitant's besides Lions, Tigers, Wolves, Bears, and other
beasts of prey, and those in no small quantity: one days journey had we made
through this disolate Arbory, and were now proceeding onwards on the next, when
about noon my Iosina, for my heart now bids me call her so) being somewhat
faint through the extreme heat, we sat to shade and rest our selves under a
large spreading sycomore, (which in those countries bears a wild fig, much
eaten by the Moors) and the fruit being almost ripe, I, though unwillingly
consented to by Iosina, mounted the tree to gather her some, when being on top
and thick leaves shading me from all sight, I might on the sudden hear a
rushing among the leaves below, and withal a great feminine shreike; I
descended withal the expedition possible, but when I came down I found her not
there, nor could I imagine which way she had taken: heavens! into what a
passion was I cast? I easily determined her devoured by some wild beast, and
for her sake vowed revenge upon all those in the forest; therefore snatching up
my dart, which I stuck at the bottom of the tree, I took that way which my
reason had directed me to, hoping either to find her, or at least some remains
of her; but having three days sought in vain, I was constrained by hunger to
seek my way out of the wood, and taking the directions of the declining Sun, I
past with much trouble through those thick brakes, for I could not again find
the road.

But having travayled thus one whole day, night coming on, fearing to loose
what I had before got toward my way out, made me ascend a tree to repose me,
but the next morning I found my self so faint through hunger and thirst, that I
was scarce able to descend: but with much pains being got down, I had not
walked far, but I was assaulted by a hunger-starved bear, who with open mouth
assured himself of a prey, and I confess I almost assured my self I should be
so to him, for such was my weakness that I found my self almost incapable of
resistance; but summoning up all my spirits, I with both hands reared up my
dart, and as he mounted up his two hinder feet to seize me, smote him^ on the
breast, and found an easier passage to his heart then I expected; his death two
ways afforded me life, for I not only escaped becoming a prey to him, but
with his blood somewhat assuaged my violent hunger and thirst.

That day brought me out of the forest, into a large sandy desert, where I
resolved still to take the Sun for my guide in the day, and the Stars in the
night; yet now I began to think I should wander eternally, for all that night
and the succeeding day I could meet with neither man, or habitation, nor yet
wild beast; but more then the tedious of my travel, did the loss of my dear
Iosina affict me, though I suffered all the inconveniences of thirst and
hunger, yet was my mind more tormented for her death (for so I supposed it,)
then my body for want of necessaries: it length utterly wearied I laid my self
down upon the ground when by an Echo through the hollow veins of the earth, I
might hear strange and confused noyses, this made me yet more attentively
listen, when at length I determined it to be the sound of martial instruments
not far distant, and somewhat revived hope to find some rational creatures,
for I had for many days conversed with no other then beasts of prey. I roused
up my spirits, and clambring up a steep hill which lay before me, I might in
the large plain on the other side behold a mighty Army which seemed in a
readiness to expect their foes, who appeared on the tops of the furthermost
hills.

Though I doubted I should at my approach to them be taken by them for a spy,
yet my hunger constrained me to adventure down, and being come to their
Out-guards, I was immediately seized upon, and brought before the mighty
Mullisheg King of Fess and Morocco; for his Army it was, which he had raised to
oppose his rebeltious brothers, who having strictly examined me, was so far
from thinking me a spy, that he demanded of me if I would serve him in his
wars, and I readily assenting to do it, he persuaded, by I know not what
genius, caused me to be listed in his own horse guard.

The opposite Army under the command of Muley Xeriff, stayed for some days
longer on the tops of the mountains, nor could any provocations draw him from
his fastnesses; where it is to be supposed he resided in, expecting the other
brother Muley Hamet to come and join with him; for no sooner was he a^rived,
but they descended into the Plain, with an Army of about fourscore thousand
men, our whole force consisting of not above forty thousand foot, and twenty
five thousand horse.

The night before the fatal battle, both Armies encamped within the reach of
each others Artillery, which played furiously whilst there appeared any
twinkling of light, but night having covered the earth with her black man^el,
both sides lay still till the morning star showed them again in Arms, and after
the Artillery had for some time thundered out death and destruction, the two
brothers advanced toward us in a gallant Equipage; nor did we receive them
with a resolution any thing unequal to theirs, though I must confess that we
were forced to give a little ground to the fury of their first charge, yet that
loss proved to our Advantage: In sum, the battle continved doubtful till about
noon, when Muley Xeriff with a select party broke into the Kings guards, and
had near taken the great Mullisheg prisoner, or deprived him of life, had not
my better stars guided me to his rescue.

Having set the King safe, and received from him innumerable thanks and
promises of reward, I returned again to the almost broken guards, and
encouraging them the best I could, come (said I to party who had seen me rescue
the King, and had there-upon protested to follow me wheresoever I would lead
them,) let us fetch this Traitor from amongst the midst of his rebellious
troops, I was gallantly seconded by about a hundred of them, who gave so
resolute a charge that we soon made way through those before victorious troops,
and came to the place where Xeriff was; him guided by fortune I singled out,
and soon brought him under the power of my sword, Heavens! How did the great
Mullisheg embrace me when I presented him at his feet: As for him he caused his
head to be immediately cut off, and being set upon a lance to be carried up and
down the Army, which struck such a terror into the Rebels, that they
immediately threw down their Arms and yielded, or else trusted to their heels
for their safety. Muley Hamet with three thousand horse escaped the fury of the
field, and fled toward the plains, but so totally was the Army routed, that he
had little hopes of rallying them for to try another encounter.

I am ashamed to tell you (Mighty Prince) those obliging Expressions, with
which Mullisheg entertained me after the Battle: he called me his Better
Genius, One sent from the prophet to a^^st his Right, the Soul of his Empire,
with many other such strange Epethites, too tedious to relate, withal giving me
the Command of five thousand Horse, and desiring me with all speed posible, to
pursue the Rebel Muly Hamet; for you, said he, I know will bring him back: I
would willingly have bin excused from this Employment, by reason of my being
unacquainted in the Country, but he told me he had provided me sufficient
guides.

We overtook this unfortunate Prince on the utmost bounds of those vast Plains
of Mombaza, accompanied with not above forty on fifty horse at most, the rest
having either fallen into our hands, or deserted him, and to procure their own
safety, fled into the deserts or by-ways: he no sooner perceiving us pursuing
him with so great a power, but hoping to escape into a Wood not far distant, he
struck out of the way from the rest toward it; he was easily known by those
Guides that accompanied me, who told me that if he gained that Wood, it would
be impossible to find him out: This made me put spurs to my Courser, which
being swifter than his, I overtook him just at the entrance into the Wood, and
he seeing no possibility of escaping me, faced about, and opening his breast,
Generous Soldier, said he, what ever by nature (...) art, yet show thy self now
noble, transfix this unfortunate breast with thy sword, and make me not a scorn
to my tyrannous Brother: I was about to tell him, that I had strict command
from Mullisheg to bring him alive; when he guessing by my delays that I would
not answer his desires, with his own sword pierced his heart.

I could not but both pity and commend the resolution of this generous Prince,
and was standing amazed at the Magnanimity and Gallantry of the Action, when
the whole body of Horse came up, the chief Commanders of which advised me to
carry his body to the King, to assure him of his death, which I gave order to
be done: and the Moorish King having first embraced me, and given me a million
of thanks, and withal put a very rich Jewel about my neck, seemed somewhat to
lament his death, giving order for his being buried like a Prince, which made
me believe that he would have saved his life, the rather because he was drawn
into this Rebellion, more by cunning Artifices of his brother, than by any
inclination of his own.

The Mighty Mullisheg strove still to load me with new Honors, making me often
ride by his left hand, and at our arival at Mamorah (whither he went to keep
Court, and to settle his Kingdom, which now enjoyed a firm Peace by the death
of his two brothers) made me one of his Bassa's, and of his Privy Council,
often using to tell me, that at his first sight of me he had perceived in my
countenance somewhat^ more than ordinary. But all those Honors he conferred
upon me, were envied by old Muly Mustapha, who presuming upon his being Uncle
to the King, endeavored by all means possible to bring me into some disgrace.

But the King favor to me out-lasted his life, for he died soon after, and
still rather increased than decayed, till such time I was made Viceroy of
Argiers: for all the Circumstances during my Brothers being there, I shall
omit, presuming your Highness to be already acquainted with them, as far as
they concerned him, and for the reasons of my not discovering my self to him,
they are palpable enough to all; for had but the King had the least knowledge
of my being a Christian, I had forfeited both my Honors and my Life, and feign
I was, lest my whiteness should be discovered, to renew my tincture with the
Juice taught me by Iosina, which I never did, but her untimely end came fresh
to my memory.

For all my Honors and the Glories of the Moorish Court, could not blot out of
my heart that love I had entertained for her, and often would I take times
solitarily to lament her misfortune; which as I was once in my Chamber very
melancholy, considering of, and repining at the injustice of the gods, to
deprive me of her as soon as I loved her, a strange person entered my Chamber,
at which I was somewhat amazed, wondering how he durst be so bold as to press
into my privacies, when addressing himself to me in an humble manner, Sir, said
he, I have often waited an opportunity to deliver something to you which may
perhaps content you, but not finding any convenience, I have made bold now to
press into your Chamber, and therewithal delivered me a Letter, which I hastily
opened, and found therein to this effect.

To the Mighty BASSA JOFFER.
THough your Greatness may justly cause You not to deign the sacrificing one
idle thought to the memory of the unfortunate IOSINA, yet she dares let you
know that through all the splendour of your Glories, and the change of your
Name, she can espy that person who has captivated her heart. I cannot believe
that your honors have instilled into you such a cruelty, as will exceed that of
the wild beasts in the Forest of Alemquel; or that I, who by a strange
providence was preserved from theirs, should now perish by yours. Ambition to
share in your Greatness, prompts me not to this; but only our former Loves
makes me desire you sometimes to remember what has for your sake been suffered
by the miserable

Josina.


I was so overjoyed at the reading of this Letter, that I could not for a good
while return any Answer to the Messenger; but at length turning to him, And is
my Dear Iosina still safe (said I) have the gods yet preserved her? Blessed
heavens! how am I bound to your goodness! She is, Sir, both safe (said the
Messenger) and at present in Argiers. What need I then (said I) return any
Answer to her Letter, when I may in person see her. Alas Sir, said the
Messenger, she would think it too much an honor for her to receive a Visit from
so great a Person. An honor, said I, 'twill rather be an honor to me if she
admit me: Go (said I) to my Dear Iosina, and having begged her leave, come in
the dusk of the Evening, and conduct me to her; in the mean time present her
that as a Token of my constant Affection, giving him that Jewel which had been
by Mullisheg presented unto me, upon my bringing him the body of Muly Hamet,
not did the Messenger of so glad tidings go unrewarded.

Iosina give an easy grant to my desires, and no sooner had the darkness of
the Night shut up the Day, but the Messenger conducted me to the place where
she resided: but heavens! how was I extasied at the sight of her! if her
beauties pleased me before, they now ravished me; I had seen her before in the
habit of a slave, but now of a Princess. I stood rather like an inanimate
Statua than a moving soul, and like one that could not tell whether I were
moved with Admiration or Love; imposible indeed it will be to relate the
passions of either of us at this meeting, or for any to guess what they were,
but those that feel them; we soon renewed our former Loves, and I remember
amongst other Discourse she told me, that though I had used such persuasive
Arguments to make her change her Religion, as had overcome her, yet she feared
I had now for momentary Honor, changed mine for a worse than that which she
before professed: But I assured her, and made her easily believe the contrary.
In sum, we concluded to invent some way of getting both into Christendom,
which yet we resolved to defer, till those Galleys appointed for me to scour
the Seas were in readiness, for they were then preparing; and indeed I should
have embarked with my Brother on his Negro, rather than have made him run so
deep a resigo of his life, but that I should then have left behind me my Dear
Iosina.

At last the Galleys being ready, I put to Sea, having privately got Iosina
aboard, and could I have found an opportunity, would often have stole from the
rest of the Fleet, but there was so much danger in it, that it was a
desperation to attempt it. At length hearing that your Highness Fleet was out
at Sea, I had so tampered with Nine of the Captains, that they promised to
yield (and turn Christians) at the first sight of your Fleet, which I long
sought our for, and at length fortunately found; and lest you should wonder why
my self made resistance, know that a boisterous soldier laying violent hands
upon my beloved Iosina, I could do no less then give him the due reward of his
insolence, which others of his fellows endeavoring to revenge, I was forced to
defend my self.

Here the Bassa ended, and the Princes began their admirations of the strange
adventures of his Story, when a menssenger brought word, that the guard of
soldiers who had the charge of the Captives, was arrived; whereupon the Grand
Duke gave command, that they should immediately be brought before him; but in
the mean time those Captives who had been taken in other Christian ships, and
were now released by Pedro de Venturo, came to give thanks to the Duke: amongst
these Iosina presented her self so excellent in beauty, that her presence no
less amazed the whole Court, then her Story had done: The Grand Duke of
Florence rising from his Throne, saluted her, the like did the Dukes of Ferrara
and Mantua, the last of which seemed to eye her with a strange kind of
affection, and withal so much troubled in his thoughts, that he was observed
by the whole presence; but at length not able longer to smother them, he
descended again from his seat, and taking her by the hand, Madam, said he, if I
may not seem rude, or uncivil, to be thus inquisitive into your fortunes at
first sight, I would willingly beg the favor to know of what Country you are.
You have Sir, (replied she) put a riddle to me, which I am not able to resolve,
for I never yet could learn of my Father what Country I was a Native of; but
this I know, that he was an Hebrew by Nation. An Hebrew, replied the Duke of
Mantoua, shall I yet be so much farther bold as to desire his name, if your
slavery and other miseries have not made you forget it? He was Sir, answered
she, called Signor Gioseppe, and had many years been a Merchant in Italy, till
his fortunes there somewhat decaying, he resolved to remove from thence into
the Levant, but in our way we were taken by some Pirates of Tunis, where he
after three years died a slave; but I continued so till fortune instructed that
noble Bassa, and my self, to conspire our liberty. It is most true (said the
Duke of Mantua to himself with the tears standing in his eyes) but fair Virgin,
continued he, I once lost a daughter, who must be now about your years and
feature, and if the Cherry your dead mother affirmed you had upon your right
Breast, agree with the Mold upon your Chin, I must of force claim you for her;
give me then leave to see that infallible testimony. She immediately showed it
to him, to the wonder of them all: And the Duke no longer able to contain
himself, embracing her with a fatherly affection, the tears trickling down his
cheeks for joy: Is it then possible, said he, (my dear Iulietta) that after
fourteen years absence I should again be blessed with the sight of thee! Oh my
dear girl^ to what sorrow did that treacherous Jew betray me, and what miseries
did his theft involve thee into! Oh! Noble Florence, this is that child of
mine, this is my dear and only Iulietta, whom that perfidious and treacherous
Jew Gioseppe stole from me at four years of age, depriving not only me of a
child, but my Dukedom of an Heir: Oh! most worthy Bassa, by whose means I am
again blessed with an Issue, since thou have before gained her love, receive
her now again at my hands, and with her after my decease, my Name and Dukedom:
in this ecstasy did the good Duke run on for near half an hour, to the
admiration of the whole presence.

But to make this day wholly repleat with wonders, the valiant Goodlake met with
an accident, which pleased him no less then could the gaining of a whole
Dukedom; for being espied by one of the redeemed Captives, though not
altogether so fair, yet not much yielding to the beauty of Iulietta; she
suddenly accosted him, and to his great amazement, straightly embracing him,
cried out, And are the gods yet so favorable to the afflicted Mariana, to
permit her again the sight of her beloved Goodlake! now am I fully requited for
all the miseries I have undergone, for all the cruelties of my Uncle, for all
my dangers at Land, and captivity at Sea. Captain Goodlake was so strangely
transported with this sudden accident, that he knew not well what to answer, he
beheld the visage, the carriage, the speech, and the accent of his beloved
Mariana, yet could not but believe her dead, and that all that he heard, or
saw, was a mere fantasm: But she seeing him in that passion, my dear Goodlake,
said she, from whence proceeds this strange perplexity in thy mind? have I
ventured all dangers imaginable, and endured all miseries to find thee out,
and will thou not now own me for thy Mariana? how many times have thou solemnly
sworn that without me thou could not live? how many times have thou protested
that I was the very essence of thy soul? Away false man, if nothing will
convince thee, yet let this Ring, the last pledge I received of thy Love, be a
testimony against thee, for thy perjuries, which the gods will without doubt
severely vindicate. Goodlake was yet more astonished at the strangeness of the
adventure, but at length recollecting himself, if thou be'est, (said he,) the
shade of my dear Mariana, as I cannot but think thou art, what worth was there
in me that could call thee from the eternal Mansion of rest, to these earthly
miseries? I am, said she, neither shade nor Ghost, but thy real living Mariana,
cloystered up from thee by the cruelty of my Uncle, who to preserve to himself
my Estate, and to put thee into despair, gave out I was dead, and made a solemn
burial of an empty Coffin; but his real death had no sooner freed me from his
Tyranny, but I put in execution that vow, which during my confinement, I made
to search thee through the world, and now I have found thee, will thou forsake
me? Forsake thee, my dear Mariana, said Goodlake, the gods must first
relinquish^ their eternal powers; Alas! those years I have lived since thy
supposed death, have been but a continual death to me, and had not the
friendship of the Noble Spencer kept me alive, and his love bouy'd up my
Spirits, I had assuredly long since been a concomitant with those wandering
spirits in the eternal shades. Here the Generous Spencer came to salute the
fair Mariana, and to joy with her both for her safety, and her happy meeting of
her long lost Lover.

But all these strange adventures rather increased the worthy Spencers
melancholy, then allayed it; others joy put him in mind of his grief, for the
loss of his beloved Spouse; which the Grand Duke perceiving, and willing to
make fully complete the joys of this day retiring for a short time, soon
returned leading his Fair Guest veiled in his hand, he addressed himself to Mr.
Spencer: Noble Englishman, said he, the resentment I have to see you alone
discontent of all this Noble Company, and in a day so fraught with wonders,
makes me present you this Lady, in whom I dare presume you will find as ample
content as any here; Herewith Besse Bridges (for so she was till then thought
to be) taking off her vail, the amazed Spencer ran joyfully to salute her,
embracing her with all that affection which could be expected from so constant
and loving a pair, whose frequent adversities had both tried their love, and
confirmed their constancy.

But whilst they were thus embracing each other, an ancient gentleman who had
stood all this while mute and melancholy, amongst the released captives,
stepped forth, and addressing himself to the generous Spencer's fair Spouse.
Madam (said he) both of the names, and the excellency of your beauty, I am
confirmed that you are the Lady, I have so long been in search for to deliver
this letter to from your noble Father. Certainly (Sir) said she, you are
extremely mistaken, for neither was my father noble, nor has he this many
years been amongst the living. True Madam (replied he,) your supposed father is
long since dead, but she whom you and the world I likewise esteemed your
Mother, has upon her Deathbed declared that the Countess of Sherborn, your
real Mother dying in Childe-bed you were put to her to Nurse, but her own and
only Infant soon after dying, she loath to be childless, sent word to my Lord,
that you were dead; so that you have ever since meanly lived, as child to your
Foster-father, which yet could not obscure those noble virtues inherent to your
birth, and which declare you to be, as indeed you are, the worthy Lady
Isabella, sole daughter and heiress to my thrice noble Master the Earl of
Sherborn. You tell me, said she, strange Paradoxes, and therewith breaking open
her Letter, and having read it to her self, see here, said she, my Spencer, the
same this gentleman tells us, is confirmed by that worthy Lord, nor will I in
the least doubt it.

This joy was added to the rest of those great adventures which had before
happened, which so rejoiced the grand Duke, that he resolved to portion his
entertainment equal to the strangeness of them; and therefore earnestly
pressing that the marriages between the Illustrious Bassa, and the Infanta of
Mantoua, and the gallant Captain Goodlake, and his beloved Mariana, might be
celebrated in his Court, which was readily assented to, nor wanted there a
third Marriage to make full the joy for Ruffman, having the same day found out
Mrs. Forcet who was likewise cast away in the Negro: it was concluded that he,
and Maria, should now likewise consummate their loves:

The Revels, Dancings, Justs, Masks, and other Triumphs performed at the
Marriage of these worthy personages was such, that there wanted nothing of that
state and magnificence, which the Riches of the grand Duke, or the famous City
of Florence could afford, to the far renowned and deserve d^pender of such a
ceremony, the solemnity of which lasted forty days.

At the end of which time the beauteous Lady Isabella, put her Spencer in mind
of the earnest pressings of the Earl of Sherborn her father, for her return
home, and he begging leave of the grand Duke, had it, though somewhat
unwillingly granted, whereupon the generous Spencer, and the noble Isabella,
Goodlake and Mariana, Forcet and Maria, together with Ruffman, prepared for
their voyage, and accompanied by the three Dukes, with many other persons of
quality, came to Pisa where they imbarqued, and fortune being now weary of
buffe^^ing such worthy personages, gave them a prosperous Gale for England.

As for the worthy Bassa, having now the possession of his beloved Iulietta,
Infanta of Mantua, he resolved to keep his vow of never more returning into his
native Country.
