ERMINIA OR, The fair and virtuous Lady. A Trage-comedy.

Written by Rich. Flecknoe.

Gratior -- In pulchro corpore virtus.

Virg. LONDON, Printed for the Author, MDCLXI.

To the Fair and Virtuous Lady, the Lady Southcot.
Madam,
I Profess to all the world, that Erminia is more yours then mine. From you I
took the pattern of the Plot; from you the spirit of writing it; nor am I ever
more Poet, then when I am with you at Mestham. There, free from the
Distractions of the Town, my mind is recollected: there, it is at Repose, free
from trouble and molestation: and there it is cheered and delighted, with
cheerful and delightsom company. Your green Walks are my Parnassus; the Spring
or Fountainhead, my Helicon: Nor could all the Muses together, more inspire
me, then you alone.

I am most glad then, that amongst my other Heroic Portraits, I made not yours
before, that I might do it in a more particular manner now, in that of the Fair
and Virtuous Erminia: And more particularly declare, how much I honor you; and
how much I am,

Madam, Your most devoted Servant, Rich. Flecknoe.

THE PREFACE, To the only few, The Best and Noblest.
I Promised you a Play, and to avoid farther importunity) behold it here. I cod
not promise you it should be Acted, (for having no interest in the Stage, I leave
that to those who have;) you may think it a preposterous way to Print it before
it be Acted; but Printing it as I do, (to pass to private hands, not to the
public) may no more prejudice it, then the first days Acting does the second;
which if good, commends it but the more. It will want much of the grace and
ornament of the Stage; but though there it be better seen, yet here it is better
understood; mean while, a lively fancy may imagine he sees it Acted: and to
help the imagination, I have set down the Scenes, the Habits, and Names of the
Actors, who though I chiefly entitle, to the right of acting it, yet I intend
not to depart with the Poets right of directing how it should be Acted. To
conclude, I hope it may no ways prejudice it in opinion, to have him for
Author who may say without vanity, that none knows more of the English Stage
then he, nor has seen more of the Latin, French, Spanish and Italian; nor may
it prejudice him to be the Author of it, (whatsoever the ignorant and envious
say) of the same Profession with Petre Ronsard in France; Lopes de Vega in
Spain; and the best and famousest Poets in Italy.

The Prologue for the Stage.
You Would have new Plays, and when you have them, you
Do by them, as Children by their Trifles do,
Slight and dislike them, and then cry for more,
And use them just as you did those before:
And this you think fine sport now, so do'nt they,
(I tell ye Gentlemen) who make the Play.
Notwithstanding, our Author gives you one
this once, and comes with resolution,
To try whether or no, to be a Disease
That reigns amongst you, no new Plays can please.
And if he find it so, he bid me say,
All the harm they will do him who condemn his Play;
They Will bring him off oth' Stage, into the Pit,
To judge with them, of others Plays and wit
Additions for the Court
To others this. But to Your Majesty,
Our Author here with all humility,
Offers his Labors: chiefly he' underwent,
Most Royal Sir, for Your Divertisement.
Counting it highest Happiness can be fall,
To delight Him, who is the Delight of all.
ERMINIA.
ACTUS, 1. SCENA, 1.
Anthenor, Leontius. The Scene the front of Erminia's Palace. Anth. NOble
Leontius, once more you are kindly welcome to Missena. The many civilities and
courtesies I received from you at Argos, obliges me to all the fair offices and
services I can do you here.


Leon. Gentle Anthenor, all I cod do to oblige a person of your worth, was
abundantly rewarded in the doing it, and if you would oblige me speak no more of
it: let us talk of somewhat else. -- We hear Cleander your noble General in the
Attique War, with victory leading him, and fortune following him, goes on like
lightning consuming all before him, and it is much wondered that employment, was
not rather conferred upon the Prince, who wants nor years, nor experience in
the wars, to make him fit for action; but necessity of state (it seems)
required an older, and more experienced Soldier.


Anth. Betwixt you and I I Will tell you, those who not only look upon the
outside of Princes actions, but boldly pry into their insides too, say, it was
not so much necessity of state that sent the brave Cleander to the wars, as
more to facilitate the Dukes access unto his Lady the admired Erminia --. But
how does your fair Princess Cyrena? that we may freely talk of; it was our hope
the Prince at's being at Argos should have married her, but the destinies of
marriage were not pleased it seems to make us so happy.


Leon. It was our hopes too, and we indeed wondered as much as you he should so
suddenly leave her, but much more, she should so suddenly after leave her
country, since when none knows, nor can imagine, what is become of her.


Anth. You amaze me with your news!


Leon. Mean time whilst others several ways address themselves in search of
her, I Am come to Missena here, well knowing their former loves and the
attraction of mutual hearts, when once they are touched with the adamant of love


Ant. Alas, I fear you will hardly find so much as her memory with him now, who
only minds the fair Erminia, about whose palace restlesly day and night like
some pale ghost he wanders, carefully seeking opportunity of seeing her, whilst
she as carefully avoids his sight.


Leon. This then made him it seems with so little difficulty quit his place
abroad to Cleander, in hope to enjoy his place at home. -- And now I see among
the many possibility of things, never were, nor are, nor e're are like to be; we
well may reckon Lovers constancy.


SCENA. 2.
Aurindo musing. Leontius, Anthenor But what Youth's this, so fair and lovely,
as curious Nature doubtful which sex to make, at last, in the framing him seems
to have made one, who of either all perfections had.


Ant. Oh! it is Aurindo the Princes page, much loved and favored by him, but
much more by the Duchess, who to avoid the Dukes jealousy preferred him to
the Prince.


Leo. He muses on somewhat, and there is a solemn sadness in his face,
excellently becomes him.


Ant. He is always sad and musing, what ere's the matter: but I must leave
you, and beseech you whilst you make your residence here, I may have honor to
serve you. Exit.


Leo. You too much honor your servant, Sir.


Au. Now I perceive it is not the change of place but change of mind, brings
lovers rest, else it is but just like sickmens turning them in their beds, who
sinde rest no where, 'cause they carry still their sicknesses and unrest along
with them.


Leo. Sure I should know that face.


Aur. Leontius! I must hide me from him, and avoid his sight as I Would avoid my
sears.


Leo. It Is she I know for certain now by her care not to be known: -- Hark you
fair Youth, a word with you I pray.


Au. With me Sir! pardon me, I know you not.


Le. It rather besits me ask your pardon for knowing you. But fear not, I shall
call you Aurindo still, or whatsoever name in public you please to be known
by, so you will give me leave in private to know you for my Princess.


Aur. Leontius though you might well perceive I desired not to be known, and
therefore it was a bold curiosity; yet since I Am well assured you did it with no
undutiful intent, I pardon you. But I command you let this secret pass no
further, neither enquire the reason of my disguise. Whilst I am here (which I
hope shall not be long) in private you may know me; but in public I charge you
take no notice of me, neither be seen with me lest you discover me; for your
court eyes are piercing ones, and there are many spies, -- and hark I hear some
coming, go, begone and leave me. Exit Leontius.


SCENA, 3.
Althea, Aurindo. What is it only she! this is Althea Erminia's woman, who I
know not for what sins of mine, unless for loving too much, is fearfully in
love with me; deliver me from her, for love in aged veins, as fire in dry
timber, burns always most terribly. I Would fain avoid her, she persecutes me worse
then frosts do flowers, they blast, or Ivy, trees, they kill, with their
embraces!


Alt. Gentle Aurindo! happily met, it is so long since I saw you last I might
well expect the courtesy of a salute from you.


Aur. Oh -- I were discourteous else: good Althea I Am glad to see you well.


Alt. What no more! and that so coldly too.


Aur. What wod you have? I know no other salutes.


Alt. You are not so ignorant as you would seem, I Am sure, to know no better what
salutes belongs to a Gentlewoman.


Aur. You would not have me make you a curtsy wod you? that is your woman's
salute, for men's I know no other.


Alt. Pity his ignorance; I Will teach you if you know not; sie, where have you
been bred I wonder! you are so bashful! I must imbolden you: this bashfulness in
you, shows worse then impudence in woman; how nice and coy he is? it will cost
me more pains and labor I fear to train him up to women's businesses, then to
break a wild unruly Colt unto the manage: come, come, pray sit down.


Au. Pardon me, I Am in haste and cannot stay.


Al. Always in haste! but tarry a little and I Will tell you all my Ladies secrets.


Au. I Am not curious.


Alt. Look you what is here -- nor liquorish neither? h'as nothing of the Page
in him.


Aur. Pray let me go, you have not seen my Lord the Prince?


Alt. Yes but I have though.


Aur. And where I pray?


Alt. Where you are not like to see him, let that suffice.


Aur. Nay, if you can tell me no more news of him, I must go seek out those
that can, and so farewell. Exit.


Alt. Gone? well, I pity him he is such a backward thing, and pity the Prince
who is as forward on the other side; and one of these sighing lovers who sigh and
sigh like dry pumps, or broken-winded bellows, for their Mistresses; and to
hear them, you would never wonder at Lapland witches selling winds so cheap,
and imbrakt (as he is) in my Lady love; I Have sold him as much as comes to a
little hope, send him a good voyage of it -- but see my Lady, pray heaven my
plot take, I Have venter'd hard to give the Prince entrance, and opportunity to
speak with her.


SCENA, 4.
The Scence, the Palace within. Erminia, Althea. Er. Althea are all the doors
shut?


Al. They are Madam.


Er. And have you given order they let none enter?


Al. I have.


Er. It Is well. So should wives live, honorable wives, solitary and retired
when their husbands are away, always apprehending what will the people say; for
it is not now with women as it was in the days of Innocence, when none imagined
harm, 'cause none did any; but now if we admit men's visits, they presently
speak ill of it; if women's ill too, ill of every thing: and though public
rumor be but a breath it is true, yet fame and honor is so pure a thing, as
like crystal mirrors it is blemished with every breath, and more pure, more
subject to blemishing.


Al. The more's the pity.


Er. Then if they stir abroad, the world's so foul and durty, how nicely one
must go, and step by step pick out their way, not to defile their Ermine purity?


Al. Lo there? and I go dash, dash, through thick and thin. that is my way now.


Er. Besides, how softly and warily must they tread, not to awaken rumor and
calumny, which once fastening on our fames and honors, oh how they tear them
with their poisonous teeth?


Al. What a terrible bandog does she make of it which other Ladies play with,
as familiarly as with their little Shocks or Bononi^ Dogs?


Er. In fine, this fame's a hard lesson, and one must study it well. --


Al. Faith it is so hard as I despair Aside. ever to learn it. I must put her
out of this study, or she is a lost woman. And why this retirement and solitude,
Madam? most wives have never better days, then in absence of their husbands.
What Is a husband but a man? and there are men enough in the world besides.


Er. Is the wench mad?


Al. No, but we should think that woman so should pine away, and starve her self in
her husbands absence; and this is just your case: uds bodykins before I Would
torment my self so for want of a husband, I Would have twenty so I would.


Er. Peace Althea, peace for shame, and cease thy idle talk.


Al. Pardon me, Madam, I am left in charge of your health, and must speak.


Er. Speak modestly then, for I am left in charge of my honor too, and must do
that, it obliges me to do: nor shall Cleander purchase more honor abroad, then
Erminia shall at home.


Al. That man never gets honor (nor woman that is never tried: what made
Penelope (neither) so famous (I pray) in her husbands absence, but her
entertaining so many Gallants as she did? there was a valiant woman now. Let
them come as many as they wod, she feared them not, she knew she cod deal with
them all. And you to lock up your self (a this manner) for fear of them!
there is wise valor indeed!


Er. As though there were not as much valor, in Passive Fortitude, and holding
out a siege, against the enemy, as in the Active one, of fighting them in the
field. The one is Cleander's honor, the other shall be mine. In either we will
declare our selves invincible.


Al. I grant you a man's honor chiefly consists in sighting, and a woman's in
defending her chastity; but there is discretion in all things; a man may fight
and fight, and yet be counted a quarrelsom Coxcomb for his pains: and a woman
proud and peevish, in defending her chastity: give me a fair conditioned man or
woman 'long as you live; and one, that understands reason. I cannot blame young
maids to have always for burden of their song, a husband, a husband, for they
never tried, and therefore may long perhaps; but for married wives to be
always in that tone, and crying out for their husbands, like fools and
children for their baubles, shows a kind of incontinence, and insatiate desire
in them.


Er. Cleander was my first love, and shall be the last and only one I Will ever
have.


Al. That shows your ignorance now; for as that man should never be a great
scholar who never red but in onebook, so should she never be a wise woman, who
never knew but one man. Variety is good in every thing; and use in that, as in
all things else makes perfectness.


Er. Well Althea, I know you say this by way of argument now, and only to try
your wit; but take heed, it is dangerous disputing against known verities; and
Atheism in Religion, Rebellion in States, and dissolution in life and manners,
had all their rise at first from knowing the best, and arguing for the worst.


Al. Well then, since you will needs be so far out of fashion of other wives,
to remember your husband in's absence; how can you better do it then by
recommending him in your Orasons to the Gods? and my Lord Cleander being now
exposed to the dangerous chance of war, towhom can you better recommend him,
then to the God of war?


Er. Now thou advisest well.


Mars's Statue discovered, Erminia kneels. Great Mars, thou whose potent Arm
does weild
The deadly pointed Lance, and mighty Shield,
Fight for my dear Cleander with the one,
And with the other, O defend him from
His enemies abroad, and grant that he
May safely but return with victory:
So shall I ever honor thee, ever pay
My vows unto thee; and on thy Altars lay
The purest offerings the world e're cod get,
Or e're were laid upon thy Altars yet.
Hear me great Mars.
SCENA, 5.
The Prince in form of Mars's Statue, Erminia, Althea. Pr. I do.


Er. Prodigious! the Statue speaks!


Pr. It Is you, fairest, have animated it.


Al. A good beginning, if it hold on as well.


Er. Cold horror seizes me! and I Am become by wondrous metamorphose, of living,
a dead statue, as that of dead's become a living one. -- And see it moves too!
descends from his base.


Pr. It Is your beauty, fairest, has given me life and motion; and if in the
cold veins of frozen marble t'has the virtuous force to inspire and infuse such
spirit and vital heat, imagine in my bosom what it must needs beget. discovers
himself


Er. Ha! my Lord the Prince!


Pr. The Prince your servant, dearest, for you metamorphos'd into statue thus,
for you, thus changed into my self again.


Al. Stay Madam, whither go you? he will not hurt you.


Er. Gods and my better Angels defend me! how came you here?


Pr. Your powerful charms, sweetest, did bring me hither.


Al. That Is well answered, I was afraid he would have said it was I Aside.


Er. And what wod you here?


Pr. Only that you would please to hear me speak.


Er. Though I might well deny you, coming as you do, yet on condition you speak
nothing but what is honorable, nothing but what besits both you to say, and me
to hear, I am content.


Al. Shame on this Honor, I Am afear'd he will hardly speed. Exit.


Pr. What can be more honorable? or how can I honor you more? then to come
here with no less devotion, then to the Temple of the Immortal Gods, to offer
my vows and orasons at your shrine.


Er. That Is an Idolatry I cannot admit without a crime, an honor too too great
and too divine for me.


Pr. To com to that which is more humane then, I come to beg your help for one
that is sick, your pity for a miserable wretch, burns, languishes, and consumes
away, for love of you.


Er. Nay, if you talk of love once, I Am gone.


Pr. And if you go I dye: -- of what should I talk but of love to you? who are
all lovely? Cruel as you are, can ye behold my sufferings and never pity me!
should Heaven be so pittiless, always to look upon the Earth with cruel
Canicular eyes, we soon should see all burn, languish, and consume like me.


Er. You call me cruel, and you your self are far more cruel to your self then
I; for what remedy for one, will needs be sick? or what means to quench their
fires will needs Nero-like, be their own incendaries? But now, to let you see
I Am not so pittiless as you imagine me, If It be my sight occasions your malady,
and inflames you so, I Will instantly be gone and leave you.


Pr. Ah do not, do not go; that were a remedy worse then the disease. Think
not, think not excellents of your sex to quench the fire you have kindled in my
breast by taking away the Torch that kindled it; that were to mock my flame and
me. No, no, your Eyes have double virtue, to wound and cure me too.


Er It Is vice not virtue to kindle unlawful fires. Know Sir, I am another: and
as it were crime in me to give away what is none of mine, so it is no less in you
to covet what is none of yours.


Pr. It Is crime in Cleander rather to appropriate to himself an universal good,
and injustice in you to consent unto the impoverishing the world to enrich
Cleander's bed.


Er. And you would steal me from him. Is this noble? this Prince-like? do you
not see one may as well bereave you of your principality.


Pr. I may taste the fruit and yet not be proprietary of the Tree.


Er. Without theft you cannot, unless the owner will; and I Am so absolutely
Cleanders, he cannot alienate me though he wod, nor relinquish his right of me.
Enter Althea hastily.


Al. O Madam, Madam!


Er. Ha! what is the matter?


Al. My Lord the Duke.


Er. What shall we do then? My Lord, you see what dishonor you are like to bring
upon my house and me, if you be seen here.


Al. To your disguize my Lord; be a statue again, and all will be well: nay
quickly, quickly, so.


SCENA, 6.
The Duke, Erminia, Althea, the Prince. Duk. What Is here? silence; where Fame's
loudest tongue proclaims all Excellency? and solitude, where she is, who with
fames of her excellence fills all the world? leave, leave this sadness Madam: I
come to bring you joyful news. Cleander your noble husband has finished the
wars, and only attends dispatch of a few affairs, to return and bring us
peace, and you the joy and happiness of seeing him.


Er. Your Highness too much honors your humblest servant, to be messenger of
this your self. Propitious heaven has heard my prayers for the public safety
then I see, if Cleander but return with victory.


Duke. And I hope You Will have some care of my private safety too, fair cruel
Mistress, and not suffer me to perish here at home, whilst Cleander so nobly
abroad, preserves us all from perishing.


Er. Can you remember that my Lord, and be so unjust and ungrateful to him, to
seek to dishonor him, who honors you so much; and tempt me to so vilde
ingratitude?


D. Dishonor is but the blasting of public breath let us be private only in
what we do, and there is no fear of that.


Er. Whilst there is heaven and conscience, there' no privacy for sin.


Du. there is no greater sin then uncharitablenes and want of love, and of that
you are highly guilty Erminia. Think on it, and though it be Empire to be
beautiful, yet Majesty and Beauty share Empire equally betwixt them, and
remember I Am your Prince.


Er. I do my Lord, and wod your Highness did but remember't too, and the mighty
obligation Princes have to be good and virtuous; who are to give example of
goodness, and virtue unto all. Princes are public fountains, from whose manners
all others are derived; and if they be infected once, a general infection
necessarily follows: -- and is this the example you give the Prince your Son?


Duk. Pho! he sees it not, and hears not of it.


Er. But statues, have ears, and eyes.


Pr. Will she discover me?


Alt. What will become of this? I must find out some means to send him hence,
or he will mar all. Exit.


Duke. Come, now we are alone, I must tell you, modesty's a habit Ladies wear
in public, and it becomes them well: but in private they always lay't aside,
and so should you. And if you would know the difference 'twixt the modest and
immodest, it is only this; the one puts off their modesties with their clothes,
the other before, that is all.


Er. I Will tell you my Lord another difference yet, the modest stop their ears
against such immodest purposes as these, and cannot endure to be where they are
spoke.


Duke. Stay, you will not leave me, I hope.


Er. I hope you will not force me? should you offer it, the very statues here
(I Am sure) wod stand up in my defense. The statue moves.


Duke. Ha!


Er. And see the God of War, in just resentment of the injury you offer to the
best of Warriors, begins to stir in it. Enter Althea hastily again.


Alt. Oh, Madam, Madam!


Er. What news!


Alt. My Lords' returned.


Er. Is It possible?


Du. How! without my privity, and unknown it cannot be.


Er. Beseech you my Lord be gone. to me Cleander loves me more then his life I
know, but his honor more then me. Imagine then what storms and tempests the
clouds of jealousy to see you here must raise in his noble mind.


Du. I Am so confounded I know not what to say, nor what to do. Exit.


Alt. So, let him go to's Duchess to cure his lovesick fever; she is young and
handsome and having so good remedy at home, what needs he seek abroad? But for
the Prince, the poor Prince, who is wholly unprovided, in truth it were charity
to help him.


Er. Well remembered help, help him away before my Lord comes, by any means.


Alt. There Is no fear of that: his coming was only a story feigned by me to
send the Duke away.


Er. Nothing else?


Pr. Excellent Wench, then I may be my self again. Leaps down. A noise of
sighting within.


Er. Hark, what noise is this! clashing of weapons? louder and louder still?
there is some fighting. Althea shut the doors and call up all our servants.
Exit.


Alt. What? hoa, Clinias, Cleobulo. Exit.


Pr. What should this be? the noise comes from the Garden door where I commanded
my followers to attend me, and let none enter, but make good that passage till
my return. I Will out and see what it is.


Draws, and Exit. SCENA, 7.
Enter one running meeting Clinias, Cleobulo. I. O Clinias! run, run.


Clin. What to do?


I. No matter for that: run, run I say,


Clin. But whither?


I. More interrogations! no matter for that neither; run, run, as you will
answer it. Exit.


Clin. Hurry, hurry, hurry, these fellows think no business can be done without
noise and bustle; and I must make a noise and bustle too, They Will think I Am idle
else. Whoo, whoo, whoo.


Enter Cleobulo with hands in his Pocket. Clin. Come come what haste you make
now? and all the house is in an uproar.


Cle. Therefore I make no more haste, I do not love these uproars and
hurly-burlies, I; but what is the matter can you tell?


Clin. Nay hang me if I know, or much care either; only if it be any fighting
matter, fight who is list for me, I have no mind unto't.


Cle. Faith nor I neither; wherefore and't say the word, let us to the cellar,
for that is a Sanctuary; and for reverence of god Bacchus I hope they will
respect it accordingly.


Cli. Content, but let us make haste then, for I hear some coming.


SCENA 8.
The Scene, Erminia's Garden-wall, terminated by the prospect of her Palace.
Cleander, Amynter, with their Swords drawn, taking off their false Beards. Am.
That sure was the Duke who first went hence, but who those other were, denied
us passage; or he who last came out disguised, and so fiercely assaulted us, I
do not know.


Cle. But I had known, or searched his heart for it, had they not rescued him.
and is this the so renowned Ermenia? for solitude, in my absence! she sat like
solitary Turtle in absence of its mate: no Anchoress more enclosed, no Recluse
more retired! to whom there is more resort, then ever was to Corinth in ancient
time, when Thais and Phrine were in their prime, those famous prostitutes;
prostituting her Fame and honor, if not her self. -- Thanks to my disguize for
this discovery, in which I thought to have ta'n her by surprise to our greater
joy; but now to my greater grief I Am more surpised my self.


Am. Indeed it is passing strange.


Cle. But from the witness of these eyes of mine I might not have believed it.
Why this is right Courtesan like: Bravo's disposed at door to let in Customers,
keep their pleasure free and undisturbed; the door's open to all, only debarred
to me, her Husband.


Am. Nay now you go too far with your suspicions.


Cl. I Will go farther yet, none knows of my arrival but only you; you shall
conceal me, and present me to her as a present sent from me in some disguise,
may gain me not only access into the house, but into her bosom too.


Am. Had you not better discover you presently, I do not like this seeking that
we should be loath to find, and hunting with our own curiosities, but our own
disquiets.


Cle. Our quiets rather, for so knowing for certain what now I but suspect, my
mind will be at rest, imagine else how miserable I should be, to have the marriage
bed poisoned with jealousy, and all its sweets embittered with the thought
that she is false? no, I like not this gentle handling wounds, which till
they are thoroughly searched, can never be thoroughly cured: I am resolved to try.
What e're may chance, of all evils the worst is ignorance.


Am. Pray Heavens you find not jealousy a worser yet, for ignorance though it
be a dull disease, yet it is not painful; it is a Lethargy of mind, benums us
so, as though we are sick, we know not how sick we are: but jealousy like the
Wolf, or Vipers brood knaws and tears out their very bowels, who breed it, and
give it food.


Cle. It Is not to be jealous, but free from jealousy I undertake this trial,
and to take my self off the painful rack of doubt.


Am. They make themselves more miserable then they were, who fall from what
they doubt to what they fear


C. Dispute it no more, I am resolved to try her; and as I find her faith and
Loyalty, away she goes, or else my Jealousy.

The Scene, a Garden. Aurindo. FIe on these men, let never woman trust them
more, for my sake, for they all are false, as is this Prince, this most
perfidious Prince, and all glory in deceiving them, as he, false as he is,
glories in deceiving me. What a lost thing am I? without a name and being;
neither what I was, nor what I am, Cyrena nor Aurindo: my very thoughts are
lost too in the Labyrinth of my self with thinking on it. -- Here by this
fountain side I Will lay me down and try whe'r I can sleep. if wearied slaves
whose bodies are oppressed with heavy burdens, would be glad to rest; much more
wod lovers, whose minds bear about a heavier weight within, then they without.

Sleep, sleep fair youth, for so, I do not see those murdering eyes, that kill me
with their sight yet wake, wake too, for whilst you sleep you take from me the
delight I have in seeing them, and your repose is my tormenting; but that which
most of all torments me, is the strife betwixt desire and shame to let him know
my love, like struggling twins tearing the womb that bears them: nor do I know
yet whether's the greater pain, either to lose my love, or lose my shame, -- I
must find out some way to secure both. Aurindo, Aurindo.


Aur. Ha! who calls?


Duc. It Is I.


Au. The Duchess! your pleasure Madam?


Duc. Look in that same Fountain, see if thou can find the portrait there of
one I dearly love.


Au. I see nothing Madam.


Du. Thou can not be so blind; or as thou resemblest Cupid the god of Love
in all things else, thou art ambitious perhaps to resemble him in blindness
too; look look well, I see it hither to.


Au. I see nothing but my self.


Duc. And is that nothing Fool? I must come down my self I see, or thou will
never find it.


Au. Now I know what portrait, it is she means, but it is not fit she know it, to
save her shame; from which if you but take away restraint of modesty once, all
other restraints are vain: is there no end? no mean of thy persecution love?
but I must be thus persecuted both actively and passively, thy Quiver and
Arrows both?


SCENA, 3.
The Duchess Aurindo below. Duc. Now have you found it yet?


Au. No Madam, yet I have sought and sought.


D. well, you may cease your search, no matter for the portrait, now the
original is so nigh.


Au. Where is it? I see it not.


Du. No! run presently to my apartment, fetch my mirror here, and I Will
convince thee to thy face thou do.


Au. How crafty and cunning she is, to conceal her love, and to declare it too?


Duc. Yet you may stay too, I Will be that glass this once, Look in mine eyes,
and thou shall find it there; look in my face, see if I do not blush.


Au. Madam I see no other blushes there, but such as Aurora, such as the
blushing Rose, or Beauty's self would wear.


Du. It Is very good, I am glad you are so courtly yet. -- Ay me! what can be
secret in a Lover, when their own blushes, their own loves discover? learn
learn Aurindo, if yet thou do not know, when ever thou hear'st one sighing
so, or see them blush, it is only for Love.


Au. What Is that? nothing but affected ignorance can secure me. Aside.


Duc. Nay, if thou know not, thou can not imagine how delicious a thing it
is to love, and be beloved; nor yet how great a pain it is to love, and not be
loved again.


Au. I know it alas! but too too well unto my grief. How she goes driving me
Aside. farther and farther still into the toils will inextricably entangle us
both, and how to avoid it I do not know.


SCENA, 4.
The Duke enters and starts back seeing them together. Duk. Ha!


Au. Madam my Lord the Duke.


Duc. He here!


Au. Never was poor condemned wretch awaiting every hour his execution, more
glad of his reprieve, then I am now of mine.


Duc. That he should come when I Would half past the shame, which now is wholly to
begin again? -- He looks as he were jealous too, to see us here together.


Duke. I like not this privacy, but the liberty of reprehension's lost, when we
our selves are guilty once, of that we'd reprehend in others.


Duc. My Lord I know not whether I should more wonder or rejoice, to see you
returned so soon; you said you went a hunting, and what sudden accident has
made you leave the Chase so soon?


Duke. Nothing, nothing, Enter Prince only I cod find no Game.


Prince. It Is true, and I Am glad you were frustrated as well as I. Aside. Enter
Anthenor and Leontius.


Duc. I must dissemble O my dearest delight of my delight, joy of my joy, how
do I love your sight? how jealous? how fearful I am of every thing? the
ground's too hard (me thinks) you tread upon, the air not soft enough you
breathe; and as often as any one looks on you, me thinks they usurp a right and
privilege belongs to me alone, -- I mean thee Aurindo. looking toward him.


Duke This is dissembling, and I must dissemble too; Aside. and I my dearest
when thou art absent dye, to think what happiness, what felicity they enjoy,
enjoy thy presence; and what delight they are deprived of, are deprived of thy
sight.


Enter Cleora and Olinda. Pr. He means Erminia I Am sure.


Leo. Hei day! here is brave courtship now; where shall you find a married
couple, and married so long too, so kind and complemental? this in a Gallant to
his Mistress, wod show handsomely now; but in a husband to his wife, looks as
ridiculously as to complement with ones self.


Ant. I, but there is more in it then so; it is all dissembling, rank
dissembling, not only pieces it out with the Fox's tail, but is all Fox, and
stinks; you may see it plain, for dissimulation whilst it is solicitous to do
enough, most commonly over does; and through its care to conceal its self, but
discovers it self the more.


Pr. Pray who was this Duchess before he married her?


Ant. Why, a Lady he married in second nuptials only for her beauty, the
frailer part of woman. and that which men are soonest cloyed with, which yet
she cunningly seasons so, she keeps him always in fresh appetite; and there is
nothing but my dearest, and my dearest with them.


Leo. See, see, how the Ladies slock about the Page?


Ant. I, this young and handsome is a bait catches women as fast as nux vomica
does crows, and intoxicates them much alike too. The modester sort of them, use
men as they do Lions, play with them when they are young, but grown old once,
they are afeard of them: and if the Page be modest too, let him look to himself,
for they will try what mettle he is made of.


Leo. Marry, heaven defend! Aside. for they will soon find him a counterfeit


Cleo. Fie, fie, you must learn more boldness, this modesty's virtue in the
Country, but vice in the Court; come to our Chambers we will read you a Lecture of
it, it is here, one of the Liberal Sciences.


Ant. A my conscience he is a Maid still, you may see by's blushing.


SCENA, 5.
Amynter, Duke, Duchess, Prince, etc. Duk. Amynter! welcome, welcome brave
Soldier, 'twas rumored Cleander was returned; and now I see 'twas but half
false, since you the one half, of him are here, and where is your other half?


Am. Great Sir yet he is not come, but will be shortly here; mean time by these
he kisses your Highness hands, with full information oth' state of your affairs.


Duke. We Are glad to hear from him, and should be much more glad to see him


Prin. I Am sure you would not, nor I neither. Aside.


Duke. And how does our valiant General


Am. As he does always Sir in time of war, sowing you battles, and reaping you
victories, which now the war's past, and glorious harvest done, he is binding up
in sheaves to bring you home.


Duk. Let Us see what he writes. The Duke reads.


Duc. Amynter you are welcome home. Am. kisses the Duchess hand, then the Prin.


Pr. And take my welcome too.


Duc. Tyrannous honor! cruel greatness! as if we were great only to be
miserable, and put on state, but to put off our selves; they may converse
freely with Aurindo now, without all fear of this man's talk, and that man's
jealousy, no honor lost: whilst I with all my greatness dare to do that the
least I wish the most. -- Cleora, Olinda, come hither, you were courting
Aurindo there, I saw it well enough: go too, I must, have you more modest, do you
see


Cleo. She Is jealous, Aside. and forbids us Aurindo's company, as severe Mrs.
forbid their maids eating those dainties they reserve for their own tooth and
pallat.


Duc. And how do you find him, ha!


Cli. A little bashful Madam, and nothing so bold as Pages are at Court.


Duc. You Will soon make him bold enough, if he frequent your company; he has some
secret outlet I fear for his affection, makes him no fuller of it, that
usually overflows in those of his age; for curiosity Cleora observe his haunts,
and let me know, do you hear?


Cle. I shall Madam.


Duc. I as much suspect the Dukes over kindness as his want of it; nor is it so
strange in nature, that so different effects should from the same causes grow.


Duke. Cleander like a valiant Soldier here recounting his noble actions,
writes modestly of himself, and shuns boast the Cowards valor.


Am. h'as learnt that lesson (sir) in the school of war, no language better
becomes a soldiers mouth, then silence of their own praises, who when they
once are their own trumpets, have never that of fames to found them forth; and
when from their high and glorious achievements once they fall so low as boast,
the glory of all their actions is lost.


Duke. And have you visited Erminia yet?


Am. My duty first performed unto yonr Highness, next is to visit her.


Duke, You Have Letters and commends from Cleander to her?


Am. I have my Lord, and amongst the rest am to commend unto her more freedom
and courtship; Cleander dos not like her sad and sullen retirement and solitude.


Duk. He Is wife in it, it shows him not jealous, which men would else suspect;
besides it more secures him of her: for women commonly most long for that
they are most debarred of, and take the restrain away, their longing ceases. Go,
remember me to her, and tell her we shall shortly visit her.


Am. I shall my Lord, -- that is it the train was laid for. Exit.


Duke. Still eyeing the boy? of such light sparks as those your fires are
kindled, unextinguishably inflame the marriage bed with jealousy. Hark you
Anthenor, do you observe our Duchess, not that we suspect her, but only to
preserve her from suspect; you are wise I know* and understand.


Ant. So I Have got an office now; sure his Highness takes me to have more wit or
less honestly then I have, that he imployes me in spyery, but I must stretch
both a little now, to serve him.


Duke. Come my dearest, thus by short intervals we rise from feasts, only to
return with greater appetite, let me glut mine eyes with pleasure once, gen and
in full draughts take down the sight of thee* whilst I can never accord satiety
and fruition together. Exeunt omnes. manent.


SCENA, 6.
Anthenor, Leontius, Cleora after. Leo. Again at his complements?


Ant. I and again at his dissembling, mean time they are either of them as
jealous as neighboring States, and jealousy of all vices in old men's is the
greatest; for it is not only jealousy, but envy too. -- And what difference
in faith betwixt a Bawd and Spy now?


Leo. Why they are in the contrary extremes, the one hinders love matters, the other
furthers them; besides a, Spy is a State Bawd, and a Bawd a womanspy.


Ant. Nay, if that be all, Enter Cleora. I shall love my employments the better
for it, and go about it with more cheerfulness and alacrity; but see Cleora,
she tarries for somewhat: and as women always imagine there is some ill in all
men say, so we to be quit with them always imagine there is some ill in all they
do. -- I Will to her, -- sweet Cleora if there be any thing wherein I may serve
you, know. --


Cleo. What do I know? that you are more troublesome and importune, then Flies
and Wasps in summer: and for your service y'd best set up a Bill, or go to the
office of Address, to tell what a serviceable man you are, and amongst your
other good qualities be sure you put in your short neck like a roasted Pig,
your smirking and fleering, as much as to say, Who Will laugh at me? and your
stubble beard for kissing costs us more Pomatum. -- I Would as lief kiss through a
hair sive.


Ant. I there it is now, your smooth faced boys carry it clearly away from us
bearded men; and it is with kissing as it is with bowling, they love not rough
grounds for fear of rubs, but in a smooth Alley they trundle it away, and so I
will too, for I Have enough of her.


Exit with Leontius. Cleo. My Lady sets me to watch Aurindo now, and though
this playing the spy in love matters be no hard task, yet it is a ticklish one;
and I imagine to find as much pleasure and delight in it as they, who look
upon the Game whilst others play.


SCENA, 7.
The Prince, Aurindo, Cleora. See where he comes and the Prince with him, I Will
stand here and stretch mine ears upon the tenters this once to over-hear them.


Aur. It grieves me to see him so sad and pensive, and I Would fain comfort him,
and try whether I can do that for him, I have more need another should do for me.
-- If It may not appear too great a boldness to ask your Highness, I should desire
to know, why you are so sad and pensive; sure my Lord it can be nothing but love
that makes you so, the gentle companion of every gentle breast.


Prin. Thou Art in the right boy, and since thou have seen so far into me; I Will
make no difficulty to declare unto thee all the rest, and tell thee who it is I
love too.


Aur. God of desire, now grant it may be I. Aside,


Pri. Thou know the fair Erminia I Am sure, she who as far outshines all
other beauties, as the Sun all other lights, it is she I love.


Aur. Disloyal and persidious. Aside. can I hear this, and not hate him for it?
-- and pray my Lord did you never love before?


Pri. Yes a little at Argos once for fashion sake, but that now is quite
forgot, and my heart by loves fire tempered to a delicate softness, has of late
received another impression has quite effaced that.


Aur. Learn, learn all ye deceived, Virgins learn what temper false men's hearts
are made of, and how you are deceived by them. -- And does she give ear unto your
suit?


Pr. Oh no! but is as deaf unto't, Ulysses to the Sirens cod be no more,
against whose charms he obstinately stopped his ear, and none hear worse then
those who will not hear.


Aur. Heaven then is just I see, and punishes him for's falsehood unto me.


Pr. But methinks thou art sad and pensive too, now I consider it better, and
by thy own rule, I should guess thou were in love too. --


Au. Who I? I can assure your Highness, if I have any love it is only love of
you.


Pr. Thanks gentle Boy, I Have always experienced thee loving and trusty; and to
repay thy trust, I Will not only make thee confident of my love, but advocate
too to plead for it unto Erminia.


Aur. Cruel office; and is it not enough to be undone, but I must be made
instrument my self of my own undoing? and if this be the reward of my faith and
love, how wod he reward my hate and disloyalty?


Pr. Thou shall to Erminia then, Speaking this, removing nearer Cleora. Althea
will introduce thee, give her but this jewel from me, and hark thee. --


Cle. All I can o're-hear of their discourse, is, Aurindo is going to Erminia,
and Althea's to introduce him; it is enough of intelligence for once, this goes
unto the Duchess. Exit.


Prin. Go, and make me ever happy. Exit.


Aur. And my self ever unhappy by it, what shall I do? but what a question's
that? those who deliberate have some will of their own, but I have none; with
resolution great as is my love then, I Will go and plead for him against my self;
and though my heart disavow all my tongue says, yet it shall say it, or I Will
disavow it to be mine: no matter for the pain I suffer, who truly love do know.

" no pleasure, no contentment is above
" the delightful pain we suffer for those we love.

ACTUS 3.
SCENA I.
Cleander like an Ethiope, Amynter. The Scene, Erminia's Palace. Cleander.
You Are sure the Duke will visit her.


Am. I Am sure, if he love her he will rather dye then fail; and if he fails, it is
sign he loves her not.


Cle. It Is well, make haste to present me to her then, I wod be present at
their parley and interview; and what do you think? am I sufficiently disguised?


Am. Disguised! you are changed, and are no more Cleander; Proteus was never so
transformed: I, who know you even doubt whether it be you, and were your
thoughts but changed as all the rest, your self would doubt whether 'twere your
self or no.


Cle. Then do you tell her I Am both deaf and dumb, that so having provided for
all without, that nothing from within may issue forth to betray me, I Will shut
up the port of speech, and my thoughts shall hold no intelligence with my
tongue.


Am. Peace, here comes some of the house, you will see how they will wonder to see me
here.


SCENA, 2.
Althea to them, then Erminia, Clinias, Cleobulo. Alt. How Amynter! my Lords
inseparable companion and bosom friend! O madam, madam, who is here do you think?
Enter Erminia, Clinias, Cleobulo after.


Fr. Ha, Amynter! was it instinct or prophecy in thee, to say my Lord was come?


Alt. I know not, I Am sure I meant it for a lie; and if it should prove true now,
what should I say, but I Have good luck with lying.


Er. Amynter, to me who never joy'd since Cleander went, it is twylight of joy
to see you; and such a promise of seeing Cleander here, as is Aurora of seeing
the day: and where is he, I see him not?


Am. Madam, he sends you all health and happiness, with the assurance he will
shortly be here.


Er. Shortly! how shortly? all time seems too long, an hour a day, a day a
year, a week an age, until I see him; and there is no health nor happiness for
me without him.


Clea. Dissembler. Aside.


Am. Mean time by these he kisses your fair hands, and by me presents you with
this Ethiope here, Emblem of his affection, whose color can never change.


Er. And I Will keep him as emblem of mine, what qualities has he?


Am. A more trusty servant no where lives then he, more valiant, nor more
intelligent, although both deaf and dumb.


Er. What means he now? you understand his signs.


Am. With all humility he dedicates himself and service to ye, and vows
perpetual faith. He bows, kisses his hands, and lists them up to heaven.


Er. And now!


Am. He solemnly protests he will fight and dye for you. He draws his sword, in
action of fighting, then sets it to his breast.


Er. A goodly personage, -- but let me read my Letters,


Alt. Hum! deaf and dumb! pretty qualities to sit in the chimney corner: let us
see for's dumbness, I like that well enough, he will not tell tales; and for his
deafness too, it is no great matter, men naturally understand what women wod
have them do; were he blind too, he would make the better husband, only I like
not his color: But for that all men are black in the dark, and I may chance to
try him one of these nights.


Cli. And art not thou glad now my Lord is coming home?


Cleo. Why should we be glad fool? we shall be only Clinias and Cleobulo, a
couple of poor slaves still; but what a fellow servant has he sent us here?
both deaf and dumb! what shall we do with him?


Cli. Why, we will be sure to put all the work of the house upon him, let him put
it off again as well as he can; best is we may use him as we lift, he cannot
complain of us.


Cleo. But is he not too gallant to work do think?


Cli. We Will make him do it, for all his Gallantry.


Cle. Do You think he will suffer it? he seems a sturdy piece.


Cli. We Will make him suffer it too, for all his sturdiness, I Will warrant you.


Cleo. Content then


Er. How Is this? he writes me here, he would have me quit my sadness and solitude,
and be more free and courtly. If this be his pleasure, he has strangely changed
his mind; but I am all obedience, and am not to dispute but to obey his will:
and how has he his health well?


Am. Passing well. all his malady is only want of you.


Er. And why is he not his own Physician then? no wounds I hope?


Am. None dangerous, all he had are now converted to honorable scars.


Er. But that I fear to trouble you with my questions, I should never cease
questioning you.


Alt. Madam the Duke.


Cleo. Now, now.


SCENA, 3.
The Duke, Erminia, Cleander, Amynter, the rest retire. Am. I will observe
them. stands concealed


Du. why now the clouds of sadness ar overblown y' appear like your self the
bright Erminia: So beauty should appear, cheerful and gay, nature's best
ornament, only the wise know how to wear, the foolish mar in the wearing. And
now you have elevated again your fair and long dejected eyes, with hope to see
Cleander shortly here; whilst you cast them every ways about to look for him,
I hope a glance at least may light on me.


Er. Your Highness is not to be looked upon so slightly.


Clea. Now, now it begins.


Er. I look upon you as my Sovereign Lord and Prince.


Duk. That Is at too great a distance, look on me as one who admires and honors
you, and your lover rather.


Clea. I, there it is.


Er. That my Lord were too great presumption, and no less impudence, in one
already married.


Cleo. She cunningly holds off to draw him on.


Duk. Think not of that: marriage of its self is a tie strait enough, we need
not straiten it more with superfluous nicety; but let us talk no more of it, --
I Have somewhat to say in private to ye, but send that Slave away.


Er. He Is both deaf and dumb my Lord, and's presence can be no hinderance to
what you have to say,


Duk. But he can see though; and it is not fit what we do in private should be
seen by every one.


Er. It Is fit for those have care of their fames and honors; and for me, I will
do nothing but what I cared not, though all the world did see.


Clea. I like that answer well, it is discreet and modest. -- If I should be
deceived in her, never was man more glad to find his hopes true, then I should
be to find my fears were false.


Duk. You talk of honor, know Princes are the fountains of it; and there is none
but what does flow from them, all is honorable they do, so is my love.


Er. Nothing is honorable, that is not virtuous too; make your love so then;
else you might as well call Vice, Virtue; and Hell, Heaven; as Lust, Love; and
Dishonor, Honor; as you do. Know my Lord, the acts of marriage are such, as
matrimony it self (holy as it is) can scarcely make honorable and lawful; but
imagine how dishonorable and unlawful they must needs be without it then.


Clea. What a wretch and villain I was ever to suspect her?


Duk. Come you think you do a high act of justice now, to be true unto
Cleander; but alas you are deceived, justice consists in equality, and equality
there is none; you should be true to him, that is false to you.


Er. Should any but your Highness tell me so, I Would say he lied, most basely lied:
Cleander false? the Gods, Truth it self' wod as soon be false as he.


Clea. My own dear dear wife.


Duke. Ha, ha, ha, I pity you, to see you so abused, and to disabuse you; know
Cleander has another Mistress in Attica he warms with his embraces, whilst Erminia
in her cold bed freezes here: why should he tarry so long away else think you,
the wars now at an end?


Er. And is that all your argument? how ill you argue Sir, as if gold by the
touchstone should be rendered false, or men guilty by tiral of their innocence:
absence is the only touchstone and trial of our loves; in it we but repeat by
heart that lesson, which in presence we learned before. And as in presence of
those we love we are all eyes, so in absence we are all thought of them; as I
am of Cleander, and I Am sure he is of me.


Clea. My dearest dearest wife still.


Er. And was it for this you sent him to the wars. to overthrow your enemies
abroad, at price thus of my overthrow at home? he is much obliged to ye sure, and
now I see 'twas not to honor him, but dishonor me.


Duk. This will not do, I must try some other way. -- Aside. Come, I wod not
force what I might obtain by gentleness.


Er. You wod not? you cannot Sir; -- talk to me of force! should you but offer
it, I Would sooner kill my self then suffer it: Draws her knife. unhand me as you
love my life my Lord, as you love your own life do; do you not see him look
there as he would kill you presently, lest you desist.


Duke. Ha! the villain looks terribly indeed, and I Am afeard of him: Gods and
fiends I think conspire to defend her from me, and hinder my pursuit, I Am
resolved yet to go on, spite of them. -- Farewell, your Bravo has saved you
this once, make much of him, but I shall find a time. -- Exit.


Er. Althea, where is this woman? Enter Althea.


Alth. Here Madam.


Er. And why not here? you must be always leaving me alone; either wait
closer, or I shall provide me of those who will.


Alth. Pardon me Madam, when a Lord and Lady are together, it is good manners in
the waiting woman, and part of their breeding (I take it) to leave them alone.


Er. Is It so? go too, you are grown so impudent of late, (whatsoere's the matter)
you are quite marred again; or mend it, or you and I must part, -- look to it. Exit.


Alt. I, say you so? then it is time to look to it indeed. Exit.


SCENA, 4.
Cleander, Amynter. Cle. O friend was ever man more happy in a wife then I am
in Erminia? did observe (for thou heardst all I know) how she answered the
Duke? how she confounded him? and made even impudence it self to blush, whilst
chastity like a Phoenix burnt in her eyes with anger and indignation at his
unchaste purposes, and darted lightning at him. Oh ye Gods! Erminia is as white
I see as is her name or innocence it self, and I Am o'rejoy'd with it.


Am. I joy you have found her so.


Clea. You wod not have had me jealous now, and see what is come on it, without
my jealousy I Would never known thus much.


Am. I am most glad you have so good issue of it, and that jealousy its parent's
dead that gave it life; and what will ye do now?


Cle. What! but instantly cast off my disguize, and discover me unto her -- but
stay! who is this? more visitants!


SCENA 5.
Aurindo meeting Althea, Cleander, Amynter. Am. Althea, happily incountred, I
was just seeking you.


Al. And I Am glad of it, for I was just thinking on you; and see how ones
thoughts will come to pass! well what is your business? whatsoever it be, you are
like to speed, I can tell you that.


Au. Take heed Althea. that whatsoever has a large extent, and she who promises
that denies nothing, not so much as her self.


Alt. Well concluded I promise you, you have studied Grammar and Logic too I see,
and want not Rhetoric neither for a need I Will warrant you.


Au. Indeed and I have need to use my Rhetoric; please you to help me but to
speech of your Lady.


Alt. Marry come up here, no wonder indeed you are grown so dainty! will no body
but my Lady serve your turn? am not I good enough for you I pray? she is for
your Master, wod you should well know.


Au. And it is from him I desire to speak with her who recommends him to you by
this jewel.


Al. A noble Prince he is, I Will say that for him, and bounteous and liberal
withal, you have few such Princes now adays: he was in a great fright (so were
we all) when he was last with my Lady. -- Well, did my Lord but know how I
labor for him. --


Clea. He knows it, and thou shall know he does too. Aside.


Au. Well hark then!


Clea. Hell and confusion! do you hear how she'as been visited? I Am just like a
mariner newly escaped one storm, and even arrived unto the port, when by
another, he is driven to sea again, in greater danger then ever he was before:
the Prince visit her, and handsome boys? to be rid of my jealousy, O th'Duke
is nothing; for what avails it one h'as many thorns prick him, for easing of
his pain to have one plucked out, and all the rest remain. -- I Am as jealous as
e're I was before. Exit.


Al. Well, though my Lady be in ill humor now, and very stanch of her visits
(as they say) for the Princes sake yet, I Will try what I can do; and for your
self, though I Have partly made a vow never to marry, I know not yet how I should
be tempted, should you offer to marry me.


Au. But I Will never tempt you I Will promise you. yet for my Lords sake I must
humor her; Aside. and dear Althea, for my part I promise you, if ever I marry
any woman it shall be you.


Alt. That Is some comfort yet, I Would fain have somewhat in hand though, to be
doing with; but come I Will bring you to my Lady.


SCENA, 6.
The Duchess Cleora, Althea after. Duc. And are you sure he went to Erminia's?


Cle. Sure Madam 'twas so appointed, and Althea was to have the introducing him.


Duc. Did I not tell you he had some secret haunt? I knew it I, there is no
deceiving me. -- See this dissembling boy, you shall sooner find Spring
without flowers, and Autumn without fruit, then without loving thoughts, a
youthful mind, it is the proper fruit, and flowers of the season.


Enter Althea. Al. So I have brought him to my Lady, who was nothing nigh so
much offended and surpised with it as I imagined. -- Who Is here the Duchess?


Duc. And Althea too must be their Bawd! that old Hag, that Witch, go seek her
out, and bring her hither strait; if she conceal their secret meetings,
tortures shall enforce it from her.


Alt. Ha! she has heard it seems of the Dukes visiting my Lady, I Would best
confess it e're she put me to the torture; I Am melancholy enough to lie in bed
alone, and apprehend this lying on the rack a far more melancholy business;
besides I know not how my bones will hold out, beshrew me.


Cleo. She Is here Madam.


Al. Indeed I must confess, speak this trembling. and't like your Highness he
visits my Lady sometimes.


Duc. Oh does he so!

Duc. Is he so hot upon it?


Alt. But this I can assure your Highness, it is much against my will and

Duke. How comes she to know that? I Would best make no secret then of what she
knows already, lest she suspect some farther secret in it, more then she knows.
-- Well, what if I visit Erminia sometimes? it is but to comfort her in her
solitude and sadness in her husbands absence.


Duc. Ha! this is a discovery I looked not for; -- Aside. it is well my Lord
you are very charitable to other men's wives in their absence, and give me example
what to do when you are absent with other women's husbands too; and is this your

Duke. What have I done? betrayed my self? this is this foolish conscience

gone enraged, and rage that in petty bosoms, as winds in narrow brooks, makes
small commotion; in mighty ones raises as fearful storms, as boisterous winds

Er. Is It possible! comparing what I hear, with what I see, I can no ways

Pri. And how did find her, ha?


Au. Beyond expectation kind, she hearkened to me, and that is half consent,

Cle. Thou were the wiser; for love indeed is but a sort of madness: and as you
have several sorts of mad folks, so you have of Lovers; some sad, some merry,
some mild and gentle, some raving and furious again; and for these, the
Pazzarello was well invented, whither shortly my Lady must be sent I think; for

Duk. Well, well.


Duc. Nay what is more, h'as not only attempted the honor of my women here,
but even attempts the honor of Erminia too.


Duk. Ha! does he so? nay then we will not only banish him the Court, but City

Ant. Do You mark how that heats him, he was cold before?


Leo. I do.


Duc. I will not tell you how insolent he was to tempt even me my self, not to
expose his life to danger, and my honor too; that he should dare to do it, and
hope to live.


Leo. His life thirsted after too, nay then I see nothing's more insatiate then
women in their love, or in their hate.


Duk. Though for's insolency I confess he deserves to die, yet in regard of's
tender years so thou my dearest be content, I am content to spare his life.


Duc. Our sex is soft and gentle, as it becomes us to be merciful; but think my
Lord whe'r't becomes you or no, and't may not appear in you, too great neglect
both of my honor and your own.


Leo. Then I see no Tigress, nor Lioness, nor Aspick trod on, is more fell and
cruel, then cruel women.


Duk. Content thy self dearest with his banishment, we would not kill, where we
might safely spare.


Duc. Mistaken clemency! misplaced goodness! who spare the guilty are cruel to
the innocent; best tarry till h'ave left nothing in the Court inviolate, even
to the Royal bed; nay till his lust like a violent spreading torrent overflows
and involves Erminia' honor too, gaining her the dishonorable repute of a
foul Strumpet, and base Prostitute.

Duke. Cease mourning then, and reckon your loss among those remediless
misfortunes can never be remedied with mourning.


Er. Your Highness highly honors me; but comfort (my Lord) 's a work of time:
first we must grieve, e're we be comforted; there are certain decencies of
widdow-hood, which for widows to neglect, is to neglect their fame: many a
shower of tears must fall first, and many a gust of sighs blow over, e're it
clear up again. In fine, comfort's the physic of grief and sorrow, and no
feverish body in Crisis of their Fever takes physic: that once over, all the
comfort becomes or me to take, or you to give, I willingly shall admit; mean
time I leave you, and humbly beseech your Highness to leave me to my grief.


Duk. Peace to your thoughts Erminia, nor shall I ever take that peace away by
any act of mine; so recommending to you a moderation of your grief and sorrow,
I take my leave, -- this is some comfort yet. Exit.


Er. He Is gone, and I but dally with my grief, fancying Cleander not dead,
whilst no other difference is 'twixt death and absence, but only this; t'one's
a short death, the other a long absence; so he whilst absent for the time is dead

leave him in his ignorance, and so perplex him, and strew his way with thorns;
I Will make him weary of it, and glad at last, when he cannot go forwards to

Pri. Dearest Madam, if at such a time, when other widows griefs are at the
height, I come to persuade you, let yours fall, and take comfort in the place
on it: I hope you will pardon me, when you shall see, I bring you a full comfort,
not an empty one of words only, whilst in lieu of your dead husband, I come to
offer you a living one; and such an one, 'tmay be no boast to say, (add but
your esteem to it) does every way equal Cleander. I mean my self.


Er. This falls out happily to my desire; -- Aside. my Lord, although you might
justly wonder I should so soon be comforted, and so far forget my first Lord, to
accept a second; whilst other widow; strictness is so great, first days of
their widowhood, they scarce admit so much as the light it self to comfort
them, (the general comforter of all the world) yet coming in so honorable a
way as marriage, I know not what to say; but were I assured your Highness
intents were but as honorable and real. --


Pri. The words and actions of dying men are not more real I swear.


Er. There are those who love you, dearly love you (I can tell you that) though
their shames will not suffer them to declare so much.


Pr. And why so?


Er. To hide their shames then, come but in the dark to night unto my chamber.

Pr. Enough.


Er. And there after the holy vows of marriage. --


Pri. I understand.


Er. You shall enjoy her for your wife. --


Pr. Oh me most happy! you overjoy me Madam.


Er. Go then, and do not fail.


Pr. Which if I do, may I fail to live. Exit.


Er. Now for Cyrena, she shall change habits, and veiled appear like me: pardon
me sacred truth, if in so good a cause I transgress a little, it is not to
violate thy laws, but preserve them from greater violation. Exit.


Cle. Why, she is married already.


Am. Can you blame her? believing you dead, and you letting her go on in the

Cle. No matter, let her go on her way, I Will go mine. --


Am. And lose your self.


Cle. And trace her through all her ways.


Am. And err in all, do'nt you see; you are just like one, who entering a
Labyrinth, farther he goes, the farther still he strayes; or one puzzled with
tying a Gordian knot, which he can never untie.


Cle. How you are deceived! I do but as Hunters now, who following the Chase,
mind not so much their way, nor pains they take, as taking of the prey; and
for the Gordian knot you speak of, I know how to cut that which I cannot unty.


Am. Had you not better discover your self now, and do that with ease, you
cannot do else, without much toil and pain,


Cle. Have patience a little. there are farther mysteries yet I must reveal,
e're I reveal my self, especially that of the boys concealment.


Am. Of that I Will say nothing, 'cause I know not what to say; but for the rest
I dare engage my life, and should dye martyr in so good a cause; she is all
honorable, and honor and she are twins, and so alike 'twere no mistake to say,

so bright after a long Eclipse.


Cyr. Nay now you flatter me.


Er. I wod to heaven men wod believe so, 'twod acquit our sex of envy, and I
should easily be acquit of flattery, for none can doubt but they must be rather
envious who praise you not, then flatterers who do.


Cy. Nay if you hold on, you will give me a beauty I had not, and make me blush.


Er. I ought rather to blush, you have so little help, but 'twas your desire
for greater secrecy, and secrets lose their virtue, just like precious perfumes
when once disclosed, and more they are hid the more they conserve their
pretiousness. Pray let me help you, this curse's a little too long.


Cy. Pardon me Madam.


Er. Beseech you it is but my duty, you are not used to these petty things, and
it is so long since you saw your self dressed, you and your mirror Speaks all
this in dressing her. well may be to seek.


Cy. How much am obliged unto you dear Erminia?


Er. Dearest Madam, think I was only born to serve you; where was the Prince's
judgment (I wonder) where were his eyes? having seen this beauty once, he cod
ever look on any other?


Cy. He might be well excused, having seen yours once, to have quite forgotten
mine.


Er. Mine! alas it is never to be seen on the same day with yours, nor ever so
much as to be mentioned with it; nor do I say this out of complement now, but
merely out of consciousness of mine own defects. Stay a little more, and I have
done.


Cy. Sweet Erminia, you make me even bankrupt with your courtesies.


Er. Sweetest Madam, I shall think you tax me with want of it, if you speak any
more of it.


SCENA, 6.
Cleander rushes in, Erminia, Cyrena. Er. What rudeness is this?


Cle. Now for my revenge, -- ha! what is here? the boy vanished! and a woman in
the place! what strange apparitions are these? what wondrous delusions of the
sight? there is witchcraft in it sure! Stares wildly about, and exit. I cannot
believe mine eyes.


Er. what means this Moor, he is grown strangely jealous of me of late,
(whatsoere's the matter) and I begin to fear him.


Cy. I was afeard h'ad come to apprehend me.


Er. Pardon me Madam, I Am ashamed you should find such rudeness here, but trust
to it, you shall be put no more to these affrights. -- Come pray be merry, if
the Prince should chance to sleep in your arms to night instead of mine, I hope
your Highness wod not be offended at the mistake.


Cy. Imagine sweet Erminia by your self, whether you would be offended Cleander
should do the like by you.


Er. I fear my happiness is not yet so nigh, though I wish yours may, so now
all here is prepared, I Will go and put all in prepare without for the Prince's
reception, and leave you the while to the entertainment of your better
thoughts. Exit.


Cy. As those who walk over fearful precipices avert their eyes not to behold
their danger, so I avert my thoughts from thinking on mine, only this I find
too clear. "love's a solicitous thing, and full of fear. Exit.


SCENA, 6.
The Duchess, Althea, Cleora. Duc. Thanks Althea for thy intelligence, and the
Duke shall thank thee too, go thou before, and wait to give us entrance, I Will
but go advertise the Duke, and instantly follow thee.


Al. I shall Madam. Exit.


Duc. They shall not steal a marriage in the dark, I Will light their nuptial
Tapers up, and for Aurindo I Am glad I Have found him; I (...) feared h'ad fled my
anger, and escaped my revenge, which now he shall find after this little stop,
like violent torrents stopped, which grow but more violent after, then e're they
were before. Exit.


Cleo. She Is gone enraged, and nothing's more impetuous then woman's rage, no
battering Ram demolishingston walls to dust, nor violent thunder riving whole
forests, and shivering mighty oaks like slender reeds; woe to poor Aurindo must
stand the shock of it, -- wod I Would some body to tell this news to now; no
cholick, no strangury, nor pangs of childbirth were e're half so painful, as
the retention of news, to a woman that longs to be delivered of it; and here
comes some body.


SCENA, 7.
Olindae, Cleora, Anthenor, Leontius following. Cle. O Olindo! hast' heard the
news of Aurindo?


Ol. No, what is it?


Cle. He Is at Erminia's, and just now there is order given to apprehend him.


Ol. Alas!


Cle. But you must say nothing now.


Ol. Pho, no avaritious body holds money faster then I do secrets you know. O
Anthenor have you heard the news of Aurindo? Enter Anthenor.


Ant. No, pray what?


Ol. Why he is apprehended at Erm^^^'s, and presently to dye; the Scaffold's
already set up for him, but you must say nothing.


Aut. That Is understood, now am I bound to tell it the next I meet.


Cle. You keep secrets sweetly, I Will tell you news another time; and you make
it more then it is too.


Ol. How wod you have newsmongers live else?


Ant. O Leontius! have you heard the news of Aurindo? Enter Leontius.


Le. For heavens love, what?


Cle. I Will tell it.


Ol. No let me. They strive.


Ant. Will you over run me? why he is apprehended at Erminia's, and instantly to
dye; he is on the scaffold by this.


Cle. See if he have not added more unto it yet?


Le. Nay then, it is time to discover him, be the danger what it will, I Am sure
there can be no more, then there is in the concealing him.


Cle. Stay, stay, and take the news of the Prince along with you.


Leo. I thank you, I have no leisure to hear it now.


Cleo. I Will tell it you then.


An. Pardon me, I must be gone too. Exit.


Ol. And I Will to the Presence with my news. Exit.


Cle. She gone too! now am I in no less pain then I was before for some body to
tell the rest of my news to; thus does she serve me still when I trust her with
any, all women are leaking vessels, and can hold nothing, God help them. But of
all commend me to her. Exit.


SCENA 8.
Erminia, Althea, the Prince following. Er. Althea stay you here, and when the
Prince comes, direct him into my Cabinet, but without light be sure; I Will in
and see all the lights extinguished there. Exit.


Alt. I, hide you, do, cast clouds of night upon your faults, and you fast as
you hide them, I Will bring them unto light; and what you seek to keep secret
I Will proclaim, till to all the world I Have published your shame. --


Enter Prince. Oh my Lord, you are welcome, my Lady expects you there within, you
need no light, love can find the way best in the dark.

Pr. With thy good directions Althea, there is somewhat for thy pains.


Alt. And there is her Cabinet.


Pr. Now to reap the long expected fruit of all my happiness. Exit.


Alt. Send you a good harvest of it, I Will send you sickles enough presently to
help you, and those will help too, to fetch it in for you. -- Aurindo! and the
Prince too! she might have left me one of them at least, but I Will fit her for
it.


SCENA, 9.
Cleander, Amynter following. Clea. Wod I Would never imbarkt my self upon this
perilous sea, where it is dishonor to go back, and assured ruin to go on; to
discover me now, every one wod laugh at me; and to conceal me longer, I should
run such desperate hazard, it is horror to think upon -- To marry so soon a
second husband, e're the funeral rites and obsequies of the first are
celebrate, no blacks, no mourning, my memory like a shadow gone with my self;
her grief for me not half so durable as other widows watery colored ones,
which only a tear or two can wash away; is this her love of me? then farewell
all my love of her; it is sign the Prince and she have lived before in close
adultery, and will do so again unless she dye; nor less h'ad known it formerly,
cod he find the way now so readily to her bed; since I am dead to her then,
she shall be so to me; and the hour of her marriage shall be her hour of death;
these hands shall kill her, these eyes shall see her dead, though this heart of
mine burst at the sight of it, mine honor's engaged, and I Am resolved. Exiturus.


Am. Now friend, Enter Amynter. whither away so fast?


Cle. Pardon me, I have no leisure to tell you now. Exit.


Am. There is some mystery in this haste of his, and's great thoughts labor
with some mighty birth. -- On what a turbulent sea has his jealousy embarkt
him? and so embroiled him as without miracle he can never disimbroil himself
again; and if this be the fate of marriage to be in hell, of loathing, if their
wives be foul; and if fair, in purgatory of jealousy; marry who is list for me.


SCENA, 10.
The Duchess, Duke, Althea, Amynter, etc. Duc. Where Is this great Commandress
of all hearts? commands as absolutely as fate it self; this tyrant beauty, that
needs only say, render your hearts, and all hearts must obey, I long to see
her, let some seek out the boy, I Will seek out her my self. Enter Duke.


Duk. Where Is this curious Lady? in whose nice bosom no flowers must be worn,
but fresh and blooming buds; others as overblown and canker-eaten, she rejects
and scorns.


Duc. Where is her chamber?


Alt. There.


Duc. What, hoa within there? open the door, or else we will break it op'. knocks.


Duk. Where is this newly married pair? let them appear, we come to wish them
joy.


SCENA, 11.
The Prince, Cyrena veiled, Cleander the other way. Pr. Who Is that that knocks
so rudely? ha! the Duke and Duchess; no matter, fear not, fear not my Erminia,
for now thou art mine.


Duc. Shame of thy honor, a Prince, and own a base ignoble strumpet for thy
wife!


Clea. Now now, -- how is this?


Cy. I am nor base, nor strumpet, Draws to kill them when she unveils. but as
great a Princess as your self, Princess of Argos. Enter Leontius.


Pr. Ha! Cyrena!


Duc. And Aurindo she! how was I deceived?


Leo. The Princess already discovered!


Clea. Now all of the boy is clear, but that the news of my death should strike
her no more. --


Am. Thunder cod not have more struck her you saw, till I assured her 'twas
false, and only invented to deceive her, when she to assist the Princess in
her love turned the deceit on them.


Clea. Enough, enough, 'now all have cast off their vizards, it is time to cast
off mine, I Will instantly go and discover my self unto her. Exit.


Alt. Whither goes the Moor in such haste I wonder? I Will after him and see.
Exit.


Pr. Wonder and amazement seizes me!


Cy. Wonder not Prince, nor admire your Page should turn your handmaid now, this
is the least miracle that love can do; I am that Cyrena you promised marriage
to at Argos, who have hither to Misseua followed you to claim your promise
which now you have anew confirmed.


Pr. Miracle of constancy! compared with your goodness, my ill appears so
great, methinks no penance can be great enough for expiating it.


Cy. This shall be all your penance, and this.


Embraces him. Pr. And this is the only one that I desire.


Duc. Now Madam I hope you will pardon me, for putting you to the proof and
declaration of your sex, which I suspected through your disguise,


Cy. There needs no pardon Madam; where the offense was to Aurindo, not to me.


Enter Althea. Duk. But where is Erminia all this while, the great Architectress
of all this plot?


Alt. For her you shall find her there within, in the Moors arms straightly
embraced, (my Lord) and by this time perhaps in bed together too.


Duc. Was ever a more lascivious strumpet?


Duk. Where are our Guards? go fetch her hither strait with her fair Paramour;
so foul an act as this deserves a public shame and punishment, however in
private done.


Cy. Erminia thus dishonor her self! or honor with justice is fled to heaven,
and there is none on earth, or else all this is false.


SCENA, 12.
Cleander, Erminia guarded, Amynter, Climas, Cleobulo, etc. Duk. Bring them
away, is this the honorable Lady, nothing cod dishonor her above temptation,
above suspect? -- no body to serve her lust but a Moor, a slave! and one
fittest she thought to conceal her shame, 'cause mute and dumb! but here are
enough beside to publish it; away with her, and to the gallows with that slave.


Cli. Cleo. I, hang him, hang him.


Clea. Stay, rather then her fame shall suffer, the mute shall speak, and more
to evince the miracle and declare her innocence, the Ethiope shall turn white.


Alt. Cleander! Discovers himself.


Cli. My Lord, there is none rejoices more then my fellow andI, for this your
metamorphose, we had as lief see the devil, as see your black face.


Cleo. We had rather a great deal have you our master then our fellow servant,
you don't beat us half so much.


Duk. Noble Cleander I must demand your pardon for trying Erminia's constancy
in your absence, assure your self 'twas done with good intent.


Cle. I shall believe it, and considering the prosperous estate I Have left your
affairs in, I hope your Highness will easily pardon my return from Attica
without your license.


Duk. I do, and with you all happiness with your fair and virtuous wife.


Pri. And I the like.


Cle. I humbly thank your Highness, and desire to be no longer happy then my
friend Amynter may be so with me.


Er. For you Althea (another time whent't may not appear revenge as it wod now)
I shall entreat you seek another service.


Alt. With all my heart, and I hope your Highness then will entertain me.


Duc. Not I; you who wod be false to her, will never be true to me.


Alt. Well, my comfort is, though there are no services, yet there are trades
enough. Exit.


Clea. Oh my dear Erminia! here let me ever rest.


Er. And as I gladly receive you here as the long parcht up earth does longed
for showers of rain.


Cy. Think not Cleander so wholly to possess your Erminia, I shall always
claim a friends part in her.


Cle. She is all yours Madam. Embraces her. as I also, in being wholly hers.


Duk. Here then ends our jealousy, since Erminia's virtue renders me (I Am
sure) as free from suspect as Aurindo's sex does you; but why differ we longer
to celebrate these happy Nuptials that unite our States, by the Accession of
Argos to Missena, and of all Greece now makes it the happiest Land.


Clea. Mean time my dear Erminia thy name shall be so celebrous in the mouth of
Fame, that as often as 'twod praise any one; for Beauty and Virtue it shall
only say, the are like the fair and virtuous Erminia.


The Epilogue.
WE do confess your curiosities
Have purified the Stage, that otherwise
Had been all dross e're this; and nothing there
That might delight a curious Eye or Ear.
And we'ar so far from taking of it ill,
We thank you for it, pray be curious still:
So shall the Poet, and the Actors too,
In time become as curious as you.
For just as Judges by their rigidness,
Make men more careful, and offend the less:
So do you, us, in the Boxes and the Pit,
In whose verge chiefly it lies to judge of it.
Do then by this Play as you are wont to do
By others, if it be bad, condemn it too:
If good, we hope you will give some sign, that may
Declare your approbation of the Play.
FINIS.
