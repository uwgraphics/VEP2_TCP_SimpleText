Royal coat of armsBy the King.
WHereas, upon Summons from Us, diverse Gentlemen of this our County of York did
attend Us upon Thursday the twelfth of this instant May, when We declared Our
Resolution (for the Reasons then delivered by Us) to have a Guard to secure and
defend Our Person, and desired there (...) Concurrence and Assistance of the
Gentry of this County. And whereas diverse Gentlemen of this County, for many
Reasons and Occasions, could not then appear to receive Our pleasure on that
behalf, whereunto diverse have subscribed. We have therefore thought good
hereby to give notice as well to those Gentlemen who were not then present, as
to those who did then attend Us, that Our Command is, That as well those
Gentlemen who are charged with Horse, as others, appear at York upon Friday
the twentieth of this Month, in such manner and equipage as will be convenient
for the guard of our person. And we require and command, That in the interim no
other warrants, Order, or Command whatsoever shall distract or hinder this Our
service. And we further will and command, That this Our Order be forthwith
published by the Sheriff of this Our County: For which this shall be
sufficient warrant.

Given at Our Court at York, the fourteenth day of May, in the eighteenth Year
of Our Reign, 1642.
