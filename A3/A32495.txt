WHereas We by an Order in Council of the Tenth day of May One thousand six
hundred seventy two, have Dispensed for some time with certain Clauses in the
late Acts of Parliament for Encouraging and Increasing of Shipping and
Navigation, and for the Encouragement of Trade; And therein also Declared, That
when We should think fit to determine that Dispensation, We would by Our Royal
Proclamation give Six Months notice thereof, to the end no Merchant, or other
Person therein concerned should be Surprised. In order whereunto, We taking the
same into Consideration, have thought fit (with the Advice of Our Privy
Council) to Publish this Our Royal Proclamation; And do hereby Declare, That
the said Order of the Tenth of May One thousand six hundred seventy two, and
all and every the Dispensations, Clauses, Matters and Things therein contained,
shall from and after the end of Six Months next ensuing the Date of this
Proclamation, cease, determine, and be void to all intents and purposes
whatsoever: Whereof all Persons concerned are to take notice, and to conform
themselves accordingly.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Eleventh day of March 1673/4. in the Six
