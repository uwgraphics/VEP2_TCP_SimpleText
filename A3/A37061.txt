THE COPY OF A LETTER WRITTEN TO Mr. ALEXANDER HINDERSON.

LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1643.

Reverend and loving Brother in Christ;
I Hope my two former Letters were safely delivered, wherein I gave you notice
of a purpose taken in hand here, to make Notes upon the Bible; what concurrence
you think fit to give in such a work, I leave to your own piety to determine.
Now I have some other thoughts to impart unto you, which lie as a burden on my
heart; nor can I be at rest till I discharge them in some bodies bosom; nor
know I any more fit then your self, to whom I may confide them, for I trust
that you will make them harmless to me, and as profitable as you can to the
Public, according to the occasions which God at this time does put into your
hand, which may be of great consequence hereafter if rightly managed.

I am then very desirous to let you know my thoughts concerning the Palatine
Cause, which I hear is laid to heart amongst you; whereat as I am glad, so I
will not cease to pray that God would direct your hearts to do something in it
as it ought to be done. But to conceive what may be done in it, and how that
which may be done ought to be done, so as we may be sure that God will give a
blessing to it, is a thing whereof I am not a little sollicitous, since I have
heard of the inclinations both here and there, where you are tending toward
some real undertakings for his Highness: You know that the right aim in
framing of Councels, is of very great, if not of greatest importance: For it is
like the Axell tree, whereupon the means like a wheel, run about to carry
it to an Issue: If this aim be not as it should be settled in the minds of the
Undertakers for the Palatine Cause, I can have little hopes of a blessing upon
the enterprise, whatsoever it be; nor can I be persuaded, that fit means to
help the cause will be made use of: and would to God not only they that are
willing to undertake for the House Palatine; but that the House it self, and
the Counselors which are about it did not understand only, but also affect
truly the end, which they should have in prosecuting their own Cause. The
sweet natured Prince Elector is of very good capacity and judgment, and as
most young men, and of a sanguine complexion, are flexible and easily led; so
might he be brought into better apprehensions of matters, then as yet he
seems to have, if the Counselors that are about him, were so sensible of the
best things belonging to the Palatine Cause, as Men in that place should be:
but that they are not truly sensible of their true aim, it appears to me in
some things, at which I can but grieve. I speak this with due respect unto
them, and in love to the Cause, which they do manage about his Highness. And I
pray unto God heartily that in suing for the means of their Restitution, they
may walk more entirely with God, ( and in all his ways, then they have done
many of them hitherto;) that they may be fit to look up directly unto him, and
not so much unto the arm of flesh, as States men commonly do; and that they
may be able to understand the Counsel of God toward their Master, whom he has
honored to suffer hatred and persecution for his own Cause: Which cause I
fear is little regarded by most of them, and till they, as well as the Prince
himself, be truly sensible of it, I have little hope of any good issue in all
their Enterprises, which no doubt have been hitherto miscarried, for want of
Gods blessing upon the undertakings; and Gods blessing has been wanting,
because the true end, which he requires in such a cause, was not intended.
Lest therefore both they and you that are willing to undertake for them, should
make shipwreck upon the same rock, I think my self bound in conscience to
give some warning to you, which I will leave to your prudency to insinuate to
such, as can make best use thereof in time and place convenient.

Now then to let you know, what the true aim is, which should be laid to heart
in the Palatine Cause, I must tell you, what I know to be a certain truth, and
can make good, if need be, with infallible evidences, concerning the Cause of
the War in Germany. The true original of this War, is known to be the quarrel
of the Bohemians which the P. Elector took upon him. But this was not the first
original of the War, there were other foregoing plots laid against the
Freedom of the Protestant Religion, and their Liberties in Germany; and
especially against the greatness of the Palatine House, then matched with our
Kings daughter, which made that House and the Protestant State, whereof it was
the Head, so formidable unto the Pope and his Conclave, that he with the
Austrians, took up a firm resolution to ruin that House, lest by its means
Protestancy might be so upheld in Germany, as to wear out Popery. And they had
some cause to fear this, when they saw what increase Protestancy did make
daily, so long as matters were at quiet in Germany, and what a Nurse the
University of Heildelberg was unto it. This jealousy then was the true cause
of the Quarrel, which had broken forth elsewhere, if it had not been fired in
Bohemia: For at the same time at diverse other parts in the Empire, a Quarrel
was picked against the free use of the Protestant Religion, which was an
intolerable eyesore unto the Pope, and Austrian party. Thus then it is
certain, the cause in their contention originally, is the fear and hatred of
our Religion, and no doubt it was in the P. Elector Palatine a pious intention,
to uphold the Protestant Liberties in Germany, which were put at, and which
being lost, the Religion it self would suffer thereby. By this first original
of the War, we see the nature of the Cause; and from the nature of the Cause,
we must take the aim in undertaking it. For if it should be undertaken as it
ought to be, it must be undertaken sincerely for Religion, to uphold the
Protestant Cause in Germany; and then means answerable to this aim, will be
thought upon, and may be found out, if we will but consider what the Means are
by which the Enemies of the Cause have all this while prevailed against it; and
what practices they still use to undermine and overthrow it wholly. For if we
can take away the advantages, which have made them hitherto prevail, and
prevent their future designs, no doubt our undertakings will not be without
effect.

It is most certain that hitherto their greatest advantages have been herein,
that as they were always united amongst themselves, and stood close to one
main purpose, which is the propagation of their Religion; so they have been
able always hitherto by their practices and instruments to divide Protestants,
and distract their intentions, that they should never join in one purpose. Thus
in Germany all their industry have been employed still to separate the
Counsels of one State and Prince from another, which they were able to do, by
reason of their disputes and jealousies one against another about matters of
Religion; and out of Germany they have kept the thoughts and intentions of us
in Great Britain busy another way, to divert us from giving assistance unto
our afflicted brethren, or taking their case to heart, til it be almost past
remedy. For verily, the Protestant Power in Germany is even gone, and there is
none either shut up or left any more within that Country; therefore I have the
greater hope for my part, that God will now repent himself of his Servants,
because his custom of old is, as the Prophet says, Esaias 30. 17, 18. when his
people is, as the beacon on the top of a mountain, and an ensign on an hill,
therefore, and then chiefly to wait that he may be gracious unto them; and
therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon them. And this I hope
he will do in ^anctifying good instruments unto his Service, and showing the
true way which must be followed in maintaining his Cause, and preventing the
plots of his Adversaries, which they have laid for times to come: whereof the
depth I suppose is or may be fully discovered, if use can be made of that small
treasure of observations new and old, which I and some others have made, and do
make, whereof here I will give you a brief abstract.

Since the Conquest of Bohemia, and the transaction with the King of Denmark,
and a little before the arrival of the King of Sweden into Germany* their main
intentions have been discovered fully, and the ways of their plots, and the
industry which they use in the same, can easily be gathered, partly from their
own Historical relations concerning the same, and partly from their actual
proceedings in all places, uniformally upon the same grounds and principles,
which men of experience, and any thing versed in affairs, cannot but take
notice of. The sum of all is this, that since they gained so much ground
against the Protestant Cause in Germany, that they thought their hopes might be
brought to some good perfection, there they have raised upon that foundation
some further Resolutions determined in the Papal Conclave, how to deal in
time to come with all other Protestants, to bring them back again to Rome; or
else to divide them, and distract them more and more amongst themselves, so
that they shall easily become a prey to Papists, as those of Germany are
become. This Resolution is to make Propositions of Peace, and of Agreement
betwixt Protestancy and Popery. How far this plot, and by what means it was
advanced here in Great Britain, and how God has disappointed it, I need not to
relate: And by the way of carrying things here, wise men can gather what
negotiations are a foot elsewhere also, whereof I can bear some witness in
many particulars, if need were. But what danger there may be still here of
reviving their plots, and how that danger may be hereafter prevented, I will
leave to the wisdom of both States to consider, beseeching the Lord in mercy
to direct them therein to his glory. And if these notes that I am going to set
down can do any good to that effect; perhaps farther particulars, if they be
required, may be in this kind made known. It is certain then that in Germany,
in France, in Polonia, in the Low Countries, and elsewhere, the same mystery of
iniquity is a foot, and with much industry and diligence advanced by Emissaries
of all sorts toward Princes, Statesmen, and leading Divines. I will not here
name those that are known unto me in all these parts, nor how far things, and
by what ways in several parts they are diversely carried on to the same scope,
because that is needless at this time, a general intimation in one or two
will suffice. It is manifestly known, what the Cardinal in France has now
this good many years been fomenting by Monsieur de la Melitiere, and some
others, concerning a transaction of differences between Papists and
Protestants; and now of late it breaks forth more then ever, by that which is
done at Grenoble, and some other parts in France, where some chief Papists
have made overtures unto Protestants toward some agreement, upon plausible
general Conditions, because they seem to be willing to yield unto Protestants
in some things of no small moment, and chiefly because they absolve them from
the crimes of heresy laid to their charge ordinarily by other Papists. I am
also credibly now of late informed from a very good hand, That the Cardinal
has written to the States of Holland, in the name of his King, to make an
overture of such a transaction; and I am in no doubt but it may be so, for
other circumstances which I know; and you may conjecture that the Cardinal
would not lightly venture upon such a Proposition without some preparatives,
and hopes to effect something, etc. I know he may have some private ends in
reconciling Protestants with Papists in France; I know he is an enemy to the
House of Austria, and that he seems now to jarre with the Pope, for the
maintaining of the Privileges of the King over the Ecclesiastic Persons in
France; but all this does not hinder any whit his concurrence in the maine plot
of the Conclave; but rather to emulate the forwardness of Austria, and not to
be behind in the Counsels of furthering the plot of Religion unto any: he does
all this in subordination unto the Resolution of the Conclave, which of late
has fully been discovered to be this, toward Germany and Polonia chiefly, and
consequently toward all other Protestant Churches in due time. The resolution
I say has been discovered by the negotiation of one Valerius Magnus, a Friar
sent forth and appointed by the Conclave, to go through Germany, and Polonia
to discover, and learn what the most common and important grievances are, which
give greatest discontent unto all Protestants there, against Popery; that when
they shall be truly and distinctly known, a course may be resolved upon, how to
yield unto some kind of Reformation thereof, Salvo jure and honor Pontificio,
by some general Council, which the Emperor should call, with the consent of
the Princes of Europe; that so the common sort might receive satisfaction. This
Friar is now at this instant still in his negotiation, supported to that
effect, with means and assistants for correspondency, by the Emperor, and the
King of Polonia: The discovery of this plot is come to my knowledge of late,
and he was moved by a Providence of God himself, to lay it open to one, with
whom I have been heretofore acquainted, who in a Conference about the grounds
of our Religion, did so fully in the presence of others convict him, and
stopped his mouth, that he became troubled in conscience, and did not rest till
he had dealt more privately with the Divine who had overcome him, to whom he in
testimony of his sincerity revealed his whole plot; and by the procuration and
intervention of great men and friends, has moved the foresaid Divine to go
along with him into Polonia, and to Vienna, and as far as Rome, to see what
can be effected in this Negotiation, and further this pretended transaction.
Much more could be related of this subject, but this is enough to make their
intention fully known, which no doubt is this, to make a general kind of
politic transaction of differences in Religion, by the power of Civil
authority, with so many Protestant Princes as can privately or publicly be
gained thereunto, that if others who will not condescend to such an agreement,
be moved for conscience sake to bear witness against it, they may be crushed
by Authority, and suppressed; and when the sounder part of Protestants shall be
thus taken out of the way, and not able to peep, then his authority may be
fully established over those that shall reunite unto him without contradiction.

Thus the Pope dealt at first with the Hussites in Bohemia, for after a long
War, wherein the Bohemians had wearied all their Neighbors, he saw that by
violence they could not be brought to a constant and voluntary yielding unto
him, therefore he proposed Conditions of agreements unto the greatest part of
them, which was less sound, by yielding unto them four or five Articles for
the redress of some grievances; and when the sounder part would not acquiesce,
they were quite oppressed and dissipated; nor did they ever, after that
Thabours was once taken, recover strength or become considerable till the days
of Luther, and these later times, wherein again they were the first sufferers.
The same purpose is now manifestly in hand to deal with all Protestant
Churches, but chiefly with those in Germany in like manner; that if the
Austrio-Bavarian faction in Germany can either by fair or foul means bring
any considerable party of the Protestant Church any where, but chiefly within
Germany it self, to yield unto the plausible Conditions which may be proposed
for the redress of common grievances, then they have fully obtained their
purpose, and will not fail to deal there so with the remnant of Protestants, as
was done with the remnant of Hussites in Bohemia. And what course the Emperor
takes in Germany, the same will be followed in Polonia and in France; so that
except God disappoint this plot by a wonderful providence, as he used to work
in all his ways, there is no possibility in humane appearance, and by humane
ways to avoid the effect of it, which will be the setting up again of popery
in all places where once it has had footing.

Thus you see what advantages the Adversaries of the Palatine Cause have had
hitherto against it, and what their plot and practice is to bring their
Enterprise to perfection. I know that God uses to laugh the wisdom of this
world to scorn, and takes the crafty in their own devises, and that as
heretofore always from the beginning of Christianity, and now of late also in
the discovery of Antichristianity, he has had the better of his Adversaries,
even there and then, where and when they thought themselves to be strongest. So
he will still to the end be at last victorious in his own Cause yet, although
I know I am confidently persuaded that God will do so, yet I say we ought not
to be negligent in doing our duty: but taking the most likely course, we ought
according to our ability help him against the mighty, leaving the events of our
endeavors to his providence. Who knows but that the time may be now come,
wherein the Lord will rise and work for his own names sake? nor is it unlikely
to be so, if we consider the accomplishment of prophesies, and particularly
that of Dan. 12. 7. that when the adversary shall have accomplished to scatter
the power of the holy people, that then their sufferings shall be at an end:
now verily their power is wholly scattered and divided, and there is no
considerable force either in or out of Germany, that is able to rise up for
Protestancy against Papacy; and therefore I hope it is Gods time to work now
in his own way, and not according to humane appearance? And this very
consideration makes me the more earnest toward you that seem willing to take
his Cause in hand: lest in going about it his way should not be followed,
without which nothing can prosper in the Palatine affairs. Now I conceive his
way to be not a way of great strength and force, but a way of spiritual
Wisdom and integrity, tending to advance the Kingdom of his Son, in managing
the controvers^y of his Church. If then all the outward undertakings whatsoever
they may be, go not along with God in his way, and are not made subordinate
unto this end; they will be in vain and prove but a further scattering of the
forces of Protestancy. And how they may be set in this way, in opposition to
the way of those that fight against Protestantcy, more by craft then by
strength, I will tell you my opinion, that you may judge of it, and submit it
as you shall think fit to be judged of by others, that are wellwillers to the
Cause; It is then briefly this.

First, I think it necessary that both his Majesty and the Prince Elector be
made sensible of the dangerous consequence of the Papal plot against
Protestancy.

Then the Prince Elector should be dealt withal seriously by some grave, wise
and godly man, to make him lay to heart the great honor that God does to him
and to his Family in calling him to suffer for his Cause, and to bear the
reproaches of them that reproach the truth of Christianity, and the hatred of
those that hate the Gospel of Christ, which they persecute in his person. To
know truly what an honor this is, would be a great strengthening of his
spirit; and then to know also how he ought to behave himself in all his ways
toward God in bearing up this Cause, how that he ought not to seek himself
in it, but should make the upholding of Protestancy, and not the regaining of
his Lands and Titles, his true inward aim, and consequently to do all in
subordination to God, and not by humane wisdom and policy, etc. If this could
be truly (as I am persuaded he is very capable of) wrought upon him, then I
would not despair of a blessing upon that which he may take in hand; He being
thus wrought upon to make God his counsel and strength in all things to manage
faithfully his Cause; could have some other Counselors adjoined to him,
besides those which he now has: Men of exemplary and entire lives, men that
should strengthen him in the true aim of his Cause, to keep it unmovable in
his heart; men that are versed in public Treaties about the cause, and
experienced in State affairs, chiefly in the Germane Princes Courts; such a
one is N. N. without whose judgment and experience, I conceive his business
can hardly be well contrived in respect of Germany, and I could wish that he
were maintained to be perpetually about him, for he is a very religious and
knowing man, and of singular use in this work, for the contrivance of the
counsels thereof toward foreign States; and besides him, one or two States men
more could be named. But I leave this and will come to the undertaking of the
Work; not of the outward military supply which may be sent for him, but of the
spiritual part of the work which should tend to uphold Protestancy against
Popery, not only in Germany, but every where else: I conceive then that such
as undertake to restore the House Palatine in Germany, should make the quarrel
not in pretense, but in truth (as indeed it is) a matter of Religion, and so
should resolve to handle the Cause in a religious way, as well as by force. The
cause then of maintaining the Religion and Liberties of Protestants in Germany,
ought to be made a public business; and in all Treaties with foreign
States, and deliberations about foreign Affairs, it ought to come into
consideration; and all Ambassadors toward other Protestants, should be
instructed to deal with them for a concurrence in it, and in effect become
like unto the advice of Cato for the destroying of Carthage, an appendix to
every counsel given in the Senate.

If the Cause of Religion should be made a public business, then public
ways and means must be used to advance Protestancy, so as a matter of
Religion ought to be advanced, that is, without partiality and by respects or
private ends and affections, by taking Protestancy in the true notion thereof,
as it stands in its principles opposite to Popery, and to advance it thus
taken; two kinds of means should be set aworke, the one should serve to make
known unto the world what true Protestancy is, the other should serve to
oppose the ways of Popery, in undermining it; I will name only the heads of
these means as now they lie in my conception; To make true Protestancy known
unto the world, thoughts must be had, how to make the tenor of their Common
Faith, and the Rules of their practice in their public and private profession
of the Gospel, better evident unto the world then hitherto they have been.

For the tenor of their common Faith, it may be evident two ways; First, if
the harmony of Confessions be reprinted (for it is wholly out of print) and in
some things enlarged and completed. Secondly, if a course could be taken to
make Scripturall knowledge more common to all in the plain and evident truths
thereof, and less entangled in disputes, and subject to various
interpretations amongst the learned. The first may be done by using means to
make the literal sense of the Text and the clear doctrins thereof, plain for
the vulgar use, and fit for the ordinary reading of all men, by the printing of
Bibles with Notes, and brief Explications, wherein all Protestants should
agree and consent of the meaning of the Text. The second may be done by some
common Rules and Methods of Interpretation of places doubtful, whereupon the
godly learned could be moved to agree amongst themselves, that by common
principles in the Analogy of Faith, and by a way of Analyzing the Text, and
drawing consequences therefrom (which should be agreed upon by common consent
of the Learned) they might be able to avoid private interpretations and
disputable doubts in Doctrine, which obscure much the faith, and trouble the
weak professors, and keep off doubting Papists from being fully convicted.

This would be a Means if it could be had, to enlarge very much the knowledge
of the Truth, and to confirm it without danger of divisions; it would also be a
ground of reconciling different opinions, without all danger of betraying
Truth, or suppressing it, which is a thing so much feared in the work of peace
Ecclesiastical. Concerning the rules of Protestants common practice, in their
public and private walking according to the Gospel, they ought to be set
forth as much to advance themselves in the Reformation of their religious
walking, as to vindicate the credit of their profession against malicious
aspersions. Here then Means should be thought upon, how the Rules of their
Public Worship, in their Ecclesiastical meetings, to hear the Word, to put
forth prayers and praises to God, and to partake of the holy Sacraments one
with another, should be framed so as to take away the offenses which arise
amongst themselves by reason of diversity in these practices, and by conforming
their actions herein unto that which is expressed and prescribed in the Word,
that they may show themselves true unto their own principles, wherein they
maintain against Popery, that Gods Worship should be truly spiritual according
to his will, and not clogged and mixed with humane inventions. And to bring
this to pass, all their Ecclesiastical Constitutions should be compared one
with another, and their fundamental agreement amongst themselves, and with the
express Rules in the Word, should be taken and distinguished from the
Circumstantiall matters, wherein the free and indifferent custom of Nations,
not unlawful to be used, make them differ one from another. This their
agreement in substantial, and difference in diaphorall practices, wherein
every Church has its own liberty, might be published, as the Harmony of Rules
in public Worship observed by Protestants in conformity to Gods Ordinances,
and what is overplus as a clogge and mixture of humane institution in some
Churches, means should be thought upon how that might by little and little, be
antiquated and left off. And to effect this, if some public Treaties, and
Synodicall meeting could be brought about in due time amongst them, it would be
a great settlement unto themselves in the ways of Truth, and a special means
to propagate it unto others.

As for the rules of their private walking, they should be set forth and
described, in respect of common Family duties, and in respect of the several
Callings and Charges belonging to all these, that are Members of the Church and
Commonwealth. Here then should be a substantial description of the right
ordering of Christian Families, to make it apparent how Protestants, some do
study, and all should study to walk before God in their private household
societies. And in like manner other material descriptions of the several
duties of Ecclesiastical and Civil charges, how they are, or ought to be
discharged conscionably in the presence of God, should be put forth, to inform
all of the integrity of their ways and intentions. Here then the duties
belonging to the Pastoral Charge, and to the Doctorall Charge, and to the
Helpets in the one and other Charge, such as are Elders and Deacons in the
Church; and Schoolmasters for the education of youths, should be laid open.
Also the Charge of the Magistrate as he is Governor and Judge of the people;
and the duty of the Subject as he is under Superior powers; The Charge of a
Husband and Wife; The Charge of Parents and Children, and of Masters and
Servants, should all be distinctly described and published in several brief
Treaties, and made common to all, that both Protestants might see what they
should do according to their own principles of profession, and others might be
informed of their walking, who traduce them for licenciousnesse, and blame
their Religion, as if it were the high way to dissolve all Government, and to
cast men loose unto all manner of rebellion and dissolution.

Such Treaties as these being briefly yet fully and substantially penned, and
then revised and approved by some Synods and Universities, would be of great
use to make all Protestants be of one mind in their profession of Christianity
before the world, and free them from many odious impressions which evil
Statists and Emissaries of the Pope beget in the minds of Princes against them,
whereby more hurt is done then we are aware of. Therefore to elaborate these
tasks, Men should be set apart, and being fitted for the common use of all men,
they should be printed and dispersed in several Languages to be seen by all,
and the Charges of Translation and Printing should be born by those that
undertake the Palatine Cause; and his Counselors for the good of this Cause,
should set their minds awork how to bring these things to pass. For herein
does their strength consist, against which all the power and plots of the
Enemies of Protestancy will never be able to prevail. For suppose they should
effect what they intend, in calling a Council in Germany by the Emperors
authority, to rectify some general grievances; if Protestants have these
Declarations and evidences to make the tenor of their common Faith and Practice
appear in a readiness, to offer it to be judged by that Council, what will
their plot be able to effect? Will they not be taken in their own device, and
made instruments of confirming that Profession which they intend to overthrow?
I know not what you will think of the possibility to effect all this, but I am
sure you cannot deny but that all this may be done, and that without great
difficulty, or great delay, if the Protestant Cause were taken to heart as it
ought to be; and if some few Instruments were set apart to elaborate such tasks
as these. But alas these things are not at all minded nor can they gain any
favor or countenance at any bodies hand, who is in place of Eminency, except
they can make a particular use of the undertaking to subordinate the same unto
some private aims of their own. Hence it is that the solicitors of such Works
are looked upon aloof, and suspected as dangerous Men by all sides, or laughed at
in secret as men of odd and singular conceits, that fancy unto themselves
Castles in the air, and impossible undertakings. Verily I confess the
undertakings are impossible, not per se, but per accidens, by reason of the
stupidity of men's spirits in matters of a public nature, and by reason of
their great partiality which does blind them in all other things, not serving
to their private ends and ways. Nor do most men that I meet withal, mind any
thing but what is immediately of use for their own present turns; and because
my thoughts cannot run that way, I am become like a sparrow on the house top,
and as an Owl among the rest of the Birds of the Forest. For all this while I
have been knocking at a deaf man's door, intending to put men in mind of these
things, and seeking help to bring them to pass, I have spent my time and
strength in vain. Now then I have discharged my conscience, and will set my
mind at rest from henceforth; and this I count to be the fruit of my labors.
This is the first kind of means serving to establish, to perfect, and to make
known what true Protestancy is in the world.

The second kind of Means does serve to oppose Popery in that wherein it does
study to divide and undermine the State of Protestants. To this effect Means
should be thought upon, how to go cross unto them in their proceedings against
us. They labor and plot how to divide us amongst our selves, and to feed our
disputes in Religion and jealousies of States, and to bring every where some
evil intelligence betwixt Rulers and Subjects, and to make us of Great Britain
to neglect all the thoughts of our Brethren which may tend to their comfort:
should not we then labor and plot to bring the quite contrary effects to
pass, namely, how to reconcile matters of disputes in Religion, and to take
away jealousies of States, and to bring good intelligences betwixt Rulers and
Subjects and to make us here in Great Britain to think upon the State of our
Brethren who suffer in, and for the same Faith which we profess? They have a
Synagogue of Satan to tempt the Protestants to defection, from whence they send
forth swarms of Emissaries, as they call it, ad propagandam fidem; but it is to
creep into all Courts and Families to corrupt men's minds, and to execute all
mischievous designs against us; and we are so dull as to intend nothing, either
for our own preservation or against them. Nor is the way thought upon, or
inquired after, how that any such purpose might be effected. This then the
undertakers of the Palatine Cause should lay to heart, and seriously mind as a
Fundamental Maxim of their State: That the Causes of divisions amongst
Protestant Churches and States must be remedied by some effectual Negotiation,
whereof the preparatives being already made to their hand, rather by a
Providence of God, then by any man's instigation and encouragement, they will be
the less excusable if they make not use of the same by taking notice of the
Means which may be showed unto them, whereof I will not now speak at large,
only in a word let me refer you unto the summary discourse concerning the work
of Peace Ecclesiastical, how it may concur with the aim of a Civil
Confederation among Protestants, which is in print, and was sent unto you 6 or
7 weeks ago. But if no such public Negotiation can be as yet intended, then a
more private, and yet no less effectual way might be used, by setting afoot a
Theological Correspondency with Divines already engaged in the Work of
Reconcilement. The manner and Method of entertaining this Correspondency, and
the Usefulness of it might easily be showed, if there were any hope or
appearance of obtaining any countenance, Patronage, or maintenance in
undergoing it; for much must be done in it by printed Letters and Tracts, which
should at once be made to fly abroad to all places convenient, and yet not
become common to every one promiscuously till matters should be sufficiently
ripened in the minds of Leading men on all sides, who in due time should be
able to sway others unto good Resolutions: And although in this public Cause
of maintaining Protestancy, nothing else should be done, but to keep afoot the
Correspondency which is begun already, that the thoughts of those that are
everywhere raised, and set upon these Consultations, may be more and more
confirmed and ripened; yet this alone if it be effectually prosecuted may be
able by the grace of God to countermine the Papal plot heretofore mentioned:
Therefore whatsoever else may be intended, if my counsel may be heard, I would
not have this omitted nor delayed, but His Majesty should be moved to settle
some donatives, and set them apart to maintain the Charges of this
correspondency. Many things of this nature will be in his Majesty's disposing,
if those that are found guilty be punished and deprived of the gifts and
privileges which they enjoyed without doing service to the public therein.

Thus you see my desire, and the care that does trouble my mind about this
business. Having thus discharged the burden of my thoughts upon your wisdom
and discretion; I find my spirit at rest, because I make no doubt but God will
address you to make some use of them, where they may be most profitable to the
good of the cause of Religion; and I shall not fail to join my daily prayers
with you and your endeavors, that they may not be unfruitful in this matter.
Thus I commend you to the Grace of God, and rest,

Your faithful friend and servant in Christ.
London, October. 4. Anno 1641.
FINIS.
