SIR,
WE should do our Army a great deal of wrong, and not discharge our duty of
thanfulnesse toward God, if we took not the first occasion to declare his
goodness, in giving so great a blessing as he has now done to the resolute
and unwearyed endeavors of our Soldiers, fighting for him in the maintenance
of his truth, and for themselves and their Country, in defense of their
Liberties, and the Privileges of Parliament. This makes us give you now a
Naration of a blessed Victory which God has given us upon the Army of the
Cavaleers, and of those evil persons, who upon Sunday the 23 of this instant,
engaged His Majesty in a dangerous and bloody fight against His faithful
Subjects, in the Army raised by Authority of Parliament, for the preservation
of His Crown and Kingdom; We marched from Worster, Wensday the 19, upon
intelligence that their Army was moved from Shrewsbury, and Bridgenorth, and
bending Southward, our Train of Artillery was so unready, through want of
Draught Horses, and through other omissions of Monster du Boys, that we were
forced to leave it beinde to follow us, and with it the regiments of Colonel
Hambden, and Colonel Grantham; and staying for it, we could advance no
further then to a little Market-towne called Kyneton in Warwick shire, six
miles from Warwick, whether we came the Saturday night with 11. regiments of
Foot, 42 Troops of Horse, and about 700. Dragoons, in all about ten thousand
men; there we intended to rail the Sabbath Day, and the rather that our
A^tillery, and the Forces lest with it, might come up to us. In the morning
when we were going to Church, we had News brought us, that the Enemy was two
miles from us, upon a high Hill, called Edgehill: Whereupon we presently
marched forth into a great broad field under that Hill, called the vale of the
red Horse, and made a stand some half a mile from the foot of the Hill, and
there drew into Battalio, where we saw their Forces come down the Hill, and
draw likewise into Battle in the bottom, a great broad company: Their Forces
appeared to be much greater then we could possibly have conceived them to be;
by the confession of the prisoners we have taken, they that say least, say
Fourteen thousand, which is the Earl of Linsey's relation, who was their
General; but others say, eighteen thousand, and above 4000 Horse and
Dragoons: the wind was much for their advantage, and they endeavored to get
it more, which to prevent, we were enforced to draw out our left Wing to a
great breadth, and by that means, before the Battle was done, Those two
Regiments were led on by Sir John Meldrum, and were of his Brigado.
gained it wholly from them: In our right wing were three regiments of Horse,
the Lord Generals commanded by Sir Philip Stapleton, Sir William Batfores, and
the Lord Fieldings, Sir John Meldrums Brigado had the Van, Colonel Pssex was
in the middle, and Colonel Ballards with the Lord Generals regiment, his own,
the Lord Brooks, and Colonel Hollis in the rear: In the left Wing were 24
troops of Horse, commanded by Sir James Ramsey, their Commissary General. In
this posture we stood, when the other Army advanced toward us, the strength of
their Horse were on their right Wing opposite to our left; In their left Wing
they had but ten troops, but their Foot which appeared to us, divided into
nine great bodies, came up all in Front, and after some playing with the Canon
on both sides, that part of it which was on their left, and toward our right
Wing, came on very gallantly to the Charge, and were as gallantly received, and
charged by Sir Phillip Stapletons and Sir William Balfores Regiments of Horse,
assisted with the Lord Roberts and Sir William Constables Regiments of Foot,
who did it so home thrice together, that they forced all the Musketeers of two
of their best Regiments to run in and shroud themselves within their Pikes,
not daring to shoot a shoot, and so stood: When our rear came up, and then
charging all together, especially that part of our rear which was placed upon
the right hand, and so next unto them, which was the Lord Generals Regiment,
and the Lord Brooks, led on by Colonel Ballard who commanded that Brigado,
forced that stand of Pikes, and wholly broke those two Regiments, and slew and
took almost every man of them: The Earl of Linsey, his Son the Lord Willoughby,
and some other persons of note are prisoners, Sir Edmund Vurney, who carried
the Kings Standard, was sl^in by a Gentleman of the Lord Generals Troop of
Horse, who did much other good service that day, and the Standard taken, which
was afterward by the Lord General himself delivered unto his Secretary Mr.
Chambers, with an intention to send it back the next day unto His Majesty, but
the Secretary after he had carried it long in his hand, suffered it to be taken
away by some of our Troopers, and as yet we cannot learn where it is: The other
two Regiments of our Rear, Colonel Hollis, and Colonel Ballard, charged those
which were before them and then the whole body of the Kings Foot, except two
other Regiments, ran away: by this time it grew so late and dark, and to say
the truth, our Ammunition at this present was all spent, that we contented our
selves to make good the field, and gave them leave to retire up the Hill in the
night: But before we come to this, we will give you an account of what passed in
the other parts of our Army, before our Rear came up to charge. Our battle at
the very first wholly disbanded and ran away, without ever striking stroke, or
so much as being charged by the enemy, though Colonel Essex himself, and
others that commanded those Regiments, in chief, did as much as men could do to
stay them; but Colonel Essex being forsaken by his whole Brigado, went
himself into the Van, where both by direction, and his own execution he did
most gallant service, till he received a shot in the thigh, of which he is
since dead: Now for our Rear, thus it was; before it toward the outside of it
stood our left Wing of Horse, advanced a little forward to the top of a hill,
where they stood in a Battalio lined with commanded Musketeers, 400 out of
Colonel Hollis Regiment, and 200. out of Colonel Ballards; but upon the first
charge of the Enemy they wheeled about, abandoned their Musketeers and came
running down with the Enemies Horse at their heels, and amongst them pell
mell, just upon Colonel Hollis his Regiment, and brake through it, though
Colonel Hollis himself, when he saw them come running toward him, went and
planted himself just in the way, and did what possibly he could do to make them
stand, and at last prevailed with three Troops to wheel a little about and
tally; but the rest of our horse of that Wing, and the Enemies horse with them,
brake thorough, and ran to Kineton, where most of the Enemy left pursuing them,
and fell to plundering of our Wagons, by which many of us have received very
great loss, and by name, your servants that now write to you: Notwithstanding
their breaking thorough Col. Hollis his Regiment, it was not dismayed, but
together with the other regiments of that Brigado marched up the hill, and so
made all the haste they could to come to fight, and got the wind of the enemy,
and came on (if we may say it our selves, but we must do the soldiers right)
most gallantly, and charged the Enemy, who were then in fight with our Van, and
the right Wing of our horse, and as it was said before, helped to defeat the two
regiments forementioned, and made all the rest run, but two other regiments
which retired orderly, and at last made a stand, and having the assistance of
Canon, and a ditch before them held us play very handsomely: And by this time it
grew so dark, and our Powder and Bullet so spent, that it was not held fit we
should advance upon them; but there we stood in very good order, drew up all
our forces both horse and foor, and so stood all the night upon that place
where the enemy before the fight had drawn into Battalio, till toward morning
that the Enemy was gone, and retired up the hill: And then we returned also to
a warmer place near Kineton, where we had quartered the night before, for we
were almost starved with cold in that bitter night, our Army being in extreme
want of Victuals: And about nine or ten of the clock drew out again into
Bat^al^^ and so stood three or four hours, till the Enemy was clean gone
from the hill, and then we drew again into our quarter and there have lain
this night, and purpose this day, God will ling, after we have buried our dead,
to march to Warwick to re^resh our Army, which is exceedingly wearied with so
many rights watching, and so long a fight which (...) from noon till dark
night: two particulars must not be omitted, one of Sir William Balfore, who in
the beginning of the day broke a regiment of Foot which had green Colors,
beat them to their C^non, where they threw down their Arms and ran away, he
laid his hand upon the Cano^, and called for na^ to (...) them up, especially
the two biggest which were Demy-Canon but finding none, he cut the topes
belonging to them, and his Troops killed the Canoneers: Then he porsued the
flyers half a mile upon execution, and after returned to Sir Philip Stapleton,
who in the mean time was charging of the red Regiment, where the Kings
Standard was, and had charged it home to push of Pike with his single troop;
and they then, together with the help of some of the Foot of our rear,
utterly broke it, as you had it before: The other particular was of Sir Philip
Staplton, who, when five troops of the Enemi^s Horse returned from pursuit of
our left Wing, and from plundering some of our Wagons, and passed by the
outside of our rear upon the left hand, went and charged them with his troop
and made then run: but they finding a gap in the hedge, got away, and returned
to the rest on their broken troops, where they raflyed and made up a kind of
body again. It we had thee we could relate unto you many more observable
passages, but what you have here s^all serve you till we mee^^. This only will
we say, some of both ^s did extr^amly well, and other did as ill, and deserve
to be hanged for deserting and betraying as much as lay in them their party,
but God alone is to be praised who fought with us, and for us, and made it his
own work, to give the victory unto his servants: We have lost of note, only
Colonel Essex, and we fear the Lord Saint John who was dangerously wounded;
We here send you a George, found in the field by a common Soldier, and bought
of him for twenty shilings by one Captain Skinner; We have promised him he
shall have it again; we only send it you as one of our trophes that you may
see it: we believe you will hear of very many of great quality sl^ine on the
other side; The King Foo^e are either slain, or most of them run away, and are
now very weak, and should have been pursued by us, but that we must of pure
necessity refresh our men for three or four days, and then we shall, God
willing address our selves to finish the work. In the mean time it is very
requisite, Letters from the Committee should be writ into the Countries, which
are Southern, to stir them up that they may rise and cut them off, or assist us
at least against them; which hoping you will forthwith do, We rest

Your faithful and humble Servants, Denzell Hollis. Ph. Stapleton. Tho.
Ballerd. William Balfore, Io. Meldrum. Charles Pym.

Our Lord General went last night to Warwick, and is there very well, and had
he been with us, we should not have presumed to have given you the first
Advertisement. His Excellency did gallantly adventure himself that day in the
Front, against the enemy, exposing himself to more danger then we could have
wished.



FINIS.
