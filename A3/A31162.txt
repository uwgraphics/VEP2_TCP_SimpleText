(...) CASE OF the Hudsons-Bay-Company.
THE Kings of England, by Right of Discovery, and premier Occupancy, for above
100 Years since, have the sole Rightful Title and Sovereignty of all the Seas,
Lakes, Bays, Rivers, Creeks, etc. as well as the Countries, Confines and
Territories within the Entrance of the Straits of Hudson; and that the same was
never Navigated but by English Ships and English Subjects, till the late
Encroachments of the French, many Years since the Incorporation of this Company.

Though the Navigation was discovered so long since, yet no Trade was
Established with the Native Indians till about Twenty Years past, when several
Persons of Quality, and others, having made some private Voyages, and finding
that a considerable Trade for Beavor, and other Furrs, might be settled with the
Savage Indians, His late Majesty King CHARLES the Second, was pleased by His
Letters Patents bearing date the Second of May, 1670. to Incorporate the
Adventurers; and in pursuance of the aforesaid Inherent Right in the Crown of
England, did by His Royal Charter make a Free Grant to his Highness Prince
Rupert, Christopher Duke of Albemarle, William Earl of Craven, and others His
Subjects and their Successors for ever, of all those Seas, Straits, Bays,
Rivers, Lakes and Creeks in whatsoever Latitude, from the Entrance of the
Straits, commonly called Hudsons Straits; together with all the Lands and
Territories upon the Countries, Coasts and Confines, and that the same should
be reckoned and reputed as one of His Majesty's Plantations and Colonies in
America, by the Name of Ruperts Land. And did further Make and Constitute the
said Company and their Successors, the True and Absolute Lords and Proprietors
thereof, to hold in free and common Soccage, as of His Manor of East-Greenwich
in Kent, reserving an Acknowledgment or Rent for the same to His Majesty, His
Heirs and Successors; and Granting to the said Company the sole Trade thereof
with Prohibition to all others from Trading within their Limits, without their
License, upon Forfeiture of Ship and Goods so offending, which has also by
Proclamation been published and made known: By which Inherent Right of Dominion
and Propriety in His Majesty to the Country and Places, it is humbly conceived
His Majesty's said Grant does extremely differ from His Charters to the
East-India-Company, or the African-Company.

The said Company since their Incorporation have Erected Forts, Settled several
Factories, Built Ships, Employed many Seamen, and considerably Exported the
Manufacturies of this Nation; and in the course of their Trade for so many
Years, have not only actually lost Thirteen Ships, but been at above Two
Hundred Thousand Pounds Charge: Which makes it evident that nothing but a
Company and a Joint Stock could have laid the Foundation of so considerable a
Trade amongst Infidels, and have been able to support so great a Charge, and so
many incident Losses which naturally attend that Voyage.

In particular, this Company has suffered more by the French than any Company
in England, the French having even in time of Peace committed many Outrages
against them, taken their Ships at Sea, Invaded their Factories by I and,
Robbed them of their Goods, Burnt their Houses, Murdered several of Their
Majesty's Subjects, and carried others Prisoners to Quebeck: That the French
have had the Insolence not only to justify those their unjust Invasions, but
(according to the Method of that Nation to Encroach upon all the World) have
pretended a Right to Hudsons-Bay, and by a strange Confidence against all
English Discoveries of almost Two Hundred Years since, and all Maps that ever
were extant, to make it a Dependence upon Canada, and to give out that in a
short time they would not only have that, but New York and New England too: But
this Company will undertake to make out, That the Crown of France has no Right
to Canada it self, but that it, and some other Territories, were not only many
Years in the English Possession, but that it is unjustly detained by the
French, upon pretext of Terms and Conditions (according to the Faith of that
Nation) never performed to this Day.

Some particular Men of our own Nation also, who have disturbed this Company in
their Trade, and disputed the Powers of their Grant and Charter, have never
attained any Benefit to themselves, but either given Advantage to the French,
or perished in the Voyage, which is extreme hazardous through the Mountains of
Ice which must be passed; as about Eighteen Months since the Companies Ships
sailing in Hudsons-Bay, met an English Ship Interloping there, and in distress
in the Ice just ready to sink, the Companies Ship seasonably (by GOD's
Providence) saved all the Men's Lives, and the Ship sunk immediately. Nor is the
Beavor Trade to be Maintained or improved by a single or sudden Voyage of any
Undertaker, but by the public Charge of Fortified Forts and Established
Factories to abide there, with a constant Correspondency with the Indians, that
they may be assured where settled Factories are, to resort to at the time of
Year, to Trade with for their Beavor.

All which Extraordinary Losses sustained from the French, and incurred by the
Natural Hazard of the Voyage to and from such a Climate, is the more largely
insisted upon, to Demonstrate that this Trade (which Twenty Years ago was not
one Penny Benefit to this Kingdom, and is now above Twenty Thousand Pounds per
Annum Advantage) could never have been well begun, nor effectually prosecuted,
but by a Company in a Joint Stock; and all the Undertakings by single Persons,
(who would have regarded their several and distinct Interests) must have been
rendered fruitless, through the many Disasters and Losses which would have
befallen most of them, if not all, it being impracticable to raise any
considerable Trade in a remote Country, amongst Savage Indians, without Forts
and Factories erected and settled amongst them, and furnished with store of all
Trading Goods for their constant supply; and more especially against those
Potent Rivals the French, who manage that particular Trade of Beavor under the
Counsels of the Jesuits, to whom it is Granted by the French King.

All which is humbly submitted to this Honorable House.
