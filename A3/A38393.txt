A brief Account of Merchantable Goods, and in what manner they are sold in
Tale, etc.
ONe Hundred and Twenty Else of Canvas cloth are accounted to the hundred. Of
Fustian, 14 Else is a chief; but of fine Linen and Silk 10 Else make a chief.
Of Fish: As Haberdine, Ling and Cod-fish, 124 go to the hundred; Eels 25 to the
strike, and 10 strikes to the blind; Herring and Stock Fish 120 to the hundred,
1200 make a Barrel, and 12 Barrels a Last. Laths have but five score to the
hundred of 5 foot long, but those of 4 foot long are six score; their breadth
to be one Inch and a half, and half an Inch thick. Nails and Deals are six
score to the hundred. A Dicker, Hides or Skins of Leather is 10. A Load of
Timber 50 solid foot. A Chaldr. of Coals, 36 bushels. A Gross of any thing 12
dozen. A Wey of Cheese 256 lb. A Roll of Vellum or Parchment 60 Skins. A Bale

This is the surest way of drawing up Bills of Parcels: As for the words Gross
and Tare, the first is the Goods weighed in Casks, Boxes, Chests, Bags, etc.
and the latter, the weight of them that are to be deducted; Tret is 4 pound in
the hundred given by the Seller, allowable by the custom of London to a
Freeman, unless the Bargain be made to allow none.

Hard Words in the Almanac explained; viz.
Meteorology, a Discourse of Meteors; Comet, a Blazing Star; Epact, a certain
number of days wherein the Suns Progress exceeds the Moons Embolism, the day
cast in that makes Leap-Year; Golden Number, from Letters of Gold it was writ
in at the Moons Change, and returning in 19 years to the same day of the year;
Of the Suns Solstice is when the Sun is at the highest and lowest in the Signs
of Cancer and Capricorn; Julian Account ordered by Julius Caesar; Gregorian by
Pope Gregory; the latter ten days before the former: Some will have Julian the
Apostate, the Author or Director of the Julian Calender.

Consider Interest at 6 per Cent. and observe how the Figures are marked in the
Margin, as to Shillings, Pounds, Tens of Pounds, against the Months. etc. and
thus you will find one Months Interest come to 1 d. a Month, and some li^^le
matter more; so small as to be divided 3 months to 3 d. 2 d. ^ months to 7 d. 9
to 10 d. 1 q. and a very small matter more, 12 to 1 s. 2 d. and by this

The Explanation of the foregoing Table.
NOte, That the Hundred here meant is to contain 112 pound; then further
observe, that if you buy Goods 1 q. the pound, it comes to 2 s. 4 d. the
Hundred, as in the tops of the first and second Column; if at 1 d. then 9 s. 4
d. and so of the rest, being already cast up. Now to know what you gain by the
pound or in the hundred rather: Suppose you buy Goods at 4 l. 1 s. 4 d. per
Cent. and retail them at 10 d. the pound, it comes to 4 l. 13 s. and 4 d. so
that setting aside the first price, you will find your self 11 s. 8 d. gainer;
and so you may readily perceive any other sum.

The foregoing Table is very requisite readily to know the exact price of a
Quarter of a Yard, a Quarter of a Hundred or a Pound, when the Goods are bought
by the Hundred and Yard; showing moreover the price of a Nail of a Yard, or an
Ounce, when the Commodity is bought by the Yard or Pound.

As thus in Example.

Suppose a Yard comes to 3 s. What is allowed for a Quarter and a Nail: Look 3
s. in the first Column, and against it in the second you have 9 d. the price of
a Quarter, and in the third Column 2 d. 1 q. the price of a Nail.

If the Pound cost 9 s. and you would know what an Ounce is worth; Against 9 s.
in the first Column, you will find in the third Column 6 d. 3 q. the price of
an Ounce. And if you buy any thing by the Hundred, see the first Column for the
price of a Pound, and suppose the 112 cost 8 l. 9 s. Note,

Against 8 l. in the first Column is 1, 5, 0, 4. in the 4th.

Against 9 s. in the first Column is 0, 0, 3, 6. in the 4th. Add these, and
they give the Price of a Pound; viz. 1 s. 6 d. and a 4th part.

And by this Rule you may proceed to a greater quantity, as the occasion
requires; so that at first sight you may be informed to your satisfaction, in
what is before you, and with little pains be enabled to proceed.

Suppose now you had a Lease to continue ten years, and you would know how many
years purchase in ready Money it is worth: To do this, find 10 years in the
Table in the Lefthand Column, and against it there appears 7 years, 4 months,
and a third part of ^ months Rent of the Lease. Let the Lease be what it will;
or if the Lease has 31 year in remainder, and you would know its true value,
Look for 31 in the Table, and against it you will find 13 years, 11 months, and
1 part of a month, let the Rent be what it will.

Note, That in these Tables of Wages and Expenses the Months consist but of 28
Days.

The foregoing Table is easy to be understood, and therefore wants little
Explanation, for you find in the uppermost row 1 d. a day, 7 d. a week, 2 s. 4
d. a month, 1 l. 10 s. 5 d. a year; and so of the rest. And indeed this Table
being often before our Eyes, will make us more frugal, when we see what a
little a day amounts to in the year; for every penny will purchase 3 feet
square of good Land freehold for ever; which for the better reclaiming
Spend-thrifts, will not be amiss to demonstrate; viz.

Ten feet and a half being a Rod, and 40 Rods (that is 660 feet) in length, and
four such Roods (that is 66 feet in breadth) makes an Acre of Land; it follows
then by Multiplying 660 by 60, that every Acre contains 4356 square feet,: Now
it is presumed that good Land may be had for 20 s. an Acre Rent; or 20 l. for
an Acre Purchase, that is, 4200 d. Now if you divide 4356 by 4800 the Quotient
is 9, and the 360 remaining, which shows that every penny does purchase 9
square feet, that is a yard every way, and something better.

Exact Rules, with Tables and Examples for measuring Stone, Glass, Pavement,
Timber, Building, and all other things by a generous Improvement, highly
necessary to be known.
IN Mensuration, sometimes it is done with a Rule, sometimes with a Chain, and
sometimes with a Line, the Foot Rule is 12 Inches, and every of these divided
into 12 parts, and every part into 12 other parts, and so to the most minutest
degree: But in the easiest and quickest way of Measuring, it must be observed
to multiply the sum given by the Integers of the Multiplyer, always beginning
from the least denomination, and carrying one for every twelve to the next.
Then for the parts:

Multiply the inches into feet, which divide by 12 quotes, inches and parts;
then multiply inches into parts, which divide by 12 quotes, parts into parts;
parts into feet, and divide by 12 quotes, inches and parts.

Parts into inches, and divide by 12 quotes, first parts and second parts.

Parts into parts, and divide by 12 quotes, second and third parts, and so
proceed; always observing, that if the Quotient be more than 12, then divide
it again by 12, and the Quotient will be a denomination higher: But for your
better Instruction, make use of the following Table, and observing to set one
denomination under another, the sum is the product.

A Table for Multiplying Foot measure.

50 -- 600 60 -- 720 70 -- 840 80 -- 960 90 -- 1080 100 -- 1200

And to do this it will be convenient for better Instruction to lay down
further Rules or Examples, by way of explanation; and therefore observe with
wariness what follows.

The Example.

Feet Inch. Parts Feet Inch. Parts. Multiply 8 9 6 by 7 8 5

^ Observe in this that 7 times 6 is 42 as in the Table, and the nearest number
on the Left Hand is 36, the difference 6 is writ down, and 3 carried, which
stands against 36 to the next denomination; 7 times 9 is 63, and 3 carried is
66: The nearest number in the Table is 60, the difference 6 writ down, and 5
carried to the next denomination; 7 times 8 is 56, and 7 carried is 61, which
write under Feet; then proceed and multiply by the 8 Inches, and say 8 times 8
is 64, and against its nearest number 60 you find 5, and the remainder is 4,
viz. 5 Feet 4 Inches; against 8 times 9 is 72, against which in the Table I
find 6, taken for 6 Inches; and 8 times 6 is 48, against which stands 4, which
is 4 first Parts: Then to Multiply the parts, 5 times 8 is 40, and the nearest
of numbers in the Table to it is 36, against which stands 3, the difference
being 4; viz. 3 Inches and 4 Parts. Then 5 times 9 is 45, against its nearest
number 36, we find 3, and there remains 9, that is to say, 3 first parts and 9
second parts; then to come to a conclusion, 5 times 6 is 30, against 24 its
nearest number I find 2, and the remainder is 6, that is 2 second parts, and 6
third parts; all these added together give the product.

If you undertake to measure things of length and breadth; as Board, Glass,
Pavement, Wainscor, Tiling, and such like; the Content is found by multiplying
the length into the breadth, which is commonly taken in Feet, Inches and Parts.
Board and Glass are measured by the Foot square, containing 144 square Inches.
And now suppose you have a piece of Plank of 16 Inches square, how many square
Feet is contained in it.

EXAMPLE.

Setting down 1 Foot 4 Inches, ^ under 1 Foot 4 Inches, multiply them together
as is taught by the foregoing Table, etc. and the Area or Content is 1 square
Foot, 49 Inches, and 4 Parts.

A Window that has 4 panes or pannels of Glass, each pane 1 Foot, 9 Inches,
and 6 parts broad, and 4 Foot, 7 Inches, and 6 parts long. To know how many
square Feet of Glass are contained in all.

Multiply the length by 4, and say ^ 4 times 6 is 24, which divided by 12,
quotes 2, and nothing remains, you must carry 2 to the next denomination,
writing down nothing: Then 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 carried is 30, which divide
by 12 quotes 2, and leaves 6, then write down 6, and carry the 2 to the next;
this being done, I take 18 Foot for the breadth, and proceed as before.

Suppose there is a Court to be paved of 18 Foot, 6 inches long, and 14 Foot, 6
inches Broad, and you are desirous to know the Content of square yards, the
Rule is to multiply the length by the breadth, and to divide the product by 9.

EXAMPLE.

^ Having Multiplied the length and breadth together, divide the square feet by
9, and so you have 29 yards, 7 feet, 3 inches, for the content of the said
Pavement.

In Measuring of solid bodies, observe that solid feet and inches are required.

And now suppose you are to measure a piece of Timber, 14 foot long, and 18
inches broad. As for Timber, it has the end either Square or Oblong, or in
some other Figure: The general Rule to measure them all, is to find the Area of
the end, and let that be muliplyed by the length; but suppose again, a piece of
Timber, whose breadth and thickness is 8 inches, and length 14 foot, what then
is the solid content? In this case ^ Multiply the breadth and thickness one
into another, and you will find 5 Inches, 4 Parts, which Multiply by 14, the
length, and the solid Content is 6 Foot, 2 Inches, and 8 Parts.

Though Brick-Walls are in some kind accounted superficial measure; yet when
necessity constrains to outrun the common thickness, which is a Brick and
half, they must be reduced by solid measure; or if they be under the accustomed
thickness, they must by this way of Measuring be brought to bear with it; for
the better understanding of which it will be requisite to set down a Table of
Direction.

A Table of Mensuration, confirming what has been premised; very useful for all
Practitioners and Artificers.
Foot Inches. 0 4 1 0 8 2 1 4 2 1 8 3 2 0 3 2 4 4 2 8 4 3 0 5 3 4 5 3 8 6 4 0 6
4 4 7 4 8 7 5 0 8 5 4 8 5 8 9 6 0 9 6 4 10 6 8 10 7 0

And now having a Wall of 3 Bricks thick, 14 foot, 6 inches high, and 44 feet,
10 inches in length, and you would know how many square Roods are contained
therein. Against the 3 Bricks in the first Column, you find the number 2, and
by that multiplying the height, the increased for height is the 1 and Brick,
the Proof thus, ^

And by these Rules f^rther light and improvement may be ^^d.

An Introduction to the Rule and Mystery of Gauging, very useful and profitable
for all whose Study or Employment lie that way.
IN Gauging, to find the true Content of any Cask or Vessel.

First, Observe the form of the Vessel, and if it be irregular, reduce it to a
regular proportion.

Secondly, To discover in Cubick Inches of the Gallon, or parts of a Foot.

(1.) Measure the Diameter of the Vessel at the Bung and Head, and by the
Diameter find out the Areas of the Circles; then take the two thirds of the
Area of the Circle at the Head, and add them together, then multiply the sum by
the length of the Vessel.

(2.) By the Content of our Gallon, the measure of all these Vessels must be
known: A Wine-Gallon is reputed to contain 151 Cubick Inches; however it is
most convenient first to find the Area of the Circles, and then the Content of
the Vessel in Cubick Inches; and lastly, to reduce this into Gallons, which is
best done: When you compute the Gallons by Cubick inches, as directed.

To Measure a Barrel that is round and bellyed in the middle.
Multiply half of the thickness in Inches, by half the compass about, and that
product by the length in the Inches; the last product divide for Ale or Wine by
288, and the Quotient shows the number of Gallons contained in the Barrel; and
to bring these Gallons into Barrels, divide the Quotient by 36, to make them
come near with a Beer Barrel; but if the Barrel bellies extremely in the
middle, measure but half to the Bung, and working as before, add the products
together, and they give the content, always observing that the Diameter of the
Bung and the Head being put together, the one half be taken for the true
content.

Note, That you have (...) and a third part of Inches to the Gallon; and th^s
you (...) a brief Introduction into the Mystery of G^^ging.

Curiosities relating to Measuring and Gauging; as a Supplement to the
foregoing Treatise. To know how many Load of Hay a Barn will hold.
MUltiply the height to the Beam into the breadth, and that product by the
length, the whole divided by 20, and the Quotient shows the Loads to the Beam,
and for the Roof, multiply half the depth into the breadth at the Beam, and
that product by the length, then working as before, add it to the other.

To find the solid Inches in a Globe.
Suppose the Diameter to be 21, multiply 21 by 21, and that product by 21,
which multiply by 11, and the product will be 101871, which being divided by
21, gives 4851 the solid Inches in the Globe or Bullet; and so of greater or
lesser.

To Measure or Gauge a Square Tun or Vessel.
Multiply the length, breadth, and depth in Inches together, and the last
production divide by 288, and the Quotient shows the Gallons, and that Quotient
by 36, to bring it into Barrels.

A Coard of Wood is 4 foot over, 4 deep, 8 long, being 128 Cubick feet. A Stack
of Wood is 3 feet over, 3 feet deep, and 12 long, which makes 108 Cubick Feet.
Fifty foot of Timber makes a Load; 40, 8 Tun weight. A Cubick Foot contains
1728 Inches; a Cubick Yard 27 Cubick Feet or 46656 Inches; 300 Foot of 2 Inch
plank, 200 Foot of 3 Inch plank, 15 Foot of 4 Inch plank, 400 Foot of 1 Inch,
and 600 of an Inch, make either of them a Load.

of the said Havens, add the Hours and Minutes right against each Haven, to the
Moons coming to the South, and the whole result will be the time of High Water;
and by this Table you may find the Point of the Compass, the Moon is in at High
Water: As for the Southing of the Moon, it may be taken by observation; or the
Almanac will direct you; the S. W. and N. E. Points always make High Water at
London.

Signs of Weather.
RAin is toward, when the Sun shows broad in Rising, as through a Mist, or has
a Circle about it; when it sets in a black Cloud, or looks pale and waterish.

The Moon pale, and blunt-horned near the change.

The Sky red in the morning; the often change of the Wind, many scattering
Clouds North-West at Evening; Wind long in the South, Stars dull and hardly
appearing, or seeming dull and large, as through Mists.

Expect fair Weather when the Sun rises bright, and Mists are on the Water;
when the Bees fly far from their Hives, and the Rainbow shows very light in the
blew part, when the Sun sets red, and casts direct beams.

Expect storms of Wind when there is a duskey redness in the Moon and Sun; a
soft murmering in the Woods; Meteors shooting in the Air; a dull Circle about
the Moon; a red Morning and Sea-Fowl flocking to the Shore.

How to discover bad and counterfeit Money.
IF a piece be smooth and worn, hold it to the light, the flat uppermost, and
the edge to your eye, and if it be Brass or Copper, you will perceive it
blacker in one place than another. If a half Crown belly out, fling it hard
upon a stone edge-ways, and if it be plated the plate will give way; or if you
throw it down flat-ways, it will fall dead.

If the Letters be mackled, and an old piece feel rough in your hand, it is a
sign of a Counterfeit: If Milled Money look more than ordinary whitish or pale,
it is but searching, and you will find it either adulterated Metal, or Copper
double gilt, if it sound hollow in the fall, expect it is plated. As for
Guineas, many of them are counterfeit, by double gilding or imbasing, which may
be tried by fire; for being heated, they will immediately change color.

Seasons for Husbandry every Month in the Year.
IN January remove Bees, bleed Calves, prune Vines, dung Pasture, prune
Fruit Trees.

In February dress your Bee-stools, lay fresh Earth to the Roots of
Fruit Trees, sow Carrot-seed, Pease, Oats, and set Quicks.

In March sow Turnips, Beans, Pease, make up Gardens, sow forward Seeds, graft
and geath Layers: If the Weather be warm Purge and let Blood.

In April lop Ashes, Willows, and weed your Grounds.

In May sow Pursley and latter Seeds.

In June take off the Luxuriant Branches of the Vine, clip Quick-hedges, set
Rosemary, and water choice Fruit Trees.

In July cut off the needless Succors, drive Bees, Mow and Graft.

In August sow Turnips, take Bees, and choose the best Weather for inning your
Harvest.

In September Purge and let Blood, sow Wheat and Rye, remove young Trees.

In October geath Apples and Vintage, make Cider and Wines to keep all the
year, lay open Fruit-Tree Roots.

In November cut Timber, Moss, Fruit Trees, kill Swine, geld Calves.

In December keep good Fires, and make good Cheer.

An exact Account of Troy and Averdupoize weight, wet, dry and long measure; in
measuring Commodities, Land, etc. set out in Tables, words at length explaining
them to the meanest capacity.
TRoy Weight is that by which Gold, Silver, Electuaries, Amber, Jewels, Bread,
Corn, Liquors are weighed by; and indeed from this Weight, all Measures for wet
and dry Commodities are taken, and is thus accounted;

Troy Weight.
Grains. Penny-weight. 24 Ounces. 20 480 Pounds. 12 240 5760

The pound Troy is in proportion to the pound Averdupoize, as 17 is to 14, and
the Ounce as 51 to 56: And note by the way, that when Wheat is at 5 s. the
Bushel, then a Penny Wheaten Loaf is to weigh 11 Ounces Troy, and 3 halfpenny
white Loaves the like weight. The Household Penny Loaf 14 Ounces; and so
proportionable for a greater or lesser quantity.

The Apothecaries have a weight peculiar to themselves, in some matters
somewhat differing from the former, though in the main, it comes to the same
end: An Example of which the following Table will produce.

Apothecaries Weight.
Grains Scruples. 20 Drams. 3 60 Ounces 8 24 488 Pound. 12 96 280 5760

Although they make up their Medicines by this Weight, yet they buy and sell
their Drugs by Averdupoize; and because in theirs, and Doctors Bills, and
sometimes in Reading Physic Books, there are Characters not known to the
vulgar, it will not be amiss for their better understanding to explain them;
viz.

Recipe. Take thou; Ana of each a like; P. a Pugil or half handful; M.
Manipulus, a handful; Q. S. quantum sufficit, a sufficient quantity; Gr. a
Grain; a Scruple, or 20 Grains; a Dram, or Scruples; ss, semissis, or half a
Pound; lb a Pound, or 12 Ounces.

Averdupoize Weight weighs all manner of things that have waste: As Drugs,
Grocery, Rosin, Wax, Tar, Pitch, Tallow, Hemp, Flax, Soap, and all base Metals
and Minerals; As Lead, Steel, Iron, Tin, Copperas, etc. and for the computation
of this Weight, take the following Table.

Drams Ounces. 16 Pounds. 16 256 Quarters. 28 448 7168 Hundreds. 4 112 1792
28672 Tuns. 20 80 2240 35840 573440

This Tun is 20 hundred weight in all things but Lead, and there is allowed but
19 hundred and a half to the Tun or Fodder; 112 pounds being allowed in most
things to the hundred weight; but in Allom, Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Pepper and Sugar,
there is accounted but 108 pounds. Essex Cheese and Butter are weighed by half
Stone or Clove, being 8 pound; and 32 of these Cloves are a Wey, or 256 pounds.
Wool is sold by the Clove, allowing but 7 pound to the Clove, and 14 pound to
the Stone, 28 to the Tod, and 182 pounds to the Wey, 364 pound to the Sack, and
4368 pound to the Last: A Faggot of Steel is 120 pound, a burden of Gad Steel
180; 56 pound of Butter, or 60 pound of Soap makes a Firkin, two Firkins the
Barrel: And further note, though for many things the Stone is 14 pound, yet for
Flesh it is allowed but 8.

As to Measures, they are distinguished by three kinds, Wet, Dry and Long: And
first, the Wet Measures have likewise their differences in some degree; viz.
Ale Measure has but 32 Gallons to the Barrel, which is 2 Kilderkins, 4 Firkins,
64 Pottles, 128 Quarts, and 256 Pints; and Vessels for Butter, Fish, Soap, etc.
are made after this Measure. Beer Measure has 36 Gallons to the Barrel, which
is 2 Kilderkins, 4 Firkins, 72 Pottles, 144 Quarts, 288 Pints.

Wine Measure, the Hogshead is 63 Gallons, the Pipe or But 2 Hogsheads, or 126
Gallons; the Tun 2 Pipes or Butts, or 252 Gallons; the Tierce is 42 Gallons.

Dry Measure, is that sort by which Corn and the like are measured by; and in
this 2 Pints are a Quart, 2 Quarts a Pottle, 2 Pottles a Gallon, 2 Gallons a
Peck, 4 Pecks a Bushel, 8 Bushels a Quarter, 5 Quarters a Wey, and 2 Weys a
Last; or to take it another way, the Last is 2 Wey, 10 Quarters, 80 Bushels,
320 Pecks, 640 Gallons, 1280 Pottles, 2560 Quarts, and 5120 Pints. Note, That a
Bushel of Salt Water measure should contain 5 Pecks.

Measures of length, thus; the length of 3 Barley corns taken out of the middle
of the Ear, is accounted an Inch, 12 Inches a Foot, 3 Feet a Yard, 5 Yards and
half a Pole, 40 Pole a Furlong, 8 Furlongs a Mile: Or thus, either; 8 Furlongs,
320 Poles, 1760 Yards, 5280 Feet, or 63360 Inches, make a Mile.

Super-square measure makes out the square mile, as in the following Table.

Feet. Yards. 9 Poles. 30 272 Roods. 40 1210 10890 Acres 4 160 4840 43560 Mil.
640 2560 102400 3097600 27878400

So that by this Account, 640 square Acres make the square mile; and so of the
rest, as in the Table is plainly to be seen.

An Account of Time in Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months and Years; with the
denomination of the principal Feasts, or Quarter-days, with the days,
Shrove-Sunday, Easter Day, Ascension-day, Whit-Sunday, and the moveable Terms
will fall on for twelve Years to come: Also the endings of the Terms.
THE measure of time arises from Minutes; and of these 60 make an Hour, 24
Hours a Natural Day, 7 Days a Week, 4 Weeks a Month, 13 such Months; 1 Day, and
6 Hours, a Year; but this Year is commonly divided into 12 equal Calendar
Months, their number of Days, many of them being unequal, are set down in these
Lines.

Thirty days has Fruit-bearing September,
Moist April, hot June and cold November;
Short February Twenty eight alone,
The other Months, each claim his Thirty one:
And February when her fourth Year's run,
Does gain a day then from the traveling Sun.
So that by this Rule, February every Leap-Year having 29 days, that year must
consist of 366 days, being a day more than others.

The Year is again divided into 4 Quarters, viz. The Feast of the Annuntiation
of the Virgin Mary, called Lady Day, on the 25th of March; the Feast of St.
John Baptist, called Midsummer-day, on the 24th of June; the Feast of Michael
the Archangel, called Michaelmas-day, on the 29th of September; and the Feast
of Christ's Nativity, called Christmas Day, on the 25th of December; and now by
reason there are some days that vary and move, falling higher or lower,
according to the changing of the Moon; as Shrove-Sunday, Ascension-day and
Whit-Sunday, it will be worth our pains to give an account how they shall
exactly fall for twelve years to come.

And now because Easter and Trinity Term are likewise moveable, it will be very
proper to give the like years to come upon them, of which we therefore present
you a Table of their exact beginning and ending.

Sundry rare Receipts and curious useful Experiments, worthy of Notice.
To whiten Ivory.
TAke fine new slaked Lime, and cover the Ivory with it when it is pretty hot,
and it will take away the yellowness or defect.

To Cement Glass, or fine China Ware.
Take the glare of Eggs, Egg-shells and quick Lime, and beat them together to
an extraordinary fineness, adding a little of the Powder of Gum Sandrick, and
when it is moist, smeer the edge of the broken thing, and clap it on even, and
it will be as strong there as in other places.

To take blots out of Paper or Parchment.
Drop a little Allom-water, and rub it gently ore with Cotton-Wooll.

To write like Gold without it.
Take Gum Armoniack, a little Vermilion, and the glare of Eggs; mix them well
together, and thin them with water to a temper fit to write withal.

To write like Silver.
Take an ounce of block Tin, and as much Quicksilver; melt the Tin, and mix
them together; then grind or file them into Gum-water, and the writing will
appear like Silver.

To make good Black Ink.
To a gallon of clear small Beer, put half a pound of Galls well bruised, 3
ounces of blew Copperas, then stir them often, putting in 2 ounces of Gum
Arabic, and so set it warm, and it will prove a curious black.

To make Red Ink.
Take the Raspings of Brazile-wood two ounces, Allom half an ounce; let them
soak in 3 pints of small-Beer Vinegar, then put an ounce of Gum Arabic, and a
little Vermilion, and simper it over a ^entle fire.

To make Red, Green, or Black Sealing-Wax.
Take a pound of Bees Wax, three ounces of Turpentine, Read-Lead, or
Vermillion, as much as will color it; melt them over a gentle fire, well
incorporating the Ingredients; and thus Green and Black Wax is made; if to the
first, instead of Vermillion you put Verdegrease; and to the latter, black
Earth or Lamb-black.

And in this manner, by the addition only of the Names, Titles and Places, you
may make this Bond from three to one; or as many as you will; and if you be to
make a Bond from one to two, or three, or more; then add the Titles, Names, and
Aboads after the teneri and firmiter obligari, otherways before it; and thus
changing what is necessary, you may make it for as many, or as few, as the
occasion requires; and if the money be to be paid at a certain place, that
place must be mentioned in the Bond; and if you agree for Interest from the
time of Sealing, it must be mentioned in the Condition (after the Sum named)
with Lawful Interest; or otherways it is held no Interest shall begin till the
Bond become due, and the Latin Obligations serve for sundry other Conditions;
the forms of which I shall set down.

The Condition to perform an Award.
THe Condition of this Obligation is such, That if the above-bounden W. G. his
Executors and Administrators, and every of them, for his and their part in all
things, do, and shall well and truly stand to, obey, perform, fulfill and keep
the award, arbitrament, order, rule, doom, judgment, and final determination of
A. B. C. D. Arbitrators indifferently chosen, nominated and appointed, as well
on the part and behalf of the said W. G. of the one part,

to arbitrate, award, order, judge of, and determine all and all manner of
Actions, Suits, Debts, Damages, Accounts, Trespasses, Controversies and
Demands whatsoever, had moved, stirred or depending, or which might have been
had, or moved between the said Parties, at any time before the date of these
Presents; so always as the same Arbitrators do make their award and judgments,
of and concerning the Premises, by a Writing indented under all their Hands and
Seals, on or before the first day of April, next ensuing the date hereof,
really to be delivered to the said Parties; Then this Obligation to be void,
and of none effect, or else to stand and remain in full force and virtue.

Note, That if either party after Signing and Sealing refuse to stand by the
award, and molest or trouble the other, the sum mentioned in the Bond be sued
for, as if it were for Goods or money lent, and be recovered by Action. etc.

A Condition to perform Covenants.
THe Condition of this Obligation is such, That if the above-bound G. R. etc.
do and shall from time to time, and at all times hereafter, well and truly
observe, fulfill, perform and keep, all and singular the Covenants, Grants,
Articles, Payments, Promises and Agreements, which on the part and behalf of
the said G. R. and his Heirs, Executors, etc. or any of them, or to be
observed, fulfilled, performed and kept, contained and specified in one pair of
Indentures, bearing date the third of April, 1691, made between the said G. R.
of the one part, and the within-named C. T. of the other part, according to the
true intent and meaning of the said Indenture: Then this Obligation to be void
and of none effect, or else to stand in full force and virtue.

Note, That the Contents of the Covenant or Agreement, must be set forth at
large in a pair of Indentures; one party keeping the one, and the other, the
other; for if the Indenture cannot be produced to which this Bond refers, it
will be of little use; wherefore sometimes the Covenant of Agreement is
particularly mentioned in the Condition.

The Condition of a Bail-Bond.
THe Condition of this Obligation is such, That if the above-bounden A. P, do
appear before our Sovereign Lord the King, in his Court of King's Bench at
Westminster, Die Sabbati proxime post Octav. Sancti Hillarii, to answer G. C.

How to be informed what any Sum of Money, Interest upon Interest, at 6 l. per
Cent. will come to in 21 Years.
This Table is very plain l. s. d. qr. 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 5 2 3 1 3 9 3 4 1 5 3 0
5 1 6 9 0 6 1 8 4 1 7 1 10 1 3 8 1 11 1 2 9 1 13 9 1 10 1 15 9 3 11 1 17 11 2
12 2 0 2 3 13 2 2 7 3 14 2 5 2 2 15 2 7 11 0 16 2 10 9 2 17 2 13 10 0 18 2 17 0
3 19 3 0 5 3 20 3 4 1 2 21 3 7 11 2 and easy to be understood, however that
none may be left in Ignorance, I shall here set down some Examples, for the
better Explanation: As suppose you would know what (at Interest upon Interest
for 20 Years) 36 l. comes to: Look against Number 20, in the first Column, and
you will find what the Interest upon Interest comes to for that time; then by
the Rule of Three say,

If 1 l. be 3 l. 4 s. 1 d. 2 qr. what 36 l?

If I desire to know how much 346 l. will amount to in 13 Years, Interest upon
Interest at 6 per Cent: Look against Number 13, in the first Column, and you
will find 2 l. 2 s. 7 d. 3 qr. Then say as before,

If 1 l. be 2 l. 2 s. 7 d. 3 qr. what 346 l.?

^

And by this Rule you may know what any other Sum will come to for longer or
shorter time.

Equation of Payment, etc.
EQuation of Payment is the Rule among Merchants, whereby to Reduce the time of
Payment for several Sums of Money to an Equated Time, for the Payment of the
whole Debt, without damage to the Debtor or Creditor; and the Rule is, to
Multiply the Sums of each particular Payment by its respective Time, then add
the several Products together, and their Sum divided by the Total Debt, and the
Quotient thence arising is the Equated Time for the Payment of the whole Debt.

Loss and Gain in Buying and Selling easily known by Rules and Examples.
SUppose a Merchant buys 436 Yards of Silk for 8 s. the Yard, and sells it
again at 10 s. 4 d. per Yard, How shall he presently know what he gains? Why
thus,

Answer 39 l. 19 s. 4 d.

In the first place find out by the Rule of Three, or Practice, how much the
Silk cost him at 8 s. 6 d. per Yard, viz. 185 l. 6 s. then by the same Rule
find out how much he sold it for, viz. 225 l. 5 s. 4 d. then Subtract 185 l. 6
s. (which it cost) from 225 l. 5 s. 4 d. (which he sold it for) and there
remains 39 l. 19 s. 4 d. gain: And by this Rule you may compute a greater or
lesser quantity; as also by deducting know what is Lost, as well as Gained.

Rules of Barter in way of Trade among Dealers, and not to be overreached.
BArter is a Rule among Merchants, and other Traders, which in the Exchange of
one Commodity for another informs them in such a manner to Proportion their
Rates as that neither may sustain Loss.

Suppose two Traders, viz. C and D, Barter, C has 13 Hundred, 3 Quarters, and
14 Pounds of Ginger at 2 l. 16 s. per Cent. and D has Pepper at 9 d. per Pound,
How much Pepper must D give C for his Ginger?

We Answer, 9 Hundred, 1 Quarter: And for the easy finding this out, in any
Quantity or manner of Goods, first find by the Rule of Three how much the
Ginger is worth, saying, If 1 C. cost 2 l. 16 s. what will 13 C. 3 qrs. and 14
lb. cost?

Answer 38 l. 17 s.

Secondly by the Rule of Three say, If 9 d. buy 1 lb. of Pepper how much will
38 l. 17 s. buy?

Answer, 9. and so much Pepper must be delivered for 13 C. 3 qrs. and 14 lb. of
Ginger; and so you may Proportion any other Goods, though of different Values,
and bring them to a Regular bearing.

Tables of Liquid Measure.
Wine Measures. Gallons Gallons Hogsheads. 63 Tierce. 42 Pipe or But. 2 126 2

Kilderkins. 2 18 36 72 144 Barrel. 2 4 36 72 144 288

By these Tables you may perceive, by the degrees of their descent, how by
being Multiplied a small Quantity arises to a greater; as in Wine-Measure 63.
Gallons make a Hogshead, 42 the Tierce, and so to the rest; and in Beer-Measure
2 Pints make a Quart, and so on-war ^s: These Tables being very necessary for
ready casting them up.

At what Rates Provisions may be Transported out of this Kingdom into Foreign
Parts, and what not.
ACcording to the Statute made in the Twelfth of K. CHARLES II, Gunpowder when
it exceeds not 5 l. the Barrel, may be Exported: Wheat, Rye, Pease, Beans,
Barley, Malt, Oats, Pork, Beef, Bacon, Butter, Cheese, and Candles, may be
Exported when they do not exceed the following Prizes, at the Ports where they
are Laded, at the time of their Lading, viz, Wheat the Quarter 2 l. Rye, Pease
and Beans the Quarter 1 l. 4 s. Barley and Malt the Quarter 20 s. Oats the
Quarter 16 s. Beef the Barrel 5 l. Pork the Barrel 6 l. 10 s. Bacon the Pound 6
d. Butter the Barrel 4 l. 10 s. Cheese the Hundred Pound 30 s. Candles the
Dozen Pound 5 s. paying the respective Rates according as they are set down in
the Book of Rates; yet it is so provided, That the King may, when he sees it
convenient, put a stop to the Transportation of any Gunpowder, or other
Ammunition, Naval, or Warlike Stores.

The Drapers and Cloathiers Direction in Measure and Weight of English Woollen
Cloth, very necessary to be known by all Dealers in it.
KEnt, York, and Reading Clothes should be 6 Quarters and an half wide, be in
length 34 Yards, and weigh 86 lb. Suffolk, Norfolk, and Essex Clothes, of 7
Quarters wide, are to be 80 lb. weight, 29 and 32 Yards in length: Worcester,
Coventry, and Hereford Clothes, of 6 Quarters and an half, are to weigh 78 lb.
and to be in Measure 30 and 33 Yards: Gloucester, Oxen, Somerset, and Wiltshire
Clothes, of 7 Quarters wide, are to weigh 76 lb. and to be in length 29 and 32
Yards: Suffolk Sorting Cloth, of 6 Quarters and an half wide, ought to weigh
64 lb. and be in length 24 and 29 Yards. All sorts of Clothes, that are 6
Quarters and an half wide, are to weigh 60 lb. and be 24 and 26 Yards in
length. Broad and Narrow Yorkshire Cloth, of 4 Quarters wide, is to weigh 30
lb. and be in length 24 and 25 Yards.

The Broad-cloath of Taunton, Bridgwater, and Dunstable, of 7 Quarters, are to
weigh 30 lb. the Cloth, and to be in Measure 12 and 13 Yards: Devonshire
Kerseys and Dossers, of 4 Quarters, must weigh 13 lb. and be 12 and 13 Yards in
Measure: Chequered Kerseys, Grays striped and plain, of 4 Quarters wide, are to
weigh 24 lb. a Cloth, and to be 17 or 18 Yards in length: Penistones or
Forests, of 3 Quarters and an half, should weigh 28 lb, and be in length 12
and 13 Yards: Sorting Penistons of 6 Quarters and an half, should weigh 35 lb.
and be 13 and 14 Yards in length: Washers of Lancashire, and others, the
Clothes should weigh 17 lb. and be in Measure 17 and 18 Yards.

This useful custom of Assizing Cloth at a certain weight was at first Imposed
to hinder Defrauds in making sleasie and spungy Cloth, and therefore if any
Cloth be found worse than is here specified, the Maker, or Seller, ought to
allow according to the want, either in length or weight, and for refusing, an
Action lies against him for a Defraud.

Things very material to be considered on accepting, giving or paying Bills of
Exchange, to prevent Delay, Trouble or Cost.
I. OBserve when any Bill is received, or accepted, to note in your Book, the
Name of the Place of Abode of the Person, or of him that sends it you.

II. Keep Copies of the Bills sent to be accepted, and for your better safety,
make the Direction of Bills on the In side, and especially for these Reasons,
viz.

1. By knowing the place of Abode of him that presents the first Bill you may
be the better excused if he Except against the second Bill from the same hand
before the first be satisfied.

2. By taking of Copies of Bills sent to get Acceptance, you may know how
Exchanges go in diverse Places, and readily turn to the time you are to call
for your Money; for every Person who gets a Bill to be Accepted, must present
it in due time, that the Party may order his Affairs accordingly, and not be
surprised with a Bill when just become due.

If a Bill be Protested after Acceptance, it does not clear the Party who was
faulty in Non-payment, but renders him liable to pay the Charges, and Exposes
himself to an Action at Law, to which before he was not liable, nor is the
Drawer clear, but obliged to see the Bill satisfied.

Again, It is dangerous to draw a Bill payable to the Bearer, because if he
happen to lose it, any Person might bring it that finds it, for Acceptance and
payment: So that it is best, for the preventing such Accidents, to make it
payable to a particular Man, or his order, or otherwise, if it should be paid
to the wrong Party, he on whom it is drawn, is not liable to pay it again,
unless a Fraud or Connivance be proved.

If a Man accept a Bill for part, and not for the whole, he must have an
Acquittance for no more than he Received, and the Party must protest against
the Bill for non-payment of the rest.

Useful Instructions for Masters and Owners of Ships, in the Managing their
Matters, and preventing the Damage that may be Incurred through Ignorance.
I. IF a Master of a Ship has the trust of Goods in his care, and they be
Imbezled in the Port, or on the main Ocean, he must make them good to the
Owner, or Merchant; as likewise the damage they sustain by carelessness or
neglect; for he is Exercitor Navis, and is either by Marine, or common Law,
liable to answer for the neglect of his Mariners: But if a Ship be taken by the
Enemy, foundered, or be lost in a Storm, the Master is not liable to make
satisfaction.

II. If a Master send off his Boat to receive Goods at a Wharfe, and they be
Imbezled by the way, he is liable to make them good; nor at his peril ought he
to bring home, or freight any prohibited Goods unknown to the Merchant or
Owners that entrust him, nor Sail with false Colors, or carry false Cocquets,
or other false Papers; for if by such means the Goods are involved in trouble
or lost, he is liable to make Restitution.

If he sends Goods in a close Lighter to a Wharfe by his own Mariners, and they
be Imbezled before delivery, he is bound to make them good; but if the
Wharfinger sends his Men, and fetches them, then in case of Loss he is only
liable.

If a Master brings a Ship into any Port, and there through his neglect she
suffers damage for it, he is liable to answer it.

A Master may lawfully sell, or pawn, part of the Lading to refit or mend the
Ship, if she be in any danger, but not to defray any Charges of his own.

These and many other Obligations are binding upon a Master by the Laws Marine
and Common^ the M^rriners being accountable t^ the Master, he to the Owners,
and they to the Merchant, for all Damages sustained by neglect of their
respective Duties or breach of Contract upon these occasions.

This way of Account in Reckoning and Bargaining was formerly used in all
Cities, Towns, and Counties of England, as the current way of Buying and
Selling and is so still in most Country Fairs and Marts; wherefore that none
may be at a loss to know how Nobles and Marks are reducible to Pounds, it is
plainly demonstrated in this Table: As for Example, If you would know how many
Poun. 10 Nobles make, look in 1 Col. for 10, and in the second Collume against
it you will find 3 l. 6 s. 8 d. and going to the next Coll. you find 10 Marks
make 6 l. 13 s. 4 d. and so of the rest.

This Table refers properly to Buying and Selling; for if a Merchant, or
Dealer, vends his Commodity to be paid, as they usually do, at the times
mentioned, and after the Bargain is made for such Credit, the Debtor is willing
to pay ready Money, if the other accept it he must abate so much of the
interest as it would come to in the time, as if so much Money was put out to
Interest, at the usual Interest of 6 l. per Cent. and then you will find, under
each proportion of time, the same answered as to the Rebate.

Coachmen their Fares in and about London.
BY an Act of Parliament made in the Fourteenth Year of Our Sovereign Lord King
CHARLES the Second, it is appointed, That no Hackney Coachman shall presume to
take for his Hire in or about the Cities of London and Westminster above Ten
Shillings for a Day, reckoning 12 Hours to the Day; and by the Hour, not above
18 Pence for the first Hour, and 12 Pence for every Hour after: Nor for his

the same places to the Inns of Court, or places thereabouts; nor from the Inns
of Court, or thereabouts, to the Royal Exchange, more than 12 Pence; but if to
the Tower, Bishopsgate-Street, Aldgate, or places thereabouts, 18 Pence; and so
from the same places to the said Inns of Court, as aforesaid. That the like
Rates be observed from or to any place at the like distance with the places
before-named. That if any Coachman shall refuse to go at, or exact more for
his Hire than these Rates, he shall for every Offense forfeit 10 Shillings.

Of the Inferior Courts in and about London, the Days and Places where they
are held, and Attendance given, etc.
I. THE Marshals Court is held on Frydays in the Marshalseas in Southwark, and
its Jurisdiction extends 12 Miles every way from White Hall, and no further.

II. The Court of Request, commonly called The Court of Conscience, is held at
the Upper-end of Guild Hall, London, Wednesdays and Saturdays.

III. The Court of Hustings is held on the Hustings on Tuesdays at Guild Hall.

IV. The Two Sheriffs Courts for the Two Counters are held in Guild Hall, for
Woodstreet Counter Wednesdays and Fridays, and for the Poultrey Thursdays and
Saturdays.

V. The Mayors Court is held Mondays and Tuesdays, and every Day in the Week if
the Lord Mayor pleases to Sit; and this we have the rather noted, because many
mistaking the days of one Court for another, have been Nonsuited, or otherways
miscarried in their Business for want of Attending in due time to their great
detriment and damage.

How to kill Bugs and Moths in any Room, or Clothes, highly necessary to be
known.
MAke the Room as close as possible may; Take Brimstone, Steraks and the Roots
of Helebore, burn them in a large Chaffing-dish of Coals, in the middle of the
Room, and the Smother being kept close unto the Room will destroy them.

To destroy Caterpillars or Worms from Fruit Trees in the Spring, Smother under
the Trees, in the Evening, with were Straw, or a sprinkling Pitch, and they will
fall off and dye.

On Saturdays to all parts of Wales, Scotland and Ireland; and Letters are
returned certainly every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, from all parts of
England and Scotland; from Wales every Monday and Friday; and from Kent and the
Downs every day; but from parts beyond the Sea more uncertain, by reason the
Winds often hinder them.

The Carriage of every single Letter, not exceeding one Sheet, to or from any
place, not exceeding 80 miles is 2 d. double 4 d. not exceeding two sheets. The
like Carriage of every Packet of Letters, proportionable to these Rates. The

Dublin in Ireland for 6 d. double 1 s. and an Ounce of Letters 12 d.: A single
Letter to Berwick upon Tweed is 3 d. a double 6 d. and an Ounce 1 s. 6 d. And
this for the greater advantage of speed as the business may require; it is done
in so short a time, by Riding day and night, that Floods or violent Rains
hinder not. The Post in 24 hours goes 120 miles, and an Answer in 5 days may be
had, if there be no delay in 5 days.

As for Riding Post, 3 d. a mile for every English mile is the due, and 4 d. a
Stage for the Posts guiding or conducting. As for Foreign Letters, the
Merchants generally know the Prizes, and few others being troubled with them,
we for brevity omit the Prizes.

Note, In this case, that M. stands for Monday, T. Tuesday, W. Wednesday, Th.
Thursday, F. Friday, and S. Saturday; and according as they are thus marked,
the Markets are held.

An exact Catalogue of the fixed and moveable Fairs, held Yearly in England and
Wales; the days and times of their continuance; the like for exactness, never
before published.
THE Fairs are of two sorts as to the times of their being held; some are fixed
to a certain day, others change their days, or are moveable with the Feasts:
Therefore since no exact Account, as we know of, has been hitherto given, we
shall labor to satisfy the curiosity of those, whose Pleasure or Advantage
tends that way; and for those that are fixed, take them, for the more regular
way, in their Month.
