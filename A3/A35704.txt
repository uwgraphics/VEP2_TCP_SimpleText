Deplorable news from Southwark;
Or, the loving Lasses Lamentations for the loss of their Sweet-hearts.
They sigh, they sob, they sorrow and complain,
Fearing their Loves will never come again:
It is the lusty Soldiers as they say,
Have stolen from them their pretty hearts away.
The tune is, Saint Gyleses.


THe Lasses now of Southwark
lament and make great moan,
Because from them their sweet-hearts
departed are and gone.

The Soldiers which in Southwark
did quarter here and there,
Each one of them that had sweet-hearts
was constant to his dear;
Both civil in their actions,

And yet some of the Lasses now
Complain for lack of marrriage.

Has stolen their bonny hearts from them away.
To draw to a conclusion,
I wish all Damsels mild.
Both them that have flat bellyes,
and them that are with child:
To bear all things with prudence,
and suffer patiently,
And buy each one a Hand-kercher
to wipe her wet eyes dry.
And when your
Sweet-hearts
Come to you again,
They Will use a means to cure you of your pain,
Be not too heavy-minded,
but thus I Would have you pray,
That those which stole your hearts from you
and carried them away,
May come again with safety,
and make you all amends,
To marry you and love you,
and so my Ditty ends.
The valliant,
Gallants
Has stolen your hearts away,
They Will bring them home again another day.
