Magnum IN PARVO.

THE English Guide TO THE LATIN TONGUE: OR A Brief System OF ALL The most
necessary RULES FOR THE Initiating of YOUTH IN THE Rudiments of Grammar.

LONDON, Printed for R. Royston, at the Angel in Amen-Corner, Bookseller to His
Most Sacred Majesty, 1675.

A Fevv Words TO THE READERS.
THe Author is no professed Grammarian, nor indeed so much as a Pretender to
any extraordinary skill in the learned Languages; but being sensible that his
mean abilities can never encourage him to hope for any such Preferment in the
Church wherein he is an unworthy Minister, as may enable him to give his
Children Education abroad, he resolves they shall not want the best he can
afford them at home; and that he may not rob himself of too much of that time
which he is bound to improve another way, to the best advantage of the
Congregation wherewith he is entrusted, he has composed this short Grammar,
for the greater ease (as to him seems) both of Teacher and Learner: His only
design of printing it being to save himself the labor of transcribing it so
often as Children will be apt to sully and blur it before they can perfectly
learn it.

If any man else shall think it useful to him for the like service, it may not
be amiss to tell him, that Examples of the Rules of Syntax are not therefore
omitted because they are thought useless; but partly to lessen the charge of
printing, yet chiefly, because in teaching, the Author uses to give his
Scholar an English Sentence, explaining the Rule by it, and giving him Latin
Words, shows him how to turn it into Latin by his Rule, and here he always
makes choice of the English of such Words as are expressed in the Rules
concerning Nouns and Verbs, omitting no one Word necessary to be observed, but
bringing it into one or other of those Examples. By this course the Learner
has in a short time a Paper of Latin Sentences, which he often reads instead
of Lessons usually taught, and reaps this considerable advantage by it, that
whereas in reading an Author, he shall often have occasion of exemplifying and
repeating the same Rule many times in a Lesson, and other as necessary Rules
not once in a quarter of a year; by going over his Paper of Examples he shall
have occasion to repeat and call to mind every Rule in his Grammar once a Week
for some time; and afterward, when he reads Authors, this will be a more
profitable Exercise for the first Morning Part, as it is called, then (as the
Custom is) to repeat so much of his Grammar by Heart.

If any dislike this way, he may follow his own; and may, if he please to be at
no farther trouble, furnish himself with store of Examples to every Rule from
the most approved Authors out of Mr. Farnaby's Systema Grammaticum, and the
little Grammar of Ger. Jo. Vossius, to which two I acknowledge my self indebted
for a great part of what is here done.

THE English Guide TO THE LATIN TONGUE.
A Sentence is made of Words, a Word of Syllables a Syllable of Letters.

There be Nineteen Latin Letters, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i, l, m, n, o, p, q, r,
s, t, u, x.

K, y, z, are Greek Letters, and h is no Letter, but a Note of Aspiration.

Letters are either great or small,
The great are called Capital.
Proper Names, Sentences, and Verses all
Begin with Letters Capital.
There be five Latin Vowels, a, e, i, o, u. Y is a Greek Vowel.

There be fourteen Consonants, b, c, d, f, g, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, x,

J and V in the beginning of a Syllable before a Vowel are Consonants.

There be four Liquids, l, m, n, r, and eight Mutes, b, c. d, f, g, p, q, t.

Three are called double Consonants, x, z, and j, when set between two Vowels.

Of Vowels are made Dipthongs; there be four proper Dipthongs, ae oe, au eu,
and four improper Dipthongs, ai, ei, oi, ui.

A Syllable is either but one Vowel, as a, e, i, o, or a Vowel with one or more
Consonants sounded together, as ab, abs.

C before e or i, sounds like s. G before e or i, sounds like j Consonant. Ti
before a Vowel sounds like si, except after s, or when it begins a word.

A Word is either one or more Syllables.

A Consonant between two Vowels in a word begins the following Syllable, as ge
-- ne -- ra -- tio. If two like Consonants come together, the later begins the
following Syllable, as an -- nus. Two unlike Consonants which can begin the
first Syllable, may also begin any other Syllable in a Word, otherwise the
latter begins the following Syllable. If a Word be compounded or made of two
Words, each Part shall have its proper Consonants.

A Line must always end with a whole Syllable.

A Word is either Primitive, or Derivative, which comes from the Primitive:
Again, a Word is either Simple or Compound, made of two or more simple Words.

There be eight kinds of Latin Words, Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Participle, Adverb,
Conjunction, Praeposition, Interjection.

Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs, and Participles vary the ending, or are declined; the
rest do not.

Nouns.
A Noun is the name of a thing. Some Nouns be Substantives, and some be
Adjectives.

A Noun Substantive may have a, an, or the before it, and cannot have the Word
thing immediately after it; as a man.

A Noun Adjective may have the Word thing immediately after it, and cannot have
a, an, or the before it, except a Substantive follow, as good, white.

A Noun Substantive is Proper or Common.

A Noun Substantive Proper is the Proper Name of some one thing, whereby it is
commonly known from others of the same kind, as John, London.

A Noun Substantive Common or Appellative, is a Common Name, whereby we call
all things of the same kind, as Man, City.

Numbers.
There be two Numbers, the Singular noting but one, as a man; and the Plural
noting more than one, as men.

Persons.
There be three Persons. The first Person, I, we. The second Person, Thou, ye,
and every Vocative Case. The third Person, He, they, and all Nouns, Pronouns,
Verbs and Participles, not implying. I, we, thou or ye.

Cases.
There be six Cases. The Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Vocative and
Ablative. The Nominative is called Casus rectus, the rest are called Casus

Verbs.
A Verb is a Word which signifies, to do, to be, or to be done.

A Verb Personal is formed in all three Persons; a Verb Impersonal in the third
Person only.

There be four kinds of Verbs, Active, Passive, Neuter and Deponent.

A Verb Active or Transitive signifies to do something toward another, and in
Latin ends in o, as amo, I love; by adding r, it is made a Passive, as amor.

A Verb Passive signifies to be done to by another, and in Latin ends in or,
as amor, I am loved; and by losing r is made an Active, as amo.

A Verb Neuter signifies an absolute doing, being or suffering, and in Latin
ends in o or m; as Sio, I stand, frigeo, I am cold. Sum, I am; it cannot take r
to make it a Passive. Sum, forem, existo, are Neuter-Substantives. Vapulo,
veneo, sio, liceo, are called Neuter-Passives.

A Verb Deponent in Latin ends in or, and signifies either Actively, as Sequor,
I follow; or Absolutely, as Morior, I die; or both Actively and Passively, as
Osculor, I kiss, or am kissed.

Moods and Tenses.
Verbs have four Moods. 1. The Indicative Mood, declaring or showing. 2. The
Imperative Mood, bidding or commanding. 3. The Potential Mood, implying some
possibility. 4. The Infinitive, without Number or Person.

Verbs have five Tenses. 1. The Present, noting the time which now is. 2. The
Praeterimperfect, noting the time passing not quite past 3. The Praeterperfect,
noting the time quite past. 4. The Praeter pluperfect, noting a time before
another time past. 5. The Future, noting the time to come.

Participles.
A Participle is a Word made of a Verb, and declined like a Noun.

There be four Participles, two Active, and two Passive.

Active Participles.
1. A Participle of the Praes. Tense Active, has its English in ing, as
loving, and in Latin it ends in ans or ens, as amans, docens, declined like
Adjectives of one ending.

Iens of eo has Genesis cuntis: So its Compounds except ambientis.

The English of the Participle in ing, with a or the before it, is a Noun
Substantive; with a Praeposition before it, commonly a Gerund.

2. A Participle of the Fut. Active, has the English Sign ready or about to,
as ready or about to love; and in Latin ends in rus, as amaturus, docturus,
Declined like Adjectives of three endings.

Passive Participles.
1. A Participle of the Praes. and Praet. Passive has its English in d, t or
n, with the Word being expressed or understood before it, as being loved,
taught, slain; and in Latin it ends in tus, sus or xus; as amatus, visus,
nexus: Declined as Adjectives of three endings.

2. A Participle of the Fut. Passive has its English in d, t or n, with the
Sign to be before it, as to be loved, and in Latin it ends in dus, as amandus:
Declined like Adjectives of three endings.

The English of a Participle Fut. Passive after a Noun or Verb Adjective is the
Infinitive Mood or later Supine.

Verbs Neuter have ordinarily only the Particles of the Praes. and Fut. in rus.
Deponents have usually three Participles, Praes. Praet. and Future in rus.
Where the Praeter has the English having, as secutus, having followed.

The Praes. Participle is made of the Imperf. by turning bam into us: The
Participle of the Future Active is made of the Supine by turning um into urus.
The Praet. Participle is made of the same by turning um into us The Participle
in dus is made of the Praesent Participle by turning s into dus.

Mortuus, moriturus, oriturus, nasciturus, pariturus, sonaturus, arguiturus,
cruiturus, are irregular.

A Participle compared, or used Substantively is turned into a Noun.

Adverbs.
Ad Adverb is a Word undeclined, commonly joined with Verbs to explain their
signification. Adverbs are of many sorts; as of Place, as Where, here, there,
etc. Of Time, as now, hereafter, to day, long ago, etc. Of Number, as often,

There be diverse sorts of Conjunctions: as

Copulatives, and, also, etc. Disjunctives, either, or, nor, etc. Concessives,
although, albeit, etc. Adversatives, but, notwithstanding, etc. Caus^ls, for,
because, etc. Conditionals, if, unles, etc. Illatives, therefore, wherefore,
etc. Electives, rather, than, etc. Exceptives, except, besides, etc.

Que, ne, ve are Encliticks set at the end of another Word.

Prepositions.

Apposition or Composition.

A Separable Preposition stands before a Word, and governs a Case commonly
either Accusative or Ablative, as to, unto, in, into, toward, against, before,
after, for, beside, with, by, beyond, under, etc.

Inseparable Praepositions are only used in Composition, as am, di, dis, re,
se, ve, con.

Interjections.
An Interjection is a Word undeclined, expressing some Affection or Passion of
Mind; as Joy, Evax, io. Exclaiming, O. Flattering, eja. Wondering, papae.
Threatening, vae. Lamenting, hei, heu, eheu, ah. Fear, atat. Disdain, hem, prob,
hui, vah. Calling, heus, eho. Silence, au, st. Loathing, phy. Laughing, ha ha,

Adjectives in the Neuter Gender are sometimes used Adverbially.

Adverbs may be compared, which come of Adjectives which admit of Comparison.

Figures belonging to Words.
Prothesis, adds to the beginning, as Gnavus for navus.

Epenthesis, adds in the middle, as Alituum for alitum.

Paragoge, adds to the end, as Dicier for dici.

Aphaeresis, takes from the beginning, as conia for ciconia.

Apostrophus, is a a Note, signifying the want of some Letter thus, Egon' for

Hyphen, notes two Words to be joined as if it were one compounded Word, thus
ante-malorum. We use the same Note in the end of a Line, when part of a Word
ends the Line, and the other part begins the next Line.

Accents.
There be three Accents belonging to Words; Acute, Grave and Circumflex, but
these are seldom expressed in Latin.

An Acute Accent is thus marked, dominus: a Grave thus, docte: a Circumflex
thus, mos.

Monosyllables short, or long by Position, have an Acute Accent.

In Dissyllables the former has an Acute, when the later is short, and the
former long by Position; or when both are short.

Polysyllables having the last short, have an Acute in the last but two, or
antepenultima, as dominus: if the two last be long, the penultima, or last but
one has an Acute, as Sacerdos.

In Dissyllables the later has a Grave Accent; so have all Syllables which
have neither Acute nor Circumflex.

Monosyllables long by Nature, have a Circumflex, The former in Dissyllables
has a Circumflex, if it be long by Nature and the later short: So has the
Penultima in Polysyllables if it be long by Nature and the last short.

The Compounds of facio and sio, keep the Accent of the simple Verb, as
calesacit, calesit.

The ^ncliticks, que, ne, ve, cast the Accent on the forgoing Syllable, as
laurisque, except que in constant Composition, as undique.

Ablatives in a, Genitives in us, and ergo for causa have a Circumflex, for
distinction's sake.

Contracted Syllables are circumflexed, and Adverbs are accented to distinguish
them from Adjectives of the same ending.

Sentences or Syntax of Words.
Of Words joined according to Rule is made a Sentence.

Concordance or Agreement of Words.
1. A Verb Personal must be of the same Number and Person, with the Nom. Case
answering to the Question who or what, made with the English Verb.

2. An Adjective must be of the same Case, Gender and Number with the
Substantive answering to the Question who or what, made with the English
Adjective.

3. The Relative qui must be of the same Cender, Number and Person, with the
foregoing Substantive, that may be repeated again after which. Quis, qualis,
quantus, quot, quotus, uter, follow the same Rule.

4. More Substantives together noting the same thing, must be the same Case,
and the Verb, Adjective or Relative following must agree with the later; except
the former be a living thing and the later not, or the former an Appellative,
and the later a Proper Name of some Game.

Note, any Word or whole Sentence answering to what, may stand for a
Substantive of the Neuter Gender and third Person.

5. If no Nom. Case come between the Relative and the Verb, the Verb must agree
with the Relative.

6. Look what Case the Substantive that may be repeated after the Relative,
ought to be were it so expressly repeated, the same Case must the Relative be.

7. A Collective, or Distributive Singular may have a Verb Plural.

Plural, agreeing with the first rather than the second, and the second rather
than the third Person: likewise an Adjective or Relative Plural agreeing with
the Masc. rather than Fem. and Fem. rather than Neuter Gender; but if they
signify things without life, keep the Neuter Gender.

9. I, we, thou, ye, he, they and men, are seldom expressed in Latin.

10. The Word thing is seldom expressed, but implied in an Adjective of the
Neuter Gender.

11. Business, Work, Duty, Part, Property, Office, after the Verb it is, are
implied in the possessive my, thy, etc. of the Neuter Gender, or in the
Genitive Case of a Substantive after est.

12. The Relative often agrees with a Pronoun Primitive implied in a foregoing
Possessive; as mea refert, qui, etc. So the Genitive of a Participle Praesent,
and unius, solius, between a Pronoun Possessive and its Substantive may agree
with the like implied Primitive; as mea unius opera. Nostros vidisti flentis
ocollos.

13. When my, thy, our, your, etc, may have own added; they are made by
Possessives. If they cannot have own, or may be explained by of, for or toward
me, thee, etc. they are made by the Genitive of Primitives or Demonstratives.

14. If him, her, them may have self or selves added, they are made by the
reciprocal sui, if they may not admit self or selves, they are made by
Demonstratives.

Substantive, or a Verb Neuter of Gesture, after most Passives, (except rogor,
