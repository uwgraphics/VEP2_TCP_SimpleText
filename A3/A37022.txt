PROLOGUE For the First Part of DON QUIXOTE:
Spoken by Mr. Betterton. IN hopes the Coming Scenes your Mirth will raise
To you, the Just pretenders to the Bays;
The Poet humbly thus a Reverence pays.
And you, the Contraries, that hate the Pains
Of Labored Sense, or of Improving Brains:
That feel the Lashes in a well-writ Play,
He bids perk up and smile, the Satyr sleeps to Day.
Our Sancho bears no Rods to make ye smart;
Proverbs, and Merry Jokes* are all his Part.
The Modish Spark may Paint, and lie in Paste,
Wear a huge Steinkirk twisted to his Waste;
And not see here, how foppish he is Dressed.
The Country Captain; that to Town does come,
From his Militia Troop, and Spouse at home,
To beat a London-Doxies Kettle-Drum:
One, who not only the whole Pit can prove,
That she for Brass Half-crown has bartered Love:
But the Eighteen-penny Whore-masters above,
With his Broad Gold may Treat his Pliant Dear,
Without being shown a Bubbled Coxcomb here.
Grave Dons of Business, may be Bulker's Cullies,
And Crop-ear'd Prentices set up for Bullies,
And not one Horse-whip Lash here, flaug their Follies;
Nay, our hot Blades, whose Honor was so small,
They Would not bear Arms, because not Colf neis all:
That wish the French may have a mighty Slaughter;
But wish it safely, -- on this side of the Water.
Yet when the King returns, are all prepared,
To beg Commissions in the Standing-Guard;
Even these, the Sons of Shame and Cowardice,
Will 'scape us now, though it is a cursed Vice.
Our Author has a famous Story chose,
Whose Comic Theme no Person does expose,
But the Knights-Errant; And pray where are those?
There was an Age, when Knights with Lance and Shield,
Would Right a Ladies Honor in the Field:
To punish Ravishers, to Death would run;
But those Romantic Days -- alas, are gone;
Some of our Knights now, rather would make one,
Who finding a young Virgin, by Disaster,
Tied to a Tree, would rather tie her faster.
Yet these must 'scape too; so indeed must al*
Court-Cuckold-makers now not Jest does maul;
Nor the horned Herd within yon City-Wall.
The Orange-Miss, that here Cajoles the Duke,
May sell her Rotten Ware without rebuke.
The young Coquet, whose Cheats few Fools can dive at,
May Trade, and the Old, Tope Kniperkin in private.
The Atheist too, on Laws Divine may Trample,
And the Plump Jolly Priest get Drunk for Church-Example.
EPILOGUE To the First Part of DON QUIXOTE.
By Sancho Riding upon his Ass. Amongst our Forefathers, that pure Wit professed,
There Is an old Proverb, That two Heads are best.
Dapple and I have therefore jogged this way,
Through sheer good Nature, to defend this Play:
Though I Have no Friends, yet he (as proof may show,)
May have Relations here for ought I know.
For in a Crowd, where various Heads are addle,
May, many as Ass be, that never wore a Saddle.
It Is then for him that I this Speech intend,
Because I know he is the Poet's Friend;
And, as it is said, a parlous Ass once spoke,
When Crab-tree Cudgel did his Rage provoke;
So if you are not civil, 'sbud, I fear,
He Will speak again, --
And tell the Ladies, every Dapple here.
Take good Advice then, and with kindness win him,
Though he looks simply, you don't know what is in him:
He has shrewd Parts, and proper for his place,
And yet no Plotter, you may see by's Face;
He tells no Lies, nor does Sedition vent,
Nor ever Brays against the Government.
Then for his Garb he is like the Spanish Nation,
Still the old Mode, he never changes Fashion;
His sober Carriage too you have seen to day,
But for's Religion, troth, I cannot say
Whether for Mason, Burgis, Muggleton,
The House with Steeple, or the House with none;
I rather think he is of your Pagan Crew,
For he never goes to Church -- no more than you.
Some that would, by his Looks, guess his Opinion,
Say, he is a Papish; others, a Socinian:
But I believe him, if the truth were known,
As the rest of teh Town-Asses are, of none;
But for some other Gifts -- mind what I say,
Never compare, each Dapple has his Day,
Nor anger him, but kindly use this Play;
For should you with him, concealed Parts disclose,
Lord! how like Ninneys, would look all the Bea^s.

Slow. ^ YOUNG Chry -- sostome had Ver -- tue, Sense, Renown, and Manly Grace,

II.
Had Coy Marcella owned a Soul,
Half Beauteous as her Eyes;
Her Judgment had her Scorn controlled,
And taught her how to Prize:
But Providence that formed the Fair,
In such a charming Skin,
Their outside made their only care,
And never looked within.

The 4th. Song, Sung by a Galley-Slave in the 3d. Act.
Set by Mr. Henry Purcell.
^ WHen the World first knew cre -- a -- tion, a Rogue was a top, a Rogue was a
^ Top pro -- fession; when there were no more in all Nature but Four, there
were ^ two of them in trans -- gression, and the Seeds are no less, since that
you may ^ guess, but have in all As -- ges been growing a -- pace; there is
Lying and ^ Theiving, Craft, Pride and de -- cei -- ving, Rage, Murder, and
Roar -- ing, Rape, ^ In -- cest, and Whoring, Branch out from one Stock, the
rank Vi -- ces in Vogue, and ^ make all Mankind one Gy -- began -- ti -- call
Rogue. ^

View all human Generation,
You Will find in every Station,
Lean Virtue decays, whilst Interest sways,
The Will Genius of the Nation;
All are Rogues in degrees,
The Lawyer for Fees,
The Courtier Le cringe, and the Alderman squeez;
The Canter, the Toper,
The Church-Interloper,
The Punk, and the Practice of Piety Groper;
But of all, he that fails our true Rites to maintain,
And deserts the Cause Royal is deepest in grain.
He that first to mend the matter,
Made Laws to bind our Nature,
should have found a way,
To make Wills obey;
And have Moddel'd new the Creature,
For the savage in Man,
From Original ran,
And in spite of Confinement now raigns as 't began:
Here Is Preaching and Praying, and Reason displaying,
Yet Brother with Brother, is Killing and Slaying;
Then blame not the Rogue that free-Sense does enjoy,
Then falls like a Log, and believes -- he shall lie.
The 5th. Song for Cardenio in the 4th. Act.
Set by Mr. Henry Purcell.
^ LET the dreadful Engines of e -- ter -- nal will, the Thun -- der ^ To --

theirs as fa -- tall too, and dares as horrid, and dares as ^ horrid, horrid ex

Breast far, far grea -- ter ^ Tempests grow; despaire's more cold, more co --

can nothing, can nothing warm me? yes, yes, yes, yes Lucinda's ^ Eyes* yes,

Eyes; there, there, there, there, there Et -- na, there, there, there, there

yes, Lucinda's Eyes; yes, ^ yes, yes, yes, yes Lucinda's Eyes. Ye powers I did
but use her name. ^ and see how all, and see how all the Meteors flame, blew
lightning flashes round the Court of ^ Sol, and now the Globe more feircely
burns than once at Phaeton's fall. ^ Slow. ^ Ah! -- ah! -- where, ^ where are
now, where are now, where are now those ^ Flow -- r'y Groves, where Zephir's
fragrant winds did play? ah! where are ^ now, where are now, where are now
those flow -- r'y Groves, where Zephir's ^ fragrant winds did play? where
guarded by a Troop of Loves, the ^ fair, the fair Lu -- cin -- da sleeping lay,
there Sung the Nightingale, and ^ Lark, around us all was sweet and gay, we
never grew sad till it grew ^ dark, nor nothing feared but short -- ning day. I
^ glow, I glow, I glow, but it is w'th hate, why must I burn, why must I ^ burn,
why, why must I burn for this in -- grate, why, why must I ^ burn for this in
-- grate; Cool, cool it then, coo -- le ^ it then, and rail, since nothing,
no -- thing will pre -- veil. ^ When a Woman Love pretends, it is but till she
gains her ends, and for better, and for ^ Worse, is for Marrow of the Purse,
where she Jilts you over and over, proves a ^ Slattern or a Whore; this hour
will teize, will teize and vex, will teize, will teize and ^ ver, and will
Cuckold ye the next; they were all contrived in spite, to tor -- meant ^ us,
not de -- light, but to scold, to scold, and scratch, and bite, and not ^ one
of them proves right, but all, all are Witches by this light; And ^ so I fair
-- ly bid them, and the World good night, good night, good night, good ^ night,
good night, good night. ^

II.
Her Face was as fair, as if 't had been in Print;
Sing hey ding, etc.
And her small Ferret Eyes, did lovingly Squint,
With a hey down, etc.
Yet her Mouth had been damaged with Comfits and Plumbs,
And her Teeth that were useless, for biting her Thumbs,
Had late like ill Tennants, forsaken her Gums;
With a hey ding, hoe ding, etc.
III.
But when night came on, and we both were a bed;
Sing hey ding, etc.
Such strange things were done, there is no more to be said,
With a hey down, etc.
Next Morning her head, ran of mending her Gown;
And mine was plagued, how to pay Piper a Crown,
And so we rose up, the same Fools we lay down;
With a hey ding, hoe ding, etc.

I, must be plain I am none of your Men;
Passion for passion on each kind occasion,
With free inclination does kindle Loves Fire,
But Tedious prating,
Coy folly debating,
And new doubts creating still makes it expire.
The Ladys Answer. The 2d. Song to a Minuet at the Duke's Entertainment of Don
Quixote in the first Act.
^ YOU Love, and yet when I ask you to Mar -- ry me, still have recourse to ^
the tricks of your Art; Then like a Fencer you cunning -- ly par -- ry ^ me,
yet the same time make a Pass at my Hheart. Fie, fie, de -- ceiver, no ^ lon --
ger en -- dea -- ver, or think this way e -- ver the Fort will be won; ^ no
fond Ca -- ressing must be, nor un -- lacing or tender em -- bra -- cing
'tillth' ^ Parson has done. ^

II.
Some say that Marriage a Dog with a Bottle is,
Pleasing their humors to rail at their Wives;
Others declare it an Ape with a Rattle is,
Comforts destroyer and Plague of their lives:
Some are affirming,
A Trap it is for Vermin,
And yet with the Bait though not Prison agree,
Ventring that Chouse you,
Must let me Espouse you
If e're my dear Mouse you will Nibble at me*
The 3d. Song in the 2d. Act. Sung by Mrs. Ayliff, dressed like a Milk-maid.
Set by Mr. John Eccles.
^ YE Nymphs and Slyvian Gods, that Love green Fields and Woods when Spring
newly ^ born her self does a -- dorn, with Flowers and Blooming Buds; come ^
Sing in the praise, whilst Flocks do graze, in yon -- der pleasant Vale, of ^
those that choose their sleeps to loose, and in cold Dews with clout -- ed
Shoes, do ^ car -- ry the Milking Pail. ^

II.
The Goddess of the Moon,
With blushes they adorn,
And take the fresh Air;
Whilst Linnets prepare
A Consort on each green Thorn,
The Ousle and Thrush,
On every Bush;
And the Charming Nightingale
In merry Vain,
Their Throats do strain,
Go entertain
The Jolly train
That carry the Milking Pail.
III.
When cold bleak Winds do Roar,
And Flowers can spring no more,
The Fields that were seen,
So pleasant and green,
By Winter all Candid over,
Oh! how the Town Lass,
Looks with her white Face,
And her Lips of deadly Pale*
But it is not so,
With those that go,
Through Frost and Snow,
With Cheeks that glow,
And carry the Milking Pail.
IV.
The Miss of Courtly mould,
Adorned with Pearl and Gold,
With washes and Paint,
Her Skin does so Taint,
She Is withered before She Is old,
Whilst She in Commode,
Put's on a Cart-load;
And with Cushions plumps her Tail;
What Joys are found,
In Russet Gown,
Young, Plump and Round,
And sweet and sound,
That carry the Milking Paile.
V.
The Girls of Venus game,
That venture Health and Fame,
In practicing Feats,
With Colds and with Heats,
Make Lovers grow Blind and Lame,
If men were so Wise,
To value the price,
Of the Wares most fit for sale,
What store of Beaus,
Would dawb their Clothes,
To save a Nose,
By following those,
That carry the Milking Paile.
The 4th. Song. Sung by Mrs. Hudson in the 3d. Act.
Set by Coll. Pack.
^ DA -- mon let a Friend ad -- vise ye, fol -- low Clo -- ris though she ^ flies
ye; though her Tongue your Suite is slighting her kind Eyes ^ you will find in --
vite -- ing: Woe -- men's Rage, like shall -- low Water, ^ does but show their
hurt -- less Nature, when the stream seems Rough and ^ frowning, there is still
least fear of drowning.

II.
Let me tell the adventurous Stranger,
In our calmness lies our danger;
Like a River's silent Running,
Stillness shows our depth and Cunning:
She that Railes ye into Trembling,
Only shows her fine dissembling;
But the Fawner to abuse ye,
Thinks ye fools, and Sot will use ye.
