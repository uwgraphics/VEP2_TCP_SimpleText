A Cure for the State.
Or, An Excellent REMEDY Against the Apostasy of the Times.
AN Excellent Composition of Sir Henry Vane's Affection to the Ministry, of
Sir Arthur Hesilrigg's Honesty, of Henry Martin's Chastity, of the Lord
Fleetwood's Valor, of an High Court of Justice Mercy, of each two Grains. Two
Law-Arguments of Baron Wilde's own making, two Ounces of the Shavings of the
Lord Mayors Beard, one Scruple of Alderman Tichborn's Conscience, seven Drops
of Alderman Atkin's Elixary, one Pound of the CITIES SLAVERY, one Dram of
Kiffen's Divinity, with three full Gallons of Widows and Orphants Tears, boil
all these together the full time of one of Doctor Owens Sermons at the Fast of
the HOUSE, then closs stopped up with the Paste of Scotch Charity, the Speakers
Religion, and Sir Gilbert's Constancy.

Two spoonfuls of this taken every Morning fasting, will preserve you from the
like Apostasy, that the Army and other Saints have of late fallen into, and
make you stick close to the Parliament.
