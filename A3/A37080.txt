LONDON, Printed for William-Hope, at the sign of the Unicorn in Cornhill,
near the Royall-Exchange. Anno Domini, 1642.

TO THE Honorable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the House of COMMONS
in Parliament,
The humble Petition of John Dury, Minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in
the work of Peace Ecclesiastical amongst Protestants.
SEeing the motion of furthering Ecclesiastical Reconcilement amongst
Protestants has been hitherto very favorably entertained by foreign States
and Churches, which your Petitioner has dealt withal; so that Acts and
Declarations have bin made, and given to your Petitioner, wherein they manifest
their resolutions to advance the Work, and maintain Correspondencie with
others to that effect; which has been done not only by those that are abroad
in Germany, and elsewhere, but also here at home in the last general Assembly
of the Church of Scotland, where it has been enacted, that from henceforth
they should lay this matter to heart, and contribute their assistance
thereunto: and to this end they have appointed certain Divines to correspond
with your Petitioner toward the promoting of his endeavors of Peace. And
seeing moreover your Petitioner does with all thankfulness unto Almighty God
cheerfully observe, by the clause inserted into the public Remonstrance of the
State of this Kingdom, that there is a most laudable purpose intended, and a
good inclination expressed toward the furthering of the good of all
Protestants, for the preservation of true Religion, and the Union of their
Churches with ours in the same cause, against the common Enemies, which by our
divisions are encouraged to intend, and enabled to work out our destruction;
which they will certainly bring to pass, if the Fatherly Providence of our
good GOD, whose counsels are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out,
does not prevent their malice, by our loving concurrence in the ways of
Brotherly Union, for the maintaining of his glorious Gospel. And seeing lastly,
it is a public request in the late Petition of the Reverend Ministers, that a
day of Fasting and Prayers, for the welfare and prosperity of this Church and
State may be set apart every month, so long as your Honorable Assembly shall
continue, wherein I heartily concur with them:

Therefore your Petitioner does humbly request, that in the Order, which
hopefully will be made for the observation of that day of Fasting and Praying,
this purpose of Ecclesiastical Reconcilement of Protestants by the Union of
their spirits in the Truth of GOD, and against the Adversaries of Christ's
Gospel, may be expressly mentioned to be recommended unto GOD, by the prayers
of that public meeting. And also, that some Divines may be thought upon, and
nominated unto your Petitioner, to whom he should make his address to begin a
spiritual correspondencie, which in this purpose is necessary, for the
preparing and ripening of such proposals, as by the Grace of GOD will be able
to bring the wished for Union of Protestants in due time to some perfection.

And your Petitioner, as in duty bound, shall daily pray for his Majesty's long
life, his peaceable and happy reign over us, and for the prosperous success
of all your counsels and undertakings toward the blessed and flourishing
estate of this Church and Kingdom.
