NEWBERY.

^n the days of King Henry the Eeight; how ^e was beloved of his Mistress above
all her wealthier Suitors: what great and valiant things he did for England: and
the great number of poor he daily cherished.

^^d how (when the King sent for him) he refused (with his company) to leave
the Hill of Ants to go to the King: and therefore the King went to him: which
he wittily excused: with many other very pleasant passages.

The most delightful History of JACK of Newberry.
IN the Reign of King Henry the Eighth, one John Winchcomb, being an Apprentice
to a rich Clothier in the town of Newberry in Barkshire, a pretty handsome
Youth, his Master dyed, and left his Mistress a widow; ^ho perceiving Jack to
be a faithful, careful, and trusty Servant, she put him in great trust ^n the
House; who as carefully performed the ^rust reposed in him.

His Mistress having many Suitors com^ng to her, could not fancy any: for her
man ^ohn had stolen away her Heart. The Par^on of Spinhome-land wooed her, and
often solicited with her to make her his wife, but ^ould not obtain her love,
because he was a Clergyman; too much (she thought) de^oted to his Study. A
rich Tanner was a ^econd wooer, but could not speed; for though he was rich,
yet was he too old for her young and lusty desires. A Ta^lor was a third man,
who was almost confident of her love; but all in vain, for her man John, oh! he
was the man that had so wounded her heart that she could love no other man.

She seeing the backwardness of John, her man (after many occasions which she
gave him to woo her) came at last, and told him plainly that she loved him,
which secret she did earnestly desire him not to impart to any: but he very
modestly blushing with a Rosy color in his cheeks, not knowing how to express
himself as he desired, being astonished her eat; answered: Sweet Mistress
(quoth he) I am but a Child to undertake so great a thing! it is a charge, the
discharge whereof me thinks I fear to undertake: At which answer, she was
something discouraged in her suit for the present; and kissing of him, brake
off discourse for that time; and night approaching, she went to Bed; but took
but little rest: but either slumbering, (at the best;) or dreaming of her
pretty man John. She was so troubled, as if she had been wounded in a Prison,
and with many cogitations of her Beloved, fetched many deep sighs in that
dolesom and dark night: thinking it long e're ^orning came: rejoicing to see
the light ap^^ar: more to embrace her dear servant, or rather Master, John.

She going to see Bartholomew Fair, as Women use to do, to see and be seen,
took her ^^n Jo^n with her: who whilst she was talk^^g with a friend, espied
him saluting a pretty said, which made her own mouth water: and ^^ting her
lips, she left discoursing with her ^eighbor to go to John, to prevent his
further ^^miliarity with the maid.

Afterward she met with the Tailor her ^weet-heart, so neat as could be, in
the ^air: who desiring her to drink a Cup of ^ine with him, was denied again
and again, at by importunity she was persuaded: and (...) espying the Tanner,
called him into the ^avern to them, to help to bear Charges: ^^ttle imagining
that he was a Suitor to the ^ame VVidow: and both of them espying ^he Parson go
by, called him in, expecting (...) make him their solliciter: thus were they
^ll merely drawn into Cupid's Paradise: ^ut when each had discovered their
intents (...) other, they were all exceedingly perplexed, ^ot knowing how this
Division mig^t ^^^e ended: At last, it was desired of the Widow which of them
she loved best: and she answered, that she loved them all; and gave them thanks
for their charges; but (quoth the Parson) can you find in your heart to marry
me? It is your Office to marry, quoth she, and not mine. Then (quoth the
Tanner) will you make me your Husband? Truly Neighbor, quoth she, me thinks
you might better be my Father, you are of great Years to marry such a young
VVidow as I am. Then (quoth the Tailor) widow, it is I that must enjoy you;
shall you and I be married? Yes, I hope so (quoth the widow) when we and our
sweet-hearts are agreed: So desiring to take her leave of them, giving them
thanks for their costs they spent on her, she arose up to go away; but they
desiring a full answer from her, desired her to give them better satisfaction
to their Requests. If (quoth she) you will come to my House on Thursday, I will
give you full satisfaction: at which time they all came; and she told them all
then plainly, that she would marry none of them, for she had one nearer home,
whom she loved so well, that she could not marry any other man; so they went
all away very sad and discontented.

Night approaching, she talked privately with her man John, wooing him to marry
^^r; which he still through bashfulness ^^fused: And when night approached, she
cau^^d a special bed to be made for her man John (...) lie in; which bed was
only for special ^^rangers to lie in, or for her husband when (...) was not
well: and she lay her self in the ^^xt Chamber to him, which she locked up, and
^^pt the Key thereof her self.

But when she had lain in bed an hour or ^wo, she began to think it very long
to lie ^^one; so she arose out of her bed, and went to (...) man John,
shivering and shaking, and ^^^ting up his bed-cloths, he started; Who is ^^ere,
quoth he? It is I my sweet John, quoth ^^e, I am your Mistress; it is an
extreme cold ^ight, and I, lying alone, am almost starved in (...) Bed: Good
John afford me the favor of ^he Nights lodging by thy side, my John, I ^^ay
thee. Alas poor Mistress, quoth he, come ^^me lie close: Yea, yea, quoth she,
ah! poor ^^eet John; oh! sweet, sweet John: oh! sweet ^^d good John; but here I
leave them till the ^ext morning.

She got up very early in the morning, and ^ing for John her man to go abroad
with ^er, she took him to the Church of Saint Bartholomews; and casting for the
Priest of the place, she, with him persuaded John that they might then be
married together; which with small entreaty he was persuaded to; and s^^ they
returned home; and when they went to dinner, she made him to sit in her old
husbands Chair by her self at the end of the Table; at which his old
fellow servants began to ^e (...) and before Dinner was ended, she took him
about the neck and kissed him, and told her Servants that he was her Husband,
and commanded them to give him the respects due to a Master.

He also spoke lovingly to them, and told them, that he would not forget that
he was once their Fellow Servants, but would deserve their respects to the
uttermost of his endeavor. Thus they spent the day in loving ioyings, only
some oversight of the Workmen withal, and at night they went to Bed.

This new-married Bride was the next morning visited by diverse Gossips of her
acquaintance, that heard of the Wedding; who spent each of them their verdict,
what the event of this her hasty match would be: which Gossips did exceedingly
discourage her. Oh! but (quoth she) I will take an Order for that; for I will
curb him at the first, that will make sure that he shall never crow over ^e. I
warrant you.

And indeed ^^e began to grow as great a Gossip as any was in Newberry, and
would sometimes come home very late at night; in^^much, that at last her
Husband John went ^o bed, and locked her out; and took the Key (...) into his
own chamber: and when the good ^ife saw that she was shut out of doors, she
^nocked very hard, ^^ll at last her Husband looked ou^ at the window and bad
her to go look ^er lodging at night, where she had been sitting ^ll day: Su^^
Gossips (quoth he) as you, the ^age is the fi^te^ Lodging for, go to the
Constable and bespeak a ^ed of him.

Oh! dear Husband, quoth she, be not so ^^gry, I pray yo^ give me leave to come
into my Bed, good sweet H^sband, I pray you, and let me ^ot stand ^^us in the
cold, lest I ^ose my life thereby: After many fine words wherewith she ^ad
entreated her Husband to come down and o^en the door, he came down to her, and
^^t her in: to whom she dissemblingly p^^^^nded to have lost her Wedding Ring
from off her Hand, who lovingly going fo^th with the Candle in his hand (in his
shi^^^) looked up and down upon the ground for it: and she the mean time
stepping in, clapped to the door, and shut him out; whereat he was much
perplexed, and knocked a long time in the cold before she would answer, who at
last opening the window, ha^ him go look a Lodging with his Constable's Wife;
and asked him whether he thought it good to lie in the cold in the street: Now
(quoth. she) she who was even now at your mercy, has gotten you at hers. Oh sweet
Wife, quoth he, be not angry, but let me come in; I swear unto thee, that I
will never shut thee forth of doors again, but thou shall do what thou will and
I will never meddle nor make with you whatsoever you do hereafter: whereupon
she came down and opened the door, and let him in; and there they made great
protestations each to other, never to affront or fall out one with the other
after; and with a good Sack-posset the Covenant was agreed between them.

Shortly after the King was to raise an Army of Soldiers against the Scots,
who was risen against the English; and Jack of Newberry raised at his own
charges an hundred and fifty men; and allowed white Coats red Caps, and yellow
Feathers; and led them himself: fifty of them were valiant ^^^semen; fifty
Pikes, and fifty Musque^s; all brave Steeds, good Arms, and va^^^nt men; who
marching by before the ^ueen, Queen Katherine; she called for him, (...)
understanding what he was, after she had (...) forth her hand for him to kiss,
she promi^^^ to acquaint the King's Majesty with his ^e and great service.

A Song used by Jack of Newberry and his Soldiers.
KIng Jamie of Scots has raised
an Army against England:
^^t let him come, we will thunder him back,
he cannot us withstand.
^^ck of Newbery com's, proud Scots take heed
with valiant Soldiers stout;
'ho for brave England will sight with you,
and never will give out.
^ur milk-white Coats, red Caps,
and yellow Feathers declare,
^ur Resolution's stout and good,
there Scots we will not spare.
Shortly after Jack of Newberry heard tha^ the King was to ride by Newberry: so
he with his Servants went out into the field and finding an hill of Pismires,
drew his Sword and guarded it: And the King coming by, sent for him to know the
reason why he guarded that place with his sword drawn, the King in person being
to pass by there: wha^ returned answer. That he was busy* and could not speak
with him: and the King is on Horseback, and I am on foot, therefore (quoth he)
he may the better come to me. Tell the King, that I stand here to guard the
laborious Ants from their Ene^i^s: which Message being brought to the King, he
went to Jac^ of Newberry, expecting that it was done to make some jest for his
pleasure: and when the King came, Jack, with ^ll his m^n, fell on their knees,
and cried, God save the King: your Sacred Majesty (quoth he) has vanquished
all mine Enemies. Now trust me, quoth the King, you are ^tout Soldiers to
fight against Butterflies, and withstand such mighty Giants.

My dread Sovereign, quoth Jack of Newberry, not long ago, in my conceit, I saw
the most provident nation of the Ants, sum^^ned their chief Peers to a
Parliament, ^^ich was held in the famous City of Drie^stie, the one and
thirtieth day of September: ^^ereas by their Wisdoms I was chosen ^^^ir King:
at what time also many Bills of ^^mplaint were brought in against diverse ^ll
^^mbers in the Commonwealth, among ^^om the Mole was attained of High Treason
(...) their State, and therefore was banished for ^^er from their quiet
Kingdom: so was the ^^ashopper and the Caterpiller: because they ^^re not only
idle, but also lived upon the la^^rs of other men: Amongst the rest the
^utterflie was very much misliked, but few ^^^st say any thing to him, because
of his gol^^n A^parel: who, through sufference, grew (...) ambitious and
malapert, that the poor Ant ^^uld no sooner get an Egg into her Nest, but (...)
would have it away, especially against Easter which at length was misliked.

This painted Ass took snuff in the nose, and ^^^embled a great many other of
his own Coat, (...) windy Wars to root these painful peo^^e out of the Land,
that he himself might (...) above them These were proud But^^^flies, quoth the
King.

Whereupon I, with my men, quoth Jack, ^^^pared our selves to withstand them,
till such time as your Majesty's Royal presence pu^ them to flight.

The Song which Jack sung with his men before the King.
I Have taken upon me a charge
to govern these poor Ants,
That they may walk at large,
to gather in their wants.
That they may walk mo safe,
to bring home their relief:
And keep that which they have
from every idle Thief.
But now my King is here,
I bow down low my knee,
For we that vaunted here
are Subjects unto thee.
God bless thee Royal King,
and send thee long to Reign,
And joy in every thing,
and freedom from all pain.
I, and my men, and mine,
my Ants, and all we have;
^ommand us, we are thine,
and so the King God save.
Now to return again to Jack and his ^ife, it fell out that she fell sick and
dyed; (...) being buried Jack fell in love with one (...) his maids: and
sending for her Father, know what he would give with his Daugh^^^: he came to
Newberry, and seeing the ^^alth of his Daughters sweetheart, and ^ister, he
was astonished: for Jack had, (...)z. (...) one Room two hundred Looms all
going. ^wo hundred Boys making Quills. (...) hundred Women Carding. ^wo hundred
Maids in another Room spinning. (...) hundred and fifty Boys picking of Wool
^ty Shiermen. ^^ght Rowers. ^^^urty Dyers in the Dy-house. ^wenty men in a
Fulling-Mill. ^en fat Oxen he spent every week in his house, besides, Butter,
Cheese, Fish, etc. Butcher for his own house. Baker for his own house. Brewer
for his own house. Five Cooks. Six Scullion-Boys. Diverse Turn-spits, etc.


Sir, (quoth the old man) I wis the zee^ you be bominable Rich, and cham
content you shall have my Daughter, and God's Blessing and mine light on you
both. I vaith cham but a poor man, but I thong God cham of good exclamation
among my Neighbors and they will as zoon take my vice for any thing as a
richer man's: think I will bestow you shall have with a very good will, because
che hear very good commendation of you in every place; therefore thick give you
twenty Nobles, and a weanling Calf, and when I dye, and my Wise, you shall have
the Revelation of my Goods.

But Jack made more reckoning of the woman's modesty, and virtues, than of his
Fathers proffer; and he married her, and made a great Wedding: and instead of
receiving the old man's dowry, he gave him twenty pounds in money; besides
other good gifts.

Oh my good Zon! quoth the old man, Christ's benizon be with thee evermore. For
to tell thee true, we had zold all our Kine to make money for my Daughters
mar^^age, and this zeven year we should not ^ave been able to buy any more.
Notwith^tanding we should have zold all that ever we ^ad, before my poor wench
should have lost ^er marriage: I should have zold my coat from my back, and my
bed from under me, before my Daughter should have gone without you. I thank you
good Father and Mother (quoth the Bride) and I pray God long to keep you in
health: then the Bride knee^ing down, did her duty to her Parents; who weeping
for very joy, departed.

Now there was one Randal Pert a Dra^er, dwelling in Watling-street, who owed
to Jack of Newberry five hundred pounds. And it happened that Jack came up to
London; and as he went to his Customers, he met in the street this Randal Pert
in a frock, carrying a Porter's Basket, and an old ragged Doublet, and a torn
pair of Breeches, with his Hose out at Heels, and a pair of old broken
slip-shooes on his feer, a Rope about his middle, and a greasy Cap on his
Head, and newly come out of Prison.

Now was his Wife, who before for daintiness would not soul her fingers, nor
turn her head aside for fear of rumpling her nemkinger, yet now glad to go
about and wash Bucks at the Thames side, and to be a charewoman; her so^t hand
was now hardened with scouring, and instead of Gold Kings upon her Lilly white
fingers, her hands and fingers were now filled with chaps.

But when her husband espied Jack of Newberry his Creditor, he ran away as fast
as he could, for fear of being arrested: but he sent his man after him: who
seeing one pursue him, he ran the faster; and in running, here he lost one of
his flip-shooes, and there another, ever looking behind him with great fear: At
last his Breeches being tied but with one point, that with the haste he made,
and the oldness thereof, brake, and his Breeches fell about his heels: and did
so shackle him, that he fell down all along in the street with his Arse bare,
and an old ragged shirt, he lay sweating and blowing, being quite worn out of
breach: to whom the fellow came, and brought him to his Master: who took him to
a Scrivener, to give him Bond for the payment of the money: and the time of the
payment of the money was to be paid when the said Pert was Sheriff of London, a
thing very unlikely.

Well, the Scrivener made the Bond, to be paid when Randal Pert was Sheriff of
^ondon, and thereunto set his hand for a Witness, and twenty persons more that
^ood by.

And Jack of Newberry sent for a new suit Apparel for him out of Birchen-Lane,
and a ^^w shirt, and band; hat, hose, shoes, and all ^^ings necessary,
Merchant like; then he ^^ok for him a shop in Canwick-street, and fur^ished the
same shop with a thousand pounds ^orth of Cloth, by which means, and other
^avours which he did for him, he grew in good ^redit again, and became very
provident: and ^is wife turned to be the best Housewife in the Parish: and he
soon got good custom, and ^as very provident: and increased in wealth ^o that
he in short time became one of the best men for wealth in the Parish: and there
was ^o much notice taken of him, that he was ^^^sen Sheriff of London, and p^
^^e ^^e ^undred pounds every penny: and (...) House in his Shrevalty: and
afterward b^^ng an Alderman of Lon^o^, died before ^^ ^^me to be Lo^d Mayor:
and left his w^fe a gre^^ Estate.

Jack of Newberry, otherwise called Mast^^ John Winchcomb, being g^o^n very old
fell sick, and after few days (...) his Wife buried him in great Pomp: and he
left his Wife a great Estate, and many Legacies to Friends, and to many poor
people were left by him: and to his Burial came the greatest part of the
Country all thereabouts, to see the good old man laid in his Grave, where we
will leave him with this Epitaph.

EPITAPH.
^F Newberry here lies valiant Jack,
Shrouded in white, come to his end
(...) death that now has broken his back:
^ho to his Country was a friend,
^n aid t^ those that labor loved;
^n help to poor, both blind, and lame,
^en, Women, Children, all have proved
^he succor sweet that from him came.
Winchcomb adieu! God has thy Soul,
^hy body lies enclosed in earth,
^hy works brave Histories do enroul,
^hy, life, thy fame, even from thy birth.
