A DECLARATION TO ALL THE WORLD OF Our Faith, and what we Believe. And this is
written that all people upon earth may know by whom, and how we are saved, and
hopes for eternal life; and what we believe concerning God, Christ, and the
Spirit, and of the things that are eternal, appertaining to all mankind to know
and believe.
Concerning God, Christ, and the Spirit, this we believe.
FIrst, That there is only one true God, who is a Spirit, and his presence
fills heaven and earth, and he is Eternal and Everlasting, the Creator and
Preserver of all things, and Heaven and Earth, and all things therein, by him
were framed and brought forth, and all things remain unto this day by his
Power, and whatsoever he will in Heaven and Earth, he brings to pass by his
Word and Power. And we believe that this God only is, and ought to be feared,
loved, obeyed and worshipped by all creatures, and no other thing besides him
in Heaven or Earth; and we believe, That his Worship, and Obedience, and Fear,
and Love, is to be given in spirit, even in what his own Spirit moves and
leads his people unto. And we believe his true Worship, required and accepted
of him, is not by the Traditions of men, in outward observances, or set-dayes,
or places, but is worshipped only in spirit and truth, without respect of time,
places, or things; and that none can worship him in righteousness but his
children who are born of his spirit, and are led and guided thereby. And we
believe that this God has given his Son Christ Jesus into the Word, a
free-gift unto the whole World, and that every man that comes into the World
is lightened by him, that every man might believe, and be saved. And we believe
that he is given into the World, and no Nation, Country, or People excepted,
but unto all mankind is he given of God, and has lightened them, and every man
through the World, that believes in, and receives Christ, who is the Wisdom
and Power of the Father, shall be saved with eternal salvation; and every one
that believes not in him, shall be damned, and shall possess everlasting
misery. And we believe that Salvation, Justification, and Sanctification, is
only in him, and wrought by him, and no other; for there is no other Name
given under Heaven, but him alone, by which salvation is. And we believe all
that receives him, and believes in him are reconciled to God, and are made
alive to God, to live to him in all things, and does receive the forgiveness
of sins, and are set free from all unrighteousness, and from the body of sin
and death, and has the Witness of the Spirit in them; and the Spirit of the
Father they have received, and it witnesses in them of the Father and of the
Son, and of the things that belong unto their peace; and it is the earnest of
the Inheritance, and the Seal of the promise of eternal life; and by it are the
deep things of God revealed to mankind; and by it the Father and the Son dwells
in the Saints; and by it have they fellowship one with another; and the Father,
Son, and Spirit are one: And this we faithfully believe.

Again, Concerning Christ, We believe that he is one with the Father, and was
with him before the World was; and what the Father works, it is by the Son,
for he is the Arm of Gods Salvation, and the very Power and Wisdom of the
Creator, and was, is, and is to come, without beginning or end. And we believe
that all the Prophets gave testimony of him, and that he was made manifest in
Judea and Jerusalem, and did the Work of the Father, and was persecuted of the
Jews, and was crucified by his enemies, and that he was buried, and rose again,
according to the Scriptures. And we believe he is now ascended on High, and
exalted at the right hand of the Father for evermore; and that he is glorified
with the same glory that he had before the World was; and that even the same
that came down from Heaven, is ascended up to Heaven; and the same that
descended, is he that ascended.

And we believe even he that was dead, is alive, and lives for evermore; and
that he comes, and shall come again to judge the whole World with
righteousness, and all people with equity, and shall give to every man
according to his deeds at the day of Judgment, when all shall arise to
condemnation or justification, he that has done good shall receive life, and
he that has done evil, everlasting condemnation. And we believe he is to be
waited for in spirit, to be known after the Spirit, as he was before the World
was, and that is the knowledge unto eternal life; which all that believe in him
does receive; and he subdues death, and destroys him that has the power of
it, and restores from death to life, and quickneth by his Spirit all that the
Father has given him; and we believe such he justifies and sanctifies, and
such are taught of him; but he condemns all that believe not, but continues in
unbelief, and are not taught of him: And this we faithfully believe.

And we believe that unto all people upon the face of the whole earth, is a
time and day of visitation given, that they may return and be saved by Christ
Jesus, who is given of the Father to call the vvorst of men to repentance, and
the most ungodly of sinners are convinced by him of their ungodly deeds, that
they might believe, and be converted, and saved. And we believe herein is the
love of God manifested to all mankind, and that none is shut out by him before
they were born into the World; but unto all men is a Visitation given, and
they that do perish, it is because they do not believe in Christ; and
destruction is of a man's self, but salvation is of God, through believing in
his Son, who takes away sin, and renevveth into his own Image, that they may
become Heirs with him. And we believe that there is a Crown of eternal
glory, and an Inheritance of eternal life to be enjoyed for evermore by all
that believe and are chosen of God, and that there is everlasting misery and
destruction to be possessed by all that believe not, but continues in the stare
of reprobation, and are not changed from the Ways of sin and death, but walks
after the ways of their own hearts lusts, fulfilling the Will of the flesh, in
the evil of this World, and follows not Christ the Light of the World, that
they may be saved; and we believe upon all such the Wrath of God abides, and
that they have no part in the Inheritance of God. And we believe that it is
only he that is born again of the Spirit, and that walks after the Spirit, who
is changed from death to life, and who is redeemed out of the World and all its
Ways, such only must inherit the kingdom of God, and they only have right
thereunto, and none besides, even they that are washed and cleansed from all
unrighteousness by the blood of Jesus, by which their sins are remitted, for
his blood cleanses from all unrighteousness and sin, they that walk in the
light which Christ Jesus has lightened the World withal.

And we believe that the Saints upon Earth may receive forgiveness of sins, and
may be perfectly freed from the body of sin and death, and in Christ may be
perfect, and without sin, and may have Victory over all temptations by faith in
Christ Jesus. And we believe every Saint that is called of God, ought to press
after perfection, and to overcome the Devil and all his temptations upon earth;
and we believe they that wait for it shall obtain it, and shall be presented
without sin in the Image of the Father, and such walks not after the flesh, but
after the spirit, and are in covenant with God, and their sins are blotted out
and remembered no more, for they cease to commit sin, being born of the seed of
God. And we believe the Gospel of Christ is the Power of God unto salvation,
and that it ought to be preached freely unto all people, and Christ to be held
forth to all mankind by the Ministry sent of him. And we believe this Ministry
is received by the gift of the Holy Ghost, and all they that receive it, are
lawfully called to the Ministry, and they may preach the Gospel of Christ
freely, as they have received it freely; and this Ministry is not of man, but
of God, and is made powerful to the converting of sinners, and to the bringing
of people to God, and to the knowledge of his Ways. And we do not believe that
any man is a Minister of Christ without the gift of the Holy Ghost, or that the
Gospel can be received by natural learning or education. And we believe such as
preach for hire, and has hire for preaching, are not the lawful called
Ministers of the Gospel of Christ, such as are proud, and high minded, and
covetous men, who does not profit the people at all, such have run, and were
never sent of Christ, who calls by his spirit into the Work of the Ministry;
and as every one has received the gift of that his Spirit, so he may
administer to others.

Concerning Rulers and Governors; We believe that there ought to be Rulers and
Governors in every Nation, City, Country, or Town, and they ought to be such
men as fears God, and hates every evil Way, who will judge for God, and not
for man, and will judge righteously, equally, and justly, and will give true
and sound judgment unto all men, without bribery, or respect of persons, not
regarding the rich above the poor, but being a praise unto all that do well,
and a terror to all evildoers whatsoever, having knowledge in the pure Law of
God, and themselves continually exercised therein. And we believe that every
Law of man ought to be grounded upon the Law of God, pure Reason and Equity
being the foundation thereof, that Gods Witness in every man may answer to it;
and the Law ought to be known unto all people before transgression be charged
or punished in any man. And we believe that every Transgression ought to be
punished according to its nature, and that the punishment exceed not the
greatness of the transgression; neither ought any Transgressor to escape
unpunished; neither ought any upon false suspicion or jealousies to be caused
to suffer without the testimony of true men, or the confession of the party.
And we believe that the Executors of the Law ought to be just men, and not
given to pride, drunkenness, or any other evil whatsoever, and ought to be
chosen every year, or otherwise, by the common consent of all people, and that
no man be stopped of his free choice. And we believe that all Governors and
Rulers ought to be accountable to the people, and to the next proceeding
Rulers, for all their actions, which may be inquired into upon occasion; and
that the chiefest o^ the Rulers be subject under the Law, and punishable by it
if they be transgressors, as well as the poorest of the people: And thus true
Judgment and Justice will be brought forth in the earth, and all that do well
will have praise, and live in rest and peace and all evildoers whatsoever may
stand in awe, and be afraid of God, and just men, and the execution of good
Laws.

Concerning Religion; We believe that it is only the Spirit of the Lord that
makes men truly religious, and that no man ought to be compelled to, or from
any exercise or practice in Religion, by any outward Law, or Power, but every
man ought to be left free, as the Lord shall persuade his own mind in doing, or
leaving undone this, or the other practice in Religion; and every man of what
profession in Religion soever, ought to be protected in peace, provided himself
be a man of peace, not seeking the wrong of any man's person or Estate.

And we believe that to reprove false Opinions, and unsound Doctrines and
Principles, seeking to convince them that oppose themselves, by exhortation, or
sharp reproof, by Word or Writing, ought not to be counted a breach of the
Peace; or to strive about the things of the Kingdom of God, by men of contrary
minds or judgments* this ought not to be punishable by the Magistrates and
their Laws; for we believe that the outward Law and Powers of the earth is
only to preserve men's persons and estates, and not to preserve men in
Opinions; neither ought the Law of the Nation to be laid upon men's consciences,
to bind them to, or from such a judgment or practice in Religion. And we
believe that Christ is, and ought only to be Lord and Exerciser of men's
consciences, and his Spirit only must lead into all truth.

And we believe that obedience and subjection in the Lord belongs to Superiors
and that Subjects ought to obey them in the Lord that have Rule over them; and
that children ought to obey their Parents, and Wives their Husbands, and
Servants their Masters in all things, which is according to God, which stands
in the exercise of a pure conscience toward God: But where Rulers, Parents, or
Masters, or any other, commands or requires subjection in any thing which is
contrary to God, or not according to him, in such causes all people are free,
and ought to obey God rather then man; and we believe that herein God will
justify them, being guided and led by his spirit in all that which is good,
and out of all that which is evil.

Again, We believe concerning Election and Reprobation, that there is a state
of Election, and a state of Reprobation; a state chosen of God, and a state
rejected of God, and that all mankind is in one of these states; all that are
elected, are elected in Christ, and all that are out of him are in the state
reprobate, bringing forth fruits of death and darkness, being a child of wrath
and disobedience, in the alienation and separation from God, in the
transgression, unreconciled to God, the enmity ruling in the heart, being in
the fall, and not restored to God again, but ignorant of his power, and of his
Wisdom, having his understanding darkened that he cannot see nor perceive the
things that are eternal; and in this condition his best Works are sin, and in
whatsoever he does he cannot be accepted with God, for he is dead to God, and
alive to all evil, bringing forth all his Works out of that ground which is
cursed. This is the condition of all mankind upon the face of the Earth, in the
first Adam, and this is the state of Reprobation, and all that abide herein are
rejected of God, and shall never inherit eternal life, but goes into perdition;
yet have all such a day of Visitation, that they may return out of the state of
Reprobation; but hating knowledge, and despising the love of God, they continue
in the state reprobate, and the Wrath of God abides upon them: But they that
are chosen of God are delivered from Wrath, for they believe in the light, and
becomes children of the light, and are renewed in mind and heart, and receives
the love of the Father, and becomes planted into Christ the second Adam, and
are chosen in him to bring forth fruit unto the Father, and all their fruit
springs from that ground which is blessed; for they are led by the Spirit of
the Father, and such are in the estate of election, who is made Heirs with
Christ of the everlasting Inheritance that never fades away: And this we
faithfully believe, That mercy is not showed to the reprobate, nor judgment to
them that are chosen of God.

And this is to go abroad in the world that all people may understand what we
believe, and what we have received of God; and they that believe this, and walk
therein, by the Spirit of the Father shall be saved; but they that believe not,
but are disobedient to the truth, shall be condemned because they do not
believe. Much more might be written, but in short this is given forth by one
that have believed and received the knowledge of these things from God; A
Friend unto all people,

Edward Borough.
