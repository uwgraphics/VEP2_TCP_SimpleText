TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE CHARLES, Prince of WALES, etc.
SIR,
FInding this Manuscript, amongst others, I could not pass by it, as I did the
rest: The subject thereof being so rare a Prince, as it may seem worthy Your
Highness perusal: In reading Him You may read Your self* His Titles of Honor
were the same with Yours: Your titles of Virtues the same with His: He was, as
You are the Mirror of the Age; which, that You may still continue, shall ever
be the prayer of*

Your Highness most humble servant, N. B.

THE LIFE AND DEATH OF HENRY, Prince of WALES.
SIR,
YOur imposed task, when with the eyes of my mind I considered, I found such a
multitude of letts and rubs therein, that it seemed unto me a thing impossible
to dare to look after, much more to adventure to write any thing touching the
Life and Death of our late most noble, and ever renowned Prince, whose high
soaring thoughts, because the world was not able to contain, the heaven of
heavens vouchsafed to entertain; for both his far every where renowned Fame
thorowout this Isle, and the whole world being too great, that who should
adventure to say any more, should but in vain add water to the Sea: As also
the numbers of others nearer unto him, of most assured knowledge, and better
judgment, all which knew him a great deal better then I, being able to give
the world and you more full and absolute satisfaction; together with the
multitude and diverse sorts of Religious, wise, grave, juditious, learned,
Critticke, and curious censurers; all who, if it should happen but once to
peep into the world, for the welbeloved subject thereof, would gredily
entertane and welcome the same with their diverse humors, and piercing
judgments. These, and many more, with the conscience of my unworthines, and
insufficiency to perform so high a task, (which rather would become some
Homer, Virgil, Demosthenes, Cicero, or rather some one in whom all their
excellencies are combined, to perform aright) like mountains appeared at
first in my way; yet because (as one says) In magnis voluisse sat est, rather
then it should not be done at all, and with the loss, the remembrance also
perish, how and in what manner we lost so brave a Prince. Sometime the
expectation of the world, and that it might for ever be known unto it, and you
both, how exceeding great this last duty is, which I owe to the dead, as also
how absolutely you may command him, whom your love long since has strictly
bound to be perpetually yours, in place of a better, I have adventured upon
these ensuing conditions, to lanch out my frail bark, into that great Ocean
of sorrow, even from the cradle to the grave, whence storme-beaten as you see,
I have with much ado recovered my desired haven. First, that whatsoever
distaste you find therein of any thing, you would not impute it to any
presumption of mine, but rather to my frailty and ignorance, which (rather then
to offend you) I have herein bewrayed: Next, that whatsoever is here written of
his late Highness, not content herewith, you would only use the same as a
Ladder to mount up your thoughts to a far more excellent meditation of his
virtues; further also that you would not be too busy upon this report to
censure any of your Physicians, or any other; al whom, I protest, I have
endeavored to please, without partiality, so far, as in my judgment, the
truth would suffer me, rather imputing the blame unto my relation, then any of
their actions. As also, that with your accustomed patience, you would delay to
censure me for this letter, until with mature judgment you have thoroughly
perused the same, considering how much more easy it is to censure others, then
to do well our selves. Again, that since the way by which I must pass, is
through a long, dark, silent, solitary, untroden path, leading even to the
chambers of death, fraught altogether with sorrow, ending in tears, wherein I
cannot choose (but by the excess thereof) many times fall, stumble, and miss
of my way, you would with your gentle excuses reach out your hand of love to
help me up again, rather expecting what is intended, then done* Lastly, that
you, with my other discreet Reader, who hereafter shall see the same, would
only use it as a Hunters bait, to stay your stomachs a little, until some
others of better knowledge, and sounder judgment, do feed you with a better
dinner.

KNow then that the Kings Majesty and the Queen lying at the Castle of
Striveling, (a place famous for Antiquity, fair for Building, pleasant for
Situation) on Tuesday the 19. of February 1594. about 3. a clock in the
morning, his Highness was born, to the great joy of all the whole Isle, and
all foreign true hearted Princes and people, his Majesty's well-willers, and
Confederats, but chiefly the Phaenix of her age, great matchless Elizabeth, to
show the exceeding love to his Majesty, did not only ^end, the Right
Honorable the Earl of Sussex, with rich presents to the Christing, but also
by him, and for Her, did give unto his Highness the Name of HENRY, most
renowned and Victorious; after which by special appointment from his Majesty,
he was resigned to the custody and keeping of the Earl of Mar, assisted also
by the continual and vigilant care of the venerable and noble Matron his
Mother, unto whom the chief charge of his Highness person, by his Majesty was
given, She also for many years before, being his own great happy Nurse, with
whom he no less prospered in all things, then his Royal Father before him did
in the self same place, and keeping. Thus continued the strength of his
Father, and the glory of his Mother a great while in the hands of women, giving
in this his tender age, by his wonderful courage, infallible tokens of a Noble
and Heroic Spirit, no music being so pleasant in his ears, as the sounding
of the Trumpet, the beating of the Drum, the roaring of the Canon, no sight
so acceptable, as that of Pieces, Pistols, or any sort of Armor; all which
evidently show, that (if he had lived) Mars himself would not one day have
dared to look him in the face.

Thus he remained until the 5. or 6. years of his Age, at which time his
Majesty thought it expedient he should no longer want a Tutor. Whereupon
Master Newton (afterward his Secretary) was by his Majesty thought fittest for
the said place, who presently with all care possible did begin to teach his
Highness the grounds of Learning, with the Introductions leading to the same.

A little after, the Women being put from about his Highness, diverse of good
sort were appointed to attend upon his Person; amongst whom, as chief, was the
Right Honorable the Earl of Mar, together with Sir David Murray Knight,
first and only Gentleman of his Highness Bedchamber, to lie therein,
(continuing so always until his death) assisted also by sundry Lords, Barons,
Knights, and Gentlemen: at which time, in the 7. 8. and 9. years of his Age,
leaving those Childish and idle toys, usual to all of his years, he began to
delight in more active, and manly exercises, learning to Ride, Sing, Dance,
Leap, shoot a Archery, and in Pieces, to toss his Pike* etc. Whereof all
these things in young years, to the admiration of all, chiefly strangers, he
did wonderfully perform* and that with such a grace, as it seemed incredible
to foreign Nations; save that those of their own, who were spectators of the
same did assure them thereof.

Now began those sparks of Piety, Majesty, Gravity, etc. which before were
true, though small, to flash out biger every day, using a mild and gentle
behavior toward all, chiefly to strangers, before whom he used (if they were
of good sorts, and Nobles) to show these exerci^es, wherein he excelled all
those of his age, thereby filling their hearts with love, and all their senses
with delight, departing exceeding well pleased, that they had seen Prince
Henry.

Mean while swift winged Time, the mother of Change (whilst we expected no
such alteration) joining with the Eternal Decree, which pitying that
Elizabeth, now overcloyed with earthly ^oyes should any longer be detained in
^his vale of Misery, did send the blessed Angels to change her corruptible for
an incorruptible Crown. The News whereof (in a shorter time then ever was
^oasted so great a Journey) was brought into his Majesty by the Honorable Sir
To. Carey Knight, who out of the abundance of his love, preventing all others,
was the first Newes-bringer, not only of so lamentable death, but also of the
sudden ensuing joy, of his Majesty's Right, Lawful, Lineall, Proclaimed
Succession: who shortly after was se^onded by honorable Gentlemen, Sir Charles
Percie, and Sir Thomas Somersett Knights, with a Letter from the Right
Honorable, the Peers of England, and Lords of Her late Majesty's most
Honorable Privy Counsel, presenting ^eapes of all sorts of dutiful services,
from so loving Subjects to so beloved a King; withal wishing a hasty dispatch
of his Majesty's Affairs, that they the sooner might enjoy His Royal
presence, which being with speed performed, they also (out of their great love)
longing for the rest. The Queen with his Highness took their Journey from
Edenborough the first of June, 1602. the last of the said Month coming to
Windsor, where, what joy was at so loving a meeting, and so long wished, I
leave for you to imagine.

His Majesty lying at this foresaid Town, his Highness and some other Lords,
were installed Knights of the most Honorable and Noble Order of the Garter;
after which (the Sickness increasing) His Highness removed from thence to
Oatelands, where by appointment from his Majesty, he took house by himself,
having so many to attend upon him in every Office, as was thought fitting for
his years. A little after removing to Nonsuch, and from thence being sent for
to Winchester by his Majesty, he again returned to Oatelands, where he begun
to ply his Book hard for two or three years, continuing all his Princely
Sports, Hawking, Hunting, running at the Ring, Leaping, riding of great Horses,
Dancing, Fencing, tossing of the Pike, etc. In all which, he did so far
excel as was fitting for so great a Prince; whereby, together with his
continual travail, being ever in action, he came to have a very active and
strong body; so that then he would many times tire all his followers before he
himself would be weary.

Much about this time, being thirteen years of age, he began to know himself
a little better, and finding himself to be a Prince indeed, began not only
to strive for virtues answerable, but also to chase away the relics of
childish imperfections natural to all, increasing every day in favor with God
and man.

In the 14. and 15. years of his age, he began to be very juditious, almost in
every thing, drawing nearer to a Majestique gravity; to be a reverent and
attentive hearer of Sermons, to give commendations to the same, to have Boxes
kept at his three several standing Houses, Saint-Iames, Richmond, and Nonsuch,
causing all those who did swear in his hearing, to pay moneys to the same,
which were after duly given to the poor; he began now also to be of an
excellent discourse, putting forth, and asking strange Questions and
Suppositions, both of this, and foreign States, and desiring to know, and to
be resolved almost of every thing, whereby at length he attained to have a
reasonable insight and judgment, in State-affaires; now also delighting to
shoot in great and small Fieldpieces, to level them to the white, and see
them shot off.

The 16. year of his Age, being to come to the time of his Investment in the
Principality of Wales and Cornwall; He did advance his own Title and Right
so far, as with modesty he might: which presently was gently and lovingly
entertained, and granted of his Majesty, with the consent of the Right
Honorable, the High Court of Parliament: The fourth of June following, being
appointed for that solemn action, the Christmas before which, his Highness
not only for his own Recreation, but also that the World might know, what a
brave Prince they were likely to enjoy, under the Name of Meliades, Lord of the
Isles, (an ancient Title due to the first borne of Scotland) did in his Name,
by some appointed for the same of purpose, strangly attired, accompanied with
Drums and Trumpets in the Chamber of Presence, before the King and Queen,
and in the presence of the whole Court* delivered a Challenge to all Knights of
Great Britain, in two Speeches; the relation whereof were out of purpose, but
the sum was:

That Meliades, their Noble Master, boiling with an earnest desire, to try the
Valor of his young years in foraigne Countries, and to know where Virtue
triumphed most, had sent them abroad to espy the same, who after their long
Travailes in all Countries, and return; showing, how no where in any
Continent, save in the Fortunate Isle of Great Britain, they had found his
wishes; which ministering matter of exceeding joy to their young Meliades, who
(as they said) could lineally derive his Pedigree from the famous Knights of
this Isle, was the cause that he had now sent to present the first fruits of
his Chivalrie at his Majesty's feet. Then after, returning with a short speech
to her Majesty, next to the Earls, Lords, and Knights, excusing their Lord in
this their so sudden and short warning: and lastly, to the Ladies; they after
humble delivery of their Chartle, concerning time, place, conditions, number of
weapons, and Assailants, took their leave, departing solemnly as they entered.

Now began every where preparations to be made for this great fight, and happy
did he think himself who should be admitted for a Defendant, much more
Assailant: At last, to encounter his Highness, with his six Assailants, 58.
Defendants consisting of Earls, Barons, Knights, and Esquires, were appointed
and chosen, eight Defendants to one Assailant, every Assailant being to fight
by turns, eight several times fighting, two every time with push of Pike and
Sword, twelve strokes at a time; after which, the Bar for separation was to
be let down until a fresh onset.

The great night of this Solemnity now approaching, his Highness in his own
lodging, in the Christmas, did Feast the Earls, Barons, and Knights
assailants, and defendants, until the great Twelfth appointed night, on which
this great fight was to be performed; which being come, his Highness, to the
great wonder of the beholders, did admirably fight his part, giving and
receiving that night, 32. pushes of Pikes, and about 360. strokes of Swords,
which is scarce credible in so young years, enough to assure the World, that
Great Britains brave Henry aspired to immortality.

Against the morrow, after the same said fight, was also prepared a Magnificke
Feast at his Highness house at Saint James, at which his Majesty, his
Highness, his Brother and Sister, with all the other Earls, Lords, and
Knights of the Court were present; where after Supper (according as before they
had been judged) his Highness gave three prises, to the three best deserving,
viz. to the Right Honorable the Earl of Montgomery one, and to Sir Thomas
Darcy, and Sir Robert Gourdon Knights, the other two.

The Barriers finished, and prises won, judged and delivered, shortly after
began preparation every where to be made for his Highness Creation, every one
from the highest to the lowest (to show there exceeding love) striving who
should exceed in bravery, until fast-posting Time at length brought forth the
long wished for day; before which, his Highness then lying at Richmond, a
House situate on the Rivers side, seven miles from Westminster, the place of
his Creation, the custom being to be brought from such a place, the Right
Honorable the Lord Mayor of London, with the worshipful Aldermen his
Brethren, accompanied with thirty six several Companies of Citizens of diverse
callings, in so many several Barges, and all Citie-like braverie possible,
with their several Flagges, Banners, Colors, Arms, Trumpets, Drums, and
Phyfes, with other such provision, came from their mighty and renowned City, up
the silver-streamed River, to welcome, meet and accompany his Highness,
toward the solemn Action, where having encountered with his Highness Barges
with all the joy, love, and kindness possible, to the wonder of the World; all
eyes were bent toward so joyful and desired a sight: they came altogether
rowing down the proud River, which for two or three miles together, seemed to
be covered with Pinnaces, Barges Boats, and Oars unto White Hall bridge at
the Court, where he was also received, and welcomed by the Right Honorable
the Lords of his Majesty's most Honorable Privy Counsel, with diverse others,
and from thence by them conducted unto his Majesty, where he remained until
the time of his Creation, which being the next day, he was in presence of the
right Honorable the High Court of Parliament, Lords Spiritual and Temporal, By
his Majesty, the King his Father, Created Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall,
great Earl of Chester, etc. with a full Investment in all the Ancient and
great Liberties, ever possessed by any of his famous Predecessors, and with the
joy and approbation of the whole House.

His Highness being now absolute of himself, did take up House with a full
addition of high Officers, Sir Thomas Challener Chamberlain, Sir Charles
Cornwallis Treasurer, and Sir John Hollis Comptrouler of his House, making good
and strict Ordets through the same, both above and below stairs, more like a
grave wise, and ancient Counselor, surveying, disposing, and dispatching his
affairs, then so young and great a Prince: Now were allorted unto him certain
Lands for his revenewes, which he was so far from diminishing, that he left
the same increased, by thousands a year; his servants did now begin to look
which way to help themselves, since his Highness, was every day more and more
able to give: yet he being very sparing to give any thing, did only give
Grants unto some, with promises, hopes and delays unto others, because he
would not (he said) dispose of any thing, until with the gift he might
perpetrat the same, which could not be, until either years, or the High Court
of Parliament should enable him, but this time as yet not being come, he went
on his own frugall courses, suffering almost nothing to pass in his House, or
other affairs, which he himself did not oversee.

At last, bethinking himself that Wales and Cornwall, etc. his Principality
had a long time been without a Prince of their own, he thought he might the
rather show his Authority in renewing and avoiding Leases; wherefore having
first by a Writ called Scire facias, avoided and annihilated all their former
Rights and Leases, he brought them unto a general submission to compound,
take and hold new of him; which they were all ready to perform, a little
before his death: Whereupon Surveyors, and Commissioners were appointed, and
dispatched to survey all his Lands, and to return a true certificate of the
whole value; until which, (being but a little before his sickness and death)
he deferred all manner of Suits, because he would first be informed truly,
what, and how great their demands were.

In the 17. and 18. years of his Age he began not only to be a Man in
stature, but also in courage and wisdom, to the admiration of all, and with
the eyes of his Spirit surveying the mighty Inheritance whereunto he was Heir
apparent, he did also strain to be the better furnished (if ever his shoulders
should undergo so great a burden with furniture befitting the same, it being
wisdom, in the time of peace, to prepare for the same, knowing that Peace is
the harbinger of War, (chiefly in Ships, counted the brazen Wall of this
Isle) he in the time of our security thought thereof: and therefore did not
only entreat his Majesty to cause his Officers of the Navy to build him a
Ship, called the Prince, (then the fairest of this Isle) but also to advance
the affairs of the Navy, to his power, now and then got leave of his Majesty
to go in person to view the Ships, and Storehouses, which diverse times he did.
Not content herewith, he did also practice Tilting, charging on Horseback with
Pistols, after the manner of the Wars, with all other the like inventions. Now
also delighting to confer, both with his own, and other Strangers, and great
Captains, of all manner of Wars, Battles, Furniture, Arms by Sea and Land,
Disciplines, Orders, Marches, Alarmes, Watches, Stratagems, Ambuscadoes,
Approaches, Scalings, Fortifications, Incampings, and having now and then
Battles of head-men appointed both on Horse and Foot, in a long Table;
whereby he might in a manner, view the right ordering of a Battle, how every
troop did aid and assist another, as also the placing of the light Horsemen,
Vauntguard, Maine Battle, with the assisting wings, and Rerewards, etc. which
are out of my element to speak of. Neither did he omit, as he loved the
Theoricke of these things, to practice the same, entertaining in his House a
Dutch Captain, sent unto him by his Excellence (Grave Maurice) a most
excellent Ingineer, in all manner of things belonging to the Wars; causing
also, from time to time, new Pieces of Ornance to be made, learning to shoot,
and level them right to the white; No less provident was he to have great
Horses, and those of the best, which were sent unto him from all Countries; so
that, I may truly affirm, no Prince in Christendom did exceed him therein.
Thus, in these, and other worldly pleasures, which stoop for acquaintance unto
greatness, did he spend the years past.

In the 19. year of his Age, whether by his continual toil of body, and
mind, or some internal unknown causes (I know not) where before he was of
somewhat a full round face, and very pleasant disposition, his Visage began to
appear somewat paler, longer and thinner then before, he himself being also
more sad and retired then usual, yet without any complaint of him, or
jealousy of his Followers, save that some half a year after, he would now
and then complain of a small kind of giddy lumpish heaviness in his
forehead, the pain whereof, moved him (as I think) for the most part, ever
before he would put on his Hat, to stroke up with his hand his brow and
forehead; he did also use to bleed at the nose often, and in great quantity,
wherein he found great ease, until a little before his Sickness, (the
passages being stopped) this help, to his further grief, left him; he was now
subject to many strong and extraordinary qualmes, so that for danger and
celerity they were forced many times to fetch him again with strong waters,
which being only by intermission now and then, were let pass as they came,
without any suspicion of so sudden sorrows.

Much about the beginning of this Summer, there could almost be no news
heard, but of his Sisters marriage, of which many speeches went current,
according to the diverse affections of Protestants and Papists; some wishing her
to be married to the King of Spain, some to the Prince of Savoy, some to the
young Lands-grave, and some to his Highness the Palsgrave her now husband. But
he following the stream of his Fathers well settled affections, for great
Britains eternal felicity, and terror of all Papists, did only fancy the
Palsgraves motion, shortly after advancing the same by all means possible at
the coming of the Right honorable the Count Hannaw: the Palsgraves great
Ambassador, whose errand as the speech went, was to knit up this match, unto
whose suite his Highness did not only give way, and second the business, but
also in sign of love, entertain, and countenance the said Count (next unto
his Majesty) more then any, never resting until all was agreed (as thanks be
to God) it is now finished.

Matters now being at rest, the Duke of Bovillon, His frequent swimming
immediately: after supper, was most pernicious to his health: for it stopped his
bleeding at Nose, whereupon the blood putrefying, engendered that fatal Feber
which followed. Doctor ^^yerne.
and Count Hannaw having returned home again, his Higenesse removed to
Richmond, where he lay until the progress; the pleasure of the River running
close by the house, inviting him now and then to swim, which he endeavored
to learn in the evening, to the dislike of many, who did see him swim after
supper, his stomach being full, affirming it to be full of danger, and that it
was needless for him to adventure himself in the water; but no remedy, he
would needs continue the same, and did until his removing from thence. He did
now also delight many times to walk late at night by the Rivers side in Moon
light, to hear the Trumpets sound an echo, which many suspected, because the
Dew then falling did him small good.

But the time of the progress now approaching (when as he was commanded) he
must needs meet the King his Father at Beaver Castle in Notinghamshire the
second Saturday after the beginning of the same, which now drawing near, his
Highness neither considering the strength of his body, the greatness of the
journey (being near fourscore and sixteen miles) nor the extreme and
wonderful heat of the season, and notwithstanding my persuasions to the
contrary, determined to ride that great journey in 2. days, according to which
he set forth on friday by one of the clock in the morning from his house at
Richmond, coming to Finchingbrooke besides Huntington, a house pertaining to
Sir Oliver Cromwell Knight, Master of his game, by ten of the clock in the
morning, which as they say is threescore miles, in nine hours posting, where
he remained all that night, the next day having six and thirty miles to Beaver
Castle, where he meet with his Father just at the time prefixed.

But the time of one thing, I had almost forgot to tell you, how before his
coming from Richmond in intending to feast the Courtat his Manor of Woodstock
about the end of this progress (it being the first time of their general
meeting there, since the house became his) had given order to his Officers to
provide a most magnifique Feast against their coming to the foresaid house;
withal having ordained a great Summer House of green boughs to be built in
the park wherein the great supper should be, all which was with speed
performed: mean while, although the season was exceeding hot, his Highness
did ride many and extraordinary journeyes in the same (which as was thought)
did much incline his boiling blood toward inflammation.

At last, their journeis being toward an end, to Woodstock they came, where
his Highness (accordingly to his former intention) did feast the Lords and
Ladies at a long table, near which he himself did bear them company from
the Wednesday night of their coming, until the Sunday night, which (unknown
to him) he had appointed for the last great farewell unto all his friends; By
this time the appointed night for this great feast being come, his Highness
did himself in person come into the banqueting house, to see all things in
good order, for great was his care to give contentment.

At last, the King and Queen being set at a Table by themselves at the upper
end of the room, his Highness with his Sister accompanied with the Lords and
Ladies sitting at another Table of thirty yards long and more, by themselves,
there was to be seen one of the greatest and best ordered feasts as ever was
seen, nothing wanting which any way was fitting to adorn such a solemn
meeting; All which to the general joy of the whole Court; his Highness like
to a Princely Bridgrome cheering and welcomming his Guests, there appeared an
universal contentment in all; but little knew he that it was his last great
farewell to his Father, Mother, Sister, yea, unto the whole Court, that it was
his last Feast of Feasts, one for all. And indeed, when we look back unto the
same, therein beholding his Highness cheerful carriage, the Time, Order,
State, Magnificence, and Greatness thereof, we may behold somewhat Ominous
therein.

The Monday after, the Court removeing from thence, his Highness, after leave
obtained, hasted home again to Richmond, because of the News of the
Palsegraves approach, whom he intended to grace with all possible honor. Being
returned, he began to give order for every thing, and to dispatch all affairs
both of his own, and concerning the following intended Triumphs for his
Highness the Palsgraves better welcome; He now also of himself (I know not by
what motion) considering the great pains, deserts, and small means of a
number of his Followers, who had spent much, and gotten nothing in his Service,
did give order for a number of several pensions, according to his discretion,
to some of them, promising also, after a while (that none should be
discouraged) to remember the rest.

But now, whether the continual violences of his Exercises, or his too
frequent eating of abundance of Grapes, and other fruits, or some settled
Melancholy, engendered by some unknown causes, I cannot determine, yet did he
look still more pale and thin, from day to day, complaining now and then of
a cold, lasie drowsinesse in his head, which (as I think) moved him many times
to ask questions of diverse about him, concerning the quality, cure, and nature
of the Fever, (called for the strange diversity) The new Disease; belike,
fearing some such like thing by his indisposition; He also used before this,
now and then, and in his Sickness to sigh often, whereof being sometimes
demanded the cause by his Physicians, Doctor Hamond, and others near him, he
would sometimes reply, that he knew not, sometimes that they came unawares, and
sometimes also that they were not without cause.

At the beginning of October, his continual Headache, Laziness, and
indisposition increasing, (which notwithstanding because of the time, he strove
mightily to conceal) whereas often before, he used to rise early in the morning
to walk the fields, he did lie a bed, almost every morning until nine of the
clock, complaining of his laziness, and that he knew not the cause; during
which time (belike jealous of himself) he would many mornings before his
rising, ask of the Grooms of his Bedchamber, How do I look this morning?
and at other times the same question again; which they, fearing no danger, to
make his Highness laugh, would put off with one jest or other.

But he still continuing ill, the tenth of the foresaid Month, he had two
small fits of an Ague, forcing him to keep his Chamber, which his Highness
finding, had some speech with Doctor Hamond, his Physician, willing belike to
have taken some strong Physic, the sooner to have removed the cause. But he
not daring to be too bold with his Highness body, without a further consent,
did only give unto his Highness a softning Glister, which had its own good
effects, stirring the humors.

On the Morning, being Tuesday, the thirteen of October, he having (as was
thought) taken cold, had a great looseness, his belly opening 25. times,
avoiding a great deal of Choler, Phlegm, and putrified Matter toward the
end, yet for all this, on the morrow, he finding himself (as he said)
reasonable well, because of the Palsgraves coming, he hasted from thence to
Saint James, whereupon he gave order, and would needs remove on Thursday, the
thirteenth of the same month, notwithstanding any persuasions whatsoever to
the contrary, neither was it without great danger (as they all showed him) to
hazard himself abroad so soon, his Body being yet open: but he affirming
himself to be very well, would needs go on with his former determination.

At last to Saint James he came, seeming well, but that he looked pale and ill,
so that sundry did speak suspitiously of his looks, fearing some distemper in
his Body: yet so strong was his mind, that complaining of nothing, he did
bear out the matter very bravely in show, being so well, that he gave his
Physician (who had waited a long time) leave to go home to his house; mean
while his indisposition still continuing and increasing, there might have been
perceived in him a sudden great change, for he began to be displeased almost
with every thing, and to be exceeding curious in all things, yet not regarding,
but looking, as it were, with the eyes of a stranger upon them, for sundry
things showed him^ which before he had wonted to talk of, ask questions, and
view curiously, he now scarce vouchsafed to look upon, turning them away with
the back of his hand, and departing, as who would say, I take pleasure in
nothing; yet was he wonderfully busy in providing, and giving order for every
thing belonging to his care, for his Sisters Marriage, advancing the same by
all means possible, keeping also his Highness the Palsgrave company, so much as
conveniently he could, together with Count Henry his Excellency, Grave Maurice
his Brother, whom he also much honored and esteemed, belike because of a Noble
and Heroicke disposition, which he saw in him, fitting his humor, with whom he
used to play often at Cards, and Tenis, delighting much in his company, and
above all the rest, one great Match they had at Tenis, on Saturday the 24. of
October, the day before his last Sickness, where his undaunted courage,
negligently, carelessly, and wilfully (neither considering the former weak
estate of his body, danger, nor coldness of the season) as though his body had
been of brass, did play in his shirt, as if it had been in the heat of
Summer; during which time, he looked so wonderful ill and pale, that all the
beholders took notice thereof, muttering to one another what they feared: But
he (the match being ended) carried himself so well, as if there were no such
matter, having all this while a reasonable good stomach to meat; yet this night
at his going to bed, complaining more then usual of his laziness and
headache.

But oh whether go I now? must I again launch out into a Sea of sorrows,
adding more griefs unto our yet bleeding wounds? Oh death! was there no
remedy? when will thou make an end? shall the grave devour always? was thy
charge so strait that thou could shoot neither at great nor small, but at
the Prince of our Israel? do sweet smelling flowers so much delight thy
grisly ghastly senses appetite, that thou would gather none but our fairest
well beloved, scarce blown, rose? why did thou so soon rob us? I know
(but that thou, who scornest to reason with thy captives, disdainest to answer
thy slaves) thou could give us many reasons: Wherefore I leave to reason with
thee, and turning again to my doleful Relation, will begin, etc.

Quanquam animus meminisse horret, luctusque refugit For

-- Quis talia fando
Temperet a lacrimis? etc. --
On Sunday morning the five and twenty of October 1612. the morrow after his
Highness violent play at Tennies, it was told him (the custom of his house
being to have the Sermon betimes in the morning, for the most part, where the
Court lay so near; because he used after his own, to hear the Kings also)
that Master Wilkinson one of his Fathers Chaplains, was ready, and did present
his service to preach that morning (if it pleased his Highness to hear him)
which he no sooner heard, but contrary to his late usual custom of long time
(although that morning he found himself somewhat drousie and ill) addressed
himself to be made ready, for he wonderfully delighted to hear the said
Master Wilkinson; ever since the time (long before) in which he heard him
preach a Sermon of judgment, which he did so well like of, that many times
he did speak of the same, affirming it to have been so excellent, that he
in a manner did show them the same, long it was not ere his Highness was ready
and gone to the Chapel to hear him.

But ere I proceed, give me leave I entreat you, to admire the wonderful
providence and goodness of God, which did so provide for him a Sermon of
Mortification, or Preparation, which you will: For the time, text, powerful
delivery, Method etc. were also fitting to our following unthought of Funeral,
as though an Angel had come the whole week before from Heaven, prefixing unto
him the time, necessity, text, order, and amplifications thereof, so truly did
he thunder out the mortal misery of mankind, but chiefly of Princes: The
Text was out of Job the 14. and 1. verse, Man that is borne of a Woman, is of
short continuance and full of trouble. From which he showed 3. things; first,
our miserable entry into the World, and short continuance; lastly, our
miserable Pilgrimage, and endurance in the World full of trouble; in which the
misery and troubles of all Estates were well showed, but chiefly those of
great ones. Sermon being ended, his Highness did commend the same, being very
attentive all the time thereof; presently thereafter going into Whitehall,
where he also did hear another Sermon with the King his Father; which being
also done, to dinner they went, his Highness in outward appearance eating with
a reasonable good stomach, yet looking exceeding ill and pale, with hollow
ghastly dead eyes perceived of a great many.

The first Day.
After dinner, for all his great courage and strife to over master the
greatness of his evil, dissembling the same, the Conqueror of all, about 3.
a clock in the afternone began to skirmish, with a sudden sickness and
faintenesse of the heart (usual unto him) whereupon followed shortly after a
shaking, with a great heat and headache, which from hence forth never left him;
his Highness finding himself thus suddenly taken, was forced to take his
leave, departing home unto his bed; where being laid, he found himself very
ill, remaining all this evening in an Agony, having a great drought (which
after this could never be quenched but with death) his eyes also being so
dim, that they were not able to endure the light of a candle; for which that
night was ordained unto him a cordial of cooling Ptisan for quenching of his
thirst, with a moistning broth to be given at the ending of the fit. This
night he rested ill.

The second Day.
On the morrow after, being Monday the six and twenty of the Month, and the
second of his sickness; his Highness felt small or no ease of his headache,
continuing bound in his belly, his pulse beating exceedingly, his water being
crude, thin, and whitish, which moved Doctor Mayerne his Majesty's chief
Physician to appoint for him a softning Glister, which accordingly to their
desire did work very well. After which his Highness finding intermission
(which continued all that day) did arise, and put on his clothes, playing at
cards that day, and the next also, with his Brother the Duke of York, and
Count Henry; mean while there were many Messages sent from the Court, and
every where else, to know how things went, all which (no creature surmising the
least danger) were answered with good hopes, yet his Highness for all this
looked ill and pale, spoke hollow, and somewhat straingely, with dead sunck
eyes, his dryness of Mouth and great thirst continuing, for the which that
night were ordained unto him by the foresaid Doctors, sharp, tarte, cordial
and cooling Iuleps, prepared with all kind of Cordials and Anditotes possible,
his brothes and gellies being with the same care ordained: yet his drought and
headache continuing (which could not be stayed) he remained still very ill,
this night resting quietly.

The third Day.
On Tuesday the seven and twenty, the third day of his sickness, he found
some ease in the morning, so that they were all in good hope that it would have
proved but some Tertian, or bastard Tertian at the most, notwithstanding that
his Highness, ghastly rolling uncouth looks, did put them in some fear.

This day, his Majesty did send Master Nasmith his Surgeon to attend his
Highness during his sickness, unto whom, and diverse others conferring of his
Highness sickness, and the danger of the same; Doctor Mayerne did say, that
in his judgment the surest way for his Highness safety was bleeding (as was
thought) very substantially proving from the very dangerous forenamed actidents
and indications of this Tertian, which he feared to be venomous, by reason
humors seated in the natural parts, inclining by reason of the quantity, to a
continual; that bleeding chiefly, and that in great quantity with reiteration
(if need so required:) Now whilst his Highness was strong, natural heat not
being decayed, nor too much opressed, before that Fever turned continual, and
he weaker, and less able to endure hereafter, would prove the surest way for
his safety. But the same his opinion, not being allowed of the rest (whom by
conference, when he named, or spoke of blood) he found directly opposite* there
was as yet no consultation for blood letting, nor any inclination that ways.

This morning he did rise and put on his clothes, but his fit coming about
noone; first with a cold, then a great heat, without any sweat, continuing
until eight a clock at night, he was forced to go to bed again, this night
resting quietly.

The fourth Day.
On Wednesday the eight and twentieth, and fourth day of his sickness, in the
morning, came Master Butler, the famous Physician of Cambridge, a marveilous
great Scholar, and of long Practice, and singular judgment, but withal very
humerous; who (whatsoever he thought) comforting him with good hopes, that he
would shortly recover, and that there was no danger; yet secretly unto others,
did not let to speak doubtfully, (as they say, his humor is) that he could
not tell, what to make of it, and that he did not well like of the same; adding
further, that if he did recover, he was likely to lie by it for a great while,
with diverse other like speeches, neither could he be persuaded, all the time of
his Highness sickness, to stay any longer with him, then one hour, or
thereabouts, every morning, and so in the afternoon, to give his counsel and
advise with the rest: what moved him I know not, whether he did mislike the
French Doctors company, or because the Cure was not committed to him as chief,
or being jealous, and misliking his Highness disease, and therefore loved not
to meddle to much in the Cure (which I rather imagine;) or whether his health
or humor impeached the same, I dare not judge; the curious may best learn from
himself, yet having at his coming enquired what was done, he approved the
same, and wished the continuance of the same proceedings, until a further
judgment might be given of the same event: yet did his Highness find small
or no ease, but his Fever, as yet not being continual, he did rise and put on
his clothes, they all as yet conceiving reasonable good hopes.

The former days and this, his stomach was not quite lost, but he would now
and then take some such meat as the Physicians thought fitting; yet the
Doctors, viz. Mayerne, Hamond, Butler, all considering the greatness of the
danger, and the strangeness of the Disease, the Water in no way showing the
same, which made them the loather to meddle, until the Crisis were seen, his
Highness remaining in the same estate, the many dangerous forenamed accidents,
with the good of the former evacuations, his belly now being hard bound, etc.
would willingly have had more Doctors called for consultation; which his
Highness altogether refusing to allow of, because of the confusion. They by a
general consent (his Highness then having intermission of his Fever) under
all their hands, did by their own report, give unto him a Purgation of Seen
sod, and Rhubard, infused in Cordial and cooling Liquors, with Syrup of Roses
loosing, which working seven or eight times, brought away great store of putred
Choler, and in the end Phlegm, the Urine inclining somewhat toward concoction.
But his Highness after the working thereof, found not that ease that was
expected; yet was still fed with hopes of his recovery. But night being come,
(toward which, during all his sickness, he grew worse then in the morning,
wherein he was more sober always then in the evening) his Headache, droughts
and other accidents, continuing, though not with extremity, he rested ill, and
unquietly.

The fifth day.
On the Thursday the nine and twentieth, and fifth day of his sickness, hopes
began a little to diminish, howbeit that morning his headache was somewhat
lessened, his breath also (which before was short) being longer, which moved
him to put on his clothes, endeavoring to rise as he had done before; but his
head being so giddy, that he was not able to stand alone, he was forced to
betake him to his bed again, from henceforth ever keeping his bed:
Nevertheless the tingling of his ears, the leapings and boundings continuing
alike; as also a small fit coming upon him, with a little coldness, the Fever
thereafter being continual, with many small intermissions, and small and great
redoublings, the violence whereof caused his tongue to become black and dry,
the leapings, and boundings, and singing of the ears increasing. Many near
unto him, jealous of so bad signs without amendment, feared the worst, his
Highness now being forced to keep his bed continually, his head being so
giddy, that he could not stand upright, his eyes also so dim, that he could
not endure the candle light; yet still the Doctors, by reason of his
extraordinary patience (not fully knowing the danger which afterward appeared)
not willing nor daring to be too bold, until some certain further knowledge,
delaied to conclude of any thing, save that his Highness should still be plied
with all sorts of Cordial Iuleps, which Art, or experience could think of.
Master Butlers advise, they say, was the same, that Cordials external, and
internal, the restoratives and diet begun, should be continued.

Thus, no other course as yet being thought of, still expecting the success of
new days; delays bred danger, his Highness remained ill, having no
evacuation by sweat, neither was it expedient (as was thought) to force the
same, still expecting Natures own time, which deceived them.

This evening there appeared a fatal sign about two hours or more within the
night, A Lunar Rainbow very rare, and commonly fatal.
bearing the colors and show of a Rainbow, which hung directly cross and over
Saint Jameses House, V. Arist. Metor.
it was first perceived about seven a clock at night, which I my self did see,
which diverse others looking thereupon with admiration, continuing until past
bed time, being no more seen. This night was unquiet, and he rested ill.

The sixth Day.
On Friday the six and thirtieth day of his sickness, he remained in the same
estate, no Creature knowing what to say or make of his sickness, some fearing
one thing, and some another, the Doctors still attending the issue of the eight
day, but for all that his Highness fever remained continual, withal the
former cruel accidents, for which this morning was given him a Glister for
washing of his bowels, in which he found some ease.

About three a Clock in the afternone came his lesser Doubling, during which,
his breath became short, his face very red, his pulse beating very swiftly; in
which fit his nose began to bleed (as some thought about two ounces, then after
staying of it self, whereby he found some ease, not having bleed (as his
custom was) of a great while before.

From this time forth, chiefly Doctor Mayerne, with Master Nasmith, his
Majesty's Surgeon, began to propound the necessity of bleeding, as
heretofore they had done, whereunto nature now invited, the Fever remaining
continual, with a great abounding fullness, in a constitution excessively hot,
in a body which had much used bleeding, deprived of that benefit for some
Months before, yet the rest being sparing and loath to hear of the same,
there was nothing done, this day also passing as the rest; All this while the
excessive pain of his head continuing, as also his heat and thirst, for which
his mouth and tongue were continually washed; yet for all this his Highness
and the rest were still encouraged, that he should shortly recover, although
indeed he became still worse and worse. This night he rested ill, being
always somewhat better in the morning.

The seventh Day.
On Saturday the last of the Month, and seventh of his sickness, there
appeared no amendment, his Highness continuing in a wonderful excessive heat,
after which came the great redoubling, raving as he was awake, with
blackness, drines, and clifts in his tongue, was continually applied with all
things needful, but to no purpose, save a little ease for the present, as also
the tingling of the ears, leapings and boundings became greater, the vrines
more crude, yet no way showing the danger of the disease all this while, until
a little before his death; Over and above all other griefs he found his head
exceedingly pained, a thing lying as it had been a lump in his forehead,
which together with the ulceration of his throat, made him loath to speak, but
when he must needs, and then not without great pain, the extremity, as it
were, of the evil overcomming and stupifying the vitals and senses, striving
to subdue natural heat, and oppressing the heart, notwithstanding the doubling
and trebling of the Cordials to withstand the same.

This day also, Nature (as the day before) though not in quantity, did (as was
said) show the necessity of bleeding, for which cause it was with more instance
again propounded, and urged, then ever, as the only means, under God, to
save his Highness; at length after much ado pro and contra, Doctor Mayerne
urging, and Master Butler chiefly withstanding the same, mistaking the first
beginning of his Highness sickness; in the end, the three Doctors, Mayerne,
Hamond, and Butler did agree, that on the morrow being Sunday (the eight
broken, and the seventh whole day of his last sickness) a vain should be
opened; all this while until his bleeding was past, they conceived good hope
of his recovery, yet he remained dangerously ill; you must imagine that all
this while of his sickness, the whole World did almost every hour send unto
Saint Jameses for news; the better sort who were admitted to visit him; or
acquainted with those near unto him, knowing the danger, the rest fearing
nothing, imagining it only to have been some Common Tertian, for which cause
in many places near unto the City he was thought dead and gone, before they
knew that he was dangerously sick. This night was more cruel and unquiet unto
him then any other.

The eight Day.
On Sunday the first of November, and the eight day of his sickness, according
to their former agreement, after much ado, Master Butler resisting to consent
that he should be let blood, because (as he said) it was the eight day,
profering to have left them, until he was forced to stay and give his
consent; Doctor Hamond and others proving unto him, that it was not the eight
day, his Highness being ill of a long time before, (howsoever he strangly
with a wonderful courage and patience concealed the same;) his Highness being
still after one, in the presence of the foresaid Doctors and diverse others of
very good worth, in the morning was drawn out of the Median of his right Arm,
seven or eight ounces of blood, during which time he fainted not, bleeding
well and abundantly, desiring and calling to them to take more as they were
about to stop the same, finding some ease as it were upon the instant; The
blood being cold, was seen of all to be thin, corrupt and putred, with a
choleric and bluish water above, without any Fibers or small strings therein
scarce congealed.

This day after his bleeding he found great ease, insomuch as since the
beginning of his sickness, he had not found himself so well, his pulse
inclining toward a more Gentle motion missing his former wonted cruel
doublings, and his former accidents being less and more mild. This afternoon
he was visited by his Royal Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, the Palsgrave,
with diverse others of the Court, all which conceiving good hopes, departed from
thence reasonably cheerful. Yet that night (though better then others) he
passed unquietly.

The ninth Day.
On Monday the second of November, and ninth of his sickness, he became worse
then ever, the great redoubling coming upon him, accompanied with redness of
face, shortness of breath, increase of drought, blackness of his tongue, with
excessive heat, somewhat less then it was the seventh day, and benumbings,
which now with the increase of all the former accidents tormented him;
briefly, so many evil signs appeared, that some of the Doctors then plainly
affirmed, that by violence of the disease, the blood and humors were retired
in abundance, with great violence toward the brain, filling the veins
abundantly (as afterward in the opening did appear) by reason whereof the
pain of his head was extreme great, his Spirits being as it were overcome.

This morning, Doctor Atknis (a Physician of London, famous for his practice,
honesty, and learning) was sent by his Majesty to assist the rest in the cure;
whose opinion (as they said) was, that his Highness disease was a corrupt
putred Fever, the seat whereof was under the liver in the first passages, the
malignity whereof, he thought, by reason of the putrefaction (in almost the
highest degree) was venomous.

This day and the next, he was visited by the King his Father, and others of
the Court, whose exceeding sorrow I cannot express, yet were they still fed
with some good small hopes of his recovery. All this while, although he grew
every day worse and worse, yet none discouraged him with any speech of death
(so loath they were to think of his departure) he himself being so tormented
with this, and the next days sickness, that he could not think thereof; or
if he had, yet the Physicians courage, and hope of life, which good opinion
(his unspeakable patience not any way complaining, so that he could not have
been known to be sick, but by his looks) moved them to conceive, telling
him there was no danger, dashed the same.

This night came upon him greater alieanation of brain, ravings, and idle
speeches out of purpose, calling for his Clothes, and his Rapier, etc. saying,
he must be gone, he would not stay, and I know not what else, to the great
grief of all that heard him, whose hopes now began to vanish.

The tenth day.
On Tewsday the third of the Month, and the tenth of his Sickness, he became
worse then before, all his former accidents increasing exceedingly, his
boundings, being turned into Convulsions, his raving and benumming, becoming
greater, the Fever more violent; whereupon bleeding was again proposed by
Doctor Mayern and the Favorers thereof, who still affirmed, that he did mislike
the too sparing proceeding with his Highness; aleaging, that in this case of
extremity, they must (if they mean to save his life) proceed in the Cure, as
though it were to some mean person, forgetting him to be a Prince, whom they
had now in hand, otherwise he said, (for ought he saw) because he was a Prince
he must die, but if he were a mean person, he might be saved. But this his
opinion being disallowed of most, they continued and increased their Cordials,
giving unto him a Glister, which brought away abundance of corrupt and putred
matter, together with some Raysons, which (as was thought) he had eaten twelve
days before.

This day also for easing of the extreme pain of his head, the hair was
shaven away, and Pigeons and cupping Glasses applied to lessen and draw away
the humor, and that superfluous blood from the Head, which he endured with
wonderful and admirable patience, as though he had been insensible of pain;
yet all without any good, save perhaps, some small seeming hope of comfort for
the present.

Now began the Pilots, who guided this frail Barque of his highness body,
almost to despair, to escape the ensuing Tempests; some of whose looks did
now more then ever discourage the rest. For this night he became very weak,
the Fever augmenting, the raving becoming worse then ever, in which he began
to toss and tumble, to sing in his sleep, profering to have leaped out of the
bed, gathering the sheets together, the convulsions being more violent; In
which extremity, his tongue, mouth, and throat being more dry then ever, yet
called he not for any kind of moisture, complaining of thirst, which evidently
showed, that the vehemency of his disease had overcome the seat of reason,
otherwise he could not but have complained, as he did before.

The eleventh day.
On Wednesday the fourth of November, and the eleventh day of his Sickness,
all hopes of recovery were less then ever, the Physicians, Surgeons, and
Apothecaries beginning to be dismayed, but that like sout Pilots, they did
bear it out bravely, so long as was possible; yet (as men perplexed in such an
extremity) the most part were of opinion, that the Crisis was to be seen,
before a final resolution, of which there was as yet small appearance: all the
former accidents mean while increased, the whole world beginning to be
afraid. This day a Cock was cloven by the back, and applied unto the soles
of his feet, but in vain; the Cordials also were redoubled in number and
quantity, but without any profit.

This afternoon his Majesty hearing of his undoubted danger (although more
sober then at other times) came to see him; but being advertised how matters
went, and were likely to go, and what addition of grief it would be unto him,
to see his best beloved Son in that extremity, he was at last persuaded to
depart without Visitation, yet giving order and command before his departure,
that from thenceforth (because his Highness was continually molested with a
number, which out of their love came to visit him) no creature should be
admitted to see him, save those who of necessity must tend upon him, until
the event and issue of his Disease were seen, which was accordingly done; His
Highness for his more ease, being removed into another longer and quieter Just
over this Chamber (wherein he dyed) did the end of the fatal Rainebow,
aforementioned, hang (as Doctor Mayerne observed.)
Chamber. But now all things appearing to be out of frame, and confusedly
evil, without hope of amendment, whereof the Archbishop of Canterbury hearing,
he made so much the more haste unto his Highness, whom after some discourse
fitting that time, seeing so much care to be taken for the mortal body, the
immortal Soul being Notwithstanding the Prince was seriously remembered, to
commend himself into the hands of God, (before this) by Doctor Mayerne, who
found his resolution therein, to be most heavenly and Divive.
neglected; He asked his Highness, whether there had been any Prayers said in
his Chamber, since his Sickness, or no? To whom he answered, that there had
not: aleaging the cause to have been, the continual toil of the Doctors,
Apothecaries, and Surgeons about him; and further, that until now, he was not
put in mind thereof. But that, for all that, he had not failed to pray quietly
by himself, which his answer pleasing them well; the Archbishop again
demanded, if his Highness would now from thence forth be contented to have
prayers said in his Chamber, which he willingly assented unto, asking which of
his Chaplains were there present; amongst whom, finding that Doctor Milborne
Deane of Rochester was there present, he willed the said Deane to be called,
as being one, whom for his learning, good carriage, and profitable preaching,
above all the rest he ever affected and respected.

The Archbishop mean while not willing to much to disquet his Highness,
called for to say prayers that evening at his Highness bed side, where
speaking somewhat low, fearing to offend his distempered ears, his Highness
willed him to speak aloud, thereafter repeating the confession of his faith
word by word after him; from henceforth the foresaid Deane continued to pray
daily with him at his bed side until his departure. This night was unquiet as
the rest.

The twelfth Day.
On Thursday morning the fifth of November, and twelfth of his sickness, news
was sent unto his Majesty of the undoubted danger, and that there now remained
no hopes or means of his Highness recovery, but with desperate and dangerous
attempts, which his Majesty considering, gave leave and absolute power to
Doctor Mayerne (his chief Physician) to do what he would of himself,
without advise of the rest, if in such an extremity it were possible to do any
thing for his Highness safety; But he weighing the greatness of the cure and
emminency of the danger, would not for all that adventure, to do any thing of
himself, without advise of the rest (which he always took) saying, that it
should never be said in after Ages, that he had killed the Kings eldest
Son; His Majesty mean while (whose sorrow no tongue can express) not
willing, nor being able to stay so near the Gates of so extreme sorrow, more
like a dead, then a living man, full of most wonderful heaviness, removed ^^o
Theobalds (a house twelve miles from London) there to expect the doleful event.

Mean while amongst the Doctors Mayerne, Hamond, Butler, and Atkins, bleeding
was now the third time proposed, some of them (as I think Doctor Mayerne)
affirming, that the blood, which the vapors being violently thrust upwards,
filling the brain, did cause by the malign acrimony and quantity thereof,
ravings and convulsions; which accidents (although without seeming pain)
because the Spirits were oppressed) did put his Highness in imminent danger,
more then the benumings, the cause whereof was within the ventricles of the
brain, as also the said hot and choleric blood in the membranes; All which
considered and that his Highness was yet of sufficient strength of body, his
pulse also able to endure, they said, the opening of a vain was in their
judgment the only means left: But the rest of the Counsel misliking this
advise did conclude to double and treble the Cordials, making a revulsion from
the head with a clister, whose working was to small effect, save that his
Highness became more sensible thereafter: In the mean time the Archbishop of
Canterbury hearing of the danger, came unto his Highness in great have, where
finding him in extreme danger, he thought it now more then high time to go
about another kind of cure; and therefore, like a wise and skillful Physician,
first trying the humor of his patient, before he^ would proceed in the cure,
he addressed himself gently and mildly to ask how his Highness found
himself since his departure; at whose reply, seeing every thing amiss, he
began again furthe^ to feel his mind, first preparing him his Antidote
against the fear of death* that the preparation thereunto, meditation, and
thinking thereof, could, no^ would bring death the sooner, but the contrary
rather, arming himself so much the more against it; withal putting him in
mind of the Excellency and Immortality of the Soul, with the unspeakeable
joys prepared for Gods ^hildren; and the baseness and misery of the earth,
with all the vain, inconstant, momentary and frail pleasures thereof, in
respect of heavenly Joys; with many other most excellent meditations against
the same fear of death.

Having thus prepared him to hear, he went further, putting him in mind of
the Exceeding great danger he was in, and that although he might recover (as
he hoped he should) yet he might also die; and that since it was an
inevitable and irrevocable necessity that All must once die, late or soon.
(Death being the reward of sin) he asked, if it should so fall out, whether
or no he was well pleased to submit himself to the Will of God; to which he
answered, yea withal his heart. Then the Archbishop went on demanding
questions of his faith; First of the Religion and Church wherein he lived;
which his Highness acknowledged to be the only true Church, wherein only,
and without which there was no salvation* Then of his faith in Christ only, by
him, and in him, without any merits of his own, being assured of the Remission
of all his sins; which he professed he did, hoping and trusting only
therein; Then of the Resurrection of the body, life everlasting, and the joys
of Heaven* All which he confessed and believed, hoping withal Saints to enjoy
the same.

This conference, with a great deals more, the Archbishop had with him to this
purpose; (which may also give unto you absolute satisfaction of his Souls
health* if thereunto his life be considered.) After which, fearing he should
too much disquiet him, with many good exhortations, he took leave for that
time.

This day being the fifth of November* a day of everlasting remembrance and
thanksgiving for our deliverance from the Powder Treason, was order given every
where unto all Churches, to pray for his Highness, until when, the great
danger was unknown to the Commons, which was effectually as ever until his
death performed.

This day, and at sundry other times since his confusion of speech, he would
many times call upon Sir David Murray Knight (the only man in whom he had put
choice trust) by his name David, David, David, who when he came unto his
Highness, demanding his pleasure, in extremity of pain, and stupefaction of
senses confounding his speech, sighing, he did reply, I would say somewhat,
but I cannot utter it; which form he still used, so long as he had any
perfect sense or memory.

This done, also (but too late) to assist the rest, came Doctor Palmer, and
Doctor Gifford famous Physicians for their honesty, learning, and Physic, who
with the former four went all six to a consultation what now remained; finally
to be done, wherein by some (as they say) was again propounded the necessity
of bleeding, the opportunity whereof, by the evacuation of his belly was now
over passed.

In the end, the Doctors (long before this despairing of his recovery) did at
last agree upon Diascordium, as the only means (under God) now remaining,
which tempered with cooler Cordials, was given him in the presence of many
honorable Gentlemen, about ten a Clock at night, the operation whereof was
small or none; neither all this while did nature of it self incline toward
sweating, and to force the same they thought it to no purpose. This night was
unquiet as the rest, his accidents remaining in the same sort, but now and then
speaking, but so confusedly that he could not be understood.

Among the rest, this night about midnight, Master Nasmith his Majesty's
Surgeon sitting on his bed side, his Highness pulled him unto him by the
hand, speaking unto him somewhat, but so confusedly, by reason of the rattling
of his Throat, that he could not be understood; which his Highness
perceiving, giving a most grievous sigh, as it were in anger turned him from
him; thereafter (unless he were urged) never speaking unto him, or any.

In this extremity, (Sir David Murray, who in this one death suffered many)
came unto him, entreating him, and asking him, that if he had any thing to say
which troubled him, that he would betimes make known his mind: but his
Spirits being overcome, and nature weak, he was not able to say any thing,
save that of all other business he gave order for the burning of a number of
Letters in a certain cabinet in his closet, which presently after his death
was done.

Not long after (as I think) on Friday morning about three a clock, his
backbove, shoulders, arms and tongue, by reason of the horrible violence of
the convulsions, dis-joyntingly deviding themselves, the effect showing that
the retentive power was gone, the Spirits subdued, the seat of reason overcome,
and nature spent, in which extremity, fainting and sounding, he seemed twice
or thrice to be quite gone, at which time there arose wonderful great
shouting, weeping and crying in the Chamber, Court, and adjoining streets,
which was so great (together with somewhat else which they used) that they
brought him again.

This cry was so great, that all those in the streets thought he had been
dead; whereupon it went for the most part current in the City and Country that
he was gone.

I am not able to express the unspeakeable sorrow which every where was for
this woeful news, chiefly in that doleful house, you may imagine no thought
can think the greatness thereof, nor understanding conceive the same, this
little which I have said, overlading my weakness.

Thus given over of all into the hands of God, did his Highness lie in
extreme pain; during which, still now and then (till two or three hours
before his death) looking up, and speaking, or endeavoring to speak, which
for confusion and extremity of pain (being so near gone) could not be
understood, all the World were ready in this despair, to bring cordial waters
Diaphoretick, and Quintissentiall Spirits to be given unto him; amongst which,
one in the afternoon was ministered; which set that little nature remaining, on
work, forcing a small sweat, which, too late, was the first he had; Sir
Walter Raleigh also did send another from the Tower, which whether or no to
give him, they did a while deliberate.

After the operation of the first, his Highness rested quietly a little while,
presently after falling into his former extremities; whereupon (as the last
desperate remedy) with the leave and advise of the Lords of the Counsel there
present, the cordial sent by Sir Walter Raleigh (after it had been tasted and
proved) was given unto him; but in vain, save that forcing that spark of life
that remained, it brought him again into a sweat; after which, as before he
had some rest for a little while. But, no remedy, death would needs be
Conqueror; in vain did they strive against the stream, for he shortly after
became wonderful ill again; sight and sense failing, as also all the
infallible signs of death approaching; In which extremity, the Archbishop of
Canterbury being there present, who seeing it was now the time of times, before
the last gasp, to minister some comfort unto his Highness (if as yet there
were any sense remaining) came unto him, first speaking aloud; putting him in
mind of all those things which he had spokn unto him the day before in his
perfect sense, calling aloud in his ear, to remember Christ Jesus, to believe,
hope, and trust only in him, with assured confidence of mercy, to lift up his
heart, and prepare him to meet the Lord Jesus, with many other divine
exhortations: Thereafter calling more loud then ever, thrice together in his
ear, Sir hear you me, hear you me, hear you me; If you hear me, in
certain sign of your faith, and hope of the blessed resurrection, give us for
our comfort a sign, by lifting up of your hands, which he did, lifting up
both his hands together: Again he desired him yet to give him another sign,
by lifting up his eyes; which having done, they let him alone; For the
Archbishop had with streams of tears, powered out at his bed side, a most
exceeding powerful passionate prayer.

All this while also, from three a clock in the morning until night, there was
continual prayer in the house, and in every place where the danger was known;
by which his time growing nearer and nearer, and he weaker and weaker; Thus
did he lie, patiently striving betwixt death and life, unavoidable necessity,
and Gods will forcing patience, and again invincible courage and magnanimity
(loath to be overcome) showing some indignation and contempt of death: yea
death it self (for all his cruelty) stood a long while hovering in doubt what
to do* so did his Highness young years, his Triumphs at hand, the tears,
and exceeding sorrow of Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, the howling cries of
his Servants* and of the whole Land (who said, her loss, above all was most
unspeakeable) move his hard heart to pity: But a greater cry before this,
having outcried those cries (even the cry of our sins) there was no remedy:
for death (although unwilling) not being able to resist the forepassed decree,
must needs strike the cruel stroke; Many times did he from that morning
until night offer to shoot and thrust in his dart a little, yet pulling it
presently back again, as it were of purpose delaying the time, expecting some
merciful Message from Heaven, until at last the cloudy night bewraying the
irrevocable doom, by natures decay, the excess of pain having taken away the
sense thereof, of mere pity, that thereby he might open unto him the door
of Heaven for his passage into glory, being loath that the Angel, (who had
long attended to convey his Soul unto Heaven, should make any longer stay) he
thrust his Dart quite through; After which, his Highness quietly, gently, and
patiently, half a quarter, or thereabouts, before eight a clock at night,
yielded up his Spirit unto his Immortal Maker, Savior, and Restorer, being
attended unto Heaven, with as many Prayers, Tears and strong Cries, as ever
Soul was, on Friday the sixth of November, 1612. The Corpse shortly after (as
the Custom is) was laid along upon a Table on the floor, being the fairest,
clearest, and best proportioned, without any kind of spot or blemish, as ever
was seen.

On the Morrow after came the Lords of the Council, by appointment from his
Majesty, to give order for the opening of his Body, etc. which was the same
night effected, about five a clock in the Evening, in presence of the
Physicians and Chirurgions who assisted the Cure, together with the Physician
of the Prince Palatine, with many other Knights, and Gentlemen, in the Chamber
where he dyed, by the Chyrurgeons of his Majesty, and his late Highness,
under all their hands, as follows.

The skin like that of a dead man, black; but no way spotted with
blackness, or pale marks, much less marked with purples like flea-bites,
which could show any contagious or pestilentiall Venom. About the place of his
kidnyes, hips, and behind the thighs, full of redness; and by reason that
with great pain he had a long while lien upon his back, his belly somewhat
swollen and stretched out, by reason of the windiness which issued out of the
smallest opening made in the Navill, somewhat high naturally, incontinently the
belly falling; The stomach whole and wholesome within and without, having
never all his sickness time been troubled with vomitings, loathings, or
yealpings, or any other accident which could particularly show that it was
attainted. The Liver without, in his highest parts marked with small spots, and
in the lower with small blackish lines, paller and blacker then was fitting;
The Gall, Bladder, void of of any humor, full of wind: The Spleen on the top,
and in the lower end blackish, filled with a black heavy blood: The Kidneies
fair, and without any blemish. The Midriffe under the Filme, or Membrane,
containing the heart (which contained a little moisture) spotted with black,
as it were a Leadish color, by reason of the bruising: The lungs almost for
the greatest part black, the rest all spotted with black, all imbrewed, and
full of a dust blood, with a corrupt and thick serocitie, which by a vent made
in the body of the Lungs, came forth foaming in great abundance; in which
doing, and in cutting the small skin which invironeth the heart, to show the
same, the Surgeon by chance having cut the Trunck of the great vein, the most
part of the blood issued out into the Chest, leaving the lower veins empty;
upon sight whereof the Company did draw consequents of an extreme heat and
fullness, the which appeared yet more evident in this, that the windepipe with
the throat and tongue were convered with a thick blackenesse, and amongst
other accidents, the tongue cleft, and dry in many places: The heart sound and
dry, in all appearance, good in all his quallities.

The hinder veins which are in the inmost filme of the brain, called
Piamater, swollen and stuffed with abundance of blood, a great deal more then
natural; the substance of the brain fair and clear, but the ventricles
thereof full of a clear water, which after the incision ran forth in great
abundance: One part of which accidents (as they thought) was engendered, only
by reason of the Fever malign, by reason of the putrefaction of diverse humors
gathered together of a long time before, his Highness not being subject to any
dangerous sickness by birth; the other part, by reason of the convulsions,
resoundings and benummings, which by reason of the fullness, choking the
natural heat, and destroying the Vitals, by their malignitie, have conveyed
his Highness to the grave, without any token or accident of poison.

Thus (or very near thus) lost we the delight of mankind, the expectation of
Nations, the strength of his Father, and glory of his Mother, Religions second
hope; Foolish people immagine that they have done enough, when they have railed
upon the Physicians, as though they could have altered Providence, by
prolonging his life, never truly beholding the Omnipotent power bereaving him,
which although in his sickness, until the blow was given, could not be seen,
yet now (even of the blind) may be easily discerned. And I pray you, if we
narrowly look upon the practice of the means, what omission of duty shall we
find therein? Some near his Highness, together with Doctor Mayern, at first
called and wished he might bleed, others again, misliked the same, both
learned.

The Physicians, although jarring at first in their Propositions and reasons,
at last did every thing by a common consent under all their hands; Nothing was
wanting, which either Art or experience could think thereof, whatsoever they
did, they always thought most safest and best. They toiled continually day and
night* and if it pleased not God to give a blessing to the means, must they
therefore be blamed? You know Paul may plant, and Apollos may water but it is
God that gives the increase. But imagine, there had been any such strife
amongst them, the Physicians, as it is reported, what should we think thereof,
but that the God of Order will sometime have his will, brought to pass, by a
kind of confusion, as he overthrew the Tower of Babel, with the hosts of
Midian, etc. So in Physic, when his will must be done, if it please him to
break and take away the staff of bread, not blessing the means; who, I say,
can let him (whose will must be our law) to do whatsoever he will.

Indeed his Highness great and extraordinary patience, striving so long to
overmaster, and hide the same in his health, in my judgment, did much wrong
the Physicians, who by reason of his patience, never dreamed of his danger; as
also his most wonderful and matchless patience all the time of his Sickness,
showing no kind of froward disposition; lying in show (for any complaints were
heard of him) as though he had never been sick nor sore. As also the Vrines,
which until a little before his Death, showed no such danger; with the
dangerous unknown state of his greatest grief closely rooted in his head (as
in the opening has been seen) which could not at first be fully known,
until too late; the picture of Death by a strange extraordinary countenance,
having from the beginning possessed him: vain rumors also have been spread
abroad, that he was poisoned: But if the former Discourse be well considered,
his Death, in my judgment, will appear to have been natural, grounded upon
very urgent causes. For the Physicians in opening found no such cause in his
internals, upon his skin being no kind of spot, or any such suspicion. To
surmise as some have done, that he was poisoned by a Sent, considering the
premises, me thinks were great folly, contrary to the opinions of all the
learned, who upon this relation to his Majesty, proved him free from any such
infection: For my part, my skill reaches not to determine of any thing; only
I think it best to hold, that he died in the rage of a malicious and
extraordinary burning Fever, wherein his vitals and senses were from the
beginning so over-pressed, stupefied, and amazed, chiefly the heart and head,
which notwithstanding all cordials and other helps used (God not blessing the
means) could never be releeved.

The Monday after, the Right honorable the Lords of the Privy Counsel of his
Majesty, with exceeding care came to Saint Iameses, to give order for all
things belonging to so woeful a business; according to which, the whole House,
Chapel, great Chamber, Presence, Lobby, Privy Chamber, and Bed Chamber were
all hung in black with all things fitting, thick set with Scutcheons of his
Highness diverse Arms, which being done, under the State in the Chamber where
he first sickened, appointed for the Coffin, there was a place erected above
an Ell in height, where it was to stand to be watched until the Funeral;
Threescore and ten Gentlemen of his Servants, ordinary and extraordinary
(which were all he had) being appointed night and day to attend the same,
ten at a time, it being so ordered that the ten who watched in the night,
did constantly wait the third day after; Mean while was order given that the
Funeral should be solemnized on Monday the 7. of December following; until
which time, I will not renew griefs in remembering the unspeakeable sorrow
which was in that woeful House, now longing to do their last duty.

The time of the Funeral now approaching, on Thursday the third day of
December, the Coffin was removed from the Chamber where it stood all this
while, unto the Privy Chamber, there being watched for that night. On the
morrow it was removed from thence to the presence Chamber, where it remained
all that night until the next day, being Saturday at three a clock in the
afternoon, at which time his crown and cap of state were set upon a cushion
at the head of the Coffin; after which the Heralds marching before the same,
the Coffin was removed by the Gentlemen of his Privy Chamber unto the great
Chamber, where his Guard attended, in which it was set down for the space of a
quarter of an hour; thereafter being lifted again by the foresaid Gentlemen,
it was brought down stairs toward the Chapel, where again for a pretty
while it was set down in the Court; where being lifted again, the Gentlemen
of his Majesty's Chapel singing mournful ditties before them, it was
brought into the Chapel and there placed under a Canopy set with great Arms
of the union at full, chained with diverse other Scutcheons and several Arms,
there to remain until the Funeral day; This Sunday at night before the
Funeral, his representation was brought (made in so short warning, as like him
as could be) and apparelled with clothes, having his creation robes above the
same, his cap and crown upon his head, his Garter, Collar, with a George about
his neck, his golden staff in his Right hand lying cross a little; briefly,
every thing as he was apparelled at the time of his creation; which being
done, it was laid on the back on the Coffin, and fast bound to the same, the
head thereof being supported by two cushions, just as it was to be drawn
along the streets in the Funeral chariot, drawn by eight black horses, decked
with his several Scutcheons and Plumes.

But now the time being come, and all things to adorn the Triumphs of his
mournful Hadadrimons black day, the Funeral being four hours in
marshalling and marching, set forth about ten a clock in the morning, there
being (as was thought) the number of 2000. Mourners in black; the Relation
whereof were now to no purpose; since the order, ranks, and names are already
printed in a book to be seen; As it passed along, the whole World, sensible
and insensible things, and creatures seemed to mourn, and have compassion,
heaven and earth and all; There was to be seen an innumerable multitude of
all sorts of ages and degrees of men, women, and children, whose wonderful
sorrow who is able to express? some holding in their heads, not being able to
endure so sorrowful a sight, all mourning, which they expressed by several
sorts of lamentation and sorrow, some weeping, crying, howling, wringing of
their hands, others half dead, sounding, sighing inwardly, others holding up
their hands, passionately bewayling so great a loss, with Rivers, nay with an
Ocean of tears: Well, on they came at last to Westminster Abbey the burial
place, where, after the doleful music of all sorts being ended, the Coffin
was set under a great stately Hearse built Quadrangle wise with eight Pillars,
showing three to the view on each side four square, Cannopy like, rising small
on the top, trimmed and set thick within and without with diverse Scutchions,
small flagges, and pensels of his Highness several Arms of the Union
chained, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Chester, Rothsay, Carrick, etc. mingled
here and there with his Highness Motto, Fax mentis honestae Gloria, and that
of the Funeral Hearse, Juvat ireper Altum. After which the whole Assembly
having taken their places, banners, bannarets, and pensils of all sorts being
at rest, after an universal silence, the Archbishop of Canterbury (who was
appointed to do his Highness the last duty) was seen in the Pulpit, who with
a grave sober countenance, showing the inward sorrow of his heart, after a
little pause and prayer, did with exceeding passion make the Funeral Sermon;
Of which though you write that you are marvailous desirous to hear the
relation, yet I am loath to say any thing, fearing to wrong so grave and great
a Person; Nevertheless, since I have adventured thus far (I hope without
offense) I shall here (as near as I can remember) rehearse a word or two
thereof, whereby you may judge of the rest.

The Text was out of the 82. Psalm the sixth and seventh Verses: I have said
ye are Gods, and ye are Children of the most high: But ye shall die as a
Man, and ye Princes shall fall like others. Where after he had most learnedly
by way of introduction spoken of the Author, occasion, scope, and meaning of
this Psalm, he divided the same into two maine branches. First, the Exaltation
of Princes; I have said ye are Gods, etc. Secondly, in what respect they are
so called: Again, in the humiliation, least they should be out of measure
exalted, he admirably proved by infinite variety of examples, both divine and
moral, the vanity and inconstancy of greatness, with all the shadowish toys
thereof; Thirdly, for ocular proof and use of all, inviting their eyes to the
present doleful spectacle of their late ever renowned Prince, who, not long
ago, was as fresh, brave, and gallant as the best of them, unto whom all the
delights and pleasures of the World did beg for acquaintance, lacking nothing
which heart could wish for, who yet now for our sins lay thus low, bereaved
of life and all being, forced to prove the truth of this Text, not only to
fall, but to fall as others.

After which, when he had most truly and excellently showed a part of his
Highness Excellencies, and many Noble virtues (for all was not possible)
chiefly his rare and singular piety both in himself, and in the government
of his Household, which he so extolled, that he professed he would not be
ashamed hereafter to propose the same for a rule unto himself. For consolation
unto them all, he showed the exceeding measure of felicity, his Highness had
attained unto by death, and that now in respect of himself he was not to be
pitied, being compared with those, who had out lived him, the same one brave
ship lying amongst a number of others, all tending toward one Haven, whither
at length they must needs all come, or ship-broken perish by the way, which
setting forth betimes, as it were, new, fresh, and strong, with a fair gale of
wind, arriveth quickly without any danger at the Haven of safety; whereas the
rest loytering a long time by these, and these Inticements, set forth at last
in a more dangerous season, some overladen, some missing of their way, some
with leakes, some wracked, some starved, some drowned, all exceedingly
tempest-beaten, with much ado recovering their desired Haven: Even so, he
said, his late Highness had gotten the like advantage of all those that had
outlived him; all which laded with infinite more sins, indangering their safe
passage, must either perish by the way, or storm beaten, arive with much
toil, whither he betimes with ease attained. So with exhortation unto all, to
make right use thereof, with exceeding great passion and many tears, he ended.

This very day also the two Universities, Oxford and Cambridge, did solemnize
this black day, with all the signs of sorrow which could be imagined, having
in their two Universitie Churches, Funeral Sermons, all mourning, both in
heart, habit, and countenance; the forerunners of which their extreme
sorrow, long before this, in their several Books of mourning Epitaphs burst
forth, Oxford in her Iusta Oxon: and Cambridge in her Epicedium Cantabrig: etc.
with diverse other Orations to this purpose. The Funeral Sermon in Saint Mary's
Oxon: was Preached by Doctor Goodwin Deane of Christ-Church College there; The
Text being out of Esaias, the 57. 1. The Righteous perishes, and no man
considers in his heart; and merciful men are taken away from the evil to
come.

In which he was not only exceedingly moved himself, but also moved the whole
Universitie, and City, to shed fountains of tears.

The other of Cambridge was Preached by Doctor Carey, Master of Christ's
College, and Vicechancellour of the Universitie, his Text being out of the
second of Samuel, Chap. 3. verse 34. the last words of the Verse: And all the
people wept again for him. In speaking whereof, and weeping himself, he made
all the people weep again and again.

The Archbishops Sermon (as aforesaid) being ended, the Earls, Lords, and
Barons, etc. by this time having offered up their several Banners, and Honors
which they carried; as also the great Officers of his House, Sir Thomas
Challenor Chamberlain, Sir Charles Cornwallis Treasurer, Sir John Hollis
Comptrouler, together with his three Gentlemen-Ushers, Walter Alexander,
Anthony Abington, and John Lumley, having all by degrees (Sir Thomas Challenor
beginning) broken their White staves and Rods crosse-wise over the Coffin,
thereby resigning their places, the Assembly dissolved, the Coffin with the
representation (as is before said) remaining still under the Hearse, to be
seen of all, until the 19. of the said Month of December, when decked and
trimmed with clothes, as he went when he was alive, Robes, Collar, Crown,
Golden Rod in his hand, etc. it was set up in a Chamber of the said Chapel
at Westminster, amongst the Representations of the Kings and Queens, his
famous Predecessors, where it remains for ever to be seen.

He was of a comely tall middle stature, about five foot and eight inches high,
of a strong, straight well-made body (as if Nature in him had showed all her
cunning) with somewhat broad shoulders, and a small waste, of an amiable
Majesticke Countenance, his hair of an Aborne color, long faced, and broad
forehead, a piercing grave eye, a most gracious smile, with a terrible frown,
courteous, loving, and affable; his favor like the Sun, indifferently
seeming to shine upon all; naturally shamefaced, and modest, most patient,
which he showed both in life and death; slow to anger, that even then, when he
was many times most offended, he would (overcomming himself) say nothing;
merciful he was after he had a little punished the offenders; neither did he
judge rashly, but after due examination of both parties; Dissimulation he
esteemed most base, chiefly in a Prince, not willing, nor by nature being able
to flatter, fawn, or use those kindly who deserved not his love. Quick he
was to conceive any thing, not rash, but mature in deliberation, yet most
constant having resolved: true of his promise, most secret even from his youth;
so that he might have been trusted in any thing that did not force a
discovery: being of a close disposition, not easy to be known, or pried into:
of a fearelesse, noble, Heroicke, and undanted courage, thinking nothing
unpossible, that ever was done by any: a few fair words prevailed more with
him, then all the threats of the world: very pitiful and tenderhearted unto
any in misery, whom upon Petition, he ever some way releeved.

Most ardent in his love to Religion, which love, and all the good causes
thereof of, his heart was bent by some means or other (if he had lived) to
have showed, and some way to have compounded the unkind Iarres thereof; He well
showed his love to good men, and hatred of the evil, in discerning a good
Preacher from a vainglorious, in whom above al things he abhorred flattery,
loving and countenancing the good; of the idle and loytering never speaking but
with disdain; in which he showed he had a heart flexible to good, and al kind
of goodness, which (as I think) was the cause one day, he uttered this speech
of the Deane of Rochester his Chaplain.

That he thought, whereas he and others like him, at their first entry into
the Pulpit, did look him in the face, their countenance did, as it were say
unto him: Sir, you must hear me diligently; you must have a care to observe
what I say: As also in his constancy in observing the Prayer time, duly
before Dinner and Supper, which until his death he never willingly omitted,
whatsoever haste he had, or were it never so late.

What should I yet add, his conscience of an Oath, that he was never heard (I
now appeal to Envy it self) to take Gods Name in vain, with an addition of
any other seeming light, much less horrible Oaths, with full swinge of
passion; witness the testimony of the Most Reverend, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, in his Funeral Sermon, wherein was remembered by him, (amongst many
other things) that ever memorable reply of his Highness, who being asked one
day (by one that greatly rejoiced, his Highness was no swearer) why he did not
swear in play as well as others; to his eternal praise made this reply, That
he knew no Game worthy of an Oath.

To live long he never desired, nor aspired, many times saying, That it was to
small purpose for a brave gallant man, when the prime of his days were past,
to live so long until he were full of aches, soars, etc. uttering
contemptible speeches of Death; affirming many times, that he neither desired,
nor aspired, or hoped to live long, and that when he should be sick three or
four days together, then God have mercy on me, would he say.

Popery with all the adjuncts and adherents thereof, he hated to the death,
yet he would now and then use particular Papists very kindly, showing that he
hated not their persons, but their opinions.

I must not forget his love to Learning, to the Muses, to all the Learned who
any way did excel; to the two Universities, chiefly Oxenford (because mourning
Cambridge did never enjoy his presence) whose unspeakeale sorrow for his death,
will show the great portion of his love they enjoyed. I should but increase
sorrow, to tell you how exceeding kindly their Vicechancellour, Doctors,
Graduates, and Students were used, when they came to see him at Woodstock; What
care he had to give them contentment, how careful he was, and what special
commands were generally given throughout the whole house, that they should not
want the same; of his mild and grave carriage toward them, and his loving
speeches in their absence.

No less careful he was to obey the King his Father in every thing, being
also very diligent to observe and honor the Queen his Mother, so much as in
him lay, or as possible he might; wise he was to know and not know, see and
not see, almost every thing which was done or said. Wonderful was his care and
wisdom in governing of his house, and revenewes, giving order and seeing
every thing done almost himself, so that scarce were there any of his Household
Servants whom he did not know by name, amongst whom there was not one known
or suspected Papist; his care being so great, that all Communicantes names
should be written up, that he might know if there were any, that would not
receive.

So that I may most truly affirm, that since the beginning of Princes no house
did ever exceed him in all things; His Revenewes he left increased by
thousands a year; Sparing he was, yet liberal where either honesty, desert,
or poverty did move him; neither (whatsoever the World think) was he ever
known to give away any thing, or promise any thing but upon mature
deliberation; As for those pensious which he gave a little before his death,
they were either given to such as had very well deserved them, or who having
spent their means in his service, he could not out of his Noble disposition
but relieve, thinking it better to do so, then bestow upon them other unknown
suites and leases, which otherwise he must needs have done; He was loving and
kind to Strangers, whose hearts upon small acquaintance he did easily gain.
In state matters and petitions not pertaining unto him, he was ever sparing
and not willing to meddle: In his own affairs touching coppy-holds, leases,
or any thing of like nature, whatsoever abuses were, he ever redressed, or
minded to help, upon petition of the party aggreeved.

Friday being the day wherein he died (I know not by what natural
inclination, or motion) he did not of a long time before his death love,
misliking it above all the days of the week, upon which he would not
willingly use any kind of exercise, or ride any journey, sometimes not so much
as play at cards thereon, alleging that he continually found some
indisposition upon that day, and that he never had good luck upon a Friday,
such an ominous conceit of the dismalnesse of this day having possessed him,
which at length proved to be the period of his days.

He loved and did mightily strive to do somewhat of every thing, and to excel
in the most excellent; He greatly delighted in all kind of rare inventions and
arts, and in all kind of Engines belonging to the Wars, both by Sea and Land:
In the bravery and number of great horses; in shooting and levelling of great
pieces of Ordnance; in the ordering and marshalling of Arms; in building and
gardening, and in all sorts of rare music, chiefly the trumpet and drum;
in limming and painting, carving, in all sorts of excellent and rare Pictures,
which he had brought unto him from all Countries.

What should I say more of him? over and above all these things, he had a
certain kind of extraordinary unspeakeable excellency, my frail pen and
dull style not being able to express the same, gathered (out of question) by
him long ago from the plentiful Garden of the King his Fathers all admired
Bazilicondor^n, long since in his youth dedicated unto him.

I dare swear, none will think an ill thought, much less speak an ill word
of him, unless it be some Ianus-faced Machivillian, or hollow hearted
Gunpowderers, who as they would have blown up King, Progeny, and State, cannot
choose now but bark against him, who was a terror to all the Papists in
Christendom.

As he was a Man, no question but he had imperfectious as others (otherwise
he could not have conversed with men) which I profess, I neither knew, nor
delighted to search after; or if I had, you know of all others, I am rather
bound to cover and conceal the same with Shem and Japhet, then with Ham to show
his nakedness; If I were able, yet certainly whatsoever they were, such a
number of noble virtues did cover and weigh down the same, eclipsing their
light, that they could not easily be perceived, unless it were perhaps by
some maliciously bent, who though they might have gathered great store of
honey, have rather chosen (like droanes) to open the gall; whom I also leave to
the gall of bitterness until it consume them.

Wherefore now since his Soul rests in Heaven (whereof I entreat you doubt
not) let us also leave him; For his good life in general, his unfaigned love
to Religion, his love to good men, his sound, and saving knowledge, and
practice of the same, his attentive and reverent hearing of the word, his
humble flexible heart easily cast down, and drawn by the same, with many
other good things, which were in him, are sure signs of the favor of God, and
consequently of his salvation. To which if we consider with what innumerable
prayers, and strong cries, his soul was attended unto Heaven, we may rest
fully satisfied of his felicity; For although the extremity of pain from the
beginning of his sickness, did as it were stupifie and bereave him of sense,
that he could not give those wished testimonies to the World at full; (the
Lord choosing to try him in the furnace of affliction) yet since we shall be
judged not according to our death, but according to our life (although his
death in such an extremity, as is showed, was very good, we may certainly
conclude, that his Soul now praises God.

Wherefore when we miss him where we were wont to see him, let us lift up our
minds to a higher Watchtower, remembering that his Soul now rests in
Heaven, where all cares, troubles, soars, sickenesses, crosses, and
afflictions, shall no more annoy him; where the fears, jarres, jealousies,
discontentments, mutenies, uproares, and dissentions of State shall never vex
him; where he shall hunger no more, thirst no more, desire no more, having all
tears wiped from his eyes, in place of those frail ones, which could not here
endure the sight of the Candle, now beholding him whose eyes are ten thousand
times brighter then the Sun, following the Lamb whithersoever he goes, and
in the Heaven of Heavens, enjoying the blessed fruition of his God, in the
company of Millions of his Saints and Angels, waiting for the full revelation
and felicity of the Sons of God, and renovation of us all, when God shall be
All in All; where let us leave him (of whom we are not worthy until we be
gathered unto him) admiring his incomprehensible Wisdom which did bereave us,
until he let us know by experience, how he will bring light out of
darkness: For since he is goodness it self, his will (whatsoever it be)
must needs be good; And I pray you, what, how many, how great, and how
wonderful things has the Almighty done with this one blow, in humbling of
some, curbing the pride of others, casting some down, and again in raising up
of others; letting all see, as in a Mirror, the vain inconstancy of
Greatness, making some others inexcusable, if they receive no good from so
sensible a Lesson, with infinite more, known only to the All-sufficient,
All-seeing Majesty.

Let us therefore admire the infinite and incomprehensible Wisdom of Almighty
God, which so soon translated him from this Vale of darkness, and misery,
into that mavelous joy and light, although it seem strange unto our blind
eyes: For what know we but that the boiling headstrong passions of youth,
evil company (which corrupts good manners) the raines of Liberty, the
corruption of time, with infinite other inticements, whereunto flesh and blood
are prone, might have corrupted him, when dying with a consumed body, and a
more corrupted Soul, he might with an evil Conscience (though full of years)
have gone to the grave, with far more hatred, laden with innumerable more
sins, then now he did; when by the contrary, with the love, prayers, and
tears of all, he was attended unto Heaven.

Thus have I been bold to trouble you, and out of my love (for satisfying your
curiosity) to exceed the bounds of a short Letter; which if you mildly
Censure, with an impartial judgment, pardoning and excusing what you find
amiss, you shall encourage me ever to remain, as still I am

Your assured Friend, Charles Cornwallis.
