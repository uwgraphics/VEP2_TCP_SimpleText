A PROCLAMATION For suspending the prosecution upon that part of the late Act
of Parliament for Enlarging and Repairing of Common Highways, as concerns
the breadth of the Tire of Wheels.
CHARLES R.

WHereas by the Act of this present Parliament, for Enlarging and Repairing of
Common Highways, It is amongst other things Enacted, That no Wagon, Wayn,
Cart, or Carriage shall be employed for the uses therein mentioned, the Wheels
whereof are less then four Inches in the Tire, upon the penalties by the said
Act in that behalf provided; whereupon complaints and representations have been
made to His Majesty, and His Privy Council, from the Lord Mayor of the City of
London, and from diverse parts of the Country, That many inconveniences are
like to ensue, if that part of the said Act shall be urged to be observed, or
put in execution, concerning breadth of Wheels, by reason in many places the
Rutts cannot receive such Wheels, nor Carriages pass, especially in the winter
season now approaching, and in narrow passages, and in respect also of the
difficulty and charge (if not impossibility) of providing materials for new
Wheels, and Wagons and Carts answerable to them at once universally over the
Nation, by which means Commerce and Intercourse will be much obstructed, the
City of London, and other places deprived of necessary supplies of Provisions,
and the Country disabled to vend and utter their Goods and Manufactures; His
Majesty has therefore thought fit, by and with the Advice of His Privy
Council, to Order and Declare, and does hereby straightly Charge and Command,
That all prosecutions upon that Clause of the said Act, concerning the breadth
of the Tire of Wheels, shall be suspended and forborne until the Parliament
re-assemble, and take further Order, And that in the mean time, no Distresses
shall be taken, or other proceedings had for that Offense, and that the Horses
and Goods therefore already seized, taken or distrained, shall be forthwith
discharged and restored, without charge to the Owners. Provided that this
Proclamation shall not be taken, nor is intended to suspend the prosecution on
any other parts of the said Act, other then concerning the breadth of the Tire
of Wheels only, neither shall continue longer, then until the Parliament upon
consideration thereof shall take further Order.

Given at Our Court at Whitehal the 14th day of October, 1662. in the
Fourteenth year of Our Reign.
