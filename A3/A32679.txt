WHereas His Majesty has received Information, That some persons who can
Discover the Manner and Circumstances of the Murder of Sir Edmund-Bury Godfrey,
are withheld from so doing, out of a fear that their Persons may be in danger
from the Revenge which the Murderers or their Friends may take upon them, His
Majesty is pleased hereby to signify, and on the Word of a King to Promise,
That if any person shall speedily make such Discovery to one of His Majesty's
Principal Secretaries of State, he shall not only receive the Five hundred
pounds and Pardon (Promised by His Majesty's late Proclamation) but His Majesty
will take such effectual Courses for the Security of such Discoverer, as he
shall in Reason Propose.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall this Twenty fourth day of October, In the
Thirtieth year of Our Reign. By His Majesty's Command. HENRY COVENTRY.
