To his ROYAL HIGHNESS the PRINCE Of ORANGE.
Great SIR,
PRovidence the wise disposer of us all, sending me abroad to seek bread in a
strange land, gave me the good fortune to be a spectator of some of the Heroic
Actions of your Royal Highness, not only at the taking of Narden, and the
Grave from the French, but at several other places; I have been also happy in
liveing long in the Hague where for several years I had the opportunity of
observeing, (or rather Admiring) your Highness wise direction and Government
in the several* Colleges of the States, where some times your Highness has
been pleased to Act the part of the Pensionarie during his Indisposition; But
why do I speak of these things? All the world knows that your Highness has
wrestelled with and overcome the greatest Difficulties Imaginable, not feareing
the frowns and unjust proceedings of some, who by force of Arms detain part
of your Highnesses soveranity and inheritance, nor could the large Proffers and
Advantages offered to you by some, at any time shake that stedfastnes and
Princely resolution your Highness ever had to stand by and dye for the Intrest
of the Commonwealth; No God has certainly chosen your Highness to be a
Moises to go in and out before his People, and to be a glory to the Royal
Family of the Stewards. And now great Sir I want words to beg your Highness
pardon for the high presumption of Dedicating this small piece to your Highness.
All I can say is that it would be an infinite joy to me if I could possibly
do any thing to engage your Highness to look upon and accept of these
Remarks, as coming in all submission, from him who shall never cease to
implore the Throne of Grace to preserve your Highness to be the most eminent
Instrument in his own hand, for the good of Church and Commonwealth; so prays,

Your Highness Most devote and Humble Servant W^L: CARR.

To the READER.
THere is nothing more odious (and I am sure nothing that I hate more) then to
be recorded a fool in print, and yet I must be scribbling; But when I consider
that the best of pens have met with the like misfortune, by being severely
censured, by the Witt^ of the Town, I am the more encouraged to stand their
Shot. I know the Critics of the Age will take my remarkes in pieces, the one
calling me a Commonwealths man will say, I have flattered the Government of
Holland too much, others will say I have been to fevere in painting out the
Defects of some Countries, and Governments: and there is yet another sort that
will say I am an Opiniator of an English man, in praiseing so much mine own
Country; To all which I shall answer, that I never designed to please the Wits
of the time; what I have done has been to Comply with the desires of some
friends who designed to Travel, and therefore Engaged me to print some of the
remarks I made in my Travells, Dureing my 16 years liveing abroad. This being
the truth of the matter, I hope the courteous Reader will pass by any faults on
the method I have used in discribing some Countries, which is all I beg, who am
yours etc.

W. C.

Some Necessary REMARKS for such as Entend to TRAVEL Through the Province of
HOLLAND.
AS they that confine themselves to their own country have not the
opportunity to see and observe Rarities in other parts of the world: so such
as go into foreign places, rather wander at Random then travel, who hane not
the Curiosity to Commit to memory or writing such things they meet with, both
for their own and others Satisfaction, as may Demonstrate the fruits of their
travels.

I Confess all Travelers are not of alike Temper: Some delight themselves in
contemplation of the curiosities of Arts, some are taken with the varieties of
the works of nature, others speculate with a kind of Reverence the decays and
ruins of Antiquity, others studiously inform themselves with the transactions
of Modern times, others with thee Gouvernment and Polity, other speculate the
strange customs and fashion of the places they pass through; To be short every
one labors to entertain the reader with those objects and rarities of forain
parts, his Genius and inclination is most affected with.

As to my self, although during the space of 16 yeaves travel, I might have
enlarged, according to the curiosity and opportunity I have had in the
rehearsal of many rare and exquisite things very observable: yet my chief
aim was to make such remarks, as might most contribute to the common good of
humane society and Civil life, in taking notice of the Government and polity
of the several States and Dominions where I have been, viz. The United
Provinces, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and other countries, whose natural temper
and disposition seemed to me most to sympathise with our English nation, and
thereby have an occasion to do some good to my own country. Expect not Reader
alike punctualnes, as to all the forementioned places, because very many
things which I might have observed, are much agreeing, and so may be referred,
to what shall be spoken of the Polity and Government of Holland, which, for
reasons I shall by and by hint at, is the Chiese End I aimed at in this treatise.

We will begin then in the first place with the Commonwealth of Holland, and
Dominions of the States General which for some years has bin in a declining
condition, and their forces exceedingly weakened, by reason of that fatal war it
managed against England, France and the Bishop of Munster, unto which if we ad
the Intestime divisions of those two factions, the Prince of Orange and
Lovestein, that Politic body was so tottered and torn, as did threaten its
utter and total ruin.

But as bodies whither natural or Politic, after that a violent fit has sore
shaken, dissipated and exhausted their spirits, may recover vigor and
look-lively again, if so be the radical constitution and natural temper be not
wholly changed and depraved: even so This Commonwealth of Holland has visibly
recovered strength again, and probaly may attain to its former force and
Luster, except some depravation in its vital humous should still keep it
languishing, and obstruct its perfect cure.

We will therefore make some remarks as to the defects and faylings (observed
not only by me but also by others) which that famous Commonwealth has of late
years bin guilty of: which I shall do not out of any malice or disigne of
reflection, the intention of writing this treatise being simply to insert
those defaults, which the wisest of Authors have always Judged necessary not
only for the reformation of this, but of all states whatsoever.

This Commonwealth of Holland has worthily bin the wonder of all Europe during
this last age, and perhaps not to be paralled in the records of former times:
for if we consider how many years it was assaulted by the then most Potent
Prince of Europe, who aspired to no les then the Universal Empire, and that how
formidable soever he were, yet they not only maintained their pretensions, but
with uninterrupted prosperity and succesfulnesse advanced their trade, and
spread their conquests in all the four parts of the world.

Rome it self though most famous and victorious, yet could not, as is believed,
in so short a time do, what by this Commonwealth has bin effected. In India
and Africa they soon forced the Spaniard, and Portugeses to yield to them most
of their trade and posessions. And tho England put in for a share, yet they
were a long while vigourously opposed by the Dutch, and to this hour have
enough to do, to keep what they have gotten: so that in less then an hundred
years this Commonwealth by their industry and art in trading, are become so
excessive rich and potent that they began to insult and would needs be
Arbitraters to their neighboring Princes and States, and encroach upon their
Territories and Dominions.

This drew upon them that fatal war before mentioned, by which they were sorely
weakened and brought so low, that except God by a more then ordinary Providence
had protected and appeared for them, they had certainly bin ruinated and never
able to recover themselves again, however their pride hereby was much abated:
And as Luxury and lasciviousnes are the sad effects of prosperity, as well as
Pride, so such vices in a body Politic and Commonwealth, as do corrupt the
radical humors, by abating the vigor of the Vital parts, do insensibly tend
to the consumption and decay of the whole.

That this Commonwealth has much recovered its strength, may clearly appear,
if we consider what great things they have effected, since the little time they
have enjoyed peace: They have in less then 7 years built about 40 gallant
ships of war; They have laid out vast sums of treasure in refortifying Narden,
Mastricht, Breda, the Grave and many other places: They have paid vast sums of
money to their Allies for their auxiliarie troops, as also 200000 pound
sterling to the King of England to Enjoy their peace with him. And besides all
this their Increase in Riches and power may be guest at, by the many stately
houses built within these 5 years in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and other places; to
all which we may ad, to what excessive hight the Actions of the East and
West-Indie Company are risen, and the obligations from the Sates are so
esteemed as to security, that they Can get as much money as they please at 2
Per cent: not to speak, of the Exceeding increase of their subjects, occasioned
by the French Kings tyranny against the distressed Protestants in France,
Alsace and other parts of his Conquests, neither will we speak of other signs
of the increase of this Commonwealth, as not Judging it convenient to commit
them to paper, but will now proceed to show the Method of Living and traveling
in the Dominions and places of the States, which if you do well consider you May
see, how happy and easy the Government of England is, above that of other
Nations.

The Brill in Holland is the Usual place where the Packet and Kings pleasure
boats bring on such as come for to see the United Provinces: here be sure to
furnish your self well with money. From hence you take a boat to Maseland Sluice
or Rotterdam, which if you go in Company with others, will only cost you 5
stivers: but if you take one for your self, will cost 25. stivers for Maseland
Sluice, and a Ducaton to Rotterdam. The Fifth part of which goes to the States
for a tax, they call Passagie Gelt: and the other 4 parts are for the boat Men
or Shippers, who also out of their gains must Pay a tax to the States, so that
by computation you pay a fifth penny to the States for your traveling either
in boats by water, or in wagons by land.

As you pass by Maseland Sluice you will see a very fair fishing village, to
which belong near two hundred Herring Buisses, but if you go by the way of
Rotterdam you sail by two old Towns Called Flardin and Schiedam: yet let me
advise you before you depart from the Bril, to take a serious view of it, as
being the city which in Queen Elisabeths time was one of the Cautionarie
Towns pawned to England. The Brill had a voice among the States, but by reason
Rotterdam has got away their Trade, by which having lost its former luster, is
now become afishing town only.

Rotterdam is the second City for trade in Holland and by some is caled little
London, as having vast traffic with England, in so much that many of the
citisens speak good English. There are in this city two considerable Churches
of English and Scotch: and how great a trade they drive with the King of
Englands subjects is evident, for in the year 1674 at the opening of the
waters after a great frost, there departed out of Rotterdam 300 Sail of
Englesh, Scotch and Irish Ships at once with an Easterly wind: And if a reason
should be demanded how it coms to pass, that so many English Ships should
frequently com to that haven? It is easily answered, because they can
ordinarily Load and unload, and make returns to England from Rotterdam, before
a Ship can get clear from Amsterdam and the Texel: And therefore your English
Merchants find it Cheaper and more commodious for trade, that after their goods
are arrived at Rotterdam, to send their goods in boats Landward in, to
Amsterdam.

This city is famous as being the place where Great Erasmus was born, whose
Statue of Brass stands erected in the Market place; And although the buldings
here are not so superb as those of Amsterdam, Leyden or Harlem, yet the places
worth the seeing, are, first the Great Church where Several Admirals Lay
Stately Entombed, here you see their Admiralitie, East Indie, and Stathouses
together with that caled, het Gemeen Lands Huis.

From Rotterdam you may for 5 strivers have a boat to bring you to Delph, but
before you com thither you pass through a fair village called Overschie, where
the French and English youths are trained up in litterautre, as to the Latin
and Dutch tongue, Book keeping, etc: from thence in the same boat you com to
Delph which is famous for making of Porceline to that degree, that it much
resembles the China, but only it is not transparent.

In Delph is the great Magasin of Arms for the whole Province of Holland: Their
churches are very large, in one of which are Tombs of the Princes of Orange,
Admiral Tromp and General Morgans Lady, and in the Cloister over against the
Church you have an Inscription in a Pillar of Brass, showing after what manner
William the 1, that famous Prince of Orange was Shot to death by a miscreant
Jesuist, with his deserved punishment.

Delph has the 3d voice in the States of Holland, and sends its Deputies unto
the College of the States General, and to all other colleges of the
Commonwealth. They have also a Chamber in the East-Indie Company, as shall be
more largely spoken to, when we shall com to treat of the State of the said
Company.

From Delph you may by boat be brought to the Hague for 2 Stivers and an half:
Which is accounted the fairest Village in the world, both for Pompous buildings
and the largenes thereof; Here the Princes of Orange hold their Residence: as
also the States General and the Council of State, Here you have the Courts of
Justice, Chancerie, and other Courts of Law. Here you see that Great Hall, in
which many Hundreds of colors are hung up in Trophie, taken from the Emperor,
Spaniard and other Potentates with whom they have waged war. There Council
Chambers are admired by all that see them. Many fair Libraries they have
belonging to particular men. The Princes Palace is a most superb building, And
there are many costly Gardins adjoining to the Hague, together with that to
the Princes house in the Woad, in which house are in a large Hall the most rare
and costly Pictures of Europe, there also are those magnificent and unparalled
Gardins of the Here Bentham, of Amesland and others. I might here speak of the
splendour of the Prince of Orange his Court, of his noble virtues and valor, of
the most virtuous and Beautiful Princess his royal consort, but I dare not,
least I should infinitely fall short of what ought to be, and which others have
already don before me: and therefore leaving the Hague, I shall only tell you
that from thence you may for 7 Stivers have a boat to bring you to Leyden.
Leyden is a fair and great city, and the Universitie is very famous, being
frequented by 1000 of Students from all parts, as Hungary, Poland, Germany,
yea from the Ottomans Empire it self, who pretend to be grecians, besides the
English, Scots and Irish, who this years were numbered to be above 80.

The most remarkable things here to be seen, I shall summarilie set down: As the
place called the Bergh, formerly a Castle belonging to the Prince of Liege in
Flanders: The Stathowse, the University Schools, specially that of the
Anatomy, which excels all the Anatomy Schools in the world, a Book of the
rarities whereof you may have for 6 Stivers, their Physic Garden, and the
Professors Closet are al ravishing in rare Curiosities. But as to their
Colleges, they are but two and very small, not to be compared with the
smallest Hals in Oxford, neither have they any endowments, their maintenance
being only from the charitable collections of the Ministers of Holland,
neither are any Students to remain longer there, then til they attain the
degree of Batchelers of Art: One of the Curators being demanded by me, why so
rich a Commonwealth as Holland is, did not build and endow Colleges after the
manner of Oxford and Cambridge, answered they had not so many able and public
spirited men as are in England, and to deal plainly with you, said he, had we
such Colleges, our Burgemasters and Magistrates would fill them with their own
and their friends sons, who by leading a lazy and idle life would never become
capable to serve the Commonwealth, and therefore he judged it much better to
put them to Pension in Burgers howses, leaveing them to the care of the
Professors, who are very diligent in keeping the Students at their exercises,
both at Public lectures and in their private howses also, where they cause
them Punctually at their appointed hours to come to their examinations and
lectures, besides those they have in Public. Their churches are rare, so are
the walks round the city, and the fortifications very pleasing to behold.
Here you have the River Rhine running through the city and falling into it
from Catwyckop Zee. Leyden is very famous in history, for the long Siege it
held out against the Spaniard. From hence for twelve stivers and an half you
are brought to Harlem by water, being twelve English miles.

Harlem is famous in that Costor one of their Burgers, first invented the Art
of Printing. This Costor being suspected to be a Conjurer, was fain to flee
from Harlem to Cologne in Germany, and there Perfected his Invention, having in
Harlem only found out the way of printing on one side of the Paper. The first
book he ever printed is kept in the Stathouse, for those that are curious to
see it. Here is one of the fairest and largest Churches of the 17 Provinces, in
the walls whereof there remain to this day sticking canon Bullets, shot by the
Spaniards during the Siege thereof. In this Church are three Organs, as also
the model of the three Ships, that sailed from Harlem to. Damiater, seasing the
Castle in which the Earl of Holland was kept prisoner, and brought him away to
Holland: In the Tower of this Church hang two silver be^s which they also
brought from thence, and now ring them every night at nine a clock.

Harlem is renowned for making the finest linen cloth, Tyfinies Dammasks and
silk Stufs; also Ribands and Tapes; They have Mils by which they can weave
forty and 50 Pieces at a time, they make the finest white thread and Tapes for
lace in the whole world, there Bleacheries surpas al other whatsoever, their
waters whitening cloth better then any in the seventeen Provinces: They have a
most pleasant grove like a little Wood, divided into Walks where on Sondays and
holly days the Citisens of Amsterdam and other places come to take their
pleasure. Harlem is the second city of Holland and sends in Deputies unto all
the Colleges of the Gouvernment. From hence you have a passage by boat to
Amsterdam for six stivers, but when you are come half way you must step out of
one boat to go into another, where you see a Stately Palace, where the Lords,
called Dykgraves sit, Every one of these Lords has his Apartment when he coms
for the concerns of the Seadykes, and bancks: here are also 2 large Sluices
having gates to let in or out water from the Harlemmer Mere. Near this place
about Ano: 1672 a part of the Seabanck was broken by a strong Northwest wind,
drowning all the land betwixt Amsterdam and Harlem, which cost an incredible
vast sum to have it repaired. They sunck in this breach 400 small vessels filled
with earth and stones for a foundation to rebuild the well upon, and by
unspeakable industry and charges at last repaired the Banck.

I come now to speak of Amsterdam, which having bin the place of my abode for
several years, I shall give a more large and punctual account thereof then I do
of other places; It is esteemed by Intelligent men the second city in the
world for trade, and not inferior to any in wealth. Certainly Amsterdam is one
of the beautifullest cities in the world, their buildings are large, their
streets for the most part pleasantly planted with trees and paved so neatly, as
is to be found no where else in any other Country, save in some of the 17
Provinces. And although, as I have already said, Amsterdam may Justly be taken
for the second or third city after London and Paris, yet it has neither
Courtnor University, as they have. And now in treating of all the excellencies
and virtues of Amsterdam, I shall not hyperbolise, or flatter: for before I have
don you shall see, I shall also faithfully declaime against the evils, mistakes
and vices in it.

Amsterdam stands upon a thousand Morgans of Land, encompassed with a very
strong wall and Bastions most pleasant to behold, with a very large Burgaval or
Gracht as they call it, for the defense of three parts of the city, the fourth
being secured by the sea or Ty. There are 13 Churches in this city for those
of the reformed religion (called dutch Presbiterians) to meet and worship in,
with two Frencb, one Highdutch and one English, all Presbiterian Churches, who
only are allowed Bells, and whose Ministers are maintained by the Magistrate.
All these Churches or congregations make up only a third part of the
Inhabitants of the city: The Papists who have eighty five howses or Chapels
to meet in for their worship, make another third part, and have a long square
of howses for their Nuns to live in, who are not shut up in Cloisters, as in
Papists countries they are wont to do, but may go in and out at their
pleasure, yea and marry also if they grow weary of a Nunnish life: These
Churches of the Papists have no bells allowed them, being looked upon as
conventicles, and are many times shut up, and again opened at the Scouts
pleasure. The other third part of the city is made up by Jews, Lutherans,
Arminians, Brownists or English Independents, Anabaptists and the Quakers: None
of which, as was also said of the Papists, have bells allowed them, but are
accounted Conventicles: and all that marie amongst them, must first be married
by the Magistrate, and then if they pease among themselves in their own
assemblies, neither are any of them admitted unto any Office in the Government,
but only such as are of the reformed or Presbiterian profession.

The Jews who are very considerable in the trade of this city have two
Synagogues, one whereof is the Largest in Christendom, and as some say in the
world, sure I am, it far exceeds, those in Rome, venice, and all other places
where I have bin: Within the Court yard where their Synagogue stands, they have
severa^ Rooms or schools, where their children are taught Hebrew, and very
carefully, to the shame of Christians negligence, brought up and instruckted in
the Jewish principles.

Amsterdam for the wise Statesmen it has produced, is said to be a second
Athens: others make it the Storehowse or Magasin of Europe, for that it has
such great store of Corn, wherewith it furnishes many other nations. And
secondly for the exceeding great Magasin of Spices, which in ancient times the
Venetians brought by land, furnishing all parts of Europe, but now is don by
the East-Indie Company which not only supplies Europe therewith, but many
places in the Indies also. Thirdly it has inconceivable store of al manner of
provisions for war, In so much that England and diverse other nations send to
Amsterdam to buy Arms, Bufcoats, Belts, Match etc: yea here are several
Shopkeepers who can deliver Arms for 4000 or 5000 men, and at a cheaper rate
then can be got any where else, and this they can do by reason of their great
Industry in the Engrossing most of the Iron works on the Rhine and other
Rivers which run into Holland. Forthly Amsterdam has more store of sawed and
prepared Timber for shipping then can be found in any one Nation in the world,
and this is the reason why her Neighbor town Sardam is made capable of
Building ships 20 per cent cheaper then they can do in England or France: So
that both France, and Spain do many times buy them in Holland: as lately the
King of Spain bought 10 Capital Ships of the two Brothers the Melts Merchants
in this city. Fifthly Amsterdam is the staple where the Emperor sels his
Quicksilver not only to the Spaniard, to use in his mines in the Indies, but
for the making of Cinoprium or Vermillion, with which Amstrerdam furnishes not
only Europe, but many places in the Indies.

Sixthly Amsterdam is the Market where the French King bought his Marble for
Versellis Louvre, and other of his Palaces in France: There are such Vast
Magasins in Amsterdam that a man would think, that sees them, there were
Quaries of Marble near the City Gates. Seaventhly Amsterdam has the most
considerable Bank that now is in the whole World; I have compared the Bank of
Venice with that of Genua and both their Banks write not of so much money in
two days as Amsterdam does in one: further I have compared the Bank of Venice
with Hamburg and find both those Banks fall very much short with the bank of
Amsterdam. There are many other particulars I could name* as Arguments to prove
the great Riches and Trade of Amsterdam, as those vast Quantities of Wynes, and
Brandewynes they sell in the North and Eastseas, and those vast Countries
adjoining thereunto, from whence they bring Hemp, Pitch and Tar, and furnish
France, Italy and Spain with the same, and they likewise have much Engrossed
the Copper and Iron of Sweedland. I will say no more of her stores and
Magazins, but shall in the next place say some thing of her Churches and
Charity to the Poor. I will not speak much of her Churches, but only that
they are in General large and well built: In one of them the States have Spared
no cost to exceed the whole world in 3 things (Viz) an Organ with sets of Pipes
that counterfit a Corus of Voices, it has 52 whole stops besides half stops,
and has 2 rows of Keys for the feet, and three rows of Keys for the Hands;
I have had people of Quality to hear it play, who could not believe but that
there were men or Women above singing in the Organ, until they were convinced
by goeing up into the Organ Room. The second is such a large Carved Pulpet and
Canapie as cannot be found elsewhere in the world; The third is a Screene of
brass.

The Stathouse in this City is a wonderful superb Building, on the uppermost
part of which is a large Magazin of Arms. The Copper Statues that stand on top
of the Stathouse are very large and pieces Exellently cast, Especially that
called Atlas, who has a Globe of the world on his back that will hold 30
Barels of water, for me to speak of the several rarityes of Pictures, Carved
works and marble in this Stathouse, and of the Globes Celestial and
Terrestrial that are on the floor of the great Hall, would make* Book of it
self; I therefore will speak of their Almeshouses and of the Government of
the poor, of their Prisons and houses of Correction. This City is said to
have 20000 poor Every day at Bed and board. The Almeshouses are many and look
more like Princes Palaces then Lodgings for poor people; First there are
houses for poor Ouldmen and Women, then a large square Palace for 300 Widows,
then there are Hospitals for Boys and Girls, for Burgers Children and for
strangers Children, or those called Foundtings, all these boys and girls have
Every sunday and other days of Worship 2 doites given them by the Fathers of
these Houses, the which the Children put into the Deacons sack when they gather
for the Poor in the Churches; Then there is an Hospital for fools, and a
Bedlam: There are Houses where Common Beggars and Gamesters and frequenters of
Taphcuses are Kept hard at work: There is also a House called the Rasphouse
where petty Thieves and such as flash one another with Knives, such as beg with
cheating devises, women with fained great Bellyes, men pretending to have been
taken by the Turk, others that pretend wrack at sea, and such as beg with a
Clapper or a Bell, as if they could not speak or hear, such as these are kept
hard at work, Rasping Every day 50 pounds between 2 of them, or Else are beaten
with a Bulls Pissel, and if yet thy rebel and wont work, they are set in a Tub
where if they do not pump the water will swell over their heads; Then there is
a House where whores are Kept to work, as also disobedient Children who live
Idle and take no course to maintain themselves, likewise Women commonly
drinking themselves drunck, and scolds; Al these sorts of Hospitals and
Almeshouses are Stately Buildings richly adorned with Pictures and their
Lodgings very neat and clean. In some of the Boys and Girls Hospitals there
are 1500, in some 800 and in some 500 in a House; Then they have Houses where a
man or a Woman may have their Diet, washing and Lodging for his life, giving a
small sum of money: These are called Brouders houses, the Alms Children of
this city are held in such Veneration and respect that a man had as good
strike a Burgemasters Child as one of them. These Children are permitted to
travel in any of the Treckscuts freely without money; These Hospitals are
Governed by Men and women, as are of an unspotted life and reputed to be rich,
devout and pious, it is very observable that the Women Govern their Women
Hospitals better then the men do theirs yea it is a General observation in this
Country, that where the Women have the direction of the purse and Trade, the
husband seldom prove Bankrupts, it being the property of a true borne
Hollands-wife presently after marriage to apply her self wholly to her
Business; but I forbear to say any more of the Duch Houswives, for fear of
displeasing our English Dames, not so much addicted, at least not so Generally
bred up to Industry; but to return to the Acts of Charity of Amsterdam; the
which is so Extraordinary that they surpas al other Cittyes in the World, for
they are daily and houerly giveing to the poor, Every House in Amsterdam has
a Box hanging in a Chain on which is written Think on the Poor, so that when
any merchant sels Goods they commonly conclude no bargain, but more or less is
put in the Poores Box; These Boxes art Locked up by the Deacons, who once a
quarter go round the City and take the Money out of the Boxes. Then twice a
week there are men belonging to the Hospitals that go round the City and ring
a bell at every House to Know what the Master or mistress of the House will give
to the Box, who Generally give not less then 2 stivers. Then every first
Wedensday of the month the Deacons in their turn go round the City from
House to House to receive what every house Keeper will give to the Poor, Then
on the week before the Sacrament is given, a Minister with an Elder goes round
the City to every House where any members of the Presbiterian Religion live,
and there ask if any Differences be in the family, offering their service to
reconcile them, also to Instruct and prepare such as are to receive the
Sacrament; At this time a Minister may be seen to go into a Taphouse or
Tavern for which at another time he would be counted a wine biber and the
worst of Reprobates; At this time while these Ministers and Elders go about
the City on their Visiations the people take an Occasion to give to the Poor.
And here I ought not to omit telling you of their great Charity to the
distressed French Prosestants, who are here in great Numbers. They maintain no
less then 60 French Ministers, and unto many handicraft Tradesmen and makers of
stuffs, and Cloth, they lend sums of Money without Intrest to buy Working
Tools and materials for their work, but this is no other then they formerly
did to the Poor distressed Protestants of Ireland and Piemont, and their
Charity was not a littel that they gave to Geneve toward the building their
Fortifications; And here give me leave to tell you what King Charles the second
said of the Charity of Amsterdam, when the Duke of Lotherdal heareing that the
Prince of Oranges Army was not able to oppose the french from advanting so
near to Amsterdam, the Duke Jeareingly said that Oranges would be very scarce
in Holland, after Amsterdam should fall into the french hands to plunder, to
which his Majesty said that he was of opinion that God would preserve
Amsterdam from being destroyed if it were only for the great charity they have
for the Poor, the which put the Duke out of Countenance; I will say no more of
their Charity, only this that they leave no stone unturned to bring moneys
into the Poores stock, they make the stage players pay 80000 Gilders a year to
the Poor: thert is not a Ropedancer, puppetplayer or any of that sort of
unnecessary Vermin which frequent faires, but pay the 3d penny to the Poor,
which is carefully looked after by placeing an Almesman at the door of the
Booths, to see that they cheat not the Poor of their share; I shall now in the
next place say some thing of the Clergy, I mean those called the States
Clergy, for the States are absolutely head of their Church, and when any synod
of Divines meet, two of the States, are always present to hear that they
debate nothing relating or Reflecting on the Government, or Governers, if they
do, presently the States cry ho la mij^ Heeren Predicanten^, and if their
Ministers meddel with any thing relating to the Government in their Pulpits they
send them a brief (which some call a pair of shoes) to quit the City, and
some times Impriprison them to boot: but if they behave themselves quietely and
well, as they ought to do, they th^n are respected by the people as Gods upon
earth; They have a form of prayer sent them, how they shall pray for the
States and Prince of Orange, nor must they meddell with any other Religion in
the Country, because all sorts are Tolerated, at least connived at by the
Magistrates; All those called the Presbeterian Ministers or States Clergy are
obliged under a forfiture to have done preaching and praying by eleven of the
Clock in the forenoone on Sondayes, because then the Schepens go to the
Stathouse, to marry the Jews Papists and Lutherans and others that may not
mary after the Calvinisticall form, and the reason why the States thus marry
them first according to law, is to render their Children Legitimate, but they
may marry again afterward as they please themselves: none may marry until
they have made their appearence at the Stathouse before the Lords, where if the
parties be agreed, the Preachers marry the Calvinists, and the Schepens marry
all the rest, who differ from the Religion established by Law.

When one dies the friends dare not burry the Corpse until it has lain three
days open in the Coffen, that the friends and relations of the deceased may be
satisfied that the party has not been murdered or reported to be dead when
alive, after 3 days the corpse must be brought to the church before the
Delceaseth tolling, which is at two for if you Keep the body until half three
then the Church doors are locked and for the first half hour must be paid 25
Gilders, and for the second 50, and so until six, then they may amers you as
much as they please.

There are many rich people who make that default on purpose, that they may
have solemn occasion of giveing to the Poor, as I Knew once an English
merchant did.

The next thing I shall speak of is the method which the States observe in
ordering their Maritim affairs, one of the greatest mysteryes in their
Government; The States Generally divide their Admiralty into five Courts, which
they call Chambers: The first is Rotterdam (which is the chamber called the
Mase) which has the Admirals Flagg.

Then Amsterdam which has the Vice-Admirals Flagg, and Zealand has the rear
Admiral Flagg, the other two Chambers are those in North Holland and Friesland:
Each of these five Chambers have their Admirals, Vice Admirals and rear
Admirals apart from the States Generals Flaggs, so that when the States have
occasion to set out a fleet of an 100 Ships more or less, every Chamber Knows
the number they must provide for their proportion, tho in regard of its
Opulencye Amsterdam frequently helps her neighbors and ads two or more Ships
then their share comes to; These Chambers have lately built 36 men of war, and
now are building of 7 more and all this is done without noise, every one
building their proportion, and they have admirable methods in preserving their
Ships when Built, and their Magazins are in good order every Shipp having an
appartment to lay up all its Equipage in, and on the Top of their Magazins are
Vast Cisterns, which are Kept constantly full of water which have pipes into
every appartment to let down water upon any accident of Fire, and there is in
their Magazins a Nursery Room, where a Woman keeps an Office to feed at
certain hours of the day a great number of Cats, which afterward hunt among
the stores for Mice and Ratts; This great Magazine in Amsterdam was built in
the time of Cromwell in the space of 9 months and 14 days, in which time the
Lords of the Admiraltie gave the workmen drinkgelt as they call it, to
encourage them to work more then at an ordinary rate. At this time the biggest
man of war the States had was the Amelia, in which the famous Amiral Trump was
Killed, she was a Ship of no more then 56 Guns, afterward made a fire Ship. But
the States quickly discovered their want of great Ships, and therefore built
the same year 20 men of war, from 50 to 80 Gunns. But the great Ships built
at Amsterdam had like to have proved of no use, had not theingenious
Pensionarie de Wit found out a devise to carry them over the Pampus, betwixt
those they call Water Ships;

The Admiralty have an Exellent Method in setting out their Fleets, they
neither press soldiers nor seamen, all go Voluntary at the beating of a
Drumb, each Captain providing men and Provisions for his Shipp, who after they
have received orders from the Lords to the Equipagemaster to Equipe out their
Ships, and receive the Povisions of war, then the States send a board each
Shipp a Chaplin, and Check Master, who take care of the provision of war, and
see that the seamen have the States allowance and wholesome food, and great
care is taken by the Lords that both Captains and Seamen receive their pay
punctually for the time they are in the States service, and for the Encouraging
their seamen there is plaistred on a Board hanging by the foremast, the several
rewards to such as either take or fire a Flagshipp or take or sinck any other
Shipp of the enemies, also what pensions a wounded seaman shall have if maimd or
disabled in the States service etc.

The Lords of the Admiralty follow the same methodes which the States General
observe, as to their land obligations, and go throw this great charge by the
good management of their Credit, for tho it be true that they are indebted
great sums of money, yet they never want a supply, nay, Moneys are often
forced upon them by rich Merchants, who send in their, moneys and only take the
Admyraltyes obligations, with which they afterward pay their Customs, when
their Ships arive, at which time the Admiralty allows them Intrest for the
time they have had their money, and this is it that makes the Admiraltyes
Obligations more valued then ready money, for it saves the trouble of telling,
and such is the Credit of the Admiralty that when they have occasion for any
Goods, the people strive to furnish them, and rather take their Obligations
then money, because they get Intrest; and all other assignments upon the
Admiralty are very punctually paid, and without Exchequer Fees, no they are
sworn Officers who are forbid to receive any moneys for fees, being contented
with the sallary, they have of the States. And their Methodes used at the
Custom House for loading or unloading Ships are very easy, in so much that
the Women Generally have the chargeing and dischargeing the Ships at the
Custom House, which is a great polity in the States to make Trade easy for
the Encouragement of the Merchants; And the Admiralty are very Grateful and
Generous unto their Commanders, if any of their Admiralls, or Captains are Killed
at sea and have dove any Considerable service, they then Eternise their
memories with lasting Trophies of honor, as you may see by those Stately
Monuments of Trump, Vpdam, de Ruiter, the Eversons, and others, nor are they
spareing in bestowing large Gifts and Pensions on the Widows, and Children of
those as have served them faithfully and Valiantly in the wars, whilst the
Treacherous and Cowards meet with the severity they deserve; I might here in
the next place in large and tell you of the Exellent methodes they have in
building and preserveing their Ships when built, but I shall refer you to that
Exellent piece written by the Here Witsen on that subject. And shall now in the
next place say some thing of their famous Company called the East India Company
of the Netherlands, This Company is said to be a Commonwealth within a
Commonwealth, and it is true if you consider the Sovereign Power and
Privileges they have granted them by the States General, and likewise consider
their riches and Vast Number of subjects, and the many Territories and Colonies
they possess in the East Indies, they are said to have 30000 men in constant
pay, and above 200 Capital Ships, besides Sloopes, Catches, and Yachts. This
Company has by their Politic contrivances and sedulons Industry possessed
themselves of many Colonies formerly belonging unto the Spaniards, and
Portugeeses, and diverse Indian Princes, and as good Christians have been at
great Charge in Planting the Gospel of Christ in many parts there, Printing in
the Indian Language Bibles, and Prayer Books and Catechismes, for the
Instruction of the Indians, maitaineing Ministers and Schoolemasters to inform
those that are converted to the Christian faith; And now because I have said
that this Company is so considerable and as it were a Commonwealth apart, I
will demonstrate it to be so, first by their power, Riches and strength in the
Indies, secondly what figure they make in Europe, and this very briefly, for
if I should speak of every particular as to their posessions in the Indies, it
would swell into many Volumes, But I will only begin with them at the Cape of
de Bonne Esperance where they have built a Royal Fort, in which they maintain
a Garrison of soldiers to defend their Ships which come there to take in
fresh Water; from thence let us take a view of them in the Island of Java where
they have built a fair City called Battavia and fortified it with Bastions
after the Mode of Amsterdam. This City is the place of Residence of their grand
Minister of State, called the General of the Indies, he has allowed him 6
Privy Councellers in Ordinary and 2 extraordinary, These govern the concerns
of the Company throughout the Indies, and They make peace and war, send there
Ambassadors to all parts thereof, as occasion requires. This General has his
Guards of Horse and Foot and all sorts of Officers and servants as if he were a
sovereign Prince, the whole Expense whereof is defraied out of the Companys
stock. This General has much of the Direction of Bantam and other parts of the
Island of Java: From whence let us take a view of them, in their great
possessions in the Moluceas Islands and those of Banda where they are become so
formidable that they look as if they aimed at the soveraingtye of the
Southseas: They have also a great Trade in China and Japan, from whence let us
return to the Islands of Sumatra and on the coast of Bengale, where they have
several Lodges; In Persia they have likewise great Commerce and are so
considerable that they wage war with that mighty Monarch if he wrongs them in
their trade. They also have several Colonies and Lodges on the coast of Malabar
and Cormandel, and in the Country of the Great Magul, and King of Galcanda, But
principally let us behold them in the rich Island of Zylon where they are
Masters of the plain Country, so that the Emperor or King of that Island is
forced to live in the Mountains whilst this Company possess the City of Colomba
and other the most considerable Garrisons of that Island: It is said that the
Company has there in their pav 3600 Soldiers, and at least 300 Gunus planted
in their Forts and Garrisons. In a word they are not only masters of the
Cinnamon, but of all other Spices except Pepper and that they would also have,
had it bin for their Intrest to Ingrosse, but they wisely fore saw that the
English would be a Block in their way, therefore they contented themselves to
be masters the Mace, Cynamon, Cloves and Nutmegs with which they not only serve
Europe, but many places in the Indies; I will say no more of them in the
Indies, But let us see what figure they make in Europe. And first to begin with
them in Amsterdam, where they have two large Stately Palaces, one being in the
old part of the City, and the other in the new; In that of the old part of
the City they keep their Court, and there sits the Resident Committie of the
Company, where also they make the sales of the Company goods. There for six
years the grand Council or assembly of the 17 do meet, and after six years
are expired, the grand Council of the 17 do assemble at Middelburg in Zealand
for two years, and then again return to Amsterdam: The other lesser Chambers
of Delph, Rotterdam, Horn and Enchusen never having the assembly of the 17 in
their Chambers, so that only Amsterdam and Zealand have the honor of that
grand Council. I will therefore crave leave to describe unto you the Chamber of
Amsterdam, it being the most Considerable of the Chambers, belonging to this
famous Company; In there house or Palace within the old City are many large
Offices or appartments, as first on the Lower Floor is their Parliament Chamber,
where the 17 do sit: Next to this Chamber are several fair Chambers for the
Committes to sit in. They have also a Chamber of Audience, where they do
receive Princes or Ambassadors, or other great men as have occasion to speak
with them. In one of these Chambers are the Arms of several Indian Princes
they have Conquered. On the same Floor is their Tresury Office, where their
Receivers sit and receive money, and pay out the orders or assignments of the
Company, Near ^o that Chamber sits their grand Minister the Here Peter van Dam,
who is said to be a Second John de Wit for parts, but he has not one drop of
John de Wits or Lovestine blood, against the good Prince of Orange; This great
minister is a man of Indefaigable Industry and labor night and day in the
Companyes service; He reads over twice the great Journal Books which come from
the Indies, and out of them makes minets to prepare matters of concern
necessary to be considered by the grand Council of the 17, and by the Inferior
Committes of the Company, and prepares Instructions and orders to be sent to
their Chief Ministers in the Indies, I could say many more things of his great
worth and Virtues, but shall forbear least I should be Judged a flatterer:
Overagainst this great Ministers Office sit in a Chamber many Clerks or under
Secretaryes, who receive from this Minister their Ordrs of dispatches in the
affairs of Company, and next to this Chamber is a Register Office where are
kept the Journal books of the Indies, where you may see the names of all the
men, and women that have ever served the Company in the Indies, with the time
of their death, or departing the Companyes service; Then next to that is a
Council Chamber where the Residing Chamber or Commit of the Company always
sitts Then assending up stairs, there sit their Bookholders, who keep the
accounts of all the Transactions of those that buy or sell actions of the
Company, and over against this office sitts the Here Gerbrand Elias who is the
second Advocate of the Company: On this floor are several large Rooms in
which are great stores of Packt Goods, and also a Room with all sorts of
Drugs, Tee, and Wax, Ambergreace, and Musk, and on the same floor is a Chamber
where the Commissiners sit who govern, the Packhouses; And next to them sit
their Clarks who keep the Registers of the sales of the Company Goods; And on
the same Gallery or Floor is a Chamber where are kept the several Books of
Divinity, printed in the Indian Language that are sent to the several Colonies
of the Company: And at the end of this Gallery is a Magazine full of
Medicaments and Instruments for Barber Chirurgions Chests, to furnish the
Companyes Ships and Garrisons in the Indies. Then assending up another pair
of stairs, there are several large Magazins of Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace and
Sinamond, and in a long Gallery are many men at work sorting of Spices fit for
sale. Then ascending up another pair of stairs there are many Rooms full of
Spices, then desending into the Courtyard there is a Guard Chamber where every
night the house keeper has a Watch, and on the other side of the Gate there is
the Chemist, who with his men prepares Medicaments for the Indies; Adjoining to
this Courtyard is their Wayhouse and Packhouse for Pepper and Gross Goods;
But before I leave this house in the old part of the City, I must say some
thing of the manner or method used in the Transactions of the Jews and others,
who make a Trade of buyng and selling the Actions of the Company, the which is
a great mystery of Iniquity, and where it inricheth one man, it ruins an
hundred. The Jews are the chief in that Trade, and are said to negotiate 17
parts of 20 in the Company; These Actions are bought and should 4 times a day,
at 8 in the morning in the Jews street, at a 11 on the Dam, at twelve and at
one a Clock upon the Exchange, and at six in the evening on the Dam, and in the
Coledges or Clubs of the Jews until 12 at midnight, where many times the
Crafty Jews, and others have Contrived to Coin bad news to make the Actions
fall, and good news to raise them, the which craft of doing at Amsterdam is
not taken notice of, which is much to be wondered at, in such a wise Government
as Amsterdam is, for it is a certain truth they many times spread scandalous
reports touching the affairs of State, which pass amongst the Ignorant for
truth; I shall now in the next place say some thing of their Palace or
Magazine in the new part of the City the which may more properly be called an
Arsenal; It is a building so superb that it looks more like a Kings Palace,
then a Magazin for Merchants; I have measured the Ground on which this Arsenal
stands which I find to be 2000 foot, and square every way, reckoning the Motes,
or Burgals, about it; I remember the Ingenious Sr. Joseph Williamsen measured
the two Rope-allies by telling the stone figures in the wall, and found them to
be 1800 foot long, the like whereof is not to be seen in the world. On the
backside of this Ropeallie lies a store of 500 Large Anchors besides small
ones; In this Arsenal they build the Ships belonging to this Chamber: and here
are al sorts of work houses for the Artificers that serve the Company. And in
a Chamber next to the Joyners Office, is a model of a Ship, they now build
their Ships by, which cost 6000 Gilders. When a man beholds the great stores of
Timber, Cordage, and the Provisions of war in their Magazin, a man would think
there were enough to furnish a whole Nation; In this Arsenal the Ships unload
their Goods laid up in several apartments in the grand Magazin, and afterward
is removed to the house in the old part of the City, as their is occasion for
sale: In the upper part of this large Palace sit the sail Makers at work,
but on the Lower part of this house is an appartment where the Bewinthebbers
assemble upon occasion of Business; This Arsenal is not to be seen by
strangers without a Ticket from the Bewinthebbers; Now al what I have spoaken
of these two houses, or Magazins does only belong unto the Chamber of
Amsterdam; There are yet other Chambers of the Company, who according to their
Quota, or stock in the Company, have the like houses and Magazins, as the
Chambers of Zealand, Delph Rotterdam, Horn and Enkusen. And now I have named
the six Chambers of which the Company is composed, I shall say some thing of
their constitution, which is from an Octroy, or Act of the States General, by
which they have sovereign power over their servants in the Indies, yea their
Authority reaches their servants in all Territoryes of the States General
Donions; It is Death for any of the States subjects to be Interlopers against
this Company, nor may any of what nation soever that lives in any of the
Companyes Territories as Burgers or servants, return into Europe without leave
from the Company, only those called Freemen may depart without askeing leave to
remove; The Grand Council of this Company is the Assembly of the Seventeen,
which are Elected out of the several Chambers before named, that is, eight from
Amsterdam, and four from Zealand: Delph, Rotterdam, Horn and Enkusen send one
a piece, which makes sixteen, and the five lesser Chambers by turns chose the
seventeenth. In the Chamber of Amsterdam there are 20 Bewinthebbers in
ordinary, who are for life, and have 1000 Ducatones a year and spices at
Christmas, and their traveling charges, when they go upon the Companyes
service. The next Chamber is Zealand which has twelve Bewinthebbers, who have
about 250 L. a year and traveling Charges, and Spices at Christmas; The next
is Delph which has seven Bewinthebbers, who have only 120 L. a year and
Traveling Charges and Spices at Christmas: The other Chambers of Rotterdam,
Horn and Enkhusen have seven Bewinthebbers a piece, and the like sallarie,
with traveling Charges and Spices at Christmas, as the Chamber of Delph has.
These Bewinthebbers are Elected or chosen out of those Adventerers called the
high Participanten of the Company; They generally chose such as are rich and
men of parts, and wisdom, most of them being of the Magistratie of the
Country. No man is capable of being Elected a Bewinthebber who has not a 1000
L. stock in the Company. In a word this grand Council of the Seventeen make
laws for the governing the Company, both in India and Europe. It is they that
appoint the days of Sale and what number of Ships each Chamber must send to
the Indies: and likewise order the building of Ships, and all other grand
concerns. This Company is worthily Esteemed a wise, Politic, deserving
Company, spareing no cost to get good Intelligence of affairs, sending
Messengers and Expresses over land to the East Indies: They have their Spies
and Correspondents in all the considerable Trading parts of the world; They
have been so industrious as to gain the Spice Trade, not only from the
Venetians, Spaniards, Portugueses, French, Danes and other Europian nations,
but have also Engrossed all the Spices, so that, as I told you before, they
sell spices to the Indians themselves: but this I must say for them that they
are a Generous Company and gratefully paying respects where it is due, as
lately they have Complemented his Royal highness the Prince of Orange with an
Annual sum out of the profits of their Company, to make him their, friend
and Protector. Neither are they backward in bestowing presents upon strangers
that have obliged them, as I could instance in some of our own Nation: They are
also very charitable to the Poor giveing them the 1000th Gilder of all the
goods they sell; And to all the reformed Ministers in Amsterdam they send
Spices at Christmas, to pray every Sunday for the welfare and prosperitye of
the Company. To conclude this Company is a Buckler and defense for the
Commonwealth upon all urgent occasions: and truly our English East India
Company might be the same to our King, if the Differences between the two
Companyes were composed: Especially now they have such a great King to protect
them, and that the Interlopers are distroyed. And now it is high time I should
tell you the methodes a stranger must take if he has occasion to Keep house in
Amsterdam: If a man will hyer an house, he must take a lease upon sealed paper,
for which you must pay a Tax to the States, and pay the Broaker that makes the
bargen, but before you can buy a house you must be in a capacity to be made a
Burger. To this purpose it is usual to take with you to the Stathouse your
Broaker or any two Securityes, and there before the Burgemasters take the oath
of Burgerschap, which is to be faithful to the City, to the Magistrates and
Government etc. but if you buy either Land or Houses, and lodge privately you
will find your case much worse, Then you must pay a Legion of Taxes to the mils
that draine your Lands, and for maintaining the Banks and Sluices, and if the
States have occasion to build a Fortification on your Lands, or to drowned them
in the time of war, you must be contented with the States Terms, and if your
house or houses stand Empty without Tenants, yet you must pay the States Taxes
on that house or houses; Thus much for the method how you are to be advanced to
be a Burger of Amsterdam, and to give you a taste what you are to pay for houses
or Land, if you settel there, and if you have either purchased or hired an
house then comes an Officer from the Stathouse with a printed sealed paper, who
tells you, you must pay as follows: first a pole tax for every male and female
servant in the house above 8 yares old, six Gilders a year.

For a Coach if you keep one 75 Gilders a year.

For a Coach without wheels 50 Gilders a year.

For soap as the Number of the family is:

The like for salt:

For wine as your Quality is:

To the Rattel watch as your house is in Greatness.

To the Lanthornes as the largenes of the house is.

For Butter every 20 pound seven stivers.

For Beens half as much as you pay for the beens.

For Turff every Tun five stivers.

For every 20 Gilders in wood six Gilders.

For Flesh the Tax often changes:

There is also a Tax on the Bread.

Then there is a Tax called the 200ste penny, and a Tax called the 8th: then
there are many Taxes in Trade, as that no man can weigh or measure out his own
Goods if sold in gross, but the States Officers must do it, Then the States
have a Tax called the Verpounding on all Lands and Houses in their Dominions;
Then they have a Tax on sealed paper, and a Tax for Registering Lands or houses,
likewise a Tax on Cowes, Horses, Calves, and all sort of Fruit. There are many
other Taxes I could name, as a stiver for every man that goes out or into any
City after the houer of shutting the Ports, also you pay for going over some
Bridges, and passing through Gates called Tolhek, a stiver for every persons, but
Coaches, Wagons or Horses pay more; These I have already named; you will say,
are to many, yet I may not forget to tell you, that Milk first pays as Milk,
and again if it be made Butter yea the Buttermilke, and whay pays a Tax
likewise, for all which a man would think that a people that stand so much upon
maintaining of their liberty should mutiny and refuse payment. But this
seldom happens, and if it does the States punish them very severely. I
remember that in my time there was a mutiny at Sardam about paying a new Tax,
whereupon the States sent a Regiment of their Soldiers, and sealed the heads
of the Mutiniers and hanged up 5 or six of them at the Towns end, and severely
whipped 8 under the Gallows; And in the rich City of Amsterdam if any refuse to
pay their Tax, the Magistrates send their Officer to pull of their Doors, and
if they remain long obstinate, they send and fetch away the lower Windows of
their house, and they dare not put up others, until they have paid the Taxes;
Howerer this is observable that if any man will swear he is not worth what he
is taxed at, then he is free: but there are many so proud, that they will not
let the world Know their Condition, I Knew a Merchant named Ornia, who paid
during the war for his 200ste penny and other Taxes for his and his wives
Children, (having had two rich wives) 14000 pound sterlyng: I also knew an
English Anabaptist Merchant who told Mr. Envoye Sidney in my presence, that he
had paid near 4000 L. sterlyng to the war, and yet the same man did Grumble to
pay his Majesty's Consul a pittyfull fee or Consulat money on his Ships: the
reason whereof I once asked him, who answered me that the King could not raise
a penny in England without his Parliament, and therefore much less, could he do
it in the States Country: Thus these Phanaticks had rather make bricks without
straw, then pay the least tribut to their Natural Princes Officer: should we
in England be obliged to pay the Taxes that are here imposed, there would be
Rebellion, upon Rebellion: and yet after all that is here paid no man may bake
his own bread, or grind his own corn, or brew his beer, nor dare any man
keep in his house a hand Mil, althought it be but to grind Mustard or Coffy. I
remember one Mis Guyn a Coffy woman at Rotterdam had like to have been ruined
for grinding her own Coffy, had not Sir Lyonel Jenkins employed his Secretary
Doctor Wyn to entreat the States on her behalf, and it was reckoned a grand
favor that she was only find, and not banished the City, and forfiture made of
all her Goods; I remember also a Landlord of mine in Layden bought a live Pig
in the market and Innocently brough it home, and Killed it, for which he had like
to have been ruinated, because he did not frist send to the accisemen to accise
it, and also let the Visitors see that the Pig was free from deseases. At an
other time a wine Merchant comeing to give me a Visit, told me that he had the
rarest Rhinish in the City, and that if I would send my maid to his Cellar with
six Bottels they should be filled: whereupon I sent the maid only with two
bottels, and charged her to hide them under her apron, but such was her
misfortune that the Scouts Dienaers met her and seized her and her bottels, and
carried her to Prison, which cost the Wine Merchant 1500 Gilders, and had it not
bin for the strongest solicitations made by us, he had bin ruined: so sacred
are Taxes here and must so exactly be paid. And were they not here so precise,
it were Impossible for so small a Country to subsist: And therefore you may
hear the Inhabitants generally say, that what they suffer is for their
Vaderland, hence the meanest among them are content to pay what is laid on
them, for they say all what is the Vaderlands is ours the men of war are
theirs, the sumptuous Magazins, Bridges and every thing what is the Vaderlands.
And indeed in a sense it is so for they have this to Comfort them, that if it
please God to Visit them with Poverty, they and their Children have the public
purse to maintain them, and this is one maine reason why they so willingly pay
their Taxes as they do, for there is not a soul borne in the States Dominions
that wants warm Clothes and Diet; and good lodging, if they make their case
known to the Magistrates; and for the Vagabonds that rove up and down the
streets, they are either Walons or other strangers as pretend to have bin
ruinated by the late wars. I shall now in the next place let you know how
Exellently the laws are here executed against Fraud and perjury, and the
Intention of Murders, which laws were once much used in England, as you shall
hear hereafter when I speak of the Duke of Brandenburgs Court. I shall here
Instance a few particullars that hapened in my time: There was a Spark that
made false assignments on the Admiralty, who tho related to many of the
Magistrates of Amsterdam, had his head cut of; and another who was a Clark in
the Merchants bank, who made false posts in their Books, and had his head also
cut of, and all the Portions he had given with his Daughters, the Husbands were
forced to pay back, and all his houses and Goods were sold at his door in the
open streets; I knew a french Marquis who swore his Regiment was Complete, and
when the States knew that he had not half his Regiment, he likewise had his
head cut of in the Prison in the Hague. I also knew a french Paedagogue a
Runagado Monk who designed to have murdered his master Major Cavellio, and his
two pupils young Children of the Majors, and afterward to set the house a fire
to color the murder, he had his head Cut of and set upon a Post with his body
on a Wheel near the Hague; I could name you two others Cheaters, who were
severely whipped under the Gallows: and two under Farmers who designed to run
away with the States money.

The Cheat of breakeing with a full hand is not so frequent in Holland as in
England (wheresome use it as a way to Slip out of Business and then to live
conveniently afterward upon the Estates of other men) because in Holland they
are more severely punished when discovered, then in England: as on the contraty
those that fall to decay throw losses and unavoidable accidents which they
could not prevent, find a more speedy and easy way of Compounding and
finishing matters with their Creditours if they be over strickt, then the
Custom or law of England, does aford, for the suing out of Statuts of
Bankrupts in England does prouve many times so pernicious both to Creditour and
Debtor throw the tediousnes of the proceedings and the expensivenes of
Executing the Commissions, that what by Commissioners fees, Treatises and other
incident charges, the Creditours are put to such Expenses as to be uterly
disappointed of their Debt, and the Poor Debtors for ever ruinated and undone;
I shall therefore in this place give a short relation of the method used in
Amsterdam in the case of Bankrupts, which perhaps may be taken notice of by our
King and Parliament for the preventing disorders and sad abuses that daily hapen
in Executing the Statutes of Bankrupts; The Magistrates of Amsterdam every
year name Commissioners for Bankrupts, out of those that make up a Judicature,
like to our courts of Aldermen in London; These meet certain days in the
week in a distinct Chamber in the Stathouse over whose door is cut in marble
the Emblem of Fortune flying away with wings, and round chests turned up side
down, with mice and Ratts eateing the money Baggs, Pens, Inkhornes and
Paperbookes. There they receive Petitions from Debtors and Creditours, and as
occasion requires summon the parties to appear before them, and to lay open
the true State of the matter: This done they either by authority seize the
Bankrupts Books and Effects, or Else without any stir and noise leave all
remaining in the Debtors houses, and send thither two Committes to examine the
Books, and make an inventorie of the Estate; with power to compose the matter,
without giveing much trouble to the parties. If the Comissioners find that the
Debtor is come to decay by unexpected losses and unavoidable accidents, to
which he did not at all contribute, it is their usual way to propose to the
Creditour such amicable and easy terms, as the poor man may be able to
perform, alotting some times the halse of the Estate left to the Debtor, some
times a third part, and some times persuading the Crediteurs to advance to the
poor man a sum of money to help him up again in Trade, upon condition that he
do oblige himself to pay the Creditours all he owes them, when God shall be
pleased to make him able; but on the Contrary if the Commissioners find that a
Trader has dealt Knavishly and broaken with a design to defraud and cheat his
Creditours, as if it appear that a Bankrupt has kept false books, and
counterfitted bills of Exchange, Bills of Loading, or pretended Commissions
from foreign parts; In such a case they are very severe and not only seize
all the Books and Effects of the Bankrupt, but also Imprison him, and also
punish him Corporally, and if the cheat be of an heinous nature, sentence him
sometime to death, whereas if the Debtor be only unfortunate and no ways
knaveish, then the Commissaries use all the Power they have to force the
Creditours to accept the Poor man's terms, the which is better for the
Creditours then to use the Rigor of the law, in committing the Poor man to
Prison, seeing in that case the Creditours must maintain him in Prison
according to his quality, where if he lies a certain time, and the Creditours
be not able to prove (...) Prisoner has an Estate, then the Debtor is admitted
to his oath to swear he is not worth 40 Gilders besides his weareing Clothes,
and working Tools, and then he is set at liberty, but in the mean time let
the Prisoner have a care not to make a false Oath, for then he is punished
without mercy, an Instance of which hapened in my time.

The States having admitted a certain Jew to come and make such an Oath
before them, were at the same time Informed* by the Jailer that this Jew had
been seen throw the chinks of the Door, quilting Ducats of Gould and some
Diamons in his Clothes, to the Value of 5000 Gilders The States hereupon
admonished the Jew to take heed to what he was about to swear, because the law
was very strickt against such as made false oaths before them, and at the same
time caused the oath and the Law to be ^ead unto him, nevertheless the Jew
oftered to take the oath, but the Lords not suffering him to swear, because
then he must dye by Law, caused him to be taken out into another room and
searched, where they found about him the Ducats and Diamonts: this being told
the Lords they sent for him in, and then Sentenced him to have 60 lashes under
the Gallows and to be banished the Country, yet because the Jew had many
Children, they gave a 3d part of what was taken about him to his wife and
Children, and a third to the Poor, and the other 3d to the Creditours, which
was enough to pay them their Debt; These Commissiorers are paid by the States
and have not a doit from Debtors, or Creditours for all what they do. These
Commissioners are also much to be commended for their readynes to do good
Offices to those Poor Merchants, Who having lived honestly, are brought to
decay by losles and Crosses in their Trade: who when they find any such so
Poor that they can neither pay their Creditours, nor maintain the charge of
their Families, it is their constant Custom, to take their Children from them,
and maintain and bring them up in their Hospitalls, yea often also soliciting
the Burgemasters on their behalf to bestow some small Office upon them for
their Relief, and Subsistence; And here I must not omit to aquaint you, that
as the Compounding of matters in Holland betwixt Debtor and Creditour so as
has been said, is very easy and equitable, so is also their way or method of
sueing for Debts very favorable, which is after this manner, In the first place
a note or summons is left at the Debtors house, and if he nectlect to appear,
a second summons is sent, but then if he neither appear himself, or send his
Proctor, the sheriffs order an arrest against him, and at last when he it
brought before them, if the matter be difficult it is referred to two or three
Goodmen of the City, and time given him, but if the plaintiff make Oath that he
apprehends the Debtor has a design to run away, then must the Prisoner either
give bail or return to Prison. It is a remark that I have made in my Travells,
that excepting France and Flanders I never saw in any Prison above 40 Prisoners
for debt at one time, and in some great Towns as in Harlem and other, some
times not one; And the reason hereof is plain, for you cannot lay a man in
Prison for an Action or debt, small, or great, but you must maintain the
Prisoner, so that many times the charges exceed the principal Debt, and after
all the Prisoner can free himself; Whereas the Custom in England encouraged
by those Varlets the Pettyfogers and Catchpoles of turning a man into Prison
for a Crown, or it may be for nothing at all, if he connot find Bail, he may
lie and starve there, is an abominable abuse, as also that of suborning false
Witnesses, to much in use in England, which is Extremely cried out against
Beyond sea. And now because I am Speakeing of Pettyfogers, give me leave to
tell you a story I met with when I lived in Rome, goeing with a Roman to see
some Antiquityes, he showed me a Chapel dedicated to one St Evona a Lawyer of
Brittanie who he said came to Rome to Entreat the Pope to give the Lawyers of
Brittanie a Patron, to which the Pope replied that he knew of no Saint but what
was disposed of to other Professions, at which Evona was very sad and earnestly
begd of the Pope to think of one for them: At the last the Pope proposed to St
Evona that he should go round the Church of St. John de Latera blind fould,
and after he had said so many Ave Marias, that the first Saint he laid hold of,
should be his Patron, which the good old Lawyer willingly undertook, and at the
end of his Ave Maryes, he stopped at St. Michels Altar, where he laid hold of the
Devil, under St. Michels feet, and cried out, this is our Saint, let him be our
Patron, so being unblindfolded and seeing what a Patron he had chosen, he went
to his Lodgings so dejected, that in few months after he die'd and coming to
heavens Gates knocked hard, whereupon St Peoter asked who it was that knocked so
bouldly, he replied, that he was St. Evona the Advocate, Away, away said St.
Peter here is but one Advocate in heaven, here is no room for you Lawyers, O
but said St. Evona, I am that honest lawyer who never took fees on both sides,
or ever pleaded in a bad Cause, nor did I ever set my Naibours together by the
Ears, or lived by the sins of the people; well then said St. Peter, come in;
This news comeing down to Rome a witty Poet writ upon St. Evonas Tomb these
words: St. Evona us Briton, Advocat non Larron, Haleluiah. This Story put me in
mind of Ben: Johnson goeing throw a Church in Surry, seeing Poor people
weeping over a Grave, asked one of the women why they wept, Oh said she, we
have lost our precious Lawyer, Justice Randall, he kept us all in peace, and
always was so good as to keep us from goeing to law, the best man ever lived,
well said Ben Johnson I will send you an Epitaph to write upon his Tomb, which
was, God works wonders now and than,
Here lies a Lawyer an honestman.


And trully old Ben: was in the right, for in my time I have observed some
Gentlemen of that profession that have not Acted like St. Evona, or Justice
Randal, I will say no more of them, but wish them as great fees, and as much
encouragement as the Lawyers have in Switserland.

I now come to speak some thing of the three Taxes I mentioned in the former
part of my remarques on Taxes, of which the first ought rather to be called an
useful and public invention, like to that of the Insurance Office in London,
then a public Tax, seeing no man needs contribute to it unless they please,
and find his profit by it, but the other may be called Taxes because the
subjects are obliged to submit to them, but then they are so easy, that what
the Public gets thereby not only lessons Extraordinary subsidies, which many
times occasions clamor, when because of their raritie and the urgencie of
occasions, they must needs be great.

Yet it is sufficently compensated by the advantage and security in the
Estates which private persons, who are obliged to pay it, reap thereby daily;
I am confident that if the King and Parliament thought fit to introduce some or
all three of these taxes into England, the public charge of Government might be
defrayed with more ease and with less repining and clamor, then when it must
be done by new and high Impositions, how ever our Governers are the proper
Judges of that.

The first then is an House called the merchants Bank which is governed by
diverse Commissioners, Clarks and Book keepers, likewise a Essaymaster who
Judges of the Gould and Silver, that at any time is brought into the Bank
uncoyned, the security given for preservation thereof, are the States and
Magistrates of Amsterdam. Now if you have a mind to put money into the Bank,
suppose a 1000 L. less or more, you must go to the Clarks and ask a folio for
your name, and then pay in your money at three or four per cent according as
the rate of the Bank money is high or low, or you may buy it of those called
Cashiers or Broakers: then get the Clarks to set down in the folio what you
bring in, having done so you may draw this sum, or sell it in what parcels
you please, but then if you let your money lie seven years in the Bank, you
receive no Intrest for the same. If you ask where then is the advantage for
the Merchants? I answer first you have your money ready at all times for
answering bills of Exchange, and making other payments: you are at no charge
for baggs or portage, at no loss by false tale or bad money, in no danger of
Thieves or unfaithful servants, or fire, and above all you have the accounts
of your cash most punctually and Justly kept without any trouble or running the
risk of Gouldsmith or Cashieres breaking in your Debt; for such is their care
that twice a year, or some times oftener they shut up the Bank for 14 days,
and then all that have concerns therein must bring in their accounts to the
Clerks, who a few days after, having viewed the Books, aquaint such as have
brought in wrong accounts with their mistakes, desiring them to return to
their books, and rectify their Error, not telling them wherein the mistake
lies, so that I have known Merchants, in my time sent back three or four
times, with their wrong accounts: but if they begin to grow Impatient and say
that they will stand to their accounts, then they pay a mulct to the Clerks
upon their Covincing them of their mistakes, either by chargeing to much upon
the Bank, or forgetting or omitting what was their due. I knew two Merchants,
who having forgott the one 750 L. and the other 220 L. in their accounts, were
honestly rectified by the Clerks, so that they susstained no loss; besides
this care of the Clerks in keeping and Stating the accounts, the bank is
obliged for five L. a year to send to every Merchant, that desires it, their
accounts every morning before Exchange time, of the moneys written of by them
in the Bank the day before upon any Merchants account, and what sums are
written of by others upon their accounts: so that the Merchants may compare the
Banks notes with their books and so save much of the charges of Book kee- Now
if it be objected that though this be an advantage to the Merchants, yet what
can the Public gain thereby, seeing the Charges of paying Officers, Clarks
etc. must needs be very considerable? I answer, that indeed it is a mystery to
those who understand not the thing, but if it were once known and practiced,
the advantage of it would appear; For among other things which might be said,
The Magistrates of the City take out of the Merchants Bank a Sufficent stock
of money to supply the Lumbert, a Banck that Lends out money, and is Governed
by 4 Commissioners chosen out of the Magistrates, who sit in Court every day
in the Lumbert, which is a large pile of Building 300 foot long, containing
several Chambers and magazines under one Roof, in these several Chambers the
Commissioners have Officers sitting tolend money upon all sorts of Goods even
from a paires of shoes to the richest Jewel etc. This is a great convenicence
for Poor people, yea for Merchants also, who some times may want money to pay
a bill of Exchange, and prevents the Cheatting and Extraordinary Extortion used
by the Pawn brokers in England, France and other Countries. And besides the
Poor have their Pawns safely and well preserved, neither are they punctually
sold when the year is out or denied under the pretext of being mislaid, as
the Poor are often times served by the wicked Pawn broakers. There is also
another convenience in this Lumbert viz, an Exellent way they have of
discovering Thieves, and the stolen goods; They publish two general open
sales of the Goods pawnd twice a year, that such as will, may redeem their
goods and paying the Intrest may have them although the time be relapsed. Thus
much as to the Lumbert. I was once according to my duty to wait upon our
present King at the Bank of Merchants, where showing his Majesty the way of
keeping the Journall Book of the Bank which is of a prodigious bigness, his
Majesty was Extremely pleased with the Contrivance of preserveing it from
fire; saying that the course they took might be of great use for the
preserving Patents and the deeds of Noblemens Estates; This contrivance which
perhaps may be thought useful or imitable, I shall therefore discribe it, It
is a large firestone shaped like a Chest, and set upright in a stone wall
having a large brass door of a Vast thicknes with flops to fall over and Cover
the Lock and Hinges, into this chest the Book is drawn upon Rouls, it being of
such a Bulk and weight as cannot be handed in by a man, and there it is so
securely preserved that although the house should be burnt, the Book in all
probability would be safe; Should I here give an account of the Vast sums of
money that daily are written of in this Bank, I might probably be thought to
speak at Random, but this I may bouldly affirm that it far Exceeds all the
Banks in Europe, both for Riches and Business, and their Credit is such that
the Italians, French, Germans and English have great sums in the same,
neither was ever any man refused his money in the worst of times.

A second Tax is what arises from the just and laudable Establishment of a
Register, A Tax which I think most men will be willing to submit to, Except
such as design to cheat and defraud their Naibours, and live by such like sins
and Confusion, and for the most part die with the curse of the people; This
Register in Holland begitts such assurance and Safety in dealling, that in
purchasing of houses or land, a Child tho overreached in the Value yet cannot
be cheated as to the title: The methodes of which Register. I have by me for
the use of our King and Parliament when they please to Command it.

The third and last Tax is that of sealed paper as it is practiced in Holland.
The Method of which I likewise keep by me for his Majesty and Parlements
Commands. There are many other things might be spoken, as to the Government of
Amsterdam, but I may not tire your patience. However one considerable thing I
would not pass by touching the Melitia; There are in Amsterdam 60 Companyes of
Foot, the least of them having 200 men, some 300, which in a modest account,
amounts, at least to 15000 men, in which number neither Jews nor Anabaptists
who carry no Arms are reckned, only they are obliged to Contribute to the
maintenance of the 1400 Soldiers who are kept in Constant pay, as a Guard for
the City, and toward the night watch or Ratelwatch, who walk the streets the
whole night to keep good Orders, and tell us every half hour what a Clock it
is. There are also upon every Church Tower, Trumpetters who sound every half
hour, and if any fire breaks out in the City they give a Signal on which
side of the City the fire is, and ring the Firebell, and they have Exellent
ways on a sudden in such sad accidents to Quench Fire: but I may not enlarge
any longer, but hasten out of Holland. And yet before I leave Amsterdam I must
vindicate her from a malicious aspersion cast upon her by the Ignorant, they
accuse her to have very rudely and uncivilly affronted the Duke of York being
there. Anno 1681 All which is very false, True the English Phanaticks of
Amsterdam were so maliciously wicked as to spread several lies of his Sacred
Person, and stird up the Canalie as much as they could to affront his Highness,
but as for the Magistrates they paid him very great respects; first sending me
to the Hague to know what day his Highness would please to honor their City
with his presence, that thereby they might be prepared to receive his Royal
person with all the honor emaginable, being resolved to Treat his Highness in
their Stathouse, and that the Burgers should be in their Arms, also giveing
out orders for Coaches and the Admiraltys Yagts to attend his Highness, when
ever he pleased to come, but his Highness, by Colonel werden let me know that I
should attend the Burgemasters, and thank them for their kind presentation, but
his Highness was resolved to see their City incognito and therefore desired the
Burgemasters not to put themselves to any manner of Trouble; Notwithstanding the
Magistrates Commanded their Yatchts to lie ready the halfeway Harlem, and Vice
Admiral de Ruiter, Dirick Tulp, and others went out in their Coaches to meet
his Highness, and conduct him into the City, at which time our English
Phanaticks Especially those called Monmouths twelve Apostels did all that they
could to stir up the rude multitude to affront his Highness, crying out to them,
This is he that brought the last war upon you, and with his Jesuits would cut
all the Protestants Throats; But the next day after his Highness was com into
the City Burgemaster Valkenier the great Solon of Amsterdam, sent for me and
could me that although the Burgemasters which are the Sovereigns of the City
give no Visits to strange Princes, unless they be Crouned heads, yet said he I
have a great Ambition to pay a Visit to the Duke of York, upon several
respects, first as being the brother of so great a King, and as he is our
Statholders Vnckell and Father in law, and therefore said he you shall procure
me Audience in the privatest manner imaginable: for I design to go with you to
him without so much as a footman attending me; here upon I waitted upon the
Earl of Peterborow and Colonel Werden and Colonel Porter to desire them to
aquaint his Highness with the Burgemasters design, whereupon his Highness turned
to me, and said Mr. Carr when the Burgemaster pleases, whereupon I went
immediately to the Burgemaster and attended him to his Highness quarters, the
news whereof comeing to the Citizens, they gathered together in great
Multitudes to see whether this great man their Petty God did humble himself so
far, as to pay a Visit to his Highness, whereas the other Burgemasters only sent
a Secretary and one of there Pensionaries to Visit the Duke of Monmouth, and
all Ambassandors have no other Complement but by Secretaries or Pensionaries;
After the Burgemaster had had a long hours Audience with the Duke in a Room a
part, I attended the Burgemaster to his Daughter Pelicorns house, the which was
near his Highness Lodgings, for the Tumult of the Burgers was so great, that
the Burgemaster did not care to pas by them, and being come into his daughters
Parler, he began to speak to me after this manner, Sir, I never in all my life
met with a Prince so generally Experienced in all things, a Prince that has
far penetrated into the affairs of Europe, and has the right measures of the
present State of our Country, and discourses as if he sat in our Council, but
above all I was mightly pleased to hear him declare himself so freely
touching Liberty of Conscience commending the wisdom of our State in Opening
their Gates to all tender Consciences, and that is it, said his Highness, that
makes you so considerable and enticeth the Rich Merchants of other places to
come and live amongst you, whereas the folly of the Spanish Inquisition hunts
away the chiefest of their Traders the Jews and others; For my part said his
Highness, I never was for oppressing tender Consciences in England: for nothing
more disturbs the peace and quiet thereof then forceing men by Pe^d Laws to
become all of one Religion, To conclude, said the Burgemaster do but, Remark
this one thing and remember it, if you out live me, viz, that if ever this
great Prince come to be King of England he will alter all the Measures of
Europe, and possible become the Arbiter thereof: After which discourse the
Burgemaster said let me now present you, mijn Here Consul. with a Glass of
Rhenith wine to his Highness health, and pray when you have an Opportunity to
speak with his Highness, assure him that he (...) in Amsterdam a true and
faithful friend, and moreover he said, when I speak next with our Statholder
the Prince of Orange, and our Pensionarie Fagel, I will do his Highness
Justice; and thus we parted: but the civil deportment of this Burgamaster was
not all, for other great ones of the City did their part also, as Vice Admiral
de Ruiter, with at least 30 Captains of the Admiralty Chamber of Amsterdam
attended his Highness to show him the Men of war and Magazins of the Admiralty:
likewise Sir Dirick Tulp and the Here Peter van Dan^ and others the
Bewinthebbers of the East India Company attended his Highness to the East-Indie
House, where was spread a Banquet of Sweetmeats, and rich Wines, and they
offered his Highness a present, but his highness would not accept of any, only
two large Books in which were Painted all the Beasts, Fishes, and Fowls, and
likewise all the Plants, Flowers, and Fruits of the East Indies, and because
his Highness had tasted the Mum in the East-Indie Magazine, and liked it, the
Company caused twelve Caskes, to be neatly hoopt, and gave me them to be sent
after his Highness to Brussels; And I know it was the resolution of the
Bewinthebbers to have spared no cost if his Highness would have accepted of a
Treat in their house, by all which you see that the Magistrates and chief men
in Amsterdam were not guilty of Rudenes to his Highness, but it was the Canalie.
And now having said so much good of the States Government, and of Amsterdam in
particular, it will not be amiss to take notice of some Bad customs and
practices now in vogue in Holland, and leave it to the reader to Judge what
they may portend; There are tolerated in the City of Amsterdam, amongst other
abuses, at least 50 Music houses, where lewd Persons of both sexs meet and
practice their villainies. There is also a place called the Longseller a
Tolerated Exchange or public meeting house for whores and Rogues to Rendevous
in, and make their filthy Bargains: This Exchange is open from six a clock
afterdinner until nine at night; Every whore must pay three stivers at the
door for her entrance or admission; I confess the Ministers preach and exclaim
from the pulpit against this horrible abuse, but who they be that Protect them
I know not, yet I have heard some plead for the tolleration of these wicked
meetings upon pretext, that when the East India fleets come home, the Seamen
are so mad for women, that if they had not such houses to bait in, they would
force the very Cittyzens wives and Daughters: but it is well known that as
money does countenance, so Discipline might suppress that abuse. The old
severe and frugall way of Liveing is now almost quite out of Date in Holland,
there is very littell to be seen of that sober modesty in Apparel, Diet, and
habitations as formerly: In stead of Convenient Dwellings the Hollandtrs now
build Stately palaces, have their delightful Gardens, and houses of pleasure,
keep Coaches, wagons and sleas, have very rich furniture for their horses with
Trappings-adorned with silver Bells, I have seen the Vanity of a Vintners
son, who had the bosses of the bit and Trapping of his horse of pure silver,
his footman and Coachman having silver fringd Gloves; yea so much is the humor
of the women altered and of their Children also that no Apparel can now serve
them but the best and richest, that France and other Countries affoards, and
their sonns are so much adicted to play, that many families in Amsterdam are
ruined by it not that England is less Extravagant then the Duch, who as I said
before got such great Estates by their frugalitie, whilst they were not
addicted to such prodigality and wantonness as the English are, whose excess
I can not excuse, nevertheless the grave and sober people of Holland are very
sensible of the great alteration that now is in their Country, and as they say
Paracelsus used to cure his patients of their disease with a full belly, so a
good Burgemaster desirous to convince his Amsterdammers of their dissolute kind
of lif^ invited the Thirty six Magistrates and their wives to a feast: who
being come and the Ladies big with Expectation of some rare and Extraordinary
Entertainment, sat down at table; where the first course was Buttermilk boild
with Appells, Stockfish, Buttered Turnips and Carrots, lettice Salade and red
Herrings, and only small bear without any Wine; At this the Ladies startled
and began to whisper to their husbands, that they Expected no such
Entertainment, but upon removing of the Dishes and plates they found
underneath printed verses Importing that after that manner of liveing they
began to thrive, and had enlarged their City.

The second course consisted of Bocke de kooks, quarters of Lamb, roasted Rabits
and a sort of pudding they call a Brother here they had Dorts and English bear
with French wine yet all this did not please the dainty Dames: but upon
removing away the plates another Dish of poetry appeared, which acquainted
them that after that modest and sober way of Liveing, they might keep what they
had got, and lay up some thing for their Children.

Then comes in the third course made up of all the rarities of the season, as
Patridges, Pheseants and all sorts of foul and English pasties, with plenty of
Rinish and other sorts of wine, to moisten them, this put the ladies in a
frolic and Jolly humor, but under their plates was found the use and
Application in verses, telling them that to feed after that manner was
Voluptuous and Luxurious, and would Impair their health and wast their
Estates, make them neglect their Trade, and so in Time reduce their Stately and
new built flourishing City to their old fishing town again. After this was
brought in a Banquet of all sorts of sweet meats piled up in piramides and
delicate fruit with plenty of delitious wynes, and to conclude all a set of
Music and maskers who danced with the young Ladies; but at parting like the
hand writing to Belteshazzar upon the wall, every one had a printed paper of
moralities put into their hand showing them the causes of the ruin of the
Roman Commonwealth, according to that of the Poet.

Nullum crimen abest, facinusque libidinis ex quo,
Paupertas Roman a perit.
with an Excellent advice to them that if they did not quit the Buffoneries and
apish modes of the French, and return to the Simplicity, plaineness and
modesty of their Ancestors and founders, their Commonwealth could not long
last; but all the thanks the good old Burgemaster had for his kind and
Chargable Entertainment in thus feasting his Countrymen, was to be sloutted at,
and pasquild, The sparks of Amsterdam saying in all places, that the old man
being now past the years of pleasure himself, would have none others to take
theirs; And here I shall put a period to what I thought fit to observe of the
States of the United Provinces only I will beg leave, to say something to the
Hollander by way of advise viz, That now they are in a prosperous condition,
Rich and at ease, They would look back and remember what God in his Infinite
goodness and mercy did for them in the days of their greatest calamities; for
my own part I cannot but admire the great providence of God in preserveing
them from being devoured by their many Enemies they had in the last war,
besides their enemies at home, some of which particulars as they then happened,
give me leave to relate. At the time when the French came to Invade the
Territoryes of the States General, it then looked as if God had markd out the
way for the French to March, by sending such a wonderful dry season that the
Rivers of the Rhine, Beta, Wall, and other Rivers were fordable, so that the
French only waded throw, and became so Victorious, that in a little space of
time (what by the Treasons of some, and the Ignorance, and cowardice of others
Entrusted with the Militia, and Garrisons) the French became Masters of above
40 Cittyes and Garrisons, at which time there was nothing to be heard of in the
States Dominions but confusion and misery, even in the strong and rich City
of Amsterdam it self, who at this time beheld the French Army like a mighty
Torrent comeing within sight of the City, and at the same time wanting water
in their Canalls, and Burgwalls to ply their Sluices, and such was the scarcity
of Rain that a payle of fresh water was worth 6 pence; Thus heaven seemed to
frown on them as well as the French Army, by the shutting up as it were the
Conduits of Heaven, and yet a worse thing had like to have fallen out, for at
the same time the Divisions grew so high amongst the Magistrates in the
Stathouse, that it was putting to the Question wheather or no they should not
go and meet the French King with the Keys of their City, to save it from
fire, and Plunder, now nothing in all probability could save this rich City
from falling into the hands of the French, but an immediate hand from Heaven,
and it had undoubtedly come to pass, had not providence caused the French to
make a stand at Muyden, two hours from Amsterdam, at what time the Valiant
Roman of Amsterdam Scout Hasselaer like a true father of his Country opposed
the French party in the Council, calling out to the Burgers from the Stathouse
to take Courage and rather choose to dye like old Battavians with their swords
in their hands, then tamely and Treacherously to yeald up their City to the
mercy of the French, as some of the Magestrates were about to do, this so
Encouraged the Burgers that with great Courage they mand' the walls, and heaven
then assisting them with a suden and plenty full rain, that they plyd their
sluices, and drouned the Lands round the City 3 and 4 foot high, in some
places, which caused the Victorious French Army to make a quick retreat, as
far as Utrick, else the Monsieur had paid dear for seeing of Amsterdam; Thus
was Amsterdam delivered by the hand of Heaven.

A second was, when that Bloody Duke of Luxenburg, who gloryed and thanked God
that he was borne without pity or remors of Conscience, took the opportunitye
of an exceeding hard frost to march his Army over the Ice as it had been dry
ground, burning in his way the three fair Villages of Bodygrave, Swammerdam
and Goudse-sluys. Acting there a more cruel Tradigie and worse then ever did
Turk, for they Generally save the Country people for Ransom, but this cruel
Prince caused strong Guards to surround the villages, and burnd men, Women and
Children together, Thus he began his march with a design to burn Leyden,
Hague, Rotterdam, Delph and all the rich Country of Rhineland: and this he
might have done in all probability, for first the Governor of Newsluce who
commanded the post that should have stopped the French, Treacherously delivered
up the fort without firing a Gunn, and the handful of Troops then under
General Koningsmark were so Inconsiderable that they joined to the Soldiers
under Pain and Vin the Governer of new Sluice were not Able to make head as
could oppose Luxenburgs Army, and at the same time the good Prince of Orange
was with the States Army at Charle le Roy. Now was Leyden ready to meet the
French with the Keys of their City, and other Cittyes too, for they had
neither fortifications nor Soldiers to man their walls; Thus the whole Country
and Cittyes of Rhineland were like to fall under the Crueltyes and Tyranny of
the French, but God a second time sent these people relief from Heaven, first
by giveing such undanted Courage to that great States man Pensionarie Fagel
that he forced Koningsmark to Rally his Troops together and to make a Stand
near Leyden, offering himself to dye at the head of them if there were
occasion, but God reserved him for a further good to the Commonwealth by sending
such a sudden Thaw as was never seen before, for in less then ten hours the
Ice so sunk and such Floods of snow came down from the high lands that the
French were fain to make a very disorderly retreat, Marching up to the middel
for have, because on the Banks there could not march above four men a breast, so
they were constrained to leave behind them the greatest part of the Plunder
they had robed from the Innocent Country people, and the nimble Duch men on
their Sca^ses so long as the Ice would bear them, did shoot down the French
like Ducks diving under water, so that it cost Luxenburgs Army dear, tho they
had the pleasure to burn the poor people, of which the French afterward
wickedly made their boast.

The third was as wonderful as the two others, and although I do not believe
miracles, as do the Papists, yet I say nothing I ever observed looked more
like a Miracle then this, to wit, when the English and French Fleet lay before
Scheveling with a design to land, and the French ready on their March to join
with the English and other French as soon as they should land, at the same time
the Bishop of Munster lyeing before Groeningen, and the French before Gorcom,
so that now all things looked with a dreadful face for the States, yet at this
very time God sent a 3d relief by sending such Mists, and wonderful sorts of
Tides, as so separated the two Fleets, that the English were forced to quit
Scheveling shore, and were driven on the side of the Texel Road; from whence
they were constrained by the season of the year to retire home, and such were
the sudden and great showers of rain that the Bishop of Munster was forced in
disorder to raise his siege at Groeningen, and the French to quit Gorcom; I
could ad many more observations of the Providence of God to these people, as
the preserveing the Prince of Orange from the many treacherous designs
contrived against him from his Cradel, but Moses must be preserved, to go in
and out before his people, certainly never young Prince Endured so many
fatigues as did his Highness in his tender years, of which I was an eye witness,
and had his Highness had the years and Experience, and such a good disciplinde
Army (as now he has) in the year 1671 when the French Entered the Country,
his Highness had given them as good a welcome as he did at Bergen. I will say no
more of this subject only this, that the peace at Nimwegen was also a very
wonderful thing, for that not above 8 days before the peace was signed, most
of the Plenipotentiaries did believe the war would have continued another
year; first because the King of Denmark and Duke of Brandenburg prospered
Exceedingly against Sweedland, and totally refused the propositions of France,
and secondly because the French King writ such Bitter letters against the
States General: yet 8 days after dressed a letter unto the States in which he
calls them his good friends, and old Allies, offering them not only Mastricht
but every foot of ground they could lay claim to in the world, also giveing
them new Terms, and Conditions as to their privileges in France, by way of
Trade; Neither can I forget how speedily and as strangly the mighty French
King did quit his Conquered Towns after the Valiant Prince of Orange took
Naerden, which was the first step to the Frenchs ruin in the States Dominions.
I come now, according to promess in the beginning of this book, to give the
reader some Remarkes I made in other Countries where I have been during my
sixteen years travels. To give a full account of all that might be observed in
so many Countries, is not a task for one man, nor a subject for so small a
book; I shall only therefore briefly take notice of some remarkable matters
which may in some measure satisfy the curiosity of my Country men who have
not been in the said places, and convince, if possible, all of them, that no
Country that ever I was in, afords so great conveniences for the generality
of people to live in, as the Kingdom of England does. Though I have twice made
the grand tour of Germany, Hungary, Italy and France, and after my return back
to England traveled a third time through Holland as for as Strasbourg, and so
back by Francfort to Denmark and Sweden; yet the reader is not to expect I
should follow a Geographicall method and order in speaking of the places I have
been in; that is to be looked for in the map, and not in travels; but only that
I mention places as I found them on my rode according as business or curiosity
led me to travel.

The first considerable place I then met with, after I was out of the dominions
of the States General was Cleave the capital city of the Province so called, a
fair and lovely city standing upon the Rhine and the rivers Wall and Le^k.
This Province much resembles England in rich soil and pleasantness of its
rivers. The inhabitants of the Country would have me believe that they were
originally descended of those Saxons who made a descent in to England, and
conquered it; and to convince the truth of this, they showed me a cloister
standing on a hill, called Eltham, from which they say our Eltham in Kent had
its name. I was made to observe also two places standing upon the Rhine near
Emmerick called Doadford, and Gron^wich, which according to them, gave the
names to Dedford and Greenwich in England; but many such analogies and
similitudes of names are to be found in other places of Germany, but especially
in uper Saxony and Denmark. The greatest part of this Province of Cleave, and
part of the duchy's of Julieres and Berg, and of the Provinces of Mark and
Ravensbourg belongs to the Elector of Brandenbourg, the rest belonging to the
Duke of Newbourg now Elector Palatine, and the Elector of Cologne. The
inhabitants are partly Roman Catholics, partly Lutherans, and partly
Calvinists, who all live promiscuously and peaceably together both in city and
Country. The city of Cleave is the out most limit of the territories of the
Elector of Brandenbourg on this side of Germany; from whence his Electorall
Highness can travel two hundred dutch miles out right in his own Dominions, and
never sleep out of his own Country but one night in the territories of the
Bishop of Osnabrug.

From Cleave I went to a small town called Rhinberg, but a very strong
fortification belonging to the Elector of Cologne; which dies at two miles
distance from the city of Wesel that belongs to the Elector of Brandenbourg.
Through Disseldorpe: situated on the Rhine, and the Residence of the duke of
Newbourg, I went next to Cologne a very large city, called by the Romans
Colonia Agrippina, and the French Rome d'Allemagne.

Cologne is an Imperial city and a Republic, though for some things it does
Homage to the Elector of that name, and receives an oath from him. It is much
decayed within these hundred years, having been much priest ridden, a
misfortune that has undone many other great cities. The Jesuits have had so
great influence upon the Magistrates, that they prevailed with them to banish
all Protestants, who removed to Hambourg and Amsterdam, so that Cologne is
become so dispeopled, that the houses daily fall to ruin for want of
inhabitants, and a great deal of corn and wine now grows within the walls, upon
ground where houses formerly stood. I dare be bold to affirm that there is
twice the number of inhabitants in the parish of St. Martins in the fields,
then there is in Cologne; and yet it contains as many parish churches,
monasteries and chapels, as there are days in the year. The streets are very
large, and so are the houses also, in many of which one may drive a Coach or
wagon into the first room from the streets; but the streets are so thin of
people, that one may pass some of them and not meet ten men or women, unless it
be Church men or Religious sisters. The most considerable inhabitants of the
city are Protestant Merchants, tho but few in number, and they not allowed a
Church neither, but a place called Woullin a mile without the city: the rest
of the inhabitants who are lay men are miserably poor. There are no less than
3000 Students in Cologne taught by the Jesuits gratis, who have the privilege
to beg in musical notes in the day time, and take to them selves the liberty
of borrowing hats and cloaks in the night: but if in the Jesuits Schools there
be any rich Burgemasters sons who have parts, they are sure to be snapt up and
adopted into the society. Formerly, before the matter was otherwise adjusted
in the diet of Ratisbonne, there have been designs of voteing Protestant
Magistrates into the government again; but so soon as the Jesuits come to
discover who of the Magistrates were for that, they immediately preferred their
sons or daughters, and made them chanons, abbots or chanonesses, and so
diverted them by interest. It Is pity to see a city so famous for traffike in
former times now brought to so great a decay, that were it not for the trade of
Rhenish wine it would be utterly forsaken, and left wholly to the Church men.
The continual alarms the Magistrates have had by foreign designs upon their
liberty, and the jealousies fomented among themselfs, as it is thought, by the
Agents and favorers of France, and especially the Bishop of Strasbourg, have
for several years kept them in continual disquiet, and necessitated them to
raise great taxes which has not a little contributed to the impoverishing of
the people especially the boars round about; who tho the Country they live in
be one of the most pleasant and fertile plains of Germany, yet are so
wretchedly poor that canvas clothes, wooden shoes, and straw to sleep on in the
same room with their beasts, is the greatest worldly happiness that most of
them can attain unto. The Elector of Cologne is a venerable old man, Bishop of
four great bishoprics, viz Cologne, Liege, Munster, and Heldershime. He
divides his time betwixt his devotion and experimental studies, being punctual
in saying of mass every morning, and constant in his Elaboratory in the
afternoon; for he is much addicted to chemistry, and leaves the administration
of Government to his Cozen the Bishop of Strasbourg. To speak of all the
miracles of the three Kings of Cologne, and the vast number of saints who were
removed out of England and interred there, would be but tedious and perhaps
incredible to the reader, as well as wide of my design. I shall therefore
proceed.

From Cologne I took water on the Rhine and advanced to the city of Bon and so
forward to Coblints the residence of the Elector of Trier. over against this
city, on the other side of the Rhine stands that impregnable fort called
Herminshine, built on a high rocky hill as high again as Windforcastle, and on
the north side of it the River Mosel falls into the Rhine, over which there is
a Stately stone bridge. This Prince governs his subjects as the other
Spiritual Electors do, that is, both by temporal and spiritual authority,
which in that Country is pretty absolute. The chief trade of this Country is
in wine, corn, wood and Iron.

The next Country I came to was that of the Elector of Mayence who is likewise
both a secular and Ecclesiastical Prince and governs his subjects accordingly.
He is reckoned to be wholely for the Interests of the French King; who
notwithstanding of that, pretends a title to the citadel of Mayence. As I was
upon my Journey to Mayence by land, I made a turn down the Rhin to visit the
famous little city of Backrack, and some towns belonging to the Landgrave of
Hessen, but especially Backrack, because Travelers say it much resembles
Jerusalem in its situation and manner of buildings. The Burgemaster of this
city told me that the whole Country about Backrack does not yield above 200
fouders of wine a year; And yet the Merchants of Dort by an art of
multiplication which they have used some years, furnish England with several
thousand of fouders. Here I shall take the liberty to relate a strange story
which I found recorded in this Country; tho I know it to be mentioned in
History. There was a certain cruel and inhumane. Bishop of Mayence, who in a
year of great scarcity and famine when a great number of Poor people came to
his gates begging for bread, caused the Poor wretches, men, women and children
to be put into a barn* under pretext of relieving their necessities; but so
soon as they were got in, caused the barn doors to be shut, fire set to it, and
so burnt them all alive: And whilst the poor wretches cried and shreeked out
for horror and pain, the Barbarous miscreant said to those that were about
him, hark how the Rats and mice do cry. But the just Judgment of God
suffered not the fact to pass unpunished; for not long after the cruel Bishop
was so haunted with Rats and mice, that all the guards he kept about him, could
not secure him from them, neither at table nor in bed, At length he resolved to
flee for safety into a tower that stood in the middle of the Rhine; but the
Rats pursued him, got into his chamber and devoured him alive; so that the
Justice of the Almighty made him a prey to vermin who had inhumanely reckoned
his fellow Christians to be such. The tower which I saw, to this day is called
the Rats-tower, and the story is upon record in the city of Mayence.

On my Journey from thence I came to the little village of Hockom not far
distant, famous for our Hockomore wine, of which though the place does not
produce above 150 fouders a year; yet the Ingenions Hollanders of Dort make
some thousand fouders of it go of, in England and the Indies.

From Hockom I proceeded to Francfort a pleasant city upon the river of Maine,
called formerl^y Teutoburgum and Helenopolis and since Francfort, because here
the Franconians who came out of the Province of Franconia foarded over, when
they went upon their expedition into Gallia, which they conquered and named it
France: and I thought it might very well deserve the name of Petty-London,
because of its Privileges, and the humor of the citizens. It is a Hansiatick
and Imperial town and Commonwealth, the Magistrates being Lutherans which is
the public established Religion; though the Cathedral church belongs to the
Roman Catholics who also have several monasteries there. The city is
populous and frequented by all sorts of Merchants, from most parts of Europe,
and part of Asia also, because of the two great faires that are yearly kept
there, Many Jews live in this city, and the richest Merchants are Calvinists,
who are not suffered to have a Church in the town, but half an hours journey
out of it, at a place called Bucknam, where I have told seventy four Coaches at
a time all belonging to Merchants of the city. It was in ancient times much
enriched by Charle le maigne and has been since by the constitution of the
Golden bull: amongst other honors and Privileges its appointed to be the
place of the Emperors Election, where many of the ornaments belonging to that
August ceremony are to be seen. It is strongly fortified having a stately
stone bridge over the Maine that joins it to Saxehousen the quarter of the
great master of the Toutonick order. The government is easy to the people, they
not being taxed as other cities are, and had it not been for the Alarmes the
French gave them during the last war, they had not been much troubled, but
being forced to keep three or four thousand men in constant pay to defend their
fortifications, the Magistrates were constrained to raise money by a tax.
Besides that of the Emperor, they are under the protection of some
neighboring Princes, as of the Landgrave of Hessen- Cassells, Landgrave of
Armestadt, the Count of Solmes and the count of Hanau, who are either Lutherans
or Calvinists, amongst whom the Late Elector- Palatine was also one; but
whether the present who is Roman Catholic be so or not, I cannot tell. This
city takes great care of their poor, and in their charity to poor travelers
exceed Holland. I have seen a list of seven thousand whom they relieved in one
year. Their great hospital is a large court or palace, where the English
Merchants formerly lived, in the time of Queen mary's persecution of the
Protestants, who when they were recalled by Queen Elisabeth were so generous as
to give the whole court, with all their Packhouses and lands to the poor of the
city. It was my fortune to be there in that cold Winter in the year 1683. and
saw a ceremony performed by the Wine coopers of the city, who are obliged by
law, that when ever the Maine lies fast frozen over for eight days together, to
make a great Fouder fat, Hoops and Staves; and set it up complete upon the Ice.
It was very good diversion to see so many hands at work, and to observe the
jollity and mirth of the many thousands of spectators who wanted not plenty of
Rhenish wine to carouse in.

I had the curiosity afterward to go to the court of the Landgrave of
Armestadt a Lutheran Prince who lives in part of the richest soil in Germany.
His Highness is a very courteous and obligeing Prince to Strangers, and his
subjects are in a pretty good condition again, though they have been great
sufferers by the last war between the Landgrave of Hessen and this family.

From thence I went to Heidleberg a city I had been formerly in, in the life
time of that wise tho unfortunate Prince Elector elder brother to Prince
Rupert. Here I had the Honor to pay-my dutiful respects to the Elector the
son of that great Prince, whose commissary I had the honor to be for two years
together in Amsterdam. This Prince, since my being there, is lately dead, and
left behind him the reputation of having been a Zealous thorough paced
Calvinist, and so constant a frequenter of the church, that some Sundays he
went thrice a day to Sermon; but never failed, if in health, to be once a day
at least at the garrison-church; where he took particular notice of such
officers as were absent. He was married to a most virtuous lady the Royal
sister of the King of Denmark and his brother Prince George. During his life
time the university of Heidleberg flourished exceedingly, so that the number of
students was so great that Chambers and lodgings in the city were scarce, and
Spanhemius was about quitting Leyden to return to his professors place in
Heidleberg, but how matters stand since his death, I am as yet ignorant. This
Country is called the paradise of Germany for its fruitfulness in wine, corn,
and all sorts of fruit. I my self have seen growing in one plain at the same
time, vines, corn, chestnuts, almonds, dates, figs, cherries, besides several
other sorts of fruit. And as the Country is fertile in yielding the fruits of
the Earth, so the people are careful in providing store room for them. This I
take notice of because of the prodigious Rhenish wine fats which are to be seen
there, amongst which there are seven, the least whereof holds the quantity of
250 barells of Beer as I calculated; but the large and most celebrated fat is
that which goes by the name of the great Tun of Heidleberg, and holds 204
fouders of wine, and cost 705 L. Sterling in buildiug, for which one may have a
very good house built. This fat I have seen twice, and the first time was, when
the Elector treated the French Ambassadors that came to conclude the match
betwixt his daughter and Monsieur the French Kings brother, who married her
after the death of our Kings sister his first wife: at which treat there
happened an adventure that I shall here please the Reader with. In a gallery
that is over this fat the Elector caused a table to be placed in the middle,
exactly above the bunghole of this Monstrous vessel, and to be covered with a
costly banquet of all sorts of sweet meats: The day before, all the wine being
emptied out of this Tun into other Fats, a little before the Ambassadors with
other foreign Ministers and Persons of quality mounted the stairs to come to
the place of entertainment; The Elector caused twelve drummers with as many
Trumpeters, some Kettledrums and other music to be lodged in the belly of the
Tun, with orders to strike up upon a signal given, when the Elector drank the
French Kings health. All being sat down at table and merrily feeding, the
Elector drank the health, and the signal was given; whereupon the music began
to play its part with such a roaring and uncouth noise out of that vast cavitie
below, that the French and other Persons of quality who were unacquainted with
the design, looking upon it to be an infernal and ominous sound, in great
astonishment began to cry out Jesu Marie. The worlds at an end, and to shift
every one for himself in so great disorder and confusion, that for haste to be
gone they tumbled down stairs one over another. All that the Elector could say
to compose them, was either not heard or not valued, nor could any thing
satisfy and reassure them, till they saw the Actors com marching out of their
den. Had not many Persons of quality and travelers seen this Fat as well as my
self who know that what I say of its incredible bigness to be true, I should be
afraid the Reader might think I imposed upon his credulity.

From Heidleberg I went to see that impregnable Fort or citadell of Manheim
alias Fredericks-berg built by the Elector Frederick brother to Prince Rupert,
a Prince of as good a head as any Germany affoarded, who though some have too
partially Judged of him by his misfortunes, yet by the wisest of the age was
acconnted the Cato of Germany. The wisest and best-men of the world have been
unfortunate, which makes some to be of the opinion that God in his wisdom
thinks fit it should be so, least otherwise they might attribute their
prosperity rather to the wise direction of their own conduct, then his all
seeing Providence: and indeed, daily experience seems to evince the truth of
this, since we see knaves and fools advanced to preferment and richess, when
men of virtue and parts die neglected and poor in the eyes of the world, though
rich in the enioyment of a contented mind. But this is a digression which the
honor I have for the memory of that great man has led me into, and therefore
I hope will be pardoned by the Reader. In the citadel of Manheim I saw some of
the Records of that illustrious family, which without dispute is the most
ancient of all the Secular Electors, being elder to that of Bavaria which
sprung from one and the same stock, to wit, two Emperors of Germany. Many
writers derive them originally from Charle le maigne, by the line of Pepin King
of France. There have been several Emperors of that race, one King of Denmark
and four Kings of Sweden, one of which was King of Norway also, besides many
great Generals of Armies in Germany, Hungary, France and other Countries. Since
I can remember there vere five Protestant Princes heirs to that Electorall
dignity alive; which now by their death is fallen to the Duke of Nowbourg a
Roman Catholic, whose Daughter is Empress of Germany and another of his
Daughters married to the King of Portugal. Being so near Strasbourg, I had the
curiosity to go see what figure that famous city now made since it had
changed its master; for I had been thrice there before, when it flourished
under the Emperors protection, with the liberty of a Hausiatick town: And
Indeed I found it so disfigured, that had it not been for the stately
Cathedral Church, and fair streets and buildings, I could scarcely have known
it. In the streets and Exchange which formerly were thronged with sober rich
and peaceable Merchants, you meet with none hardly now but men in buff Coats
and scarffs with rabbles of Soldiers their attendants. The churches I confess
are gayer, but not so much frequented by the inhabitants as heretofore, seeing
the Lutherans are thrust into the meanest churches and most of the chief
Merchants both Lutherans and Calvinists removed to Holland and Hambourg. Within
a few years, I believe it will be just such another city for trade and Richess
as Brisac is. It was formerly a rich city and well stockt with Merchants and
wealthy inhabitants, who lived under a gentle and easy government; but now the
Magistrates have little else to do in the government, but only to take their
rules and measures from a citadell and great guns, which are Edicts that
Merchants least understand. I confess Strasbourg is the less to be pityed that
it so tamely became a slave, and put on its chains without any struggling. Those
Magistrates who were instruments in it, are now sensible of their own folly, and
bite their nails for anger, finding themselves no better but rather worse hated
than the other Magistrates, who did what they could to hinder the reception of
their new masters the French. I quickly grew weary of being here, meeting with
nothing but complaints of poverty, and paying exorbitant taxes; I therefore
soon returned to my Petty-London Francfort, and from thence went to Cassells,
the chief residence of the Landgrave of Hessen. This Prince is a Calvinist, as
most of his subjects are, very grave and Zealous in his religion: He married a
Princess of Courland, by whom he has an hopeful issue, to wit, three sons and
two Daughters. The late King was God father to one of his sons, who was
Christened by the name of Charles. Captain William Leg Brother to the Lord
Dartmouth representing his Majesty as his Envoy. The court of this Prince does
indeed resemble a well governed college, or Religious Cloister, in regard of
its modesty and regularitie in all things, and especially in the hours of
devotion. He is rich in money, and entertains about nine thousand men in
constant pay, under the command of Count van derlipp, a brave and expert
Soldier his Lieutenant General; but can bring many more upon occasion into
field. This family has been very happy both in its progeny and alliances,
many wise Princes of both sexes having sprung from it; and the mother of this
present Landgrave may be reckoned amongst the illustrious women of the present
and past ages. After the death of William the 5. Landgrave of Hessen her
husband, she not only supported but advanced the war wherein he was engaged,
did many signal actions, Enlarged her territories, and at the conclusion of
the peace kept under her pay 56 Cornets of horse in five Regiments, 166
Companies of foot, besides thirteen Companies of Dragons, and 14 independent
Companies, in all 249 Companies of horse and foot; she was a Princess extremely
obliging to strangers: especially virtuous and learned divines. I had the
honor a good many years ago to kiss her highnesses hand; at which time she
was mighty Zealous in promoting an accommodation amongst different Religions,
as the Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist, but especially betwixt the two
latter, and therefore entertained Doctor Duris at her court in Cassels who
wrote several pieces upon that subject of reconciliation, and with some of his
friends had a conference with a learned priest that came from Rome to forward
the project; whereupon the Doctor published his book of the Harmoney of
Consent, which is highly esteemed in Germany.

From this Princes court I directed my journey to Hanover, taking Lambspring in
my way, a place where there is a convent of English Monks; and there I met with
a very aged worthy and harmeless Gentleman St. Thomas Gascoigue, a Person of
more integrity and piety then to be guilty, so much as in thought, of what
miscreants falsely swore against him in the licentions time of plotting; the
Lord Abbot and several of the Monks I had seen there formerly. This monastery
is very obliging to all strangers that travel that way, as well as to their
own Countrymen, and is highly respected by the neighboring Princes of all
persuasions, as the Princes of the house of Lunenburg, the Landgrave of Hessen,
and Elector of Cologne, who as Bishop of Hildersheim is their ordinary. The
town of Lambspring is Lutheran though under the government of the Lord Abbot
and his chapter, who constantly choose Lutheran Magistrates and Officers for the
civil administration, and live together in that love and unity, that as yet
there has never the least debate happened amongst them; and indeed this
harmoney is now to be observed in most parts of Germany where different
Religions are professed. When I considered so many goodly faces both of Monks
and students in that Abbey, I could not forbear to make a serious reflection on
the number of the English whom I had seen in the colleges and Cloisters
abroad, as at Rome, Rattesbonne, Wirtzburg in Lorraine, at Liege, Louvain,
Brussels, Dunkerk, Ghent, Paris, and other places, besides the several
Nunneries, and withal on the loss that both King and Kingdom suffered
thereby, when so many of our natives both men and women should be constrained
to spend their own Estats and the benevolence of others in a strange Land,
which amounts to more money than at first one may imagine; and this thought, I
confess, made me wish it were otherwise. I would not have the Reader to mistake
me here, as if I espoused, or pleaded for any particular party; No, I plead
only for the sentiments of humanity, without which our nature degenerates into
that of brutes, and for the love that every honest man ought to have for his
Country. I am as much a friend to the Spanish Inquisition, as to the
persecuting of tender Conscienced protestants, provided there be no more but
Conscience in the case; and I could heartily wish that Papists and Protestants
could live as lovingly together in England as they do in Holland, Germany, and
other Countries; for give me leave to say it, I love not that Religion which
in stead of exulting, destroys the Principles of morality and humane society.
I have met with honest men of all persuasions, even Turks and Jews, who in
their lives and manners have far exceeded many of our Enthusiastic professors
at home; and when ever this happened, I could not forbear to love the men
without embraceing there Religion, for which they themselves are to account to
their great master and Judge.

In my progress toward Hanover I touched at Hildersheim a city whose
Magistrates are Lutheran, though Roman Catholics have the Cathedral Church,
and several monasteries there. The court of Hanover makes another kind of
figure than that of Cassels, it being the court of a greater Prince, who is
Bishop of Osnaburg, duke of Brunswick Lunenburg, Hanover etc. Here I had the
honor to kiss the hands of the Princess Royal Sophia youngest sister to the
late Prince Rupert. Her highness has the character of the Merry debonnaire
Princess of Germany, a lady of extraordinary virtue and accomplishments, and
mistress of the Italian, French, High and low dutch and English languages,
which she speaks to perfection. Her husband has the title of the Gentlemen of
Germany, a graceful and comely Prince both a foot and on horseback, civil to
strongers beyond compare, infinitely Kind and beneficent to people in distress,
and known in the world for a valiant and experienced Soldier. I had the honor
to see his troops which without controversic are as good men, and commanded by
as expert Officers as any are in Europe: Amongst his Officers I found brave
Steel-hand Gordon Colonel of an Excellent Regiment of horse, Grimes, Hamilton,
Talbot and others of our Kings subjects. God has blessed the Prince with a
numerous offspring, having six sons all galant Princes; of whom the two eldest
signalized themselves so bravely at the raising of the siege of Vienna, that as
an undoubted proof of their valor they brought three Turks home to this court
prisoners. His Eldest son is married to a most beautiful Princess sole heiress
of the duke of Lunenbourg and Zell his elder brother; as the lovely Princess
his daughter is lately married to the Electorall Prince of Brandenbourg. He is
a gracious Prince to his people, and keeps a very splendid court, having in his
stables for the use of himself and children no less than fifty two sets of
coach horses. he himself is Lutheran, but as his subjects are Christians of
different persuasions, nay and some of them Jews too, so both in his court and
army he entertains Gentlemen of various opinions and Countries, as Italian
abbots, and Gentlemen that serve him, and many Calvinist French Officers:
neither is he so bigoted in his Religion but that he and his Children go many
times to Church with the Princess who is a Calvinist, and join with her in her
devotion. His Country is good, having gold and silver mines in it, and his
subjects live well under him; as do those also of his brother the duke of
Lunenbourg, and their Cozen the duke of Wolfembottel, which are the three
Princes of the house of Lunenbourg; of whom it may be said that they have
always stuck honestly to the right side, and befriended the interests of the
Empire; so that no by respect, neither honor nor profit, could ever prevail
with them, as it has with others, to make them abandon the public concern.

From this Princes court I went to Zell the residence of the duke the elder
brother of the family. This Prince is called the mighty Nimrod because of the
great delight he takes in horses, dogs and hunting. He did me the honor to
let me she his stables, wherein he keeps 370 horses most of them English, or
of English breed. His dogs which are also English, are so many, that with great
care they are quartered in several apartments according to their Kind and
qualities, there being a large office like a brewhouse employed for boiling of
malt and Corn for them. It is this valiant Prince who took Tieves from the
French, and made the Mareshall do Crequi prisoner: he is extremely obliging to
strangers, and has several brave Scottish Officers under his pay, as Major
General Erskin, Graham, Goloman, Hamilton Melvin and others. His Lieutenant
General is one Chavot a Protestant of Alsatia an excellent and experienced
commander; who did me the honor to treat me three days at his house, where
with all his Scottish and English Officers, whom he had invited, we liberally
drank to the health of our present King, having, as he told us, served under
his Majesty, when duke of York, both in France and Flanders, where he gained
the reputation both for skill and conduct in the wars not only from Mareshall
Turin a competent Judge, but also from all other General Persons who had the
honor to know him, that fame has made better known in the world than the
encomium which that generous Gentleman ingenuously gave, and which here I
spare to relate. I shall add no more concerning this Prince, his Officers, or
Country; but that he with the other two Princes of the house of Lunenbourg
Hanover and Wolfenbottel, can upon occasion bring into the field 36000 Soldiers
whom they keep in constant pay, and such men as I never saw better in my life.

After some stay at the Court of the duke of Zell I went to Hambourg a famous
Hansiatick town. It is a republic and city of great trade, occasioned partly
by the English Company of Merchant adventures, but much more by the dutch
Protestants who in the time of the Duke of Alba forsook the low Countries and
seltled here, and the Protestants also who were turned out of Cologne and other
places in Germany; who nevertheless are not now allowed public Churches within
the city, but at a place called Altena a village belonging to the King of
Denmark, a quarter of an hours walk distant from Hambourg. This Commonwealth
is Lutheran and governed by four Burgemasters, twenty four Radtsheres, and a
common Council of all the Burghers who have above 40 schellings per annum free
hold. The symbol or Motto under their Arms is, da pacem domine in diebus
nostris, and in their Standart are these letters S. P. Q. H. The people here
groan under heavy taxes and impositions; The State because of continual Alarms
they have from the King of Denmark or other neighbors; and the intestine
broiles that frequently happen here, as well as at Cologne, where the
Burgemasters are often in danger of their lives from the mutinous mobile; being
forced to maintain six or seven thousand men in pay, besides two or three men
of war to guard their havens from pirates. I shall not name all the ways of
imposing taxes which this Commonwealth uses, because in most they imitate the
methods of the States General as to that, which have bin mentioned before: I
shall only take notice of some peculiar customs they have, wherein they
differ from Holland. When a Barber, shoe maker, or any other Artizan dies,
leaving a widow and Children, another of the same trade is not admitted to set
up for himself as a master; unless he compound with the widow for a piece of
money, or else marry her, or a daughter of hers with her consent.

If any man cause another to be arrested for debt or upon any other suit, the
plaintiff must go along with the Officer who arrests the party and stay by him
until the prisoner be examined by the sheriff; so that if the sheriff be not
to be spoken with that night, the plaintiff must tarry with the prisoner all
night, until the sheriff examine the matter, and see cause of discharging or
committing the party; but this a plaintiff may do by a procuration Notariall.

If a prisoner be committed for debt, the plaintiff must maintain him in prison
according to his quality: and if the party lie in prison during the space of
six years, at the expiration of that time the prisoner is discharged; and if
during the time of his imprisonment, the plaintiff do not punctually pay the
prisoners allowance at the months end, the prisoner is set at liberty, and
nevertheless the plaintiff must pay the Gailer the last months allowance.

This state is severe in the execution of Justice against thieves, murders and
cheats. There is no pardon to be expected for murder, and a Burgemaster himself
if guilty cannot escape. The punishment for Murder is here as in Sweden,
breaking malefactors on the wheel, pinching their breasts and Arms with hot
Pincers, speeting them in at the fundament and out at the shoulder, they have
also cruel ways of torturing to make prisoners confess; And are very careful
not to be cheated in their public revenue; their accisemen and collectors
being punished as in Holland. They take a very good course not to be cheated in
their accise; for all the mils of the Country are in the hands the State; so
that no baker nor brewer can grind his own corn, but must have it ground at the
States mills, where they pay the accise. There is a General tax upon all
houses, and that is the Eight penny, which nevertheless does not excuse them
from chimney money. The States here as at Genoa in Italy are the public
vintners, of whom all people must buy their wine, which they buy from the
Merchants, or otherwise import it in their own ships. In their ceremonies of
burying and Christening, they are ridiculously prodigal; as for instance. If
one invite a Burgemaster, he must give him a ducat in gold, if a Ra^dtsheer,
that is, an Alderman, a Rixdollar, to every Preacher, Doctor of Physic,
Advocat or Secretary half a Rixdollar, and to every Schoolmaster the third
part of a Rixdoller. The women are the inviters to Burialls, weddings and
Christenings, who wear an Antic Kind of a dress, having mitered caps as high
again as the Miter of a Bishop. The Churches here are rich in revenues, and
ornaments, as Images and Stately Organs wherein they much delight. They are
great lovers of Music; in so much that I have told ^5 masters of several
sorts of Music in one Church, besides those who were in the Organ-gallery.
Their Organs are extraordinarely large. I measured the great pipes in the
Organs of St. Catharins and St. James's Churches, and found them to be 3 foot
and 3 quarters in circumference and 32 foot long; in each of which Organs there
are two Pipes 5 foot and 8 inches round. The wealth and trade of this city
increases daily: They send one year with another 70 Ships to Greenland, and
have wonderfully engrossed that trade from England and Holland, and it is
believed that small and great there are belonging to this Commonwealth five
thousand sail of Ships. After Amsterdam, Genoa, and Venice their bank is
reckoned the chief in credit; but in trade they are accounted the third in
Europe, and come next to London and Amsterdam. Hambourg is now become the
Magazine of Germany and of the baltic and northern seas. They give great
privileges to the Jews, and to all strangers whatsoever, Especially the
English Company of Merchant Adventures, whom they allow a large building, where
they have a Church, and where the deputy governor, Secretary, Minister, and
the other Officers of the Company live, to whom they yearly make present of
Wine, Beer, Sheep, Salmond and Sturgeon in their seasons. And so much of
Hambourg.

From Hambourg I went to Lubeck, which is also a Commonwealth and Imperial
town. It is a large well built city containing ten parish Churches; the
Cathedral dedicated to St. Peter being in length 500 foot, with two high
spires all covered with brass as the rest of the Churches of that city are. In
former times this city was the place where the deputies of all the Hansiatick
towns assembled, and was once so powerful as to make war against Denmark and
Sweden, and to conquer several places and Islands belonging to those two
Crowns, nay and to lend Ships to England and other Potentates, without any
prejudice to their own trade, wherein they vied in all parts with their
neighbors; but it is now exceedingly run into decay not only in territories,
but in wealth and trade also. And the reason of that was chiefly the
inconsiderate zeal of their Lutheran Ministerus who persuaded the Magistrates
to banish all Roman Catholics, Calvinists, Jews, and all that dissented from
them in matter of Religion, even the English Company too, who all went and
settled in Hambourg, to the great advantage of that city and almost ruin of
Lubeck, which has not now above 200 Ships belonging to it, nor more
territories to the State; than the city it self and a small part called Termond
about eight miles distant from it. The rest of there territories are now in the
possession of the Danes and Swedes, by whom the burghers are so continually
allarmed, that they are quite tired out with keeping guard and paying of Taxes.
The city is indeed well fortified; but the government not being able to
maintain above 1500 Soldiers in pay, 400 Eurghers in two Companies are obliged
to watch every day. They have a large well built Stathouse, and an Exchange
covered, on the top whereof the globes of the world are painted. This Exchange
is about fifty yards in the length; and but fifteen in breadth; over it there
is a Room where the skins of five Lions which the Burghers killed at the city
gates in the year 1252 are kept stuffed. The great market place is very large
where a monumentall stone is to be seen, on which one of their Burgemasters was
beheaded for running away without fighting in a sea engagement. The people here
spend much time in their Churches at devotion, which consists chiefly in
singing. The women are beautiful but disfigured with a kind of Antic dress;
they wearing cloaks like men. It is cheap living in this town; for one may hire
a palace for a matter of 20 (...) a year, and have provisions at very
reasonable rates: besides the air and water is very good; the city being
supplied with fountains of Excellent fresh water, which Hambourg wants; and
good ground for cellerage, there being cellars here forty or fifty foot deep.

I had the curiosity to go from Lubeck to see the Ancient city of Magdeburg,
but found it so ruined and decayed by the Swedish war, that I had no
encouragement to stay there. I therefore hastened to Berlin the chief
residence of the Elector of Brandenbourg, at whose Court I met with a very
Ingenuous French Merchant who told me that he and diverse other Merchants were
designed to have lived in England, but were discouraged by a letter sent from
London, by a French man that was removeing from thence to Amsterdam, for these
following reason which I coppied out of his Letter; First because the Reformed
Religion is persecuted in England as it is in France, the which I told him was
a great untruth, for it is apparent that they have been all along graciously
admitted, and received into his Majesty's Dominions, without interruption, and
allowed the free exercise of their own form of worship, according to the
Doctrine and discipline of the Churches of France, nor can they who converse
with the French Ministers either in France or Holland be Ignorant, that the
chiefest part, if not all those Ministers are willing to complye with the
Church of England, and it is Evident that most of the Dutch and French
Protestants (so called;) in Holland make use of Organs in their Churches;

A second thing was that both the bank of London and the Bankers. Gouldsmiths
were all broak, the which I told this Frenchman was not true altogether, for
there are many able Bankers whom I named as Alderman Fowls, Alderman Hornbey,
Alderman Duncomb, Alderman Founs, Mr. Thomas Cook, Mr. Rob: Vyner, Mr. Child,
Mr. Ends, Mr. Evans and others well known to the world by their solid
dealling: neither was the Bank (as he called the Chamber of London) broak, only
it had been under the management of a bad Person whose design was to bring it
into disgrace; besides there is the East India Company an unquestionable
security for those as have money to dispose of, together with another
undeniable security which is Land. Thirdly he says, that in England there is
no Register, and therefore many frauds in purchases and morgages, which begett
teadious suites, and renders both dangerous to trust; Fourtly that if a man
would purchase land he cannot, being an Alien, until Naturalized. Fifthly that
in England there are so many plots and Confusions in Government that the
Kingdom is hardly quiet twenty years together.

Sixthly that false witnesses were so common in England and the crime of
perjury so slightly punished, that no man could be safe in life or Estate if he
chanced to be in trouble. Lastly he said that the English are so restless and
quarrelesome, that they not only foment and cherish Animosities amongst one
another, but are Every foot contriving and plotting against their lawful
sovereign and the Government. By such surmises and insinuations as these the
French and Germans are scared from trusting themselves and fortunes in England
and therefore settle in Amsterdam, Hamburg and other Cittyes, where there are
Banks and Registers; This I say is one cause why there are now to be seen at
Amsterdam such vast numbers of French and Germans who have much enriched that
City and raised the rents of the houses 20 parcent, and the silkeweavers grow
also very rich keeping so many Alms Children to do their work and having all
their labor without any charge only for the teaching them their trades; which
has lessened the revenues of the French crown, and will in time greatly
increase the number of the States subjects, and advance there public Incomes.

To say the truth the inconstancy and wantonness of the English nation,
especially of late times, when no other cause could be given for it, but to
much ease and plenty, is not only wondered at but reflected upon by foreigners;
yet I am morally certain that could the people of England be once again
united in love and affection as they are bound to be in duty and Interest, and
would they be as willing to contribute to their own hapines as heaven has been
kind and liberal in bestowing the means of it, with a good and gracious Prince
solicitous for preserveing the same to them, could we be so blessed as we have
great reason to Expect we may under the Auspicious reign of him whose royal
Virtues are dreaded by none either at home or a broad but such as are the
disturbers of public and lawful Authority.

Having made this digression, I return to Berlin, It is a city lately enlarged
with fair streets and palaces. The Magistrates of the place are Lutherans,
which is the public established Religion in all the Electors dominions; though
he himself and his Children be Calvinists. He is looked upon to be so true to
that persuasion, that he is reckoned the Protector of the Calvinists; and
indeed he solicited the Emperor very hard for a toleration of the Protestants
in Hungary. His chaplains, as most of the Lutheran ministers also, endeavor to
imitate the English in their way of preaching: and his highness is so much
taken with English divinity, that he entertains divines for translating English
books into the German tongue, as the whole duty of man and several others. He
has a large and Srately palace at Berlin and therein a copious library enriched
with many manuscripts, medalls, and rarities of Antiquity. He may compare with
most Princes for handsome guards, being all of them proper well bodied men, and
most part Officers who ride in his guards of horse. As he is known in the
world to be a valiant and warlick Prince, so he maintains in pay an Army of
36000 men; besides five or six thousand horsemen, who in time of war are
modelled into troops; with which body during the late war with Sweden, his
highness in Person beat the Swedes out of his Country. He keeps his forces in
strickt Discipline, obliging all the Officers, if Protestants, on Sundays and
holy days to march their several Companies in order to Church, but if a
superior Officer be of a contrary persuasion, then the next in commission
supplies his place. This custom is Religiously observed by all his highnesses
garrisons; whilst he himself with his Children, being five sons, two
Daughters, and two Daughters in law, go constantly to the Calvinist Church
adjoining to the Court. Amongst other acts of public piety and charity, this
Prince has established and endowed some Religious houses or Nunneries for
Protestant young ladies, where they may live virtuously and spend their time in
devotion as long as they please, or otherwise marry, if they think fit, but
then they lose the benefit of the Monastery. There is one of these at Herford
in Westphalia, where I was and had the honor to wait upon the Lady Abbess the
Princess Elisabeth, eldest sister of the Elector Palatine and Prince Rupert,
who is since dead. Notwithstanding the late wars with Sweden and that by the
prevalency of France in that hasty treaty of peace concluded at Nimwegen, his
Electorall Highness was obliged to give back what he had Justly taken from that
crown; yet his subjects flourish in wealth and trade, his highness having
encouraged manufactures of all sorts, by inviting Artizans into his dominions,
and estalished a Company of tradeing Merchants to the West Indies, which will
much advance navigation amongst his subjects. And in all humane probability
they are like to continue in a happy condition, seeing by the alliances his
highness has made with the Protestant Princes of the Empire, and especially
the house of Lunenbourg, they are in no danger of being disturbed by their
neighbors. I told you before that the Prince of Brandenbourg was married to
the Daughter of the duke of Hanover, so that so long as that alliance holds,
the families of Brandenbourg and Lunenbourg will be in a condition to cast the
balance of the Empire; they both together being able to bring into the field
80000 as good men as any are in Europe.

When I parted from Berlin I made a turn back to Lunenbourg in my way to
Swedland, where I found several of my Country men Officers in the garrison,
who showed me what was most remarkable in the city, as the Saltworks (which
bring in considerable sums of money to the duke of Lunenbourg) the Stathouse,
and Churches, in one of which I saw a communion table of pure ducat gold. From
thence I went into the Province of of Holstein, and at a small sea port called
Termond, of which I spoke, before, I embarked for Sweden.

He that has read in the histories of this last age the great exploits of
Gustavus Adolphus and his Swedes, perhaps may have a fancy that it must be an
excellent Country which has bredsuch warriors; but if he approach it, he
will soon find himself undeceived. Entering into Sweedland at a place called
Landsort, we sailed forwards amongst high rocks having no other prospect from
Land but mountains till we came to Dollers, which is about four Swedish, that
is, twenty four English miles from Stockholm, the capital city of the
Kingdom: upon my comeing a shore I confess I was a little surprised to see the
poverty of the people; and the little wooden houses they lived in, not unlike
Soldiers huts in a leaguer; but much more, when I discovered little else in the
Country but mountanous rocks and standing lakes of water. The Reader will
excuse me, I hope, if I remarke not all that I may have taken notice of in
this Country, seeing by what I have already written, he may perceive that my
design is rather to observe the manner of the inhabitants living, then to give
a full description of every thing that may be seen in the Country they live
in. However I shall say somewhat of that too, having premised once for all that
the ordinary people are wretchedly poor; yet not so much occasioned by the
Public taxes, as the barrenness of their Country, and the oppression of the
nobles their Landlords, and immediate superiors, who till the present King put
a stop to their violences, tyrannically domineered over the lives and fortunes
of the poor peasants. From Dollers I took wagon to Stockholm, changing horses
three times by the way, by reason of the badness of the rode, on all hands
environed with rocks, that hardly open so much as here and there to leave a
shred of plain ground. At two miles distance upon that rode the city of
Stockholme looks great; because of the Kings palace, the houses of Noblemen, and
some Churches which are seated upon rocks; and indeed, the whole city and
suburbs stand upon rocks, unless it be some few houses built upon ground gained
from the rivers that run throw the town. Stockholme has its name from a stock
or logg of wood which three brothers threw into the water five miles above the
city, making a vow that where ever that stock should stop, they would build a
castle to dwell in. The stock stopped at the Holme or rock where the palace of
the King now stands; and the brothers to be as good as their word, there built
their castle, which invited others to do the like; so that in process of time
the other rocks or holmes were covered with buildings which at length became
the capital city of the Kingdom. It is now embellished with a great many
Stately houses, and much emproved from what it was 4^0 years ago, as indeed,
most cities are; for the Stathouse then built, is so contemtible and low that
in Holland or England, it would not be suffered to stand to disgrace the
nation. The Council Chamber where the Burgemaster and Raedt sit, is two rooms
cast into one not above nine foot high; and the two rooms where the sheriffs
and the Erve college (which is a Judicature like to the Doctors Commons in
England) sit are not above eight foot and a half high. The Kings Palace is a
large square of stone building, in some places very high, but an old and
irregular fabric, without a sufficient quantity of ground about it for
gardens and walks. It was anciently surrounded with water; but some years
since part of it was filled up to make a way from the castlegate down into the
old town. In this Palace there are large rooms; but the lodgings of the King,
Queen and Royal family are three pair of stairs high, the rooms in the first
and second story's being destined for the Senate Chamber and other courts of
Judicature. The Kings library is four pair of stairs high, being a room about
forty six foot square, with a closet adjoining to it not half the dimensions.
When I considered the appartments and furniture of this Court, I began to think
that the French Author wrote truth, who in his Remarks upon Swedland says,
that when Queen Christina resigned the Crown to Carolus Gustaphus the father of
this present King, she disposed of the best of the furniture of the Court, and
gave away a large share of the Crown lands to her favorites; in so much that
the King considering the poor condition she had left the Kingdom in, and
seeing the Court so meanly furnished, said that had he known before he
accepted the Crown, what then he did, he would have taken other measures.

There are many other Stately palaces in Stockholme belonging to the nobility;
but many of them for want of repairs, and not being inhabited run to ruin;
several of the nobles who lived in them formerly, having lost the estates that
maintained their ancient splendor, as we shall see hereafter, being retired
unto a Country life. There are also some other magnificent structures begun,
but not finished, as that Stately building intended for a Parliament house for
the nobles, and two or three Churches: but what I most wonder at is the vault
wherein the late King lies buried, is not as yet covered but with boards, for
it is to he observed that the Kings of Sweeden have no tombs and monuments as
in England and other Countries; but are put into copper coffins with
inscriptions on them, and placed one by another in vaults adjoining to the Gray
Friars Church. These vaults are about Eight in number, having turets over them
with vains of Copper gilt, carved into the ciphers of the several Kings who
give them their names by being the first that are interred in them. The vault
of the late King is not yet finished, no more then the fabrics above
mentioned, which perhaps may be imputed to the late troubles of Swedland. The
number of the inhabitants of Stockholme are also much decreased within these
few years, partly by reason of the removal of the Court of Admiraltie and the
Kings Ships from that city to Charles-crown, a new haven lately made about 200
English miles from thence, which has draw'n many families belonging to the
fleet and Admiralitie from Stockholme to live there: and partly because many of
the nobility, gentry and those that depended on them, are, as I said before,
withdraw'n from Stockholme to a retired life in the Country. Nevertheless the
ordinary sort of Bourghers who still remain are extremely poor; seeing the women
are fain to work like horses, drawing carts, and as laborers in England,
serving masons and bricklayers with stone, bricks and mortar, and unloading
vessels that bring those materials; some of the poor creatures in the
summertime toyling in their smocks without either shoes or stockings. They
perform also the part of watermen, and for a small matter will row passengers
40 miles or more if they please.

The Court here is very thin and silent, the King living frugally and seldom
dining in public He eats commonly with the two Queens his mother and consort,
who is a virtuous Princess sister to the King of Denmark. She is the mother of
five Children, three sons and two daughters, with whom she spends most of her
time in retirement. The King is a goodly Prince whom God has blessed and
endowed with accomplishments far beyond what might have been expected from his
education, wherein he was extremely abused, being taught little more than his
mother tongue. He is gracious, Just and valiant, constant at his devotion, and
utterly averse from all kind of debauchery, and the unfashionable vanities of
other courts in plays, and danceing.

His Sports are hunting and exerciseing of his guards, and he rarely appears
publicly or gives audience to strangers, which is imputed to his sense of the
neglect of his education. He is a Prince that has had a very hard beginning in
the world, which has many times proved fortunate to great men; and indeed, if
we consider all the circumstances of his early misfortunes, how he was
slighted and neglected by his nobles who would hardly vouchsafe to pay him a
visit when he was among them in the Country, or to do him homage for the
lands they held of the Crown; and how by the Pernicious councels of the French
and the weakeness or treachery of his governors he was misled into a war that
almost cost him his Crown, having lost the best of his territories in Germany
and Schonen, and most of his forces both by sea and land: If I say, these
things be considered, it will probably appear that hardly any Prince before
him has in a shorter time or more fully settled the Authority and prerogative
of the Crown, then he has done in Sweden; for which he stands no ways obliged
to France, as he was for the restoration of what he lost during the war. He is
now as absolute as the French King, and makes Edicts which have the force of
Laws with out the concurrence of the Estates of the Kingdom. He has erected
two Iudicatures the one called the college of Reduction, and the other of
inspections; the first of which has put his Majesty in possession again of all
lands alienated from the Crown, and the other called to account all persons
even the heirs and executors of those who had cheated the Crown, and made them
refound what they or their predecessors had appropriated to their own use of
the Public revenue. These two necessary constitutions, as they have reduced
many great families to a pinch, who formerly lived splendidly upon the Crown
lands and revenues, and obliged them to live at home upon their ancient and
private Patrimony in the Country, which is one great cause that the Court of
Sweden is at present so unfrequented; so have they enabled his Majesty,
without burdening of his subjects, to support the Charges of the government,
and to maintain 64000 men in pay. The truth is his other Renues are but small,
seeing Queen Christina enjoys the best of his territories, as her allowance, and
that what arises from the Copper and Iron mines, one Silver mine, the Pitch and
Tar, the customs and excise amounts to no extraordinary sum of money, and the
land tax in so barren a Country scarcely deserving to be named. The customs
and excise, I confess, are very high, and the rigorous manner of exacting them
pernicious to trade; as for instance. I^ a ship come to Stockholme from London
with a hundred several sorts of goods, and those goods assigned to fifty
several men more or less; if any of those fifty do not pay the custom of what
belongs to him, though it be for a barrel of Beer, the Ship shall not be
unladen, nor no man have his goods out, though he has fully paid the customs
for them, till this last man has paid his. There are several other silly
customs in Swedland that discourages men from tradeing there; as if any
stranger die there, a third of his Estate must go to the city or town where he
traded. No foreign Merchant in Stockholm can travel into any Country where
there is a fair without a passport: and at present seeing there is no treaty of
trade betwixt England and Sweden, though the English bring as considerable a
trade to that Kingdom, as any other Country whatsoever, yet they are very
unkindly used by the Officers of the custom house; whereas the Dutch, in
Lubeck, and other cities have new and greater Privileges allowed them. Nor
would I Counsel an Englishman to go to law with a Swedish Burgher in Sweden,
especially if he be a Whiggish Scot who has got his freedom in Stockholme,
for those are a kind of skrapers, whom I have observed to be more inveterate
against the English then the native Sweeds.

Of all the Swedish army of 64000 men, the King keeps but 12 Companies of 200
men a piece, with some few horse guards in Stockholme, who are not upon duty as
sentinels at the Court gates, as at the Courts of other Princes. The rest are
dispersed into quarters and garrisons upon the fronteers which are so far
distant in that large compass of land which his territories take up, that it
would require a hard and tedious worck to bring them together to a general
muster. They are however kept under very strick discipline, and those that lie
near often viewed by the King. They have od sorts of punishments for the
Soldiers and Officers of all degrees: for example if a Sergeant or Corporal
be drunk or negligent on duty, they are put into armor, and with three muskets
tied under each arm, made to walk two hours before the Court of guard: yet for
all the severitie of discipline used against the Soldiers, they commit many
abuses in the night time, robbing and sometimes killing men upon the streets in
Stockholme, where they have no lights nor guards as in Coppenhaguen. Informer
times there have been at one time thirty five Colonels besides General
Officers in the Swedish Army all the subjects of the King of great Britain, but
at present there are few or none, unless it be the sons of some Scottish
Officers deceased; nor did I ever see an Englishmen in the Kings guards horse
or foot but one, and the son of Sr. Eduard wood, who has since quitted the
service. The King has exceedingly won the hearts of the common people, not
only by exempting them from the tyrannical Jurisdiction of the nobility and
gentry, who formerly would by their own private authority punish and put to
death the peasants at their pleasure; which makes the Countries very willing to
quarter the Kings Soldiers, but by his exactness in punishing duels, murder and
robberies. Perjury is death here also as in Holland: which makes the
Magistrates in some ports of this Kings territories enjoins strange kinds of
oaths to deter men from being forsworn. As for instance, in some places, the
witness is set, with a staff in his hand, upon some peeble stones and
charcoale, where he is to imprecate and pray, that if what he swears be not
true, his land may become as barren as those stones, and his substance be
consumed to ashes like the coals he stands on, which as soon as he steps down
are set on fire. This manner of swearing so terrifies the people, that they
commonly tremble when they come to take their oath.

The Religion of the dominions of the King of Sweden, as of those of the King
of Denmark, and of other Princes and states whom we have named is Lutheran;
who are more rigid to Roman Catholics and Calvinists than the Protestanrs of
Germany. There is no tolleration allowed here to Calvinist ministers; and they
take an effectual course to keep the Country clear of priests and Jesuits, by
guelding them whether they be young or old. In commemoration of the great
losses and desolation iustained in the late war, the Swedes strictly keep four
fasting days in the months of April, May, June and July; on which days all men
are prohibited by Authority to kindle fire in their houses, or to eat till
after Evening service is don, which in the winter time could not be endured.
They delight much in singing in their Churches, which they constantly perform
twice every day, morning, and evening. In their maryings, Christenings and
buryings they are so prodigally extravagant, that if all three happen in one
year to a man of a competent estate, it is enough to break him, The clergy of
Sweden are neither so rich nor learned as those of Germany, wanting both the
opportunities of study, and of conversing with learned men, that those of other
Countries enjoy; though there be some learned men amongst them. A Bishopric in
Sweden is no great benefice, if compared with some Personages in England; for
the Archbishop and Metropolitan has not above 400 L. per ann. and some of the
rest are not worth above 150 or 200 L. a year. The inferior Clergy are not so
regular in their lives and conversation in the Countries distant from
Stockholme, as they are near the court, and the reason is, partly because they
entertain travelers that pass the Country, there being no Ins in most places
for the accommodation of persons of any quality, and so are obliged to drink
with their guests: and partly because at buryings and Christenings, where there
is commonly high drinking, the Pape or Parson is master of the Ceremonies; And
here give me leave, to tell a short story of one of them. A Pape comeing to
Christen a Child in a Church, and finding a Scottish man to be Godfather, was
so transported either with Zeal or his cups, that when he came to exorcise the
Child which is a rite used in their Office of Administering that Sacrament, He
neglected the form prescribed by the liturgy, and in an extemporary prayer
begged that the devil might depart out of the Child, and enter into that
Scottish Heretic; for so they call the Presbyterians of that nation. The
prayer of the Pape so incensed the Scot that he vowed revenge, and watched the
Pape with a good cudgel next day as he crossed the Church yard, where he beat
him and left him all in blood lying on the ground and crying out murder. For
this fact the Scot was had before the Justice, who asking him how he durst be
so bold as to lay his profane hands upon the man of God, He, who knew very well
what use to make of the devil he had got, foaming at the mouth and cunningly
acting the demoniack, made answer that the Pape might thank himself for what he
had met with; for since he had conjured the devil into him he spared no body,
neither wife nor Children, nor would he spare the Justice himself, and with
that sell a mangling and tearing the Magistrate, that he was fain to betake
himself to his heels, crying out O! the devil, save me; and so the Scot
marched home no man daring to lay hold on him, for fear of being torn to pieces
by the devil. But the Justice recollecting himself sent for the Pape, told him
that the Scot was a cunning rogue, and bid him go home, get a plaster for his
head and be silent; least if the matter came to the Bishops ears, he might be
censured for goeing against the rubric of the liturgy.

The famous Universitie where their Clergy are bred is Vpsall eight Swedish
miles from Stockholme. There are commonly 150 or 200 Students there, but no
endowed colleges as in other Countries. The library is so mean and
contemptible that the libraries of many Grammar Schools and of private men in
England or Holland are far better stored with books then it is. Upon viewing of
it, and that of the Kings Palace, I called to mind the saying of a French man,
upon the like occasion; That Swedland came behind France and England in the
knowledge of men and things at least 800 years; yet some Swedes have been so
conceited of the antiquity of their Country, as to bragg that Paradise was
seated in Sweden, that the Country was turned into such heaps of rocks for the
rebellion of our first parents, and that Adam and Eve had Cain and Abel in a
Country three Swedish miles distant from Vpsall. A French man standing by and
hearing this Romantic story, as I was told, fitted him with the like, telling
him that when the world was made in six days, at the end of the creation all
the Rubbish that remained was throw'n together into a corner, which made up
Sweden and Norway. And indeed the French seem to have no great likeing to the
Country, what ever kindness they may have for the people, for a French
Ambassador, as an author of that Country relates, being by order of Queen
Christina treated in a Country house 4 Swedish miles from Stockholme, and upon
the rode goeing and comeing, with all the varieties and pleasures that the
Country could affoard, on purpose to make him have a good opinion of the same;
made answer to the Queen (who asked him upon his return what he thought of
Sweden) that were he master of the whole Country, he would presently sell it
and buy a farm in France or England; which, under favor, I think was a little
tart and saucy.

Having stayed a considerable time in Swedland, and most part at Stockholme, I
set out from thence to go to Elsenbourg by land, and went a little out of my
way to see a small city called Eubrone famous for a coat of Arms which it got
in this manner. A certain Masculine Queen of Denmark who had conquered a great
part of Sweden, comeing to this city, asked the Magistrates, what was the Arms
of their city; who having told her that they had none, she plucked up her coats
and squatting upon the Snow, bid them take the mark she left there for their
Arms: It Is pity she did not give them a suitable motto to it also. What that
figure is called in blazonerie I know not, but to this day the city uses it in
their Arms, and for marking their commodities. This Queen came purposely into
Sweden to pay a visit to a brave woman that opposed a King of Swedland, who in
a time of famine would have put to death all the men and women in his Country
above sixty years of age. The Country all the way I traveled in Swedland is
much of the same quality of the land about Stockholme, until I came near the
Province of Schonen which is called the store house and Kitchen of Sweden,
where the Country is far better. It was formerly very dangerous to travel in
this Province of Schonen, because of the Snaphances who were a kind of bloody
robbers, now utterly destroyed by the King; so that it is safe enough
traveling there. Entering into Schonen I saw twenty nine of these rogues upon
wheels, and elsewhere in the Country, ten and twenty at several places. The
King used great severitie in destroying of them; some he caused to be broken
upon the wheel, others speeted in at the fundament and out at the shoulders,
many had the flesh pinched off of there breasts, and so were fastened to stakes
till they died, and others again had their noses and both hands cut off, and
being seared with a hot Iron were let go to acquaint their camerades how they
had been served. The King is very severe against Highway-men and duellers. In
above a hundred miles traveling, we found not a house where there was either
French wine or brandie, which made me tell a Swede of our Company who was
traveling to Denmark, that I would undertake to show any man 500 houses
wherein a traveller might have wine and other good accommodation in the space
of an hundred miles upon any rode from London. There are several small towns
and fertile land in this Country of Schonen, lying upon the Sound; at the
narrowest part whereof lies Elsenbourg burnt down by the Danes in the last war:
Here I crossed over to Elsenore, the passage being but a league broad.

The King of Denmark has a castle at Elsenore which commands the narrow passage
of the Sound, where all Ships that enter into or come out of the Baltic sea
must pay toll. Having visited this castle and stayed about a fortnight with the
English Consul, and Sr. John Paul late resident at the Court of Swedland, I
went to the danish Court at Coppenhaguen.

Copenhaguen is the capital city of Zeeland, Jutland or Denmark and place of
residence of the King It stands on a flat, encompassed with a pleasant and
delightful Country much resembling England. The streets of the city are kept
very neat and clean, with lights in the night time for the convenience and
safety of those who are then abroad; a custom not as yet introduced into
Stockholme where it is dangerous to be abroad when it is dark. The Kings men of
war lie here very conveniently, being orderly ranged betwixt Booms after the
manner of Amsterdam, and near the Admiralty house, which is a large pile of
building well furnished with stores and Magazines, secured by a citadell, that
not only commands the city, but also the Haven, and entrey into it. The Court
of Denmark is splendid, and makes a far greater figure in the world then that
of Sweden, tho not many years ago in the time of Carolus Gustaphus the father
of the present King of Swedland, it was almost reduced to its last, when the
walls of Copenhagen saved that Crown and Kingdom. That siege was famous,
carried on with great vigor by the Swede, and as bravely maintained by the
Danes: The monuments whereof are to be seen in the canon bullets gilt that
still remain in the walls of some houses and in the steeple of the great Church
of the town. The Royal palace in Copenhaguen is but small and a very ancient
building, but his Majesty's house Fredenburg is a stately fabric of Modern
Architecture, and very richly furnished. Denmark is at present a flourishing
Kingdom and the King who has now made it hereditary, surpasses most of his
predecessors in power and wealth: He has much enlarged his dominions, as well
as Authority, and by his personal and Royal virtues, no less then the eminent
qualities of a great many able ministers of State, he has gained the
universal love of his subjects, and the esteem of all foreign Princes and
States. The Court if much frequented every day, but especially on Sundays where
about eleven of the clock in the morning, the Nobility, foreign Ministers,
and Officers of the Army assemble and make a glorious appeareance. There one
may see many Knights of the order of the Elephant of Malto but I never saw any
order of the like nature as that of Sweden, that King rarely appearing in his
George and garter, but on days of public audience I have observed at one time
above 150 coaches attending at the Court of Denmark, which are ten times more
than ever I saw together at that of Sweden. The King is affable and of easy
accels to strangers, seen often abroad by his subjects in his gardens and
stables, which are very large and well furnished with all sorts of Horses. He
is a great lover of English horses and dogs, and delights much in Hunting, as
his eldest son the Prince with his brothers do in cockfighting; in so much
that the English Merchants can not make a more acceptable present to those
Princes, then of English game-cocks. The standing forces of Denmark are well
disciplined men, and commanded by good Officers both natives and strangers,
both French and Scots, as Major General Duncan, and Major General Veldun both
Scottishmen, whom I saw at Copenhaguen. The Soldiers, as well as courtiers are
quartered upon the citizens, a custom which is likewise practiced in Sweden,
and tho somewhat uneasy, yet not repined at by the people who by the care and
good government of the King find trade much advanced. For his Majesty by
encouraging strangers of all religions to live in his dominions, and allowing
the French and dutch Calvinists, to have public Churches, has brought many
tradeing families to Coppenhaguen, and by the measure he has taken for
settling trade in prohibiting the importation of foreign manufactures, and
reforming and new modelling the East and West India Companies, has much
increased commerce and thereby the wealth of his subjects; so that
notwithstanding the new taxes imposed upon all coaches, wagons, Ploughs, and
all real and personal estates, which amount to considerable sums of money,
the people live very well and contented. There are commonly about eight
thousand men in garrison in Coppenhaguen, and his Majesty's Regiment of foot
guards who are all clothed in red, with cloaks to keep them warm in the winter
time, is a very handsome body of men, and with the horse guards who are bravely
mounted, and have their granadeers and Hoboyes, make a very fine show. His
Majesty has caused several new fortifications to be built upon the Elb, and
other rivers, and has now in his possession that strong Castle called
Hilgueland, at present commanded by a Scottishman. The Queen of Denmark is a
most virtuous Princess, sister to the present Landgrave of Hessel-Cassel, and
in persuasion a Calvinist, having a chapel allowed her within the Court;
though the public religion of the King and Kingdom be Lutheran. The Clergy
here are learned, many of them having studied at Oxford and Cambridge where
they learnt the English Language, and amongst the Bishops there is one Doctor
King the son of a Scottishman. But seeing it is my design rather to observe the
condition of the people, then to be punctual in describing all the rarities
that are remarkable in the Countries I have been in, I shall conclude what I
have to say of Denmark, by acquainting the Reader that the people of that
Country live far better then the Swedes, and as well as most of their adjoining
neighbors; and that there are several places, both there and in Norway. which
have the names of English towns, as Arundale, Totness, London etc.

When I fist began to write this treatise, I had some thoughts of making
observations upon the several governments of other States and Dominions, where
I had traveled some years before I was in the Countries I have been speaking
of, as of the rest of Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy and France; but that
was a subject so large, and the usefulness of it to my present design so
inconsiderable, that by doing so, I found I could neither satisfy the
curious, by adding any thing material to those many who have already obliged
the public by the remarks of their travells in those places; or make my
discontented Country men more averse then they are already from removing into
those Countries, where I think few of them will choose to transport themselves
for the sake of liberty and Property, tho England were even worse, than they
themselves fancy it can be. All that remains to be done then, is to conclude
this treatise with an obvious and popular remark, that those Countries where
cities are greatest and most frequented by voluntary inhabitants, are always
the best to live in; and by comparing the city of London with all other cities
of Europe, and demonstrating by the surveys I have made (which I think will
hardly be contradicted or confuted,) that of all the capital cities of Europe
it is the biggest, and most populous, and so prove consequentially that
England, for the generality of people, is the best Country in the world
especially for its natives to live in. Now this being an observation, (for what
I know) not hitherto made good by induction and instance, (as I intend to do
it) I hope it will please the Reader as much, as if I gave him a particular
account of other Countries and governments, and leave it to his own reflection
to State the comparison.

Though London within the walls cannot vie for bigness with many cities of
Europe; yet take the city and suburbs together, according as it has been
surveyed by Mr. Morgan, in breadth from St. Georges Church in Southwarke to
Shore ditch, and in length from Limehouse to petty France in Westminster and it
is in a vast proportion larger in compass of ground, and number of houses then
any city whatsoever in Europe. This I shall demonstrate first by compareing it
with some cities of Holland, and then with the most considerable cities of the
other Countries of Europe, which I shall set down in an alphabeticall order
with the number of the houses they severally contain.

When London and suburbs was surveyed some years ago by Mr. Morgan, there were
reckoned to be in it 84000 houses besides hospitalls, Almeshouses, and other
buildings that paid no chimney money to the King: Now if those were added, and
the vast number of new houses that have been built since that survey, upon
modest computation London may be reckoned to countain 100000 houses; I know the
French do vapor and would persuade the world that Paris is much bigger then
London. And the Hollanders will scarce believe that London has more Houses
then the 18 Cittyes in Holland that have voices in the States, for say they
Amsterdam Stands upon a 1000 Morgens land, and London Stands but upon 1800; To
both which I answer, that it is very true that Paris takes up a great spot of
ground, but then you must consider, that in Paris there are several hundreds
of Monasteries, Churches, Coledges, and Cloisters, some of them having large
Gardens, and that in Paris there are 7500 Palaces and Ports for Coaches, which
have likewise great Gardens, whereas London is very thick built, and in the
City the Houses have scarce a Yard big enough to set a Pump, or House of
convenience in; but the weekly bills of Mortality will decide this Question
and plainly give it to London, and so does Mons: la Cour, and Sir. William
Pette in his last Essays dedicated lately to our King, making it appear that
London is bigger then Paris, Rhoan, and Rochell altogether; and as for
Amsterdam I do appeal to all knowing men that have seen it, that although it
be true that it Stands upon 1000 Morgens Land; yet there is not above 400
Morgens built, and this I prove thus, that the large Gardens, on the
Heeregraft, Kysersgraft, and Princegraft, and the Burgavalls of Amsterdam take
up more then a third part of the City, then reckon the Bastions, and the space
of Ground between the Wall, and the Houses, and all the Ground unbuilt from
the Vtricks-Port, to the Wesoper-Port, Muyer-Port, and so to the Seasido, and
you will find it to be near 300 Morgens land: There are 2 Parishes in the
Suburbs of London, viz Stepuey, and St. Martins in the fields, (the later being
so big that the last Parliament divided it into 4 Parishes,) either of them have
more Houses then Rotterdam, or Harlem, and there are several other great
Parishes as St. Margrets-Westminster, St. Giles in the fields, Toolyes, and St.
Mary Overs, the which if they stood apart in the Country would make great
Cittyes, we reckon in London and the Suburbs thereof to be at least 130
Parishes, which contain 100000 Houses, now if you reckon 8 persons to every
house then there are near 800000 souls in London, but there are some that say
there is a million of souls in it; I shall now set down the Cittyes
Alphabetically and their number of Houses as they were given to me not only
from the Surveyours and City Carpenters, but from the Books of the
Herthmoney, and books of the Verpoundings, where such Taxes are paid; and
first I shall begin with the 18 Cittyes that have Voices in the States of
