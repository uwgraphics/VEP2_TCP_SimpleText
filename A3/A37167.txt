AN ESSAY UPON Ways and Means.

AN ESSAY UPON Ways and Means Of Supplying the WAR.

LONDON: Printed for Jacob Tonson at the Judge's Head, near the

AN ESSAY UPON WAYS and MEANS OF Supplying the War.
IN the course of this War, we are engaged in with France, nothing seems more
to have hurt our affairs, than an Opinion, which from year to year has been
entertained among some People of Authority, That the War could not last; which
they were brought into, by the vanity, natural to our Nation, of over-rating
our own strength, and undervaluing that of our Enemies.

Whoever reflects upon the Ways and Means, by which we have all along supplied
the King, will plainly see how much this Opinion has prevailed with the People
in general.

Raising Money by Land Taxes, Fonds of Interest, Polls, doubling the Excise,
charging Tonnage, laying new Customs, and anticipating the old ones, may be
proper Expedients to answer a single and a short Necessity, but, perhaps, they
will hardly appear to be the proper Ways and Means to carry on a great, and a
long War.

At the beginning of the Confederacy, France seemed to take in all its Sails,
in expectation of a Storm, and in a manner sat still, while we took Mentz and
Bon. This Success, and the great Names, and Mighty Kingdoms and States, that
were Listed in this Quarrel, made us flatter our selves with Extravagant hopes;
The most Modest did believe the King of France might be easily reduced to the
state he was left in by the Pyrenean Treaty: But the more general Opinion was,
That he would be subdued to our own Terms.

But such did not consider, that there is hardly any instance to be given in
Story of a Mighty Empire overrun, that was in the full possession of its
Military Virtue. In such an entire possession of the Art of War were the Romans
during the second Punic War; the whole People were trained up to Arms, and
continual Action had bred up and instructed many famous Captains, so that they
were not to be broken by the many Victories Hannibal obtained, even in the
heart of Italy.

And in such a Warlike posture was the Ottoman Empire, when Tamberlain came
into Asia, who in the Battle, fought in the Year 1397, took Bajazet Prisoner,
and slew most of his Army; yet that People, bred to War under three Martial
Kings, were so far from being subdued, that in fifty three Years after, besides
many other acquisitions, they were able to Conquer all the remains of the Greek
Empire.

Great Dominions are to be attempted with hopes of success then only, when
either their own bulk makes them unweildy, or when Wealth has depraved their
Manners, or when long Peace has made them forget their Military Skill and
Virtue; and at such seasons have the great Monarchies of the World been Invaded
and Conquered, not by Superior Virtue in others, but for want of Virtue in
themselves.

It is not from hence concluded, that lesser Nations are not to make War with
strong and Victorious Princes, or that we in England should not with the last
drop of Blood defend this almost only spot of ground, which seems remaining in
the World to Public Liberty.

But from these Instances, and many others in History, it may be argued, that
we cannot presently, and with ease, pull down so Mighty an Empire as France;
and that much Time, Blood, and Treasure, must, perhaps, be spent, before we can
reduce it to such Terms of Peace, as may be Safe and Honorable for the
Confederates.

And since there seem very many, who think the business of this War so easy,
and who wonder the Confederates have done no more, it may not be improper to
take a short view of the Affairs of France, in order to make it appear, what a
powerful Enemy we have to deal with.

That Kingdom has been growing, for these two hundred and seventy years, by
slow degrees, to the height we now see it at; and from the time of Charles the
Seventh, to the Reign of Francis the Second, there were always upon the Throne
Martial and Active Princes, in perpetual War, and forming their People to
Discipline.

And if in the little Commonwealths of Greece, wherever there happened to be an
extraordinary Man, that Man did make his City strong and powerful for a long
time after; much more must a Succession of six Kings, all Men of Counsel and
Action, give strength and power to such a Kingdom as France.

It Is true, that from the time of Francis the Second, to the Peace of Vervins,
which was about forty Years, the Nation was miserably torn by a long and cruel
Civil War; but, as there are certain Diseases, which, when overcome, dispose
the Body to a better state of health for the future; so, perhaps, it may be
made appear, that even this Civil War, in its Consequences, has contributed to
the present Power of that Monarchy, by pulling down the three chief obstacles
that stood in the way of its Greatness; which were, the Protestant Interest,
Spain, and the old Nobility of the Kingdom.

The Massacre of Paris gave the Protestant Interest in that Nation such a
wound, as it has never since been able to recover.

Philip the Second, to procure the Crown of France for the Infanta, did furnish
such vast Sums for the Maintenance of the League, as have ever since kept Spain
low.

And the Houses of Lorrain, Montmorancy, and Chastillon, were in a manner
extinguished in that War; and the rest of the great Families so ruined by it,
that they are now no more than the Trappings and Ornaments of the Tyranny,
which were in times past so strong a part of the Constitution.

From the Peace of Vervins, Harry the Fourth employed his care in repairing the
Calamities of that Civil War, and chiefly he set himself to bring the Treasury
of his Kingdom into some order; in which he was assisted by the Duke of Sully,
a frugal Man, who, by natural Wisdom and mere Honesty, brought the Revenue out
of infinite Debts into such a flourishing condition, that, when the French were
forming their great designs against the House of Austria in 1610, they had
ready four or five years Provision for a War, that was likely to be the
greatest their Nation had ever undertaken.

But the foundations of the present Greatness of that Monarchy, were laid by
Cardinal Richelieu; he first introduced that exact Method which appears in all
their Affairs, that secrecy and steadiness which is in their Councils, and
that entire Obedience which all subordinate degrees pay to their Superiors;
and, by exacting it severely, he first accustomed the French to that Zeal,
Diligence, and Honesty, to their Master, which they show in all Public business.

Cardinal Mazarin was bred up in his School; a Man, perhaps, not quite so deep,
but of infinite Subtilty, and very fit for the Intrigues of the Cabinet, in a
Minority, and under the Regency of a Queen Mother. What the Duke of Sully but
began, Colbert brought to perfection in the Public Revenue; and both he and
Louvoy, were mighty Encouragers of the Trade and Manufactures of the Kingdom.

Thus France, for a long tract of time, has had great Princes on the Throne;
or, which is as good, able Men in the Ministry; and all the while they have
been enlarging their Dominions.

Spain, formerly their Rival Kingdom, they have reduced to a low condition;
Arts and Sciences, Trade and Manufactures, are much improved among them.

The Art of War they have brought to a height and perfection never known in
Greece, or among the Romans.

Long Action has formed them many fit Generals, Experienced Officers, and a
number of good Troops.

They are Skilful in Encampments, they order a Battle well; and no People
contrive better for the Subsistence of an Army.

Their Discipline is good and severe, and all Nations must yield to them in the
knowledge of Attacking and Defending places.

And by Art and Industry, they seem to have overcome Nature and Situation, in
making themselves so powerful at Sea, with but few convenient Ports, and but
little Trade, in proportion to their Neighbors.

Their present King is undoubtedly a Person of great Abilities, Wisdom, and
Conduct; he is well served in every part of his Government; his Revenue is
skillfully brought in, and frugally laid out; no Prince has so quick and
certain Intelligence; and he has wrought into his Interests a considerable
Party in every State and Kingdom in Europe.

We all know too well, what large footing he has of late years got round about
him, toward Spain, in Italy, near the Swiss Cantons, and in Germany, of both
sides the Rhine, and in the Low Countries. Whoever carefully weighs these
things, and duly considers the Strength and Policy of that Kingdom, will hardly
think the Confederates, for the present, in a condition to give the Law, or
able as yet to drive France to such a Peace, as may be now Honorable, and Safe
hereafter.

They, who believe a Peace so probable and near, ground their Opinion upon the
Poverty this long War must have brought upon France: And no doubt, the Subjects
there are reduced to excessive want, by the Universal stop that is upon Trade,
by the Dearth two unseasonable years has occasioned, and by maintaining, for
six years, a great Fleet, and such numerous Land Forces.

But the French seem to pay themselves for all their Home Miseries, with their
Fame abroad, the Majesty of their Empire, Splendour of their Court, Greatness of
their Monarch, and the noise of his Victories; like a Beast, that goes merrily
with a heavy Burden, pleased with his fine Furniture, and the Bells that
jingle about him.

For those vain appearances are, to that People, in the stead of Ease, Plenty,
and all the other Goods of Life; though they truly tend but to make their Slavery
more lasting.

Therefore while their King is thus Successful in his Arms, we have small
reason to think the Wants and Cries of his Country will constrain him to end
the War.

But suppose him in such streights, as that he willingly will listen to a
Peace; can we modestly believe him in so low a condition, as that the
Confederates may at present have such a one as will be secure and lasting?

Is he yet so distressed by the War, as to be contented things may be put upon
such a foot of Equality, that hereafter he may be compelled to observe his
Articles? for without this, any Peace we can make will be but unsound and
precarious.

Perhaps he may submit to give up Lorrain, Philipsburg, and Strasburg, and his
late Conquests in Savoy, Catalonia, and Flanders; The Pope, Venetians, and the
two Northern Crowns, shall be Mediators, and afterward* Warrantees of the
Treaty. The Confederacy shall still subsist, and upon stricter terms of Union:
But, when we have bound Sampson with these new Ropes, may he not, when he
pleases, break them from off his Arms like a Thread?

Indeed, we might promise our selves that a Peace would be good and durable, if
we were enough Superior in the War, to make him Surrender those strong places,
with which, on every side, he seems to Bridle this part of the World.

Or, if he were so distressed, as, for a Peace, to deprive himself of his
Fleet, to which the Romans compelled Carthage, and, afterward, King Antiochus,
then we in England might promise our selves future Safety.

But, while his Naval strength is unbroken; while he has that Chain of
Fortified Towns upon the Rhine; and that formidable Barrier in Flanders; while
on the side of Spain, Italy, and Switzerland, he is left in such a condition to
Invade, and so fortified against Invasion, we may make a Peace that shall give
us present ease, and put off the Evil day for a time, but we cannot pretend to
have secured our Liberties, or defeated his designs of Universal Monarchy.

Whoever carefully examines those general Treaties of Peace the French of late
years have concluded with the House of Austria, and their other Opposites, from
that of Vervin's, to that of Nimmeghen, will find they have had no effect, but
to give France a legal Title to what it possessed before by Conquest, or to
affort it time to repair the Calamities of War, and to gather Strength for new
and greater Undertakings.

We took this War in hand to assert the Liberties of Europe, and to encourage
us to carry it on, we have Examples, ancient and modern, of Nations that have
resisted great Monarchies, and who have at last worked out their Freedom by
Patience, Wisdom, and Courage.

In Defense of their Laws and Religion, the Low Countries maintained a War with
Spain from 1566 to 1648, which ended in the Peace of Munster, and in that
Struggle they fixed their Government.

Great Monarchies do easily overrun and swallow up the lesser Tirannies and
Principalities that are round about them; but they find much harder Work, and
another sort of Opposition, when they come to invade Commonwealths, or mixed
Governments, where the People have an Interest in the Laws.

Under Tirannies, where the Subjects only contend for the Choice of a Master,
the Dispute is seldom real and haerty; but, in free Countries, where the People
fight for themselves, and their own proper Wealth and Security, they are in
earnest, and defend themselves accordingly. The Persians very easily subdued
the neighboring Monarchies that made up their large Empire; but when they came
to invade the Grecians, a free People, we see how their numerous Armies, and
great Navies were at last defeated.

That War was carried on by Confederates, of which the chief were the
Lacedaemonians, and the Athenians; one a Kingly Government limited by Laws, the
other a Commonwealth; it lasted two and twenty years, reckoning from the
Battle of Marathon, to that Victory gained by Cimon, which forced the Persians
to sue for Peace.

And it may not be amiss to take notice, how the Athenians laid the whole
stress of this War upon their Naval force, pursuant to the Oracle, which told
them they should be safe within their Walls of Wood, leaving Athens it self
defenseless, that their Fleet might be the stronger.

Many more Instances may be given of great things performed in the defense of
Liberty; but then they have been done, by Men who had laid aside their Luxury,
Corruption, Self Ends, and private Ambition, and who had devoted themselves
entirely to the Common Good.

If therefore we hope to get out of this War with Honor, and, at last, make a
safe and durable Peace, we must show more than ordinary Virtue and Resolution;
we must bear patiently the Public burdens; but chiefly, we must not give our
Enemies any room to believe, either by our Actions or Councils, that we shrink
and give back, as if we thought the business too weighty for us.

Many things may happen to reward this patience, which would put us in the
Power of treating upon more equal terms.

The King of France is infirm, and in years; if he should fail, while the War
is on foot, his People, perhaps, may take that time to shake off their
Oppression; and his Son may not be able to carry on the great Machine of that
Government, with the same Steadiness, Conduct, and Authority. Or, the Dauphin
may dye, which would give the Princes of the Blood the prospect of a Minority,
always fatal, and the occasion of disorders in that Kingdom.

Besides, notwithstanding the seeming health and vigor of that Government, it
has within it dangerous Distempers, of which the symptoms appear not in this
Prosperity of their affairs, but would be seen in any Public calamity; such as
the loss of a Battle, or a total defeat at Sea, which in the course of the War
may happen.

If France should receive any shock or wound of that kind, the ill humors bred
by Oppression, and Arbitrary Power, would break out, and show themselves, in
every part of the Constitution.

These, or any other accidents that might stir up Civil Commotions in that
Kingdom, would render it incapable of a Foreign War, and consequently, procure
us more advantageous Conditions of Peace.

But the most proper Season to conclude a Peace with the French, in all
appearance, will be when they are Impoverished, and exhausted of that Money by
which they have so much prevailed, and when that sinew of War begins to slacken.

For there is a degree of Expense, which no Nation can exceed without utter
ruin, and the Public may become a Bankrupt as well as a private Person.

And since War is grown so expensive, and Trade is become so extended; and
since Luxury has so much obtained in the World, no Nation can subsist of it
self without Helps and Aids from other places; so that the Wealth of a Country
now is the Balance, which arises from the exchange with other places, of its
Natural or Artificial Product.

The Natural Product are the Fruits of the Earth; the Artificial are the
Manufactures.

That part of Trade which consists in buying Commodities in one Nation, and
selling them in another, is very little the Commerce of France.

And this Balance accrues, either from Money in specie, brought home, or
Foreign Commodities, or Credit, which one Country has upon another.

The Prince's Revenue, is a due proportion and share out of this Balance.

Whatever Nation is at a greater expense than this Balance admits of, will as
surely be ruined in time, as a private Person must be, who every year spends
more than the Income of his Estate.

And that Prince, who gathers more than this Balance will naturally afford,
must as certainly bring ruin upon his Country, because he lives upon the quick
Stock of his People.

The ordinary Public Revenue of France was, before this War, yearly, about one
hundred and fifty Millions of Livres, which reduced to our Money, is about
twelve Millions Sterling.

We all know how hardly this great Sum was extorted from the People, but they
were enabled to pay it by the Balance that arose to them from the vent of
their Commodities and Manufactures.

Their most Staple Trade was Wine, Oil, Salt, Linen, and Paper, their
Manufactures are innumerable; and a vast profit they did constantly make by the
resort of strangers to their Country, and likewise by furnishing all Europe
with their Fineries and Vanities.

The ordinary Revenue must needs be much impaired by the effects of the War;
but this we may suppose, is made up to the King by extraordinary Means. For we
cannot think he maintains his Government, Fleet, and Armies, at a less Expense
than Twelve Millions yearly.

Now how this Expense can be long continued by the French, is hardly
imaginable, when there is such an Interruption upon their Commerce, and so
little vent for their Commodities and Manufactures.

They are cut off by this War from almost all their profitable Trade, their
Poor are unimploy'd, and the Growth of their Country sticks upon their hands,
and their Body Politic, being at a continual Expense of Spirits, without the
usual Supplies and Reliefs, must fall into Faintness, and Decay in all its
Members. The Balance arising from Trade being wanting, which should maintain
King and People, there must inevitably follow, at first private Want, and then
public Poverty. And if this Interruption of their Commerce be yet more
strictly pursued, it will bring a Ruin upon them, not to be avoided by all
their Economy, Courage and Policy.

We have maintained this War six years, and may hold it out much longer, if
every part of the Confederacy would exert all its Natural Force, and apply it
usefully to the common Business.

But then the Emperor must not be contending for Dominion at Home, while he is
fighting for Liberty Abroad. He must give the Princes of the Empire no
Jealousy that he has any Designs upon their Freedoms. He must not let the
Priests divert his his Arms upon the Turks, of which the true meaning is only
the Oppression of the Protestants in Hungary. A good Peace on that side would
give new Life to the Confederate Affairs.

A little more public Spirit and Vigor would be necessary in the Spanish
Councels, in which Kingdom there is great Power and Wealth remaining, if it
were rightly applied and well ordered.

The proper and natural Strength of England and Holland is at Sea. The Walls of
Wood are our best defense, and the more we rely upon, and improve that
Strength, the more we shall break the Measures of France.

But England is the main Pillar of the Confederacy; our Riches supply it; our
Fleet and the Goodness of our Troops, are its chief Force and Reputation; all
depend upon the Councels we take; if we are unwilling, or unable to support the
War, a Peace will be concluded upon the best Terms that can be had.

So that the whole will result in this, how far we in England, are able to
maintain such a long War with France, as may procure us a Peace that shall be
equal and lasting.

It Is true, a long War is but a Melancholy Prospect to a Luxurious People,
fearful of Slavery, and yet unwilling to pay the Price of Liberty; which no
Nation hardly ever obtained, but at a great Expense of Blood and Treasure.

Whenever this War ceases, it will not be for want of mutual Hatred in the
opposite Parties, nor for want of Men to fight the Quarrel, but that side must
first give out where Money is first failing.

If we in England can put our Affairs into such a Posture, as to be able to
hold out in our Expense longer than France, we shall be in a condition to give
the Peace; but if otherwise, we must be contented to receive it.

For War is quite changed from what it was in the time of our Forefathers;
when, in a hasty Expedition, and a pitched Field, the Matter was decided by
Courage; but now the whole Art of War is in a manner reduced to Money; and now
adays that Prince, who can best find Money to feed, cloth, and pay his Army,
not he that has the most valiant Troops, is surest of Success and Conquest.

So that the present Business England is engaged in, will chiefly depend upon
the well contriving and ordering the Ways and Means, by which the Government is
to be maintained, and making the public Charge easy and supportable.

By what has been said before, it may perhaps appear, that the Interruption of
Trade has made this War very heavy upon the People of France, from which
naturally follows, that a careful and vigorous Protection of our own Trade,
will make all public Burdens lighter and easier to us.

Trade, as it is now become the Strength of the Kingdom, by the Supply it
breeds of Seamen, so it is the living Fountain from whence we draw all our
Nourishment; it disperses that Blood and Spirits through all the Members, by
which the Body Politic subsists.

The Price of Land, Value of Rents, and our Commodities and Manufactures rise
and fall, as it goes well or ill with our Foreign Trade.

It Is not enough to have great Exportation, and great Importation, unless we
are Gainers upon the Balance; which the Nation cannot be at the foot of the
Account, while there are very great Losses at Sea.

For the Profit of Trade is not the Advantage the Merchant makes at Home, but
what the whole Nation gets clear and Nett, upon the Balance in Exchange with
other Countries of its Commodities and Manufactures.

So that if we can protect our Trade to that degree as to be Gainers by the
General Balance, the Expense and Length of the War will not so much affect us;
for Trade, well secured, will bring in that Wealth by which it may be fed and
maintained.

To support a long War, the Taxes should be so contrived, as that they may lie
equally upon the Nation; and when they are equally laid, they will in
Consequence be easier, and longer, and more patiently suffered. For he that is
to carry a great Burden, should not reasonably be put to bear it upon one Arm,
and that extended at length; but it ought rather to be placed upon his
Shoulders, so that every Limb may bear its due proportion of the Weight.

The Ways and Means to supply the Government, in this War, should be such, as
may not too highly affect Trade, upon the Prosperity of which depends, in so
great a measure, the Welfare of the Nation.

What we give should be as free as possible from the Load of paying
Interest-Money, which eats upon the Public, as it ruins any private Person.

And, in Taxing the People, we should have regard not to create Disaffection to
the Government.

We should likewise see that our present Gifts should not, in their
Consequences, bring Damage to the ordinary Revenue of the Crown; for, in such
cases, we give of one hand, and take away of the other.

And lastly, in our Ways and Means of Supplying the War, we should take some
care not to entail upon the Kingdom too large a Debt of perpetual Interest.

Taxes, which have all these Inconveniences, that are laid unequally, that
affect Trade, that consume us with Usury, that disaffect the People, that
prejudice the Crown Revenue, and burden us with perpetual Interest, may be
made use of now and then, to piece out, and answer a single and a short
necessity; but cannot be repeated often, and made use of, as the constant Ways
and Means of supplying the Government, in a business of length, without great
damage and hazard to the Kingdom.

For Taxes of this nature beget public and private Poverty, make the People
desperate, render Government uneasy to the Rulers, and may be rather said to
fight secretly against the Prince, than to give him any true assistance.

The Opinion, which from year to year has prevailed, That the next Campaign
would end the War, has made us bear with these Ways and Means of Supply,
believing every such charge would be the last of that kind that should be laid
upon the People.

Perhaps we should have taken other Measures, if, at the beginning of the War,
the Nation had been thoroughly convinced, that Peace was at such a distance from
us.

Some are of Opinion, that if at first we had fallen upon Excises, we had
established a Fond of Revenue, which would have lain equally upon the whole,
been a constant and easy Supply, and tending less than other Taxes, to the
damage of Foreign Trade, or ruin of the Gentry; and which, by this time, might
have been so improved in the management, that we should have found it singly of
it self, sufficient for all the Expenses of the War.

And it is not improbable, if the King of France had seen us open such a new
vein of Treasure, we had long since had a more advantageous Peace than we can
expect: at present.

It had given him a great Opinion and Awe of our strength, if he had seen we
had been able to raise five Millions a year, in a way not very burthensom to
the Nation; and he could have expected no good issue from a contest with so
rich and powerful a People:

But if he finds we raise Money for the War, by Ways and Means heavy and
destructive to our Country, he will be encouraged to pursue it till he has
brought utter ruin upon us.

And though it appears from the Books of Hearth Money, that there are not above
Thirteen hundred thousand Families in England; and, allowing six persons to a
House, one with another, which is the common way of computing, not quite eight
Millions of People; and though (as likewise appears from the Hearth Books) there
are five hundred thousand poor Families in the Nation, living in Cottages, who
contribute little to the Common Support; yet the Eight hundred thousand
remaining Families, would be able to carry on the present business a great
while longer, and, perhaps, till France is weary of it, if the Public Burdens
could be divided a little more equally among them.

It seems evident enough, that the War cannot be supported by the present
Revenue of the Crown; of which, as also how it stood at the beginning of the
Revolution, it may not be improper to give an Account.

The chief Branches of the Revenue, according to a Computation delivered to the
House of Commons at the beginning of the Revolution, stood clear of all
charges, in the Collection, as follows.
THE Tunnage and Poundage, including the Wood-Farm, Coal-Farm, and Salt-Farm,
was computed at l. 600,000 The Excise on Beer and Ale, etc. Year ending 24th
June 1689, did produce -- 666,383 The Hearth Money about -- 245,000 The Post
Office about -- 65,000 The Wine Licenses about -- 10,000 New Impositions upon
Wine and Vinegar granted for four Years, the year ending 29th Sept. 1688, about
-- 172,901 Duty on Tobacco and Sugar, for the same time in the same year, about
148,861 Duty on French Linen, Brandy, Silk, etc. which was to continue to the
1st of July 1690, for the year ending 29th of September 1688, produced --
93,710 Total -- 2,001,855
The chief Branches of the Revenue at present, clear of all Charges in the
Collection, stand as follows.
THE Tunnage and Poundage, including the Wood-Farm, Coal-Farm, and Salt-Farm,
Year ending 29th September 1693, did produce -- l. 286, 687 The Excise on Beer
and Ale, etc. Year ending 24th June 1693, produced -- 391,275 The Hearth Money
-- 000000 The Post Office, the same Year -- 63,517 The Wine Licenses, the same
Year about -- 5000 New Impositions upon Wine Vinegar, etc. Year ending 29th
September 1693, produced -- 133,595 Duty on Tobacco, etc. Year ending 29th
September 1693, produced -- 75,611 Duty on Silk, etc. Year ending 29th
September 1693 -- 148,430 The Additional Impositions took place from March 1.
169 2/3. and from that time to 29th September 1693, produced only -- 16,203 The
Additional Duties upon Beer, Ale, etc. computed at -- 450,000 Total --
1,570,318
But of the 1,570,318 l. which is reckoned the present Revenue, all but 746479
l. which arises from Customs, old Excise, Post Office, and Wine Licenses, is
either anticipated by Act of Parliament for the War, or applied to the uses of
it; indeed, something of the Ninepences will come into the Crown as the Lives
fall. The Salt Duty, and new Imposition upon the Tunnage of Ships, are to stand
in the room of two Nine-pences, till they come to be clear of their former
anticipations.

The other smaller Branches of the Revenue, such as the Hereditary Customs,
Fines for Writs of Covenant and Entries in the Alienation Office, Land Revenue,
Duchy of Cornwall, Duchy of Lancaster, First Fruits and Tenths, Sheriffs
Proffers, Compositions in the Exchequer, Fines of Leases, and Custody of
Idiots, Forfeitures of Recusants, Fines for Misdemeanors, Post Fines and
Seisures, are all inconsiderable, and so charged with Pensions and Salaries of
Officers, that they produce very little clear to the King.

The Tonnage and Poundage, etc. in time of Peace, will undoubtedly by degrees
rise, but then Trade must be courted and handled gently.

The Excise on Beer and Ale, etc. has been lately under so many discouragements
of all kinds, as that Branch will be found to mount very slowly.

The Hearth Duty is taken off by Law, as an unpopular Revenue; yet all the
hardships and abuses of it, might have been corrected by Act of Parliament, and
it would still have yielded about 200,000 l. per Annum, above the charge of
Management; and however the Nation disgust it, it is hardly so odious, if
rightly examined, as Poll-Money, which the Turks take to be so great a Badge of
Slavery, that they impose it on none but Christians.

The present Revenue being so far unable to support the War, what was wanting
has been hitherto made up by other Ways and Means, of which some are thought
very prejudicial to the Nation.

Giving the King Money by Anticipating the Customs, or by Credit, upon distant
Fonds, does apparently consume the Public with Usury: The new Fonds entail upon
us a heavy Debt of perpetual Interest.

The Additional Nine-pences upon Beer and Ale, do manifestly hurt that Branch
of the King's Revenue.

It Is feared frequent Polls may disaffect the People. The new Customs and
Impositions upon Tunnage, are thought to prejudice Trade. And lastly, the Land
Taxes by Monthly Assessment seem unequally laid; and the Pound Rate, of four
Shillings in the Pound, does seem unequally Levied upon the Nation. But of each
in their order.

Of Anticipating the Customs and Credit upon distant Fonds.
THat such Ways and Means of Supplying the Government, occasion ill Husbandry
in the Public, will appear plainly to any one, that takes the pains to examine
what great Sums have been paid on Account of Interest-Money and Gratuities; and
let the King be either to buy Stores, or to pay his Fleet and Army, it will be
found at the long run, that 700,000 l. in ready Money, will go farther than a
Million in Tallies.

Of the New Fonds for Interest.
THE Fonds for Interest were, perhaps, good expedients, for the time, to raise
Money, but, if made use of frequently, may produce very bad effects in the
Nation; for they divert Money too much from the Chanel of Trade, where it is
always best employed to the Kingdoms advantage.

There is already, paid upon these sort of Fonds, about, 400,000 l. Yearly.
It Is true, what is out upon Lives, will by degrees wear off; but a great part
of this Sum will be a lasting Rent Charge upon the Nation: and if we should
further increase it by new Projects of the same nature, we shall quickly be in
the condition of Spain, where they are undone by paying Taxes to one another;
and where the Public Revenue is so clogged with perpetual Interest, that
apparently there is not wherewithal to supply the present Necessities of the
Government.

But the principal Mischiefs these Fonds occasion, is the raising Money above
the Price, which either our Foreign or Domestic Trade can afford to pay for
it, to the great discouragement of both.

They who have traced the Effects, which lessening Interest-Money by Law in
this Kingdom has produced, do very well observe, that when Money was brought
from Ten to Eight per Cent, our Trade presently increased upon it, and doubled
in some time after it was reduced from Eight to Six per Cent; and if the
abatement of Interest did bring along with it that good Advantage, we must
expect to see Trade labor under great difficulties, and in a short time come
to Nothing, if, by the means of these Fonds, Money be restored to its former
Rate of Eight per Cent.

They are so Inviting, and of such infinite Profit, that few now are willing to
let out their Money to Traders at Six per Cent. as formerly; so that all
Merchants, who subsist by Credit, must in time give over, and they being the
greatest part, and, perhaps, the most Industrious, any Man may judge what
damage this will be to the Kingdom.

So that these Fonds of Interest, are Ways and Means of Supplying the War,
which in all appearance are to be used tenderly, and with great caution.

Of the Additional Duties upon Beer and Ale.
THE Excise upon Beer and Ale, Brandy, Strong Waters, etc. was in a gradual and
constant way of Improvement from 1674 to 1689, inclusive; which year it
produced, clear of all Charge, 667, 383 l. 11 s. 9 d. ^.

Ever year since it has fallen, and by much larger steps than ever it mounted.

But because since the War there is little Brandy Imported, and Strong Waters
are now charged in another manner, and at other Rates than formerly; the Fall
of this Revenue will more plainly appear, by making the Account up only for
Beer and Ale, which produced as follows.

Note, What follows is the gross Account.

l. s. d. Year ending 24 June 1689 -- 694,476 02 6 Year ending 24 June 1690 --
633,822 14 6 Year ending 24 June 1691 -- 554,769 10 6 Year ending June 24 1692
-- 515,455 08 3 Year ending 24 June 1693 -- 488,442 14 7 1/4

The Accounts of the year ending the 24th of June 1694, are not yet made up;
but the Excise, by a Medium of four years, having fallen hitherto about 50,000
l. per Annum, it is probable the last Year has done the like; and, if so, it is
now 250,000 l. per Annum less than it was in 1689.

This great Decrease is, by the Commissioners of that Revenue, chiefly
attributed to the new Additional Duties, which in the Country have made numbers
of Victuallers, in every County, leave of their Trade; and in London, put many
private Families to brew their own Drink.

The Three nine Pences upon Beer and Ale will not amount to much more than
420,000 l. per Annum; and if, as is alleged, they are the real Cause the old
Revenue is diminished yearly 250,000 l. the public gets but 190,000 l. per
Annum, by a Tax that will be a long and very grievous Burden upon all the
Barly-Land of England, and which is particularly heavy upon one Trade,
otherwise enough oppressed by the Quartering of Soldiers.

It Is true, these Duties were a present Expedient, and did help out toward the
Supply of the War; but for a long time hereafter they will apparently very much
diminish the ordinary Revenue of the Crown.

Of Poll-Money.
THere is nothing can make it better apparent how displeasing Poll-Money is to
the People, than the Observation how ill it is brought in, and answered to the
King. For where Taxes seem hard and oppressive, in particular to the Poor, the
Country Gentlemen proceed in the Levying of them with no Zeal nor Affection.

The first single Poll that was given in this Reign, amounted to 288, 310 l. 19
s. 6 1/^ 3 with which the Quarterly Poll holds no manner of Proportion. It Is
true, the Qualifications are taxed differently in the two Acts. Money is
charged in the first, and not in the second, and Titles are put higher in one
than the other. But considering how many were brought in by the second Act, and
at high Rates, which were not reached by the first, the Quadruple Poll might
reasonably have produced near four times as much as the Single, and it yielded
little more than half.

Quarterly Poll.
l. s. d. London, Middlesex,and Westminster -- 97,622 5 11 Rest of England --
499,896 7 1 Total -- 597,518 13 0 Single Poll.
l. s. d. London, Middlesex,and Westminster -- 80,280 9 4 Rest of England --
208,030 10 2 Total -- 288,310 19 6 Total of the Quarterly Poll -- 597,518 13 0
Difference -- 309,207 13 5

The Houses in England, as appears by the Books of Hearth-Money, are about
1,300,000, of which 500,000 are Cottages, inhabited by the Poorer Sort; so that
we may reckon there are not above 800,000 Families liable to the Payment of
Poll-Money; and though, in the common Computation of the whole People, there
may not be above six Persons to a House, one with another, yet, in computing
the 800,000 Richer Families, we may very well allow them to contain, one with
another, seven Persons, which would be 5,600,000 Heads; and reckon but a third
Part of these qualified within the Act to pay four Shillings per Head, the Poll
Bill on that single Article, ought to have produced 373,333 l.

What the one Pound per Quarter upon Gentlemen and Merchants worth 300 l. and
such as belong to the Law; and what the Ten Shillings per Quarter upon
Tradesmen, Shopkeepers, and Vintners worth 300 l. might have yielded, is
difficult to compute; but, perhaps the Commissioners Names in the Act of
Parliament for the Monthly Assessment, Quarto and Quinto Gulielmi and Mariae
may be no ill Guide in the Matter. The Commissioners then were about Ten
thousand, and we may reasonably suppose (and any Gentleman may compute for his
own Country, and he will find) that, one Country with another, not an Eighth
Part are named Commissioners of those Persons, who in Estate, real or personal,
are worth 300 l. and if so, we may reckon there are in England 80000 Persons
liable to the Payment of one Pound per Quarter; by which Account, the King
should have received on that Article 320,000 l.

When we reflect upon the great Number of Tradesmen, Shopkeepers, and Vintners
that are in England, it cannot seem any extravagant Computation to reckon there
are 40000 Persons, of that Sort, worth 300 l. and liable to the Payment of Ten
Shillings per Quarter; upon which Head the King should have received 80000 l.
And allowing but 26667 l. for all other Persons charged by that Act, the
Quarterly Poll ought to have yielded to the King.

For the Common People at 4 s. per Head -- l. 373,333 For the Gentlemen, etc.
at 4 l. per Head -- l. 320,000 For Tradesmen, etc. at 4 l. per Head -- l.
80,000 For other Persons charged by the Act -- l. 26,667 In all -- l. 800,000
But there was received only -- l. 597,518 s. 13 d. 0
The principal Articles in this Computation seem very much confirmed by what
the first Poll yielded; for if there had not been in England about 1,867,666
Persons who paid 12 d. per Head, and about Eighty thousand of the Sort who paid
one Pound per Head, that Poll could not have produced in the Country only
208,330 l. 10 s. 2 d. for Money and Titles were generally charged in London

In the Poll now in being, such are charged who are worth in Estate, real or
personal, 600 l. which may make some difference in the second Article; but the
third Article should now increase, considering all Persons, by this Act, are to
pay Ten Shillings per Quarter that are worth 300 l. in Estate real or personal,
which seems to take in Stock of all kinds; whereas in the former Act, only
Tradesmen, Shopkeepers, and Vintners were comprehended; so that if the present
Poll were strictly collected, it would produce about 800,000 l. and yet, as far
as can be judged by the Accounts hitherto come up, it is not like to yield so
much Money as the former.

When a Tax yields no more than half what in reason might be expected from it,
we may plainly see it grates upon all sorts of People, and such Ways and Means
of raising Money should be rarely made use off by any Government.

Of the New Customs and Duty upon Tunnage.
SOme People, who contemplate the greatness of England, and the Figure it made
in the World during the former part of Queen Elizabeth's Reign, and some time
before, are led to think we were stronger without Trade than with it.

Perhaps Trade in General may have been hurtful to Mankind, because it has
introduced Luxury and Avarice, and it might be better with us if we still lived
in the Innocence and plainness of our Forefathers.

But the Circumstance of Time, and and the Posture other Nations are in, may
make things absolutely necessary, which are not good in their own Nature.

War is the occasion of Cruelty, Wickedness, and Injustice, yet an unwarlike
Nation can enjoy no safety.

Since France, Spain, Italy, and Holland have addicted themselves so much of
late years to Trade, without that Naval Force which Trade produces, we should
be continually exposed to the Insults and Invasions of our Neighbors.

So that it is now become indispensably our Interest, to encourage Foreign
Commerce, and enlarge it as much as possible.

Instead of loading that part of our Strength, we ought to court and nurse it
up with all imaginable Art and Care; it is a coy and fantastical Lady, hard to
win, and quickly lost.

With high Customs we spoil Industry, discourage the Merchant, and may in time
drive Trade to take some other Chanel; and there is hardly an Instance to be
given of a Nation, may be not of any single City, that having once lost Trade,
could ever recover it.

War, and the Scarcity of Money, are sufficient Discouragements to Foreign
Commerce, without burthening it with new Impositions.

And perhaps it may be worth while to consider, whither hereafter, in time of a
profound Peace, if part of the Customs were taken off, and some Excises given
in their room, such an Exchange might not be very beneficial to the Nation.

If the Stock of the Merchant were greater, he would be in a Condition to have
a bigger Trade. If it were not for the great Duties that must be paid for
Customs, the same Stock would carry on double the Trade.

It Is true, that excises would have the appearance of affecting Land more than
Customs.

But it is, because the Views of Men are short, and generally confined to their
own narrow Interest; and they do not duly consider how much their private
Concerns depend upon the public Welfare of Trade, and how much the Value of
Land is improved since our Trade has augmented, even from Twelve to Twenty four
years Purchase; nor how much more of their Product and Manufactures would be
exported, if Trade wore free without Clog, and in its full Prosperity.

It Is granted that Excises would something affect the Landed Man, who is the
first Seller, but if the Customs were lessened, the Price of all Foreign Goods
would diminish to the Buyer; and considering how great a Part that is of every
Man's Expense, the Country Gentleman would get in the Shire what he looses in
the Hundred.

In Nations, where the Government cannot subsist without charging every thing,
they lay perhaps great Customs; but, wherever the Public can otherways be
maintained, the Customs are low, for the Encouragement of the Merchant, who
deserves all Favor, as being the best, and most profitable Member of the
Commonwealth.

Of all the new Impositions, nothing is thought to lie so heavily on Trade, as
the Duties upon the Tunnage of Ships. It seems to pull down at once a great
part of what the Nation had been so carefully rearing up by the Act of
Navigation.

And that Tax is an Instance, how much Compassion for private Cases does more
prevail in this Country, than the Sense of Public Good. For it was once
designed to raise the Money, which was wanting at the latter end of the
Sessions, by laying a new Duty upon Wine; but because that was complained of as
very burdensome to the Spanish and Portugal Merchants, a Charge upon Tunnage
was pitched upon, which in its Consequence may prove very pernicious to the
General Trade of all England.

Of the Monthly Assessment and Aids by a Pound Rate.
SUbsidies, Fifteenths, and Tenths, were the ancient Ways and Means in this
Kingdom of supplying the Government.

But what Estates, and in what manner Land^ was thereby Rated, is a Matter very
perplexed in our Records, and would ask more time to explain, than the Brevity
designed in this Essay will admit off.

Lord Cook, Inst. 4. P. 33. and 34. values a Subsidy at 70,000 l. and Tenths
and Fifteenths at 20,000 l. and says they were Four Shillings in the Pound upon
Land, and 2 s. 8 d. upon personal Estates.

It seems probable, that for a long time there had been no Survey made of the
Land in England till 32 Hen. 8. and that for some Ages they had governed
themselves by the ancient Books. But the Affairs of that King requiring then a
great Sum of Money, the Parliament charged Land with 12 d. per Pound, and
personal Estates with 6 d. and the King had liberty to name Commissioners of
his own. The Assessors were to be upon Oath, and had Power to examine upon
Oath, all Persons of the true Value of their Estates, real and personal.

The same thing was done 34 and and 37 Hen. 8. 2 and 3 Edw. 6. and 3 and 4 Edw.
6. and 4 and 5 Philip and Mary. And, in these times, there was in a manner a
new Survey made of all the Land in the Kingdom, and thereupon the Subsidies
that came after, raised larger Sums than formerly. For we find from the
Accounts in the Exchequer, that from 1 Eliz. to 29, inclusive, the Subsidies,
one with another, amounted to at least 100,000 l. but from 31 Eliz. to 18 Jac.
1. in which time we cannot find there was any regular and strict Survey made,
the Subsidies fell to 70,000 l. or thereabouts; for which no reason can be
assigned (Land improving all the while) but that, when there had been no Survey
made for a long while, and the Assessors were left at large, the People
naturally returned to the Rates in the old Books.

How ancient the Inequality is between the Taxes in the North and West, and the
Home Counties, so much complained of, cannot easily be traced; for in an
Assessment of 400,000 l. 17 and 18 Car. 1. we find the Rates upon the Northern
and Western Counties to lie just as they do in our present Assessment; and though
there might be some reason to ease the North in that Tax, because those Parts
had been great Sufferers by the Scotch Army, yet in 1642, when that Act passed,
the Sword of Civil War was not as yet drawn; and the West and other Counties
had not yet at all been harrassed; so that the Favor which the North and West
have met with in Land Taxes, is a little older than the Civil War, and may be
attributed to that Care, which the great Number of Members they send up, have
always had of their Concerns in Parliament.

When the Civil War broke out, the Commonwealth chiefly subsisted by Excises,
for they could gather Land-Taxes only where they were strongest.

In 1647, their Authority was generally owned over all the Nation, and then
they began to raise Land-Taxes regularly by a Monthly Assessment.

When the War was over, there was real reason to ease the North and West, and
accordingly the Parliament considered what Counties had least felt the War,
those in their Assessments they rated highest, and they spared such Places as
had been most harrased by the Armies of either side; and this was the
Distinction they made (and not as is vulgarly thought) that of Associated or
Nonassociated Counties; for most Counties of England, during that War, had been
some time or other associated, and by Ordinance of Parliament.

But still perhaps it had not fared so well with the North and West,
notwithstanding their Sufferings, if their Cause had not been maintained in the
House of Commons by a sufficient Number of Friends and Advocates.

The Places which had been least sensible of those Calamities, or were soonest
rid of them, and that had been under the Wings of the Parliament, and their
Army, were London and Middlesex, Surry and Southwark, Hertfordshire,
Bedfordshire, Cambridgshire, Kent, Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Berks, Bucks, and
Oxfordshire.

And they kept to the same measure of favoring the distant Counties, and
laying the chief Burden upon those nearest London, as long as the Authority of
the Commonwealth lasted.

When King Charles the Second was restored, the Northern and Western Gentlemen
were strong enough in the House of Commons to get continued the Method of
Assessment then in practice, which was so favorable to them; and in the Act 12
Car. 2. for raising 70,000 l. for one Month, it is particularly provided, that
it shall be raised in such Proportion as the last 70,000 l. per Month was
raised by Ordinance of State; since which time till now, the Counties distant
from London, have continued in the constant Possession of being favorably
handled in all Assessments.

The first Attempt of reducing Assessments to some equality, was made in the
Year 1660.

The House of Commons, as may be seen from their Journals, had then in debate
the Settling 100,000 l. per Annum, in Compensation of the Court of Wards and
Liveries; and a Committee was ordered to frame and bring in an equal
Aportionment of the said sum upon all the Counties of England; which was done
accordingly, and delivered to the House November the 8th, 1660, and is as
follows.

Yorkshire West Riding -- l. 2520 North Riding -- l. 1930 East Riding -- l.
1350 -- l. 5800
Devon -- l. 5000 Essex -- l. 4800 Kent -- l. 4800 Suffolk -- l. 4800 Norfolk
-- l. 4800 Somerset -- l. 4000 Bristol City -- l. 250 Lincolnshire -- l. 4000
Hampshire -- l. 3000 Cornivall -- l. 2400 Wiltshire -- l. 2700 London -- l.

Berkshire -- l. 1700 Oxfordshire -- l. 1700 Leicester -- l. 1800 Hereford -- l.
1600 l. 78950 Warwick -- l. 1800 Worcester -- l. 1800 Bedford -- l. 1400
Stafford -- l. 1400 Nottingham -- l. 1400 Darby -- l. 1400 Lancashire -- l.
1600 Cheshire -- l. 1400 Rutland -- l. 380 Huntington -- l. 900 Northumberland
-- l. 700 Durham -- l. 700 Cumberland -- l. 400 Westmorland -- l. 300 Monmouth
-- l. 800 Anglesea -- l. 260 Brecknock -- l. 450 Cardigan -- l. 350 Carmarthen
-- l. 450 Carnarvan -- l. 260 Denbigh -- l. 450 Flint -- l. 260 Glamorgan -- l.
700 Merioneth -- l. 220 Montgomery -- l. 550 Pembroke -- l. 500 Radnor -- l.
240 l. 21070 l. 78950 Total is -- l. 100,020
This Aportionment was many Months in forming, and made, no doubt, with great
Deliberation and Judgment, since all the most considerable Men of those Times
were of that Committee.

It Is apparent, that in the Assessment of the Rates upon each County, and by
comparing the Sums, it may be seen, that they chiefly governed themselves, by
the Proportions which had been observed in rating the Ship Money.

They had before them the Assessment of the 400,000 l. 17 and 18 Car. 1. which,
because it was made in Parliament, they would, no doubt, have followed, if they
had not judged it Partial.

But it seems they rather chose to follow the Rates observed in Assessing the
Ship Money, as having been laid by Persons who had not the same reason and
Interest to favor one Country more than another.

Ship Money was an arbitrary and illegal Tax, therefore it concerned the
Contrivers of it to lay it as equally upon the Nation as possible; for it would
have been a double Grievance to the People, if it had been imposed, both
against Law, and also with Partiality. On the contrary, it imported the
Ministers of that time to give their new Invention all the fair Colors
imaginable, and to make that, which was unjust in its Nature, at least just and
equal in its Manner; and no doubt, in the Rating of it, they had duly weighed
and considered the Strength and Weakness, Riches and Poverty, Trade and
Fertility, and every Circumstance of each particular County; with some regard
also to the Proportion it bore in the ancient Subsidies.

And, upon these Grounds, it is more than probable the Committee of the House of
Commons proceeded in 1660, when they made the Ship Money their Model and
Pattern of a fair and equal Assessment.

Since the late War with France, Land has been Taxed in different manners, by
an Assessment, and by a Pound Rate; but both ways, it will perhaps appear, that
the North and West have not born their due share and proportion of the Common
Burden.

The first Aid given to Their Majesty's upon Land, was by a Monthly Assessment
of 68,820 l. 19 s. 1 d. per Month, Primo Guil. and Mariae.

The second Aid upon Land was of 12 d. per Pound. In this Act Their Majesty's
had power to Nominate the Commissioners under the Great Seal of England, but
were advised to put in all the same Persons again, who had been Commissioners
in the Monthly assessment: The Assessors in this Act were upon Oath, Primo
Guil. and Mariae.

The third Aid upon Land was of 2 s. in the Pound. In this Act the Assessors
were upon Oath, Primo Guil. and Mariae.

The fourth Aid upon Land was by a Monthly Assessment of 137, 641 l. 18 s. 2 d.
per Month, 2 Guil. and Mariae.

The fifth Aid upon Land was by the same Monthly Assessment, 3 Guil. and Mariae.

The sixth Aid upon Land was by a Pound Rate of 4 s. in the Pound. In this Act
the Assessors are not upon Oath, 4 Guil. and Mariae.

The seventh Aid upon Land is by the same Pound Rate, and the Assessors are
upon Oath, 5 Guil. and Mariae.

In order to show what proportion each part of the Kingdom bears in the
Assessment, and in the Pound Rate, here is framed a Table of 12 Columns, which
shows,

1. What each County pays in the Monthly Assessment of 137,641 l. 18 s. 2 d.

11. What each County paid in the Assessment of 400,000 l. 17 and 18 Car. 1.

12. An Estimate of the Poor Rates, upon each County, by a reasonable Medium of
several Years, made toward the latter end of King Charles the Seconds Reign.

There is likewise summed up at the end of this Table in two separate Articles.

First, The amount in each particular of the Eleven Home Counties, which are
thought in Land Taxes to pay more than their proportion, viz. Surry with
Southwark, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgshire, Kent, Essex, Norfolk,
and Suffolk, Berks, Bucks, and Oxfordshire.

Secondly, The amount of the other Counties of England and Wales, exclusive of
London, Westminster and Middlesex, which, because they would over balance
either side, are to remain out of the Contest.

The Excise, and number of Houses and Hearths, are no ill Measures to form a
Judgment by, of the Trade, Wealth, and Abilities of a Country.

Particularly, Sir William Petty, who was esteemed the best Computer we ever
had, in all his Political Arithmetic, both for England and Ireland, did very
much govern himself by the Hearth-Money.

Some light may be also had in this matter, from the late Polls which have been
in the Kingdom.

The Article of Ship Money, shows how Persons unconcerned, did think each
County ought to be Rated.

The Aportionment of 1660, makes it appear what was the Opinion of a very able
Committee of the House of Commons, upon this Subject.

The Aid of 1 s. and 2 s. in the Pound, set down in the Table, shows that a
Pound Rate has raised more, in proportion, than it does at present; for if 3 s.
in the Pound did raise 1,566,627 l. 10 s. 9 d.. four Shillings in the Pound
ought to raise 2,088,836 l. 14 s. 4 d..

The Poor Rates, set down in the Table, may be very useful to such as love
Computations, and who are inquisitive into the Common Business of the Nation,
and desirous to know its Strength and Weakness. It was Collected with great
Labor and Expense, by Mr, Ar. Mo. a very knowing Person. He had not the
Account of Wales, but according to the proportion Wales bears to the rest of
the Kingdom in other Taxes, the Poor Rate there must have been about 33,753 l.
So that the Poor Rate, at that time, through the whole Nation, was about
665,362 l.

By the comparison of all these particulars, some light, peradventure, may be
given, and computations made, that will a little help to the forming a right
Judgment; how all parts of the Kingdom may be Rated in a Land Tax, with
somewhat more of equality.

But the Observations and Inferences, which shall be made from this Table, are
humbly submitted to such as take delight in Calculations of this kind; and it is
hoped such a Scheme will set better Judgments, and abler Heads, to work, upon a
matter that deserves so well to be effectually considered.

All substantial Merchants will acknowledge, that Stealing Customs, and Running
Goods, is against their Common Interest, because such as have that Art, are not
upon an equal foot of Trade with the rest.

In the same manner, where a Tax is unequally Levied, the Gentlemen are not
upon the same foot of maintaining their Port, and providing for their Families,
which cannot consist with the Public Good.

From the Table here set down, there may be made these Observations.

First, That it evidently appears several ways, that the North and West, or the
Counties that lie toward the North and West, are at least two thirds of
England, reckoned without London, Westminster and Middlesex.

Secondly, That there is good ground to conjecture, that the North and West, or
the Counties that lie toward the North and West, are near three fourths of the
Kingdom, reckoned without London, Westminster and Middlesex.

Thirdly, That from a General Calculation of the whole, there seems good reason
to believe, that London, Middlesex and Westminster, are not above one tenth
part of the Kingdom.

In the Excise on Beer and Ale, the North and West, compared with the Eleven
Home Counties, are As 554,117 l. is to 184,520 l. which is two full thirds. In
the number of Houses, the North and West, compared with the Eleven Home
Counties, are As 1,208,000 are to 335,543 Houses, which, is about 3 fourths. In
the number of Hearths, the North and West, compared with the Eleven Home
Counties, are -- As 2,197,959 are to 684*950 Hearths, which is much above two
thirds* In the Single Poll, the North and West, compared with the Eleven Home
Counties, are -- As 208,030 l. is to 69,428 l. which is about two thirds. In
the Quarterly Poll, the North and West, compared with the Eleven Home Counties,
are -- As 499,896 l. is to 167,626, which is about two thirds. In the
Assessment of Ship Money, the North and West, compared with the 11 Home
Counties, are As 186,800 l. is to 57,800 l. which is two full thirds. In an
Assessment of two Millions, according to the Apportionment of 1660, the North
and West, compared with the Eleven Home Counties, would be -- As 1,860,400 l.
is to 626,000 l. which is about 2 thirds. In the Poor Rates, the North and
West, compared with the Eleven Home Counties, are -- As 608,982* is to 214,
122, which is near two thirds.
So that it appears here plainly, by Eight different Instances, the North and
West are at least two thirds of the Kingdom, reckoned without London,
Westminster and Middlesex. According to which Calculation,

The Monthly Assessment Which runs thus, North and Western Counties- l. 946,118
The Eleven Home Counties- l. 529,615 London, Westminster. and Middlesex-l. 175,969
Total -- l. 1,651,702
Should run thus: North and Western Counties- l. 983,822 The Eleven Home
Counties- l. 491,911 London, Westminster. and Middlesex-l. 175,969 Total -- 1,651,702


So in the Pound Rate of 4 s. in the Pound, according to this Calculation, if
the Eleven Home Counties, which are but one third, Raise 632,388 l. the other
two thirds should Raise 1,264,776 l. And

The Pound Rate Which runs thus, North and Western Counties- l. 1,038,184 The
Eleven Home Counties- l. 632,388 London, Westminster. and Middlesex-l. 307,140 Total
-- l. 1,977,712
Should run thus: North and Western Counties- l. 1,264,776 The Eleven Home
Counties- l. 632,388 London, Westminster. and Middlesex-l. 307,140 Total -- l.
2,204,304


But, all things duly considered, there seem very probable reasons to believe,
the North and West are three fourths of the Kingdom, reckoned without London,
Middlesex and Westminster.

For, as to the Excise, all who know that Revenue must grant, that in the North
and West, the Country in many parts is so wild, and the Houses lie so
dispersed, that the Retailers cannot be so well watched as in the Home
Counties, where the Dealers are in a narrower compass, and have less
opportunities to deceive the King's Officers. More private Families take their
Drink of the Common Brewers, in the Counties near London, than at a distance,
which swells the Excise of the Home Counties. Setting that aside, and if the
Revenue could possibly be as well watched in the distant parts as it is near
London, the Excise of the North and West would, probably, answer near three
fourths of the whole, without London, etc.

As to the Polls, it is notoriously known, that the payment for Degrees and
Qualities of Persons, is by no means so narrowly looked after and exacted in
the North and West, as in the Home Counties; and if it were, the Poll-Money in
the North and West, would in all likelihood answer three fourths of the whole,
reckoned without London, etc.

As to the North and West, bearing no higher a proportion, in the Poor Rate,
than scarce two thirds with the rest of England, there is, perhaps, this to be
said, That, in the distant parts, Provisions are cheaper; so they maintain
their Poor at an easier rate than in the Counties near London.

In the North and West, their Manufactures afford Employment to the poorer
sort; and there are not so many there, who live upon the Charity of others, as
near London, where Luxury and Idleness abound.

As to the proportion each County bears in the Ship Money, and as to the Rates
which would lie upon each County in an Assessment of two Millions, pursuant to
the Aportionment of 1660, though the proportions are both ways laid with more
equality than in our present Assessment, yet we are to consider, that in those
times, when they judged the Eleven Home Counties to be a third part of the
Kingdom, it was, in respect of the Improvements of Land, earlier known, and
made use of, near the Capital City, than at a distance from it.

The Ship Money, of which the Aportionment in 1660 is a Copy, began to be
Levied in 1636; at which time we may well imagine, that near London, all sorts
of ways to meliorate Land were found out, and put in practice, such as
Disparking Parks, Grubbing Woods, Enclosing and Dreining Fenny Ground, etc.

So that the Home Counties, which were scarce a seventh part in quantity of
Acres, to the rest of England, might, in the Year 1636, be well judged a third
part in the value of Rents.

But the various ways of Improving Land, are now of late Years got into the
Northern and Western Counties; Clover, Cinqfoin, Trefoin, Marl, and Lime, are
particularly beneficial to Countries that have great store of Barren Ground.

The North and West of late Years, have had a greater proportion of Foreign
Trade than the Home Counties.

The use of Sea-Coal in London, has more than trebled of late Years, which is a
great advantage to the North.

The Prohibition of Irish Cattle, is wholly beneficial to the Northern and
Western Counties, and has improved their Land, and is hurtful to the rest of
England.

Land seems to have been almost at the height of its Improvement, and near the
Rack Rerit, about the Year 1636, in the Eleven Home Counties.

And in the North and West, it has been ever since Improving; so that, in all
probability, those Counties which were formerly rated as two thirds, may now be
esteemed and valued as three fourths of the Kingdom.

Upon the whole Matter, the Hearth-Money seems the best Measure to form a
Judgment by, of the Wealth of each County; and, by consequence, what proportion
it ought to bear in any Land Tax.

For, from the number of Houses, we may compute the People.

Where the numbers of People are, generally speaking, there are the
Manufactures, and Consumption of Home Commodities; there is the Wealth and
Trade; and there Land improves, and Rents are highest.

In the number of Houses, the North and West, are about three fourths of the
Kingdom.

From whence, upon probable grounds, may be inferred, that the North and West
are three fourths of the Rents and Value of England, still reckoning without
London, etc.

And if so, and if the Eleven Home Counties are but a fourth part, the Monthly
Assessment should run thus: l. s. North and Western Counties -- 1,106,799 18
The Eleven Home Counties -- 368,933 6 London, Westminster. and Middlesex. -- 175,969
12 Total -- 1,651,702 16

And it likewise follows, that if in the Pound Rate of 4 s. per Pound, the
Eleven Home Counties, which are here reckoned but at a fourth part of the
Kingdom, produced 632,388 l. then the North and West, which are three fourths,
should produce 1,897,164 l.

And a Pound Rate of 4 s. in the Pound, throughout the whole Kingdom, would be,
North and Western Counties -- l. 1,897,164 The Eleven Home Counties -- l.
632,388 London, Westminster and Middlesex-l. 307,140 Total -- l. 2,836,692


It may be seen, in the Accounts of the Exchequer, that, in the Ancient
Subsidies, the North and Western Counties have been all along favored, and the
reasons for it may be easily assigned. Worcestershire, Gloucestershire,
Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Cheshire, were subject to the Incursions of the
Welsh. The four Northern Counties, and Yorkshire, were always to be upon their
Guard, against the Inroads of the Scotch. The Western parts lay exposed to
Descents, and Invasions of the French; so that the private and particular
Charge in their Defense, which lay upon those Counties more than others, might
be a sufficient Cause to give them Ease in all Public Burdens.

The Parliament, 17 and 18 Car. 1. in their Assessment of 400,000 l. plainly
took their Measures from the Ancient Subsidies.

And with that Assessment, Car. 1. agree the Rates laid upon each County by the
Commonwealth.

And what the North and West pay in the Pound Rate, and what is laid upon them
in our present Monthly Assessment, seem to answer it exactly; all which may be
seen by comparing the Rates in the Table upon each County.

But the Equity and Reasons ceasing, which made our Ancestors so favorable to
them, and they enjoying the same common Protection, and the Public Necessities
requiring great Sums of Money; it seems but just and fair that they should
neither favor themselves, nor oppose the being, in all Taxes, upon an equal
Foot with the rest of the Nation.

The last Observation offered from the Table, is, that London, Westminster and
Middlesex are not above a Tenth Part of the Kingdom, which, if plainly made
out, will clear a great many Points, and very much confirm the Calculation that
has been made of what the North and West might raise in the Pound Rate.

In London, Westminster and Middlesex, the Pound Rate of four Shillings in the
Pound seems to have been well and justly Levied (except in the Article of Money
at Interest) and did raise 307,140 l.

Now if we could come at an exact Knowledge, what Proportion the Rents and
Value of those Places bear to the rest of England, it would be a very good
Guide to the forming a Computation, what the Pound Rate, fairly and Impartially
levied, would raise in the whole Kingdom.

In the Aid of 4 Shillings per Pound, London, Westminster and Middlesex,
compared with the rest of England, are -- As 307,140 l. is to 1,977,713 l.
which is near a sixth. In the Assessment of 400000 l. 17 and 18 Car. 1. London,
Westminster and Middlsex, compared with the rest of England, are -- As 54,831
l. is to 403,159, which is near a Seventh. In the present Monthly Assessment,
London, Westminster and Middlesex, compared with the rest of England, are -- As
175,969 l. is to 1,651,702 l. which is above a Tenth. In the Single Poll,
London, Westminster and Middlesex, compared with the rest of England, are -- As
80,280 l. is to 288,310 l. which is about a Fourth -- In the Quarterly Poll,
London, Westminster and Middlesex, compared with the rest of England, are -- As
97,622 l. is to 597,518 l. which is about a Sixth. In two Millions, according
to the Aportionment of 1660, London, Westminster and Middlesex, compared with
the rest of England, are -- As 140,000 l. is to 2,000,400 l, which is about a
Fourteenth. In the Ship Money, London, Westminster and Middlesex, compared with
the rest of England, are -- As 20,180 l. is to 206,980 l. which is about a
Tenth. In the Excise on Beer and Ale, London, Westminster and Middlesex,
compared, with the rest of England, are -- As 140,358 l. is to 694,476 l. which
is about a Fifth. In the Number of Houses, London, Westminster and Middlesex,
compared with the rest of England; are -- As 111,215 is to 1,319,215 Houses,
which is near an Eleventh. In the Number of Hearths, London, Westminster, and
Middlesex, compared with the rest of England, are -- As 365,568 is to 2,563,527
Hearths, which is about a Seventh. In the Poor Rates, London, Westminster and
Middlesex, compared with the rest of England, are -- As 56,380 l. is to 665,362
l.
Whatever Proporation London, etc. bear to the rest of the Kingdom, it is plain,
in the Four Shilling Aid, they pay as about a Sixth Part of the whole.

It Is true likewise, that in the Assessment of 400,000 l. 17 and 18 Car. 1.
they are valued at about a seventh Part; but we are to consider the
Circumstance of that time; the Parliament wanting a present Sum to pay off the
Debts they were engaged in, which no Place could so soon raise as London.

In the single Poll they seem about a fourth Part; and in the Quarterly Poll,
much about a Sixth; and the reason of the difference is in the Single Poll, the
Payment for Qualities and Degrees of Persons was strictly exacted in London,
and not in the Country; which swells the Article of London. In the Quarterly
Poll it was neither looked after in the Country, nor in London, which we see
paid little more to the Quarterly Poll than to the Single.

But in both Polls, and both for London and the Country, if we deduct from the
whole Sum, what was paid on the Account of Degrees and Qualities, it will be
found that London, Westminster, and Middlesex answer about a Tenth Part of the
Kingdom.

In the Excise they appear to be about a fifth Part; but the reason for that is
obvious, because in London, almost all pay Excise for their Drink, which is not
so in the Country, but in the Consumption of Malt, London, etc. will be found
about a Tenth part of the whole.

In the Number of Hearths they seem about a seventh part; the reason of that is
also apparent, for that in the Country, to save the Duty, the common People
took away such Hearths, of which they had not absolute use.

But in Number of Houses, London, Westminster and Middlesex are not an Eleventh
part of the Kingdom.

And by the Monthly Assessment it appears, that the Parliament have judged them
about a Tenth part.

In the Apportionment of 100,000 l. upon the whole Nation in the Year 1660,
they are valued and rated at about a Fourteenth part.

In the Assessment of Ship Money, at about a Tenth part.

And in an Assessment of 30,000 l. given to Harry the Seventh, in lieu for that
time of the Aid, Pur fair sitz Chivaleer and pur file Marrier Rot. Parl. 19
Har. 7. No. 10. London, Westminster and Middlesex are rated at but 889 l. 10 s.
2 d. which is about a thirty third part of that Tax.

And in the Poor Rate, they appeared to be about a Twelfth part of the Whole.

Upon the whole Matter, from the foregoing Instances, and many others that
might be given, it seems very probable that London, Westminster and Middlesex
have been generally esteemed, and are about a Tenth part of the Kingdom.

But the Instance which relates to the Number of Houses, is what we may
reasonably lay most weight upon in the present Dispute; because the 307,140 l.
which they pay in the Four Shilling Aid, does most of it, without all
contradiction, arise from the Rent of Houses.

If indeed Money were strictly inquired after, and if the Charge upon Personal
Estates made up a great part of the forementioned Sum, the Comparison might not
hold; because the great Stocks of Money are in London; but though Money be
charged in the Act, the Law has not been able, hitherto, to reach it
effectually.

Now, to raise the Sum of 307,140 l. the general Rental of London, Middlesex
and Westminster must be upwards of a Million and a half per Annum.

And if the Rental of the Eleventh (but suppose them a Tenth part of the whole)
be a Million and a half, the general Rental of the Kingdom must be Fifteen
Millions per Annum.

And if the general Rental of the Kingdom be Fifteen Millions per Annum, the
Aid of Four Shillings in the Pound ought to raise three Millions.

If 111,215 Houses in and about London, with no more Ground than what they
stand upon, are, in Rent, one Million and a half per Annum, it is hardly
possible but that the 1,208,000 Houses in the Country, with all the Land about
them, and all the Benefits that attend Land, must be in Rent Thirteen Millions
and a half per Annum.

And whoever considers this seriously, will perhaps be inclined to think, that
the Four Shilling Aid would raise at least Three Millions, if it were levied in
other Parts of England with the same Care and Exactness as it is in London,
Westminster and Middlesex, which are under the Eye and Influence of the
Government.

And if the Aid could be brought to raise such a Sum, the War would almost be
maintained by the Charge upon Land only.

It Is notoriously known that a great many Persons, both in the Assessment and
Aids, pay a full Fifth part of their Estates; if the rest did so, all would be
upon an equal foot; which, in Justice and Reason, the Subjects of the same
Prince should be in every good Government.

But this will be very hard to compass in that long Possession many Countries
are in, of being favorably handled in all Taxes.

It Is true, in the present Aid the Assessors are upon Oath, but, in Matters of
Revenue, it has been always found that Oaths are very little regarded.

If in the Customs and Excise all Entries were to be made upon Oath of the
Parties, and the King had no other hold, he might indeed save the Charge of
Officers, but he would see very little from those Revenues.

The Officers in the Customs and Excise are upon Oath; but if there were no
other Checks upon them, those Branches would turn to small account.

And we see in the present Charge upon Interest-Money, how little Scruple Men
make of Swearing not to have 100 l. who are generally thought to be worth
20,000 l.

Taxes can never be equally levied where the People are left to themselves, or
with no other Check upon them, but their own Consciences.

Therefore it was the ancient Prerogative of our Kings, to name their own
Commissioners for the Levying and Collecting such Aids, Fifteenths, and Tenths,
as their Subjects gave them: which may be seen by the old Commissions, ad
Assidendum and Colligendum, that were wont to accompany Grants of that Nature.

In that Aid which was granted to Harry the Third, when Magna Charta passed,
there is the Form of that Commission, Vid. Rot. Pat. 39. H. 3. m. 8. Dorso.

And such Commissions passed several times after, Vid. Rot. Pat. 1. Edw. 2. p.
m. 3. Rot. Pat. 7. Edw. 2. p. m. 3. Rot. Pat. 3. Edw. 3. ps. 3. m. 18. Rot.
Pat. 6. Edw. 3. ps. m. 19. Rot. Fin. 23. Edw. 3. m. 10. And in the other Grants
that came afterward, the King is desired to issue out his Commissions for the
levying of them, as customably. Vid. Rot. Parl. 6. Rich. 2. No. 16. Rot. Parl.
2. Harry 4. N. 9. Rot Parl. 14. Harry 6. N. 12. where the Commissioners have
Power to examine all Parties upon Oath of the true Value of their Estates.

In the Reign of Harry the Sixth, there is an Authority given to one Lord, and
the two Knights of the Shire in each County, who seem to have been in the
nature of Commissioners, to see that no Wrong be done in the Distribution of
4000 l. which was to be deducted out of the Aid for decayed Towns and Places.
Vid. Rot. Parl. 11. H. 6. N. 4.

The first time we find Commissioners named in Parliament for the levying
Tenths and Fifteenths, was in Edward the Fourth's Reign, who was a Luxurious
Prince, and gave the People reason to suspect his Conduct. Vid. Rot. Parl. 12.
Edw. 4. N. 41. and 14. Edw. 4. N. 7.

The Records are both dark enough, but the Parliament seems there to name
Commissioners, whom the King shall Authorize under the Great Seal, to Assess
and Levy the Aid, and that the Money so levied, shall remain in the Hands of
the Collectors, to be appointed by the King in Chancery, unto the time that
Proclamation shall be made by the King of his Musters.

The Parliament suspected an Aid was desired, and no War intended, so that
their Gift seems conditional, and they name Commissioners, to see to the due
Performance of the Trust.

But afterward, in the Reign of Harry the Seventh, the occasion of naming
Commissioners in Parliament, seems a great deal more apparent.

For that covetous Prince was wont to ask great Aids of his People, on pretense
of Wars, that were never intended,

Therefore the Aids which were given him the Twelfth of his Reign were, upon
this Condition, to be levied upon the People, if the War proceeded; but not to
be levied if a Peace or Truce ensued before they came to be due: and it was
upon the score of this Trust, that in all probability, the Parliament named
Commissioners of the Shires, with the Justices of the Peace to be Associated.
Vid Rot. Parl. 12. H. 7. N. 12. and N. 13.

But Commissioners have been several times since named by the King; as 34 and
37 Hen. 8. 2 and 3 Edw. 6. 3 and 4 Edw. 6. 4 and 5 Phil. and Mary, 15 and 22
Car. 2.

But there is a President for this in the first Year of Their present Majesty's
Reign; and if, pursuant to the Powers given in that Act, the King had named
Commissioners of his own in every County, for levying the Aid of one Shilling
in the Pound, there might have been a new Survey made of all the Rents in
England; and, in all likelihood, such Sums would have been raised upon Land
only, as might have near answered all the Necessities of the Government.

The second Pound Rate did not raise so much in proportion as the first; and
there is ground to think this last 4 Shiling Aid will not raise so much as the
former: And there is reason to believe, the Aids by Pound Rate will every time
grow less and less, (like the Subsidies in the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's,
and beginning of King James's Reign) unless there be a new, and regular Survey
made of Land.

For let the Dangers from abroad, and the Wants at home, be never so pressing;
no doubt, most Men, if they are left to themselves, will be glad to save their
Money; and will rather consult their private Interest than the Public Good.

But if the King, as was always practiced in Ancient Times, had power to name
Commissioners; and if all People were bound under great Forfeitures, to give in
a true Rental of their Estates, or a true Estimate of what they keep in their
hands; and if the Commissioners had power to Examine any person (other than the
Party himself) upon Oath, of the true value of each Man's Estate, there is
hardly any doubt to be made, but that an Aid of Four Shillings in the Pound
would raise Three Millions.

And if Land could raise that Sum, the Nation need not be put to such
dishonorable and dangerous shifts of raising Money, as are new Projects, fresh
Impositions upon Trade, and Fonds of Perpetual Interest; which, if they are
made use of as the constant Ways and Means of Supplying the War, must in all
appearance very quickly destroy our Foreign Commerce; and, by consequence,
bring universal Weakness and Poverty upon the whole Kingdom. But there is
nothing too hard for the Wisdom of a Parliament to bring about; which, perhaps,
may find a way to Levy the Pound Rate justly and equally in all Counties,
without giving the King Power to Name Commissioners.

The Ancient Subsidies did usually consist of a charge by Poll, a Pound Rate
upon Land, and a Pound Rate upon Money, and Personal Estates; so that all sorts
of people did contribute something in the old way of Taxing, but such as for
their Poverty were exempted.

The Usurers, who are the true Drones of a Commonwealth, living upon the Honey
without any Labor, should, of all People, be brought in to bear their
proportion of the Common Burden. As yet, they could never be effectually
reached, but they may be fetched in by the Wisdom of a Parliament, if the House
of Commons would please resolutely to set themselves about it.

What a Pound Rate of Four Shillings in the Pound, upon Money, might produce,
is very hard to compute, because, in that Matter, there is scarce any Rule or
Measure to go by; but supposing Money at Interest to be a sixteenth part (as
some think) of the annual Value and Income of England, there is then twenty
Millions of Money at Interest, (which may be, and yet not a third part of that
Sum, in specie, in the Kingdom) and if there are twenty Millions at Interest at
five per Cent. a Pound Rate of Four Shillings in the Pound, upon Money, would
raise 200,000 l.

That which has made Quarterly Polls so distastful, is charging the Poorer
sort; but if they were all exempted, a Quarterly Poll well Levied might raise
500,000 l.

And here it may not be amiss to take notice, that if, in the Pound Rate upon
Land, one Shilling were taken off from the Landlord, and placed upon the
Tenant, it would ease those who have born all the weight; nor can it seem
oppressive to the Tenants, considering how well they have fared hitherto.

So that a mixed Aid, by a Pound Rate upon Land and Money, and by a Quarterly
Poll, all carefully Levied, might raise By Four Shillings, Pound Rate, upon
Land -- l. 3,000,000 By Four Shillings, Pound Rate, upon Money -- l. 200,000 By
a Quarterly Poll -- l. 500,000 Total -- l. 3,700,000
Which, without any new Ways and means, would come very near raising that Sum
to which the Expense of the War has hitherto amounted.

If in a War that is so Expensive, and is thought so necessary for our
Preservation, all people would agree to promote Equality, no doubt great Sums
might be raised in this Nation, and the Country, in all Aids, would be found to
answer as well as London.

That London, Westminster and Middlesex, pay about a sixth part in the Aid, is
very plain; and that they are not above a Tenth part of the Kingdom's general
Rental, is very probable.

What Proportion in other Wealth and Substance London bears to the rest of
England, is very hard to determine.

But some Landed Man will start up and say, It Is true, London bears a sixth, it
ought to bear a half, it has all the Wealth; and the immoderate Growth of that
City undoes and ruins all the Country.

It may therefore be well worth the Enquiry of thinking Men, what truth there
is in this common and received Notion, that the Growth of London is pernicious
to England; That the Kingdom is like a Rickety Body, with a Head too big for
the other Members.

For some people, who have thought much upon this subject, are inclined to
believe, that the Growth of that City is advantageous to the Nation, and they
seem to ground their Opinion upon the following Reasons:

That no Empire was ever great, without having a great and populous City.

That the Romans drew all the conquered Cities of Italy into Rome.

That the People of Attica were no better than a Crew of rude Herdsmen; and
neither flourished in War, nor in Civil Arts, till Theseus persuaded them to
Inhabit Athens.

That the greatness of London will best preserve our Constitution, because,
where there is a great and powerful City, the Prince will hardly Enterprise
upon the Liberties of that People; in the same manner, a Rich and Powerful City
seldom Rebels upon vain and slight occasions.

On these grounds, and many others, some people are led to think, the Growth of
London not hurtful to the Nation; but, on the contrary, to believe that there
is not an Acre of Land in the Country, be it never so distant, that is not in
some degree bettered by the Growth, Trade, and Riches of that City.

Perhaps, if all the Wealth and Substance of London could be truly Rated, in a
Tax of four Millions, that City would pay a fourth part without any Hardship to
it.

But, probably, there is nothing but Excises that will truly and equally Rate
all sort of Wealth, and Substance, and bring in all sort of Persons, chiefly
those in great Cities, to contribute in the Public Burdens.

We have now gone through the chief VVays and Means, hitherto made use of, for
carrying on the present War, in which an Impartial Land Tax is chiefly
recommended, as most agreeable to the Ancient Constitution of this Kingdom.

If it shall be thought expedient to go by the way of a Monthly Assessment, the
Aportionment of 1660, seems a more equal distribution of the Common Burden,
than has been as yet made use of: According to which, the Home Counties would
pay as they do now; London, Westminster and Middlesex, may be Rated at the Sum
they have paid in the Aid of Four Shillings in the Pound.

And the Assessment would run thus: Northern and Western Counties -- l.
1,234,400 The Eleven Home Counties -- l. 626,000 London, Westminster and
Middlesex -- l. 307,14085 1/4 Total -- l. 2,167,54085


A far larger Sum might indeed be produced by a Pound Rate, equally and
impartially Levied through the whole Kingdom.

But some will object, That to Levy a Pound Rate strictly, by Commissioners of
the King's Naming, may occasion Oppression and Discontents in the Country; And
that such a Method of raising Taxes, may create so many Officers among the best
of the Gentry dependant upon the Court, as may be dangerous to Liberty.

Besides, the Northern and Western Counties, especially such as lie most
distant, will affirm, That out of the same value in Estates, they are not able
to pay the same Pound Rate, because their Rents are not so well Paid; their
Returns, and Markets, are not so quick; and they taste not that benefit of the
Trade, and greatness of London, in the same degree as the Home Counties.

It may be likewise objected, That Land-Taxes in general (and chiefly if
strictly Levied) must be very ruinous to the Gentry, if the War should continue
for any long time.

And since, to a Wise and Virtuous Prince, no Sum of Money can be desirable,
that is Levied with the Oppression and Discontent of his People, it may not be
amiss to enquire, what other Ways there are of Supplying the War, which may be
more casie to the Nation.

Excises have had an ill repute with such as have not thoroughly weighed and
compared them with other Taxes; but, however, it may not be improper to examine
a little into the nature of such a Fond of Revenue, to what degree it would
supply the War, and how far it may be consistent with the safety of our
Constitution.

Of Excises.
EXcises seem the most proper Ways and Means to support the Government in a
long War, because they would lie equally upon the whole, and produce great
Sums, proportionable to the great Wants of the Public.

It appears from the Books of Hearth-Money, that the Families in England are
about Thirteen hundred Thousand; so that, allowing six to a Family, the People
of England may be computed at above seven Millions.

Sir William Petty reckons the Common Mass of Mankind to spend in their
Nourishment, and living of all sorts, one with another, about seven Pound a
Year a-piece; by which computation, there seems Yearly to be spent in England
about Forty nine Millions; of which, Land and Rents in London, according to
what they pay in the present Aids, appear not to be above Ten Millions; and
Trade may be now esteemed at six Millions; The other Thirty three Millions are
spent from Sciences, Arts, Labor, Industry, Manufacture, Retailing of Foreign
Goods, and Buying and Selling our Home Commodities.

Now in Taxing the people, we have hitherto gone chiefly upon Land, and Foreign
Trade, which are about one third part of the strength of England; and the other
two thirds of its strength we let escape. So that Usurers, Lawyers, Tradesmen,
and Retailers, with all that Troop that maintain themselves by our Vice and
Luxury, and who make the easiest and most certain gain and profit in the
Commonwealth, contribute little to its support; all which, by Excises, would be
brought to bear their proportion of the Common Burden.

Of the Thirteen hundred thousand Houses that are in England, it appears, from
the Books of Hearth-Money, that Five hundred thousand are Cottages of one
Chimney. Suppose most of these to be poor Families, and that they contribute
little to any Tax, yet if the other Eight hundred thousand Families paid in
several Excises but six pound a Year, one with another, the whole amount would
be 4,800,000 l. per Annum; which shows what great Sums Excises are capable of
producing.

But the disproportion, between what the Rich and what the Poor consume, would
make this fall easily upon the Poor, and not very heavily upon the Richer sort.

The Duties upon Beer and Ale, are an Instance of the value of Excises, which
at 2 s. 6 d. per Barrel upon Strong, and 6 d. per Barrel upon Small-Beer, and
16 d. per Gallon upon Brandy, produced, in the Year ending 24 June 1689, clear
of all Charges, 738,696 l. And, if one Branch of our Consumption would yield
such a Sum, what would an Excise produce, laid upon several other Commodities
and Manufactures, Charging the things of Luxury high, and the Necessaries of
Life but at a low rate?

That kind of Revenue must needs be very great, where so large a part of the
people are every Minute paying something toward it; and very easy, where
every one, in a manner, Taxes himself, making Consumption according to his will
or ability.

Venice and Holland, two Jealous Commonwealths, have not thought Excises
dangerous to Liberty. They are the strength and support of our Neighboring
Monarchies, especially France; And if we are to contend with that King, the
Combat will be with very unequal Weapons, if we must make use only of
Land-Taxes and Customs, against his Excises, and all his other ways of raising
Money.

But it may be objected, That no Excise can be laid, but the Price of the
Commodity will rise, which will hurt our Manufactures, hinder Consumption, and
so prejudice the Landlords and Farmers of England.

But that objection would be quite removed by a good Law of Assize; without
which, any new Excises may indeed be of evil consequence.

The Laws of Assize were made to increase Consumption, and give the Common
people the benefit of Plenty: As the price of Corn falls, the weight of Bread
should increase; and if this were strictly looked after, it would much augment
Consumption among the Common people, who are the great Consumers of our Home
Commodities; and who would consume more, if they might have more for the same
Money. But this is no where regarded, but a little within the City of London.

By this Laws not being put in Execution, Consumption does not increase as
Plenty increases; neither the Farmer, nor the Common People, are the better for
abundance; And the benefit of Plenty, in a manner, wholly accrues to Bakers,
Corn-Chandlers, and Corn-Brokers, who make immoderate Gains by not raising and
lowering their Prices truly, according to the common Rate of the Market, which,
by Law, they are bound to do.

As for Example, if an Excise were laid upon Wheat and Rye, and, at the same
time, the Laws of Assize were revived, and enforced with higher Penalties; the
Excise would not be so much felt by the Farmer, because he would find
Consumption increase; nor by the common People, because they would have more
Bread for the same Money; so that, in effect, the Excise would be answered to
the King out of the Immoderate and Unlawful Gain made by the Baker,
Corn-Chandler, and Corn-Broker.

So, if an Excise were laid upon Oats, Pease and Beans, and an Assize of the
said Commodities were made to force the Innkeepers and Corn-Chandlers to
regulate their Prices, in a reasonable manner, by the Market Price, the
Consumption would be greater, and the Farmer thereby recompensed, and the
King's Duty in effect would be paid out of the immoderate Gain made by the
Innkeeper, and Corn-Chandler.

So if an Excise were laid upon Flesh, Candles, and Leather, and at the same
time Provision were made by Law to regulate the Market of Smithfield, and other
Markets, all Cattle would sell so much better; that the Farmer would not so
much feel the Excise, which would in effect be paid out of the excessive
Profits made by the Butcher, in retailing his Flesh, and selling his Tallow and
Hides.

It Is strange Economy in our Government, that Plenty should make things a
greater Drug to the first Seller, and very little cheaper to the Buyer; but so
it is in Fact; and this proceeds from the want of a good Law of Assize, and
from the Fraud and Corruption of those who retail these Commodities; such as
Bakers, Inkeepers, and Butchers. And since there is a necessity of Money, can
any Tax be more reasonable, than such a one as would intercept and bring to the
King, some part of that excessive Gain, which these People make upon the
Public?

And this will hold in almost all Commodities that are the proper Subjects of
an Excise.

Therefore if ever new Excises are thought upon, it will be necessary, at the
same time to renew the Laws of Assize now in force, and to prepare a new Bill
of Assize, with higher Penalties, and better accommodated to present use; in
which the Justices of Peace may be strictly enjoined to settle the Assize every
Month, in their respective Divisions, at their Monthly Meetings.

The same Law may regulate the Markets of Smithfield, in which, it is said,
there are Practices very hurtful to the Landed Men of England.

It Is complained the Butchers of London keep great quantities of rich feeding
Ground in their Hands near the Town, and are all Engrossers of Cattle; and when
Beasts are brought hither for Sale, they drive theirs up to glut the Market,
and by this Combination, command the Price, and set it at their own pleasure;
and so make Flesh dear in the Retail, when Cattle sell for nothing in the
Market.

The Remedy for this Evil can be best found out, and applied by the Country
Gentlemen that sit in Parliment.

The same Law may also regulate Weights and Measures, in which, it is said,
there are great Coruptions throughout the whole Kingdom.

It should be the Care of all Governments to save and protect the Poor, as much
as possible, from the Frauds and Combinations of the Richer sort; and if this
were sufficiently provided for, by good and wholesome Laws, well executed, all
the Necessaries of Life would be thereby rendered so much cheaper to the Poor,
that they might pay Excises, and yet enjoy more Ease and Plenty than they do at
present.

The proper Commodities to lay Excises upon, are those, which serve merely to
Luxury; because that way the Poor would be least affected.

But things of that nature are of little bulk, easily hid, vended by a number
of different Traders, and require many Officers to inspect the Making, Selling,
and Retailing of them.

In Holland they easily gather the Duty upon things of Luxury, where the People
are shut up within a narrow compass, and where the Execution of the Laws is
strict and steady; but it would be otherwise in England, where the People are
dispersed about in a large Country, and where they have been long used to a
slack and unsteady Execution of the Laws. Besides, in Holland, the Laws that
secure such Excises to the Government, are more strict and penal than our
Constitution will bear.

And yet a Duty upon all the Vanities and Luxuries of this Kingdom may be
collected, by a far less number of Officers, and with less Difficulty, than is
commonly imagined.

The Commodities with us, proper to charge Excises upon, are such as are Bulky,
and not easily hid or conveyed away, and where as few Traders as possible may
be pestered and vexed with the Search and Inspection on of the Officers, and
where the revenue may be sufficiently secured to the King by mild and gentle
Laws.

Excises may be so contrived and laid, as to answer a Sum perhaps large enough
for the Wants of the Government, without subjecting any private Families, which
are not Dealers, to the Officers Search and Inspection, or without charging any
private Person for such Commodities as are of his own Growth or Making.

There may a Sum large enough arise, only from a Duty upon such things as are
sold, made, or retailed in Market Towns and great Cities, to be paid only by
the Seller, Maker, or Retailer.

And the Duties will be with much less Clamor gathered, where the Business lies
only between Officers and public Dealers, than where it is between the King's
Officers and private Persons.

It Is true, that a Duty upon Malt cannot be conveniently laid, or would yield
little, without subjecting private Persons to the Inspection of the Officer;
but, in regard Malt-houses are in Out Yards, the Inconvenience and Trouble
would be the less.

And such a Sum as is wanted may be levied, and the things of Luxury reached,
for the yearly Charge of about 100,000 l. and by about Fourteen hundred
Officers; casting England into Eight hundred Districts, as it is laid out for
inspecting the Victuallers in the Duty upon Beer and Ale; the remaining Six
hundred are sufficient to take an account of such Goods as are made, sold, and
retail'd in great Towns and Cities.

And this is undeniably apparent to any one that is skilled in the Manner of
Collecting Excises, and versed in the Nature of such Revenues.

Nor is this a number of Officers that can be reasonably thought dangerous to
our Liberties, or able to influence Elections in the Country, especially as
they may be restrained by Law from intermedling in such Matters, and because
the Officers made use of for the Collecting such Revenues, are generally taken
out from the Lees of the People, and are Persons without Interest or Authority.

The Excise on Beer and Ale has given such Knowledge and Light into Revenues of
that kind, and has chalked out so plain a way of dividing the Kingdom equally
among the Officers, and instructed so many Persons how to survey the several
Makers, Sellers, and Retailers, and to obviate Frauds, that Excises will now be
sooner understood, more easily collected, and with fewer Officers than is
commonly apprehended by such as have not thought maturely upon this Subject.

And the Books of Hearth-Money, and the late Poles, have likewise given us such
an Insight into the number of the People, and the Abilities of the respective
Families, that it would not be difficult to make some Computation, what the
Excise upon any Commodity would produce; Political Arithmetic being a good
Guide in these Matters; though it gives not demonstrative Proofs: So that the
Parliament would not be quite in the Dark in laying any Impositions of that
nature.

As for Example, from the Excise of London, a Computation may be made, what a
Duty of 3 d. per Bushel upon all the Malt of England would produce, in this
manner.

There was brewed in London, the Year, ending the 24th of June 1689, 1,212,550
Barrels of strong Beer and Ale, and 827,544 Barrels of Small Beer, so, of both
sorts of Drink, there was brewed 2,040,094 Barrels. To the Strong Beer and Ale,
there is allowed three Bushels to the Barrel, and to the Small one Bushel; but
much Small Beer being brewed after the Strong, it may be a reasonable Medium to
allow to both Drinks, one with another, two Bushels to the Barrel; at which
Rate, to reckon by round Numbers, there is used in London 4,000,000 of Bushels
of Malt.

The People of England, by the nearest Computations that can be made, are
reckoned Seven Millions; of which London is accounted a Tenth Part; so that
there may be in London 700,000 People, divide the 4,000,000 by 700,000, and
there will be found to each Man 5 Bushels 7 Tenths of Bushel. But the Allowance
of two Bushels to the Barrel being rather of the least, we may reasonably allow
to each Man's Consumption six Bushels of Malt in a Year, which would be
4,200,000 Bushels, that is, about three Barrels a Year, which to the Mass of
the People blended together, will be about a Quart a day.

So that if London, which is a Tenth part of the Peopl, consume 4,200,000
Bushels of Malt, the whole Kingdom, which are seven Millions, may consume
42,000,000 Bushels, which, at 3 d. per Bushel, would produce 525,000 l. per
Annum.

Where the use of any Commodity is pernicious to the Interest of the Nation, or
prejudicial to the Health of the People, such an Excise may be there laid, as
may amount to a Prohibition of the Commodity.

Particularly, such Foreign Commodities may be highly charged, the Importation
of which hinders the setting our own Poor to work.

And here it may not be amiss to take notice, that if the Duty upon Brandy and
Spirits was so high, as to amount to a Prohibition of them, their Want in the
King's Revenue would be recompensed to him in his Customs upon Wine, and Excise
upon other Liquors, which undoubtedly they hinder.

How Brandy obtains among the common People, may be collected from this, That
for a long while the Importation of it has every year increased considerably;
so that in the Year 1689, there was as much imported as the Excise of it at 16
d. per Gallon amounted to about 140,000 l. besides the Strong Waters made at
Home. And if, as Physcians say, it extinguishes natural Heat and Apetite, it
hinders the Consumption of Flesh and Corn in a degree. It Is a growing Vice
among the common People, and may, in time, prevail as much as Opium with the
Turks, to which many attribute the Scarcity of People in the East. There is no
way to suppress the use of it so certain, as to lay such a high Duty, as it may
be worth no Man's while to make it, but for Medicine.

Excises may be made the Engine to pull down or repress several Luxuries, of
which our Laws could yet never get the better.

And suppose these Duties should make many Commodities so much the dearer, as
to lessen their Consumption, if thereby Luxury in general could be kept down,
and the Nation driven more to Thrift, it would perhaps, tend greatly to our
public Wealth; and that Notion, if truly examined, will probably be found
false, that Riot and Expense, in private Persons, is advantageous to the
Public.

Unless the Nation does unanimously and freely give into Excises, upon a full
Conviction that they are the best Ways and Means of Supplying the Government,
it will not be the Interest of any King to desire such a Revenue. For if they
are carried but by a small Majority, against the Sense and Grain of a
considerable part of the House of Commons, they will come so crampt in the Act
of Parliament, and loaded with so many Difficulties, that they will only
occasion great Clamors in the Kingdom, and not yield much Money.

Whenever Revenues of that Nature are set on foot, all possible ways must be
used, that humane Wisdom can think of; to give, in other Matters, Safety, Ease,
Wealth, and Prosperity to the Nation.

But; as the Foundation of all, it must be made apparent, by every step, that
the Liberties of the People are the chiefest View, and greatest Care of the
Government; for nothing else can encourage them to trust the Court, in a Matter
that appears so nice and new, as a Home Excise.

All things must be done that may effectually increase the Value of Rents, and
Price of Land, which will add true Strength to the Nation.

All Laws that would tend to the Relief of the Poor, and setting them to work,
would make Excises, and indeed all other Taxes, easier to the Kingdom.

The Poor-Rate, as has been said before, in the latter end of King Charles the
Second's Reign, came to about 665,362 l. And we have reason to think it is now
much higher, because of the great Decay in our Foreign Trade, and Home
Manufacture. Besides which Sum, there is yearly given a vast deal to their
Relief in voluntary Charity and Contributions; so, that in time of Peace, we
pay near as much to the Poor, as to the Maintenance of the Government, and for
our Protection.

But, as this Money is managed in most Places, instead of relieving such as are
truly poor and Impotent, (which the Laws design) it serves only to nourish and
continue Vice and Sloth in the Nation.

If public Workhouses were set up in every Town and County, and if the Works
and Manufactures, proper for ever Place and Country, were fixed and established
in it, the Poor would be encouraged, and invited to Labor and Industry;
especially if the Magistrate made use of his coercive Power upon such as are
Vicious and Idle.

The real and true Objects of Charity would cost the Nation but little to
maintain; and it is to be doubted they have the least Share in the public
Reliefs.

The Wisdom of a Parliament may, in time, find out a way to make such Persons
useful and profitable to the Nation, who, at present, are a heavy Burden upon
it.

If all the Hands in this Kingdom that are able, were employed in useful
Labor, our Manufactures would so increase, that the Commonwealth would be
thereby greatly enriched, and the Poor, instead of being a Charge, would be a
Benefit to the Kingdom.

If the Poor were always certain of Work, and Pay for it, they would be glad to
quit that Nastiness which attends a begging and lazy Life.

And if the Poor were encouraged, and, where there is occasion, compelled to
maintain themselves; the Pound Rate would be much less in every County; and if
the Nation were a little eased of that Burden, we should be in some degree,
abler to support the Expense of the War, and Land would be eased, upon which
the Poor-Rate is a certain Charge.

Nothing would better enable us to pay Excises, and all other Taxes, than a
public Registry, a General Liberty of Conscience, and indeed all Laws that
would effectually invite People over to us, and increase our Numbers.

People are the real Strength and Riches of a Country; we see how Impotent
Spain is for want of Inhabitants, with their Mines of Gold and Silver, and the
best Ports and Soil in the World; and we see how powerful their Numbers make
the United Provinces, with bad Harbors, and the worst Climate upon Earth. It Is
perhaps better that a People should want Country, than that a Country should
want People. Where there are but few Inhabitants, and a large Territory, there
is nothing but Sloth and Poverty; but when great Numbers are confined to a
narrow Compass of Ground, Necessity puts them upon Invention, Frugality and
Industry; which, in a Nation, are always recompensed with Power and and Riches.

And this happened to the Phoenicians, who were the old Inhabitants of Canaan,
and elbowed out by the Hebrews, and driven into a small Slip of Land on the Sea
Coast; who, to nourish their great Multitudes, were forced upon Trade, and so
became the first Navigators and Merchants in the World that we read of and in
time grew a most wealthy and powerful Nation.

Spain resisted the Romans near 200 Years, merely by their Country being then
so populous; for Cicero, reckoning the Strength of several Nations, says, that
of Spain consisted in its Numbers.

No Country can be truly accounted great and powerful by the Extent of its
Territory, or Fertility of its Climate, but by the Multitude of its
Inhabitants; and rich Soils not well peopled, have been ever a Prey to all
Invaders.

Where Countries are thinly Inhabited, the People always grow Proud, Poor, Lazy
and Effeminate; Qualities, which never fail to prepare a Nation for Foreign
Subjection.

All Men who have made any Computations of that kind, seem convinced, England
would naturally bear, and nourish, a full third part more of Inhabitants; so
that, if it ^ere fully Peopled, the value of all Land and Rents would as
certainly rise, as Land and Rents set better near a Populous City than at a
distance from it.

There are many Laws which would invite over to us that Complement of
Inhabitants which our Country seems to want; and though we should get at first
only the Poorer sort, yet those Mouths would consume our Home Product, and
those Hands would help us in our Wars; and in Peace, by their Labor, over-pay
the Nation for their keeping.

But a Public Registry, and a General Liberty of Conscience, would bring among
us from abroad the very Species of Money, real and intrinsic Wealth,
Substantial Men, and all sort of Manufactures.

Some People are afraid that Foreigners may take the Bread from the Common
People, whom Strangers, by reason of their Industry and spare Living, are able
to under-work and under-sell; And that Foreigners may have, in time, strength
enough to awe the Natives. And others believe, That Tolerating all Religions
may be hurtful to the Church. But these Opinions proceed from a narrowness of
Mind, not becoming Religious and Wise Men.

For God can Protect his own Cause in the middle of a thousand Errors, and
variety of Heresies will but give our Churchmen a more ample Field of showing
their Learning and Piety.

The same Protection, and the same Laws, will give Foreigners the same
Interest, with the Natives, and in time, probably, the same Religion.

And the Industrious Frugality of Foreign Handycrafts-Men, will be a good
Correction to the Sloth and Luxury of our own Common People.

At a time when Tyranny is so much the fashion round about us, if our Arms were
open to receive all the afflicted and oppressed part of Mankind, the Goodness
of our Climate, Mildness of our Laws, and the Excellence of our Constitution,
would invite over to us such multitudes, as would exceedingly add to our Power
and Strength, and make us more a Balance to the greatness of France.

And with these Additions of Strength, Excises would be less felt by any part
of the Kingdom.

But there are many real Lovers of their Country, and Jealous of its Liberties,
who object against Excises, and say, They will be so easy and little felt,
that the Ministers, some time or other, may be tempted, if such a Revenue were
once afoot, to get it settled into a perpetuity, or for a long term, and so
make Parliaments useless.

They say, Land-Taxes, Polls, and Customs, lie so heavy upon the Men of
Interest and Figure in the Nation, that by such kind of Impositions, the
Gentlemen of England will never enable a King to live without a Parliament.

But Excises being an easy way of Contributing, insensibly paid, and falling
chiefly upon the common sort, they apprehend our Representatives may, some time
or other, by the Arts and Power of the Court, be prevailed upon to let them
pass into a lasting Supply to the Crown; and they think so large a Revenue
would make the Prince absolutely Independent of his People, which would quite
destroy our Constitution.

It Is true, some of our former Princes have had designs to Enslave this
Country, partly led into those Measures by the Gentries Flattery, and
Corruption of their Manners, who have been all along willing enough to Traffic
the peoples Rights.

However, the Nation was never yet so depraved, but there was a Party strong
enough in the House of Commons to preserve the being of Parliaments, which
would cease if they should make the Crown rich enough to subsist without them.

This Party will ever, with jealous Eyes, watch the motions of the Court; some,
perhaps, only to bring their Abilities and Repute with the People to the better
Market; others, to wreak their Discontents, and some out of mere Love to their
Country; though it may be feared, the Public has but few Friends that are so
truly upon the score of Virtue and Honesty.

These will always be ready to make a stand in the House of Commons, in case,
hereafter, the Ministers should have any designs to make Kings Independent on
Parliaments.

But in the present posture of Affairs, and in a long prospect of the future,
it is not probable any thing will be Enterprised upon Liberty: For there are
those, on the other side the Water, that would sufficiently improve, to their
advantage, any false steps that should be made of that nature; and, while our
fears of France and Popery continue, the side that is for keeping the
Government within its ancient limits, will have always sufficient strength and
credit in the Nation.

No King, with Despotick Power and an Army, could Levy a third part of that
Money in this Country, which is now paid in a quiet and legal manner.

If our Kingdom had been under Arbitrary Power, when we broke with France, in
all probability the Conquest of us had not been the Work of two Campagnes; For
nothing but Liberty, our Interest in the Laws, and Property, could have made us
willing to endure such a heavy War, and able to bear its Expense.

The Rights and Liberties of a Free People, are chiefly what we have to oppose
against the Numbers, Wealth, Economy, and Military Skill of France.

So that there seems the less reason to fear any breach upon our Constitution,
because it is as much the Interest of the Prince, as our own, to preserve it.

Nor can a great Tax of any kind be laid, which will fall so easy upon the
People, as that the entire Body of the Nation will not find it self concerned
to throw it off in Parliament, as soon as that Necessity ceases which first
brought it on.

All Taxes whatsoever, are in their last resort a Charge upon Land; and though
Excises will affect Land in no degree like Taxes that Charge it directly, yet
Excises will always lie so heavily upon the Landed Men, as to make them
concerned in Parliament, to continue such Duties no longer than the Necessity
of the War continues.

Besides, when it is said Excises are easy, it is in respect of other Taxes, and
in regard they Charge every individual Man more equally than other Impositions:
For all Ways and Means whatsoever, that raise great Sums, and drein the Country
of Money, are, and ever will be, thought burdensome to the whole.

And though the Dangers which threaten from Abroad, have made us willing to
raise such great Sums, as for these late Years have been Levied in England, yet
all Men know, that in Times of Peace, they are far above the Value, Wealth and
Power of this Country, and cannot be continued, nor under any head whatsoever
paid a long space, without depriving the People of that Stock which should
carry on their Labor, Trade, and Manufacture, and consequently, introducing
Universal Poverty.

So that there seems little reason to fear the Gentlemen in Parliament can ever
be prevailed upon to make Excises a standing Revenue.

There are other Taxes, that probably, in their consequence, may prove more
dangerous to Liberty than Excises.

The Rights of the People are safe so long as we preserve Parliaments; and
while that Post is secure, and well guarded, we are out of danger; our felicity
being such, That we cannot be undone, but by our selves, and by our own consent.

Those Kings who have designed the subverting of our Laws, by force and open
War, as King John, Harry the Third, Edward and Richard the 2d, could never
prevail; on the contrary, their attempts did end in procuring to the Nation
more ample Charters of Freedom.

But those Princes have been more likely, and nearer to compass their ends, who
have had the Art to undermine our Privileges by corrupting Parliaments.

And nothing can sooner dispose the Gentry to that Corruption, and put them
more in the power of the Court, than such heavy Taxes as will make them uneasy
in their Fortunes.

And the Subversion of most free Governments that we read of, has happened when
the Gentry has been Ambitious, and overwhelmed with Debts, and pressed with too
great Necessities.

If these hight Land-Taxes, are long continued in a Country so little given to
Thrift as ours, the Landed Men must inevitably be driven into the Hands of
Scriveners, Citizens, and Usurers, except some few of the most wary Families.

And in such a case, the Country Gentlemen would still preserve the Interest of
being chosen into the Parliament for a time, because they would hold their
Estates till they are evicted out of them by Law, or forced to sell to their
Creditors, who, indeed, are the true Owners.

Now can there in the World, be a circumstance more dangerous to the Liberty of
a Nation, than to have the real Right, Interest, and Property of Land, in one
Hand, and the Power of being chosen into Parliament in another?

To preserve the Rights of this Nation, we should be Represented by such as
have the greatest share in Property.

And yet if these high Land-Taxes should last any considerable time, the real
Property of Land will belong to the Bankers and Usurers, and we shall be in a
great measure Represented by such as have only the name and show of Estates.

And it is left to the Consideration of any Impartial Man, whither such a
Parliament would not be entirely in the Power, and at the Devotion of the
Court: And whither Liberty would not be thereby more endangered, than by making
Excises a Fond of Revenue for this War.

When the People grow once so degenerate, as to surrender the Rights of the
Nation, there is no ward against such Corruption; and a Parliament that would
consent to continue Excises, beyond the necessities of the War, would give up
Magna Charta, or settle the present Land-Taxes into a perpetuity upon the
Crown. But it is hoped there are not hands enough in this Country, to help a few
Flatterers in the pulling down the Fences of our Liberties, and to promote a
design that would as well ruin the King as his People.

If an Honorable and Safe Peace be so much in our Power as some Men imagine,
there will be no occasion of new Ways and Means of supplying the Government.

But if we are so jealous of our Trade, and Maratime Interest, as to desire the
War may be continued, till the Naval Power of France be a little humbled and
broken, then it will import us to think on the Ways and Means proper for the
carrying on a business of difficulty and length.

Upon the whole matter, it would be much for the Honor and Safety of England,
if we could bring it about, to answer the Years Expense, with the Revenue that
shall arise within the Year; and not to live upon Anticipations, which eat us
out with Interest-Money, and run the Nation into a long Debt.

All reasonable Men must grant, that if the Government could be otherways
supplied, it were expedient to let Land breath a little, in order to give the
Country Gentlemen opportunity to repair the breaches which are lately made in
their Fortunes.

And in all likelihood, Excises might maintain the whole War, if they can be so
settled, as the giving of them may not hazard the Constitution.

But if Excises are thought dangerous to Liberty, there seems good reason to
believe, that an Aid of (...)ound upon Land, and Money, joined with a Quarterly
Poll, and all justly and fairly Levied through the whole Kingdom, would near
supply the present Necessities.

If Aristides, Cimon, and Themistocles, or any of the Ancient Worthies, could
rise from the Dead, they would be astonished at our proceedings, and wonder to
see a Nation, that fights for the Cause of Liberty, Tax themselves partially,
and not with due proportion.

'Twas not by such Measures, in their Public Assemblies, that the Grecians so
long withstood the Persian Monarchy, but by observing, among themselves, mutual
Justice and Equality, each Man submitting his private Interest and Concerns to
the Common Good of his Country; which, it is evident, they did in the whole
course of their Affairs.

FINIS.
