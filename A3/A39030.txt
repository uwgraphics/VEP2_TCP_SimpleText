An excellent Song, called, The Shooe-makers travel.
To the tune of, Flying Fame.


AS I through England traveled,
in Towns of greatest fame,
To hear and see, and view, and learn
the fashions of the same:
I see the shifts of every Shire,
the Trades of every Town.
I viewed the steps of old and young,
for most part up and down.
I see all sorts of men are bent
to get they care not how,
I see that Conscience goesh in rags,
no man regards it now.
I see that Love and Charity
long since were pressed away,
I see that Envy, Wrath and Pride,
are suffered still to stay.
I see, in stead of dealing true,
Defraud and Guile do grow,
I see Oppression, Rape and Wrong,
the Realm does overflow.
I see how fained flattery
obtaines the largest F^es,
I see how truth is tossed about,
and tumbled on his knees.
I see how cruel Covetousness
accepted is of all,
I see, to Christ's poor members true,
Devotion is but small:
I see how lustful Lechery
is loved in every Town,
I see that chaste Uirginitie
goes in a threadbare Gown.
I see Excess his paunch does fill,
with dainty dishes thick,
When Lazarus can nothing have,
except the Dogs him lick:
I see unfruitful idleness,
how much it does abound,
I see not one of Sodomes sins,
but here it may be found.
I saw again such doleful sights,
in England as I went,
Which well I know will breed our woe,
except we do repent.
I see some Learned in great fault,
who Livings have at large,
I see they care not for those souls,
whereof they have the charge.
I see among the Merchant men,
such grievous sins to reign,
Whose ventures ^ar upon the Seas,
do bring them mickle gain.
I see some Lawyers live at ease,
like Foxes in their holes,
I see they might but poor men prove,
if England were not fools.
I see how greedy Usurers,
likewise do flourish so,
Who for a gain, will take the pain
to beggar friend or foe.
The widow and the fatherless,
I see them wel-nigh starved,
I see where need does most requir^,
shall last of all be served.
The Second Part, to the same tune.


I See since Satan sent his Starch
to beautify our necks,
Good houses are in Hatches locked,
are poor are sed with che^ks.
I see each man is for himself,
and God I trust for all,
I see unless we do repent,
great plagues will us befall.
I see such sundry sorts of sin,
in every place to be,
That England may right well be called
the Shop of Uanitie.
I see the sacred Sabbath day,
how much it is abused
With Plays and past^mes every way,
all goodness quite refused.
I see the lovers of Gods Word
in number grow so small,
That if the world should long remain,
we shall see none at all:
I see Christ's words will prove most true,
which want does grieve my mind,
That when to judgment he does come,
he little faith shall find.
We shall see then he will not weep
for us, as for the Jews;
No, no, let us never look for that,
he comes with other news.
But let us then persuaded be,
lest we repent in haste,
To drink of that most dreadful woe,
which Bethsaida did taste.
Or like as Sodom, which for sin
was thrown down to the ground.
Whose ^^arefull end might make us quail,
that now in sin abound.
And thus my faithful friends farewell,
with grief I have you ^old,
What heinous sins throughout the world
I see in young and old.
Now un^o God with humble heart
I wish all Christians pray,
These Weeds of Uice may wasted be,
before that dreadful day.
And let all loving Subjects true,
which have my travel seen,
Lift up their voice and say with me,
God save our King and Queen.
FINIS.
