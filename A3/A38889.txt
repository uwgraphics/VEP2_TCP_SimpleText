Inn. This Charter House at the Suppression of Abbeys had 642 Pound per Ann. a
vast sum in those days: And this Demolished place came afterward into the hands
and possession of Thomas Earl of Suffolk, Lord Treasurer of England, in King
James the I. his Reign, Now in regard the House was sweetly Situated with
Walks, Gardens, and other Conveniences, it gave occasion to Thomas Sutton of
Castle-Camps in Cambridge-shier Esquire; though Born at Knayeh in Lincolnshire, to
alter his design of Erecting an Hospital at Hallingbury in Essex, and purchased
this of the Earl abovesaid, for the Sum of 13000 l. one penny, paid down before

other large Revenues and Possessions; The Work was finished, and called the

Free School, Usher, Eighty poor decayed Gentlemen, and forty Scholars: And

The Academies Universities and Colleges of England, Scotland and Ireland.
THey are called Academies from a shady Grove of Academus a Noble Athenian,
about a Mile from Athens, where Plato and Zenocrates, and other Philosophers
retired for the Study of the Sciences of Later Times. They have been styled
Universities a Professione Vniversalium Scientiarum and artium Liberalium.

1 Of these* there are two famous, Oxford and Cambridge. Oxford, ques Ousford,
Isidis radum, the name of the Chief River whereod it is Seated, or perhaps from
Bovis vadum, a foard for Oxen, as Thracius Bosthoms is by the Germans termed
Ochenfort. It was much Augmented by Alfred the Saxon King* though not Founded
by him, in the year 880.

2 Cambridge, so named from a Bridge built over the River Came, Anciently
