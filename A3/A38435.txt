ENGLAND'S Second Happiness Upon the PROCLAMATION of King JAMES the SECOND, A
SONG
To the Tune of -- When May in all her Youthful Dress, etc.
I.
GReat Charles has left the Imperial Crown
In Peace and Plenty long did Reign,
His Proud Domestic Foes kept down;
Forced Foreign Princes to obey,
And left Great James possessed with Power
And Strength; to make the World Proclaim
Him King and Caesar every hour;
Let James, let James for ever Reign.
II.
Through the four Corners of the World,
His Mighty Soul has raised His Name;
In Showers of Praise from the Heavens hurled,
As well in Flanders, France* and Spain:
The rouling Seas did Calm their Waves,
And Neptune did support the Keel,
Of The Royal Sovereign through, The Slaves
Of The Hogines with Blood, Fire and Steel*
III.
In The Head of the the English Horse James,
With private Soldiers kep'd his Post,
Defying Death and all Extremes;
He beat the Dutch and cleared the Coast:
And ever was a Soldiers Friend,
Against Rigid Rage of Rumps Decrees,
Who did an Army once disband,
No fear I hope, of Rumps like these.
IV.
False Chitophel, his Plot did Frame,
Two Royal Brothers to de-Throne,
To Exterpate the Sacred Name
Of Stuarts, which all Christian own
To be the undoubted Sovereign King,
Of these three Nations and the Seas;
Whose Praise the Angels daily sing,
And Curse on those that disobeys.
V.
Great JAMES of resolution strong,
Never failed to maintain the Right
By Sea or Land, amongst the Throng;
As great in Conduct as in Fight,
Yet more Obedient to his Prince,
Than Loyalist of meanest Race;
At his command for no offense,
Thrice left his Home the State to please.
VI.
Nay more than Mortal in a Prince,
And Heir Apparent to the Crown:
His Brothers Life for to advance,
His own he freely would lay down:
Let All, adore so great a King,
That never desired Imperial Throne;
But what the Gods enforce and bring,
He Scorns to loose what is his own.

Newport-House in Leicester-fields, 1685
