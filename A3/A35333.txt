The Cuckolds Dream. OR, The Comical Vision.
Where in a slumber, Fancy does impart,
Strange whimseys which disturbs his jealous heart;
Such delusions, Dreams do represent,
To make him think his Wife is evilly bent:
That when he is awake, he makes a pother,
And swears there is none that is honest, not his Mother.
To the Tune of, Your humble Servant Madam.




When Flora with rich Tapestry
The earth had all be-spangled,
And Buds and Blosoms on each Tree,
Most pleasantly they dangled;
I walked to hear the Cuckoo sing
For further observation.
And sat down by a silver Spring,
All for my recreation.
As I lay slumbring on the Plain,
All in that pleasant Season,
Strange F^ncies did possess my brain,
Which did disturb my Reason;
Whilst Morpheus with his Leaden Mace,
My senses were intransing,
Methought I saw within that place
Wonders about me dancing.
Brave Troops of Gallants ^s;t along
And Ladies of fine Feature:
I could not tell within the throng
Which was the comliest Creature;
With costly Robes of rich array
They seemed to be attired,
Like Venus on her wedding day,
When Mars her pomp admired.
Amongst the rest, a Spark I spied
Which here shall not be named,
And in his hand a lovely Bride
As ever Nature framed.
They were so trim in ever limb,
It much did please my fancy,
I joy'd to find, they were so kind,
Not thinking it was Nancy.
But having viewed them narrowly,
I found unto my sorrow,
This Youngster he did well agree
To live upon the borrow.
Since Dreams are Fables as we say,
I Will tell you on my life sir,
The party that was there that day
Was my own married wife sir.
O then thought I, if you be there
I Will watch your water casting,
And still they seemed to draw near,
Not fearing Sparrow blasting.
He did her kiss, and called her Miss,
He was both sprite and valiant,
And kindly she, said none but he
Should ever be her Gallant.
Methought I heard him call a Coach,
and servants to attend her,
Upon my right he did incroach,
So much he did befriend her,
Qouth he, this day, we will see a Play
At the Theater Royal.
Then up and go, it shall be so,
I must have no denial.
With that I strugl'd in my sleep,
As thinking to prevent them,
Mean time away they slily creep,
I could not discontent them.
Thought I, I Will have you by and by,
when you return at leisure.
And if I can conveniently
I Will fit you for your pleasure.
Methought I saw them both come back,
As plain as I Would been waking.
And then he had her to the Sack
Which set my heart of aching;
With costly wines, they cheerd their hearts
And thought it was but reason
Of every thing to share their parts
That e're was then in season.
No sooner was the Banquet done,
And that they had said Grace sir,
And none but they were left alone,
He kindly did embrace her.
He gave her Rings which she liked well,
And Bracelets made of Amber,
But when his spirits 'gan to swell,
Then hey for a private Chamber.
I could no longer then endure,
My forces I did muster,
And thought that I had slept secure,
Yet when I wak't I cursed her.
No more I Would hear the Cuckoo sing,
Her note shall not inchaunt me,
Nor sleep by any purling Spring
Where Hobgoblins do taunt me.
Then homeward I did haste amain
In hopes to have some kissing,
But when that I came there again
I found my wife was missing,
Which put me into such a fret,
I feared my Dream was true sir,
Therefore my sorrows to forg^^
I now shall bid adieu sir.
F^NIS.
