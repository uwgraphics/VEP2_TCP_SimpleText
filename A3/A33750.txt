The History of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
CHAP. 1.
. 1.
THE Allmighty, to display his Glorious Name, Genesis 1. 1. 3, 7, 11, 14, 20,
24, 26.

Within six days both Heaven and Earth did frame:
Whatever shone, grew, swam, slew, crept [or ran;]
And (in his holy image) lastly Man.
For man the rest he made; but did intend,
Man's Maker should be made Man's chiefest end.
With Him did Man converse (true Angels food; 1 Cor. 10. 31. Ps. 73. 25, 26
Genesis 2. 16, etc. Eccles. 7. 29. Genesis 3 4. 5, 6, 24.

Had Man this happiness but understood!)
But being tempted unto cursed ambition,
He was deprived of that blessed condition.
All Mankind in his public person fell,
And so were heirs of sin, of death and hell. Romans 5. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

Hopes (yet) of life did Mercy soon restore,
By this free Promise of a Savior,
The Woman's seed shall bruise the Serpents head* Genesis 3. 15. Gall. 4. 4. Genesis
12. 3. and 21. 12. and 22. 18. 49. 10. Joh. 9. 7. ^^. 89. 4. Is. 11. 1* and 7.
14. Mic. 5. 2. Dan. 9. 24. Mal. 4. 5.

Where his Humanity may first be read.
To Abraham his Nation was expressed,
In thee (said He) shall all the Earth be blessed.
By Jacob then Jehova did describe
Shiloh (his Son) sent out of Judahs Tribe.
King David knew the House. Isaiah said,
The Person bearing Him shall be a Maid.
Micah the Place; Dan'el the Time; and so,
Malachi His Forerunner did foreknow.
2.
His, whose Original is so sublime; Joh. 1 1

Existing e're there was a point of time:
The second Person in the Trinity, Joh. 1 2

And styled the Word of God so frequently.
The same almighty word, that gave the birth Joh. 1 3

To every thing in Heaven and in Earth.
The life and light of men; that always shone, Joh. 1 4

In Types and Prophesies, to every one.
So stupid yet were most, they could not see; Joh. 1 5

Till John was sent to tell them, This is He. Joh. 1 6

Yet, when they might so easily have known him, Joh. 1 7

The world, which he had made, did still disown him. Joh. 1 8

Coming to's own, his own did not receive him; Joh. 1 9

Preaching to's own, his own did not believe him. Joh. 1 10

But they that did receive him, they became Joh. 1 11

The Sons of God, through faith upon his Name, Joh. 1 12

Which faith and sonship do not flow from Nature, Joh. 1 13

But from the grace of our Regeneratour.
This Word made flesh showed us his glor'ous face, Joh. 1 14

As the only son of God, most full of Grace. Mal. 4. 2. Dan. 9. 21, etc. 2
Kings 11. 7 Numb. 6. 3.

3.
And when this sun of Righteousness drew near,
Just then did John (his morning star) appear. Luke 1 5

For when the Scepter was from Judah gone,
To Herod (called the great) of Askalon; Luke 1 6

That Angel seen of Dan'el, was dismissed
(Again) to Zachary an holy Priest. Luke 1 7

'Twas then (as God disposed the lot) his turn,
That week to make the Temple incense burn. Luke 1 8

The Angel by the Altar did appear, Luke 1 9

On its right side; and filled the man with fear. Luke 1 10

Fear not (said He, perceiving him afraid) Luke 1 11

Thou have no reason to be so dismayed: Luke 1 12

Thy prayer is heard; and when thy course is done, Luke 1 13

Thy wife shall then conceive, and bear a Son.
His name is John: at his mirac'lous birth Luke 1 14

Shall thou (and many more) be filled with mirth. Jad. 13. 7. Mal 4 6.

Great shall he be in great Jehovahs sight, Luke 1 15

Abstem'ous also (like a Nazarite.)
And from the very womb shall he inherit
The gifts and graces of the holy Spirit.
And (in the power and spirit of Elias) Luke 1 16

He shall turn many from their sinful bias, Luke 1 17

Preparing Israel for their Messiah
But how shall I know this? quoth Zacharias. Luke 1 18

We Are a decrepid pair: beside, my wife
No child did ever bear in all her life.
I Am Gabriel (quoth the Angel) and am sent, Luke 1 19

To bring these tidings through the firmament.
And for a sign take this, Thou shall be dumb, Luke 1 20

Until the time prefixed is fully come.
So Gabriel returned to heaven again: Numb. 6. 23

And dumb did he accordingly remain.
The people which had been at prayer without, Luke 1 21

[Expecting now his blessing,] were in doubt,
Wherefore he staid so long: at last his hand Luke 1 22

Signified to them how the case did stand.
So (when his week was finished) home he went. Is. 4. 1. 1 Samuel 1. 6. 11.
Luke 1 23

His wife conceived: but (till 'twas evident)
She kept her very private; and did bless Luke 1 24

That God which had removed her barrenness. Luke 1 25

4.
In her sixth month was Gabr'el caused to slay Luke 1 26

To Nazareth (a Town in Galilee)
To visit Mary, that was then a spouse Luke 1 27

Betr^th'd to Joseph (both of David's house:)
Whom he salutes in these (or such like) words, Luke 1 28

All hail thou signal favorite of the Lords
Blessed art thou, thrice blessed in my mind,
Blessed art thou above all women kind.
Fear no^ (said he, seeing paleness in her face) Luke 1 29

With God thou have obtained abundant grace. Luke 1 30

Thou shall conceive and bear; and when it is done, Luke 1 31

Impose the name of Jesus on thy Son.
Great Son of God most high! to him alone
The Lord shall give his Father David's throne; Luke 1 32

His Israel to govern and defend: Luke 1 33

And of his Kingdom there shall be no end.
But how shall these things be (then Mary said) Luke 1 34

For hitherto (thou know) I am a maid?
All things are possible with God (said he) Luke 1 35

The Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee.
And hence it is, I called that Holy thing
The Son of God, the everlasting King. Luke 1 36

Thy Cozen El'zabeth (too) has conceived
In her old age [if I may be believed:]
She Is clear of shame; this very month's the sixth, Luke 1 37

With her whose name had Barren once prefixed.
See then (said she) the handmaid of the Lord: Luke 1 38

Be it to me according to thy word.
5.
Some few days after, Mary went to see
Her Cozen El'zabeth and Zachary. Luke 1 39

So soon (then) as her Cozen heard her voice, Luke 1 40

She (and the babe within her) did rejoice.
Among all women blessed be thou (said she) Luke 1 41

Blessed be thy Offspring to eternity. Luke 1 42

The Mother of my Lord give me a visit!
How great, how sweet a condescension is it? Luke 1 43

For lo, so soon as ever thou were come,
For joy the infant sprang within my womb. Luke 1 44

Blessed is she that did believe the Lord;
She shall have due performance of his word. Luke 1 45

Then the same spirit Mary did possess, 1. Sam. 2. 1-10.
Luke 1 46

Who thus declared her joy and thankfulness.
I magnify the Lord in heart and voice: Luke 1 47

My spirit in my Sav'our does rejoice.
To me so low, his love is so expressed, Luke 1 48

That (far and nigh) they 'll say that I am blessed.
The mighty one has magnifyed me; Luke 1 49

And holy is his name eternally.
His mercy is on them that fear him still, Luke 1 50

But scatters the proud against their will.
He has debased the mighty men (we see) Luke 1 51

And has exalted them of low degree. Luke 1 52

Poor hungry souls he richly fills with store, Luke 1 53

The rich he sends away both pale and poor.
Now has he helped Jacob from above, Luke 1 54

Now has he called to mind his ant'ent love
According to his promise heretofore Luke 1 55

To Abram and his seed for evermore.
6.
So (three months after that) went Mary home: Luke 1 56

And when her Cozens time was fully come, Luke 1 57

She bare a son. Her neighbors and her kin Luke 1 58

Came to congratulate her lying in.
They circumsiz'd him (when the eighth day came) Luke 1 59

And would have given him his Fathers name.
But El'sabeth refused to have it done, Luke 1 60

And told them that he must be called John.
Why so? (they all replied) we do not know Luke 1 61

One person of thy kindred called so.
So they made signs to's Father Zachary, Luke 1 62

To know what he would have his name to be.
And beckning for a book to write upon, Luke 1 63

He wrote the Angels words, His name is John. Luke 1 64

Then was his tongue unti'd: then in the Spirit Luke 1 67

Thus he praised Him that praises does inherit.
All praise to him that over all does dwell, Luke 1 68

That has redeemed his people Israel; Luke 1 69

And of his servant David's house has raised
Salvation for our souls: his Name be praised.
His Name be praised, that spoke by every Prophet, Luke 1 70

(And lets us see the due fulfilling of it)
That we should be delivered from the will Luke 1 71

And power of all those that wish us ill. Genesis 22. 16.

Now to perform that solemn oath he swore Luke 1 72

Unto our Father Abraham before:
That being freed from all our foes, we might Luke 1 73

Walk uprightly for ever in his sight,
Thou art the Prophet of that King most high; Luke 1 74

Thou (Child) shall go before his Majesty; Luke 1 75

His way before his face shall thou prepare; Luke 1 76

Salvation to his Saints shall thou declare: Luke 1 77

Thou shall declare their trespasses forgiven,
Through tender mercy from the God of Heaven; Luke 1 78

Whereby on those that fear his name he brings Luke 1 79

That rising Sun with healing in his wings.
Their souls from deaths black shadow to release,
And guide our footsteps in the way of peace.
This wonder quickly spread in every part; Luke 1 65

Fear and amazement seizing every heart. Luke 1 66

And John did thrive, and in the desert dwell, Luke 1 68

Until his showing unto Israel.
7.
The Virgin Mary now with child appears; Mat. 1 18

And thereupon good Joseph's filled with fears.
Yet (loath to expose her unto public scoff)
Intended privately to put her off.
But while he studi'd how to bring't about, Mat. 1 19

An Angel came and thus resolved his doubt:
Fear nothing Joseph; Mary take to wife; Mat. 1 20

For she has led an undefiled life.
These harder thoughts the Maiden does not merit:
What she goes with, is of the Holy Spirit.
A son it is, whom Jesus thou shall call: Mat. 1 21

For from their sins he'^ save his people all.
(This does more notably fulfill that word Mat. 1 22

Spoke by the Gospel-prophet of the Lord; Is. 7. 14.

God and a Virgins son with us shall dwell, Mat. 1 23

And they shall call his name Emmanuel.)
Joseph obeyed: but still she was a Maid,
Till of her firstborn she was safely laid. Mat. 1 24

8.
But just before her sacred load did ease her, Mat. 1 25
Luke 2 1

A law was published by Augustus Caesar,
That all the Roman world should be enrol'd:
(Cyreaius then did Syr'as rudder hold.) Luke 2 2

All Towns enrol those that belong to them:
And this made Joseph go to Bethlehem 1 Samuel 16. 1.
Luke 2 3
Luke 2 4

(The place of David's birth and private life;)
There to be taxed with his espoused wife. Luke 2 5

9.
And now the glorious day begins to dawn; Luke 2 6

Now is the curtain of thick darkness drawn.
Now does the Lord of all things condescend
To take up in a stable, and be penned Luke 2 7

Within a dirty manger: now thou 'rt blessed
(Ignotant Inn) with this illustr'ous Guest,
And now the souls great Pastor is reveald Luke 2 8

From heaven to shepherds watching in the field.
The glory of an Angel did surround them: Luke 2 9

The glory was so great, it did confound them.
Fear not (said he, perceiving them afraid) Luke 2 10

Fear not at all, be not at all dismayed.
It Is joyful tidings, that I come to bring: Luke 2 11

This day is born your Sav'our and your King.
In Bethlehem you will find it, as I said, Luke 2 12

The Babe's wrapped up and in a manger laid.
And hardly had the Angel made an end, Luke 2 13

But there whole Quires of Angels did attend;
That King with hallelujahs to adore,
That sits on the throne for evermore.
Glory to God on high, peace on the Earth, Luke 2 14

Good will to men; they s^ng with holy mirth.
Then ^an the shepherds to the Town, and saw Luke 2 15

Mary and Joseph and the Babe in straw. Luke 2 16

They filled the Town with fame; and their relation Luke 2 17

Filled all that heard the same, with admiration. Luke 2 18

But Mary pondr'd all things in her heart: Luke 2 19

And they, with joy and praise to God, depart. Luke 2 20

10.
Now we behold the Son of Man; and gather
His natural lineage thus to Marys Father:
First Adam, Seth, and Enos, after whom Luke 3 38

Cainan, Maleleel, and Jared come.
Enoch the just, Methuselah the aged, Luke 3 37

Lamoch, and Noah (when the waters raged.)
Then Shem, and Arphaxad, with Sala next Genesis 11. 12 1 Chronicles. 1. 24.
Luke 3 36

(For Cainan is not in the Hebrew text.)
Heber, and Peleg, Father to Ragau:
With Serug, Nahor, Terah. Whence we draw Luke 3 35

Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, unto whom Mat. 1 1

Judah was born; then Phar^h and Esrom. Mat. 1 2
Luke 3 34

Aram, Aminadab, and Naasson,
Father to Salmab (alias Salmon.) Luke 3 33
Mat. 1 3

Then Boaz, Obed, J^sse, David (Heaven Mat. 1 4
Luke 3 32

Ordained King this youngest son of seven.) Mat. 1 5

Nathan, and Mattatha, Menan: to him Mat. 1 6
Luke 3 31

Succeed Melea, and Eliakim.
Then Jonan, Joseph, Jude, whose consort bore him Luke 3 30

His Simeon: then Levi, Matthat, Jorim.
He preceeds Eliezar, Jose, Er; he Luke 3 29

Elmodam, Cosam, Addi, Melchi, Neri: Luke 3 28

He Salathiel; he Pedaiabs son Luke 3 27

Zorobabel; he Rhesa, and he John.
The next are Judah, Joseph, Semei, Luke 3 26

Mattatha, Maath, Nagge, and Esli:
So Nahum, Amos, Mattathias, Joseph, Luke 3 25

John, Melchi, Levi, Matthat, Heli, Joseph, Luke 3 24

Joseph ('it is said,) for custom here forbad 'em Luke 3 23

To name the Mother of this second Adam.
This King, by whom lost Israel is saved: 1 Chronicles. 3. 10. -- 19.
Mat. 1 7

Whose royal race we thus may trace from David.
Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abia. Mat. 1 8

Asa, Jehos'phat, Joram, [Ahaziah,
Jehoash, Amaziah,] Azariah,
Joa^ham, Ahaz, pious Hezekiah, Mat. 1 9

Ma^asses, Amon, young and good Josiah, Mat. 1 10

Jehojakim, and captive Jechoniah, Mat. 1 11

Then Salathiel: and his Brothers son Mat. 1 12

Zerubbabel (when second house begun.) Mat. 1 13

His heir's Abiud: then Esiakim,
Then Azor, Sado^, Achim after him Mat. 1 14

Eliud, Eleazar; and Matthan, Lev 12. 3. -- 8.
Mat. 1 15

Jacob, and Joseph, and the Son of Man, Mat. 1 16

Whom at the time prefixed they circumcised, Luke 2 21

Naming him Jesus, as they were advised.
11.
Some five weeks after that, his parents went Luke 2 22

Up to the City, that they might present
This firstborn Son of theirs before the Lord Luke 2 23

[And ransom him] according to his Word.
The Mother [having little worldly pelf] Exodus 13. 2, 15.

Offered a pair of pig'ons for her self.
[Had she been able, it had been a Lamb:
And therefore 'twas before the Ma^i cam'.]
Now while they were at Church, there came to them Luke 2 25

Old upright Sim'on of Jerusalem.
(Who by the spirit had been certifi'd Luke 2 26

Of seeing Gods Anointed, e're he died.)
Filled with the Holy Ghost he came in have, Luke 2 27

And in his arms that Holy Child embraced. Luke 2 28

Now let thy servant Lord (said he) decease Luke 2 29

(According to thy holy word) in peace.
For I have seen the thing I waited for, Luke 2 30

Now I have seen the worlds great Savior: Luke 2 31

A light to Gentiles that in darkness dwell, Luke 2 32

The glory of thy people Israel.
This Child is set (said he to Jesus's Mother) Luke 2 33

For some men's fall, and for the rise of other: Luke 2 34

And for a contradicted sign; to show, Luke 2 35

Whose hearts are faithful, and whose are not so.
Yea, and a sword shall penetrate thy side
[When thou behold'st thy Dearest crucified.] Luke 2 36

Also one An^e (a widow-prophetess)
Whose years were eighty four (or little less) Luke 2 37

Who daily to the Temple did repair
And served God with abstinence and prayer,
She thither (at that very instant) came, Luke 2 38

To render praise and glory to his Name;
Affirming Jesus to be Christ, to them
That waited for him in Jerusalem. Luke 2 39

And having done whatever the Law required,
To Bethlehem [directly] they retired:
[And there continued, till an Angel warned them
To flee to Egypt (as indeed concerned them.]
12
Mean while, arrived from the Eastern parts Mat. 2 1

Astronomer^ well read in Persian arts,
Enquiring at Jerusalem for one Mat. 2 2

Born among them to sit upon the throne.
Seeing (said they) the Star of your great King,
We came to worship [with an offering.]
Then Herod (with the chiefest of the Jews)
Was startled at this strange and sudden news. Mat. 2 3

And having asked the Hebrew Doctors, where
Messiah should be born; 'twas made appear, Mat. 2 4

Bethlehem was the place: from Bethlehem Mat. 2 5

Micah sends forth this Ruler over them. Mic. 5. 2.
Mat. 2 5
Mat. 2 6

Then Herod, after private conference Mat. 2 7

About the Stars appearing, sent 'em thence:
Desiring them to search and find him out, Mat. 2 8

Then to return, and tell him whereabout.
For I (said this equivocating elfe)
Intend to reverence the King my self.
So out they went, and (e're they had gone far) Mat. 2 9

To their content, they saw the former star. Mat. 2 10

By which they were conducted all the way,
Till they arrived just where Jesus lay. Mat. 2 11

Then unto this great Prophet, Priest and King,
Myrh, Frankincense, and Gold's their offering.
And warned of God to slight the Tyrant, they Mat. 2 12

Returned home again another way.
13.
He seeing he was mocked in desperate fury Mat. 2 13

Resolved the death of every child in Jury.
But the all-piercing eye this secret views,
And unto Joseph quickly sends the news.
Up (said the Angel) take the Child and's Mother;
This place will prove too hot, go seek another.
Herod has horrid thoughts, his blood is stirred:
God well in Egypt, till I bring you word. Hos. 11. 1.

Joseph obeyed, and there he staid, till thence Mat. 2 14

God called his Son, [as he had done long since.] Mat. 2 15

From Bethlehem they were no sooner gone, Mat. 2 16

But there was heard great lamentation.
Herod had sent (in this his angry mood)
His Executioneis, to spill the blood
Of two years age and under; as he heard
The Wisemen say, what time the star appeared.
Ra^hel might well lament, as was of old Jer. 31. 15.
Mat. 2 17

In The prophecy of Jeremy foretold. Mat. 2 18

14.
But Herod shortly dies; and Joseph then Mat. 2 19

Was called by the Angel back again. Mat. 2 20

Yet hearing Archelaus did command, Mat. 2 21

Fear of Judea kept him at a stand: Mat. 2 22

Till warned again, to Nazareth he came; Mat. 2 23
Luke 2 39

Whence Nazarene was added to the Name. Zech. 6. 12.

There the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit; Luke 2 40

Wisdom and Grace he fully did inherit.
15.
His Parents at the City did appear, Luke 2 41

To keep the Paschal customs every year.
They therefore going as they used to do, Luke 2 42

Jesus (at twelve year old) went thither too.
But He (when they returned) had a mind
(Without acquainting them) to stay behind. Luke 2 43

They (in the first days journey) thought they might
Be sure to have him with their friends at night. Luke 2 44

But having searched, and found him not with them, Luke 2 45

They went (the morrow) to Jerusalem:
And (next day after) in the Temple found him. Luke 2 46

Disputing there with all the Doctors round him.
And all that heard him, were astony'd greatly; Luke 2 47

No youth (said they) spoke ever so discreetly.
His Parents were amazed, to find him there; Luke 2 48

And told him how solicitous they were:
Why, Son (said Mary) have thou served us thus?
Our missing thee has sore perplexed us.
Why so? (said he:) is this unknown to you, Luke 2 49

How that my Fathers business I must do?
They understood him not; but in her heart Luke 2 50

Mary kept every jot: So they depart.
To Nazareth along with them he went, Luke 2 51

To them he showed himself obedient.
His lovely and his innocent behav'our Luke 2 52

Procured him both Divine and humane favor.

NOw in Tiberius his fifteenth year Mat. 3 1
Mar. 1 1
Luke 3 1

When Pont'us Pilate did Judea steer,
The rest of Can'an having Antipas,
His Brother Philip and Lysanias; Is. 40. 3. 2 King. 1. 8. Lev. 11. 22. 1 Samuel
14. 43.

And when the Church affairs depended on Luke 3 2

Caiphas and Annas, then appeared John Mat. 3 2
Mar. 1 2
Luke 3 3

Sent from the Lord; Which Esaias thus foretells, Mat. 3 3
Mar. 1 3
Luke 3 4

The voice of one that in the desert dwells, Luke 3 5

Behold your Sav'our all! the valleys fill, Luke 3 6

Make plain the ways, and level every hill.
John wore a leathern girdle (to denote Mat. 3 4
Mar. 1 6

Elias's habit) on his hairy coat.
His meat was Locusts, and such other cheer,
As Jonathan was like to buy full dear.
Repent (said he) and wash away your sins, Mar. 1 4

[Believe in Christ, whose Kingdom now begins.]
2.
Some came from all those parts about (according Mat. 3 5
Mar. 1 5

To John's command) and were baptized in Jordan. Mat. 3 6

Then asked he some that went for saints, By whom Mat. 3 7

Have you been warned to flee the wrath to come? Luke 3 7

Viperous race, repent; and bear such fruit, Mat. 3 8
Luke 3 8

As may henceforth with true repentance suit.
It Is nothing worth, to say, we are Abrams Sons; Mat. 3 9

For God can raise him Children up of stones.
And now the ax is laid against the root Mat. 3 10
Luke 3 9

Of every tree that bears not good fruit.
And when they asked him, what they ought to do, Luke 3 10

To shun the wrath to come? he answered so;
All you, to whom the Lord has given store, Luke 3 11

Lend to the Lord, by giving to the poor.
Ye Publicans, forbear to pill and poll; Luke 3 12

Exact no more than your appointed toll. Luke 3 13

Rest ye contented (Sould'ers) with your pay: Luke 3 14

Wrong none in word or deed or any way. Luke 3 18

With many other things that did relate
To every man's particular estate.
So that they mused much, and did not know Luke 3 15

Whether he were himself the Christ or no.
Thus he resolved them, I baptize with water Mar. 3 11
Mar. 1 7

But your Messiah is a coming after;
Far before me in all respects, his shoes
I do n't deserve the honor to unloose.
I am a Baptist; He Is a great deal higher: Mar. 1 8

He shall baptize you with a Ghostly fire.
His fan is in his hand, he will purge his floor, Mar. 3 12
Luke 3 17

Consume the chaff, and keep the wheat in store.
3.
Nor was it long e're Jesus (though above him, Mar. 3 13
Mar. 1 9
Luke 3 21

Yet) thither came ^o be baptized of him.
How Is this (said John) that thou art come to me? Mar. 3 14

I have more need to be baptized of Thee.
Jesus replied, let me have now my will; Mar. 3 15

That so all right'ousness we may fulfill.
John therefore yielded to his Lords request;
And Jesus unto prayer himself addressed. Mar. 3 16
Mar. 1 10

Upon him then descended (from above)
The Holy Ghost in fashion of a Dove.
This voice proceeding from the Lord most high, Mar. 1 11

Thou art the Son of my Complacency. Mar. 3 17

Then John bare witness, saying, this is He, Joh. 1 15

That was before and comes after me.
From whom (as from a fountain) does proceed Joh. 1 16

All sort of Grace, whereof we stand in need.
For though the Law was first by Moses given, Joh. 1 17

Yet grace and truth came down with him from heaven.
No man has seen the Father but the Son, Joh. 1 18

He has revealed him; and both are One.
Now look what years were wont to be computed, 2 Samuel 5 4. Gen 41 46. (...).
Luke 3 23

Before the Priests their office executed;
Look when the Lord set David on a throne;
And at what age the Patriarch was grown
So much in favor in King Pharoahs sight;
So old was now Jehovahs Favorite.
4.
And as he shunned the scandal thus of Novice;
So (towered the further fitting him for's Office)
Into the wilderness the spirit drove him, Mar. 4 1
Mar. 1 12
Luke 4 1

By fasting and temptation there to prove him.
And having fasted forty nights and days; Mar. 4 2
Mar. 1 13
Luke 4 2

The Tempter then assaulteth him, and says,
Thou art an hungry now; Gods only Son Deuteronomy. 8. 3.

Can make him bread of this or any stone. Mar. 4 3
Luke 4 3

Jesus laid hold upon the spirits sword, Mar. 4 4
Luke 4 4

And thus replied, it is written in the Word,
No man does live by bread alone, but by
His Word that every thing does sanctify.
Then Satan to the Temple-battlements Ps. 91. 11.
Mat. 4 5
Luke 4 9

Conveyed him, saying, Cast thy self from hence, Mat. 4 6

If thou art His, for it is w^^t that He Luke 4 10

Shall give his Angels charge concerning thee:
To bear thee up in their offic'ous arms, Luke 4 11

And keep thee safe from accidental harms. Deuteronomy. 6 16.

Jesus rejoyns, thou shall not tempt the Lord Mat. 4 7
Luke 4 12

[Neglecting means;] This also is his Word.
Then (as his last essay.) the Tempter tries, Luke 4 5

If worldly glory would infect his eyes. Mat. 4 8

Which from a lofty mountain first he shows;
Then tells him thus, I Will certainly dispose Mat. 4 9
Luke 4 6

Of all to thee; do thou but bow the knee Luke 4 7

(Now we are together here) and worship me. Ex. 20. 3. Deuteronomy. 6. 13.

Thou wicked one (said Christ) be gone, for Thou Mat. 4 10
Luke 4 8

('It Is writ) to none but God alone shall bow.
Then Satan (seeing naught would fright or woe him) Mat. 4 11

Left him, and Angels ministered unto him.
5.
While Jesus was among the savage beasts,
John was baptizing still; to whom came Priests Joh. 1 19

Sent from the Council at Jerusalem,
To know on what account he came to them: Joh. 1 20

Whether in quality of their Messiah,
Or whether as his harbinger Elias: Joh. 1 21

Or, if as neither, then they would know why Joh. 1 22

He there baptized with such authority. Is. 40. 3.

I am (said John) the voice of one (the Prophet Joh. 1 23

As you well know, did long ago speak of it) Joh. 1 24

The voice of one in the wilderness, whose word Joh. 1 25

Commands you clear the passage for the Lord.
I do indeed baptize, to make you fit Joh. 1 26

For one amongst you, whom ye know not yet:
He Will soon appear, but greater far than I; Joh. 1 27

His shoes I am not worthy to un^y
This in Bethabara was done. [But by Joh. 1 28

The Syriack and Na^nus Bethany.]
6.
The next day John saw Jesus coming near, Joh. 1 29

And bore this record [which himself might hear]
Behold that Holy Lamb of God (said he)
Who for our sins must sacrificed be.
This same is He, of whom I said before, Joh. 1 30

I am a Baptist* He Is a great deal more.
For I am but of yesterday, but He
As far before me as Eternity.
I knew him not [by sight:] yet knew I well,
That he would soon appear to Israel. Joh. 1 31

The coming down of the Holy Ghost unto him:
Was given as a sign, whereby to know him: Joh. 1 32

Given by Him that sent me to this place,
Thus to prepare his way before his face. Joh. 1 33

I take my record from that Gall-less Dove,
That He Is the Son of Gods eternal Love. Joh. 1 34

7.
The next day John (with two Disciples more)
Was standing, as he was the day before: Joh. 1 35

And seeing Jesus as he passed by,
Bad them behold the Lamb of God most high. Joh. 1 36

They followed Him; and being at his back,
He turned about and said, what is it ye lack? Joh. 1 37

Master (said they) where may thy dwelling be?
Jesus invited them to come and see. Joh. 1 38

They went; and spent the rest of that day there: Joh. 1 39

'Twas more than four a clock [the night drew near.]
One of those two was Andrew, Simons Brother:
(And very probably, St. John the other.) Joh. 1 40

He meeting Simon, straightway up and told him, Joh. 1 41

We Have found the true Messiah; come, behold him.
So both together unto Christ they came; Joh. 1 42

Who knew, and told, and added to his name.
Thou Simon art (said he) the Son of John,
Peter a Rock [for me to build upon.]
8.
Christ (the next day) to Galilee went down, Joh. 1 43

And called Philip of Bethsaida Town. Joh. 1 44

Then Philip meets his friend Nathanael: Joh. 1 45

And gives him an account of what befell.
Can good come out of Nazareth? said he. Joh. 1 46

To be resolved (said Philip) come and see.
When Jesus saw Nathana'l coming towered him, Joh. 1 47

This great Encomium he did afford him;
Behold an Isra'lite indeed (said He) Genesis 25. 27.

Made up of Jacobs plain integrity!
What! known (said he) and never seen before! Joh. 1 48

I can (said Jesus) tell a great deal more:
I saw thee underneath the shady tree,
Before that ever Philip called thee.
Rabbi (said he) I see thou art indeed Joh. 1 49

The King of Israel, the Holy Seed.
Do thou believe (said He) with so such ease?
Thou shall behold far greater things than these. Joh. 1 50

Heaven it self shall open unto me: Joh. 1 51

Angels themselves shall my attendants be.
9.
At Cana (now) there was a wedding feast, Joh. 2 1

At which the Lord vouchsafed to be a guest.
For both Himself and his Disciples were Joh. 2 2

Invited (with his Mother) to be there.
And when she told him of their want of wine, Joh. 2 3

He showed (at first) dislike to her design. Joh. 2 4

She must not think to rule him as a novice;
In what concerned his Deity and Office.
But gathering hope, she bade the servants do, Joh. 2 5

Whatever Jesus should direct them to.
And [when he knew that all their wine was gone,] Joh. 2 6

He bad them fill six water-pots of Stone.
Two or three firkins every vessel held, Joh. 2 7

And to the brim with water they were filled.
Now draw (said he) [not making any waste,] Joh. 2 8

And give the Governor a cup to taste.
He (having tasted) for the Bridegroom sends, Joh. 2 9

And thus in brief his generous wine commends;
Most men at first keep up the worst, but thou Joh. 2 10

(Not like the rest) have kept the best till now.
By this first miracle the Lord began Joh. 2 11

To manifest his being more than man:
And thus confirming his Disciples hearts, Joh. 2 12

To Capernaum (for a time) departs.
CHAP. 3.
. 1.
ANd now the Paschal Festival ensues; De^^. 14. 14* 25, J^^. 7. 1^. I^^. 69 9.
Joh. 2 13

Which He observed, as well as other Jews:
And coming up to Town (with that intent)
D^^ectly to the sacred Temple went Joh. 2 14

Where finding those sold oxen, sheep and doves,
He made a whip, and sent them out in droves. I^ 56. 7.
Joh. 2 15

This house is called (said he) an house of prayer; Joh. 2 16

And will ye turn it to a thievish fair?
(Thus is it writ in David's Prophecy, Joh. 2 17

Zeal for thin^ house has even devoured me.)
The Jews replied, But what is the sign thou show'st? Joh. 2 18

Produce authority for what thou do.
And though the thing it self was sign enough,
Yet he allowed the men this other proof;
Destroy this Temple, and I will it raise, Joh. 2 19

As firm as ever 'twas, within three days.
So soon (said they) will thou this Temple rear, Joh. 2 20

Which has been building six and forty year?
This they thought strange, not knowing his intent; Joh. 2 21

For He the Temple of His Body meant.
Which to his followers appeared plain, Joh. 2 22

When He was raised from the ground again.
Many men now consid'ring how he wrought, Joh. 2 23

Denied not the truth of what he taught.
He did not (yet) himself commit unto them, Joh. 2 24

Because that He did thoroughly see and know them. Joh. 2 25

2.
And others who believed, (for shame or fear)
Were loath to let it openly appear.
Thus Nicodemus came to Christ by night, Joh. 3 1

And was instructed in the Gospel Light.
(This Nicodemus was a Pharisee
Among the Jews of great authority.
Rabbi (said he) these miracles of thine Joh. 3 2

Plainly declare, thy Person is divine.
Heaven confirms thy Doctrine to be true;
Doubtless the way to heaven thou do show.
No man (said Christ) can enter heaven gate, Joh. 3 3

Until he first become regenerate.
Regenerate? (said he) what, born again? Joh. 3 4

Be pleased that difficulty to explain.
No man (said He) that Kingdom can inherit, Joh. 3 5

Till born anew of Water and the Spirit.
That Kingdom cannot flesh and blood contain, Joh. 3 6

Until Spirit'liz'd and born again.
And let not this impossible be thought, Joh. 3 7

Because you see not how the change is wrought.
For as the winds intriques thou never know, Joh. 3 8

So nor the breathings of the holy Ghost.
But how can this (said Nicodemus) be? Joh. 3 9

This doctrine seems exceeding strange to me.
Art thou (said Christ) a Doctor of the Land, Joh. 3 10

And do not thou these matters understand?
All that I speak, I know it to be true; Joh. 3 11

None other can reveal the same to you.
If what I teach in such an Earthly way, Joh. 3 12

Ye cannot reach; what further shall I say?
To teach the way to heaven, thence I cam' Joh. 3 13

Although [as God] in heaven still I am:
Where mortal man did never go, nor can;
And therefore I became the Son of Man. Number. 21. 9.

And being lifted up, I am to die Joh. 3 14

(As Moses's serpent once did typifie)
That mortals stung with sin may look to me; Joh. 3 15

Look and be cured, and live eternally
For God so loved mankind, that he gave them Joh. 3 16

His only Son, by faith in him to save them.
To save them from the Legal curse, which they Joh. 3 17

Lie under still, that still do disobey. Joh. 3 18

Herein their condemnation chiefly lies; Joh. 3 19

Though Light be come; yet still they shut their eyes.
And therefore darkness is so much beloved, Joh. 3 20

Lest in the light their act'ons be reproved.
But he that is consc'ous of no evil done, Joh. 3 21

Fears not the sight of an impart'al Sun.
3.
Jesus went after that to Jary-land, Number. 11. 27, 28, 29.
Joh. 3 22

Baptizing there (with his disciples hand.)
And John baptized in Aenon (which was near Joh. 3 23

To Salim-Town) much water being there. Joh. 3 24

John hereupon began to be despised; Joh. 3 25

Because that Christ with more success baptized,
And greater Majesty. The wrangling Jews Joh. 3 26

Sent John's Disciples to him with the news.
John tells them, every man must be content Joh. 3 27

With whatsoever God Almighty sent.
That I was Christ, ye never heard me say; Joh. 3 28

But sent before him to prepare his way.
He rises, whilst I fall: and I rejoice, Joh. 3 29

Because I hear the Bridegrooms pleasant voice. Joh. 3 30

He Is from above: they that receive him, show Joh. 3 31

Their approbat'on that the Lord is true. Joh. 3 32

For without stint the holy Ghost is given Joh. 3 33

Unto this Sovereign favorite of Heaven. Joh. 3 34

No less than life or death eternal must Joh. 3 35

Depend on men's believing or distrust. Joh. 3 36

4.
Thus John fulfilled his Ministry, and cared Mat. 14 3
Mar. 6 17
Luke 3 18

For no man, and the vice of no man spared:
Spared not the Tetrarch Antipas himself; Mar. 6 18

Who often had (like counterfeiting Elfe)
Not only heard, but put in practice too
Most of the things, the Baptist bad him do.
So near (at last) he touched both him and's wife
Herodias, for their incest'ous life; Mat. 14 4
Mar. 6 19
Luke 3 19

(Saying his Brothers wife should not be his'n)
That for her sake he cast him into pris'n. Mar. 6 20
Luke 3 20

And in his blood his hands he had imbrew'd Mat. 14 5

Just then, but that he feared the multitude.
5.
When Jesus heard this unexpected news, Mat. 4 12
Mar. 1 14
Joh. 4 1

And what offense was taken by the Jews; Joh. 4 2

He went from Jury into Galilee: Joh. 4 3

(Which from the Jewish power was more free.)
And passing through Samaria, he came Joh. 4 4

Near to a Town that Sychar had for name. Genesis 33. 18.
Joh. 4 5

And (being weary) sat upon the Well Joh. 4 6

Formerly dug by wrestling Israel.
Whilst his Disciples to the Town were gone, Joh. 4 7

To buy for him and them provision; Joh. 4 8

A woman thither came for water, whom
The Lord requested for to give him some.
Thou art a Jew (said she) and do you think Joh. 4 9

That we Samaritans must find you drink?
(For since the Kingdom has been rent in twain,
No Jew has dealing with Sanaritain.)
Jesus replied, Did thou but know, my daughter, Joh. 4 10

Who it is that begs a draught of thy cold water;
Spring Water thou 'idst have asked at his hand,
Who freely would have answered thy demand.
The well is deep (said she) and thou have not
Wherewith to draw, nor any water-pot. Joh. 4 11

Art thou above our Father Israel,
Who drank himself, and then gave us the well? Joh. 4 12

This will (said he) but ease your present pain:
He that drinks mine shall never thirst again. Joh. 4 13

That water I bestow, still proves to be
A well of life that springs eternally. Joh. 4 14

Pray give me Sir, (said she) of that same water; Joh. 4 15

That I may never thirst, nor draw herea'ter.
He bad her go, and first her husband call. Joh. 4 16

Her answer was, that she had none at all.
That Is true (said he) for none thou have alive, Joh. 4 17

But in thy time have had no less than five:
And that same man with whom thou live now, Joh. 4 18

Is not thy husband; that thou may avow.
Sir (she replied) I see thou art a Prophet:
Our Fathers held (what is thy opin'on of it?) Joh. 4 19

They held this Garizim was the only hill, Joh. 4 2^

For serving God according to his will.
His will is this (said he) not only here,
Nor at Jerusalem, but every where,
Men should contin'ally put up requests
With holy hands from undefiled breasts.
God is himself a spirit, and will be
Worshipped in Spirit and sincerity. Joh. 4 2^

You (without warrant) serve ye know not what: Joh. 4 22

Salvation is of Us, be sure of that.
I know (said she) when Christ is come, he shall Joh. 4 25

In every needful truth instruct us all.
I am (said He) the true Messiah [whom Joh. 4 26

So long ye have expected for to come.]
Leaving her pitcher then, away she ran, Joh. 4 28

And told the Towns-folks she had found a Man,
Could tell her all she did: I think (said she) Joh. 4 29

No man can be Messiah, if not He.
Now his Disciples (having brought their meat) Joh. 4 27

Desired him (in the interim) to eat. Joh. 4 31

But Jesus told them that he did not want Joh. 4 32

Or meat or drink: though they were ignorant. Joh. 4 33

My Fathers work (said he) is full as good Joh. 4 34

And pleasant, as my necessary food.
Think ye the same of what you are sent about. Joh. 4 35

Others came in to sow, and so went out. Joh. 4 36

You reap the profit of the Prophets pains:
Theirs has the labor been, and yours the gains. Joh. 4 37

Some corn indeed must yet a great while stand: Joh. 4 38

But here is a harvest ready to your hand.
Then came the woman to the well again,
And brought a number of her Countrymen. Joh. 4 30

Two days with them (at their request) he staid,
And was received for what the woman said. Joh. 4 39
Joh. 4 40

Then many more believed, and told the woman, Joh. 4 41

They thought indeed that he was Christ, or no man: Joh. 4 42

Yet not on her account, but for the sake
Of their partic'lar hearing what he spoke.
6.
Thence to other Towns he came (and past his own: Joh. 4 43

For Prophets are most slighted, where most known.) Joh. 4 44

Those Galileans made him welcomest, Joh. 4 45

Which saw his wonders at the Pascal feast.
He now revisits Cana; where at first Joh. 4 46

His water-wine allayed their wedding-thirst.
And when his coming was divulged by fame, Joh. 4 47

A Nobleman from Capernaum came,
Beseeching him to come, and so recover
His Son, that otherwise was given over.
No faith without a miracle? said Jesus. Joh. 4 48

Pray Sir (replied the Courti'r) come and ease us. Joh. 4 49

Well, go (said He) thou shall in health behold him. Joh. 4 50

The man believed, and found it as he told him.
And having asked the time, 'twas so exact; Joh. 4 51

That minute Jesus spoke, the fever slackt. Joh. 4 52

Which miracle was then so well received, Joh. 4 53

That Is family, as well as he, believed. Joh. 4 54

7.
Thus went he up and down, and taught (with fame) Mat. 4 17
Mar. 1 14
Luke 4 14

Repentance and believing on his Name. Mar. 1 15
Luke 4 15

Put even where he had been educated, Luke 4 16

Instead of being honored, he was hated.
For standing up, as with his use agreed,
In The Synagogue (one sabbath day) to read.
He (by the Clerks offic'ous ministry) Luke 4 17

Received Isaiahs Gospel-Prophecy. Is. 16. 1, 2.

And when he had unfolded it, he lights
Upon the place, where thus he found it writ: Luke 4 18

I Am filled with the Spirit of the Lord,
Because I am to speak a joyful word
^o all the poor in spirit, and am sent
With healing balsom to the heart that is rent;
Freedom to preach, to those that fettered be,
And so proclaim the Lords great Jubilee. Luke 4 19

Then he returned the book, sat down; and they Luke 4 20

(With great attent'on) harken'd what he would say.
This day (said he) this scripture plainly 'ppears Luke 4 21

To be fulfilled exactly in your ears.
Much more he spoke, which made them wonder much, Luke 4 22

How Joseph's son should ever come by such.
I know (said he) you look to see done here Luke 4 23

The things that you have known me do elsewhere.
But I am far more undervalu'd here Luke 4 24

(In Power and Person) than I am elsewhere.
And I must tell you, that in Israel 1 Kings 17. 9. 2 Kings 5. 14.
Luke 4 25

Did many poor and hungry widows dwell,
When that great famine all the Kingdom grieved, Luke 4 26

Yet by the Prophet was but one relieved.
So likewise there white lepers were good store, Luke 4 27

When Maaman was cured, and no more.
Then were they ready all to fly in's face, Luke 4 28

And led him forth toward the steepest place
Of all that mount which did support their town, Luke 4 29

And made account to throw him headlong down.
But through them all himself he did conveigh, Luke 4 30

And so to Capernaum went his way.
8.
And there he dwelt and preached contin'ally, Mat. 4 13
Mar. 1 21
Luke 4 31

And that with more than Scribe authority. Mar. 1 22
Luke 4 32

(Thus he fulfilled Isaiahs prophecy 2 Kings 15. 29. Is. 9. 1, 2.
Mat. 4 14

Concerning Zebulon and Naphtali; Mat. 4 15

Once overwhelmed with a gloomy night, Mat. 4 16

Now filled with the glor'ous Gospel Light.)
And in the Church there was a man possessed, Mar. 1 23
Luke 4 33

Who sent this horrid tone from's filthy breast,
Jesus, away! I know thee who thou art, Mar. 1 24
Luke 4 34

Gods holy Son. Increase thou not our smart.
Jesus replied, Come, and hold thy tongue, Mar. 1 25
Luke 4 35

Satan obeyed (and threw the man along.) Mar. 1 26

And hereupon his fame was spread throughout Mar. 1 27
Luke 4 36

The whole amazed country round about. Mar. 1 28
Luke 4 37

How powerful a word is this (said they)
Which these uncleanest Devils thus obey!
9.
He visits Simons Mother next, whose feavor Mat. 8 14
Mar. 1 29
Luke 4 38

(Though violent,) at his command did leave her. Mar. 1 30

For which great cure so freely wrought upon her. Mat. 8 15
Mar. 1 31
Luke 4 39

She rose and served him with thankful honor.
10.
About sunset he cast out many Devils; Mat. 8 16
Mar. 1 32
Luke 4 40

And all that came, he healed of all their evils. Is. 53. 4.
Mar. 1 33

(So true of him Isaiah prophesies, Mat. 8 17
Mar. 1 34

He bore our griefs and our infirmities.)
And though the Devils cried, we know thee well; Luke 4 41

Yet Jesus would not suffer them to tell.
[He would not let such liars bear him witness.
Their trade in lying caused their unfitness.]
11.
Next morning early Jesus went his way Mar. 1 35
Luke 4 42

Into a solitary place to pray.
Peter and others finding him, declare, Mar. 1 36

How earnest after him the people were. Mar. 1 37

My pains (said he) on others must be spent, Mar. 1 38
Luke 4 43

As well as these; for therefore am I sent.
Therefore he went through Galilee and taught, Mat. 4 23
Mar. 1 39
Luke 4 44

Confirming it by wonders which he wrought
On all that came from Syr'a-side oppressed, Mat. 4 24

Lunatic, Paralytick, and possessed.
For men were brought (by so great fame as this) Mat. 4 25

From parts remote, even from Decapolis.
12.
And as he was within a certain City, Mat. 8 2
Mar. 1 40
Luke 5 12

A Leper came and humbly craved his pity.
O Lord (said he) thy power is not mean;
Thou can (if willing) easily make me clean.
Then Jesus (moved with pity towered the man) Mat. 8 3
Mar. 1 41
Luke 5 13

Touched him, and said, I will as well as can:
Be cleansed of thy leprosy (I say.) Mar. 1 42

And straight his leprosy was done away.
Now go (said he) but see thou do not tell Lev. 14. 4.
Mat. 8 4
Mar. 1 43
Luke 5 14

Who cured thee, till the Priest pronounce thee well. Mar. 1 44

Let him receive that offering at thy hand,
As Moses does (in such a case) command.
But yet the man so much the matter blazes, Mar. 1 45
Luke 5 15

That Christ was fain to keep in desert places, Luke 5 16

13.
Till some days after, He returned home: Mar. 2 1

And it was quickly known that He was come.
So that they throng about the house for cure, Mar. 2 2
Luke 5 17

And to receive his words, so sweet, so pure.
Among the rest they bring a palsie-man; Mat. 9 2
Mar. 2 3
Luke 5 18

But cannot come at Christ, do what they can. Mar. 2 4
Luke 5 19

Having at last the roof uncovered,
With cords they let him down upon his bed.
And when He saw their true industr'ous faith, Mat. 9 3
Mar. 2 5
Luke 5 20

Unto the Paralytick man he says;
Thy sin [the source of all infirmity]
Freely and fully is forgiven thee.
Which when the Scribes and Pharisees did hear Mar. 2 6
Luke 5 21

(For diverse of them were assembled there)
Hark how his blasphemy (said they) begins! Mar. 2 7

For who but God alone can pardon sins?
Jesus replied, what means your private talk? Mat. 9 4
Mar. 2 8
Luke 5 22

Is It not as hard to say, Arise and walk? Mat. 9 5
Mar. 2 9
Luke 5 23

Therefore I prove my power thus, and say, Mat. 9 6
Mar. 2 10
Luke 5 24

Take up thy Bed (my son) and go thy way. Mar. 2 11

Then on his legs the man being firmly raised, Mat. 9 7
Mar. 2 12
Luke 5 25

Bore home his bed, and great Jehovah praised.
Which did amazement in the people strike; Mat. 9 8
Luke 5 26

And made them say, they never saw the like.
14.
Another time (He being by the shore) Luke 5 1

The people pressed to hear him more and more.
And entering into Peter's ship, from thence Mat. 4 18
Mar. 1 16
Luke 5 2

His grac'ous words he freely did dispense. Luke 5 3

When he had made an end, he Peter wishes Luke 5 4

To launch out further for a draught of fishes.
We fished (said he) and nothing caught; Luke 5 5

But wished by thee, we'll try another draught.
And so they did; enclosing such a shoal, Luke 5 6

They could not hope to draw the net up whole,
For John and Jameses help they call amain: Luke 5 7

And both the ships could scarce the fish contain.
Then Peter falls at Jesus's feet, and cries, Luke 5 8

Too great art Thou for our vile companies.
(For they were all amazed.) Fear not (said He) Luke 5 9

Thou shall henceforth take living souls for me. Mat. 4 19
Mar. 1 17
Luke 5 10

So he and Andrew came to shore, and quickly Mat. 4 20
Mar. 1 18
Luke 5 11

Left all they had, to follow him [more strictly.]
And as they went along, he called the other, Mat. 4 21
Mar. 1 19

Which aided them, Jacobus and his Brother.
They soon agree: and Z^bedee must mend Mat. 4 22
Mar. 1 20

The net, which they now could not stay to end.
15.
After another sermon on the shore Mar. 2 13
Luke 5 27

(To which resorted Auditors good store)
He called Matthew; who forsaking all Mat. 9 9
Mar. 2 14
Luke 5 28

(Toll and Toll-booth) obeyed his Masters call:
And made him such a feast, that many 'a sinner Mat. 9 10
Mar. 2 15
Luke 5 29

And many publicans were there at dinner.
But this the Pharisees much quarreled at, Mat. 9 11
Mar. 2 16
Luke 5 30

Because with men unsanctifi'd he sat.
These men (said he) do chiefly want Physicians, Hos. 6. 6.
Luke 5 31

Who see their sad and desperate conditions.
But go and learn what means that, I prize
Mercy before the fattest sacrifice.
Self-right'ous men I never came to save,
But those that see what want of me they have. Luke 5 32

But why (say they) do thy Disciples feast, Mat. 9 14
Mar. 1 18
Luke 5 33

When John's and ours fast twice a week at least?
When I am gone (said he) they will fast and weep: Mat. 9 15
Mar. 1 19
Luke 5 34

Like Bridemen now my company they keep. Mar. 1 20
Luke 5 35

And [being newly call'd] they are not fit Mat. 9 16
Mar. 2 21
Luke 5 36

For trials of a rougher nature yet.
In garments weak, strong pieces will not suit; Luke 5 37

Old bottles break, and spill the vines new fruit. Mat. 9 17
Mar. 2 22
Luke 5 38

They that know what the old wine is already, Luke 5 39

Disgust the must, as being harsh and heady.
CHAP. 4.
. 1.
ANd after this, the solemn festival
Was holden at Jerusalem by all. Joh. 5 1

Here there is a Pool (Bethesda is the name) Joh. 5 2

Having five porches built about the same.
These porches for the Creeples were erected, Joh. 5 3

Where they the stirring of the Pool expected.
For at a certain time an Angel came, Joh. 5 4

Whose motion gave such virtue to the same,
That whosoever first was after bathed, was sure
(Whatever he ailed) of present perfect cure.
Now one (among the rest who there did wait) Joh. 5 5

Had had a lameness thirty years and eight.
Christ therefore knowing what he had endured, Joh. 5 6

Demanded of him, if he would be cured.
Sir (said the man) it is indeed my will, Joh. 5 7

But (wanting help) I am prevented still.
Rise, take thy bed (said He) and go thy way. Joh. 5 8

So the man did: and 'twas the sabbath day. Joh. 5 9

Therefore the Jews (observing what he did) Joh. 5 10

Told him that this the Laws of God forbid.
This I wss bid (replied the man) to do, Joh. 5 11

By him that did enable me thereto.
Whose that? said they. Who 'twas, he could not say; Joh. 5 12

For Jesus had conveyed himself away. Joh. 5 13

But in the Temple afterward they met; Joh. 5 14

Now thou art well (said Jesus) do'nt forget
This mercy of the Lord: offend no more,
Lest thou be worse than e're thou wast before.
Then went the man and told the Jews, he found Joh. 5 15

That Jesus was the person made him sound.
With Jesus therefore hotly they contest, Joh. 5 16

For violating of Gods holy Rest. Acts 17. 28.

My God (said he) and Father works still: Joh. 5 17

I also work [according to his will.]
Then did they seek to kill him; and the rather, Joh. 5 18

Because he made the Eternal God his Father.
The Son (said he) does what the Father does: Joh. 5 19

His son he loves; his Son He all things shows. Joh. 5 20

To him he will his wondrous power give; Joh. 5 21

That he shall also cause the dead to live.
Men he must judge: that men to him may show Joh. 5 22

The same respect, as unto God is due. Joh. 5 23

Whosoever believes God, believes me: Joh. 5 24

And he that does, shall live eternally.
They that are dead shall shortly hear my call, Joh. 5 25

Who am (like God) a spring of life to all. Joh. 5 26

And unto me the last discerning fan Phil. 2. 8, 9.
Joh. 5 27

Is given, as I am the Son of man.
My voice (I say) shall open every grave; Joh. 5 28

Some to condemn, and othersome to save: Joh. 5 29

According to the right'ous firm decree Joh. 5 30

Of Him that gives me this authority.
This record of my self is weak (say you.) Joh. 5 31

But John has fully proved it to be true. Joh. 5 32

Whose testimony (yet) I could have waved; Joh. 5 33

But that ye might believe, and so be saved. Joh. 5 34

He was a candle burning very bright, Joh. 5 35

And (for a while) ye loved to see his light.
But I have greater witnesses than John; Joh. 5 36

To wit, the works I have divinely done.
And God himself from heaven witness bore; Joh. 5 37

Whose voice was never heard of you before.
But if my Fathers words had been believed; Joh. 5 38

Whom he has sent, you would have soon received.
Search but the Scriptures, and you will plainly see, Joh. 5 39

That they are they which testify of me;
How that I am that Life-infusing Prophet: Joh. 5 40

But ye refuse to be partakers of it.
It Is not my self I honor, but the Lord, Joh. 5 41

Whom (in rejecting me) ye have abhorred. Joh. 5 42

If a seducer comes, and humors you; Joh. 5 43

Whatever he says, is still accounted true.
But how can ye believe, that seek and love Joh. 5 44

Rather applause from men, than from above?
I Will not accuse you unto God: ye must Joh. 5 45

By Moses's law be judged, wherein ye trust.
Of Me did Moses write; you would Me believe, Joh. 5 46

Did ye but credit unto Moses give.
But if ye do'nt believe what He did write, Joh. 5 47

How can ye Me believe [whom thus ye slight?] Lev. 23. 10-17.

2.
Now on the Sabbath which they call First-second Mat. 12 1
Mar. 2 23
Luke 6 1

(From second Paschal seven such were reckoned)
Jesus's Disciples plucked the ears of Corn:
Which ought (the Jews said) then to be forborne. Mat. 12 2
Mar. 2 24
Luke 6 2

Have ye not read (said Christ) what David did, Mat. 12 3
Mar. 2 25
Luke 6 3

When he and his (being very hard bestead)
Were by Abimeleck admitted guests Ex. 19. 32, 33. 1 Samuel 21. 6.
Mat. 12 4
Mar. 2 26
Luke 6 4

To consecrated shewbread of the Priests?
Why don't ye also of the Priests complain, Mat. 12 5

How by their works the Sabbath they profane?
If, for the Temples use, ye say, they are; Mat. 12 6

I Am greater than the Temple is by far.
But God loves Mercy more than sacrifice: Mat. 12 7

Consider this, and you will be less precise.
This Rest was made for mankinds benefit; Mar. 2 27

And not to lose their health by keeping it.
I am moreover Lord of the Sabbath day; Mat. 12 8
Mar. 2 28
Luke 6 5

[Can temper, change, or take it quite away.]
3.
As Jesus taught another time, there came Mat. 12 9
Mar. 3 1
Luke 6 6

A man, whose withered hand had made him lame.
The Jews then (willing to accuse him) say, Mat. 12 10
Mar. 3 2
Luke 6 7

Is healing lawful on the Sabbath day?
Stand in the midst (said Jesus to the creeple) Mar. 3 3
Luke 6 8

What one of all this superstitious people, Mat. 12 11

That has a sheep new fallen in a pit,
Will not upon this day deliver it?
Man is by far more precious: if we can, Mat. 12 12
Mar. 3 4
Luke 6 9

Can save and will not, we destroy the Man.
What say ye now to this? what is it ye say?
Is healing lawful on the Sabbath day?
Then did he (when they answered not) express Mat. 12 13
Mar. 3 5
Luke 6 10

Anger and grief at their hard-heartedness:
And bad the man stretch forth his withered hand,
Which was restored again at his command.
At this, the Pharisees (with madness filled) Mat. 12 14
Mar. 3 6
Luke 6 11

Straightway consult which way to get him killed.
But Jesus knowing their Herodian hearts, Mat. 12 15
Mar. 3 7

Went towered the Maritime remoter parts.
Yet from all parts the people thither came, Mar. 3 8

When once they heard of his all-healing Name. Mar. 3 9

So that a ship was fain to wait upon him:
So out of measure did the people throng him.
For with a touch he healed all their evils, Mar. 3 10

And with a word cast out the foulest Devils; Mar. 3 11

And charged them not to make him known: hereby Mat. 12 16
Mar. 3 12

Fulfilling of Isaiahs prophecy,
My chosen and beloved servant shows Is. 42. 1.
Mat. 12 1^

Judgment as well to Gentiles as to Jews.
He shall not make a puther or a noise, Mat. 12 19

Nor in the streets shall any hear his voice.
He shall not break the reed already cleft; Mat. 12 20

Nor quench the flax, where spark of hope is left;
Till he complete his Gospel-Right' ousness:
Till Gentiles this Victorious Judge confess. Mat. 12 21

4.
About this time the Lord abode in prayer Mar. 3 13
Luke 6 12

All night upon a mountain, to prepare
His Ordination. When the Sun drew near, Mar. 3 14

He summons his Disciples to appear:
Whence he so many for Apostles marks, Luke 6 13

As the ancient Jewish Church had Patriarks:
To be his near attendants, and disperse
Th^se joyful tidings through the universe.
Ease to restore to those that were dis-eas'd,, Mar. 3 15

And to recover whom the Devil seized.
Peter and Andrew, James and John (two pairs) Mat. 10 2
Mar. 3 16
Luke 6 14

And these two last he called Thunderers; Mar. 3 17

Then Philip, Thomas, and Bartholomew, Mat. 10 3
Mar. 3 18
Luke 6 15

Levi (the Exciseman) alias Matthew,
Alph^us's Son Jac^bus was another,
And Judas (called Thaddeus) Jamcses Brother,
Si^o^ the Canani^^ (or else Zelotes,) Mat. 10 4
Mar. 3 19
Luke 6 16

Lip-holy Judas (called Iscariotes)
Whose thievery and avarice (in the end)
To's Master made him prove a traitorous fiend.
With these the Lord descended to the plain, Luke 6 17

Where met him all the multitude again: Luke 6 18

And they that were diseased, or were possessed, Luke 6 19

All of them had their grievances redrest.
Then into the house he went; but had no leisure Mar. 3 20

To eat or drink: they thronged so out of measure.
And some went forth to stop the multitude: Mar. 3 21

For this (they said) was boisterous and rude.
5.
Seeing them come so thick, on that account Mat. 5 1
Luke 6 20

He went and preached this Sermon in the Mount.
(To his Disciples chiefly 'twas addressed, Mat. 5 2

Though many things concerned all the rest.)
Blessed are they that are in spirit poor: Mat. 5 3

Heaven shall them enrich for evermore.
Blessed are they that weep and mourn aright: Mat. 5 4

They shall be comforted with joy and light.
Blessed are the meek, that all the world enjoy; Mat. 5 5

[Whose inward peace no creature can annoy.]
Blessed (then) are Mourners, Meek, and Poor in Spirit?
Who Comfort, Earth, and Heaven must inherit.
Blessed are the hungry and the thirsty Souls: Mat. 5 6

God shall their table spread, and fill their bowls.
Blessed are those are mercifully given: Mat. 5 7

Mercy again shall they obtain from Heaven.
Blessed are the pure in heart, who God shall see. Mat. 5 8

Blessed are the peaceful, Heavens Progeny. Mat. 5 9

Blessed are those that are my sufferers: Mat. 5 10

For the Celestial Kingdom shall be theirs, Mat. 5 11

Glory in wrongs; for your reward is Glory: Mat. 5 12

Ye know they used the Prophets so before y^.
Ye are as salt; which, when the Savour's gone, Mat. 5 13

Is good for naught, and therefore trampled on.
Ye represent a City built on high; Mat. 5 14

Which (while it is) is obvious to the eye.
Ye are as lights: which men use so to set, Mat. 5 15

That all the house may thence have benefit.
So let your works shine forth, that men may gather Mat. 5 16

Thence, that ye have a true Celestial Father.
Whose Law t'abolish never think I came; Mat. 5 17

I came to 'stablish and enlarge the same.
For Heaven and Earth shall sooner pass away, Mat. 5 18
Luke 16 17

Than e're one moral tittle shall decay.
Whosoever the least commandment violates Mat. 5 19

(Repenting not) never enters Heaven-gates.
For if ye do no more than what is done Mat. 5 20

By factious Scribes and Pharisees y' are gone.
Murder (say they) to judgment must be brought, Mat. 5 21

And so shall every rash and angry thought. Mat. 5 22

Which breaking out in vile opprobrious names,
Shall have a greater doom and hotter flames.
Offer not therefore any sacrifice, Mat. 5 23

Until you have reconciled your enemies. Mat. 5 24

And this do quickly, e're the Judgement's past; Mat. 5 25
Luke 12 58

Before you are in horrid prison cast. Luke 12 59

From whence ye cannot at liberty be set, Mat. 5 26

Until y' have paid the utmost of the debt.
'Twas said of old, All whoredom thou shall flee: Mat. 5 27

I say a wanton thought's adultery. Mat. 5 28

If thy right eye or hand offend thee thus, Mat. 5 29

Condemn both them and all thy darling lusts. Mat. 5 30

Come rather lame, and sing in Heavens Quire;
Than always flame, and howl in Hell entire. Mat. 5 30

Again, the Scribes transgress the ancient laws,
Suffering divorce for any trivial cause. Mat. 5 31
Mat. 5 32
Luke 16 18

Except it be for fornication; she,
And he that weds her, act adultery.
They also say, Let swearers pay their vow:
But I no [idle] swearing can allow; Mat. 5 33

By Heaven or Earth, or by Jerusalem: Mat. 5 34

For God alone has power over them. Mat. 5 35

Nor by thy head; until thou can turn gray,
Or (at thy pleasure) turn thy age away. Mat. 5 36

Barely affirm, or barely else deny,
In vulgar term, No, Nay, Yes, Yea or Y. Mat. 5 37

The law permits you to retaliate
[Yet not without the Public Magistrate.] Mat. 5 38

Be Ye (if any buffet you), so meek,
As (rather than revenge) turn the other cheek. Mat. 5 39

If law's pretended, and thy coat be gone; Mat. 5 40

Two wrongs endure, before thou render one.
And if compelled (by Messengers of State) Mat. 5 41

To go a journey, be not obstinate.
Give, to thy power: and whosoever would borrow. Mat. 5 42

When lend thou can, delay not till the morrow.
Ye know what has been said [by Pharisees;]
Thy Neighbor love, and hate thine Enemies. Mat. 5 43

But I say Love, and Bless, and pray for those Mat. 5 44

That Hate you, Curse you, Are your bloody foes.
For thus your Fathers rain and Sun give food, Mat. 5 45

As well to wicked persons as to good.
If ye salute and love your loving Brothers, Mat. 5 46

What do ye more than Publicans and others? Mat. 5 47

Imitate this perfection of Gods Love; Mat. 5 48

[And have his benediction from above.]
Touching your giving alms; If ye regard Mat. 6 1

Applause of men, expect no more reward.
Vainglory makes the hypocrites proclaim it; Mat. 6 2

And they receive the recompense they aim at.
Be thou so private, it may scarce be known Mat. 6 3

To thee thy self, what thou thy self have done.
That He who sees the greatest secrecy, Mat. 6 4

May (at the last) reward thee openly.
And when thou pray'st, pray not like those that do it Mat. 6 5

In greatest concourse, that the world may know it.
But shut thy door; be sure thou shall be heard: Mat. 6 6

Thy private prayer he will publicly reward.
Nor pray like heathens, over and over again; Mat. 6 7

Who think their strings repeated must obtain.
God knows before hand what ye have to say. Mat. 6 8

After this manner therefore you may pray: Mat. 6 9

Our Heavenly Father, hallowed be thy Name.
Enlarge thy Kingdom, and confirm the same. Mat. 6 10

Grant that thy will we may fulfill in love,
As it is done by every one above.
Vouchsafe this day our daily bread to send us. Mat. 6 11

And pardon us, as we do those offend us. Mat. 6 12

Whatever the world, whatever the flesh or Devil Mat. 6 13

Tempting attempt, deliver us from evil.
For thou art King of glorious power [and then
Wilt still be so] when time's no more. Amen. Luke 11 1

(This form he also gave, when asked by one
For such a form, as others had of John.) Luke 11 2

Pardons (said he) are so bestowed upon you, Mat. 6 14
Luke 11 3

As you your selves do pardon those that wrong you. Mat. 6 15
Luke 11 4

Moreover, in your private fasts, sequester Mat. 6 16

That hypocritical affected gesture.
Wash and anoint thy self: and shun their puther, Mat. 6 17

Who both reward and fast to one another.
Fast not to men, but unto God; and see, Mat. 6 18

If God do n't recompense thee openly.
Lay up no treasure here for moth and rust; Mat. 6 19
Luke 12 33

And where (for thieves) ye know not whom to trust.
Lay't up in heaven; such things approach not thither: Mat. 6 20
Luke 12 34

Your heart and treasure will be both together. Mat. 6 21

Both soul and body are directed well, Mat. 6 22
Luke 11 34

If light in the eye and in the judgment dwell. Luke 11 35

But being clouded with blind avarice, Mat. 6 23
Luke 11 36

How dismal an obscurity is this!
For God and Mammon are so opposite, Mat. 6 24

They cannot both be served by mortal wight.
Take then no thought for things to drink or eat: Mat. 6 25
Luke 12 22

God gives you life; he will (surely) give you meat. Luke 12 23

He feeds the fowls, that neither reap nor sow: Mat. 6 26
Luke 12 24

Are ye not better than the birds (I trow?)
But which of you take all the thought you can, Mat. 6 27
Luke 12 25

Can make himself one whit the taller man? Luke 12 26

And then for clothes; the lilies here (ye know) Mat. 6 28
Luke 12 27

Nor toil, nor spin; yet see but how they grow!
That even Solomon in all his glory Mat. 6 29

Was not aray'd like one of these before y'.
Be not so faithless as to think your Father Mat. 6 30
Luke 12 28

Will cloth the grass, and not his children rather.
Take then no thought for victuals or for suits:
These are the chiefest care of heathen brutes. Mat. 6 31
Luke 12 29

Your father knows ye cannot be without them:
Ye need not be so anxious then about them. Mat. 6 32
Luke 12 30

His kingdom first and Right'ousness pursue:
The rest shall all be added unto you. Mat. 6 33
Luke 12 31

My little flock, away with fears and cares:
Your Fathers will has made you Royal heirs. Luke 12 32

Be not solicitous about to morrow:
The present day is full enough of sorrow. Acts 4 34.
Mat. 6 34

Rather give alms, let what ye have be sold:
And so provide you bag^, that wax not old. Luke 12 33

Judge not, and be not judged: for as ye judge,
That judgment to receive ye must not grudge. Mat. 7 1

How can thou hypocritically cry, Mat. 7 2

Of that same straw I Will clear my brothers eye; Mat. 7 3

When in thine own there is a beam? Correct Mat. 7 4

Thy own ways first, and then let him be checked. Mat. 7 5

To Cynick teeth expose not things divine;
Nor Diamond-doctrines to the feet of swine. Mat. 7 6

Although a friend at midnight may deny Luke 11 5

To rise, and do his friend a courtesy; Luke 11 6

Yet if his friend be but importunate,
He Will rise and help him (be it never so late.) Luke 11 7
Luke 11 8

Be earnest in your prayers; ask, seek, and knock; Mat. 7 7

Receive, and find, and heaven-gates unlock. Mat. 7 8
Luke 11 9

What man (for bread) will give his child a stone, Luke 11 10

Or give him (for a fish] a scorpion? Mat. 7 9
Luke 11 11
Mat. 7 10
Luke 11 12

If ye (whose goodness comes from him) do so, Mat. 7 11

Much more shall he his Ghostly gifts bestow. Luke 11 13

Observe that general Law, to others do, Mat. 7 12

As ye are willing should be done to you.
The broad way shun wherein the rabble treads, Mat. 7 13

Which unto death and so to ruin leads.
Strive (with a few) to enter at the gate Mat. 7 14

That leads to life; because it is very straight.
Beware of teachers clothed in woolly skin, Mat. 7 15

But are indeed as ravenous wolves within; Mat. 7 16

You Will know them by their lives and by their lips: Mat. 7 17

It Is not a vine that bears haws or heps.
The root and fruit are both alike: the fruit Mat. 7 18

Will truly show the nature of the root.
And if the fruit be naught, the tree is good Mat. 7 19

For nothing but to find Hellfire food. Mat. 7 20

Lord, Lord: will never into heaven admit them, Mat. 7 21

Unless an holy life before hand fit them.
For workers of iniquity will plead, Mat. 7 22

That in my name they have often preached and prayed,
Cast Devils out, and many wonders done: Mat. 7 23

But then shall I disown them every one.
Therefore all they that practice what they hear, Mat. 7 24

With prudence on a Rock their building rear.
And all the storms and winds that beat and blow, Mat. 7 25

That firm foundation cannot overthrow.
But they that never practice what they hear, Mat. 7 26

With folly on the sand their building rear:
Which, when the storms and winds do beat and blow, Mat. 7 27
Luke 6 49

With dreadful fall they quickly overthrow.
And when these sayings to an end were brought, Mat. 7 28

The people were amazed at what he taught:
Who taught them with authority, and so Mat. 7 29

As feeble Scribes were never wont to do.
6.
From thence to Capernaum Jesus went: Mat. 8 5
Luke 7 1

And there the Elders of the Jews were sent, Luke 7 2

To gain his will to heal a Captains servant. Mat. 8 6
Luke 7 3

And they (in their request) were very fervent. Luke 7 4

This man (said they) deserves it at thy hand: Luke 7 5

He founded us a Church, and loves our Land.
And as He went along with them, to cure him; Mat. 8 7
Luke 7 6

The Captain sent some friends of his, t'assure him,
That he [a Gentile] was not fit enough Mat. 8 8

To harbor such a One within his roof.
Therefore (said he) I durst not see my Lord: Luke 7 7

I Am sure of help, if thou but speak the word.
For I (though so inferior a Commander) Mat. 8 9
Luke 7 8

Can make my men come hither or go yonder.
Then Jesus (turning to the people) says, Mat. 8 10
Luke 7 9

All Israel has afforded no such faith.
Hell's for the Jews; when (from the East and West) Mat. 8 11

The heathens shall with Abraham be blessed. Mat. 8 12

So they returned, and (as he told them) found Mat. 8 13
Luke 7 10

The paralytick man both safe and sound.
7.
The next day after, Jesus went along Luke 7 11

Towered Naim City, with a mighty throng.
And there he met (without the City walls) Luke 7 12

A widows only sons sad funerals,
Attended with much people of the place
Condoling of her lamentable case.
And at the sight his bowels did relent, Luke 7 13

Weep not (said he) thy loss do I resent.
When to the Bier he came, the bearers staid; Luke 7 14

Then did he touch the same, and thus he said;
Young man arise. He could not but obey,
[And op'en his eyes, that had been cold as clay:]
Then sitting up, he spoke exceeding plain, Luke 7 15

And Jesus gave him to his friends again.
Great fear surpised all those that saw the same; Luke 7 16

Who therefore praised the great Jehovahs Name:
Because he had his people visited,
And raised a prophet that could raise the dead.
Which rumor quickly was divulged throughout Luke 7 17

Judca and the Region round about.
8.
John heard it too; and sent to Christ, to know, Mat. 11 2
Luke 7 18

Whether he were indeed the Christ or no. Mat. 11 3
Luke 7 19

Now Jesus (when the two disciples came) Luke 7 20

Was healing men possessed, and blind, and lame. Luke 7 21

Tell John (said he) what miracles are wrought, Mat. 11 4
Luke 7 22

And how the Gospel to the poor is taught. Mat. 11 5

And blessed is he that takes no offense Mat. 11 6
Luke 7 23

At this my Jew-despised exigence.
Then Jesus (when the messengers were gone) Mat. 11 7
Luke 7 24

Thus to his Auditors commended John:
What went ye forth to see? a wavering reed? Mat. 11 8
Luke 7 25

Or one arrayed like the Royal seed?
What went ye forth to see? a Prophet? yea, Mat. 11 9
Luke 7 26

No Prophet ever was so great as He.
He it is, of whom the Prophecy does say, Mat. 11 10
Luke 7 27

I send my Messenger, to clear thy way.
And yet the meanest Gospel-minister Mat. 11 11
Luke 7 28

Before this great Law-prophet I prefer.
Till John the types and prophesies foretold, Mat. 11 12
Luke 16 16

What John's forefinger bids you now behold. Mat. 11 13

Come ye but hear and understand; in sum, Mat. 11 14

This that Elias is, that was to come. Mat. 11 15

Yet few embraced his Gospel, save the worst;
Which have no right (ye think) but are accursed.
Heathens and Publicans (indeed) conform Luke 7 29

So thick, as if they Heaven meant to storm.
But Pharisees and Lawyers have rejected Luke 7 30

His good advice from God to them directed.
What shall I say then to this peevish race, Mat. 11 16
Luke 7 31

But what the boys are wont in the marketplace:
Ye dance not at our merry pipe; our ditty Mat. 11 17
Luke 7 32

(Though never so doleful) will not move your pity?
For John's austerity ye have oppressed Mat. 11 18
Luke 7 33

With infamy, as if he were possessed:
I that am free free and affable, have got Mat. 11 19
Luke 7 34

The title of a Glutton and a Sot.
But all true sons of Wisdom justify
Both him and me from all your obloquy. Luke 7 35

9.
Then did the Lord their unbelief upbraid, Mat. 11 20

To whom his power had chiefly been displayed.
Woe to Cho azin, to Bethsaida woe! Mat. 11 21

For Tire and Sidon would have long ago
Themselves in sackcloth humbled, had they been
Spectators of the things, that ye have seen.
I tell you therefore, in the Judgement-day Mat. 11 22

A greater doom shall ye receive than they.
In wonders Capernaum does excel; Mat. 11 23

And their neglect will thrust her down to hell.
If Sodom and Gomorrah had enjoyed them,
That fire and brimstone had not yet destroyed them.
I tell you therefore, in the Judgement-day Mat. 11 24

She shall receive a greater doom than they.
Thanks to my Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, Mat. 11 25

Who slightest men of parts and noble birth;
And do these mysteries to Children show:
Because it is thy pleasure so to do. Mat. 11 26

Thou have delivered every thing to me; Mat. 11 27

And I am fully known to none but thee:
And so thy glorious person is concealed
Only to me and through me revealed.
Come unto me, all ye that are oppressed; Mat. 11 28

Come unto me, and I will give you rest.
Submit your selves to this my Discipline: Mat. 11 29

'Twill prove the best and sweetest Anodyne.
[I do not tyrannize with rig'rous might:] Mat. 11 30

My yoke is easy and my burden light.
10.
About this season (being invited) he Luke 7 36

Lay down to dinner with a Pharisee.
A woman of the City thither came Luke 7 37

(Whose life had gained her a notorious name)
And brought (within an Alabaster pot)
The delicatest ointment could be got.
She knee^'d behind his feet; and when they were
Washed with her tears, she dried them with her hair Luke 7 38

Then (having kissed them) with her oil so sweet
Bathed his beloved, well-beloved feet.
The Pharisee (observing what was done)
Wondered that Jesus let her thus alone. Luke 7 39

Were this (thought he) a Prophet (as they deem)
He would have known, who it is that touches him.
Simon (said Jesus) somewhat I should say. Luke 7 40

Master (said Simon) let me hear't, I pray,
Two men (said He) to pay to One were bound, Luke 7 41

One twenty shilling, the other twenty pound:
And when they had not wherewithal to pay, Luke 7 42

He cancelled and threw the bonds away.
Which of the two (dost' think) will love him most?
Why, he by whom the greatest sum was lost. Luke 7 43

You Are in the right (said Christ.) Now do but see,
How very different your dealings be.
Thou did me not with common water greet: Luke 7 44

Her penitential tears have washed my feet.
My cheek with common kiss thou did not greet: Luke 7 45

She has not yet left kissing of my feet.
My head with common oil thou did not greet: Luke 7 46

Her pleasant ointment has persum'd my feet.
Her sins are pardoned, which she knew were many: Luke 7 47

Though thou (perhaps) do think thou have not any.
Then he addressed himself to her, and said, Luke 7 48

Thy sins are pardoned, all thy debts are paid --.
This startled all the rest that were at dinner: Luke 7 49

What man (said they) can thus discharge a sinner?
-- The Faith (said Christ) has gained thee this release: Luke 7 50

And therefore (Daughter) go thy way in peace.
11
Jesus went (after this) from town to town Luke 8 1

(With his Apostles) preaching up and down.
And certain grateful women bore his charge, Luke 8 2

Whom He from evil spirits set at large.
Mary (from whom went seven) and Susannah, Luke 8 3

Wish Herod's steward Chuza's wife Joanna.
12.
Then brought they one possessed, both dumb and blind: Mat. 12 22
Luke 11 14

But at his word the Devil soon resigned.
So that the people were amazed; and gave it Mat. 12 23

For granted, He was Christ (the Son of David.)
But Scribes came thither from Jerusalem, Mat. 12 24
Mar. 3 22
Luke 11 15

those Hellish malice made 'em thus blaspheme;
^e beats the Devils down but with a club
^hat's borrowed of their Grand-fire Beelzebub.
Housen (said Christ) or Kingdoms, that divide Mat. 12 25
Mar. 3 23
Luke 11 17

themselves against themselves, cannot long abide. Mar. 3 24

^f Devils thus among themselves contend, Mat. 12 26
Mar. 3 25
Luke 11 18

^oon will their self distracted Kingdom end. Mar. 3 26

You think your own Exorcists do it by Mat. 12 27
Luke 11 19

The power of Gods spirit: why not I?
But if I do, then am I David's son; Mat. 12 28
Luke 11 20

Ye may be sure, that Kingdom is begun:
^ ruin Satan's plots, I bind his hands; Mat. 12 29
Mar. 3 27
Luke 11 21

^ vanquish vice, wherein his Kingdom stands. Luke 11 22

And he that helps me not to beat him down, Mat. 12 30
Luke 11 23

Hinders the advancement of my Royal Crown.
All sin may be forgiven whatsoever: Mat. 12 31
Mar. 3 28
Luke 12 10

But this malicious Blasphemy shall never.
Whoever imputes what Heavens Holy Spirit Mar. 3 29
Mat. 12 32

Works, unto Hells black art, shall Hell inherit. Mar. 3 30

Show me the fruit, I know the tree: and so Mat. 12 33

These wicked words your wicked hearts do show.
For from the fountain of the heart does spring Mat. 12 34

Both every good and every evil thing.
But at the last men must a reckoning make Mat. 12 35

For all the idle words they ever spoke.
And then thy sound or thy corrupted breath Mat. 12 36

Will prove a savor unto life or death. Mat. 12 37

13.
Some then desired him a sign to show, Mat. 12 38
Luke 11 16

Whom Jesus thought not fit to yield unto.
Ye shall e're long (said he) have such a one, as Mat. 12 39
Luke 11 29

Was once prefigur'd in the Prophet Jonas.
As the third day gave him his second birth, Mat. 12 40
Luke 11 30

So then shall I forsake the teeming earth. Luke 11 31

Those Ninevires condemn this stubborn race: Mat. 12 41
Luke 11 32

For here is a Greater in their Prophets place.
The Southern Queen condemns you every one: Mat. 12 42

For here is a Greater than King Solomon.
I have begun to cast your Devil out; Mat. 12 43
Luke 11 24

Who roving solitarily about,
At length returns, and [at the open door] Mat. 12 44
Luke 11 25

Espies his house deck^ better than before:
Then with a seav'n-fold power will he venture Mat. 12 45
Luke 11 26

(To your eternal ruin) to reenter.
14.
While yet he spoke, his Brethren and his Mothe^ Mat. 12 46
Mar. 3 31
Luke 8 19

Could not come near; they throug'd so one another.
Then was he told by those that stood about, Mat. 12 47
Mar. 3 32
Luke 8 20

Thy Mother and thy Brethren are without, dee^
And fain would speak with thee. But whom do you Mat. 12 48
Mar. 3 33

To be (said he) my kindred? I esteem
These men my nearest and my dearest kin, Mat. 12 49
Mar. 3 34

Which have my faithfullest Disciples bin: Luke 8 21

He that obeys my Father, is my Brother; Mat. 12 50
Mar. 3 35

And she likewise, my Sister and my Mother.
How blessed (said a woman) is the womb Luke 11 27

And paps, from whence thy nourishment has come ^
Yea, blessed are they (said He) a great deal rather, Luke 11 28

Which hear and do the will of God my Father.
15.
That very day did he from shipboard teach Mat. 13 1
Mar. 4 1
Luke 8 4

Great multitudes of people on the Beach. Mat. 13 2
Mar. 4 2

A husbandman (said he) w^nt out to sow; Mat. 13 3
Mar. 4 3
Luke 8 5

And some seed fell, where people used to go: Mat. 13 4
Mar. 4 4

Which lying open to the fowls, they came
And very greedily devoured the same.
Some fell upon a ground of stone, and there Mat. 13 5
Mar. 4 5
Luke 8 6

The upstart blade was quickly made appear: Mat. 13 6
Mar. 4 6

But when the sun grew hot, it withered quite;
Because the rooting was so very slight.
Some fell (again) upon a ground of thorn, Mat. 13 7
Mar. 4 7
Luke 8 7

Which overpowered and choked the corn.
Some falling on a good and fertile soil, Mat. 13 8
Mar. 4 8
Luke 8 8

Did variously reward the plowmans toil.
He that has got an ear to hear, may hear: Mat. 13 9
Mar. 4 9

[But all have not an understanding ear.]
Then his Disciples asked him, why he spoke Mat. 13 10
Mar. 4 10
Luke 8 9

So Euigmatically to the flock.
Because (said he) to you alone it is given, Mat. 13 11
Mar. 4 11
Luke 8 10

To understand the mysteries of heaven.
They that do know and practice, shall have more; Mat. 13 12

Others shall lose the things they had before.
So these that think they have both eve and ear, Is. 6. 9.
Mat. 13 13

Indeed and truth do neither see nor hear.
So said Isaiah to this hardened land; Mat. 13 14

Hear ye and see, but nothing understand.
In judgment are they blind, and so gross-hearted; Mat. 13 15
Mar. 4 12

Lest they should understand and be converted.
Ye hear and see, what all the Prophets could Mat. 13 16

Nor hear nor see, though very sain they would. Mat. 13 17

Hear then this parable more plain expressed; Mat. 13 18

Which is (indeed) amongst the easiest. Mar. 4 13

^he Preacher sows the word of God; and they Mat. 13 19
Mar. 4 14
Luke 8 11

Which do not understand it, are the highway: Luke 8 12

because their hearts do not the seed admit, Mar. 4 15

^he foul-mouthed Prince of the air devoureth it.
that which the stony-ground receives with joy, Mat. 13 20
Mar. 4 16
Luke 8 13

^he heat of persecution will destroy. Mat. 13 21
Mar. 4 17

^he thorns and briars (where the seed was hurld) Mat. 13 22
Mar. 4 18
Luke 8 14

^oint out the cares and riches of the world. Mar. 4 19

^n solid, honest hearts the word takes root, Mat. 13 23
Mar. 4 20
Luke 8 15

And (more or less) it bears a precious fruit.
The Earthly Heaven (said the Lord again) Mat. 13 24

^s like a field that bears the choicest grain.
^ut while the farmer dreams of no such matters, Mat. 13 25

^ome envious hand or other darnel scatters.
And when the Corn and that begin to appear, Mat. 13 26

Who (say the servants) sowed the darnel here? Mat. 13 27

None but an enemy (quoth he) would do it. Mat. 13 28

Shall we (say they) advance it by the root?
No (says the Master) lest ye hurt the corn: Mat. 13 29

Until the harvest let it be forborne.
And then the reapers (whom I use to hire) Mat. 13 30

Shall house the wheat, and hurl the weed in fire.
Again, the word dispensed aright (said He) Mar. 4 26

Is like to seed that grows insensibly. Mar. 4 27

Whose fruit of Grace (which no device can blast) Mar. 4 28

Comes to a Glorious harvest at the last. Mar. 4 29

Again, my Kingdom's like a mustard seed, Mat. 13 31
Mar. 4 30
Luke 13 18

That yields a tree wherein the birds may breed. Mar. 4 31
Luke 13 19

From small beginnings it will greatly grow; Mat. 13 32
Mar. 4 32
Luke 13 20

Just as the leven spreads among the dough. Mar. 4 33
Luke 13 21

In such plain parables (and yet sublime) Mat. 13 33
Mar. 4 34

He couched his Doctrine all at that same time. Mat. 13 34

Fulfilling what the Psalmist once foretold, Mat. 13 35
Ps. 78. 2.

I Will parables declare both dark and old.
Then the Disciples prayed him to explain Mat. 13 36

The meaning of the Darnel and the Grain. Mat. 13 37

The Grain (said he) are You, whom I have sown; Mat. 13 38

The Ray's the offspring of the wicked One. Mat. 13 39

Which in the final harvest of the world Mat. 13 40

Shall by the Angels into Hell be hurled. Mat. 13 41

And then the Right'ous like the Sun shall shine, Mat. 13 42

They that can hear, let them their ear incline. Mat. 13 43

He that has found where treasure is concealed, Mat. 13 43

Sells all he has and purchases the field:
So is the Gospel. So a Merchant-man Mat. 13 44

Makes all the money, all the means he can, Mat. 13 45

To gain a costly diamond; to gain Mat. 13 46

What doubly will reward his cost and pain.
It Is like a Net enclosing great and small;
(All are enclosed, because they 're fishes all:) Mat. 13 47

But on the shore their good or bad condition Mat. 13 48

Must undergo the Fishers inquisition.
And so the Angels at the latter day
Shall save the good, and throw the bad away. Mat. 13 49

Then Jesus asked his Scholars, if they thought Mat. 13 50

These things intelligible, which he taught. Mat. 13 51

They answered, Yes, all this we understand.
Take notice then (said he) of this command; Mat. 13 52

Lay safely up (for treasure) all you have heard,
Be like to Scribes for Heaven well prepared;
Or like to skillful Houshoulders, that show
(Upon occasion) things both old and new.
Who lights a candle, to be covered Mar. 4 21
Luke 8 16

Beneath a narrow bushel or a bed?
All that I tell you here, must come to light: Mar. 4 22
Luke 8 17

All must be made appear to all men's sight.
Ye that can hear, to this incline your ear: Mar. 4 23

Take special heed both what and how ye hear. Mar. 4 24
Luke 8 18

Look how much care and diligence ye take,
So much the greater profit will ye make.
Gifts well employed the Lord intends to bless; Mar. 4 25

Which not employed must needs grow less and less.
16.
Now when the evening came, he bad, them make Mat. 8 23
Mar. 4 35
Luke 8 22

Towered the other side of this Tiberian lake. Mar. 4 36

And being under sail, the wind and sea Mat. 8 24
Mar. 4 37
Luke 8 23

Were like to cast the ships and them away.
They (as their sacred anchor) flee to Him: Mat. 8 25
Mar. 4 38
Luke 8 24

Carest thou nothing, if we sink or swim?
He then awoke, and (rising from his pillow) Mat. 8 26
Mar. 4 39

Rebuked the wind, and calmed every billow: Luke 8 25

Chiding their fluctuating faith. And they Mat. 8 27
Mar. 4 43

Wondered to see the imperious wind obey. Mar. 4 41

17.
Now to the place of Gaderines he comes: Mat. 8 28
Mar. 5 1
Luke 8 26

Where two Demoniacks met him from the tombs.
One was so fierce and fell, his furious hands Mar. 5 2
Luke 8 27

Snapt (like a twined thread) the strongest bands: Mar. 5 3

Ranging about the Hills and Monuments, Mar. 5 4

Yelling, and lancing of himself with flints. Mar. 5 5

Christ at a distance he beheld and knew, Mar. 5 6
Luke 8 28

And prostrate at his feet himself he threw.
Jesus (said he) thou Son of God, be gone; Mat. 8 29
Mar. 5 7

And (by the Great Jehovah) let m' alone:
Let me alone; confine me not as yet
Within that bottomless and easeless pit.
For He had said, come forth thou fiend [so mad:] Mar. 5 8
Luke 8 29

Asking (besides) what kind of name he had. Mar. 5 9
Luke 8 30

I have (said he) as large a name as any:
Legion I Am called, for truly we are many.
Pray let us not be utterly cashiered: Mar. 5 10
Luke 8 31

Grant us possession of that swinish herd. Mat. 8 30
Mar. 5 11

These were about two thousand there at grass: Mat. 8 31
Mar. 5 12
Luke 8 32

And into them (by Jesus' leave) they past.
Then running down a place exceeding steep, Mat. 8 32
Mar. 5 13
Luke 8 33

The dirty swine were drowned in the deep.
And when the hogherds saw't, away they fled, Mat. 8 33
Mar. 5 14
Luke 8 34

To tell the people how their cattle sped.
To see this accident the people ran; Mat. 8 34
Mar. 5 15
Luke 8 35

And when they came, they saw the savage man
Sit clothed and in his wits at Jesus' feet:
And they were all astonished to see it.
But being informed what became of 's host, Mar. 5 16
Luke 8 36

They prayed Jesus to depart the coast. Mar. 5 17
Luke 8 37

So taking ship, the man would scarce forsake him, Mar. 5 18
Luke 8 38

[For fear the Legion again should take him.]
Go home (said Christ) fear no such future evil; Mar. 5 19
Luke 8 39

[I can (though absent) guard thee from the Devil.]
Go; let the mercies of the Lord be blazed. Mar. 5 20

He went; and made Decapolis amazed.
18.
Now after Jesus was again come over, Mat. 9 1
Mar. 5 21
Luke 8 40

He found the people waiting on the shore.
A Ruler of the Synagogue then came Mat. 9 18
Mar. 5 22
Luke 8 41

And worshipped Jesus (Jairus was his name)
Lord, come (said he) and touch, and so recover Mar. 5 23
Luke 8 42

My little Daughter that is given over.
And as they both together went along, Mat. 9 19
Mar. 5 24

A certain woman crowded in the throng; Mat. 9 20
Mar. 5 25
Luke 8 43

Which had a flux for twelve long years endured,
Spent all she had, and could not yet be cured. Mar. 5 26

I know (said she) I should be as I ought, Mat. 9 21
Mar. 5 27

Could I but touch this Great Physici'ans coat. Mar. 5 28

With much ado she reached the fringe or border,
And straight perceived her body was in order. Luke 8 44

Then Jesus turned and asked, Who touched me thus? Mar. 5 29

Peter replied, They throng both thee and us. Mat. 9 22
Mar. 5 30
Luke 8 45

Some body has (said he, and looked about) Mar. 5 31

I find that healing virtue is gone out. Mar. 5 32
Luke 8 46

And when the woman saw she was not hid;
She kneeling, trembling, told him what she did. Mar. 5 33
Luke 8 47

Daughter (said he) thine own believing heart
Was the instrument of cure; in peace depart. Mar. 5 34
Luke 8 48

Then one of Jairus' servants came, and s'ed,
Thou need'st not trouble Him; thy Daughter's dead, Mar. 5 35
Luke 8 49

Be not afraid (said Christ) do but believe;
Thou shall thy daughter safe and sound receive. Mar. 5 36
Luke 8 50

Then coming to the house, he suffered none
To follow him, save Peter, James, and John. Mar. 5 37
Luke 8 51

And hearing what a doleful din they kept, Mat. 9 23
Mar. 5 38
Luke 8 52

He told them that the Dam'sel only slept. Mat. 9 24
Mar. 5 39

They laughed at that. Stand back (said he) give way;
And (with her parents) entered, where she lay. Mar. 5 40
Luke 8 53

Dam'sel (said he) arise from off thy bed. Mat. 9 25
Mar. 5 41
Luke 8 54

She did: and they were all astonished. Mat. 9 26
Mar. 5 42
Luke 8 55

Now let her eat (said he) what meat she can: Mar. 5 43
Luke 8 56

But let not this be known to any man.
19.
And as he went from thence, two men implored. Mat. 9 27

His mercy, and to have their sight restored.
Do ye believe indeed (said he) that this Mat. 9 28

Within my power is? They answered, Yes.
Then touching their benighted eyes, he says, Mat. 9 29

Be It to you both according to your faith.
They saw: and he (so far from all vainglory) Mat. 9 30

Bad them conceal, and not reveal the story.
But they departed; and (wheree're they came) Mat. 9 31

In all the country spread abroad his fame.
20.
They brought him then a dumb Demoniack: Mat. 9 32

Who being dispossessed, distinctly spoke.
Who (said the amazed people) who can tell,
When such a thing was seen in Israel? Mat. 9 33

The Pharisees (again blaspheming) said,
He casts out Devils by the Devils aid. Mat. 9 34

21.
Jesus from thence (with his Disciples) went Mat. 13 54
Mar. 6 1

Where formerly his private life was spent.
And as he taught, they wondered He should know Mat. 13 55
Mar. 6 2

Such things, who never had been bred thereto.
Thus they were prejudiced, because they knew Mat. 13 56
Mar. 6 3

Him, and his trade, and his Relations too.
It Is very true (said he, that knew their mind) Mat. 13 57
Mar. 6 4

Prophets at home worst entertainment find. Mar. 6 5

Your strange and monstrous unbelief has hind'red Mat. 13 58
Mar. 6 6

My working miracles among my kindred.
22.
Then Jesus went and preached about, and wrought Mat. 9 35

Wonders and cures in proof of what he taught:
Pitying the feeble multitude, that were Mat. 9 36

Scattered like sheep without a shepherds care.
The Crop is great (said he) and it is as true, Mat. 9 37

That faithful, skilful workmen are as few.
But pray to God, that he would send abroad Mat. 9 38

Laborers void of folly and of fraud.
And now do, what I chose you twelve to do, Mat. 10 1
Mar. 6 7
Luke 9 1

Perambulate the Land by two and two. Mat. 10 2

Pass by Samaritan and Heathen towns: Mat. 10 3

Seek ye the sheep that stray on Jewish downs. Mat. 10 4

This Doctrine preach, Christ's kingdom is begun: Mat. 10 5
Luke 9 2

Prove it by miracles, as I have done. Mat. 10 6

Cast out the Devils, cause the dead to live: Mat. 10 7

Ye freely have received, freely give. Mat. 10 8

Provide no money, no more clothes; ^o forth, Mat. 10 9
Luke 9 3

Just as you are: your work is somew^^^ worth. Mat. 10 10
Mar. 6 8

And tarry, when ye come to any Town; Mat. 10 11
Mar. 6 9

In one good house; and slit not up and down.
Wish peace on such a house peace shall remain; Mat. 10 12
Mar. 6 10
Luke 9 4

From others it returns to you again. Mat. 10 13

If any Town your words or you disgust, Mar. 6 11
Luke 9 5

Witness against them, shaking off their dust. Mat. 10 14

And in the judgment-day shall these have sorrow,
Much more than those of Sodom and Gomorrah. Mat. 10 15

Ye go like sheep among the wolvish droves;
Be wise as serpents, harmless as the Doves. Mat. 10 16

Beware of men: to Councils they will accuse you;
And often in their Synagogues abuse you. Mat. 10 17

Before the Roman powers you will be led:
(And so the Gospel shall be further spread.) Mat. 10 18

But trouble not your selves, what then to say:
Your answer shall be ready at that day. Mat. 10 19
Mar. 6 12
Luke 9 11

You answer not so much, as does the spirit,
Which from your Heavenly Father ye inherit. Mat. 10 20
Luke 9 12

A Brother will inform against a Brother:
One seeming Christian will betray another. Mat. 10 21

None will endure you: but if you endure Mat. 10 22

To the end, be sure you shall be then secure.
When persecuted, flee from Town to town: Mat. 10 23

Before you have done, I Will pour my vengeance down.
Ye must not look to have the worlds good word, Mat. 10 24

When Him they so abuse that is your Lord. Mat. 10 25

Then fear them not: let nothing be concealed; Mat. 10 26

What I have told you, must be all revealed.
Proclaim aloud, whatever I whisper here: Mat. 10 27
Luke 12 2

And do not body-burning Tyrants fear. Luke 12 3

Fear him that can both heaven and Earth control, Mat. 10 28
Luke 12 4

And bid hell-flames devour both body' and soul. Luke 12 5

It Is He, by whom your very hairs are told. Mat. 10 29
Luke 12 6

Are not two sparrows for a farthing sold? Mat. 10 30
Luke 12 7

Not one of them drops down without your Father. Mat. 10 31

And will he not look after You much rather?
Own me before the world, and you I Will own, Mat. 10 32
Luke 12 8

Then when ye come before my Fathers throne.
Deny me (if you please;) I Will you deny, Mat. 10 33
Luke 12 9

Then when you come before his Majesty.
For I am come to light a trying fire, Luke 12 49

Whose kindling I most ardently desire.
But I my self must first be dipped therein: Luke 12 50

How am I st st^^^ghtned till it does begin!
Think not that I am come to settle peace: Mat. 10 34
Luke 12 51

For (with the Gospel) troubles will increase.
Through Satan's malice it will set at strife Mat. 10 35
Luke 12 52

Father and Son, the Husband and the Wife. Mat. 10 36
Luke 12 53

And he that sets the dearest friend above me, Mat. 10 37
Luke 14 26

I set him down for one not worthy of me.
And so is he that bears not his cross, Mat. 10 38
Luke 14 27

And follows me; although to's outward loss.
Now you're precaution'd. Who begins a tower, Luke 14 28

Before he weighs the utmost of his power?
For otherwise he gains but a jeer; Luke 14 29

Because he founded, what he could not rear. Luke 14 30

Or what King goes to undertake a war, Luke 14 31

Before he knows how strong his forces are?
But rather than unequally engage, Luke 14 32

He Will try to qualify the others rage.
So ye beforehand on your losses think; Luke 14 33

That when your trial comes, ye may not shrink.
He that loves life before the Gospels profit, Mat. 10 39

He shall for ever be deprived of it.
But he that will expose his life for me,
Shall live, and only lose mortality.
Whosoever receives you that bear my name, Mat. 10 40

Receives me, and Him from whom I came.
And if to God and Me he has regard, Mat. 10 41

He shall receive our Messengers reward.
That cup of water which is given so, Mat. 10 42

Shall with eternal blessings overflow.
So the Apostles went and preached about, Mat. 11 1
Mar. 6 12
Luke 9 6

Healing with oil, and casting Devils out.
He (in their absence) traveled up and down, Mar. 6 13

Preaching the word in Country and in Town.
23.
Now Herod Antipas (the incest'ous beast) Mat. 14 6
Mar. 6 21

Invited all his Gallants to a feast.
And as the Daughter of Herodias Mar. 6 22

(In dancing) hugely pleased Antipas.
He swore he would grant (that very day of's birth) Mat. 14 7
Mar. 6 23

What e're she asked, to half the Kingdoms worth.
She asked her Mother, what she should demand; Mar. 6 24

And this her wicked answer was at hand;
In thy demands (my Daughter) be no larger Mat. 14 8

Than John the Baptists head within a charger.
So in she comes: My Lord (said she) I wish Mar. 6 25

The head of John the Baptist in a dish.
The King was very loath (at first) to grant it; Mat. 14 9
Mar. 6 26

But for the sake of's oath she did not want it.
For straight he sent an Executioner, Mat. 14 10
Mar. 6 27

To fetch his head [and tongue] to humor her.
The maid received it, and carried forth Mat. 14 11
Mar. 6 28

T'her Mother more than all the kingdoms worth.
When his Disciples heard of this disaster, Mat. 14 12
Mar. 6 29

They came and decently enterr'd their Master.
24
And Jesus' fame was now so much displayed, Mat. 14 1
Mar. 6 14
Luke 9 7

That Herod's conscience made him sore afraid.
It Is not (said he) Elias, talk not of it; Mat. 14 2
Mar. 6 15
Luke 9 8

Nor yet the soul of any other Prophet;
But He whose head was given for a Ball: Mar. 6 16
Luke 9 9

His works will make my crime prove Capital.
25.
Then came the Twelve, relating how they taught; Mar. 6 30
Luke 9 10

And also all the miracles they wrought.
John's dead (said he:) we'll step aside a while Mat. 14 13
Mar. 6 31

(And leave this crowd) some half a dozen mile. Mar. 6 32

(For now the train of people was so great, Mar. 6 33

They could not gain so much as time to eat.)
And having coasted to Bethsaida Downs, Mat. 14 14
Mar. 6 34
Joh. 6 1

He met a multitude from several towns:
Which (knowing of his going) ran before, Joh. 6 2

And waited there his coming to the shore.
And Jesus pitied them, because they were Luke 9 11

Like straying sheep without a Pastors care:
And with spirit'al food began to feed them; Joh. 6 3

Bestowing cures, as every one did need them.
And towered the evening his Disciples come Mat. 14 15
Mar. 6 35
Luke 9 12

Desiring him to send the people home.
For here (said they) there is nothing to be had; Mat. 14 16
Mar. 6 36

And they have no provision (good or bad.)
Phil'ip (said he, to prove him) where is the meat, Mar. 6 37
Joh. 6 5

Which these my Auditors should have to eat? Joh. 6 6

Five pound (said Philip) will not buy them bread; Luke 9 13
Joh. 6 7

For every one to put a bit in's head.
What have ye here (said Jesus)? One replied, Mat. 14 17
Joh. 6 8

Five barley loaves, two little fish beside. Mar. 6 38
Joh. 6 9

Make them (said he) sit down in equal ranks: Mat. 14 18
Luke 9 14
Joh. 6 10

And so they did. Th^n Jesus (giving thanks) Mar. 6 39
Luke 9 15

Breaks to's Disciples first, and them he wishes Mat. 14 19
Mar. 6 40
Luke 9 16
Joh. 6 11

For to distribute both the bread and fishes.
So the Disciples did, as Jesus willed: Mat. 14 20
Mar. 6 41

And all the people are, and all were filled. Mar. 6 42
Luke 9 17
Joh. 6 12

Let naught (said he) be lost; first let them sup,
Then look and gather all the fragments up.
Which being done, of broken bread and meat Joh. 6 13

They had a dozen basket-full complete. Mar. 6 43

When there had been five thousand men (beside Mat. 14 21
Mar. 6 44

Women and Children) fully satisfied.
26.
And they were so transported with the thing; Joh. 6 14

They called him Christ, and would have made him King
But bidding his Disciples put to Sea, Mat. 14 22
Mar. 6 45

He left the company, and went to pray. Mat. 14 13
Mar. 6 46
Joh. 6 15

And in the mountain he was left behind,
While they were struggling with the tide and wind. Mat. 14 24
Mar. 6 47
Joh. 6 16

But having rowed about a league, they spied Mat. 14 25
Mar. 6 48
Joh. 6 17

Almighty Jesus wa king by their side. Joh. 6 18

And they cried out, supposing 'twas a sprite: Mat. 14 26
Mar. 6 49
Joh. 6 19

(For now 'twas past the middle of the night.)
But Jesus let them hear his voice, and said, Mat. 14 27
Mar. 6 50
Joh. 6 20

Cheer up, it is I, ye need not be dismayed.
And Simon Peter answered, I^ it is thou. Mat. 14 28

Then call me to thee on the water now.
Well, come (said he.) And Peter walked well, Mat. 14 29

Till's faith (by storms and winds arising) fell. Mat. 14 30

That sinking, he sank too; and sore afraid
Cried out amain to Jesus for his aid.
Who did indeed (with his helping hand) protect him; Mat. 14 31

But for his unbelief he soundly checked him.
And they perceiving that it was the Lord, Joh. 6 21

With all their heart received him on board.
When He came up, they had a calm; and found Mat. 14 32
Mar. 6 51

Themselves arrived, whither they were bound.
Then their astonishment was wonderful; Mar. 6 52

(For they forgot the loaves, they were so dull.)
And falling down before his feet, they cry, Mat. 14 33

Thou art indeed the Son of God most high.
No sooner could their feet on ground be set, Mat. 14 34
Mar. 6 53

But known it was through all Gennesa^et: Mat. 14 35
Mar. 6 54

And notice given unto all diseased; Mat. 14 36
Mar. 6 55

Who touching but his clothes, were all released. Mar. 6 56

27.
Now those five thousand tarried yonder still, Joh. 6 22

And thought next day to have him on the hill: Joh. 6 23

But then perceiving Jesus had forsook 'em, Joh. 6 24

They came to Capernaum for to look him.
Rabbi (said they) which way did thou come hither? Joh. 6 25

(Knowing there was no boat to bring him thither.)
Indeed (said He) it is for the food ye got, Joh. 6 26

But for the miracle ye seek me not.
Feed rather, that ye may for ever live: Joh. 6 27

Such food can I (by my Commission) give.
And what is required of us (said they again) Joh. 6 28

That so we may that other food obtain?
Your duty is (said Jesus) now to yield Joh. 6 29

Assent to Him whom God has sent and sealed.
What we beheld (said they) that is not enough; Joh. 6 30

We cannot yield without a greater proof. Ps. 78. 24.

Our Fathers fed* (as by the Word appears) Joh. 6 31

On Moses' bread from Heaven forty years.
From God (said he) not Moses, came that fare; Joh. 6 32

Nor from the highest Heavens, but the air.
This is true bread, that comes from Heaven indeed; Joh. 6 33

And gives true life to all that truly feed.
But still he carnally was understood:
Feed us (said they) with this transcendent food. Joh. 6 34

I am (said he) this bread of life; and he Joh. 6 35

Shall never hunger more, that feeds on me.
But I, my words, and works are all rejected,
By all that are not thereunto elected, Joh. 6 36

All that the Father gives me, shall believe:
And all that come, I readily receive. Joh. 6 37

For I came down from Heaven, but to do
His will that sent me hither unto You. Joh. 6 38

His will it is, that I should save all those
Whom He has given me, and nothing lose: Joh. 6 39

That I should life and Resurrection give Joh. 6 40

To all that see me, know me, and believe.
This man from Heaven! said they to one another: Joh. 6 41

Did we not know his Father and his Mother? Joh. 6 42

Leave murmuring, said Christ. None come to me,
Except the Father draw them graciously. Is* ^4. 13.
Joh. 6 43

By him alone to me they must be brought: Joh. 6 44

As Esaias writes, Of God they shall be taught. Joh. 6 45

Not that the Father can be seen apart, Joh. 6 46

But by the Son, who fully knows his heart.
They that believe on me, shall live for ever Joh. 6 47

I am that bread of life, that fails never. Joh. 6 48

Manna preserved not alive the eaters: Joh. 6 49

This bread will free from Deaths enslaving fetters. Joh. 6 50

This bread's my flesh, my world redeeming flesh; Joh. 6 51

Celestial bread, which does the soul refresh.
How can this man (thought they) bestow his flesh, Joh. 6 52

To feed our bodies, or our souls refresh?
Except (said he) by says ye feed upon Joh. 6 53

My very flesh and blood, y' are dead and gone.
But he that does do so, shall live for aye; Joh. 6 54

And I will raise him at the latter day.
For unto all that know but how to feed, Joh. 6 55

My flesh and blood are meat and drink indeed.
They that do so, abide and live in me; Joh. 6 56

And I in them to all eternity. Joh. 6 57

For so are they with me incorporated, Joh. 6 58

As I am one with Him that all created.
This coming down from God, and bloody feast Joh. 6 59

Many disciples could not well digest.
(For in the Synagogue 'twas all declared, Joh. 6 60

And therefore both by one and other heard.)
I know your murmuring, said he. Does this Joh. 6 61

Within you raise so great a prejudice?
What if ye should the Son of man behold Joh. 6 62

Ascending thither where he was of old?
I am not to be understood so grossly: Mat. 6 63

I speak of feeding and of food more ghostly.
But some of you believe not; I foresaw them: Mat. 6 64

None come to me, except the Father draw them. Mat. 6 65

At that same word (because he touched the sore.) Mat. 6 66

Many drew back, and followed him no more.
Will ye go too (said Jesus to the Twelve) Mat. 6 67

Will ye go too, and leave me to my self?
To whom (said Simon Peter) should we go? Mat. 6 68

What other can eternal life bestow?
We know and are persuaded every one, Mat. 6 69

That Thou art God Almighty's only Son.
How, every one? said he. But twelve are chosen; Mat. 6 70

And yet there is a Devil in the dozen.
Judas Iscariot was meant by Christ; Mat. 6 71

Him avarice to treachery enticed.
CHAP. 5.
. 1.
NExt Passover He staid not long in Jury, Joh. 6 4

But shunned at home their more enraged fury. Joh. 7 1

And from Jerusalem to Galilee, Mat 15 1
Mar. 7 1

There followed him both Scribe and Pharisee:
Who took occasion, and with Jesus clash'd, Mat 15 2
Mar. 7 2

Because his servants are before they washed,
(For all the Jews do wash them very much: Mar. 7 3

Their vict'als otherwise they will not touch.
So after marketing: and many more Mar. 7 4

Traditions of the Elders they adore.)
Wherefore (said they) do thy Disciples thus Mar. 7 5

Transgress traditions that are given us? Is. 29. 13.

Ye hypocrites (said Jesus) very well Mar. 7 6

Isaiah did concerning you foretell,
This people draws nigh me with their mouth,
Their heart's as far, as is the North from South.
In vain they worship me, while thus they swerve Mar. 7 7

From my Commands, and man's ^mmands observe. Ex. 21. 17.

The Law's transgrest by this your superstition: Mat 15 3
Mar. 7 8

The Law's betrayed by Presbyter-tradition. Mat 15 4
Mar. 7 9

God would have Parents honored and owned; Mat 15 5
Mar. 7 10

And he that curses either, should be stoned: Mat 15 6

If now a man devote his wealth, he is freed Mat 15 7
Mar. 7 11

From succouring his Parents in their need. Mat 15 8
Mar. 7 12

[And ye account a curse as good as none, Mat 15 9
Mar. 7 13

Except it be by Tetragrammaton.]
Hearken (said he to those that stood about him) Mat 15 10
Mar. 7 14

Man is defiled by nothing from without him:
Things from within do really pollute. Mat 15 11
Mar. 7 15

You that have ears to hear, give ear unto't. Mar. 7 16

When Jesus was again retired in, Mat 15 12
Mar. 7 17

Then his Disciples come and thus begin;
Do thou not understand, how greatly thou
Did scandalize the Pharisees but now' Mat 15 13

My Fathers plants (said he) shall thrive and grow,
But others must expect a fatal blow.
Let them alone, blind leaders of the blind; Mat 15 14

Both one and the other for the pit designed.
Explain it unto us (said Peter then) Mat. 15 15
Mar. 7 18

Are you (said He) as yet such silly men? Mat. 15 16
Mar. 7 19

Do n't all ye eat pass through you to the draught? Mat. 15 17
Mar. 7 20

But from the heart comes every evil thought, Mat. 15 18
Mar. 7 21

And word, and work. Now these the soul pollute: Mat. 15 19
Mar. 7 22

To eat with hands unwasht can never do it. Mat. 15 20
Mar. 7 23

2.
From thence departing, Jesus did arrive at Mat. 15 21
Mar. 7 24

The coast of Tire; but could not long be private.
Thither a woman hearing of his fame Mat. 15 22
Mar. 7 25

(Being a Greek-Syrophenician) came,
And very earnestly she did request Mar. 7 26

To have her Daughters Devil dispossessed.
He held his peace: then said the Apostles, Sir, Mat. 15 23

This woman troubles us, pray answer her.
I am to feed poor Isreal's sheep (said he) Mat. 15 24

I am not sent [as yet] to such as she.
Lord help me (then said she upon her knees) Mat. 15 25

My Daughter grievously tormented is.
The Children must be served (said he) I can n't Mat. 15 26
Mar. 7 27

Throw bread to dogs, and let the children want.
Truth Lord (said she) but yet the dogs may eat Mat. 15 27
Mar. 7 28

The scattered crumbs of either bread or meat.
Woman (said he) thy faith is great; receive, Mat. 15 28
Mar. 7 29

As thou desire, as thou do believe.
So home she went, and found her dispossessed Mar. 7 30

And laid upon the bed to take her rest.
3.
Thence through Decapolis he past; and there Mar. 7 31

They brought him one could neither speak nor hear.
His healing hands they prayed him to impose: Mar. 7 32

(Which ceremony Christ had often chose.)
Then (going aside) he touched his tongue with spittle, Mar. 7 33

And put his fingers in his ears a little.
Then looking up to heaven, he sighed, and sed, Mar. 7 34

In Syriak, Eth^athah (be opened.)
The man both heard and spoke: and Jesus charged Mar. 7 35

They should not let the rumor be enlarged.
But they so much the more the matter blazed: Mar. 7 36

As being out of measure all amazed.
His works (said they) are very good ('it is clear) Mar. 7 37

He makes the dumb to speak, the deaf to hear.
4.
And being returned into Galilee, Mat. 15 29

He sat upon a mountain near the sea:
Where at his feet were diverse cast diseased; Mat. 15 30

And (to the peoples wonder) all were eased.
To see them walk and speak and see so well, Mat. 15 31

They glorified the God of Israel.
And having tarried there about three days, Mat. 15 32
Mar. 8 1

Then calling his Apostles, thus he says;
I pity this great multitude, whose vict'l Mar. 8 2

Is brought (by this) to none, or very little.
I Am loath to send them thus away, lest some Mar. 8 3

Should faint away, before they reach their home.
How in this wilderness can we supply Mat. 15 33
Mar. 8 4

With bread (said they) so great a company?
What loaves are here? said He. And when they knew, Mat. 15 34
Mar. 8 5

They told him seav'n, and little fish a few.
Let them sit down (said Jesus) on the banks. Mat. 15 35
Mar. 8 6

They did. And Jesus (having given thanks)
First breaks, and gives the Apostles, whom he wishes Mat. 15 36
Mar. 8 7

So to deliver out the bread and fishes.
Which those Disciples did, as Jesus willed: Mat. 15 37
Mar. 8 8

And all the people ate, and all were filled.
And the remains of what was blessed by him, Mat. 15 38
Mar. 8 9

Filled seven baskets to the very brim.
Children and women having fed, beside
Four thousand men completely satisfied.
5.
From thence he sailed towered Megiddo; whither Mat. 15 39
Mar. 8 10

Came Pharisees and Sadduces together,
Puffed up with wrangling superstitious leaven, Mat. 16 1
Mar. 8 11

And fain would have him show a sign from Heaven.
Ye hypocrites (said he) ye weather-wise Mat. 16 2
Luke 12 54

Prognosticatours of the various skies! Luke 12 55

The ev'ning's red (say you) the morning's gray;
Most hopeful tokens of a pleasant day! Luke 12 56

And can ye not discern that I am He, Mat. 16 3
Luke 12 57

By all the certain signs ye hear and see?
This spurious brood shall never have a bigger, Mat. 16 4
Mar. 8 12

Than what the Prophet Jonas did prefigure.
6.
So leaving them, he sailed back again. Mat. 16 5
Mar. 8 13

Beware (said he to his Disciples then)
Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, Mat. 16 6
Mar. 8 14

And of the sly Herodian Sadduces.
They thought he meant, At table do n't partake Mat. 16 7
Mar. 8 15

With such as they, whatever shift ye make.
For they forgot to carry bread enough, Mat. 16 8
Mar. 8 16

And had in all the Vessel but a loaf.
Why reason ye (said he) about your vict'l? Mat. 16 9
Mar. 8 17

What! is your faith, or is your sense so little? Mar. 8 18

Have ye forgot already how I fed Mat. 16 10
Mar. 8 19

So many thousand with so little bread, Mat. 16 11
Mar. 8 20

And so much left? So then they understood, Mat. 16 12
Mar. 8 21

How that he spoke of Doctrine, not of food.
7.
A blind man (at Bethsaida) then was brought him: Mar. 8 22

To lay his hands upon him they besought him.
And leading him without the town, he wett Mar. 8 23

His eyes with spittle, saying, see thou yet?
Some men I see (said he) but I should doubt Mar. 8 24

They were but trees, but that they walk about.
Then Jesus, having strok'd his eyes again, Mar. 8 25

Bad him look up; and then he saw most plain.
Go to the place (said Jesus) where you dwell; Mar. 8 26

Go not to the Town, nor any Towns-man tell.
8.
Then (by Caesaria-Philippi) He Mat. 16 13
Mar. 8 27
Luke 9 18

Demanded, whom men reckoned him to be. 2 Ma^^. 2 5.

They answered, some say John, and some Elias, Mat. 16 14
Mar. 8 28
Luke 9 19

And some (again) ark-hiding Jeremias,
Or one of the ancient Prophets. But (said he) Mat. 16 15
Mar. 8 29
Luke 9 20

What Is your opinion now concerning me?
Thou art (said Simon Peter for the rest) Mat. 16 16

The Christ, the Son of God for ever blessed.
Simon (said he) thou 'rt happy; for to thee Mat. 16 17

My Father has revealed this mystery. Rev. 21. 19. Joh. 20. 21. 1 Cor. 2. 8.
Eth. 2. 20. Is 22. 22.

Peter thou art a solid cornerstone, Mat. 16 18

For me to rear my future Church upon,
Next unto me, shall ye so strongly arm it,
That hellish force, and fraud shall never harm it.
Whatever you my stewards here shall do, Mat. 16 19

The same is ratified in Heaven too.
But publish yet to no man, what I am: Mat. 16 20
Mar. 8 30
Luke 9 21

[Lest it obstruct the end for which I cam'.]
For suffer at Jerusalem I must, Mat. 16 21
Mar. 8 31
Luke 9 22

And leave (within three days) my fun'ral-dust.
Nay, save thy self from bitter death (said Peter) Mat. 16 22
Mar. 8 32

For life is certainly a great deal sweeter.
Get thee behind my back (said Jesus then) Mat. 16 23
Mar. 8 33

Thou adversary both to God and men:
For to my sight thou art a sore offense,
Because thou judge all by humane sense.
It Is for the life of men: and ^o all they Mat. 16 24
Mar. 8 34
Luke 9 23

That follow me, must follow me this way.
Choose life, you will see it is only death ye choose: Mat. 16 25
Mar. 8 35
Luke 9 24

Lose life for me, your life ye shall not lose.
What if the present-pleasant world ye gain, Mat. 16 26
Mar. 8 36
Luke 9 25

And lose your souls in everlasting pain? Mar. 8 37

Disown me now, and I shall you disown, Mat. 16 27
Mar. 8 38
Luke 9 26

When seated on my great judicial throne.
Which (in a figure) some that here do stand, Mat. 16 28
Mar. 9 1
Luke 9 27

Shall see accomplished on this stubborn Land.
9.
Next week the Lord a lofty hill ascended, Mat. 17 1
Mar. 9 2
Luke 9 28

With none but Peter, James and John attended.
And as he prayed, before his prayer was done, Mat. 17 2
Mar. 9 3
Luke 9 29

Both he and's raiment shined like the Sun.
Then Mo^^s and Elias also came Mat. 17 3
Mar. 9 4
Luke 9 30

(Whose glory far out-shone the brightest flame)
And there with him discoursed [to hearten them] Luke 9 31

About his suffering at Jerusalem,
[And of his kingdom, and the dreadful day, Luke 9 32

Wherein he should his enemies repay.]
And as they were departing, Peter said, Mat. 17 4
Mar. 9 5
Luke 9 33

'Twere good for u^, if here we always staid.
We Will make (Sir) if the motion pleases thee, Mar. 9 6

Three shady Tabernacles for you three.
But while he spoke at random, there appeared Mat. 17 5
Mar. 9 7
Luke 9 34

A glittering cloud, which made them all afear'd.
And those two Prophets in that booth so bright
Were shadowed from their almost-dazled sight.
And then this voice did God the Father send, Luke 9 35

To this my well-beloved Son attend.
Which threw them all upon their faces flat, Mat. 17 6

Affrighted and astonished thereat.
Then Jesus came and touched them, and said, Mat. 17 7

Stand up all three, and be no more afraid.
They 'rose, and looking up, espied no more Mat. 17 8
Mar. 9 8
Luke 9 36

But Jesus barely, as he was before.
Who strictly charged them to conceal from men Mat. 17 9
Mar. 9 9

What now they saw, until he 'rose again.
They all obeyed, but hardly apprehended Mar. 9 10

What this same rising from the dead intended.
And as they were descending from the Hill,
They told him how they had a scruple still:
Why do the Scribes reject what we have heard Mat. 17 10
Mar. 9 11

(Said they) till first Elias has appeared? Mal. 4. 5.

That prophecy (said he) is very true: Mat. 17 11
Mar. 9 12

Elias came and went, before they knew. Mat. 17 12
Mar. 9 13

Whilst here he was, they used him at their pleasure:
And so must I receive the same hard measure.
They then perceived his meaning: for the aptest 1 King. 19. 10.
Mat. 17 13

To represent Elias, was the Baptist.
10.
Coming next day to the other nine, he found them Mat. 17 14
Mar. 9 14
Luke 9 37

With Scribes and many other people round them.
But seeing Jesus, unto Him they ran, Mar. 9 15

And kindly to salute him they began.
Ye busy Scribes (said Jesus) what is the thing, Mar. 9 16

Which has occasioned all this reasoning?
Master (said one among them) here I come Mat. 17 15
Mar. 9 17
Luke 9 38

And bring my only child both deaf and dumb.
For every Moon the Devil thus torments him, Mar. 9 18
Luke 9 39

And makes him foam, and fret, and fume, and rents him.
I came to thy Disciples for redress: Mat. 17 16
Luke 9 40

The raging fiend they cannot dispossess.
O faithless men (said he) how long must ye Mat. 17 17
Mar. 9 19
Luke 9 41

Be born withal? go, bring the Lad to me.
The Lad was brought, and seeing Christ before him, Mar. 9 20
Luke 9 42

The Devil threw him on the ground and tore him.
Christ asked him when this first befell his Son: Mar. 9 21

He told him, From a very little one.
We often from the fire and water snatch him, Mar. 9 22

Where otherwise the Devil would dispatch him.
But if thou can do any thing (Lord Jesus)
Commiscrate our miseries, and ease us.
I can (said Christ) if thou can but believe: Mar. 9 23

Believe, and thou may any thing atchieve.
And then with tears the man replied in brief, Mar. 9 24

Lord I believe, help thou mine unbelief.
When Jesus saw they thronged him round about Mar. 9 25

To see the end, he cast the Devil out. Mat. 17 18

Thou spirit deafand dumb (said he) resign
For ever that possession there of thine.
He did; but first he roared, and rent him sore: Mar. 9 26

So that for dead the people gave him over.
But Jesus presently restored (or rather Mar. 9 27

Gave) health to him, and him unto his Father.
Then Jesus from the company retired; Mat. 17 19
Mar. 9 28

And those Apostles privately inquired.
Wherefore (although they were so many, yet)
They could not make one filthy fiend submit.
For want (said he) of solid faith: for that Mat. 17 20

(One grain thereof) will lay a mountain flat.
But some are so malicious and so mad, Mat. 17 21
Mar. 9 29

To faith ye must your prayer and fasting add.
11.
Privately thence (when great astonishment Mar. 9 30
Luke 9 43

Had filled that place) through Galilee he went,
Towered Capernaum; telling them again, Mat. 17 22

How He (the Lords Anointed) must be slain: Mar. 9 31
Luke 9 44

And how his own Divinity would raise
His body from the grave within three days. Mat. 17 23

And though in pensive doubts they were involved, Mar. 9 32
Luke 9 45

They durst not speak it out, to be resolved.
12.
At Capernaum Peter was demanded, Ex. 30. 12, 13.
Mat. 17 24

Whether his Master paid (as all the Land did)
The [Temple-] tax. Yes sure (said he) I Will ask.
But Christ spoke first, and eased him of that task. Mat. 17 25

Simon (said Jesus) whom do Kings compel
To pay them tribute, Sons or Strangers? tell.
Strangers (I think) said Peter. Then (said He) Mat. 17 26

I am the [Great] Kings Son, and so am free.
But, no offense: go cast a hook in the water; Mat. 17 27

A fish from thence shall mouth a half-crown-stater.
Give the Receivers that for me and thee:
[My power must supply my poverty.]
13.
Then calling his Disciples he would know, Mar. 9 33

What by the way they argued Con and Pro.
At first they were ashamed to let him hear,
How selfish and ambitious they were: Mar. 9 34

At last they state the Question thus; When Christ Mat. 18 1
Luke 9 46

Is once enthroned, who shall of us be highest?
The highest honor is conferred (said he) Mar. 9 35

On him that has the most humility.
See but this lively Emblem of a Child: Mat. 18 2
Mar. 9 36
Luke 9 47

Except ye be so humble and so mild;
And turn with sorrow from your proud ambition, Mat. 18 3

You are in no Christ-kingdom-like condition.
Resemble these; and he that harbors you, Mat. 18 4
Mar. 9 37
Luke 9 48

Both harbors me and him that sent me too. -- Mat. 18 5

Here he was interrupted now by John: Mar. 9 38
Luke 9 49

We saw a man (said he) not long agone
Cast Devils out in Jesus' Name, and we
Forbad him, 'cause he does not follow thee.
No man can easily (said Jesus) carry Mar. 9 39
Luke 9 50

Ny name, and yet be thought an adversary.
If neither words nor works against us be, Mar. 9 40

Forbid him not; he is not an enemy.
Then went he on. -- Whosoever in that regard Mar. 9 41

Shall give you drink, shall have a great reward.
But whosoever shall offend or wrong Mat. 18 6
Mar. 9 42

The best of these that unto me belong,
Had better have a mil-stone to him bound, Luke 17 1

And in the deepest of the Sea be drowned.
Scandals will be: but woe to him by whom Mat. 18 7
Luke 17 2

Scandals (in doctrine or example) come.
Right hands and feet and eyes and all condemn, Mat. 18 8
Mar. 9 43

Rather than give the least offense by them. Mat. 18 9

Better come lame, and sing in the winged Quire, Lev. 2. 13.

Than always flame, and yell in hell entire.
There lives remorse, there men are always dying: Mar. 9 44

There fiery salt preserves from putrefying. Mar. 9 45

Which to avoid, the word and spirit must Mar. 9 46

Now purge and purify from every lust. Mar. 9 47

Salt's good; but when the acrimony's gone, Mar. 9 48
Luke 14 34

It Is hardly good enough to tread upon. Mar. 9 49
Luke 14 35

So it is with you: be savoury, be wise; Mar. 9 50

And do n't ye peck out one another eyes.
The Angel of the poorest Saint beholds Mat. 18 10

The face of Him who all the world controlls:
[Who gives his Angels charge to succor those
That are oppressed, and suppress their foes.]
I came to seek and in the way to guide Mat. 18 11

Those wandering sheep that long have gone aside.
One in a hundred being lost and found Mat. 18 12

Creates more joy than all the safe and sound. Mat. 18 13

So it is our Fathers will, that we should cherish Mat. 18 14

The weakest in the flock, that none may perish.
But if thou feast thy Brother in transgression, Mat. 18 15
Luke 17 3

Reclaim him by a private admonition.
If he persist, take one or two beside: Mat. 18 16

If still, then let the Church be certifi'd.
And if he will not hear the Churches sense, Mat. 18 17

Let him be excommunicated thence.
Say what they shall, or what they shall not do; Mat. 18 18

That shall be loosed or bound in heaven too. Rev. 3. 7. Is. 22. 22.

I make you stewards by this gift of mine
The keys of Doctrine and of Discipline
Agree and pray; my Father will agree Mat. 18 19

To answer those demands of two or three:
Where e're they meet according to my will Mat. 18 20

And in my Name, there I am with them still.
How often at faults (said Peter) must I wink? Mat. 18 21
Luke 17 4

To pardon seven is enough I think.
Seven! (said he) yea seaventy times by seven Mat. 18 22

He that repents is to be forgiven.
A Monarch called his servants to account: Mat. 18 23

The debts of one to a million did amount: Mat. 18 24

And when he could not pay, He gave command, Mat. 18 25

To selze upon his body, house, and land.
But humbling of himself he 'scap'd: and met Mat. 18 26

A fellow servants owing him a debt Mat. 18 27

Of fifty shillings; took him by the throat, Mat. 18 28

Exacting present payment to a groat.
Having it not, he threw him into jail: Mat. 18 29

His humbling of himself could naught prevail. Mat. 18 30

The other servants seeing this disaster, Mat. 18 31

Were sorry for it, and went and told their Master: Mat. 18 32

Who sending for him ratled him for's pains; Mat. 18 33

And resecur'd him in his former chains. Mat. 18 34

So likewise shall my heavenly Father do, Mat. 18 35
Luke 17 4

If ye forgive not those that injure you.
The Apostles [thinking they were overcharged] Luke 17 5

Desired that their faith might be enlarged.
True faith (said he) but like a mustard-grain Luke 17 6

Would plant these Sycomores within the main.
But as a servant sits not down to meat, Luke 17 7

When just his work is done (though never so great)
Till first he serve his Master, who (I wiss) Luke 17 8

Is not beholden to his man for this: Luke 17 9

So when y' have done whatever God commands, Luke 17 10

Know that ye merit nothing at his hands.
14.
The feast of Tabernacles being at hand, Lev. 23. 34.
Joh. 7 2

His Brethren (who believed not) demand,
Whether he would not let his works appear Joh. 7 3

In Jury, to his new disciples there.
There Is none (say they) who fame and honor drive an Joh. 7 4

Affect (like thee) to be so very private. Joh. 7 5

You may (said he) go when you will; but I Joh. 7 6

Expose my self not yet so publicly. Joh. 7 7

You're safe enough, because you are beloved: Joh. 7 8

Me the world hates, because by me reproved. Joh. 7 9

15.
When they were gone, then Jesus followed them Joh. 7 10

(But privately) toward Jerusalem.
(This happened out, before he suster'd there, Luke 9 51

But very little more than half a year.)
And passing through Samaria, in his name Luke 9 52

Some w^n^ to get things ready e're he came.
But the first town refused to harbor them, Luke 9 53

Because they worshipd at Jerusalem.
Then John and James would fain have called down 2 King 1 10.
Luke 9 54

Elijahs flames, to burn the spiteful town.
But turning back He sharply did reprove them, Luke 9 55

Because a spirit of revenge did move them.
I came to save (said he) and not to slay Luke 9 56

So towered another town they went their way.
16.
One Scribe his service freely did present, Mat. 8 19
Luke 9 57

And said he would follow him, where e're he went.
[Wilt thou indeed (said Jesus) follow me? Mat. 8 20
Luke 9 58

Consider first my great necessity.]
Foxes have holes, and every bird a nest:
I have not whereupon to take my rest.
He called another, who replied, I crave Mat. 8 21
Luke 9 59

But leave to see my Father first in's grave.
Men dead in trespasses and sins (said He) Mat. 8 22
Luke 9 60

May bury carcasses; come follow me.
Another asked his leave to go first home Luke 9 61

And bid them there farewell, and then he would come.
Balk that (said Christ) your plow will run awry, Luke 9 62

If back you look at every thing you spy.
17.
Here He chose seaventy Disciples, whom Luke 9 1

He sent by twos, where he himself should come.
[Such were their Orders, as were issued out
To the other twelve, when they were sent about.]
The crop is great (said He) and it is as true, Luke 9 2

That faithful, skilful workmen are as few.
But pray to God that he would send abroad
Laborers void of folly and of fraud.
Like Lambs among the greedy Wolves I send you: Luke 9 3

Go, let your prudent innocence defend you. 2 King. 4. 29.

Go as you are: let not your work be hindered Luke 9 4

By visiting acquaintance or your kindred.
Whatever house ye enter, wish it peace; Luke 9 5

Wish that prosperity may there increase.
If it deserves peace, peace shall remain: Luke 9 6

If not, it shall return to you again.
Go not from house to house: stay, drink and eat Luke 9 7

Such as they give; your work is worthy your meat. Luke 9 8

Heall all distempers that ye light upon: Luke 9 9

And tell them that Christ's Kingdom is begun.
If any town your words or you disgust; Luke 9 10

Witness against them, shaking off their dust Luke 9 11

And in the Judgment-day shall they have sorrow Luke 10 12

Exceeding that of Sodon and Gomorrah.
Woe to Cho^azin, to Bethsaida woe! Luke 10 13

For Tire and Sidon would have long ago
Themselves in sackcloth humbled, had they been
Sspectators of the things which ye have seen.
I tell you therefore, in the judgment-day Luke 10 14

A greater doom shall you receive than they.
In wonders Capernaum does excel: Luke 10 15

Neglect of them will thrust her down to hell.
He that receives, or despises you, Luke 10 16

Does so to me, and him that sent me too.
18.
Now at the feast the Jews were very busy Joh. 7 11

Enquiring after him, and said, Where is he?
Their murmuring concerning him was great: Joh. 7 12

Some called him an Impostour and a cheat;
He Is honest (others said) that is out of doubt, Joh. 7 13

But (for the Jew^) they durst not speak it out.
About the middle of the feast he went Joh. 7 14

And taught at Church, to their astonishment.
Where had he this? (said they) it is known to all, Joh. 7 15

His education has been rustical.
Jesus replied, This is not mine, but rather Deuteronomy. 18. 18.
Joh. 7 16

Communicated to me of my father.
If any man will do his will, he will know, Joh. 7 17

If this my Doctrine be of God or no.
His Glory it is, the which I aim at still; Joh. 7 18

And therefore it is according to his will.
The Law is not by one of you fulfilled: Joh. 7 19

Why therefore do ye seek to have me killed?
Who seeks to have thee killed? thou 'rt mad (said they.) Joh. 5. 16. Genesis 21 4.
Joh. 7 20

But he went on with what he had to say.
Well may you my [Bethesda] work admire: Joh. 7 21

But must it also thus provoke your ire?
Your circumcising [and chyrurg'ry] is Lev. 12. 3.
Joh. 7 22

A far more servile kind of work than this.
Now if the Sabbath yield to Moses (though Joh. 7 23

That Law's a great deal antienter than so)
Why then should I be blamed for making whole
(With but a word) his body and his soul?
Judge right'ous judgment, both the deeds compare. Joh. 7 24

And you will be then less partial than you are.
Then some of the Townsmen said, Is this not he Joh. 7 25

They seek to kill, that speaks thus openly
And uncontrolled? Or do the Rulers know, Joh. 7 26

That he is indeed the Christ? that cannot be so.
For we know whence He comes, and of whom: Is. 53 8. Heb 7. 3.
Joh. 7 27

But who can tell from whence the Christ shall come?
Jesus replied, Ye know me and my home; Joh. 7 28

Although ye know not Him from whence I come.
But I both know him, and of Him am known; Joh. 7 29

For I and He that sent me are but one. Joh. 7 30

Then many men believed, and said, they thought Joh. 7 31

More miracles by Christ could never be wrought.
Which greatly did enrage the Sanbedrim; Joh. 7 32

Who therefore sent to have apprehended him.
Yet Heavens Council would not suffer it,
Because his time to suffer was not yet.
Yet but a little while (said he) and then Joh. 7 33

To him that sent me I return again.
Then ye may seek me, but shall never find me, Joh. 7 34

For I shall go, and leave you all behind me.
Then said the Jews, How strangely this man speaks! Joh. 7 35

Will he go teach the scattered heathen Greeks?
Where can he go, that we shall never find him? Lev. 23. 36.
Joh. 7 36

Where can he go, and leave us all behind him?
19.
Now on the eighth and greatest day [when water Joh. 7 37

Was poured solemnly upon the altar]
Then Jesus cried, All ye that are a dry,
Come unto me, your thirst to satisfy. Is. 55 1. 44. 3.

From those that trust in me (as all may read) Joh. 7 38

Rivers of living water shall proceed.
He meant the Effusion of the Holy Ghost, Jo^l 2. 28. Deuteronomy. 18. 18.
Joh. 7 39

From him (their Crowned Head) at Pentecost.
And many now consid'ring how he taught, Joh. 7 40

Confessed he was that Prophet, as they thought.
Some said, This is the Christ: but other some, Joh. 7 41

Christ must of David and from Bethl'^m come. Joh. 7 42

Thus they contend; some striving to defend him, Joh. 7 43

While others would (but could not) apprehend him. Joh. 7 44

The Sergeants being by the Sanhedrim Joh. 7 45

Demanded why they had not taken him,
Replied, like him we never heard one speak. Joh. 7 46

Are you deceived (said they) are you so weak? Joh. 7 47

Which of the Grands believe him to be true? Joh. 7 48

None but an ignorant and cursed crew. Joh. 7 49

But whom (said Nicodemus, one of them) Joh. 7 50

Whom does our Law (before he is heard) condemn? Joh. 7 51

Art thou (said they) a Galilean? see, Joh. 8 52

No Prophet rises out of Galilee.
And when some time in this debate was spent, Joh. 8 53

They 'rose and to their several houses went.
20.
Jesus retired to Olive-hill that night; Joh. 8 1

But came again so soon as ever 'twas light: Joh. 8 2

And in the Temple taking up his seat,
He fed the people with spiritual meat.
Then by the Scribes and Pharisees was brought Joh. 8 3

A woman in the act of lewdness caught.
Master (said they) the Law commands us Lev. 2^. 10. Deuteronomy. 22. 23. Jer. 17.
13 Deuteronomy. 17. 7.
Joh. 8 4

To stone to death all women taken thus:
But what sai'st thou? (to see if he 'ld entrench Joh. 8 5

On Moses, or on their Judici'al Bench.)
He stooping down spoild that dilemma-plot, Joh. 8 6

Wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.
And when they urged him, he replied, begin Joh. 8 7

To stone the woman, you that have no sin.
Again he stoopd and wrote upon the ground, Joh. 8 8

Till not a man remained to be found.
A guilty conscience scared them every one, Joh. 8 9

And made them leave the Lord and her alone.
But where (said He) be thine accusers, woman? Joh. 8 10

Has no man judged thee? She answered, no man. Joh. 8 11

Neither do I; but yet thou must turn over
Another leaf (said He) and sin no more.
21.
The same bright morning Jesus did profess Joh. 8 12

Himself to be the Sun of Righte'ousness.
I am (said he) the Light of the world: I shine
With ever-living light upon all mine.
This record of thy self (said they) is false: Joh. 8 13

False he must be, whoever himself exalts.
I know (said he) my record to be true: Joh. 8 14

Though my Original's unknown to you.
You judge according to the flesh, I know: Joh. 8 15

But I judge no man [or at least not so.]
Yet if I did, my judgment would be true; Deuteronomy. 17. 6.
Joh. 8 16

For He that sent me and my self are two:
And that is allowed by Law. My Fathers word Joh. 8 17

With this my testimony does accord. Joh. 8 18

Where is He? said the Jews. Why, Him (said he) Joh. 8 19

Ye do not know, because ye know not me.
These things he published in the Treasury: Joh. 8 20

Still Providence maintained his liberty.)
I go (said he) where you shall never find me: Joh. 8 21

Die in your sins: I leave you all behind me.
What, will he kill himself (said they) to avoid Joh. 8 22

His being by our Governors destroyed?
I go (said he) from whence I came at first: Joh. 8 23

As you to the earth, whereof you are born and nursed.
And (as I said but now) ly down ye must Joh. 8 24

In all your sins, without believing first.
Who art thou that we may believe? said they. Joh. 8 25

What first I said (said he) the same I say. Joh. 8 26

Much more I have to say concerning you:
And he that gave me my Commission's true. Joh. 8 27

Ye do not know of whom I speak as yet:
But when you have slain me, you will remember it. Joh. 8 28

And then ye shall acknowledge that I came
Not in my own, but in my Fathers Name: Joh. 8 29

Who never leaves me, but is with me still;
Because I take delight to do his will. Joh. 8 30

Which words with such an efficacy came,
Many professed their faith upon his Name. Joh. 8 31

To whom he said, And if ye thus continue,
A true Discipleship is rooted in you. Joh. 8 32

Ye shall both know the Truth, and also see,
The Truth it self shall make you truly free. Joh. 8 33

Free! (said the other) we are slaves to no man.
[Forgetting their subjection to the Roman.]
Yes, you are slaves to sin (said he) and must Joh. 8 34

Out of Gods family (ever long) be thrust; Joh. 8 35

Where I am ever: if ye were but freed Joh. 8 36

By me the Son and Heir, you're free indeed.
Your birthright will but little good afford, Joh. 8 37

Which thus ye hate my Person and my word;
Yet not my own, but great Jehovahs rather: Joh. 8 38

As ye likewise do imitate your Father.
You say you are Abrams Sons; but were it true, Joh. 8 39

The works that Abram did, would come from you.
For Abram never would have sought to kill Joh. 8 40

A man that speaks the God of Abrams will.
In vain ye cry, The Temple of the Lord, Joh. 8 41

And call your selves his Sons, while I Am abhord.
If He your Father were, then would ye love Joh. 8 42

Whom He has sent amongst you from above*
No wonder that ye cannot understand, Joh. 8 43

While passion thus and malice do command.
The Devil is your Father and Commander; Joh. 8 44

Ye follow him in murder, lying, slander.
What is my crime? Why am I not received? Joh. 8 45

Because I speak the truth, I Am not believed. Joh. 8 46

Heinous perverseness! but the reason is, Joh. 8 47

God is not yours and you are none of his.
Say we not well (said they) Thou art an evil Joh. 8 48

Samaritan possessed with a Devil?
Not so (said Christ) I honor God: and ye Joh. 8 49

(By that reproach) do much dishonor me.
I seek my self in nothing that I say: Joh. 8 50

God will avenge himself another day.
-- My word (I say) shall make my servants free; Joh. 8 51

So free that they no death shall ever see.
Nay now (said they) we know thou 'rt clearly mad: Joh. 8 52

Such privilege great Abram never had.
And if the greatest Prophets were not free, Joh. 8 53

Whom do thou proudly make thy self to be?
My self (said he) I honor not, but He Joh. 8 54

Whom you do call your God, he honors me.
You but pretend to know him, though I do: Joh. 8 55

Else I should be a liar, like to you.
I do both know him, and do him obey. Gen 22. 18
Joh. 8 56

Your Father Abram joy'd to see my day.
Thou 'rt young (said they) have thou seen Abraham Joh. 8 57

Yea long (said he) e're Abram was, I am.
Then they'ld have stoned him for his blasphemy: Joh. 8 58

But through them all he past invisibly. Joh. 8 59

22.
And as he went along, he saw a man Joh. 8 1

Who never saw, since first his life began.
Was this man's sin the cause of this (said some) Joh. 8 2

Or did that blindness from his parents come?
Neither from him nor them (said he) but God, Joh. 8 3

To spread his glorious power all abroad.
And I must work the works of him that sent me, Joh. 8 4

Before the approaching night of death prevent me.
And by restering of corpor'al sight, Joh. 8 5

Show that I am the worlds spirit'al light.
Then spitting on the ground he made a clay, Is 8 6. Gen 49. 1^. Neh. 3. 15.
Joh. 8 6

'Nointed his eyes, and sent the man away.
Go wash thy face in Siloam (said he:) Joh. 8 7

He went and washed, and very well could see. Joh. 8 8

The people wondered (which before did know him) Joh. 8 9

To see his sight so soon restored to him. Joh. 8 10

And when they asked, he told them how 'twas done: Joh. 9 11

But could not tell them whither Christ was gone. Joh. 9 12

Then to the Council led they him away: Joh. 9 13

Because 'twas done upon the Sabbath day. Joh. 9 14

And being there examined, he declared,
Who 'nointed him with clay, and how he fared. Joh. 9 15

He breaks the Sabbath (said the Pharisees:)
Some said, Can sinners do such things as these? Joh. 9 16

They asked the man, what he himself thought of it:
Why, certainly (said he) the man's a Prophet. Joh. 9 17

But they would scarce believe he had been blind,
Till they had sent to know his Parents mind. Joh. 9 18

Who came and said, This is indeed our Son,
And eyes he had (when first he breathed) none. Joh. 9 19

He sees at present, but we know not how: Joh. 9 20

Ask him; a tongue he has, and years enough. Joh. 9 21

And this they left to be by him related,
For fear they should be excommunicated. Joh. 9 22

For such a punishment they had appointed
For all who said that Jesus was the Anointed. Joh. 9 23

Then said they to the man, give God the praise,
This Man prophanes the holy Sabbath days. Joh. 9 24

That is a thing I cannot tell (said he)
Once was I blind, and now (I Am sure) I see. Josh. 7. 19.
Joh. 9 25

But how? said they: Come truly tell the story, Joh. 9 26

And let the God of truth have all the glory.
Me thought (said he) I told you very plain: Joh. 9 27

If you would be his Disciples, hear't again.
How sawcily (said they) do thou oppose us! Joh. 9 28

Thou 'rt one of his, we all belong to Moses.
Moses (we know) spoke with Him face to face: Joh. 9 29

But this man comes, we know not from what place.
That Is very strange (said he) you should not tell Joh. 9 30

from whence he is, that made me see so well.
God hears not sinners; but if any fear Joh. 9 31

And serve the Lord, such men the Lord will hear.
Can you in any antic record find, Joh. 9 32

That sight was given to a man born blind?
And were he not approved of God (I wiss) Joh. 9 33

He could do no such miracle as this.
Will thou teach us (said they) who thus were born? Act. 7. 58. 13. 50.
Joh. 9 34

And so they had him hurried out with scorn.
23.
Then Jesus asked him (finding him abroad) Joh. 9 35

If he believed upon the Son of God.
Who is it Sir (said he) that so I may? Joh. 10 36

It Is I (said Christ) who cured thee the other day. Joh. 10 37

Lord I believe, said he; and did adore him Joh. 10 38

(As God incarnate) falling down before him.
And Jesus said, For judgment am I come; Joh. 10 39

Some to enlighten, to occecate some:
That they who see their blindness, may have sight;
And they who think they see, be blinded quite.
With that the Pharisees (that stood behind) Joh. 10 40

Demanded whether they were also blind.
Were ye (said he) or fools or blind indeed, Joh. 10 41

Of much sin-guiltiness ye would be freed:
This self-conceitedness of your condition
Makes you despise the only Soul-Physician.
Blind leaders of the blind! yea thieves are they, Zach. 11. 15, 16.
Joh. 10 1

That clamber into the fold in such a way.
The proper Shepherd enters at the door, Joh. 10 2

When opened by the Porter; not before. Joh. 10 3

His sheep by name he can distinctly call: Joh. 10 4

Such is his care and knowledge of them all.
He leads them forth, and goes before them still; Joh. 10 5

Still they observe the conduct of his will.
His voice they know; but they dis own the tongue Joh. 10 6

Of any stranger, that would lead them wrong.
When Jesus saw they thought his words but vain Joh. 10 7

And understood them not, he spoke more plain.
I am the way to life, I am the door. Joh. 10 8

Which none but Robbers could pretend before.
Robbers they were, whom Providence did keep Joh. 10 9

From utterly seducing of my sheep.
They that come in by me, shun all disasters; Joh. 10 10

They come and go, and find refreshing pastures.
Thieves come to kill and steal; I come to save, Joh. 10 11

And that my sheep eternal life might have. Ezekiel. 34 ^3.

I am the faithful Shepherd: for their good Joh. 10 12

I shall not spare to spend my dearest blood.
The Hireling, when the wolf appears, is gone: Joh. 10 13

The flock go where it will, so he save one.
He flies, because the sheep are none of's own: Joh. 10 14

But I and mine are mutually known:
As we our selves are known (the Lord and I:) Joh. 10 15

So do I know the sheep, for whom I die.
(And sheep I have, not yet of this same fold: Joh. 10 16

But one shall both the Jew and Gentile hold.
My Father does account my dying thus
Acceptable and meritorious. Joh. 10 17

Freely I die, no man does me constrain:
Free leave I have to take my life again. Joh. 10 18

Then said the Jews, This man's possessed and mad;
And they that hearken to him are as bad. Joh. 10 19

No, no (said others) that can never be:
Can any Devil make a blind man see? Joh. 10 20
Joh. 10 21

24.
The seav'nty (being now returned) declare, Luke 10 17

How they had soild the Princes of the air. Ephesians. 6. 12. Jude 6.

Yes, yes (said he) I saw those fiends accursed Luke 10 18

(Like lightning) dropping, as they did at first.
Against the stings of Scorpions I arm you: Luke 10 19

Not all the Serpents enmity shall harm you.
But cease your carnal joy: rejoice in this, Luke 10 20

That you are heirs of everlasting bliss.
I thank thee Father (Lord of Heaven and Earth) Mat. 11. 25.
Luke 10 21

That slightest men of parts and noble birth,
And do these mysteries to Babes reveal:
Because it is thy pleasure thus to deal.
Thou have delivered all things unto me; Luke 10 22

And I am [fully] known to none but thee:
So is thy Glorious Person [else] conceald, Luke 10 23

To me alone and through me reveald.
Oh my Disciples, you that hear and see Luke 10 24

Such things as these, how happy must ye be!
Great Kings and Prophets would have seen these things:
These things were hid from Prophets and great Kings.
25.
Then came a certain Lawyer, and would know, Luke 10 25

By what good deeds he might to Heaven go.
And Jesus sent him to the Legal Glass, Lev. 19. 18. Deuteronomy. 6. 5.
Luke 10 26

To represent and 'lay his swollen face:
Love God with all thy heart, soul, strength and mind; Luke 10 27

And to thy Neighbor (as thy self) be kind. Luke 10 28

He (justifying of himself) demands, Luke 10 29

Whom He by that word Neighbor understands.
A certain Jew (said Jesus) traveled, Luke 10 30

Was robbed and stripped, left wounded and half dead.
And as a certain Priest by chance came by, Luke 10 31

He looked upon the man, and let him ly.
A Levite likewise came; and when he spied him, Luke 10 32

In scornful manner also past beside him.
But a Samaritan (who past that way) Luke 10 33

He had compassion on him as he lay;
He dressed his wounds, and took him up behind him, Luke 11 34

Brought him to the Inn, and bad the Landlord mind him: Luke 11 35

He (the next day) discharged the house, and said,
If any more be spent, I Will see you paid.
Which of these three concerned (think thou) Luke 11 36

Was neighbor unto this poor fellow now?
He (said the Doctor) that relieved the man. Luke 11 37

Do thou (said Christ) like that Samaritan.
26.
Now Martha (for her Savior) made a feast, Luke 11 38

And took much care and pains to have it dressed.
But Mary sat and hearkn'd to his Word: Luke 11 39

At which the other was a little stirred;
And would have had him very fain dismissed her: Luke 11 40

Sir, must I toil (said she) without my sister?
Ah Martha, Martha (Jesus answered) Mat. 23. 23.
Luke 11 41

Too too much earthly business fills thy head.
One thing is absolutely necessary: Luke 11 42

Mary chose that, and that shall stick by Mary.
27.
Another time a Pharisee requests Luke 11 37

His company, among some other guests:
Who counted it an irreligious fashion, Luke 11 38

For him to sit without a previous washing.
You Pharisees (said Jesus) cleanse the outside, Luke 11 39

And leave your wicked inwards putrified:
While he that made both soul and body, does Luke 11 40

Look to be duly sanctified in both.
And if you would have him sanctify to you Luke 11 41

What ye enjoy, to poor men pity show. Luke 11 1

Then he reproved their Superstition, Pride,
Hypocrisy, and many things beside:
So netling them, that they (with all their force Luke 11 53

Of critic questions) urged him to discourse.
To try if they could any way abuse him, Luke 11 54

Or catch a word that might afford to accuse him.
28.
Beware (said he, amidst the trampling crowd) Luke 11 1

Beware of Pharisees so sour and proud.
For their concealed hypocrisy and fraud Mat. 10 27.
Luke 11 2

Shall be reveald' and one day come abroad.
Master (said one) I pray persuade my Brother, Luke 11 13

That we may part the Estate with one another.
Thou man (said Jesus) what have I to do Luke 11 14

To turn Estate-divider over you?
Take special heed of earthly-mindedness: Luke 11 15

Man's life lies not in what he does possess.
A rich man's ground brought forth of every sort Luke 12 16

So much, he had no further stowage for it.
But I know what I Will do (said he) I Will change Luke 12 17
Luke 12 18

My scanty barn, and make it a stately Grange.
I Will laugh and quaffe, I Will eat and drink of the best: Luke 12 19

My soul shall roll and rock herself to rest.
Thou fool (said God) this night thy soul must go: Luke 12 20

Then whose are all those treasures, do thou know?
Just so is he that heaps up earthly store, Luke 12 21

But in good works and faith remains poor.
29.
Another time was Jesus advertised, Act. 5. 37.
Luke 12 1

How some were slaughtered as they sacrificed.
Think ye (said he) because they suffered so, Luke 12 2

That they were sinners above others? no:
Except repentance wash away your guilt,
Your blood (like theirs) by Romans will be spilt. Luke 12 3

Or think ye those on whom the tower fell, Luke 12 4

The worst that in Jerusalem did dwell?
No: but if still impenitence ye cherish, Luke 12 5

With greater ruin ye shall all so perish.
A certain man (said he) a Fig Tree planted, Luke 12 6

And still he looked for what the Fig Tree wanted.
These three whole years (said he) no fruit is found: Luke 12 7

Come, cut it down; why cumbreth it the ground?
Sir (said the Gardener) let me try to cure it: Luke 12 8

Spare it this year; I Will every way manure it.
And then, if (after all my pains) it bear not, Luke 12 9

With all my heart (Sir) cut it down and spare not.
30.
And as He taught upon a Sabbath day, Luke 12 10

There was a certain woman in his way,
Whom Satan had for eighteen winters bound, Luke 12 11

So that she always stooped towered the ground.
Upon this woman Jesus laid his hands, Luke 12 12

And told her she was eased of her bands.
So up she stood, and praised God: but this Luke 12 13

Raised in the Rulers mind a prejudice.
Look out (said he) on working-days for cure; Luke 12 14

Who can this Sabbath-breaking thus endure?
Thou hypocrite (said Christ) do n't you unty Luke 12 15

Your cattle on this day, when they are adry?
And must not Abrams Daughter be releast, Luke 12 16

Whom Satan's malice has so long oppressed?
Then were his foes ashamed, and all the people Luke 12 17

Rejoiced at his healing of the Creeple.
31.
Now at the feast of Temple-Dedication 1 Marc. 4 59. Act. 3. 11.
Luke 13 22
Joh. 10 22

After Antiochus his Profanation,
(Which Maccabeus caused them to remember
About the middle of the month December)
He walked in the place, whose shape and name Joh. 10 23

From Solomon's once-famous Cloister came.
Then said the Jews (surrounding him about) Joh. 10 24

Art thou the Christ? How long dost' make us doubt?
I told you that (said he) but all in vain: Joh. 10 25

My miracles have spoken very plain.
But ye believe not (as ye have been told) Joh. 10 26

Because ye are not of my chosen fold.
I know my sheep; they hear and follow me: Joh. 10 27

Them will I keep to all eternity. Joh. 10 28

He gave me them, who all the world commands; Joh. 10 29

And none can pluck them from my Fathers hands.
So neither out of mine; for we are one: Joh. 10 30

One is the being of Father and of Son.
Then took the Jews up stones again, to stone him. Joh. 10 31

And Jesus asked them, why they fell upon him Joh. 10 32

With so much fury and ingratitude,
For all the works of goodness he had showed.
Goodness? said they; for blasphemy we stone thee: Ps 82. 6. 97. 7. Heb. 1 6.
Joh. 10 33

Dost' think that for a God we mean to own thee?
Your Law (said Christ) which cannot be denied, Joh. 10 34

Has Magistrates and judges deify'd;
As Representers of his Majesty, Joh. 10 35

Whose Son ye falsely charge with blasphemy.
Him has the Father sanctified, and sent, Joh. 10 36

To work these works to your astonishment.
And if divine they are not, do n't receive me; Joh. 10 37

But if they are, for them ye must believe me:
That I am in the Father, and that He Joh. 10 38

As well exists essentially in me.
Then would they fain have taken him again, Joh. 10 39

But their endeavors proved all but vain.
From thence he went, where John at first baptized; Joh. 10 40

And where his presence was more highly prized.
For they that came to see him, said, Though John Joh. 10 41

Showed not a miracle to any one;
Yet all that John foretold of him, was true. Joh. 10 42

And there he gained Disciples, not a few.
32.
Then was he askd by one [too curious] Luke 13 23

If they that should be saved, were numerous.
Strive you (said he) to enter at the gate, Luke 13 24

Which many men will try, and find too strait.
When once the gate is shut, ye there may stand; Luke 13 25

The Master will admit you at no hand.
In vain you 'l plead, With thee we drank and ate, Luke 13 26

We heard thee early and we heard thee late.
I know you not (he 'l say) depart from me, Luke 13 27

Depart ye workers of iniquity.
Go and ly down in your self-kindled sparks; Luke 13 28

Pine at the Crown of blessed Patriarks.
Repine, to see the Heathens here in glory; Luke 13 29

Though aliens once, yet now preferred before y' Luke 13 30

33.
Then come the Pharisees to Christ, and will him Luke 13 31

Thence to depart, or Herod else would kill him.
Go tell that Fox (said he) my works must last, Luke 13 32

Until a little longer time is past.
Without Jerusalem I cannot die: Luke 13 33

Only Jerusalem can Prophets try.
Alas Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Mat. 23 37
Luke 13 34

That killest Prophets, and abusest them!
How often would my wings have sheltered thee. Mat. 23 38

How often has thy pride rejected me? Mar. 11. 9, 10.

Now remain desolate: never see me more, Mat. 23 39
Luke 13 35

Till ye pronounce me blessed, over and over.
34.
One Sabbath day a noted Pharisee Luke 14 1

At dinner did request his company:
Where he was narrowly observed by all, Luke 14 2

What he would do to one hydropical.
Lawyers and Pharisees (said Jesus) may Luke 14 3

A man be cured on the Sabbath Day,
And when he saw they knew not what to say; Luke 14 4

He took, and heald, and sent the man away.
Who has a beast (said Jesus) in a pit, Luke 14 5

And will not (on this day) deliver it?
But all the Pharisees and Lawyers sat' Luke 14 6

Without returning any thing to that.
Then he observed, and checked them to their faces, Luke 14 7

For their aspiring to the chiefest places.
When thou art bidden to a feast (said he) Luke 14 8

Be not ambitious of supremacy:
Least, when thy betters come, thou with disgrace Luke 14 9

Be forced to shuffle to a worser place.
First seat thy self about the lower end, Luke 14 10

And so be made with honor to ascend.
Exalt thy self, and thou 'lt be tumbled down: Luke 14 11

Debase thy self, thou 'lt surely gain renown.
And thou (mine Host) whenever thou make feasts, Luke 14 12

Call not thy friends alone, and wealthy guests;
But those that are in greatest exigence, Luke 14 13

Of whom thou can expect no recompense.
For thy reward Jehovah thou may trust, Luke 14 14

Until the Resurrection of the Just.
Happy (said one that sat and heard all this) Luke 14 15

Happy is he that shall enjoy that bliss.
A certain man (said Jesus) made a feast, Luke 14 16

And (when 'twas ready) sent for every guest.
But they had all some fine excuse at hand. Luke 14 17

One must go see a piece of new-bought land.
Another (by all means) must needs go try Luke 14 18

Some Oxen which he did but lately buy.
A third had got a wedding-feast at home; Luke 14 19

And he (for his part) could not, would not come: Luke 14 20

At this affront the Man began to frown, Luke 14 21

And sent for all the beggars in the town.
And when he had received all the poor, Luke 14 22

And saw that room was left for many more;
He sent for all that every common field, Luke 14 23

Frequented way, or [heathen-]hedge would yield.
Leave not (said he) but press them, till ye gain
As many as my tables will contain.
And now because my kindness is so slighted, Luke 14 24

Give not a bit to those that were invited. Luke 14 1

35.
Then Publicans and sinners all drew near,
This gracious doctrine greedily to hear.
At which the Pharisees did murmur much, Luke 14 2

That he should so familiar be with such.
Therefore to them he thus himself addressed; Luke 14 3

What man is of an hundred sheep possessed, Luke 14 4

And will not leave the ninety nine behind him, Luke 14 5

To look the One that is lost, until he find him?
And then both he himself is glad thereat, Luke 14 6

And calls his neighbors to congratulate.
So heaven joys more atone new penitent, Luke 14 7

Than ninety nine that need not so repent.
So the poor woman which but ten groats had, Luke 14 8

Finding her lost one, was exceeding glad, Luke 14 9

So a new mirth among Gods Sons is bred, Luke 14 10

At the new birth of one was lost and dead.
Once had a certain man two sons in all, Luke 15 11

Whereof the youngest was most prodigal.
This wanton youth to's Father came, and prayed him Luke 15 12

Forth with to let him have his portion paid him.
So he packt up: on travel he was bent; Luke 15 13

Ranting about, till all he had was spent.
Then in that place arose a mighty famine, Luke 15 14

Which made his case unlike to what he cam' in.
So poor he was, that glad was he to join Luke 15 15

Himself to one that set him over his swine.
He Would fain have filld his belly with the stuff Luke 15 16

Which sed the Swine, but could not get enough.
Then coming to himself he said, must I Luke 15 17

Be starved to death within a hungry stie;
When servants in my Fathers house good store Luke 15 18

Have Bread to eat, and can relieve the poor?
I Will go and tell my Father (on my knee) Luke 15 19

Sir, I have sinned against both Heaven and thee,
And am not worthy to be called thy Son; Luke 15 20

Only among thy servants make me one.
But ever he could come near, his Father 'spy'd him, Luke 15 21

Ran and embraced, and knew not how to chide him.
Then said the Son (and fell upon his knee) Luke 15 22

Sir, I have both offended Heaven and thee;
I am not worthy to be called thy Son:
Only among -- Come, come (said he) have done. Luke 15 23

Ho! fetch me down the richest gown and ring; Luke 15 24

Go, kill the half, and let us laugh and sing:
Because I see my Son both safe and sound; Luke 15 25

Once dead and lost, but now alive and found.
Now when the elder Son came home, and heard Luke 15 26

The music and the dancing, he was scared.
And having asked the cause of all that puther, Luke 15 27

And found it was to welcome home his Brother,
He snuft and puffed, and would not see his face; Luke 15 28

Till's Father came t'expostulate the case.
Father (said he) I never had a kid, Luke 15 29

For all the faithful service that I did:
And must the calf be killd and are with Varlets, Luke 15 30

That spend the half of thine Estate with Harlots?
Thou (said his Father) always art with me, Luke 15 31

And I have settled all I have on thee.
I must thy newfound Brother entertain; Luke 15 32

For he was dead, and is alive again. (...)
39.
Then did he by this parable declare Luke 18 1

The effects of constant and of fervent prayer
An unjust Justice (in a certain town) Luke 18 2

Feared neither God, nor any mortal frown.
And a distressed Widow of that place Luke 18 3

Pressed him incessantly to mind her case.
Although (said he) I do not care a straw Luke 18 4

Or for Divine, or any humane law;
Yet does her importunity so dun me, Luke 18 5

That I am forced to take the busness on me. Luke 18 6

And shall not God avenge his own elect, Luke 18 7

Who constant cries toward his throne direct?
He will, although he seemingly delay 'th: Luke 18 8

Which will produce a great defect of faith.
40.
Another Parable he spoke to such Luke 18 9

Who (slighting others) prize themselves too much.
Unto the house of prayer there went (said he) Luke 18 10

Two men, a Publican and Pharisee.
The boasting Pharisee stood praying thus, Luke 18 11

O Lord, I thank thee, that I Am righteous;
I thank thee, that I am no sinful man,
Or like to this extorting Publican.
Twice in the week I fast; my tithes are out of 1 Virg. 8. 41. 42.
Luke 18 12

All I possess, which others make a doubt of.
The other standing in the outward Court Luke 18 13

(To which all kind of people might resort)
With eyes dejected (smiting on his breast)
Humbly begd pardon of his sins confessed*
The former justified himself a miss, Luke 18 14

But God in mercy justified this.
For self-exalters are to be debased,
And self-abasers shall be higher placed.
41.
Then Jesus Jordan cros'd: and all that came Mat. 19 1
Mar. 10 1

He freely taught, and heald their sick and lame. Mat. 19 2

And there the Pharisees demand, if they Mat. 19 3
Mar. 10 2

(For every cause) might put their wives away. Mat. 19 4

Have ye not read how God (said he) first made 'em, Genesis 1 27.

And what a law he published by Adam? Mat. 19 5

They two shall be but one: the man shall leave 2. 24 Deuteronomy. 24. 1.

His Parents, and to her for ever cleave.
Whom therefore God has so together tied, Mat. 19 6

No mortal man can lawfully divide.
Why then (said they) did Moses give command, Mat. 19 7

To give her a Divorcement in her hand?
For your hard-heartedness toward your wives Mat. 19 8

He suffered you (said he) to change your lives.
But they that wed, except the first have bin Mat. 19 9

False to their bed, commit a grievous sin.
She that does any way her mate release,
And weds again, it an adulteress.
If this be so (said his Disciples then) Mat. 19 10

Marriage is inconvenient for men.
All cannot lead a single life (said he) Mat. 19 11

God has not given all that chastity.
Some (yet) by nature, some by art, and some Mat. 19 12
Mar. 10 12

Eunuchs by prayer and abstinence become.
They that are capable of living so,
So to dispose themselves, discreetly do.
42.
Here they brought infants, for the Lord to bless; Genesis 48. 9.
Mat. 19 13
Mar. 10 13
Luke 18 15

Whom the Disciples did at first repress:
Until that Christ (displeased very much) Mar. 10 14
Luke 18 16

Told them his Kingdom did consist of such: Mat. 19 14

And that all others, who intend to see Mar. 10 15
Luke 18 17

That Kingdom, must like little Children be.
Then taking of them up, he blessed them; Mat. 19 15
Mar. 10 16

And so went on toward Jerusalem.
43.
Then ran to him a young and noble man, Mat. 19 16
Mar. 10 17
Luke 18 18

And kneeling at his feet, he thus began;
What shall I do (Good Master) that I may
Obtain a life that never shall decay?
But why (said Jesus) do thou call me good, Mat. 19 17
Mar. 10 18
Luke 18 19

Unless my Deity be understood?
For God alone is truly Good. But never
Break his commands, and thou shall live for ever. Mat. 19 18
Mar. 10 19
Luke 18 20

All murder and adultery eschew;
Let all thy works, let all thy words be true:
Love, honor, help thy Father and thy Mother; Mat. 19 19

Love (like thy self) thy neighbor and thy Brother.
What else (said he?) if this be all (forsooth) Mat. 19 20
Mar. 10 20
Luke 18 21

All these have I observed from my youth.
I pity thee (said Christ) there is one thing more, Mat. 19 21
Mar. 10 21
Luke 18 22

Sell all thou have, and give it to the poor:
Show thy perfection thus: take up the cross;
Come, follow me, and so have gold for dross.
With that the man departed very sad: Mat. 19 22
Mar. 10 22
Luke 18 23

For they were great possessions, which he had.
Children (said he to his Disciples then) Mat. 19 23
Mar. 10 23
Luke 18 24

How far from Heaven are avaritious men! Mar. 10 24

A Camel through a needles eye is driven, Mat. 19 24
Mar. 10 25
Luke 18 25

Before a wealthy man can enter Heaven.
This made them wondrous eager then to know, Mat. 19 25
Mar. 10 26
Luke 18 26

What all that company of men should do.
God can (said he) so change them by his spirit, Mat. 19 26
Mar. 10 27
Luke 18 27

That they may heaven as well as earth inherit.
But we (said Peter) which have disregarded Mat. 19 27
Mar. 10 28
Luke 18 28

All for thy sake, wherewith are we rewarded?
Why, in the Resurrection-day (said he) Mat. 19 28
Luke 22 28

You shall be Judges of the world with me. Luke 22 29

All that for me forsake Estates or friends, Mat. 19 29
Mar. 10 29
Luke 22 30

I will be sure to make them full amends.
My love shall make them (while my cross they bear) Luke 22 29

An hundredfold more happy than they were. Mar. 10 30
Luke 22 30

Their faithful friends shall here be multiplied;
And they shall have eternal life beside.
But many that seem best, will prove the worst; Mat. 19 30
Mar. 10 31

And many that are last, shall then be first.
For so a certain man one morning went Mat. 20 1

And hired certain workmen, whom he sent Mat. 20 2

To dress his Vineyard, when he found them willing Mat. 20 3

To sell him that days labor for a shilling. Mat. 20 4

At nine, twelve, three, and five a clock, he sent Mat. 20 5

Others likewise, and promised them content, Mat. 20 6

At night he came to pay them, and began Mat. 20 7

First with the last; a shilling every man. Mat. 20 8

This made the first expect a little more; Mat. 20 9

But they were paid, as was agreed before. Mat. 20 10

With that they murmured, that one hour's pay Mat. 20 11

Should equal theirs, who labored all the day. Mat. 20 12

Friends (said the man) was not your bargain so? Mat. 20 13

I wrong you not; take what is yours, and go. Mat. 20 14

May n't I dispose of that which is my own?
Are you (because I Am liberal) envious grown? Mat. 20 15

So shall the first be last, the last be first: Mat. 20 16

For many that are called are accursed.
44.
Now Lazarus of Beth'ny was not well; Joh. 11 1

(In Bethany did Martha and Mary dwell:
Mary, which afterward with ointment rare Joh. 11 2

Bathed Jesus feet, and wiped them with her hair.)
They sent one therefore unto Christ, to tell, Joh. 11 3

That Laz'rus (whom he loved) was not well:
It Is not to death (said he) but I thereby Joh. 11 4

Shall further manifest my deity.
Now Jesus loved the Sisters and the Brother Joh. 11 5

[As tenderly as they did one another.]
Therefore (that Lazarus might die) he stays, Joh. 11 6

Where he received the Messenger, two days.
45.
Behold (said Jesus after that) we go Mat. 20 17
Mar. 10 32
Luke 18 31
Joh. 11 7

Into Judea [strictly called so.]
Master (said they) will thou go there again, Joh. 11 8

Where thou wast like so lately to be slain?
As in the day (said he) men walk or run, Joh. 11 9

And fear no stumbling, while they see the Sun:
So am I kept by Gods Almighty power, Joh. 11 10

Until my night, until my gloomy hour.
Then shall I be betrayed to Jewish hands, Mat. 20 18
Mar. 10 33
Luke 18 32

And so delivered to the Roman Bands,
By them to be abused, whipped and slain; Mat. 20 19
Mar. 10 34
Luke 18 33

And (in three days) be raised up again.
But the amazed Apostles did not know, Luke 18 34

How He (that must be King) could suffer so.
For such a pompous Christ they thought upon.
46.
Which caused this request of James and John; Mat. 20 20
Mar. 10 35

(Their Mother Salom [Christs Cozen] came, Mar. 10 36

And did present it in her childrens name) Mat. 20 21

That in his future Kingdom they might stand. Mar. 10 37

One on his right, and one on 's other hand. Mat. 20 22

Alas (said Christ) ye know not what ye ask. Mar. 10 38

Can ye be plunged in horror that shall mask
The suns bright face? or can ye drink the cup,
Whose bitter dregs must be by me drunk up?
And when they confidently said they could, Mat. 20 23
Mar. 10 39

He told them that in part (indeed) they should:
But next to me to sit (said he) in Heaven, Mar. 10 40

Must unto those whom God has chose be given.
Now this ambitious suit of these two men Mat. 20 24
Mar. 10 41
Luke 22 24

Raised a heart-burning in the other ten:
Whom Jesus checked; and told them thus withal, Mat. 20 25
Mar. 10 42
Luke 22 25

Ye must expect no Kingdom temporal.
Gentiles do Lord it over men, ye know; Mat. 20 26
Mar. 10 43

It must not be among my subjects so. Luke 22 26

But he that would be highest, let him be* Mat. 20 27
Mar. 10 44

Adorned with the low'st humility.
For I came not to be attended on, Mat. 20 28
Mar. 10 45
Luke 22 27

Or to erect me an Imperial throne;
But to serve others, to relieve the poor,
And give my very life for many more.
47.
And as the Lord arrived at Jericho, Luke 19 1

The High Collector (but in stature low) Luke 19 2

Not able to behold him, ran before, Luke 19 3

O'retopt the press upon a Sycamore. Luke 19 4

Christ (when he saw him) bad him haste away;
For at thine house (said he) I mean to stay. Luke 19 5

Zaccheus was o'rejoy'd, to be so blessed Luke 19 6

With such a great and unexpected Guest.
Though others murmured, because he sat' Luke 19 7

With such a Grand Extortioner as that.
Now [after certain other words that past] Luke 19 8

Zaccheus humbly told the Lord at last, Ex. 22. 1.

That half his goods should now relieve the poor,
And all his frauds twice-doubly he 'ld restore.
This day (said Christ) salvation hither cam'; Luke 19 9

He Is now a lawful Son of Abraham.
For I (the Son of Man) it is I restore, Luke 19 10

It Is I redeem, whatever was lost before.
48.
And now, because they thought he went to take Mat. 25 14
Luke 19 11

His Regal power on him, thus he spoke;
A certain Noble man went forth to reign, Mat. 25 15
Luke 19 12

Intending shortly to return again:
First taking care, his servants should not lack Mat. 25 16
Luke 19 13

Money to trade withal, till he came back.
But of his Citizens he was abhorred, Mat. 25 17
Luke 19 14

Who said they would not own him for their Lord.
However he went on, and took his crown; Mat. 25 18
Luke 19 15

And so returned to this rebellious Town:
And askd his men, what profit they had made, Mat. 25 19

Of what he left to carry on the trade.
Sir (said the most industrious of his men) Mat. 25 20
Luke 19 16

Thy single pound has gained other ten.
Well done (said he) for thy fidelity Mat. 25 21
Luke 19 17

Ten Cities thou shall govern under me.
Another pound had gaind five other pounds: Mat. 25 22
Luke 19 18

He was rewarded with as many Towns. Mat. 25 23
Luke 19 19

Sir (said another) here is all thy pound, Mat. 25 24

I kept it in a napkin under ground: Mat. 25 25
Luke 19 20

Because thy rigidness so well was known, Luke 19 21

As that thou reapest where thou have no^ sown. Mat. 25 26

Thou wicked, idle fellow (then said he) Luke 19 22

Thine own confession shall thy Judgment be.
^or if thou knew mine austerity, Mat. 25 27
Luke 19 23

Why wrought it not more diligence in thee?
Thou should have put it in the bank at lest, Luke 19 24

That so it might have come with interest.
Take it away (said he to the other men) Mat. 25 28
Luke 19 25

Give it to him that has already ten.
To him that has, shall more and more be given; Mat. 25 29
Luke 19 26

While he that wants, to greater want is driven.
Let that unprofitable slave be cast, Mat. 25 30

Where darkness, griefs and anguish ever last.
And those my foes that did not like my reign, Luke 18 27

Bring them to me, and let me see them slain.
49.
As Jesus left the Town, behold there lay Mat. 20 29
Mar. 10 46
Luke 19 35

Two blind distressed beggars in the way. Luke 18 36

They (hearing who it was that came) cried thus, Mat. 20 30
Mar. 10 47
Luke 18 37

Jesus (thou Son of David pity us. Luke 18 38

And being charged not to make a noise, Luke 18 39

So much the more they lifted up their voice. Mat. 20 31
Mar. 10 48

Then Jesus (hearing of their pitteous note) Mat. 20 32
Mar. 10 49
Luke 18 40

Stood still, and gave command to have them brought.
One of the two (poor Bartimeus) cast Mar. 10 50

His coat away, to make the greater have.
Then Jesus asked them, what it was they 'ld have:
O Lord (said they) our sight we only crave. Mar. 10 51
Luke 18 41

He gave them sight; and said, Your faith is it, Mat. 20 33

Which has prepared you for this benefit.
Then all the people praised God with them; Mar. 10 52
Luke 18 42
Mat. 20 34
Luke 18 43

And they went also towered Jerusalem.
50.
Laz'rus is fallen a sleep (said Jesus then) Joh. 11 11

But I must go to 'waken him again.
His sleep (said they) will make him well [and so, Joh. 11 12

So near Jerusalem we need not go.]
Our friend is dead (said he) now speak I plain; Joh. 11 13

But I must go to raise him up again. Joh. 11 14

And I am glad, I was not there before; Joh. 11 15

That now I may confirm your faith the more.
Come, let us be gone: [I told you that no power
Or malice can precipitate my hour.]
I fear (said Thomas) we shall lose our Master: Joh. 11 16

But let us share with him in each disaster.
51.
When Jesus came to Bethany, he found Joh. 11 17

The Corpse had been four days within the ground.
(Two little mile this little Town did stand Joh. 11 18

Upon this side the greatest in the land:
So that from thence came many of the Jew;, Joh. 11 19

To cheer the family, upon this news.)
Then Martha (hearing that the Lord was come) Joh. 11 20

Met him in the fields: but Mary staid at home.
Ah Lord (said she) had thou been here with us, Joh. 11 21

We should have still enjoyed our Lazarus.
Yet now I know, whatever thou will require, Joh. 11 22

I know that God will grant thee thy desire.
Thy Brother shall arise again (said he) Joh. 11 23

Do thou but steadfastly believe in me.
Martha replied, I know indeed he shall, Joh. 11 24

When mankind does arise in general.
It Is I (said he) who Resurrection give; Joh. 11 25

They that believe in me shall ever live: Joh. 11 26

Believ'st thou this? Yea Lord (she said) I do: Joh. 11 27

Thou art the Christ foretold so long ago.
Then Martha (being by her Master sent) Joh. 11 28

Called Mary too; and Mary quickly went. Joh. 11 29

(He was not come within the Town as yet, Joh. 11 30

But staid where first he was by Martha met.)
The Jews that were about her, thought she went. Joh. 11 31

To weep afresh upon his Monument.
But coming to the place where Jesus staid, Joh. 11 32

And kneeling at his feet, she wept, and said;
Lord, had we had thy presence here with us,
Still had we had our Brother Lazarus.
When Jesus saw them, how they wept and moan'd, Joh. 11 33

His soul was troubled, and he sighd and groaned.
Where have ye laid his body (then said he?) Joh. 11 34

Lord (they replied) be pleased to come and see.
And as he went along (to sympathize) Cant. 1. 15. Joh. 9. 1.
Joh. 11 35

The tears did trickle from his dove-like eyes.
Behold (said some that saw him weeping thus) Joh. 11 36

Behold what love he had for Lazarus!
But could he not have saved his life likewise, Joh. 11 37

As well as once he gave a blind man eyes?
Then [in his pray'r] be gave another groan; Joh. 11 38

And bad the people take away the stone.
The smell will be offensive (Martha says) Joh. 11 39

For in this posture has he lien four days.
Did not I say, If thou believ'st (said he) Joh. 11 40

Gods great and glorious power thou shall see?
They then removed the stone from off the dead. Joh. 11 41

And Jesus (looking up to Heaven) said,
Thy name (O Father) be for ever blessed,
Because thou answerest thy Sons request.
And though I know, thou always hear me; Joh. 11 42

I spoke, to make it known, I came from thee.
Then (lifting up his voice) he cried, Come, Joh. 11 43

Come (Laz'rus from this solitary tomb.
Laz'rus came forth, and had his hands and feet Joh. 11 44

Solemnly wrapped within his winding sheet;
And with a napkin bound about his head
[Their usual way of burying all the dead.]
Unty the clothes (said Christ) and let him go.
[So they that were about him did do so.]
Then many of the Jews who thither came, Joh. 11 45

And saw this sight, believed on his name.
But others to the City ran in have, Joh. 11 46

And told the Pharisees whatever had past.
52.
A Council then was called; wherein was one Joh. 11 47

Stood up and said, Great miracles are done:
If King he be proclaimed, in a fury Joh. 11 48

The imperious Romans come and ransack Jury.
Does this (said Cai'phas) put you to a stand? Joh. 11 49

The death of Jesus must preserve the land. Joh. 11 50

(Thus, being High Priest, he showed unwittingly Joh. 11 51

How Jesus should for Jew and Gentile die.) Joh. 11 52

They all agreed; and now to bring't about, Joh. 11 53

These Orders presently were issued out:
Whoever knows where Jesus is, must give Joh. 11 57

Notice thereof; he is not fit to live.
He therefore (knowing how they wanted him) Joh. 11 54

Secured himself a while at Ephraim.
53.
Now as the Passover was drawing nigh, Levit. 4, etc.
Joh. 11 55

Some went before, themselves to purify.
And in the Temple there they stood to reason, Joh. 11 56

Whether they might expect him at the season.
54.
Six days before that great solemnity, Mat. 26 6
Mar. 14 3 John 11 1

He came again and supt at Bethany.
(Lazarus sat at table with the Lord, Joh. 11 2

But Martha stood and waited at the board.)
Then Mary (with a pound of Nard most rare) Mat. 26 7
Joh. 11 3

Did bath his feet, and wipe them with her hair;
And poured the rest upon his head (the room
All over smelling of the rich persume.)
This is but spilt (said Judas) on the ground: Mat. 26 8
Mar. 14 4
Joh. 11 4

This might have fetched the poor at lest ten pound. Mat. 26 9
Mar. 14 5
Joh. 11 5

(Not that he loved the poor: his being theevish Joh. 11 6

And carrying the bag, made him so peevish.)
You Will have the poor (said Christ) when I am gone:
Let her alone; it is virtuously done.
She (to the utmost of her power) strove Mat 26 11
Mar. 14 7
Joh. 12 8

Thus to express her gratitude and love.
I am (as 'twere) embalmed; with this same Nard Mat 26 12
Mar. 14 8

My body for my funeral is prepared.
How far soever this Gospel is extended, Mat 26 13
Mar. 14 9

This deed of Marys shall be there commended.
55.
His being here was now divulged by fame; Joh. 12 9

Much people therefore from the City came:
They came to see the Lord; to see [and have
Discourse with] him, He called from the grave.
But the Chief Priests sought Lazarus to slay, Joh. 12 10

Because through him were many drawn away. Joh. 12 11

CHAP. 6.
. 1.
NExt morning (being Sunday) forth He set Mat. 21 1
Mar. 11 1
Luke 19 28

Toward the City, by mount Olivet:
Thence sent he two of his Disciples down, Mat. 21 2
Mar. 11 2
Luke 19 29

To fetch two Asses from a neighbor-town.
On one (said he) no man has ever sat: Luke 19 30

Where two ways meet, you 'l find them at a gate.
If the Owner ask you, wherefore ye unty them; Mat. 21 3
Mar. 11 3
Luke 19 31

Say it is for me, he cannot then deny them.
As Jesus bad them, so they said and did Za. h. 9. 9.
Mar. 11 4
Luke 19 32

And brought the Colt, that never was bestrid. Mar. 11 5
Luke 19 33

And when they had their coats upon him laid, Mar. 11 6
Luke 19 34

They helped their Master up: as Zach'ry said, Mat. 21 4
Mar. 11 7
Luke 19 35
Joh. 12 12

Daughter of Sion, cast away thy fears; Mat. 21 5
Joh. 12 13

Thy King upon a gentle Asle appears. Mat. 21 6

(Though this at present was not in their head, Mat. 21 7
Joh. 12 14

Till after he was risen from the dead.) Joh. 12 15

Then from the City came a multitude Joh. 12 16

(Upon the fame of's last great wonder showed) Joh. 12 17

Bearing victorious palms, their King to meet; Joh. 12 18

Stra^ing their clothes and boughs beneath his feet.
For all his mighty works they now rejoice, Mat. 21 8
Mar. 11 8
Luke 19 36

And praise the Lord with their triumphal voice. Luke 19 37

Hosanna makes the trembling air to ring: Mat. 21 9
Mar. 11 9
Luke 19 38

Hosanna to the long-expected King.
Hosanna (let our King O Lord be saved) Mar. 11 10

Hosanna to the Holy Son of David.
Hosan-Hosan-Hosan-na to our Christ!
Hosan-Hosan-Hosan-na in the highest!
Master (said certain Pharisees that came) Luke 19 39

Bid thy Disciples hold their tongue for shame.
If my Disciples should refrain (said he) Luke 19 40

The very pebles would acknowledge me
Wen he drew nigh and looked upon the City, Luke 19 41

Thoughts of her ruin made him weep for pity.
Oh that thou had (said he) but understood Luke 19 42

The things that make for thine eternal good!
Now '^is too late: now will thy foes surround Luke 19 43

And lay thee even with the very ground.
They shall not leave a stone upon a stone
Because thou do thy Savior thus disown. Luke 19 44

The Townsmen star'd to see the Pomp, and cried, Mat. 21 10

Who Is this that does in such a manner ride?
This is the Prophet (said the Company) Mat. 21 11

Jesus of Nazareth in Galilce.
What (said the Pharisees) shall now be done? Joh. 2. 13. Is 56. 7. Jer. 7. 11.

After this fellow all the world is gone.
2.
Then Jesus went (a second time) to clear Mat. 21 12
Mar. 11 15
Luke 19 45

The Temple (as he did before three year.)
And (from an holy zeal) he 'ld not permit Mar. 11 16

One vessel to be carried through it.
It Is writ (said he) Mine Is called an house of prayer:
But ye have turned it to a thievish fair. Mat. 21 13
Mar. 11 17
Luke 19 46

Then thither were conveyed the blind and lame;
And he bestowed his aid on all that came. Mat. 21 14

Which when the Great ones saw, and heard the boys
(With their Hosannas) making such a noise, Mat. 21 15

Enraged at the very heart they came,
And askd him whether he observed the same.
Yea, know ye not (said he) how David says, Ps. 8. 2.

From Babes and Sucklings thou receivest praise?
Then they 'ld have killed him, but they greatly feared him, Mar. 11 18
Luke 19 47

Because the multitude so gladly heard him. Luke 19 48

And when the evening came, he did repair
To Bethany again, and lodged there. Mat. 21 17
Mar. 11 19

3.
And as he went again (the second day) Mar. 11 11

He found himself an hungry by the way: Mat. 21 18
Mar. 11 12

And going to a Fig Tree, finds there
Leaves only; for 'twas but a bad Fig-year. Mat. 21 19
Mar. 11 13

Hence forth (said he) no man eat fruit of thee:
And presently the sap forsook the tree. Mar. 11 14

4.
Now while they were in Town, some Greeks that came Joh. 12 20

To worship at the feast) had heard his fame,
And thus accosted Philip; Sir, you 'l please us Joh. 12 21

Greatly, to help us to a sight of Jesus.
Philip told Andrew; and they both addressed Joh. 12 22

Themselves to Jesus with the Greeks request.
Then Jesus told them how he must be slain, Joh. 12 23

And rise in glory from the dust again:
Like to a grain of wheat, that first must die, Joh. 12 24

And then does very greatly multiply.
Choose life, you will see it is only death ye choose: Joh. 12 25

Lose life for me, and nothing shall ye lose.
He that will serve me, thus must follow me: Joh. 12 26

And where I am, my servant there shall be.
High honor shall my Father then bestow
On them that humbly serve me here below.
Now is my soul perplexed, what shall I say? Joh. 12 27

Father protect me from this gloomy day.
But hither for this very cause I came: Joh. 12 28

And therefore glorify thine holy Name.
Then came a voice (like 'thunder) from the sky.
My Name I have, and still will glorify.
Some said it thundered; but other some Joh. 12 29

Said that the voice did from an Angel come.
The voice (said Christ) came not alone for me, Joh. 12 30

But to reprove your infidelity.
Now Is the redemption of the captive world: Joh. 12 31

Now shall the Tyrant from his Throne be hurld.
And when I am exalted on the tree, Joh. 12 32

All sort of people shall be drawn to me.
Thus he foretold them, how he ought to die: Is. 9. 6, 7.
Joh. 12 33

And thus the people therefore did reply,
The Law says plain, Christ shall remain for aye; Joh. 12 34

And how can thou be taken then away?
Yet for a while (said he) ye have the light; Joh. 12 35

Walk in it before you are taken by the night.
Believe in me the light: So see and know, Joh. 12 36

(Like Sons of light) both how and where ye go.
He that sees me, and trusts in my Name, Joh. 12 44

Both sees and trusts in him from whom I came: Joh. 12 45

I came to light the world; that seeing me, Joh. 12 46

They might be freed from their obscurity.
And he that shuts his eyes and will not see, Joh. 12 47

Shall yet receive no punishment from me;
For now I came to save: but what I say, Joh. 12 48

That word shall Judge him at the later day.
For of my self I have not spoke, but rather Joh. 12 49

Made known the will of mine Eternal Father.
His will's Eternal life: I speak no more, Joh. 12 50

Than what my Father spoke to me before.
Then Jesus went towered Olivet at night, Luke 11 37
Joh. 12 36

And staid [at Bethany] till morning light. Luke 11 38

(So many wonders yet produced no faith Joh. 12 37

In those spectatours: as Isaiah says, Is 53. 1.

Who (Lord) has given credit to our word? Joh. 12 38

Who understands the power of the Lord?
Nor could they then believe, because their mind Is. 6. 10.

The Lord (as he says) did in Judgment blind: Joh. 12 39

Lest they should understand, and turn, and might Joh. 12 40

Receive the blessing which they did so slight.
Thus said Isaiah, when he did foresee Joh. 12 41

And spoke beforehand of his Majesty.
Some Rulers (yet) believed; but appeared Joh. 12 42

Not public Confessors, because they feared
The lash of excommunicating rods,
And more esteemed man's applause than Gods.) Joh. 12 43

5.
And in the morning as they passed by,
They saw the fig (from top to bottom) dry. Mat. 21 20
Mar. 11 20

See Sir (said Peter) how since Yesterday Mar. 11 21

This cursed tree is withered quite away!
Have faith in God (said he) then may ye set Mat. 21 21
Mar. 11 22

Among the mounting waves Mount Olivet.
Whatever ye say in faith, ye shall archieve: Mar. 11 23

Whenever ye pray in faith, ye shall receive. Mat. 21 22
Mar. 11 24

But when ye send up your requests to Heaven,
All that offend you, must be then forgiven. Mat. 11 25

For Heavens pardons are bestowed among you, Mar. 11 26

As you yourselves do pardon those that wrong you.
6.
Then did he to the sacred Temple go, Mat. 21 23
Mar. 11 27
Luke 20 1

And teach the people, as he used to do:
Where he was questioned by the scribes and Priests, Mar. 11 28
Luke 20 2

By whose authority he did all this.
This Question first (said Jesus) answer me, Mat. 21 24
Mar. 11 29
Luke 20 3

Was It God or Man gave John authority? Mar. 11 30
Luke 20 4

If we should answer, It was God (thought they) Mat. 21 25
Mar. 11 31
Luke 20 5

He Will ask us, why we did him not obey:
And Man we dare not say; this people all Mat. 21 26
Mar. 11 32
Luke 20 6

Hold that his Office was Prophetical. Luke 20 7

Therefore they said, We cannot tell. Nor I Mat. 21 27
Mar. 11 33
Luke 20 8

(Said he) shall show you my authority.
A man commanded (once) his Son to go, Mat. 21 28

And in his field a little pains bestow.
First he refused; but afterward he went, Mat. 21 29

And of his obstinacy did repent.
But when another of his Sons was bid, Mat. 21 30

He said, I go for sooth; but never did.
Now which of those (do ye suppose) obeyed? Mat. 21 31

The first that went and did repent (they said.)
Truly (said he) just so it is with you: Mat. 21 32

Much ye pr^tend, but very little do.
The noted sinners to the Baptist went;
Which ye refused to hearken and repent.
A certain man a vincyard did prepare, Mat. 21 33
Mar. 12 1
Luke 20 9

And spent thereon much pains and cost and care:
And (being far removed) sent men unto 't, Luke 20 10

To bring him from the husbandmen some fruit. Mat. 21 34
Mar. 12 2

But they (in stead of sending him his due) Luke 20 11

Took all his men, and beat them black and blew. Mat. 21 35
Mar. 12 3

And sending more, more basely they were used; Mar. 12 4
Luke 20 12

Both stoned and killed, and many ways abused. Mat. 21 36

At last he sent his only Son, and said, Mat. 21 37
Mar. 12 5
Luke 20 13

Now some respect will certainly be paid.
But when they saw him, they conspired to kill Mat. 21 38
Mar. 12 6
Luke 20 14

The Son and Heir, and have his land at will.
So taking him, they barbarously slew him; Mat. 21 39
Mar. 12 7
Luke 20 15

And th^n without the vineyard-walls they threw him.
Now when his Father comes, what think ye then Mat. 21 40
Mar. 12 8

He 'l do to these inhumane husbandmen? Mat. 21 41
Mar. 12 9

Surely (said they) he 'l use them as his foes,
And get him better husbandmen than those. Ps 119. 22, 23.
Luke 20 16

The Lord (said he) shall miserably use
Rebellious, fruitless, Prophet-killing Jews.
Nay, God forbid (said they.) Nay but (said he) Mat. 21 42
Mar. 12 10
Luke 20 17

What means the Psalmist in that Prophecy,
Strangely has God made chiefly to be used Mat. 21 43
Mar. 12 11

That Cornerstone which Architects refused?
Whosoever in weakness stumbles at this stone, Mat. 21 44

He hurts not that, he hurts himself alone: Luke 20 18

Whosoever in malice does oppose it, shall
Be brus'd to powder with its weighty fall.
The Pharisees, peceiving how he turned Mat. 21 45
Mar. 12 12
Luke 20 19

His Parables on them, in fury burned:
Which then they would (with all their hearts) have showed, Mat. 21 46

But that they greatly feared the multitude.
With this same parable went Jesus on; Mat. 22 1

A King proclaimed the marriage of his Son, Mat. 22 2

And sent some servants (on the wedding day) Mat. 22 3

To bid the Guests make haste and come away:
But they refused. Then sent he other some, Mat. 22 4

To press them very earnestly to come.
Some (slighting them) about their busness went, Mat. 22 5

And so dismissed them with a complement.
Some pulled his servants by the ears: and some Mat. 22 6

So used them, that alive they never went home.
The enraged King sent then his army down, Mat. 22 7

To kill those murderers, and fire the Town.
Here Is every thing (said he) in readiness, Mat. 22 8

But none of those deserve to be my Guests.
Go ye (my Servants) into every street, Mat. 22 9

And (good and bad) bring hither all ye meet.
So the men did, as he commanded them: Mat. 22 10

To grace the Nuptials of that Royal Stem.
Then to the feast his Father came, to view't; Mat. 22 11

And found a man without a wedding-suit.
Friend (said the King) how did thou hither come Mat. 22 12

Without thy wedding-cloaths? And he was dumb.
Bind him both foot and hand (said he) and cast him Mat. 22 13

To smoke and soot and torment everlasting.
Many ('it is true) are called; and it is as true, Mat. 22 14

That Gods Elect are but a very few.
7.
Then some were sent to play the hypocrite, Mat. 22 15
Mar. 12 13
Luke 20 20

And slyly to ensnare him, if they might.
Master (said they) thou teach what is right, Mat. 22 16
Mar. 12 14
Luke 20 21

And carest not for any mortal wight.
Thou can resolve us in a doubt, we know: Mat. 22 17
Luke 20 22

May we to Caesar tribute give or no?
Ye hypocrites (said Christ) why tempt ye me? Mat. 22 18
Mar. 12 15
Luke 20 23

Bring me a piece of tribute-coyn, to see. Mat. 22 19

Whose image and whose superscriptions there Mat. 22 20
Mar. 12 16
Luke 20 24

The coin (said they) does Cesars image bear.
Give Caesar then (said Jesus) Cesars due: Mat. 22 21
Mar. 12 17
Luke 20 25

And give to God, what God commands you.
And when they could not thus entrap him, they Mat. 22 22
Luke 20 26

(Much wondering at his answer) went their way.
8.
Then came to him the Sadduces, that say, Mat. 22 23
Mar. 12 18
Luke 20 27

Never shall be a Resurrection-day.
Master (said they) by Moses if a Brother Mat. 22 24
Mar. 12 19
Luke 20 28

Leave his wife childless, she shall have the other. Mat. 22 25

One woman thus had Brother after Brother, Mat. 22 26
Mar. 12 20
Luke 20 29

And seven of them after one another. Luke 20 30

Now in your Resurrection from the dead, Mat. 22 27
Mar. 12 21

How shall she know her future nuptial-bed? Mat. 22 28
Mar. 12 22
Luke 20 31

You err (said Christ) because ye do not know Mat. 22 29
Mar. 12 23
Luke 20 32

The Scriptures well, nor what the Lord can do.
For in the Resurrection of the dead, Mat. 22 30
Mar. 12 24
Luke 20 33

They live like Angels, and do never wed. Ex. 3. 6.

But that the dead shall rise again, your Moses Mat. 22 31
Mar. 12 25
Luke 20 34

In that Bush-vision very plain supposes: Luke 20 35

When God appeared to him, and said, I am Mat. 22 32
Mar. 12 26
Luke 20 36

The God of Jacob, Isaac, Abraham. Luke 20 37

If He be Abrams God, then Abram must Mat. 22 33
Mar. 12 27
Luke 20 38

At present live, and one day leave the dust.
9.
His silencing of them did greatly please Mat. 22 34
Mar. 12 28
Luke 20 39

Their great Antagonists the Pharisees.
Then came a Scribe, and fain would understand, Mat. 22 35
Luke 20 40

Which was the first and principal Command. Mat. 22 36

It Is this (said Jesus) Israel, give ear, Deuteronomy. 6. 4.
Mat. 22 37
Mar. 12 29

Thy God is one; let him be all thy fear:
Love him with all thy heart and soul and mind. Mat. 22 38
Mar. 12 30

And to thy neighbor (as thy self) be kind.
These are the chief; so far do these extend, Mat. 22 39
Mar. 12 31

That Law and Prophets all on these depend.
It Is true indeed (the Lawyer then replies) Mat. 22 40

This far exceeds all burn^-sacrifice. Mar. 12 32

Jesus rejoined, Discreetly thou reply'st; Mar. 12 33

Thou art not far (I see) from owning Christ Mar. 12 34

What think ye, Sirs? who is your Messia's Father? Mat. 22 41
Mar. 12 35

David (said they) so far as we can gather. Mat. 22 42

How then (said Christ) can He be David's Lord? Ps. 110. 1.
Mat. 22 43
Mar. 12 36
Luke 20 41

Yet thus the Holy Ghost and he record;
Jehovah bad my Lord take up his seat Mat. 22 44
Mar. 12 37
Luke 20 42

On his right hand, till all his foes were beat. Mat. 22 45
Luke 20 43

So shamefully this ran them all on ground, Mat. 22 46
Luke 20 44

No question afterward they durst propound.
10.
Then their hypocrisy He further showed Mat. 23 1
Mar. 12 38
Luke 20 45

To's own Disciples and the multitude.
They sit in Moses seat (said he) it is true: Mat. 23 2

Do what accordingly they bid you do. Mat. 23 3

But turn aside from walking in their way, Mat. 23 4

Because they seldom practice what they say.
They will not set one finger to the packs Number. 15. 38. Deuteronomy. 6. 8.
Mat. 23 5

They bind so big, to lay on others backs.
Their fringes and Phylacteries are broad; Mat. 23 6
Mar. 12 39
Luke 20 46

That men may their great holiness applaud.
At Church and feasts they must be highly seated, Mat. 23 7

In streets and all assemblies lowly greeted
With Master, Doctor, Father; and believe,
That all men's faith must hang upon their sleeve.
Affect not you such proud and swelling titles: Mat. 23 8

You're Brethren all, and only my Disciples.
From your Celestial Father never swerve: Mat. 23 9

And he that would be greatest, let him serve. Mat. 23 10

Proud self-exalters shall be tumbled down, Mat. 23 11

While self-abasers win and wear the Crown. Mat. 23 12

Woe to you Scribes and Pharisees, whose leaven Mat. 23 13

Keeps both your selves and others out of Heaven!
Woe, woe to you, that make your selves the heirs Mat. 23 14
Mar. 12 40
Luke 20 47

Of widows, by your long pretended prayers!
Woe, that ye hunt for Proselytes, and so Mat. 23 15

Entitl'em twice to your deserved woe!
Woe unto you blind guides, that let men faulter, Mat. 23 16

When ever they swear by Temple or by Altar; Mat. 23 17

And teach (for lucres sake) that oaths must hold, Mat. 23 18

When once they 're made by Offerings and Gold. Mat. 23 19

The Altar and the Temple rather bind, Mat. 23 20

Which sanctify the gifts: ye fools and blind! Mat. 23 21

But whosoever swears by any thing, Mat. 23 22

He swears by the Everlasting King. Mat. 23 23
Luke 11 42

Woe be to you that tithe your herbs (and yet
This ye must do) but all the while omit
The weightier matters of the moral Law; Mat. 23 24

Leap over a block, and stumble at a straw.
Woe be to you that cleanse the cup and platter; Mat. 23 25

Whose hearts abound with all corruptest matter.
Cleanse first (blind Pharisee) thine inner side, Mat. 23 26

That so thy diet may be sanctified.
Woe to the whited tombs, that look so fair; Mat. 23 27

And so defile men, ever they be aware. Mat. 23 28

Woe be to you that garnish and renew Mat. 23 29

The tombs of Prophets, whom your Fathers slew. Mat. 23 30

For (in the sight of God, ye thus approve Mat. 23 31

Massacring those, whom thus ye seem to love. Mat. 23 32

Fill up the measure of your Fathers then, Mat. 23 33

Ye brood and heirs of Hell, more asps than men!
Those Prophets came from God, as others will; 2 Chronicles. 24 19, 21, 22. Deuteronomy.
16. 16.
Mat. 23 34

Whom ye shall scourge and crucify and kill:
That all the righteous blood may come on you, Mat. 23 35

From Abel unto Zachry, whom ye slew
(To pleasure Joash) in the Temple Court: Mat. 23 36
Luke 11 52

This Generation here shall answer for 't.
11.
Observing then how into their Corbon Mar. 12 41
Luke 21 1

By moneyed men great offerings were thrown, 2 King. 12. 9.

He saw a Widow bring a double mi^e Mar. 12 42
Luke 21 2

(Both of them did not make a farthing quite.)
Observe (said he to the twelve) observe this woman, Mar. 12 43
Luke 21 3

In real bounty paralel'd by no man
Their gifts proceed from their superfluous store: Mar. 12 44
Luke 21 4

Such is her need (poor Soul) she has no more.
12.
See Sir (said one, as they departed thence) Mat. 24 1
Mar. 13 1
Luke 21 5

This stately stone, the Kings munificence!
Brave building! but (said he) the times at hand, Mat. 24 2
Mar. 13 2
Luke 21 6

When not a stone upon a stone shall stand.
Then the Disciples asked him (being set Mat. 24 3
Mar. 13 3
Luke 21 7

Against the Temple, on mount Olivet)
When the Exit of the present age would be, Mar. 13 4

And when he should appear in Majesty.
Be not (said Jesus) drawn aside by any: Mat. 24 4
Mar. 13 5
Luke 21 8

For Pseudo-Christs will come seducing many. Mat. 24 5
Mar. 13 6

Fear ye not Wars, when their reports are hot:
Such things must be, but yet the end is not. Mat. 24 6
Mar. 13 7
Luke 21 9

For Wars and famines, Plagues and Earthquakes go, Mat. 24 7
Mar. 13 8
Luke 21 10

Forerunners of that more tremendous woe. Mat. 24 8
Luke 21 11

But look ye to it: for first they will accuse you Mat. 24 9
Mar. 13 9
Luke 21 12

To Heathen Courts and Councils, and abuse you.
So will their sins be highly aggravated, Mar. 13 10
Luke 21 13

And so the Gospel more and more dilated.
But study not beforehand what to say; Mar. 13 11
Luke 21 14

The Holy Ghost shall prompt you in that day.
I Will give you mouths and wisdom, which your foes Mar. 13 12
Luke 21 15

Shall not have wit or power to oppose.
Yet all shall hate you, and your friends betray you, Mat. 24 10
Mar. 13 13
Luke 21 16

Your nearest kindred persecute and slay you. Mat. 24 11

This wickedness will cool the love of most: Mat. 24 12
Luke 21 17

Hold out, and your reward shall near be lost. Mat. 24 13

In patience keep your Souls, keep out despair: Luke 21 18

God is your guide, ye shall not lose an hair.
When ye have testified to every land Mat. 24 14
Luke 21 19

These joyful tidings, then the times at hand.
And when ye see that desolating rout Dan. 9. 27. Genesis 19. ^6.
Mat. 24 15
Mar. 13 14
Luke 21 20

Of Heathens girt Jerusalem about,
Fly to the Mountains of Arabia; Mat. 24 16
Mar. 13 15
Luke 21 21

Slack not your pace for any remora. Mat. 24 17

Fly for your life, and make no lingering halt: Mat. 24 18
Mar. 13 16
Luke 21 22

Think of Lots wife transformed into salt. Luke 17 31

Obey and live; but if ye will not fly, Luke 17 32

Share in the general calamity. Luke 17 33

Women with child shall then have great distress, Mat. 24 19
Mar. 13 17
Luke 21 23

And they that carry sucklings at their breasts.
But pray to God, ye be not forced to fly Mat. 24 20
Mar. 13 18

In stormy winter from your enemy:
And that it be not your Sabbatick year
[When all provision will be scarce and dear.]
For these are days of vengeance and of woe, Mat. 24 21
Mar. 13 19

The like to which the world did never know.
Nor would a man escape, did God not make Mat. 24 22
Mar. 13 20

An end the sooner for his chosen's sake.
Thousands shall meet with their untimely graves,
Thousands shall then be sold about for slaves: Luke 21 24

And under foot the City shall be trod
By Gentiles, till the Gentiles Period.
Then will a Savior very welcome be, Mat. 24 23
Mar. 13 21
Luke 17 22

Then shall ye wish the Son of Man to see;
And then they 'll cry, Lo, here is Christ, and there! Mat. 24 24
Mar. 13 22
Luke 17 23

For many such pretenders will appear,
And (with their miracles of magic) cozen
(If 'twere but possible) the very chosen.
Be not so charmed so shall ye not be harmed; Mat. 24 25
Mar. 13 23

Be now sorewarn'd, so shall ye be forearmed. Mat. 24 26

For as the lightning all are wont to see; Mat. 24 27
Luke 17 24

So plain, so sudden shall my coming be.
But first I am to drink my bitter cup. Luke 17 25

And when the measure of their sins is up; Mat. 24 28

Then come the Roman Eagles and display Luke 17 37

Their hovering wings above the rotten prey.
Such fearful sights shall then be every where, Mat. 24 29
Mar. 13 24
Luke 21 25

As if the end of all the world were near.
The powers of Heaven and Earth shall then be shaken: Mat. 24 30
Mar. 13 25
Luke 21 26

With horror shall the hearts of men be taken.
The world shall evidently see my hand Mar. 13 26
Luke 21 27

Inflicting vengeance on this wicked land.
And then I 'll send my Messengers, to fetch in Mat. 24 31
Mar. 13 27

My chosen out of every land, by preaching.
Now when ye see these tokens, droop no more; Mar. 13 28
Luke 21 28

For your deliverance is at the door: Mat. 24 32
Mar. 13 29

As sure as blossoms (when they first appear) Luke 21 29

Do show the certain season of the year. Luke 21 30

These words of mine shall be accomplished, Mat. 24 33
Mar. 13 30
Luke 21 31

Before this present generation's dead:
The Heavens and the Earth shall pass away, Mat. 24 34
Mar. 13 31
Luke 21 32

Before one syllable thereof decay.
Although the day to Angels is not known, Mat. 24 35
Mar. 13 32
Luke 21 33

Nor to the Son of Man, but God alone. Mat. 24 36

Take heed of surfeits then, and worldly cares; Luke 21 34

For fear that day surprise you unawares.
For (as a secret snare) it shall take hold Luke 21 35

Of them, whose hearts are fixed upon mold.
As in the days of Noah and of Lot, Mat. 24 37
Luke 17 ^^

Pleasures and cares did mortals so besot, Mat. 24 38
Luke 17 27

That stood and fire oretook them ever they knew; Mat. 24 39
Luke 17 28

So will my coming be to most of you. Mat. 24 40

One shall be took, in bed, abroad, at mill; Mat. 24 41
Luke 17 30

And one forsook! I rescue whom I will. Mat. 24 42
Mar. 13 33
Luke 21 36

Then watch and pray; that when the land's involved
In condemnation, ye may stand absolved.
I am as one that travels to a land Mar. 13 34

A great way off, and gives his men command,
To work and watch, be ready to unlock
And let him in, when ever they hear him knock.
Stand ready girt, and let your candles burn; Mar. 13 35
Luke 12 35

Like servants waiting for their Lords return:
That whensoe'er he comes (though never so late) Mar. 13 36
Luke 12 36

There they may be to open him the gate.
Their honor and reward is very great: Luke 12 37

He 'l wait himself, and see them sit and eat.
Be watchful, and as careful as ye can: Luke 12 38

Be not surprised by the Son of Man.
For he will come with greater secresy, Mat. 24 43
Luke 12 39

Than they that come to act a robbery. Mat. 24 44
Luke 12 40

Speak thou (said Peter) unto us alone, Luke 12 41

Or is this Parable for every one?
Chiefly for you (said he) That servants blessed, Mat. 24 45
Luke 12 42

Whole Master left him t'overlook the rest, Mat. 24 46
Luke 12 43

And finds him doing it with care and faith: Mat. 24 47

He Will make him Ruler over all he has. Mat. 24 48
Luke 12 44

But if he says, My Lord will never be here, Mat. 24 49
Luke 12 45

And so begins to drink and domineer; Mat. 24 50

He Will come and hurl him (ever he is aware) Mat. 24 51
Luke 12 46

Where hypocrites and unbelievers are.
He shall have many stripes, who, though he knew, Luke 12 47

Yet disobeyed; when others shall have few.
For as the Lord has here entrusted men, Luke 12 48

To such a reckning will he call 'em then.
Then watch and pray: and what to you I say, Mar. 13 3^

I say the same to all men; Watch and pray.
13.
This other parable he added more,
[To press the duty treated of before.]
Ten Virgins once accompanied a spouse, Mat. 25 1

And waited till the Bridegroom came to the house.
Five of them (being simpler than the rest) Mat. 25 2

Brought nothing but their Lamps (and slightly dressed)
Forgetting a recruit: the other five Mat. 25 3

Brought Oyl-pots too, to keep their Lamps alive. Mat. 25 4

The Bridegrooms tarrying had closed the eyes
Not only of the foolish but the wise. Mat. 25 5

At midnight they were called upon, to come Mat. 25 6

And with their lights conduct the Bridegroom home.
So up they start, and (looking round about) Mat. 25 7

The silly maidens Lamps were quite gone out.
And when they would have borrowed a supply, Mat. 25 8

Their fellows sent them to the shops to buy. Mat. 25 9

They that were ready, to the Wedding hastened, Mat. 25 10

And ever the other came) the door was fastened. Mat. 25 11

Afterward came the careless ones, and cried, Mat. 25 12

Lord, Lord, admit us: but they were denied. Mat. 25 13

Furnish your hearts with grace, from sin awake;
That of my nuptial joys ye may partake.
When on my glorious Throne I come again Mat. 25 31

Attended on by my Seraphick train;
Then all the world shall be assembled under. Mat. 25 32

And then I 'll part the Sheep and Goats asunder.
On my right hand the Sheep shall stand; and they Mat. 25 33

(To their transcendent joy) shall hear me say,
Come blessed of my Father, and put on Mat. 25 34

The Crown prepared for you long agone.
Ye fed me, when I have an hungry bin: Mat. 25 35

I was a stranger, and ye took me in.
When I was naked, sick, and in the jayl, Mat. 25 36

To cloth and visit me ye did not fail.
Then shall they answer, Lord, we do not know, Mat. 25 37

That ever we saw thee and reliv'd thee so. Mat. 25 38

And then shall I rejoyn, Because you 've done it Mat. 25 39

Unto the least of mine, I thus will own it. Mat. 25 40

On my left hand the Goats shall stand, and they Mat. 25 41

(To their transcendent grief) shall hear me say,
Depart from me for ever (cursed crew!
To fire prepared for Satan and for you.
You fed me not, when hungry: I have bin Mat. 25 42

A stranger, and ye would not take me in. Mat. 25 43

When I was naked, sick, and in the jayl,
To cloth and see me you would be sure to fail.
Then shall they answer, Lord, we do not know, Mat. 25 44

That ever we saw thee and did slight thee so.
And then shall I rejoyn, Ye have not done it Mat. 25 45

Unto the least of mine, so I disown it.
And then shall these have endless death and woe, Mat. 25 46

While those to ease and life eternal go.
14.
Two days before the feast (as Jesus said, Mat. 26 1
Mar. 14 1
Luke 22 1

Yet two days more, and then I am betrayed) Mat. 26 2

The Jews consulted at the Council Board, Mat. 26 3
Mar. 14 2
Luke 22 2

Safely and secretly to take the Lord. Mat. 26 4

Because they feared, if they should apprehend him Mat. 26 5

During the feast, the people would defend him.
From Satan then comes Judas, and demands, Mat. 26 14
Mar. 14 10

What they would give, to have him in their hands. Mat. 26 15
Luke 22 4

And when they told him fifteen crowns should pay him, Mat. 26 16

The Chamber, where I mean to sup with you. Luke 22 11

He 'l have you to an handsome upper room; Mar. 14 15
Luke 22 12

Get all things ready there [against I come.]
They going (as they were by Jesus bid) Mat. 26 19
Mar. 14 16
Luke 22 13

Just so found every thing, and so they did.
16.
And when the time (at evening) came, the Lord Mat. 26 20
Mar. 14 17
Luke 22 14

Sat down (with his Apostles) at the board.
I have (said he) desired earnestly, Luke 22 15

With you to eat this Lamb, before I die.
For I shall never eat thereof again, Luke 22 16

Before that I (your passover) am slain.
Then blessing the preparatory cup, Luke 22 17

He drank to them, and bad them drink it up. Luke 22 18

And now (before the Feast, and) ever he died, Joh. 13 1

His endless love to them he signified.
(For though betrayed and slain, he knew he should Joh. 13 2

Return to God, and might do what he would.) Joh. 13 3

Rising from supper (almost done) he tied Joh. 13 4

A Towel on, and laid is coat aside.
And having filled a basin, he began Joh. 13 5

To wash and wipe the feet of every man.
But when he came to Peter, Is it meet Joh. 13 6

(Said Simon) that my Master wash my feet?
Thou know not (said Jesus) what I do
At present, but thou shall hereafter know.
Still he refused, till Jesus said, Let be, Joh. 13 8

Or else thou have no interest in me.
Let hands and head and all be washed (said he) Joh. 13 9

Rather than lose my interest in thee.
He that returns (said Jesus) from a bath, Joh. 13 10

(Save of his feet) no need of washing has.
So ye already (for the main) are clean, Joh. 13 11

All but that one -- I know the man I mean.
Then sitting down again, he said, Do You know Joh. 13 12

What my intention is in doing so?
Ye call me Lord and Master, as it is meet. Joh. 13 13

If I your Lord and Master wash your feet, Joh. 13 14

Then follow my example, do so too; Joh. 13 15

Each other serve, as I have served you.
By you such service should be less abhorred: Joh. 13 16

The servant is not greater than his Lord.
Each other love (this precept I renew) Joh. 13 34

Each other love, as I have loved you.
This badge of mutual love will make it plain Joh. 13 35

To all the world, to whom ye do retain.
Do then your duty, and be blessed: but yet Joh. 13 17

One whom I chose, is far from doing it. Ps. 41. 9.

For (as the Psalmist says) he eats my bread, Joh. 13 18

And (like a beast) kicks him by whom he is fed.
I tell you now, that when ye see the event, Joh. 13 19

Then ye may know that I Am omniscient.
And (for the rest) whosoever receives you, Joh. 13 20

Receives me and him that sent me too.
Then was he troubled in his mind, and said, Mat. 26 21
Mar. 14 18
Luke 22 21
Joh. 13 21

By one of you I am to be betrayed.
This troubled them, and each began to cry Mat. 26 22
Mar. 14 19
Luke 22 22
Joh. 13 22

(Doubting of whom he spoke it) Lord is it I? Luke 22 23

It Is one oth' twelve (said he) I go indeed Mat. 26 23
Mar. 14 20

To suffer, as it is written and decreed:
But woe to him by whom this thing is done; Mat. 26 24
Mar. 14 21

'Twere good for him to have never seen the Sun.
Then Judas also asked him, Sir is it I? Mat. 26 25

Well, well (said he) I 'll tell thee by and by.
Now there was leaning upon Jesus breast Joh. 13 23

One that was more beloved than the rest:
Therefore to him did Simon Peter make Joh. 13 24

Some signs, to ask, who 'twas of whom he spoke.
He did: and Jesus [softly] said, It Is he, Joh. 13 25

Whom next thou see receive a sop from me.
Jude then received the sop, and Satan bent Joh. 13 26

Judes mind more firmly on his dire intent.
Iscariot (said he who all things knew) Joh. 13 27

Do quickly what thou do intend to do.
Now others knew not what he meant; but thought Joh. 13 28

He would have festival provision bought;
Or that he should give something to the poor: Joh. 13 29

For Judas kept the bag, that kept the store.
Then Jesus breaks and gives them bread, and says, Mat. 26 26
Mar. 14 22
Luke 22 19

This is hence forth my Body: feed by faith.
I am your Passover: when this ye do,
Think of my being broken thus for you.
The cup of blessing then he blessed, and gave them Mat. 26 27
Mar. 14 23
Luke 22 20

That Symbol of the Blood that was to save them.
This is the blood that seals the league (said he) Mat. 26 28
Mar. 14 24

With every one that does believe in me.
This wine's the last, that I shall ever taste, Mat. 26 29
Mar. 14 25

Until we 're past to joys that never waste. Ps. 113, etc.

Now let us sing our Hallel, then we 'l go Mat. 26 30
Mar. 14 26

Towered yonder garden, as we use to do. --
I see that Judas (with his sop) is gone. Joh. 13 30

And now the Father glorifies his S^n,
Immediately and of himself, the rather, Joh. 13 31

Because the Son so glorifies the Father. Joh. 13 32

Children, I Am going, where ye cannot find me: Joh. 13 33

I leave you (as I told the Jews) behind me.
Whither (said Peter) do thou go? Where thou Joh. 13 36

(Said He) shall follow after, but not now.
For now (before this present night is ended) Zach. 13. 7.
Mat. 26 31
Mar. 14 27

On my account ye will be all offended:
As in the Prophet Zachary it is written,
The Sheep are scattered and the shepherd smitten.
But after I am risen (ye shall see) Mat. 26 32
Mar. 14 28

I Will go before you into Galilee.
Simon, the Devilish has leave to have you boulted? Luke 22 31

But I have prayed, that, though thy faith be jolted,
It may not quite be overthrown: and then Luke 22 32

When thou 'rt recovered, help the other ten.
I Will follow thee (said Simon) to the end: Mat. 26 33
Mar. 14 29
Luke 22 33
Joh. 13 37

Nor jail, nor death it self shall me offend.
Nor death it self? said He: thou shall not twice Mat. 26 34
Mar. 14 30
Luke 22 34
Joh. 13 38

Hear the Cock crow, till thou deny me thrice.
But stoutly he, and all the rest, replied, Mat. 26 35
Mar. 14 31

They never would deny him, though they died.
Before (said he) I sent you forth, it is true; Luke 22 35

And did miraculously succor you:
But now (whatever shift ye make) provide Luke 22 36

And arm your selves for this tempestuous tide.
For (as Isaiah says) I must be killed: Is. 53. 12.
Luke 22 37

Those prophesies are all to be fulfilled.
Behold (said they) two swords are here at hand. Luke 22 38

Well, well (said he) ever long you 'll understand.
Let not your heart be troubled, neither grieve: Joh. 14 1

Believe in God, and so in me believe.
Good store of mansions at my Fathers are: Joh. 14 2

Your places there I 'm going to prepare.
Then I 'll return, and take you unto me; Joh. 14 3

That where I am, there ye may also be.
Whither I go, ye know; the way ye know: Joh. 14 4

[For I have told you of it long ago.]
Thomas replied, the place we do not know: Joh. 14 5

How should we then the way that leads thereto?
I am the way, the truth, and life (said He) Joh. 14 6

None comes to the Father but by me.
In knowing me, ye know the Father too: Joh. 14 7

In me the Father has appeared to you.
But grant (said Philip) that we may behold Joh. 14 8

His glory [as the Prophets did of old.]
So long have I with you been conversant, Joh. 14 9

And art thou still (said he) so ignorant?
Believ'st thou not that He and I are one? Joh. 14 10

His words are spoke by me his works are done.
Believe me that we both one essence make: Joh. 14 11

Or else believe me for the works own sake.
If ye believe, ye shall do more than I, Joh. 14 12

Because the time of my departure's nigh.
Ask in my Name aright, it shall be done: Joh. 14 13

Thus God is glorfyed in his Son. Joh. 14 14

Only to this beloved Son approve Joh. 14 15

(By your obedience) your unfeigned love,
And then (at my request) he will (I know) Joh. 14 16

The everlasting Comforter bestow:
That Spirit of all truth, whom all the rest Joh. 14 17

Nor see nor know, by you alone possessed.
I leave you not like helpless Orphans here, Joh. 14 18

But to your comfort I will soon appear;
Though not to all the world. Know that in me Joh. 14 19

Your life is hid to all eternity.
That I and God are one, then shall ye know:
Then shall ye know, that you and I are so. Joh. 14 20

Us and our love we mean to manifest,
To him whose love is in his life expressed. Joh. 14 21

How will thou (said the other Judas then) Joh. 14 22

Appear to us, and not to other men?
Because (said Christ) his love is thus expressed, Joh. 14 23

Us and our love we thus will manifest.
Who loves me not, he keeps not my words:
Mine, did I say? they are indeed the Lords. Joh. 14 24

These things I tell you (ever I go) in sum: Joh. 14 25

But when from us the Paraclete is come,
All needful truths he 'l clearly teach you all; Joh. 14 26

All that ye have forgotten he 'l recall.
My peace I give you; and I give it so, Joh. 14 27

That all the world can no such peace bestow.
Let not your heart be troubled, neither fear; Joh. 14 28

For I intend to come again, ye hear.
So go to him who is so far above me,
Ye would be glad sincerely did ye love me.
I tell you now, that (when the event ye see) Joh. 14 29

It may confirm your faith in him and me.
I shall not say much more: now comes the Devil, Joh. 14 30

The worlds great Prince; but finds in me no evil.
Yet I submit; that all the world may know Joh. 14 31

I love and serve my Father, Let us go.
17.
I am the real Vine: my Fathers care Joh. 15 1

Makes all true boughs of mine more clusters bear.
But every fruitless branch he takes away: Joh. 15 2

And ye are pruned by what you 've heard me say. Joh. 15 3

Abide in me, and I in you: no fruit Joh. 15 4

Is born by those that leave the stock and root.
I am the root and stock, the boughs are ye; Joh. 15 5

In me you 're fruitful, fruitless out of me:
Like outcast withered branches, that are good Joh. 15 6

For nothing but afford the fire food.
But keep in me, and keep my words; ye may Joh. 15 7

Be sure that God will hear you, when ye pray.
My Father's honored, when much fruit ye bear: Joh. 15 8

And men will say, These His Disciples are!
Such as the Fathers love to me has bin, Joh. 15 9

Such mine has been to you; remain therein.
Therein ye shall remain, do but my will; Joh. 15 10

As I do his, and am beloved still.
These words I sprinkle now [like drops of dew]
To cherish and increase my joy in you.
This is my will, As I [your elder Brother] Joh. 15 12

Have loved you, so love ye one another.
Father than this the love of more extends,
That one lay down his life, to save his friends. Joh. 15 13

My friends are ye, while doing as you are bidden.
The Masters mind from servitours is hidden: Joh. 15 14

But unto you (as unto friends) have I
Clearly revealed the Gospel-Mystery. Joh. 15 15

I chose you to it: [my spirit being in you] Joh. 15 16

You 'll bear such fruit, shall evermore continue.
Pray in my name, and so be heard above. Joh. 15 17

And (as I said before) each other love.
If unto you the world does hatred show, Joh. 15 18

It hated me before it hated you.
Because I chose you out oth' world, is shown Joh. 15 19

Its hatred; for the world would love its own.
Ye must be served like me: observe that word, Joh. 15 20

The servant is not greater than his Lord.
They 'll use you so, for bearing of my name; Joh. 15 21

Because they know not him from whom I came.
Had I not acted like to God, and spoke Joh. 15 22

As no man could, their sin had had some cloak: Joh. 15 23

Now all pretense is gone; now all may gather, Joh. 15 24

That hating me, they plainly hate my Father.
But so it is written; and as David was, Joh. 15 25

So I am hated now, without a cause.
But when ye shall that Advocate inherit, Ps. 35. 19.
Joh. 15 26

And when I send you down Truths Holy Spirit;
He Will plead my cause [against this age accursed,] Joh. 15 27

By you that have been with me from the first.
I tell you now, with what ye are to meet; Joh. 16 1

That so ye may not startle, when ye see it.
They 'll cast you from their Church, and think they do Joh. 16 2

Service to God by sacrificing you.
And this, because nor God nor me they know: Joh. 16 3

Remember (when it is come) I told you so.
I told you not so much before, for then Joh. 16 4

I being with you, bore the rage of men.
But now I am ascending up on high: Joh. 16 5

And none enquireth, whither it is, or why.
Why should that sorrow overwhelm your heart? Joh. 16 6

It Is for your benefit that I depart.
For (the truth is) I must receive my Crown,
Before I can the Paraclete send down. Joh. 16 7

But when he 's come, to all the world he 'l show
Both sin and Righteousness and Judgment too. Joh. 16 8

First he 'l convince them of Iniquity,
In their rejecting and condemning me. Joh. 16 9

You 'll see my Righteousness by him defended, Joh. 16 10

When (and because) I 'm risen and ascended.
He 'l prove me Lord and Christ, because I bring Joh. 16 11

Both them to Judgment, and their captived King.
More should I say, but that your ears are dull: Joh. 16 12

That Spirit shall instruct you to the full.
Not of himself, he 'l have it all from me: Joh. 16 13

By him I 'll send the gift of Prophecy. Joh. 16 14

For what the Father has, may be applied Joh. 16 15

All unto me: and thus I 'm glorified.
I shall be gone a little while, and so Joh. 16 16

Revisit you a while before I go.
But what he meant by this, they greatly doubted; Joh. 16 17

And whispered among themselves about it. Joh. 16 18

I know ye would (said Jesus) very fain Joh. 16 19

Ask me to make that later sentence plain.
Ye shall indeed (while others laugh) lament; Joh. 16 20

But soon your lamentation shall be spent.
The Mothers pangs create her grief and fear; Joh. 16 21

But when she sees her Child, her joys appear.
At my depart ye morn: I 'll come again, Joh. 16 22

And fill your heart with joy that shall remain.
Question me then no more: whatever ye want, Joh. 16 23

Ask in my Name, and God shall surely grant.
You Have asked nothing yet for Jesus sake: Joh. 16 24

Ask and receive, and of my joys partake.
My speeches now seem dark, but then your eyes Joh. 16 25

Shall clearly see the greatest mysteries.
'Sue in my Name, when unto God ye 'sue: Joh. 16 26

For (over and above my prayers for you)
He loves you himself: for He does see, Joh. 16 27

How ye have loved and believed in me.
From him I came, to visit mortal men: Joh. 16 28

From mortal men I go to him again.
Nay (they replied) thou speak plainly now: Joh. 16 29

No mortal man does know so much as thou.
Thou can resolve our doubts, though we were dumb: Joh. 16 30

Thou do (we know) from God Almighty come.
Indeed (said Jesus) is your faith so strong?
You 'll every one be scattered ever it is long, Joh. 16 31

And leave me thus (retiring to your own:) Joh. 16 32

But God is with me still I 'm not alone.
Observe my words; in me ye shall have peace: Joh. 16 33

But in the world your troubles will increase.
Yet courage take: shall my Disciples droop?
I 'll quickly make their adversaries stoop.
18.
Then (in their presence) He divinely prayed, Joh. 17 1

And lifting up his eyes to Heaven) He said,
Now Father glorify and perfect me,
That I (through all the world) may honor thee;
And (by the power which thou to me have given) Joh. 17 2

Bring all thy chosen children unto heaven:
By making it appear that thou alone
Art God in truth, and I thine only Son.
For this is life that never shall have end, Joh. 17 3

Jehovah and his Christ to comprehend.
Here am I glorifying of thy Name, Joh. 17 4

And finishing the work for which I came:
Grant me that glory which I had with thee Joh. 17 5

[As Lord of glory] from eternity.
I have revealed thee to these, that were Joh. 17 6

Thine own elect, committed to my care:
They kept thy word, they have believed in me, Joh. 17 7

And are persuaded that I came from thee. Joh. 17 8

For these thus given me is my request, Joh. 17 9

For these thy chosen ones, and not the rest.
All thine by choice, are by redemption mine; Joh. 17 10

And (to my glory) made more fully thine.
I leave them in the world, and come to thee: Joh. 17 11

Keep them, O Lord, in perfect unity.
I (in thy Name) have kept them hitherto: Joh. 17 12

(Ones falling off was written long ago.)
These things I speak before I come to thee, Joh. 17 13

That they may still rejoice and trust in me.
They (by my doctrine) have been alienated Joh. 17 14

From all the world; and therefore are they hated.
I pray not yet to have them taken hence: Joh. 17 15

From worldly evils grant them thy defense.
Nor they nor I are of the world: O Lord. Joh. 17 16

Hallow them through thy truth, to wit, thy word: Joh. 17 17

So fit them for this ministry of mine, Joh. 17 18

As I my self was sanctified for thine.
For them I offer up my self; I bleed, Joh. 17 19

That they may thus from filth and guilt be freed.
Nor do I pray for these alone, but all Joh. 17 20

Whom thou by these intendest for to call.
As we are one, let them be one in us: Joh. 17 21

They 'll soon convince the world, united thus.
Thus let them glory, to be one with me; Joh. 17 22

As it is my glory, to be one, with thee.
Unite their hearts in perfect love, that so Joh. 17 23

Thy love to me and them the world may know.
Let them be (Father) where I am, to see Joh. 17 24

Thy glorious and eternal love to me.
The world knows not, these know from whom I came: Joh. 17 25

To these I have, and will declare thy Name.
Thy love to me let them (O Lord) inherit: Joh. 17 26

And let me dwell within them by my Spirit.
19.
By this he was to Kedron River come Mat. 26 36
Mar. 14 32
Luke 22 39
Joh. 18 1

(By which King David fled from Absalon) 2 Samuel 15. 23.

And (with the eleven) having past the same,
To the Garden at Gethsemane they came.
Pray here (said he) and watch, that so ye may Luke 22 40

Avoid temptation: yonder I must pray.
Then went he further in, attended on Mat. 26 37
Mar. 14 33

By Simon Peter and by James and John.
And (having left the other eight behind) Luke 22 41

To these he showed the anguish of his mind.
A deadly horror fills my Soul (said He) Mat. 26 38

You that beheld my glory, watch with me. Mar. 14 34

Which being said, from them he went alone
(As far as usually they cast a stone)
And falling down he said, Almighty God, Mat. 26 39
Mar. 14 35
Luke 22 42

If it be possible, withold thy rod:
But if it be thy pleasure, as I cam' Mar. 14 36

To do thy will, so here behold I am.
From Heaven then a Menssenger appeared, Luke 22 43

To strengthen him against the things he feared.
Then coming to the three (though charged to keep Mat. 26 40
Mar. 14 37

Themselves awake) he sound them fast a sleep.
Sleep ye (said he) and have not thou the power
(Peter) to watch thy dying Lord an hour? Mat. 26 41
Mar. 14 38

Watch ye, for fear the tempter should prevail:
For (though the Spirit would( the flesh is frail.
Then Jesus went and prayed as before: Mat. 26 42
Mar. 14 39
Luke 22 44

And then his pangs increased more and more.
So that his sweat fell from him (as he stood
In that great Agony) like drops of blood.
Must I (said he) O Father, drink this Cup?
Thy will be done, I Will freely drink it up.
Again he found them fast; so heavy they
With sorrow were, they knew not what to say. Mat. 26 43
Mar. 14 40
Luke 22 45
Luke 22 46

The third time then he went again, and prayed
Unto the same effect as has been said. Mat. 26 44

And finding them asleep, sleep on (said he)
It Is now too late for you to succor me. Mat. 26 45
Mar. 14 41

Rise up however, rise, come, come away:
He Is just at hand, who does my Soul betray. Mat. 26 46
Mar. 14 42

20.
Behold, there came (while yet he spoke the words)
A multitude with links and clubs and swords, Mat. 26 47
Mar. 14 43
Luke 22 47
Joh. 18 2

By Council-order and by Jude conducted, Joh. 18 3

And with his traitrous signal thus instructed, Mat. 26 48
Mar. 14 44

Take notice whom I kiss, for that is the man;
Take, and as well secure him as ye can.
Then stepping up to Jesus he presents
Himself whith matchless graceless impudence; Mat. 26 29
Mar. 14 45

Master (said he) all hail and happiness,
And gave his Lord the usual sign of peace.
My friend (said Jesus) what is the end of this? 2 Samuel 20. 9.
Mat. 26 50
Luke 22 84

Do thou betray me with a Joab-kiss?
Then went he towered the band that Judas brought, Joh. 18 4

Demanding of them what or whom they sought.
And they made answer that they came to find Joh. 18 5

Jesus of Nazareth, and him to bind.
I am the Man, said Jesus. At the sound Joh. 18 6

They staggered back, and fell upon the ground.
They rallied; and He asked them once more, Joh. 18 7

Whom seek ye? And they answered as before.
Jesus replied, I told you, I am He: Joh. 18 8

And I command you then let these go free.
(Thus had he said before, from God I have Joh. 18 9

Received these, and these I mean to save)
Then said the Apostles to him (when they saw Mar. 14 46
Luke 22 49

The Soldiers take him) Master, shall we draw?
And straitway Peter laid about him so, Mat. 26 51
Mar. 14 47
Luke 22 50
Joh. 18 10

That one's right ear was severed (at a blow)
Clean from his head (and Malchus was his name,
Who from his Master Cai'phas thither came.)
Simon (said Jesus) sheath thy sword again: Mat. 26 52
Joh. 18 11

All they that use it rashly, shall be slain.
Should I but ask my Father, he would send me Mat. 26 53

Angels (above twelve legions) to defend me.
But how shall then the Scriptures be fulfilled,
That say I must be taken thus and killed? Mat. 26 54

My own good Father offers me the cup,
And shall I then refuse to drink it up?
So far (said Jesus to his guard) permit: Luke 22 51

And touching Malchus' sear, he healed it.
But why (said he) with swords and staves, as if Mat. 26 55
Mar. 14 48
Luke 22 52

Ye came to search for some notorious thief?
You let me teach in public: but the power Mar. 14 49
Luke 22 53

Of darkness reigns now (in this your hour:)
And thus the Scriptures are accomplished. Mat. 26 56

Then the Disciples left him all, and fled. Mar. 14 50

(There followed Jesus and the company Mar. 14 51

A certain youth [in probability
Raised by the noise, and coming forth it hast]
Had nothing but his linen over him cast:
And when the soldiers laid their hands on that, Mar. 14 52

With them he left it, (and away he gat.)
21.
To Annas then (with Jesus bound they pass: Mat. 26 57
Mar. 14 53
Luke 22 54
Joh. 18 12

And Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas Joh. 18 13

(His Son in Law) who once this counsel gave, Joh. 18 14

That one man's death should all the people save.
Thither he went: for there the Sanhedrim Joh. 18 24

(Or greatest part thereof) expected him.
Come Jesus (then said Cai'phas) and declare, Joh. 18 19

What thy Disciples and thy Doctrines are.
I always taught (said Jesus) openly: Joh. 18 20

And therefore ask my Auditors, not me. Joh. 18 21

With that a Sergeant gave the Lord a cuffe, Joh. 18 22

And asked him why his answer was so rough.
If it be ill (said Jesus) witness so: Joh. 18 23

If it be well, why gave thou that blow?
False witness were then sought out [and fee'd:] Mat. 26 59
Mar. 14 55

Though many came, not any two agreed. Mat. 26 60
Mar. 14 56

Two men at last deposited on oath, Mat. 26 61
Mar. 14 57

He said (within the hearing of us both)
Gods Temple I 'll demolish, and I 'll raise) Mar. 14 58

A far more stately fabric in three days.
Which was a thing that Christ did never say: Mar. 14 59

Nor was it enough to take his life away.
What say thou to this (said Cai'phas then) Mat. 26 62
Mar. 14 60

What mean the words of these two honest men?
No answer? By that Glorious Name let us know, Mat 26 63
Mar. 14 61

If thou be Christ (the Son of God) or no.
I am (said Christ) and that you 'll one day see, Mat 26 64
Mar. 14 62

When clothed I am with might and Majesty.
Oh blasphemy! (said he, and rent his clothes) Mat 26 65
Mar. 14 63

What need have we of any further oaths?
What think ye Sirs? You hear't as well as I. Mat 26 66
Mar. 14 64

They all replied, The man deserves to die.
Then was the Lord abused by every one: Mat 26 67
Mar. 14 65
Luke 22 63

By some his very face was spat upon.
Blind folding him they smite him, and demand Mat 26 68
Luke 22 64

If their Messiah could detect the hand.
And many other things as blasphemous Luke 22 65

They spoke against the King of glory thus.
22.
Now Peter followed Jesus at a distance: Mat 26 58
Mar. 14 54
Luke 22 54
Joh. 18 15

And when he was admitted (by the assistance
Of an acquaintance there) he there attended, Joh. 18 16

To see how this great busness would be ended.
Then came the maid that let him in, and said, Mat 26 69
Mar. 14 66
Luke 22 55
Joh. 18 17

Thou followest this Jesus (I Am afraid.) Mar. 14 67
Luke 22 56

But he denied Him before them all Mat 26 70
Mar. 14 68
Luke 22 57
Joh. 18 18

With whom he sat and warmed him in the hall.
Just as the first Cock crew, another maid Mat 26 71
Mar. 14 69
Luke 22 58

Beheld him going towered the Porch, and said,
This fellow's one of them. But Simon swore, Mat 26 72

He never saw the Man in's life before.
And after that (about an hour) the men Mat 26 73
Mar. 14 70
Luke 22 59
Joh. 18 25

That stood about him, challenged him again:
Through all the land (said they) may thou be known,
To be a Galilean by thy tone.
Nay was it not (said Malchus Kinsman) thou, Joh. 18 26

Whom in the Garden I beheld but now.
Then he began himself to curse and ban, Mat 26 74
Mar. 14 71
Luke 22 60
Joh. 18 27

If he had any knowledge of the Man.
Then crew the second Cock: then Jesus sent Mar. 14 72
Luke 22 61

A look that made his very heart relent.
Then he remembered the prophesy, Mat 26 75
Luke 22 62

And (going out a doors) wept bitterly.
23.
When it was day, the whole Assembly sat; Mat 27 1
Mar. 15 1
Luke 22 66

About his death more fully to debate.
And Jesus being brought, they bad him show, Luke 22 67

Whether he were the very Christ or no.
If I demonstrate it (said he) I know, Luke 22 68

You 'll neither be convinced, nor let me go.
But (to your cost) you 'll find it, when I stand Luke 22 69

In power exalted at my Fathers hand.
Why, art thou then the Son of God? said they. Luke 22 70

I am (said he) as you your selves do say.
What need (say they) of witnesses have we? Luke 22 71

Our selves have heard his doubled blasphemy.
24.
Then they arose, and led him unto Pilate; Mat. 27 2
Luke 23 1 John 18 28

But (to preserve their persons undefiled
And fit the Paschal-feast to celebrate)
They went not in, but tarried at his Gate.
Then thither came the Governor, and said, Joh. 18 29

What crime (ye Jews) to this man's charge is laid?
Were he (said they) not highly criminal, Joh. 18 30

We 'ld not have brought him to the Judgment-hall.
He does seduce the nation, to disown Luke 23 2

Caesar, and would erect himself a throne.
But Jesus held his peace, and would afford Mat. 27 12
Mar. 15 3

To these notorious untruths not a word.
Do thou not hear (said Pilate) what they say, Mat. 27 13
Mar. 15 4

And what offenses to thy charge they lay?
But still in innocence he held his peace: Mat. 27 14
Mar. 15 5

Whence Pilates wonder did the more increase.
Judge him (said he) by your own law. We may Joh. 18 31

(The Jews replied) take no man's life away.
(He said before hand how he ought to die: Joh. 18 32

For thus the Jews do never crucify)
Then Pilate took him in, and said art thou Mat. 27 11
Mar. 15 2 John 18 33

That King to whom Judea ought to bow?
This for thy self (said Jesus) would thou know? Joh. 18 34

Or as my crime, did others tell thee so?
Am I a Jew? said he; thine accusation Joh. 18 35

Proceeds from thine own (the Jewish) nation.
What have thou done? what have thou said against 'em?
What have thou done, that thus thou have incens'd'em?
Jesus replied, My Kingdom's not from hence: Joh. 18 36

Else would my subjects fight in my defense.
Art thou a King then? (he replied) I am, Luke 23 3 John 18 37

And for this purpose to the world I cam',
To testify the truth: and they that bear
Love to the truth, my testimony hear.
What Is truth? said he; and went and told the Jews, Luke 23 4
Joh. 18 38

The man is faultless, whom ye thus accuse. Luke 23 5

But they were fiercer then, and said that he Luke 23 6

Raised tumults from as far as Galilee.
From Galilee? said Pilate; ye must go Luke 23 7

To Herod then; for he is in Town, ye know.
They went: and glad was Herod that he came; Luke 23 8

For Herod had already heard his fame,
And hoped to see some wonder. But the Lord Luke 23 9

(Though questioned much) vouchsafed him not a word.
There stood the Jews and earnestly accused him: Luke 23 10

While Herod (with his Officers) abused him,
(Clothing him with a Royal Robe, and then Luke 23 11

Bad his accusers have him back again.
Thus the two Governors forget their feud, Luke 23 12

And thus their old acquaintance was renewed.
25.
Then Pilate called them all, and thus began; Luke 23 13

As a Seducer you accuse this Man: Luke 23 14

I have examined him; but neither I,
Nor Herod, think the man deserves to die. Luke 23 15

After some blows (then) let him be releast Mat. 27 15
Mar. 15 6
Luke 23 16

(As custom goes) in honor of your feast. Mar. 15 7
Joh. 18 39

Still let us keep that custom (they replied) Mat. 27 16
Mar. 15 8
Luke 23 17

But as for him, let him be crucified. Mar. 15 9
Luke 23 18

Here Is Barabas (said he) that murderer, Mat. 27 17
Mar. 15 10
Luke 23 19
Joh. 18 40

That rebel, thief; which will ye now prefer? Mat. 27 18
Luke 23 20

They (by their envious Rulers being pressed) Mat. 27 19
Mar. 15 11
Luke 23 21

Replied, We reckon Barabas the best. Mat. 27 20
Mar. 15 12

How so (said he) did Jesus ever do so? Mat. 27 21
Mar. 15 13
Luke 23 22

I 'll have him soundly whipped, and let him go. Mat. 27 22
Mar. 15 14

Then being scourged, the soldiers (out of scorn) Mat. 27 2^
Joh. 19 1

Decked him with purple and a Crown of thorn: Mat. 27 27
Mar. 15 16

And (for a Scepter) put a reed in's hand, Mat. 27 28
Mar. 15 17
Joh. 19 2

And bowing said, Hail King of Jury-land. Mat. 27 29
Mar. 15 18
Joh. 19 3

They spat upon him, with the cane they smote him; Mat. 27 30
Mar. 15 19

And (in that habit) forth again they brought him. Joh. 19 4

Behold (said Pilate) how the man is used: Joh. 19 5

To pleasure you, the man is thus abused.
If nothing will content you but his death, Joh. 19 6

Take him your selves and stop his harmless breath.
We have a Law (said they) he ought to die; Joh. 19 7

He made himself the Son of God most high.
Then Pilate (hearing that) was more afraid, Joh. 19 8

(And taking Jesus in again) he said,
Tell me the house to which thou do belong. Joh. 19 9

But (being free to die) he held his tongue.
What, not a word (said Pilate) do thou know, Joh. 19 10

That I can crucify or let thee go?
Thy power all (said Jesus) over me Joh. 19 11

Were none at all, did God not give it thee:
And they sin more that put me in thy hands.
Then Pilate sought the more to loose his bands. Joh. 19 12

But the Jews cried, If Him thou let go
That made himself a King, thou 'rt Cesars foe.
He durst hold out no longer after that: Joh. 19 13

So on his solemn judgment seat he sat'.
(By this 'twas more than ten a clock at least, Joh. 19 14

And on this day they kept the Paschal-feast.)
Behold your King! said Pilate. They replied,
Away with him! let 's have him crucified.
Pilate rejoined again, Unseemly thing! Joh. 19 15

What, would ye have me crucify your King?
Whereat the Chiefest answered, We own
Tiberius for our King, and him alone.
(Now Pilate from his wife had thus been warned, Mat. 27 19

Be not at all with that just man concerned:
For in a dream have I been troubled so
Because of him, I know not what to do.)
And when he saw he could effect no good. Mat. 27 24

But that they raged like some obstructed flood;
He washed his hands, and said, The blood that is spilt
Draw not on me (but on your selves) the guilt.
So we pray too (said they) his blood shall be Mat. 27 25

Both on our selves and our posterity.
So they prevailed: and so the sentence past, Mat. 27 26
Mar. 15 15
Luke 3 23

That he which into Prison had been cast Luke 3 24

For murder and sedition, should be free; Luke 3 25

And Jesus should be hanged on a tree.
Then did the Lord endure full many a scoff: Mat. 27 31
Mar. 15 20

And after that they took the purple off.
26.
Then Judas (being pricked in conscience) went Mat. 27 3

And told the Priests that now he did repent,
That ever he betrayed his Master thus. Mat. 27 4

See thou to that (said they) what is that to us?
Then throwing down his Soul-entangling pelf, Mat. 27 5

He went and desperately hanged himself: Act. 1. 18. Za. 11 13

[And in so tragical a manner fell he,
That all his bowels tumbled from his belly.]
This is the price of blood (said they) and so Mat. 27 6

Within the treasury it may not go.
What shall we do? -- The Potters plat we will buy, Mat. 27 7

And there the strangers carcasses shall ly.
Hence was it after called the field of blood. Mat. 27 8

And hence may Zachary be understood;
I asked my wages of the Jews, and they Mat. 27 9

(For all my pains) did thirty shekels weigh:
At Gods command (because it was so small) Mat. 27 10

Unto the Potters heap I cast it all.
27.
Then led they Jesus (whither they desired) Mat. 27 32
Mar. 15 21
Luke 23 26
Joh. 19 16

Bearing his cross [till he himself was tired.]
To help him then they forced a certain man, Joh. 19 17

Whose name was Simon (a Cyrenian.)
There followed him a very numerous crowd: Luke 23 27

And (for his sake) the women wept aloud.
Weep for your selves (said Jesus) not for me: Luke 23 28

Weep for your selves and your posterity.
The days are coming, when ye shall declare Luke 23 29

Those women happy that did never bear:
When men shall wish the mountains of the land Luke 23 30

Would fall and hide them from the woes at hand.
If they do this to one so green as I, Luke 23 31

What shall be done to them that are so dry?
28.
With him they also led two persons more, Luke 23 32

That were condemned a little while before.
And when they came as far as Calvary Mount Mat. 27 33
Mar. 15 22
Luke 23 33

(Between elev'n and twelve, as now we count)
In stead of cheerful wine, they thought it fitter, Mat. 27 34
Mar. 15 23

To give him drink that was both sour and bitter:
But he refused that grief augmenting cup.
29.
Then on the cursed tree they lift him up, Mar. 15 24
Joh. 19 18

Between those two that were to die for theft,
One on the right, and the other on the left.
Thus it was said (and therefore thus 'twas done) Mar. 15 25

Among transgressors he was numbered one. Mar. 15 26

Father (said he) forgive these things unto them, Mar. 15 27
Luke 23 34

Because (poor Souls!) in ignorance they do them. Mar. 15 28

30.
Four soldiers then his other clothes divided; Mat. 27 35
Joh. 19 23

But whose his Coat should be, the lot decided, Psa. 22. 18.

(Because it had no seam:) as does appear Mat. 27 36
Joh. 19 24

Foretold by David. And they watched him there. Mat. 27 37

31.
The reason of his death his title shows, Mat. 27 38
Luke 23 38
Joh. 19 19

Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.
In Latin, Greek, and Hebrew it was writ: Joh. 19 20

So Romans, Greeks and Jews perused it.
But these requested Pilate not to use Joh. 19 21

So positive a term as King of the Jews;
But that he said, I am their King. My hand Joh. 19 22

(Said Pilate) wrote it so, so shall it stand.
32.
Then was the Lord reviled by all that came: Mat. 27 39
Mar. 15 29

[But he endured the Cross, despised the shame.]
Thou that can pull the Temple down (said they) Mat. 27 40
Mar. 15 30

And rear't again so soon, come, come away,
So said the Jewish Rulers, Can n't he save Mat. 27 41
Mar. 15 31

Himself, as well as call a man from grave?
Let Isreal's King now leave the Cross, and see, Mat. 27 42
Mar. 15 32

If any man believe so soon as we.
He hoped his Father (as he said) would save him: Mat. 27 43

Let him his Son deliver, if he 'l have him.
One of the thieves (too) railed upon him thus, Mat. 27 44
Luke 23 39

If thou be Christ, then save thy self and us.
But the other quickly took him up and said, Luke 23 40

Does not Gods justice make thee more afraid?
For we deserve our punishment; but this, Luke 23 41

This man has done not any thing amiss.
O Lord (said he to Jesus) think upon Luke 23 42

Thy servant, when thou 'rt seated in thy Throne.
This very day (said Jesus) shall thou be Luke 23 43

Partaker of that Paradise with me.
33.
Amongst those friends of his that durst appear, Mat. 27 55
Mar. 15 40
Joh. 19 25

His Mother (with some others) ventured near. Mat. 27 56
Mar. 15 41

And when he saw her mourn, he looked on John, Joh. 19 26

And bad her look upon him as her Son.
To John he said, That Mother dear of mine, Joh. 19 27

Let her hence forward be accounted thine.
One being thus bequeathed to the other,
John to his house received her as his Mother.
34.
No sooner on the Cross was Jesus nailed, Mat. 27 45
Mar. 15 33
Luke 23 44

But darkness over all the Land prevailed.
This horrid sight the Sun abhorred to see.
And his his light from noon till after three.
At three his hellish torments made him cry Ps. 12. 1. Ps. 66 21.
Mat. 27 46
Mar. 15 34

Eli, Eli, Lama Sabachthani?
He calls for Elias (then said some) Mat. 27 47
Mar. 15 35

What? will Elias to redeem him come? Mat. 27 48
Mar. 15 36

Then Jesus (to fulfill that prophecy) Mat. 27 49
Joh. 19 28

Signified to them that he was adry.
A sponge (with vinegar) was therefore stuck Joh. 19 29

Upon a stick, and given him to suck.
He tasted it, and said, Now all is done: Joh. 19 30

Father receive the Spirit of thy Son. Mat. 27 50
Mar. 15 37
Luke 23 46

So soon as ever he had spoke almost,
He bowed his head and yielded up the Ghost.
35.
Then was the Temple veil rent quite asunder: Mat. 27 51
Mar. 15 38
Luke 23 45

Then shook the earth; then roared the rocks like thunder
Then many Graves were opened, and from those Mat. 27 52

(When he himself was risen) Saints arose,
And entering into the Holy City, there Mat. 27 53

To many Holy Persons did appear.
And then the Captain (seeing what was done) Mat. 27 54
Mar. 15 39
Luke 23 47

Confessed He was Jehovahs Holy Son.
And all the people (filled with remorse) Luke 23 48

To their respective places turned their course.
36.
This evening was the Sabbath-preparation: Joh. 19 31

And (to prevent that high days profanation)
The Jews desired that the soldiers might
Break all their legs, and so dispatch them quite.
The soldiers did (as Pilate gave command) Joh. 19 32

And brake the legs of those on either hand.
But Jesus having yielded up his Soul, Joh. 19 33

His legs (and all his bones) remained whole.
Yet with a spear a soldier pierced his side, Joh. 19 34

And from his heart did blood and water glide.
Which, he that saw't, avoucheth to be true; Joh. 19 35

That so he may confirm the faith in you.
For thus the Lord fulfilled the word he spoke, Ex. 12. 46. Zach. 12. 10.
Joh. 19 36

A bone o 'th' Paschal Lamb shall never be broke.
And in another place it is foretold, Joh. 19 37

Him whom they pierced, shall the Jews behold.
37.
Now Joseph (who before had feared the Jews) Mat. 27 57
Mar. 15 42
Luke 23 50
Joh. 19 38

His love to Jesus manifestly shows.
(Among the Jews great Council he was one, Luke 23 51

But yielded not to what the Jews had done.)
He boldly went to Pilate, and did crave Mat. 27 58
Mar. 15 43
Luke 23 52

His leave to put the body in a Grave.
First Pilate wondered at his sudden death Mar. 15 44

[When as his bones were never meddled with:]
But when he heard the Captain also say it, Mar. 15 45

He gave the body unto Joseph straight.
Who (bringing linen for the purpose bought) Mar. 15 46
Joh. 19 39

With Nicodemus (who had also brought
Of Myrh and Aloes an hundred pound)
Came, and (in fun'ral-wise) his body wound. Mat. 27 59
Luke 23 53
Joh. 19 40

Now Joseph's tomb (where never corpse was put) Mat. 27 60
Joh. 19 41

Was from a Rock (within his garden) cut.
And there (in haste) they did his body lay, Joh. 19 42

Because it was the Preparation-day. Luke 23 54

Magdalen (and some other women) staid Mat. 27 61
Mar. 15 47
Luke 23 55

Observing where and how the Lord was laid;
And then returning, bought more spice and ointment:
But kept the Sabbath, after Gods appointment. Luke 23 56

38.
Upon which day the tender-conscienc'd Jews
To Pilate went with this important news. Mat. 27 62

That grand Impostour Jesus used to say,
The third shall be my Resurrection-day. Mat. 27 63

Therefore (said they) let us have a Guard till then;
Lest they should say, He Is risen up again, Mat. 27 64

When they have stolen him: and that (at last)
Far worse will pester us, than what is past.
Well, go (said he) you can but ask and have; Mat. 27 65

Use all the means ye can, to keep the Grave.
So they secured it, not with men alone; Mat. 27 66

But set the Public Seal upon the stone.
CHAP. 7.
. 1.
THose women (in pursuit of their intent Mat. 28 1
Mar. 16 1
Luke 24 1 John 20 1

I'embalm the Lord) the Sunday light prevent.
But e'et they were arrived at the place, Mar. 16 2

The Sun begun to show his golden face.
Who shall remove (said they) this massy stone? Mar. 16 3

And when they looked, already that was gone. Mar. 16 4
Luke 24 2

For (with an Earth quake) had an Angel done it, Mat. 28 2

And [as the watchmen said] he sat upon it.
His clothes and looks the lightning did resemble; Mat. 28 3

Like apsen leaves he made the keepers tremble. Mat. 28 4

And in a deadly fright (poor men) they run, Mat. 28 11

To make the Jews acquainted what was done. Mat. 28 12

The chief Priests bribed them well, and bad them say,
That while they slept, some stole the Corpse away. Mat. 28 13

They gave consent for coin; and that report Mat. 28 14

Currently went among the common sort. Mat. 28 15

2.
The women therefore entered into the tomb, Luke 24 3

And there found nothing but an empty room.
Then ran they back to Peter and to John, Joh. 20 2

And said, the body of the Lord is gone;
But where he is laid we know not. So those two. Joh. 20 3

Went out [with them] to see if that were true.
Peter and John ran both [i'th' fields] together, Luke 24 12
Joh. 20 4

But John (out stripping him) came foremost thither;
And saw the linen clothes. Then Peter came, Joh. 20 5

And (entering in) took notice of the same; Joh. 20 6

And saw the cloth wherewith his head was tied, Joh. 20 7

Not with the rest, but by it self aside. Joh. 20 8

Then John went in, and said, the case is plain:
(Not knowing how the Lord should rise again.) Joh. 20 9

3.
So these returned (with wonder) to the town: Joh. 20 10

But there went Mary weeping up and down.
And entering in again, two Angels there Mar. 16 5
Luke 24 4
Joh. 20 11

At head and feet (where Christ had lain) appear. Joh. 20 12

They asked her why she wept. And Mary said, Joh. 20 13

Because I know not where my Lord is laid.
Woman (said they) take courage; for your Lord Mat. 28 5
Mar. 16 6
Luke 24 5

Is risen again, according to his word; Luke 24 6

As (ye remember) he had often said: Mat. 28 6
Luke 24 7

And seek ye not the quick among the dead.
But go, tell Peter and the rest, that He Mat. 28 7
Mar. 16 7
Luke 24 8

Intends to meet them all in Galilee.
4.
And as they turned them towered Jerusalem, Mat. 28 8
Mar. 16 8
Joh. 20 14

Jesus incognito appeared to them.
He asked her what she ailed. She answered, Sir Joh. 20 15

(I do suppose thou art the Gardener)
If thou removed'st Jesus, show him me;
I 'll put him where he may not trouble thee.
Mary! (said he) all hail. At that same word Mat. 28 9
Mar. 16 9
Joh. 20 16

Mary cried out, Rabboni ('it is my Lord:)
And (with the rest) fell down before his feet,
To render him that honor as was meet.
I'embrace me now (said Jesus) do not stay, Joh. 20 17

There Is time enough before I go away;
But go and tell my Brethren what ye see, Mat. 28 10

And that I 'll meet them all in Galilee:
That to my God and Father as I go,
So to their God and Father, let them know.
Then full of fear and joy they ran, to bring Mar. 16 10
Luke 24 9
Joh. 20 18

Those pensive Souls the news of every thing. Luke 24 10

But they believed they were but idle fant'sies, Mar. 16 11
Luke 24 11

Or rambling feminine extravagancies.
5.
That afternoon there traveled two of them Mar. 16 12
Luke 24 13

Towr'd Emmaus (which from Jerusalem Luke 24 14

Was six or seven miles) and talked about Luke 24 15

Those very passages that now fell out. Luke 24 16

Jesus (unknown) over took them, and would know, Luke 24 17

What they discoursed about, and sighed so. Luke 24 18

Art thou the only man (said Cleophas)
That know not what lately came to pass? Luke 24 19

What Is that? said he. How Jesus (they replied) Luke 24 20

That mighty Prophet has been crucified.
We thought it had been He that should have broke Luke 24 21

From Isreal's neck the heavy Roman yoke.
And (more than this) three days has he been dead. Luke 24 22

Our women also made's astonished.
For having been this morning at the tomb, Luke 24 23

And finding not his body there, they come,
Saying that Angels did appear most plain, Luke 24 24

And told them that he was alive again.
So some of us that saw the corpse was gone, Luke 24 25

Yet saw not him, [and Angels met they none.]
What fools are ye (said he) how slow of heart
To credit what the Prophets did impart!
For ought not Christ to suffer first all this, Luke 24 26

And enter then within his glorious bliss?
Beginning then at Moses, he explained Luke 24 27

All that the Word (concerning him) contained.
6.
When they arrived whither they were bent, Luke 24 28

He made as if he farther would have went.
But they constrained him, saying, Night is near, Luke 24 29

Abide with us: and so he tarried there.
And as they went to eat, he took the bread, Luke 24 30

And (having given thanks) distributed.
Then were their eyes unsealed, and from their sight Luke 24 31

(When he was thus revealed) he vanished quite.
Did not our hearts within us burn (said they) Luke 24 32

While he was preaching to us by the way?
7.
So rising up, to the College straight they went, Mar. 16 13
Luke 24 33

Intending to declare this strange event.
They found them cloistered up for fear of the Jews,
And ever they could relate, received news: 1 Cor. 15. 5.
Luke 24 34

How that the Lord was risen, and had been
Undoubtedly of Simon Peter seen.
Then they declared, what had been said and done; Luke 24 35

And how the Lord in breaking bread was known.
While some believed not, behold the Lord Luke 24 36
Joh. 20 19

A public plain apperance did afford. Luke 24 37

For standing in the midst of all, he said, Luke 24 38

Peace be among you -- Wherefore are y' afraid?
See, feel my hands and feet: have Ghosts (I trow) Luke 24 39
Joh. 20 20

Such flesh and bones as I have? surely no. Luke 24 40

Hard-hearted men! why did ye so despise Mar. 16 14

The words of them that saw me with their eyes?
And while they yet believed not (so great Luke 24 41

Was their transported joy) he asked for meat,
And there he ate before them [in a dish] Luke 24 42

Part of an honeycomb and broyled fish. Luke 24 43

These things I spoke (said he) before I died: Luke 24 44

These things are done, because they are prophesied.
You understand it now, sure now it is plain: Luke 24 45

Christ ought to suffer thus, and rise again. Luke 24 46

This you must testify; and here begin 1. 2. 3.
Luke 24 47

To preach repentance first and pard'n of sin Luke 24 48

(Through Jesus Name) to all men. And again, Joh. 20 21

Receive my peace, my peace with you remain.
As I was sent, so send I you; bequeathing
My Spirit unto you by this my breathing. -- Joh. 20 22

Or loose, or bind offenses in my name;
And heaven remits or else retains the same. Joh. 20 23

8.
But Thomas now (called also Didymus)
Was absent, when the Lord appeared thus. Joh. 20 24

I 'll not believe 't (said Thomas, when they told him) Joh. 20 25

I 'll not believe 't, till I my self behold him:
Until I feel the wounds he did receive
Both from the spear and nails, I 'll not believe.
Now Thomas on the next Lords day was there, Joh. 20 26

And then did Jesus first again appear,
When all the doors were bolted (as before.)
My peace (said he) be with you ever more.
Bring now thy finger (Thomas) and draw near, Joh. 20 27

Feel thou the wounds were made by nails and spear,
And be not faithless. Thomas then cried out, Joh. 20 28

My Lord and God! [no longer do I doubt.]
Ah Thomas! (said the Lord) but blessed is he, Joh. 20 29

That shall believe, although he does not see.
9.
His third more public apparition was Joh. 21 14

Hard by the waters of Tiberias. Joh. 21 1

Peter (and half a dozen more) had sought Joh. 21 2

All night for fish, but not a fish had caught. Joh. 21 3

Next morning Jesus stood upon the Land; Joh. 21 4

But who it was, they did not understand.
Children (said He) what vict'les have ye caught: Joh. 21 5

They answered, none. Then try another draught,
You 'l find (said Jesus) on the right hand side. Joh. 21 6

And when they cast, his words were verified
With such a shoal, they could not pull them out.
Peter (said John) it is Jesus out of doubt. Joh. 21 7

Then Peter girt his coat about his waste,
And into the Sea he cast himself for haste.
The other followed in the Ship, and handed Joh. 21 8

The net along (for quickly were they landed)
And (to their great astonishment) they spied Joh. 21 9

A fire with fish upon 't, and bread beside.
Bring some (said Jesus) of your new-caught store. Joh. 21 10

So Peter went and drew them quite a shore.
An hundred fifty three great Fish: and yet, Joh. 21 11

So great, so many never brake the net.
And when he bade them come and dine, not one Joh. 21 12

Durst ask him who he was; as being known.
Then in his hands he took the fish and bread, Joh. 21 13

And (as his manner was) distributed:
Simon (said Jesus, after they had eat) Joh. 21 15

And is thy love to me so very great?
Simon replied, Thou know my love to thee.
If it be so, then feed my Lambs (said he.)
But Simon, do thou love thy Lord indeed? Mat. 26. 33, 75.
Joh. 21 16

Indeed (said he.) My sheep (said Jesus) feed.
But Simon, do thou love me more than these? Joh. 21 17

(This repetition did not Simon please)
Omniscient Lord (said he) my love to thee
To thee is known. Then feed my sheep (said He.)
When thou wast young, thou girt'st thy self about, Joh. 21 18

And (at thy pleasure) walkedst in and out:
But when thou 'rt old, shall others stretch and bind,
And carry thee, full sore against thy mind.
But thus shall God be glorified in thee. Joh. 21 19

[Take up my Cross:] come now and follow me. Joh. 21 20

Then Peter turning back saw John come too: Joh. 21 21

O Lord (said he) and what shall this man do? Joh. 21 22

Follow thou me (said Jesus:) what if he
Shall tarry till I come? what is that to thee?
Then did this fame among the Brethren fly Joh. 21 23

(By a mistake) that John should never die.
That John whose pen describes the eternal word, Joh. 21 24

And does (we know) the very truth record.
And many more great Miracles were done, Joh. 21 25

That could not be recorded every one. Joh. 20 30

(For if a man should so exactly write,
The Volumes would be almost infinite) Joh. 20 31

These plainly prove that He Is the Son of God,
Whose Name gives life without a Period.
10.
Then met above five hundred on that Hill 1 Cor. 15. 6.
Mat. 28 16

In Galilee, according to his will.
And when they saw him, they adored him there: Mat. 28 17

(But some still thought a Spirit did appear.)
All power's mine (said He to his eleven) Mat. 28 18

All power's given me, both in Earth and Heaven.
Go therefore and Disciple first the Jews; Mat. 28 19
Mar. 16 15

Then to the Gentiles preach this welcome news.
And when they take this Covenant of mine,
Seal't with the common purifying-sign:
Wash in the name of Father and of Son,
And of the Holy Ghost [which three are one.]
All that I bad you do, to them commend: Mat. 28 20

Lo, I am with you, even to the end.
No less than life or death eternal must Mar. 16 16

Depend on their believing or distrust.
They shall work miracles, who [first] believe; Mar. 16 17

The gift of languages shall they receive.
By my assistance and authority Mar. 16 18

They shall rebuke the sorest malady.
They shall cast Devils out, take serpents up, Mar. 16 19

And get no harm by any deadly cup.
(And when the Lord was glorified, they wrought Mar. 16 20

These very signs, to stablish what they taught.)
11.
Next, unto James the Lord appeared (says Paul:) 1 Cor. 15. 7.

And finally to his Apostles all. Luke 24 49

For then (upon the fortieth day) with them Acts-

He being assembled at Jerusalem,
The great and glorious mysteries explained, Luke 1 3

Which to his Holy Kingdom appertained:
And strictly charged them also not to leave Luke 1 4

Jerusalem, until they should receive
The promised Baptism of the Holy Ghost; Luke 1 5

And that within ten days (he said) at most.
Lord, will thou then (said they) again restore Luke 1 6

The Kingdom unto Israel, as before?
It Is not for you (said he) to understand
The times reserved in the Fathers hand. Luke 1 7

When y' are endu'd with power from on high, Luke 1 8

Then what y' have heard and seen, that testify;
Not only in Judea, but rehearse
These joyful tidings though the universe.
12.
Then Jesus led them forth to Livet, Luke 1 9

Hard by the place where Bethany was set,
And (lifting up his hands to bless them there)
Ascended through the Angel-crowded air.
At last the Clouds (those curtains of the skies)
His body shadowed from their greedy eyes.
And as they still looked after him, they spied Luke 1 10

Two men in white apparel by their side.
What means (said they) this wondering? what means Luke 1 11

This gazing up to heaven, ye Nazarenes?
This Jesus, whom ye view so took away,
Shall so return to you another day. Rev.

So come Lord Jesus, make no longer stay* Joh. 22 20

Oh come Lord Jesus, quickly come away.
Amen and Amen.
