The Bugle-Bovv: OR, A Merry Match of Shooting.
All you that do love Archery,
I pray you now for to draw nigh,
And you shall hear before you go,
The Shooting in the bugle-bow.
The Tune is, My Husband is a carpenter: or, the Oil of care.


UPon a time it chanced so,
abroad as I did walk,
So secretly, they did not know,
I hard two Lovers talk:
The one a pretty handsome Youth,
the other a proper Maid,
After a salute, they did dispute,
beset with cupid's aid.
With Kisses and with Complements,
he did this Maiden greet.
And courteously he did reply,
O gallant Lady sweet.
A match sweet Lady I would make,
before from hence I go,
If thou with me a part will take,
to shoot in the Bugle-bow.
Alas good sir you are deceived,
no part with you i will be,
I am to young, and skill have none
in any Archery.
Nor never had in all my life,
the truth of all is so,
Nor dare I not for fear of strife,
to shoot in the Bugle-bow.
Lady, I pray you be content,
plead not your tender age,
The Birds do sing in merriment,
though pined up in a Cage.
My love to you, I vow is true,
though none thereof do know,
Do not deny, this courtesy,
to shoot in the Bugle-bow.
Good sir, I thank you for your love
which you do bear to me;
But yet I further mean to prove,
e're I a part will be:
For why, much danger follow may,
for ought that I do know,
If I should yield to you this day,
to shoot in the Bugle-bow.




FAir Lady, I know no danger
that can to it belong;
You know I am no stranger,
then why should you fear wrong?
O yield I pray, make no delay,
but now some favor show;
My part now take, for true-love sake,
to shoot in the bugle-bow.
But when this Damosel she did hear,
her sweet-hearts kind reply,
No longer she could then forbear
his loving courtesy.
Sweetheart, said she, apart i^le be,
ere I from you do go;
I Will draw the string, and fear nothing
to shoot in the bugle-bow.
This Maid bent up her noble Bow,
and strongly drew the String,
Her Game it then so well did go,
it made her for to sing.
But yet the young man played his part
for he three for one did go,
But lost the Game, yet nere the worse
to shoot in the bugle-bow.
But when this Game it ended was,
this Damsel did reply:
Good sir, you see this Game is lost,
you can it not deny.
Therefore I say if you will play
once more before you go,
Your part i will take, and not forsake,
to shoot in the bugle-bow.
That Match sweetheart, it pleases me
I will not it deny;
I see thy skill in Archery,
thou willing art to try.
Thereso ^let's to it once again,
our Archery to show,
Thy part i will take, and not forsake
to shoot in the bugle-bow.
But when the game to ended was,
together this couple went,
Amends this Damosel for to make,
it was his full intent:
And he married her most willingly,
for fear of further woe:
His part she did take, and not forsake,
to shoot-in the bugle-bow.
So to conclude you Maidens fair
that now do hear this Song,
These Lines I have dedicated here,
I hope will do no wrong;
For they were write in merriment,
as well you all may know,
Of a Maid that willingly was bent,
to shoot in the bugle-bow.
