By the King.
A PROCLAMATION For the Prizes of Victuals within the Verge of His Majesty's
Household.
CHARLES R.

WHereas in Our Passages through diverse parts of Our Realm, Necessity requires
that a great number of Our Subjects, not only Noblemen and others attending
Our Service, but others for their necessary occasions, shall frequent those
places where in Our Royal Person We shall resort; and it is requisite that
competent Provision be made, that they be not exposed to the intolerable
avarice of Bakers, Brewers, Inholders, Butchers, and Sellers of Victual, who,
not contented with reasonable Profit in Uttering and Selling of Victual within
Our Dominions, and specially within the Verge of Our Household, will (as We have
cause to doubt) unlawfully Exact and Demand unreasonable and extreme Prizes for
Victuals, Horsmeat, Lodging, and other Necessaries, above the Prizes they were
sold at before Our coming to those parts: Therefore to prevent the extreme
Exaction by the foresaid Victuallers, and others, toward Our Servants, Train,
and Suitors attending Our Court, wheresoever We make Our above, nothing
respecting Our Prerogative, nor the Laws of Our Realm, Our Will and Pleasure
is, and by the Advice of the Lords and others of Our Privy Council, We do
hereby straightly Charge and Command, That all persons do obey and keep all such
Prizes, as is and shall be Prized, Assessed, and Rated by the Clerk of the
Market of Our Household, or his lawful Deputy, upon the Presentment of Jurors,
by virtue of his Office, sworn and charged from time to time, as well within
Liberties as without, within the Verge of Our Household: Which Rates and Prizes
We will, not only shall be certified by Our said Clerk of the Market, or his
Deputy, into Our Compting-house, but also sized and set upon the Gates of Our
Court, and other places within the Verge, as well within Liberties as without;
and that no manner of person or persons, of what Estate or Degree soever he or
they be, do in any wise, ask, demand, take, receive, or pay more for Corn,
Victuals, Horsmeat, Lodging, or any other such thing, then after the rate and
form aforesaid, upon pain of imprisonment, fine, and such further punishment
that shall thereof follow. And moreover We do straightly charge and command, that
no manner of person or persons, now using, or which accustomably have used or
shall use, or of right ought to use, to serve any City, Borough, Town, or other
place where Our Repose or Residence shall be, or elsewhere within the Verge of
Our Household, either within Liberties or without, with any kind of Corn or
Victuals, or other Necessaries, either upon the Market day, or at any other
time, shall be any thing the more remiss or flack in bringing or selling their
Provision, then they or any of them heretofore have been; nor shall use any
color of Craft, either in hiding or laying aside their Corn, Victuals,
Horsmeat, Lodgings, or any other such necessaries whereby the Provision of the
Market may be diminished, or We and Our Servants, and other Subjects should not
be as well served, and as plenteously furnished in every behalf, as it was
before, or of right ought to have been, in defraud of this Our Ordinance. And
furthermore We straightly charge and command all Our Officers of Our Green-cloth,
Our Justices of Peace, Our Clerk of the Market, his Deputy or Deputies, Mayors,
Bailiffs, Sheriffs, Constables, and all other Our Officers of Cities, Boroughs,
Towns, Hundreds, and other places within the Verge of Our Household, wheresoever
the same shall be, as well within Liberties as without, and every of them, from
time to time, when and as often as need shall require, to make diligent inquiry
of Corn, Grain, and other Victual that shall be hidden or withdrawn from the
Markets, with purpose to increase the Prizes, and to cause the same to be put
to sale by the Owners thereof: and upon complaint by any party justly made,
every of them within their Authorities, forthwith shall endeavor themselves to
see just punishment, and due reformation of the Premises, against such person
or persons as shall offend herein, according to Justice.

Given at Our Court at Whitehal, the Twenty sixth day of April, 1662. In the
Fourteenth year of Our Reign.
God save the King.
