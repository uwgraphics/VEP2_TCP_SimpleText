The Declaration of the Lord Fairfax, and others of the Nobility and Gentry of
the North parts of England.
WE being deeply sensible of the grievous Pressures under which we lie, and
the extreme dangers whereunto we are exposed at this time, through the violent
alteration of our Government; the mutilation and interruption of Parliament,
having no Representatives to express or remedy our grievances, have thought it
meet according to the examples of other Countries to Declare and desire, that
if the Parliament begun Nov. 3. 1640. be yet continued, the Members that were
secluded in 1648 (...) forthwith restored to the exercise of their Trust, and
all vacancyes filled up, that right may be done, to their persons, to
Parliaments, and the peoples that have chosen them; if otherwise, that a
Parliament may be presently called, without the imposing of Oaths or
Engagements, the greatest prejudices to Civil or Christian Liberty; or
requiring any Qualifications, save what by Law or Ordinance of Parliament
before the force in 1648. are already established; And until this or one of
these be done, we cannot hold our selves obliged to pay the Taxes that are or
shall be imposeed, we not enjoying the fundamental right of this Nation, to
consent to our own Laws by equal Representatives.

February 13* 1659.
