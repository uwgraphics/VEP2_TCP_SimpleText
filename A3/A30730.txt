The Seventh-day Sabbath the Desirable-Day, The closing completing DAY of that
FIRST Created Week, WHICH Was, is, and will be, the just Measure of all
succeeding Weeks in their successive Courses, BOTH For Working in the six
foregoing DAYS, and for Rest in the Seventh, which is the Last Day, by an
unchangeable LAW of well-established Order, Both in the REVEALED WORD AND IN
CREATED NATURE. The SECOND PART

THE SUMMARY CONTENTS OF THE Second Part OF THIS TREATISE.
ATransition from the First to the Second Part, Page 1, 2, 3 Of the Seventh-Day
p. 3, 4 Q. Whether the Seventh-day, which is the last Day in every Week, in the
weekly Revolutions, and orderly Returns thereof, have been from the Beginning,
and so continued to be all the Old Testament-administration of Grace through,
and be so under the New Testament dispensation of Grace, all along to this Age
of the Church, and will be so to the End of the World, the weekly Sabbath day?
4 The Answer at large given to this Inquiry, is in the Affirmative; that it is
so; from 4 to 149 Under this Answer are diverse particular useful Truths and
Duties opened; As that the Seventh-day was Created for to be the weekly
Sabbath, the last day of the week, being that Seventh, and no other day of the
week so. Thus it was in the Primitive Creation, 4, 5, 6, 7 Which matter is
resolved into a Scripture Determination, 4, 5, 6, 7 That all the Reasons which
Jehovah Aelohim does give for the due Observation of a weekly Sabbath, do
belong to to the Seventh, which is the last day in every week, and to no other
day of the week, as such, 7, 8, 9, 10 That Aelohim rested from his Works of the
foregoing six days of the week, on the Seventh day, as the weekly Sabbath Day.
Which Seventh day Sabbath righteousness in Christ, is that Righteousness which
a Believer is to apply himself to cover his Sabbath-unrighteousness, 7, 8 That
Aelohim Blessed the Seventh, which is the last day in the week that and that
only, and no other day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath day 8, 9 That Aelohim
sanctified the Seventh, which is the last day in the week, that and that only,
and no other day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath Day, 9, 10 That all the
Scriptures through, where the Holy Spirit does speak of a weekly Sabbath Day,
there the name and thing of a weekly Sabbath, is given only to the Seventh,
which is the last day in the week, in the weekly Revolutions, and successive
Courses of it, and to no other day of the week, as a weekly Sabbath Day, Page
10, 11 That no Command is given for the observation of any other day in the
week, as the weekly Sabbath Day, but only of the Seventh, which is the last day
in the week, in the weekly returns of it, 11 to 15 Where is, also further
discovered, that pretended unwritten Institutions, for a First Day weekly
Sabbath, are a false, deceitful, wrong, cooked rule, which we may neither
measure nor walk by, 12, 13 That Christ as Mediator, had it not in Commission
from his Father, to change the weekly Sabbath Day, from the Seventh to the
First, 13, 14, 15 That there is no Promise made to the observing of any other
day in the week, as the weekly Sabbath Day, but only of the Seventh-day, which
is the last day in the week, in the weekly returns of it, 15, 16 That there is
no threatening, all the Scriptures through, either denounced against, or executed
upon, any that shall not observe any other day in the week, as a weekly
Sabbath Day, but only against and upon such as will not observe the
Seventh-day, which is the last day in every week, 16 to 19 That Aelohim bath
put this weekly Seventh-day Sabbath into Created Nature, by a standing
unchangeable Law, 19, 20, 21, 22 Here is declared what is meant by Nature in
Scripture 20, 21, 22 Where also, seeing it is called for by some as an argument
to men, is disoovered, That this particular Seventh-day, which we now count to
be the last day of the week, is the Seventh-day, by the Judgment and Tradition
of such Historical Records, as many are so fond of; although we do bottom our
judgment and practice upon Scripture Revelation, and created Nature, 22, 23,
24, 25 Objections against this Seventh-day Sabbath, are answered, from: 25 to
147 Here is proved, that it was not a seventh part of weekly time, or a seventh
day, But the Seventh-day, the last day in every week, this, and this only is
the weekly Sabbath Day, having a special honor put upon it by Aelohim himself
by notes of Demonstration, by particles, by pronouns, by praepositions, all
significant in their places, to point out the Seventh-day, to be the only
certain, known, determinate, fixed, particular, unchangeable day of the weekly
Sabbath: where the emphatickness of the Hebrew, Ha, is asserted, 25 to 33 It is
further evidenced, that what is in the English Transsation, in seven places of
the New Testament, the first day of the week, is in every one of them in the
Greek, one of the Sabbaths, in propriety of speech, and so its colorable
pretense for a First day weekly Sabbath, is convincingly reprehended, as
Scriptureless; from 33 to 45 That five of these seven places mentioned in the
four Evangelists, relate to the Paschal Sabbaths, and not to the weekly
Sabbath, 33 to 41 That Believers in the times of Christ, and of his Apostles,
before the New Testament was written, could find nothing in all their
Scriptures of the Old Testament for a pretended First day Sabbath, 32, 33 That
in one place, where it is, The first of the Sabbath, this speaks nothing to any
change of the weekly Sabbath, from the Seventh to the First day, but has a
quite another meaning, both in the significancy, and in the intendment of that
phrase, 35, 36. 37, 38 That the weekly Sabbath under the New Testament, is not
barely, or no more than an half-holy-day, between Sun rising and Sun set, but
that it is an whole Seventh-day from Evening to Evening, 38 That Christ's
Redemption Work, as well as his Creation Work, has established the Seventh-day,
to be still the weekly Sabbath day, 39, 40 That Acts 20. 7. is no firm ground
to bottom the pretended First day Sabbath upon, 41, 42, 43 Neither is 1 Cor.
16. 2. 43, 44 That the eleven Disciples did not meet on Christ's Resurrection
Day, as a newweekly Sabbath day, in memory of that Rising, 45 That the weekly
Sabbath, under the new Dispensation, is not left so much in the dark and deep,
as some pretend; but is clearly the Seventh-day in the plain Precept, as of
old, 46, 47 That the true stating of the Matter of right in this Question,
about the weekly Sabbath, does not depend upon Ecclesiastical History, Page 47
to p. 62 That men's cause of erring, of their great erring about this
Controversy (as in many other weighty Cases:) is, because they know not the
Scriptures, nor the Power of God, put forth in a word-way, 48 That the cause of
men's erring, is not therefore, because they do not know and acknowledge, and
own, either the Magistral dictates of Humane Rabbis, 48 Or the Ancient Records
of Vncanonical Church-Histories, and Traditions of men, 48, 49, Or the Councils
of the Sanhedrim, and the sayings of the ancient Fathers, 49, 50 Or unwritten
verities, to be as Scripture Supplements, to be received by the people from
their Leaders, upon trust without trial, 50 Or the judgment, opinion and
practice of of those who are reputed the Learned and the Godly in the present
Age, 50 Or the Natio-al Establishments in the matters of Doctrine and of
Worship, in their humanely invented, and imposed confessions of Faith and
stinted Leiturgies, 50, 51 Or man-invented-Arts and Sciences of Philosophical
Knowledges, and of university humane Learning, 51, 52 Or the innate, or
acquired powers of men's own rational Intellect and Will, 52 Or Natural
Experiments, and fleshy sensations, 52, 53 Or the unscriptural Impulses of
Speculative Enthusiasts, 53 Or the doubtful questioning of unsettled Scepticks,
54, 55 That our Faith is not to be resolved into the Authority of fallible men,
but into the infallible veracity of the truthful Aelohim, 54 to 62 That the Old
Testament Types and Figures did contain New Testament Institutions, as to
particular Churches, Seals of the Covenant, Presbyters, Deacons, Diaconesses,
58, 59, 60 That Revel. 1. 10. Does not prove any change of the weekly Sabbath,
from the Seventh to the First day of the week, 62 to 65 Neither does Psalm 118.
22-26. 65, 66, 67 Neither does Act 2. 1, 2, etc. 67 Nor Ezekiel. 43, 25, 26, 27.
68 Nor Heb. 4. 9, 10, 68 to 145 Here the plain meaning and scope of this
passage in the Epislle to the Hebrews, is given 68. 69, 70 Here is further
shown, that the Day expressed in the ninety fifth Psalm, and referred unto by
the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, is not to be understood of the First
day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath Day, 70, 71, 72 That the rest spoken of
in this, is not meant of the Weekly Sabbath Rest, 72, 73, 74 to 77 Where is
opened the significancy of the Word, Sabbatism in the Graek, (...) towed from
Hebrew Origination, as many other Greek words are, 74 to 77 That the, He,
mentioned in one passage of this part of this Epistle, is meant of the
Believer, 75, 76, 77 That the parallel between Workers, Works and Rest, does
not hold in some things; and where in it does hold, is discovered, 77, 78, 79,
80 Here is shown, what are the works which Believers do rest from, when they
enter into this Sabbatism, 79, 80 The force of the conjunction, For, is shown,
80, 81 As also, what the import of the change of of the number, from the plural
to the singular, is 81, 82 And how this Rest, is both God's Rest, and the
Believers Rest too, 82, 83 Here is further manifested, that it is a mistake, to
go about to found a pretended First day Sabbath upon the New Creation, as if it
precisely began on the Day of Christ's Resurrection, 83 to 145 It is Premised,
that it is a choice Privilege, and a special Liberty, which Believers do enjoy
under the New Testament Administration of Grace, 84, 85 Where also, some
objections that do wrest Galat. 4. 9, 10. and Colos. 2. 8, 16, 17. are
answered, 85, 86, 87 And that the LORD Jesus Christ was Administrator under the
Old, as well as New Testament Dispensation of Grace, 87, 88 The particulars are
here instanced in, What the old things are which pass away, and what the things
are which do become new, 88, 89 to 92 The renewing of the Covenant in the
latter days, is spoken to, 92. 93 That there was a Covenant of Grace under the
Old Testament Administration, is asserted and evidenced from the Scriptures,
Page 93 to page 101 And that the whole of the Christian Religion, for
Doctrines, Graces, Duties, Privileges, and such like parts of that Religion,
is one and the same, under both the Old and New Testament, 101 to 108 And in
what sense the Seventh-day Sabbath is some ways a sign of this, 108 to 116 The
new Worship was Typically signified in the Figuring pattern of the Old. This is
also demonstrated, 116 to 120 And that the Law of Faith was a Law under the Old
Testament Dispensation, 120 to 123 And that it is an error to affirm, that the
Decalogue has less in it than the Law of Nature: At also, that therefore, it
was never intended for a mere or perfect Transcript of the Law of Nature, 123
Under this is discovered, That to this Decalogue it does belong, to believe
that the Soul is, 124 And to love our selves with a just and necessary Love,
124, 125 And to take greatest care to save our souls above our bodies, 125 And
to tame and mortify all our fleshly lusts, in order to our Salvation, 125, 126
And to deny all bodily pleasure, profits, honor, liberty and life, for the
securing of our Salvation, 126 The Old Law of the Ten Words is proved in the
Word of Truth, to be still the same both to Jew and Gentile. It was the Rule of
Obedience to them under the Old Testament, as unto God in Christ; and is still
so a Rule unto us, under the new. Difference of Horizons, and of Climates makes
no change of the Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath, 126 to 147
The Ingenuous Reader is earnestly desired to correct the Errors in Printing,
especially those that do much disturb the sense, and quite alter the meaning.

Errors in the Margin are thus to be corrected in the Second Part.

A TRANSITION FROM THE FIRST to the SECOND PART.
IN this inquiringly-spirited Age, wherein there are such high Pretendings, and
costly attempts, and industrious diligences used to me^^orate Philosophy by
experimental Disquisitions; putting other kinds of Learning upon some natural
Advance, that. Arts may be more artful, and Sciences may be more Scientifick;
there is the louder Call given forth to the ingenious Professors of the
Christian Religion to be upon a spiritual improve of those excelling Knowledges
of this Art of Arts, and Science of Sciences, which has treasured up in it the
most, both mysterious secrets, deep skills, and useful discoveries: Are other
Talents traded withal, and shall this be napkin'd up? Give me a man, who has
attained to an eminent degree, and is still continuedly reaching after, and
pressing toward, larger measures of practical skilfulness how to live over
believed Truths, how to improve Scripture-Convictions, how to fill up Christian
Duties, how to act sanctifying Graces, how to mortify Corruptions, how to
overcome Temptations, how to exercise spiritual Senses, how to bear crosses,
how to enjoy privileges, how to carry on, and to order all the affairs of his
particular lawful Calling in a Scripture-way for Kind, for Principles, for
Rule, and for Ends, how to grow up into the laterday-Glory, how to walk with
God, how to have distinct fellowship with the Father, as the Father; with his
Son Jesus Christ, the Mediator, as such; with the Holy Spirit, as the Holy
Spirit; in their several Offices and Relations: how to pass into such a
mystical membership as may be an Heaven upon earth, how to manifest and
evidence an universal-growing holy-Conformity, both in knowledge and in
obedience to an whole Christ, and to the whole Word of Christ; in short, how to
be really a through Disciple of the LORD Jesus, daily perfecting his
Christianity; bring me such a one, and he shall be the wise man with me, whilst
the vain affecters of humane wisdom may not expect to be advanced to such a
degree in this religious School of Christian Learning. In the First Part of my
endeavors to promote Scripture-knowledges, I went over the Journal or Diary of
the first created week so far as to the end of the sixth day, culling out some
few particular choice instances of Aelohims works in each of those six
foregoing days of that week, reducing them to their true, proper, pure,
primitive, created nature, or being, according to Scripture-Revelation, as an
exemplary Specimen or proving trial for the due advancement of Word-learning by
the most approved and best-fitted means, thereby to discover and to correct
several errors in Paganish Philosophy, to reprove and to reform the lazy
negligence and superficial knowledge of some, to quicken and excite the industry
of others, and to facilitate and direct their studying, that, they may no
longer deter themselves from deeper researches into the incomparably best
science by any appearing difficulties. Having thus my self had a spiritual view
of the created World through a Scripture-glass: put it into the hands of the
discerning Reader for him a while, to delight his eye with the clear prospect
of so beauteous an Object, that might a while withdraw, and feast my thoughts
with sweet meditations upon Jehovah, and upon his word, and his works. See, and
admire, O my Soul, what a glorious structure the wonder-working Creator has
set before thine eyes of Sense, of Reason and of Faith! If thou ascend into the
higher Heaven Revel. 17. 14. and 19. 16. Psalm. 48. 2. Esa. 14. 13, 14, 15. Acts
7. 55, 56. Job 26. 6, 7, 9. and 37. 9, 22. Esai. 6. 1. and 66. 1, 2.
, there above the lower visible world may thou take a pleasant view of
Jehovah, Christ in his human glorified Nature, the King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords, sitting on the glorious Throne of his exalted Majesty, at the right hand
of his Father, negotiating all the weighty affairs of such, more especially,
whom the Father has given unto him! There he continually presents himself
and the All Sufficiency and full satisfactoriness of his sacrifice and
oblation, and the purchases of his passion, and the merits of his death! There
he appears in a Court both of Justice and Mercy, as an Advocate before the face
of God making intercession for thee, that, all procured benefits may be made
effectual for thee! In that highest world, there may thou see, thousand times
thousands ministering before the LORD, and ten thousand times ten thousands of
glorious Angels standing before Him, these with the Spirits of just men
perfectly sanctified, worshipping before the throne of God: and of the Lamb,
where his Servants serve him, and see his face! O my Soul, be thou in the
Spirit with those, doing their work and enjoying their privilege, by improving
a mystical Membership! Lo, there the new four-squared City, Christ's Father's
house, which he is gone before to prepare, that He and His good Disciples may
be together there! Enter in there and take possession of thy mansion! Behold,
above this lower Firmament are the Treasures of Rain and of Dew, of Snow and of
Hail, of all the upper waters! when thou have been there, where thou hopest to
be for ever, come down a while, and let thine Eye glance it self upon the
visible objects of this middle world! see thou the yonder azure expanse! O
what a goodly Canopy has the LORD spread over thy head! observest thou what
glittering spangles the starry studs are, what shining balls the Sun and Moon
are! how glorious is their beauty, how golden are their beams, how operative
their influences? All that vast space of Heavens which my eye can compass, the
Sun, the Moon and the stars these are thine, a Part of thy Portion: how useful
a Creature is that light, by which other visibles are discovered and discerned?
Here may thou see the cloudy bottles and the flying Fowls, Here is the Air in
which thou do breath; step one stair lower now and walk the earth a while. If
thou well observest it in its seasons, in its springing verdure, how lovely
does it appear in it is garnished ornaments and green attire! green! a color
both pleasing and strengthening to the Eye; whereas, if it showed its beauty
only in white, it would dazzle thy fight into a blindness: O what admirable
variety is there here! The grass I tread on, how many are its kinds, of how
great benefit is this: The herbs were made for my use, and they have often
served at my Table, and have been both for food and for medicine: how often
have the flowers perfumed the Air for me, and brought me in their sweetness, in
their way of natural perception taking some kind of delight, that, their maker
has put any thing into them that might be pleasurable to me! How many are the
sorts of Fruit-bearing-trees, and how often have their fruits dropped themselves
to me, and yielded themselves to my gathering, and several of them have
traveled scores, hundreds, and some of them thousands of miles, to visit me,
and to let me know from Christ that much of the end of their being was to find
out my hand and to fill my mouth! How many springs have been flowing, and
Rivers running, and wells filling, to afford me water! How often have I eaten
of the kidneys of wheat, of the finest of the flower! How often have the
well-fed both of the flock and of the herd parted with their lives, to make
meats and feasts for me? What shall I say, how many thousands of hands have
wrought hard for me, who never saw my face, nor knew my name? The Ploughman,
the sower, the reaper, the in-gatherer, the thresher, the winnower, the seller,
the miller, the kneader, the baker; the carder, the spinner, the weaver, the
dyer, the clothier, the tailor, with multitudes of more, and all these, under
my LORD Jesus Christ, my Servants, employed by him for a supplying good to me!
Shall I now dig deep and get into the bowels of this earth? O what a hidden
Kingdom of subterraneous minerals is here! Here are the roots of those Trees,
which have afforded their beams of Timber for my habitation! Here are the
quarries of stone, which have yielded materials to raise up walls for me to
dwell safely within! Here the Colliers dig hard to send in winter fuel to me!
Here the Searchers after the mines, do find out the Tin and the Lead, the Iron
and the Steel, the Brass and the Copper, the Silver and the Gold, which so
often have brought me in some of their necessary Supplies. If I go down to the
Sea, the great and wide Sea, in a Ship, there I may see the works of Jehovah,
and his wonders in the Deeps, in the great waters which are Exodus 20. 4. Deuteronomy.
5. 8. Psalm. 24. 1, 2. Job 11. 9. 2 Pet. 3. 5. Genesis 1. 9, 10, 22.
under the earth. How large and how deep a Subject is there here to swim and to
fail in? There are things creeping innumerable both small and great, there the
Whales, the Sea-dragons do play in the troublesome Deep, at the bottom whereof
is the mire of Depth, where is no standing. And now, my Soul, thy meditations
have led thee to the lowest world, to Hell beneath; a place out of which the
Creator will fetch the glory of his Justice; a place full of terrible confused
darkness, a place of torment. Here I see Job 38. 8, 9, 10. and 10. 21, 22.
the two-leafed-doors, unfolding and opening of themselves before my thoughts,
through which passage, when the damned are entered, these doors do close
themselves over such Job 26. 7. Luke 16. 26. Psalm. 40. 2. Job 33. 22, 24, 30.
Psalm. 16. 10. and 49. 15. Ezekiel. 32, 18-32.
, and they are left to sink and to fall down into the gulphy, empty, space, a
dark, dreadful deep, where are no walls to hang by, nor any stay to rest on,
where the black passengers bound hand and foot are thrown down; being amazingly
surprised with overwhelming horror, full of fears they sink lower and lower
Mat. 16. 18. Job 38. 17. Psalm. 9. 17. and 107. 18. Job 33. 22, 24, 28, 30. Job
17. 16. Luke 16. 23-28. Prove. 15. 11. Mat. 11. 23. Esai 14. 9-15.
, till the bottomless pit of Hell do open its mouth upon them, gaping wide to
swallow them down into a foul and hideous prison, a doleful place where are
yelling Complaints, and howling noises, woeful outcries and frightful shrieks.
Thus have I taken a short view of the manifold mavelous works of Jehovah
Aelohim, as made in admirable wisdom! How ample and large, how clear and
splendid, how illustrious and magnificent is his name in all the earth, who
has given his glorious Majesty above the Heavens! who, or what am I, that, he
has given me such an excellent formation, as to behold and admire, to
acknowledge and confess his incomparable perfections in his gracious words, and
in his glorious works? That, he made me a tongued Trumpeter to proclaim and to
commend his power and skill in so wonderful a Creation? and that he has not
taken me hence, before I left behind me some written, printed, Testimony of his
Royal Excellencies. I was now passing into a Sabbath-enjoyment, as the last and
best day of the Week, to take my sweet repose in him, who formed all these
things, and who had brought forth such a world somewhat for me, vile unworthy
sinful me. But that which was and is, through the Grace of God, an Holy Rest to
me, has been, and is like further to be, through the corruptions of men, a
troublesome Controversy from them. Must I now be made a man of contention, who
have so much desired and endeavored to be a man of Peace! My LORD is going
forth in his comely Honor, riding upon the word of his Truth, and he will
prosper: His Truth is victorious; for this must I be valiant and earnestly
contend in his strength: For this end was he born, and for this cause came he
into the world, that he should bear witness unto the Truth; Every one that is
of the Truth, hears his voice: Happy is he, who has a good report of the
Truth it self.

In the Order of my pursuit after the refining and raising of useful Arts and
profitable Knowledges, I am now led to that day, the Seventh, which is the last
day in the week, wherein Aelohim the Creator himself did Sabbatize; on this day
he rested to contemplate his own Works: For, having now framed and disposed the
glorious Fabric and the goodly structure of the whole Universe; and having put
it into its beauteous ceconomy and regular Polity, he closes the week with a
day, blessed above all the other foregoing days of the Week. The righteous
cause of which sanctified Day I am now to plead, against the many Contenders
against it.

Having thus in a former Treatise, attended, followed and walked with Aelohim
in some of his great Works on the several distinct six foregoing days of this
created World; I am now brought to Sabbatize, and rest with, and in, Him, on
his Weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath. There are diverse profitable Disquisitions that
might be made with respect to the Seventh, which is the last, Day of every
Week; For the advancement of this Holy Art, and for the Improvement of this
Spiritual Science, which would be a great promoting to this useful Learning: As,

Q. Whether every Day of the week be of equal length? Particularly, whether the
Seventh-day, which is the last day in every week, be not longer in time, and
have more minutes in it, than the First day of the week? If the Seventh-day be
found longer in time, it has a concreated Excellency, in nature, unchangeable,
dignoscible to Sense.

Q. Whether (...) be from Shabath, or from Jachab? If from Shabath, there are
many Truths and Duties which that word would clear up, and also demonstrate the
Observation of the weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath before the Promulgation of the
Law of the Ten words at Mount Sinai.

Q. Whether (...) do point out the daily and weekly seasons of created,
instituted time, for daily-evening-and-morning-Worship, and for
weekly-Sabbath-Worship?

Q. Whether (...) and (...) do not in diverse Scriptures set out the Seventh,
the last, day of the Week? and this, in some places, before Aelohims
proclaiming of the Ten words, at Horeb?

Q. Whether, the LORD Jesus Christ, having risen again the Third day according
to the Scriptures, that Third day, be the Full complete Third day from the time
of his burial? and what that particular large day of the week was? and what the
certain hour of that particular large day was, in which He did actually arise?
and what Scripture-evidence there is of this, which is queried, not at all in
the least to question the Truth of his Resurrection, which we firmly believe,
but rather to strengthen our Faith therein, and to promote Scriptureknowledg of
the Doctrine of Christ's Resurrection, upon which the whole of the Christian
Religion does so much depend, and for some other good ends?

For the present there are some weighty reasons, why I do not interpose my own
Apprehensions about these Quaeries, but leave them to those, who are of
studious inquiring Spirits, who by a deeper search into the word of Truth in
the Supplies of the Holy Spirit, may make those Discoveries that will at once,
both convince, and shame the ignorant-mistaking-World: Whilst, for the better
satisfaction of serious seekers after Christ's mind about the weekly-Sabbath, I
shall in a Word-way, through the whole Scripture, where this Case is spoken to
and of, treat of this one Enquiry, returning a plain, and, as I judge, a full
Answer thereunto.

Q. Whether, the Seventh Day, which is the last Day in, and of, the Week, in
the weekly Revolutions and orderly Returns thereof, has been from the
beginning, and so continued to be all the old-Testament-administration of Grace
through, and be so under the New Testament Dispensation of Grace all along to
this Age of the Church, and will be so to the end of this World, the
weekly-Sabbath-day?

A. The Seventh-day, which is the last day in, and of, the week, in the weekly
Revolutions and orderly Returns thereof, has been from the beginning, and so
continued to be all the Old-Testament-Administration of Grace through, and is
so under the New-Testament-Dispensation of Grace, all along to this Age of the
Church, and will be so to the end of this World, the weekly-Sabbath-day. The
whole Scripture is profitable for this Doctrine, and for this Duty.

This closing part of the History of the Creation is express for it. When
Jehovah Aelohim had finished all his Works, relating unto the six foregoing
days of this one week: Genesis 2. 2, 3. Exodus 20. 10, 11. Hebs. 4. 3, 4.
The LORD Christ now on the Seventh-day actually perfected, and will continue
actually perfect in the whole, and in every part of it, His delegated-work,
which he had made (adornedly-really to exist preparedly perfected,) and He did
then Sabbatize, (and his will was, is, and will be, that from thence his people
shall Sabbatize,) (ceasing, resting, from other motion and work of the
forementioned creating kind) In a Day, that Seventh from all his Work, the
which he had made, and he did and will bless (in word and in deed, in a
continued way in the weekly revolutions of it, as long as weeks shall last in
this world) That day, That Seventh, and he did and will sanctify (by severing
it from a common use, and destinating it to an Holy Use, accomodating it to
instituted Ordinances of solemn Worship,) the same, because in it he has
sabbatized, and will Sabbatize, from all his work, the which he had created
(pure without spot or blemish of corruptness or uncomeliness) for to make. This
Seventh is a Number completely perfecting the Week: For, when such a number of
days has filled up the week, then we begin again, with one, second, third,
fourth, fifth and sixth, till it comes to another seventh: And there the Week
in the continued revolutions thereof does, still receive a perfective end. The
Greek Interpreters Genesis 2. 2.
here (as in a many of other Scriptures else where) are Corrupters of the
Hebrew Text, who do translate, in the sixth day, for the Seventh, and their
pretended reason is frivolous, lest the Heathen should think, (mistaking the
phrase) that Aelohim did work upon the Seventh-day Sabbath. Whereas he had
finished the whole, and every part of his creating work upon the several six
foregoing days of this one week of the created world: Only he did that on the
Seventh-day, which was proper Sabbath-Work: As the Mar. 2. 27. The Sabbath was
made. Exodus 20. 11. Hebrew 4. 3, 4. John 5. 17.
making of the Seventh-day, the resting from other Functions upon it to
institute and observe Sabbath-duties, employments and privileges, the blessing
of it, the sanctifying of it, together with his preserving of the Creatures
which he had made on the six foregoing days, and with his and his Fathers
providential working to the upholding of them in their Being. Those who do call
the First day the Seventh day, and the Seventh day the sixth day, making the
First day to be both the First and the Seventh day, and so do alter the names
of the number of all the rest, do invert the Order of nature in the First
Creation: For, although in consistent quantity (such as Extension of parts one
beyond another,) there is not one, second, third, fourth, and so on, or not one
first, and another last, put into the nature of that created Being; because,
these are not really in the confistent Nature thereof; it being consistent
altogether, and so the first part may be the last part, or the last part the
first part, according to men's common notion, and reckoning and appointing of it
to be so, the LORD not having instituted herein any such Order of Numbering,
where we are to begin, and how to go on, and where to end: yet, in quantity
successive, as in duration, and in time, this is of a different consideration,
both in the nature of the thing and in Aelohims institution: For this is really
such in existence, truly subsisting, whether we imagine it or not; neither is
it left in our power to our disposal, to put them into any other Order than the
creating Messaiah has, so far as does respect his established times and his
instituted Seasons: There is one day, a second day, a third day, a fourth day,
a fifth day, a sixth day, and a seventh day, in the several successive natures
and durations of every one of them: Here is part after part by temporary
succession in a most direct line, and in its proper Partitions and terminating
points, by an unchangeable Law, and well-setled-order, of the standing
Creation. The Work of the six foregoing Days Aelohim did rest from (leaving man
an example to follow him herein) on the Seventh-day Sabbath. The Seventh-day is
to be remitted unto Workers, who labored in their several lawful Functions on
every day of the week before; and Exodus 20. 11.
therefore Aelohim blessed this Seventh-day; because, he himself rested on it,
and sanctified it, unto Adam; the Sabbath was made Mar. 2. 27. See Hutterus
Hebrew.
for Adam, for all mankind in him. He has made, he does, he will, make it a
blessed day in its weekly returns unto the due diligent observers thereof, in
obedience to his Command, in obsequiousness to his Will, in Conformity to his
Example, in Faith on his Truth, Power and Promise: For, this Day has he
severed unto his own service along. That Expression Genesis 2. 3. Here is, Him,
This, It; The same, or some such like relative to be understood (as Prove. 3.
27. Eccl. 2. 11.)
, For-tomake, or to-do, does not so appear to belong unto, he had created, as
to relate unto, he will sabbatize, or ceasingly rest. The preceding Hebrew
accent, does somewhat teach this, which does often distinguish; so that, it
signifies that Adam and his posterity ought to do this; to observe the
Seventh-day Sabbath, as holy and consecrated to Jehovah Aelohim, it is their
bounden duty to do the same: The like phrase we find Exodus 31. 10. Deuteronomy. 5. 12.
15. so, to do the Passover, Deuteronomy. 16. 1. Mat. 26. 18. Heb. 11. 28. To do the
feast of Booths. Deuteronomy. 16. 13. (...)
elsewhere in the Hebrew, to make or to do the Day of Sabbath, or the Sabbath:
Which is to observe, to keep, or to celebrate it. The expression is full,
noting, that, that Instituted-Seventh-day-Sabbath-work may not be left undone
for that time, or put off to any other season, either before or after. Having
thus somewhat explained and applied the Expressions concerning the
Weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath in its primitive Creation and unchanged Institution;
I am now to make a little way for the giving the Reader a more particular
distinct full Account, according to the Scriptures of Truth, why I do judge
that the Seventh-day, which is the last day, in every week, in the weekly
Returns of it, is alone that particular peculiar day in every Week, which is
the Weekly Sabbath Day, to be kept Holy unto Jehovah Aelohim, in obedience to
his command, as such, that is to say, as the alone weekly Sabbath Day. If any
man hereafter will engage by Writing or Printing in this Controversy against
me, whereby to endeavor to build up, if he could; his first day, on the ruins
of the Seventh-day Sabbath; let him take notice and remember, that I mention my
Judgment on this (as in other cases) Subject Matter to be according to the
Scriptures of Truth, and that I expect both he and I should submit our Judgment
and Practice unto the Autoritative, decisive Judgment of the Spirit of Christ
in the word of Truth: Those that do resolve such cases of Conscience about Duty
or Sin into other Authorities, do judge, but according to appearance: That
judgment which is John 7. 23, 24. 1 Cor. 10. 15. and 7. 25, 40. 1 Cor. 15. 3.
14. Acts 17. 2. and 18. 28. John 5. 39. Acts 17. 11. Job 6. 25.
righteous judgment is such as is according to the Scriptures: Words of
Rightness, O how powerful are they! As for other arguing it has not that
Efficacy of convincing: Paul's way of reasoning was out of the Scriptures, and
his Method of proving was from the Scriptures; and Apollos took the same course
to convince the erroneous: They are the Scriptures that we are to search, which
those of Berea did daily, even when a Paul was the Speaker to them, which did
evidence them to be a good kind of Christians and Believers. Romans 1. 2. 2 Timothy
3. 15. Dan. 10. 21. John 17. 17. 2 Timothy 2. 15. Romans 15. 4. 2 Timothy 3. 16, 17.
Deuteronomy. 4. 1, 2. Prove. 30. 5, 6. Revel. 22. 18, 19. Deuteronomy. 12. 32. Joh. 20. 30,
31. Gal. 1. 8, 9. 1 Timothy 6. 3, 5. Mar. 7. 7.-13.
These Holy Scriptures are the Scriptures of Truth. The Word of Christ is the
Word of Truth: It is The Truth. If any bring a Doctrine or a Reproof, or a
Correction, or an Instruction, they should have whatsoever things were written
aforetime to be written for these; the whole Scripture must be shown to be
profitable for these, it was given for such an end, That, the Man of God may be
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good Works. We may not add unto the Word
which Jehovah does command us, neither are we to diminish ought from it, that,
we may keep his Commandments, who is the God of his people, which he does
command us. These Holy Scriptures are they which are 2 Timothy 3. 15, 17. Mat. 22.
29. Mar. 12. 24, 27. Gal. 1. 8, 9. 1 Timothy 6. 3, 4, 5.
able to make us wise to Salvation: Though eminent Apostles, or an Angel from
Heaven preach any other Gospel unto us than we have received, we should carry
our selves toward him, as toward one excommunicate: If any; let him be what
he will, though he have never so great a name for Learning and for Religion, do
teach otherwise, and come not up to wholesome Words, the Words of our LORD Jesus
Christ, (these are nourishing healthy food, other words not agreeing with
these, are empty Jerem. 23. 28, 29, 30.
Chass) and to the Doctrine which is according to right Worship, we should
withdraw our selves from such. It has been great encouragement and sweet
satisfaction unto me for diverse years, that I have Christ and his Word, his
Will and his Law for me in this Holy Contest: His ten Words or Commandments,
how perfect and complete, how standing and unchangeable a Rule of life are they
in all and every of the matters of Duty to be performed, and of Sin to be
avoided! Exodus 34. 28. and 31. 18. Deuteronomy. 10. 4. and 4. 13. Psalm. 19. 7, 8, 9.
John 10. 34, 35. Jam. 1. 25. Deuteronomy. 5. 22. Psalm. 119. throughout. Joh. 15. 7,

and 111. 7. 1 Per. 1. 23, 24, 25.
It was Jehovah Christ himself who by his Spirit from his Father wrote upon the
two Tables, the Words of the Covenant, the ten Words or Precepts. This
Scripture more especially (I undervalue not any of the rest, though this have
its signal remark) cannot be broken: This is a perfect Law: These words Jehovah
spoke, and he added no more. Christ would not have us so much as think, that he
came to destroy (to dissolve) the Law; he came not to dissolve but to fulfill.
He confirms it by an high Asseveration, that, till Heaven and Earth do pass,
one Jod or Chirek (one either Consonant or Vowel, or any thing else originally
belonging thereunto) shall in no wise pass from the Law, till all be fulfilled.
Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments (and such do
the most of men count the weekly Sabbath, though misjudgingly) and will teach
men so, he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whosoever
shall do and teach men the same, shall be called Great in the Kingdom of
Heaven. This Law is established: This Law or Testimony is sure, or faithful, or
firm, or constant; it endures for ever, it is standing-abiding, continuing firm
yet, and perpetually. This is the Compare Gal 6. 15. 16. with 1 Cor. 7. 19.

Rule of the New Creature; by this must we walk: This is to be bound up and
sealed among Christ's Disciples: To the Law and to the Testimony must we refer
all our Controversies in Religion for Determination and Resolution. If any
speak not according to this Word, it is because No morning-light is as yet in
them. Here is the full comprehensive of what is our Duty to do: Where (or for
what) no Law is, there is no Transgression (or neither a Transgression) Sin is
not imputed, where is no Law; for, Sin is a Transgression of the Law: Then a
Soul is guilty, when it sins against any of the Commandments of Jehova, in
what ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them. This Law of the
Ten words was put into the Ark, and this alone, and nothing else but this put
there; in which it was so closed, as that it was not to be taken out or
changed, having a Crown of gold, by Jehovah's own appointment, put round about
it. This particular Law of the weekly-seventh day-Sabbath has a special mark of
Exodus 20.-11. Deuteronomy. 5. 12.-15.
remembrance fixed unto it at the very entrance into it. This must not be
forgotten to be kept Holy, and the Works of our particular Functions are
expressly prohibited to be done on it. This Seventh-day must be sanctified, as
the weekly Sabbath of Jehovah our God; because, all and every of those weighty
Reasons, which Jehovah Aelohim, the Lawmakers, the Lawgiver himself has
assigned, and rendered, (and no Reasons can be so demonstrative and convincing
as those which he does give who is only wise,) from whence to enforce and
persuade Obedience to his Command in observing of a Weekly-Sabbath-day Holy to
him, do properly belong and are applicable to the Seventh, which is the last,
day in every Week in Order of time in the weekly returns of it: As the weekly
Sabbath Day, and to no other day of the Week, as such neither to the first,
second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth day Exodus 20.-11. Deuteronomy. 5.-15. Genesis 2. 2,
3. Ezekiel. 46. 1. Luke 13. 14.
. Six days (in the week) we are to labor, and the Seventh day (in the same
week) is the Sabbath: The Seventh-day, the seventh-day, has its peculiar Note
of Honor put upon it Genesis 1. 5, 8, 13, 19, 9. 3, 31. and chap. 2. 2, 3. Ezekiel.
46. 1.
. There can be but one Seventh day in one Week in the weekly Order and
Succession of the Seven days, though each of the other foregoing six days in
the week are one of seven; or one of the seven daily parts of weekly time:
Every one of the other days of the week have another name, as one, the second,
the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth. Only the last day of the week is
called the Seventh day, and the Sabbath day; Weeks will be to the worlds end,
concluded within the compass of Seven days. One of Aelohims Reasons is,
because, he Genesis 2. 2, 3. Exodus 20. 11.
rested upon the seventh day, upon that, and that only, which is the last day
in the week, and upon no other day in the week, as a weekly Sabbath Day. This
History of the Creation does go this day over Genesis 2. 2, 3.
three times, on, or in, the Seventh-day, the Seventh-day, the Seventh-day,
Aelohim rested; and again a second time He rested: Afterward in Moses time, a
little Exodus 16. 23-. 30.
before Christ's Proclaiming of the Law of the Ten words at Mount Sinai, the
Seventh-day, and the rest or Sabbath on it, are several times mentioned, the
Seventh-day, the Seventh-day, the Seventh-day; and a fourth time the
Seventh-day: The Rest of the Holy Sabbath (or a Resting of Holy Rest, for
Sabbath signifies a Rest.) a Sabbath, the Sabbath, the Sabbath, the People
rested on it. Exodus 20. 1 i.
At the Promulgation of this Law, this same Reason is resumed again; For in six
days Jehovah made the Heavens and the Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is,
and rested the Seventh-day, and therefore His people ought to rest on the same
day, as the Holy-Sabbath-day. The Scriptures do carry this further along after
the Promulgation of it. Exodus 31. 14-18. and 34. 21. (and 23. 12.) and 35. 2.
Lev. 23. 3. Deuteronomy. 5. 14.
Six days shall men work, but on the Seventh-day, the Seventh-day, a Sabbath, a
Sabbath of rest, a Sabbath Day, the Sabbath, the Sabbath, Jehovab rested on
this day, and refreshed himself. Six days thou shall work, but on the
seventh-day thou shall rest, thou shall rest. Six days shall work be done, but
on the Seventh-day, there shall be to you an Holy Day, a Sabbath of rest to
Jehovah, the seventh-day is the Sabbath of rest, the Sabbath; the seventh day
is the Sabbath to Jehovah. Thus also in the Jer. 17. 19.-27. Neh. 10. 31. and
13. 15-2^2.
After-Prophets, in Jeremiah's days, Bear no burden on the Sabbath Day, the
Sabbath Day, the Sabbath Day, the Sabbath Day; sanctify the Sabbath Day to do
no Work therein. The Sabbath Day, the Sabbath Day: Thus in Nehemiah's time,
that zealous Reformer would not suffer Ware or any Victuals to be brought to be
sold on the Sabbath Day, on the Sabbath Day, on the Holy Day, the Sabbath Day,
the Sabbath, the Sabbath Day, the Sabbath, the Sabbath, the Sabbath. No burden
shall be brought in on the Sabbath Day, the Sabbath, the Sabbath Day Luke 23.
56. Hebr. 4. 4.
. The New Testament also does take special notice of this: The Seventh-day has
the name of Sabbath or of Rest, given it there, above three^^ore times They
rested (Christ's followers were silent from the Works of their particular
Functions) the seventh-day. The Seventh-day God did rest, the seventh-day from
all his Works. None of all this is said of any other day of the week.
Particularly not of the first; and therein the LORD Jesus Christ is the great
Exemplary Pattern for his Disciples to imitate and to follow, he rested on that
Seventh-day; and therefore his people must also rest on the same seventh-day.
Exodus 20. 8-11.
Thus he himself does argue. He was Genesis 2. 1, 2, 3.
the First-seventh-day-Sabbath-Observer, and under all the several
Administrations of Grace, He called upon his People to do the same. In the days
of his flesh here on earth after he was born of the Virgin Mary Luke 4. 16, 31.
Mat. 12. 1, 2, etc. Mar. 2. 23, etc. Luke 6. 1, etc. and 13. 10, 15. John 5. 9,
etc. Mar. 1. 21. and 3. 1, 2, etc. Luke 14. 1, etc.
, he through the Weeks of his life yielded Obedience unto this Command, by
keeping the Seventh-day, as the weekly Sabbath Day, and no other day in the
weekly return, as such: And this was, and is a part of that perfect
Righteousness, which every sound Romans 4. 4, 6, 24, 25. Phil. 3. 9. Romans 5. 12^
21. Gal 4 4, 5. Rev. 19. 8. Isai. 45. 23, 24, 25. 2 Cor. 5. 19, 21. Romans 13.

believer does apply to himself, as his Plea of Justification in the sight of
God for his Sin of Sabbath-breaking, and every such believer is 1 Pet. 2. 21,

to conform in Sanctification to Christ in all the Acts of Christ's Obedience to
this Law of the ten words: He, as his Custom was, went into the Synagogue on
the Sabbath Day, and stood up for to read. He taught the people, such as would
give him the hearing, on the Sabbath Days. And whither shall we go to get our
selves clothed with Sabbath Righteousness, but unto him, putting on this Lord
Jesus, and making this Jehovah to be our Righteousness? How can there be such
an apt, proper, distinct, suitable, Sabbath-Righteousness from Christ, applied
to the Soul, but by those who make out after that weekly
seventh-day-Sabbath-Righteousness, which was in its perfection in Christ? Those
that observe any other day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath, cannot so
directly go to Christ for such a days Righteousness, not particularly for the
First-days Righteousness, as to a Sabbath; which First day Christ all his life
through never observed, as the weekly Sabbath. He has left us an example (a
Pattern, a Copy, such as Writing Masters do leave to their Scholars) that, we
should follow his steps. He that says he abides in Christ ought himself also
to walk even as he walked: Because, as he is, so are we in this World, (if we
keep to his Rule and Example, for the Scripture speaks of things as they ought
to be, taking it for granted that they be so, and they are so, so far forth as
Believers do act regularly like themselves, as does become them.) According to
this Pattern we have Act. 13. 14, etc, Act. 17. 1, 2, 3. and 16. 13-16. and 18.
4.
Paul practicing after Christ's Ascension into Heaven, on every Sabbath Day; it
was his Custom and Usage, his constant Practice Compare Luke 4. 16. with Act
17. 2. (...), As it was, so to Christ, so (...)*
, the same Expression, that sets out Christ's continued weekly observing of the
Seventh-day Sabbath that it was usual to him, is affirmed also of that eminent
Servant of his; That, it was also usual to this Paul, O that the same might be
truly testified of more in our Day, of Leaders and of their People, that,
Christ might hold such forth before others and say: Here are they that keep the
Commandments of God, and the Faith of Jesus: The Holy Seed of Christ and of his
Church are such, as keep these Commands of God, and have the Testimony of Jesus
Christ. O the happy Progresses, O the blessed goings on with a strait foot, of
such as do his Commandments!

A Second Reason of his affixing to this Holy Law of the weekly
Seventh-day Sabbath, who is Wisdom essential, Wisedoms, All Wisdoms in one, is
this: For that, Aelohim blessed the Seventh, which is the last day in the week,
that and that only, and no other day of the week, as the weekly-Sabbath-day.
Thus it was from the beginning, and thus it is, and will be to hidden ages of
hidden ages. The blessing is its peculiar Portion, and what is Man that he will
take away this Heritage of Blessing from the Seventh-day to endeavor to settle
it on any other day on the first day particularly, where the LORD himself never
so gave and secured it? Genesis 2. 2, 3.
The Seventh-day, the Seventh-day, Aelohim blessed, the Seventh-day, he has
blessed it, he does bless it, and he will bless it, and it shall be blessed. O
blessed day, which Jehovah himself has blessed; so blessed! This blessing was
afterward renewed, revived, solemnly, openly declared Exodus 20. 9, ^0, 11.
at Mount Sinai, and affixed to the seventh-day: Six days thou shall labor,
but the seventh-day is the Sabbath: In it thou shall not do any work: For six
days Jehovah made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the seventh-day: Wherefore Jehovah blessed that day, that Sabbath, the
blessing is gone forth for this Seventh-day Sabbath irreversibly from the Mouth
of Jehovah Mashiach himself: It has his Applaud and approve for its due
estimation and deserved renown, its noble majestickness and Royal imperialness.
How many are the Prerogatives and Privileges which he has Conferred upon it!
Christ is the Seventh-daies-benedictor and benefactor. This is the day which he
has Dedicated to the Instituted worship and service of Jehovah Aelohim; A day
greatly to be desired and delighted in by his Children, Friends and Servants,
as a day of holy rest, and of Heavenly joy; A day of sweet converse between him
and his Saints: A day that calls upon them for a
singingshouting-triumphing-rejoycing-frame! and therefore there is a peculiar
Psalm. 92. title compared with the rest of the Psalm*.
Psalm fitted for this purpose, to this end: Thus is the Crown of special
Benediction put upon the head of the Seventh-day, and no other foregoing day of
the Week is to share with it in this princely honor. Isai. 56. 1-8 read and
consider, how many special Blessings are here made over.
Isaiah, that evangelical Prophecier and Preacher, has from Jehovah Pronounced
those Blessed even to admiration, (O the happy Progresses, O the happy goings
on of such!) that do keep this Sabbath, and not profane it! They shall enjoy
many a covenant-favour! O how choice Spiritual blessings are there that do
visit the Hearts of Holy observers of this Seventh-day Sabbath! under the
New Testament Administration, O what a Blessed day did Christ make it to be
unto some, whose sick bodies he healed, whose sinful Souls he pardoned, whose
sadned Spirits he comforted; unto whom his Gracious words were converting and
Restoring, teaching and enlightening, quickening and strengthening, whom he met in
Sabbath ordinances, and gave them the Blessing of this separated day! and how
many a Soul had cause to bless the LORD for ever, who so prospered Paul's
labors on the Acts. 13. Acts. 17. Acts. 18.
Seventh-day Sabbath, for blessing, for good to them! Christ taught daily in
the Temple, and Paul was often in the Synagogues on the foregoing days of the
Week, and much good was done thereby, but the whole Scripture does take
peculiar notice of this, That, the Seventh-day as the Weekly Sabbath Day,
carried away the Sabbath-blessings, which no other day in the week did, though
the LORD do bless his People every day, yet not with Sabbath-blessings, but
only on the seventh-day. Aelohim gave a Special Blessing, an appropriated
Blessing, to this day above all the other days. So true and good is that
saying of Christ still, That Mar. 2. 27. (...)
this Sabbath was made for Adam, for Man, for a blessing to him, every way for
his chiefest and choicest good*. It was Christ's counsel to his Dsiciples, Mat.
24. 20.
that, when troublous times would be some years after his Ascending into the
highest Heavens, they would be much in Prayer, that, upon the Enemies Invading
their Land, their flight might not be on the Sabbath, lest they should be
hindered from, or disturbed in the Blessings of that seventh-day, which alone
has the Name of the Weekly Sabbath. Thus is the whole Scripture profitable for
the clearing and confirming of these two Reasons of Christ's Assigning, as I am
now also further to manifest, that, it is so for his third Reason which is
this, because Aelohim sanctified the seventh, which is the last day in every
week, that and that only, and no other day of the week, as the Weekly
Sabbath Day. Thus at the Genes. 2. 2. 3.
First Creation and Institution; the seventh day, the seventh-day, the
seventh-day, Aelohim sanctified it, because, that, in it he had rested from all
his work, which he Created, for to make or to do. He has sanctified this same
seventh-day, he does and he will sanctify it, setting it apart as the only
weekly Sabbath Day, for Spiritual services and for other holy ends, he
segregated it from all profane common employments and usages, and dedicated it
to his own peculiar worship. It was not to be reckoned nor counted amongst
vulgar days, but was to be had and held Isai. 58. 13.
as solemn and sacred, holy and honorable, desirable and delightful. He has
put a difference between this seventh day and other days, by way of
Excellency, in a dignifying manner, by appropriating and ^evering of it in the
special holiness thereof, from ordinary foregoing week-daies, that are but of a
common rank, that it may be singularly filled up as becomes the sanctity or
holiness of it. By this derived or relative sanctity, it is the peculiar
appropriate day of Jehovah ^lohim. He has separated Ordinances for his
separated People on this separated day! O how holy is Jehovahs
seventh-day sabbath on which he would have his Worshippers to be so Holy! All
here, in this History of the Creation is actual and real, Anticipations here,
have no such place as those pretend who would have this sanctification of the
seventh day, as a Weekly Sabbath, to be only in Aelohims Decree and
destination, as if it took not place actually till the proclaiming of the Law
at Mount-Sinai which was above two thousand years after; for, this Scripture,
as others also collated with it, do evidently show that it was thus set apart,
from the beginning of the World from Adams time and so downwards. This History
does treat of Existences, of Beings in their Created nature: As Aelohim rested
on that day Actually, and it was made for Mar. 2. 27. Heb. 4. 3, 4.
Adam and for his posterity for that purpose and end, that he and they might
sanctify it, and that it might be a blessed day to him and to them. The
Creator and maker of days did put apart the seventh-day from all and from
every of other days for peculiar uses and Ends. The Proof is convincing enough
to the Ingenious and unprejudiced, that the sanctification of the
Seventh-day Sabbath, was before the promulgation of it at Sinai: Moses speaks
of it, as of a thing known, using the same reasons and grounds of equity, and
much in the same words, which Aelohim himself used in the proclaiming, and
referring to the first institution of Exodus 16. 23. 30.
laboring on the six fore going days and Sabbatizing on the seventh, where
the seventh day is mentioned four times, and Sabbath, Sabbatism, Rest, Rested,
about six times, declaring, that, in times past, of old, Jehovah had given the
Sabbath for this end, that in it there should be a ceasing from ordinary
Labor, and accordingly the People rested on the Seventh-day Sabbath; at
Mount-Sinai the promulgator of this Law himself delivers his mind to be still
the same in much plainness of speech, Exodus 20. 8, 9, 10, 11.
six days thou shall labor, but the seventh day is the Sabbath, in it thou
shall not do any work, for, six days Jehovah made the Heavens and the Earth,
the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore Jehovah
hallowed the Sabbath day, he sacrated it, consecrated it, sanctified it,
restored it to its holy use, he spiritually distinguished it from the other
foregoing six days of the week: Setting it apart for his more solemn worship
and instituted service: And thus you may carry this sanctification of it
through the rest of the Scriptures that do treat on this subject; for, the
People of God all along were Sabbath-keepers, and Aelohim-worshippers: They
remembered this as that word of memoir and of remark, bringing in this Law upon
their hearts as of special observance. Isai. 56. 2-8. and 66. 23.
The sanctification of the sabbath does set out sometimes, the whole worship of
God; for, where this is duly observed it does promote all other religion; and
it is put Prophetically by Isaiah for the spiritual worship under the New
Testament dispensation; it was instituted to the end, that, solemn service
might be performed to the LORD therein: Lev. 23. 3. 2. King. 4. 23. Mar. 1. 21.
and 6. 2. Luke 4. 16, 17, 31. and 6. 6. and 13. 10. Act. 13. 14, 42, 44. and
17. 2. and 18. 4. Act. 13. 15, 27. and 15. 21. Act. 16. 13, 16. Psalm. 92. title
compared with the rest. Numb. 28. 9, 10. 1. Chron. 23. 31. 2, Chron. 2. 4. and
8. 13. and 31. 3. Nehem. 10. 33. Ezekiel. 45. 17. and 46. 1, 4, 12. 1 Pet. 2. 5.
therefore did his People hold public conventions on the seventh day-Sabbath,
when they assembled to read, to Interpret, and to hear, the word of Jehovah
Aelohim: And these were stated ordinances on every such day: Then they put up
their public requests, and made Prayers to the LORD; they then pleasantly sang
songs to him, they had spiritual conferences, holy Arguings, heavenly
meditations, merciful actings: It being a day of spiritual delight, of heavenly
joy, and of high praising: Then they offered up instituted sacrifices unto him,
to the honor of his name: Which sacrifices now under this administration are
spiritual, glorious, heavenly, accepttable to God by Jesus Christ. Thus, and in
such like holy services is it to be Deuteronomy. 5. 12.
sanctified by us. The Seventh-day Sabbath is therefore said to be Exodus 31.
14, 15. Neh. 9. 14. Exodus 16. 23. Isai. 58. 13. Neh. 8. 9, 10, 11. and 10. 31.
Exodus 35. 2.
holy unto the LORD's People, as it is holy in its Institution, and holy unto
Aelohim.

And now, is it not great and good reason, that these reasons of Aelohims own
giving should have a convincing-cogency, and winning perswasiveness upon our
hearts to yield obedience unto this holy Law of his, which is every way so
designed and fitted for our own Good?

I pass on to some other spiritual proofs of this: After long and serious
search into the whole scripture about this matter, I find, that all the
Scriptures through, where the holy Spirit does speak of a weekly Sabbath day,
there the name and thing of a weekly Sabbath is given only to the seventh,
which is the last day of the week, in the weekly revolutions and returns, and
successive courses of it, and to no other day of the week as a
weekly-Sabbath-day: That, there is no Command given for the Observation of any
other day in the week as the weekly-Sabbath-day but only of the seventh day:
That, there is no promise made to the observing of any other day in the week,
as the weekly Sabbath Day, but only of the seventh day; and that there is no
threatening either Denounced against or executed upon any, that have not
observed any other day in the week, as the weekly-Sabbath-day, but only against
and upon such as observed not the seventh-day as such. If it be thus, then how
nameless, how Commandless, how promiseless, how threatless, is the first day of
the week, as to this matter of the weekly-Sabbath-day? Examine and search we
the Scriptures in this case. All the Scriptures through, where the holy spirit
speaks of a weekly-sabbath day, the name and thing thereof, that is, of such a
weekly-Sabbath-day, is given only to the seventh, which is the last day in the
week, in the weekly returns of it, and to no other day of the week as a
weekly-Sabbath-day. Genesis 2. 2, 3.
On the seventh-day, the seventh-day, the seventh-day, Aelohim Sabbatized, he
Sabbatized. Exodus 16. 23-30.
The seventh-day, the seventh-day, the seventh-day, the seventh-day, the rest
of the Holy Sabbath, a Sabbath, the Sabbath, the Sabbath, the People rested on
it. Exodus 20. 10, 11.
The seventh day is the Sabbath; in it thou shall not do any work. The Deuteronomy. 5.
14.
seventh day is the Sabbath, in it thou shall not do any work. In the seventh
is the Exodus 31. 15. and 35. 2.
Sabbath of rest. The seventh day a Sabbath of Rest. The seventh day Levit. 23.
3.
the Sabbath of rest: Scores of times in the Scripture of the old testament,
the seventh day is called the Sabbath. Several times also in the new Testament,
about threescore times. The LORD Christ himself speaking Prophetically calls it
Mat. 24. 20.
the Sabbath Day. Diverse times in the History of the Act. 13, 24, 27. and 15.
21. and 16. 13. and 17. 2. and 18. 4.
Acts of the Apostles after Christ's Ascension to his Father. Every Sabbath Paul
reasoned in the Synagogue as his manner was. Luke 13. 14.
No other day in the week is called the Sabbath Day. This some of the most
Learned amongst the adversaries of the seventh day, having been convinced of,
and finding their labors fruitless in searching after the name Sabbath to be
given to the first day of the week, which is no where done, they rather oppose
the name Sabbath, as not fit to be used now under the
new-Testament-administration of Grace, as applied to the weekly separated day
for Holy rest and worship; they reject it themselves, that, others too might
the more abhor it, by giving it an ill name, miscalling it, the Jewish-Sabbath:
So that these Enemies themselves being Judges, they confess, that all Churches
do call the seventh day alone, by the old name, Sabbath. It was Heb. 4. 4.
the seventh, this seventh day; (it is double-Articled,) on which God rested
from all his works. Consider further, there is not all the Scriptures through,
any command given for the observation of any other day in the week asthe
weekly-Sabbath-day, but only the seventh which is the last day in the week, in
the weekly return of it. At the first Creation of this seventh day It was
instituted for Adam to do it, and observe it, as the weekly Sabbath day, Thus
before the Law was proclaimed, how long refuse ye to keep my Commandments and
my Laws? Jehovah has given you the Sabbath: Let no man go out of his place
Genesis 2. 2. 3. Exodus 16. 28. 29. 30.
on the seventh day, (for to gather Manna, or to do any other servile work.) So
the People rested on the seventh day. Thus at the time of Promulgation. Exodus
20. 8, 9, 10.
Remember, or to remember, the Sabbath day, to keep it holy: Six days shall
thou labor, and do all thy work, but, the seventh day is the Sabbath of
Jehovah thy God. In it thou shall not do any work: It expresses both a precept
what to do, and a prohibition what not to do. Deuteronomy 5. 12, 13, 14.
Keep the Sabbath, to sanctify it, as Jehovah thy God has commanded thee: Six
days shall thou labor, and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the
Sabbath of Jehovah thy God: In it thou shall not do any work. So express is
this word of the Lawgiver himself. After the proclaiming of this Law, Exodus
23-12. and 31. 13, 14, 15.
six days thou shall do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shall rest.
Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep, said Jehovah, ye shall keep the Sabbath, six
days shall work be done, but, in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest. Exodus 34.
2^.
Six days thou shall work, but on the seventh day thou shall rest: In
Eating-time, or Plough-time, and in Harvest, thou shall rest, during the
Seventh-day Sabbath. If any time had more colouraable plea for working than
other, the Ploughing-time and the Harvest-time were the seasons; the one to
prepare the Ground and to cast in the Seed; the other to reap and gather in the
Fruit and increase. Tillage was necessary for Harvest, Harvest was necessary
for sustenance, yet the holy rest of the Sabbath must not be broken for these.
The prohibition reached in the very letter of it, against these times. Again,
Exodus 35. 1, 2.
these are the words which Jehovah has commanded, that ye should do them, six
days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy
day, a Sabbath of rest to Jehovah. If any handiwork were to be spoken for, as
an exception to this general rule, Tabernacle-work was the work: Compare
Exodus-31. 13. 17. with the foregoing part of the Chapter.
yet this Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath must not be transgressed for the
carrying on of such work for the preparing, finishing, and erecting, of the
Tabernacle, though it were the appointed place under that dispensation of Grace
for the public Instituted worship and service of God. Levit. 19. 3. 30. and
26. 2.
Ye shall keep my Sabbath, again, ye shall keep my Sabbath, and a third time,
in Leviticus, ye shall keep my Sabbaths. the like we have in the Books of the
Prophets, Jerem. 17. 22.
carry not forth any burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day, nor do any
work, but, ye shall hallow the Sabbath day, according as I commanded your
Fathers, said Jehovah by Jeremiah to the People of God in his time, much the
same we have in Ezec. 20. 19. 20. and 44. 24. and 46 1, 2, 4.
Ezekiel, bringing in the LORD thus bespeaking his People, I Jehovah your God;
walk in my statutes, observe my judgments, and do them, and Hallow my Sabbaths.
The same Prophetically in another place, thus says Adonai Jehovah, the gate of
the inner Court that looks toward the East shall be shut, the six working
days, but, on the Sabbath it shall be opened: But, the gate shall not be shut
until the Evening. The Prince shall offer the burnt Offering on the
Sabbath Day. Thus after the return from the Babylonish Captivity, Nehem. 13.
17, 19, 22. Nehemiah, being Lord Deputy, would not suffer any to keep shambles,
or a Fair on the Seventh-day Sabbath, norto do harvest work in harvest-time on
that day.
Zealous Nehemiah reproves the transgressors of this law and Command of the
seventh day-Sabbath, what Evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the
Sabbath Day? I commanded and charged, (says he: This he did in pursuance of
Jehovahs Express command and charge;) that, no burden be brought in on the
Sabbath day, I said unto the Levites, that, they should cleanse themselves, and
come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath Day. The same is mentioned in
Luke 23. 56.
the New Testament, the holy Women had Rested on the Sabbath Day according to
the Commandment. Luke 13. 14.
They, who were no friends to Christ, could yet acknowledge this in the
Principle for the matter of Right, though they misjudged in a matter of Fact,
in point of practice and in a particular Case, there are six days in which men
ought to work, and not on the Sabbath. In obedience to this Law and Command of
Christ it was that Act. 13 14.-44 and 16. 13. and 17. 2. 3. and 18. 4.
Paul preached, and the People heard the word of God on this Sabbath Day, some
years after Christ was Ascended up into Glory. Whither can the Observers of the
First day (as the Weekly Sabbath Day) go to find out Commands in the whole
Scripture for their day? One of the adversaries of the Seventh-day Sabbath, who
appeared in Writing against a Letter of another to him, upon his own desire,
which contained some reasons and Scriptures for the weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath,
He, in delivering his Judgment concerning the First day, upon this Question,
whether there be any Express word for the Institution of the first day of the
week to be observed as the Lord's Day, the day for his Weekly Sabbath? has these
passages; we might say, that, it might be Instituted, though it be not
Recorded, (he means in the Scriptures.) When and where; and again, it is
acknowledged, says he, we have no express word, in so many letters and Words
or Syllables, for the Institution of the First day of seven. And a Third time,
what if it should be said, that he, (that is, that Jesus Christ the Mediator,)
did according to his Power actually change the day, though when, and how, it be
not recorded? And a Fourth time, why might he not Institute this, (he intends
the first,) day, although it be not expressed, when or where, and though it be
not recorded? Observe here, thou who read this with a desire to have the
mind of Christ in this matter: Suppose in the serious tenderness of thy Heart
thou should enquire of this Answerer, whether there be any Institution of
the First day of the week, to be Observed as the Weekly Sabbath Day under the
New Testament, in the Room of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath; and he should
say, there may be an Institution of the First day of the Week as the
Weekly-Sabbath-day, though it be not recorded, Suppose thou should further
ask, when, for the time, might this Institution be, if it were at all? And he
should reply, there might be an Institution, though it be not recorded when for
the time. Put case, thou demand of him further, where, for the Place might this
supposed Institution be? And he should tell thee there might be an Institution
though it be not Recorded, where for the place. Upon this, thou further
propoundest this to him, how is this pretended Institution for the occasion or
manner, that, I might be somewhat Directed in my practice, if it were
manifested to be my Duty to observe the first day, as the weekly Sabbath Day?
To which he should return thee these words: there might be an Institution,
though it be not recorded how for the occasion or manner. Can such answers as
these give thee any Convincing Demonstration or satisfying Evidence? What?
After all thy Trading in Sabbath-Religion will thou at last be sent thou
know not whether, to pretended unwritten verities for thy Religion? Art thou
under any Obligations of Conscience in these matters, to believe further than
what is John 20. 30. 31.
written? Can thy spiritual Appetite 1 Cor. 4. 6.
savor in such Cases, what is not written? As for any other Framed, Fancyed,
Forged, Grounds of Instituting the First day as the weekly Sabbath Day, from
pretended practice of the Apostles for this end, in this, or any other Author I
meet with, or from what other Reasons Conjecturally, unscripturally suggested,
it will be spoken unto in its place: Only here is one part of the
forementioned passage, which I would write somewhat about, lest the force of
the answerers Arguing should be thought to be passed by unobserved, which is
that expression, (according to his Power) whereby the answerer intends, that,
Jesus Christ as Mediator had Power to Change the Weekly Sabbath from the
Seventh which is the last day to the First day of the Week. What Power the LORD
Jesus Christ as Mediator has received, I thankfully acknowledge, and through
Mercy and Grace purchased by him for me, and freely, richly given from the
Father to me, in the supplies of the holy Spirit, I have been for several years
an applyer of, a liver upon, and somewhat an Improver of, though I find great
cause to be deeply humbled, for that, I have put it to no better use. As for
the Power of Christ, considering him as mediator, we have it from his own Mouth
John 5. 22, 27. and 3. 35.
in his life time; that, the Father had given all Judgment unto the Son: That
the Father has given unto Christ Power to do Judgment, because, he is the Son
of Man, that, the Father has given all things into his hand. And a little
before his death, that, John 17. 2.
the Father gave him power of all Flesh: And after his Resurrection, that Mat.
28. 18.
unto him all Authoritative Power was given in Heaven and on Earth. This is my
Faith and my Food: Yet withal it must be considered, that Christ, as Mediator,
was one put into Office by his Father, and sent by him in a delegated Function,
having his proper work assigned him: And thus, his Power was Limited. Let us
search whether the whole Scripture be profitable for this? In the Law of Moses,
Deuteronomy. 18. 15, 18, 19. Acts 3. 22. and 7. 37. compared.
there is a Prophecy, that, Jehovah the Aelohim of his People would raise up
unto them a Prophet, (meaning the LORD Jesus Christ, as is manifest by a
collation of those other Scriptures which do so interpret this,) from the midst
of them, of their Brethren like unto Moses, unto him they were to hearken, and
I, said Jehovah the Father, will give my words into his Mouth, and he shall
speak unto the People, all that I shall Command him: And it shall come to pass,
that, the Man who will not hearken to my words, which he shall speak in my
name, I will require it of him. Remark here: It was the Father who raised up
Christ to this Office of being a Prophet, they were the Fathers words which
were given into Christ's Mouth: and Christ was to speak unto the People all that
which the Father should Command him: They must be the Fathers words, and it
must be in the Fathers Name, that Christ was to speak. To this Clause in the
Commission must Christ keep close: And accordingly so he did. In the Book of
the after-Prophets you may read Jehovah the Father thus speaking concerning his
Son Christ, Isai. 42. 1. compared with Mat. 1^ 18. and Phil. 2. 6, 7. 8.
behold, my servant whom I uphold, mine Elect, my Soul delights, I have given
my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth Judgment to the Nations: Christ as
Mediator, was his Fathers Servant, he took upon him the Form of a Servant, and
the Servant must keep close to the will and word and Command of him whose
Servant he is, especially in this case, where all and every of the words, and
wills and Commands of the Father are Holy, just and good. And it is fore told
of Christ, that, he would when he had a body Prepared for, and taken to him,
thus bespeak his Father, Psalm. 40. 8, 9, 10. compared with Mar. 26. 39. and
Mar. 14. 36. and Luke 22. 42. and Heb. 10. 9.
I take pleasure, O my Aelohim, to do thy well-pleasing, thy will: (as Christ
else where, in the history of this) not as I will, but as thou: Not what I will
but what thou will: Not my will but, thine be done: Lo I come to do thy will; I
utter thy truth, and thy Salvation, I do not conceal thy bountifulness and thy
Faithfulness in the great Congregation: Christ did not in the least go beyond
or beside his Fathers will and word. The New Testament is full of this. Mat.
20. 23.
The sitting at Christ's right (Hand) and at his left, was not in Christ's Power
to give; but, (or except, or if not) to those for whom it is prepared of my
Father, so Christ told the Sons of Zebedee and their Mother. It was his to
give, but only to such as were specified in the Fathers Grant to him. John 3.
32. 34. and 4. 34. and 5. 19, 30, 36, 37, 43.
Thus he elsewhere affirms of himself, what the Son has seen and heard, that
he testifies, (no more, no less, no other than that,) he whom god has sent,
(that is, Christ whom the Father has sent,) speaks the words of God: My meat
is, that, I do the will of him that sent me, and Finish his work: The Son can
do nothing of him self, except he see the father do it; whatsoever he does,
also does the Son likewise. I can of my self do nothing. I seek not my will but
the will of the Father that sent me. The Father gave me works to finish: The
father himself has sent me: Iam come in my Fathers name: John 6. 38.
I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that
sent me: John 7. 16, 17, 18, 28.
my Doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me, If any man will do his will, he
shall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of my
self; he that speaks of himself seeks his own Glory, but he that seeks
his Glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him: I
am not come of my self, but, he that sent me is true. John 8 28, 29, 38, 42.
I do nothing of my self, but, as my Father has taught me, I speak these
things, I do always those things which he has appointed. I speak that which I
have seen with my Father, I came not of my self but he sent me: John 12. 49, 50.
I have not spoken of my self, but, the Father which sent me, he gave me a
Commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak, and I know, that, his
Commandment is life everlasting: Whatsoever I speak therefore even as the
Father said unto me, so I speak John 14. 10. 24.
the words that I spoke unto you, I speak not of my self; the word which you
hear is not mine, but the Fathers which sent me. John 15. 10. 15.
I have kept my Fathers Commandments; all things that I have heard of my
Father I have made known unto you. Thus also the LORD Jesus Christ
acknowledges in his Prayer to his Father; John 17. 2, 4, 6, 8, 14. 1 Cor. 15.
24.
Father thou have given thy Son Power over all Flesh, that, he should give
eternal Life to as many as thou have given him: I have finished the work which
thou gave me to do, I have manifested thy name unto the Men which thou gave
me out of the world: Thine they were and thou gave them me, and they have
kept thy word. I have given unto them the words which thou gave me, and they
have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they
have believed, that, thou did send me, I have given them thy word and the
world has hated them. An exact punctual just account of this great undertaking
and Transacting will Christ give and deliver up to his Father in the latter
day. The discerning Reader may see, how express Christ is in this matter; he
exercises his Power according to his Fathers will and word. And the Father, as
also the Son from the Father; has not revealed any such thing in the word of
truth, as the Change of the Weekly Sabbath from the last to the first day of
the Week: There is no appearance of any such Institution or Command. Christ
came not to make a Change in any one of the Laws of the ten words. where did
the Father put any such words into Christ's mouth? and where did Christ ever
speak any such words? As Christ was to speak what words the Father put into his
mouth, So also the Holy Spirit of Truth; whom the Father sent in Christ's name,
John 16. 13.
he was not to speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, says Christ to
his Disciples, that shall ye speak. How much less should any mere Man or Men
speak a word about a pretended Change of the Sabbath, which is a saying of
their own, and not a word from the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: in this or in
any other Case? It was the LORDs charge and Promise to Moses; Exodus 4. 15.
I will be with thy mouth, and with Aarons mouth, and will teach you what ye
shall do, speak thou Exodus 6 29.
all that I say unto thee: And Moses has a Scripture-testimonial, that Heb. 3.
2.
he was Faithful in all Gods House. It is mentioned to his Praise above forty
times, that Moses did as Jehovah commanded him. The same was in Jerem. 1. 9.
and 5. 14.
Jeremiahs commission, which he confesses, Jehovah said unto me, I have put my
words in thy mouth; and this Jehovah affirms of Jeremiah, my words in thy
mouth. Thus says Jehovah, was the usual message; that the Faithful Prophets
brought to the People; and it is expressly mentioned about one thousand and five
hundred times in the Scriptures, besides other such like words, as, thus says
Jehovah Aelohim of Israel: and thus says Jehovah of Hosts. often. Now, who can
say, with any truth in his saying, thus says Jehovah. The first day (of the
Week) is the Sabbath, (Weekly in the Room of the Seventh, the last day of the
Week).

I am now to speak of the Promise. There is no Promise made to the observing of
any other day in the Week as the Weekly-Sabbath-day, but only of the
seventh-day, which is the last day in the Week, in the weekly returns of it.
Here all that might be resumed, which is Written about Aelohims Blessing of the
seventh day; and that only, as the Weekly Sabbath Day. To which also might be
added all those promises which more at large are made over to those, that keep
and obey all and every of the Commands of Jehovah Aelohim: Whereof this of
observing of the Weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath, is one: But I would keep close to
this Subject matter. The Seventh-day Sabbath is Exodus 16. 29. Ezekiel. 20. 12.
a gift from Jehovah Aelohim, to be a sign between him and between his People,
Exodus 31. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Ezekiel. 20. 12. 20.
to the end, they may know, that he is Jehovah sanctifying them: And that, he
is Jehovah their God. How free is that Love, how rich that Grace which is put
in to this Covenant! And this is annexed to the seventh day, as the Sabbath of
Rest, Holiness to Jehovah. What kind of sign this is, may be spoken unto in
another place, Moses in his repeating of this Law of the Weekly Deuteronomy. 5. 12-15.
Seventh-day Sabbath does four several-times put this Covenant of Grace by
Express terms into this Command, whereby Hearts should be the more drawn into
orderly Obedience thereunto: That, the same Jehovah Aelohim who proclaimed the
Holy Law together with the other Nine, was their Aelohim, theirs in a peculiar
especial distinguishing manner who conformed in all things to his revealed
will, and stood complete and perfect in his whole will, and therefore should
they be engaged and be encouraged, to do the Sabbath day, to Hallow it, as he
had commanded them. Levit. 26. 2. etc. also. Numb. 28. 2. 9, 10.
Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, I Jehovah, if ye walk in my Statutes, and keep my
Commandments and do them, then says Jehovah, I will give you this and that
Blessing in Temporals, and further I will set my Tabernacle amongst you, and my
Soul shall not abhor you, and I will walk among you, and will be your God and
ye shall be my People. Sabbath-worship on the Sabbath Day, in this Sabbath,
(For the instituted day of the Weekly Sabbath must be observed, to be
accepted,) shall be a Savor of Rest to me, said Jehovah. Thus also in the
Prophets: Isai. 56. 1.-8.
That Evangelical Prophet Isaiah, sweetly thus; Blessed is the Man, or O the
blessedness, or happy Progresses (or Blessed goings on with a straight foot,
for such will make a good Progress in other Religion, who are found walking on
Prosperously in this Sabbath-way) of that Aenosh, and the son of Man, of Adam
that keeps the Sabbath, so that he does not pollute it, or not Profane it!
For thus says Jehovah to them, that keep these my Sabbaths: (not those that
are of Men's inventing and imposing: Contrary to these seventh-day-Sabbaths
which are of his Instituting, and which he does own as his peculiar) and have
chosen in what I delight, or have pleasingly willed, and who taking hold of my
Convenant I will give unto them in my House, and within my Walls an everlasting
name, that shall not be cut off, I will bring them to the Mount of my Holiness,
and I will make them joyful in my house of Prayer; their Sacrifices and their
Offerings shall be accepted upon mine altar. And in another place Jehovah has
prophesied and promised, that he will raise up such as shall be Restorers of
Paths to Sabbatize in, saying, Isai. 58. 13. 13. 14.
if thou turn away from the Sabbath thy Feet to do thy pleasure on mine Holy
day, and thou call the Sabbath a delight the Holy of Jehovah Honorable, and
thou have Honored, shall Honor him, not doing thy own ways, nor finding thy
own pleasure, nor speaking (thy own,) words, then shall thou delight thy self
in Jehovah, and I will cause thee to Ride upon the High places of the Earth,
and I will feed thee with the Inheritance of Jacob thy Father; Isai. 66. 23.
From the time of the Sabbath in his Sabbath, all Flesh shall come for to bow
down to my Face, says Jehovah. The Prophet Ierem. 17. 21, 22, 24, 25. 26.
Jeremiah does also bring good and comfortable words from Jehovah to right
observers of the Seventh-day Sabbath. Thus says Jehovah, bear no Burden on the
Sabbath Day. Hallow ye the Sabbath day, as I commanded your Fathers: It shall
come to pass, if Hearkening ye shall Hearken unto me, to bring in no Burden
through the Gates of the City on the Sabbath Day, and shall Hallow the Sabbath
day to do no work therein, then shall there enter into the Gates of this City
Kings and Princes sitting upon the Throne of David, Riding in Chariots and on
Horses, they and their Princes, the Men of Judah, and the Inhabitants of
Jerusalem: and this City shall remain for ever, and they shall come from the
Cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the Land of
Benjamin, and from the Plain, and from the Mountains, and from the South,
bringing Burnt Offerings and Sacrifices, and Meat Offerings and Incense; and
bringing Sacrifices of Praise unto the House of Jehovah. They are sweet
precious Words those by the Ezekiel. 20. 11. 12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 41.
Prophet Ezekiel. I, says the LORD, gave them my starutes and showed them my
Judgments, which if a Man do, he shall even live in them: Moreover I gave them
my Sabbaths, but they despised my Judgments, which if a Man do he shall even
live in them: This is twice expressed as a gracious encouraging Promise; and a
Third time it is Covenanted there, I Jehovah your Aelohim, Hallow my Sabbaths,
that ye may know that I Jehovah your Aelohim; and I will accept you with your
Savor of Rest. There is one Psalm. 92. title, compared with the rest.
Psalm, that has several Choice promises in it, and the Title of it is, a Psalm
or Hymn for the Sabbath Day, which is to be carried through that Psalm. Those
who keep the Seventh-day Sabbath shall experience Jehovahs Loving kindness in
the Morning, and his faithfulness in the Nights, they shall be made Glad
through his work, they shall Triumph in the Works of his Hands: They shall have
their Horn, (their Power, their Strength, their Defense, their Glory, their
Honor, their Dignity, their Exaltation, their Firmness, their long-continued
happiness) like that of an Unicorn: They shall be poured over with Green Oil
(with new revivings and pleasant refreshings:) Their Eyes shall see on their
spying Enemies, and their Ears shall hear concerning the Evildoers which rise
up against them. Such Righteous ones as are due Observers of this
Seventh-day Sabbath, shall grow like to a Palm Tree: They shall grow like a
Cedar-tree in Lebanon, To them that are thus Planted in the House of Jehovah,
those they shall make to grow in the Courts of their God. They shall bear Fruit
yet in the Gray Age: They shall be fat and green: If all and every of these
were opened and applied at Large, O how much of rich treasure is there in them!
The Chaldee upon the Title of this Psalm does thus paraphrase, An Hymn, which
the First Man Adam said for the Sabbath day. And the Seventy two Greek
Interpreters have a double Article here, a Psalm of a Song unto that day of the
Sabbath: The same Sabbath Day that was the Seventh day of the Week from the
Creation; which was to be Sanctified, as many other ways, so particularly by
Singing of Psalms. This Psalm has diverse Prophetical passages in it relating to
New-Testament-promises, especially in the Latter-day-glory of this dispensation
of Grace. It is Judged by the Hebrews to be penned by Adam, when he beheld the
Glorious Works of the Creator, and commending it prophetically to after-ages.
Mar. 2. 27. Mat. 24. 20.
The New Testament gives us to know from the mouth of our LORD Christ himself,
the Commander and observer, the blesser, and the Sanctifier, of this
Seventh-day Sabbath, that, It was made for Adam, and in him for all mankind,
for their Happiness, for their Good, if they would be diligent observers of it:
And that, to be forced to flee from Sabbath-work and enjoyments, was to be
driven from special privileges, which sore Judgment those who are
Sabbath-observers should endeavor by Prayer to keep off, lest otherwise it did
so befall them.

Let it also be duly pondered upon in this one weighty consideration more, that
there is no threatening either denounced against or executed upon any that shall
not observe any other day in the Week as a Weekly-Sabbath-day, but only against
and upon such as will not observe the seventh day; which is the last day in
every Week. In the Book of Moses Exodus 16. 23.-35.
before the Proclaiming of the Law of the Ten words at Mount- Sinai the
Israelites were to gather Manna on the six foregoing days of the Week, and on
the sixth day (that sixth, the day immediately before the Seventh, that, there
could be no mistake of the day) the bread of two days, one part whereof being
kept for Food on the seventh day Sabbath, did neither melt nor stink, neither
was any Worm therein: yet notwithstanding this wonderful appearance of Jehovah
for the sustenance and Food of his people, who but a little before had murmured
and complained for want of Bread, there were of the People who went out on the
Seventh day for to gather Manna, and they found none. Upon this, Jehovah steps
in with his prohibition and threatening, and said unto Moses, how long refuse ye
to keep my Commandments and my Laws! See for that Jehova has given you the
Sabbath, (this Sabbath, this noted day,) therefore he gives you on that sixth
day the Bread of two days, abide ye every Man in his place, let no man, (not a
Man of you, if you dare to transgress, it will be to your hurt: (...) is a
Particle of Dehorting and of Deprecating) go out of his place on this seventh
day: And that, this seventh-day Sabbath might have the more confirming
Sanction, Jehovah Aelohim continues this miraculous way of seeding of his
people for about Forty years, and takes order for the preserving of a Pot of
this Manna, to be laid up to the Faces of Jehovah to be kept for their
generations, Comparae Josh 5. 12.
for the better establishing of the Doctrine of Weeks, and of the certainty and
duty of observing the Seventh-day Sabbath; which admirable appearing if we
reckon it seven times over for every Week, six times for the fall of Manna, on
the six foregoing days of each Week, and a seventh time for the preserving of
that part of the double portion on the Seventh day which was gathered on the
Sixth day; the Number amounts to above fourteen Thousand times. At the
Promulgation of the Law; Exodus 20. 9, 10. Deuteronomy 5. 13, 14.
there was a threatening in the Prohibition, six days thou shall Labor but the
seventh day is the Sabbath: In it thou shall not do any Work. So in Moses's
repeating of this Law, the seventh day is the Sabbath of Jehovah thy Aelohim;
in it thou shall not do any work (if thou will boldly transgress, it will be at
thine own Peril.) After the solemn reviving and publishing of this Law, every
one that defi^eth the Sabbath Exodus 31. 14, 15.
shall surely be put to death; For, whosoever does any Work therein, that Soul
shall be cut off from amongst his people. Six days shall work be done, but,
in the seventh the Sabbath of Rest, (or a Sabbath of Sabbatism, Holiness to
Jehovah; who doing a work in the day of that Sabbath, to die he shall die,
whosoever does work on the Seventh-day Sabbath Exodus 35. 2.
shall be put to death. Levit. 26. 2, 14, 15, 16. etc.
Thus says Jehovah if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
my Commandments, particularly, if ye will not keep my Sabbaths, I also will do
this unto you: And then follows Threatening upon Threatening, Curse upon Curse.
Thus f when Jehovah had by a judicial Law declared against wilful
transgressors, t Numb. 15. 30.-36.
a Soul that would sin with an high hand whereby such an one did Reproach
Jehovah, for which that Soul was to be cut off from among his People, because
he had despised the word of Jehovah, and had broken his Commandment, that Soul
was utterly to be cut off; his Iniquity was to be upon him: And notwithstanding
this Denunciation, one of the Children of Israel would be gathering of Wood
upon the Sabbath Day: when those that found him thus Transgressing this Law and
contemning this threatening, had brought him unto Moses and Aaron and unto all
the Congregation, and they had put him in ward, because, it was not declared
(as to the particular kind of Death, for, the judicial Law was declared Exodus
31. 14, 15. and 35 2.
before, as was but now mentioned!) should be done to him: Hereupon Jehovah
said to Moses, that man shall surely be put to death: All the Congregation
shall stone him with Stones without the Camp. And all the Congregation brought
him without the Camp, and stoned him with Stones and he died; as Jehovah
commanded Moses. In the Book of the Prophets there is also a denouncing of
Judgments against Profaners of the Seventh-day Sabbath, Hear what Jehovah spoke
by the mouth of his servant Jerem. 17. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27.
Jeremiah, thus said Jehovah unto me, go and stand in the gate of the Children
of the People, whereby the Kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go
out, and in all the Gates of Jerusalem; and say unto them, hear ye the word of
Jehovah, ye Kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, that enter in by these Gates: Thus says Jehovah, take heed to your
selves, and bear no Burden on the Sabbath Day, nor bring in by the Gates of
Jerusalem, neither carry forth a Burden out of your Houses on the Sabbath Day,
neither do ye any work, but Hallow the Sabbath Day, as I commanded your
Fathers, but they obeyed not, neither inclined their Ear; but made their Neck
stiff, that, they might not hear nor receive instruction: And if you will not
hearken unto me to Hallow the Sabbath day, and not to bear a Burden, even
entering in at the Gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath Day, then will I kindle a
Fire in the Gates thereof, and it shall devour the Palaces of Jerusalem, and it
shall not be quenched. Let Ezekiel. 20. 10.-21.
Ezekiel now speak from the LORD, I, says Jehovah, caused my people to go
forth out of the Land of Egypt, and brought them into the Wilderness and I gave
them my statutes and showed them my Judgments which if a man do he shall even
live in them. Moreover also, I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me
and them, that, they might know, that, I Jehovah who Sanctify them: But the
House of Israel rebelled against me in the Wilderness; they walked not in my
statutes, and they despised my Judgments; which if a Man do he shall even live
in them: (This promise mentioned twice here, implies the contrary death, even
death upon death, death unto death, threatened against not-doers, (particularly
against not-doers, not-Hallowers of the Seventh-day Sabbath;) and my Sabbaths
they greatly polluted. Then (observe, the LORD catched at this season of their
provoking of him) I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the Wilderness
to consume them. Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the Wilderness, that
I would not bring them into the Land which I had given them Flowing with Milk
and Honey; which are the Glory of all Lands. Because, they despised my Judgments
and walked not in my Statutes, but, polluted my Sabbaths: But, I said unto
their Children in the Wilderness, Hallow my Sabbaths: Notwithstanding the
Children rebelled against me, they polluted my Sabbaths: Then I said (observe
he takes notice a second time of this time of the Provocation was given him by
them this way) I would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger
against them in the Wilderness. The like we have in Ezekiel. 22, 26. 31.
another place of the same Prophet, her Priests (speaking of Jerusalem) have
violated my Law, and have profaned my Holy things: They have put no difference
between the Holy and Profane, neither have they showed between the unclean and
the Clean, and have hid their Eyes from my Sabbaths, (even administrators about
Holy things do some times hide their Eyes from Jehovahs Sabbaths,) and I am
profaned among them. Therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them; I
have Consumed them with the Fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed
upon their heads, says Adonai Jehovah. Such a passage we also find in the
Prophecy by Amos. 8. 4-14.
Amos, hear this, O ye, who saying, when will the Sabbath be gone, (they
thought the seventh day the longest day in the Week,) that we may set forth
wheat, making the Ephah Small and the Shekel great, and perverting the Balances
of deceit: Jehovah has sworn by the Excellency of Jacob surely, I will never
forget any of their works: Shall not the Land tremble for this, and every one
mourn that dwells therein? I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all
your Songs into Lamentation: I will send a Famine of hearing the words of
Jehovah. Thus, after that the People of God had returned from Babylonish
captivity in Nehem. 13. 15-22.
Nehemiahs time, when the Sabbath was profaned, he, as a Magistrate reproves
and threatens those in Judah, whom he saw treading Winepresses on the Sabbath
and bringing in sheaves, and lading Asses, as also Wine, Grapes and Figs, and
all Burdens which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: And I
testified in the day wherein they sold victuals; there dwelt men of Tire also
therein, which brought Fish and all manner of ware and sold on the Sabbath unto
the Children of Judah and in Jerusalem: Then I, says he, contended with the
Nobles of Judah and said unto them, what Evil thing is this that ye do, and
profane the Sabbath Day? Did not your Fathers thus, and did not our God bring
all this Evil upon us and upon this City? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel
by profaning the Sabbath. Upon this he commands, that, there should no Burden
be brought in on the Sabbath day: And when the Merchants and the Sellers of all
kind of Ware lodged within Jerusalem once or twice, then he testified against
them and said unto them, why lodge ye before the Wall? If ye do again, I will
lay hands on you. From that time forth came they not on the Sabbath: And he
Commanded the Levites; that, they should cleanse themselves, and that, they
should come to keep the Gates to Sanctify the Sabbath Day. 2. King 25. Mat.
24. 20. Act. 13. 44.-48.
For an improvement of this kind of Learning let the Studious search the
Scriptures, whether both the First and the second Temple were not burnt, and
the People captived in the one, and fleeing into the other, both these on the
Seventh-day Sabbath? And whether the First great Ejection and unchurching of
the Jews were not also on the Seventh-day Sabbath, and the Gospel more carried
over to the Gentiles?

Having thus carried this Doctrine and Duty concerning the
Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath through the whole Scripture with that arguing
convincingness which is clear and evident to plain unprejudiced Judgments and
understandings, though so full a Testimony should suffice, yet that I may the
better make way for the answering of somewhat that may look a little like
Objection, I shall add this to the rest for a further Confirmation, that
Aelohim has put this Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath, into Created Nature. Genesis 1.
26, 27. Eccles. 7. 29. Ephesians. 4. 24. Colos. 3. 10. Romans 2. 14, 15, 26, 27. and
3. 29.
The Human nature in the First Adam was made and framed to the Perfection of
Holiness and of Righteousness in the Ten words; which Ten words I take to be
the only certain, universal, perfect summary, and Comprehensive of that which
is the Law of Nature in Mankind: A full exact Copy, draught and Transcript, of
the Law of Creation in the heart of Adam, the Proclaimed and now Written word,
the same for sum and for substance which had a living Concreated impression on
that Heart and mind of his: As the true unchangeable Original-Law; being not
only the declared will but also agreeing with the Holy nature, or Essence, and
being, of the Creator himself, an Holy, just and good Law, no ways differing
from the Law which was given to and put into the Humane nature in the
uprightness and integrity The, purity and perfection of that Humane Nature:
This Law particularly of the Weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, and the due
observation thereof, was a part of this Law of Nature, as it lay evidently in
that Established order of Aelohims Creating the foregoing six days of that one
week (the rule and pattern of all after-weeks) being the working days, and the
seventh, the last day of that Week. being the weekly-Sabbath-day: Such being
the method which Aelohim used in the production of his Creatures on the several
six days, and the disposal of his and of Man's Rest, on the Seventh day. Thus
stands the Relation in the weekly succession of days, which Aelohim made to
be in the true nature of these Created existences, really whilst the World
stands to be instructive unto all mankind of what is his natural will, and man's
natural Duty. There was in this Primitive Ordination a full evidence and a
convincing Demonstration of Aelohims pleasure herein, by his appointing a
sufficiency of light about this matter, both in the Created nature of days,
and of works and Rest respectively in those days, to give Adam to see and
know, what he ought to do, what days to work in, and what day to rest on, and
also Innate in Adam himself for his instruction, thereby discerningly to
understand and Faithfully to improve this for the designed end, true use, and
proper purposes. Some notions of this Law, as well as of the others of the Ten
words, are still retained and kept in man, even though now fallen and in his
corrupt state? and renewing Grace does restore in part to the first Created
Holiness and Righteousness. Aelohim Created Adam in his own Image: In the Image
of Aelohim Created he him: And we are to put on the New man which according to
God is Created in Righteousness and Holiness of Truth, which is renewed unto
knowledge according to the Image of him that Created him. And the whole of this
is still in being, carefully, faithfully, unalterably preserved, not only by
Revelation in the Scriptures of Truth, but also by Primitive Creation and
Providential Continuation in the true Nature and in the real Existence of the
things themselves. All and every of the days and Weeks, that have been, are,
and will be, since the first Created Week in their ordinary revolutions and
Genesis 8. 22. Jerem. 31. 35, 36. and 33. 20, 25.
successive courses, are as the days and week of that one Created week were.
At the First Creation was this Law given to Adam in respect of his humane
Nature and in him given to all the World of Humane Creatures. Even adversaries
themselves in their Writings against the Seventh-day Sabbath have confessed,
that, the Law given to Adam from the beginning is unalterable, and therefore
remains still in full force, so that, all men to the Worlds end are bound to
yield obedience thereunto: and that the Rest of the Seventh-day Sabbath, was
entered into from the Foundation of the World; Christ himself the Creator rested
the seventh day from all his works; and that, Aelohims resting, on that
Seventh-day Sabbath does necessarily imply Man's Resting on that day as well as
Gods resting, God's entering into that rest being the ground of Man's rest at
the same time; which they prove from Heb. 4. 3, 4. The created nature of it as
the seventh day, and the cogent reason of it as the Weekly Sabbath Day, not
being peculiar to the Israelites, but common to the Gentiles, the Command is
not proper to one of these only, excluding the other, but does belong unto
both; the LORD's resting on it, which gave such occasion to his Blessing and
Sanctifying of it, has an Universal preceptive respect to Adam and to his whole
Posterity; it is a common Instruction and a general Command unto all men in all
ages, to labor in their particular callings, functions, and employments on
those six foregoing days of the Week wherein Jehovah Aelohim made the Heavens
and the Earth, and to cease and rest from such labor on the seventh-day,
because in it He Sabbatized or rested from all his work: This Law was made and
it came with Authority in the beginning of the Created World, and it shall
continue and last to the end of the World: Adam, the Father of Nations and of
Generations, was put under the obligation of it, and so are all his Offspring
from first to last throughout all Nations in all Generations. Every Man has 1
Cor. 11. 14. Rome^. 20.
a teaching light and law of Nature, which he does carry about with, and in,
him, and is born and bred together with him. There are still some relics and
remainders, as dark Letters in an old Monument, of those Holy, Just, Good, and
spiritual Laws of the Ten Words; still to preserve and keep alive the memory of
Man's first created Honor and Dignity, His Rectitude and Uprightness, as also
for some other ends, Though those seeds are corrupted now, Natural right reason
will teach men, that, seeing all men in all Nations do measure their time by
Weeks, and their Weeks by seven days, they should (besides what part they
separate of their time as due unto God every day,) set apart one whole day of
every week unto their Maker, who has allowed them so liberal a portion of time,
wherein to provide for themselves and for their families: there being no other
proportion of time that can so well provide both for the worship and service of
God every day, as, Evening and Morning of every day; and every week, as the
whole Seventh which is the last day: and also for the necessities of all
Families, as that which remains of the several six foregoing days of the
Week: and that is so well fitted to all functions and Callings and Employments.
There is that in every man, who has the due exercise of his right reason that
will directly answer unto this, especially when compared with these created
beings, and more especially yet, when having the advantage of
Scripture-revelation. The light and law of Nature when cleared up, will tell
men, that all men's labor and motion, being in order to Heb. 4. 10. Revel. 14.
13.
Rest, and Rest being the perfection and end of Labor: into which labor and
work and motion do pass; that, therefore the seventh which is the last day in
every week is the most fit and proper whole day for a weekly religious rest
unto the Creator, for his Worship, service, and honor; The natural
reasonableness of this Command for observing the Seventh-day Sabbath does
suggest, That, Man and Beast should have his Resting-day every week. Exodus 23.
12.
The Ass (that poor beast so much used to burdens and drudgery on other days)
must rest, and the Stranger be refreshed, on the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath.
Mognadim, and contracted. Mognadei, compare Genesis 1. 14. and Psalm. 104. 19. and
Levit. 23. 2, 3. and Numb. 28. 2. 9, 10, and Psa. 136. 7, 8, 9.
That word in the Original, which does set our conventions for Worship, to
those who do understand it, and who will make a diligent observation and due
improvement of it, would inform them, that, they may with their own eyes
discern something of this in the motion of those Heavenly lights, which would
instruct men, that, set times of their Creator's appointing for solemn
Assembling, and for his instituted Service are directed to and pointed at by
those Great Luminaries which the All-wise Aelohim has set up in the Heavens;
As, for many other good purposes, so also particularly for this Great and Holy
end.

This naturalness of the Weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath should make all the
judgments and wills of grown reasonable Creatures to bend and to bow before it;
and should for ever stop the mouth of all gainsayers, never more to speak, or
write, or print a word against that which is so Legible in its own created
Existence. Pure Primitive nature in Scripture is put sometimes for the essence
of a being, or for the Essential Properties of it: Thus 2 Pet. 1. 3, 4.
, the Goddy-nature is His Essence, His unchangeable Being, a lively resemblance
unto which communicable properties in Him (such as His Wisdom, Goodness, Truth,
Holiness, and such like) are impartable to rational creatures, especially to
new creatures; For, otherwise, as for His very Essentiality, This is
incommunicable to any mere Creature. Galat. 4. 8.
Hence, as to Creatures, Nature is put, for the person or thing it self,
Indeed, or In-truth, really so, Jam. 3. 7.

Law particularly: Aelohim will not change what He did create to be pure and
good, naturally, essentially so; It is the Seventh-days proper nature to be the
Weekly-Sabbath. This Seventh-day and the Weekly-Sabbath were Concreated; It was
so made and ordained, according to pure Primitive Creation: When the first pure
created state of what Aelohim made was defaced by sin, much of his doing in the
World is Psalm. 51. 10. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Ephesians. 2. 10. and 4. 24. Gal. 6. 15. Isa.

to bring back to that Original purity and goodness. Therefore the work of
Redemption is set out by Creation; and for the same reason it is called a
renewed Creation; So is his work of Preservation of, and of Providence over,
his creatures. So will his work of Regeneration and of Conversion still be:
Thus also his constituting of his Church: Thus also his work of Instauration
and of Renovation of the Heavens and of the Earth. This work of first Creation
by the creating Messiah, is the rule and Standard, the pattern and exemplar, to
which all must be brought. It is, as to the final cause thereof, for the glory
of Aelohim; The glory of Christ, The good of the Elect and of the Believing.
The work of Creation in that one week of the Erected World was a glorious work,

perfect, particularly of Genesis 28. and 2. 16, 19. Psa. 8, 6. Heb. 7, 8.
Man, as Man. That Sabbath which was thus from the beginning must still stand.
The first created Seventh-day Sabbath is throughout the Scripture most natural,
according to the Scripture. This alone, and no other Day is the Sabbath in pure
created Nature. This Seventh in order, has the natural name of Sabbath, which
the First, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth have not. The creation has a
natural order: The several works thereof having been so created in such due
order in six distinct days, does carry that along with it in the very nature
and order of their creation, which would convince a natural conscience,
exercising right reason, especially when the true information and clear
discovery thereof is brought unto him by Scripture-revelation, that, the
Creators wisdom does shine forth in that order, and that this self-evidencing
light should be received, entertained, and improved with ready submission to
its obliging Law which does bind such a natural conscience to believe, observe
and obey it. The first created time as to the weekly Sabbath was perfected and
appointed in its proper, prime, pure, and natural, Created state: and therefore
the created order of the seven days of that one week must still keep their
natural Names: and so, the last day of the week and no other, is alone, the
seventh-day and the Sabbath Day: Which day then, cannot be altered unto a
working-day: Aelohim's Law must still be obeyed and his Example followed whilst
Time has duration. To carry the Sabbatizing rest from the seventh to the first
day, and the Labouring-service from the first to the seventh-day, is contrary
to the purest Created Nature. There is not a translating either of the Work, or
of the Rest from one day of the week to another. Aelohim would not have either
of these to be separated from his, from their, appointed seasons; It must abide
to the End what was thus from the Beginning. What the Holy Law of pure Nature
does confirm, does remain unmoved through all the Dispensations of Grace, both
of the Old and New-Testament-Administration: This does not destroy that which
is pure and perfect in its natural created Being. Scripture and Nature are in
Harmonious Concord in this matter. This seventh day is peculiarly sequestered by
Aelohim for a Sabbath, and has this Preeminence beyond all the rest; the Vote
and suffrage of Primitive Nature, does determine and conclude it to be so. And
what is Man, that, he attempts Dan. 7. 25. 1 Kin. 12. 32, 33.
to change this Time and Law, by a Devising of his own heart, and to level this
Honorable Day with the rest, seeing it was the Institution of Aelohim in the
very Forming of Created beings? The Holy ends whereof, were concreated uses,
natural and permanent for this portion of Time; Which seventh day may not
therefore be employed about the common ends, uses, and works of the six
foregoing days of the Week: Which six days in their order and names have their
several distinct Existence, as sense does plainly demonstrate, by the continued
successive courses of Night and Day in their seasons. At the first framing of
Nature, the very time it self of the seventh day was on that same day created
and made an Holy Rest, and was by Law and Sanction so declared, The time it
self of the Seventh-day Sabbath, As such, was, and is, and will be, That
distinct part of Time which was the object of Aelohim's blessing and
sanctifying of it, as the natural Weekly Sabbath, to be a day of Holy Rest,
having Foundation in its own natural Existence. This is manifestly evidenceable
to every rational Man's revived nature; and it is perfectly demonstrable by
Scripture-revelation, to every considering Believer, who gives himself
impartially to understand the substance and the end of Aelohim's creating of
such a separated determinate portion of Time. This is the true Doctrine and the
Genuin meaning of the Weekly-Sabbath: Man and this Seventh-day Sabbath being
created in one and the same week, will be coeval whilst Weeks do last, They
will live and stand together. The fittedness of this Day was a Creating-Act:
The reason of which Day is of natural self-Manifestation and Obligation, in
which we are confirmed by Word-revelation. This is the prime Make of it, having
its first rise with Created Nature, and so is Perpetual, and unchangeably
fixed, An Individual-Sabbath-day, untransferrable to any other Day of the Week:
Sabbath Day and seventh-day are Connatural and Reciprocal. Sabbath-worship and
service must be done on the Numb. 28. 9, 10.
Day thereof. All days of the week are not of equal account with God; neither
have they the same Honor. Christ Himself has put the Crown upon the Head of
the Seventh-day; and so let it enjoy its sole and lasting Royal Dignity; It
having a concreated Excellingness which will be, and abide with it, through the
duration of the World. A Primitive Constitution that must stand firm. Genesis 2.
2, 3. Exodus 5. 13, 19. Lev. 23. 37. 1 King. 8. 59. Ezekiel. 24. 2.
It is a distinct day and has a distinct word for it. Thus let the Scriptural
complete Journal, and its perfect Diary of that one Created Week, in seven
distinct days remain in its unmovable Order. And now, if this Argument drawn
from pure Primitive Created Nature be convincing and demonstrative, let that
Great Ratiocinator call to mind his Expressions, I can consent, says he, that
all They take the seventh-day for the Sabbath, who can prove it to be by mere
natural evidence: and in another place he thus writes, This is the very hinge
of all our Controversy, For, if this be once proved, we shall easily consess
that it (he speaks of the Seventh-day Sabbath,) is not abrogated: For, Christ
came not to abrogate any Law of Nature. And further he writes, That the great
Laws of nature, containing Man's Duty to God, resulting from and manifested in
our nature, As related to God, and in the nature of things or the works of God,
was still made the chief part of the Redeemer's Law. So that this Law of
nature, whose sum is the love of God and of his Image, is ever the Primitive
unchangeable Law. No title of this shall ever cease, if Nature cease not. The
seventh-day thus speaks for it self and has its Creator and his word cogently
pleading for it. No other day of the week, either in name or in nature, is the
Seventh-day: The order of the Days is sensible from the first to the seventh.
He, that can tell the days, and knows their number, understands, that, there
must six go before in the same week, ere he can come to the seventh: A day,
which cannot be lost by all Mankind: Will any apprehend that, all and every of
reasonable creatures have out slept just one whole day or more, whereby this
account is disturbed? What color is there for such an apprehension, And if,
for Disputes sake, such a groundless supposition were admitted, yet the Day if
thoroughly searched after would recover its ancient right. See the Author of
Cosmical Suspicions, page 19, 20.
Exact Astronomers have observed, that, natural days are not all of equal
length, whatever the vulgar of Philosophers have supposed to the contrary. Let
those improve their skill to advance this great secret in Created Nature with a
particular eye unto the Seventh-day Sabbath; Which alone should put a deciding
end unto this Controversy. Yet in regard this Thwart-over-Generation of vain
affecters of Humane Wisdom does expect some further account of this Matter by
way of Argument unto Men, (although I bottom my judgment and practice upon
Scripture-Revelation and Created Nature:) Let me present the Reader with
somewhat of Expostulation, and of reasoning the Case, with such as do
importunately call for it. Was not the Seventh-day H^b. 4. 3, 4.
kept unlost and unchanged for about Four thousand years till Christ's time? Did
not Christ in the days of his flesh keep the right seventh-day as the weekly
Sabbath Day? Is there any likelihood, that, this last day of the week would be
suffered either in all that time, or since Christ's time to this week, to be
altered, who has taken such care for its preservation, both in Creation and in
Providence; and who has in his Word put so many proper marks of Note and Honor
upon it? Is it not affirmed by James, some years after Christ's ascension, that
Act. 15. 13, 21. A Commentator of note, with many of the learned does cite
diverse passages out of Ecclesiastical History, whereby to prove that the
Seventh-day Sabbath, as well as the first day of the week was observed as
Festival. Christian^^um mos velus, says he, qui diu^issime mansit in Orient,

this place. Who so is both at leisure and willing to read more about this, may
see his Explication of the Decalogue at the end of his Annotations on the Books
of the Gospel, page 40, 41.
Moses from the Ancient times has in every City them that preach him, being
read in the Synagogues every Sabbath Day? Is public Custom, universal, of all
Mankind in all ages, of any force with these contradicting Opposers? If so,
then Observe, Do not most of those who name the Name of Christ, and multitudes
of Pagans with them, observe the first day of the week, as their weekly
Holy Day, which according to Ethnic Idolatry and Superstition they miscal
Sunday? Can he that proves which is the first day of the week, but be able to
tell which is the seventh? if they keep the first right, Then have we the true
Seventh. Have not the Indians their Sabbath on the fourth day of the week? If
theirs be still on the fourth day, then how can the seventh day in Order be
lost with them? Do not the Mahum^dans keep the sixth day of the week as their
weekly Festival? If their day be the sixth, the next immediately following day
must be the seventh. Have not the Jews all along and some Christians kept close
to the seventh, which is the last day in every week, as the Weekly-Sabbath-day?
And how could all these so mis-reckon the seventh for any other day of the
week? How many Testimonies out of Authors could I cite for these, If I would
cram the Margin to cloy the Examiner of it? Do not public Tables witness this?
If these be searched in the Courts of Record, and in Register-books, will it
not be found they distinguish and difference the Sabbath Day as the
Seventh-day, from that which they Name Sunday, the first day of the week? Have
not the Councils by their Decrees still differenced these days, as such a kind
of Proof for the matter of Fact? Do not Laws, Statutes, Acts, and Ordinances of
Parliament keep alive the memory of these distinct days? Do they not give That
Act April 6. (vulgarly so called) 165^. for the better observation of the
Lord's Day (as they wrong Name the First day) was given out on the day of the
Sabbath, meaning the Seventh-day.
the Name of Sabbath Day to the seventh, the last day of the week? Their
freeing of a particular day of the week from all Executions, from troubling any
with any Summons, from compelling any Man to bring forth his Surety, from
Apparitors or Sergeants speaking, from Advocates pleading, from Cryers crying!
Does not this also speak it? Have not some of their Acts the name of Sunday in
the Title of the An. 1. Car. 1. Cap. 1. and An. 3. Cap. 1. An. 5, and 6. Fav.
6. Cap. 3. p. 133.
Act? Do not many Law-processes require persons to appear on the Sabbath Day?
Are not some Statutes Penal upon common Laborers and Travelers on Sunday? Are
there not Injunctions by some on Rogation week (as Superstition calls it,) to
forbid the Solemnization of Marriage, from the first day of the said week until
Trinity-Sunday? If any Common Prayer book-man make this Objection against me,
he may take notice, That, the year when the LORD graciously led me into the
observation of the Weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, that, It was the seventh-day in
order of time from the Twenty fifth of March (according to Vulgar Account)
which I observed, and that twenty fifth day they suppose in their Calendar
prefixed to the Church-Bibles and Common Prayer Book, to be the very day when
the year of the World began. Let them look to their proof, but, according to
that, I observe the seventh day from the Creation. So Act 12. 4. is
mis-translated, It should be Passover, for Easter. There is this passage in a
Querie of King Charles the First concerning Easter, propounded to the
Parliaments Commissioners at Holmby, April 23. 1647. I conceive, says he, the
celebration of this Feast (of Easter) was instituted by the same authority,
which changed the Jewish Sabbath into the Lords day, or Sunday: For, it will
not be found in Scripture, where Saturday is discharged to be kept, or turned
into the Sunday: Wherefore it must be the Churches authority that changed the
one and instituted the other: Therefore my opinion is, that, those who will not
keep this Feast, may as well return to the observation of Saturday, and refuse
the weekly Sunday. When any body can show me, that herein I am in an error, I
shall not be a shamed to confess, and amend it, till when you know my mind, C.
R. Hesychius calls the first day of the Week another Sabbath Day. So in the
Council of Friuli, the first day is called Sabbatum primum, as the Seventh day
is Sabbatum ultimum, Council. Foro juliense. cap. 13. So Ambrose in Psalm. 37. So
Scaliger of the Ethiopian Christians, they call both of them, the Seventh day
and the First day, by the name of Sabbaths. Thus Doctor Usher in his Letter to
Dr. Twiss published by Dr. Bernard, page 88, 89.
Easter-week (Thus do men heathenishly mis-name days, and weeks, and months,
and years) is by all such understood to be that week, whereof Easter Day, the
Sunday, is the first, and so they reckon afterward, the first Sunday after
Easter-week, the second Sunday, and so on. So Whitsundayweek, begins that week
with Whitsunday. And afterward Trinity-Sunday, the first, second, and so
forth, Sunday after Trinity: Thus they observe the times for the keeping of
their Sessions. Do not dead Monuments and Tomb-stones keep alive the memory of
the days of the Week, when they have often engraved upon them that particular
day of the Week when such or such a one dyed, or was buried, or had his Epitaph
and Monument erected? Do not Engravings at some Fountains, and Springs speak
this, where the Owners have Recorded some known day of the week upon the
Head-stones? So also some Boundary stones or Mark-stones. May we not often meet
with this in Dictionaries and Lexicographers, allowed by public authority,
which do give other names to other day, of the Week, But, the Seventh which is
the last day they call the Sabbath Day, Rust-dagh in Belgic, or Low Dutch.
The Day of Rest? Do not Historians keep this Truth Company with their
Judgment? For a thousand years and upward, say some, when we meet with Sabbath
in any Writer, of what name soever, it must be understood of no other day than
this seventh-day: So those whom they call the Ancient Fathers, generally style
this last day of the Week, Sabbath. Are not Synods, Councils, and Canons, of
one and the same mind in this? Do not the Records of this English Nation fully
agree in this? Many particular Instances of the seventh-days being called the
Sabbath being to be found, as those who are versed in those Histories do
inform, in the King's Exchequer, in the Common Pleas, in the King's Bench,
Chancery, Chequer-Chamber, and those of the house of Lords, which is one of the
Highest Courts of Record in this Kingdom; all retaining the name of the day of
Sabbath for the seventh-day, This being the common phrase in the Courts of
Westminster: and the Latin processes do run in this style; which is known to
all observing Lawyers, Sheriffs, Atturneys, Clerks and Solicitors. Are not
Tenures of Lands and of Estates Witnesses of this, which are held conditionally
upon paying or doing such a sum or such a thing upon such or such a day of the
week, whereby the number and order of Days cannot be lost? Do not Conveyances,
Copies, Leases, Deeds, concur in this; Which do specify some particular known
day? Do not Commissions to Judges and to other Officers meet with this sense by
their Dates? Do not Charters to Corporations express some special day of
Grants? Are not Fairs and Markets held upon certain days of the week, agreeing
with the present Account, as the reckoning now is? Search the records of
Marriages, Nativities, Deaths, Burials, in Ecclesiastical Register-books, and
is not the memory of Days preserved there? Do not Compacts, Covenants,
Agreements, between party and party, Wills and Testaments, speak the certain
knowledge of Days? Do not Day-labourers keep to this Account? Do not Ephemeries,
Diaries, Hemerologies, Calendars, Almanacks, Astronomies, assent and consent to
this same? What further Evidence is now needful in this case of a matter of
Fact for the satisfying of them who will keep a Weekly-Sabbath-day Holy unto
Jehovah, As an act of Faith with an eye to his Promise, as an Act of Fear with
an eye to his Threatening? In his Travels, fol. 173. and Purchas's Pilgrims, 2d.
part, fol. 1176, 1177.
Sandys in his Travels, being a narrow inquirer into the state of other Nations
and Kingdoms, does relate this concerning the matters of Religion in the
Eastern parts, that, there is a Christian Empire of the Aethiopians that did
still in his time Celebrate Saturday, as well as the Sunday (as he uses the
old Ethnic Phrases); and Purchase writes of the Abyssines, as Subject to Peter
and Paul, and especially to Christ, that, they observed the Saturday Sabbath:
The Melchites or Syrians are said to Celebrate Divine Service as solemnly on
the Sabbath day as on the Dominical day (as they call the First day): Some
Christian Churches have forbid Fasting on both these days: Many more Historical
records of this may an Ingenious, Industrious Reader of such books Collect,
that would further Inform himself about this. Sufficient to me is Scripture
Authority, warranted in created Nature.

Having now gone through my great Task and undertaking in asserting and proving,
through the whole Scriptures by Aelohim's own assigned Reasons, by other
Scripture Arguments, and by Created Nature and Established Order, the
Seventh-day, which is the last day of the week to be the Weekly Sabbath Day,
should not every Mouth be stopped from gainsaying of it? Yet the plainests,
clearest Truths have been opposed, and so is this: Some rise up against it, and
object, that, no special Honor is put by the LORD and by his Word upon the
seventh day, more than upon any other day, of the week, and that, it is but A
seventh, not The seventh; And that, that part of time, that is and will be
accepted with God is declared and determined to be the seventh part of it, or
one day in seven: and that, one day in seven has and must have a natural
priority unto the seventh-day, because, say such, the seventh day is one of the
seven; Whereas such should have more deliberately considered, that one day of
seven was not before the seventh day in order of time: It could not be truly
affirmed of any one day, that it was one of seven before the seventh day was
Created. For, when the one day was so named, there was but that one day; so but
two on the second day; but three on the third day, but four on the fourth, but
five on the fifth, but six on the sixth day, till the seventh had its natural
Existence, and its created being; and until then no one of the foregoing days
of the Week could be called one in seven: For, till then there were not seven:
and the seventh day is the last number of days, and the only seventh in the
days of the Week. So that, here is a stop made, and we go no further forward,
As to the natural created Order and account of a Week, and therefore that
exception and objection, which some do bring in against this from ten Lambs,
any of which may be the tenth according as they may run out, is nothing
pertinent and applicable to the present matter; For, the days of every week do
not run voluntarily at their pleasure which can be before or behind as they
will, to go backward or forward when they list, but, they keep their created
order in this successive continued weekly course by a well-established natural,
unalterable Law: although in the exception and objection, this should be noted,
that, when the ten Lambs were run out; they had each distinct names, and the
last was the only tenth, and no other but the last. That particular day of the
week is the Weekly Sabbath Day, which alone (As to this of the weekly-Sabbath)
has proper marks of Note and of Honor put upon it, As Jehovah's own peculiar
day, which he has culled out from all the rest of the days of the week for his
created ends and instituted purposes: There is not any one Insignificant word
or letter in the whole Book of God; All that he has spoken and given to his
people is of good use. c. Matt. 5. 17; 18, 19. To a Jo^. and Chirek.

prefixed before the Sixth day in order of time, which does in that place
Demonstrate, that, as the work of that Sixth day was somewhat more remarkable,
and that, Aelohim has perfected all the Works which he propounded and purposed
to Create in the foregoing Six days of this one week of the Created World,
showing a thing known and Signally illustrious and commendable: So also, that,
that day only was the Sixth day in the Weekly revolution, and no other day, and
that the Weekly Sabbath must be reckoned in order of Created time the
immediately next succeeding after that Sixth; which was the seventh day, the
last day in the week. Thus also in another place before the Promulgation of

Its Primary signification is to hold forth what is joined to it, and to make

look over what he has Written about this and somewhat further Consider, and
not conclude, that, the discerning inquirer in this age of growing Light, will
be so imposed upon by any man's bare say of Magisterial dictate, without any
probation at all, to assert, that, this prefix to Sabbath in the Fourth word is
Redundant; and does tend nothing to the Determination of a Certain day, but,
only denotes one of seven: Which does now lead me to another cogent Reason, for
the Demonstrativeness and Notificativeness of this Prefix, because, the Law of
the Seventh-day Sabbath in the Ten words being much in the same words and
expressions with the forementioned place in the History of the Creation, has
not only Exodus 20. 8.
a special Note of Remembrance set before it, remember thou, or rather, to
remember, and it does set out one Main great End of Man's being Created, even to
remember the Seventh-day Sabbath: Man is bound for ever, (for it is infinitive,
indefinit) to keep this in mind for himself, and to mention and to speak of it
to others. It is the Duty of Created Man to look well to this, that, the
Seventh-day Sabbath be not forgotten by him, but duly remembered in Order to the
Glorifying of Jehovah: This special Mark is put upon this day to distinguish it
from all and every of the other days of the Week, to note the Importance of
it, and to signify the Antiquity of it: It being as old, of as Ancient
constitution as the very first Week of this Created World, which Aelahim did
expressly command to be observed, as a distinct, separate Sanctified day; it
being the Last day in the Week: And therefore his people have need to remember
it, that, when the time did come about in its Weekly returns, it might not be
forgotten and neglected, as neither its natural Equity. There being the same
Reasons now as ever; which the Lawgiver himself has repeated and revived in the
Fourth word or Command; which does set out the weight of this precept and the
necessity of Man's obedience unto it. The Three former Commandments or words of
the First Table, are much in order unto this, Exodus 20. 8. (...) it is the
Infinitive mood.
to Remember the Seventh-day Sabbath: For, if this be not kept Holy, those
Foregoing three will be broken; as Scripture and experience does prove. Let
several other expressions in this Exodus 20. 8. 11. and Deuter. 5. 12. 15.
Fourth word be yet further Considered with seriousness: For, besides many
other Peculiar Honors which the Adored Almighties the great, Law giver has
put upon this Law of the Ten words, in some respects beyond any other part of
the whole Scripture, take we notice of what does follow more specially and
particularly as to the Fourth word, about the Law of the Weekly Sabbath This
Fourth Command has Double Accents, and particularly that word Seventh, which
do call upon the understanding Reader for this special Noting of some singular
matter in this Law about the Seventh-day Sabbath. There are Four of these
forementioned Notes of Demonstration put before that particular day of the
Week, two of them before the word Sabbath; and two other of them before the
word Seventh, that all may mark it, which is the day; and what a kind of day it
should be observed to be: This Demonstrating Note being prefixed, when the
speech is of a thing certain and known: And therefore it is called by some
skillful Hebricians, a prefix of Knowledge; of (...) Bythners Gram., reg. 61.

one Letter put before the word day, (In a day that Seventh,) which does lead
and direct the Observer of the Weekly Sabbath into that particular day, the
Last day of every week, keeping him within the limited bounds thereof to mind

the Soul, has appointed him to. If any where in the Scriptures of Truth, this
Note of Demonstration have a more Remarkable Significancy, it is in this Law of
the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath; both at the first Creation and Institution of
it, and as it is one of those Ten words which alone, of All the word of God was
more signally written by the Exodus 31. 13-18. and 34. 1, 28. Deuter 4. 13. and
10. 4.

That Particle being a sign, which always by hastening, is referred to the
following word, with which it is Construed, does in this place signify a
particular certain day; noting an excelling thing known to All to whom the
speech is directed, This (Aeth) is twice prefixed to the Seventh-day Sabbath,
that Jom, the day, is four times mentioned. That Author whom I answer in this
does so far acknowledge the Emphitie Prefix, that he says, it may possibly
denote an Excellency in the thing it self: But his may, and may possibly, are
Diminutive uncertain Terms, doing injury to this Scripture, which by those
Prefixes joined with the other special remarks, does and must certainly not
only denote an Excellency in the thing it self, the weekly Sabbath, but also
tends expressly to the determination of the certain day thereof, the seventh
which is the last in Order of every Week: A case so clear to an impartial
Judgment; that one who has written both against Seventh-day and
First-day-Sabbath, yet confesses (And he passes for a potent Ratiocinator)
that, the day of Gods Rest was that particular Sabbath which Jehovah gave at
Mount Sinai: It is not A Sabbath, but The Sabbath, even that which God
sanctified, and it is as ancient as the first week of the Creation, the Sabbath
must be the same with the seventh: Thus he. There might be a large enumeration
of many particular words in Hebrew, which are of common universal use, such as
no institute, custom, or consent of men has imposed upon things, but, created
Nature it self by a secret instinct and impulse has assigned to and imprinted
on real beings, thus, as to the present case this Hebrew letter, (...) Heh,
does take its name from that gesture which generally all mankind do express
when they do demonstrate a person or thing, Hea, Hin, Hinnea in Hebrew; (...)
in Greek, En, Ecoe, in Latin: As, when, we see a Man that has Hou, in Hebrew
that is, Substance, Wealth, Riches, we cry with some admiration. Ha, Ho or
Hah, there goes such a Rich Man, and we are ready to point him out with a
Finger, for that does please such Men when they are so noted by others. The
Demonstrative Letter is Consignificative, and is not idle in the beginning of
those words, but does Super-add a certain signification to them. What color of
Reason can there be to exclude the Notificativeness here: This being a word or
Command so express, so weighty, so significant, with such an Awakening word set
at the beginning of it, and there being such need, that, Jehovahs Instituted
time for his Weekly-Sabbath-worship be determinately fixed and certainly known?
How great care should men in Reputation for Learning and for Godliness take,
whose words with many do go for Oracles; and whose mistakes too often do grossly
impose upon ignorant understandings of the vulgar, and upon the Lazy minds of
Semi-Scholars who are loath to be at the pains to satisfy themselves by a
diligent search, but, take up things over credulously, upon trust without
trial? As this Learned man is an Opposer of those prefixes in the Hebrew, so
also of the Prepositive Articles in the Greek, as if these also were sometimes
Redundant, thereby Insinuating, that, it is so in this case: Whereas there is
much of significancy in those, which are Emphatical, and Deictical, noting some
certain thing in a Limited sense not indefinitely. That the prepositive
Articles in the Greek are not insignificantly redundant, but demonstratively
Emphatical, is an assertion capable of clear proof: As also, that, they are so
in this particular Case; relating to the Seventh-day Sabbath, as I have already
discovered: And I am now to give it forth to the Reader in some other Cases.
For, this Objector does not afford us any Light by which we might discern when
they are not, or when (according to his Judgment and affirmation,) they are
redundant. John 1. 21. (...)
When messengers were sent to John, to enquire, whether he were that Prophet?
They did not mean such a true Prophet only as Isaias, Jeremiah, Ezechiel,
Daniel, and such like Prophets, as they; were, but, in the most special
restrained Sense, whether he were that particular Eminent Prophet who was
Anciently promised to the Church and People of God, whom the Beleivers among
the Jews expected, with so great desire, should come, even the Messiah foretold
of in Deuter. 1 8. 15, 18, 19.
Moses Writings, that certain individual Christ: for which cause, the Article
is there Prefixed, lest that speech should have been taken by John in an
Indefinit sense, of every, if a true Prophet: and otherwise John's answer had
not been according to truth; when he denied it, saying, John 1. 21.
not; as if he had said, I am not that Prophet, no, I would not have you to
give way to one thought of this, as if I were that same Prophet so spoken of by
other Prophets: No, though I am honored with being Luke 1. 76.
a Prophet. He does not say, that he was not any Prophet at all; but that he
was not that signally-eminent Prophet; Who also in Joh. 6 14, 32. and 7. 40.
Mat. 21. 11. (...) Acts 3. 23. (...) Acts 7. 37.
other Scriptures has the same Article Prefixed to Prophet, that Prophet, and
sometimes another Pronoun demonstrative added, that same Prophet, or that
Prophet he, noting one certain Excelling Individuum. And as for the denoting
and pointing out of a particular person so also of a particular thing: As the
Field of the Potter, which the Chief Priest and Elders after counsel given and
taken thereabout, which they bought for the burial of Guests, does note a
certain determinate Field, Mat. 27. 7. Zachar. 11. 13.
even that particularly and no other, which by a Prophetical Spirit Zachariah
had foretold of: And this does the Article there, plainly point out. Acts. 9. 2.
The same you may find in other Scriptures, compared; as that way, is that
particular way of Discipleship to Christ. So Heb. 7. 21.
this is, the same particular Priest, Christ, who was a Priest confirmed in his
Office by Oath. I shall referr the discerning Reader for Mat. 1. 17. 23. and 2.
2. and 16. 16. Luke 2. 26. and 12. 32. John 10. 11. Acts 3. 14. 1 Cor. 3 11.
Ephesians. 4. 13. a multitude more may be added.
further Instances to the Scriptures cited in the Margin, where he may find,
that, the use of this prepositive Article; is significantly noting some one or
somewhat certain by an emphatical pointing out. I could give a multitude of
more Instances in the Greek new Testament, acknowledged so in the Judgment of
the most accurate discerning Greek Lexicographers and Grammarians. But, I keep
close to the matter in hand. The First place in the Scripture which treats of
the seventh day Sabbath in the History of the Creation is referred to by the
Author of the Epistle to the Heb. 4 4. (...)
Hebrews (which place I shall afterward have occasion to clear from a wrong
interpretation put upon it by this same Learned Man:) where there are two
Articles prefixed, that day. That Seventh, designing a signated and definit and
Individual day, which was and could be no other than that Seventh which was the
Last day in the First Created Week, and will ever remain so to be unchangeably,
whilst weeks do continue. Luke. 13 14 16, and 4 16. (...) and again (...)
The like is observed in other Scriptures, where the Article is doubled to
point out that eminent Seventh-day-weekly-Sabbath. O, who will give, that all
Men's hearts, particularly, that, learned men's Hearts did more stand in Awe of
every word of Jehovah Christ, who is so tender of every Consonant, and of every
Vowel therein; especially in the Ten words of his own hand writing, where he
will not suffer any one Mat. 5. 18. Here is somewhat of every jod. and chirek
to be fulfilled.
Iod or Chirek to be Injuriously altered or left out, not the least letter or
any point or part belonging to it! They that do otherwise, do so far Deuter. 4

diminish from the word. O how great has Christ's care herein been, that no man
might take any other day of the week for the weekly Sabbath Day in the
Hebdomadal revolution, but only the Seventh, which is the last in Created order
of succeeding time! So choice an excellency has the
Creating-Redeeming-Mediator put into the essence of this Seventh-day Sabbath!
As for the particular Instances in Scripture, which this learned man does give,
where he Judges this Note and prefix of demonstration to be redundant without
assigning any the least Reason why he so deemeth, I have examined every one of
them and find them to be Notificative: Of which I shall give the Reader some
short account. His first instance is in one of the Psalm. 1. 4.
Psalms, where those wicked ones spoken of are evidently pointed out to be the
same prvaricating-wickedly-revoltingones that are expressly set out in a (...).
1.
former verse of the same Psalm. So that, the note is Anaphorical, designing
such persons, of whom mention was made before, being opposed unto those who
must withdraw from them, if they would make happy progresses, or Blessed goings
on with a strait foot; which is the sweet significancy of the (...)
First word in that Psalm: Those wicked ones are fingered out to be such, whose
Counsels are very bad, whose way is so greatly erring, and whose seat is so
full of Scorn, such an accursed race of Profane ones, as of all sorts of
sinners shall be left unfruitful and fading, Chased away and condemned. And
least the learned man should think I am alone in this matter, besides the self
evidence of it upon the very place, I refer him in the Margin See Avenari^^'s
Hebrew grammar page 167. where he interprets this place, showing that, the
Nominative-Case does sometimes call to it the demonstrative (...). to set out
the Emphaticalness, as Ps. 1. Hareshagnim, Impii Illi, (...) So Bythner on Ps.
1. 1. 4, does twice express it, Hareshagnim, Isti improbi. and again,
Hareshagnim, ^lli Improbi. and a third time under the 33 Rule of his Lingua
^ruditorum, Hareshagnim, Illi Impii. Consult also for this, the Harmony of
Oriental Tongues by Johan. Ernest-Gerhard I^nen^. page 204. He emphaticum

to a skilful Hebrician, that asserts the emphaticalness of that prefix in this
place. His next instance is in Eccles. 2, 14.
Ecclesiastes; where, unto a seriously Considering, and a
deeply-pondering-mind. The Notificativeprefixes do manifestly set out the
Opposition and difference that is between an Eminently wise man, and one
notoriously foolish, with respect to that particular-subject-matter there in
hand. There is one, of such a raised sort of wise men, in such an elevated
degree, as his movings are more in the Light he is such a one as has his Eyes
in his Head, as sees his way plain before him, one circumspect and heedfull in
his goings, one wary and watchful in his steps; One that has and keeps his eyes
open, and walks in the light of Holy Scripture, and of Spiritual illumination,
holding on with an even strait Foot, foreseeing and forecasting as he passes
along: To which other Scriptures do compare Deuter. 16. 19. with Exodus 23. 8.
agree, setting out a Wise Walker by one that has his eyes open to choose and
mind his way, that, he may not mistake and wander, or stumble and fall. There
are also two Pronoun Affixes which do further Demonstrate this. And the
Opposition does set out a Foolish one, of all Fools one of the veriest Fools,
an inconstant Fool, who walks in darkness either not using his eyes, but
winking, and shutting his eyes, when Light is before him, or taking a time to
walk in when it is dark, so that he cannot find out the right way. A rash
inconsiderate Fool, that knows not whither he goes, nor at what he stumbles.
Besides the proverbial Antithesis here, does declare and commend the
excellingness and Preference of the wise man above and beyond the Fool. See
Mercer upon this place. Eccles. 2. 14.
The Hebrews and Chaldees do set out an especial part of wisdom in
Circumspection, when the eyes in the Head are deligently used: As Folly does
notably manifest it self in heedless walking. The last instance is in Levit.
18. 5.
Leviticus, where there is the notificative prefix put before Adam; which as
the English Reader may find, the Dutch Annotations in English do express, that
man which does the same shall live by them. It does signally set out a singular
excelling Adam or Man. If Ezekiel. 20. 11.
other Scriptures be Collated, that do speak of the same thing, they have all
and every one of them the emphatick Article: (...)
The Pronoun Relative also does directly with a strait foot lead to that same
man. Thus also the Greek has Romans 10. 5. Galat. 3 12.
the prepositive Article in two several places of the New Testament; where this
Scripture is cited out of the Old Testament. Let therefore those marks of
Honor by Notes of Demonstration, which the LORD has put upon it, still be
worn as an Hereditary Crown set and established upon the head of the
Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath. That day of the Sabbath, that day of this Sabbath.
As it is expressed in another Luke 13. 14, 16
Scripture. It should further be considered here, in a way of con^utation of
those, who would leave the appointing of Sabbath-times to the Church, or State,
besides what has been already mentioned, that, the weekly Sabbath Day, must be
a particular, known, determinate, Fixed, standing day, for all men to take
notice of, unchangeable in the weekly returns of it, distinct from all other
days of the same week: Levit. 23. 2, 3. Numb. 28. 9, 10. 2 King. 4. 23. Mar.
1. 21. and 6. 2. Luk 4. 16, 31. and 6. 6. and 13. 10. Acts. 13. 14, 42, 44. and
17. 2, 3. and 18. 4. and 16. 13. Exodus 20. 9, 10. and 23. 12. Mat. 12. 8. Genesis
2. 2, 3. Exodus 20. 8-11.
How else should there be a coming together for Jehova's solemn Instituted
worship? It must be such a stated constant day, as that the Governors of
Families might carefully and watchfully see to it, that, both they and their
Children and Servants; and the stranger within their Parts might remember to
observe it: That, the freed Beasts might take some Natural Perception of it, in
whose custody soever he were kept, whoever were the owner and possessor of it.
None but Jehovah Aelohim has Authority to determine and to appoint this weekly
Sabbath Day. Christ the Creator and Redeemer is LORD of the Sabbath, and he has
fixed it on the seventh the last day of the week. 1 King. 8. 59. 2 Chronicles. 8.
13, 14. Levit. 23. 3, 37.
The work of a Commanded day must be done in the day thereof, on which Jehovah
has appointed it. If men would expect from him acceptance of their work; the
word or thing (we should have a word for every thing,) of a day must be done in
his day. How express are the Scriptures in this, with respect to the
Seventh-day Sabbath! Numb. 28. 9. 10
In the Sabbath Day (the seventh day-Sabbath in the weekly returns thereof,)
there was to be the Ascension (or Ascending Sacrifice) of the Sabbath in his
Sabbath: Sabbath worship must be done on the proper day and time of it, on the
seventh day, the last day of every week, and not a day before in the same week,
nor a day after, in another week. (They, 1. King. 12. 33, 34. Dan. 7. 25. Isai
24. 5. 6.
that will change a day from what Jehovah has appointed, do devise a day of
their own Heart. Jehovahs time and Law should not be Changed) Sabbath-worship
must be Isai. 66. 23.
from the time of the Sabbath in his Sabbath. One of the great opposers of the
weekly Seventh-day Sabbath does yet grant; that Rest in the first notion of it
does include a respect to an Antecedent work or labor: And that, it is so
every where declared: And that, it is vain to imagine the World was made in Six
days, and those closed with a day of Rest, without an especial respect unto
the obedience of rational Creatures. Hereby then man in general was taught
obedience and working, before he entered into rest: For, being Created in the
Image of God, he was to conform himself to God. As God wrought before he
rested, so was he to work before his Rest* Thus he. How then can the first day
of the week be now the Resting day of that week, where the Rest is made to go
before the work and labor? This being contrary to Greated Nature? And it being
a part of man's natural Created Image of Aelohim to conform unto him in working
before Resting in the same week. Meditation on the works as well as on the word
of Christ, and on Christ himself, is a necessary useful duty. And how can this
be performed in its right proper place, where the Sabbath is carried from the
seventh to any other day of the week, (as for instance,) to the First day? For,
this Computation would put the Seventh day back to the sixth day, the Sixth to
the Fifth day, the Fifth to the Fourth day, the Fourth to the Third day, the
third to the Second day, the Second to the First day, and it would set the
First day forward to the Seventh; quite inverting the order of the Creation,
and so would engage a man on the First day which was and is a working day; to
meditate on a Sabbath Days privilege, and on the Creators Resting, and man's
Resting, which was upon another day, the seventh which is the last day of the
week; and on the Seventh day, which by this wrong account is misreckoned the
Sixth. It would put a man upon meditating on the work of the Sixth day,
whereas, it was Created and appointed the Resting-day. Thus every day would be
set out of its due place: And hence it is, that, such multitudes of namers of
the Name of Christ do so little understand, what the particular Created works
of every day in the week are; and so seldom meditate upon the peculiar works of
their proper day. Whereas, when the seventh day closes the week with a Sabbath
day, a day of Rest which is most natural, then Compare Psalm. 104. throughout
with Psalm. 98. title with the rest of that Psalm. and Genesis 1. throughout, with
chapter 251, 2, 3.
Meditation passes naturally into Created order; as to working, and as to
Resting. To speak in propriety of speech, there is but one only day in a week,
that is the Seventh day in the same week in orderly reckoning according to
Created beings, which is and must be, and can be no other than the last day of
the week. Genesis 1. 5, 8. 12, 19, 23, 3^* and 2. 2, 3.
every day has its own Peculiar proper Name: And apt and ^it names are to be
kept close unto, especially when given by Jehovah Aelohim himself; setting out
the true nature and property of things. Psalm. 147. 4. Esai. 40. 26. and 43. 1.
and 45. 3, 4, John 10. 3.
This being one Testimony of his Sovereign LORDship to call persons and things
by their own proper Names. How else can there be a Peculiar, Distinct, Certain,
Knowledge of them? Acts 4. 12. Ephesians. 1, 21. Phil. 2, 9 Number. 26. 53. Acts 1-15.
Rev. 3. 4. and 13. 8. and 17. 8.
Hence, the Name, is sometimes taken for the Person or thing: thus the Name of
God is put Gen 4. 26. Deuter. 28. 58. 1. King. 5. 5. and 8. 35. Nehem 9. 5.
Psalm. 7. 17. and 9, 2. Prove. 18. 10. Acts. 2. 21. John 17. 6, 26. and in many
other places.
for God himself: And thus the Name of Christ is put John. 1. 12. and 20. 31.
Acts 9. 14. and 19. 13, 17. 1. Cor. 1. 2, 10. 2. These. 1. 12. Rev. 3. 8. John
14. 26. Ephesians. 5. 20.
for the LORD Jesus Christ himself: And, what is observable, Compare Isai. 42.
4. with Mat. 12. 21.
the Law of Christ, is by Christ himself expounded to be his Name. Thus also,
with reference to a day, the Name of the Number is sometimes inclusive of the
day too. It were of very profitable use, if the days of the Week were every
one called by their own proper Names. Exodus 23. 12, 13. Zachar. 13. 2. Hos. 2.
17. Psalm. 16. 4. Numb. 32. 38. Josh. 23. 7.
Is it not high time to throw away those Idolatrous Names of days, (As Sunday,
etc.) of which Jebovah has prophesied, that He will cut them off?

Having thus far attended the Weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath in its strait-footed
walk in a plain path, through the whole Scripture, there thwarts the Reader
now, a straying company that would persuade him to get into another way along
with them, the way of the first day, as the weekly-Sabbath, as if this were now
the New-Testament-Dispensation. And for this, they would have him to consider
these Mat. 28. 1. Mark. 16. 2. Lu. 24, 1. Joh. 20. 1, 19. Act. 20. 7. 1. Cor.
16. 2. Rev. 1. 10. Heb. 4. 9, 10.
Scriptures, in the Margin, as Translated out of the Greek into English.

Before I return an express direct Answer to the several particular Scriptures
themselves, I advise the Reader, to ask these Transferrers of the
Weekly-Sabbath-day, from the seventh to the first day of the week, when they
judge it was, that, the first day of the week began to be the weekly
Sabbath Day? Most will say that it began on the particular day of Christ's
Resurrection, by Christ himself: Some few will assert, that, it was a little
after that Resurrection, by the Apostles of Christ: but all of them will
acknowledge, that, it was before any part of the New Testament was written. It
being so then, let the Reader improve this last Concession, and further demand
of these men, if one of the Apostles, as Peter by name, for Supposition, had
preached up this Doctrine, that, the Weekly Sabbath Day under the
New-Testament-Administration of Grace, was translated and changed from the
Seventh, which is the last day of Week, to the first day of the week; and that,
one of the Hearers had asked Peter upon what Scripture do you bottom this
Doctrine? How are, whatsoever words of God were heretofore written, Profitable,
and written for such a Doctrine? What Answer do these Men imagine, that Peter
could have returned? The New Testament was not then written, and all the
Scriptures which they then had, were the Writings of the Old Testament: Those
of Moses and of the Prophets: This Hearer searches these and can meet with no
such thing, in the Preceptive, or Prophetical, or Promissary, part of that
Word, neither could any other refer him to clear-convincing-proofs of this. How
then could this Man be well satisfied, that, this was True Doctrine, when he
could not find it in his Bible; but the quite contrary all the Old Testament
through, another day, the Seventh in order of Created Time all along Commanded
and commended! And if this Hearer should further have asked Peter, If I should
work upon the seventh-day contrary to the Precept in the Law, what Scriptures
would bear me out in so doing, when I appear before the righteous Judge, who has
in so many Words forbid this, and so often, in all the Scriptures that I have,
which speak of this thing? and if I do not observe the first day as the
Weekly-Sabbath-day, but do work on that day having Aelohim's Command and
Example for it, what Scriptures have you by which to reprove me? After this
Arguing, what could Peter have replied to this, from Old-Testament-Scripture? I
leave the Reader further to improve this in his Study and Meditation. For, the
Christianized believers did search the Scriptures, whether those things which
the Apostles of Christ taught them, were so or not, even in the Case Act. 17.
2, 3, 11. and 28. 23. and 26. 2^.
of Paul himself; who was one of the most Eminent, and most used of them all.

I shall now in the supplies of the Spirit of Holiness, according to the word
of Truth, discover the deceitful colors of these Men's wrestings of some
Scriptures, and then show the Reader the convincing reprehension of those
Colors: Which colors how fair soever to outward appearance for a while, yet
are a false Disguise, a Paint that will melt away before the fire of the Word.
The Fallacies are soon detected and confuted before a discerning and judicious,
an unprejudiced and Impartial Reader.

There are Mat. 28. 1. Mar. 16. 2. Lu. 24. 1. John 20. 1, 19.
some Scriptures in our English Bibles of the New Testament, say these
Objectors, which do speak of the first day of the week as the day of Christ's
Resurrection, when he rested from his work of Redemption, which is now
appointed and determined as the Weekly-Sabbath-day unto the Church, in memory
of Christ's Resurrection. (...).
One of the Sabbaths, does frequently occur, and is the same with the (...).
first day of the week, One being often put for First, the Numeral for the
Cardinal. The generality of the Ancients both Greek and Latin agree, whose
Testimony about the sense of aWord is the best Dictionary and Evidence we can
expect: and this same phrase used of the day of Christ's Resurrection by the
Evangelists proves it. Thus they say.

This true Doctrine is one main part of that solid Foundation, on which we are
to bottom our Hope: and O how gladly could I here lay aside this Controversy,
and be taken up with sweet Delight and with Rapturing joy into an Heavenly
Meditation on an arisen Savior! Here could I leave this unkind World and
wrangling-generation, and get up above, that, I might rise with Christ, to be
where he is, to behold his Glory! O how willingly could I here breath and long,
desire and pant, that, this arisen Redeemer, whom my Soul loves, would be with
my Spirit, that my spirit might be more with him! O that I might more
Experimentally, sensibly, satisfyingly, Know and acknowledge that Power, that
Virtue, of his Resurrection! That I might more and better Evidence my being
planted into it by walking in Newness of life! Here could I bid this Fallacious
Sophistry of Quarrellers with Christ's weekly Seventh-day Sabbath to stay
behind, whilst I find my heart with much Complacencie safely lodged in a full
Christ, and in his sull Word! O the Savourie-nourishing-Meditations that this
Subject Matter would afford! Here the admiring Soul may pass into a
spiritual-Rest by silent-Thinkings, secret Adorings, Marvelling-loves,
Exalting-Praises, and Filling-enjoyments --, But, the Reader expects an Answer.

Dutch Annotators and Translators do render it, Sabbath, Sabbaths, in every one
of the places, according to the Greek; though in Nine places they render it
Week, also; Eight of which do relate to the matter under debate; yet in every
one of them acknowledging the Greek significancy, in its propriety of speech,
to be Sabbath or Sabbaths. All Lexicons and In English Sabbath, in Latin,
Sabbatum, in other Languages is the like.
Languages that do derive it from the Hebrew, do give this to be the true
Genuine Primitive proper significancy of the word; which the very sound of the
Word does prove to every Ear that hears it. Let then the words be in the
Translation, as they truly really signify, One of the Sabbaths: Which if it
were done and received as it ought to be, what a Scriptureless thing would the
first day of the week be discovered even by plain Understandings to be? No
Translation of Scripture is any further the Word of God, than it does exactly
agree with the Original. Those who do translate these words, the first day of
the week, do borrow a Phrase, which is merely Talmudical, and not Scriptural,
and it is Invented by Men, not grounded upon the Word of God. As the words
themselves, in their own sense are not at all, either against the Weekly
Seventh-day Sabbath, or for the first day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath
now, which is the Common pretense, and the mistaken Plea: So neither is the
meaning of them in any of those places, as they are Construed in Syntax,
standing in the coherence of the Text, or as compared with other Scriptures.

Four Evangelists, (the other will be spoken to in their order,) do in all and
in every one of them relate to the Passover-Sabbaths, on one of which Christ
arose from the Dead. The Word of Truth does here expressly call and name them
Sabbaths, and therefore we must own it, that, they were such, to wit, Sabbaths,
days of Holy Rest: The Authority of the Scriptures should suffice, upon which
this Appellation does strongly bottom: Mat. 26. 17. Mark. 14. 12. Luke 22. 7.
John 12. 1. and 13. 1 and 18. 28, 39. and 19. 14.

seven Festival days were; and other Scriptures in the Old Testament do agree
hereto: For under that former Dispensation there were other days in the year,
as the days of the Passover, of Pentecost, of Booths, of the Fcast of
Expiation; which are called Levit. 23. 32. 37, 38, 39. Ezekiel 45. 17. etc. as

Sabbaths, in express words, Shadowie; Figuring, Typical Sabbaths they were.
The Weekly Seventh-day Sabbath is a natural Weekly-standing-Sabbath, of a
different nature from the other. Consider further, that, the first and the last
days of that Paschal-Festival, are expressly called and named Holy Convocations,
or Convocations of Holiness: So they were to be unto the Israelites: They were
not to do Lev. 23. 7, 8.
any Function of Servilene^s in them. The same Command as to this that is given
for the observation of the Weekly Seventh-day Sabbath in the Fourth Word: Which
does show, that, they were to be kept as Sabbaths. The same thing for the
Public Worship and service they were to do. Numb. 28. 16, 17-25.
To a day every one of those seven days of this Passover-Feast, besides the
Ascension, the Burnt-Offering which was the Dayly-Sacrifice, a Burnt-Offering

Restraint, because, though so many days together had been Sabbatized on
before; yet the people of God should not be weary of their privilege, but be
willingly restrained one day longer from their servile Work, and be retained
together in the Public Holy Assembly. Thus deriving its significancy from a
root that signities to Restrain, or to Retain. The like there was at the Feast
of Booths. Compare for this, Lev. 23. 34-39. and Nehem. 8. 18. and Deuteronomy. 31.
11, 12, 13. Thus for the Paschal-feast, all the seven days of this Feast, are
called the Passover, Deuteronomy. 18. 1-8. and so the Feast of the Fassover taken,
John 13. 1. for all the seven days of that Feast, all and every of them being
Festival-svlemnities.
Every one of those seven days was a Solemnity, or Solemn Feast, a distinct Day
in a day by themselves, in which Jehovah was praised with Great Joy. Each day
was a Solemn Assembling. This shows plainly, that those Passover-days were to
be kept Holy to Aelohim as so many Sabbath Days. There is one Opposer of the
weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, who to establish his first day in the room of the
seventh, does urge, Levit. 23. 39. where the eight day is called a Sabbath,
which he affirms from John 7. 37. to be the last day, the Great day of that
Feast of Tabernacles, from whence he would infer a first day Sabbath. Whereas,
there were but seven days in that Feast, Deuter. 16. 13, 15. Besides, that
Feast of Tabernacles or of Booths, was not a weekly Feast, and so cannot have a
weekly Antitype directly answering to it: The weekly Sabbath was spoken of
before, and settled upon the seventh day, Levit. 23. 3.

A Learned Adversary of the Seventh-day Sabbath does acknowledge, that, about
the time of the writing of the Books of the New Testament, both the Jews
themselves, and all the Heathen, which took notice of all these Feasts and
solemn Assemblies did call them Sabbaths, and not only so, But by God himself,
from their Analogy, which I shall have further occasion after a few leaves, to
make some use of. In Luke 6. 1-10. compared with Mat. 12. 1-14. we may read of
Sabbaths in the Plural number (as in many other places) of the First Sabbath, a
second Sabbath, another Sabbath; which if they be applied to the Sabbaths of
either of the Typical Feasts, then it is an evident proof, that, the days of
those feasts had the name of Sabbaths in the Scripture if they refer the
expressions to the weekly Sabbaths, then it does afford a testimony for the
Weekly Seventh-day Sabbath. Upon one of these Sabbaths our LORD Jesus Christ
did arise from the Dead. And now let the Considering-Reader bethink himself,
whether this do give any the least intimation of any Change of the
weekly-Sabbath, from the seventh to the first day of the week? Where nothing
either in the words themselves, or in the Coherence or Context, or design of
those Scriptures, or expressed or employed or intended sense of them, does
meddle at all with any change of the Weekly-Sabbath? Where there is no, either
Blessing or Sanctifying, either Name or Thing; either Institution or
separation, either Command or promise relating to the first day of the Week, as
the weekly Sabbath Day, under the New-Testament-Administration. Yet
notwithstanding all this so clear and express, which is either not understood,
or not pondered, men rise up against it, to the troubling of us, and to disturb
us if they could in our Seventh-day Sabbath, of weekly Rest: For say they, The
Hebrew word for (...)

this particular: that, if the sense were one of the Sabbaths, then the word

in one place, the first of the Week, which word is never used for One, but
First or Chief. Thus it is Objected. My Reply unto these is as follows; As
for the Hebrew word which does properly signify One, What satisfying reason can
there be given why any other Tralatitious sense should be assigned to it in
these particular places which have so plain and familiar, so obvious and
pertinent, a sense in their propriety of meaning, where these Objectors would
have it bear such a sense, as that of First? I shall examine the places usually
alleged after a few Lines more: Or if it could be evidenced, that, in some one
place it be convenient to translate it First, what cogencie of Inference can
there be drawm from thence, that therefore it must be so in the Greek word, in
the Scriptures fore-quoted? What necessity does there appear of this? Where the
Circumstances of the Text do so well and fitly admit of such a rendering,
interpretation, and construction, of the Original Words, as is according to
their true certain and proper signification, which has been already
Demonstrated? What satisfactory-spiritual-convincing-Reason is there, to fasten
such an Interpretation upon them in the Translation, as gives them a sense
improper and a meaning unusual; to which no necessity does urge and drive
either the Translator or the Annotator? Words are to be understood according to
the propriety of them, unless we be otherways unavoidably forced by some
evident Absurdity? Of which there is no Colorable appearing show here. How can
convincing Demonstrations and Infallible Conclusions be drawn from
Scripture-expressions, if a contrary liberty be assumed and granted? Why should
we yield our selves to flee to a pretended double Hebraism, of One for First,
and of Sabbaths for Week; where the plainness and expressness of the Letter,
and the Propriety and significancy of the Words, is so Consistent with, and
adapted to, the Context and the Analogy and Harmony of other Scriptures upon
that Subject Matter? I would know yet further of these men, whether the Evening
of the Sabbaths mentioned Mat. 28. 1. did belong to that which they call the
First day of the Week, or not? If they judge not, then they go quite contrary to
all the Scriptural-Accompt, which does begin the day at Evening. If they
acknowledge it to belong to that Day, then I further enquire, how, when that
Evening and the Day-part which belonged to it, when these were over and gone,
How it could be said of the Evening next following of this Day, John 20. 19.
that, it was the Evening on the same First Day of the Week, as they
mis-interpret it? For one and the same day cannot have two such Evenings, at
such a distance. As for (...)

Concurring in the same Heavenly Doctrine. As for what they further Object,

particular Substantive that belonged to it, to put us upon a diligent search
and a due collating of Scriptures. Compare those two Scriptures in the Mat. 26.

more about this, For, the Objectors themselves do acknowledge that Day is here

examining of Mar. 16. 9.
that place where it is the first of the Sabbath. First here being an Adjective
of the Feminin Gender, and Governing Sabbath a Substantive, which is of the
Neuter Gender, must necessarily be supplied by some other word, as all that
know any thing of Grammar-significancy and Syntax do acknowledge. Now, what that
word must be, we are to enquire. That word which I judge must supply it here,
must be some such word as does signify as, (...), or (...), used in other
Scriptures.
an Hour, or point or moment, or minute, or such like, as does point out some
of the first part of the earliness of the morning of that Sabbath when Christ
stood before Mary, and appeared and manifested himself unto her to have been
arisen before; This being one of those particular Sabbaths, which are mentioned
in a Mar. 16. 2.
former verse of the same Chapter in the Plural number: and these Sabbaths were
but a little before demonstrated to be the Sabbaths of the Paschal-Festival:
and therefore proves nothing as to a supposed pretended change of the
Weekly-Sabbath-day from the seventh to the first day of the Week. Further, if
we compare Mat. 16. 17. with Mark. 14. 12. and 16. 2, 9. compared.
two Scriptures: It is expressly said of another day, referring to the same
Passover-Feast, which this day under Debate does, That, it was the first day of
that Feast Unleaveneds, when they of that Dispensation were to meet to cat
unleavened Bread throughout the Seven days of that Passover-festival: Consider
then, Can this latter day, which came after, be the First day, when there is
another going before, relating to the same matter, the same Feast, which is
called or named the First Day? There is somewhat much like this in Joh. 18. 28.
another Scripture, on the day of Christ's Crucifixion, when he dyed, on that
day Jesus was led by Caiaphas to the Praetorium, or Judgment-house, and it was
Early-morning, or Morning-season, or rather Morning-Early, (Hour or Watch,)
For, some word here must be understood. Thus with respect to the matter in
hand, it is the Earliness of the Morning of that Sabbath, as I said, which is
there pointed out, as you may observe in the History by Matthew. 28. 1. Mar. 16.
2. Lu. 24. 1. Joh. 20. 1.
every one of the Evangelists that do mention it. So that, it is Rationally,
Scripturally, inferred, that, First must be supplied with Hour, or some such
word. We read Mat. 20. 3, 5* 6, 9.
elsewhere, of a Third, Sixth, Ninth, and Eleventh Hour of the day, and of Joh.
11. 9. and Mat. 20. 6.
twelve hours of the Day: and these do make up an whole day, as distinguished
from the Night-part. And therefore, there is a First Hour of the Day: The
beginning of numbering the Day part of a large Day, is from the going forth of
the Light and of the Sun: The first Hour whereof is the first Twelfth part, so
numbered of the Day-part. On the first hour of that Sabbath, of that Day, one of
the Paschal-Sabbaths, Christ appearing to be standing before Mary, Christ
having been arisen from the Dead, sometime before that. For, Joh. 20. 1* 18.
there passed some time between Christ's Actual Arising, and this appearing.
Mary had been at the Sepulcher before this, while it was yet Dark, and Christ
was arisen then, She found not her LORD there, whereupon she ran and gave an
account to Peter, and came about again, remaining a while at the Sepulcher,
having some conference with the Angels and with Christ himself a while before
she knew Him. Mary came Mar. 16. 2.
very much in the Morning: So that, Christ's standing before Mary, points out,
not his first Minute of arising, but his time of appearing to her. Sabbath here
being in the Singular Number one particular distinct (...) is added to Sabbath,
in John 19. 31.
Sabbath Day of those Paschal-Sabbaths forespoken of, and therefore cannot be a
proper supply to First, For, then it must run thus, The First day of the
Sabbath: Whereas This Sabbath was it self a Day. Here in the Way how groundless
and Scriptureless is the Conjecture of that Advocate for the First day-Sabbath,
who from hence, to wit, Christ's time of arising, as he judges it, would date
the beginning of the First days pretended Holy Rest, to be the Morning of the
First day of the week, and to last but from Morning till the Evening, making
the Night-part to be no part of the weekly-Sabbath, and as having no place in
the spiritual Rest of the Gospel to be expressed on this day, (the First day,
he speaks of) nor to be any thing distinguished from the Night of other Days of
the week! So writes a Learned Man. Thus we have a kind of half Holy Day set up
by a Man in the room of an whole Seventh-days-weekly-Sabbath, Created and
Instituted by Jehovah Aelohim. But, what part of Time shall we reckon that
Nightime to? It must belong either to Working-day, or Sabbath Day? If to
Sabbath-day-time, then it is a part of the time of a Sabbath Day: If to
Working-day-time, then we have more time than Six Working-days in one Week,
which is contrary to Scripture-revelation, and to Created Nature. For, the
Evening is as Natural to the Created Days as the Morning. The Creator Himself
did some of his works in the Night. As Genesis 1. 2.
Particularly, He created Darkness in the beginning of the Evening of the one
Day, in the first Week of the created World, and the night-part of every one of
the Large days: and it is the Commendation of a Virtuosa-Woman, that, Prove. 31.
15, 18.
she and her Household do work some part of the Night; Whereas we are expressly
forbid to do any Work of our particular Functions on the Seventh-day Sabbath:
all that kind of work is supposed to be done on the six foregoing days of the
Week: and I have before showed, page 110. to page 120. of this treatise.
that, the Night-part, as well as the Day-part belongs to the Weekly
Sabbath Day. And how does this Assertion of that learned Man agree with another
Affirmation of his, so often repeated in that Book of his, that, That part of
Time, that is and will be accepted with God, is declared and determined in the
Fourth Commandment to be the seventh part of it, or one day in seven! If so,
Then how can this Learned Man and his Followers in This, well groundedly expect
Acceptance with God; When the seventh-part of Time is not observed, as the
Weekly-Sabbath; but one half of that Seventh part is cut off by him: quite
contrary unto what God has declared and determined in the Fourth Commandment!
This incoherence and inconsistence does bewray the Darkness and doubtfulness
that is upon the Minds and Hearts of the most Learned Opposers of the
Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath. What will become of Jehovah's Laws and
Prescriptions, if Men take such an Unwarranted Liberty, at one blow to cut off
the half of the Weekly-Sabbath, contrary to the LORD's Appointments, and
contrary too, unto their own Concessions and Assertions, especially also, when
on this piece of a pretended Sabbath they give such a Loose to carnal Hearts,
as to leave any to be a Rule unto themselves for their words, works, and
actions upon this half part of a day of Rest? as if all others were Men of a
Legal Spirit, and were Judaizing Sabbatizers, that will be exact according to
the Scripture-rules of the good old way in these Matters: Who sees not what an
Unscriptural liberty even good men will be too prone to allow themselves, if
once they apprehend, that, this is referred unto themselves to judge
Determinately of? Isai. 56. 1. 8. and 58. 12, 13, 14. Eccles. 51. 2. Isai. 8.
^0. compare Gal. 6. 15. 16. with 1 Cor. 7. 19.
Where does the whole Scripture leave any Man or Men to be rules unto
themselves? Must we not in all these Cases be Directed, Determined, and Judged
by the Word? Here again, My heart would be at work in sweet thoughts, and in
raised affections toward a dear Redeemer, who has done and suffered so much
for his unworthy Creature, that, my Heart and Head and Hand may cease a while
from giving answering Solutions to Fallacious arguings. O how full, how
suitable, a good is here! Thou who read this, can thou truly say, this
Redeemer is my Redeemer; this Mediator has loved me, and has given himself
for me? Redemption is wrought out and finished by Christ for me! He will
perfect it in me as well as for me! All the just demands of the Father are
fully satisfied by the Son of His love! In the virtue of his Satisfaction and
Intercession I will go to the Father and expect Audience and Assistance,
Acceptance and a Blessing O how well will it go with them and with their Cause,
who have Christ for their Advocate? How sure is that Covenant of Grace, which
has Christ for the Surety!

The Reader now may expect, that, I say something to that part of the Objection
which does suppose the work of Redemption to have been finished on the day of
Christ's Resurrection. So that, He being then Gloriously Manifested to have
Rested from it, the Objectors think, that Christ might have good cause to
Honor the First day of the Week above any other day, as the Weekly-Sabbath-day.

Here is Men's Thinking and Reasoning, but the serious Inquirer does look for
Christ's Instituting and Commanding, which he can never find in the Word, as to
the First-days being the Weekly Sabbath Day. Redemption in the whole and in all
and every of the parts of it, and in all and every of the Fruits and effects of
it, I beleivingly confess, praise, and apply, according to those growing
measures of Scripture light, and of saving Graces, which the LORD has
graciously given me therein about this. Both those great works of
Jehovah-Christ, Creation-work and Redemption-work, are highly to be valued; and
one of them should not be set against the other, let them both be brought in,
Genesis 2. 2, 3. Exodus 20. 1. 2, 8, 9, 10, 11.
Creation-work, and Redemption work too, as proper matter for Meditation,
conference and Praise, whereby the Seventh-day Sabbath may be, Celebrated and
Sanctified in the Weekly returns of it. The observation^ of the
Seventh-day Sabbath is enforced by the Lawgiver himself to be kept holy to
Jehovah by an argument drawn Exodus 20. 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11. Deuter. 5. 12, 13,
14, 15. Isai. 56. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
from Salvation-work, from Redemption work. The LORD Jesus Christ, who is
Redeemer, was Creator too; as I have clearly proved from
self-evidencing-Scriptures. It was he that Rested from his works of Creation,
Blessing, Sanctifying, and keeping the Seventh-day Sabbath; in the First week
of the World. Jehovah Christ as Mediator did himself at Mount Sinai, Proclaim
this Law of the Ten words, whereof this of the Seventh-day Sabbath is one. It
is he who is our one and our only Isai. 33. 22. Jam. 4. 12.
Lewgiver. It is he whose Heb. 12. 18, 19. 24, 25.
Voice then shook the Earth at that Mount. It is he Acts. 7. 30-39.
who was from his Father an Angel by delegated Office, sent for this, as for
many other purposes, to be with Moses in the Wilderness. It is he Exodus 34. 1.
28. and 31. 18. Deuteronomy. 4. 13. and 9. 10. and 10. 4.
who wrote this Law of the Ten words in the two Tables. It is he 1. Cor. 10. 4,
9, Isai. 63. 9 Exodus 20. 1, 2. and 23. 20, 21, 28.
who brought his People Israel out of Egypt, and gave them this Law of the
Seventh-day Sabbath. It is he who Ps. 68. 11, 17, 18, 20. Compared with Ephesians.
4. 8, 9, 10.
came down upon that Mount attended gloriously with ten thousands of his holy
Angels, and promulgated this Law. That Sixty Eighth Psalm does evidently to a
spiritual discerner commend Christ Ps. 68. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
15, 16. and so on to the end.

and finds Christ Luke 24. 13.-31.

about seven Miles and a half, at least seven Miles, too long a Journey for the
weekly Sabbath day, especially when it was a going off from a greater
assembling at Jerusalem, the Public appointed place of worship; and this about
a private business to a little Village, an Example not to be followed, upon a
pretended new Instituted weekly-Sabbath-day: And withal the Reader observes,
that, some part of Redeeming-work was actually completed by Christ in a way of
fulfilling of a Redeeming-Type, which work was not done by him before, either
in his Birth or Life, in his Death or Resurrection, it will be time for him
ponderingly to think on his ways, and to turn his feet unto Jehovahs
Testimonies; to make have and not to slacken to entertain his Commandments,
particularly this of the weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath! To set this right precept
before him, and no longer to put away this Institution of Aelohim from him:
Which is so full and plain and clear, through the whole Scripture; and no
further to wander on, misled by men's darkning-conjectures, who would still keep
up a day of their own setting up, up the First day of the week, which as to
this of a weekly Sabbath Day, is a Creationless and Scriptureless; Restingless,
Blessingless, and Sanctifyingless, Nameless, Thingless, Commandless,
Promiseless, and Threatless-day; none of those being for it, but all for the
Seventh day.

The adversary being driven out of this hold, seeks refuge for his First day
Sabbath in some other Scriptures, cited in the John 20. 19. 26. Luke 24. 13-36.
Acts 20. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 2.
Margin, (which yet will not allow him Countenance and Warrant.) For, say they,
the good Apostles met on the First day, the day of Christ's Resurrection, which
they then observed as the weekly-Sabbath-day, in memory of his Resurrection,
and of his completing the works of Redemption on that day; Christ taught the
two Disciples on that day of his Rising, on the same day he appeared to the
Disciples, and instructed them, and did eat with them, thus assembled, and
Blessed them! The next First day of the week he chose to appear to them again:
And those Apostles Christ did Commission as his principal Church Ministers to
teach the Churches all his Doctrine, and to deliver them all his Commands and
orders, and so to settle and guide the first Churches: Which Apostles did
actually separate and appoint the First day of the week for Holy Worship
especially in Church Assemblies; They themselves frequently meeting upon that
day, for that end; and enjoining the Churches of their Plantation so to do, who
obeyed them in this: The First day is mentioned as the day of the Disciples
assembling to break Bread (which though they did it often: on other days, yet no
day else was peculiarly appointed for it.) Disciples and believers at
Christian-assemblies were not to come empty on the first day of the week, but
were on that day to deposite what they brought in to the Treasury of the
Church. And this has been the practice of all the Christian Churches in the
World, since the Apostles days: For which there is the Evidence of
Churchhistory in this matter of Fact, into which Humane Authority this must be
resolved: For this evidence of this Churches Universal constant usage is a full
and sufficient proof of the matter of Fact: That, the First day was set apart
by the Apostles for Holy worship, especially in the public Church assemblies.
They that will deny the Validity of this Historical evidence do by consequence
betray the Christian Faith, or give away or deny the necessary means of proving
the truth of it, and of many great particulars of Religion; For, without this
Historical evidence we cannot make good the Authority of any one single verse
or text of Scripture, which we shall alledg, because, we are not certain of
that particular Text, (or words) whether it have been altered or added, or
corrupted by the Fraud of the Heretics, or the partiality of some Christians;
or the oversight of Scribes, etc. thus these objecters. 1. John 4. 11. etc.
The Spirit of these Objecters is now to be tried, whether it be according to
Christ, and the word of Christ, or not? Which shall be done by a strict
examination of the two Comprehensive particulars, more especially, whether the
Scriptures alleged be truly Translated, and rightly Interpreted, and meetly
applied, as to the present Case in hand, either for matter of Fact, or for
matter of Right? And whether Human Church Histories be of such Authority with
reference to the certainty and verity of Scripture and of the Christian Faith,
and Religion contained therein?

As for those expressions in our last English Translation, of the First day of
the week, in the places cited, I have shown before, that, the words in the
propriety of speech according to the truth of Grammar-etymology in their proper
significancy and regimen of syntax, are, one of the Sabbaths, the Notation of
which Phrase in its plain meaning exactly agreeing with the real Nature of the
thing punctually set out by it, it has been discovered and proved, that, Mat.

as to those places in the Evangelists, it was one of the Paschal Sabbaths,
which does speak nothing as to any substituting of the First day of the week in
the room of the Seventh day as the Weekly Sabbath now, which is the pretense of
our Opposers: As neither do the other Scriptures cited where that Expression is
used, once in the Acts 20. 7. 1. Corin. 16. 2.
Acts of the Apostles, and another time in the first Epistle to the
Corinthians; for one of the Sabbaths. In that place of the Acts, was one of
those Seven Sabbaths between Passover and Pentecost, as will be evident to an
unprejudiced diligent Comparer of the Acts 20. 6, 7, 16. compared with Levit.
23. 11,-16.
Scriptures cited in the Margin; which is quite another thing from what the
adversaries do urge it for: And as for the evidence of this, there is express
mention made both of the feast of unleavened Bread, which was the
Passover-Feast, in the verse immediately going before the place cited; and also
of Pentecost in nine verses after relating to that season in the same year;
within the compass of which two Feasts inclusively, were seven Sabbaths, upon
one of which that meeting was of Paul with the Disciples: Which does hold forth
a clear Truth, contrary to what it is alleged for. As for what Paul did more
after that Sabbath day was over, at the going in of the Sun, when another day
came on, which was merely occasional, he being in a preparedness to depart on
the next day after the Sabbath: Such as Acts 20. 7-12.
his continuing of his speech till midnight, his raising up Eutychus, his
eating of Bread, his talking with them a long while, even till break of day,
then departing: So long Preaching and conference all the Night long is not to
be enforced as a necessary Sabbath-duty, the Scriptures no where so enjoining
it, and if this objector would assert it, so far at least as till the midnight,
(according to his account of an whole day in England from midnight to midnight,
which I have shown in this treatise to be no right reckoning, but contrary to
the word of truth:) Let him and the other learned man whom I answered but a
little before, who shuts out the night-part from being any part of the
weekly-Sabbath-day, let them I say, if they can find no better work for their
time, contend about that matter. This Night-part belonging to the after
day-part, as making up the whole next day after the Sabbath, was not observed
by Paul as the weekly-Sabbath: for you may Acts. 20 13, 14.
there Read how some of the Disciples went before to ship, and sailed to Assos,
there intending to take in Paul: For, so had he appointed, minding himself to
go afoot: And when he met with them at Assos they took him in, and came to
Mytilene: this was no Weekly-Sabbath-work, no necessity nor mercy enforcing or
warranting them thereunto. As for the breaking of Bread, whether that expressed
in the seventh, or the other in the eleventh verse, if it were admitted to be
used in the Administration and participation of the LORD's Supper, yet this
objector himself does affirm, that it was often done by Apostles and Disciples
on other days of the week than on that which he so earnestly contends for: And
whereas he does assert that no day else but only the First day of the Week was
peculiarly appointed for breaking of Bread in that ordinance: Whither shall we
go for a warrant and proof of this? We find no such appointment by our LORD in
the Scriptures; and the Objector cannot but acknowledge, that our LORD Jesus
Christ did institute and administer it at the first appointing and dispensing
of that New Testament ordinance of the supper, on another day of the Week, than
the first day: For, the Objector affirms elsewhere, that the passover day in
that year was the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath: and 1. Cor. 11. 23.-26.
Paul does expressly say that it was the same Night in which he was betrayed;
then it was, that, he took the Bread and the Cup in this LORDly Supper: And
this did Paul receive from the LORD, and so did deliver it unto that
Corinthian-Church of Saints, as that word-Rule by which they were to reform
their abuses which had crept in amongst them, as to that ordinance
particularly, and according unto which they were exactly to measure all their
Administrations. If this Objector do urge humane Authorities without
Scripture-evidence, we shall show the vanity and weakness, the incogency and
unconvincingness of that empty Plea after a while. Reader exercise thy
discerning here? Is there any thing in this place that speaks at all of any
change of the weekly-Sabbath from the Seventh to the first day of the Week? do
either the significancy of the words or the intendment of the place, or the
force of the context, or any necessary unavoidable consequence, present any
such thing to an impartial unprejudiced understanding, which does report a
matter of fact done upon another day, not meddling with any state of this
question about this matter of Right. Has the First day of the Week either the
name of the Weekly Sabbath or the substance and essence of it? Is there any one
word of Command found here requiring beleiving Christians to observe the First
Day as the Weekly Sabbath? Is there any Promise made over to the weekly
observers of it As such? Is there any threatening denounced here against the
not-observers of it, As such? Is there any mention made of Christ's being the
Author of it, As such? Is there any one expression of its being instituted by
Christ, As such? Is there any one word or Phrase against the the Seventh days
being now any longer the Weekly-Sabbath-day? Can this Objector satisfy and
establish thee upon any firm ground, such as is Scriptural, by any contrary
arguing, wherein nothing of all this can befound? The plain Historical
Narration does inform us that Paul abode at Troas, seven days, in the sixth
verse: And whether he came to Troas on the First day of the week, search may be
made: Troas standing near the Sea of Hellespont in Asia the less, whether Paul
came from Philippi, that was situated in Greece, which was on the other side
of Hellespont, or of the Euxine Sea; which Sea did lie between Europe and Asia
the less: Acts 18. 5. and 19. 21, 22.
Macedonia, whence Paul came, was a Province in Graecia; There at Troas Paul
stayed seven days inclusively, in the fifth and six verses of this twentyeth
Chapter, spending a Seventh-day Sabbath amongst them, and then went away from
them the next Week, in the Seventh and eleventh verses, after the
Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath. The Objector therefore mistaking the day to be the
first day of the week, whereas, It was the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, all that
which he does wrongly build upon that mistake, falls to the Ground, together
with that mistake, This answer, drawn up from the true proper translating of
the words, one of the Sabbaths, I mainly stick to, as plain, convincing, and
self Evidencing, though I have elsewhere drawn up much more about it: We are
not hurried away with noise and multitude: But that which swayes with us, and
keeps our hearts in an awesul fear, and trembling-joy, and believing
establishment, with sweet satisfaction, nourishing delight, and great
complacency, is the Word of the adored Almighties, clearly opened,
well-agreeingly-collated, soundly understood, and rightly applied: Christ and
his word have their Authority with us, beyond any man or men whatsoever, or any
or all of their sayings to the contrary. His words do always best express
things, according to the true Nature of them in their own familiar sense, which
the Holy Spirit does give of them in their respective places. The same Genuin
significancy has this Phrase in that passage to the 1. Cor. 16. 2
Corinthians, where also it is, in true propriety of speech, not the first day
of the Week, but one of the Sabbaths, meaning according to the proper
significancy of the words, phrase, and thing, either one of the Sabbaths
between Passover and Pentecost inclusively, as in the former place; i. Cor, 5.
7, 8 and 16. 2, 8.
of which two Feasts he makes express mention in the same Epistle, and of one
of them, in the same Chapter; or else one of the Sabbaths, of one or other of
those Three great Festivals spoken of Deuter 16. 16, 17.
else where: The Feast of Unleaveneds, The Feast of Sevennies. and the Feast of
Booths, or leaf-hutts, especially at the time of ingathering the yearly Fruits
and increase of the Earth, at which time they were able by such a revolution of
a year to pass a Judgment upon Jehovahs Blessing of them, (which cannot be so
well estimated on every Weekly return,) for, then, all the Males that appeared
before the Faces of Jehovah were not to appear empty, but every man according
to the gift of his Hand, or according to the Blessing of Jehovah his God (which
is much the same with the expression in this Epistle,) which he had given him,
And this reply has consent and agreement with other Scriptures, and with the
nature of the Duty of Charitable Relieving and is evident upon the same place.
It is the confession and acknowledgment of an adversary, as was Noted a few
leafs before, that, about the time of the writing of the Books of the
New Testament, both the Jews themselves, and all the Heathen that took notice
of them, called all their Feasts and solemn assemblies, their Sabbaths:
Because, they did no servile work in them, they had the general Nature of the
weekly Sabbath in a cessation from Labor. It is known and confessed, says he,
that at that time (when Paul wrote to the Church at Colosse, which they suppose
to be about twenty and nine years after Christ's Ascension into Heaven:) all
Iudaical observation of days, or the days which they religiously observed,
whether Feasts or Fasts, Weekly, Monthly, or Annual, were by themselves and all
other called their Sabbaths. They were so called by God himself from their
Analogy. Thus he. And this First Epistle to the Corinthians is reckoned by some
to be sent unto that Church about two and twenty years after Christ's ascension.
So that to translate the words, one of the Sabbaths is the most proper
significant Rendering, the most pertinent to the drift and Scope, and the most
Harmonious in consent with the whole Scripture that treats of this matter: The
believing Corinthians were to lay a way by themselves somewhat of their income,
proportionable to the LORD's prospering of them in a way or Journey of their
particular Trades, Functions, and callings: Thus, gathering some Treasure,
that, they might have in a readiness, that which might afford a 1 Cor. 16. 1,
2. Romans 15. 25, 26. 2 Cor. 8. 1. Gal. 2. 10.
necessary supply of the poor Saints at Jerusalem, that, the collection might
be in a preparedness against that time when Paul was to call for it, and to
carry and distribute it to that End. Let the Reader here observe, that Corinth*
(to the Church in which City Paul did write this Epistle, out of one passage of
which, the Adversary would raise an objection,) was that city Acts 18. 1. 11.
where Paul had been a public preacher, according to all or every Sabbath: So
that Paul did keep the Seventh-day Sabbath there in that Particular place
constantlyin this City of Achaia, A City Situate near the Sea, where he taught
the word of God, one whole year and six months, and that by a special Call and
encouragement from the LORD Jesus Christ: So far was he from setting up the
First day in the room of the Seventh Day, as to the weekly-Sabbath, that even
there he was a diligent Observer of Acts 18. 4.
every Seventh-day Sabbath: For, so the Holy Spirit himself calls that day, the
Sabbath. Here is therefore no firm bottom in this place objected to ground a
transferring of the weekly Sabbath from one day to another, which is nothing at
all the design of this place (as neither is it of any other place through the
Word of Truth.) The Words in their true proper significancy are according to
one of the Sabbaths: The Article being omitted here, it does signify
distributely, according to one or other, or each of those Sabbaths: So that,
the day here specified does relate to some one or other of those
Sabbath-Festivals forementioned. There were Lev 23. 10. 20, 39. Luke 6. 1.
Exodus 23. 14, 15, 16.
Harvest-Seasons, when the fruits of the earth came in, and they could judge
somewhat of their Increase, in corn and gain, That Word which is translated a
Collection, is such a Collect or Collation, as is concluded by Reasoning, an
inferring from reckoning and casting up an account: every one as it went well
with him, in his Voyage, Journey and Trade, at such seasons of the year when
the profits came in; whether at and from the Sea, or the Land: (and so 1 Cor.
16. 2. (...)
the Word signifies in propriety of Speech, according as the LORD has given a
good Voyage, or a prosperous way, or Journey) accordingly should they honor
Aelohim with their substance and increase, by setting apart a due proportion
out of their Estates to relieve needy ones. The charitable supplying of the
poor with necessaries (especially if poor Saints, which was the Case here) is a
natural Religious Duty under all the Dispensations of Grace, Old and New; A Law
of Mercy and of Love still in force, and ever will be whilst there are such
Objects of pity. Some few such I do know, who do practice suitably, treasuring
somewhat every year, and at some quarterly Incomes, and sometimes by shorter
Returns, out of their revenue and increase, out of which to take, as Cases do
call for it, (being in a preparedness through Grace to part with the rest, if
necessity were such:) So that upon all such occasions they readily go and fetch
out of that store which was laid up for such a purpose, in a way of thankful
acknowledgment of Gods blessing of them in their outward Estate 1 Cor. 16. 1,

pursue Love which he had so largely described and commended a little before.

Having opened the expression of one of the Sabbaths, and shown that it refers
in all the places to another matter and purpose than that for which it is
brought, there is somewhat yet further to be spoken to, about Christ's appearing
to his Disciples on the Day of his Resurrection: Which was observed, say the
Objectors, by them, as the new Weekly-Sabbath-day, in memory of his
Resurrection, as is pretended, etc.

That, the Disciples did not meet on that day, as now the weekly-Sabbath-day,
in memory of Christ's Resurrection, is evident; because, they did not the most

believe, that he was arisen: For which their misbelief their LORD and Master
does check and rebuke them; he having so often inculcated this thing upon them
about his Suffering, his Death and his Resurrection. How often had he told
them, that he was to rise again from the dead on the third day? That Word (...)

again, over and over, upon several occasions: In every one of the places, the

Article is added and prefixed, and to one of them the Article is doubled. All

Demonstrativeness of it, noting a certain determinate day to be known of all
that would seriously consider it. (...) Mat. 12. 40. and 27. 63. Mar. 8. 31.

The same word for Significancy in another part of Speech, is used four times
in the new Testament: Three times by Christ himself, to point out the certain
determinate Day of his Resurrection to be the Third Day: Which also in one of
those four times is expressly acknowledged by his Adversaries themselves who
labored to obscure the glory thereof Mat. 12. 40. The (...) does directly
answer to the (...) Jonah was in the bowels of the Fish, three days and three

correlatae significationis, which here is (...), the (...) therefore here is,

. In one of the places, both the distinct parts of an whole natural large day
are punctually set down with respect to every one of the several three days:
Three days and three nights, used for the whole time of the darkness and light
in one succeeding course, and exemplified as to the matter of Fact, in the Case
of a particular person, of Jonah, (the History of whom is one of the Books of
the Scriptures of Truth) who was herein a Type of Christ. As to his being
raised on the third day. It is a day distinct from two complete foregoing
Days: Mar. 8. 31.
In one of the places, that, Christ might make sure of clearing this matter to
their understandings, and fixing it the deeper in their memories, so as it
might not leak through their Vessel of Remembrance, and also of having the
three days, and the three nights included, he expresses it by a (...),
immediately at, and in, the end of the Third day, and passing into the moment
of the next day.
Preposition, signifying after, after three: For, so is the meaning of it, when
it governs an Accusative Case; and this Praeposition is confessed in one of the
places by his open Enemies: and if those thought on it, and called it to mind,
the more excuseless were the Disciples, who did not for a while so credit it:
Whereby it is manifest, That; they could not actually design this, as the end
of observing such a day, which themselves did not yet believe so to be, though
it were declared to them by some to whom he had appeared. So that, this part of
the Objection is Scriptureless and Reasonless; and as for Christ's appearing to
the eleven in the Mar. 16. 14, Joh. 20. 19.
places cited: It is also Compare Luke 24 13. 36. with Mar. 16. 12, 13, 14.
Joh. 20. 19. 22.
clear by the Scripture-Accompt, that, that day, on which Christ had conference
with Cleopas and another Disciple, in their way from Jerusalem to Emmaus, was
over-past and gone before, that appearing of his to the Eleven: For, the day
was upon closing when they went into that Village, where Christ spent some time
with them: And those two Disciples had Emaus is 7 miles off, and West of
Jerusalem; so does Sandy. write in the Relation of his journey, page 174.
Bunting in his Itinerary does measure it about 8. miles from Jerusalem. page:

sixty Furlongs to travel afterward, back again from Emmaus to Jerusalem: and
they were at that meeting where Christ appeared to the Eleven: The Sun was gone
in before that time. So that if this pretended Historical Hint be mistaken by
those Objectors; so then is the John 26. 26.
next also, which they alledg of a second appearing, as to the particular day
of it, the place it self does expressly confute their assertion: For that
appearing was after eight Days: After observe, which could not therefore be
that very day which they name: Not the first day by their own Computation:
Besides, what cogency is there in this kind of arguing from Christ's appearing
to the Disciples? For he AAs 1. 3. John. 21. 1. 14. Luke 24. 42, 43.
appeared often to them in the forty days between his Resurrection and
Ascension; and once when they were Fishing, which is no
weekly-Sabbath-days-work and employment, at which time also Christ did eat
somewhat of what Fish they had taken. Upon a due long serious Consideration of
the whole of this matter: There appears nothing to me, not the least show or
color of any sound Scriptural reasoning in all these Allegations, which men in
Reputation have been by a Traditionary Religion in this, so fond of. What a
great way about do they go, quite out of any Scripture-path to fetch in
something that might look like an Argument with those who take up such matters
of humane invention upon Trust from their misguiders, who in this teach them to
Err in a Dark-walk, where they see not how nor whither they go; and then tell
them, that the mind of Christ in this, is a great Deep, and not so easy for
plain Understandings presently to fathom: Whereas we who are brought under the
New Testament-Administration of Grace are put into a state of clearer Light
than those were in, who were under the former Dispensation. Doctrines, Duties,
Graces, Privileges, do shine forth in more Glory before us 2 Cor. 3. 6. 18.
, as the Apostle does argue in the second of his Epistles to the Church at
Corinth, the design of which passage is to show the New-Testament-Glory to be
excelling: They of old had a veil on their Ministration, by Figures, Types and
Shadows, whereas we now do, at least we may, and should, behold things with
unveiled Face: As for the Laws of the Ten words, particularly this of the
Weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath, they are clear as the Light: And therefore the Holy
Scriptures of Truth do give them that Proy. 6. 23. Psalm, 119. 105. Psalm. 19. 7.

Name of Light, of self-evidencing and clear-shining are they, containing
Commandments so right, in all things, so enlightening the eyes of men's
understanding, though otherwise they be but simple, silly, and weak; the very
opening, entrance or door of which Word does give light to make the silly ones
to be understanding ones, especially when the Commandment comes in the
Demonstration of the Spirit, and with Power, and former pre-conceptions and
prejudices are laid aside: A Law so guiding the Obeyers of it, to walk in such
paths of Rightness; a Law so true, so holy, so just, so good, so spiritual, so
perfect, such a Law of Liberty, setting a renewed, enlarged heart so free to
run in its Way: A Law so comprehensive, a Law so Ephesians. 4. 24. Col. 3. 10. Romans

formed in right humane Nature, being at the first concreated with it: A Law so
convincingly opening it self, and its true mind, and its proper meaning, and so
fully expounded throughout the whole Scripture, which is a large exposition
upon it, insomuch as that all the rest of the Word, so far as concerns Duties
to be performed, and sins to be avoided, is but as it were Jehovah Aelohims
Commentary upon, and Interpretation of, it. So that here, Those of an inquiring
Spirit are led safely out of the Maze of those perplexing difficulties, which
the Objectors reasoning about the necessariness of human Histories to make up a
full evidence of the Scriptures in the matter of the first day, would hurry
them into, and such diligent re-searchers are brought into a plain way, Jer. 6.
16. Psalm. 139. last ver.
and the Good Old way, or the way of hidden Ages, or of Eternity. The Words of
this Law do carry a plain Evidence in them: As, all the rest, so particularly,
the fourth Word or Command, concerning the weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath: It has
in it self a common and familiar understanding, the sense and meaning whereof
does appear at the very first sight: It is but hear or read, and every man,
that is endued with Reason, and will exercise it without any prepossession or
imposings, will forthwith conceive aright of it, That, the weekly-Sabbath-day
is the Seventh-day; That the Seventh-day is the weekly-Sabbath-day. This
Objector does assert it, That it is agreed on, that the Passover that year when
Christ was cruci^yed fell on the Sabbath Day. It must here be his meaning, the
Seventh, which is the last day of the week, which he takes to be the First day
of that Feast of unleavened bread; On which the Paschal Lamb, according to
Institution, was to be eaten, which was not the First day of the Week, but the
Seventh. Upon this Supposition, I would thus questioningly argue; either Christ
that year kept the very day of Passover, according to Institution, or not; if
Christ kept the true Passover-day (as I do not at all doubt but that he did;
for Mat. 3. 15. John 17. 4.
he was to fulfill all righteous Observances, and accordingly he did: It being
the Work which his Father gave him to do, and which he finished: The Antitype
directly answering in every thing with great exactness to the Type: And the
History in the written Word which does report this matter of Fact in Christ,
does expressly call that day, on which he did with his Disciples eat the Paschal
Lamb, the Passover-day Mat. 26. 2, 17, 18, 19. Mar. 14. 1, 12, 14, 16. Luke 22.
1, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15. In Matthew it is four several times called the passover,
and the Article (...) prefixed as many times, and on one of those four times it
is so named by our LORD Jesus Christ himself, who put this word into the mouth
of his Disciples, bidding them to use it unto a stranger-Host, who cannot
rationally be thought to understand it in any other Sense, than in the common
acceptance of that word. In Mark it is four several times named the Passover,
(...), with the Article prefixed in every one of those places. In Luke it is
six times denominated the Passover, having the Article five times prefixed with
a (...) added in one place, and with a Description of it in another Verse, by
that Feas. of Unle^^eneds, (...), which was named, or called, or said, or
worded a Passover. Further yet, that this passover might appear to be that
solemn Feast of the former Dispensation, John 18. 39. and 19. 14. it is called
the Feast, which name is given to it under the Old Testament-Administration,

, as the Scriptures in the Margin will undeniably prove, and he dying the same
day, which was the Passover-day;) If this be granted by this Opposer, to be the
Weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, what then becomes of all the rest of his arguing
and pleading for the First day, which according unto this Supposition was not
that particular day of the Week, on which Christ arose from the dead? For,
according to this that First day was the next immediate day after his death,
and could in no Sense be called the Third day on which he rose again: If he
say, That the true Passover-day, which not Christ, but the Jews kept, was the
day next after the death of Christ, we call for an Answer to the forecited
Scriptures in the Margin, and expect a Word-proof for what he asserts:
Although, if that could be cleared, yet has it no Rightness or Forcibleness of
arguing in it to demonstrate what it is brought for, as to a First-day-Sabbath:
But if those Scriptures do, in so many express Words, give the day of Christ's
being apprehended and condemned and crucified and killed the First day of
unleavened bread, and the Passover-day, whilst we have the Scripture thus
speaking, we have no cause to be moved at what Humane Authorities and
Church-Histories do record to the contrary. And this has now brought me to an
Examination of the validity or invalidity of Church-histories and of humane
Authorities in these matters.

Though several of the Ecclesiastical Historians have been examined by me upon
this subject matter; and I have some Collections by me about it, enough to show
how little credit is to be given unto those kind of Authorities, which are so
fallible, and sometimes so self-contradicting, and so altogether unsatisfying,
when the matter of Right comes to be Inquired after, and determined, any
further than they do speak the mind of Christ in his word (For, either in these
Cases of Conscience they write and speak according to the word, or not? If they
do, let these Scriptures be particularly pointed to, with which they accord. If
not, they are not to be received or followed.) Yet, in regard, that, my design
is to bring all to the Scriptures of truth, referring this and all else under
Aelohim to their Judgment, I shall therefore now debate the Principle with this
objector. John 20. two last ver.
So much of matters of fact, as do relate to matters of right, and as are
necessary for us to believe in order unto Salvation, is Recorded in the word of
truth: Whereunto the whole Scripture is profitable; which is enough for us, if
no more were written by me, concerning this particular question in hand: For,
that Scripture referred to, is proper and pertinent to this purpose, about
Christ and his Resurrection, and his appearing to his Disciples, and his
Blessing of them, and conference with them, as is plain, in the foregoing part
of the same Chapter; and other Scriptures collated and compared with this, do
evidently speak it. But, we have yet much more to say about this. To assert the
perfection of the Scriptures, is one of the great truths of the present Age:
The forces of Earth and of Hell are now joining together and putting forth
their strength to assault and to attempt the overthrow of this useful Doctrine:
As it was in the days of Christ's Flesh, when he was familiarly Conversant here
on Earth, the Roman Power the Grecian Wisdom the Jewish Traditions, Ethnic
Philosophers, and Diabolical possessions, all the humane and devilish Force and
Art and invention was called together to War against Christ and against his
word. So in the latter days; the Worldly might, Old and New Philosophy,
Institutions and Impositions, Histories and Traditions, Inventions and
Authorities of men, unwritten (pretended necessary) verities, General
Councils, sayings of those whom they call Fathers, Articles of Faith composed
by men, Confessions and practice of Protestant Reformed Churches, the judgment
and practice of Learned and Godly men, these and such like Extra-scriptural
places, are the swaying Authority with many whereby Antichristianism and
Antiscripturalism in a many of particulars are still held up and maintained
against the LORD and against his word, Isai. 40. 5, 6, 7, 8.
who in this Providential day is pouring contempt upon all Flesh, upon men and
upon their sayings, bringing a Blast upon them (so far as they are contrary to
sound Doctrine, and do oppose the mind of Christ's Revealed in the written
word:) and is putting a Crown on Christ, and an Honor upon his word. the
Testimony of men may be, and often is, in Fact, Erring and Fallible, uncertain
and lying, self-contradicting and unsatisfying. Into which therefore the
Christian Doctrine Faith and Religion is not to be resolved; either in whole or
in part: For, the word of Jehovah is like himself, who is the Author of it, of
invaluable veracity; and of unchangeable truthfulness. John. 14. 6. and 17. 17.
Romans 3. 3, 4. Tit. 1. 2. 2. Tim. 2. 15. Ps. 119. 142.
He truth it self, and his word The Truth, He a God that is true, and that
cannot lie, and his word (That which is truly, purely such) the word of truth.
His Law is the truth. The asserters of the Seventh day to be the Weekly Sabbath
(for which we have the whole Scripture) are charged with Error, because we
will not be resolved by humane Authorities to own the First day in the Room of
it: Whereas, if men do err, greatly err, it is Mat. 22. 29. Mar. 12. 24, 27.
therefore, because they know not the Scriptures; nor the Power of God put
forth in a word-way. To assign somewhat else for a cause of this, which is not
a cause, is a by-way of paralogizing-deception, of sophistical-arguing, and of
Fallacious disputing: The LORD Jesus Christ Mic. 3. 5. Mat. 23. 7, 8, 9, 10. 2.
These. 2. 1, 2, 3 4, 5, etc. Gal. 1. 6-9. 1. Pet. 5. 3 2. Cor. 1. last. part.
Isai. 3. 13, 12, 17. and. 9. 16. and 28. 7. Jerem. 23. 13, 32.
does not in his word (and where else as from him shall we look for it?) assign
this as a cause of man's erring, that, they do not know the magistral dictates
of humane Rabbis: It is the proud Arrogance of the Antichristian usurper, to
impose his own placits upon the Churches, as if he were imperial Dictator to
men's Souls, and universal Monarch over their Consciences: Neither is their
Erring from hence, that, they know not the Ancient Records of uncanonicall
Church Histories, which do sometimes write Contrary to themselves and to one
another, as those do understand who have been faithful diligent comparers and
collectors of such passages, and this both in matters of Fact and in matters of
Right, and this Objector himself does confess he Judges, that some of the
writings of these Ancients are spurious and corrupt. And how few are there of
those, to whom the Gospel is preached, and upon whose Hearts that word of Grace
and of Truth does take most saving holds (to which word the LORD himself does
bear witness) are versed and read in this kind of Ecclesiastical History? And
which way shall they be ascertained, that, it has been all of it read over by
others, by their Guides and teachers particularly, or that the report is
faithfully brought to them, or if that were, whether they ought to be swayed by
it? Were Church-Histories unerringly inspired? Who is so bold, as downright to
assert this? Or if any were so daring, how can he prove it? Who of our plain
Converted People had humane Histories in his thoughts when he was thoroughly
Regenerated and graciously visited from Christ, and from the Father of Christ
by the Spirit of Christ in the word of Christ? What a kind of Faith is that,
which does ultimate it self into humane Church Histories? He, that would have
judged of the state and Case of Jehovah's Church and people in the days of
Ezra. 4. 15, 16.
Ezra by making search in the book of those Ecclesiastical Records, and have
judged according to what was Historifyed there, would have brought in an hard
Charge of Rebellion and of Sedition against them, and have been ready to have
irritated the powers that were over them against them, as their Adversaries
did: Neither do men therefore err, because they know not the Tradition of the
Elders, which has long obtained by common Custom, and by little Controlled
usage, so as to plead prescription. 1. Pet. 1. 18, 19. Galat. 1. 4, 14. Mar. 7.
5, 8, 9, 13.
unscriptural Customs and Tradition is a part of that Redemption, which our
LORD has, wrought out for his People: And it is a choice Mercy to be thoroughly
delivered from them: For, in the event and effect, they would un LORD Christ,
and the word of Christ, of his and of its due Authority: For which he condemned
those Scribes and Pharisees of his days, who would have obtruded these upon
him, and upon his Disciples; but he confutes them by his word, and refers
all to this. He, who is of a diligent observing inquiring Spirit, and is versed
in this kind of the Historical part of human learning in Ecclesiastical
Centuriators, may meet with enough to take him off from doting on such fallible
Authorities, which are not a sure ground of judging in matters either of
Doctrine or of Fact.

In the matter of Doctrine, how common is it for one to affirm what another of
them does contradict, as about the Millennium, or the Thousand years Reign,
with many more instances that might be given, as about Free Grace and about
Free will, about Bishops and Presbyters, about the vision of God whether the
Souls of departed Saints be Blessed with it till the Judgment of the great day,
or not? with such like. Which of those now shall carry away the state of the
question? In some Cases, the Major party often went the wrong way as in the
Rites and Ceremonies of Baptism and of Prayer, and in many Feasts and Fasts,
and diverse such humane inventions, by which they added their own corrupt
mixtures to Christ's Pure institutions. As for the Churches in the first
centuries after the Apostles, how shall we be ascertained, that, they were the
most pure and perfect Churches, seeing some of those that were of Apostolical
plantation did so apostatize, make such a sudden defection from the
Gospel-purity, and were so much corrupted in the Apostles own times, as those
particularly 1. Cor. 11. Galat. 1. 6. Revel. 2. and. 3, chs.
of Coriuth, and Galatia, and some of the Seven Churches of Asia? And how is it
possible for to come at a sure undoubtedness of knowing what was the universal
Judgment and practice by uniform consent of those Churches in the first
hundreds of years after the New Testament canon or rule was Written! Were there
no learned and Godly men, such as were counted Fathers in the Churches, from
whom we receive no Writings at all? May not some of their Writings have been
lost? Are there not false copies of the writings of some of them? Are they not
supposititious and counterfeit and corrupt? Do they not vary widely in their
Interpretations of one and the same Scripture? How can these uncertainties be a
firm Ground and sure evidence of the Authentical meaning of the word of God?

How unconcluding and unsatisfying also is their Testimony; in the matters of
fact, when one of equal Antientness, and Authority does gainsay another, or
when some greater Authorities as some of them were esteemed, would step in and
over rule, and when they charge one another with misreports and mistakes, how
Sandy a foundation is there here for any Spiritual discerner to build upon;
take one or two instances, some in the History of Christ's life do expressly
Record, that, he was near Fifty years old when he was put to death, whereas
others of them in their Chronologies do with equal confidence write, that he
was then but about thirty and three years of age. So also about the particular
Language wherein the New Testament was first spoken and written.

Nor is the Original of erring from hence, that, men know not the Counsels of
the Sanhedrin, or the sayings of the Ancient Fathers. The Scriptures do mention
such decrees of Councils, and such applauded sayings of the ancients, and those
by such who counted themselves the only and the whole Church of God, as were
quite contrary to Christ's mind in his word, such as perverted and wronged his
Word. Such as made it a sufficient cause of unsynagoguing, of excommunicating,
for any Man to confess, that, Jesus was the Christ: which yet was one of the
plainest and greatest truths and Duties; such as passed into a Law, and
accordingly were commands given forth, that, the Apostles should not upon pain
of Imprisonment, or of worse than that, speak at all or teach in the name of
Jesus: Shall we be determined by such humane Councils as these? By such
Councils as sometimes Clash one with another? (So it was a long while between
the Councils of the Eastern and Western Churches.) By such Councils as
sometimes reverse their own decrees and then make quite contrary Canons? It is
Isal. 8. 1620. Galat. 6. 15, 16. and 1. Cor. 7. 19. Philip. 3. 16.

unerring rule, which we must measure our all by; and in all things walk by, and

Neither is this a spring of error, that, we do not know nor own unwritten
verities, as Scripture-Supplements to be received by the People from their
Leaders upon trust without trial. If a Doctrine be brought to us we must see
whether what is written in the word of the LORD be for it, or not; and
accordingly either receive or reject it: What is written is that which does
call for our Faith. We must 1 Corin. 4. 6. (...).
not favor about that which has been written: So should the place in the
Margin be read. Paul would not say or speak one thing besides or without the
word by Moses and the Prophets, what was authorized and warranted by their
writings. Beleivers are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,
Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner Stone of it. How shall we know,
that, That which is unwritten is Beleivable verity, healthful Doctrine,
wholesome sound truth? How shall our Hearts get to be out of doubt, that it is
so? Ps. 119. 98, 99 100. Acts 17. 11. 1 These. 2. 13. 1. Cor. 1. 12. 13, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23. Mat. 5. 19. Isai. 42. 4, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21. Jerem. 8. 8, 9. 1.

Nor does error arise from hence, that, men do not know nor approve of the
Judgment, opinion, and practice, of those who are reputed the Learned and the
Godly in the present Age, held forth in their Commentaries, Treatises, and
Actings? Sound sincere beleivers do often Experience, that, Jehovah through his
Commandments does make them wiser than their Enemies, they have more
understanding than all their teachers, because they Love his Law, and make his
Testimonies their meditation: The LORD Christ has declared against those (be
they otherwise of never so great a Name; and in never so much reputation
amongst men) who dissolve one of the least of his Commands, in the Law of his
Ten words, and do teach men so: And how much is it to be lamented, that any of
the teachers of others, have their hands so deep in this Trespass, as to preach
or to print any thing against this Glorious perfect Law, and the great
Honorable things thereof! God is making the wisdom of the wise to perish, and
bringing to naught the understanding of the intelligent, when it does oppose
Christ and his word and Law, Whilst precepts of men are taught the People, by
their civil and Church-Guides, and are made the rule of fearing and of Serving
Jehovah, he will proceed to deal Wonderfully with such a people and
marvellously: For, the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the
understanding of their men of understanding shall hide it self, though they
hide their Counsels never so deep. Where is the wise, where is the Scribe?
Where is the Inquirer of this Age? Has not God made Foolish the wisdom of this
world, which does measure and judge of the truths and things of God by
unscriptural Rules? How do such Arguers say then, we are wise, and the Law of
Jehovah is with us? Lo, certainly, in vain works the false pen of the
Scribes: There will be a time, when such wise men will be ashamed, affrighted
and taken: Behold they have rejected the word of Jehovah, Wisdom-what to them?
They steal away the word from Aelohim's People; which word would be Wheat,
wholesome nourishing Bread, and Food to them, and bring unscriptural empty Chaff
in the room; but these are not ready Scribes in the Law, as Ezra was. Even a
Paul himself is no further to be hearkened unto and followed, than he speaks
according to the word, and is a Follower of Christ. Mat. 15. 9. 13. Mic. 6. 16.
Acts 16. 19, 20. 21. and 17, 7. and 18. 13. Tit. 1. 14. 1. Pet. 2. 13. Romans 16.
17. Ps. 119. 21, 118. Amos 2. 4. Numb. 15. 22-26. 2. Chron. 33. 9. Ps. 95. 10.
and 119. 110. Jerem. 10. 15. and 51. 18. Exodus 20. 40. Non faciestibi omnem
formam. (...) so Coco^ius does render it in his Hebrew Lexicon and Commentary.
Neither does Error arise from hence, that, men do not know or conform to
National establishments in the matters of Doctrine, and of worship, in their
humanely-invented and imposed confessions of Faith and stinted Liturgies. it
has been one of the main Occasions of most of the persecutions that have been
carried on by Adversaries against the Church and People of God in all Ages, the
inventing, Instituting, and imposing, of unscriptural modes and forms of
Worship exclusive of all other which are Regular, according to the word, and
then framing, it into a Law with inflicted penalties upon all Non-Conformists:
And what strong Rationalists do some take themselves to be in pleading and
arguing for this, and producing many humane Authorities in Church-Histories for
this? and there want not flatterers at Court, who persuade Governors, that,
the main of their Authority and power does consist in determining of such
matters of Indifferency (as they miscall them) That the appointing of times and
seasons and days c See, 5, and 6. Edw. 6. chapter 3.
for public worship, is left wholly in the Hand and power of the Magistrate:
and that, the way of maintaining peace and preserving Religion in the Land is
to enforce uniformity in the service and worship of God, according to such
National Statutes, by seeing mulcts to be inflicted on all Recusants and
dissenters: Whereas Christ tells us, that, it is vain worship, such
humane-traditionary-Worship, teaching Doctrines the commandments of men: And
that, every such Plantation in the matters of Corrupt both Doctrine and
worship, which is not of his Fathers Planting, shall be rooted up: The LORD
reproves the People, when they keep Idolatrous superstitious Statutes. Too much
advantage has been given by the Non-Conformists in their writings and
conferences against the Formalists and ceremonialists, in that, they have not
in downright express Terms, condemned all humanely-invented-instituted-imposed
forms and ceremonies in the matters of Worship, as sinful and unlawful,
especially when they enjoin them as exclusive of other worship where these are
not conformed unto, and when they impose them as necessary terms of Church
Communion: whereas they are expressly in the very letter and meaning of the
second Commandment forbidden: For, we are not to make unto our selves all Form,
any Form, every such Form, which men of their own head, and out of the device
of their own brain do thus make unto themselves and so to others also, is under
a plain prohibition by this Holy righteous, just and good law of the LORD. How
many have been brought into Courts, and Condemned, sentenced and fined and
Imprisoned, as Routers, Rioters, ill-behaviour'd, Schismatical, Seditious,
Turbulent, ones, for conforming to Christ's Laws, and for not conforming to the
customs and Laws of the Land, but doing contrary to man's decrees, because,
they Worship God according to his institutions, but not according to men's
Ordinances! Whereas we are expressly charged not to give our selves to such
commandments of men, as turn away the truth from us, or would turn us away from
the Truth: And yet they urge a mis-translated Scripture, as if we must submit
to every Ordinance of man: Whereas it is, to every humane Creature. There is an
Honor due to all men as men, to some more than to others; to the King as
superior, as having Authority over and above others, and to others in their
Inferior places. It is Mat. 13. 21. John. 17. 8, 1^.
because or for the word, that, Persecution arises: For the Receiving of this
word, and a conforming unto it by the Disciples of Christ, that, they are hated
of the World. If National establishments were the Rule and measure of Truth;
and error were to be judged of by a contrariety to that, Then the same thing
would be, one while Truth, and another while Error, when National
establishments do upon turns of times and changes of Laws make contradictory
Decrees. So it was in the Reigns of the Kings of Judah: One sets up Idolatry,
another pulls it down: One commands Right Worship according to Institution:
Another brings in corrupt mixtures: Such interchangeable vicissitudes there
were in the days of Abaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, and Josiah. They are to be
avoided, who ever they be, that do cause divisions and offenses contrary to
received-Scripture-doctrine. Then do men err when they go astray from Jehovah's
Commandments, from his precepts, from his statutes: They are Humane lies, that
cause men to err, and to despise the Law of Aelohim. Error proceeds from not
knowing and not observing all his Commandments: then do a People err in their
Hearts, when they have not known his ways. Unscriptural Establishments in the
matters of worship are the work of Errors. Further yet, John. 3. 10. Colos. 2.
3, 4, 8, 1. Tim. 6. 20, 21. Acts, 17. 16, 17, 18, etc. and 22. 3, 4, etc. and
5. 34. 1. Cor. 2. 2. Phil. 3. 5.. ^o.
neither do men err therefore because they do not know man-invented-Arts and
sciences, of Philosophical knowledges, and of University-humane-learning.
Nicodemus was a master of Arts, and a Doctor of Sciences, and yet he greatly
erred in the necessary Doctrine of Regeneration. Paul greatly erred from the
great Truths of the Christian Religion whilst he sat at the feet of Gamaliel, a
Pharisee, a Doctor of the Law, held in esteem by all the People, one of the
Chief in the privy Council of the Jews. This Grave tutor of Paul perfectly
instructed his attentive, diligent, Pupil in that kind of Pharisaical Learning
and way of Worship, and he was a sharpwitted Disciple: But when the LORD Christ
Revealed himself to and in Paul; now he saw how much he had erred from saving
Truth, and Paul a Convert differed much in his Apprehensions from Paul a
Pharisee: All other knowledge now in comparison with right Scripture-knowledge,
with the eminent Excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ and of him
Crucified, and of the way of Justification and of Salvation by Faith in him,
and in his Blood; and in his Righteousness, he Judges as nothing, as Dung, as
Loss, as Dogs meat: And he saw the gross mistakes of the Learned-University-men
at Athens, endeavoring to convince them of their Infidel-Errours,
Antichristian mistakes, and Philosophical-falsehoods. Now he commends to others
those full Treasuries (of useful Arts and Sciences) of all wisdom and
knowledge, that were in Christ and in his word, and warns them of the Danger of
that vain affectation of human wisdom, which would seduce and carry them away
for a prey; though the Philosophic World were very fond of this, and cried it
up much; and had given it a great Name of Honor, yet it was that which was but
a Falsly-called-Science; and which would turn them away from the Faith. Nor yet
do men therefore greatly Err because they know not the Innate or acquired
Powers of men's own Rational Intellect and will. How many Millions have been
seduced by the Aristotelian way of self ratiocination, which not only misled
some in his time, but has also misguided such multitudes of men of Choice Wits
and of pregnant parts for so many Ages since. 1. Cor. 2. 14, 15, 16. Exodus 20.
4. Hos. 13. 2. 2. Cor. 10. 4, 5. Col. 2. 20. 23. Prove. 19. 27.
Let Paul's Judgment according to the word be hearkened to in this case, the
Animal-man, the Souly-man, the Victuoso-man, that has no other Light than what
is now Corruptedly natural, no higher Reason than what is merely humane, no
better wisdom than what is attained in Schools of Philosophy: This man
Comprehends not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto
him, and he cannot understand them, because they are Spiritually judged. The
true Critical-distinguishing-differencing-discerning of these is from a
Spiritual principle, in a Regenerate new Heart; in one that has the mind of
Christ in his word. Self idolizing has brought in Idolatrous Worship; when men
think themselves to be wiser than God; and they will be making to themselves
and for others, new and after-kinds and Forms of worship, and of service
according to their own understanding, shaped with their Art, and dressed with
their skill: Wrong conceiving, that, Aelohim was and would be altogether like
themselves. They confide in their own forming, though it be but a teacher of
lying, a brutish folly, an instruction of vanities. It is the Powerfulness of
God to throw down this worldly wisdom and humane eloquence, and
Reputationed-reasonings and high imaginations, and will-worshippings, that do
so lift themselves up against the Knowledge of God; and to lead Captive every
thought to the Obedience of Christ. We should cease from hearkening to such
Institutions of Learning as would cause us to err from the true words of
Scripture-knowledge. Error also does not arise from hence, that men do not
know Eccles. throughout. Hos. 4. 12. Isai. 28. 7. 1. Tim. 6. 10. Jude 11.
Jerem. 44. 15. 16, 17, 18, 19, etc.
Natural experiments, and fleshly sensations. The Epicurean Religion is a
doctrine of falsehoods, and of Errors. Solomon in his Book called Ecclesiastes
does treat of this Subject Matter at large about natural History, and
experimental Philosophy; openly acknowledging to the Church his Error and
folly, his sin and madness, in not improving of that wisdom (which Aelohim gave
him in answer to his choice and request;) in a word-way, but giving himself
over to the study of Philosophy, to try, whether, he could find out some
exacter knowledge in this kind of Learning, and whether it were not a necessary
adapted means, for the attaining of the chiefest God, as the great end of
Rational Creatures; and therefore toward the close he advises his Son to take
heed of Philosophic Sophies, no end of making many Books of such humane
Learning, and much studious reading of them would but weary him, and waste his
time; and therefore it would be true wisdom in him to keep close to
word-revelations, and to seek saving enlightening there; for, this was all Adam,
whilst Adam retained his integrity, till he sought many humanely invented Arts
and Sciences, besides that which Aelohim had put into Created Nature, and
Revealed word: The sum and the argument, the Subject and the matter, the drift
and the Design, the Scope and the End; of this Book, is to set out the vanity
and unsuccesfulness of Philosophic Learning and opinions about the chiefest
good of man, discovering and confuting their mistakes. by an induction of
particulars in the way of their own Logical Method: Detecting the
fallaciousness of their arguing, and the carnality of their principles, and the
corruptness of their Tenets, showing, that man's happiness is found in the
saving knowledge, sound Faith, holy Fear, and perfecting Obedience, of, and to,
Jehovah Aelohim and his will revealed in his word, and not in the
mishapen-monstrous-fancyed felicities of Ethnic Philosophers: nor in a
skilfulness in their Arts and Sciences, whether more speculative, metaphysical
ones, to gratify the unmortified voluptuousness of a wanton intellect: or more
practical ones, suited to an animal appetite, a sensitive itch, and a sensual
life, immersed in fleshly disquisitions, and in carnal delight. Solomon had
been long Conversant in Paganish knowledges, and does now manifest the vainness
of its vanity, introducing the several Sects, pleading and disputing for their
way and party: And then answering their Arguments, and bewraying the Captious
deceitfulness of them. So that it would much improve useful learning, to point
out exactly and particularly through this Book, when it is that an Ethnic
Philosopher does Logically Syllogize, and Rhetorically persuade: (For what is
the Logicians Major, is the Rhetoricians Proposition, what is the Philosophers
Minor is the Orators Assumption, and what is the Sophisters Conclusion is the
Perswaders Complexion or Inference:) and when it is that, a Theological
Christian Preacher does Spiritually confute and convincingly dissuade, self
evidencingly prove, and demonstratively argue. I therefore propound this
Disquisition to the Studious and ingenious, as a further augment of profitable
Learning. When men do ask Counsel of unscriptural Philosophy, it is a Spirit of
Whoredom that causes them to err. Sensuality brings forth error:
Inordinate love after creature-knowledges and enjoyments, seduceth them from
the faith, Wizardly-Philosophy was Balaams Error, and too many are still
wandering in that by-way of his: That is the best Religion with the most that
is accommodated to their peace and plenty, which will cloth their backs and
fill their bellies, which will take them off from self-denial and from
cross-bearing; and although diverse are not so drencht in sottishness and
sensualities, but are sober Scholars and chaste Students, yet the unscriptural
way they take in their researches into natural Histories and experimental
Philosophy, will never so attain its useful end for the true advance of
profitable Learning, till more studied in the Book of Scriptures, and suiting
all experiments unto this word-knowledge. Luke 9. 4, 5. 55, 1. John. 4. 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6. Acts 26. 9. Isai. 59. last (...).
Neither yet do men therefore Err, because they know not the unscriptural
Impulses of speculative Enthusiasts. Here the Platonists did err by conceiving
of strange Ideas of things, and then nursing up their monstrous bratts. It is
one choice part of experimental Christianity, and which needs much of spiritual
discerning, to know what manner of Spirit we are of. Even a James and a John,
two of Christ's eminent Disciples, were rebuked by Christ for that, they did not
discriminate wisely in this matter. Their revengeful Spirit at that time would
have commanded fire from Heaven to consume the unkind Samaritans: they must
have it come down at their word, and for this they pretend and plead the
example and Spirit of Elias, as if their case and Spirit had been of the same
kind, when it was hellish Fire of their own kindling, and of the Devils blowing
up, which they should rather have endeavored to quench and to put out. We must
not believe every Spirit, but ought to try the Spirits whether they are of God:
The Spirit of others, and our own Spirit, that, we may know the Spirit of truth
according to Christ and his word, and may difference it from the Spirit of
Error, which is against Christ and his word. There was a time when
persecuting- Saul verily thought with himself that he ought to do many contrary
things to the Name of Jesus of Nazareth, which when he was preaching Paul, he
discerned were his great Error and his gross Sin; and he openly condemns
himself for, and does write his confession and retractation. The Spirit who is
the truth, and the word which is the truth, do go together. Mar. 11. 23. Luke
11. 20. 1. Corin. 9. 10. Ti^ 1. i, 2. Romans 3. 4. and 14. 1. 1. Tim. 2. 8. Jam.
1. 6, 7. 1. Pet. 5. 12. Colos. 2. 4. (...)
Once more, men do not therefore er^ because they know not the doubtful
Questionings of unsettled Sceptick's and of Cosmical Suspecters. The Doctrine
of Probabilities: (So the word signifies in that place to the Colossians cited
in the margin:) is a misleading Doctrine: It would beguil men by doubtful
disputations and by deceitful conclusions with such cunning persuasions as do
carry a fair show; such as Logicians and Rhetoricians, Philosophers and
Orators, do usually bring, under the shadowie color of probable Reasons and
likely Arguments, to make nothing of all things and any thing of every thing,
by their sophistical Quidlibets, and Fallacious Quodlibets: But Sound, serious,
well discerning, right Judging beleivers should not suffer themselves thus to
be imposed upon and deluded. A through, wholesome Scripture-knowledge is one
approved remedy against Heart-doubtings, either to prevent them or to cure
them: This would bring in sound Truth upon and leave them with a renewed Heart;
with a no-doubt there of them. God cannot lie at any time, though men do so too
often. He is true: Whilst men are so overcome of doubtings and waverings, (not
in the way, which is sometimes the case of sound Beleivers, but about the way)
how can they go on with such conviction and comfort, with such sweetness and
satisfaction? Let not the Reader misjudge this a Diversion and that too long a
one also: For, besides that, it contains a direct answer to the Objection,
which did call for it, so does it fully promote the grand design of this
Treatise. All unscriptural, Antiscriptural ways, methods, arguings, and
endeavourings to turn any from the Error of their way to the Truth, is no
adapted means for the attaining of this end. And therefore in the Demonstrating
proofs that I have brought for the confirming and establishing of the Seventh
day, the last day of the Week, to be still the weekly Sabbath, they are such as
are carried through the whole Scripture and have their Foundation in pure
primitive created Nature: I do not send and refer them to humane Authorities,
and Histories, and Traditions, as this Objector does. The Scripture-way is the
only convincing converting way: Other Mediums by self-excogitated and
man-invented Artifices are like to leave Erring men but the more profound
Atheists, the more learned Infidels, and the more subtle Heretics. Though
arguments, as to men, may be drawn from their own Concessions, assertions,
histories, and other Authorities of men's sayings, writings, and printings,
which was somewhat of the way that Paul sometimes took with Ethnicks and
Philosophers, whereby to stop their Mouths, and to convince them from thence;
As Christ also will one day by the same Medium condemn many from their own
acknowledged principles not improved, yet this will not convincingly convert a
plain sound believer having Spiritual discerning in the truths and things of
the Spirit of God, and being well acquainted with the Scriptures, is far better
secured against dangerous damnable Errors than the most learned of vain
affecters of humane wisdom. The only summary of all sound truth, for the
confuting and condemning of all Error, is to be searched after in the
Scriptures of truth, where the Restoration, Proficiency and advancement, of
all useful learning is. When can a serious inquiring Spirit come to any firm
settlement and sound satisfaction, if he were to refer all to the
extrascriptural Judgment and Histories, of Churches? Heresies and Schisms,
profanenesses and disorders, quickly crept in, into particular Churches that
were of Apostolical plantation: As Paul's Epistles to them do evidently declare.
And since that, one particular Church does sometimes contradict another
particular Church in their confessions of Faith; and the contention is so hot
and so high, as that, they withdraw from one another, and will not have mutual
Communion with each other. As for the universal Church how shall a particular
beleiver be well groundedly ascertained, what is the concurrent Judgment of
the Universal Church? How fruitless and vain have their attempts hitherto been
who have endeavored by conference, and Writing, and Cost, and Labor and
Pains, and Travel, to be Church-Reconciliators, Church-peace-makers? They dyed
away, and never lived to see their design accomplished. Still there are
differences and divisions kept up amongst the Churches, one great cause whereof
has been, that, the Attempters and promoters of Church-union and peace have
been setting up some confession of Faith, and Articles of Religion, of humane
Composure, which they would have all to join in and subscribe to: Which course
will never be able to accomplish that design. The whole Scripture of Truth is
the one and the only rule of this. Suppose yet further, that, I knew, that, the
Concurrent Judgment of all the Churches of Christ all the inhabited Earth over
were of one mind and of one way in some things, yet neither could this alone,
or mainly; secure me from fears of Erring. For, Levit. 4. 13. 2. Chron. 30. 5.
and. 35. 18. Ne^em. 8. 17.
the whole Church has erred, and may actually err. Under the Old Testament the
LORD himself appointed a special Sacrifice for Atonement and reconciliation in
this particular Case, when the whole Congregation or Church of Israel did err
through ignorance in omitting some commanded duty, or in Committing some
forbidden Sin: And that, they actually did thus ignorantly err, for some
hundreds of years together, we have it recorded in the word. John. 6. 15, Luke
24. 21. Acts 1. 6. Acts 10. and 11, ch^. compared with. Mat. 28. 19. and Mar.
16. 15.
Thus under the New Testament in Christ's time, the Church of the Jews which at
that season, was the only Church of God, generally, those of them that were in
Judea, and the scattered of the tribes in other parts did greatly Err about
Christ's Reign on Earth, whom they concluded would be as a Temporal Prince to
come with outward pomp and power, for the raising of Israel to high promotion
in the world, and to restore again the Kingdom to Israel. And this Corrupt
leaven still sowred and swelled their Spirits, even after that some of them
became Disciples of Christ, who still were stiff to this wrong Tenet: and the
good Apostles themselves did long mistake about preaching the Gospel to the
Gentiles, as if this had scarce been their duty though it were expressly put
into their Commission from the mouth of Christ: Till Peter was righter informed
by a Vision from Heaven.

Galat. (...). 7, 8, 9. 1. Kin. 13. 7-26.
The written word of Christ has an Authority above and beyond the Authority and
Testimony of the most eminent Apostles or Angels of Heaven. If a Paul had
brought his own word contrary to Christ's word, what were Paul's saying? It must
be rejected, and in that the hearers were to carry themselves toward Paul as
if he had been an excommunicate. If a Prophet bring a word contradictory to the
word of the LORD, he should not be hearkened unto. If an Angel from Heaven
speak otherwise than the God of Angels and would teach disobedience against the
word of Jehovah, Fellowship should not be kept up with him. 2. These. 2. 1.-12.
1. Tim. 4. 1, 2, 3. Mat. 24. 11. Anomy 2. Pet. 3. 17.
It is one erroneous part of Antichristianism, to set up the Testimony of men,
or the Authority of the Church, in the seat of Christ and of his written word.
The The Antichrist is the Anomous one, the Lawless one, the Antinomian: And
Anomy, or Lawlesness or Antinomianism is the great comprehensive sin of the
Latter days: And they are Lawless ones that are the erring seducing ones. Men
as to their Church state, have their foundation and bottom, their existence and
life under a God in Christ from the written word of Christ, whereas these
Scriptures of Truth have not their groundwork and being from any mere man or
men, Church or Churches. Mat. 7. 24.-27. Ephesians. 2. 20. 1. Corin. 3. 11.
A Church is made up of Believers, as the prefaces of the Epistles to the
Churches do show; and Believers must have a word to sound and to live upon. All
true doctrines are to be fetched hence and to be grounded and proved here. The
Conventions of Pagans, and the Synagogues of Sutan are not owned as Churches of
Christ; because, they are not according to Christ and the word of Christ. Men,
though passing into never-so-noted-a-Church-way, yet may actually be in process
of time, so Obstinate in Heresies, so Idolatrous in Worship, and so scandalous
in profaneness, as to cease to be a true-Scripture-Church, and must be
separated from. The Christian Church at Rome in Paul's time has another manner
of Character given of it in his Epistle to them, than the Satanical Synagogue
at Rome has by John in the Revelation, who saw in a Vision the foul Apostasy
thereof. Rev. 18. 4. Act. 19. 9. 2. Chron. 11. 14, 16. 2 Cor. 6. 14-17.
Separation in such Cases is holy and a duty. The holy Scriptures of Truth do
not give a Sovereign Authority to the Testimony of men; they did not send us to
Joh. 3. 11. 32, 33, 34, 35. and 5. 34, 39, 41, 45, 46, 47.
humane Witness, to Church History, to unwritten Tradition, to fetch
Credibility to it. It is Isai. 8. 20. John 12. 48.
the Glorious excellency of this Word of Christ to be the one and the only rule
of Judging in all Cases, both here now, and at the Last Judgment day: Which no
Testimony of men is honored withal. 2. Tim. 3. 16. 2. Pet. 1. latter end.
The whole Scripture is God-inspired, whose Testimony is the greatest and the
most Credible, so are not the after-humane-Testimonies, Traditions, Histories,
and Authorities. The Books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,
as commonly now, called are more Ancient than all other written printed books:
The true pure Word of God is of greatest Authority; men's Writings are a
Postscript. The Grace of sound and of Saving Faith must have Almighty Power,
Infallible truthfulness, unchangeable faithfulness, and infinite Wisdom, to
bottom and to build firmly upon. A Believers assent and consent to the
Infallible Authority of the written word, has been, is, and may be, brought
forth without mens-Testimony, History, Tradition, and Authority. Many have been
made to believe this before they came to any such Human helps, and who neither
knew, read, or considered, such Church Histories and Traditions? which
therefore could not be the cause immediate, Adequate, and Efficient thereof.
These. 2. 13.
Where the word it self does work effectually and savingly in a believing
heart, there it is embraceingly recieved; not the word of man, but as it is in
truth the word of God. Saving Faith cannot bottom upon men's Testimonies, which
humane Writers will still be needing further Arguments and Testimonies to
confirm it. The Testimony of man can never of it self persuade and enable
savingly to credit the infallible Authority of the written word, Romans 10. 17.
Gal. 3. 2. Acts. 4. 4. and 8. 26, etc. and 17. 11, 12. 1. Corin. 2. 4. 5. 1.
These. 1. 5, 6.
till the Holy Spirit do infuse sound saving Faith, and call and draw it forth
into Act: Though the other pretended cause of Humane Testimonies and
Authorities be put into act, yet this effect of sound believing does not
follow. Many remain Infidels under the highest esteem and strongest persuasions
of Church-Histories, and of men's Testimonies: and some tempted Saints yet
cannot be cured of their unbelieving Fears, and of their distrustful doubts by
any humane Tradition, History, or Authority, till the Spirit and word of Christ
from the Father do come with Demonstration and with Power. Saving Faith is
Supernatural, which men's Testimony from Extrascriptural Arguments is not, they
do each differ in their whole kind, and one cannot be in another. 1. Cor. 1.
17-28.
The best read Historians, and other wise learned men of the World, are not the
soonest brought to assent and consent to the Authority of the word by the force
of any or of all humane Arguments. If this Faith which is greater in its self
and in its Spiritual effects could be inwrought by men's Testimony, then other
particular objects of Faith or Truths or things to be believed, which are less.
(Such as are the several Doctrines about Spiritual, Eternals, Invisibles;) but
not these, and therefore neither that also. Even as to matters of Fact, past,
besides knowing of them by Inspiration, Voice, or Visions, and by natural
causes, arguing from them to the effects, by humane Report, which is called
History or Tradition, they may be known some other ways, when they are needful
to be known. Matters of Fact past have been and still may be known by lots,
which where the Case and Cause do call for it, is a way of natural appeal to
the allknowing God. Thus was Josh. 7. 13.-26.
Achans matter of past fact known: and thus also was 1. Sam. 14. 38-42.
Jonathans past Fact discovered: And thus also in the Numb. 5. 11-31.
trial of Jealousy, past Facts of works of darkness in Adulterous Acts, were
brought to light by an Oath of Execration taken by the suspected party, and a
solemn address thereupon made to the Heartsearching, all-knowing, Aelohim: And
this also I would propound to the Ingenious and Studious for the advance and
Augment of this best of Sciences, Scripture-knowledges, whether by lots and
Oaths of Execration, natural Appeals, solemn-Addresses, and by miracles other
ways, the truthfulness of Scripture-revelation would not yet under the present
dispensation of Grace (For, I revive not any of the Old Testament Figures,
Types, and shadows, about any of these then used) be thus still confirmed, were
a Spirit of Faith mingled with a word of Faith, put into the prayer of Faith?
As for Humane report, the experience that we have had of our own day and time
does inform us, how partial men are in these Histories, where private interest
and particular partyship do incline them to write over favorably of themselves
and of their own Facts, and how hatred of, and prejudice against others, who
are of contrary Principles and practices, do put them upon hard misconstruings,
and wrong misreportings of the Actions of their Adversaries, So that, it is a
rare Ingenuity in an Historian to give a true Narrative of the matter of Fact
in the several Circumstances of it under the opposition of an Enemy: Especially
if some Ages have passed away since the matter of Fact, there is the less
certainty and credibility: And more especially yet, if there have been such
ages coming between, which were Ages of thick darkness, of prevailing
Ignorance, and of gross imposture, and when in such cases as wherein Antichrist
has imposed much upon the Churches by his Humane Additions, Supplements and
Traditions, thereby to obscure, or to corrupt, or to thrust out, to take from,
or to add to, what is Christ's mind in his Word; which is the present case. And

in Roger Hoveden, by what counterfeit Artifices, and false Pretenses, and
forged Visions, feigned Voices, and lying Wonders, he introduced the
observation of the first Day of the Week here into England, no longer ago than
in the Reign of King John, may unless he very much dote on such humane fallible
Testimonies, see cause enough to give little credit to such Church-Histories,
as would so report the matter of Fact, as thereby to determine the matter of
right, which those who go this way generally do, whilst they place the first
day in the Week, in the room of the seventh day, as the weekly Sabbath Day,
under the New Testament ministration. So that I am the less fond, or rather not
at all fond, of Humane Histories in these matters relating to sin or duty from
cited Church Authorities in matters of Fact, having my esteem heightened from
Scripture Records, and word-commands: chiefly in such cases, where the whole
Scripture does contain such Reasons of the LORD's own assigning, founded in the
very Nature of Created Existences; such names and things, such Precepts and
Prohibitions, such Promises and Threatenings, such suitable Examples, and such
like as these, which do uniformly throughout speak a quite contrary thing, and
go a quite different way from those sayings, which Church-Registers do wrong
tell me, and from that By-path, into which Humane Histories would mislead me;
as they would in this case; when they would take me off from the due
observation of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, to drag me along to keep the
first day, as a separated day for holy Worship. I am bound to believe Scripture
History, as a true report from the infallible veracity of a truthful Aelohim,

this Faith to my Salvation: But I am not under such an obligation, neither is
it so necessary for me to believe Humane History, so many hundreds of years
ago, especially such circumstances, as have been mentioned before, in such
matters of fact as are but pretended to be transacted in Scripture times,
chiefly to whom they are so argued against the whole of other Scripture. How
can this objector prove to me, that those Ecclesiastical Histories, whose
certainty and credibility of reporting this he so much cries up, were directed
and dictated thereunto by the Spirit of Truth in this matter? And if not, how
can my Faith be swayed by their Authorities? 1 Chronicles 29. 29. 2 Chronicles. 9. 29.
and 12. 15. and 13. 22. and 20. 34. and 26. 22. and 22. 32. and 33. 18, 19.
Luke 1. 2. 1 John 1. 1, 2, 3. John 21. 24, 25.
Jehovah Aelohim himself appointed Scripture Histories to be written by the
Prophets and Priests; these Historiographers were ocular Witnesses in much of
that, which they wrote and registered, and in this, as also in the rest, they
were God inspired: So were those Evangelists and Apostles also, who wrote the
New Testament History. Acts 6. 14. 1 Cor. 15. 3. John 17. 8, 14. Luke 1. 2.
Acts 16. 4. 1 Cor. 11. 23. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Ezekiel. 20. 18, 21. Acts 7. 51, 52.

As for Tradition we receive what is scriptural; Believers are delivered from
Patro-traditional conversation, such as is unscriptural, we receive the
commandments which Christ has delivered, but we reject Humane Traditions,
which are not according to Christ and his Word. If the case were so, that all
the Men, and Speakers, and Writers, and Printers, and Books, and what other
humane Authorities did tell me what I know evidently is expressly otherwise in
Christ, and in the Word of Christ, it were of no validity with me. Isal 8. 20.
John 5. 39. Josh. 1. 7, 8. Matt. 28. 20. and 15. 3, 6. Mar. 7. 9. 13.
The Prophets, and the LORD Jesus Christ, the sender of his Prophets, did refer
the Jews not to the Traditions of Rabbines (especially when they were such
Traditions as would have UNLORDED him and his Word, of his, and of its due
Authority) but to the Law, to the Scriptures. 2 Thessalonians 2. 13. 14, 15. and 3. 6.
1 Cor. 11. 2, etc. and 14. 40.
Scripture Traditions, which are allowed of in the Word of Christ, we approve
of, about sound Doctrine, and Faith of the Truth, and holy conversation, and
about observing of a naturally comely decent order in Church Assemblies: But
John 5. 43. and 7. 18. and 8. 44.
we reject what is of men's own, and in their own name. It is an Observand in
Scripture, that the Scriptures do refer to Scriptures: often may we meet with
such expressions, it is written, and as it is written, and for it is written,
and according to that which is written. This is under the LORD, the Judging
Rule, and the Lawful Determiner in all cases. By this were Truths confirmed;
and by this were errors confuted. 1 Cor. 16. 2^. Col. 4. 18. 2 These. 3. 17.
compared (...) with 2 Thessalonians. 211, 2.
Even whilst the Apostles were alive, there were false supposititious writings
thrust upon some; as if they had been the Apostles own true Writing: and
therefore the Apostles subscribed their Epistles with their own hands: they
used some peculiar subscription; such a subsigning as was well known to the
Churches. How much more was the World like to be imposed upon, when they were
dead and gone, by the writings of men, who would be fathering of their own
unscriptural brats of false tenets upon the Apostles, there being many
Antichrists gone forth even in 1 John 2. 18.
John's time? Paul, whilst living, to confute the falsehood, yet was strongly
charged with saying and asserting of that, which he utterly denies, though
others would Romans 3. 9.
affirm it to be so: he was evil-spoken of, and wrongfully accused, as if he
had expressly taught a damnable Doctrine, which he wholly disowneth. And if they
were so bold in his days, how can we be so over confident of a matter of fact,
reported by a mere humane traditionary Knowledge above sixteen hundred years
ago, without any God-inspired Scripture Revelation, or Natural Demonstration?
How can any man to his own, or others satisfaction, affirm that by Humane
History, he certainly knows that, all the Christian Churches have constantly
set apart, and observed the first day for holy Worship, when he cannot
certainly know, that he has read all humane Histories that have recorded that
particular matter of fact? Or that no humane History has recorded a quite
different, both Principle, Judgment and Practice in some particular Church or
Churches, and when the matter of fact, for any evidence he has to the
contrary, may have been quite otherwise, in some Church or Churches, which yet
is not recorded in any humane History? This Objector does not confirm his
reasoning thus, only with respect to the first Day, but does carry it much
further on, by his asserting, that the first Institution of Church Officers,
and Orders, as well as that of the LORD's Day, (by which he means the first
Day) was not by Scripture: The proof, says he, is undeniable, because the Old
Testament did not contain the Institution, e. g. of particular Churches,
Sacraments, Presbyters, Deacons, Diaconesses, and the LORD's Day, etc. And the
New Testament was none of it written till An. 40. at soonest; and it was not
all written till An. 99. Now it is certain, that the Church was not all these
years without the Orders now in question, nor without a day to meet on for
public Worship; even as Baptism and the LORD's Supper were Instituted by
Christ himself, long before the writing of any part of the New Testament, and
the Church was in long possession of them, upon the bare word and Declaration
of the Apostles. So he writes.

That the Church was not all these years without a day to meet on for public
Worship, we readily subscribe, for they knew the Seventh day Sabbath was the
weekly day to meet on for that end; of which the Churches had had long
possession, for near four thousand years; and of which they had still the
Tenure; and for the continuance of which title and practice they had the whole
Written Word of God: whereunto the practice of Christ, and of his Apostles did
fully agree: But as for his other exemplified instances, we desire both him and
the Reader, a little to consider: If these were received and practiced by the
Church, upon the bare verbal Declaration of the Apostles, and not by Scripture,
what then meant the Types of these? Did these signify nothing? Was there
nothing of these understood by Moses, Aaron, the Priests and Levites? Did not
Moses Exodus 14. 15-22. Numb. 10. 24, 35, 36. 1 Cor. 10. 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
by the Word and Prayer, sanctify the Baptismal Types of the Red Sea and the
Cloud? and the Supper-Types of the Paschal Lamb, the Heavenly Manna, and
springing Rock? Though there was a veil upon these and such other Figures and
Shadows, in the reading of the Old Testament, yet Believers had some knowledge
of their meaning, and some insight into their Mystery: and there were Teachers
by Office, who were to interpret the signifyingness of these things, and to
open the spiritual part of the Pattern. Had not these things a Spiritual
Relation unto Christ, and to an after administration of Grace? Was not this the
end, the drift, the design, the purport, the scope, of these Institutions to
refer unto Christ? They were a Pedagogue, a Leader of those Children to the
Christian School for their Institution and Discipline, Psalm. ^0. 6, 7, 8. Psalm.
50. 8.. 14. Isai 9. 6 and 7. 14, 15, 16. Mic. 5. 2.
There are diverse Scriptures in the Old Testament, which did discover unto
discerning Believers of that Dispensation, that those Types, Figures and
Shadows, were to be done away under an after administration of Grace, to
receive their perfection and accomplishment in the Messiah, who was to be born
of a Virgin, and in his days. Several Prophesies also under that former
Ministration, do speak punctually to this matter; though we who have the New
Testament-fulfilling of them, and Commentary upon them, have a more clear
unveiled manifestation of them. The Christian Religion for sum, and for
substance, being one and the same under both dispensations, particularly as to
the institutions mentioned: For there is Ephesians. 4. 5. 1 Cor. 10 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
11. Genesis 17. compared with Col. 2. 11.
one Baptism; in this sense, the Baptismal Types of old, and the Baptismal 1
Pet. 3. 21. (...).
Antitypes now, are thus one and the same, excepting the different manner of
Administration. So that, suppose Baptism was instituted by Christ himself,
before the writing of any part of the New Testament, yet was not this upon the
bare verbal Declaration of the Apostles; especially not as to that part of the
Church, which was in Christ's time: For John's Baptizing of others,
particularly of Christ, and Christ's Baptizing by his Apostles, and Christ's
Doctrine which he several times taught about Baptism, and John's foretelling of
this. (As John himself also was Prophesied of, of old, particularly by Isai 40.
3. ^^8. Mal. 3. 1, 2.
Isaiah, and by Malachi) By these, and such like passages, was this known to
such, at least knowable by them: and somewhat of this had a confirmation and
testimony from Heaven. Genesis 4. 3, 4, 1^, 16, 26. Genesis 9 26, 27. Genesis 14. 18,
19, 20. Genesis 20. 7.
As for particular Churches, and the calling and gathering of them, there were
such under the Old Testament times: In Adam's days, in Epoch's days, in Noab's
days. Though at the first, they called upon the Name of Jehovah, in a way of
family Worship; yet afterward in greater Church Assemblies: and a difference
was put between the true and pure Worshipers, and those that were corrupt. So
it was before the Flood, and thus also it was after the Flood. Melchisedec was
a Priest in the Church of Aelohim: Abraham had a Church in his Family, and was
King, Priest and Prophet there. So was Isaac, and Jacob. Job and Eliphaz were
of congregated Societies, and had their Church-meetings, in their days, though
living in other Regions, in Countries distant from Abraham. Exodus 19. 20, 24,
25. chapters, and onward, Acts 7. 38.
In Moses's time, the Israelites were put into a Church way, and had such
Institutions, and Laws, and Ordinances for Church Assemblies and Societies, as
were afterward observed, not only by the Israelites as a national Church, but
by particular Churches of the Israelites; when after Moses's death they were
settled in the promised Land, in the days of Joshua, Judges and the Kings: For
the Priests and Levites were not only for all the Tribes jointly, but also for
several Tribes distinctly: and further, for the several Cities and Towns, and
other populous places, in every particular Tribe, where they had distinct
Assembles; enjoying all Ordinances, Institutions, Privileges (excepting what
was specially limited to some particular place of Jehovah's choosing and
appointing for some solemn Sacrifices and Festivals:) and they exercised
Church Discipline in those particular Churches. Numb. 23. 7. Josh. 13. 22.
Numb. 22. 7.
Neither was Syria, and Mesopotamia in Moses days without their congregated
Societies, Church convention, and worshipping Assemblies: Balaam having a gift
of Prophecy, was an hireling that served Congregations. Psalm. 15. Psalm. 24.
Psalm. 26. Psalm. 50.
There are particular Congregations, both described and prophesied of, in what
was written before of old? A wise observer, and a spiritual discerner, and a
diligent comparer, may easily find and plainly see, how Christ's Institutions
and Directions for management of Church Affairs, and for the Exercise of the
Duties Mat. 18. 19 ^20.
of Church fellowship and Discipline have evident reference to his Institutions
under the old Dispensation: though clearer and more spiritual, and glorious,
and heavenly now: and it will be found in experience, as it is evident in
Scripture, that several Church proceedings will not be either so well
understood, or so regularly practiced, but by a collating of Old with New
Testament directions about those matters, particularly for Church Discipline:
as in the case of Leprosy especially. As for Church Officers, Overseers,
Presbyters or Elders, teaching and ruling Ones, Pastors and Teachers, Diacons
or Ministers, under the Old Testament it were no very difficult task to write a
large Treatise upon that particular subject, especially by one that is
acquainted with the Original Hebrew, and the several words and phrases under
that dispensation, that do speak to this case. The Churches of Aelohim had in
all ages such as were gifted, graced, called by Office to preach the Word, and
to Administer Signs and Seals. Before Moses's time the Ordinary Exodus 19. 22.
and 24. 5. Numb. 3. 12. 13. and 8. 17.
Ministers were the first born of Families, into whose place afterward, the
Priests and the Levites succeeded. Jude 14. 2. Pet. 2. 5 Genesis 20 7. Deuteronomy. 33.
8, 9, 10. Mal. 2. 7.
Enoch was a Prophet, Noah was a Preacher, Abraham was a Prophet. The Priests
and the Levites were the Pastors and the Teachers: Romans 15. 16. (...), and
(...). (...) 2 sim. 2. 1^. (...), To which more might be added; Lev. 1. 6, 12.
And Paul under the New Testament does set out the Ministerial Office now, by
such expressions as were borrowed from the Ministerial Office under the Old.
Public Officers in the Work of the Ministry now, are such as perform the holy
Office of the New Testament Priesthood. Ministerial Workmen, if they would not
be ashamed, should rightly divide the Word of Truth: The cutting of the
Burnt-offering into its pieces, did Figure the Work of the Ministry in the New
Testament Church. It might not be a confused or disordered mangling, it must be
done into the Natural pieces. Isai. 66. 21, 22. and 61. 6. Mal. 3. 3. Ezekiel. 44.
throughout.
The Prophesies concerning the Ministry of the New Testament are set out by
the Ministry of the Old. Numb. 4. 3, 4. and 18. 2-6. 2 Chronicles. 29. 5, etc.
Numb. 8. 9, 10, 11.
The Levites did serve the Priests about Tabernacle and Temple worship, but
were not to come near the Sanctuary nor the Altar. The Elders laid their hands
upon the Levites in setting them apart for the Ministry and Service: How aptly
is this applicable in a New Testament Church? Acts 6. 1-6. 2 Chronicles. 31. 14. 1 Chronicles. 26. 26, 32. and 22. 2.
If you consider Deacons under this Dispensation, as having this to be a part
of their Office, to provide for, and to distribute to the poor. Thus also were
some of the Levites employed, in such Ordinary Ministeries of distrubution of
the Church-Treasure, overseeing the holy things, and the Work of Jehovah too.
Exodus 15. 20, 21. Numb. 12. 12. Mic. 6. 4. Exodus 25 25, 26 and 38. 8. Romans 16.
1, 2, 3, 4. 1 Timothy 5. 4, 10.
Neither was the Old Testament without its Diaconesses, its ministering Women;
whose Ministry and Service was used by the Church. These are the particular
instances of this Objector, to every one of which I have brought some
Testimonies out of the Old Testament. As for Rules about Church-Offices, under
the New Dispensation, a discerning eye may see, now the New Testament is
written, that Christ and his Apostles did in their teaching much refer their
hearers unto the Romans 12 1-8.
Analogy of Faith under the Old Testament. The style of the New does not carry
along with it a form of enacting such new Laws, and new Rules, of which there
was not any thing at all under the Old Administration: But we find Christ Mat.
5. 17, 18, 19.
confirming the old Laws of the ten Words, John 19. 28. Mat. 3. 1^. (...)
accomplishing the old Types, and fulfilling the foregoing Prophesies
concerning himself: Interpreting the meaning of the Types, and setting up the
Anti-types in the room of them: And where he does bring in Laws, it is
occasionally, either to open their meaning, or to prove somewhat thereby, or
from thence to exhort, correct, instruct some way or other to apply it to the
present case: declaring himself to be one and the same Lawgiver that was of
Old: Whereby he does demonstrate, that the Old Testament is still to be a Rule
under the New. (The difference between them being only in the diverse form, and
manner of dispensing, as will be more shown hereafter.) The regulation now is
to be made according to that proportion which the new Administration does call
for, and the old Rules must be new applied; which as to the matter now here
under Question have a clearer Revelation, and a more spiritual Dispensing. So
that the New Testament Word is much the Old Testament Scripture gone over
again, in more clearness, fullness, perfection, spirituality, glory and
heavenliness. The Old and the New Testament-Will of God, are not contrary
Wills, but one and the same Will, diversified only in some particulars of the
manner of administering: the new Will is the old Will revived, and cleared, and
confirmed, and so put into a more heavenly form. There is a well measured
equality between the Old and the New, a well agreeing sameness of word, and
there should be a true proportioned collation of both Testaments each with
other. All and every of Christ's Institutions had ever a word of his to warrant
them: even in the times of the Apostles, a word written about such Institutions
in the Old Testament in Type, Prophecy, or some such like way: and a Word
spoken by Christ before the New Testament was written, referring to the
foregoing Patterns of them in the Old, which word afterward also was put into
the New Testament Scripture: whereas we know no word from Christ, either in the
Old Testament or New, for the first day being a weekly day, separated and
appointed for a day of Holy Worship in the room of the Seventh day Sabbath.
Thus far this Author himself does acknowledge, that the first day was not
instituted by Scripture, all the Old Testament through; which did not contain
its Institution; so that the Believers of that age in Christ's time, had no
written word at for any such observance of the first day, any where all their
Bible through. Let this concession be improved by the wise and discerning, the
serious and the considering Reader. However therefore the matter of fact may
have been afterward reported in Humane Histories, we expect, that the matter
of Right be proved from God-inspired Scriptures. Whatever this Author do say,
that this being the common usage of so observing the first day in the Apostles
times, by them and by the Churches of their Plantation, and that therefore
there was no such need of putting this pretended matter of fact into Scripture
History; it appears hereby, how broken this Reed of his Assertion is, which he
would have all the Christian World to lean upon. After several years serious,
diligent search, I cannot find any such common usage, no not so much as one
particular instance, that either any one of the Apostles themselves, or any one
of the Churches of their planting did ever so much as once so observe the first
day, as the weekly Sabbath Day: Although if that could be proved, it does not
yet determine this case upon our hearts, who do expect Scripture Institutions,
Commands, Prophecies, Promises, and such like appointments, as have harmonious
consent of the whole Scripture besides, that speaks of that matter, if there
had been any such great change of the weekly Sabbath Day, as is pretended. If
the force of this Authors arguing do lie there, how evident is it, that there
was great need of writing such a Matter of Fact, that had so weighty a case of
so great consequence in it! Jer. 33 6-15. Genesis 23. later end.
It is the common practice of all the wise part of mankind, to take along with
them sufficient credible witnesses of it, such whose Testimony will upon
occasion stand firm in Law, when they first take actual possession of some
great Estate, of a rich Inheritance settled upon them, and upon theirs that
shall come after them; and to set it down in writing, and to keep the Records
of it well attested, especially when another does claim a former Title for some
hundreds of years: (As this of the seventh-day Sabbath did, for some thousands
of years;) for some ages beyond the memory of man; and when they could not but
foresee, that their Title would be so much called in question, and
controverted: and especially too, where the Matter of Fact is pretended, as it
is by this Author, so much to prove the Matter of Right: All Matters of Fact
that do pass into Historical Writing, are fittest to be written in the same age
wherein they were done, as being then better known in their circumstances by
sensible demonstrations, which cannot be so well discerned in after ages. How
fond are Traditionists of unscriptural, humane Antiquities and Universalities?
Whereas Errors have been ancient, even as long, full home to the times of the
Apostles: 2 Thessalonians. 2. 3, 7. 1 John 2. 18. and 4. 3. 1 Timothy 4. 1, 2, 3. Rev. 13.
3, 4.
Even then did the Mystery of iniquity begin to work; there were even then many
Antichrists and Malignant Assemblies: and when the Antichrist shall be
revealed, there would be a great Apostasy and Defection from the Truth. The
Revelation has foretold, that all the World would go a whoring after the
Beast, and would worship the Beast and the Dragon that gave him power; yet are
these some of their Notes of a visible Church, Antiquity and Universality:
which that they might be the sooner imposed upon, the hoodwinck'd credulous
World, have another vain pretense going along with them, altogether as
unscriptural and vain, as they; that is, that the Church cannot err. And they
falsely call their particular Romish Synagogue, the Catholic Church. I
expectingly believe, and hopingly wait for a coming day, when our plain,
tender, sincere, upright-hearted people will be undeceived, and no longer to
suffer themselves to be deluded and imposed upon by such confident Assertions
as this Objector does bring them: As if that, which beyond all doubt must
assure them, that de facto, the first day was by the Apostles separated for
holy Worship, especially in public Church Assemblies, is the full and
unquestionable expository evidence of the practice of all the Churches in the
World, since the very days of the Apostles. For so has this Learned Author
affirmed. Reader, bethink thy self, what thy Faith must resolve it self into,
if it will follow this misguiding? How can such believers as never traded in
this kind of humane Learning ever come to undoubted assurance about the matter?
How can they be fully ascertained of this who were never versed, nor are ever
like to be, neither are under any such obligation by any Scripture Precept to
be thoroughly versed, and understandingly read, in all and every of the
Writings, of all and every of the Ecclesiastical Histories, that do write about
this? Or, if it were possible and facible, that they could compass this (of
which I can see no end; who yet have more helps and advantages this way than
the most) How can they unquessionably be confirmed in this persuasion, that
there never was any one Church of Christ that did escape the Humane
Church-Record and History? And if so, who can tell them, but that, that
particular Church might be of a different judgment and practice? What does
this kind of arguing in this Author mean? What? would it have our people, to
resolve their satisfaction and assurance (concerning the pretended first day
Sabbath) into that report which their humane fallible Guides do make unto them
of this, without their trial of it? 1 John 4 1-6. 1 Thessalonians (...). 20, 21. Isai
8. 20.
The Word of Christ does call upon them to try the spirits, whether they be of
God, and to prove all things that are thus brought them by Teachers, by the
Scripture-canon and Touch stone, as the one and the only infallible Rule. What
a kind of Faith is that, which is a trusting of fallible men without trial? a
depending upon Humane Authorities without Scripture Evidence? The God-inspired
Authority of Christ, and of his Word, is fully attested within the holy
Scriptures own bounds, and needs not step out to Humane Histories, Authorities
and Traditions: However this Author would buz into the ear such amazing
expressions as this, that it is impossible it should be otherwise than as such
Humane History does record of the practice of all the Churches since the times
of the Apostles, and that this Testimony is infallible.

Humane History, and that part of it which they call Ecclesiastical History,
however it be a pleasant study, and an employ someways in its place profitable,
yet of all kinds of Scientifick Learning, is one of the weakest common places
of arguing, and the least convincing for demonstration, because it does resolve
its probations into the fallible Testimonies of lying men, and so does not,
cannot give any firm full satisfaction to an inquiring Spirit, and studious
Mind, who will still be doubtful and afraid, how he does bottom his Faith, in
so weighty a case as is now before him, upon such an unsure and unsafe ground,
as he can build no firmness of belief and certainty of knowledge upon, even the
uncertain witness of deceivable men, what their eyes, and ears, and tongues,
and pens have reported to us, who are so many hundred years come into the World
after they were dead and gone; that way of disputing therefore, which this
mighty man of Humane Reason has walked in to find out some place if he could,
where to make his First day Sabbath cause to stand, is such a by-path as does
mislead his Reader into bogs, where he cannot settle and stay with any good
confidence, and sound comfort, Such arguments may take with over credulous
minds, and with passive intellects, who, through idleness and guile of spirit
in a matter which would engage them in so much of self-denial, and of cross
bearing, had rather use another man's writings and reasonings, than be at the
pains of studying of the Scriptures, and of exercising their own understanding.

What has at large been written in trying this Objectors spirit upon the former
Scriptures in an answer also to the next mentioned by him in the Revelation;
which he calls another Historical hint of the New Testament.

How can a change of the weekly Sabbath Day from one day to another, from the
seventh to the first, be soundly proved from Rev. 1. 10.
this other Scripture? where he, that is of a serious spirit, and does
diligently inquire after word-satisfaction about this matter, cannot find
either Sabbath or First day; either in terms plainly expressed, or clearly
employed, or necessarily inferred; in this place, or in the context, or in the
design of the Holy Spirit here, or by comparing of it with other places of
Scripture? Those that would lay the foundation of so great a change, should see
their Scripture grounds to be more evident, convincing, and firm. What one Word
is there in this Scripture, that does warrant any new Instition from Christ,
for the observing of the First day, as the weekly Sabbath Day? What one word is
there here of command so to observe the First day? What one word of Promise
made to the observers of the First day as such? What one word of threatening
against any that do not so observe the First day, as the weekly Sabbath day?
and if there be not any one word here, for the First day, either as to
Institution or Command, or Promise, or Threating, how can any observer keep it
aright, either in Faith or Obedience, in Hope or Fear? The direct plain meaning
of this Scripture is, if I mis-judge not, that this day does evidently relate
to that providential Day of the LORD Christ's appearing in the fulfilling of
this Prophecy, who appeared to John Rev. 17. 14. and 19. 16.
as LORD pleading the Cause of his Kingly Lordly Office, which has been too
long, and too far invaded by the Kings and Lords of the Earth, who have not
enforced Christ's Laws, nor made them to be the Rule of Government, but usurped
an unscriptural authority over men's consciences and souls. How Lordly a Day
therefore will it be when Christ will recover and exercise his Power and his
Right! Those great things which this ever-blessed LORD of Glory would do in the
latter ages, were represented Rev. 1. 1.
to John from Christ by an Angel in a way of Prophetical Revelation. This
manifestation by Vision, and by Voice was after such a manner, as if the thing
had been acted and performed before and to John's senses. By comparing of 1
Rev. 1. 10. compared with Rev. 6. 17. and 9. 6, 15. and 10. 7. and 11. 3, 6, 9,
11. and 16. 14.
this passage, with some other passages in the same book of Revelation relating
to the same matter: he, that does diligently mark, and wisely observe, and
rightly understand, may see, that this Lordly Day, is the great Providential
Day of that God, that Almighty One (a Rev. 1. 8. and 4. 8. and 11. 17. and 15.
3. and 16. 7, 14. and 19. 6, 15. and 21. 22.
name several times given to Christ in this Book) There are several parts of
this great comprehensive large Vision: and there are several seasons of their
fulfillings; and accordingly several days in this great Day: Ezekiel. 13, 5. 8.
and 30. 3. and 29. 1, 9. compared with Rev. 20. 8.
Ezekiel does mention one part of this Prophecy that will last seven years.
The LORD Jesus Christ will come, and come, in several Judgments, on several
Hours, Days, Weeks, Months and Years. It is one of his Names to be such a one

as is coming: and he is called the coming King: And his Kingdom is a coming
Kingdom, and the age of this, is said to be a coming Age, and the World to
come, a coming World. In every age of the Church of Christ, there were
fulfillings of this in part. Those in Rev. 1. 3. 7.
John's time had somewhat of this Lordly Day, who therefore were to behold
Christ's coming: This was partly Historical before John's death; when Christ
came in his admirable way of wonderful providence to destroy Jerusalem,
according as was foretold in Mat. 23, 37, 38, 39. and 24. 1-22. and elsewhere.
other Scriptures: and partly Prophetical to be accomplished in the several
ages after John's time. John saw this Day in a Vision, and speaks of it with
Rev. 1. 7.
a double confirmation; John was Rev. 1. 10. and 4. 2. and 17. 3. and 21. 10.
made to be in the Spirit on that Lordly Day. An expression, of which he had
experience, as is mentioned in other places of this Book. The Article added,
that Lordly Day, does determine but indefinitely. There is no such certain
particular Day of the Week pointed out so to our understanding, on what Day of
the Week it will begin, or on what Day of the Week it will end. This is not the
design, at least, not as to the pretended change of the Weekly Sabbath Day. It
was Rev. 1. 7. compared with Zach. 12. 10.
that Lordly Day of Christ's coming, when he would convert and recover the
chosen remnant of those of Israel, and of Judah, and destroy the Rebellious,
and the unbelieving among them. If men will be limiting of this day to any one
determinate, definite particular day of the week, what one day has such a plea
as the Seventh-day Sabbath? Seeing, for the dreadfully executed Judgment part
of it, as the first Temple was destroyed, being burnt with fire on the Jor. 52.

granted even by many adversaries to be the Seventh-day Sabbath, he told the
Jews before it came to pass, that their Temple would be burnt with Fire, if
they profaned the Sabbath of Jehovah: Answerable unto which is that passage

Sabbath-breaking, when the Elders came to inquire what the mind of the LORD

Ecclesiastical Histories, may find it recorded in them, that the second Temple
was actually destroyed according to this Prophetical threatening of our LORD, on
the seventh-day Sabbath. The change of Jehovah's Ordinance, (of which, men's
changing of his Seventh day Sabbath, is one) is soretold in Isai. 24. 4, 5. and

on the Seventh day Sabbath, of which some account has been given before. So
that if a particular day of the week, in the weekly returns of it, were here
designedly pointed at: Fxod. 22. 10. Deuteronomy 5. 14. Exodus 35. 2 Lev 23. 3.
what day can plead and claim a fairer Title and Right unto it, than the

and observed; being a keeper of his Fathers Commandments, whereof this of the
Seventh-day Sabbath was one. Those that do rely on the judgment and
authorities of men, about the meaning of this expression, may consider, that
See Magdeburg Histor. 2. Ceat. 9. Book.
Ecclesiastical Historians do relate, that John, and his followers the Eastern
Asiatick Churches, did keep the Passover on the Seventh-day, not pressing the
observation of the first day, for the celebration of the Passover, as the
Western Churches did: Further, as in Low Dutch, the seventh Day is named
Rust-dagh, that is the Day of Sabbath, or of Rest; so in Teutonick or High
Dutch, or the German Tongue (which is an ancient Nation and Language) the last
Day, the seventh Day of the Week, is called Samstag, as if Schemtag, that is
the LORD's Day, or the Day of the LORD. It is further yet observable, as to
this, that the Visions of Ezekiel and those of John, well agreeing in many
particulars, (which a diligent comparer may easily observe) Ezekiel. 1. 1.
Ezekiel's Visions, were on the fifth day of the fourth Moon, which some affirm
to have been the Seventh day Sabbath, Jehovah's Day. But upon the whole, it is
the first answer that I more stick unto, namely that, the Lordly Day is that
great Providential Day, when he will more visibly appear as King and LORD.
Whereas, some do object, that this word in (...), 1 Cor. ^1. 20. 23, ^4, 25,
26, 27. 29. 32.
Greek, Lordly, is applied but to one thing more in the New Testament, which is
the Supper, called the Lordly Supper, or LORD's Supper, or the Supper of the
LORD: What can there rationally, necessarily, convincingly be inferred from
thence, as to any establishing of the first day of the week in the room of the
seventh, as the weekly Sabbath, in this place of the Revelation? The Lordly
Supper, or Lordy Supper, is expressly mentioned. Whereas, here is no express
mention of the first Day, as a Sabbath day, not either of the words, First or
Sabbath, nor their sense and meaning in the Text or Context, nor any where else
in all this Book, or in the whole Scripture. The Lordly Supper is so called, in
that it was instituted by our LORD: It is to his Honor, a Lordly Feast, one
great design and end of it, being to exalt Christ in his Lordship; and to show
forth the Death of this LORD, till he came in his Lordly appearance in the
later Day. This Ordinance was received of the LORD by Paul: It was the LORD who
Instituted it: It sets out the LORD's Death: The Cup is called the Cup of the
LORD: The LORD's Body, we read of also there. Which Supper is not fixed to the
first day of the Week. The first Institution, Administration, and Participation
of it, was on Mat. 26. 17-28. Lev. 23. 5-16.
another Day of the Week, on the Passion Day, on the Passover Day; which is
called a Sabbath. For a further discovery, that a Day in some Scriptures is
used for a larger space of time than from one going in of the Sun on one day,
to the next going in of the Sun on the next day; consider, that in the
Scriptures, day does sometimes set out the time of Christ's Reign and glorious
Power: 2 Thessalonians. 2. 2. 2 Pet. 2. 9. 1. Cor. 5. 5. 2 Pet. 1. 19. Heb. 10. ^5

The day of judging of his grand Adversaries: John saw this in the Vision, as
if the time had been then present. Will not that be a Lordly Day, when Christ
will glorify and magnify his Office of King and of LORD, in the utter
destruction of Enemies, and in the eminent salvation of Friends? It is called
the Day of Christ, the Day and Kingdom of God, the presence of coming of
Christ. Do not these expressions significantly declare some glorious shining
season of Christ's Lordly appearing? It is named the Day of Jehovah, about six
and twenty times; and in some of those places, the Day of the Vengeance, and of
the Anger of Jehovah; and the Day of Jehovah's Battle: The great, and terrible,
and dreadful Day of Jehovah, Rev. 6. 17. and 16. 14.

Day does sometimes denote a long continued duration; as the Day of the Age, or
the Day of Eternity. Other times Day points out 2 Cor. 6. 2. Isal. 61. 2.
the time of Grace, and of Salvation. And now upon this occasion having shown,
that Day does not always in all Scriptures point out any one particular Day of
the Week distinctly from, and in opposition to, the rest of the Days of the
Week, I have here some fair opportunity to write a little about Psalm. 118. 22,
23, 24, 25, 26. compared with Acts 4. 10, 11, 12.
one other Scripture, which some do urge to put a color upon their first Day,
as if it did point out the first Day of the Week, as the eminent, transcendent,
determinate, definite day of Christ's completing the Work of Redemption on his
Resurrection Day; which, say they, was then, and from thenceforth to be
observed as the weekly Sabbath day in the room of the Seventh: Thus they. As to
what does concern Christ's Resurrection, as also how and when he completed the
Work of Redemption, I have written already: and I am now to consider this
Scripture, which is mentioned by all and every of the Mat. 21. 9. Mar. 21. 9.
Luk 9. 22. and 19. 38. John 12 13. compare, Mat. 21. 42, 46. Mar. 12. 10, 11,
12. Luke 19. 14. and 20. 17-20. and 23. 18 36.
four Evangelists; In which Historical-fulfilling it is evident, that much and
the main of this Prophetical passage was fulfilled according to the Letter
before Christ's Resurrection, and upon another Day of the Week, than that first
Day of the Week, for which it is so brought and pressed (although if it could
be proved to be otherwise, yet does it no way determine this Case about a
pretended change of the weekly Sabbath, from one Day of the Week to another,
from the Seventh to the First.) The chief men of the Jews, who were counted the
Builders, did more notoriously refuse Christ the Head Corner Stone, when being
put to their choice, they actually, openly, declaredly preferred a Barabbas,
who was a seditious Murderer, before an innocent, holy Jesus, and this on a Day
of solemn Judicature; when the Judge Pilate sat upon Christ, either for life or
for death: which also was by a joint consent of chief Priests, and Rulers, and
People, who cry out all at once, Luke 23. ^1-21. Mat. ^1. 38, 39.
Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: This was before that Christ
was crucified. Also after his Death before his Resurrection, the chief Priests
and the Pharisees do call him Mat. 27. 62, 63.
a Deceiver; and this before Pilate: which was another refusing and rejecting
of Christ: Thus according as was Prophesied in that Psalm, that the Builders
would refuse that Stone, which was to become for Head to the Corner: so
accordingly did they act, as at many other times, Acts 3. 13, 14, 15.
so at these two seasons, one in Christ's life time, the other after his death;
and both before his rising. The chief Priests did count themselves, and were
counted by others to be Builders, yet thus notoriously did they refuse Christ.
The word in the Psalm, according to the Hebrew, in its propriety of
signification, is, they have reprobated, rejected, despised, refused, scorned,
or turned away from: and that expression in a Acts 3. 13, 14.
place of the New Testament, does signify, ye have earnestly desired and
refused: and that when Judge Pilat had absolved him in his own declared
judgment, yet did they crave earnestly, that a man murderer, and a seditious
one might be freed, and that Christ, whom yet they could not justly charge with
any crime, or the least sin, might be crucified. Then and thus was Christ
reprobated of these men. Was it not an eminent Day of monstrous rejecting, when
the question being put to them, whether of the two they would have to be
released, they preferred a seditious Murderer? Man. 12. 1-14. Mar. 3. 1, etc.
Luke 6. 1-11. John 5. 9-18. Luke 4. 16-31.
Though there were other times of their refusing and rejecting of Christ before
this, and that, on the Seventh day Sabbath: but it was more notorious on the
Passion day. It was also Prophesied in that Psalm, that the people would pray,
O Jehovah save now, or prosper now, blessed be he that comes in the Name of
Jehovah: This was fullfilled before the Day of Christ's crucifixion, when he
rode into Jerusalem, and the people went forth to meet him, crying, Hosanna,
Hoshignana, in the Hebrew, or John 12. 12, 13. Mat. 21. 1-9, etc. Mar. 11. 8,
9, 10. Luke 19. 37-40.
Hosanna, as it is put into the Greek. These things are plain, familiar and
clear, evident of themselves upon the bare reading of them, and are not any
forced interpretations of my own. What a far way about do Objectors go, and
carry their Followers along with them, to bring them at last to that which is
no proof at all of that, for which they have brought them thither? As for the
Day spoken of, which Jehovah made for his people to rejoice in, it is the large
Day of Grace under the New Testament Dispensation of Grace; which does take in
many a Natural Day: And 1 Thessalonians. 5. 16. Psalm. 90. 14. Isai. 65. 18. Psalm 92.
Title and v. 1-4. Isai. 56. 7.
as for spiritual rejoicing, it is every days work, though more especially upon
the Seventh-day Sabbath: so that in short, there being not in the Scriptures
urged by Objectors, either First day, or Sabbath Day, either in the letter of
the words, or in any necessary consequence, naturally flowing from thence, or
any design that looks any thing like a change of the weekly Seventh-day
Sabbath, translating it to any other day; How any satisfaction can such a
change be inferred and enforced from hence? To return therefore a while, unto
that place in the Revelation, although there must be some particular distinct
determinate Day of the Week, when John first saw the beginning of this Vision;
For all that does come to pass in time, must necessarily be on one Day or other
of the Week; yet this Lordly Day here spoken of, had not this design at all in
it, to set up the first day in the room of the seventh. The skilful in the
Greek Tongue do know, that an Adjective joined to a Substantive, does usually
mean the Genitive Case of that Substantive; as the Lordly Day, is the Day of
Lordship, or Day of the LORD. So we find this expressed in See Hutterus's
Edition of the (...) New Testament in twelve Languages.
other Languages: In Hebrew it is, in the Day of our LORD, in Syriack, a Day of
the LORD: So in Spanish, in a Day of the LORD. In Greek, the Participles have
sometimes the force of the Nouns: So in English, the LORD's Day, or the Day of
the LORD: as in the other instance, where the word is used, the LORD's Supper,
or the Supper of the LORD. 1 Cor. 11. 23-26.
For which Supper we have evident express, both Institution, appointing of it,
and command, injoyning us to do it; Promise making over and sealing the benefit
of Christ's Death, to such as partake of it worthily, after a due sitting
manner; and threatening, denouncing judgments against the profaners of this
Ordinance: None of all which; either Institution, Command, Promise or
Threatening, have we yet after all our search, found, for the first Day to be
the Day of the weekly Sabbath, in the place of the seventh: so that, here is no
foundation, for belief and practice to build upon. 2 Pet. 1. 20, 21. 2 Timothy 3.
16, 17. Romans 15. 4.
Where any one place of Scripture is so interpreted, as not to have the
Harmonious Oneness, and the well agreeing consent of the whole Scripture, where
they do treat of that matter or subject, there that is the interpretation of
men's own private spirit; and not the interpretation of the Spirit of Aelohim:
And therefore the cause of the first day, as the weekly Sabbath, not having the
whole Scripture profitable for the proving of it, cannot stand in the
judgment, notwithstanding one misinterpreted Scripture, is yet further
alleged to defend it; if the urger of it could be any Art plead it.

One historical hint more, this Objector does suppose may be, with respect to
the Day of Pentecost, which he thinks was that year, on the first Day of the
Week, when the pourings out of the holy Spirit were on the Apostles, and so
thinks it to be the Day separated by the Apostles for holy Worship, especially
in public Church Assemblies: and yet he says, he was loath to name the day of
the sending down of the Holy Ghost ( For a Ghost is taken to be the departed
Spirit of a man (about which the Ethnic Philosophers had diverse idolatrous,
superstitious, observations, customs, practices and usages) p^rly applied to
the Holy Spirit.
Holy Spirit, it should have been said) was given as a proof, because that some
do controvert it; but it seems to him a very considerable thing.

I must therefore return somewhat in answer unto this. It is much of the
Artifice in the present age, as in some other cases, so concerning the matter
under debate, to darken and obscure some particular places of Scripture, either
by corrupt Translations, or by false Interpretations, upon which to ground
their wrong Inferences, and conjectural consequences; and then to persuade the
plain people how deep these things do lie: and how much they should lean upon
the Wisdom and Advice of their Church Guides who much study humane Histories
for them, to lead them, through what? through those dark Mazes, into which
these Guides have misled them. Whereas, the Scriptures about the weekly
Sabbath, are full of Prove. 8. 8, 9. Deuteronomy. 27. 1, 8.
clear Light, and of satisfying self-evidence, to those who are made thoroughly
willing to do the acceptable Will of Jehovah Aelohim. What conviction can there
be brought in upon the understanding concerning any change of the weekly
Sabbath Day, from the seventh to the first day of the week, where is not either
expressed or employed any thing at all of any such change; and where the Reader
cannot find the first day spoken of, or hinted to, to any such purpose? The
Passover is acknowledged by this Author, on this year of Christ's Death to be a
Seventh-day Sabbath: If so, Lev. 23. 11-16.
then including that day in the number of fifty, and seven Sabbaths reckoned
and added to that day, Pentecost, or the fiftieth day, was a Seventh-day
Sabbath also; (for, so was the computation, seven times seven, being forty and
nine) the Passover going before, and being put to the seven sevennies, the last
of those seven Sabbath Days was the fiftieth day, and a Seventh day Sabbath. As
in the computing the Jubilee year, there were seven times seven years, which
adds together, do make up the number of forty nine years; which by reckoning
of the former Jubilee year into the number, does make up a fiftieth year; the
last of those seven sevennies of years being the Jubilee year: For this honor
did Johovah put upon the number of seven in the Scriptures, with respect to
diverse of his Institutions; the last day which was the seventh, being solemnly
dignified, as in the weekly Sabbath, which is the last day in the week. And
this, in the way, answers that which some others do allege for their first
day; from such Scriptures, which do speak of an eighth day, and an eighth-days
Sabbath, as a typical proof. As for that expression, relating to the Feast of
Booths or Tabernacles, that lasted seven days; now that on the Lev. 23. 31, 36,
39. Numb. 29. 35.
eighth day should be an holy Convocation, a solemn Assembly, a day of
Restraint, a Sabbath: upon such a supposition that the first day of that Feast
was the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, or at least when it so fell out to be and
was so, then this eighth day, the day after this Feast must be a Seventh day
Sabbath also. But whatever it were, as to that; the Scripture proofs for the
observing of the Seventh-day, the last day of the week, as the weekly
Sabbath Day, are clear and full: For Objectors against this to pretend
possibilities and probabilities of Aelohim's declaring and signifying of his
mind about changing the day of the Sabbath, is a darkning of counsel in words
without knowledge, and a going off from Scripture Light, to unscriptural
darkness: For the Seventh-day Sabbath we have evident express commands and
promises, to awe us, and to encourage us in the observation thereof, that what
we do may be done in Obedience and in Faith; so for that other Ezekiel. 43. 2^,
26, 27. compare Levit. chapter 8. throughout chapter 9. 1-17. especially v. 17. Numb.
28. 1-10.
place, where it is foretold, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the
Priests shall make their Burnt-offerings upon the Altar: If the first of those
seven days of sanctifying the Altar were a Seventh-day Sabbath, the eighth day
was a Seventh-day Sabbath too: although I take the plain meaning of the so
forward there, to set out the daily Offerings upon the Altar, the continual on
every day: For the Seventh-day-Sabbath-worship is distinctly spoken of in an
Ezekiel. 46. 1, etc.
after part of that Prophecy. There are several sorts of Ezekiel. 45. 17-25. and
46. 2 -12.
Times mentioned by this Prophet, Passover-time, New Moon-time, Booth-time,
besides these Festival Times for Moons and Years, there is weekly Seventh-day
Sabbath-time, which is one evident establishment of the last day of the week,
for the continued weekly Sabbath Day, in the weekly returns of it, under the
New Testament Dispensation: For, Ezekiel. 46. 1.
the Seventh-day Sabbath, was in the same week after the six working days,
which were to go before in the same week, and for the continuing of the day
from evening to evening: (and this Seventh-day Sabbath not being a Type, figure
and shadow, as the Ceremonies of the old Dispensation were, but a natural,
standing, confirmed, commanded, weekly Sabbath Day, from the first week of the
created World:) And there is also daily time set forth for Evening and for the
Morning-worship: and to this, does Ezekiel. 43. 27. compare with this, chapter 46. 13,
14, 15.
that place forementioned refer, as the Sacrifices do expressly declare. The
Altar was seven days in purging, which does denote the through purity of
Spiritual Worship in the later days: The number of seven in Scripture, being a
number of perfection, fullness and sufficiency: This being done and finished,
they must be on the eighth, and so still onwards, on the ninth, tenth day and
forward, continually as days come on, offer daily spiritual Sacrifices thereon.
Thus have I shown, as to the former Objector, that his pretended Historical
hints, both severally, and apart by themselves, do make nothing at all for his
purpose about his first day. They prove not any such usage for the matter of
Fact, as to the separation of the first day, in the room of the weekly
Seventh-day Sabbath, much less do they prove the matter of Right, which is the
great thing here inquired after. And now if all of them be put together, and
jointly enforced, they speak as little for this as each of them severally, that
is to say, not at all in favor of the first day, as a separated day for holy
Worship: but do either speak of Festival Sabbaths of Passover, or the like, or
of the Seventh-day Sabbaths; or of a Lordly providential day, which does ^inot
ngle out the first day of the week, in the weekly revolution, as the weekly
Sabbath Day, how fain soever this Author would have it so to be. I know no
signal note put upon the first Day of the Week, as the Day of Rest, or solemn
Worship, in the New Testament: The places have been examined, and do set out
and signify another day. And were there an exact literal version, according to
the true proper significancy of the Words, I do not remember any one place all
the New Testament through, where there is so much, as that particular
expression, of the First day of the Week, much less as applied unto a Day of
Rest, or solemn Worship, or weekly Sabbath.

Having thus far cleared the way of such stumbling blocks, which some have cast
before us in our Seventh-day Sabbath journey, there is another stone thrown
before me, which I am to remove, and that is, an Argument for the First Day,
brought in as a Proof of the cessation of the Seventh-day Sabbath, by a
misinterpreted, misapplyed place in the Epistle to the Heb. 4. 8, 9, 10.
Hebrews: which I am now to examine more at large.

That a clear and a full Answer unto this Objection, may be the more freely and
readily received, I shall first give in some lines the plain meaning and scope
of this Scripture; and then further discover, that the Day expressed in the
Psalm. 95. 7-11.
Psalm, and referred unto in the Epistle to the Heb. 3. 7, 13. 15. and 4. 7. 8.
Hebrews, is not to be understood of the First Day of the Week, in the weekly
returns of it, so as to shut out all and every of the other days of the week:
and particularly as to this of Rest, excluding the seventh day from being the
weekly Sabbath for Christians to observe, under the New Testament
Administration of Grace; that the Rest spoken of in that Psalm. 95. 11.
Psalm, and transferred from thence into this Heb. 3. 11, 18. and 4. 1, 3, 5,
8, 9, 10. 11.
Epistle, is not meant either by the Psalmist, or by the Author of this Epistle
to the Hebrews of the weekly Sabbath-rest, as to the First Day of the Week in
opposition to the seventh: Under which the significancy of the word, Sabbatism
will be be searched after. Then, that the, Heb. 4. 10.
He mentioned in one passage in this Epistle, is meant of the Believer: After
that, I shall show wherein Heb. 4. 10.
the parallel does not hold, and wherein it does: What the Heb. 4. 10.
Works are which Believers are said to Rest from: What the force of the Heb. 4.
10. (...).
Conjunction is in this place: What the change of the Number, Heb. 4. 9, 10.
from the Plural to the Singular, may import.

As for the meaning and scope of this Scripture in this Epistle. The
Considerate Reader is desired (after his serious seeking of the LORD, by the
prayer of Faith, to be taught of Him, and to be led into the Truth) diligently
to observe, how the Aim and Design of this Epistle Heb. 3. 7 and onwards to the
11th. verse. of the 4th. chap.
in this part of it, is to confirm and establish the professing Hebrews in the
Heb. 3. 1, 6, 24, ^5.
Faith and Doctrine of the LORD Jesus Christ; which would be the better done,
if they hearkened unto what Christ had said in a both Historical and
Prophetical Psalm. 95. 7.
Psalm to this purpose; and to caution and charge them Heb. 3. 12, 13.
against an evil heart of Unbelief, that would fall off from the Living God,
and harden them through the seducingness of that sin; that he might the more
speedily and thoroughly awaken and quicken them up to attend unto, and to follow
his spiritual and wholesome Counsel, which was so seasonable, in such a time,
when they were so persecuted for their Discipleship to Christ: He shows what
dangerous Evils were near, and what great Mischiefs would follow; if they did
give way to their unbelief, distrust and carnal fear, they would then backslide
from their Heavenly Calling, and from their Holy Profession: And if they did
live and did in such a state, of unbelief and of unperswadedness, of
unrepentingness and of disobedience, they would be shut out of that Spiritual,
Heavenly, Eternal Heb. 4 1.
Rest of God in Christ. And that his manner of Arguing might be the more
convincing and prevailing, he brings a strong evident proof of it out of Psalm.
95. 11.
one of the Psalms; it being that Scripture, which the Author of this Epistle
does Comment upon, and expound here: Where the Holy Spirit, by the Prophet
David (who penned Heb. 3. 7. and 4. 7. compared with Psalm. 9^.
that Psalm for him) having exhorted the Israel of God, to laud Jehovah, The
95th. Psalm has passages in it, which do speak of Christ, as appears by
comparing, 1 Cor. 10. 9. and Heb. 3. 7. and 4. 3, etc.
the Messiah, The Rock of His people's Salvation; and to obey His Voice, whilst
the Day of His Grace, and of their life did last: Earnestly dehorting those of
his Time and Age from that unbelief which would have an hardening effect upon
their heart, and exclude them out of Aelohim's Heavenly Rest: As the like
prevailing unbelief, and hardness, and disobedience, and unperswadableness had
shut out many of their Fore fathers out of that Numb. 14. 21, 22, 23, 24, 30,
32.
Canaan-Rest, which was a Type of the Heavenly Rest, the Figure of a Heb. 4. 9.
Better Rest, in a Better Country. For the preventing of which Exclusion, that
his speech might come with the more weight upon their spirits, David does bring
in Aelohim himself; exhorting the people, that they would not follow the bad
Example of their Forefathers, who were not of a Teachable Mind, nor of a
Practical Understanding, nor of an Inclinable Will, nor of an Obedient
Carriage; and so die away n Heb. 11. 16.
in their Wilderness-state. This dreadful Example he Heb. 3. 12-1^. and 4. 1,
2, 6, 11.
makes use of to awe the Christian Hebrews in his Day, unto an abiding st^dfast
in the Christian Religion; lest otherwise, they also did fall after the same
Example of unbelief and of disobedience; and so loytered behind and came not
safe-full-home to the Heavenly Rest. That the forcibleness of his right Arguing
words might not be abated by any who would be Replying, that there were other
Rests besides the Heavenly Rest, which also were spoken of in the Word of God;
as if it may be the Psalmist spoke of one or other of those Rests, and not of
that Spiritual, Eternal, Heavenly Rest; therefore he reckons up several kinds
of Rests: There was the Rest of the Seventh-day Sabbath: This the Prophet David
did not particularly mean in that Psalm, because this Rest of the Seventh-day
Sabbath was Heb. 4. 3, 4. cut of Genesis 2. 2, 3.
from the foundation of the World, the last day of the first created Week.
Which therefore, being from the beginning thus honored, both by Aelohim's
Word, and in its own Created Nature, must remain the Weekly Sabbath Day to the
end of the World: And this Rest, as to the outward part at least, of keeping
the Seventh day as the only Weekly Sabbath Day, they in David's time had
already actually entered upon in the Weekly returns of it. Further, There was
the Rest of and in Cana^n, which is called, Psalm 9^. 11. (...). 12. 9. and 1.
34, 35, 36.
the Rest of Jehovah, and expressly, the Rest, where after their Travels and
Journcyings, their Warrings and Conquests Jehovah Christ gave Deuteronomy. 12. 10.
(...) King. 8. (...).
Rest unto his people: (Jerusalem in Canaan has more particularly and specially
the 1 Chronicles. 23. 25. Psalm. 132, 14.
Name of the Rest) he does declare, that neither was this the R^ll, which David
threatened the unbelieving, and disobedient in his time to be shut out of: For
David and they had been, and then actually were, in Canaan, that promised Land
of outward Rest: Jehovah Christ by his servant Heb 4. 8.
Joshua had led their Forefathers into that Rest long before, some hundreds of
years ago, before David's Day. David therefore speaks Heb. 4. 8, 9. Psalm 95.
11.
of another Day after those things in a prophetical manner, and of another
Rest, than either of the two forementioned, the Seventh-day Sabbath Rest, or
the Canaan Rest: neither could it be meant of any other Rest, by any
Enumeration of any other particular, but only of the Spiritual, Eternal
Heavenly Rest of and with a God in Christ; If any thought, that that passage in
the Psalm might be understood of any other Rest, but this Heavenly one, the
Author of this Epistle would readily have demonstrated the mistake. The Rest
that David spoke of, out of which Jehovah Christ from his Father, by his
Spirit, in his Word threatened confirmingly by an Oath, to shut the unbelieving,
and unrepenting, the disobedient and the unperswadable, they living and dying
such, was such a Rest, as those who were in a state of unbelief, were not
actually possessed of: A Rest in a Promise, a Rest yet further to come, offered
and tendered unto them, set plainly and openly in a Worcester. Revelation before
them, if they did not by their own affected ignorance, and wilful transgression
exclude themselves out of it. Heb. 4. 1, 3, 8, 9, 10.
A Rest, into which sound Believers had entered, did and should enter, and so
cease from their own works. Seeing therefore, that there yet further remains
such a Rest, so glorious a Sabbatism, for the people of God, he presses the
professing Hebrews to study and endeavor how to enter into Heb. 4. 1. 1^.
this promised Rest, by yielding the due Obedience of Faith in and unto Christ.

Having thus opened and applied the Scriptures, that we might look the deeper,
and see the clearer into the sense and scope of it, I am next to show, that the
Day (to Day, or this Day) expressed in the Psalm, and referred unto in the
Epistle is not to be understood of the First Day of the Week, in the weekly
returns of it; so as to shut out all and every of the other Days of the Week,
and particularly as to this of Rest, excluding the Seventh day from being the
weekly Sabbath for Christians to observe under the New Testament Administration
of Grace.

Of this, I give these Reasons, grounded upon Scripture, because that Day,
which is spoken of in that Psalm. 95. 7. Heb. 3. 7 13, 15. and 4. 7, 8.
Psalm, and made use of in this Epistle, is such a Day as does take in Heb. 3.
13.
every Day in the Week; as the Author himself does interpret, in the same
Epistle, speaking of the same Day, in this very ease and instance now under
debate; where he puts the Christian Hebrews upon the faithful discharge of that
Gospel-fellowship-duty of mutually exhorting one another daily, or according to
every Day, as the Duty of every Day was, when they had occasion and
opportunity, so to do, whilst it is called to Day, this Day, and the next, and
still the next after that, every Day; whilst Grace is offered, and whilst your
time does last; whilst Christ's Voice from his Father does speak unto you; and
whilst the Spirit of Christ, in the Word and Ministry thereof, does call upon
you. That Hodiernal Day, of which the Holy Spirit does make mention in this
Exhortation, has its duration full home to this our Day, and it appertains no
less unto us, than it did unto in David's time. For the Illative Conjunction
Therefore, in the beginning of the seventh Verse of the third Chapter does
properly belong, to Take heed, in the beginning of the twelfth Verse; as went
before, and so must be here understood: Therefore, as the holy Spirit exhorted
your Fathers to obedience, under pain of exclusion from the Rest of God, so see
ye well unto it, that you yield obedience, lest otherwise, you also be shut out
of the same Holy, Heavenly Rest.

The Seventh-day is in this place mentioned with a double mark of Honor put
upon it, Heb. 4. 3, 4.
that Day, that Seventh: The Law concerning the Seventh-day Rest, or Sabbath,
Genesis (...). 1, 2, 3.
was given to Adam from the beginning, and put into Created Being, in the first
Week of the Created World, and is therefore unchangeable, still standing in its
due Force, and in its full Authority: Whereas, Heb. 3. 7-19. and 4. ^-11.
in all this passage of this Epistle, there is no mention made of the First
Day, either in express words, or by any necessary consequence: So that I may
use the force of Christ's Reason, and the strength of his Argument here, (which
he did in Mat. 19. 4, 8.
another case, bearing yet a very clear like date from the founding of the
World) from the beginning, the First Day of the Week was not the Sabbath:
whereas the Seventh day was made, Instituted, and appointed for the Day of
weekly Rest, the same Week of the Creation, when the foundations of the World
were laid, and when the Glorious Creator did set up his great Works. The Day
thereof prefixed by David, must in this case be some other kind of Day, even
Heb. 4. 7. Psalm. 95. 7.
the determinate day of Grace, and of Life, and of Christ's speaking Voice
during this Day, and of the Deuteronomy. 27. 9. Isal. 58. 4. Hos. 4. 5.
present time.

That expression in the Psalm. 95. 7.
Psalm, to day, or this day, was spoken and written by David to the Priests and
People in History, if it refer to that special occasion of the (...) Sam. 6.
(...) 15.
transferring of the Ark, when David called upon them to come unto that place
of solemn convention for Public Worship, to the Psalm. 42. 3. and 100. 2.
Faces of Aelohim; the Ark being a sign of this; he threatens those of that Day
and Age to be shut out of God's Rest of Eternal Life, as their Forefathers were
shut out of Canaan, in case that they did harden their hearts through unbelief,
Compare Psalm. 95. 7-11, with, Numb. 14. 21, 22, 24, 30, 38. and Heb. 3. 17, 19.
as those had done before them: which therefore cannot be understood of the
First Day oi the Week, as a New Sabbath Day (take it as in part Historical,
though it be further Prophetical also) which the Objectors would set up in the
room of the Seventh day Sabbath: For, then according to this arguing, the
people in David's time, were bound to alter the weekly Sabbath Day from the
Seventh to the First Day of the Week. It is evident by diverse particular
passages, as well as by the whole drift of that Psalm. 95.
Psalm, that is was somewhat fitted for David's Day and time, and for the
people of his age, although withal there is a Spirit of Prophecy in it; For,
those Hebrews, in the days of the Author of that Epistle to them, and we in the
present Generation are concerned in that Scripture; as others also will be in
the Ages after us: Romans 15. 4.
Whatsoever is written in the Holy Scriptures, is written unto all of us,
calling us unto Faith in, and Obedience to, the LORD Jesus Christ: Compare Mat.
12. 26. with Mat. 22. 3^.
What God spoke unto Moses in his time, was spoken by God unto them in Christ's
time, when he conversed for some years visibly, openly here on Earth in the
Flesh: and it is still spoken unto us: and in Heb. 3. 15.
this place to the Hebrews, that Day did reach to the time of this Epistle, and
continues to this Day, and will preach to after times.

That expression in Psalm. 95. 7.
that Psalm, to day, or this day, is that Heb. 2. 7, 13, 15. and 4. 7, 8. 2
Cor. 6. 2.
Day wherein the Voice of Christ by his Spirit from his Father in his Word, and
the Ministry thereof, may and ought to be harkned unto, believed and obeyed,
that is, as long as this Call of Grace does continue, and the time of ones life
does last, the whole season of Grace is this Day. It is a Day taken largely:
For so a Day is sometimes taken, John 9. 4.
for the whole time of conversation here on Earth: Luke 1. 80. 1 Cor. 4. 13.
For Time consisting of Days, Months and Years: For the Johon 8. 56. 2 Pet. 3.
18.
Time of Life: The Day of the Israelites was a long Day. A Day of about forty
Years, with some of them in the Wilderness; wherein they tempted and provoked
God, as is declared in Psalm. 95. 7-11. Numb. 14. 21, 22, 23. Exodus 17. 1-7.
that Psalm, and elsewhere: The Gospel, the glad-tidings of Salvation by Faith
in the Messiah was preached, and the Doctrine of Redemption work, revealed to
the Israelites in Moses's time; (and long before that, in Abraham's time, and
further back also;) and in David's time afterward: though unbelievers did not
savingly profit by 2 Pet. 2. 5. Gal. 3. 8, 9. Heb. 4. 2.
it. To day, or this day, is every present Day, whatever Day of the Week that
Day be, as it passes along in order: Mat. 6. 11. compared with Luk 11. 3. Heb.
13. 8. Isal. 65. 2. with Romans 10. 21. 2 Cor. 6. 1, 2.
several Scriptures do lead to this sense; and for every present Day, of the
time of the New Testament ministration of Grace. There needs no further
evidence of this, than the diligent comparing of the Psalm. 95. 7. with Heb. 3.
7, 13, 15. Heb. 4, 7.
Scriptures in hand: That limited determinate Day, is that Time which the
Sovereign LORD over all, has set unto his speaking to particular persons, and
to their Lifetime of hearing: and it does much refer unto that Numb 14. 21,
22, 23, 30, 32.
term of Years, which he did set and fix in Moses his time, to the unbelieving,
murmuring, rebellious Israelites, and is referred unto in Psalm. 90. 9, 10, 43.
another Psalm.

If To Day were meant of the First Day, as the Weekly Resting Day, Heb. 3. 12,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19. and 4. 1, 2, 11.
then the Israelites had not been the same Example; not so proper, so
resembling an Example of Admonition, for the Prosessing Hebrews to take warning
by; lest running into their Sin, they fell into their Judgments: For the
Israelites Sin and Judgments, for the which they were shut out of that Rest
which the Psalmist does speak of, was not their not entering into the
Observation and Rest of the First Day; which was none, either of their Duty or
Privilege: They had no Law for the keeping of any other Day, Genesis 2. 2, 3.
Exodus 20. 8-11.
but only the Seventh; and of what there is no Law, there is Rom 4. 15. and 5.
13. and 1. John 3. 2. compared.
no Transgression; for Sin is the Transgression of the Law, but their Sin was
hardening of their Heart through unbelief, and unperswadeableness, and
disobedience, contrary to Christ's Mind and Will, in His Word, and by His
messengers. These in David's time had no Ground to expect to enjoy the Rest of
a pretended New day of Weekly Sabbath, under the New Testament Dispensation. It
is therefore from Day to Day, in a continued Succession of Days. Christ's
Command to hearken to His Voice is an Actual Command given forth by Him to His
People every Day; which would more set this out, if it were rendered Deuteronomy 10.
12, 13. and 15. 15. and 6. 6. and 4 40 and 7. 11. and 8. 1, 11. and 11. 8, 13,
27, 28. and 13. 18. and 15. 5. and 19 9. and 27. 1, 4, 10, and 28. 1, 13, 14,
15. and 30. 2, 8, 12, 16.
Participially in the Present Tenses, as it is in several Scriptures: It does
deoote the Continuedness of the Command, as the Successiveness of the Day.

As the Day is mistaken by the Objector, so also is the Rest. The Rest spoken
of in Heb. 3. 11, 18. and 4. 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10.
this Epistle, brought thither out of Psalm. 95. 11.
that Psalm, is not meant either there or here, of the Weekly-Sabbath-Rest: As
to the First Day of the Week, in opposition to the Seventh, let the following
Arguments be exactly weighed in the Scripture balance. One is because the
People in David's time, were not bound to make out after the First-Day-Rest,
not being under any obligation to keep the First Day of the Week as their
Weekly Day of Rest or Sabbath: The Law of the Seventh-Day Sabbath was upon
them, as was showed but a few lines before.

Further, The Rest mentioned in both these places, in that Psalm, and in this
Epistle, was such a Rest as the people (to whom David and the Author of this
Epistle did write this) had not as yet Then entered into; they were not
possessed of it whilst they remained in a State of unbelief, neither ever would
Heb. 4. 1, 11.
if they passed into the other World in that State of Unbelief, impenitence,
disobedience, and unperswadableness. What Rest can then be named for the People
of David's Time, (as is proved in the fore cited place of this Epistle, in the
Margin) to enter into, but only that Spiritual, Eternal Rest of, with, and in
Jehovah, the Messiah? As for the Rest of the Weekly-Sabbath, Genesis 2. 2, 3. Heb.
4. 3, 4.
That was from the Foundation of the World, when God Rested from All His Works
on the Seventh Day; and accordingly blessed and sanctified that Particular Day,
as the Day of the Weekly Sabbath. The Syriack and the Aethiopick Languages do
express the Seventh Day by the word Sabbath, in the fourth Verse of this fourth
Chapter. And this Rest, at least as to the outward part of it, was Entered upon
by the Israelites in David's time, and Exodus 16. 22-30. and 20. 8-11.
by their Forefathers long before.

The Rest mentioned in the forecited places of this Epistle is such a Rest as
he and others had a Probability, as well as Possibility, (though with
difficulty and studiousness) to enter yet into, unless by their own unbelief
and hardening of their Heart they did Heb. 4. 1-11.
fall short of it. Let Us fear: Us; He includes Himself; Whereas if the
First-day-rest, pretended from hence to be the Christians Weekly-Sabbath, had
been the Rest here meant, what difficulty or studiousness was there as to their
entering upon this, so far at least, as to the External Duty and Privilege? and
especially, as to the particular Case of the Author of this Epistle, and of
other of the Believing among those Hebrews in his Day, who are supposed by
these Objecters, to have already entered upon the First-Day-Rest that is
pretended; which Author so earnestly exhorted the Hebrews to Enter upon the
same Rest? For we are to observe, that he joyneth himself with the Hebrews to
quicken up himself as well as them unto an Holy Fear, lest Heb 4. 1, 11.
he and they otherwise fell short of the Promised Rest through want of due
diligence, and through careless negligence, though he himself reckon himself
among the Heb. 3.
Believers: He inforceth his exhortation by this Argument amongst others, in
the fourteenth Verse of the third Chapter, drawn from a very profitable effect
of it, even from the consortship, and society, and fellowship, that such will
have with Christ in that heavenly inheritance; if they retain firm even unto
the end, that beginning of confidence or subsistence; ( Heb. 11. (...).
by which, Faith is described in this Epistle.) As for any partakership of
Christ, in a way of conformity to him, with respect to the observation of
weekly Sabbath Day, it could have no relation to the First Day of the Week,
which Day Christ observed not as a Sabbath, but through the whole of his life
kept the Seventh day, as the weekly Sabbath Day.

The great Design of this Epistle, (the same thing which does run all the
Scripture through, where occasion is given and taken, to speak of this matter)
is to prove, that a state of unbelief, lived, layn, and dyed in, will shut the
guilty of it, out of the sweet satisfying enjoyment of the True, Spiritual,
Eternal, Heavenly Rest: For, to this particular purpose is it, that he fetches
his proof out of that Psalm, confirming what he had said by the Testimony of
David, showing that the Psaimist by that Rest, could mean nothing else, and
nothing less, but the Spiritual, Eternal, heavenly Rest: there being no other
Rest left, out of which the unbelieving were threatened to be shut in that
Psalm, called so great a Salvation, in the third Verse of the second Chapter of
this Epistle: The Rest of the weekly Sabbath had been entered upon already; and
as for the Canaan Rest, that was some ages before David's Time, Heb. 4. 8. Act.
7. 45.
entered upon and into, by the surviving Israelites, under the leading of
Joshuah, or Jesus; or, if you will, of Jeshuang, or Jesus by Joshuah. Whereas,
the Rest promised here, in the first verse of the fourth Chapter, was such a
Rest, as Joshuah did not bring the Israelites into, in the eighth Verse, though
he led them into Canaan, the Type of it; as the causal conjunction does
evidently prove, which is an Answer to a tacit Objection, if any did say, that
Joshua had placed the Fathers in that Rest. As for that Canaan Rest, it was
actually possessed by David, and the Israelites of his Day: This Land of Canaan
is called the Land of Immanuel, Isai. 8. 8. that is of Christ, because it was a
sign of the Heavenly Inheritance obtained by Christ, Heb. 11. 9, 11. The Rest
therefore, that David speaks of, must be a Rest yet to come: (The other Rests
particularly mentioned having been already then entered into;) a Rest, which
they should fear, they might be shut out from, a Rest, not past, but yet to
come.

This Epistle speaks of Believers entering into this promised Rest, Heb. 4. 10.
after their working season is at an end; appears by comparing some Verse. 1, 2,
3, 9. and 11. with verse. 10.
Verses in this place together: at least, as to the full possession of that
Rest: If it should be pleaded by the Objectors, from Verse. 3. Mat. 11. 28, 29.
and John 3. 36. and 1 John 5. 12, 13.
one of the Verses compared with other Scriptures, that sound Believers do
actually enjoy some beginning of it here: this we are persuaded of, and
experienced Believers are supposed in Psalm. 116. 7. Heb. 12. 22, 23, 24. and
10. 34. 2 Pet. 1. 11.
Scripture, to have already somewhat of it, as well as to hope for more of it
here; and to believe, and expect their full everlasting possession of it in the
heavenly Glory, at the last, when they have here finished that Work which the
LORD sent them into the World to do: and this is their every days happiness,
more or less, as they more or less act as Believers. O how often may the Spirit
of a Believer be in the Heavenly Rest in one Day! He may get thither into this
Rest, in one Holy Thought: and how many of such thoughts may his thoughts be,
who thus does act Faith, Hope and Love aright, upon this Object! A sound
Believer should check himself under his divertisements from this Felicity,
Return, O my Soul, to thy-my-Rests: My Rests are thy Rests; thy Rests are my
Rests: Be friendly to me and to thy self: Sit down and silently Rest in Jehovah
Aelohim! There is an abundant entrance subministred to thee, to me, so to do!

This Epistle, in Heb. 4. 8.
one passage of this cited place do prove, that Jesus or Joshuah (For Joshuah,
or Jehoshuang, in the Syriack Language, and also by the Greeks, denotes a
Savior) had not then given them that Rest, spoken of in that Psalm. 95.
Psalm referred to: because then the Psalmist would not afterward have spoken
of another Day: and therefore that Rest which Joshuah or Jesus, or Jesus by
Joshuah set them in, was not this Rest it self, but a Type of this heavenly
rest to believers, for, many entered into Canaan, who never entered into Heaven.
Joshua had not given them that rest which is here spoken of; So that this
cannot be understood of the rest of the first day of the week, as the weekly
Sabbath Day, seeing the Objectors do affirm, though groundlesly, and but
pretendedly, that the Captain Jesus (of whom Joshuah was someways a Type:) gave
his Disciples this first day rest.

Heaven is in (...) Chron. 6. 41. Ps. 132. 8, 13, 14. Heb 3. 11, 18. and 4. 1,
3, 5, 9, 10, 11. Rev. 14. 13.
other Scriptures set out by the Name of God's Rest: This was Typified by the
Ark, and by the Temple, and by Canaan; and is plain enough spoken of in this
passage to the Hebrews. God's rest is in the highest Heavens, there is the
dwelling place of his Rest: There does Christ sit in Glory at the right hand of
his Father in full, perfect, happy Rest, where sound Believers also shall rest,
in, and with Him. For Heb. 4. 14.
a little after this passage we are told Christ's Rest is, in the Heavens, in
the highest Heavens, the Holy of Holies: So Heb. 9 24.
elsewhere in the same Epistle: We, says he, have a great High Priest who is
gone through into the Heavens, Jesus the Son of God: and therefore let us hold
fast our Christian profession: For, Christ is not entered into the Sanctuary
that is made with hands, which is an Antitype of the true, that is of the
Heavenly Sanctuary, which was Figured by the other, but into Heaven it self,
now to appear before the face of God for us, with full satisfaction made to the
Justice of his Father, by the Sacrifice of himself offered up to his Father,
and with prevailing Intercession for those whom the Father gave unto him. So
that, as Heb. 3. 11. 18. and 4. 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11.
his rest is diverse times mentioned in this Epistle; so also is Heb. 9. 24. and
10. 34. and 11. 16. and 12. 22, 23, 25.
Heaven often expressly mentioned, besides other words that do set it out: and
there is likewise Heb. 6. 19. 20. and 9 12, 21, 25.
the phrase of thus entering in, several times spoken of: All these in the same
Epistle; Heb. 9. 6, 7. and 10. 19 (compared with Levit. 16. 2, 3, 23.) Heb. 3.
1. and 6. 19, 20. and 9. 12, 24, 25. and 3. 11, 18, 19. and 4. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6,
11. and 10. 19. and 11. 15, 16. and 9. 6, 7. Heb. 7. 26. and 8. 1. and 6. ^0.
which was of old under the former ministration, typified by the High Priests
entering into the Holiest once every year: For, the High Priest also was in this
a Type of Christ; who is called the Apostle, and the High Priest of their
Profession, who are partakers of the Heavenly calling. So that, all these
expressions thus put together, which we do meet withal in the same Epistle do
best reconcile this sense, to the whole of the Epistle besides, and to other
Scriptures which do treat of the same Subject Matter, that, the entering in, the
Ingress into this rest, is the entering into the Heavenly rest above. Heb. 3. 1.
and 4. a. and 6. 19, 20. and 12, 22, 23, 24.
Some beginnings of which Heavenly rest Believers do enter into here, in that
holy Heavenly Fellowship which they have with Jehohah Aelohim in Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit, and with the living Members of Christ's mystical Body; Jesus
the forerunner being already entered into the innermost of the veil for them,
the Believers hope has a way of entering in there after him. We have Ordinances
now dispensed, with more clearness, Spirituality, and Heavenliness, then
Believers under the former Administration had, (though they also enjoyed the
same for sum, and for substance, yet under Types, Shadows, and Figures:) And
therefore they are called Heb. 3. 1. and 6. 4. and 8. 5. and 9. 23.
Heavenly things, which the pattern of Old did more darkly resemble. These are
not forced senses, and interpretations of my own, but such as are Natural and
Familiar, Plain and Obvious, and in the express Language and literal words of
the same Epistle.

Before I quite dismiss this about the rest, I am to write somewhat about the
significancy of the word Heb. 4. 9. (...) from (...).
Sabbatism. The Greek Noun is derived from a Verb, which does signific, I
Sabbatize, or I rest. The seventy two Greek Interpreters do use the Verb in
Lev. 26. 35.
one Scripture, where it does set out the rest of the Land every seventh year:
they use it also in Exodus 16. 30.
another place, where it is applied to the Seventh-day Sabbath, that being the
weekly Sabbatizing-day, or resting-day. The Greek Noun in the proper
significancy of the Word, is an actual or active resting or Cessation from
work, or labor, or from motion about such work, and labor as is rested from,
a Requietion, or Requiescence from this; This being used in the Greek of the
New Testament but once, the means to come to a right apprehension of the true
signification and the proper meaning of it in this place, will be to examine,
what the Original of this Greek Word is, in that Language from whence it is
borrowed in the Old Testament Hebrew; and what that word in the Hebrew Original
does contain and express in it; How that word is used in the Scriptures, from
whence this Greek Noun has its Origination, as also, what there is in the
Context of this place in this part of the Epistle to the Hebrews, about this
matter enquired after? What there is in that Psalm, referred to here in this
Epistle, that may bring some light to this matter? And what there is in the
Word of Christ about this Phrase of Sabbath-keeping or keeping a Sabbath, as
the Objector does render it.

It is not here unworthy of our noting, That, the Greek Tongue in a multitude
of Words has its Origination from the Hebrew Language: Its Alphabet and Letters
has its derivation from hence. What is its Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, but
Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth? the power and force, the virtue and value in the
sound for the manner of pronunciation is much the same: and As Erebos darkness,
from the Hebrew, Gnereb. Sophol from Sophim: Arrabon from Gnarbon. Momos from
Mum. Helios from Ael. Kadmos from Kadmon: Malchos from Molec; Ode from Odeth:
Scenoun from Shacan. Nosow: from Nosh. Lethein from Lut. and Lat. Meshane from
Mechaneh Tauros from Tormanie more might be added.
many particular words do in their very sound declare, though in some things
the Greek Tongue is defective, at least as now it is in use: particularly in
that it wants a Jod Consonant, as also in that it has not an H in the middle or
in the end of a word: which is the reason why we so seldom meet with the Word
of Words, Jehovah, or Jah, or Ehieh, in the Greek of the New Testament, though
the citations brought out of the Old into the New, have often the word Jehovah,
and Jah expressed. The Original of this Greek word Sabbatismos, or Sabbatism,
is from the Hebrew word Shabbaton, as the Greek Sabbaton is from the Hebrew
Shabath: The sound and the sense going together do enough speak this to every
intelligent Man's Ear: Thus in Chaldee, Syriack, and Arabic, Shebath is a
Sabbatism. Shabbathon, or Shabbaton, which is the Original of that Greek word
Sabbatismos, or Sabbatism, does sometimes set out the Exodus 16. 23.
Seventh-day Sabbath, or rest; which Seventh day is expressed by this word, as
one of its Names and Appellations by which it is called. Levit. 23. 24.
Sometimes the first day of the seventh Moon is expressed by this word: Levit.
25 4, 5.
at another time, the seventh year has that denomination: and Lev. 16. 29, 31.
the day of explation also, on the tenth day of the seventh Moon is so styled:
The reason whereof is, that these days and years were observed as Sabbaths,
when there was an Actual rest, a cessation from Work and Labor.

The Context in this place of this Epistle does evidence that what is expressed
by Sabbatism Heb. 4. 9. (...).
in one Verse, is in other Verses relating to the same matter, called hy Heb.
2. 11, 18. and 4. 1, 3, 10, 11. (...).
another word, which is a resting, reposing, a cessation, a rest from labor, a
ceasing from work: Which two words much denoting one and the same thing here,
rest, resting, Sabbatism, or Sabbatizing-rest, are both of them in this place
distinguished and severed Heb. 4. 4.
from the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, to be observed here now; Whereas the
other promised is yet remaining to be enjoyed.

This discourse being grounded upon the ninty fifth Psalm, it is observable,
that the word used there, in the last verse, is Menuchah, rest, quietness, a
quiet rest, an acquiescing from Nuach, he rested, he was quiet, he was at rest,
he acquiesced. A place of quiet, and of quiet rest, in that place of the Psalm,
is set out by that word Numb. 14. and Chron. 10. 33.
relating to a former passage in Moses time: The Land of Canaan was a place of
quiet rest, when peaceably possessed by the Israelites; And it was a Typical
Figure of the promised rest and Sabbatism mentioned in this place of this
Epistle: Menuchah, Ps. 95. 11.
Which word is applied to several other things besides the weekly Sabbath:
Deuteronomy. 12. 9.
As it is the word used, to set out the shadowy rest in the Land of Canaan: 1 Chronicles. 22. 9.
It is applied to a Man, a Man of rest: 1 Chronicles 28. 2.
It is attributed to an House, an House of rest: Psalm. 23. 2.
It is ascribed to Waters; Waters of rest, of rests: and to diverse things
distinct and different from the weekly Sabbath Day, or resting day, as such.

As for the phrase of keeping Sabbath, the Scriptures do usually add some other
word unto Sabbath, whereby to denote that expressiveness; Exodus 20. 8. and 31.
13, 16. Deuteronomy. 5, 12.
Such as, to remember a Sabbath Day; to this end of sanctifying it: To
sanctify a Sabbath, to keep Sabbaths, to do the Sabbath, and such like. And
some such phrases are applied unto somewhat else, besides the weekly
Seventh-day Sabbath: As Lev. 25. 2, 3, 4. and 26. 44.
to Sabbatize a Sabbath; which was on the seventh year: thus to enjoy, or to
accept, or to will Sabbaths, meaning the seventh years.

The next particular, which I expressed, that I would discover is, that, Heb.
4. 10.
the, He, mentioned in one passage of this part of this Epistle, is meant of
the Believer. The grounds why I so apprehend are as follow: Because

The tenth Verse of this fourth Chapter does resume that which was spoken of in
the third Verse: in both which there is express mention made of the same rest,
and of the same persons, in some of the same expressions, where believing ones
are said to enter into that rest: The, He, is every such He, as is believing,
and all such.

The ninth Verse is an inference from the sixth Verse, and it has respect unto
that: by a corollary he forces the remainingness of a rest to the people of
God. Which rest is defined in the tenth Verse by Believers cessation from his
works: and this Definition is Illustrated by a collation of the example of God,
who then rested when he ceased from his works. Seeing therefore, it remains
some to enter into that rest, there remains therefore a Sabbatism to the
people of God. It must evidently follow, that, seeing the unperswadeable ones,
to whom this was first Evangelized; (or to whom the Gospel was first preached,)
did not enter into the Typical rest of Canaan, therefore there is a rest yet
still behind, which the believing people of God have a promise of entering into,
in the first Verse: which is Typilied by that Prophetical word in the fifty
ninth Psalm: of which more in the next reason.

The Sabbatism, or rest spoken of, in the ninth and tenth Verses of this fourth
Chapter, is that which being Typified does answer directly unto the Type
thereof: This Type in the eleventh Verse of the nineth fifth Psalm, was the
Land of Canaan; which is called Deuteronomy. 12. 9, 10. 1 Chronicles. 23. 25.
a rest, out of which those of the Israelites who were twenty years old and
upward were shut, such as were Numb. 14. 24, 28, 29, 30. Heb. 3. 22. 19.
unbelieving, murmuring, and unperswadeable, who revolted from Jehovah Aelohim,
and in their heart returned back again into Egypt. Their evil heart of unbelief
made them depart from the living God: Those of them who were believing as
Caleb, and Joshuah, Numb. 14. 24. Deuteronomy. 1. 36. Joshua 14. 6, 7, 8. Numb. 32. 12.
Caleb has a remark of He, put upon him, as the He, eminently, that had another
Spirit with him, and that did fulfill after Jehovah Christ: and Numb. 14. 30.
and 32. 22.
Joshuah was another such He. These and such as these, did enter into that
Typifying rest; where, after they had driven out their Enemies, they enjoyed a
peaceable rest and a quiet safety. This Typical rest in the Land of Canaan, did
not Figure out a first day weekly Sabbath rest; into which day, as into a
resting day weekly, none of the Israelites, either unbelieving or believing did
enter upon, as an Hebdomadal. Sabbath: But it did Typifie that rest, in the
better, the Heb. 11. 9. 16.
Heavenly Country; as is expressed in this same Epistle; into which none do
enter but the believing: So that the, He, who entering into the rest of God, in
the tenth Verse, is any one of the Believing people of God, for whom the
promised Sabbatism was said to be remaining, in the words immediately
foregoing, in the ninth Verse; Which also the reason brought to prove the
soundness of the inference does show: The Illative particle, therefore, and the
comparative, like as, in the seventh Verse of the third Chapter, relating to
the twelfth Verse of the same Chapter, does show the exhortation to be enforced
upon the Believer, therefore as the Holy Spirit exhorts you to believe and
obey the Voice of Christ, so look to it, that you do believe and obey his
Voice; The reason is strong, from an example of old, because your Fathers who
contemned the Voice of Christ, and did not contemper the word with Faith, were
frustrated of the Heavenly rest: The reason of which consequence, is, seeing
there is the like reason of you and of them: For, both to you and them it was
Evangelized; in the second Verse of the fourth Chapter. The whole drift of the
Discourse from the seventh Verse of the third Chapter, to the eleventh Verse of
the fourth Chapter, does respect a professing people, that would pass for the
people of God, and be accounted Travelers toward the promised Heavenly rest,
which none but the believing perswadeable obedient true spiritual Israel of God
would enter into.

The Sabbatism or rest spoken of, in the first, third, ninth, tenth, and
eleventh, verses of this fourth Chapter, is a rest that remains; in the sixth
and ninth verses of the same Chapter: A rest that was before them, toward
which they were traveling, and short of which they should fear, lest they came
by their loytering behind; in the first Verse; A rest that in the time of the
Author of this Epistle, when he wrote this, was as to himself and the
believing people of God then alive, before them, and they were left behind it,
as yet short of it: Into which they were not as then so fully entered: but they
were under a promise or expectation thereof: And the same may be said of his
believing people, who are now alive in the present day, whilst it is called, to
day: There is a promised rest, which they should have in their eye, which they
are not as yet, so thoroughly passed into; Of which that place in the Psalm was a
Typical prediction. The rest here, is a rest yet in the promise, yet to come
and hoped for, attainable, enterable and enjoyable, if Heb. 4. 1, 9, 10, 11.
unperswadeableness hinder not. The Eleventh verse does again introduce and
enforce the principal exhortation by way of rational inferehee, and by a
doubled Argument: Therefore let us study to enter into that rest, that, not any
one sall by the same example of disobedience: If we believe and obey Christ's
Voice we shall then enter into it, but if not, we shall be shut out from it; as
those were who died away in their unperswadeableness. The whole Context, both
in this place, and in the Psalm, does evidently demonstrate, that, the rest
here treated of, and foretold by David, is such a rest, as out of which the
unbelieving, unperswadeable, and disobedient, living and dying such, would be
shut; and into which, the believing, perswadeable, and obedient, such a people
of God should enter; and none but such: Which therefore cannot be ineant of a
pretended first day of weekly rest. For, if that had been the rest, the
believing had already actually entered, into, not only the outward, but also the
inward rest: and even the unbelieving had actually entered into the outward part
of that rest; had they so far observed it as the weekly Sabbath: Whereas the
Israelites in Type in Moses's time, had not entered so much as into the outward
part of the Type of it: That is to say, not those of them who were above twenty
years of Age, when the Spies returned from searching the Land; All, except
Joshuah and Caleb, died short of Canaan, that were above that number of years,
whether Believers or unbelievers.

All the Promises, and the Threatenings, the Exhortations, and the Cautions, and
such like, that are made use of, in all Heb. 3. 7-19. and 4. 1-11.
this Discourse, do plainly relate to a prosessing people; according as they
believe, or believe not, and so do enter, or not enter, into this rest.

As for what does concern the parallel, wherein it does not hold, and wherein
it does hold, I shall open now my thoughts.

The Parallel here, is not between God the Father, as Creator, and his Son
Christ as Redeemer: (though there are some others that would have it so:) For
the LORD Jesus himself, the Christ, the Mediator, was the Creator: (not
excluding the Father, nor the Holy Spirit:) As I have proved Page 89. 90, 91,
92, 93.
before in this Treatise: and have here again put some of the Scriptures into
the John 1. 1, 2, 3, 10. and 5. 17, 19. 1 Cor. 8. 6. Ephesians. 3. 9. Col. 1. 16,
17.
Margin, which the Reader may examine, if he have need. The Author of this
Epistle does industriously prove and promote this great Truth, of Christ's
Jehovah ship, or God-ship, by his Creator-ship as well as by other Arguments
from Scripture. That God who is spoken of in the tenth verse of this fourth
Chapter of this Epistle to the Hebrews, is the same Christ, by whom the Father
made the Worlds, the Ages: He was the LORD in the beginning, who laid the
Foundation of the Earth and the works of whose hands the Heavens were: as is
declared in the second and tenth Verses of the first Chapter; the same God who
built all things, in the fourth verse of the third Chapter: Which does make way
for the following discourse, concerning his rest, and entering, or not entering
into it, as Christian Professors did believe and obey, or not; As this Objector
himself does elsewhere confess, upon the tenth Verse of the third Chapter:
that, Christ is so brought in as God, and expressly called God, to make way for
this following discourse about works and rest; The same God, whose voice from
his Father, by his Spirit in his Word, the Israelites of Old, and the Hebrews
in this Author's time were called upon to hearken unto, in the seventh, and
fifteenth Verses of that third Chapter. The same living God, from whom, they
should take heed, lest by an evil Heart of unbelief in them, they did depart in
the twelfth Verse: Which the Author does expressly interpret of Christ in the
fourteenth Verse, The same God, who was tempted, provoked, grieved,
disbelieved, by the Israelites in the Wilderness, in the eighth, ninth, tenth,
sixteenth, and seventeenth Verses of this third Chapter: which also is
confirmed 1 Cor. 10. 4, 9. Numb. 21. 5. Exodus 14 19. and 23 20 Isai. 03. 9.
compared.
elsewhere, in the Word; the same God who did rest the Seventh-day from all his
Works, which were finished from the foundation of the World; in the third and
fourth Verses of the fourth Chapter: The same God who has a people more
pecularly belonging unto him, in the ninth Verse: The same God whose Word is
quick and powerful, or living and active; and sharper than any two edged Sword,
piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul, and of Spirit, and of the
Joints, or Nerves, and Marrow, and is a critical discerner, or a Critic of the
imaginations and thoughts of the Heart; in the twelfth Verse: hold forth also
in Col. 3. 16. The Word is the Word of C^rill. Compire Rev. (...). 16. and 2.
12.
other Scriptures. The same God, who is the great high Priest of his People;
passed into the Heavens; (as into the full Rest;) Jesus the Son of God; in the
fourteenth Verse.

Neither is the parallel between the Works of the Father, and the Works of the
Son; as if they were such different Works, of a different Nature, and of
different Time: which was not the matter under debate, in the third and fourth
Chapters of this Epistle (as men have divided them;) the which what was
mentioned before does also discover; John 5. 17, 19.
For, what things soever the Father does, these also does the Son likewise.

Nor is the parallel between one Day of the Week, and another Day of the Week,
and the first Day of the Week, in the weehly Revolution. For the, to day,
mentioned in the Psalm, and the seventh Verse, does not point out the
particular first Day of the Week; as distinct from the others Days of the same
Week: As if the Exhortation did peculiarly, properly and openly, belong unto
that; but it takes in the whole of our Day and Time, wherein the sound of
Christ's Voice comes unto us; speaking by his Spirit in his Word from his
Father every Day of the Week; as appears from the thirteenth Verse of the third
Chapter. So that those expressions in the seventh and eighth Verses of the
fourth Chapter, which do speak of a certain day, and of another day, do set out
a large providential Day, a long time after the Israelites entering into Canaan,
the Land of Rest: The Rest spoken of in the Psalm, could not refer to this; or
the weekly Sabbath from the Worlds Creation; for these were before; whereas the
Psalmist does speak of a Rest that was future, and yet to come; as to those who
were then alive: As likewise it was to the Author of this Epistle, and to the
Believers in his Day and Time: It was remaining even then: A Rest, a Sabbatism;
which was not then by him, and those to whom he wrote, fully entered into,
possessed, and enjoyed: Though Believers, so far as they had their Citizenship,
their Burgeship, in Heaven and in the Spirit did converse with the glorious
Inhabitants of the New City, of that Heavenly Jerusalem, Heb. 12. 22, 23, 24.
and 4. 3, 9. Philip. 3. 20.
did pass into somewhat of it, and had some views and foretasts, some
beginnings and first fruits of it.

So that the parallel here, is between Rest and Rest: For as Jehovab Aelobim
the Creator, having finished his Works of the six foregoing Days in the first
Week of the Created World, did Rest on the Seventh-day Sabbath; and look, as
the Israclites did Rest in the Land of Canaan after their labor and travel,
when they had peaceable, quiet possession of that Land: So shall believers
also, when they have done their Acts 13. 22, 36.
Generation-work, and have finished the Rev. 14. 13.
Work of their Day and Time, in doing and in suffering the whole Will of our
LORD, have and enjoyed a Rest, a Sabbatism, which will be fully completed in
that better Heavenly Country.

And so also is the parallel, between entering, or not entering into the typical
Rest in the Land of Canaan: and entering, or not entering into that Rest which
was typified thereby: which was not a First Day Rest, as is pretended; but the
Heavenly, Eternal Rest. This parallel is held forth in the eleventh, eighteenth
and nineteenth Verses of the third Chapter, and in the first, third, sixth,
tenth and eleventh Verses of the fourth Chapter.

And the parallel further holds, between Believers and Unbelievers, in the
passage toward, or entrance, or not entrance into the Land of Canaan, the Land
of Canaan, the Land of Typical Rest, according as they were perswadable and
obedient, or not: And Believers, or Unbelievers, since the time of that Psalm
(which I therefore mention because it is the Foundation of the Discourse in
this place to the Hebrews, and particularly at the time, when the Author of
this Epistle did write, wherein all Ages since, and those after us are also
concerned:) For, even these also, according as they are found perswadable and
obedient, or not, so shall they, either enter into, or come short of, this
typified promised Rest. As it was in the Prophet David's time; the offer of
Grace, as to the Promised Rest was made to the Israelites (for this same Gospel
was published unto them under that Ministration of Grace, as unto us now, under
the present Dispensation of Grace, in the second and third Verses of the fourth
Chapter: The Doctrine of Salvation by Faith in the Messiah, being the Doctrine
in David's time, and in Moses Days, and long enough before him:) and those of
them, who were believing, obedient, and perswadable; in the sixth, and seventh,
and eleventh Verses of that Psalm. So that there was in part a fulfilling of
this in David's time, both as to the threatening part upon the unbelieving,
impenitent and disobedint, dying away such; and as to the promising part, as to
the believing, repenting, and obeying ones, who died Heb. 11. 13* 16.
in the Faith: And therefore, it cannot be understood of the First Day of the
Week, in opposition to the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, as is pretended: there
being nothing at all of any such observation of the First Day in David's time:
And the same Gospel was published unto those in the time of the Author of this
Epistle, in the second Verse, of the fourth Chapter; even as unto the
Israelites before: and it had a further fulfilling than in that Authors time,
in the third Verse of the fourth Chapter: and it still has and will have, as
the Exhortations do prevail; in the first, sixth, seventh, twelfth, thirteenth,
fourteenth and fifteenth Verses of the third Chapter; and the first, third,
eleventh, fourteenth and sixteenth Verses of the fourth Chapter.

The Works that Believers are said to Rest from, in the tenth Verse of the
fourth Chapter, are according to Scripture Phrase, and meaning Rev. 14. 13.
elsewhere, their labors. Believers shall Rest from their labors; from the
labors of their particular Functions and Callings, wherein they were exercised
in their life time here: and as for their labor in the LORD, whilst they were
here, in which time they did abound in the Work of their LORD; as also for
their labor of Love in all their suffering, as well as doing for Christ,
Believers will have satisfaction and complacency, sweetness and delight, in
such works as these are: though above, in the heavenly Rest, they will be
wholly for ever free from sufferings; as also from all corrupt mixtures and
defectivenesses, which were their sorrow, grief and trouble here, which they
much labored under: where the Tempter shall no more assault them. There is a
Rest promised to Believers, evidently and expressly, in the first, third, and
eleventh Verses of this fourth Chapter: (not now to mention other Verses in
this passage of this Epistle:) which the Objector does causlesly and
groundlesly controvert. And Rest is a cessation from such Labor and Work, as
into which that Labor and Rest does pass; which Rest in the better heavenly
Country, is so far from being unsuitable to the purpose of the Author of this
Epistle, that it is the main drift and scope of his arguing in the third and
sourth Chapters, to exhort the Christianized, professing Hebrews to take great
heed, lest they were shut out of it; by their unbelief, unperswadableness, and
disobedience, Heb. 4. 1, 3, 5. and 3. 18, 19. and (...). 10, 13, 14, 15, 16.
as the unbelieving, unperswadable and disobedient of old, amongst the
Israelities, did not enter into the Land of Canaan, which was a Type of this
Rest: The parallel of the, As, the Believers resting from his Works, as God
Christ, God man, rested from his Works, holds here exactly enough in the sense
of this Objector himself: For he affirms, that in the tenth Verse of the fourth
Chapter of this Epistle; and in his expression upon it, that the Works which
Christ did rest from, were all that he did and suffered from his Incarnation to
his Resurrection, as the Mediator of the Covenant; with all the Fruits, Effects
and Consequents of what he so did and suffered; as belong to these Works. And
so shall Believers Rest when they shall pass into Glory, from what they did and
suffered for Christ here. As Christ shall suffer no more, and dye no more; so
Believers shall suffer no more, dye no more; when once raised as Christ is
risen: As Christ so ceased from Working, as yet to continue the Work of his
Grace in the preservation of the New Creature, and orderly increase, and
propagation of it by the Spirit, so shall Believers so cease from this working
here, as yet to continue in the full supplies of the holy Spirit for ever, in
the acting of Grace, perfected in Glory, in the freest, largest exercising, and
putting forth thereof, according to the capacities and powers of the New
Creature, when thus growing up, to its well proportioned measure of a perfect
man: keeping the New Creature by a Power received from Christ, in its due
order, and putting it forth to the Glory of Jehovah Aelohim. As Christ so
Rested from his Works, as to take Refreshment in his Works, to have
satisfaction and complacency in them, as those which did set forth his praise,
and did satisfy his glorious design: Thus Believers so far are delighted with
what they have done and suffered for Christ, as the Father is delighted and
pleased in what his holy Spirit through Christ has in wrought in them, and
enabled them to Work for the setting forth of his Praise, and for the promoting
of his Glorious Design in the World, whilst they were in it: and so far they
were conformed here to Christ in their doing and suffering here for Christ, who
will be their Eternal Righteousness, even in Glory, though they own nothing in
any, or in all their own Works as Meritorious of Reward, or satisfactory to
Divine Justice, these being the Works of Christ, the Mediator by his alone
All-suffering Sacrifice. So that here is a fair apt resemblance, as to Works,
and as to Rest. They do answer each other, so far as Believers have a capacity
in a way of similitude: And this kind of doing, and of suffering, does last as
long as a Believers life does last, even upon the Seventh-day Sabbath, in their
weekly Returns, according to the Duties of those Days (as Christ's doing and
suffering, did last as long as his life did last, even upon the Seventh-day
Sabbath.) There is a Sabbath-service, which a Believer is to do for Christ, in
Obedience to his Command: and men of persecuting spirits, will be laying on of
crosses upon the Believer, for his thus keeping the Seventh-day Sabbath holy to
Jehovah; though a Believer will rejoice in such sufferings for Christ. Only
here the Reader may take notice, that this Objector does lay the foundation of
his Sabbatizing, on the Morning of the First Day of the Week, when he
supposes, that Christ by his then first rising from the dead, did lay and
perfect the Foundation of the New Creation: I desire that this may be
considered; How can a serious inquiring spirit be satisfied from the Objectors
arguing concerning a Weekly-day of Rest, or Sabbath, from Sunrising to Sunset
of that First Day, by an Argument drawn from Christ's ceasing from his Works of
Redemption on that Morning, as he affirms; when withal, he does acknowledge,
that Christ works did continue from his Inearnation to his Resurrection,
without any interruption, never ceasing from it all the First Days of his Life?
Can a weekly half-day of resting from work be demonstratively enforced upon a
rational intellect from three and thirty years continued working without any
cessation from that working? (For, that is the shortest time assigned to
Christ's abode here on Earth: though some do reckon more years than three and
thirty.) The Creation of the World was finished in six Days, which did lay the
foundation of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, both in Word and Nature, to
continue every Week: As a Law, Rule and Pattern for man's working the six
foregoing Days, and for his resting on the Seventh, which is the last Day of
the Week: Whereas now, this Objector would urge upon our consciences a weekly
observing of half a Day, as a weekly Day of Rest or Sabbath, from a continued
Work, thirty years outright, if not more.

(...).
The Conjunction, For, in the tenth verse of the fourth Chapter comes next to
be searthed into. This word does set out a further Reason of the Conclusion,
which the Author of this Epistle had drawn from that Psalm: and the Parallels
which I mentioned before, which was in the Sixth and Ninth Verses of the fourth
Chapter, that there was yet remaining a Sabbatism for the people of God: For as
God did work, and then Rested from His Labors, so must Believers work here;
which when they have finished, they also shall Rest from their Labors. For, is
a word which has such a Syllogistical sense, by which often So Mar. 15. 14. 1
Cor. 4. 4. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 14. 1 Cor. 7. 19. Gal. 2. 6.
the Reason of a thing is rendered by a Causal Rationality: As also in other
Languages There are such In Hebrew, (...) and (...) So in Latin, Quare,
quamobrem, quapropter, ergo, ideo, igitur, idcirco, quo cirea, itaque.
Conjunctions Rational. Sometimes it sets out such a Probation, as is by way of
Special Declaration of that which before was spoken of, in a more general
position; other times it is a rational transition of another Member, of two, or
of more things propounded: Sometimes it is a rational repeating of a Sentence,
begun a little before; and it does absolve and complete it, though by another
manner of Speech; to mention no more: Still it is a Rational: All which do well
agree here. The Believing Israelites had their Work and Labor, and then their
Rest ensued thereupon, when they entered into the Typical Land of Promised Rest,
and quietly enjoyed it when they had subdued their Enemies: And so shall
Believers, after their Working-Labouring-Season is over here, enter into that
Promised Rest, of which the other was a Type. So did Believers Heb. 11. 13
(...) 16.
who died in the Faith, under the Old Testament-dispensation of Grace: So do
Believers now, who so live, and so die: And so will Believers in the Ages after
us.

As for the Import of the change of the Number from the Plural to the Singular,
which the Objector would fetch about to his own purpose thus: The Apostle,
says he, here changes the manner of his Expression from the Plural
absolutely, We who believe; or virtually in the name of a Multitude, The people
of God; into that which is absolutely singular, (...)
He that is entered: A single person is here expressed; One, on whose Account
the things mentioned are asserted. And of this Change of phrase there can no
reason be given, but only to signify the Introduction of a singular person.
Thus he.

To this I reply that other Reasons may be clearly assigned from the Context
for that Change of Phrase, and yet the same kind of persons be expressly meant,
with respect unto whom the things mentioned are asserted; as I have already
shown to be the meaning of this place: Gal. 6. 1,
and other Scriptures compared, do well agree in the like use of such a Phrase,
where the same persons or things spoken of are sometimes expressed in the
Plural Number, and sometimes in the Singular. Take some few Instances: That
which in the fourth Chapter of this Epistle, and fourth Verse is, And He Rested
This God in that Day, that Seventh, (so significantly by a double Article is
that Seventh-day Sabbath pointed out, as I have observed, to be that particular
day, the last day of the Week from the Creation, to be the Weekly Sabbath Day:
It is not One day in Seven, not a Seventh part of Time; but That Seventh:) From
All those Works of Him, or of His. See here; It is Works, in the Plural. Genesis
2. 2.
This in another place, to which it does manifestly refer, is thus expressed;
And He did perfect (or finish) Aelohim, (a word also Plural in the Hebrew,
whereas God in the Greek is Singular;) in a day. This Seventh His Work (Work in
the Singular Number) and He did Sabbatize in a day, That Seventh, from all His
Work, (Work again in the Singular Number, though with a Collective Particle)
which He had made. Compare. 2 Chronicles. 6. 28, 34. with 1 King. 8. 37. and Mat.
13. 35. with Psalm. 78. 2. and 2 Chronicles. 23 9. with 2 King. 11. 10. and 2 Chronicles.
9. 21. with 1 King 10. 22. and 1 Chronicles. 11. 4. with 2 Samuel 5. 6. and 1 Samuel 31.
1. 1 Chronicles. 10. 1. and 2 King. 21. 6. with 2 Chronicles. 23. 1. See also Psalm. 25.
32. Deuteronomy. 29. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
Jebusites Plurally in one place, is Jebusite Singularly in another place:
Enemies Plurally in one Scripture, is Enemy singularly in another Scripture. If
the Reader have a Will to be further satisfied by more particulars about this,
let him examine and compare what places I have referred him unto in the Margin;
where the two last cited Scriptures do show, that Israel, a Word Singular, may
have with it a Word Singular or Plural. Where Thou is All, and every one of
such there spoken to; as to one Man, because every man particularly was
concerned in what all of them did there. We have more Instances in this
Epistle, and that particularly in this passage of it, which does relate to the
matter in hand: What in the eighth Verse of the third Chapter is Hearts in the
Plural Number, is in the eighth Verse of the ninety fifth Psalm, out of which
it is taken, Heart in the Singular Number: So what in the ninth Verse of the
third Chapter of this Epistle, is Works, in the Plural Number, is Work, in the
Singular Number, in the ninth Verse of that Psalm. Elsewhere, Deuteronomy. 7. 10.
the Singular Number does in the same Verse follow presently upon the Plural
Number; Jehovah the Aelohim of his people, repayeth them that hate him unto his
faces, to destroy him: He will not delay to him that hates him; unto his
faces, he will repay him. Him, that is, every one of such who hating him. Genesis
12. 5. and 15. 20, 21. Exodus 3. 8. and 23. 23. Genesis 3. 2, 7. (and 4. 20. Him
who dwelling or setting does take in every such one.)
The Singular Number where it has a comprehensive significancy, does in diverse
Scriptures take in more, Plurally. As Soul, Singularly, which does comprehend
more Souls Plurally. Thus Tree singularly does take in Trees plurally. So does
leaf in the singular number, comprehend leafs, in the plural number. Where all
the rest are of the same kind and Nature, one is mentioned, when more are
included: It does take in every such one. And thus it is in this tenth Verse of
the fourth Chapter, which is now under examination: He, who entering into Rest,
is such an one as is a Believer in the third Verse; he, whoever he be; that
believingly-perswadedly-obediently, hearkeneth unto Christ's Voice: All and
every of such as are the people of God in the special sense, spoken of
immediately before, in the ninth Verse, there is yet remaining, or left-put-off
for a time, a Sabbatism, (...).
to the people of God. The Word in the Greek is singular, yet of plural
signification; as it is also in our English Tongue: and then follows the O,
taking in the Relative etc.
Article, he in the singular number whoever he be of that number of the people
of God in the special sense. The same there is in Mat. 4. 16. (...).
another Scripture, the people (the same Word singular in the Greek, and in the
English, yet of plural signification:) who sitting in darkness (who sitting, is
singular number, yet also of plural comprehensiveness) and the He, in this
place to the Heb. 4. 9, 10.
Hebrews does emphatically note, and point out those excelling ones, that
excelling one, and every such excelling one, as are of such another singular
Spirit, as Joshuah and Calob were, who entered into the Type of Rest; and after
death, into the Typified, Spiritual, Eternal, Heavenly Rest, having finished
after Jehovah Christ, in their life time. All and every such as are Believing
ones, and of this people of God, who alone, they, and all they, every one of
them; they only, and none else but they, shall enter into this promised Rest.
Heb. 3. 18, 19. and 4. 11.
As for others, such as are unbelieving, disobedient, and unperswadable, they
living and dying away such, will come short of that Rest. Jer. 30. 22. and 31.
1, 33. and 32. 38. Ezekiel. 11. 20, and 34. 30, 31. and 36. 28. and 37. 23. 27.
Hos. 2. 23. Zach. 2. 11. and 8. 8. and 13. 9. 2 Cor. 6. 16. Heb. 8. 10. Revel.
21. 3. 7. compare Isai. 28. 16. with Rom 9. 33. and 10. 11. compare also John
6. 47. Mar. 16. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 6. 1 John 5. 5, 10. John 3. 16. and 12. 16. Acts
10. 43.
He that does desire more Scriptures about this, may consult those in the
Margin; where what is spoken plurally is applied singularly; and what is
expressed singularly does refer to all and to every such one, plurally. Thus,
he that believes on Christ in one Scripture, is whosoever believes on him in
another Scripture: This universal, whosoever, does expound the indefinite, He:
that is, every One, every such One; he of such, whosoever he be. As also, He,
in some Scriptures is interpreted and expounded by whosoever in other
Scriptures.

As for what this Objector does say, that the Rest, which this person is said
to enter into, is called his Rest absolutely: Whereas, the Rest which Believers
are said to enter into, is either called God's Rest, or Rest absolutely, but
not their Rest, or our Rest.

If this be admitted, that the Rest here, be the Rest of him who is the Author
of it, the, He, who is entering into it, is not meant of the Believer: For the
same Rest, which is the Authors Rest, is also the Rest of the Believer, of
every Believer. This Sabbatism is Heb. 4. 9.
to the people of God, it belongs to them; there are the Subjects, or the
persons to whom this Rest is Verse 1.
promised. Jehovah Christ has pursued this Rest for such, and promised this
Rest to such; and when they enter into it, it is theirs in more actual fullness:
They possess it, they enjoy it as their own. As the Land of Canaan, which was
the Type of this Rest, was Jehovah Aelohims, to promise it, and to give it to
his Israel; yet withal, it was the Israelites, called therefore Genesis 48 21.
the Region of the Fathers of the Israelites, and the Genesis 40. 15.
Land of the Hebrews: The place which Heb. 11. 8, 9.
Abraham was to receive for an Inheritance: The Lament. 5. 2.
Inheritance of the Jews. If there were need to to heap together many
Scriptures about this, how often is it set out by the Land of Promise, or the
promised Land; or the Promises; Or the Land, which Aelohim swear to give to
Abraham, to Isaae, to Jacob; which Aelohim gave to his people for a possession;
and such like. Exodus 15. 17. Lev. 20. 24, Deuteronomy. 3. 18. and 13. 9. 1 King. 8.
36. Psalm. 68. 9. and 79. 1 King. 8. 36. Psalm. 68. 9. and 79. 1. and 135. 12.
Isai. 49. 8. 63. 17. and 65. 9. Jer. 2. 7. and 12. 14. and 16. 18. and 50. 11.
Deuteronomy. 12. 9, 10. (1 Chronicles. 23 25. 1 King. 8. 56.)
And this Canaan was also called, The Inheritance of Aelohim: This is called
the place of Rest: Jerusalem was more especially the Rest, there. More expressly
yet, it is said concerning the Typical Land, that Canaan, and the Rest there,
was a Type of this promised Rest; in this place to the Hebrews, brought out of
the ninty fifth Psalm, that this Land should enjoy her Sabbaths; and that, this
Land should Lev. 26. 34, 33, 43.
Rest, and enjoy her Sabbaths: Whereas, it did not so Rest in their Sabbaths,
(your Sabbaths, they were theirs:) when the sinning Israelites dwelt upon it.
So also they are called Lev. 26. 43: 2 Chronicles. 36. 21.
her Sabbaths or Rests: The Sabbaths of that Land, when it was every seven
years to have rested from Tillage, and such Labor and Work: And again, Lev.
23. 32.
your Sabbaths, Your, Ye shall Rest your Sabbaths; speaking of the Typical
Expiation-day-Sabbath, it was their Rest. Thus of Jerusalem; of the Inhabitants
thereof, the Jews who had dwelt there: It is said of them under their
Babylonish Captivity, that Lam. 17. Hos. 2. 11.
The Adversaries did mock at her Sabbaths: Her: the like is elsewhere: I, says
Jehovah, will make to cease her Sabbath; Her: Lev. 25. 4, 5. Deuteronomy. 3. 20. and
12. 9, 10. and 25. 19. Josh. 1. 13. and 14. 15. and 21. 44. and 22. 4. and 23.
1.
So that the Scriptures do affirm, that the Rest or Sabbath was that Land's own
Rest; and it was the Israelites own Rest, given of Jehovah. Psalm. 132. 81, 4.
And it is called Jehova's Rest too; This is my Rest, whatever this Objector
does suggest to the contrary. And as for the beginnings of this Rest here,
Believers have and enjoyed it as theirs. Thus the Psalm. 116. 7. Jer. 6. 16.
Mat. 11. 28, 29.
Psalmist bespeaks his soul, My soul return unto Thy. My Rest. It was his
soul's, and so his own Rest; And thus in the New Testament, comers to Christ do
find Rest to their Souls: It is their Souls Rest: A Rest given to them of
Christ, Who is gone before to His Father's House, to prepare Mansions for His
through Disciples, there, in their Resting Place, which He has taken Actual
Possession of in their Name; that He and they may be together in Holy, Happy
Rest. In the mean while He has given and left His Peace with them, that their
hearts might Rest in Him; and when their time is come, they shall Rev. 14. 13.
Rest from their Labors with Him in Glory. And now let the Reader, with me,
make out after this remaining Sabbatism, that this Promised Rest may be ours,
that we may not so much as seem to come short of it. Then and there will be a
Sabbatizing, a ceasing as from much other Labor and Work, so from these
Strifes and Disputations: The perfectly sanctified Spirit of Just men will come
fully home to its Rest; sitting down in Glory; enjoying Christ, and Rest in
Him. O the Blessedness of such! O happy we! and O happy our Progresses, our
goings on with a straight foot toward this! if we be such believing, obeying,
perswadable ones as shall enter into this Rest!

If the Reader be one who has met with this Objector's arguing against the
Seventh Day Sabbath, it may be he would willingly have somewhat returned in
Answer yet further, unto some Grounds, on which that learned Adversary does lay
the pretended change of the Weekly-Sabbath-Day, from the Seventh to the First
day: I shall therefore transcribe what is written about this.

God, says he, had of old determined the Renovation of All, by a new Creation,
a new Law of that Creation, a new Covenant, and a new Sabbatical Rest, unto His
own Glory by Jesus Christ. The Renovation of all things by Jesus Christ is
prophesied of, and foretold, as a new Creation of All; even of the Heavens, and
of the Earth, and all things contained in them; Isai. 65. 17, 18. and 66. 22. 2
Pet. 3. 13. Hence the State of things to be introduced thereby, was under the
Old Testament called, the World to come; Heb. 2. 5. In the Prophety of the New
Temple or Church State in those Days, there is Especial Direction given for the
Service of the Sabbath Day, Ezekiel. 46. 4. This Renovation of all things is said
accordingly to be accomplished in Christ; 2 Cor. 5. 17, 18. Old things are
passed away; Behold, all things are become New: The Old Law, Old Covenant, Old
Worship, Old Sabbath; all that was peculiar unto the Covenant of Works, as
such, in the first Institution of it and its renewed Declaration on Mount
Sinai; all are gone, and antiquated. The Moral Law, materially the same, is now
the Rule of our Obedience; not merely and absolutely unto God, as the Creator,
the First Cause and Last End of All; But as unto God in Christ, bringing of us
into a New Relation unto Himself, There is now a New Covenant, part of the New
Creation: Jerem. 31. 32. Heb. 8. 9. No man can assert the same day of Rest,
precisely the Seventh-Day, to abide as of old; but he must likewise assert, the
same Law, the same Covenant, the same Rest of God, the same way of Entering into
it; which yet, as all acknowledge, are changed. On this we lay the Observation
of the LORD's Day under the New Testament, or a new Work of Creation, Isai. 65.
17. and 66. 22, 23. 2 Pet 3. 13. Rev. 21. 1. Romans 8. 19, 20. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Gal.
6. 15. Or a Work of new Creation is undertaken and completed. This new
Creation is accompanied with a new Law, and a new Covenant or the Law of Faith,
and the Covenant of Grace, Romans 3. 27. and 8. 2, 3. 4. Jer. 31. 32, 33, 34.
Heb. 8. 8-13. Unto this Law and Covenant, a day of Holy Rest unto the LORD,
does belong, which cannot be the same day with the former, no more than it is
the same Law, or the same Covenant which were Originally given unto us, Heb. 4.
9. Rev. 1. 10. This Day was limited and determined to the first day of the
Week, by our LORD Jesus Christ. Thus this Objector.

In my reply to this, after two premises, I am to show that this new Heaven,
and this new Earth spoken of in Prophetical Scripture; This Renovation by a new
Creation; is not so finished and completed, but that it is yet to come, in the
largest fulfilling and accomplishing of it. That, there was a Covenant of Grace
under the Old Testament Administration; that, the new Worship was Typically
signified in the figuring pattern of old: That the Law of Faith was a Law under
the Old Testament dispensation: That, the old Law of the ten words, is still
the same: It was the rule of obedience to them under the Old Testament, as unto
God in Christ, and is still so a rule unto us under the New: And then let me be
discharged from this Scholastic War.

Let this be one premise (which is several times in short expressions, here and
there in this Treatise:) That, it is a choice privilege and a special liberty,
which Believers do enjoy under the New Testament Administration of Grace: Gal.
5. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Christ profits them nothing by his coming in the Flesh, (born of the Virgin
Mary to accomplish and to perfect the Types of old, which did so set out his
thus coming) who keep themselves still under the former dispensation of Types,
Shadows, and Figures: We thankfully acknowledge to the Honor of our LORD that
gracious administration especially now toward the latter-day glory of it, that
we are brought under, which if compared with the former, under the Old
Testament, as to the different manner of dispensing; (For otherwise, we are to
discover in it is place, that, the Christian Religion is one and the same for
Doctrines, Duties, Gifts, Graces, Privileges, under both) has excelling
advantages; such as these for the measures, and for the degrees of them; It has
more 2 Cor. 3. 3, 6. John 10. 10. Ezck. 47. 9.
lively efficaciousness, more quick sensible Fellowship: 2 Cor. 3. 15, 16, 18.
Dan. 12. 4. Isa. 119. Hab. 2. 14. Jer. 31. 34. Isa. 54 13. John 6. 45. Heb. 8.
11.
It has more clear convincing Light, and more abounding spreading knowledge:
And blessed be Jehovah, who is in this providential day, clearing up and
reviving some too long neglected Truths and Duties! amongst some others, this
about the weekly Seventh day Sabbath. Ephesians. 3. 2. John 1. 16, 17.
It has more manifested Grace: 2 Cor. 3. 8, 17, 18. Phil. 3. 3. John 4. 23, 24.
It has a more spiritual way of Worship: It has a more 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10,
11; 18. Isa. 60, 1, 2, 21. Mat. 3. 12.
excelling Holiness, refined purity, and shining Glory; having through the
Spirit, who is the LORD, more power to transform into this, those who with
unveiled Face do look into this Glass: 2 Cor. 3. 17.
It has more enlarged liberty of heart, in the way and service of the LORD:
Ephesians. 3. 2-10. 2 Cor. 3. 18.
It has more of self evidencingly revealed mysteries: Mat. 21. 43. Mark 12. 34.
1 Pet. 2. 9. John 3. 3, 5. Mat. 18. 1, 3, 4. and 5. 19, 20. and 11. 11, 12. and
13. 11, 24, 31, 33, 44, 45, 47, 52. and 20. 1. and 22. 2. and 25. 1. Heb. 8. 5.
and 9. 23.
It has more Royal privileges, set out therefore by a Kingdom of God, and of
Heaven: And the things of it are called Heavenly things. This is meant of a
Church State here on Earth: For, above, in the Heavenly glory, there are no
unfruitful ones, no Tares, no Scandals, no Doers of Iniquity, no bad Fish, no
foolish ones? This New Testament Church State has the name of a Kingdom of
Heaven, as it does much resemble that glorious Kingdom which is above in
Heaven, in its way of Government: In its order of subjection, in its sights of
Faith, in its enjoyments of Communion, in its service of Delight, and in its
conformity of Holiness: Here these are in growingness of measure; There they
are in fullness of Perfection. This new Church State has much brought down from
Heaven to it; Such, as are gracious visits from Jehovah-Aelohim, in Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, Angelical Ministry, like-affectionedness of the perfectly
sanctified spirits of just Men, and Heavenly Messengers with the Everlasting
Gospel. This new Church State is drawn up to be much in the Spirit in Heaven
above, by joint unions; By mutual Fellowships: and it does believe and expect a
new Heaven, and a new Earth, and a new City, where they shall be all (the
Saints and Believers both of Old and New Testament:) together with one another,
and with the elect Angels, and with their LORD to hidden Age, ever as yet. Thus
it grows up into a Spiritual Kingdom. How large and delightful a Field is here
for Heavenly Meditation! The manner of administering is not now, by obscure
Types, and by darkish shadows, as of old, but without a veil, and open faced:
yet Christ is the substance of both the Old and the New Testament; the same
promises and rewards of Life everlasting were in this Christ, and purchased by
him: and there was one way and the same mean of receiving of this under both:
which was Faith in the Messiah: The difference that is between the Old and the
New does discover it self in the Form of dispensation; which had a diversity
for the manner of it, in the Old from the New: But this made no real specific
difference or change in the essentials of the Christian Religion. Under the
Old, Believers had an eye toward a Messiah, who was then to come in the Flesh
to be born of a Virgin; and so they eyed the Pattern, and Propheties, and
Promises, looking for the coming Christ: What were all the Figures and Types,
the Rites, and Shadows, but confirmers of their Faith in, and encouragers of
their hope of, Christ's coming? In the New, we have it revealed, that Christ is
now actually already come, to accomplish those Types, and to perfect Salvation
by his personal Sacrifice. The Reader may therefore be well satisfied in this,
that, our pleading of the cause of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, as it has
no tendency in it self, so no design in me; To cast any back, or to hold any
under the Old Testament Administration, as to the Types, Shadows, and Figures,
of it; much less to draw off, or to thrust back any from coming into, and
enjoying of New Testament privileges.

I shall not say that it was the Objectors intended aim, but it is evidently
consequential from his manner of discourse; that, his Lines about this, would
secretly insinuate into the Reader of them, as if the Assertors and Observers
of the weekly Seventh day Sabbath did Apostatize into Judaic ceremonies: I have
here another opportunity to wipe off a slanderous charge which some have
brought in against us; as if we stood guilty according to those two Scriptures
in the Gal. 4. 9, 10. Col. 2. 8, 18, 17.
Margin, of catching at the shadow, and letting go the body. Let it be granted,
that the Elements, Rudiments, or first beginnings, mentioned in that place of
the Epistle to the Gal. 4. 9.
Galatians, are the Mosaical Rites, ceremonial Laws, and shadows of a Christ,
who under that dispensation was then to come, to be born of a Virgin; but is
now already come, so born: This then does show, that, the Apostle condemns
their superstitions observing, or their keeping besides Right and Equity, (as
that (...)
word which they tranflate, ye observe, does signify when taken in an ill
sense:) Especially when it was with an opinion of acceptance and justification
in the sight of God thereby, such, either un-Scriptural days, as were never
instituted by Jehovah. Christ; or Scriptural days in an un-Scriptural manner.
This were a foul matter of sinful Fact, sharply to be reprehended: As when
either the right object, a God in Christ, is not worshipped; or when for the
matter of observing, it is not New Testament Worship: Or when for the Form of
observing of Times and of Worship, there was not an orderly address unto
Jehovah Aelohim: To the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit, in a word
way; not in a spiritual manner; not from inward principles of new Nature, of
Faith, of Love, and of Obedience: or when the ends of observing of Days and
Times were not right ends: when the Gospel designs of humbling, emptying, and
abasing of Man, and of exalting and glorifying of a God in Christ, were not
promoted thereby: when there was a carnal compliance either with old Judaizers,
or with superstitious Pagans, who had added diverse of their own Ethnic corrupt
mixtures of Idolatrous Worship, which they gave to Sun, Moon, and Stars; By the
course and motion whereof, Days, Times, Moons, and Years were measured. Gentile
Philosophers having parcelled out the power of the only true God, into the
particular virtues of Elements and Creatures; As the Lights in the Heavens,
Fire, Water, and Earth; ascribing some portion of Deity to every one of these:
and so assigning a part of the Worship of God, unto them, too: appointing times
and seasons for their superstitious service. These practices are blame worthy.
This were to go back either to the Old Testament dispensation, or to return to
their former Heathenish Rites, which is three times rebuked and reproved, What?
Again? Again? Backward? But what is all this to the standing Law of the Seventh
day Sabbath, kept in an Holy Spiritual manner, in obedience to Jehovah's
command, according to his Word Institution? This is a matter of a distinct
Nature from the other; being a Law of another kind. So, that to lay aside all
instituted natural seasons of Worship, such as daily Evening and Morning
Worship, and weekly Sabbath Worship, as some would infer from this place, is in
the issue to open a backdoor for the main of Religion, to be turned out at;
and to enforce it as others do from hence and from Romans 14. 5, 6.
one Scripture more, which they also wrest to the like wrong ill purpose, as if
it mattered not what day of the Week were kept; or whether any day, or no day
at all: So both were done to the LORD: and we were now under no such particular
Law. This were to open a Gap to all superstition and profaneness: or to urge
it, as if we were now under no obligation of one special day in a Week: but
must keep every day of the week as Sabbath, as some others. Which is quite
contrary to the whole Scripture, and to the Word and Nature of a Sabbath Day:
Which is a cessation from the ordinary labor, a resting from the common work,
of our particular Functions (which to do on every day of the Week, were a sin,
expressly against the Letter of the Law of the fourth word, which does command
us to work six days:) To spend the day in the Instituted work of Jehovah
Aelohim; This, under a pretense of being always in a Sabbath, is to mislead
them, to be never in a Sabbath: Or, as other some, to plead from hence, that,
they may keep both first day, and Seventh-day too, as Sabbaths every week, this
also is directly against the precept; For, we must work the six foregoing days
of the Week, and rest on the Seventh. We do declare against all and every of
these mistakes and miscarriages both in principle and in practice: in
whomsoever they are found. Paul is supposed by these Objectors, to speak
against the observing of that which comes under the expression of weak and poor
Rudiments, Elements, or first beginnings: Whereas the ten Words are not such.
These are James 2. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
a Kingly Law, Obedience to these, is the Liberty of Children, whereas
subjection to the other in comparison of this was sometimes Gal. 4. 3. Romans 8.
15.
the Bondage of Servants. The ten Words are a Kingly Law of Liberty. If it be
objected, that, the Typical, Figuring, shadowy part annexed of old to the
Seventh-day Sabbath, to be then observed, such as the two He-Lambs, and such
like, was a part of these weak and poor Rudiments; We acknowledge that these
have received their perfection and accomplishment in Christ now come, born of a
Virgin. So that, in this See the Marginal Note on Col. 2. 16. in the English
Bible.
part, which was Typically superadded, we are not now so to observe the weekly
Seventh-day Sabbath; by such Types and Figures: but after that glorious,
spiritual, Heavenly manner as becomes those who are under this New Testament
dispensation: and thus to keep it, is no bondage to a renewed Heart: The more
excelling in Knowledge, in Grace, and in Experience, that any is, the more free
will they be to this; when once they are led aright into it. Let that therefore
which Gal. 4. 12.
Paul says in the twelfth verse, be considered here: Be ye as I am, for I have
been as ye are: As if he had said, I was once superstitious, whilst a Pharisee,
fond of un-Scriptural Traditionary seasons, days, and observances, or an
observer of Scriptural times and institutions in an un-Scriptural un-Spiritual
manner as ye; but now I bring all to a Word-Rule, and so should you. If the
Reader do diligently observe it, in his going over of this Epistle, he may
find, the Law of the ten words established, as a rule of Life, in the whole of
it, and by enumeration and induction in several particular commands of it:
though withal he set out the different manner of dispensing of Grace under the
Old and New Testament. This improved and applied might also be an answer to
that part of the Objection, which is formed from wresting that other place to
the 2 Col. 2. 8, 16, 17.
Colossians. The great drift, scope, and design, of the Apostle in this second
Chapter, is See Verses, 1. 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 19.
to set up and establish Jesus Christ as Head, LORD, Lawgiver, and the great
Exemplar. Contrary unto which amongst others were these great opposers, the
maintainers and defenders of corrupt Philosophy, whereby ver. 8. 18.
some did endeavor to make a prey of Souls, through affectation of humane
Wisdom, and vain deception according to the Tradition of Men, according to the
Elements of the World, and not according to Christ. ver. 20. 21, 22, 23.
Another sort of Adversaries, were the Advocates for humane Inventions, the
pleaders for the institutions and impositions of Men besides and against the
Scriptures of Truth in the matters of Faith and of manners, of Doctrine,
Worship, Discipline, Government and Conversation, they were Will-worshippers:
Some others there were who were hot contenders for the keeping up of such
Ceremonies, as were once Shadows and Types of a Christ, who was then to come to
be born in the flesh of a Virgin. These Typical Institutions were perfected in
Christ, when he thus came: These shadows now passed into the body and substance
of them. Believers were now complete in their Head Christ, in the tenth Verse;
and had the true grace of what was under Types and Shadows before, in the
eleventh and twelfth verses. That Chirograph by Rites which before they had as
it were written, exhibited, signed, sealed and delivered, was now blotted out
or cancelled; Which before was their act and deed: in the fourteenth and
fifteenth Verses. As for what they object, that two He-Lambs of the first year
perfect, were an annexed part of the worship on the Seventh day Sabbath; and
two tenth parts of fine flower for a Meatoffering, mingled with Oil, and the
Drink offering thereof; the Burnt-offering of the Sabbath in his Sabbath: As if
therefore the Sabbath too were to be laid aside with these: If there were any
force in this arguing, then we should lay aside all Religion and Worship: For,
what was there under that former dispensation, which some way or other had not
some Figures and shadows annexed to it? There was blood of a Bull sprinkled on
the Altar, Christ: and the Book of the Covenant it self: and what? shall we
therefore lay aside Christ and his Book? The particular commands of the ten
words had some Types and Figures annexed to them: Doctrines, Duties, Graces,
and Privileges, relating to the first and second words, were set out by the
Ark, the Altars, the Burnt offerings, the Incense, the Fire on the Altar, and
such like: as any spiritual discerner may discover, by comparing the Epistle to
the Hebrews with the pattern in the Mount. Numb. 5, 22, 25 26. Lev. 6. 3, 6.
Numb. 6. 1-21.
The third word or command, in several duties of it, had annexed Ceremonials,
as particularly about an Oath, about a Vow. Thus also about the sixth word or
command; Deuteronomy. 21. 1-9.
as in a case of Murder: about the seventh command: Numb. 5. 11. 31
as in a case of Jealousy: about the eight word or command, as in a case of
Lev. 6. 1-7.
Restitution: and generally when a Soul did sin in omitting of some duty, or in
committing of a Trespass, when it was ignorantly, or in some other cases, Lev.
4. 5. chapter 6.
there were peculiar offerings that were appointed. So that, if this carnal
reasoning did hold, it would lay aside all and every of the other ten words.
This Epistle to the Colossians does establish the Law of the ten words in the
several particulars of it; Col. 2. 18.
and the first word, by forbidding the worshipping of Angels: ver. 20-23.
the second, by condemning of Will Worship. The third by taxing of Balsphemy,
chapter 3. 8.
especially when against the Holy Name of God, The fourth word, by showing the
accomplishment chapter 2. 16, 17.
of the Ceremonials annexed to Sabbaths, if it were admitted, that the
Seventh-day Sabbath were here included: chapter 3. 18-25. and 4. 1.
The fifth word by pressing to a discharge of Relation-duties: chapter 3. 8.
The sixth, by declaring against Anger, Wrath, and Malice: chapter 3. 5.
The seventh, by threatening of Fornicators, and unclean Persons with the Wrath
of God: chapter 3. 25. and 4. 1.
The eight by for bidding of wrong, and commending of Justness and Equality in
dealing: chapter 3. 8. 9.
The ninth by prohibiting of lying and evil speaking: The tenth by charging of
inordinate lusting to be Idolatry: Which is also a breach of the first command.
Thus is the Decalogue confirmed in this Epistle.

The next premise is, that the LORD Jesus Christ was Administrator under the
Old, as well as New Testament dispensation of Grace. I take it to be one great
occasion of many misapprehensions, not only in the common sort of professing
Christians, but even in many who have gotten a name for Learning and for
Godliness; that they eye Christ as Christ and Redeemer only under the New
Testament, and God as Creator only, under the Old: Whereas Christ Prove. 8. 23.

says of himself, that he was anointed from the beginning before the Earth was
as yet made; and the Father speaks of this his Son, under the Old Testament,
that he had anointed him; Aelohim anointed him by pouring out of the Oil of his
Spirit upon him, with an effusion of a fullness of Gifts, and of Graces, and of
Joys, mentioning it expressly as a matter of Fact done, Mashiach, or Christ, or
Anointed, is one of the Mediators names; often used in the Old Testament: This
is attributed to his substance: The Father had ordained him to his Mediatoral
Office of Priest, King and Prophet even then. It was Christ, who was tempted by
the unbelieving Israelites of old: It was by Christ, that all things were
created: Christ was the same under all Dispensations of Grace: The Fathers
purpose and election concerning his people was in Christ: The whole Word, is
the Word of Christ: Believers were reproached for Christ, in Moses's time: It
was the Spirit of Christ, who was in the Prophets; and the Jews and Samaritans
acknowledged the Messiah, before they knew who was the very person, and this
Christ acted as Mediator under the Old, as well as under the New Testament:
Though his being born of a Virgin, and so taking the Humane Nature to his
Godhead, were a great part of the New Testament Dispensation; when in the days
of his flesh here on earth he familiarly conversed with men: For he had a way
of appearing as Man to several Believers upon several occasions under the Old
Testament, as a forerunning discovery of this latter. It was the Messiah or
Christ, who made himself known, by open manifestation visibly, audibly, to
Abraham, to Isaac, to Jacob, to Moses, and to several of the Prophets, and to
some others. It was he who proclaimed the Law of the ten Words at Mount Sinai;
and who afterward upon the same Mount, gave the typical pattern for that
Dispensation privately to Moses; It was he who was with the Israelitish Church
in the Wilderness; he was the Mediator between God and Man, even then; he was
the Reconciler, even in those Ages. This and more to this purpose, I have
already proved from the Scripture in this Book; and therefore if the Reader
would be further informed and enlightened in it, I refer him to the Pages cited
in the Page 67. 10 page 93.
Margin. Acts 10. 43.
This is he, to whom all, (observe all; It was the received and delivered
Doctrine of them all) the Prophets do give Witness, that through the Name of
the LORD Jesus Christ, whosoever believes in him, shall receive remission of
sins. A great, full word, this: But a remark and observand, a special one upon
it. It is acknowledged by this learned Man, that it was the Son, who from the
Foundation of the World, immediately in his own person transacted the Affairs
of God with Men; yet he opposes the Seventh day Sabbath; whereas, it was a Law
of Christ's giving to Mankind from the beginning.

Come we now unto the proofs of the several particulars forementioned; whereof
this is one, that this New Heaven, and this New Earth, spoken of in prophetical
Scripture, this Renovation by a New Creation, is not finished and completed,
but that it is yet to come in the large fufilling and accomplishing of it.
There will be. New Heavens, and a New Earth: This we believe; because the
Scriptures have foretold it: and we rejoice in Hope of their Appearing: For
they are not as yet come. These glorious Creatures are antedated by such
Objectors, by many hundreds of years. For, although there were some beginnings
of a New Creation in the Days of Christ's Flesh here on Earth, and after
Christ's Ascension, in the Apostle's time; in Regenerations and Conversions, as
there were also in the Old; For, even there we may read of the Psalm. 51. 10.
creating of a clean Heart, and of the renewing of a right constant Spirit:
Christ's name was Psalm. 72. 17. and 105. 15.
filiated even under that Dispensation, and there were Sons and Daughters new
createdly born unto him, even then; and Believers were instated in the Messiah
then. As for that place in the 2 Cor. 5. 17.
second Epistle to the Corinthians, If any man be in Christ, he is a new
creature; Old things pass away, beheld all things become new; It does speak a
wonderful change in the New Creature: The old carnal State; the old corrupt
Principles; the old crooked Rules; the old selfish ends; the old bad Frames;
the old uutoward Actings; the erroneous mistakes; the formality in Worship; the
old unscriptural Traditions; the old Sins; the old man's Conversion; and such
like: These do pass away: and all things, contrary to these, are become new: A
whole new man. The Apostle speaks of what is peculiar to the New Creature in
Christ, as such: For, as for the old ceremonious Rites, and their passing away,
even those that were not new Creatures, but were carnal Professors of
Christianity, yet had these things passing away, and they were put under a new
Administation: the new dispensation of Grace had Ordinances now in a more
spiritual heavenly way and manner. The passing away of old things here, is of
old things so far as they stand in opposition to the new Creature; and 2 Cor.
5. 14, 15.
unto that new life in and to Christ, which now the converted person should
live: That, as Christ so loved his people, as to dye and rise again for them,
so should those in Christ thus evidence their Love to Christ, by living no
longer to themselves, but unto him; crucifying the old man; mortifying the sins
and lusts of that old man, and vivifying or quickening the new man: which was
true in the Types and Figures before Christ was come, born of the Virgin Mary;
and which is still true, now after that Christ is come and ascended up into
Glory. But all this does make nothing, as to the passing away of the Law of the
ten Words; in all of them, or in Mat. 5. 17, 18, 19.
any one the least of them. This is a distinct fort of Laws, from the Typical,
Figuring, Shadowy, Institutions. The Law of the ten Words, as it always has
been, so is it now, and still will be, Gal. 6. 15, 16. and 5. 6. compared with
1 Cor. 7 19.
the Rule of the new Creature in Christ Jesus: For, what in one place, is
called the new Creatures Rule, in another, speaking to the same case, is the
keeping of the Commandments of God. In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision
avails any thing, nor Uncircumcision; but a new Creature: And as many as walk
according to this Rule, Peace be on them and Mercy, and on the Israel of God.
The Israel of old had no saving benefit barely by the outward sign of
Circumcision: whereas God's Israel then, who had the sign and the thing
signified too, they had the Mercy and Peace, who were new Creatures, united to
the Messiah Heb. 11. throughout. Romans 3. 29, 30, 31.
by Faith working by Love: who had their hearts circumcised to love Jehovah
their God, who had sin subdued and lust mortified: And the uncircumcision under
the new Dispensation was not of any good avail without the new Birth, without
conjunction to, and communion with it: and if the Regenerate, the new Born, the
new Created would evidence and approve themselves to be such; and to be in
Christ, they must obey him and keep his Commandments: But what is all this to
any change of the weekly Sabbath, from the Seventh to the First Day of the
Week? To pass from one sort of Laws into another sort of Laws, from the Law of
figuring Types, to the Law of the ten Words; and to infer the passing away of
any one of the Laws of the ten Words, from the passing of Types into the
Antitypes, and of signifying Figures into their signified things; is a
transition from one kind to another; a way of sophistical arguing, of
fallacious disputing, captiously to overreach the ignorant too credudulous
vulgar, and to defraud them of their right to the Truth.

As for that part of the Objection, which does speak of new Heavens, and of new
Earth, pretended to be completed and finished on the Day of Christ's
Resurrection, from whence to conclude the passing away of the Seventh-day
Sabbath, to make room for a First-Day-weekly Sabbath, it is so scriptureless,
so natureless, so reasonless, an inference, that it should have been more
preconsidered by this Arguer, whether it do conclude and prove any thing but
this, that the Adversaries would fain have something or other that might carry
a little color, and some show with it, if they know what; For, let it be
pondered, upon search and examination, that all those places of Scripture,
which do speak of the new Heavens, and the new Earth, do relate to a further
time for their full accomplishment than precisely to the Day of Christ's
Resurrection.

That Prophecy in Isai. 43. 19. 20.
Isaiah, has an eye to the more large and spreading conversions of the two,
and ten Tribes, in the latter days yet to come. How was this then fulfilled on
Christ's Resurrection-Day? who of them was then converted? what eminent new
Creatorship was there then brought forth, which might put any such signal
remark upon the First Day of the Week, as from thence to become the new weekly
Sabbath? When the most of the Disciples themselves did scarce believe him to be
raised, till after that Day was over: And two Disciples, with whom he had
walked some Miles that Day, had little belief of his Resurrection; and little
knowledge of him, till he disappeared from them? How few in comparison, were
brought in unto Christ, and made new Creatures, in all Christ's life time, at
his Death and Resurrection, and forty Days after that, till after his
Ascension, and after the pourings out of the Holy Spirit? That forementioned
Prophecy does foretell, that Nations shall be brought under the Isai. 43. 3, 4.
Jews Dominions, when those new Heavens, and new Earth shall appear. This was
not at the time of Christ's Resurrection-day; nor ever since: and they were
then, and have been since, for sixteen hundred years or more, so far Ruling
over the Nations, that they have been a scattered, despised broken people,
without so much as any Hos. 3. 4, 5.
Political Kingly Government amongst themselves: It foretells, that those of
Judah, and of Israel should be gathered out of all Quarters, Isai. 43. 5, 6.
East, West, North and South: This also is behind yet unfulfilled: That
Euphrates would be dry: Was this on Christ's Resurrection Day? Or has it been
since? Is not this also yet to come, upon their return to their own Land in the
latter Days? Will not Isai. 43. 17.
their grand Enemy the Turk be then overthrown, who has so long wrongfully
possessed their Inheritance? which when it is, will be so great a work for the
inhabited Earth to take notice of, where the ear-report shall come, or the
eye-witnessing be, that it will obscure the memory of former Acts.

Another Prophecy by Isai. 65. 17,
Isaiah, does fortel, that at that time of the new Heavens, and the new Earth,
the ten Tribes of Israel, as well as the other two, of Judah, and of Benjamin,
shall according as to an express promise, Isai. 65. 10.
return home to their own Country and Land: For 1 Chronicles. 5. 16. Act. 95. Josh.
12. 18. 1 Chronicles. 27. 29. Isai. 33. 9. Song. 2. 1.
Sharon was in Gilead, which belonged to Manasseh: The Valley of Achor was a
parcel of the Tract of Jericho, in the Tribe of Josh. 7. 24, 26. and 15. 7.
Hos. 2. 15.
Judah. There will then be a new face of things in their glorious and blessed
Renovation; when there will be diverse things accomplished, which are not as yet
fulfilled: As may be seen in the next Scripture Isai. 66. 22.
cited in the Margin: which is a part of this same Prophecy. For, observe
here, Isai. 66. 5.
the Jews shall then be restored, when this will be performed: Their Foes will
be terrified Isai. 66. 6.
upon the report of the Jews repair home, which is not fully verified: Isai.
66. 10, 11, 12. (compare Rev. 1. 7. and 3. 9. and 3. 9.)
The Nations will do homage to the Jews upon their Conversion: whereas hitherto
they have been dispersed among, and subdued by the Nations; are objects either
of scorn or pity to all Mankind where ever they are; Isai. 66. 14, 15, 16.
a great overthrow will be given to their open Enemies; which is yet to come.
Isai. 66. 23. (and chapter 56. 1-8. and 42. 4, 16, 21.)
The converted Jews will turn to Jehovah Christ; and will constantly and
continuedly serve him according to Gospel Institution; particularly by
observing the Seventh-day Sabbath, in his Sabbath: which expression is used
Numb. 28. 10.
elsewhere; referring to the Seventh-day Sabbath. When these things shall come
to pass, the LORD will make crooked things to be streightness before his
people; when that Law of his, to which the Isles do expect shall be magnified,
and made honorable, as the Giver of it, also will be. So great and so glorious
things being to come, so long after Isaiah's Prophesyings: Such as whereof all
the World could not have foretold; these are confirmed and verified by the
Testimony of the Father, in his Son, by his Spirit in his Word. As for what is
Prophesied of by Ezekiel. 46. 4.
Ezekiel concerning the new Temple, or Church state, where especial direction
is given for the service of the Sabbath Day; this does confirm and establish
the Seventh-day Sabbath to continue under New Testament times. For it speaks of
such a Day of Sabbath, in the same Week, as has six working Days going Ezekiel.
46. 1.
before it: which is Exodus 20. 8, 9, 10, 11.
expressly according to the same Law proclaimed Mount Sinai, as one of the ten
Words. That, which is alleged 2 Pet. 3. 13.
out of Peter, was a Prophecy long after Christ's Resurrection and Ascension,
2 Pet. 1. 14.
a little before Peter's death; and not long before the destruction of the
Temple, and of the Jews; which had a quite contrary Face and Nature from the
glorious Renovation foretold. Those new Heavens and new Earth that were
prophesied, were at that time of Peter's writing the Epistle, in the Promise,
unfulfilled: such as were yet 2 Pet. 3. 12, 13.
expected, and looked out after: and the whole Discourse does manifest, that it
was not then accomplished. 2 Pet. 3. 10. (compared with Rev. 1. 10. and 16.
(...).)
That day of the LORD (the same LORDLY Day spoken of in the Revelvtion, the
great providential Day of his LORDLY Appearance) was not then come, it 2 Pet.
3. 7.-18.
Peter's time: The Heavens were not then passed away with a noise, they were
not then perished in flames by fire; the Elements were not then burnt and
loosed, or dissolved and melted; the Earth, and the works that were therein,
were not then burnt up. The Heavens which are now (says he, speaking of those
that were in his Day and Time) and the Earth are by the same Word laid up as a
Treasure; and are kept unto fire against the day of Judgment, and of the
Destruction of ungodly men, or of corrupt Worshippers. These things, says he,
shall perish; They had not then perished: The day of the LORD shall come, It
was not then come; but they were to look for, and to hasten unto the coming of
it: We, according to his promise, expect new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein
dwells Righteousness: We look for these things, They were as yet but in the
Promise: They were under the Expectation of Believers: They looked for them,
but they did not then see and enjoy them actually, in their real Coming; for
they were not as yet come. Thus also that Prophety by John, in the Rev. 21. 1,
2, 3, 4, 5.
Revelation; when he had a Visional sight of a new Heaven and a new Earth, upon
the passing away of the first Heaven and the first Earth; and when he saw the
Holy City, and the New Jerusalem; and when a great Voice out of Heaven had told
him, that God would wipe off all tears from the eyes of his Vovenant People;
and that Death should be no more, neither mourning nor crying, nor any more
trouble; for the former things should pass away. He that sat upon the Throne
said, Behold, I make all things new: Write, for these things are true and
faithful. Is it not evident here, that this Prophetie was many years after the
Day of Christ's Resurrection? And must not the Fulfilling be after the
Prophetie? Is there not enough in this very place to confute the Objector's
Arguing; Is the first Heaven and the first Earth yet passed away? When ever was
this fulfilled? Is the new Heaven and the new Earth yet come? Is the Holy City,
the New Jerusalem, as yet come down from God Rev. 21. 2, 10. and 3. 10.
out of Heaven? Are there not tears found in the eyes of the LORD'S people, to
be wiped away? Is there not death still? Are these former things yet passed
away? Is not the LORD He, who then foretold, that he would make all things new?
John saw in a Vision, and heard in a voice, they would be so made; but they
were not actually so excellent on earth in John's Day and Time. For there will
be this new face of things in the Churches of Christ on earth: This New, Holy
City, Jerusalem, is not said to go up to God, into Heaven; Rev. 21. 2.
but it does come down from God out of Heaven. Rev. 21. 3.
God will renew his Covenant with his people, and he will Tabernacle with them.
Rev. 21. 22.
God will put away Humane Ordinances, Inventions, Impositions, and Traditions,
to set up his own Institutions, all the Laws and Orders of his New House, in
their Purity and Power. Rev. 21. 23-20.
The Nations shall receive Light from this New Church; so shiningly enlightened,
so clearly taught of him. Rev. 21. 27.
Church Discipline shall be revived, set up, and exercised: Distempers,
Diseases, and Ulcers, of Spirit, of Soul, and Body, shall be healed, and cured,
and removed, Rev. 22. 2.
by the Medicinal leaves of the Tree of Life. All which do belong to a
Church State here on earth. If other passages in this Book of the Revelation be
collated, it will appear, that many things foretold to go before this, are not
yet fulfilled: Rev. 1. 7. and 7. 1-8.
For there must be another manner of Conversion of the Tribes yet: of all the
Tribes; which do include the Ten of Israel, as well as the Two of Judah and
Benjamin; The twelve thousands of the several Tribes. Rev. 16. 1^, etc.
The New Church was to be erected, after that the Sea of the Beast was

The Returning Jews are called the Kings of the East. There will be a laying
dry the Rev. 16. 12. (Isai. 11. 15.)

Overthrow shall be: Rev. 2. 9. and 3 9: and 21 and 22 chapters.
And there will yet be a glorious Christian Church of returning, believing Jews
erected; Rev. 21. 23, 24, 25.

doing them Homage; and bringing in their Glory to them; whom the King of Saints

Rev. 22. 4, (...).
completing and perpetuating their Purity and Peace, their Holiness and
Happiness: So that these are Works, which were never yet so finished, and which
yet remain behind to be done.

That Prophecy in Jer. ^1. 22, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. 37.
Jeremiah does speak much the same thing: For there is foretold the destruction
of the Jer. 30. 23, 24.
Enemies of the Jews, which will be in the last days, the usual expression
setting out the accomplishment of this glorious Mystery, as other Scriptures do
declare: Jer. 32. 1.
Then will Jehovah renew a Covenant with all the Families of Israel; All, with
the ten, as well as with the other two Tribes. Here also is, Jer. 31. 8, 9.
the place expressed, from what part of the inhabited Earth their return should
first be, even from the North. The Call would be to the generality of that
people to come unto Christ, and so great a multitude would be converted to him,
as were not to be numbered by man. Jehovah himself would be their Conductor and
Leader in the way of their Return: The LORD's providential appearance would be
so wonderful in this, that Jer. 30. 10, 11.
the Nations afar off, and remote in distance from them, would upon report
hereof brought unto them, much praise Aelohim for his Grace and Favor toward
his People. The Lamention was foretold then, would be great Jer. ^1. 15-20.
(compare Zach. 12 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.)
when Innocents were slain at Christ's Birth; but for greater in the latter
Days, after that; when the Israelites would repent and turn unto Christ: then
should they return home to their own Land, to dwell in their Cities: Their
Enemies would be overthrown by a Jer. 31. 22.
Woman; these Converts should peaceably inhabit their Jer. 31. 23-38.
Country; y Jer. 31. 21.
and become very happy in being made, a pure glorious Church: Jer. 31. 31.-37.
The new or renewed Covenant would be firmly ratified, and surely established
with them: Jer. 31 38, 39, 40.
Jerusalem would once again be rebuilt. Have these gladtyyings, yet had their
through fulfilling? are they not Works yet to be performed?

That other Scripture in the Epistle to the Heb. 8. 8.-13.
Hebrews, has the same Import and Design, as to the Covenant, and the renewing
of it. Here is no determinate Day of Christ's Resurrection mentioned; when this
Promise was to have its exact precise fulfilling: and if we would point any
particular time more than other, according to this kind of arguing, it was
rather the Fruit of Christ's Heb. 8. 1, 4.
Ascension, if it relate to those times so near Christ, when this High Priest
entered into the Holy of Holies: For this Chapter does more particularly set out
the High Priesthood of Christ, entered into Heaven with Blood, and with Incense,
satisfying and interceding there; fitting at the Right hand of his Father;
Reigning; having all Power; sending Messengers to teach his People; and so is
more consummately a glorious Priest, King and Prophet together; actually
bestowing upon Believers all those purchased, covenanted Blessings, for which
he intercedes on their behalf; as Pardon, Peace, Grace, Mercy, Reconciliation,
Assistance, Acceptance, and such like: which he did for Believers before, but
in another way of dispensing: For, whilst he remained on Earth, even after his
Resurrection, till he ascended into Heaven, the Levitical Priesthood did
continue. So that, the Honor is more in some respect put upon Christ's
Ascension, if we will date these new things about that time, when Christ went
up into the highest Heavens: For, then more especially, was the Heb. 10. 19,
20, 21.
new and living Way new made, by Christ's entering into the Holy of Holies, into
the highest Heaven. As to what does relate to the New Testament Ministration,
as such more spiritually dispensed, we have several times acknowledged, that
without making any change in the sum and substance of the Christian Religion,
in the Law of the ten Words. The Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, does set
out the excellency of the New Testament, above and beyond the Old, as to the
clearness and gloriousness of dispensing the same Truths and Things of God,
which were of old under a darker administration. Heb. 10. 15, 16, 17, 18.
(compare 2 Cor. 2. 3, 15, 16, 17.
This new Covenant spoken of, has had in all Ages, since the writing of that
Epistle, some particular fulfillings, when the Regenerating Spirit does write
the Holy Law of the ten Words, on the two Tables of the Mind and Heart of any
person and people, especially if they be of the converted Hebrews, who are more
eminently concerned in this Promise, the most of which is yet behind
unaccomplished, and waits for the larger conversions of that people, in days
yet to come: For that is a prophetical Scripture, yet taken out of that place
in Jeremiah, which has been spoken unto already, and which is again mentioned
Rev. 212, 7.
toward the closing up of the New Testament Canon, as reserved for one of the
choicest Blessings of the last days. The newest things then, will be the last
things, called therefore the Tempora Novislima. This is comparatio voce rantum,
ubi vox con. enit, significatlo dissentit: ut Novus New, Novislimus Last, See
Danesius's Lat. gram. page 65.
newest Times: Romans 8. 19 -- ^5.
For the fulfilling of this, the whole Creation does groan and wait, especially
those who have the First Fruits of the Spirit; they groan in themselves,
expecting the Adoption, Redemption of their Body: The rest of the Creation long
to be delivered from the wrong that is done to them by fallen Devils, and by
sinful men: They labor under their subordination to vanity, their oppresling
servitude, their traveling pain, their use and service being so quite
perverted from what it was at their primitive make: and they shall be freed,
when the New Created-State shall come: For which, Holy longers do expect and
hope, when Tzijon shall put on her Royal Ornaments, when the new Heavens, and
the new Earth shall appear clothed with their new glorious Dress: when the
Elect have been all gathered in unto Christ; when the Saints shall be possessed
of the full and whole of their Heavenly Inheritance, to which they are adopted;
of their glorious Liberty, to which they are appointed; from remaining
indwelling Sin, to a complete Holiness; from persecutions, temptations, sorrows
and other troubles, to an uninterrupted peace, and happy Sabbatism; from their
strange Country, where they meet with such unkind usage, to their purchased
Home, and prepared Palace in their new City; when their Body shall be more
perfectly Redeemed, that it may be transformed into a likeness unto Christ's
glorious Body, together with their Spirit and Soul; all together, fully to
enjoy this God in Father, Son and holy Spirit, for ever to glorify him in
consort with the blessed Inhabitants of that Heavenly Country; where they may
have all their waitings for fulfilled; all their Prayers answered; all their
longings satisfied; all their capacities filled up with a suitable good: Then
shall groanings pass into shoutings; and sighings into singings; O for that
day! O who will give this! O how could Hearts sick of Love for more of Christ
in clearness of Vision, and in fullness of enjoying, even leap out of the Body;
and forthwith give a spring into Glory! O how good is it to be here / But I
must come down to this Mount, and do further work yet, for my LORD and Master.

I am now to evidence from the Scriptures of Truth, that there was a Covenant
of Grace under the Old Testament Administration. This Doctrine of Grace is
that, which must lay the foundation for an after assertion of mine about a Law
of faith, under the Old Testament; For Romans 4 ^6.
Grace and Faith are companions: Rich Grace, abounding Mercy, free Love, from
the Father, in and through his Son Christ, revealed to and in his people, does
by his Spirit in his Word, Inwork the Grace of Faith in them, and calls forth
acts of Faith from them; that Christ may be made to them, Wisdom,
Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption; that no flesh might glory in his
Presence; but that those who glory, mighty glory in the LORD: and saving
justifying Faith does bottom upon the Power and Truth of God; manifesting his
unchangeable free Grace to Believers; giving them this Grace of Faith, whereby
they apply Christ and his Righteousness unto themselves, for their
justification in the fight of God, making them to acknowledge, that Ephesians. 2,
8, (...).
they are justified, accepted and saved, not of Works, neither of themselves,
but by Grace, through and for Christ.

In Order to the Augmentation of this Holy Science, I would propound these
Questions to further Disquisition.

Q. Whether, where ever in the Old Testament, he that appeared as a Man, or as
an Angel, and withal is called Jehovah, be not always Christ, manifesting
himself under that Dispensation of Grace?

Q. Whether, if all the Hebrew Words, which in the Old Testament do set out
Grace, Mercy, Sweet Savor, Acceptance, free Favor, Covenanting, Atonement,
Reconciliation, Propitiation, Pardon and such like; withal Synonyms and Phrases
relating thercunto. If all these were put together, it would not bring great
Light to this Doctrine of a Covenant of Grace?

Q. Whether there be clear Scripture-Evidences, that ever there were any
Covenant made between God and Man, of Salvation by Works only, without Free
Grace in a Mediator, on God's part; and without Faith in a Messiah on Man's
part? So that Man's Justification and Eternal Life was solely and merely upon
this one only condition of man's perfect, perpetual, absolute, personal
obedience to the whole Law of God, to all and every of his Commands.

Before I pass more thoroughly into the Proof of a Covenant of Grace under the
old Dispensation, it may be of some use to open that expression of a New, or a
Renewed Covenant, Jer. 31. 31, 32. Heb. 8. 9.
in the Prophecy of Jeremiah, and in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Chadash. 1 Samuel 11. 14. Psalm 51. 10. Iam 5. 21. 2 ^brou 15. 8. Psalm. 03 5. Job 10. 17.
Psalm. 104. 30. Isal. 61. 4. Lev. 23. 16.
The Hebrew word for New is several times rendered Renewed by the English
Translators themselves; as the Reader may see in the Scriptures cited in the
Margin: the Hebrew often signifying, not New for the Kind, but another of the
same thing for Kind: The same word, which is in Jeremiah, A Covenant Renewed;
as New Days, and New Mercies, are Renewed Days, and Renewed Mercies John 13.
24. 1 John 2. 7, 8. 2 John 5.
Thus a new Commandment of Love, is a Renewed Commandment of the good old duty
of Love, (...).
Thus also in the Greek Language, in that forementioned Instance; it was an old
Command renewed and revived: So it is also in the (...), To renew; in the
composition with (...) to renow. 2 Cor. 4. 16. Col. 3. 10. Romans 12. 2. Tit 3. 6.
Verb. Hence the Renewing of our Mind, and the Renewnig of the Holy Spirit.
That it has this sense in the eighth Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews,
will yet more clearly appear; when I shall discover, that all and every of the
particulars expressed in that Covenant, are such as have been, as were in their
nature, real Existence, and actual Being, under the Old Testament dispensation.

In this, as in other great Undertakings in this Treatise, my Calls are more
vocal than others from the LORD; to commit my soul by well doing, unto this
Faithful Creator, and loving Redeemer, Jehovah Christ. Considering the much
opposition I have met with heretofore, about this and other such Enquiries; and
may yet further be exercised with. But he who made all things is also the Head
of the Body; of his Body the Church; that in all he might hold the Chief. For
so it pleased the Father; who in, and through, and by his Son, has in all Ages
of the world, manifested and dispensed much of the freeness of this Love, and
of the Riches of his Grace; which that Romans 4. 16. Heb. 6. 13-. 18.
it might be made firm unto his people, he has put into a Promise, made sure
with his Oath.

That Covenant which Aelobim in Christ made with his people, was a Covenant of
Grace; one and the same both in the Old and New Testament, differing only in
the manner of dispensing: As also is the whole of the Christian Religion Ephesians.
1. 3, 4, 5, 6.
one and the same in both, for Doctrines and Duties, for Graces and Privileges,
and such like parts of this Religion, which does vary only in the several ways
of Administration.

By a Covenant of Grace, I mean the LORD'S free promising of Life, of Wisdom,
of Righteousness, of Sanctification, of Redemption, of all good things to his
people, believing in Christ; who are thus specally favored by him. The
Instances which I shall particularize in, will be those after Adam's Fall. Such
a Gracious Covenant the LORD made with his people, who were under the Old
Testament-dispensation. Genesis 3. 15.
How much of Grace was there put into that one comprehensive Promise, The Seed
of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's head.

I shall gather a little out of that full store of this which is to be found,
and put it together. Genesis 6. 8, 9.
Noah was one that found grace in the eyes of Jehovah; a just man, perfect in
his Generations; he walked with Aelohim. It is one of Jehovah's Names, that he
is gracious: And it is the special privilege of his people, that he has a
peculiar favor for them. Romans 4. 4, 5. and 11. 5, 6.
This Grace does Paul, in what he wrote to the Church of Rome, oppose unto
Works, and unto Debt: It was the free meroy of God, in Christ; Noah did not
deserve it. And it was Heb. 11. 6, 7.
by faith that Noah pleased God, and served him with acceptance. With this Noah
did Aelohim establish his Covenant, that Noah should enter into the Ark; he,
and his Sons, and his Wife, and his Sons wives with him; where they should be
saved from the common drawning: Noah in faith, and in abedience, prepares the
Ark to the saving of his household; through the which be condemned the World,
and was heir of the righteousness which is by faith; as is mentioned in the
Epistle to the Hebrews. 2 Pet. 2. (...). and 1 Pet. (...). 19, 20, 21.
Peter calls him, A Preacher of Righteousness. That this was typical, and had
some further spiritual meaning in it, the same Peter does declare, by showing,
that Baptism under the New Testament was an Antitype to this, an answerable
Figure, saving of Believers by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. This Doctrine
of the Free Covenant of Mercy, of Righteousness, and of Salvatiou by Faith in
Christ, did Noah commend to his hearers; and it was sealed up toward the
Faithful, in that wonderful deliverance in the Ark, which did shadow forth
Salvation through Faith in Christ, and that Believers, of the Posterity of
Noah, should be Heirs by Faith of the righteousness of Christ; which was in
this Type made a special Free Covenant with them; whilst the unbelieving and
unperswadable, the impenitent and disobedient, living and dying such, would
perish and be destroyed. Genesis 8. 20, 21. Heb. 13. 10.
After the Flood, Noah thus saved, builds an Altar to Jehovah, which was a
Figure of Christ; by whom we are to offer the Sacrifice of Praise, always unto
God; as is interpreted in the Epistle to the Hebrews: It is Christ, the
spiritual Altar, who does sanctify the offering, and the gift. On this Altar
which Noah did build, Noah offered up burnt Offerings of every clean Beast, and
of every clean Fowl. The LORD Christ was hereby Typified, who performed his
Office of Mediation, as in all the other parts of it, so in the discharge of
his Priestly Function, offering up of himself a propitiatory Sacrifice to God
his Father more especially, for those whom the Father gave unto him: This he
did by the everlasting Spirit without spot: This was signified hereby,
expiation, and the doing away of sin, by the slain Sacrifices of Christ
himself: Jehovah smelled a smell of rest, in what Noah did; graciously
accepting of the Sacrifice thus offered: and again makes a Covenant with Noah,
of rich Mercy in Christ: by and through whom Believers should be freed from the
Curse. For another confirmation of this gracious Promise, the LORD makes it
sure unto Believers by a sign. He gives them a Genesis 9. S.-17l
visible Token at some Seasons, for the encouragement of his peoples Faith,
that when they saw him giving his Bow in the Cloud, they might believe, that he
would remember his Covenant, that they might rest on him, and on his
faithfulness, in the true performance of the Word of his Grace. Isai. 34. 9, 10.
This Covenant made with Noah, that there should not be any more a Flood, to
destroy the Earth, does the Prophet Isaiah apply to the Covenant of Grace, made
with Believers in Christ, confirmed by Oath. For, as he swore, that the Waters
of Noah should no more go over the Earth, so he has sworn, that he will be no
more angry with his Vovenant People, nor rebuke them; And the Rainbow, which is
a visible sign of his special Favor, is both in Ezekiels Vision, and in the
Visions of John, in the Rev. 4. 3. and 10. 1.
Revelation, used as a sign of Grace from God to his people in Christ: It was a
gracious Testimony of Christ's glorious Majesty.

This Covenant of Grace was afterward Genesis 12. 1, 2, 3. and 15 5, 6. and 17.
throughox^. and 18. 18. and 22. Acts 3-25. Romans 4 9-23. Gal. 3. 6.-18. Luke 1.
72, 73. Heb. 6. 13-18.
renewed to Abraham; and that, several times; wherein Jehovah did promise to
bless him, and to bless all the Families of the Earth in him, in the promised
Seed, in Christ. Abraham is called, The father of all believers. The LORD
Christ appeared unto Abraham about eight times, unto Isaac about three times,
and unto Jacob about seven times, for the more establishing encouragement of
Faith in his Promises; so many we have upon written Record. This free gracious
Covenant and Promise, does Paul in his Epistles, to the Romans, and to the
Galatians, affirm, improve, and apply. It was sealed by Circumcision to
Abraham: and that which was sealed was the Righteousness of Faith; and his
Faith was therein confirmed by Jehovah's Oath, as the Scriptures in diverse
places have recorded: It was full of Mercy and Favor, and Jehovah forgets it
not: but, as he has remembered, so he does and will remember for his people,
this his holy Covenant. Gal. 3. 16, 17.
The Covenant of the Law proclaimed afterward at Mount Sinai; could not
disanul this Covenant with Abraham; which was confirmed before of God in respect
of Christ: as Paul argues with many convincing Arguments: especially two, if
this be well considered, that Exodus 19 and 20. Chapters.
there was a Covenant of Grace in that Covenant at Mount Sinai; which Jehovah,
the Aelohim of his people, did then and there strike with his people at Horeb.
The Typical Signs and Shadowing Figures, delivered more privately there unto
Moses; together with the many annexed gracious Promises, relating thereunto,
with respect to Priest, Sacrifices, Altar, and such like, do cast a clearer
shining Light upon this, before the Eyes of every Spiritual Discerner, that
will diligently compare the New Testament Commentary, particularly the Epistle
to the Hebrews, upon that part of Moses's Book, where the Veil, that was upon
the Face, is taken off.

And, if further, this may also be demonstrated concerning the Law of the ten
Words, which was proclaimed with more open Solemnity, and glorious Majesty,
that this also has in it the same Covenant of Grace, the Kingly Law will then
the more commend it self to the hearts of all the Disciples of Christ.

This Law has in the Scriptures, the Name and the Thing of a Covenant of Grace.
It is called a Covenant, such an one as has Grace in it; For, if we consider
it, as having the supperadded Law of Types and of Figures, annexed to it; So
Heb. 9. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Exodus 24. 6, 7, 8.
this Covenant was not dedicated without Blood. The patterns of heavenly things
were purified by the Blood of Sacrifices, whereby Christ was held forth as
confirming the Promises to Believers by his own Blood. The Prophet Haggai makes
mention of Hagg. 2. 5.
this Covenant, made with them in Christ. And Paul in declaring the Privileges
and Advantages of that People, does reckon up these, that they were the adopted
people of God, the Romans 9. 4.
Ark of the Covenant, in which the ten Words was put, were amongst them, was
their Glory; all full of Grace; there were the Covenants; the two Tables of
them; the Law-giving, and the Instituted-worship, was theirs; and so were the
Promises too, which went along together with those other favors. Ephesians. 2. 12.
So that, to be estranged from the Citizenship of Israel, was to be strangers
to the Covenants of Promise. Exodus 34. 28.
The Words there spoken are called, The Words of the Covenant: The two Tables
on which the Words were written by the Finger of Aelohim himself, have the name
of the Exodus 34. 28. Deuteronomy. 10. 2, 3, 4, 5.
Tables of the Covenant, of the Testimony, of the Tables of the Testimony: The
Exodus 25. 16, 21. and 40. 20, (...). and 26. 33. and 30. 26. and 15. 22-25.
Ark into which the Law of the ten Words, and this only was put, is honored
with the Title of the Ark of the Covenant, the Ark of the Testimony, covered
over with Mercy, and crowned round about with Gold and Grace: The Tabernacle in
which this Ark was treasured up and kept, is said to be Exodus 38. 21. Numb. 1.
50. 53. and 10. 11.
the Tabernacle of the Testimony. O how full of Grace is all this! Consider
well who was the Lawgiver; Jehovah Aelohim, from the Father, in the holy
Spirit, by the LORD Christ, spoke with lively voice, Deuteronomy. 5. 3, 4. and so on
to the 25 verse.
faces in faces, and this unto all the people. It was this Christ who was
Administrator and Dispenser at Mount Sinai: He was the Proclaimer of his own
Kingly Law there, as has been already proved by the Scriptures. It was he,
whom the Father gave Isai. 42. 1-6.
for a Covenant of the people. He who is Gal. 3. 19, 20.
the Mediator of the Covenant: He who was the Mal. 3. 1.
Angel of the Covenant: 2 Cor. 1. 20. Dan. 9. 24-17. Romans 15. 8. Gal. 3. 14-17.
Romans 10. 4. Acts 10. 43.
He who was the Confirmer of the Covenant: He who ever was, is, and will be,
the foundation, the groundwork, the substance, the comprehensive of the whole
Covenant of Grace. He in whom all the Promises of God, as many as there be, are
Yea and Amen; Truth and firmness it self, faithful and unchangeable as he
himself is. This Law it self had much of a Gospel Design in it; In the
preparation that was made for the giving and receiving of it; there were
precious Promises made to that people, who were then about to be taken into
Covenant with Jehovah Aelohim: A God in Christ engaged that, if harkening they
would hearken to his Voice, and keep his Covenant, Exodus 19 4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 2.
9. Tit. 2. 14. Mal. 3. 17.
they should be a peculiar treasure unto him above all peoples: He would take
them for his own proper Goods. The same thing is mentioned in the New
Testament; Christ purchased to himself a peculiar people.

So Paul kept close to this Expression; and that of Peter is much the same, in
his first Epistle; though expressed by another; A people for peculiar
possession; these are they whom Christ Buys and Redeems to himself, for his own
special use and service, they are singularly dear unto him. So is that
Prophecy and Promise in Malachi. How rich, how free is this Grace; that
Jehovah chose his people Deuteronomy. 32. 9.
for his portion; as Moses thankfully confesses in the words of one of his
last Songs: They were that part which he had marvellously separated unto
himself; his Heritage, as by Li^^ allotted to him, whom none other can
challenge as their Propriety. Deuteronomy. 7. 6, 7, 8, 9. Romans 11. (...), (...).
This People he chose above all Peoples that are upon the faces of the earth:
Not for their Multitude above all Peoples did Jehovah set his love upon them,
and choose them, for they were the fewest of all peoples; but because Jehovah
loved them, and because he would keep the Oath which he had sworn unto their
Fathers did Jehovah bring them out with a strong hand, and redeemed them. The
Election was of his Grace, not of any worthiness in them. This Jewel was dear
unto him, and he promised a further honor that he would put upon them; They
should be unto him a Kingdom of Priests, and an holy Nation. Is not this the
self-same thing which is mentioned, as the Covenant-privilege of God's chosen
ones under the New Testament-dispensation of Grace? For Pet. 2. 5, 9. Rev. 1.
5, 6.
to this phrase does Peter keep, and so also does John in the Revelation; who
does give glory unto the LORD Christ, that he has made his people such now
unto God his Father. How full are the treasures of this Grace! O, what an
honor did Jehovah put upon that People, whom he so brought unto himself! How
signal a favor was this to his Israel!

If we look into the Ten words themselves, Exodus 20. 1, 2, 3, etc. Deuteronomy. 5. 6,
7, etc.
do they not begin with a gracious Covenant? I Jehovah, Thy God. This he made
over to his People in a special manner, there being no higher, no greater Good
than himself; none so high, none so great as he: He is all Good in one;
whatever Good there is, it is in and from him. They are the Blessed ones, who
have this Jehovah for their God. Psalm. 14^. 15.
O, the Blessedness of such! thus sweetly sung the Psalmist. This is the choice
part of their happiness, who enjoy this privilege by his Gracious Covenant, and
peculiar favor. Under every Dispensation of Grace, 2 Samuel 23. 5.
this is mentioned as the sum of all good; for this is all the Salvation, and
all the desire of Believers. To be For or To a God unto that People, 2 Cor. 6.
16. Rev. 21. 3, 7. Heb. 8. 10. Jer. 31. 33. Deuteronomy. 26. 16, 17, 18, 19.
is the substance of that Covenant of Grace, which God has made with his
People in Christ: So it has been to this day; and so it is revealed, that it
will be renewed and revived in the purest and best days. When he gives himself
to any, he gives an Inheritance of all things to such.

As Exodus 20. 2, 5, 7, 10, 12.
this does bring in the first great Word or Command, so also is it expressly put
into the Second, into the Third, and into the Fourth; into every Word of
Command of the First Table: In the Second Table also, we may find it in the
Fifth Word. And those that will diligently observe, and duly apply it in their
reading of the Holy Scriptures, may discern it to be a rich Portion, going
along with every one of the Ten Words in particular, as well as made over to
all of them in general; especially with respect to the Fourth Word. It is
remarkable in Moses's repeating of this Law, that in his going over of the Law
for the Seventh-day Sabbath, this Covenant of Grace, I am Jehovah, Thy God, is
Deuteronomy. 5. 12, -- 5.
four times expressly mentioned: besides the Type of Spiritual Redemption by
Christ; which is also about thirty nine years after Christ's first proclaiming
of this Law at Mount Sinai; superadded, and expressly put into this Fourth Word,
as a forcible Reason to engage Obedience to this holy Precept: The Figure of
which Salvation by Christ, and of his delivering of his people from their
Spiritual bondage and misery under Sin and Satan, is a choice part of the
Covenant of Grace. This is that which does lead in the Ten Words: By this
manifested Grace does he invite his people to Faith and Obedience. His Israel
of Old had Redeeming mercy put into the beginning of this Holy, Just and Good
Law; who were redeemed, not only from outward Slavery, but also from the
Idolatry of Egypt, Ezekiel. 20. 7, 8. 2 Samuel 7. 23.
as the Prophet Ezekiel has declared; and from the false Gods there, so has
Samuel discovered in his Second Book. And they had a Promise of other mercy in
the Exodus 20, 6,
Second Word, which Jehovah would do unto those, who loving him, and keeping
his Commandments: They should receive Mercies, Benefits, Loving kindnesses,
Bounties from him.

It is further note-worthy, that most of the Ten Words, even Eight of them, as
they are in the two Tables, are expressed in that manner, that they are Precepts
and Promises too, such is the significancy of that Future-tense in which they
run; and the other two, that is to say, the fourth and fifth, Lev. 19 3. and
26. 2. Ephesians 6. 1, 2, 3. Mat. 15. 4.
are put into the same promising, as well as commanding way, in the same Book
of Moses in another place: and the particular Duties and Graces, required in
those ten Words are somewhere or other covenanted by Jehovah Aelohim, to be
given to his people in other Scriptures; as to love him; to fear him; to
delight in him; and such like; he will inwork in them what he does require of
them. O what abundance of riches of Grace is here!

If you meditate upon what did accompany the ten Words, and what was annexed to
them, what were all the Shadows and Figures, and Types, but a significant
Commentary upon the Covenant of Grace? What was the true spiritual meaning of
all these superadded Patterns, but to set out Christ, and all those special
benefits, which Believers have and do enjoy in him, of which the followers of
Christ, under that Dispensation of Grace, had a free participation; as the
Disciples of Christ have now? 1 Cor. 10 1-4. Act. 15. 11. and 10. 43. Romans 10.
4.
they fed on Christ, in their Manna from Heaven; and they drank of Christ in
their Water from the Rock. By the Grace of the LORD Jesus Christ, they did
believe to be saved the same way, as Believers do now: Peter put no difference
between them and us, but only in the manner of dispensing. What shall I say
more, of all the Signs and Seals, The Sacrifices, the Oblations, and much more,
that might be spoken of.
under that Administration, of the free favor of Jehovah Aelohim toward his
Covenant people? What was all this, but a Gospel-Teaching, an applying of the
Covenant? Take but off the Veil from them, and they appear much with a face of
shining Grace. Was not the Virtue and Efficacy of Christ's death under that
dispensation of Grace? He was the Lamb sl^in from the Foundation of the World;
so he is said to be, in the Rev. 13. 8.
Revelation. Christ's satisfaction and intercession was available for his
Covenant people in Moses's time. The Book it self wherein Moses did write all
the Words of Jehovah, is called, Exodus 24. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Heb. 9. 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. and 10. 10, 14. Mat. 26. 28. Mar. 14. 24. Luke 22. 26.
The Book of the Covenant. This Book on the Altar, was sprinkled with blood to
be sanctified thereby; which blood is also called, The blood of the Covenant.
The people also were sprinkled with the blood of the Covenant, in the
sprinkling of the twelve Pillars, which did represent them, that is, the twelve
Tribes. This Covenant or Testament at Horeb, as the Author of the Epistle to
the Hebrews, has observed and declared, was not dedicate without blood. These
were Patterns, Anti-types (and the Types must answer the one to the other:) of
the heavenly things, and they were purified by the blood of those Sacrifices,
signifying, that the LORD Christ, by his death should sanctify his people unto
himself, by the blood of the New Testament; in a clearer manner of dispensing,
and fuller measure of accomplishing, though otherways, one and the same
Covenant of Grace. Moses called upon the people to behold this, which Scripture
is explained in what is written to the Hebrews; this is the Blood of the
Covenant, or of the Testament, which God has commanded unto you. Heb. 9. 11-18.
Thus was the Covenant of Grace under the Old Testament confirmed by the Blood
of Beasts, exactly answering unto the same Covenant of Grace, under the New
Testament; which was confirmed by the Blood of Christ. Acts 10. 43.
There was free remission of sins: acceptance of the person, and of the
service, for in the through Christ, then as there is now. All the Prophets do
give witness unto Christ; that, through his Name, whosoever believes in him,
shall receive remission of sins. This does further appear in Moses's repeating
over in the latter part of his Book, the same Covenant which Jehovah Aelohim
made with his people at Sinai; wherein he does at large discover, how much rich
Grace, and free Love, a God in Christ had manifested toward that people in
Covenant with him: The Book commonly called Deuteronomy is a second Declaration
of the same Covenant of Grace, repeated, renewed with their Children; renewed
with Israel; the same made before; only with some clearer Revelation of Christ,
and of Blessings by him, and of enlarged, explained promises. It was the same
Covenant of Grace, which was also solemnly renewed with, and by the people of
God, at their return from the Captivity of Babylon, as may be seen in the
Records of Ezra, and of Nehemiah. The same Covenant of Grace, also which the
LORD makes with his people in Christ now. And Jer 31. 31-34. Heb. 8. 10-13.
the same which he will revive and renew with the new formed created people in
the latter days. Who shall not so break Covenant as those Israelites in the
Wilderness of old did, but shall be more steadfast and faithful to God, who will
be so graciously in Covenant with them. Those promises in Jeremiah, repeated in
the Epistle to the Hebrews are if not peculiarly, yet at least chiefly, made to
the house of Israel; the ten Tribes, as well as Judah, have their part in them,
Ephraim setting out the Israelites of the ten Tribes: They shall come from the
North, and be generally called, an innumerable multitude; they shall dwell in
their Cities in their own Country; their City of Jerusalem shall be re-edified;
their Estate shall be flourishing and happy to perpetual continuance; with such
other things, as were never yet thoroughly fulfilled. Which cannot be meant of
their coming out of the Captivity at Babel: The promises relating to the New
Testament Dispensation. And all this shall be in the Jer. 30. 24. compared with
the whole of the 3^ Chapter.
last days, by which words this great Mystery is usually expressed.

This will yet further, be evidently demonstrated, in that, this Prophetie and
Promise was renewed and revived several years after Christ's Ascension into
Heaven, as is clear by the mention of it in that Epistle to the Hebrews, and in
several places of the Revelation. For the contrary to all this was some few
years in the same generation or age after Christ's death; the Jew's were
unchurched; the City and the Temple were destroyed, according to Christ's
foretelling, in what is written in that Mat. 24. 1-2^
Book of his Generation.

All and every of the particulars expressed in the renewed Covenant, were
before, under that Dispensation in Moses's time: They are also now made good
unto this present Dispensation, according to the manner and measure of
Administration, as the All-wise God saw and sees fit, which will be more
clearly manifested, and more fully accomplished in the last times. And with
this Prophetie both the Old and New Testament are closed. Let all and every of
the Particulars pass under a Scripture-Examination. Will Christ give his Laws
in the mind of his people, and write them in their hearts? Psalm. 37 3^* Isai.
51. 7. Deuteronomy. 30. 1, 2, 3, 6, 8. and 6. 6. compared with the 5 chapter 2 Cor. 3. 3.
So he did under the Old Testament-dispensation: The same thing was fulfilled
toward and in a Vovenant People then. Thus in Moses's Writings, Jehovah
Aelohim speaks to his People these words (The Ten Words written in the Two
Tables of Stone) which I commanding thee this day, shall be in thy heart. These
are the fleshly Tables wherein they shall be written. Thus the Psalmist in his
time, in his describing the Just man, says, The Law of his God is in his
heart, it shall not stagger his steps. The Prophet Isaiah thus sets out the
people of God; They are a People, in whose heart is this Law. It was Solomon's
advice in his Prove. 3. 1, 3. and and 7. 1, 2, 3.
Proverbs; My Son, forget not my Law, but let thine heart keep my Commandments:
Write them upon the table of thine heart. And again, a second time, in another
place; My Son, keep my sayings, and lay up my Commandment with thee: Keep my
Commandments, and live; write them upon the table of thine heart. Has the LORD
promised that he will be for or to a God to his people? This was performed
under the Old Testament. I have already showed, that it is expressly put into
the Ten Words several times. In Moses's time Jehova's people had Deuteronomy 26. 16-19
Lev. 26. 42, 45. Exodus 3. 6, 15, 1^. and 4. 5. Psalm. 73. 26. Lev. 26. 3, 12.
avouched, or had made to say, him to be unto them for a God: They owned and
acknowledged him to be thus in Covenant with them, for the confirming of their
Faith, and for the increase of their Obedience. I will remember unto them (said
Jehovah Aelohim, speaking of his Covenanting Israel, walking obediently:) the
Covenant of Ancestors; them whom I brought forth out of the Land of Egypt,
before the eyes of the Heathen, to be unto them a God: I Jehovah. Thus did he
often in that Book of Moses, make over himself to his people in Christ; such
delight did he take in taking occasion to tell them, that he was and would be a
God unto them. Was not here Covenanting Grace, and Redeeming Love? It was the
feign that was made before, with Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham, as sometimes the
order of words is: In other places is mentioned, from Abraham downwards, to
Isaac and Jacob: But in one place of Moses's Book it is mentioned, renewed and
confirmed, going upward; from the people near a deliverance in Egypt, to Jacob,
to Isaac, to Abraham, the Father of the Faithful: Thus leading them to that
former, and more ancient Promise, and Gospel Covenant of Grace in Christ,
Believers could say in the Psalmist's time, that J. ^^lohim was their portion
for ever. Has the LORD graciously promised, that a chosen People shall be his
people? So they were of old, in Moses's days If ye shall walk in my Stntutes,
(thus spoke he to them) and keep my Commandments, and do them; then I will walk
among you, and will be to you a God, and you shall be to me a People. Jehovah
has avouched (or has caused to say, or to promise, by giving his, and by
taking thy Word) thee to be unto him for a People of peculiar Treasure, as be
has spoken unto thee, and to keep all his Commandments: For Jehovah' s Deuteronomy.
32.
Portion is his people, Jacob the Line of his Inheritance; Ho has divided and
separated them unto himself, as his allotted part, and peculiar Possession,

Has he promised Covenant teaching and Knowledge? This also was a Covenant
privilege of Old. Exodus 6. 3, 6, 7, 8. and 34. 5, 6. Deuteronomy. 33. 2, 3, 4.
He taught them his name Jehovah; and made himself known to them by that name,
in putting a Being into his Promises made to their Fathers, for their
deliverance; and proclaimed this Name to Moses. His people sat down at his
feet, receiving of his Words. Thus were Christ's Disciples even then taught by
him, as their Master. Thou, says he to his people then, have been made see to
know, that Deuteronomy. 4. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.
Jehovah he Aelohim, none else besides him: And thou shall know, and cause to
return into thy heart, that Jehovah, he Aelohim; in the heavens above, and on
the earth beneath, none else. This does particularly relate to their being
instructed to acknowledge Christ's Jehovahship. Psalm. 25. 14. and 5. and 51. 6.
In David's time, the Secret of Jehovah was to them who feared him; and his
Covenant to make them for to know: He revealed in the inner Man of Believers
the hidden Mysteries of Wisdom.

Will he be merciful to the unrighteousness of his Vovenant People, no more
remembering their sins, and their iniquities? The same free Mercy and Grace was
manifested under the former Dispensation. Exodus 20. 6. and 3^ 6, 7, 8, 9. Psalm.
^2 1^2.
Christ has put it into the second Word or Command: and proclaimed it as his
Name, when Moses went up into Mount Sinai; as Jehovah had commanded him, taking
in his hand the two Tables of Stone: Jehovah, Jehovah God, pitiful and
gracious, long suffering, and much in Mercy and Truth; keeping Mercy for
thousands, forgiving iniquity, and trespass, and sin. Does not the blessedness
of man consist in this? Whereupon Moses makes haste, and bows himself, and
pleads this in Prayer; Pardon thou, O LORD, our iniquity, and our sin. Lev.
1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, chapters.
Was not this the meaning of the Sin Offerings, and of the Trespass Offerings,
with the annexed promises of Pardon, and of acceptance? Exodus 25. 17-25.
compared with Romans 3. 25. and 1 John 2. 1. and 4, 10.
Did not the covering Merch seat, which was altogether as broad as the Ark
(wherein were the two Tables) preach this? Did it not set out the merciful
covering and propitiation of sins? Was not this a precious Figure of Jesus
Christ? by and through whom, received by and through Faith in him, his peoples
transgranssings of the Law of the ten Words, are freely, fully forgiven, and
wholly covered? How full are the Books of Moses; of the Psalms, and of the
Prophets, of this comforting Doctrine?

So that all these Promises in the Covenant of Grace, have been, are and will
be the same under both the Dispensations. All the difference is, that in the
last days, there will be a more clear discovery of this gracious Covenant: A
more glorious way of dispensing; a more through inabling to the keeping of it.
For to this especially, have the expressions of difference an eye and respect,
between the old and renewed Covenant. Spoken of in Jer. 31. 31-34. Heb. 8.
10-13.
Jeremiah, and in the Epistle to the Hebrews compared. There will be larger
pouring out of the holy Spirit and blessing, from the Father in the Name of the
Son; in those latter purer times, that are near at hand: So that this Covenant
shall not be broken, as it has been under former Dispensations of Grace; but be
better kept with more exactness and faithfulness, with more intireness and
continuedness in the fullness and perfection of it. Halelujah: I will confess
Jehovah with all the heart: Gracious He. He will Remember his Covenant for
ever, toward his people. The secret of Jehovah to them, who fearing him, and
his Covenant, to make them for to know. All the paths of Jehovah Mercy and
Truth, to them that keep his Covenant and Testimonies; and that remember his
precepts for to do them. Have respect unto the Covenant! For ever thou will
keep for thy Saints, thy excelling Ones, thy Mercy and thy Covenant faithful to
them.

The whole of the Christian Religion for Doctrines, Graces, Duties,
Privileges, and such like parts of that Religion, is one and the same under
both the Old and New Testament. Is not the Word called the Col. 3. 16. Da^^. 8.
13. Heb. 12. 24, 25.
Word of Christ? Is not Christ named the speaking-one, both by Daniel, and by
the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews? Does not Christ call himself, John
11, 14. Rev. 19. 13.
the Word? and the Word of God? Is not He the sum, and the subject matter of
the whole Scriptures? Is not he the Author of them? Has he not said of
himself, he is Mat. 23. 8, 9, 10.
the one Doctor or Teacher of his Disciples? Is he not Acts 3. 22, 23. Rev. 22.
6. 1 Pet. 1. 10, 11.
the great Prophet? Is he not the LORD God of the holy Prophets? Did he not at
Mount Sinai, speak by his own voice from Heaven? Was it not his forewithessing
Spirit, who from him spoke in the Prophets of old, declaring the sufferings
that should befall Christ; and the glory that was to follow, as says Peter in
his first; Epistle? Psalm. 95. 7. Heb. 3. 6, 7.
Was not that passage in the ninety and fifth Psalm, To day if you will hear
his voice, applied to the voice of Christ, in what was written to the Hebrews.
John 5. 59.
Has not Christ himself declared, that those who searched the Scriptures might
find them testifying of him? And what other Scriptures had they at that time,
but those of the Old Testament? When he himself, in the days of his flesh did
exercise his public Ministry, preaching the glad tidings of Justice in the
great Church. Assembly; did he not teach in Mat. 5, 6, 7 Chapters.
that Sermon of his at the Mount, the same true Christian Doctrine, which was
delivered of old to his faithful Messengers from him, the which to bring to his
people? And did he not vindicate the verity and purity of it, from those
corrupt wrong Interpretations that false Teachers had given of it? Did not
Christ who lay in the bosom of his Father, John 1. 17, 18. Deuteronomy. 4. 1, 2. Psalm.
51. 10. Ephesians. 4. 24. Psalm. 100. 3. John 3. 1-10. Col. 3. 10.
declare and reveal the whole of the Will of his Father, under that former
dispensation of Grace, so far as concerned that Dispensation? And is it not one
and the same Will still? the difference in the manner of dispensing only, well
observed? Were not they then taught all things, and all Truths whatsoever, that
were necessary to Salvation? Were not they fully and perfectly directed the
true, right way to Eternal Life? Were not they strictly charged from Christ by
his Servant Moses, not to add to the words that he gave them in commandment,
nor to take from them? And must not that Word then, be a complete Directory,
and comprehensive sum of all Doctrinals, as well as of other matters? O who
will give, that this Word of Christ may ind well in us copiously, abundantly, in
all Wisdom! O let it not stand as a stranger without doors! but let us receive
it in, and find a place for it in our inmost parts! That it may be as well
known, and familiar to us, as the most dear delightful companions, and the most
near beloved Relations, with whom we dwell and converse. Let us be well
acquainted with the whole of it, and diligently compare it in the several parts
of it. Be we much and mighty in the Scriptures of both the Prophets, and also
of the Apostles, receiving the whole as a Doctrine revealed from Heaven by
Christ! O that this were more found in our Hearts and Minds! In our Memory and
Conscience! in our Wills and Affections! That all the good Fruits thereof may
abound, and be more visible in the whole of our Life! There we may learn all
saving Wisdom: There is the perfect Knowledge to be had of all things, to be
both believed and done, that Eternal Life may be obtained. There are Universal
Principles of this Law of the ten Words, which do pertain to Faith and Manners;
and these Practical Dictates which every one of these Laws does include is a
Fundamental Truth and Doctrine necessary to be believed; as, that we must have
Jehovah Aelohim for our God, and him alone: that we must worship him according
to his Institutions in his Word, and not in any other way of Humane Inventing,
and imposing, that we ought to have an holy reverent use of his Name: That the
Seventh day is his Sabbath, in which we may not do the servile works of our
particular calling; that the Father and Mother are to be honored; and so of
the rest. Whoever does believe the contrary to these, is guilty of erring in
Decalogical Fundamentals.

Have I not already demonstrated and proved by the whole Scriptures those great
Doctrines concerning the Jehovahship, the Christship, the Mediatorship, the
Lordship, the Lawgivership, the Creatorship of the LORD Jesus Christ? Would the
Reader have more Doctrines thus manifested?

The Doctrine of Regeneration was preached of old. The first Creation of Man
was an exact Patten, and a lively Samplar of this, Genesis 1. 26, 27, 28. Ephesians.
4. 24. Col. 3. 10.
when man was made in the Image, according to the likeness of his Makers, he
having a concreated resemblance unto his Creators, in Knowledge, in
Righteousness, in Holiness, in Dominion, in Glory; this was defaced by the Fall
of Man, and is again restored to Sons and Daughters of God in Spiritual
Recreation, which is a new man, renewed unto acknowledgement, according to the
Image of him who created him in Righteousness and Holiness of Truth. As Paul
does speak. Psalm. 51. 10.
David acknowledges in the Book of Psalms, that a new heart is Creation-work:
So glorious and excelling a piece, as that it is the making of a new World of
Men, and of Women. A Work that none but the Almighty-creating power can do: and
therefore all the Honor and Glory of it, must be given to him alone. This is
the humble confession called for, Psalm. 100. 3.
Know ye, that Jehovah he God, he made us, and not we; his people and sheep of
his pasture. This is variously expressed in the Old Testament; in very
significant Words. Deuteronomy. 30. 1, 2, 3, 6. Jer. 4. 4.
Moses sets it out by the circumcision of the heart. So does Jeremiah. David by
Creation and Renovation. Isai. 43. 1, 7, 21. and 44. 2. 21.
Isaiah, by Jahovah's creating a people for his Glory; for his Forming of them;
or Framing them anew (by the Spirit of Regeneration:) Ezekiel. 37. 1-14. and 36.
26, 27.
Ezekiel, by a Resurrection, a Life from the Dead; he calls it, a new Heart,
a new Spirit; an Heart of flesh; Jehova's giving of his Spirit in the innermost
of the Vovenant People. The Prophets often by conversion, or turning from sin
to Jehovah Aelohim. What Spiritual Discerner does not here see the same
Doctrine which Christ preached to Nicodemus, John 3. 1-10.
when he discovered to him the necessity of being born again from above;
otherwise there could be no seeing, no entering into the Kingdom of God:
Affirming once, and again, and the third time, that this must be? Which, when
this great Doctor understood not what this Spiritual Regeneration was, what
that was which was born of the Spirit; The LORD Christ reproves him for, and
convinces him of his Ignorance: Art thou a Teacher in Israel, and know thou
not these things? Whereby he evidently shows, that this was no such new unheard
of Doctrine before; but the same that was taught in Moses's Book, and by the
Prophets.

Would thou be led to some other great Truth? Consider that Doctrine about
Justification. Has not Habak. 2. 4. John 3. 36. Romans 1. 17. Gal. 3. 11. Hab.
10. 38.
Habakkuk declared, that, The Righteous, by faith he shall live? And is not
this three, if not four several times mentioned in the New Testament? Has not
Romans 3. 21-28.
Paul confirmed the same; showing that The Righteousness without the Law, only
by faith in Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all that believe; has testimony
from the Law and the Prophets? Does not Jer. 23. 6. (...) Pet. 2. 5. Heb. 11. 7.
Jeremiah call Christ by this name, Jehovah-tzidkenu, Our Righteousness? Did
not Noah preach the same true, sound Doctrine? Was not that which was said of
Genesis 15. 6. Romans 4. throughout Gal. 3. 6.
Abraham, that He believed, and it was imputed to him for Righteousness? Was
not this written, not for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for
our sakes also, to whom it shall be imputed, even to them that believe in him
who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered over for our
sins, and was raised up for our Justification? Were not Believers of old well
instructed in the Doctrine of free Remission of sins? O how kindly was David's
heart affected herewith, when he tasted the sweetness, and enjoyed the good, of
this Truth! Psalm. 32. 1, 2, 5.
O the blessedness, the happy goings on of him whose trespass is forgiven,
whose sin is covered! O how Blessed the man, to whom Jehovah imputes no
iniquity; and in whose spirit no deceit! Thou, O Jehovah, forgivest the
iniquity of my sin. To this agrees that of Isaiah; who brings in Jehovah
himself thus speaking; Isai. 43. 25. and 38. 17. and 6. 5, 6, 7.
I, I for my self, blot out thy transgressions, and remember not thy sin. And
the same Prophet does record it of Hezekiah, that he thankfully acknowledged
this; Thou, O Jehovah, have cast behind thy back all my sins: And that was the
same which Isaiah had experienced in his own case. Thus speaks the Prophet Mi^.
7. 18, 19, 20.
Micah, in an holy triumphing manner; Who is a mighty God like unto thee;
Forgiving iniquity, and passing by the transgression of the remnant of his
Inberitance! Thou will cast all their sins into the bottom of the Sea! And long
before him, this was revealed to Exodus 34. 6, 7.
Moses, when Jehovah proclaimed this to be part of his Name; He, who forgiving
iniquity, and trespass, and sin. How often was this Truth preached over in the
Sacrifices for Sin offerings, and in their Typical Washings and Purifications,
and such like; which held forth this, in the spiritual meaning of them? And
Deuteronomy. 33. 8, 10.
Christ appointed some, who in their Function by Office, were to teach Jacob
his Judgments, and Israel his Law; to show them what those Truths and Things
were, that were so shadowed out by those Figures. Thus also, was not the
Sanctification or Holiness of a Vovenant People The Declared Will of Jehovah
Aelohim? Lev. 20. 7, 8, 26.
Is not the Command express in Moses's Book, Ye shall sanctify your selves and
be holy for I Jehovah your God? And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them; I
Jehovah who sanctify. Ye shall set to it to be holy, and ye shall be holy, for
I holy. Has he not put that honor upon them, by calling them Saints? Deuteronomy. 33.
2, 3. and 26. 18, 19 Lev. 21. 6, 7, 8. Rev. 22. 19.
His Saints? An holy People in Covenant with him? How many ways did he preach
this Doctrine to them? Exodus 22. 31. Lev. 21. 6, 7. 2 Chronicles. 23. 6. and 35. 3.
Ezra. 8. 28. Deuteronomy. 14. 21. Isai. 62. 12. Dan. 12. 7. Deuteronomy. 7. 6. and 14. 2. and
26. 19. and 28. 9. Exodus 19. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 9. Exodus 12. 16. Lev. 23. 2, 4, 7, 8.
21, 24. 27, 35, 26. Numb. 28. 18, 25, 26. and 29. 1. etc. Exodus 31. 14. Nehem.
9. 14. Exodus 16. 23. Isai. 58. 13. Mat. 24. 15. Psalm. 74. 3. Ezra. 9. 8. Acts
6. 13, 14.
The Priests must be Holy; the Levites Holy; the Prophets Holy; the People
Holy; the Convocation Holy; the Sabbath Holy; the Place of Worship Holy; the
City Jerusalem is named Holy; the House Holy; the Mount Holy; the Land Holy;
the Garments Holy; the Tabernacle Holy; the Temple Holy; the Scriptures Holy;
the Law Holy; the Covenant Holy. Did not their whole Burnt-Offerings call upon
them to be sanctified throughout? their whole entire Spirit, and Soul, and
Body, to be kept unblamable? Did not the Precepts, to abstain from prohibited
Pollutions, and to use prescribed cleansings, in case of contracted
uncleanness, speak the same Truth? Was not the Law of the ten Words, a
comprehensive perfect Doctrine of all Holiness and Righteousness? And are not
the Sermons of the faithful Prophets, full of Dehortations from sin, and of
Exhortations to Holiness? b 1 Chronicles. 29. 3. 2 Chronicles. 36. 14. 2 Pet. 1. 18.
Psalm. 3. 4. Isai. 65. 11. and 66. 20. Zach. 2. 12. 1 Samuel 21. 5: Exods. 28. 2,
etc. and 29. 29. 29. and 31. 10, Ezekiel 42. 14. Exodus 29. 31. and 39. 1. 2 Chronicles.

11. 28. 30, 32. Romans 12. 1, 2.


If thou would be instructed in the Doctrine of the Resurrection: Mat. 22.
31, 3^. Exodus 3. 6.
Did not the LORD Christ himself prove, and teach this, out of the saying of
Jehovah Aelohim unto Moses, in the Bush, I am the God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but the God of
living. From whence he does infer, that though Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were
dead as to their body, yet they were still alive in their Spirit and Soul:
which bodies were parts of them, and therefore their bodies should in time rise
again. For, hereby it was evident, that there is another life after this is
ended, which those departed Saints, that were dead as to this life, had their
shares and parts in. So that, God not only was heretofore, but still now is,
and will be their God, after their death. The Bodies of Abraham, of Isaac, and
of Jacob shall rise, and therefore the bodies of the dead shall rise, they
shall live again, whereas now they are dead; and therefore they shall arise.
For, he is their God now they are dead; and therefore they shall live again;
though now they be dead. For God is not the God of the dead, who are so dead,
that they shall never live again. So that, he declaring himself to be their
God, ever since they were dead, it must unanswerably follow as convincingly
concluding, that their bodies shall live again. With what a clear judgment and
holy confidence does Job speak the same truth? Job 19. 25, 26, 27.
I know, said he, that my Redeemer living, and that the latter one shall rise
upon the dust. Therefore after I shall awake, and that the worms have dug
through this, yet in my fiesh I shall see God: Whom I shall behold to me, and
mine eyes have seen, and not a stranger: My reins are consumed within my bosom.
Was not Christ's Resurrection plaintly taught in the Psalm. 16. 8, 9, 10, 11.
Act. 2. 25-32. and 13. 34-37. 1 Cor. 15. 12, etc.
sixteenth Psalm? Where Christ himself does thus express his sure hope of
rising again from death the third day? My flesh shall dwell in considence, for
thou will not leave my soul to Sheol; Thou will not give thy gracious Saint to
see corruption? does not Peter so interpret this? And did not Paul so explain
and apply this? And if the head be raised, must not the members of that body,
to which the head is so nearly related, in union and in fellowship be raised
also? Has not David left behind him a lively Testimony of his firm belief of
this, in his day and time? When he set out the different apprehensions, that he
had concerning his expressed happiness in another better h^^ and world, from
what the unbelieving men of this World had? They, those mortal men of this
transitory World, they counted their good things to be their part and portion
here in this life. Psalm. 17. 14, 15. and ^9 14, 15.
I, says he, (as if he all past into this; this was his Belief; this was Hope;
this his Portion; this his Happiness; I) in justice shall view thy faces, shall
be satisfied, when I shall awake with thy image. There would be a day when he
should awake out of the dust of the Earth; from the sleep of death, when he
should see and know plainly and perfectly, and bear the Image of the Heavenly.
The Psalmist speaks of a Morning, when those that sleep in the dust of the
Earth, shall awake and rise. He believed, that Aelohim would redeem his soul
from the hands of Sheol; because he would receive him. A glorious Testimony of
his belief of a Resurrection. Dan. 12. 2.
Daniel in his Prophetic Spirit, speaks of a time, when many of them that
sleep in the dusty Earth shall awake: some unto everlasting life; and some unto
reproach, and shame everlasting. Which does also point to a Day of Judgment,
following of this Resurrection. Though Daniel in this place does not seem to
speak of the last general Resurrection, yet hereby insinuating the Doctrine
thereof. According as Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, is recorded by Jude 14.
Jude to have Prophetyed; Behold, the LORD has come with his holy ten
thousands, to do judgment against all, and convincingly to reprove all those
corrupt Worshippers of them, concerning all those their works of corrupt
worship, which they have impiously done, and of all their hards, which they
have spoken against the LORD, who sinners worshipping corruptly. The wicked
shall not stand up in judgment; as is declared in the first Psalm. 1. 5.
Psalm. Sinners will then fall and be condemned. This Dan. 7. 9, 10.
Daniel saw in that glorious Vision, wherein the Judge of all showed himself
sitting upon his Throne; having thousand times thousands ministering unto him;
and ten thousand times ten thousands standing before him: Where Judgment set
it self; and the Books were opened. Thus did Eccles. 12 7, 9, to 1^, 14.
Solomon close the Book of his Experiences of his folly, in seeking a happiness
in creature enjoyments, which were all vanities, having minded others of the
Day of their Death: A serious Meditation of which might prove, either a
prevention, or a remedying of this evil malady. The Dust shall return to the
Earth as it was, and the Spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

He leaves behind him, with those who came after him, these acceptable words of
Truth; the end of the Word of all has been heard, these same Aelohim, or
adored Almighties in Father, Son and holy Spirit, fear thou; and those
Commandments of his, keep thou; because, this, all that- Adam; or for this all
Adam, or the whole of that first Adam, or all of Man, or the whole Man; here is
all, the main of all our Religion, when we have spoken, and written, and
printed never so much about Religion, this is our grand spiritual, and eternal
concern, thine and mine, and every other man's: Because Aelohim will make to
come into Judgment, every Work, all Work, with all that is hidden, be it kept
never so secret from other men here; if good, and if evil, or whether good, and
whether evil.

Would thou who read this, have the Graces of the holy Spirit, in wrought
by him in the hearts of his Covenant people, to pass under the same
Scripture-examination? Did not the Believers, under the Old Testament
Dispensation, l obtain by Lot, like precious Faith with those under the New
Administration? (...) 2 Pet. 1. 1.
Heb. 11. throughout. and 12. 1, 2.
Has not the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, given us a large Catalogue
of such as were full of lively fruitful-working-Faith? Does he not give us an
Historical Account of the Faith of Abel, of Enoch, of Noah, of Abraham, of
Sarah, of Isaac, of Jacob, of Joseph, of Moses, of Gideon, of Barak, of
Sampson, of Jephthah, of David, of Samuel, and of the Prophets? And of the
wonderful Fruits and Effects of this Grace in them? How eminent was Abraham,
more especially, and particularly this way? Who has this honorable Title put
upon him, that he is called, The Romans 4. 11, 13, 16.
father of the faithful? Jam. 5. 10, 11.
Did not James in his Epistle Exhort the Christian Brethren to take for an
Example, of suffering of evil, and of long suffering, the Prophets, who have
spoken in the Name of the LORD? Behold, said he, we count them blessed that
endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job; and ye have seen the end of the
LORD, that the LORD is of so much Bowels, and Compassionate. How lively was
Romans 4. 18.
Abraham's Hope, who against Hope believed in Hope? Psalm. 42. 5, (...). and 7^.
5.
What a Man of Hope was David? Who that savours of, and that frames to his
renewed Spirit, can considerately read David's Psalms, and not see this Grace
often put forth into Act by him? How constant an expectant was he unto Jehovah
Aelohim, in variety of difficult and trying Cases? And how often does he call
earnestly upon others, to be much in this? The good whereof he had so often
proved, to his great satisfaction, and to his raised joy? How full of love was
his heart toward Christ, and toward the Law of Christ? So that, when he could
not express the whole of what he thus felt stirring within him, he gives a vent
to his heart, by his Exclamations, O how I Love! And by his longings after
more. O what an holy Fear had he of this glorious God: And O how much did
David's heart stand in awe of his Word!

Shall I speak of Duties? Was not this David the Man, Acts 13 22*
to whom God himself gave Testimony, and said, I have found David of Jesse, a
man after mine heart, who shall will-do all my wills? How full of Prayings,
Praisings, Singings, and of such like Religious Services, is that one Book of
Psalms?

Would thou hear somewhat of their Privileges? Does not James bear witness,
that Jam. 2. 23.
Abraham was called a friend of God? Genesis 5. 22, 24.
Did not Enoch walk with God? Had he not Testimony, that he pleased God? Genesis
6. 8, 9. Heb. 11. 6, 7.
Did not Noah find Grace in the Eyes of Jehovah? Did not he also walk with God?
Were not the believing ones of the Deuteronomy. 14. 1.
Israelites Sons and Daughters to Jehovah their Aelohim? Were not they made
partakers of the same Romans 9. 4.
Adoption and Love, by Faith in Christ? What a Romans 4. 19, 20, 21.
fullness of assurance of Faith had Abraham? How filled with joy and peace in
believing was Psalm. 4. 3, 6, 7. and 89. 15. 16, 17.
David, whilst he walked in the ways of Jehovah! O what gladness was there
often given into his heart! How often was the Light of the Faces of Jehovah
lifted up over him? In this Light did the gracious Saints of old walk on, who
were marvellously separated unto Jehovah Aelohim: In his Name were they glad
all the day, and in his Justice were they exalted; for he was the Glory of
their strength: They were satisfied with his favorable acceptance, and were
full with his blessings. Psalm. 148. 14.
The Sons of Israel were a people near him; Halelujah. Deuteronomy. 32. 9. Jer. 10. 16.
Jehovah's portion was his people even then: Jacob was the Line of his
Inheritance; they his portion, and he theirs, Psalm. 139. 17, 18.
Hear some of their holy Breathings: To me how precious are thy thoughts, O
God! How mightily increased are the sums of them! Would I tell them, they will
be more than the sand! I awake, and still I with thee. Psalm. 36. 7, 8, 9, 10.
and 31. 19.
How precious thy mercy, O Aelohim! And the Sons of Adam hope for safety in the
shadow of thy wings. They shall be plenteously moistened with the fatness of
thy house; and the stream of thy pleasures thou will give them to drink;
Because with thee the Well of life. In thy light we see light. Extend thy mercy
to them that know thee, and thy justice to the right of heart. How much thy
goodness which thou have laid up for them who fearing thee! Were not these
things Romans 15. 4.
forewritten for the use of Believers now? Hos. 12. 3. 4. Psalm. 66. 6.
When Jacob found Jehovah Christ in Bethel, did he not there speak with praying
Believers in after Ages? When Aelohim turned the Sea into Dry; When his people
passed through the River on foot, did not the Saints in after Generations there
rejoice in him? The Faithful then and the Faithful now are fellow servants, and
fellow-brethren, and joynt-heirs of the same promised Glory. Heb. 11. 13. 16,
Luke 16. 23. and 13. 28.
They confessed that they were Guests and Strangers upon Earth; they were
desirous of, and sought a better; the heavenly Country: Therefore God is not
ashamed of them, to be called their God. Happy they who are in Abraham's bosom;
who are taken into intimate society, conjunction, love, and glorious fellowship
with him. How full of heavenly joys is that blessed State of Christ's Spiritual
Kingdom; which is a Being with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and all the Prophets!
Should not those who are fellow members with them of the same body, under that
one Head, the LORD Jesus Christ, rejoice together? O how delightful is it to be
with them in the Spirit! The Church of Believers of old was then more in her
Gal. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Infancy, she is now grown up; they now have all their Veils of Figures and
Types taken off, and they see and enjoy Christ face to face: They are brought
into the light of the Divine Majesty which is in Christ, clothed in our Flesh.
Christ is now no longer hidden to and from them under shadows; these former
Coverings are now removed, and the clear Light is not kept away: They are now
able to look into the bottom of Moses's Ministry: They now so behold the Glory
of the LORD, as to be possessed of the heavenly things themselves; having a
clear view of Christ, who is the Image of the invisible God, the brightness or
resplendence of his Glory, and the Engraven Form of his Person. There they
receive their Reward, which God does graciously give unto his Servants the
Prophets, and to his Saints, and to all that fear his Name.

Having thus at large manifested it to be according to the Word, that there was
a Covenant of Grace under the Old Testament-administration; and that the
privileges of the LORD's Vovenant People, even then, were the same for kind,
with Believers now, though differently dispensed. I shall here further
discover, that the Seventh-day Sabbath it self was some ways a sign of this;
thus improving this Expression and Meditation to a right useful purpose, which
some Adversaries do wrongfully pervert to an ill end. Thus they object:

The Seventh Day-Sabbath was a sign of their Sanctification, to whom it was
given; and Exodus 31. 13, 17. E^^k. 20. 12.
therefore of a Ceremonial nature, and not given to all men. These to whom the
Sabbath was given, to them it was a sign of their present Sanctification; but
it was no sign of the present Sanctification of all people over the whole
World: And therefore, it was never given to all the people of the whole World,
but only unto God's people Israel: And therefore of no Natural Consideration,
therefore Ceremonial. Thus it is objected,

This Objection is like to have the more satisfactory Answer, if there be a due
clear distinguishing of the several things which are contained in it; and a
proper Application of each Particular, unto the present matter in hand; that so
the understanding Reader and the spiritual Discerner may see that way plain
before him, which may directly lead him into the Mind and Will of Christ, and
he may the better learn the Truth as it is in Jesus. I purpose therefore to
distinguish of Signs, of Sanctification, of the Law of the Ten Words, of
Peoples, of Ceremonials, of Giving this Law of the Ten Words.

Signs are either natural Signs, such as have a force of signifying from the
created Nature of that thing which is the Sign. Thus the Heavenly Luminaries
are Signs of diverse things particularly, with respect Compare Genesis 1. 14. and
14 Psalm. 104. 19. with Lev. 23. 2, 3. and Numb. 28. 2. 9, 10. Mognadim and
Mognadei. (...) est tempus Statutum, aut condictum, Conventus solemnis, Caetus,

scilicet vel tempus ubi vel quando aliquid fieri debeat. in Niphal. (...),
Convenire, Congregari, dicto scil. and Statuto loco, vel tempore.
to the Seventh-day Sabbath. There is the same word in the Original. A diligent
Observer with the eye, of the motions of those Luminaries, may see that set
Times and fit Seasons for solemn Assembling, and for Instituted Worship are
directed to, and pointed at by these shining Lights to measure out
Daily-Evening and Morning, and Weekly-Seventh-Day-Sabbath Opportunities, for
our direction in Working and in Resting; or the conserving of the orderly
course and state of this World, in the required matters of appointed Services,
due from Man, to his Creators and Makers throughout all the Ages, all the days
of this Earth: Which is also put into a Genesis 8. 72. Jer. 31. 35, 36. and 33.
20-26.
Promise. And the Covenant of Grace is confirmed by these natural Signs. If
these be Signs of created Nature, of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, after the
six foregoing working Days, in the same Week; and this Seventh day-Sabbath have
foundation in created Nature; and both these be by the Ordination and
appointment by the All wise Creator; then (this being so established by an
unchangeable Law of pure Primitive Creation;) the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath
Genesis 1. 14. and 2. 1, 2, 3. Exodus 31. 16, 17.
must continue as long as those Luminaries do continue to be such a Sign. Which
Seventh-day Sabbath is also a sign of Aelohim's creating the World, of Heaven
and of Earth, and of all things therein, in the six foreging Days; and of his
Resting on the Seventh, which is the last Day of the Week. This being expressly
rendered by himself as the Reason, why it is called a Sign.

Or Signs are instituted: which do signify somewhat by Virtue of some special
appointment, by the only Supreme Sovereign LORD and Lawgiver, Jehovah Christ.
Numb. 28. 9, 10. Heb. 9. 24. and 10. 1.
Thus the Typical Sacrifices, and such Ceremonial Figures, as were after wards
annexed for a time, to the weekly Seventh day-Sabbath, were Signs and Shadows,
Types and Figures. These were significative of a Christ, who was then under
that Dispensation to come, to be born of a Virgin: So they were perfected and
accomplished in and by Christ; when God was thus manifested in the Flesh; when
Christ was then born of the Virgin Mary: But the weekly Seventh day-Sabbath had
its created Being before this; and distinct from this, and so continued after
this did pass into its Antitype. This weekly Seventh-day Sabbath does stand
firm established for ever, Genesis 2. 1, 2, 3. Exodus 20. 8-10. and Deuteronomy. 5. 12-1^.
in the Word, and in Nature.

If the Objector, or any other do further affirm, that the weekly
Seventh-day Sabbath, is still a significant Sign by Institution; and that this
significativeness is a part of it. If they mean, that it is thus a shadow of
that Spiritual Eternal Rest; that Sabbatism, Heb. 4. 9, 10. Col. 2. 16, 17.
Isal. 56. 1*8. and 66. 22, 23, 24.
which does yet remain for the people of God in the Heavens; let them look well
to their Scripture-proofs for this; but I shall not contend with them about it;
it rather making for the cause I undertake. For the Type must continue till the
Antitype come. Let these men therefore keep the Seventh-day Sabbath till they
get to Heaven; if ever they come there: and then and there they will know more
clearly and fully. If any further Typical significativeness be pretended and
urged, when I understand what it is, it is like to pass under Examination and
Consideration with me. Observe here, that Gal. 3. 19.
the Typical Signs superadded unto the Law of the ten Words, did establish that
Law in the natural unchangeable Holiness and Righteousness of it: Only by
Institution they did put some further thing into it, during that former
Dispensation of Grace.

Or they are notifying-testifying-certifying-Signs.

By these, somewhat is made known and witnessed unto them, unto whom these are
given from the LORD for some particular use and end. Exodus 31. 12, 13, 26, 17.
Ezekiel. 20. 12, 20.
Thus the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath is a Sign. Consider here, the Law of the
Seventh-day Sabbath, as proclaimed and given by Jehovah Christ, put into a
Covenant of Grace, (as have been proved:) Thus, Exodus 31. 1^*
it was, is and will be a Sign: For there is no particular Verb of definite
time expressed in one of the places, in the Original, to determine when, and
how long, so as if then and there it were to be cut off, and so cease to be a
Sign: For it takes in all the parts of Time, all the spaces of Duration; it has
been a Sign; it is now a Sign, and it will be a Sign. And in the Ezekiel. 20. 12,
20.
other place, the latter Verse does take in the past Time: which they render
^uturely: In the former Verse it is Infinitive and Indefinite. Thus the
Seventh-day Sabbath is a Sign between Jehovah and his Vovenant People, that
they are a separate sanctified people; a special token of his distinguishing
kindness unto such as are inwardly in Covenant with him: and some ways a
Privilege, even to those who are as yet but outwardly in Covenant with him; as
it brings them under the Instituted Ordinances of that Day. The
Seventh-day Sabbath in a Documental Sign, giving Institution in this Pledge of
Christ's Love, who having been the Creator, is the Redeemer too, and will be
sanctification to his Vovenant People, who are in a special manner his new
created, peculiarly redeemed, and separatedly sanctified Ones. As this
Seventh-day Sabbath has its Nature, Institution, Use and End, put into
Scripture-Revelation, so it is a peculiar Sign to those, unto whom this
Word-discovery is made; especially, when to their inner man; and will be such
to the Worlds end, to all and every of those who are so choicely favored. It
is a witnessing evidencing Sign to know this, where Spiritual-Worshippers are
Right Sabbath-keepers.

Were there a more Universal-holy-through growing-Conformity, in Knowledge and
in Obedience, to this and to every other just, holy, and good Law of Jehovah
Aelohim, experience would prove to spiritual senses, what Faith is to believe
from Word-Revelation, that the Weekly Seventh day-Sabbath would be such a Sign
as would (the holy Spirit of the LORD, witnessing together with a renewed
Spirit in the Saints;) point out unto them, and declare in them, that such are
some of Jehovah's peculiar people in special Covenant with them, (like as 1
John 3. 14. Gal. 5. 22, 23.
the holy Fruits of the regenerating Spirit, are such a notifying-testifying,
certifying Sign of translation from death to life; This is a Sign which does
still continue. O who will give, that there were more of this evidencing Sign,
(as to the natural Seed of such of Israel of old, as were spiritualized and new
born; so to the Psalm. 24. 3*6.
Spiritual Seed of Israel now:) that there is a mutual convenanting and
communion between Jehovah Aelohim, and such a people of his, that they might
know him to be theirs, and themselves to be his! This is a Sign that is still
put into a Promise; and will even now, and in after days be made good to right
Spiritual Observers of Jehovah's weekly Seventh-day Sabbath! A Sign to know
(here is one great End and special Use of this Sign, which is also a
lasting-standing continued one) that Jehovah does sanctify such, and is their
God. Whoever he be that can well evidence an Universal Obedience and Conformity
to an whole Christ, and his whole Word, particularly as to his due sanctifying
of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath of Jehovah his God (which would much
influence and operate upon all other Religion:) would have Aelohim's
Covenanted-Love more manifested to him, by the encouraging Sign; it would be a
token to him for this, and for much other good. Psalm. 92. throughout. Isal. 56.
1-8. Mar. 2 27.
It is promised, and it would be enjoyed, actually enjoyed for the present,
even now; and this Spiritual Rest with Christ in God here, would by improving
of Mystical-membership, in relation to the Glorified Ones above, be some
beginning of that eternal Sabbatism in Heaven. Thus a Natural Duty is sometimes
made a Sign of a Spiritual Privilege.

Against this, it has been further objected, that Circumcision is called Genesis
17. 7, 11, ^2, 13.
a Sign of the Covenant between Jehovah Aelohim, and his Covenant people, in
their Generations; for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto them. And so
is, Exodus 31. 13,
the Seventh-day Sabbath, called a Sign between Jehovah and his people,
throughout their Generations, which they were to observe throughout their
generations, for an everlasting Covenant between him and the Sons of Israel; it
a Sign for ever. And therefore they were to cease together.

For Answer to this in the General: Here is a Fallacy of Composition and
Division; by taking some things severally and apart, which are to be taken
conjoynedly: and by taking other things conjoynedly, which are to be taken
apart. Some things here, would be well divided and severed, which are ill
joined; and other things would be well joined, which are ill divided. Here the
divided sense must be separated from the compounded; and the compounded sense
from the divided. There is another Fallacy in the comparing of these two,
Circumcision, and the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath. Because it is not of the same
thing in the same manner, according to the same part, to the same person and
thing, in the same time. And there is a translation from one kind to another.
Though in some thing these two, do more generally agree; yet in other things
they do specially differ: which does discover both a deceit and a defect, a
confusedness and a captiousness in the Objector. This will further open it self
by a more particular distinct considering of what does follow. All Signs are
not mutable or changeable Signs, to end with the Old Testament Dispensation.
Genesis 1. 14. and 8. 22. Mat. 24. 29, 30. Jer. 31. 35, 36. and 33. 20-20. Psalm
72. 5, 17. and 89 36, 37. Genesis 9. 13.
Sun, Moon and Sta^* have been, are, and will be, to the end of this World,
natural and instituted Signs. These Luminaries are Witnesses of God's
faithfulness in his Covenant, to Generation of Generations. Thus also are Day
and Night such a Sign. The Rainbow, whenever it does appear, is to be a Sign
to the Worlds end; a Sign or Token of God's Covenant with mankind; that he will
no more drown this whole Earth with Water. Jehovah's weekly
Seventh-day Sabbath, has been already manifested, to be both a Natural,
Instituted, and notifying Sign. Such an immutable unchangeable Sign, as that,
Jehovah Aelohim will in no Generation, not even under this New Testament
Administration put an end to his sanctifying of his people. Whereas
Circumcision was a Typical, Mutable, Changeable Sign; Gal. 5. 1, 2, 3. Col. 2.
11, 12. Romans 28, 29. and 11. 12.
which passed into it more spiritual and heavenly Antitype, when the Old
Testament Dispensation was brought to its accomplish perfected End. All Signs
are not laid aside under the new Dispensation. The Signs mentioned before, even
the Luminaries Day and Night, the Rain bow: So also the Seventh-day Sabbath
were Signs under the Old, and do still continue to be Signs under the New
Testament admi^^^^ration. Such a Sign Circumcision is not, as to that of the
Foreskin of the Flesh; for this does cease. So that Circumcision was another
kind of Law, than the Natural Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath. The Type and
Figure of fleshy Circumcision was Temporary and Changeable. This Sign which was
the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, did belong to other sorts of Laws; to the
Ceremonial Law, as it was Typical, Figuring and Shadowing; and so does widely
differ in the whole kind from the Natural Law of the ten Words (whereof this of
the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath is one.) Which is Psalm 19. 7, 8, (...). Psalm.
11^. throughout. Mat. 5. 17, 18, 19. Romans 3. 31. Luke 16. 17, 29, 31. Jam. 2.
8-12. Exodus 31. 17, 18. and 34. 1, 27, 28. Psalm. 93. 5. compared with the rest
of that Psalm; and with the 92 Psalm. Psalm. 111. 7, 8.
a standing unchangeable Rule of Life, uniform, and always one and the same.
They were written once and a second time in Tables of Stone, by Jehovah Christ,
which does show amongst somewhat else, their renewed durableness. It was the
Writing of Aelohim; and the Record of them is to remain for ever. So that, a
due difference must be put, between this weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, as it is
such a standing established Rule of Life, in created Nature, one of the ten
Words; and between some Typical Institutions, and superadded Rites, and
Figuring Shadows, afterward annexed to this Sabbath. Deuteronomy. 13. 14.
There is a plain evident difference between these two sorts of Laws. Let Moses
be heard concerning this in what he said to the Israelites; Jehovah declared
unto you his Covenant, which he commanded you to do, the ten Words (observe
these are distinctly expressed, and severed from the Figuring Laws) and he
wrote them upon two Tables of Stone; and Jehovah commanded me at that time, to
teach you Statutes and Judgments, that ye may do them in the Land whither ye
are going over to possess it. May we not discern here that Moses does put a
clear difference between the Laws of the ten Words, which were publicly,
openly spoken and given by the LORD Christ in his own Royal Person from his
Father to all the people, and were written with the Finger of his own Spirit,
between these, and those other shadowy Ordinances, which were privately spoken
to Moses, only and by him, and by his Ministry brought to the people and
written by him? These figuring Statutes admitted of a change, and yet the Law
of the Seventh day Sabbath does remain unchangeable; a perpetual Law. And if
any think, that there is yet further any thing significative annexed to this
day by Jehovah's Institution, of Christ's second coming, and of the heavenly
Sabbatism, then let that so far, when any will clear it up from Scripture,
stand firm and unmoved till that time. If the naturalness and self evidence of
the Law of the ten Words were to receive a change, because of superadded
Institutions, fitted to that Dispensation; particularly as to Signs; then the
naturalness and self evidene of every one of them, by this kind of arguing,
were to receive a change. Was there not a Law for Fringes, by the Institution
of Jehovah Aelohim himself, throughout the Generations of the Israelites; for
this end Numb. 15. 37-41.
that they might see and remember all his Commandments? This outward Rite was a
memorative Sign, or a religious Sign, to help their memories, and to further
their sanctification. To lead them unto a continual remembrance and practice of
all the Law of the ten Words. Thus also their Exodus 13. 9, 16. Deuteronomy. 6. 8. and
11. 18. Mat. 23. 5.
Phylacteries were for a Sign upon their Hand, and for a Memorial between their
eyes, that Jehovah's Law might be in their Mouth. This was a Typical Memorial,
or Monument. Which is the proper meaning of the Original Word. By this outward
Sign Jehovah Aelohim would have them to apply all their serious study, and all
their careful practice, unto the keeping of all and every of the Laws of the
ten Words. All the outward Rites of the Psalm. 74. 9. Heb. 10. 1. and 9. 10. 13,
14.
Ceremonial Laws were Signs, typical Figures, and significant Shadows,
instituted of God, as Seals and Pledges to assure Believers of Christ, and of
those good things which his Faithful, Obedient, Perswadable ones, have in and
by him. A due difference therefore should be put between Signs and Figures,
Signs and Shadows: For although in the general, and in common, there be
somewhat of a Sign in Figures and Shadows, yet every Sign is not a Figure and
Shadow, but has somewhat particularly specially distinct: A Figure does set out
and foreshew some Truth, Duty, Grace or Privilege, which is afterward more
clearly to be revealed, though even then to be known, believed, done, acted and
enjoyed: A Shadow does give some dark resemblance, and it is a betokener of a
Body which is to come in the place thereof, and is in the appointed season to
be exhibited: whereas a Sign, as it does in some instances point out somewhat,
which is yet afterward to be looked for; so in other cases it does assure
Believers of somewhat that is already gone and performed: and in somewhat else
it may stand and be joined together with that which is signified thereby, and
be of special usefulness at one and the same present time. The Ark wherein was
nothing but only the ten Words in two Tables; and the propitiatory Covering
which was over the Ark were Types, Figures and Shadows of Christ: So that if
Ceremonial Annexes should make void the Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath, that
way of arguing would lay aside and make void all the other Laws of these ten
Words. Sanctification, is either that which was natural, and concreated at the
first, and is now restored to and inwrought in some, a spiritual
transforming-Sanctification, whereby 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13. Jude 1. 1
Cor. 6. 11. and 1. 30. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3, 4. Romans 1. 4. John 17. 17, 19. Act. 26.
18. Heb. 2. 11. and 10. 10. 13.
the LORD does regenerate and renew his People; by the Power and Grace of his
holy Spirit. The Seventh-day Sabbath duly observed, and well filled up (having
a suitable growing knowledge of, and obedience to, the rest of the revealed
Will of God, summarily comprehended in the ten Words) would be a
notifyingtestifying-certifying Sign of this Sanctification: as has been shown.

Numb. 6. 11. 2 Chronicles. 29. 5, 17, 19. Acts 21. 24, 26. Heb. 9. 13.
Or it is a Ritual, Ceremonial Sanctification; whereby (under the former
Dispensation:) in the use of some outward Rites and Ceremonies, some persons
and things, which had some ways contracted some uncleanness, were sanctified or
purified, which were typical and significative of in ward spiritual
transforming Sanctification, and of real, inwrought Holiness and Purity: Of
this sort of Signs were their Blood sprinklings, their Water-washings, and such
like. (Baptism Romans 6. 3-6. Tit. 3. 5. John 3. 6.
is such a Sign under the new Dispensation.) Thus the weekly Seventh-day
Sabbath, if it be taken under this consideration, as it had under the Old
Testament Administration, diverse Ceremonial Laws added unto it, both for
preparation before, and for cleansing in and after, in some cases; in this
respect, that which was superadded to it, was a Sign of Sanctification to the
Israelitish Church, beyond any other people, unless others came in and embraced
the same true Religion; and then there was one Law for the Israelite, and for
the Stranger: Exodus 12. 45, 47, 48, 49. Deuteronomy. 4. 7, 8.
When the Forreigner or Sojourner did leave the Worship of Idols, and other
heathenish practices, of the Infidel World. Thus, Exodus 19. 10, 14. compared
with the 20 Chapter.
that people were enjoined some out ward ceremonial Sanctifyings, for the
reviving of the Law of the ten Words. But these Figures and Shadows made no
real change upon the fourth Word; the Law of the Seventh day Sabbath; as
neither did they upon any other of the ten Words.

Or Sanctification, is the separating of somewhat from a common use, and
destinating and setting of it apart, for some special, singular, holy Use.
Exodus 29. 44. Lev. 21. 15, 23. and 22. 9, 16. Gal. 1. 15. Jer. 1. 5. Luke 1.
15. Exodus 31. 13. Lev. 20. 7. and 21. 8. and 22. 32. 2 Timothy 2. 21.
Thus in several Scriptures some persons were Sanctified; as the Administrators
about holy things; the Israelitish people; which is also applied to the chosen
Vessels. Sanctification in this sense, was applied to the Tabernacle, Temple,
Altar, Instruments, Meats, and to other things. Genesis 2. 2, 3. Exodus 20. 8, 11.
It is also applied to the Seventh-day Sabbath: which Aelohim did sanctify for
holy Uses (and to no other day of the whole week, as such;) at the first
Creation, according to the Nature of its Essence, in the order of its being,
before those after superadded Ceremonies and Shadows. So that, in this sense,
Act. 14. 15-18. and 17. 2, 3, 22-34. Romans 2. 14. 15.
Right Reason would inform all reasonable men and women in the World, that the
Seventh, the last day in every week has a concreated adaptness to be a day of
holy Rest, for the worship of their Maker; and that they themselves should be
an holy people, separated to the service of the holy God: Ezekiel. 20. 12, 20, and
37. 28. Exodus 19. and 20. chapter Ephesians. 5. 26. John 17. 17, 19. Heb. 13. 12. Romans
15. 16.
Though his Church and People are thus sanctified and severed from other
people, by Jehovah in a peculiar, especial manner, his Elect yet more
especially.

As for the Law of the ten Words, Exodus 19. 20, 24, 25 Chapters. Romans 3. 1, 2.
and 9. 4, 5.
if we look upon it in its superadded Ceremonies, and some such other
intermixed Annexes; so it had somewhat peculiarly belonging to the Israelitish
Church, and people in Moses's time: and to those of other Nations, who were
pros^lited to that Ceremonial Typical way under that Administration: Whereas we
under the New Testament, have another manner of Dispensation of the same Grace
in a more spiritual, heavenly, glorious way. Although this Typical Figuring
part made no real change even of old upon the Law of the ten Words. If this be
considered, as it is, an absolute and perfect Rule of Life, comprehending all
duties whatsoever; and being that Image and Samplar, unto which all mankind, at
the beginning, in their representative Head, were created in Wisdom, in
Holiness, and in Righteousness, which was afterward promulgated and proclaimed
by Jehovah Christ, with a Covenant of Grace intermingled; so it is that Law of
Nature, which enlightened Intellect or right Reason does teach; some notions
whereof are still retained, even now in man's fallen corrupted estate. There
are some Seeds of those Eternal Truths, and Things; some common principles of
good and of evil; both for the knowledge of God, and of his Service, and for
those Duties, which we owe unto our selves, and unto our Neighbors. This is
born and bred with reasonable man: every one does carry it about with him;
every one coming into this World, is enlightened therewithal: which Remnants of
this Law, do serve for many good uses and purposes in civil converse amongst
men, and for some other ends. In this sense the Law of the ten Words,
particularly that of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, is given to the whole
World. All mankind had it, in their common representative, the first Adam,
clearly, fully, perfectly; and have still some Relics of it left within them,
by the Law of Nature, in the Light of Reason, demonstrated by concreated
Principles; the foundations and grounds of which, are knowable by Humane
Intellect. In this sense the Law of the ten Words; particularly that of the
weekly Seventh day Sabbath, is given to the whole World; all mankind had it in
their common representative, and have still some indwelling Notions of it left
within them. This Law, in some parts of the natural Duties of it, may yet by
the Institution of Jehovah Aelohim be a sign of some mystical thing signified;
which does make any real change in the natural Duty it self, this standing
still in its due force, as before; but it may have something further
significant in it by the LORD's special appointment. As the State, Duty and
Privilege of Genesis 2. 18, 20-24.
Marriage in the fifth and seventh Words; Instituted in Paradise, Ephesians. 5.
23-33.
does figure the great Mystery of that Mystical Union, which is between Christ
and his Church.

People come next to be considered. Psalm. 62. 8. Prove. 29. 18. Isal. 62. 10.
Luke 2. 10. Act. 21. 28. and 26. 17. and 28. 17. Heb. 5. 3. and 7. 5, 11, 27.
and 9. 19. 2 Pet. 2. 1. Jude 5. Deuteronomy. 33. 3, 19 Judge. 5. 14. Ezekiel. 2. 3. Acts

People are sometimes in some Scriptures, more especially taken for the
Israelites, and the Jews. These are sometimes in the plural Number called
Peoples. This People had some peculiar Privileges beyond other Peoples;
particularly, as to the kingly manner of proclaiming and revealing the Law of
the ten Words, more in their sight and hearing at Mount Horeb; and as to some
things afterward annexed to it; which was the Pattern in the Mount. Thus
Jehovah's holy Sabbath was made known unto the Israelites after another manner,
than to Neh. 9. 13, 14. Psalm. 147. 19, 20.
other Nations. Whilst they walked by this Rule of Life, they were a Deuteronomy. 4.

wise and prudent people: But when they transgressed greatly, they were a
rebellious people. The Israelitish people so constituted as it then was, are
called, Exodus 6. 7. and 19. 5, 6. Deuteronomy. (...) 20. and 7. 7. and 27. 9. and 29.

The people of God: The people of the God of Abraham. These had some
distinguishing favors in that day.

People, in some other Scriptures, are some times taken, for all Nations
besides Israel, and besides those other Lands, who were brought over to the
true Religion. Thus the Uncircumcised Nations, strangers from the Covenant of
God, Indels, profane and ungodly, they also are called Genesis 49. 10. Exodus 15.

People; and the People of the Earth; and the abominable People: Though these
whilst such, did not share in choice special Church Priviledges, yet some ways
they had the Law of the ten words (and amongst others, the Law of the weekly
Seventh-day Sabbath, particularly:) As this Law of the Decalogue is the natural
concreated Law. There are diverse In a Treatise called, The Court of the
Gentiles, by T. G. (...). 270, 271.
Records in Humane Authors, for those to search after, who are curious in such
Disquisitions, which do evidence, that the Seventh-day Sabbath was generally
observed by the Pagans, as the weekly Holy Day. The remaining Relics of their
Natural Life and Right Reason, dictating the equity of this Law; which also
might be traditioned down to them: The Pagan Idolaters, so far conforming to
the Laws and Practice of the Church of God. They acknowledged the Seventh-day
as more holy, and owned its Rest from labor: And the Ethnic Doctors in this
way of teaching, would Philosophize only on the Seventh-day Sabbath. Then did
they frequent their Temples: and then some of them sung their Hymns to their
Idol God. These Precepts of the Decalogue, were the Law of our Creation; they
are the natural Dictates of the Humane Essence, in its rational Exercise,
ingraft Notions, concreated Characters, wrought into the essential composition
of our natural Being; the Sanction whereof has more or less a living impression
in the Humane Existence. The very order of the Days in the first created Week,
did teach the observation in the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath; and made it a part
of the Law of Nature. Aelobim's Method in the Creatures Production, which did
so dispose of his Works, and of his Rest, has confirmed this Order in laying
its foundation in created Beings. And Psalm. 19. throughout. 1 Timothy 2. 12, 13.
Mar. 10. 6, 7, 8. (...). 20. 8-11. Genesis 2. 2, 3.
this is a very forcible way of right arguing, used by the LORD himself in his
Word, in diverse cases. The six forgoing Days of the Week for Work; and the
seventh, the last Day of the Week for Rest. These were from the beginning of
the Creation Designed; they were thus originally appointed by the Creator
himself, and so laid as a standing Law upon the Rational Creatures. The natural
equity whereof, man's Representative in Adam readily submitted, and subjected
and conformed to; there being both ground and evidence enough in the things
themselves, thus made; and Light and Reason enough in the Humane Intellect of
Rational Beings, to discern and to improve this to the very same ends. Both
these had Primitive concreated self-evidence; however sin now have darkened and
defaced things. The indication of these Duties were at the first, true, real,
sufficient: Some worn Letters of which original Ingraving, are yet still
remaining to be read: These Laws resulting from the Humane Nature; and from
that Relation which created Man, does stand in, to his creating Maker: The
Obligation which does arise from hence, must continue as long as the Humane
Nature does continue. For it is Essential to our Formation and constitution as
we are reasonable men and women; and so is unchangeably binding. And he that
would make any one Law of pure primitive Nature alterable, does thereby, though
it may be not designedly, yet eventually, heave at the overturning of all the
Laws of Nature: This Primigenial Holiness and Righteousness in created Man,
bearing exact conformity to the holy Righteous Nature of creating Aelobim. And
Mat. 5. 17. Romans 2. 14, 15, 16.
Christ's coming was not to dissolve any one Law of the Decalogue, or any thing
of the Obligation to any Law therein, but to maintain these Laws, and their
obliging. All mankind, brought under convincing demonstrations, from
distinguishing taste of the difference of good and of evil, should acknowledge
all and every of those holy, just, and good Laws to have a clear congruity to
their Natures. Who of all mankind, that has the due exercise of rational
abilities, but must acknowledge that we ought, to love the LORD our God, with
all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our mind; and to love our
neighbor as our selves? On which two Commandments hang all the Laws and the
Prophets. For which we have the Authority Mat. 22. 26-40.
of the LORD Jesus Christ himself. He being the Lawgiver and Law-Interpreter
too.

Mat. 1. 21. Acts 18. 10. Heb. 2. 17. and 7. 27. and 13. 12. Rev. 10. 11.
Further yet, People in some Scriptures, are the Elect and Believers: Whether
of Jews or of Gentiles: Who are also absolutely called, People. The Nations
which shall be converted to the Faith of the Gospel, renouncing Antichrist, and
his corrupt principles and practices, are some of this people. These, both
under the Old and New Testament Administration, had this Law of the ten Words
written, not only in the Scripture Revelation, but also on the two Tables of
the Mind and Heart, by the holy Spirit. 2 Cor. 3. 3. Jer. 31. 31-34. Heb. 8.
8-13. and 10. 16, 17.
Thus is the Law of the ten Words, specially and distinguishingly given to new
Creatures; and thus it will be renewed in the purer Churches in the later Days.
In this sense, the Rule and Direction for renewed Holiness, and for the Works
and Duties of Grace, and of Sanctification, is called, The new Law, or
Commandment, the same with the Old, only 1 John 2. 7, 8.
renewed.

Next of Ceremonials. These are sometimes called Ephesians. 2. 15. Hebr. 7. 16. and
9. 9, 10.
The Law of Degrees, placed in external Rites, and by some such other
Expressions: These Rites were used about outward fleshie things; such as Meats,
Drinks, Washings, and the like. These, so far as they were Typical, Figuring,
and Representative, of a Christ who was then to come, to be born of a Virgin,
and to shed his blood; were perfected and accomplished in Christ, when he was
so born, and had so suffered, was risen and had ascended. And they did
peculiarly belong to the People under the former dispensation. Of this nature
were some Ceremonies, annexed to the Weekly-seventh-day Sabbath. By these holy
rites, the Church and People of God under that administration, were Esther. 3.
8. Ephesians. 2. 12.
differenced and discerned, as a People holy to God, distinct from other
profane Nations. An Old Testament Ceremony is set out in Scripture by Flesh,
a carnal Ordinance, an handwriting of death, an Element of the World, weak and
egene, an Exemplar of Heavenly things, unstable; An Intolerable Yoke. A shadow;
and such like; Which are not properly applicable to the Seventh-day Sabbath, as
such: If any say, it is an Exemplar of the Sabbatism in Heaven, and so a
Ceremonious Type: Let then the Type stand, as I have said, till we can come at
the Antitype. Ceremonies sometimes, do set out Gal 3, 23. 24. 25. Colos 2 14.
Hebr. 10. 1. and 9, 24.
the inward spiritual things, Graces, Duties, Privileges, which they did
signify and teach. A Ceremony has been, and is, a Sign of somewhat that is
natural; and so they have been annexed to natural Spiritual Duties. As Numb.
28. 1-8.
Evening and Morning worshipping of God, had diverse Ceremonial Observances.
Numb. 28. 9, 10.
So the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath. Thus for Parents to give up themselves
their Sons and Daughters to God, is a natural duty. Yet this duty has Mat. 28.
19. Acts 16. 25, 33.
Baptism even now, under the new Testament-Ministration annexed to it. Those
things which are still of a concreated Spiritual Nature, Romans 12. 1. 1 Pet. 2.
5, Hebr. 7, 8, 9, 10, Chapters.
Were, are, and will be a duty. The Epistle to the Hebrews is a
Gospel-Exposition hereupon. Though Multitudes of these Ceremonies were
superadded to the Law of the ten Words, as an Evangelical Explanation and
Interpretation of them, yet this does not alter the true real nature of any of
these ten words, which are always a standing unalterable Rule of holy Righteous
living.

As for the giving of this Law of the Ten words: If this Law be considered
Exodus 20. 1, 1, Deuter. 4. 45. and 5. 5. 6, etc. Jerem. 7. 22, 23. and 11. 4.
As promulgated and proclaimed at Mount Sinai by Jehovah Aelohim; thus there
was somewhat in it which was a peculiar gift to the Israelitish Church, and
those who were proselyted to it, beyond any other People. As for the time when
he brought them out of Egyptian bondage, Ezekiel. 20. 10, 11, 12 Deuteronomy. 4. 10, 15.
and 5. 2, etc. etc. 29. 1. Malac. 4 4. Lev. 26. 46. and 27. 34. Nehem. 9. 13,
14 Deuteronomy. 4. 45, 46. Numb. 36. 13.
so for the place, the Desert; Jehovah gave them this, in their Wildernesses
condition. At Mount Horeb, or Mount Sinai, in an Enemies Land, that of the
Amorites and of the Moabites. Thus also, Deuter. 4. 9-13. and 5. 3, 4, 5.
For the persons: They were those of that age, who were then alive at that
place who understood the Hebrew, to whom He gave this Law. So for the
subservient Administrator, by whose hand Jehovah Christ gave this Law to them:
Who was Moses, there was Moses's a Ministry used in it. Hence it is called the
Law of Moses; Moses wrote this Law in a Book. Exodus 19. 18, 19. and 20. 18.
Hebr. 12. 18-21
Also for the John 1. 17. Exo. 32. 15. and 34. 29. Joh. 7. 19. Act 6. 14. Neh.
8. 1. Dan. 9. 11. 13. Joh. 7. 23. Act. 13. 39. and 15. 21. 2 Cor. 3. 15. 2 Chronicles. 25. and in many other places.
manner of proclaiming: With Trumpet, Thunder, Fire, Audible Immediate voice of
Aebolim himself; and such like. And thus too, for the solemn imbodying of an
whole nation into a Church State. These and some such other like, were the
peculiar Circumstances of that Promulgation in that day. Yet is the Law still
the same now; The LORD Jesus Christ does speak unto us, even now, in this Law
of the ten Words. What God did speak unto Moses, Compare Mar. 12. 26. with Mat.
22. 31.
He spoke unto others in the days of Christ's flesh, when born of the Virgin
Mary: which was hundreds of Years after. And Romans 15. 4.
these ten Words were written unto us. If this Law be considered as the Law of
nature, so it was given to all c Exodus 19. 3, 4. etc. Deuter 7. 6, 7, 8,
mankind, in Representative Adam: As I have declared. If it be looked on as
Inwritten in the mind and Heart of the Regenerate by the Holy Spirit; Thus it
is peculiarly given to new Creatures. As also I have manifested.

Thus I have labored to clear and to distinguish, that which the Objector did
f Compare Mat. 22. 24. with Mar. 12. 19.
tumble into a confused heap, and then from thence he drew wrong inferences: He
should better have bethought himself, that, when he would speak of the nature
and Essence of a thing, (as particularly of a Sign or Ceremony) and does so
define it, that according to his own philosophical way, all definitions of any
thing should be universal, or universally agreeing to the thing defined,
wherever it is found; it must be universally affirmed of that thing,
wherever it has a Being.

Whereas it is discovered, that there is a Sign of Sanctification, which yet is
not so in his sense, There are some natural Signs of this; of sanctified
Seasons separate for holy Services. The Heavenly Luminaries were, are, and will
be such Signs. There is a notifying testifying-certifying Sign of
Sanctification. Both these, the Weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, has been, is and
will be. It does bespeak Holiness in the Nature and Being, in the Name and
Thing of it, to the due observers of it; and therefore does widely differ from
that which is merely Ceremonial. And both these Signs, are Signs to all Compare
Psalm. throughout with Romans 10. 18. and Deuteronomy. 30. 11-14. with Romans 10. 5.-1^.
mankind. O how special a gift was this Law of the k Seventh day Sabbath! A
choice favor! One of the precious Mercies, as to the Law! To have all holy
Rest even here, in and with the LORD. For unto this does it Call! To lodge in
the bosom and heart of the Messiah, O how delightful; O how good; O how
pleasant. b Neh 9. 13, 14.


I now return unto a further passage in a former (another from this last)
Objector.

The next Particular to be demonstrated, is, that the new Worship was Typically
signified in the figuring Pattern of old. So that, neither does this make any
change at all upon the weekly Sabbath, to make it pass from one day of the Week
unto another, from the seventh to the first.

For as for that Typical Figuring Worship, which was a part of the Pattern
under that Administration, in Types, Shadows, Figures and Rites, which was
performed on the Seventh-day Sabbath, that way of Worship by Sacrifices of
Lambs, by Meat and Drink offerings, Incense, and such like; Col. 2. 16, 17. See
the Margin in the last English Bibles. In part. Gal. 4. 9, 10.
as to this part, these were perfected and accomplished in and by Christ, when
born of the Virgin Mary; when living, dying, rising, ascending: But the
Seventh-day Sabbath stands firm, as one of the ten Words; which are another
sort of Laws, that do abide for ever. Heb. 8. 4. and 9. 23.
This Epistle to the Hebrews does expressly affirm, that the Spiritual, Heavenly
things of this New Testament of Glory, were in the Pattern under the Old. The
parts of Worship now, were then only in a more shadowy, figuring manner; and
therefore you may find the same things, as well as words, transferred out of
the Old, into the New Testament. Only spiritualized in the new. Heb. 13. 8-15.
Romans 3. 25. 1 Pet. 2. 5. Romans 12. 1. Rev. 8. 3, 4, 5. and in many other places.
As Priest, Propitiatory, Altar, Sacrifices, Offerings, Incense, and many such
like. Had this Ingager on the side, for the cause of the first Day, given
instances in any particulars of Worship, in the place where he speaks of new
Worship, it might have been discovered, that the same was in the Pattern of
Old, to which Types then, the Antitypes now, do directly, exactly answer. If a
skilful experienced Believer would write an exact Commentary upon the first,
second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixteenth Chapters of Levitious (not now to
mention much more in that Book, and in Exodus, Numbers and Deuteronomy:) and
take off the Veil from them, and give forth the true, intended, spiritual,
significant meaning of them, by a collating of other suitable Scriptures,
particularly in the New Testament; Every spiritual Discerner may quickly see,
there was Gospel Worship, even then, only differently for the manner, dispensed.

The Ceremonies of old were Heb. 9. 11. Col. 2. 11-17.
Types, and Figures, and Shadows, instituted of Jehovah Aelohim, for these ends
amongst others, to be signifying Seals of the assurance of Christ's coming in
the fullness of time, to accomplish them; and of those good things which
Believers had then, have now, and shall have, in after time, in and by him;
Romans 15. 16, 17. 1 Pet. 2. 5, 9. Rev. 1. 6. Heb. 9. 13, 14.
whether they were Administrators of holy Things, or particular Saints, or the
Saints generally, all of them. These were of old Signs and Seals of
Regeneration, of Justification, of Sanctification, of Acceptaon, of Salvation,
and of eternal Life, Heb. 10. 1.
they were shadows of good things to come, which shadows did continue Heb. 9.
10.
until the time of correction, at the coming of Christ in the Flesh, born of
the Virgin Mary, which Christ was Col. 2. 17.
the Body of these things themselves, the express form, the summary substance
of them. They were now to pass into the spiritual things signified; as those
Typical Figuring, signifying, sealing Ordinances, and Institutions of the New
Testament Dispensation of Grace, Baptism and the Supper of the LORD, do really
to believing partakers of them represent glorious things, and will do so, 1
Cor. 11 24, 25, 26.
till Christ come to make all things new. The forementioned time of correction
did then eminently begin, when Christ Luke 2. 11.
first openly showed himself to be the same Messiah, the same God manifested in
the flesh (for he was born a Savior:) Of whom all the Prophets had foretold:
And it had still a further progress, as he passed further on in his life,
fulfilling all Righteous Observances; as afterward by his Death and
Resurrection; The thorough perfection of which time of correction, was when he
ascended up into the Heavens: The Holy of Holies there. So that, if we speak of
God thus manifested in the flesh; thus was Redemption Work in the Antitype
carried on, the complete finishing thereof, was upon Christ's going up to his
Father from Earth to Heaven. Heb. 8. 1, 4, 5.
For then, and not till then, was the thorough completed consummation of the
Old Testament Administration; and then, and not till then, was the full perfect
Heb. 10. 1, 2.
initiation of the New Testament Dispensation, as the Author of this Epistle to
the Hebrews does expressly declare it. If men will lay any more stress and
weight, in their arguing about this, to any particular time and day, then the
very form and the true Existence, and real Essence, and the consummating
Consecration of that Priesthood of Christ, (which did set an end to, and did
put down the Aaronical and Levitical Priesthood, before which, the whole of the
Antitypical Work of Redemption, so far as it did relate to the Priestly Office
of Christ the Mediator between God and Man, was not perfectly filled up:) This
does stand and consist in those things, which do belong unto the Heb. 8. 4, 5.
and 9. 23, 24. 1 Timothy, 3. 16.
Ascension of our LORD Jesus Christ into Glory: For, whilst Christ was on
Earth, there were other Priests, which offered gifts according to the Law of
the Pattern, who did serve unto the Pattern and Shadow of Heavenly things, of
Heaven it self; and so long Christ had not the former typical Priesthood, so
unchangeably, unpassingly to any other, passing into him as the Antitype; so
long as he remained on Earth he was not such an High Priest, as the Author of
this Epistle does plainly word it; into which Heaven Christ did therefore
ascend, to make Heb. 8. 4, 5, 6. and 9. 8, 11, 23. 24. and 7. 16, 25. 26. verse.
25. To the full end. (...).
a full end of all those Old Testament Types and Figures, becoming now the
glorious Mediator of the New Testament, which is established or legitimated in
better Promises: The holy Spirit, hereby signifying this, that the way of this
Heavenly Sanctuary, the Holy of Holies was not yet made manifest to be
perfectly accomplished, till Christ ascended there; whereby there is evident
proof made, that the Aaronical Levitical Priesthood, being a Type, Figure,
Pattern, and Shadow of this Celestial, super-Coelestial Priesthood of Christ,
did still stand till then, and was not to give way and place, as a Type and
Figure, unto the Antype and Truth, until this great High Priest Christ went
into Heaven. The Birth, the Life, the Passion, the Death, the Resurrection, the
Ascension of Christ, have Luke 2. ^1. Rom, 8. 32, 33, 34.
every one of them, somewhat peculiar in them, as to the Redeeming-work, and
must all of them be put together for the thorough completing of so good and so
gracious, so great and so glorious a Work. But those who would make the
Resurrection-day of Christ, to speak that about a pretended change of the
weekly Sabbath, from the Seventh day to the first, should consider, that the
perfect consummation of this Work in the Antitype, was at Christ's ascending up
into Glory. Then did he Captive Captives unto himself, (which was done Ephesians 4.
8. Psalm. 68. 18.
when he thus went up on high:) which was a part of Redeeming Work. Act. 1. 11.
and 2. 1, etc.
The effusion of his holy Spirit, was one Fruit of Christ's Ascension thither:
Heb. 6, 20. and 9. 11, 12. John 14. 2, 3. and 16. 7.
Into Heaven he went, in the name of his people for their good, to take
possession for them. Now hereby was the Heavenly Holy of Holies Heb. 10. 19, 20.
opened: Here did this high Priest Heb. 6. 20. and 7. 25. and 9. 24. John
intercede for those whom the Father gave unto him. The Priests entering into
the Holiest was Heb. 9. 7, 12, 24. and 6, 20.
a Type of this; yet in some things there was a difference. The Typical high
Priest of old was to enter in there, once every year. But Heb. 9. 7, 12, 25.
Christ entered into Anti-typical Heaven once for all. Heb 9. 5, 7, 12, 24, 25.
The High Priest of old entered into the Type with the blood of Bulls and of
Goats: Christ entered into Heaven with his own blood. Heb. 9. 4.
The High Priest appeared of old before the Ark for the people a little while,
and then came away quickly again: But Christ for Heb. 9. 12.
ever does appear before God his Father, having hereby obtained Eternal
Redemption for those who are his. What shall I more say about this? To expound
the whole of the Old Testament pattern, as to the matters of worship, and in
all the other parts of that Administration, and then to apply it in the new,
how exactly one does correspond to the other, were task enough for a long Life.
That, the shadowy ceremonies, and figuring Types of the Old Testament; as such,
that is to say, as shadowy ceremonies and figuring Types, are done away, and
leave no obligation of duty upon Believers under this New Testament,
ministration to observe and perform the outward part of them, I would thus
demonstrate by Arguments drawn from Ps. 40. 6, 7, 8. compared with Heb. 10.
5-9. Ps. 50. 7-14. Dan. 9. 27.
those Propheties in the Old Testament, which do foretell this: The LORD Jesus
Christ upon his coming in the flesh born of a Virgin, was to cause the
sacrifice and oblation to cease, and thus he bespeaks his Father, Sacrifice and
Oblation thou would not: mine ears have thou dug open; burnt-offering and
sin-offering thou askedst not: Then said I, lo I come, in the Roll of the Book
it is written of me. My God, I delight to do thy acceptable will; and thy Law
is within my Bowels: Christ's Ear was dug open, it was pierced and became
listening to his Father's call, and obedient to his Father's voice; his Ears
were bored by the Father, whose servant for ever Christ was: the Father fitted
a Body to this beloved Son of his, preparing and ordaining it to be an ordinary
and expiatory sacrifice for the sins of the World, it Heb. 10. 1-4.
being impossible, that ceremonial sacrifices should purge away sins, which
therefore were now refused as unprofitable, and they received their perfection
and accomplishment in Christ.

I argue further from those Scripture Names, which are given unto those Rites
and Ceremonies, whereby their Nature is aptly expressed and significantly
described: sometimee they are set out by Acts 7. 44. Heb. 8. 5. compared with
Heb. 9. 24. and 1 Pet. 2. 21. See the Greek words, (...).
Types, as they were under the old, to which the Anti-types do directly answer
in the New; so that the old Types do give place, and the new Anti-types do
stand in their Room: those Types being representing signs, as of some spiritual
thing signified then, so also of some future thing come to pass now; which
being come to pass, as it had a correspondency to the former, so also did it do
away the external part of that which had before adumbrated it. They are in
other places called Heb. 10. 1. and 8. 5.
shadows, which are obscure representations of somewhat else that was the
express form; they were a picturing delineation, and a well drawn Image, of
Heavenly things, of future good things. They were Heb. 8. 5. and 9. 23.
exemplars, as so many Images, representing of Christ and of his benefits: They
were Hebrews 9. 9. (...).
a parable, or collation, an artificial prefiguring narration of somewhat else
signified thereby; a form of Ritual Worship, which served for that time under
that administration, putting somewhat that was visible before the eyes, which
yet had a more inward mysterious meaning in it. They were Gal. 3. 3. and 6. 12.
Heb. 9. 10. and 7. 16. Gal. 6. 13.
fleshy, and flesh, those external ceremonies and outward works, were exercised
about outward, earthy, crass, infirm, and fading things; hence the Laws and
commands about them are said to be fleshy precepts, injoyning the offering up
the flesh of bulls, rams and goats, they were fleshy rites, and one of their
signs, that of Circumcision was a mark in the flesh. The Reader should not here
mistake me, as if I were in this against all the outward part of Worship now
under the New Testament, whilst I declare the abolishing of those external
sacrifices, and outward Rites which were Typical and figuring of old. A just
respect of outward reverence, is due unto Jehovah Aelohim, where he does
manifest his gracious presence: Here is a duty of veneration to be expressed by
outward gesture. Although the inward Worship be principally in several respects
intended and required, yet the outward and bodily part is not excluded but
enjoined also, such as elevation of the Eye and palms of the Hands, bowing,
kneeling, and the like, where meet circumstances of time and place, and other
parts of the case are fitted for it: The LORD made 1 Cor. 6. 19, 20.
the body of Man to be worshipped and glorified by, as well as the Spirit and
Soul, and Believers have a promise, and so are under expectation, of having
their bodies glorified as well as their spirits and souls, in the World and
Life to come: and if they look for a glorifying reward, they should perform a
worshipping work: though the inward worship be the life of the outward worship,
yet the outward must be expressive of the inward, the one is not complete
without the other. Where there is only the outward worship without the inward,
there the worship does not so commend it self to God, not being well testified
before him, who searches the Heart, John 4. 23, 24.
and who being a Spirit, will be worshipped in Spirit, and if there be only
inward worship, without the outward worship, there the worship is not well
witnessed 1 Cor. 11. 4-15.
before Men and Angels. The outward bodily part of idolatrous worship by
gesture and posture, as a testification of homage, is for that cause a sin,
Exodus 20. 4, 5. 1 King. 19. 18. Hos. 13. 2. Ezekiel. 18. 6. Psalm. 44. 20.
because that is given to an Idol, which is an honor due peculiarly unto
Jehovah Aelohim himself; it belongs properly unto the great Creator, and should
not be sacrilegiously stolen from him to be bestowed upon a creature: Where
there is a daring, scorning, and a presumptuous neglecting of the outward part
of solemn worship, Psalm. 5. 7. and 132. 7. Psalm. 95. 6.
there the guilt of heinous sinning is chargeable upon such, and of provoking
asfront to the Heavenly Majesty: A decent comely dress and deportment in the
acts of outward worship and service does well become the Saints. Further yet,
those Ceremonial Rites of old, are called the Gal 4. 3, 9. Col. 2. 8.
Elements of the World weak and egene, such as by which the Israel of God were
instituted in their minority who were Children and Disciples, under the Mosaic
Paedogogy; which, although under that old ministration, they were profitable
exercises leading Believers unto the promised Messiah; yet after the
manifestation of Christ in the flesh, their external use ceased, and their
observation would be noxious: Those paedagogical rudiments, with which the LORD
taught his Church, under the former dispensation, when it was in its infancy,
are now vanished, being shadowy Rites, which had annexed to them an open
professed declaration of their Faith concerning the Messiah, who was then to
come in the flesh, to be born of a Virgin, and to expiate the sins of mankind;
and therefore are not to be observed now by the New Testament Churches, grown
to their ripe age; for, so is the force of Paul's arguing set against those,
who would have brought in the Mosaic Rites into the New Testament Church, and
have mingled them with the Evangelical Doctrine. I draw another argument from
those various phrases in the New Testament, which do express the doing away of
those ceremonial Rites, such as to Ephesians. 2. 14. (...).
loose, or to disbind, which does denote its abrogation, and that it does not
now bind Believers to its observation; Christ having taken away the bond of it:
Ephesians. 2. 15. (...).
To destroy or to abolish, to cause to loyter behind, or to render
improfitable; so has Christ dealt with those Mosaic Ceremonies: Heb. 7. 12.
(...).
To be changed, to be carried from one place or thing to another, to be
transported, conveyed, turned; so it is with ritual institutes, they are passed
into somewhat more spiritual, heavenly and glorious: To be Heb. 7. 18. (...).
abrogated, to be abolished, to be razed out, to be put out or away; so that,
there is a disanulling of these ceremonial Rites: Col. 2. 14. (...).
To take away; so has Christ removed out of the way that handwriting in ritual
injunctions: Col. 2. 14. (...).
To rail it, to affix it, to the Cross, the forementioned Handwriting of
Figuring Ceremonies, under that former Dispensation; Christ did this, fastening
it to his Cross: Col. 2. 14. (...).
To blot it out, to obliterate, to wipe off the Ointment, to wipe out; thus the
Chirograph spoken of but just before, was bl^^ted out by Christ, Christ
cancelled the bond, tare it in pieces, cut it into small parcels, with those
nails, as it were, with which he was nailed to the Cross: Christ having paid
the debt, and fully discharged all the demands of his Fathers Justice, it was
equal, that the bonds subscribed should no longer stand in force. To pass away:
Heb. 7. 24. (...).
the Priesthood of Christ is an eternal Priesthood, which does not pass from
one unto another, either by descent or by succession, as the Levitical
Priesthood did; Christ's Priesthood was so personal, as for ever to abide in
himself; whereas, in the Levitical Priesthood, the Priests dyed one after
another, and the Priesthood it self was changed, being translated unto another
Tribe from Levi to Judah, from which Tribe of Judah our LORD spr^ng; so that
the Levitical Priesthood having now passed into Christ, that Priesthood
cease, and the ceremonial Rites belonging to it: Heb. 10. 1, 2. (...), verse.
9. (...), He takes away the first, that he may establish the later: He takes it
out of the way, he abolisheth it, he lays hold on it, so as to stay it.
To cease, and to be taken out of the way, if those shadowy Sacrifices, which
of old they offered year by year continually, could have made the comers
thereunto perfect, would they not then have ceased to be offered? (For so it
should be rendered interrogatively;) undoubtedly they would have so ceased; this
therefore being now perfected by the offering up of the body of Jesus Christ
once, the Sacrifices must necessarily cease: Romans 7. 1-4. (...).
To be dead: The ceremonial Statutes obliged for a certain time, as in the
Ordinance of Marriage, which does bind till death; but death does unloose that
Matrimonial Bond; so here, Believers under this new Administration are freed
from those ritual observations; and therefore, when all this is put together,
let those who would still be serving the old Tabernacle, remember, that thereby
they deprive themselves of having any Heb. 13. 8, 9, 10. Gal. 5. 1-6.
right to eat of the spiritual Altar, and that, so long, and so far Christ's
coming in the flesh, does profit them nothing, and they betray that Liberty
which Christ has purchased, and entangle themselves by thrusting their necks
still under that Yoke of Bondage, which Christ has broken: If these Mosaic
Rites should still continue in the later-day-Glory, then their Glory in those
later days as to the outward Administration of Grace, will be less than our
Glory now is; whereas, 2 Cor. 3. 6-18. Hag. 2. 3, 7, 9.
we have a better ministration now, more spiritual, more heavenly, more
glorious, than the former dispensation of Grace, under the old Testament was,
and the later-day-Glory will be yet more excelling, 1 Cor. 9. 13, 14. Heb. 13.
8-16. John 1. 16, 17. Exodus 12. 14, 24. 1 Pet. 2 5.
what there is of perpetual equity in those figuring Types, and shadowy Signs,
and how far in Christ, who is the Truth of them, they have an everlasting
continuance, in which regard they are called everlasting Ordinances, and
Ordinances from Generation to Generation, this is a matter, though of very
useful, yet of far distinct inquiry, from what has been now under my
Disquisition: For it sets out the inward spiritual part, the things signified
by those external Signs, such Truths, Duties, Graces and Privileges, as are
some way or other contained in one or other of the Laws of the ten Words; and
are one of the strong arguments for their cessation now upon the change of the
dispensation, the external fleshy, obscure, earthy veiled part, being now
passed into the inward, spiritual, glorious, heavenly unveiled part.

I hasten now to evidence in the Word of Truth, That,

The Law of Faith, was a Law under the Old Testament Dispensation.

Here to avoid mistakes and cavils, (for, we are for standing upon plain firm
ground, having the whole Scripture in plain express words for the Weekly
Seventh day Sabbath:) I notice the Reader, that to believe actually in the
Messiah, as Mediator between God and Man, and actually to believe in this
Messiah, as he that was in the Fullness of Time to come in the Flesh, born of a
Virgin, was a Law under the Old Administration. And to believe actually in that
particular person, this Christ, when come in the Flesh, as so born of the
Virgin Mary, is a Law of the New Testament; yet so, as that this Quateneity, as
so born of the Virgin Mary, is one part of the New Testament Ministration,
properly as such; and so in that respect does belong to another matter. And
thus in some places Faith does set out the New Dispensation of Grace. The short
and plain is this; Faith in the Messiah, or in Christ, was a Law under the Old
Testament-dispensation; or it was then a commanded Duty to believe in Christ;
which was to be done in obedience to a Law of Jehovah Aelohim.

For the Advancement of this sort of profitable Learning, I propound these
following Inquiries; which if well cleared up from Scripture, might bring in
some considerable Augment to this Holy Science.

Q. Whether there be not convincing evidence in the Word of Truth, that fallen
Adam and Eve did actually repent, and believe in the Messiah for Justification,
Acceptance and Salvation.

Q. What Names are there in the Old Testament given to Christ, which do set him
out, as Mediator, as Savior, as the Justifier of his people, and as being
their Righteousness.

Q. What Types, and Figures, and Shadows were there of this Doctrine of Faith
in the Messiah, under old Testament Dispensation?

Q. Whether, if all the Hebrew expressions were put together, that in the Old
Testament are expressive * descriptions of Faith, Trust, Hope, Expectation in
the New, with all the Synonyma's and Phrases referring to this subject matter,
it would not discover much of lively Faith in the Saints, under that former
Dispensation?

That, Faith was a Law under the Old Testament Dispensation, I thus
demonstrate, both in the general significancy of the word, grounded on the
Almightness, and Faithfulness of Jehovah Aelohim, and also in the special
acceptaon it; for closing with, applying of, relying on, Jehovah the Messiah,
and his Righteousness, for justification in the sight of God.

In its general significancy, it has a firm Foundation, a rockie bottom, even
Genesis 1. 15. 1, 6. Romans 10. 17. Heb. 11. 3. 1 Pet. 1. 22. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13. Romans
4, 20. Heb. 11. 1, 6.
the Power and Truth of the omnipotent unchangeable Jehovah, a God of ability
to perform, and of veracity to fulfill, what he has spoken and promised. Every
Word and Truth of God revealed, is the general, and common object of Faith. A
lively working belief of this; though seemingly but in the general, yet has
great influence upon the special actings of justifying Faith; for the
Scriptures do give us instances of too much, and too often questioning the
Power and Fidelity of Aelohim, in his Word and Promises, in some particular
trying Cases, as long hiding of his Faces, great withdrawing, delay of
fulfilling of Propheties and Promises, not answering of Prayer, carrying
himself as one angry at the very Prayers of his people; much conflicting with,
and yet frequent foyling by some particular bewailed, confessed corruption,
under violent temptations, the LORD's seeming forsaking of his Churches and
people, his shining upon, and prospering of the Enemies of the LORD, and of his
people, his seeming to act contrary in his works, from what he covenanteth in
his Word; with more of this kind.

But, I suppose, that it is the notion of Faith in its special acceptance,
that is intended by this pretended new Law of Faith in this Objection: That
this Faith in Christ is now in more clearness, spiritualness, evidence,
growingness, heavenlyness, for the manner and degrees of it, we thankfully and
admiringly, acknowledge to the praise of God, of rich Grace, and of free Love,
who has brought us under this new and more glorious Administration. But, there
was the same Grace of Faith in Truth, and in reality, for its Nature and
Essence, in the savingness and justifyingness of it, for the kind and
specifickness of it, under the Old: This we also affirm, was it not this saving
and justifying Faith which the Author of the Epistle Heb. 10. 38. and 1^.
throughout: and 12. 1, 2.
to the Hebrews do speak of, when he said, The just by faith shall live? Those
who are justified, counted just by Faith in Christ, applying him and his
Righteousness, shall live that life of Grace, and of Comfort, of support and
stay, of waiting, and of dependence here, which shall pass into an eternal life
of Glory, of full Vision, Enjoyment, and Happiness. And was not this Testimony
brought out of the Habak. 2. 4. Romans 1. 17. Gal. 3. 11. Heb. 10. 38.
Old Testament, which is used once and again, and a third time in the new? And
in every one of the places in the new, it is applied with respect to
Justification by Faith in Christ. So in the Epistle to the Romans; the
Righteousness of God (of Christ who was God as well as Man, for the complete
satisfactory righteousness of such an one did we stand in need of:) is revealed
in the same Gospel of Christ from Faith to Faith; as it is written, But the
just by faith shall live: That Righteousness by which a Believer does stand
justified before the Judgment Seat of God, and can be no other Righteousness,
but only the Righteousness of Christ, this is a free gift from the Father, and
is through the inworking of the holy Spirit, by Faith imputed to Believers. The
like sense it has in that passage of the Epistle to the Gal. 3. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
11.
Galatians; that no man by the Law is justified before God is mentioned; for
the just by faith shall live; referring again to that place in Habakkuk,
whereby to prove justification by Faith in Christ only, as the Context does
evidently declare: And thus in the formentioned passage to the Hebrews, having
in the last verse but one of the tenth Chapter, cited that Scripture in the Old
Testament, the Author proceeds in the first verse of the eleventh Chapter to
describe the true spiritual Nature of saving justifying Faith; and he gives
particular Instances and Examples of the Saints of old, who acted this Faith.
Was it not Heb. 11. 4. Mat. 23. 35. Genesis 3. 15. and 4. 4. and 1 John 3. 12.
by this Faith, in the promised Seed of the Woman, in Christ, that Abels person
and Sacrifice was acceptable to God, and by which he obtained witness, that he
was Righteous, and so justified in the sight of God? Was it not by this Faith
that Enoch Heb. 11. 5.
pleased God who gave him this Testimony, and was therefore honored with the
privilege of walking with God here, and then of Gods taking him away to
himself? Was it not Heb. 11. 6, 7. 2 Pet. 2. 5.
by this Faith, that Noah prepared the Ark, as a Type of Christ, by which he
became an heir of the Righteousness, which is according to Faith? Of which
Righteousness, of Justification by Faith in the Messiah, Noab was Preacher to
others? Was it not Heb. 11. 8-19. Genesis 15. 1, 5, 6.
by this Faith; that Abraham was justified? Did not he believe God? Jebovah the
Messiah, who appeared to him? And was it not accounted to him for
Righteousness? And is not this brought in by Paul in his Romans 4. throughout;
and Gal. 3. 6-18.
Epistles to the Romans, and to the Galatians, to prove the Doctrine of
Justification by Faith in Christ, by his Righteousness imputed to the Believer?
Did not Abraham receive the Sign of Circumcision, as a Seal of this
Righteousness of Faith, which was thus imputed to him? Is not Abraham
propounded as an Example to after-Believers in this? being called the Father of
all that believe, in the Foot steps of whose Faith after-Believers are to walk?
For what was so counted to him for Righteousness, was written, not for his sake
alone, that it was imputed to him, but for the sake of Paul, and of others in
Paul's time; and so still for our sakes, in the present day, to whom it shall
be imputed, namely to them that do believe in him; Deuteronomy. 30. 11-14. Romans 10.
6-9.
what Moses does speak of the Duties of the Law, Paul does interpret of the
Faith of the Gospel. It would fill up much paper to enlarge in all the other
instances of the old Testament-Believers, recorded in the new, particularly in
that eleventh Chapter to the Hebrews. There is Ephesians. 4. 5.
one Faith; one and the same Doctrine of Faith, to be believed; and one and the
same Grace of Faith, by which men do believe, for Justification and Salvation,
both under the Old and New Testament. It was the open confession of Acts 15. 11.
Peter's Faith in one of the first Councils or Synods, held in the New
Testament, when the Apostles and Elders were assembled together to debate some
weighty Question of the Christian Religion; We believe, says he, by the Grace
of the LORD Jesus Christ, to be saved in such manner as they also; as the
believing Forefathers under the Old Testament were, merely through free Grace,
by Faith in Grace, by Faith in Christ, in his righteousness. They by Faith in
Christ, who was then to come to be in due time born of the Virgin, which was
held forth in Types of old to this end; We in Christ, as the perfect Antitype
thus already come. Romans 12. 1, 2, 3, 6.
The Analogy of Faith in both Testaments should be attended unto by a diligent
discerning Reader of the Word, a due proportional collating of them, between
and to each other, would discover the uniformness and well-agreingness of the
Will of our LORD in them both, by a particular right application and limitation
of their Analogy, the orderly regulation whereof must be made according to that
measure and number of proportion, which the different manner of dispensing does
call for, and no further is it to be admitted, as to any substantial and
essential part of the Christian Religion; there is a likeness of Word, a
sameness of Sense, a oneness of intendment on them both, unto which Analogy he
must keep close, who would give forth a true explication of sound Doctrine.
That Faith, which is required and promised in the Covenant of Grace, is for the
substance of it, one and the same Grace, which is commanded in the Law of the
ten Words; and let it be further researched into by the ingenuous for the
augment of this Spiritual Science; Whether the Faith of Adam in his innocence
(I do not put here into this inquiry, as to the special use, and the proper
object of it) were not for the substance of the Grace one and the same with the
New Covenant Grace of Faith? Was not Adam in all things to give confident
credence to all as to every Truth which Aelohim his Creator had revealed or
should further reveal, was he not bound to believe in the promised Messiah by
the Law of Creation and of Nature, as soon as ever Jehovah should reveal this
to him? The whole Scripture is profitable for this doctrine, of the oneness and
sameness of old and New Testament Faith, and I am persuaded after some years
research into the word of Truth, about this matter, and long experience suited
thereunto, that one great occasion at least, if not cause, of the Apostasies
and Backslidings of some, of the loose ungospel-like, and
ill-principled-conversation of others, and of the practical Atheism and
Infidelity of some others, and of the doubts and fears, and unprofitable
walking of other some, has been men's unscriptural unwarrantable setting up of
so many different Religions in the Old and New Testament, and the urging of
some one, or a few misunderstood, misinterpreted Scriptures, wrested and wryed
to some particular purpose, contrary to the drift, and intent, and scope, of
the whole Scripture besides, which does write about that Case: Whereas the
whole Scripture is uniform and harmonious, speaking with one mouth, one and the
same thing. The only difference between the Old and the New, being in the mode
of Administration, as has been opened once and again. Let me here further add,
(seeing this Objector does call this a New Law of Faith, as a part of the the
New Creation; brought in and perfected particularly, and only upon the first
day of the Week, and upon no other day, as he pretends:) that, this, Grace of
Faith was put into a Law under the Old Testament Dispensation; for, besides
that, if there had been no Law for this Faith, under that Dispensation, Romans 4.
15, and 5. 13. 1 John 3. 4.
it had been no sin, no transgression not to have believed with that Faith; for
sin is the transgression of some Law; and I have shown, it was Christ
manifesting himself to Moses in Egypt and in the wilderness, whom the
Israelites did so often tempt, grieve, provoke, and not Psalm. 18. 22, 32. Heb.
3. 12, 18, 19. and 4. 2, 11.
not believe. But further, Faith in that Jehovah Aelohim, who proclaimed the
ten words at Mount Sinai, was a plain duty, enjoined in the first word or
command; and that Promulgator, I have proved to be the Messiah or Christ. So
that it was a duty actually to believe him, to believe in him. Faith in the
Lawgiver is Act. 18. 25. 26. 2 Chronicles. 20. 20.
one of the ways and commandments of this Jehovah.

I had here given a dismiss unto this (that I might hasten to the last
particular:) but that I called to mind, how another adversary of, and objector
against, the Seventh-day Sabbath had affirmed, that the Decalogue had less in
it than the Law of Nature, and that therefore it was never intended for a mere
or perfect Transcript of the Law of Nature. (Although, if he had improved his
own concession, he might have seen how he tacitly gave an answer to his own
Objection; for he says, That the chief Heads of Natutes Law are contained in
the Decalogue:) He gives instances in diverse particulars; some of the chief of
them, in which he seems much to glory, I shall examine: In which he judges the
Decalogue is defective, such as the belief of the Soul, to love our selves with
a just and necessary Love, to fame and mortify all our fleshly lusts, in order
to our Salvation, to deny all bodily Pleasure, Profit, Honor, Liberty and
Life, for the securing of our Salvation.

Let the considerate Reader now spiritually, according to the Word of Truth,
discern in these matters. If the Scripture-rules of interpreting these ten
Words, Laws or Commands be observed, allowed and applied, it will be manifest,
That they are a comprehensive, as for other things, so for the particulars
specified; so far as does concern the discharge of Duty, and the avoiding of
Sin. These general Laws do take in more particulars, than is commonly observed,
for the particulars are expressed by some word or other, in the general Law,
which by collating of other Scriptures in the Original words and phrases does
evidently demonstrate this; which is well worth the noting and improving for
the advancement of this decalogue-Science. The definition of every one of the
ten Words, is so fully and comprehensively fitted, as they take in all the Laws
of Natural Holiness and Righteousness: So that, we may say with the Psalm. 11,
9^, 97.
Psalmist, In all perfection I have seen an end, but thy commandment, O
Jehovah, is very large! O how I love thy Law!

To believe that the Soul is what Scripture and Nature do say that it is, is
comprehended in the Decalogue. The Maker and Giver of this Law is the best
Interpreter of it. Mat. 22. 35 -- ^^.
When the Lawyer asked Christ, which was the great Commandment in the Law? The
LORD Jesus answered him, Thou shall love the LORD thy God with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thine understanding, and with all thy
strength: This is the first and the great Commandment: and the second is like
unto it, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self. On these two Commandments
hang the whole Law and the Prophets. Observe here, Is not the Soul particularly
taken notice of in the expression? And that too, as a distinct, essential,
constitutive part of man, from the spirit and body? And is not this a Word to
be believed? Is it not plain here, that the Scripture Doctrine of the Soul, is
to be believed? And this as comprehended within the due bounds of the
Decalogue? That Christ does here speak of the Law of the ten words is evident,
by collating of Mar. 12. 28.-34. Luke 10, 25.-28.
other Scriptures, which do historically relate the same thing, where the
Preface, Deuteronomy. 5. 1, etc. Romans 13. 8, 9, 10.
Hear, O Israel, does show, that it is meant of this Law of the ten words,
seeing there is a particular enumeration of several of the ten Words in express
terms. Which ten Words do summarily contain the whole Doctrine of Holiness, and
of Righteousness, whatsoever the Law and the Prophets do speak of: And how much
is there in these concerning the Doctrine of the Soul? This exposition of the
Lawmakers himself, is a sufficient warranting of this interpretation; For, he
does make the sum of the first Table, (to which the four first words do
belong:) to be the loving of Jehovah our Aelohim, with all our heart, and with
all our soul, and with all our might. And the sum of the second Table; (which
takes in the six last words:) to be; Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self.
And Mar. 12. 30. Luke 12. 30. Luke 10. 27.
the expressions which Christ does use, are remarkable; the whole Heart; the
whole Soul, the whole Strength; the whole Mind; which words do take in the
whole Power, and Powers of the inner and outer man. (...).
The whole strength does more properly set out the might of the Body, in the
external Members, Limbs and Parts of it. The whole Heart does express all the
Inwards of the bodily fleshy part of man: The whole Mind does call for the
Vigor and Activity, the light and life of the Spirit of Man: The spirit of a
Man is naturally Luminous, and has Light enough in it to demonstrate his Being,
to be distinct from the respiring faculty in Man. So that the whole in his All,
and in every part of him is concerned and engaged in this Love. And all these
words thus put together, do discover and declare, that this Law of the Ten
Words does extend to Spirit, Soul and Body; both the External and Internal
parts of the Body: which three do constitute and make up a complete Man. And
the LORD can make this good use of this part of the Answer, to put the Readers
upon further Inquiries into the Word of Truth, after the true nature and proper
difference of their Spirits, Souls and Bodies, and what the distinct duties of
each are, and wherein they must all jointly agree in obeying this precept of
Love. Exodus 20. 21.
The Fourth Word does declare Jehovah Aelohim to be the Maker of the Heavens
and of the Earth, and of all things that are therein; and the Soul of Man is
one of these things which he created and Isai. 57. 16. Genesis 2. 7. and in other
places.
made. It is of the Law of Nature agreeably to the Word to believe, that souls
are, and that there is a Maker of them. And that it is a duty, both to get more
of the knowledge of our souls, and with our souls, to love and honor the
Creator of them.

To love our selves with a just and necessary Love, as such, is of the Law of
Nature; Prove. 8. 36.
He that does it not is a Self Murderer, he does kill somewhat or other of
himself, which is against the express Letter of the Sixth Word. Those that by
sinning against, and hating of the LORD Christ, are Oppressors, Wrongers,
Abusers of their own Souls, and love death; they do that by which they bring
death and destruction upon themselves; and so do not discharge that duty which
under, and for him they owe unto themselves. To love our Neighbor as our
selves is Lev. 19. 18. Mat. 22. 39. Romans 13. 8, 9.
of the Law of Nature in the Decalogue, which is the sense that the Lawgiver
himself does give of his own Law. Page 218. of his Treatise.
This Objector himself does acknowledge all the Duties of self-love to be
deeply written in Man's Nature; but in this he does mistake, in that he says,
That all the Duties of self love, as such are passed by (as supposed) in
Moses's Decalogue. (In the way, men should use more tenderness in their
expressions about these holy Laws of Christ; upon which he himself does put so
much honor. This Adversary does sometimes call it a Jewish Law, and here
Moses's Decalogue, when he had before and after, written so much diminitively
about these ten Words; whereas the Scriptures do name them with more honor,
Exodus 34. 28. Deuteronomy. 20. 4. and 4. 13.
the Words of the Covenant, the ten Words, the ten Words which Jehovah spoke,
which he gave unto Moses. Moses called them, the ten Words of Jehovah's
Covenant, which Jehovah wrote upon two Tables of Stone: with many more of such
glorious Names and Titles. But to my matter in hand:)

If these Duties of self love are supposed, where are they supposed, if not in
this present comprehensive Law? which does include all Duties? Mat. 22. 39.
(...) Luke 10. 27.
Christ's Rules of Interpreting do expressly take in self-love, making this
commanded Duty of self-love, to be the measure of our Love to our Neighbor;
the one must be regulated by the other according to the Word. Mat. 7. 12.
In his own Commentary upon his own Law, he does affirm, all the Law and the
Prophets, to make a regular Love to our selves, to be Lev. 19. 1^.
the measure of our Love to others. This Law of self-love is not then so passed
by, but that in express terms, if we will take Christ for an Interpreter, it is
a Duty required in the Law of the ten Words. Both Old and New Testament do
speak one and the same thing in this matter; And men will never be thoroughly
true, right lovers of themselves, till their hearts and lives in a way of
growing conformity, both in knowledge and in obedience, be more and better
reconciled to this Law of the ten Words. Pure, Primitive, Created, Natural,
Word self-love is eminent in an Universal Obedience, unto all the Holy,
Righteous, Just Laws of Jehrvah Aelohim: They are good Laws, good to the
observer of them. The LORD does use this Argument, whereby to prevail with
true, right self-lovers, keep all my Commandments Deuteronomy. 10. 12, 13.
for thy good, Thy; the benefit and the advantage will be thy own. Thy
Obedience thereby, will be profitable Job 22. 2.
to thy self. Every one of the ten Words being directed to men, in the Second
Person, does stir up their natural, regular self-love; Thou shall, or Thou
shall not. It is thy own great concern; Ephesians. 5. 2^, 29.
For, there is a lawful regular self-love, 2 Timothy 3. 2.
as there is a sinful carnal self-love.

This also does take in somewhat of another Instance of this Objector, about
taking greatest care to save our Souls above our Bodies. For the Chain, and the
order Lines of Love is held forth in the Decalogue. Mat. 22. 36, 37. 38, 39,
40. Lev. 19. 17, 18.
The Honor and the Glory of Jehovah Aelohim, being commanded, and commended,
in the first Table; and then the Salvation and good of our selves; and next to
this, the Salvation and good of others: As has been already opened.

Further, to tame and mortify all our fleshly Lusts in order to our Salvation:
Is not this also precepted in the Decalogue? Where any Duty is there commanded,
do not also the means pointed thereunto pass under precept? Thus, where any sin
is forbidden, are not there also the causes and occasions of such a sin
forbidden? And are not there also the means instituted for the avoiding such a
sin enjoined? Are not Lusts and Corruptions, the whole old man of them, the
original indwelling sin, which is the root and the corrupt Fountain, whence all
other sins and corruptions do spring and flow, are not these forbidden in the
Law of the ten Words? Does not Paul evidently argue this in the seventh Chapter
of his Epistle to the Romans? Romans 8. 13. Prove. 5. 1^.
If we do not through the spirit mortify the deeds of the body: Is not this
one way of self-murder, forbidden in the sixth Word, or Law? And where a sin is
forbidden, is not the contrary Duty there commanded? Are we not by virtue of
this, and of other of these Laws, to forbear those acts of Gluttony,
Drunkenness, Adultery, and such like, as they tend to our own damnation? Where
the express charges for mortification are given to us, do they not evidently
refer to the particular Laws of the ten Words? Col. 3. 5, 8, 9, 18, 19, 20, 21,
2^. and 4. 1.
Mortify your members which are upon the Earth, Fornication, Uncleanness
(against the seventh Word:) Passion (against the sixth Word: (Evil
Concupiseence, (against the seventh Word, in its limited restrained sense,
against the whole of this Law, in a large sense.) Covetousness (against the
tenth Word.) Which is Idolatry (against the first Word). We must put off all
these, Anger, Wrath, Malice (against the sixth Word.) Blasphemy (against the
third Word, when belched out against Jehovah, against the ninth Word, when
spoken evilly against our Neighbor.) Filthy communication out of our Mouths,
(against the seventh Word:) Lie not one to another (against the ninth Word)
Husbands be not bitter against your Wives; Fathers, give not ill words to your
Children; Servants do not wrong; (against the fifth Word.) Do not not the Law
and the Prophets, under the old Administration call for Deuteronomy. 30. 6. Jer. 4. 3,
4.
the ploughing up of the sallow Ground, for Circumcising themselves to Jehovah
for taking away the Foreskin of their Hearts, with other such like expressions?
And do these set out the mortification of the lusts? What was much of the
Typical whole Burnt-offering, Romans 12. 1.
but the mortifying and killing of sin? So that as this is a Duty under the
New, so also it is a Duty under the Old: And if so, it must be by virtue of one
or other of the ten Words; for on these do all the Law and the Prophets, the
whole Old Testament, hang as to matters of commands or Prohibitions, though it
take in other matters too.

To deny all bodily Pleasure, Profit, Honor, Liberty and Life, for the
securing of our Salvation, regular self-love, as it is a Law of Nature, does
dictate, and is a great part of that which the LORD Jesus Christ, Mat. 22.
35-40. Mar. 12. 28-34. Luke 10. 25-28.
in that cutting of the ten Words into two Comprehensives of them, does call
the second Commandment: For Love to the Honor of Jehovah Aelohim, is the first
and chief Commandment, and must be mainly put forth in this case, though it
were to the parting with our any thing, our all. Are there not eminent Examples
of this under the Old Testament; which have an honorable Record in the New?
Did not Heb. 11. 7. 1 Pet. 3. 20, 21.
Noah go far in this of self denial, when he opposed all that corrupt age?
When he condemned the whole World of sinful mankind, as he could reach them?
and was not this to the saving, not only of his house, but of his soul? Heb.
11. 8, 9, 13, 17, 18.
Was not Abraham eminent in this, when he left his own Country and his Fathers
House, and at a call from the LORD went out, not knowing whither he went, to
sojourn in a strange Country, where he was in great danger? And when at a word
from the LORD, he was ready to offer up his Isaac, his only begotton, beloved
Son, of whom it was said, In Isaac shall the seed be called to thee? Heb 11.
24-27.
Did not Moses excel here in? when by Faith, being grown big, he refused to be
called the Son of Pharaoh's Daughter? (was not this a denying all bodily
honor?) when he by Faith chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of
God, than to have the Temporary Enjoyment or Delight of sin? (Was not this to
deny all bodily pleasure?) when he by Faith, esteemed the reproach of, or for
Christ (observe, there was a Christ then, and Moses rejoiced in his being
persecuted for Christ's sake, because great was his reward in Heaven, which is
an answer to another Instance of this Objector:) greater riches than the
Treasures in Egypt? (Was not this to deny all profit?) when he by Faith
forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King, for he was constant, as
seeing him who is invisible? (Was not this to deny all bodily liberty and
life?) And were not these for the securing of his Salvation? Is it not expressly
spoken of him, that Moses had respect unto the Recompense of Reward? Did not he
believe, that there was an Heaven? where the glorified Saints will be perfectly
blessed, in the Knowledge, Love and Fruition of God? (Which does also return a
confutation to another Instance of the Objector.) Was not Moses under some
VVord-Law for all this? Must not this Faith have some Word from Jehovah to
bottom upon? O how honorable are these things of this glorious Law.

This puts me on toward the closing of my great undertaking, which is to show,
That

The Old Law of the ten Words is still the same, both to Jew and Gentile. It
was the Rule of Obedience to them under the Old Testament, as unto God in
Christ, and is still so a Rule unto us under the New.

In my entrance upon this, I must express my a^horrence of that bold
daringness, in some, who charge the LORD Jesus Christ himself, with being in
his lifetime a coun^enancer of some breaches of the Seventh-day Sabbath. Thus
flying in the face, not only of this holy Law, but also of the Supreme
Lawgiver. They give two Instances: one in the twelfth of Matthew, and the
beginning of that Chapter; the other in the fifth Chapter of John, the ninth,
tenth, and so on to the sixteenth Verse. As to the the former, concerning
Christ's Disciples plucking the Ears of Corn, and eating, on the Seventh-day,
and Christ's pleading their Cause, Consider well their Case, in all the
Circumstances of it. They did what was lawful on the Seventh day, it being a
needful refreshing of their outer man, thereby to strengthen for
Sabbath-worship and Service, where other provision was wanting, a work of
Mercy, as Christ showed it to be; an action tending toward the Sanctification
of the Sabbath, and not bringing any Duty thereof. It was according to what the
Law of Jehovah did allow, in the two last Verses of the twenty third Chapter of
Deuteronomy, which had foundation in right Nature, and in just Equity amongst
all Mankind, who did allow this in a case of present necessity. And this
Christ's does further exemplify in a like case of David.

Concerning the later: Where Christ healed the man diseased, and bid him, To
take up his bed and walk: And this on the Sabbath Day. The diseased man was
there on his bed, in the way of his cure; a cure was lawful on the Sabbath Day,
a doing good on such a day, a work of necessity, and of mercy; and so lawful.
This was a Work that the diseased man could not foresee, or prevent before the
Sabbath came; nor being healed, was he to delay it till the Sabbath was over;
left he had lost that of his goods, which his duty was so to preserve; (the
Creator on the Seventh-day Sabbath preserved his Creatutes, which he had made
on the six foregoing days of the same week) It was a public Testimony of the
truth of the Cure, and of the power of the Healer, who as God-man spoke the
cure; It was an act of Faith and of Obedience, in him who was whole, and did
not hinder any Sabbath-worship: For you may find him in the Temple, in the
fourteenth Verse.

Having already proved, that the LORD Jesus Christ was Admininistrator under
the Old Testament: and that he was the Promulgator of the Law of the ten Words
at Mount Sinai, who was to be believed and obeyed in that Day, as well as now;
and that, the end of the Law also, the great design, drift, purport, and
meaning of it was, Christ for Righteousness to every one that believes: That
which is now upon my hand to defend and maintain is, that it is still a Rule of
Obedience now unto the New Testament; for the confutation of Mat. 24. 12.
Anomy or Antinomianism.

This Law of the ten Words was confirmed by the express Doctrine of our LORD
Jesus Christ, when he took to his Godhead the Humane Nature, born of the
Virgin Mary, and dwelt here on Earth, and conversed with men for some years,
Mat. 5th, 6th and 7th Chapters.
particularly in his Sermon at the Mount. So that, Exodus 19th and 20th
Chapters, and Isai. 33. 22. Heb. 12. 18, 19, 24, 26. and Act. 7. 37, 38, 39.
Psalm. 68. 8, 11, 17. 18, 20.
as he was the Proclaimer of them at Mount Sinai: Thus also was he here again
at the Mount, the Preacher and Confirmer of them, in the faithful discharge of
his Kingly Prophetic Office. He would not have any Disciple of his so much as
to give way unto any Mat. 5. 17, 18, 19. (...), loose, or dis^bind, which that
man, whatsoever be be, d^^b, that eicher abrogateth this Law, any one of its
Commands, much more if the ^bole of it; or that does not observe it, much more
if he affirm (...): unlawful to be observed.
one thought, that he came to dissolve any of the least commands of this Law of
the ten Words; the least Consonant, or Vowel, or Point, whatsoever it was that
was originally this of Christ's own giving and writing from his Father, by his
Spirit in his Word: Nothing, not the least part of it, was in any wise to pass
from it. Who-ever he were that did loose or dissolve one of these least
Commandments, more especial too, if he did further teach men so; such an one
was not in a fi^^edness for the New Testament Church State, which is set out by
the Kingdom of Heaven: He was neither to be admitted into this State, where it
was known; or if he unawares crept in, yet being discovered, he was not to
continue in that state, 2 Cor. 10. 4, (...).
without the exercise of Church Discipline. And that Christ does speak of this
Law of the Ten Words is manifest; for he does give particular instances of
particular Commands in the Decalogue: Of the Sixth Word or Command, in the one
and twentieth Verses of that Mat. 5.
fifth Chapter: of the Second or Fourth Words or Commands (though set out after
the manner of the Old Testament Dispensation, which at that time was not so
fully perfected and accomplished, as I have showed else where:) in the twenty
third and twenty fourth Verses of that fifth Chapter; where the manner of
Worship, and Compare Mat. 4. 5, 6, 7 8 Chapters, particularly, Mat. 7. 28. with
Mar. 1 21, 22. and inquire, Whether it were not on the weekly Seventh-day
Sabbath, when Christ preached this Sermon at the Mount, Wherein he confirmed
the whole of this Law of the ten Words.
the times and seasons of Worship are spoken to and of: Of the Seventh Word, in
the twenty seventh Verse, and onwards to the end of the thirty second Verse: Of
the Third Word in the thirty third Verse, and so forward to the thirty seventh
Verse: Of the First Word in the Mat. 6.
nineteenth Verse, and further, even to the end of the sixth Chapter. If thou
be a discerning unprejudiced Reader, it is but open thy Bible, and read those
Mat. 5. 6, 7. Chapters.
three Chapters, and thou will conclude with me, that this Sermon is Christ's
reviving of, and Commentary upon the Law of the Ten Words; making this to be
Mat. 7. 24-27. Luke 6. 47, 48, 49.
the Doctrinal Foundation, upon which wise Believers are to bottom and to
build. The same Truth and Duties which are here taught and commanded by Christ,
are the same which the Prophets of old did commend to the people, and which
Exodus 20. 13. Deuteronomy. 5. 17. Exodus 20. 14. Deuteronomy. 5. 18. Exodus 20. 7. Lev. 19. 12.
Deuteronomy. 5. 11. Exodus 21. 24. Lev. 24. 20. Deuteronomy. 19. ^1. Lev. 19. 18.
Moses also did deliver; as may be seen in the Citations in the margin, Mat. 7.
12. and 22. 40. Luke 6. 31.
It was by this Law of the Decalogue, that Christ does prove the truth of his
Doctrines, and the equity of his Commands.

It is Christ's obedience unto the Law of the Ten Words, wherein he propounds
and sets himself as a John 2.3-6. and 4. 17. Ephesians. 5. 1, 2. 1 Pet. 2. 21.
Pattern and Example for Believers to imitate, and to follow him.

This Law of the Ten Words is affirmed in the New Testament, to be in its own
nature, Romans 7. 12, 13, 14, 16, 22. and 12. 2. Jam. 1. 25 and 2. 8, 9, 10, 11,
12. 1 John 3. 4 Romans 4. 15. and 5. 13.
an Holy, Just, Good, Spiritual Law; a Perfect Law, commanding all good, and
forbidding all evil. All and every sin is a transgression of one or other of
the Ten Words, which are still the Believer's light to guide his steps aright
in those straight ways wherein he is to walk.

The Apostles in the History of their Acts, and in the Epistles which they sent
to the Christian Churches, are full of this Doctrine; which does constantly
attend their preaching of that great Truth of Justification by faith in Christ
particularly, even as to the Laws of the Romans 13. 8, 9, 10. Gal. 5. 14. and in
a multitude of other places.

The Prophesies of the Scripture that do foretell of an Holy Righteous People
in the purer Churches of the later days, have respect unto this Law, which is
sealed in Christ's Disciples, which is transcribed in their Ezekiel 36. 26, 27.

that lawless one, will set himself most to persecute those Disciples of
Christ, who do stick closest to Christ, in walking according to the Rule of
Rev. 14. 12. and 12. 17.
this Law. Both the Old Testament, and also the New does Mal. 4. 4, 5, 6. and
Rev. 22. 14, 18, 19.
close with a Reviving and Enforcing of this Law; and that under a terrible
threatening of Excommunication against scandalous Transgressors of it, and a
dreadful Curse denounced against such as shall add to, or take from it; Deuteronomy.
4. 1, 2. and 1^. 32. Prove. 30. 5, 6. Josh. 1. 7.
whereunto other Scriprures do well agree.

For the accomplishing of what Rev. 11. 7.
John had in a Vision, Believers do now wait, even that the Temple of God may
be open in Heaven; in which Temple may be seen the Ark of his Testament or
Covenant; 1 King. 8. 9. Exodus 31. 18. and 34. 1, 27, 28.
in which Ark there was nothing put but the Two Tables, on which the Ten Words
written with the finger of Aelohim. This Law shall yet once again come forth
Isai. 2. 3.
out of Mount Sion.

This Law is one of the Hos. 8. 12. Isai. 42. 4, 16, 21.
Great honorable things of Aelohim. All the LORD'S Appearings in his way of
Justice against Sin for Holiness, is his Vindication of this Law. And all his
free Rewardings of his obedient people in his way of Righteous performing of
Covenant Mercy, is his Approbation of this Law; for upon this bottom do all his
Judicial Laws stand.

These later days do call for Advocates, to plead the Cause of this Holy,
Righteous Law; Antichrist now does more appear to be 2 Thessalonians. 2. 3, 8.
the Anomous one. The Antichristian party have mangled the ten Words; for thus
they publish them in their Psalters and Catechisms:

1. I am the Lord God; thou shall have no other God but me. 2. Thou shall not
take the Name of God in vain. 3. Remember to sanctify the holy days. 4. Honor
thy father and mother. 5. Thou shall not kill. 6. Thou shall not commit
adultery. 7. Thou shall not steal. 8. Thou shall not bear false witness. 9.
Thou shall not desire thy neighbors wife. 10. Thou shall not desire thy
neighbors goods.
Here they wholly leave out the second Commandment: They thrust the weekly
Seventh-day Sabbath of Jehovah, out of the Fourth Word, and substitute their
own unscriptural holy days; they turn the last Word into two. They teach
religious reverence to be done to Creatures, as to Angels, to Souls departed,
to the Cross, etc. they hold it lawful to be present at idolatrous service,
keeping a man's conscience to himself, they teach Invocation of Saints; they
allow blasphemous Oaths; they teach Will Worship, Idolatry, Superstitions, and
their fabulous feigned Traditions, and such vows as are unwarrantable and
unlawful, they lay aside the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, and set up days of
men's inventing, instituting and imposing: dedicating them, and the worship and
service on them, much to Creatures; they hold, that the Magistrate has nothing
to do in the Matters of Religion; they exempt their Clergy from the
jurisdiction of the Civil Magistrate; They absolve Inferiors from their
subjection to Superiors. They justify Murdering of Princes, and of others,
that promote not their Cause; they tolerate Stews; they allow uncleanness to
some persons, as venial, and scarce a sin: They assert officious and sporting
lies to be lawful and justifiable, if good may be attained by it; They dispense
with the whole Decalogue, by Usurpation; If the Pope command what Christ does
forbid, or if he forbid what Christ does command, yet they require their people
to obey them, contrary to Christ's Law.

Mat. 24. 12. and 7. 23. and 23. 28. Romans 4. 7. and 6. 19. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 7. Tit. 2. 14. Heb. 1. 9. Tzephan. 3. 4. Malac. 2. 9. Heb. 8. 12. and

The sins of the later days are expressed by the name of Anomies; which is
often declared against in the New Testament, as well as in the Old. Violence to
the Law, and partiality in the Law, is one great Article, that will be brought
in by way of charge against corrupt Teachers, in the later days. This is the
great comprehensive sin which the LORD does so much hate.

(...).
One Word for Law, is used (if I have not misreckoned:) abvoe one hundred and
ninety times in the New Testament; and (...).
another word for a commandment, about seventy times: And those who are
nefarious, (...).
not consentaneous to Laws, Out laws, and lawless ones, are the gross erring
ones, in principle, in practice, or in both. O how zealous was the LORD Christ
for this Law of his! How careful to have Mat. 22. 40, (...): and 5. 17, 18, 19.
Mat. 19. 17. 2 Pet, 2, 28.
the whole of it, all and every part of it, to be safely kept! He put it all
into two comprehensive Precepts, and there hung it up, to stay it, that none of
it might fall to the ground, or be lost. All Religion conspireth into these
two. This is that way of Righteousness, wherein Believers ought to be found
walking.

Anomy, Antinomian^sm, lawlessness, or a disowning and rejecting of the Law of
the ten Words, this is a description of sin, as opposed to Holiness and
Righteousness, 1 John 34. Romans 6. 19. 2 Cor. 6. 14. Anomy is that foul
comprehensive evil, which Christ does hate, Heb. 1. 9. To be reckoned amongst
the Anomous ones, is to be reckoned amongst the vilest, and most notorlous of
sinners, Mar. 15. 28. Luke 22. 37. They were Anomous hands, which did crucify
Christ, Act. 2. 23. Anomous works are grieving and vexing to the Righteous Soul
of a Righteous Man, 2 Pet. 2. 8. Anomy is that great Evil, which Christ came to
redeem his people from, Tit. 2. 14. Anomy is that sin, which all Christ's
justified ones have freely forgiven unto them, Romans 4. 7. Heb. 8. 12. and 10.
17. Anomy does lay aside that Rule, by which we must judge of Good and of Evil,
of Sin and of Duty, Romans 4. 15. and 5. 30. It is one of Antichrists Names, that
he is the Anomous one, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 8. Anomy is the heinous crime of the later
days, Mat. 24. 12. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 7, 8. Anomous ones will be cast out of
Fellowship and Communion, in the purer Churches of the later-day-Glory, Mat.
13. 41. Such as live and die working of this Anomy, will at the last be shut
out of the New City, and the Heavenly Glory, Mat. 23. and 23. 28, 33. Jam. 2.
8-12, 22. Deuteronomy. 8. 1. and 5. 31. and 6. 1. and 11. 22.
We must take one and all, one and every one of the ten Words. They are
conjoined into one body of the Law; and must be so likewise in our Obedience:
It is, as it were, one copulative, if you dissolve and break one, you dissolve
and break all, and thereby violate his Authority, who requires obedience to
all, and to every one of them. All the ten Commandments is but one Commandment.
A Law Kingly; A Law of Liberty; A Law by which we must be obliged; A Law by the
works of which men must manifest their Faith to be of the right saving
living-kind, and by which Faith is made perfect. The same Aelohim who spoke one
of the Laws of these ten Words, spoke all and every one of them; in a singular
emiment manner at the Mount Sinai; he spoke at other Seasons; but this Law was
spoken with more solemnity of proclaiming.

This is that Law, which 2 Pet. 2. 4. 11. 22. John 5. 19. John 17. 15. 1 John
3. 8. John 8. 44. Mar. 5. 8. Mat. 12. 43, 45.
the Apostate Angels, were and are trangressors of: Satan is the Evil one; he
sets himself up as a God to be worshipped, which is against the first and
second; he is a blaspheming spirit, against the third Word: He keeps not the
Seventh-day Sabbath, and tempts men to profane it; against the fourth Words. He
has broken the Law of his Relation, and tempts all, both Superiors and
Inferiors, to break the established order, according to the fifth Word. Christ
calls him a Murderer against the sixth Word. An unclean spirit; against the
seventh Word. He is a Thief, a Robber, a Stealer: Robbs men of their holiness
and happiness; steals away the Word out of their hearts; against the eighth
Word. He is a Liar, against the ninth Word. A covetous craver of what is not
his own. And he sollicits men to covet what is their Neighbors, against the
tenth Word. For, this Decalogue is the Rule of Holiness, and of Righteousness,
given to Psalm. 103. 20, 21. and 104. 4. Zech. 1. 10, 11. 1 Pet. 3. 22. Rev. 19.
10. and 22. 9. Mat. 25. 31. Deuteronomy. 33. 2, 3. Psalm. 89. 7.
Angelical Natures, who were summoned to appear at the solemn promulgation, and
proclaiming of this Law. Even the Holy Spirits are doers of Jehovah's
Commandments, and they hearken unto the Voice of his Word. And what is more
yet, this Law will be the perfect, established, continud Law, and Rule of
Holiness, and of Righteousness of the glorified ones for ever in Heaven. How
great therefore is there ignorance, and how gross their mistake, and dangerous
their error, who daringly assert, that this Law was temporay given only to one
national people, of Israel and some few more; as if others were not under the
obligation of it, at least in part, if not in whole. Jam. 2. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
Romans 3. 19-31. and 4. 15. and 5. 13. 1 John 3. 4. John 12. 48. Romans 2. 14, 15,
16. Exodus 12. 38. and 20. 10. and 23. 12. Lev. 4. 13, (...). Gal. 3. 10, 13.
Whereas, it is a Kingly Law, to which all mankind ought to be subject and
conforming, all being concerned in this Law, all being to be judged by this
Law; all sin and duty being to be measured by this Law. There must an universal
regard had to all and to every one of the Commands in the Decalogue, both by
Prince, Minister and People: There is a note of universality, requiring
Obedience to all these Commands, and a word of singularity, forbidding the
breach and violation of any one of them. Though Christ have Redeemed his people
from the Curse of this Law, yet not from the Rule of it: the Redemption from
the Curse of it, does still establish the Rule of it.

And as to this particular Law, of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, there was a
mixed multitude of others with the Israelites, at the very time of proclaiming
it: And the Stranger, yea the very Cattle, are expressly comprehended within the
bounds, and in the very Letter of this Word, and natural Reason for the
observation thereof. And if men will still be so adventurous in this age of
clear Light, and of shining discovery, as to go on to do the labor and work of
their particular Functions and Employments on the Seventh-day, there is no Word
of God that does dispense with this, neither can any word of man bear them out
in it, against a direct prohibition.

The ten words, or the Law of the Decalogue, being that perfect Image and exact
Sampler, according to which all Mankind in the loins of Adam, were at the first
created in all Wisdom, Holiness and Righteousness, as their finite Capacities
could take in, and it being still the Rule and Direction for the renewing and
restoring of Wisdom, Holiness and Righteousness in any of the sons and
daughters of men, it is therefore in a proper sense, the Law of Nature; and it
being so, it has some foundation in the Humane Nature, and so does respect all
Mankind, Jew and Gentile, Male and Female, no Sex nor Age, no Language nor
People excepted; which Law when proclaimed at Mount Sinai Eccles. 12. 13, 14.
universally concerned all the men and women, that then were, since have been,
now are, and that shall be in the after Generations; Romans 5. 12, 13, 14.
the Head and Representative of us all; was under the Direction and Obligation
of this Law, and so are all the Posterity of Adam: Sin was in the World from
Adam, even unto Moses, and Death was reigning in the World from Adam, even unto
Moses, and the Law was existing in the World from Adam, even unto Moses, when
it was a new promulgated; for, where the Law is not in being, sin is not
reckoned: Thus was the first Adam, the representing Type of all Mankind, who
had this complete Law concreated with the Humane Nature. This Decalogical
Holiness and Righteousness, though not the very natural Essence, and real
Substance of the Humane Nature, nor necessarily flowing from the very
principles of that Humane Nature, yet was a concreated perfection in him, and a
connatural suitableness to him; it was implanted in Adam's heat, which Law and
Obedience thereunto was the greatest part of his resembling the Image and
likeness of his Creators and Makers, it being after the same Pattern, a Law
commanding all Good, and forbidding all Evil, a Law of hidden ages, without
limitation of any time, place or person, serving all times, all places, all
persons, being an absolute full Directory both before and since the Fall;
whether this Law were given outwardly by the Creator to Adam, by word and
voice, is not now the matter of inquiry: Let it suffice, that it was given to
Adam, which all his Postery should conform unto: It was continued in the Church
all along, as a Rule of Life; so it was to Genesis 6. 8, 9. and chapter 10. 2 Pet. 2.
5. Fzek. 14. 14. 20. Heb. 11. 7.
Noah, one of the Fathers of the Gentile Nations, who was a just man, perfect
in his Generations, walking with Aelohim, and finding Grace in the Eyes of
Jehovah; he was a Preacher of Righteousness, a very Holy, Righteous Man, and an
Obedient Believer: The Anomous, or lawless times of the later days are compared
to Noah's days in that corrupt age. Thus also to Abraham, Genesis 17. 4, 5, 6.
Romans 4. 16, 17. Gal. 3. 28, 29. Genesis 18. 19, and 26. 5.
who was the Father of many Gentile-Nations, of a multitude of them: this
Abraham had an express full Testimony from the LORD himself, that he was such a
one as obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and kept his charge, his commandments, and
Laws, which three words are the same that are afterward used, by which to
express the ten Commandments, the Judgment, and the Statutes, which God gave
by Moses: Aelohim knew Abraham, how that, he would command his sons, and his
house after him, and they should keep the way of Jehovah, to do Justice and
Judgment. Thus also Exodus 16. 28, 29, 30.
to Moses, and to those of his time, before the promulgation of this Law of the
ten Words at Mount Sinai: Jehovah Aelohim by Moses rebuked those who contrary
to their LORD's commandment, went out to seek food on the Seventh-day Sabbath,
and he expresses himself thus in his convincing reproof, How long will ye
refuse to keep my commandments and laws? (the same words again) implying that,
that rebellious, disobedient people did continue on to be transgressors of this
holy Law of the ten Words, particularly to be breakers of that Law of the
Seventh-day Sabbath, so that, these Laws were well known to the Church and
people of God, by a long continued handing of them down by Posterity from Age
to Age, though practical Anomy, or lawlessness had too much crept in and
corrupted them of that Generation, who neglected and broke them, especially
whilst bondslaves in Egypt. Afterward when this Law was proclaimed and
commanded at Mount Horeb, where was Exodus 12. 28. Numb. 11. 4. Deuteronomy. 29. 11.
Exodus 20. 10.
a great mixture, a miscellaneous multitude of Israelites and Gentiles, who
were present at that Mount; and the stranger is expressly named in the very
Letter of the Fourth Word or Command; so that, he also was under the obligation
to yield obedience unto the Law of the Seventh day Sabbath. The mind of man
having by sin covered over with thick darkness, ignorance, error, and long
di^use, evil inclinations to Vice, having much depraved and blinded the
Understanding, The LORD in words of his own Exodus ^0 1, etc. Job 23 12. and 22.
22 Psalm. 78. 1, 2. and 119. 13, 72, 88. Deuteronomy. 18. 15.-19.
mouth proclaimed this Law, that it might be a manifest Testimony to mankind,
that natural Notions and Novelties of the Law, concerning the difference
between Good and Evil, Duty and Sin, were divinely ingrafted into the Nature of
Mankind, and were consentaneous unto this Eternal Rule of Holiness and of
Righteousness, which is in Aelohim: He instaurs and restores the entire
knowledge of his Will in his Law, by this solemn promulgation, that those old
Letters of it, which were much worn and defaced in the decayed Monuments of
corrupt hearts, might be more deeply engraven, and more plainly read again,
that what men had observed, he by his own speaking Voice, and writing Finger
might rightly explain; thus interposing his own Royal Authority, to beget an
inward testimony in their own consciences, for the justness and equity of his
holy, righteous Law; that all Mankind might be convinced of their sin and
misery, and might thereby be awakened to make out after a remedy, otherwise
they would be left altogether without excuse: Upon the second of the Trumpets
at Mount Sinai, all Mankind was bound to make diligent inquiry after that,
which the LORD, Jer. 10. 7.
who is the King of Nations there spoke, so that, they are all under his Law,
and are all bound thereunto, being all concerned to take notice of the
promulgation thereof by Royal Proclamation, though more especially given forth
at that place of Sinai. It is not unworthy of serious consideration, what a
tonourous loud voice that was, which not only all the Israelites did hear,
Exodus 12. 37.
who yet were about six hundred thousand men, a multitude that took up a great
space of ground, when Aelohim spoke all the Words of the Decalogue? This voice
was also accompanied with a sound of Trumpets, Exodus 19. 18, 19. and 20. 18.
Heb. 12. 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26. Deuteronomy. 33. 2. Psalm. 19. 1*10. Romans 10. 18.
Deuteronomy. 30. 11-14. Romans 10 6, 7, 8. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 16.
so exceeding loud, as that the Lord could make all Mankind then alive to hear
it: such a sound shall go forth in the last day: Besides all this, what
tempests were there at that solemnity, what smoke, what fire, yea, what
thunderings, and what an Earthquake? Such as might shake all the Inhabitants
of the Earth at once, and make them take notice of it: For, not only did Mount
Sinai or Horeb quake greatly, but Psalm. 68. 8, 17, 18. and 114. 1, 2, 7. Heb.
12. 18, 19, 20, 21. 25, 26. Hag. 2. 7. Deuteronomy. 4. 6, 7, 8, 11.
that expression of Mount Sinai also does show, that other parts of the Earth
were shaken too: The Earth was then shaken, as the Earth shall be shaken at
Christ's coming in the later days, when all Nations shall be shaken or moved,
or made to tremble, all and every one of them, so shaken as the Heavens then
will, all of them at once. All the Earth is bid to rejoice at Jehovah's
reigning, which is described Psalm, 97. 1-7. (Heb. 1. 6. Rev. 4. 5.) Psalm. 97.
5. and Judges 5. 5. Mount (...) and Hills in the plural number then flowed and
melted.
by his solemn giving of the Law, which the Church is to rejoice at; and this
is applied unto Christ; all the inhabited World was then enlightened, all the
Earth saw and trembled: he then and their declared himself to be LORD of the
whole Earth in giving forth this Kingly Law. Thus this glorious Lawgiver
himself descended from Heaven with a shout, his Chariot being twice ten
thousand thousands of Angels, the LORD being with them at Sinai in the
Sanctuary; Psalm. 68. 17, 18. Ephesians. 4. 8.
and when he ascended to on high, he led captive a Captivity, he had taken
Gifts unto Adam (observe, so is the Original word, or in Adam, which Paul does
explain to be men, all Adam's posterity, particularly from that time) and also
the rebellious to dwell with that God. Exodus ^2. 49. Lev. 24. 2^. Numb. 15. 16,
19, Gal 3 28. Act. 15. 9, 11. Ezekiel 47. 22, 23. Deuteronomy. 2. 25. and 4. 6, 7, 8.
This Law universally concerns all, for in Christ all are one; and whoever
they were of the Heathen Nations that came into the Church of God in that day,
and were obedient unto all the Laws of Jehovah, they had a part with Israel in
all the holy things of God; the Strangers themselves were under a Promise of
having an allotted Inheritance in the Holy Land, together with the Tribes of
Israel. There were the same privileges to the Obedient; to the Stranger, as to
the Home-born: The same judgments executed upon Transgressors of the Law of the
Ten Words, were he the one or the other. All Nations under Heaven heard report
of Israel, and of the LORD's appearing for them, and giving them his holy Law.
Let the Reader further observe, how it was afterward, when Solomon built the
Temple, at his dedicating of it, he put 1 King 8 4^* 42, 43.
the Stranger into his Prayer, as well as the Israelite: And this wise, just
Judge (especially whilst his heart was right with the LORD) judged according to
this Law of the ten Words, and the judicials annexed thereunto: Psalm. 72. 1-14.
1 King. 4 ^1.
Solomon had his Dominion from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the ends of
the Land; they that dwelt in dry places kneeled before him, and his Enemies
licked the dust: The Kings of Tharshish, and of the Isles rendered an oblation;
the Kings of Sheba and Seba offered a present; and all Kings bowed down to him,
all Nations served him; he reigned over all Kingdoms, who were someways under
his subjection, Mat. 28. 18, 19. Acts 1. 8. Col. 1. 5, 6. Rev. 11. 15. Psalm. 2.
1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8.
being herein a Type of Christ; so that, Solomon was a kind of Universal
Monarch upon Earth, ruling and governing by Jehovah's Laws. Consider, what the
Office and Work of the Prophets was after Solomon's time, even to preach
Commentaries and Sermons upon this Law of the ten Words, directing
transgressors unto the Messiah to procure pardon and reconciliation: And these
Prophets, especially some of them, had not only the Israel of God put into
their Embasse and Commission, but also the Gentile Nations and Kingdoms, and
People, Jer. 1. 10.
let Jeremiah be one eminent instance of this, when the LORD did set over the
Nations, and other the Kingdom; according unto that Word, which he brought or
sent to them from Jehovah, and according as they yielded obedience, or not unto
this Law of Jehovah, so they were either built and planted, or plucked up and
broken down, spoiled and destroyed: Jer. 25. 15-33.
All those Nations, unto whom Jehovah sent Jeremiah with a word of Prophety
were many, not Jerusalem and Judah, the Kings thereof, the Princes thereof, but
also Pharaoh King of Egypt, and his Servants, and his Princes, and all his
People, and all the mingled People, and all the Kings of the Land of Vz, and
all the Kings of the Land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and
Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod, Edom and Moab, and the Children of Ammon, and
all the Kings of Tyrus, and all the Kings of Zidon, and the Kings of the Isles,
which beyond the Sea; Dedan and Tema, and Buz, and all that in the utmost
corners, and all the Kings of Arabia, and all the Kings of the mingled people,
that dwell in the Desert; and all the Kings of Zimri, and all the Kings of
Elam, and all the Kings of Medes, and all the Kings of the North, far and near,
one with another, and all the Kingdoms of the World, which upon the face of the
Earth, and the King of Sheshach. The LORD had a controversy with the Nations,
and he pleaded with all flesh, with all men, by this man's Ministry, the
cracking sound, and the terrible noise whereof went East, West, North and
South, to the ends of the Earth; and that strife in Judgment, which the LORD
had against them, was because they transgressed this holy, righteous, just Law
of his; and were not the Gentiles also then under the obligation and direction
of this Law?

Now that, I am upon somewhat of the Historical part of this Narration, let me
here add some passages both before and after the time, wherein Jeremiah did
live. Let us go back as far as Genesis 6. 8, 9. and 7. 1. Heb. 11. 7. and 2 Pet.
2. 5.
Noah, who found Grace in the Eyes of Jehovah, who was a just man perfect in
his Generations, and who walked with God, Jehovah himself giving of him this
Testimony, he was one who was entire in his obedience to all the Laws of God in
his life and conversation, and he was heir of the Justice or Righteousness,
which is by Faith, and was a Preacher of the same Doctrine of Justification in
the sight of God by Faith in the Messiah. This Noah was Gen 10. throughout and
Chapter 11. 10-32. and 9. 27.
the Father of those Nations and Peoples; who after the Flood did multiply and
spread, and inhabit the Earth: and by this means the Laws of Jehovah were made
known throughout the world, and thus also was the Church scattered and
dispersed in several places; more especially in the days of his Son Shem, there
were visible Church-societies, and public Church-meetings, called, The Tents
of Shem. In and about Abraham's time, who was also Genesis 17. 5. Romans 4. 17. Genesis
^6. 5. and 18. 18, 19.
Father of many Nations, in his Family, the Church of God shined forth in its
glorious luster, and comely beauty; he was one of whom the LORD himself has
witnessed, that he obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and kept his Charge, his
Statutes and his Laws; Jehovah knew him, that he would command his sons, and
his house after him, and they should keep the way of Jehovah, to do Justice and
Judgment: Such care would he take to make known unto others the Commands of
Jehovah: And about Abraham's time, Job and his friends were not strangers to
the Laws of the LORD, though dwelling a great way off in the Land of Vz, off
from Abraham, they also had their Congregations for true pure Worship, Joh 1.
1, 5, 6. and 2. 2. and 23 11, 12. and 31. 26, 27, 27, 28.
Job declaring against Idolatry, and observing instituted times for solemn
Worship; and he answered for himself against the false accusations charged upon
him by Eliphaz, that his foot had held the right path of Jehovah; his way did
Job keep, and not turn away; and the Laws of his lips he did not cast off; Job
did lay up the Words of his Mouth more than his daily bread; whereby it does
appear, that those parts were not strangers to Jehovah's Laws, those more
particularly, which in some respects are more the Laws of his Lips, and the
words of his Mouth. Further, full home to Moses's time, and in his days, we
have footsteps of the Laws of the true Religion, even amongst those who were
none of Isreal's off spring: Numb. 23. 7.
Balaam of Syria in Mesopotamia had a gift of Prophety, and knew the Law of
Jehovah, and being a public Teacher, did spread the knowledge of it about in
Assemblies, Examine we the Captives of the LORD's People, besides some other
smaller scatterings: There was one Captivity of the ten 2 King 17. 6-18. and 18
9, 12. 1 Chronicles. 5. 26.
Tribes by Salmanassar, King of Assyria, who planted those Israelites in Hala
and Habor, by the River of Gozan, and in the Cities of the Medes; whither this
great Conqueror, and mighty Monarch did transplant them, making them to dwell
in places far remote from their own Land, where they communicated the Knowledge
of the Laws of Jehovah. Here was a great dispersion of that Nation; we find not
that any considerable part of these ever returned to dwell again in their own
Country; being placed here by the Assyrian, in Parthia, Media and Persia, there
or thereabouts they still dwelt in the days of Christ, and in the time of the
Apostles: 2 Chronicles. last Chapter, compared with the Books of Ezra and of
Nehemiah.
Another Captivity was of the two other Tribes, Judah and Benjamin by
Nebuchadnezzer, King of Babylon, more than one hundred years after the former:
Israel was first in the Apostasy, and yet Judah would not take warning: At the
seventy years end, many of these two Tribes returned to Jerusalem, and dwelt in
their own Land again, building again the Temple, being encouraged thereto by
Cyrus, re-erecting their City, and restoring their Commonwealth: This also
lasted till Christ's time, and some years after: yet many of the Jews staid
behind in Babylon; great numbers had well accommodated dwellings, and were
loath to leave their Habitations, though in a stranger Land, where Historians
tell us they had their Academies, Schools and Doctors; these two were numerous
dispersions beyond the River Euphrates: A third Captivity by a Grecian King of
diverse after the return from Babylon, whose offspring were carried Captives
into Egypt, where that King reigned, whom he planted in Alexandria, and the
places thereabouts, who had their Synagogues there. Let us take the account
from Scripture Record: A few Days, a Week, or thereabouts after Christ's
Ascension, there were met together of them at the Pentecosts Feast, when men of
several Nations, Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and dwellers in
Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Poutus and Asia Phrygia, and
Pamphylia in Egypt, and the parts of Lybia about Cyrene, and stranger-Romans,
both Jews and Proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, devout men out of Acts 2. 5-11.
every Nation under Heaven (observe every Nation under Heaven) to that these
dispersions were more or less in all Nations (besides the last Captivity Luke
21. 24. The Jews shall be carried Captive over all Nations.
by Titus almost forty years after Christ's Ascension) insomuch as that, in
almost every City of the Gentiles, whither the Apostles traveled and came to
preach Christ, and the glad tidings of Salvation by him, there were Jews who
had their Synagogues: Jam. 1. 1.
James does direct his Epistle to the twelve Tribes scattered abroad; 1 Pet. 1.
1. and 5. 13.
and Peter does inscribe his unto those of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia,
Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia; he salutes them from Babylon which was their
Metropolis; from all which put together, it is evident, that Jehovah's Laws
were published throughout the inhabited World, made known in every Nation, to
the Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; all Mankind being concerned therein, as
to their Eternal Estate: so that, if as Adversaries have confessed, it were the
Gentiles Duty to observe the Law of the ten Words, as soon as these were made
known unto them, which have so much of self-evidence in them, commending
themselves to every man's conscience at first view, we take then their own
concession, and would improve what they grant for their own conviction, that
seeing (besides what was made manifest to Gentile Nations of these Laws, before
Moses's time) there were many present at the very time of Promulgation of the
Decalogue of Mount Sinai, and who knows how many more might hear the sound of
Christ's Voice at that time? and there was one and the same Law to Israelite
and to Gentile, and seeing in the after-dispersions of the Israelites and Jews,
unto the several Nations, into all Nations, these Laws were published abroad
among the Gentiles, that therefore the Gentiles also, who had, or at least
might have had the knowledge of these Laws, were under the obligatory power of
them. Come we now to the New Testament: This does not run in the style, nor
carry the form of enacting new Laws, which were never before; but (as to the
Matter in hand) it does confirm and established the Old Law of the ten Word.
Mat. 5. 17, 19, etc. 19. 17, 18, 19. and 12. 36-40. and elsewhere.
This was the constant Doctrine of Christ, when he spoke to this subject.

This Decalogical Doctrine and Rule of Life, was not at all disanulled, or any
way dissolved by this Lawgiver, but he made it to stand firmly in his place,
and to preach the good old Gospel of Reconciliation through his Name, he being
that very Messiah, who was foretold of should come in the flesh, born of a
Virgin, and to declare the sound old Doctrine of Faith, for the comfort of such
converted Souls, as turned from sin to a Savior, and so obtained Justification
and Salvation by Faith in Christ, Romans 3. 21, 22. Acts 15. ^1. Heb. 13. 8. Rev.
13. 8. Gal. 3. 8. Hab. 2. 4. John 14, 15. Where is the same expression with the
words in the second Commadment. Exodus 20. 6.
which was the same in all ages of the Church, under the several dispensations
of Grace, unto all and upon all that believe, which Truth has Testimony from
the Law and from the Prophets: This Law of the ten Words, the Apostles by
Commission from the LORD Jesus Christ, commend and command to all rational
Creature, as a Rule of Life, in their Preaching and Uniting to the Gentile
Nations, not as by way of new constituting, and re-enacting of Laws, as if they
had been no Laws to them before, but reviving and re-inforcing of these 1 John
2. 7, 8, 2 John 5. 5, 6.
old Laws upon their Conscience; and this they often bring in, especially Paul,
sometimes to prove a Doctrine, othertimes convincingly to reprove for a sin, or
reformingly to correct some Error or Vice, or chastizingly to instruct some
Duty of Holiness and Righteousness, according as the particular occasions for
these were; taking it for granted, that they were a Directory for the Romans 3.
39. 30, 31.
Gentiles, as well as for the Jews. The Apostles, when they preached to Jew or
Gentile, before the New Testament was written, were it a Doctrine or a Duty, or
what else, which they pressed upon the hearers, still they proved what they
taught out of the Acts 26. 22, 23. Romans 25. 4 Ephesians. 2. 19, 20, 21, 22.
Scriptures of the Old Testament, as that which did and does bind (I speak of
the Law of the ten Words) both Jew and Gentile; this was a part of that
word-foundation, on which all the Jewish and Gentile Churches were built.
Examine we some passages in the Epistles to this end. There were Gentiles in
the Church at Rome, and Paul in his writing to them, does evidently declare,
That they were under the Obligation of those Commandments, which were delivered
from God by Moses giving Romans 13. 8, 9, 10. and 1. 29, 30, 31, 32. and 7. 7 22.
particular instances, in several of the Laws of the ten Words, as the Marginal
references will inform. And commending of this Law in, the general at large.
There were Gentiles in the Church at Corinth, and Paul in his first Epistle to
them, does convince them both of sin and duty, 1 Cor. 9. 9, 13. and 14. 34.
from what was written in the Law of Moses. There were Gentiles in the Church
of Galatia, yet Paul does convince them of their guilt and cursedness, whilst
they were, in their sinful state, from those things, Gal. 3. 10, 11, 12. Deuteronomy.
27. 26. Hab. 2. 4. Gal. 5. 14. Lev. 19. 18. Mat 2^. 3^.
which were written in the Book of the Law, and shows them the necessity of
Faith, as to Justification, which he proves out of the writings of an Old
Testament Prophet; and as for Love, he declares unto them, that all the Law is
fulfilled in one Word, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, which was the
same Doctrine with that of Moses, and of Christ. There were Gentiles in the
Church at Ephesus, yet was that Church Ephesians. 2. 19, 20. and 6. 1, 2, 3.
built upon the foundation of the Prophets of the Old Testament (whose writings
were much of them a Commentary upon the Law of the ten Words) as well as under
the Apostles of the New; he urges upon them obedience to the Decalogical Law,
and particularly does single one out of the Ten, about honoring of the Father
and the Mother, which was the first Commandment of the second Table with
promise. An industrious Reader, and a diligent observer, may quickly carry this
through the New Testament, and spare me the further labor by his own
unprejudiced ingenuity. The Gentiles as well as the Jews, are in their natural
corrupt state, in Sin, and under the Curse, 1 John 3. 4. Romans 4. 15. and 5. 13.
which sin is a Transgression of this Law: The Light of Nature in the Gentiles,
especially when rightly and thoroughly informed by the Word of God, approves of
every one of the Laws of the ten Words. There is but Jam. 4. 12. and 2. 8-12.
one only Lawgiver, who has mere and direct Empire over the consciences of all
Mankind, even Jehovah Aelohim, who is able to save and to destroy, according as
men obey him or not: And there is one only perfect Rule of Life, to which all
thoughts, words and actions should be conformed, and by which we shall be
judged at that last Great Day, even the Word of God, the ten Words summarily;
this is the chief, the principle, the supreme Directory: Whatsoever is written
in the heart of the Pagans, so far as it is right, is concordant unto this Law.
The Will of the LORD, concerning what is or is not to be done, which way soever
he has revealed it to all, or to any of Mankind, is still the same with this
holy, righteous Law, when ever he has signified to man, what his requirements
from man in these matters are: Unto his Will must the will of all Mankind be
conformed; all Mankind is always bound to will that, which God would have them
to will; all Mankind, who have the use and the exercise of right Reason, cannot
but acknowledge, that the two great comprehensive Summaries of the ten Words do
bind them all, which are, To love the LORD our God with all our heart, and with
all our soul, and with all our mind; and to love our neighbor as our selves;
all are reduced to this bipartite Universal Law. Though the LORD variously
reveal his Will and his Word for the manner, yet his Will and his Word is one
and the same for the Matter. That Law of the ten Words, which was written on
Tables of Stone, is the same in the true Nature of it, with that which is
written in the hearts of men; all the ten Words are the prime dictates of right
pure Nature, as soon as they are offered to a man's mind and cogitations, they
presently command his assent and consent, and require his Faith and Obedience;
they carry along with them a clear self-evidence, leaving no place for
doubtingness, where the proper signification of the words is sufficiently
perceived, they are self-credible, and shine forth in their own light and
authority, so consentaneous to innate light, is the whole matter of them;
external Revelations thereof, do exactly agree to its internal expressions,
this Law has been publicly Read and Preached in that Ministry of the Word,
Which the Church did enjoy in all Ages, a perpetual means, and a blessed
Instrument which God has used, for information in what is the Duty of Man, for
conviction what is sin in Man, and for exhortation to all Holiness, as an
absolute Law, and an Universal Rule. There never was, never will be, a repeal
of this Law, which is so lively an expression and draught of the Holy Righteous
Nature of Aelohim himself. A perpetual duty has a perpetual binding; these Laws
are necessary everlastingly, and so will the obligation be: Though the Preface
of this Law be objected by some to be occasional and personal, the Law it self
is perpetual, and binding to all: Many of the Posterity of Israel were never
literally themselves bondslaves in Egypt, yet this Law bound them; some
special new peculiar Reason may be brought to enforce a general Duty: The
Mystical intendment of that Preface, does belong even to us Gentiles; Psalm. 66.
6. Hos. 12. 3, 4. We. Us.
For we were delivered in their deliverance, we Believers, as members of the
mystical Body of Christ, so we share in their mercies, and we also are brought
Rev. 11. 8.
out of spiritual Egypt; and even in the Letter it is thus far true, as
Mitzraim may signify, Distressers or Distresses: O, who will give, that the
set time were fully come, Isal. 56. 1 -- (...).
when both Jew and Gentile shall keep Seventh-day Sabbath together; even all
Nations in Jehovah's house, which shall be called an house of Prayer. How can
right reason judge that the Sons and Daughters of men are exempted and freed
from acknowledging of Jehovah to be LORD of the Creature which he has made, by
giving unto him a due stated proportion of time, which is a part of Divine
Worship so natural; and which has been assented to, and used by Mankind since
the beginning of the World: And that there might be no mistake about the
separate, appropriate time for his weekly Worship, he himself has plainly,
expressly prescribed the Seventh day for the Weekly Sabbath in his Word, and
stamped it upon Created Nature; that all Mankind, in the use of lawful
appointed means might come to the true knowledge of it, and might agnize him in
the due observation of it; keeping this instituted time with a discriminative
regard, using it with a select and distinct respect from the other foregoing
days of the same Week, for the solemn Celebration of the Worship of God. The
Sabbath was made Mar. 2. 27. (...) cum accusative* significat propter and ut
plurimum, sinem notat. (...)
for Adam; for Man, as Man; therefore for all men, all men being in Adam. The
Seventh-day Sabbath had its being given it, and its end assigned it even for
the good of Mankind: it was made, born, and brought forth for this purpose; it
was for this that it did exist and come abroad into the created World: Genesis 2.
3. (...)
And was made, that Man might do it as an holy Sabbath day. Hutterus, in his
Hebrew, on that place in Mar. 2. 27. Bagnabur ha Adam.
Mark, has it thus in, to pass over to this Adam; not for the very being of
Man, as a day of rest is some ways necessary every Week after the six foregoing
days of labor, but also for Man's well being, it being necessary for holy
Worship and Services, for Privilege and Communion; made also for ease, rest
and benefit of r other Creatures in their kind, in reference e Exodus 23. 12.
to Man. It is Genesis 2. 2, 3. Exodus 20. 8-11.
the Seventh-day, that passes under the command, in the orderly, weekly,
Revolutions and Successions of time: Wherever all the inhabited Earth over,
there is a Seventh-day weekly, there that people are under the Authority of
this Precept, whatever the variation be, as to the several beginnings and
endings of the days in the several climates; and this is natural in every
Country where ever Nights, and Days, and Weeks are measures of daily and of
weekly time, even from the beginning: Wherever the Darkness began, there
began the Evening; and wherever the Light began, there began the Day part of
the natural Day, which was more especially pointed out after the creating of
the Sun, Moon and Stars on the Fourth Day, before the Seventh-day Sabbath. As
for those Objectors, who quarrel at their scriptural, natural command, by their
supposition, that under the seventieth, and so onward to the nintieth degree,
the day continues in one place about two Months together, in another about four
Months, and in another about six Months out right; these Calenders upon their
own supposition should inquire, whether ever the LORD did appoint such places
for Acts 17. 26.
habitation unto Mankind? What Genealogies, concerning persons and pedegrees,
are there to be found in those places, if there be no exact computation of
Time? God having before appointed the Times? what Geography is there in such
Climates, as to Habitations, or measurings out of the limits of several
Nations? He having appointed the bounds of Habitations. That Scripture in the
Acts, forecited in the Margin, makes mention of all the face of the Earth; Luke
21. 35. Amos 9. 6. Esai. 18. 3. and 40. 22. and 51. 6. Psalm. 24. 1. and 33. 8,
14. Isal. 26. 9. Nahum. 1. 5. Psalm. 49. 1. Isal. 38. 11. Dan* 4. 15. Jer. 17.
6, 19-27.
the Face-part is habitable, by Divine (...)
appointment, that which faceth the Sun in its going and coming. There is
Non-inhabited un-inhabitable Earth spoken off, by the Prophet Jeremiah, who, a
little after that, does make mention particularly of the Seventh-day Sabbath:
It should therefore be examined by these Contenders, whether all Mankind should
not dwell there, where Sabbaths may unquestionably be kept without any such
strifes of disputations, and where the means of saving Knowledge, and of
sanctifying Grace are injoyable? As for the people of half-year-night, and of
half-year-day, or of any people near either the North or South Pole, where some
say is continual Daylight for many years together: Where do the holy
Scriptures make mention of any such people, whom the LORD would have so to
measure their time? they are Scripture-days, which we must stick to, and reckon
by. A Day is not properly merely Time, but a well proportioned measure of Time:
Nights and Days, Weeks, and Months, and Years, have their constant motions,
their successive courses, their unchangeable periods, and renewed returns. In
every Nation and Country, wherever men do inhabit, they must begin the
Seventh day at that time, when that Seventh-day does naturally begin in that
place; and some of the Objectors do acknowledge that, even in those Climates
between seventy and ninety Degrees, there is an equivalent space of time,
measured by hours, days, weeks, months and years, by which they overthrow most
of the force of their own Argument. God commanded no impossibility in Nature,
in requiring a determinate day in every week to be kept, as a weekly Sabbath by
man, by all mankind, though some daringly would infer the quite contrary. We
must take the Seventh-day as the Creator has made, and continued it to us: The
Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath, is not bottomed upon Ethnic Philosophy, which
has corrupted the Principles of Astronomy, and of Geometry, of Theology, and of
Christianity, but upon holy Scriptures, and created Nature. The Seventh-day
Sabbath, instituted and commanded in Paradise, and renewed, and reinforced at
Mount Horeb, (neither of which places were in the lesser Judaea, or Canaan, and
therefore, this Law of the fourth Word was not a local Precept, of force no
where but in that lesser Judaea and Canaan, as some affirm; this Seventh day
Sabbath) is such a kind of day, as may be known, kept and observed by men:
wherever they should inhabit: That day in every week, which follows the six
foregoing known days of labor, is none of ours; it is the day of Jehovah; he
has plainly pointed it out to us in this Law; none need to say, the knowledge
hereof is hidden from us, who shall ascend for us into Heaven, and bring the
knowledge thereof to us, that we may know it, and observe it? it is clearly
demonstrated to us by Aelohim himself: we may not make the Sabbath Day the
sixth day, for then we should show our selves unthankful in not receiving the
LORD's own bountiful allowance unto us of six days for labor in our particular
Functions: Neither are we to make it the eight day, for then we incroach on the
LORD's Right, and are not contented with his liberal Grant of six days for our
own employments. It might be asked of these Objectors, whether God have any
Covenant People near the North Pole and South Pole? if so, whether they have
not the Scriptures? If they have, how then can they so mingle Faith with Genesis
8. 22. Jer. 31. 35. 36. and 33. 20, 25.
several Scriptures, if such a people have not Day and Night in their
successive daily Seasons? was not the whole Scripture fitted for all Mankind,
for all Nations, Mar. 16. 15.
for every rational Creature in those Nations, to whomsoever the glad tidings
of Salvation should come? and did not the LORD hereby confirm the lasting
establishedness of the Covenant of Grace? Is there one Bible for temporate
Zones, and another Book for Poles, and for the inhabitants thereabouts? Day and
Night were made Genesis 8. 22. Psalm. 19. 1, 2, 3, 4.
for the Earth or Land: The Heavenly Luminaries have a preaching Voice to all
Languages and People night and day: To be Eccles. 1. 3, 9, 14. and 2. 11, 17,
18, 19, 20, 22. and 3 16. and 4. 1, 3, 7, 15. and 5. 13. and 6. 1, 12. and 8.

Acts 13. 11. Jer. 31. 35. Mat. 5. 45.
under the Sun is a phrase, which signifies to be in this inferior World:
those that do live in this inhabited Earth, are set out by being beholders of
the Sun, all who have eyes and will use them to that end; the Sun is made for
light by day; and the Sun rises upon the evil and the good. There was a First,
Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Day in every Week here in
England, from the beginning, ever since it was dry Land, and will be so to the
Worlds end, if it still continue dry Earth: and therefore, let us make use of
such arguments as do concern our selves; there has been always a day from one
going in of the Sun, to the next going in of the Sun here in this Island, ever
since it was an Island: the created Sun was just in those very places of the
firmament, at those seasons of the year, as to its setting or rising, as it is
now at the same seasons of the year, by unvariable constancy in his ordinary
course; and our continued certain measure of Days by Divine Ordination in the
revealed Word, and in created Nature, must be Genesis 1. 14.-19.
by the orderly, regular Motion of the Sun, Moon and Stars, this being one
great end of their Creation, and these being made before man was Created; so
that as soon as man had a being, he might measure his time this way; though it
was made known unto him by the LORD, on what day of the week he was created,
and which was the Seventh-day Sabbath, when Jehovah made a promise unto
Abraham, that should be fulfilled some hundreds of years after, it is said,
that in the Exodus 12. 41, 42.
self-same day, the Prophety was fulfilled; so that, there is a certain Rule of
measuring of Time. Oh how much is it to be lamented, that although the Seventh
day Sabbath be so evidently and plainly asserted through the whole Scripture,
yet multitudes who have and do own the Scriptures, will not as yet receive this
holy Law of Christ, whilst there is any thing that does but look like somewhat
of an Objection against it, they take up with every humane conjecture, though
besides and against the Word; many there are who will rather boldly attempt to
throw down all weekly Sabbaths, than humbly submit, and obedientially conform
to Jehovah's determinate weekly time of the Seventh-day, though Scripture and
Nature have jointly established it. Deuteronomy. 30. 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12. 13, 14.
Neh. 1. 8, 9. Jer. 8. 3. and 16. 15. and 23. 2, 3, 8. and 29. 14, 18. and 32.
37. and 40. 12. and 43. 5. and 46. 28. and Acts 2. 5.
When the LORD threatened, and accordingly executed it, to drive his Israel, in
case of such provoking disobedience, into strange Nations, unto the utmost
parts of the Heaven, yet there they were under the Law and Obligation of the
ten Words. In Judaea it self, or Canaan the lesser, the breadth from East to
West was generally fifty Miles, to which, if the Kingdom of Sihon and Og be
added on the other side Jordan (parcels of Canaan the larger, and possessed by
Ruben, Gad, and half Manasses) the breadth reckoned to be eighty Miles, which
does make some variation of minutes, according to this objection, and by the
same reason made it impossible for them to keep, as to the same minute parts of
time, with respect to the weekly Sabbath; but, as for the larger Canaan, which
the Israelitish, and Judaick Kings subdued under their Dominion, this had a
Deuteronomy. 11. 24. Josh. 1. 3. Deuteronomy. 1. 7. Genesis 17. 18.
much larger extent, as has been in part showed already; their foot did tread,
and their coast was from the Wilderness and Lebanon, from the River, the River
Euphrates, and unto the hindmost Sea: The Wilderness of Paran was the Southern
part of Canaan; Lebanon was a Mountain at the Northen bound: Euphrates the
great River was the Eastern border of their Territories, Josh. 1. 4.
the hindmost Sea, or after Sea, called by the Greek and Chaldee the Western
Sea, was the main or great Sea toward the going in of the Sun, this was to the
West their Western bound. This was prophetied in Moses's and Jehovah's time,
and afterward fulfilled in 2 Chronicles. 9. 26. Psalm. 89. 36, 37. and 72. 5, 10, 17.
Solomon's days; where the Nations subdued were to fear and to worship, where
the Sun and Moon went forth and went in, in their successive courses; the
Chaldee does interpret: with the rising of the Sun, and in the light of the
Moon, that is, at Morning and at Evening, Act. 26. 7.
as the twelve Tribes are said so instantly to serve God: Genesis 10. 7. 1 King.
10. 1.-10. Mat. 12. 42.
Those Countries, which were far South, where the inhabitants dwelt by the Main
Sea, as Ethiopia and Arabia, dwelt in by the Posterity of Sheba and Seba, the
Nephew, and Son of Cush, the Son of Cham, the Son of Moab; the Queen of Sheba,
or of the South, submitted to Solomon: Psalm. 72. 8, 9. 1 King. 4. 21.
He had Dominion from the Salt Sea, the Lake of Sodom to the main Sea, the
limits of Judaea; from the River Euphrates, which was Eastward; from the River
to the Land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: The Ethiopian
Deserts or dry places were subjected to him, they bowed down their faces to the
ground before him, as is the manner in the Eastern Countries: Psalm. 72. 17. See
the Margin in some English Bibles, Acts 11. 26. Heb. 2. 13.
Here Christ was preached, and his name was filiated, that is, Christians were
there, for as a Son continues his Father name, so was Christ's Name there
continued in those that believe on him; which name of Christians and of
Children, was long after revived under the New Testament; and how were they
Christians, if they did not profess and practice obedience to Christ's Law of
his ten Words? Men of all Nations, even in Solomon's time counted and spoke of
Blessedness in Christ, in being brought under his Holy and Righteons Laws, and
in their subjection to him and to them: Psalm. 72. 19.
All the Earth was filled with Christ's Glory, and the Nations blessed the Name
of his Glory. Did not Solomon expect, that these submitting Nations should
receive Laws from the Messiah? and was it a reason of any weight or force then
to object against the Seventh-day Sabbath, because of the different Horizons
and Climates?

From Evening to Evening is the first great Natural measure of a long Day
according to Primitive created Order. A late Author has brought in some
objections against this, which do call for some answer. The Artificial Day, or
Daylight, says he, was anciently before Isreal's going out of Egypt, counted
the beginning or former part of the Natural Day, and the Night the later part
of the said Natural Day; in that when the parts of the Natural Day are
mentioned in Scripture, before Isreal's coming out of Egypt, Genesis 1. 16, 17, 18.
the Morning was set before the Night; and because, at what time soever, or
hour of the Daylight, the Scripture speaks of the following Night, it speaks
not of the Night, as belonging to the Day following; Genesis 19. 34. and 31. 42.
and 26. 24. Numb. 33. 3. 1 Samuel 19. 11. Mat. 6 34. Jam. 4. 13, 14. Exodus 13.
21, 22. Lev. 8. 35. Numb. 9. 21.
but as belonging to the day before going; and because our Sunday-Sabbath,
says he, or LORD's day, is the very same day of the week, which was anciently
observed by the Jews and Gentiles, for the solemn day of their solemn weekly
Worship, beginning at the light part or morning of the day; because Isreal's
coming out of Egypt, and after that by the Gentiles; but Moses put back the
account to begin the Sabbath Day Lev. 23. 32.
at the evening before, whereupon they so began their weekdays also, whereby
their Sabbath Day was measured out unto them, to be their Seventh-day,
otherwise their Seventh-day would not have been proportionable to their six
days of labor; and so Christ reassumed and brought forth all that daylight,
and put it to the next day, with which together with the night following, he
made a new distinct day by rising early in the Mat. 28. 1.
morning of that new made day; and because, the days of the first week of the
Created World were Genesis 1.
creational, extraordinary universal days, when it was day, it was day over
the universal World; when it was night, it was night every where over the whole
Universe, both in regard of the beginning, and ending of the day and the night.
Thus he:

Whereas he does affirm, that when the parts of the natural day are montioned
in Scripture before Isreal's coming out of Egypt, the morning was set before the
night, let the History of the Creation in the beginning of the Bible be read,
and there it may be found expressly in the very Letter, that Genesis 1. 5, 8, 13,
19, 31.
the Evening is put before the Morning in every one of the six foregoing days
of the week, the Evening and the Morning were one day, the Evening and the
Morning were the Second day, the Evening and the Morning were the Third day,
the Evening and the Morning were the Fourth day, the Evening and Morning were
the Fifth-day, the Evening and the Morning were the Sixth day; they were then
so, they have continued to be so, they now are so, and they, ever will be so to
the Worlds end, as long as such Evenings and Mornings do last, this Author
endeavors to darken the clearness of this evidence, by a bold asserting,
that Moses in writing the Book of Genesis after Isreal's coming out of Egypt,
when their day, their natural day being to begin at Even, did therefore also so
set it down in his History of the Creation; For, says he, if Moses should have
said, the Morning, Genesis 1. The morning and the evening was the first, second,
third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh day, putting the Morning before the
Evening, he might have seemed thereby to have disliked the said change
appointed by God as aforesaid, of making the evening, the beginning of each
day, after their coming out of Egypt: Thus he reasons, and yet acknowledge,
that Moses was inspired by the appearance of God to him: but this arguing does
carry no probation along with it; they are not right words, and so have no
forcibleness with them; would the Penmen of this Holy Writ, which was dictated
to him by the Holy Spirit, speak and write quite contrary to the created Nature
of Darkness and of Light, lest he should seem to dislike a pretended charge?
Especially this Author saying (though without proof) that such a change was
appointed by God? was there any just cause and good reason for such a man of
God, to dislike any of God's appointments? of all the Prophets, that arose in
Israel, Deuteronomy. 34. 10.
was there any like unto Moses, whom Jehovah Aelohim knew face to face? The
things which Moses wrote, were they his own? No; Chron. 34. 14.
but the Law of the LORD by his hand? Psalm. 103. 7. Dan. 9. 11. Mal. 4. 4.
Did not the after-Prophets bear witness to this Moses? had not Moses Letters:
Testimonial from the LORD Jesus Christ himself, and Luke 24. 25. 27, 44.
of All that he spoke and wrote? That which Moses said, Mar. 7. 9, 16. Mat. 25.
3, 4.
was it not the Commandment of God? Has not Christ willed y to hear this
Moses, which if any do not, neither will they be persuaded, though one rise
from the dead? What God spoke unto Moses, Mar. 12. 26. and Mat. 22. 31.
compared.
does not God spoke the same unto us, Compare Mat. 22. 24. with Mat. 12. 19.
that which Moses did say, is it not as much as Moses wrote unto us? Heb. 3.
(...), 5.
Was not Moses faithful in all Christ's house, What? would the Infallible holy
Spirit dictate according to the disliking fears of man, and not according to
the true nature of created beings?

Whereas, he further says, that, at what time soever, or hour of the
daylight, the Scripture speaks of the following night, it speaks not of the
night as belonging to the day following, but, as belonging to the day before
going; I answer, that, in those Scriptures, Genesis 19. 34. and 31, 40.
which he does cite, where the word Aemesh is used, some of the best
Lexicographers and Translators do render it Cocceius. Aria^ Montanus, and
others which I consulted.
past time, and the Past night. As for the LORDS appearing to Isaac, The same
night, or that self same night, there is nothing either expressed or employed in
this, that does say, Genesis 26. 24.
it was the night belonging to the immediate preceding day light; neither any
such thing in the forementioned Scriptures in the margin; but, that self same
night does point out that eminent remarRable night of Jehovans appearing to
Isaac to encourage him against his fears, promising unto him his presence,
blessing of him, and confirming his faith in the multiplication of his seed,
Numb. 33. 3.
the place in Numbers has a quite contrary proof to what this Author does bring
it in for: For, this morrow, did make up the self-same-day with the foregoing
Night, as may be discerned, if that Scriptures cited Exodus 12. 41, 42. Deuteronomy.
16. 6.
in the Margin be compared with it, That self-same-day, That same which
followed after in time did belong to that Night, that very Night, that same;
For otherwise the Israelites did not come out of Egypt in one day, but in part
of one day, and in part of another day; the same Passover day which began at
even, was the day of their going out; and this Author confesses, that, the
Natural day began at even, when the Israelites were come out of Egypt. The
night was made the former part of such a day; Genesis 15. 13. Act. 7. 6. Exodus 12.
41.
This was prophesied of four hundred years or more before the full
accomplishment thereof.

That place, which he does urge out of 1 Samuel 19. 11.
Samuel, does show, that Saul had an intention to have David to be slain in the
Morning, if he did not make an escape in the Night; but, that, it should
therefore hold forth the Morning of another natural day, to which the foregoing
night did not belong, is this Authors mere saying, without any evidence in this
place.

Those expressions Mat. 6. 34. Jam. 4. 13, 14. (...), (So Genesis 30. 33.) (...).
in Matthew and in James, To Morrow, does signify the time coming: but, how
can this convince us, that, This, To Morrow, does demonstrate the Natural day
to begin in the Morning? for, we have the same expression in the significancy
of it in Hebrew, above threescore times in the Old Testament, after the
Israelites coming out of Egypt, relating, some to Religious, others to Civil
affairs; in which time this Author does acknowledge that the Night was made the
former part of the Natural day? Exodus 16. 23. and 19. 10. and 32. 5, 6, 30.
Levit. 23. 11, 15, 16. Number. 11, 18. Josh. 5. 11, 12. and 7. 13. Exodus 17. 9.
and 18. 13. Number. 14. 25. and 16. 5, 7, 16, 41. Josh. 3. 5. and 5. 12. 2 King.
6. 28. and 7 1, 18. and 8. 15. Prove. 3. 28. and 27. 1. Jer. 20. 3, 7. Zephan.
3. 3. Psalm. 22. 13. and 56. 12.
amongst which these in the Margin are some; so that, even Then as to Civil
affairs the Israelites did not commonly account the Artificial day of day light
to be the former part of the Natural day; which though sometimes asserted by
this Author, is yet elsewhere in the same Treatise contradicted by him, when he
confesses the week days had the same measure even then with the seventh day
Sabbath which began at even, so that, how to reconcile such contrary sayings to
one matter I discern not, much less to reconcile them both to the Scriptures of
truth, when men do forget in one part of a book what they write in some other
part of it, inconsistent with a former passage. His other Scriptures out of
Exodus 13. 21, 22. Levit. 8. 35. Numb. 9. 21.
Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, do, not witness what he does bring them into
the court for, seeing, although the Day-part be set in order of place in those
citations before the night-part, yet this does not there testify, that,
therefore the Day-part must in order of Nature and of Time, be before the
Night-part in the Natural-day, 1 Samuel 25. 16. 1 King. 8. 29. Esther 4. 16.
for diverse other Scriptures do place the Night before the Day, and that, after
Israel came out of Egypt, when he himself owneth the Natural-day, to begin at
even. The same we may also find Mar. 4. 27. and 5. 5. Luke 2. 27. Acts. 20. 31.
1 Thessalonians. 3. 10. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 8.
in the New Testament both before and after Christ's resurrection, after which
this Author would have the morning of the Natural-day to be in time before the
Evening of it. He, that would be informed in the Genesis 1. 5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31.
true right order must resort to the first established Law in primitive created
Nature, and in Scripture determinations, when this case is professedly treated
of: and therefore Dan. 8 14. Gnereb-boker, S^e the Margin in the English
Bibles. A natural day is An evening-Morning. 2 Cor. 11. 25. It is Nuchtheme^on,
A Night-day. See Act. 27. 27, 33. Compare also Genesis 1. 5. 8, 13, 19, 23, 31.
Exodus 27. 21. Levi^. 24. 3. Psalm. 55. 17. Dan. 8. 26 Esther 4. 16. Jer. 31. 35.
and 33. 20, 25
both in the Hebrew and in the Greek, when both the parts of a Natural day are
joined together in one Word, the Evening and the Night are put before the
Morning and the day, So that, there is no putting back by Moses, nor bringing
forward by Christ, the account of Nights and of Days, but they have all along
continued as they were at the first made by the unchangeable Laws of the
Creation: For, hereby does the LORD prove the unchangeableness of his Covenant
of Grace. The first Creational days and week were the just measure of every
after week, and of the days thereof in the ordinary course, succession, and
revolution; and particularly the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh days of that
first created week were measured out by the heavenly luminaries, and the three
foregoing days of that week were of the same nature. As to evening, darkness
and night going before the after morning, light, and day: all and every of the
seven days of that week, As days, were such as the after-days, and were the
measure of after-days in their stated order; it was night and day in the
several parts of the earth, as it is now: the well settled frame of the standing
statute of created Nature is not to be inverted. Could not, did not, the
creating Aelohim carry the foregoing created evening, darkness and night, and
the following, morning light and day in the same moments of time to cause the
same beginnings, continuings and endings of nights and of days, wheresoever and
whenever it is night and day, any where, in any part of the earth then as it
is now? Darkness and light were severed, then both in nature and in time: this
Author does acknowledge a revolution of them on the first created day: and
that, the night was before the day in one Hemisphere. From this part of the
earth is the Scripture account, in the opposite part it is Sea; by his own
arguing, it could not be night every where at the same time, for light was in
the other Hemisphere, and so the first day did not every where begin at the
same time; for, it could not be day where it was evening and dark, nor night
where it was morning and light; thus, has he entangled himself in his own net
of humane reasoning, which he so spread to have catched seventh-day sabbath
observers. If when Sun, Moon, and Stars were created and put into their moving
walks, on the fourth day, they made an universal day that so all seven might in
a just proportion of length and number answer to one another, as he affirms,
Then at the same time it was night in some parts at full noon when the Sun
shone in its strength and the light was clearest and fullest; and then also it
was day in some parts at the mid of night when it was darkest (as the two parts
of a natural day are distinguished) and yet both these he asserts to be an
universal day, contrary to Scripture and Nature, he says, a little after,
that, Sun setting was in some places on the fourth day before Sunrising, and
therefore it may be inferred according to this concession, that, it was night
in some places when it was day in other places; in other places it was
Sunrising before it was Sunsetting; he, who would make it otherwise in
respect of the wide earth, must take this Authors bare words for it without any
proof: our weeks and the days thereof here in England are as the first week and
the days thereof were at the first creation of this part of the earth, unless
he can evidence, that it was since that brought hither from some other part of
the earth, and if he could do that, yet it would make nothing for the proving
of his main general assertion, whilst the main of the present inhabited earth
does stand firmly in the same place where it was at the first before it was
inhabited.

There is one part of his objection, which does expect to have somewhat replied
to it, wherein he thus argues and reasons; our Sunday sabbath, says he, is
the very same day of the week, which was anciently observed by Jews and
Gentiles for the solemn day of their solemn weekly worship, beginning at the
light part or morning of the day, before Isreal's coming out of Egypt, and
after that by the Gentiles, and since Christ's time by Gentil pagans and by
Gentil-Christians, thus far he, the proof whereof, he refers us to some
humane Authorities, having quite contrary humane histories, which do relate a
different practice, some whereof I am upon this occasion even necessitated to
point unto; for, it is Scriptural Authority and Law, and created nature and
order, which we resort unto for the proof of our position, and therefore the
Reader is here desired to bear a little herewith, seeing I am even driven into
it, so many several Treatises having been sent and brought unto me, which some
are under a temptation to misjudge to be unanswerable, unless somewhat be said
and written to stop the mouths of such gainsayers.

The Pagan Sun worshippers kept Sunday (as this and other days of the week have
their heathenish names still kept up besides the word and contrary to it) the
Jews kept Saturday; for the Heathen charged the Jews, that, they worshipped
Saturn for their God; so does one Cor. Tacitus.

consecrated to Saturn Faustus Manicheus. Augustine, l. 1. de consens. Evang. c.
22. and (...). 18. Contra Faust. cap. 2. and 5.
: Another called the Rest, or quietness, or leisure time of the Sabbaths

Sabbath is not the same day of the week observed by the Jews Joseph. Antiq. l.

the Pagans did draw the Ionic or Asiatic Jews into their Civil Courts on the
seventh day, which the Jews complained of to him that was the Superior Power in
Civil Government. A learned Minshe^^.

among Pagans. Joseph de bello Judaic. l. 1. c. 5. and Antiq. l. 12. c. 1, 2, 8.

The Warring Pagans both before Christ's being born of a Virgin and also since,
did purposely assault the Jews in fight on the seventh-day: The Pagans did
scoff at the Jews Sabbath, of which we have an account given in Scriptures and
humane histories do also speak and write the Lam. 1. 7. Aug. (...). 6. de Civ.

time.
of the Sun, because they kept and observed the first day of the week their
Sunday. The Christians do generally call the first day of the week the Sunday
and their Sabbath Day, as this objector does, whereas Saturday has the name of
Sabbath in all their Law Books in the English Ancient Records. This objector
does confess, that, their Sunday-sabbath could not be the Jews
Saturday-sabbath; so that if there were no change of the day of the week from
the seventh, the last, to the first in Moses's time, which this Author calls
the seventh day, all his building is upon the sand, and does totter and fall.
Another great Verstegan, in his Antiquities, from p. 68, 10 page, 80. and p. 10.
p. 9^ 10, 11. 12, 71, 72, 188.
Antiquary does reckon the seven days of the week according to their course and
order, Sunday the first and so onwards, Saturnday the seventh, as most
Christians now do; the most Ancient Germans being Pagans, as having
appropriated their first day of the week to the particular adoration of the
Sun, whereof that day does yet in our English Tongue retain the name of Sunday,
the next day, was Monday, appropriated to the Moon, as the second great
luminary, the third day was Tuesday from Tuisco the reputed god among the
Ancient German Pagans, the Conductor of the Teutonic people at the confusion of
Babel. This objector does confess, that, Adam knew from the standard of Gods
working the six foregoing days, and resting the seventh, what was a day, a
week, and the boundary thereof, that, in the state of iunocency the seventh day
was Sacred, and that, this seventh day Sabbath was sanctified by God, and
celebrated by our first parents in Paradise; and that never was the week
counted to be more or less than seven days with any people: Therefore, I infer
from hence, that, Adam kept the weekly seventh-day in order of time from the
creation, As the weekly Sabbath Day in imitation of the Creators Rest; and Adam
lived nine hundred and thirty years; which observation he left upon record for
after-ages, Act. 13. 14, 42, 44. and ^6. 13. and 17. 2. and 18. 4.
the holy Spirit calls the seventh day the Sabbath day after Christ's
Ascension into Heaven; Many of the Authorities from humane Histories, which
this objector does quote, do militate for the LORDS seventh day against the
Sunday Sabbath of this Author. Beda, in his ^lexameron. Philo. judaeus, de vita
Mosis, l. 2. Joseph. contra Ap. l. 2. Mercer. in Genesis 2. 23. Aug. S^e^chius on
Genesis 2. Clem. Strom. l. 5. Eusebius. de praeparat. Evang (...). 13. c. 17. Ri^et
on Genesis 2. and in his Disser^. de Orig. ^eb.
An Ancient Historian of our own witnesses, that the Rest on the seventh day
was wont always to be celebrated: who is there, says another, that does not
honor that sacred day returning each Septenary of seven days? neither is there
any City of the Greeks, says a third, or of the Barbarians, nor any nation, to
whom the custom of the seventh day, in which we Rest, has not come; The first
Fathers, says a fourth, being taught of God, kept the seventh day holy to God;
a fifth speaking of the seventh day, affirms it to have been Venerable and
Sacred in all ages among all Nations, I might add, a sixth, seventh, eighth,
and many more, one calls the Dominical day Tertul. de Idol. c. 14. An. 200.

calls the Dominical day, the eighth day from the Creation, which is also the

the eight from the Creation; Another does give it the name of the first after
the Sabbath, a third does describe it by the beginning of days, which a fourth
does call the first day of the week; a fifth does style it in a Sermon of his,
the first day of the week: a sixth names it, the eighth day, which is also it
self the first, a perfect week. In the second Century, Christians, on the first
day of the week worshipping toward the East while they prayed, fell into a
suspicion of worshipping the Sun. Another affirms, that, God rested when he had
finished the former creation, and therefore the men of that generation observed
the Sabbath on the seventh day: by, that Generation, he speaks of the whole
time from the beginning of the world full home to Christ; which is a Testimony,
that, the seventh day was not changed in Moses's time from what it was before
Moses; one of the Authors cited in the Margin does acknowledge, that, the Pagan
gentiles observed the seventh day, every where this custom prevailed to observe
the same seventh day, which the Jews used to keep holy, so common was it grown:
Leo. ^p. 81. c. 1.
Pleaders for the Dominical day do lay the foundation of their observing of it
upon Christ's Resurrection, which they assert to be on the first day of the
week; on this day, says one of them speaking of the Dominical day, the world
received its beginning; The first day of the week, because of Christ's
resurrection, says another, is the birthday of the whole humane nature; Why
did the Heathen, the Pagans scoff at the Jews for observing the seventh day as
Sabbath, if they both kept one and the same day before Moses, and a different
day after Moses and after Christ, which Ov^d. l. 1. de Art. amand. and l. 1. de
remed. amor. Plutarch. de superstitione. Tacitus Agatharchid.
the Pagans called the seventh day? why do they name the seventh day which was
kept festival in Palestine, if another day were the seventh? and why do they
call the Jews seventh days by the name of Sabbaths, if they did not judge them
so to be? and why do they give unto the Jews the name of Sabbatarians? several
of the Pagans do deride all Sabbaths; one of them says, that, the Sabbaths of
the Jews were dedicated to sloth or idleness. Another calls the observation
of the Sabbath an evil solemnity and Foolishness, and says, that, to observe
the Sabbath was ridiculous, because, that, in so doing they lose the seventh
part of their life, Dr. Bound. p. 22, 64, 65, 90, 265.
one of the First day-men writes, that, the Gentiles and all the Heathen did
not keep the seventh day which the Patriarchs did according to Institution,
they did altogether hate the only true holy day, and would not observe it
themselves, but, they erected other days to an holy and Religious use; the
Romans, he says further anciently instituted every ninth day, and the
Graecians every eighth day, and neither of them the seventh: the Romans
dedicated their ninth day to Jupiter, the Graecians consecrated the eighth unto
Neptune; but, neither of them consecrated the seventh unto the LORD; and these
two were the chief of the Heathen Philosophers; we, says he, speaking of
Christians, that are for the First Day, keep not the same day which was from
the beginning. So that the Reader may by this discern, how much men will be at
a loss, who resolve this case into humane Authorities and Histories, which are
many of them so quite cross and contrary to Scripture-truth, and which do so
contradict one another: satisfaction and settlement, such as is sound and
demonstrative, can never come in that way. Dr. Young, in his Dominical-day; as
it is translated into English (although I have his Treatise in Lo^in) to which
Edition I refer in the Pages, both here and a little before cited. page 73, 74,
110, 111, 112, 113. (Philo de mundi opificio and de vita Mosis) See Dr. Young.
p. 121, 122, 123, 124.
Another Advocate for the first day does declare, that, Cyprian, Tertullian and
Hilary do call the Dominical-day the eighth from the Creation; the Enemies
derided the Christian-sabbath, says Ruffinus: Athanasius says, that, he
observed the Sabbath day, not as it was in the first age, in the beginning of
the world; Philo the Apostles contemporary, asserteth the seventh day-sabbath's
observation to be according to the Law of nature; constituted by God at the
Creation of Nature: Athanasius acknowledges that the seventh-day sabbath was
observed from the Creation till Christ. The seventh day of every week in order
from the Creation was Sacred, not only to the Hebrews but Gentiles; thus the
Author, cited in the Margin; with much more, if it were needful which might be
added, to discover the invalidity of the objectors arguing, who does bring many
humane Authorities against himself and his own assertion, and against whose way
of arguing many contradicting humane authorities are and may further be
brought; so widely will men wander, whilst they go astray from the word-way of
the LORD's Precepts. Dr. Usher in his Letter to Dr. Tuiss. published by Dr.
Bernard. page 75, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89. In these pages are
more such humane Authorities, if we bad a mind and will to multiply them.
One of the learnedest in this Century does affirm, the (...) (the express
Letter of it, as it is written and read in its obvious meaning) of the fourth
Commandment points at the Sabbath, as it was in the first Institution, the
Seventh day from the Creation. The very Gentiles both Civil and Barbarous, both
ancient, and of later days, as it were by an universal kind of Tradition,
retained the distinction of the Seven Days of the Week, notwithstanding that
great variety of differences, which is betwixt them in the ordering of their
Years and Months: Every where they attributed some Holiness to the Seventh-day;
they were not ignorant, that the Works of the Creation were finished on the
Seventh.

But whither have these Objectors diverted me? I now return.

O what a many peculiar honors has the LORD put upon this Law in his Word. 1
King. 8. 9. Exodus 25. and 16. 33, 34. Numb. 7. 89. 1 King. 6. 19. Psalm. 28. 2.
The Ark in which was nothing else put, but only these ten Words, had many
Dignities conferred upon it. It was made of durable Wood, not so subject to
putrefaction; this Wood was overlaid within and without, with pure Gold; It had
a Crown of Gold round about: The Pot of Manna was before it, by which Jehovah
Aelohim confirmed the Seventh-day Sabbath: Out of this Ark Jehovah spoke by
Oracle: This was an assurance of Aelohims gracious presence amongst his people,
and that he did dwell there: There must they worship before him, with a
proomise of acceptance. The Propitiatory covered it: There, between the
Cherubims, the LORD himself sat. I could fill up much more paper upon this one
Argument. The Lawgiver himself was the Writer of this Law. Isai. 42. 4. Mat.
12. 21.
The Law is one of Christ's Names. Exo. 28. 19, 30, 35. and 29. 11, 22, 25, 42.
1 King. 8. 62. Psalm. 50. 8. Luke 1. 8.
The Name of Aelohim was given to the Ark of the Covenant: It being an
illustrious Symbol of his presence. All the prefiguring, prophetical Scriptures
in the Old Testament, relating to this Law, have a New Testament significancy
and sense. What a multitude of Scriptures might here be heaped together, in
commendation of this Law? It has an invincible firmness! There Precepts are
true and certain! The Church is governed by this Law as its Rule! Christ
himself submits his Doctrine, to be examined by it! There is Perspicuity in
this Law! It is perfect in its Nature and Doctrine! Romans 7. 8, 9. Psalm. 119.
throughout; and often elsewhere.
When the Spirit of the LORD does bring it on with living Efficacy, and with
saving Power, O how wonderful are its effects! It begets Faith, its
Regenerates, it nourishes, it makes to be growing, it inlightens, it gives
heavenly saving Wisdom, it restores and strengthens the Soul, it exciteth a
lively firm Consolation, it joyeth and refreshes the Heart, it kindle^h a love
to God in the Heart, it furnishes with Armor aginst temptations and assaults,
It does guard against captious Sophistry and Treachery; It leads to Life, and
to eternal Salvation: Nothing may be added to it, or taken from it. Moses leads
to Christ, and Christ sends to Moses. They appeared together at the Mount of
Transfiguration. The characteristical Notes, and the distinguishing Marks, that
do difference an Evangelical Reformed Christian Church and Disciple, from an
Antichristian Synagogue, and a Worshipper of the Beast, are the keeping of the
Commandments of God, and the having the Testimony of Jesus Christ. Much peace
to them that love Jehovah's Law, and to them no stumbling block. This will be
the everlasting Rule of the Holiness and Righteousness of glorified Ones in
Heaven. If some one will do, he shall know of this Doctrine, whether it be of
God, or not. O the happy straight goings on of that man, who fearing Jehovah,
who delighting greatly in his Commandments! Heb. 5. 9. Act^ 5. 32.
Christ is the Author of Eternal Salvation unto all them that obey him, and the
Father gives his Spirit unto such.

How freely and delightfully could I here enlarge in the commendation of this
excellent perfect Law; Romans 7. ^^.
How good, how holy, how just, is this Law for the matter, intrinsecally,
externally good and holy, and just, consonant to the eternal Justice, and
Holiness, and Goodness, which is in the LORD himself, whose Authority is
stamped upon this, and as such is given forth from him unto us to be a Rule.
How can this be abrogated or changed, which is so full and comprehensive of
that Righteousness and Holiness, which is the perfect Image of the pure
unchangeable Jehovah Aelohim? were we more thoroughly conformed to it in our
natures and actions, we should be tied to it, and to the Commander of it, with
an everlasting love, Psalm 119. 97, 113, 119, 1^7, 159, 162, 165, 167. Psalm.
139. 24.
love beyond expression: How can the obligation of its mandatory power be other
than eternal and immutable! O how good is it in its kindly effects,
inlightning, converting, restoring, quickening, comforting, and many other ways
operating upon the heart, when the holy Spirit does put life and power into
men's hearts for these productions! This way of obedience to the ten Words, is
the way of lasting, of hidden age, and of everlastingness, that way, which
alone of all ways will continue and hold out to the utmost duration, when all
the ways of Anomous of lawless ones shall perish. Christ's Disciples should
evidence and manifest their love to him, by their friendliness to his Law: The
Doctrines and the Precepts of this Rule, the promises and the threatening of it,
do some way or other lead to Christ, and have him for their scope, and this
under the old as well as new Administration! were not the believing Israelites
to look unto the covenanted Messiah, and to act Faith upon him? Were they not
by all the Types and Figures, and Shadows of him, to make application of him to
themselves, and of themselves to him, and and to confirm their expectation of
his coming? Was not this that which made all their prayers and other services
acceptable, their spiritual relation which they had unto him? How could mercy
be done unto thousands, as the Letter of this Law does include, if we exclude
this Messiah, or Christ out of his own Laws, as if he were not intended there:
The Administration of this Law was Evangelical in its great design, and main
intention. Can a believer but highly prize Christ, and esteem him precious,
when he does so look into the Jam. 1 23, 24, 25.
glass of this Law, as to view and loath the spots on the face of his nature
and life, the least of which this Law does discover, and will not hide any of
his deformities, nor cover his wrinckles, nor paint his ugliness? In this case,
how great are the benefits by Christ to the Believer, who is made of God to the
Believer Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption? The
more that a Beliver does honor Christ, the more will he be carried out in a
Spirit of Love to delight in the Commands of Christ: When Adam was most holy,
he was most obedient, and when he was most obedient, he was most acted by a
principle of Love: Thus the holy blessed Psalm. 103. 20, 21.
Angels do all in obedience and love to Christ; for they also are under this
Law, and at command: Even the LORD Jesus Christ John ^5. 9, 10.
himself kept these Commandments of his Father, and did abide in his Love; his
ready, cheerful, obedience to his Father, must have an eye to a commanding Law.
The Law of the ten Words, though it include a perfect holiness in its
requirements yet does it not exclude an Advocating Mediator in its intendments.
O how will men's faces be covered with shame at the last, when they shall be
judged by that Law, which now they so much contend against? When the LORD had
given forth the Law of the ten Words; it is said, Deuteronomy. 5. 22.
Not has he added: He added no more commands of this Nature: This was Deuteronomy. 1.
3. Exodus 19. 1.
almost forty years after the promulgation of the Decalogue at Mount Sinai. He
has not added, he does not add, he will not add, will still be a true saying,
relating to this, no more commands of this kind and sort; for they are but ten
Words, a perfect Law, Deuteronomy. 4. 2. and 12. 32. Prove. 30. 6. Mat. (...). 17, 18.
to which nothing is to be added, and from which nothing is to be subtracted.
In this Book of Deuteronomy, Moses repeated the ten Words or Commandments, and
presses to the observation of this Law, confirming the whole of it, with
promises to the believing and obedient, and with threatenings against the
unperswadeable and transgressing. And Christ himself a little before his death
foretold of the continuance of the Seventh-day Sabbath, calling it by the Mat.

name of Sabbath; well toward forty years after his death; though for the
advancement of Sabbath-learning, I propound to the Vertuoso, and the Ingenuoso
of the times to consider,

Q. Whether that expression, Mat. 24. 20. Pray ye that your flight be not in
the Sabbath, do not relate to all and every of those great periods of time, the
destruction of Jerusalem, the downfall of Antichrist, and the Tribulation of
that time, which shall make way for the later-day-Glory? this Seventh-day
Sabbath will last as long as this world lasts, to the utmost end of it.

Thus Reader, have I through Mercy and Grace, somewhat traded, according to my
Talent received, for the Honor of my LORD, and of his Works, Words, and Law;
and for the promoting of Scripture-sciences and Arts. It is with him what
entertainment he will give it in thy heart, and what blessing he will there put
upon it.

O the Phil. 3. 8.

receive Commands. They will treasure up Knowledge, to draw it out in season.
Wisdom is found in their lips. To the mouth of their Understanding shall they
be praised. Prove. 13. 10, 13, 14, 15, 20.
The Well-advised will hearken unto Counsel, and those that fear the Command
shall prosper: Whereas the proud will be always wrangling and contending;
Contemners of the Word will quickly be corrupted. The Law, the Doctrine, the
Institution of a wise man is a clear Vein and Fountain of Life's; and a good
Understanding will give Grace. Prove. 14. 6, 7, 8, 16, 18, 24, 29.
A Scorner seeks Wisdom, and finds it not; but Knowledge is easy unto him that
understands it. It is facile, it is obvious, it freely presents it self, it is
soon learnt, it is easily gettable, quickly attained. A Fool has not the lips
of Knowledge; go we from him, his foolishness is deceitful Sophistry, deceptory
fraud: But the Wisdom of the Acute is to understand his way of practical
business. Philosophical Folly has too long been made an Hereditary Possession,
one Generation to another; In^pt Opinions have been pertinaciously retained:
But the Wittily-ingenious, who take up with naked Truth in naked Souls; they
crown themselves with Knowledge, and they put a Crown upon Knowledge; Wisdom is
their rich and royal Ornament. Prove. 15. 2, 3, 7. 14, 33.
The tongue of the Wise makes knowledge good, grateful, commendate, renders it
amiable; adapting of it, and opportunely using it, to time, place, person and
case. Speech, when according to the Laws of the Heavenly Apothecary-Art,
saluti^erously compounded of proper Scripture Ingredients, is Healthfulness;
curing the unsoundness, the grief of mind: There is healing Medicine in such a
tongue. The lips of the Wise do sow Science; they winnow it first, sever it
from chaffy Philosophy, and then sow it pure. That is the true good Knowledge,
which the Wisdom of God does teach in the Word. Prove. 16. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
The best Intelligence is that which is grounded upon the Word: To this should
we attend and bend our mind, referring all our study hither; especially the
teachers of others; they, of all men, should 1 Timothy 4. 15.
be in these written Words: They are then in their proper Studies and Places;
it should be their Being and Life. This makes men wise in heart, it does
prudentiate and intellectuate them. The suavity, the sweetness of the lips will
add Doctrine, by a commodious aptness of savoury Expressions, and by a pleasing
elegancy of winning Eloquence; we should be Lords, Masters, Possessors of this.
The heart of savoury wise ones will make their mouth to understand; it will
suggest to the tongue, what, how, when, where, and to whom to speak. A more
inner understanding of a Truth or Thing, does much help the Faculty of Speech
about that Truth and Thing: New noble Conceits will still be under-begotten.
It expedites the lips, when the Rule of all is this Word. Prove. 17. 24, 27, 28.
Savoury knowledge may be seen and read in the faces of such prudent ones: It
puts a placidness, modesty, right-composedness, upon their Countenance, which
is an Index of their Wisdom. Such are Cool of Spirit, Moderate, placid, sedate;
not hot, and hasty, and rash, to pour out Words. Prove. 18. (...), 4, 15.
Those who have all their desire and delectation in this, to find out (in a way
of searching) all solid Science, and useful Wisdom, they withdraw themselves
from Philosophic and over-worldly Diversions, to immix themselves in those
Holy Studies that do bring in durable Essence. Their Understanding has depth of
living Waters, and their Vein is flowing over with it. Prove. 19. 2, 8, 20.
To be without the knowledge of the Soul, or for the Soul to be without
Knowledge; not good this. How can such an one govern his Actions, and order his
Affairs with judgment and discretion? That is Wisdom which will be found and
acknowledged to be Wisdom at the last, in thy last or utmost end. Cease we
therefore from erring and straying out of the way of those written words of
Wisdom. O prize we this! Prove. 20. 15.
for the lips of Wisdom are Gold, and a multitude of Gems, and a precious
Vessel. Vain affectation of Humane Wisdom is drossy, strawy, broken and earthy.
He Prove. 21. 16.
that wanders out of the Way of Understanding, from this prescript word of the
LORD, will in the end remain in the Cougregation of the incurably-dead. Prove.
22. 18, 19, 20, 21.
To keep the words of the Wise in the belly is sweetly delectable, they will be
aptly put together in the lips. Study Wisdom, that thou may trust in Aelohim;
he makes known Wisdom to thee, to this, for this end: They are his written
Words that do teach it. In the Scripture are those excellent Counsels, that do
tend to true and to sound Knowledge. The Counsels and Knowledges that are found
here, are the Justness or Rectitude of Truth, or certainty of the words of
Truth, every way true: It is the truth that is here learnt; To make to return
words of truth to those who send thee words truth, when others do send their
Questions, and propound their Cases to thee, for resolution and satisfaction.
Prove. 29. 1^, ^5, (...), ^9, 23.
We should make our heart and our ears to enter into Discipline, into the Words
of Knowledge. The seat of Wisdom is in the heart; when that does rejoice, to
see and to hear others to be wise, the whole man rejoices: The reins of a
Teacher do rejoice, when the lips of a Scholar do speak Rightnesses. When the
prescript word, and not our own or others carnal corrupt reason, is followed,
we shall make a blessed progress in holy Sciences. Here is truth which we
should acquire into our possession, the right knowledge of Naturals and
Spirituals, not parting with it upon any terms: That is Wisdom, Instruction and
Understanding, which is Scripture-Truth. Prove. 24. 5, 7, 43, 14, 26.
He, who is thus wise, is manly in strength: A man of Knowledge has fortifying
Prowess; It does increase his inner and outer vigor. These Word-wisdoms are
unreached heights, 100 sublime for and to an evil-fool; lofty excellencies,
which he cannot come at whilst such: But, to know these, is to the enlightened
Soul, as honey, or the distillings of the Honeycomb; sweet and nourishing,
(what natural causality honey may have this way, for the sharpning, quickening,
clearing of Ingeny, let others inquire:) If thou have found it, it shall be a
last reward. Prove. 25. 2, 11.
It would be the Glory of Kings to search out a Word, in all their warlick and
civil, as well as Religious transactions; to inquire after those treasured
senses of Scripture, which would direct them in this. It would teach all to
word their words over its circumstance or Modes, aptly, opportunely, as if it
moved aright upon Wheels. No answers but are Prove. 26. 16.
Scriptural, concordant thereunto, are sapid Counsel, or savoury Advice,
judicious Reason, returned to inquirers. Prove. 28. 5, 16, 26.
Those who in this way do seek Jehovah, shall understand all, whatsoever it be
that does belong to their Office and Duty. A Prince, a Leader, in State or
Church, or Field of all men, should not want understanding in Scripture
Sciences, in word acts. He should be well skilled in all sorts of useful
Learning; otherwise their imprudent misgovernment will put them upon oppressing
and misguiding their people. Prove. 29. 3.
O love we this Wisdom, and this way of Wisdom! Prove. 30. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
The Primitive Understanding of Adam, which he had concreated with him, is not
now to us; we are corruptly brutish, as to the answering of difficult
Questions; it is only to be had from Christ in the Word, who is able and
willing, He the God-man. For the knowledge of holy Ones, Angelical heavenly
Ones, is not so with us now, not so born and bred with us of our own, but is a
gift from him who is all Wisdom.

Reads, let thine eyes therefore, be now up to him, that thou may be one of
the John 6. 4. out of Isai. 54. 13. and Jer. (...). 34.
God-taught Ones; that thy knowledge may, even whilst thou art here on Earth,
more grow up to answer the knowledge of those glorified in Heaven. 1 Cor. 13.
(...) 12.
Thy knowledge should be perfecting, as theirs perfected! O for that blessed
day, when all the imperfections in a Believers knowledge shall be wholly done
away! When it shall be more presentially visible in the innate Light, both of
the Knower, and of the things known; When the Saints shall see face to face,
and know even also as they are known!

FINIS.
