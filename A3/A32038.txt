(...) Whereupon, We being very sensible of this extreme dishonor to Us, That
a Town of such importance, and so near to the place of Our present Residence,
should be thus fortified, kept, and maintained against Us, That the Port and
Passage by Sea should be defended against Us by Our own Ships, under the
conduct of the Earl of Warwick, who being legally discharged by Us of his
employment at Sea, by Our Revocation of the Commission formerly granted by Us
to the Earl of Northumberland, and by Our Command signified unto him under Our
own hand, to deliver the commmand of Our Ships into the hands of another person
named by Us, has, notwithstanding Our said Commands (to which the Earl of
Northumberland paid a dutiful obedience) presumed not only to dispossess Us
of Our said Navy, but to employ it against Us, and to take Prisoners such of
Our Captains as expressed a loyalty to Us according to their Oaths, and the
duty of Subjects; And that a Ship of Ours lately employed for Our particular
service into Holland, and returning from thence with some of Our proper Goods,
has been chased by them as an Enemy, and enforced, for her safety, to put
into a small Creek within six Miles of that Town, and there to run on ground,
to the great hazard of Our said Vessel; and that both Our Ship and Goods there
were yet remaining in danger to be surprised by Our own Subjects, We took a
Journey on Wednesday the sixth of this Month from York toward the said Creek,
to take a view of Our said Ship and Goods thus exposed to danger; We having
just cause to fear that Sir John Hotham, and others of his Confederacy, would
(for Our good, and the good of the Kingdom) make prize of these also; and by
the opportunity of that journey, We Our Selves are now fully informed of the
certainty of those things, which We had before received but from the relation
of others; and there received a lamentable Petition of Our Subjects of those
parts, complaining of the unheard of Insolence and Barbarism of Sir John
Hotham, and desiring Our just and necessary protection of them from those
cruel Oppressions.

Upon all which considerations, that We may at length, after this long
patience, do that right to Our Honor, Our Crown, and Royal Dignity, and to
Our good Subjects in general, and those of and near to Our Town of Hull in
particular, which We had reason to have expected from Our two Houses of
Parliament; but have failed of the fruit of Our long expectation, by the malice
of some ill-affected spirits amongst them, who study nothing more then by
false pretenses to amuse and abuse Our good people, We have taken this
Resolution, by Gods blessing, and the Assistance of Our good Subjects, to force
Sir John Hotham and all that shall take part with him in the unjust and
treasonable defense of the Town of Hull against Us, to that obedience which is
due by Subjects to their Liege Lord and Sovereign, and to resist the Assistance
intended to Sir John Hotham from Our said County of Lincoln and other places
adjoining, if they shall attempt it. And to this purpose We will and require
all Our loving Subjects to yield their best assistance of what kind soever, to
so necessary a defense of Our Person, and just vindication of so great an
injury offered unto Us, to the dishonor of this Nation. And We do declare,
That whosoever shall give Us their cheerful help at this time, and to this
purpose, either with Men, Horse, Arms, or Money, to be brought, sent, or
conveyed unto Us, We shall look upon it as a Service never to be forgotten.

And this We publish to all Our Subjects, and to all the World, that they may
truly understand the clearing of Our Intentions herein, as We shall do in all
other things concerning our Government; And that We do and ever shall maintain
those Resolutions We have professed so often, and so seriously by Our former
Declarations; That We will continue and defend the true Protestant Religion as
it is by Law established in the Church of England, the Laws of the Land, the
Rights and just Liberties of Our Subjects, equally to and with Our own just
Prerogative, and the true Privileges of Parliament, and never infringe any Act
consented to by Us this Parliament: And that We have not, nor ever had the
least thought of making war upon Our two Houses of Parliament, as has been
slanderously and maliciously published. And these things, not Our Words only,
but all Our Actions shall make good. And in this Resolution and the just
Observation thereof We shall both live and dye.

Given at Our Court at Beverley the eighth day of July, in the eighteenth year
of Our Reign. 1642.
Imprinted at York by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.
