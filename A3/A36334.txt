NEVVES From the Narrovv Seas, Being a certain Relation of a mighty and
fearful fight in those Seas, upon the Coast of Frizeland, Between a Navy of
Danes of a hundred Sail, under the Command of the Grave van Erfurt, the Danish
Admiral, and mine Here van Trump, Admiral to the States of the united
PROVINCES.

Wherein the said Van Trump obtained a glorious victory by the utter overthrow
of the Danish Navy, which was (as is probably supposed) intended for England to
assist His Majesty against the Parliament.

The Battle happening on Tuesday last, the first of November, old style.

The Relation of it was sent over from Amsterdam in a Letter by a Merchant of
good quality to a Gentleman in this City, and by him published.

LONDON, Printed for Francis Wright. 1642,

Worthy Sir,
ACcording to the mutual correspondence long time held between us,
understanding by your last express of the 20. of October, the old style of the
affairs of England, I found my self engaged to make you a retribution by
acquainting you with the last passages here; I believe it is not unknown to
you that there has been open hostility between the King of Denmark and the
State, which yet continuing in full heat and violence; all the discourse for
some weeks past here, has been of a strange and new appointed Navy, which the
said King has been all this last Summer a rigging in all the considerable
ports of the balticke, for what end we certainly could not understand; the best
intelligence from thence, giving information, that it was bound for England,
procured hither by the solicitation of the malignant party there to assist his
Majesty against the Parliament, others affirming, and probably, enough, that it
was to infest the Netherlandish Coasts and to make some attempts upon Hilford
sluice, the Brill, or some other part of Zeland, being assisted by another fleet
of our old and implacable enemies, the Dunkirks, whithersoever it was bound, or
for what purpose raised, I can not determine, but certain it is, that about
Saint Lukes tide last, according to the English account, there arrived out of
the same into Copenhagen, near an hundred able ships, part Lubeckers, part
stoud Merchants, and the rest Danes, which taking in there some twelve or
fourteen thousand landsouldiers, besides abundance of ammunition, even to
supefluity; under the command of the Duke of Holstein; and then joined with the
grave Van Erfurt a Germane, the Admiral of Denmark and his fleet of twenty
ships; they put to sea that week, keeping along the coast, the State here
having daily avisoes from sea of their proceedings, and by their consant and
continual wrestling with military dangers, inured to a care of their safeties,
they sent an express to that famous Van Trump their Admiral (being with his
fleet of threescore sail of good and valiant ships not far from the coast
Zeland) to intimate the approaching of the Danish Armado, charging him to wait
diligently on those unwelcome guests, and so to watch their movings; that if he
saw occasion, he might bid them to a bloody entertainment; for whatsoever were
their pretentons, or whithersoever they were bound. It was cause and quarrel
enough to give him battle, being professed enemies to that State. Van Trump
having received that charge quickly hoys'd his sails, and with a cheerful and
pleasant gale of wind, did run along the coasts of Zeland, Holland and
F^^zl^nd, being as far as the States clame any jurisdiction in those seas,
without having any notice of this talk'd-of navy, till the eve before the
battle, which was on Monday the last of October Old style he had notice by a
light Catch, that scouted out to sea ward, that there was a mighty and
stupendous fleet to the number of at least sixscore bottomes, bearing to
sea-ward from the coast of Humburg, and that in all probability, if he would
make out to sea, he might encounter them ere morning; Ven Trump exceedingly
joyful at this tiding unamaz'd at the number of their fleet, made toward them,
by the directions of that Catch, but the wind at evening being something scant,
and not sufficient to trim the sails of his greater ships, his Admiral and
some other of his fleet, being vessels of twelve hundred and a thousand tun
was forced to laver about, till in the night the wind coming about, and
blowing a stiff gale in his stern, he spoond before the waves, and by that it
was clear day light, ours had a view of the Danish Armado, who failed on, as
if they had notice, intended to fall over for the North coast of England, then
to trouble the Coast of Holland. But on the descriall of our fleet, without
delay they prepared for fight, their admiral Erfurt dividing his navy into
three squadrons, two wings himself in the middle with his musters Royal ships,
making as it were the body of his battle. Van Trumpe came on almost in the
self same form, only his wings keep closer to the maine of his Armado, and
so with fearful shouts on both sides, the Danes as is their custom, drinking
large carrowces to make them more courageous, they sent loud messages of death
to each other, by those fatal imbassadors, their great Ordnance, the
Constables of our ships being far more experienced markesmen than the Danish
gunners, none of those fire-bals were sent in reign, but went either through
and through the sides of their vessels, or light upon their masts, splitting
them, and shearing asunder their tacklings, our light and nimble ships turning
dexterously about, saluteng them with two broad sides and sinking some six of
the right wing, the rest shockt up to their Admiral. Who was not unmindfull
neither of his honor, nor to invade our navy, upon which he sent out not in
vain, his great Artillery, which seemed to change the sea into a flame, at
last finding our Ordnance from our vice admiral Hans Hiem the son of that
Peer Hiem that took in 29 the Spanish plate-fleete in the James. to gall him
shrowdly twixt his decks, trusting to the multitude of his men, they being now
within half musket shot he ran his sword with much violence upon his stern,
and grapling after a turn or two, his ship to that of Hans Hiem, he laid him
abord with some kindred of his resolutest Soldiers. When suddenly the
murderers from the great Cabbine going off, and fire being given to the train
under the false Decks, up flew those Danes into the air dismembered, and others
by the Admiral being clapped on in their rooms, were with the Murderers from
the Cooke-roome straight cleared the Decks, and sent those Danes to drink an
everlasting health with their companions. The Admiral perceiving that there
was likelihood of taking that strait ship, deserted her, and took about to the
aid of his right wing, which under the command of the Duke of Holstein was
undertaken by Van Trump himself, who like a right Neptune, as if he only would
be Lord of those waters, bestirs himself among the Danes, pouring into their
bosoms showers of lead like hailestones, and throwing over pots of wild fire
and hard Granado's into their quarters and tacklings. You might have in an
instant seen as it were a fiery contention for priority between those two
opposite Elements, fire and water, the burning ships, as it were striving to
set fire upon the rooms: Which in scorn to be vanquished in their proper
dwellings, as the vessels should have suffered a double death, insinuated into
their holds, and sinking them extinguished the audacious flames; the same ships
at one instant (strange yet true) being burned and drowned, Van Trumpe boarding
the Duke of Holstein, was twice repulsed, rather by multitude then valor;
those Bacon-eating Danes wishing themselves at home again carowsing strong
waters; On the sudden, were sent to their long home, where they had plenty of
liquor; destiny seeming to be courteous to them in affourding them plenty of
that in their deaths which they had so doted on in their lives. Hans Hiem with
the Rere-Admirall and his squadron, in the interim falling in upon Erfurts left
wing, which consisted of Lubecke mariners, they instantly cried out for
quarter, yielding themselves without striking one stroke, with their sluggish
ships, to the number of six and thirty, a large thirst of the Fleet; with which
cowardly treachery of theirs, Erfurt amazed and discouraged would have provided
for his safety by fight; but he was as well surrounded with enemies as waves,
and therefore impossibilitated of his purpose, like a valiant soldier resolves
to fight it out, and set his life at as dear rate as possible, rather, then
betray the trust reposed in him by his King, by betraying the ships Royal into
the hands of his enemies, cheerfully therefore and suddenly he made upon Van
Trump charging his Ordnance great and small; you might have seen there all the
horrors incident to mortality, men leaping there from one to another, death,
fire, water, and sword, and all the Elements and Engines of destruction
contriving their ruin. At last, by the singular skill and directions of Van
Trump, and the valor of Hiem and others, most of the Fleet that before
threatened the Seas was sunk or taken. The Duke of Holstein seeing us go to
wrack, as Hiem informed, being in a good and strong ship, valiantly cut his
passage through our Fleet, and escaped old Erfurt, after he and his soldiers
had showed as much valor as ever was expressed, that Nation beholding his ship
boarded, on all sides ready to be taken, and himself led into captivity, more
desperately then Christianly getting down into the Gun-roome, gave fire to
those vessels of powder which were there; he blew himself, soldiers and
enemies that were then aboard, with his ship into pieces; that old Commander
like Ajax, disdaining that any should conquer him but himself; after which the
rest of the ships crying out for quarter, were received into the possession of
Van Trump, who now had a competent victory. Of all that great fleet not one
escaped that I can hear of but the Duke of Holstein, there being thirty six
sunk and torn a pieces in the fight, and some sixty taken and made prize of,
we having not lost above three ships, and those not very considerable, and not
above three hundred men, they four thousand, there being of mariners and
soldiers between six and seven thousand prisoners. This is the true Relation
of that great and fearful battle, then which has not been fought a more
considerable one to this State. The King of Denmark by this means being
deprived of all his maritime forces; and if they were intended for England,
they were happily diverted thence: Where Sir I wish you a sudden and happy
tranquillity, and rest,

Your humble servant, and true Friend, Em. D.
Amsterdam this present Wednsday, the 11. of November. stylo novo. I could have
written you other Occurrences, but the Post being ready to go aboard, I had
enough to do to noticifie this to you, which is a certain truth. Farewell.



FINIS.
