A COLLECTION OF Several POEMS and VERSES, etc.
An ADITION to the Lines of Hollow my Fancy; Written by him the last Year he
was at the College, not then fully 18 ^ears of Age.
IN conceit like Phaeton I`ll mount Phoebus Chair;
Having ne`re a Hat on,
All my Hair`s a burning,
In my journeying, Hurrying through the Air,
Fain would I hear his fiery Horses neighing;
And see how they on foamy Bitts are playing;
All the Stars and Planets I will be surveying;
Hollow my F^ncie, whither will thou go?
O from what ground of Nature* Does the Pelican,
That self devouring creature,
Prove so froward,
And untoward, Her Vitals for to restrain!
And why the subtle Fox, while in death* wounds is lying*
Does not lament his pangs, by howling and by crying*
And why the milk white Swan does sing when she is a dying
Hollow my Fancy, whither will (...)?
Fain would I conclude this, at least make an Essay,
What fimilitude is,
Why Fowls of a feather,
Do ^ock* and fly together, and Lamb^ know Beasts of prey;
How Natutes Alcbymists, these small labor^ ous creature^
Acknowledge still a Prince in ordering their matter^
And suffers none to live, who slothing los^ their Feature^
Hollow m^ Fancy, whither wili thou go?
I Am rapt with admiration, when I do ruminate,
Men of one Occupation,
How each one calls him brother,
Yet each invieth other and yet still intimate;
Yea I admire to ^ee, some Natives farther sundred
Then A^ipodes to us, is it not to be wondered
In Myriads ye'll find of one mind scarce a^ hundred Hollow, etc.
What multitude of Notions,* does perturb my Pate,
Considering the motions,
How Heavens they are preserved,*
And this World served, in Moisture, Light, and Heat:
^f one Spirit sits the outmost ^ircle turning,*
Or if one turns another, continuing in journeying,
^f Rapids circles motion, be that which they call burning;
Hollow my Faneie, whither wilt tho^ go?
Fain also would I prove this, by considering,
What that which you call Love is,
Whither it be a Folly,
Or a Melancho^y, ot some Heroic thing:
^in would I have it proved, by one whom Love has wounded,
and fully upon one, their desire has founded,
that nothing else could please them, tho the World were rounded*
Hollow m^ Fancy, whither will thou go?
To know this Worlds Center, Height, Depth, Breadth, and Length,
Fain would I adventure,
To search the hid Attractions,
Of Magnetic actions, and Adamantick strength:
Fainwould I know if in some losty Mountain*
Where the Moon sojourns, if there be Trees or Fountain,
If there be Beasts of prey, or yet fields to hunt in,
Hollow m^ Fan^ie, whither will thou go?
Fain would I have it tried, by Experiments,
By none can be denied,
If in this bulk of Nature,*
There be voids Ie^s or greater* or all remains complete:
Fain would I know if Beasts have any Reason*
If Falcons killing Eagles, do commit ^ Treason
If fear of Winters want, makes Swallows fly the Season Hollow, etc.
Hollow my Fancy, hollow, stay thou at home with me,*
I can thee no longer follow,
Thou have betray`d me.
And bew^ay`d me, it is too much for thee:
S^ay, s^ay at home with me, leave off the lofty soaring
Stay thou at home with me, and on the Bo^ks be po^ing
For he that goes Ab^oad, lays little up in storing
Tho^`s welcom^ home my Fancy, welcome ho^ to (...)
FINIS.
A Mock POEM, Upon the EXPEDITION Of the Highland-host:
Who came to destroy the Western Shires, in Winter 1678.
WHen Saturn shakes his ^rostie feathers;
When Russia Garments are rough leathers;
When Dutch Dames over Stoves do chatter;
When M^n drv-shoo`d traver^e the water:
When Popish parti^ invocats,
Both Saints, and Angels, when their pa^s,
While they want Weights of Air and Earth,
May be repa^'d with water's birth:
E`re Trouts begin to move their finnes,
While Fan^s give place to black dog skines;
Which at that time as some supposes,
Are fittest far for Ladies noses.
Which tho their natural Sent be brusk,
They`re help^ with Ca^s dirt, and with Musk:
Because that S^s (...) endeavors,
To take their Marks from evil hours.
It was not long from tha^ ^ime, when
The ch^fe and tossed Western*men,
Were dissipat at Pictland fells,
By Devils, Drummonds, and D^lzells.
When Veals for Rari^ies are sold,
And when young Ladies* catche^h cold*
This season sure works strange Effects,
Upon their naked breasts and necks.
But pardon me, it is ill breeding,
To touch the Modes of Ladies Cleeding,*
Hence I`ll not do the like again,
Tho they wear nothing but their skin.
Comets raign`d above the City,
Preachers prison`d without pity;
Some knu^ up ^or wearing Gunes,
Wine was dru^ken out in Tunes.
Next with blasphemic and rude speeches,
New coin`d scutvies vex the Leidges.
Ladies Heckl'd, and Lords Horn`d,
Some for lending Money scorn`d:
Men fin`d for preventing murders,
Princes owning Bishops Orders:
Curats ^wearing by their Gowns,
Old Fren^h Taylours ruling Towns.
Tho it be so, ye need think ^ought o^`t,
They best deserv`d, who dearest ^ought it*
Self Defenders termed Rebels,
Proclamations, grievous Libels*
Majors turning Hang men's mates,
Sentries watching (...) gares.
Lawyers words, their Writs bewraying,
Councils Acts, their Oaths betraying*
Bo^ds imposed, prisons mended,
Men suspect who nev`r offended.
London Letters all revolving,
Placuit each Querie solving.
Councils Acts amounting to,
What ever Parliaments could do.*
Lords and Soldiers Sundays work,
To robb the people of the Ark*
Commons chas`d from Pleughs and Harrow^,
Gentry charged with Laborrows;
While none appears for to swear,
That they their goods or bodies ^ear.
Yet the Gentry must enact them,
Or else they will horn them, and then take them.
Plundering and Desolations,
Men imprisoned for Relations;
Horse in hazard of Thieves holls,
Because they were not learn`d when Foals,
To answer, and to tell whose aught them,
It. seems they wanted Art who taught them.
Gentlemen o^ Good Account.
Might not think it an affront,
To sit with Lousie Rogues together,
Yea stand and serve their Foot-mens Brother,
New made Earls, and some that
Are judged, nihil signifi^at,
With a pack of Redshank-Squires;
Eating up the Western-shires,
Plundering without restraint
Even persons known for innocent;
Stews and Masses nothing checked,
Naught but (...) rebuked;
Women of their shame bereaft,
It Is feared a Highland brood be left,
Who afterward may starve for want,
While thus they make the Victual scant;
Clergies Acts, and Cannon Law,
Put on carts for horse to draw*
Cables towes, Ligure chists,
Manackles for thumbs and fists,
Powder, Lead, Spads, and Shovels,
To cover the dead with turffes and muiles*
And to cast up some sheughs and Ditches,
Steel capes, Armor and Buff Breetches;
Cords for wreaking peoples throats
Germans for contriving plots.
Durks to stop in Muskets end,
Pray, What may all this portend?
With all such other Provinent,
As was to Greece by Xerxes sent.
And if ye please all such provision*
A^ was for Godf^ey s Expedition:
But here my fancie`s at a stance,
Are we^to have a War with France ^
Yet I`m inclined to relate,
What things concerning Church and Sta^e*
Was gravely by the Squire narrate,
Before the Host when they were met.
What was the cause o^ such conventions?
What was their aim and their intentions?
What was that grievous Proclamation,
That did affront the King and Nation?
We need not stay to tell the place,
Where they were charg`d to met his Grace:
Because their slight was from the North,
It was near to the River Forth.
I must commend their Trust and Faith,
For in an instant, as some says:
They met together all misguided,
With Drift, and Rain, tossed blash and blyned.
But to discrive them Right surpasses,
The Art of nine Parnassus Lasses;
Or ^ucan, Virgil, or of Hora^
Of Ovid, Homer, or of Flor^s,
Yea sure such sights might have inclined,
A Man to nau^eat at Mankind;
Some might have judged they were the creatures*
Call`d Selfies, whole customs and featu^es,
Paracelsus do^th discry,
In his Ocult Philosophy,
Or Faunes, or Brownies, if ye will,
Or Satvres, come from Atlas Hill
Or that the three tongu`d Tyke wa^ sleeping,
Who has the Stygian Door a keeping:
Their head, their neck, their legs and thighs,
A^e influenced by the Skies.
Without a clout to interrupt them,
They need not strip the^ when they whip them;
Nor loose their Doublet, when they are hang`d,
If they be miss`d, it`s sure they`re wronged,
This keep their bodies from corruptions,
From fistuls, tumors and eruptions;
Unless they come to Towns perhaps,
They must not miss their bit^ of claps.
They are so gent, they will not want it,
The Men who knows them best will grant it.
Their Durks hang down between their legs,
Where they made many slopes and geggs;
By rubbing on their naked side,
And wambling from side to side.
But those who were their chief Commanders,
As such who bore the pirnie Standarts;
Who led the Van, and drove the Rear:
Were right well mounted of their Gear:
With Brogues, Trues, and pirnie Plaides,
With good blew Bonnets on their Heads:
Which on the one side had a flipe,
Adorned with a Tobacco pipe.
With Durk, and Snap-work, and Snuff-mill,
A bagg which they with Onions fill,
And as their strick Observers say,
A T^pe Horn fill`d with Usquebay.
A flasht out Coat beneath her plaides,
A Targe of timber, nails and hides;
With a long two handed Sword,
As good's the Country can afford
Had they not need of bulk and bones,
Who fights with all these Arms at once,
It`s marvelous how in such weather,
Ov`r hill and hop they came together,
How in such storms they came so far,
The reason is, they are smeat`d with Tar.
Which does defend them heel and neck,
Just as it does their Sheep protect;
But least ye doubt that this is true,
They`re just the color of tar`d Wool:
Naught like Religion they retain,
Of moral Honesty they`re clean.
In nothing they`re accounted sharp,
Except in Bag-pipe, and in Harp.
For a milobliging word,
She`ll durk her neighbor ov`r the board.
And then she will flee like fire from flint.
She Will scarcely ward the second dint;
If any ask her of her thrift,
Foresooth her nain sell lives by thife.
When this thrice savage Crew was met,
And in their Ranks and Order set;
Then straight before them came the Squire,
Like to Aeneas in attire.
And in his hand he had a Lance,
Which some said he had used in France,
Some said he learn`d his warlike Fates,
With Grand Signleor beside the Straights.
Some in Russia, some in Polland,
Some in Flanders, some in Holland;
Some in Denmark, some in Spain,
Some with Gustavus of Swedden.
When with Scots Lads he did daunt,
Each Prince that did about him Vaunt,
But others, who were better read,
Said he storm`d Cities in his bed:
He walked in State, tho somewhat wide,
Ye know what makes some Gallants stride.
He stood upright, tho shoulders slopt,
Tho brans and legs krain'd and clop^,
Tho bumm and belly were best boulked.
They all admir`d who on him looked.
But here I scruple to rehearse,
Or put that blank into my Verse;
Which in his throat some old wound makes,
Occasioned by some mistakes:
When in his Lodging he did bide,
It`s said he call`d one often a side.
To ask of beatten Buttons prices,
Of Silver work or strange divises:
Tho she be some what old and teugh,
She`s a Scots Woman hough enough;
If of his Counteance ye ask,
It would be a difficult task,
For a Phisog^anist to tell,
Which of three does most excel;
Bacbus, Venus, Mars, to wit,
Foresooth it were a kittle put:
But some there are, who think it be,
A just Commixion of the three.
Others who know his old projections,
Says wars is least in his affections;
While with such Grace and State he stood,
All the bulk of Highland Brood,
Admir`d their chance and their mishap,
When that he did not lift his Cape,
While he was speaking to the Lord,
Had it not been for the Lifeguard,
She would have durkt him, when she saw,
He kept so the Lord in aw:
The whole Crew stair`d him in the face,
Some asked if it was his Grace;
And other some who knew nothing.
Did ask if he could be Sir King;
On every hand they did enquire,
Till they were told it was the Squire.
He was afflicted with a cough,
Which vexed him right sore, although
He crub`d it as much as he could,
And got good Syrups when he would;
Yet it brake out with such a force,
As mar`d the Ranks o^ Highland horse;
When he had cought and cleans`d his throat
And from his mouth the phlegm had put,
He paus`d a little, then he spoke,
And then drew forth the Councils Act:
Which is not safe for to insert,
It`s known whose pockets made him smart*
E`re to his ^eading he began,
He cry`d keep quiet every man,
Because they did not understand,
He hosted and lift up his hand,
And made signs they might hold still,
Till he declar`d his Graces will;
For all the pains that he had taken,
Yet instantly he was mistaken,
For these ignoramus fellows,
Thought he desir`d to hear their bollows;
With one consent they raised a cry:
Which echoed: from Sky to Sky,
That so the Clouds did (...) and (...),
Then presently ^ell snow land drift:
The Squire this dumped stood amused,
And glour`d as if he were confused,
While they redoubled their cries,
While hai^ and snow did blind his eyes,
His wounded neck was nipt with froast,
He looked like some wight or ghoast:
Some thought that he might have expired,
Had it not been they partly tired:
And partly stoped when rebuked,
By her ^ain Lord, yea some were knocked.
The Squire (...), gapt, and drew his breath,
Like a Game Cock, then cursing, says,
I wish I never may do good,
If I do like this Highland Brood.
When all their tumults were appeased,
The Squire himself was somewhat eased:
He read the Order, Act, and Bond,
Tho much difficulty he found,
His Judgment being somewhat Jumbl`d,
His brains with shouts and yelloughs tumbled:
He rested till he was composed,
Till brains, tongue, breath, were well disposed;
In Oratrie to show his Worth,
Like Catilina or Jugurth:
When he had rested to content,
He ros^ and gave a complement,
But short as Soldiers use to do,
And then brevi manu he falls too;
And says, it`s like ye`ll ask the cause
Which at this time together draws:
Such multitudes in Winter frosts,
An unfit time to levy hosts;
Might this not all have been foreborn,
Till y^ had till`d and sawen your Corn:
Then would ye come in Troops, and Fleets,
^ike Tartars or like Moscovites;
And done whatever he had pleased,
Attila`s title would received:
Tho I might all these knots un loose,
With it`s thought fill, and so to close,
^et I will all you^ doubts disjoint,
and answer unto every point.
It`s known what mischief in times past,
^ Southern shires, and in the West:
What to Haugh-head and hill-side fleetings,
Rebellious and seditious meetings.
Which by the Council is declared,
By wholesome Laws, and well prepared,
To be Seditions sole foundation
And this is all their Occupation:
They rail the Clergy and the State,
And hurts their Fame at a strange rate,
They say it`s Alamode the Year,
For Noblemen the Horns to wear.
And that the most part are too ready*
To wait upon their Neighbors Lady,
They rail on Courtly Lady`s carriage
As if they did not honor Marriage:
Since they are turn`d so highly rude,
It`s known to whom they do allude,
As if that Word were not* within,
The compass of their Bible`s skin;
There should not be an evil speaker,
Of peoples Prince, but what the Mecke^,
Are they of that, they never heedlit,
As if they never heard nor read it:
They say we`r murderers of the Saints*
Court Parasites, gross Sycophants;
That Prelates are related, sure,
Unto the Babylonish Whore;
Yea they`r alleging that his Grace,
Must to his Ladies wit give place;
Then this will follow, I suppose,
She drags the whole ware by the Nose.
It`s frequently among them told,
That Lawyers Rules, are Leidges Gold:
And for a Proof, they cite a Process,
Of Melvil with the Earl of Rothess:
And of his Grace, with the Earl of Twidsdale,
And some of lat^, with Will of Clidsdale.
Tho now he`s hectored by ilk,
Even from his Grace, to Castle milk;
And that`s but Just, for he before,
Catch`d his own Friends in that same bore:
^`s known he would have interdited,
But he was sorc`d with shame to quite it:
Now he`s rewarded for such pranks,
When he would pass, it`s told he Janks:
^or information they prevail,
With those who made the last appeal;
^hey have contriv`d rebellious Books:
those paper well might serve the Cooks,
^o sing their Poultrie I dare swear,
(...) thousand or three hundred Year:
^s Napthali, of much reputed,
^y Hangman, that was refuted:
^hink his ^yre he had deserved,
^he his Answerer had served;
(...) the same rate he serv`d the first,
^e sham`d us all, he never durst:
^d Apologetick Relation,
^d Gilbert Burnet`s Refuration,
which he durst never yet red argue,
(...)found it easier to argue
With Ladies, and I^ll tell you too,
He has some other thing to do;
For he has left Pindarick Rhyme,
In writing Me^oirs, spends his time.
Damascus Altar, and Lex Rex,
And thousands more the people vex,
Got from Buchannan, now he`s gone,
Let Papists curse him, for I`m none;
I never so could love their ways,
As keeps Lent`s Nights* far less its Days.
To answer all their Books we tired,
We intercommun`d them* and fired;
Yet I`m afraid for all our pains,
That their Seditious Seed remains,
With other Pamphlets stuff d with Lies,
Like Mitchels Ghosts and Tragedies,
And Answers to Oyas Covenanters,
Where they like Witches and Inchanters,
Even things to come presume to tell,
And places chief Rulers in Hell;
Tormenting Beelzebub with fear,
Least some of them usurp his chair:
And other some pervert his laws,
And Arbitrarly judge each cause:
Yet I am fixed in Opinion,
He`s absolute in his Dominion;
Neither will he yield his place,
When both comes there that`s term`d his Gr^
Now to ^uch meetings runs in flocks,
Men with Hats, Swords and Cloacks:
Yea, some with great Cocks on their Hats,
Pearl`d Sleeves, and Laced Gravats,
Behaving well in every Gesture,
Nea^ in Ridding Gear and Vesture.
If they imagine ought to do,
They`ll have their Hulster Pistols to.
Ye are informed what a sture,
Innes got at Lilsly Mure;
And Sharps Lifeguard, how they in Fife,
Were in the hazard of their Life;
Where all the Guard did flee or smart,
By of their Number a third part:
Yea, surely they might been devouted,
Had it not been they were secured,
By such a Man as Master Bruce,
Who yet for fear did keep his house:
Tho Silver Plate, Sharps Guard did plunder,
With Horse and Clothes, I think no wonder,
For a pack of Tinkler Fellows,
Will steal tho they should get the Gallows.
And at their Meetings as some say,
They Are still in Arms in Galloway:
And now with Hume, tho he be wicked,
They bell the Cat, and him have tricked:
There ye may see as hansome Men,
As I when dressed by her ye kenn;
Tho Men should come in such a case,
(...) would not valu`d a Traes Ace.
But wives with clubs and cudgels, save us,
(...) would affright an Old Gustavus:
They give Communions and Baptizes,
And convocats with their surmises,
The Leidges without Law and Order;
They haunt the Inland and the Border:
Yea, they`l perform a private Marriage,
Who would connive at such a Carriage?
But their last words did raise his passion,
He hoasted, as it was his fashion,
He coaghed neat to Expiration,
As he had got the last Citation
From grim Death, the king of Terrors;
He griev`d when he thought on their errou^s.
He made signs for his Ligure Coat,
And Balsome to anoint his Thcoat;
For some good Drink to wash his Mouth,
For he was like to choke for drowth:
He got of Beer a full bowl Glass,
Which got bad Passage at his Hasse*
His Throat was so to excess dry*
It spung`d it up e`re it got by:
He got the other drink, and says,
Have at ye yet if I had Breath.
When that his Heart and Wind-pipes settles,
He rose as he had sit on Nettles:
He hasted to tell out the rest o`t,
To handl'^ hotly is the best o`t.
He had his passion overcome,
And gave a great silentium,
Placing his hands on both his haunches,
Gave in his Speech in several branches.
And says, I would be well content,
Because there`s some that's ignorant
To tell ye of supreme (...),
From which flows honor and preferment:
On which our properties are founded,
Our Laws and Liberties are grounded,
As sole power for decyding Questions,
And putting stops to hot Contestions;
But since it is a sacred thing,
Not to speak rashly of a King.
I Will tell ye when and where ye`le get it,
Scholastickly and learn'dly treated;
In the Trone Kirk when Annan prays
On Sabbaths, and on Holy days,
If I mistake not, he ne`re misses
When the Kings Majesty he blesses;
What power how absolute and great,
The King has over Church and State*
Yet Presbyterians never stands,
To violate the Kings Commands,
Yea just as if they could defy him,
His due Allegiance they deny him;
His Grace who is so much concerned,
To see the Kingdom right governed;
To see each thing in order put,
Each Law and Statute execute,
To see that Schismatics be checked,
Least the True Clergy be neglected;
His Grace I say will never sit
With such Affronts, he`l ne`re permit;
That such irregular Practisers,
Should pass without some Catechisers.
It nicks him hearer than his Life,
Yea, nor his Conscence, or his Wife:
I you assure he cannot bide it,
He`l either end it, or decide it:
Since to such Arrogance they`r mounted*
He will not see the King afsronted:
Yea, tho his Grace should endeavor,
The patience of the Lord Strathmore,
Who if he had been in such a ^ash, as
If he had been so das^ly rash, as
He, who gave him the p^ovocation,
Even for thy Heart, or thy Foundation,
Thou da^e no^ offer to rescent it,
Blood and Wounds might made`s tepent it:
Tho in patience he exceed
Socra^es, and all we read:
If the King's Credit be at stake,
Some Course ^sfectual he must take.
It`s like ye`ll say, there`s something lurking,
That there`s some other thing a working:
Some Powder p^t, or strange Contriving,
Within his Grace`s Brains is hiving:
But I declare, I know nothing.
Of his I^ention or Design*
Whatever some may vainly boast,
They know what mov`d to call this Host:
Yet does his Grace it so conceal,
That he`ll to no Man it reveal:
He keep`st so closs I cannot show it,
He will not let the Angels know it,
Yet I imagine, I may say it,
Tho I tell you, ye`ll keep it quiet.
His Grace`s Courtship is more pusl'd,
Than Regal Credit`s mar`d or mus^'d.
If he had granted Liberty,
As was propos`d to Presbytrie,
The Clergies conjunct might have foil`d him,
And as it was, almost ^urncoyl`d him:
E`re of his Interest ought he ^ine,
He`ll try the most severe design;
He will not plainly tell what led him,
Says dev`l be in the breast it bred in;
His Grace knows Presbytrie as well,
As Bes^ie does the Privy Seal:
He knows well how to loose their knots,
For he was once on all their Plots,
By Vows and Bonds was tied to them,
He knew the better to undo them:
And if ye think this cannot true be,
The Truth thereof I can let you see;
It is no Fancy, nor no Fable,
He was concern`d at the Green-table;
Which I can grove, if that I need it,
^n Burnet`s new penn`d Race ye`ll read it.
Now I have showen some Cause and Reason,
That we are here, it`s suspect Treason;
For all the ^relats, as we hear,
Are in such a panick fear,
They know not how, nor where to creep to,
They must be guarded when they sleep too:
The wiser men I do repute them,
For their own Gu^ns are like to shoot them;
Its hard to bide the hard reproaches,
That some of them gets from their Coaches.
As for the harshness of the Season,
I can give a sufficient Reason,
For these who`s duk't over Lug and Horn,
In snow or Dubbs as soon as born;
More boasterous Weather may endure,
Than might their Horse and Nolt devout:
This Season strongest Storms still yields,
They Will not have power to keep the Fields:
So we shall catch them by the Neck,
If they`l not bow, we will cause them break:
As for your labor neyer regard. it,
For ye to full shall be rewarded:
Ye`le get more booty by your Durking,
Than might surpais full two years working,
For there are routh of Geese and Hens,
As fat as ever flew on pens;
Turkies, Sheep, Nolt and Horse,
If ye be hindered take by force,
Clothes o^ Linning, Wolling, Silk,
Butter Cheese, Bread and Milk,
Beer and Ale, and good salt Beef,
And all that may engadge a Thief:
Armor, Money, and some Gold;
We shall them raze from house and hold:
There Is something yet I have forgotten,
Which ye prefer to roast and sodden*
Wine and wastels I date say,
And that is south of Usequebay,
Yea, there is Spanish Leaf^ enough,
As good as ever was mill`d in snuff*
I hope the`s many here to day
Who with a mirtie heart will say,
Now we have got a fair occasion,
And fit for to revenge our Lesione
We have sustain`d, go to and rise it
Wee`ll not get such if ye refuse it
Tho there be some men that may blame her*
Yet they`ll be far in wrong to shame her.
I think the three great doubts be solved,
And ye contented and resolved
That ye may be the better hearted*
I`ll start each doubt that may be started:
Its like, that some may fall a shrinking
And pussl`d be while they`r a thinking!
That those who here Commanders are
Are not well Verst in fates of ware,
But that's a silly supposition,
For we`l not meet with opposition,
And if that were yet for commanding
Doubt yet naught while I am a standing,
A copper Guinzie for their Feed
For I am a able hand indeed
And if we had such expectations:
One of his Graces near relations,
Give his assistance for a word* would,
Who ^eat things p^actice with his Sword could*
In sixty six he prov`d as stout as,
And bold as any of the Rout was*
He level`d equal, when he shot too,
So that his Ho^e luggs bullets got too*
Was he not in a grievous pe^ril,
When hot lead did his Horse luggs quarrel.
It`s like ye`ll think if ye steal ^oo much,
And with your Durks the people touch:
If the Cou^ry be to excess wrong`d,
Ye`ll be knut up like Dogs, and hang`d:
Tho there be many of the mind,
That Hanging is good of your kind;
The like of that should not demure you,
It`s not be so, I shall assure you:
Your Order is so vast and large,
It will defend you like a Targe*
And for ^xample, I`ll you tell,
Of my Brother* Old Dalzel:
How he caus`d shoot an Innocent,
Because he would not speak, anent
Things that he neither heard nor knew,
Ye see he`s never question`d now.
It`s like that some of you may spear,
Wherefore his Gra^e is not come here:
To start such doubts, is too like Treason,
Yet I`ll presume to give a Reason:
His Grace he cannot stire a foot,
He`s so oppressed with the Gout:
Although his Gout were somewhat ^ased,
Yet he might be Dilematized,
As to his Lady* what were best,
To leave her East, or bring her West;
To leave her East, would not be Right,
She`ll weary in the VVinter Night,
To bring her West, would mend but little,
For Highland Lairds are very kittle.
Although his Grace do stay a^ home*
Ye`ll say his Neighbor might have come:
He`s not so closs ty`d to his VVi^e,
But he behoov`d to wait on Fife:
To press the Band, and them redact,
To Order, by the Council`s Act;
In which S^re, he as some relate,
Behav`d himself at such a Rate,
That by his Care, and Diligence,
A Gentleman was at ^xpence:
In Oratrie to rack invention,
And shamefully lost his intention,
For as it`s said, he was put out,
Because he could not solve a Doubt,
His Countenance was somewhat broken,
Because he knew no^ how to slocken:
But here`s enough of this already,
Because it does concern a Lady:
Who, tho she aged be, and grown is,
Has made good use of what her own is:
Ye need not doubt him, ^or he is Loyal,
He`s grown without remisness Royal,
Which clear appears, and now is p^ out,
Since Lesly Families are cast out,
Tho these who were the chief Agente^s:
In sixty ^ix, a^e now Repenters,
And are discourted for reward,
That`s naught hi^ Grace is our safe guard.
And now I`le give you my advise,
And look to it if ye be wise,
Since that I hear that Rebels do
Haunt about the High lands too,
(...) once their D^trine their get rooting
Then farewell Th^ift, the best of Booting,
And this y^ see is very clear,
Daily experience makes it appear;
For instance lately in the Borders
Where there was no^ght but Theift and Mu^ders
Rapine, Cheating and Resetting*
Slight of hand fortuns getting*
Their designation as ye ken
Was all along the taking men;
Now Rebels prevails more with words
Then Drawgouns, does with Guns and Sword^*
So that their ba^e preaching now,
Makes the (...) keep the Cow,
Better then Scots or English KINGS
Could do by Kil^ing them with strings,
Yea those who were the greatest Rogues
Follows them over hills and Bo^es,
Crying for Prayers and for Preachi^,
For thy`l now h^ar none others ^eaching*
^ Charge you all, ye go not near them
If once they you engage to hea^ them,
There preaching easily pre^ails;
^'le pawn my Throat your trading fills,
At this Discourse their tails all bobed
They gave a gaunt and then they sob^d,
They threw there faces like Babowns
They muttered and rai^ed Sounds,
It griev`d them to the very Heart
To think that men and thie^ should (...),
And those last words inr^g d them more
Than all the Squire had said before.
The Squire perceiv`d his Heart did d^ce
For he had fall`n on this p^rchance,
He did admire and praise the pi^h of`t
And (...) and said, I hit the lit^ (...):
When he saw the^ so much concern`^
He lo^kt as if he had Go^rn`d*
A Thousand Millions at a host
The Whiggs he did at random boas^,
When he had them to full abule^
And all indemniti^ refused
He pau^`d a little, plac`d his hand
Upon his mouth and ^o did stand,
^n imitation of great Jove
While he did convocat the Drov^
Of Poets fancies* that he might
^ee that a Rogue got naught but right,
When he had roll`d his b^ains about
To see if he could ough^ find out,
That was mistaken or foregot,
He found ^e had no^ loos`d a knot,
VV^ich very necessar to loose is;
He lifts his hand, and mou^h uncloses,
Stood with such State and Reverence,
As he had been a Court to fence,
Her Nain s^ll shook her naked Breech^,
For she was tired with his speeches;
She would ^rr rath^r had a ^irrle,
Of an Aquavi^ae Barrel,
But he some patience extorted,
By promissing that he should short it.
And says, ye will make inquiry,
For the Ground and Reason why,
The Primat, ^ho was still so eagare,
To cleanse the Kirk with Sword and D^ger*
Is not come here to give his Blessing,
Ye`ll wonder that he is a missi^g.
He cannot come to distant places,
He`s troubled with so many Cases
Of Conscience, which he`s still dissecting,
And Court Exorbitances checking*
As whither the Liturgy has se^ forms,
For Sea-dangers, an^ ^reat Storms:
If (...), or Witches,
Deserves in La^ the Sharpest touches,
If Men for Reason should be p^n'd.

^ill by h^ feat^res I m confounded,
(...) I t^ink on her, my heart*^ wound^d:
Then down he shrunk like one that faint,
When deadly wounds the Leeches taint,
When stocks that are half rotten lowes,
They burn best, so does dry broom kowes
Her naine sell thought the speech was ended,
Their cries arose, the shouts ascended,
Tho Epilogie and Perroration
Did want that made no hesitation,
With one consent they raised Applaudo,
Till every hill resounded Laudo.
When this was done their Ranks were broken,
Some ran for drin^ their drought to slocken,
Some for Sack to help their Esquire,
For he was plunged in Desire:
Pipes were playing, Drums were beating,
Some s^izeing from their fellows getting?
Some were chasing hens and co^ks,
Some were loosing horse from vocks,
Some with snapwarks, some with bows,
Were charging Reers of Toops and Ewes,
Their stomachs so on edge were set,
That all was Fish came in the ne^t;
Trump^ts sounded, Skeens were glanceing,
Some were Tonal^ Cowper danceing,
Some cried, here to her Lord and Lady;
^e to he^ Mo^her and her Daddie,
And Sir King too, if the Lord please,
Then up with Plaids and scarts her Thighs,
There swarms of vermin, and sheep ^aids,
Delights to lodge beneath the Plaids,
For they like not in fro^ie VVeather
To sit upon her open leather,
Her name sell lapp and clap^ her narse,
More like a Mo^kie, nor like ^ars.
Some were stealing, some were riveing:
^ome were Wives and La^ g^ieving,
^ome`s teeth for cold did chack and chatter,
^ome from plaids were wringing Water:
^ea, to be short, more different postures*
(...) sewed on Hangings* Beds or Bolstures,
^oe various actings, modes and Stances,
^han`s read in Poems or ^omances;
^f some had seen this grand confusion,
^hey would have thought it a delusion,
^ome Tragedy of dismal Wights,
^r such like enchanted sigh^s.
Hera^litus if he had seen,
^e would have ^luther`d out his Even:
(...) he would gone dast.
^r elfe with laughing ^iven his chaft;
^ven such as might have understood them,

^ow they behaved when come there,
^ow neither friend nor for did sparc,
that plunder they away did bear,
^e partly afterward shall hear*
because some will be curious,
^o know how madly furious.
They prov`d against the public flee^,
Which at Barn doors and midings meets,
How each R^k by them abu^ed,
What be astly s^amles tricks they used;
I hope to give a short narratio^,
Grounded on the Infor^ation,
The heavy beer and sad complaint
Which to the (...) was sent,
By that poor and tossed shire*
When the Committ^e sat at Ai^:
The man who was Commi^,
Was Grave Sag^, Po^`d and Moderat
He gave a pe^ct Information
And Instap^es for his Prob^ion,
It is the best we c^n afford.
We Will strive to give it Word by Word
We need not tell how he go^ throw,
The swarmings of the Red s^ank Gre^,
Or what great hazard he was in too
E're he the Town of Air could win to^*
It is (...) for our intent,
To tell that he was theither sent,
That he got there and him behaved
According as the coun^rey craved,
When he a^ives, his b^ard he ^es,
Put new s^k ^tockings o^ his li^es,
and put on shoes of Turkey Leather,
As good as e`re tholl`d wind or Weather,
He c^uld not walk on with his Boo^s,
Because they did coa^k his Coots,
His hands and face he washed and dighted
His lac`d Grava^ he caus`d be righted,
His Knots and Ruff^ was right fine too,
He caused bring a ^lass of Wine too,
To keep his (...) from ma^ing,
For great men's look^ are very (...)*
He (...) and ^owdered h^s head too,
And in his ^and he took a Re^d too,
Went to the Gla^ and saw all fited
Then went he o^ and was admit^
He bow`d with h^mble reverence*
And saying, (...) pleas^ your EX^ELLENCE
With patience to lend you^ Ear
To our complaint and heavy b^ar,
We`le be ^puted in a miss
If we but ^ak of grievances,
Its ^ue w^ are not ^gnorant,
That ye by Order here are sent;
And that ye are (...),
The Westren (...) to (...),
We know his G^ does you allow,
In several things that's acted now
Tho he be no^ sole Head and Rector,
He`s like to turn a Lord Protect^r,
The last we ^ad, just us so (...),
When he caus`d some subscrive the (...),
I say the Tende^, l^k and sh^me on`^,
For I can never keep (...) name on`^;
We thought his Gra^ would ^e`er given orders
To commit rapi^* Thie^ts and Murders
At that rate they are now committed,
He never was so shallow witted,
For truly, they more cruel catrie,
Than ever Frenchmen under Marie,
Or Spaniards under Ferdinando did,
O^ French* when Duke of Guise commanded*
Yea they more savage far than those were,
Who with Kollkittoch and Montrose were,
And sixty times they`re worse than they
Whom Turner led in Galloway,
They durk our Tennents, shames our Wives
And we are in hazard of our Lives,
They plunde^ horse, and them they laden*
With Coverings, Blanket^, sheets and Plaidin
With Hooding gray, and worsted Stu^,
They sell our Tongs for locks of snuff.
They take our Cultors and our soaks,
And from our doors they pull the locks
They leave us neither shoals nor ^paids,
And takes away our I^on in^laids,
They break our pleughs, ev`n when they`^ workin
We dare not hinder them for du^king;
M^ Lords, they so harasse and wrong us:
There`s scarce a pair o^ shoes among us*
And for ^w bonnets they leave non,
That they can get their Clauts upon
If any dare refuse ^o give them,
They Durk them, S^rips them, and so leaves them
They ^ipe for Arms; but all they find,
Is arms with them, leaves naught behind,
^s`t not a strange mistake in that,
Our tankerds, and our Chamber Pot,
And stool pans, should be thought Granads
They take our Sadles and our Pades,
^hey stripe our Lecquies, ripes their Pouches,
^hey leave us neither Beds nor Couches,
^ea to be short they leave us naught,
That can from place to place be brought,
The Red Coats can tell them who spiers,
When they with them fell by the ears
When that their boo^ they laid hold of,
They had much more than I have told of,
Where some got wounds with sword and bal^
(...) sorry for`t the were so small,
^s if they could not Do en^ugh,
^hey fall on poor m^n at the pleugh,
because they do not understand,
Their Language they`ll cut off their ^and,
And for a proof, I think I have it.
Took out the hand and to them gave it
Another Instance, I shall tell,
^n which the Irish they excel,
When they a poor man had Destroy`d
Of meat clothes money made him void,
They left him naught that they could take
Except two horse and a corn stack,
The stack they fir`d through very spyte
But with the horse they would not qui^e,
^ill he some Money them did give,
One half whereof they did receive,
To buy the other naught he had,
Yet they so savage were and mad,
While the poor man with heavy Looks,
Was begging favor from these Ruikes,
The horse most die without remead,
They drove Lead Bullets through his head;
An other instance I shall give yet,
I shall be brief and to you Leave it,
When they by violence and force,
Had plundered a poor man's horse,
And Loaded him with his own gier,
For they took more than they could bear,
The poor man followed to releave him,
Still begging that they bake would give him,
But finding he could uot Prevaill,
That his requests did naught avail,
He slipped the branks from his horse head,
For which they shot this poor man dead,
Even Instantly without remorse*
Because they could not grip the horse*
His wife perceiv`d this Cruel deed,
She clapped her hands and ran with speed,
There she cry`d out as she thought good,
The Bishops guilty of this blood,
The King himself can scarce be free,
The Council, most of all the three,
As well as these who did the fact,
A vengeance come on the whole pack
She pray`d, that God would charge allon them
His, her`s* six childrens curse upon them
For giveing out such wicked Laws,
Against his people and his C^use
To gratify the Whore of Rome,
Long, Sad, and Heavy be their Doom.
For all the (...) Rapes and Murders
This Hells Crew does, are by their Orders.
Tho they did neither rive nor steal,
Their meat which is good Hens and Veal,
The best of Bread, good Ale and Wine
It se^s them ill, shame on their kind;
Would us destroy in a shore space,
Its true, as I hold up my face,
For they most have four times a day,
And more at once, (...) clear to say,
Then might (...) a great Coach Mare,
For any half day in the Year;
For sixty men or but few more
The^'l take up quarters for seven ^core,
An shilling Starling we most grant,
For each person that they want,
And* six pence also they receive,
For each Tail of them they have,
And thus each day must be renew`d,
That they take (...) ^ wish they sp^w`d;
Our Glasgow Provost its told to us
With his new Acts will quite undo us
That hagish headed Cawlie sure,
Has done to break us, to his power,
It were an Almes-deed to hang us
When we let such a Varlet wrong us,
Amongst the rest of their Trespasses
They Are often employed in chaseing Lasses,
It is too evident a token,
Of this when Maidens bakes are broken
Yea tho they touch them not at all,
They`r like to starve for very called
For when they sit their plaids do hang by,
Ye'l see from Navels down each thing fie,
Such sights the Lasses cannot bide,
So they mnst starve in a backside,
And here ou instance I shall tell,
Of what to one of rhem befell:
This red shank from no good pretense,
Pursued the Lass been to the spence
And aiming at some naughty deed,
Pulled up his played and ran with speed,
She with a (...) in her hand,
Advised him a back to stand,
But he prefuming for to strugle,
Occasioned a huble buble
The story it is something od
She Mith a Flesh*eruik gripr his cod,
So held and rag`d as made him squil
And ay cry out the Deu`l the Deu`l,
But getting of away he flees,
While blood was streading down his Thighs
For several days he keept his Bed
And when got up he strid led
From either hands they get small thanks
Who are the Authors of such p^anks.
VVas`t not a cunning plot and witty,
To make Killmarnoe^ two hours booty,
Must he not be a man of sense,
And well deserves a recompense
Who fell upon that famous way,
To make the Red shanks ready pay,
At once to work that subtle ploy,
Them to make up and us destroy.
But here I Will stop, if these offend not,
And only say behold the end o`t.
They answered him we`l cleanse your Land
If ye be clear to take the Band,
He paused a little, drew his breath,
And made a congie, then he says:
My Lords if we had got fair play,
Ye had not came so soon this way,
For we`r informed that ye found
As great opposers to the Bond,
In Clidsdale where you were before
As ye do here, I do abhore,
That Nations rulers should prove partial
In this affair tho it be Mariiall,
For Clidsdales bonders, as ye ken
Are scarcely reckon`d amongst men,
The ^umid Earl, Papist Haggs,
An A^hiest Jew, to save his Baggs,
And Fleeming too did prove a sot,
Least he bad lost the Bishops Coat.
Bedlay with Tow^orss and Wood*hall,
John Thomsons man, plague on them all,
There`s also other two or three,
Which with Your Leave I must let be,
Or else resolve to get me hence,
Or spew before your Excellence:
For, since I took them in my mouth,
They have defil`d it so in Truth,
That I was ne`re so sore agasting,
To keep my Stomach from over* casting:
We know their Overture propos`d,
But that`s naught, since it was refus`d:
It was repute a good Defense,
Yet they lost both their Meat and Men^e.
I am not clear for such Politics,
Tho Statesmen, but for fear of Critics.
I`le say no more, this is the sum o`it,
Let none do ill, that good may come o`it*
We who with out Indulgince still b^des,
When others runs to Muires and Hill sides,
Are first assaulted by Oppressors,
Who are by fat the least (...):
Even as so that which ye call Law,
Your Lordships does the samen know.
And this be all the good we get o`it
We would not care tho we were quite o`it.
We are inform`d we`re naught the better
Of Some who lately wrote a Letter,
Now let them drink as they have browen,
if it be true, the worst`s their own.
We cannot guess unto this time,
What is our Fault, or what`s our Crime.
Nor any Reason to annoy us,
^ar l^ss, wherefore ye thus destroy us*
^he like is not upon Record,
Nor read, that ever King or Lord,
^estroy`d their own, both Flock and Fleece,
While harmless and living in peace,
^iving no provoca^ion,
^ot doing harm to any one;
Had there been one in all the Land,
That did oppose or yet gainstand,
^e might have pleaded some pre^ence,
^n defense of your Violence,
^ut since there`s none, makes Ours alas,
Be an unprecedented case,
Which case is partly I conclude,
^ven by your Lordships understood,
^ho, there`s not told the thousand part,
Of our afflictions and our smart,
The whole no persons can express,
Of all our Ruin and Distress,
Although that innocent we be,
We`re plagued, and harassed as ye see,
For innocence proves no defense,
Against this Spait of violence,
What can the great Turk order worse,
Then murder, rob, and Conscience force*
But there`s a Righteous Judge who see*
Such who govern, and who ^yrannize,
Who in his due time prepar`d,
To give to each his own reward,
Before whose throne I hope ye, r, clear.
Both great and small must all appear,
Advise my Lords what than yee`ll say,
For that which ye practice this day
Tho we now suffer to out Loss,
We hope the Lord will bless our Cross*
If ye have no relief to send us,
Go to, dispatch, eat up and end us
They answer`d if yee`ll not conform,
Ye must resolve to bide the storm,
His Grace has sworn that every man,
That is beswixt Bersheba and Dan,
Must take the band or he`ll do better,
He`ll heat the furnace seven times hotter,
At which, this good man was amaz`d,
Looked sternly upon all and gazed,
Then made a small bow, turn`d his bake,
And not one other word he spoake,
When he was gone they did admire,
To find the man so void of fear,
So wise so grave and confident,
So ready, and so eloquent,
They Judg`d he was a man of Sense,
That well could Defend Innocence,
His countenance was very stay`d,
He was not easily dismay`d*
His personage did reptesent
As much as any could be sent:
In Politics he was well seen*
Yet Ma^havile and Mazarine,
And all other A^sickles he hates*
He counts their Policies Deceits,
Grand Oppressions, Tricks, Tyrannick^,
Country Plagueing, Plots, Satauicks,
He was well ^ersed in Court Modes;
In French Pavies, and new Com`d Nods;
And finally, in all that can
Make np a Complete Pretty Man*
NOW how the Red-Shanks ran away,
How these behaved that did stay,
How they the Halie Kirk Resorm`d,
What Castles, and what Towns they storm`d,
Whose Hens was slain, whose Geese murder`d*
What great Designs by them was further`d
And what great Credit to the King
His Grace (...) by this design:
How Conventickles all were qu astit,
And Schismatics destroy`d and dashed:
And how our nobles Journyed
How their addresses did succeed,
Art court how they did represent
The countries Loss, and sad compla int,
And what success therein they had,
And whether it was good or bad,
How they got off and how things past,
Which of ye sactions had the best,
^e`l hear when my Parnassus whinchie*
Gets of Fount Cablin a pounchie,
^ud therewith s^ives her empty Tearses,
And hatched up with lumps of Verses.

Upon the Lamentable, yet Gallant Glorious Death, of that singularly Pious, and
eminently Faithfuly Servant, and truly Loyal Subjec^ of the King of Saints,
fervently Zealous for the Interest of his Masters Glory, and otherwise univer
sally well accomplished Gentleman Thomas Ker of Hayhope; Who wa^ cruelly
murdered in a Rancounte^ with a Party. commanded by Co^ Struthers, near
Crockome, a Villag^ upon the English Border. Anno 1678.
COme all ye Hero's, come each Virtuous (...)
Each generous Soul approa^h, come (...) mee^
Come let us meet with tears: This Fate allows
You lofty Heavens, contract your clowdy brow^
Turn Vapors into Tears, that we with you
May mourn, and mourn again, since it is tru^
That he is torn from us by rapid Fate,
By so perfidious hands, at such a rate:
Whom, if we well consider, we shall find
Thar he his Equals have left few behind,
But ah I shrink I could I surmo^nt as far
Parnassus mountain, as the highest Star,
The St^gian lake: could I Devotion lay
^s open to Men's veiw as light of day.
Could I describe true valor, true discretion:
Could I on kindness put due Estimation;
Then should ^rack my fancy, stretch my quill;
That my Engine might correspond my will,
Ye who with airy Quiddites vex your wit,
^ay by your trivials, here`s a Theme more fit:
Of this brave Hero let this doubt be tossed;
When deadly wounded when his blood was lost,
How he, ev`n then most valourously behav`d,
Shedding that blood which him of life bereav`d*
Ye who about the Helicon resort,
Leave off your canting in Romani^k sort:
Here is a Subject; here concerned are ye;
Pen Elegiacks; here`s a Tragedy:
Here lies a Hero in humanly torn:
Her^ lies the Muses friend, who did adorn
His Poems with a soaring style: Here lies
Kindness abolish`d; here the Widow cries;
Here bowls his Kinsfolk; here his Friends hang down
Their dumbled eyes, the Church does faint and swon,
For lack of him, who spent his time, his strength
Into her quarrel, clos`d his day at length*
Ye who write Annals, and all ye that treats,
Of high Exploits, and memorable Fates,
Pray do not miss, record this signal Strife,
It`s memorable; pen his Death and Life,
That our Successors may in mourning, do
What our Marmorean Hearts can not win to.
When hollow silver, or pure brass does raise
The noise of War, and sounds Heroes prai^e,
Be not ungrate* Amongst the first allow
To him a triple Quier; for it`s due.
Ye who delight to entertain the Views
Of grovelling Mortals, by your specious Hews,
Prepare your pencils; set some time a part;
With twice thrice lively Colors help your Art^
Draw ye this Noble Hero on his K^ees,
Sending the latest Rays of his fair Eyes
Toward these Regions, where pure Spirits sing
Thrice blessed Hallelujahs to their King;
Spending his newest breath, in forming sounds,
Not to lament the pangs of death, or wounds;
But po^s them foreward, while his Soul did sta^
Taking her last farewell of what was clay:
Pray, draw in vive Characters (do not miss)
These strea^s of blood, which from that breast of hi^
Came trickling down, that these who chance to (...)
This Tragic Sight, may weep his Elegy.
O Heavens! O Earth! O Floods! O roaring Sea^
Ye lo^ty Mountains, Groves, and stately Trees;
Ye rampant Lions, and ye savage Bears,
Ye cruel Tigers, all burst forth in Tears.
Irradient Sun, fair Moon ob^cure your face,
Ye Minor Splendors, hold your Rays a space:
Ye soaring Eagles, that do mount on high,
Conveen your subjects, raise a doleful cry,
So that the Clouds alarmed by your Voice,
May send you Tears to equalize ^our Noise.
But ah I why erave we aid? since lifeless things
Beggs our asistanee, numerous Tears down s^rings
From Heav`ns overclou^ed brows, on mou^s and ^es,
Which (...) posts them to ^he Floods and ^eas:
Which altogether mourning, ^oaring make,
And make their Banks to sympathize and sh^ke.
The Clouds colliding raises hideous sounds,
Which from therocks, in mour^ful wis^rebounds
The statrs seem to disdain, to grant a smile,
To dead, dull Mankind, till they mourn a while*
The sun hides his fair face: The Moon`s ^ur`d
The Earth`s astonish`d: Only we`re obdur`d*
Let others pen his prai^s, who do soar,
In thoughts sublime; I halt, and say no more;
But only thus abruptl^ will conclude,
O hight of Kindness, Nature mild and good!
O true Religions ^on! O Nations Lover!
O soul sublimer, than rhese Heav`ns could covet!
O Noble Ker! O Pattern of Renown!
We groan on Earth, thou wears a Heavenly Crown.

For not frequen^ing hal^ Ki^k
But meeting when the nights grow mirk,
The old desease which still does trouble,
And keep the Nations in a hubble;
Or when some Noblemen begins
To judge o^ Dogs and Foxes skins.
But sudden falls, and sudden rises,
Fills Coffee Houses with ^rprises.
A whelp may gape to snatch a bone,
And after worrie thereupon.
When Irish swearers pro and c^n,
^acknameras, and Pegmiton,
Wi^h Eust^s Cummin and the rest,
^f ^he blind Stenchels of that Nest
Where showing their alac^ity
(...) serving of his Majesty.
But Willawinnle dull braind Foolls
They could not play at Byas Bowls,
With that dexterity an^ slight
That men thought hand fed Irish might,
No, wonder I my consciences,
Did sc^rce at Irish Evidences,
For by St. Patrick of great Note,
They swear a man into the plot,
And by an other swear him out
That all is true, ye need not doub^:
They need no contrediction ^ear,
Who per eundem do not swear,
Some mu^e the Court, could not discover
Some two three Boot^s all England over,
Who had not prostitute their fame,
And cloath`d themselves with publi^k shame,
When Provost Dick to please the Duke;
As some says search the Statute Book,
And err`d as much in Application
As others did in ^xplanation*
Some men must t^ experiments
To prove the^`re Knaves and Ig^orants,
When some gives Nine P^s, (...) Crowns
Gr^ats, Sixpences, Shilling`s Ducadouns,
To be absolv`d, fred and protected,
When by the Haly K^k ejected.
Some say its wrong men should do so,
Others its right enough although,
I^s Simonie, ^o sell such things,
N^ plot it on the buyers brings.
We do not think, them true ejections,
And so may purchase our protections.
Some say tho we were ne re so wise
We must be sharers of the Vice
Adhereing closse to the Contract
Which we (...) make.
Ea^h sober person sure concludes,
A buyer up of tri^ed goods,
If ^ingly he make ^is paction*
Incurres the haz^rd o^ an action,
Of cheatrie and`s a Rogue as he,
Who makes the Sale so Simonie,
Dirts b^ganers on both the hands
Who Simonie right understands,
^Wod^ it not only they that grease
A Bishop for a benefice
But they who purchase privileges
Of Church for money, bond or pledges
Commits this foulsome in discretion
Whatever be some estimation:*
Some are for bonds, Some are not willing,
Under the pain of forty shilling
To give a bond to serve the Devil,
It^ So^tish ignorance, gross evil
To think Engadgers are made free,
For paying of a penal^ie.
To pay a penaltie`s a checking,
And punishment for bargain breaking.
A bond with penal^ie appended,
Was nev`r alternative pretended.
And though it were, some cannot see,
How it with Reason can agree,
That Men engag`d to be Mass-hearers,
Idolaters, or Surplice Wearers:
Or else to pay a thousand pounds,
For this they see no solid grounds;
Since they who do revolve the pages,
Of Sufferers in former Ages.
And glours while they be like to faint,
Can find no pithie Precident.
Some do afs^rt that foulsome facts,
Are not the matter of Contracts:
Though this dull and unstable birth*
Which at this time possess the Earth,
Seeks out raw shifts, and poor hen wiles,
And with such trash themselves beguiles.
Some think this case the matter clears,
To such as foul engagements fears.
Suppose a Man should make a paction,
To perpetrat a vicious Action,
Or pay a sum; but at the day,
He has no money for to pay*
The action in it self is ill,
But yet by the Superior`s will,
It`s Leasome; Pray you what defense,
What sound or probable pre^ence,
Can this Man use, when he`s put to it,
Either to pray, or else to do it?
According as he has contracted,
Let any judge how he had acted.
And so they do hold up their face,
And says, since there can be Case,
That he for Conscience sake must break it,
It was a foul abuse to make it*
Who brayes in mortars Cheats and Fools,
For their reward must wash their Tools,
It Is thought he is a Man discreet,
Who in this World keeps his feet,
And seeing he no good can do it,
Can let it stand as he came to it.
Left this be thought a long digression,
It was when Scottish Lords of Session
Lays by their Gowns, their Pates to please,
When some do burn Popes Effigies.
Whither it be by some mischance,
Or by some Noxious Influence:
Of things Etherial when they stray,
Or meet in a menaceing way.
In this I am not thoroughly seen:
Consult Robin in Aberdeen,
And Gadberry, who speaks of Wars
And Peace, by gazing on the Starts.
And when that ye have well sought through them
Ye`ll be as wise as they never knew them.
Whither it be by some impression,
The Comet left upon that Nation,
Or from some spitful Exhalations,
From Surfeit Excess or Repalations,
Or if it be from Kingdoms greening,
Or Mall Contents, (ye know my meaning)
Or if it come from these can Cheat,
And among Cockle sow good Wheat,
Or if it be from the Court evil,
From Proserpina, Pope or Devil,
Who vexes Land at such a Rate
With the fowl fine of Venice State.
Or from some underhand Engadgers;
To be the Romen Trade`s Managers.
From Bankrupt Lords, or Public Whores:
Its hard to speak of higher Powers.
Whither it be from Earth or Hell,
Or from French Ait, I cannot tell,
Or from St Omers, or Lovain,
From Madrid or Sevil in Spain,
Or from Lisbon, or if it be
From some Convent in Germany.
(I cannot think it be from Poland,
Moscovia, Denmark, Pruss, or Holland)
Or if it be some sad foretoken,
That Church and Kingdom shall be broken,
I`le not presume to manifest
But Scotland`s troubled with a Test.
I do not presently incline
To scale its Nature or design,
To speak of Authors or Inventors,
Opposers, Favorers, Consenters,
Or those, who tho they did not love it,
Had nev`r the courage to disprove it,
This might be counted pressure treasure;
A wrangld word yet, I may use her,
When I revising such fond actions,
Use old Scots absolute contractions:
To portrait Rogues in an Old style,
In new it were not worth my while,
Since I`m persuaded not a few
Have neatly limm`d them in the new*
I hope it will be no offense,
Or if no evil consequence;
To make Relation of a Sort
Of Clergy Men and their Deport.
They being men of Public Station,
Concerned yearly with the Nation
How some turns Stupid, others Storm`d,
How some Refused, and yet conform`d,
And how somes Conscience bounc`d and kicked
When too sore thrumbled, nipt and pricked,
How some had no restaint would take it
Because Superior powers did make it,
How some oppos`d it other doubted*
And many sentiments about it,
Which I intend if I have time
And Genius for a daft Ratry me.
No Muses help I will implore
For I was nev`r at Lesbos shore
Neither did haunt Arcadian Glens
Groves, mountains Watersides and Fens
My seet nev`r filed that brooky hill
Where Ancient Poets drank their fill
For their did haunt the Nymphs and Muses
Which old Wives fables so much tuses
There Pan kept sheep, and there it was
Where, the red haird glyed wanton lass
Did skilt through woods ov`r banks and braes*
With her blind get: Who Poets says
Could shoot as well as these that sees,
Yea better then he had eyes.
There the old Nun her Yaitn did windle,
Which she had spun with Rock and Spindle,
Here young Mercurius to teach thieves,
Did trist his Bastards Brothers Bieves,
But these who have the Thames and Humber
The Tees and Tvne need not them cumber
To go so far to fetch a drink
For I am very apt to think
There`s als much Virtue Sonce and Pith
In Annan, or the Water of Nith;
Which quietly slips by Drumfries,
Als any Water in all Greece.
For there and several other places
About mill dams and green brae faces,
Both Elrich, Elfs and Brownies stayed,
And Green gown`d Farries daunc`d and played;
When old John Knox, and other some
Began to plott the Baggs of Rome
They suddenly took to their heels.
And did no more frequent these fields*
But if Romes Pipes perhaps they hear,
Sure for their Interest, they`ll compear
Again, and play their old Hells Tri^ks.
But lest that I should seem Pollix,
To paraphrase I Will make an end,
And touch the matter I intend.
On August last day as ye know,
This Test obtained the force of Law;
And all subscriptions were to carry,
A date, before first January,
And tho they`re several Men that say,
The ^lack horned Devil bides his day.
Yet Zeal Catholic pressed the Test,
Before it well got out of Nest;
So like a Thiefs neck it did run,
With shellie Lodging on its bun:
Which strange depart both near and far,
Caus`d the poor Clergy, muse and jarr,
And beg the favor of the Act,
E`re they were forc`d the Test to take.
When the poor Men had done their best,
It was applied go take the Test.
In this Quandarie it did please
The Bishop of the Diocese,
To call the Clergy all together,
To weigh the matter and consider:
He thought when all were met, they would
Make of a bad Game what they could.
When they were met, and doors were closed,
And in their seats were well composed:
That there might not be much delaying,
The Cavalier bade some be saying,
Since no need was for his reciting
The end and Reasons of their meeting.
And he would tell what was his mind,
When he their sentiments should find.
When they began to point and gaze
Up start brave Sophee with a fr^ze,
For he was big with some discanting
Where Qua and Quod were nothing wanting,
He moves his hands and then his sees,
And causes brows with fat checks meet,
And then to Heaven casts up his eyes,
Like a Mass Prieft at Sacrifice,
He bends his capon breast and belly
He thought himself a Fellow j^lly;
With many more such A^tick motions
Occasioned by Chymerick notions,
And after rites of Courtisie
He thus began in Majesty:
My Lord, our meeting at this place
Is to decide a weighty case
In which our Faith and Manners too
Have much concernment and ado
But since in a more solemn way
It does concern our Loyalty
To Higher Powers le^s (...) be rash
Lest our good Name may get a dash,
If we our Loyalty should stain
I know not what we shall retain.
I`le not use much exordium
But to the purpose I will come,
I have considered the Test
And scruples wherewith some are pressed
Objections, Doubts, and every thing,
Which make some Brethren fl^sk and fling,
Which done, I`m forced to suppose,
There`s many`s sight as shorts their nose,
Or else we would not thus miscarry,
And be in such feiry ferry.
I know it is the common cry,
The Test does Opposites imply.
Then surely seeing it cannot
Stand with it self in every jot:
If King and Council do not mend it,
No Soul can take it, or defend it.
But pray be pleas`d to lend your ear,
I hope to make the thing as clear,
To any Man that has a Head,
As Ale and Potage, Milk and Bread:
And make it pass the ^aitest Neck,
Like Malago, or Cherry-Sack,
I`m Man enough f^'t, do not doubt it,
Attend and I shall fall about it,
Consider first, the Test does bring,
In its last Part, no other thing,
Then that wherewith we`re all content,
At least we have giv`n our consent,
Either in words Formaliter,
Or practice Virtualiter:
Which well considered, cannot but
Help well to loose this Gordian Knot.
In the first Clause does ly our stress,
There`s rugged work I must confess,
But let a good Logician Pause,
And well consider why that Clause
Is now enjoyn`d, and let him weigh
What Qua, and what Formalitie
It comes under, he may read,
Consistence as clear as a Bead,
And need not stumble or demurr,
With Soul and Conscience to concur.
It is intended to secure
Us, from the Babilonish Whore,
Old Heresies and Innovations,
That rages in our Neighbor Nations;
And joined to the other clause,
To keep us subject to the Laws,
To banish Niceties and Schisms,
Preciseness and Fanaticisms.
I hope there is no Man here to day,
Presumes to think far less to say,
That ev`r it was design`d to reave,
The King of his Prerogative.
Or to turn Prelates to the Door,
Or to impare their Right and Power.
Now let it fully serve its ends
If ought abound or do offend.
And so your Conscience prick or gnaw,
Let it be brought to this new Law;
By which it is easy to conclude,
Haw each thing should be understood.
Posterior Laws annul each thing,
By which their purpose and design,
In former Laws is contradicted.
Then Conscience here need not be pricked,
For let this Law have Life or Breath,
Each thing in that Symbol of Faith:
Which may oppose losses it is feet,
Turns absolute, and is attrite.
In short I think there is none so fond,
But knows how Scripture is expon'd:
To wit, the darker by the plainer,
Here we must do in that same manner.
Pray Brethren but consider then,
That we the Symbol must explain,
Not by the first Authors intentions,
But by the Orders and Inventions,
Which since were statute* and now stand
Established within our Land.
Let no Man say that I presume,
Power Legislative to assume,
For by their favor that so says,
I by their Laws expone my Faith.
I hope now I have red the floor,
And put confusion to the door.
I think I need not be precise,
Each thing to particularise.
Yet least that any should expect,
That I should every point dissect:
Of all our fetters I will red you,
Distinguish but as I shall bid you,
A head Art: 11 Lin: 24, Conf: Faith
that is Coordinate,
From that which is Subordinat,
A head in sensu Proprio,
From one in sens* Analago,
Distinguish me a head Per se
From per sequellam, flowing frae
The power Christian Magistrates;
Which with the same coagulats:
And Tyrants Art: 14 Lin: 12.
who want titles just
From those who cheat and break their trust.
And do not foster foolish fictions,
By argumenting from Art: 14 L. 10 and 12
restrictions,
Nor do not think that every thing
That Is to be offered to a King
When to be crowned Obj: Against the Test from the 8 Act of Par. KING JAMES 6:
there the King being oblidgd to take the Coronation Oath for the preservation
of the Protestant Religion and Liberty of the Subjects.
although rejected
Does make his right to be suspected.
I hope there is none wants this Impression,
Who reads the new Act of Succession.
Apply these to the kittle places,
That makes you wink and throw your faces:
I you assure it will discuss him,
And make you current ad amussum
He makes a small bow, takes his seat,
And looks like Don in Regal state.
Vain pride ^id circumvaile his eyes
Which now he throws toward the skies,
And then then he squints them on his Mates
As they had been a pack of Rates.
These did conclude, that saw his starings,
He thought himself no stinking herrings,
While some were grieving, some were groaning
Some in their heart; their case bemoning
Some hanging heads down like a Bulrush,
Some looking Briskly that were full sprush,
Some turning up their gay Mustachoes,
And others robbing their dull pashes,
And others rounding to their Goss.
That you was an Aurelian closs,
Upstarts a Priest and his hug head claws,
Whose Conscience was but yet in dead Thraws
And did not cease to cave and paut,
While clyred back was pricked and gald,
Which frighted with this strange surprise
Wrought to its knees, and strove to rise.
But racked tendous, deizie head
Toom nerves, dry veins made it with speed,
Fall back, and then begin to grasp
Like a dead Mare at the last gasp.
And says, ye speak sir like a Man
Who meikle with your Logic can,
But there is a Clause, sir, at the end o't,
Even for my Beneson gare mend it.
No Gloss, nor sweet Equivocation;
Distinction Mental Reservation:
No Logic qua, nor ens rationis,
Though Suarez Scotus, de Raconis,
Though Thomas. Compton, Bone spei,
Were here to help, would bear a sway;
To make a Man though of a dull wit,
If he knew a B by a Bull foot;
To undertake that drearie task,
And then put on the bootless mask
Of some ill spun Equivocation,
Or Metaphysick Explication,
Let the explainer do his best,
The foresaid clause of this black Test,
Hocipso that he does explain,
Makes perjury his Conscience stain,
Since to that sense he is bound to swear,
That the plain words do use to bear;
Your Clergy is not with a bubble
Your Notions flee like dust and stubble,
Before the Wind, where e're it blows,
You Are fit to butcher a good cause.
To speak the thing I think my sell,
Let Us lay our count, with Death and hell
With Contumely, slight and shame,
While we Inhabit this dull frame,
Let Us take the Test there is no relief,
And bruike our pudding, bread and Beeff,
Lie by our fires, and warm our lends,
And sleep on coats of geese and hens.
Or else resolve on racked necks,
By some plutonick Carnifex,
And though you should dit up my mouth
I`le swear this is the naked truth:
Thus having said, he is like to faint,
Gaunts like a Mo^k, precise in Lent:
But this did raise the Sophees humor,
His face fumed in blosie tumo^.
His words came out by tuos together,
For one could not abide another;
They were so hasty to bate down,
That long lave Lugged Landward Lown.
That had the Sophee so abused,
Thus he broke out in words confused.
I knew some peevish Cl^nish Carlie,
Would make some noise and hurly burly.
You speak Sir, and you wot not what,
Yet must be meuting like a Cat,
Another Trade sir, sets you better,
Then to speak none sense in a matter
Of such concernment, Sir your skill
Were some what fitter for the mill,
To Reconcile the hoop and clapper,
With Liar, Runner, and the Happer,
We came not here with Fools to clatter,
Or wave our fingers in the water,
Let one that knows the case speak sense,
And he shall get an audience.
The Priest said naught, but Brethren truly,
This Gentlemen, can not be thoroughly.
But then a Priest both wise and sage,
Who grieved to see the Sophees r^ge.
Who did abhore his hight and H^ffings,
His Hectorings, his stares* and snuffings;
He could not bide his vain pre^ences,
Contrived to cheat Men's consciences,
Rose up, and in a sober manner,
Began to speak, whereof the tenor
As follows is, (where ye may see
His Candor and Fidelity)
My Lord, and Gentlemen, I think
It is no time for us to wink,
Or in our eyes to put our Thums!
Or to be meanac'd with threats and glooms,
Well speak our minds Though we be weak,
For Soul and conscience is at stake:
But yet my Brethren e're I trace,
Brave Sophee's sentiments in the case,
His arguings and his probations,
Distinctions and his explications,
I Am forced to beg your leave to tell,
If what we say he do refell,
As he has now refel'd our Brother,
We need not speak I pray consi^er,
He spoke nothing might give offense,
The thing he said was wit and sense.
And if my judgment do not fail.
Upon the head he hit the nail.
And with one blow drive it so right,
That it is not be reversed this night.
But now I will come to the point,
And Sophee's Coupelings (...),
Which if I do not bring t^ pass
There ^ othe^s here that can canvass
And show, that they are wan^ing weight,
To crook a conscience that is straight.
B^t now good Sophee I will trace you,
And think not that I do disgrace you*
If I enquire in V^ritie
And lie not on Authority,
Si^, as to what you first assert
I will not touch for my own part*
For though I think it wants probation
And might abide sharp disputation,
It is not the perplexed Nexus
That thus does in^ricate and vex us.
Whereas ye say; we must perp^nd
The Causes, Tendancie, and End.
I do (...), we so shall do,
And easily shall g^ant you to,
Both worker^ an^ works tendencie
I^ this did at the first aggree
To banish Antichri^ian ^ables,
Mass, Altars, holy Gr^und, and Tables
Romes Orde^s, Penance and Precessions,
I^s (...)* Ear Conf^ssions,
I^s H^ly Waters, and its Bells,
I^s (...), (...), and S^th ^un Wells,
I^s Pu^gatory, and its Prayers,
For Dead, i^ Monks, and its Mass Sayers,
Its Friars, Dependents, and Abetors,
Encouragers and all Romes crea^res:
I^s Saints, Relicts, Image Worship,
Which to poor Souls brought skai^h and hership*
Its Hiera^chy and all its Trash^y
That stained Men's conscience with its fashry.
The works intention is the same
Since in the very words and frame,
I^s renovat confirmed and Pressed,
As the first clause of this new Te^t:
And surely the Confirmers pr^ject
Can come no better in our prospect,
Then by perpending usual figns,
To wit words sentences and lines,
By which ^hey do themselves express,
And very plainly do pro^esse,
That all concerned must sig^e and swear
In the same sense the words do ^ear.
Which if we do, we plainly loss
The help of your Aurellion gl^sse.
But Sir, it seems your explication,
Does intervert i^s Ordination
This symbol was form^d that we
From Roman Harlotry should fl^e
By it Church (...) were instructed
In Truth and Unity conducted,
By it they saw how to evite
The Path^ of Babylonish feet:
But Sir, your gloss ^ends us to rake
The dig'st that Popes and Devils make,
The same to ^earch and fall a finding,
What part of this Symbol is binding.
A brave refuge I must confess,
For a poor conscience in distress
Your arguing will lose it sale
And turn as we^sh as sal^less kail,
To any who thi^ Symbol reads
And finds that there are several heads
That does oppose Catholici^,
And foster that which ye call Schi^me.
Good Sophee, I would have you minding,
That by your Clergy these are binding*
Because they are opposite to Popery,
To Antichristian Trash and Foppery:
Yet their Validity you r^ze
Since they promote the Whigg^sh caus^.
That Christ is only Head and King
Of his own Church, thwarts the Design,
Of Popery; and for Whiggs do make
Against the Explicating Act.
Since i^ both Monarchs, Kings and Popes,
And Princ^s from that Head^hip Lopes,
And since the Pope does not presume,
An ^quall He^dship to assume
But will be (...), that
He be esteemed a Deligat;
A man of Reason, must conclude
This clause does not only exclude
A Head that is Coordinate,
But that which is subordinate.
So this Distingu's not well founded,
The rest I think no better grounded.
Pray Sir, who ever yet did plead,
To be an Analogick Head?
Neither could such a Headship 'gree
With our present Supremacy.
And what a monstrous Headship's that
That flows from the Magistrate*
Sir, if your Logicks here be good,
The Church shall have a Mul^itude
Of heads: and yet one Body still,
Let men say of it what they will:
The Pope has far the better Plea
About this business then we,
And justly flings that foul disgrace
Of ^emale Heads upon our Face.
But here I need not to insist,
Read at your leisure if you list,
Gilespie, Catherwood and Voet;
Who puts the matter out of doubt,
Since it a Good Work is Reputed,
To liberat the persecuted,
And to defend Poor Sakeless Wights,
Who may be Robbed of their Rights;
Als well by Kings their malversation,
As by a Cromwels Usurpation,
Your L^gick Sir's, not worth a Spittle
*Twixt Rogues that have and want a Title.
Who knows the acting and condition
Of these who framed this old (...)?
How Knox with Leithingtown did reason,
And when he was accus^d of ^reason?
How to the Queen he Answered,
And what repor^ the counsel made:
May without labor clearly find,
That your dis^inction is but wind.
Which is considered will make good,
What from that sentence we conclude,
Which if restricted, I am loath
To touch the Coronation Oa^h,
If the Sessions Act be right;
I think that Oath can have no weight.
For all your confidence, good Master
You most prepare a fitter plaster
Then these distinctions, for I Am sure
They will not wo^k a kindly cure;
I am no Lawer I ^onfeis
Yet by your leave ^'le grossly guess,
Thought new Laws may ^he old correct,
And lo deprive them of effect;
It betters not your cause a straw
For by your Argument, no Law
Can pai^ the ^est, the smallest whit,
Since there is none sub^quent to i^:
About Religio,n and I hope
You will not make a Law to loupe;
And sned it sel^, and hear my Brother;
One place cannot explain another.
Its made already fully clear
The present Test no gloss can bear;
Good Sir your Logicks were far be^ter,
For Form substantial, and first matter,
Chimeras, A^omes and void pla^es,
And for imaginary ^paces
For Occult Qualities and Unions,
Instincts and Summulis^s Opinions,
(To tell your young Logicians,
What F^ther Aristotle means,
B^ actus in potentia entis,
Qua in potentia) ratio mentis
^roportionales alequatae
Parts, and Spherae primo motae:
With many more such ^rothie quibbles,
Which Schoolmens, brains throw out like bubbl^s
For Universals and Relations,
Then for connecting Implications
A Chapelane's easier refut^d
Then such a matter prosecuted.
The Sun had not singed Ph^etons hair,
Had he not walked beyond his sphere,
Nar^issus f^nd with Eccho's clatter
And other Hussies fleicht and flatter,
To see his face, ran to a pool
And there lay gazoing like a fool;
For at this time the Lads and Lasses,
Had not the use of lo^king Glasses
While tu^ning d^zie down he fell,
With heels over head into the well.
Our country Dames must try the Leaching,
And old King James must ^all a Preaching.
Baxter must be a Connecture,
Of pugnant Tenants, I Conjecture
In stead of Amity and Union
He broacheth out a new Opinion,
Who Sows such Recon^ilations
Reaps liberally Innovations
And are derided for their pains,
And repute Men of flotting brains,
Dame Talmash when she turned her Grace,
In Parliament, must have her place;
Who knew the verity I Trow,
The half of this will ^erve her now;
There ^ome old hor^e turnrd out of stable*
When young Dames are at Council ^able;
The Fate of somewere once Dandillies;
Might teach the younger S^ags and Fillies,
Not for to Trample poor Cart* Horse
Yet they still the worse and worse:
Though when they are high they flisk and fike,
Yet Dogs get of their bones to pick
Men cannot walk within their Stations,
But ^imps and Whores must govern Nations
Grotins must be a Divine,
The Bramble must Protect the Pine,
Salmasius must write in Law,
There Is many Apes of Aesops Craw*
For all this there might be some seen,
If Mortals would but strive with Men.
But Kings and Poets, I Will say naught bot;
It Is not unknowen what Herod Got;
Some hungry Tykes falls by the Ears,
From others cheekblades collops Tears;
About the Licking of the Looms,
Before the beast to shambles comes,
They louse their ^usk's on either cheek side,
By Tawing on each others thick hide,
So strength and vigor they both love,
Before the Neats head get a toss;
The one of them may love his Thraple;
Before the Bull begin to grapple;
So a third birckie often comes to,
And gets the whole with small ado,
Our Bishops mu^t be Potentats,
And Logic men turns Advocats,
Though ignorance sometimes may mar them,
They whiles get places better for them,
Lawers, Advocats and Clerks,
Are not so subject to Remarks
With Cour^ly Ladies in their Coaches,
Nor do incurr such hard reproaches;
Nor yet are so in p^oples mouth;
As these that should instruct the Youth;
But these who are long in abuse
And have drunk in some Childish use,
Are very fair to keep that stain,
Some Coward Coulie of this strain
Come moved by some Schoolish Toy
Ran Rampant on a Scholar Boy.
Did tear and grasp him with his claws,
For he had now laid by his Tawes
And gave him many a Souce and slope,
For some what did concern the Pope
Canonized at Edinburgh Cross*
In 80 as I do suppose.
Such Achillaean facts as their
Will tu^n a Master to a Sir;
But lest much speaking do me skaith,
I Will sit me down; and draw my breath,
When this was said, another start up*
Who for a while had not got hear^ up
But Melancholy, grief, and sturt,
Had over whelmed and done him hurt,
Men by his vi^ge understood,
That he was in a dumpish mood:
Sometimes he on his breast did clap,
Sometimes drew down his Satine cap:
Put back his hair out by his ears,
He was not far from shedding tears
In the Oppacity of grief
He cries what plots, O what Mischief!
And still a Ki^kman at the nuike o'^!
Though old Golboun should bear the buick o'^,
Then he began to muse and pause,
Like Pullet dropped from a Glades claws;
But having grief somewhat compessed,
Thus to the rest himself adressed;
Our Fathers, sirs, Civil and Ghastly;
Does traite us in a manner beastly,
If they respected us, our station
Our Flocks or their Edification
The ^est to us they would not tender,
And us mo^e Odious still render
Its known the bulk of all ^he Nation,
Are troubled at our ingr^ssion,
At our subjection to the Prelate, and other Tra^hrie might dolate.
Now we'll get naught but Rogue and knave*
If in this matter we behave
As some have done; yea they will e^eem
Us of all mankind the soul Fine
I hope the^e's none so void of sen^es?
To think w^'re framed to flatter Princes?
To foster pra^ks, and hellish plots,
And be admirers of fond ots
(...) serve men's lus^ the Pope and Devil,
Sure brethren, this proceeds of e^ill.
Tho it were amongst indifferent things,
Since such offense it with it brings;
We might refuse't with good defense,
Since we are obleidge'd in conscience,
Evill's appearance to evi^e,
Lest we cause weak ones loose their feet;
What ever frolicks men may foment,
Scandall's a matte^ of great moment:
Read Duram and Calvin well,
If from their reasons ^e resile:
I Will c^unt you Sots, or that you Knaverie
Will lead us back to Roman slav^ie.
When he these Honest Men had cited,
Some of the Clergy frown`d and fretted,
Some smil`d, and some fell in a laughter,
Some look`d like Butchers making slaughter,
Or like a Wife that does begin
To pull wool from a stinking skin;
Some fell a grunting like a Pig,
And some cry`d out, a Whig, a Whig!
But this commoved the Priests choler;
It did convert in ire his Dolor.
His Visage chang`d, he Fumes and Rages,
Like to a Suitzer wanting Wages;
Then in the Vinegar of Wrath
He briskly to his Bre^hren says,
Now Gentlemen, I know your meaning,
I know for what you are a Greening;
It`s Antichrist his Pipes and Fidles,
And other Tools, wherewith he Widdles,
Poor Cai^iffs into dark delusions,
Gross Ignorance and deep Confusions.
He`ll be repute a Man that cites
A Rabble of the Jesuits,
And Airie School men, but if we
Cite men Famous for Piety,
Their Learning, and for doing Good
Who in their ^ime firmly withstood
Both Error, Heresy and Schism;
It will be termed Phanaticisme:
I would with ^cripture clear the matter;
But to forebe^r I think it better:
It does not set a sound Divine,
To cast his Pearls before swine;
I have too solid Ground to fear,
You would it also mock and jear:
Tho at such pranks my hear^ does blead,
I`ll no more spu^t a Mare that`s dead.
He set him down and said no more,
Turn`d melancholious as before.
When he had said another rose,
A gay Divine as I suppose,
Who loved neither Monk nor Friar,
He bow`d first to the Cavalier;
And then he did himself Curvat,
To all the Brethren as they sat;
Then with a voice both whole and clear,
He thus broke Silence as you`s hear:
My Lord, and Brethren, I intend,
(...) a few words to comprehend,
What I`m to speak, give ear I pray,
That I to an Amen, may say,
^rethren, it seems this Test alleges,
That neither Covenanr obliges,
that they do not us ty or bind,
^o Duties that`s therein contain`d.
^ut I confess, I`m forc`d to grant,
^ud am confirm`d, the Covenant
Call`d National, in it naught has,
^ut what`s in this Symbol of Faith,
(...) Statutes made for its behove,
Which I`ll endeavor for to prove:
No sobet Man as I expect,
Can against any point object:
If it be not Mutual Supply,
In case that One or All should be
Oppressed for Religions sake:
And none can this Objection make*
Since it`s repute in this Confession,
A good Work to Repress Oppression:
And to defend the Innocent.
And such ate they who feel restraint*
Are Harassen and suffer Lesion,
Because of their entire Adhesion;
To Pure Worship, Doctrine sound,
And Discipline that has a Ground
On Scripture, all which we must grant,
To them who framed the Covenant:
Because they held the same with those,
Who this Confession did compose:
If any tatle the Old Tale,
Which with the simple may prevail;
To wit, we ought not to defend
Out Faith with Swords, I condescend;
And yet when I perpend the Matter,
Our Cause is not a whit the better.
For if you shall assault a Man,
Because he neither will not can
Quit his Religion, you compel
That person, to defend himself;
This without doubt the Law of Nature,
Does grant to every Humane Creature.
This none in Reason can restrict,
Because of persons that afflict.
Or their Prerogative; for why
It Is very easy to reply,
If we consider well the thing,
And trace this Defense to its Spring,
It Is seated in the Creature's Right,
Without considering the Wight
That does the Violence; and hence
We Lawfully may use Desence,
Against those that are in high Distractions*
Although their Violence and Actions,
If they be taken properly,
Cannot be called Injury;
From this precisely flows the other,
To wit, to help out sakeless Brother:
In whose Defense we ought to carry,
As in our own, and not to varry.
This Right cannot be Alienat,
And all rolled on the Magistrate.
Since all the Learned without Debate,
Says it is a Principle innate:
And does accompany Man's Nature,
Hoc ipso, that he is such a Creature:
Which Point if pithily discussed,
Will dash Hob`s policy to dust;
The Magistrate it a fit Mean
And Instrument for to maintain
This Right, by him the People may
Exerce the same, in a safe way.
But these things to the Whiggs I Will leave,
There Is somewhat more it is like may give
Ground for Objection, I will see,
If it has Pith or Energie.
It Is like some thinks the foresaid tie,
Does Prelates casting out imply:
We'll let it be so there is no skaith,
So does this Symbol of Faith.
Yea Gentlemen it would be found
A kittle put from the said Bond
To disprove Prelates, if it were
Not that it does Reinferre,
In terms this same Case and Condition,
The Church had under this Confession,
Before King James began to task us,
When he saw Altars at Damascus:
Lest any think there is no place
In this Symbol, can clear the Case;
Let such be pleased to make inspection,
Or eighteenth Article or Section,
Their Discipline as instituted,
By Holy Scripture, is Reputed,
One of the Churches Marks and Signs;
Then read but foreward two three lines,
Where the then Members do profess,
That the True Marks they do possess:
Now Gentlemen, consider that
Discipline duly Ministrat,
Must be by all, and only those,
On whom the Scriptute does impose
The same, and I trow Gentlemen,
No Prelat, no Person, or Dean,
Bruik'd Function when this Symbol was
Compiled, and brought to pass.
Neither did then our Church men with Court Sceptick Stilling Fleet.
If there be any more Objections,
Show them, I shall give my Reflections
On them; But if ye plainly see*
The foresaid Bond's Matter to be
In this Confession comprehended,
I think this Point is fully ended.
You see then Brethren, where we land,
If we this Test shall take in Hand.
I hope here is none who will cut Capers,
Like Torrys when South-Eastern Vapors,
Moments their Heads, who fall a roating,
Sacred and Humane Things devoting;
Trampling every thing that brings
Not Birth from interrupted Kings!
There Is none I hope will strive to mix
The Earth with Heavens, and World unfix;
Saying such Bonds wanting Supply,
Of Sovereign Authority,
Are rendered Irrite, by rescinding,
Which otherwise were sound and binding,
Or want of the Superiors Will,
Makes such Bonds, ipso jure, null:
Though that to which we do us bind,
Be Duty not to be Declined.
Or things indiff^rent, in no sort
Can do ^ur Neighbor Harm or Hurt*
If an^ Ki^kman be so gross,
He Will find that he in^urts a Loss,
The highest in^amy and shame
By reading Hea^hens, ^reats the Theme,
^vilians* and Cannonists;
Yea the m^st (...) o^ Romanists:
unto ^ith Acheron's Trained Bands,
Had ^carce (...) such a Wo^k in Hand^*
H^ no^ Spinosa, Hob's* and Parkers
(...) ^hese hellish Barkers,
^o give them help to ^rim such Wars,
And mak^ them (...) a^ Cou^-Fairs*
(...) this Scoup-hol^ with a flee,
O^ (...) part of a Kildee.
When speaking of this Covenant,
Which was confirmed by Pa^liament*
^om what is said it is apparent,
That (...) must be inherent
I^to ^he ^rch, since it is a Ma^k*
How Men may ken an Honest Kirk*
Which granted, can Government be
Affi^ ^o Regal Dig^itie?
I cannot see it, and think,
When I look it, I not wink*
Breth^en, there is some other Ground
Of s^uples, which I will profound*
Some G^ntlemen, that is apt to startle,
Some seem two Sentences to Tartle;
Contained in this Ancient Creed*
To wit, a Preter Scriptural Deed*
Is evil and that Romes Baptising,
B^ their Mass, Priest. Crossing and Greasing.
And Ordin^tion is stark naught
Since the Whoor ^o he^ hight was brought,
For me I do not think it fit*
On our Reformer's Face to spit;
Without a very p^essing Reason,
And this is ^ most dangerous season,
To drive out holes in our hedge dykes,
When Babel's Foxes, and such Tykes,
A^e endeavo^ring them to scale,
Yea rather to ding down the Wall.
Perpend but pray, what deeds we call,
Omnino preter scriptural?
It Is not such Acting that a Man
By solid Argumenting, can
Prove that the Scripture does permit,
Though there be ^o Command for it,
Precise, Precedent, or Example;
Of such Acts there are ^umbers ample:
As to make Pots of Earth and B^es*
And Tombs of Lead, or Marble S^ones,
To drink Brandie, or Usqueba^.
And Thatch with Heather, Broom* or Straw,
To smoke Tobacco, and make Suins,
And drink of Barlie, Pease or Bean^;
And s^ with Guns in stead of Bows,
And delve s^eep Bra^s with spades and howes.
To wear Drogits and thousands such,
That were not necessar to touch;
But Acts that neither from command,
Nor Precedent, can sit a stand,
Neither by sound Argumentation
From Scripture can have clea^ probation
To be permitted; These I shall
Call Acts that is Preter Scriptural,
And such are baptizing of Bells,
Hallowing Altars, Kirk and ^ells,
Torturing of the Penetent,
Refusing to eat Flesh in Lent:
Imposing Nook'd-Caps and Cowed* Heads,
The wearing Relicts, Cross, or Beads,
(To worship any of the three,
Is horrible Idolatry)
Convents of Nuns, Monks, and Friars,
And Surplices, which Curats wears;
For to impose gray Gowns, or Mantles,
Or any such base Tritle Trantles.
If what I say be understood,
The first Assertion will be good,
To these that are the Truth confessing,
In heart or I loss skill in guessing;
As for the second I Am content,
Before the black Council of Trent:
And ^'re Reformers did presume,
To warn poor Souls to flee from Rome,
That W^oorish Mother of Confusion,
And Noxio^s Nurse of Hells delusion.
E're Antichrist came to his height,
Romes Ordination might have weight;
But after Princedomes, States, and Nations,
Had com'd good length in Reformations,
After the Beast had sturr'd his Tail,
And set against them Tooth and Nail,
And roused the Empero^r and Kings,
And all under the Dragons wings,
To wedge a War against the Saints,
And to tread down the tender plants;
By which in formal Solemn manner,
He spread out Antichrist his Banner.
I must confess, I Am not so free,
To plead for the Validity
Of Roman Orders: It smells sower,
That Antichrist in his full power,
And formal War against the Just,
Should yet retain this Power and Trust.
Yea w^ighty Reasons me inclines,
To think some Eminent Divines,
Makes their Assertions here* to Thwart,
And one another Cheeks to scart;
In their asserting closs that he
Who keeps each Point of Papacy,
And so remains till Life be gone,
Shall never have Salvation.
And yet will not say to the f^ll*
Their Baptisms and Missions null*
I hope w^ shall not loose Instruction,
If I shall by a clear Induction
About this Argue, and shall seat
The Basis of the whole Debate.
Upon the general Consents
Of well Reformed Protestants;
To wit, that in the Papacy
As such complete, there cannot be
Salvation and my Assenting,
Will make Charity Relenting.
But my Iuduction I ll Exhibit,
Impugn it after cui libet.
Where no soul safty can be found,
No Faith can grow upon that Ground;
Where Faith cannot be, I am sure,
None hears the Truth that is Clean and Pure;
And where an Hearing cannot be,
There is no Real Ministry;
Where this cannot be, there is no Mission,
So no such Power in their Possession,
Now having ended, I will come,
A Primo, to the Ultimum.
In Rome as such, there is no Salvation;
And so no Power of Ordination;
But pray you, take my Tale together.
And rive not one Limb from another.
Either subvert my Broad Foundation,
Or suffer my Argumentation
To stand, lest striving it to trouble,
Ye Mire into a Hubble Bubble.
But Brethren, what if one should say,
Tho Romes Missions in Genere,
Have strength and be acknowledged rate,
Yet they might be invalidate,
Within a Churches Jurisdiction,
The Church having made a Resection,
In general, of any Power
Conferred by that Pestsome Whore:
On any Man within their Border,
Sure all that loves Peace and Order,
Will grant the Church has power to Tax
Church Officers, for foulsome Facts;
For their unfitness want of Care,
Or going to a Romag Fair,
To buy a Mession and Reeal,
Their Ordination, if it shall
Be found Convenient, pray you, why
Should Men unto the Church deny?
In bulk for to make null Men's Missions?
On weighty Causes, and Conditions?
But here Objections and Replies,
And Intricacies might arise:
I`ll close, and will not search into
Church Power, and what a Church can do;
When well informed in their Directions,
And Acts against future Defections,
What they may clear evacuate,
And what they might Exterminate
From them, and their Posterity,
Then having made a Courtesy,
With all due Rites, in such a Case,
He set him down, and held his Peace.
Then rose a Priest both brisk and bold,
He was both sturdy, tight and Tall,
He roul'd his Visage round about
As he had risen necks to clout:
He was so blosie some did think
That he had got his Morning drink.
He threw a gruntle, hands did fold,
Sometimes on his Kanes head took hold.
His clowdly brows, and frizled hair,
Did tell he was thuart cross grained ware
He looked just like such as we,
Say is for the cheek of a Plea,
Or like a fellow, to be brief,
Into whose hands there is a mischief;
He was not for the French Nig nayes,
But briskly to his Brethren says,
Good Gentlemen we may not doubt,
Wherefore the Duke of York's left out,
And is exempted from the Test,
Wherewith he does turmoyl the rest;
In public Trust, in Church and State,
Menacing some at a great rate,
This is a very shrewd beginning,
I think I know what was the meaning,
He thinks not fit to flench and flatter,
But to prove gallant in the matter.
And when he his designs commences,
Rears up Romes Kennels, yairds and fences.
We shall not have the tale to cant,
Take up your King and Covenant*
A man of Sprit might Burn for Shame,
That Scotland thus should lose its Fame.
But Gentlemen, when I do Read
This our Reformers Ancient Creed,
I do perceive in several parts,
It very Pithily Asserts.
Professed Catholics to be
Guilty of Gross Idolatry,
And Blasphemies, why are not all
Such gross Delinquents great and small
Called to Account, and when convicted
Made beat the pains should be Inflicted
On such Trassgressors, I confess
Men that are Men could do no less.
But we are troubled with a Pack
Who truth and justice do Ransack.
Devour their Brethren that are tender,
Kill some, makes others lurk and wander
In Dens and Deserts with pale Faces,
Feu Sympathising with their Cases:
And so make us that are Conformed,
Stink in the nose of all Reformed;
And here are several sitting, that
Have their part largely in the Pot.
A pack of Rogues I Am a swidder
To dash some heads against each other
Tho some's Exempted from the Test,
They Are not Exempted from the Rest,
Of penal statutes (who ere saw
A Subject placed above the Law)
Which rightly weigh^d and put in use,
Might yet cause some to shoot the buise.
Should we receive the Noxious Humors,
That raised Gangrens, Pox* and Tumors:
And at the length by strong Pu^gation,
Evacuat by the English Nation.
A ^out upon us a Disgrace,
Let Us fling their Dirt back on their Face:
I had said -- had not my senses
Been clogg`d with Pestsome Effluences,
Of their Chymerick Naughty Talkers,
They smell like workhouses of Wakers*
Of Test and of the Test Defenders,
It`s wonder Brethren no Man renders*
But I presume, I keen the Case,
This ha^ been made a Hally Pla^e.
By the hot Water of Saint Gile^,
Or some Old Saints bruik`d their Fields.
I^ was no wonder some inquired,
(A flenting Fellow who desir`d
To rouse the Te^) whither it was
Unto the Heav`ns the hig^ plain pass?
He answered, it`s the high street,
They swore that he was indi^creet,
For to exclude His majesty,
Together with His Family;
Although the Cavali^r sat dume,
It`s very like, by other some,
Fuisset dictum ei quere^ti,
Non fit injuria volen^i*
^us ^omake wambles, I must close,
And with my Fist must ^op my Nose.
Another rose, made his Congees,
And said, my Bre^hren, if you please,
Hear out my Tale, it`s be ^ut shot,
And half in carnest, ha^f in sport.
^ome States a^e plagu`d with Snakes and Frog^,
And other Kingdoms with Mad Dogs.
Which cause a Hydrophobia,
And others with Tarantulia,
Some with Lions, some with Bears,
And W^lves, which Flock and Cattle tears,
Some with Monkies and Babouns,
Thought Rareties within our Towns.
Some with the Cruel Croeodile,
Who catch Men in their linked Tail.
Some with Grasshoppers and with Flees,
And some with Worms that hurt Fruit Trees:
Some with Locusts, some with Adders,
Some with filthy Toads and Spidders.
Some are abus`d with stinking Bro^ks,
The Weasel, Fumart, and the Fox.
Some are hurt with ^ocks of Crows,
Devouring Corn and their Lint Bows.
Some with Earns* some with Eagles,
Which the Young Sheep and Goa^s sore mangles*
Some with Pant^ers, some with Tigers,
Some with Monsters of strange Figures.
Some with Water Rats and Mice,
And others with the C^cratrice,
Which as some says, smi^es with its looks*
But Scotland^ plague`s a plague of Dukes:
But they`re such Dukes as soon do tire,
To plash together in one Mire,
And so the One the Other out pakes,
Which makes Men think they`re all but Drak
Yet this makes many Men admire,
For pa^eing time and all the year.
Is one to them they never lein,
(...) and Hay time they`re as keen,
In their D^bating as it were,
After the last of Ja^uare.
I know naught like them but the Frogs,
Who do haunt Marshes and Bogs.
It`s said by some the Younger Rides
Above the Older`s slimi^ sides
Till they loss breath, or else their Number
Would do the Country meikle cumber.
I`ll say no more, but prays for Peace,
I`ll quite m^ ^kill if some do Grace.
But now upstart the Cavalier,
He could no longer speech forebear;
Their knaggie ^alking did up barme him,
Their sharp R^flections did much warm him,
His Blood having a high F^rment,
By hot Spirituous (...):
Of which he made no small Voration,
Nor seldom to inebr^ation!
For Venus fails and will decay,
Sine Ba^ho and C^rere.
^e bended up his B^zzards Nose,
which was far Redder than a Rose.
^e did unfold no little Pride,
^e set his Left Hand on his side:
^ike (...) Soldiers when they stand
(...) Ordered Arms, waiting Command;
and then he brought his Right Leg foremos^,
^s he had been to make a sore Thrust,
^linting and squinting with his Eyes,
^ike those who uses falsifies:
which sort of Motions he did make,
(...) furry all the time he spoke,
^ith many a lofty boult and bend,
(...) says my Friends and Gentlemen,
^t several Meetings I have been,
and heard you ^urmur and complain
^f Narrow Stipends, Manse and Gleib^,
and Patrons taking Bods and Bribes,
and making you by secret Pactions,
(...) of sacrilegious Actions,
^fore they suffer you to enter;
^here`s the Fanatic and Dissenter;
^here`s now your fear of new Whigg Plots,
which other times came up your Throats:
^all the Talkings were collected,
which from your Thraples ^e ejected,
(...) former Meetings, I have Ground,
^o say not so much should be found,
(...) Tende^ Consciences and Truth,
(...) this time has flown from your Mouth.
Good fellows pray what may we judge,
Of so surpri^ng a Deludge
O^ Conscience. I take it to be
The Birth of some Conspiracy:
What do you mean, some Innovation,
Or some new Clergies Convocation:
Do you intend to bell the Pus,
With King, Duke, Parliament, and Us*
I will not stay to Clash and Quibbl^
About your Nignayes, I`ll not nibble:
I`ll with a ba^e word you Redargue,
Tho till your wind Pipes burst you argue.
Though ye should cry and shout about me,
Till all the Guts within should ou^ flee.
Pray your All^dgance but consider,
And gather all your Wits together,
Consider who`s the Churches Head,
And at your Leisure, pray you read
Your Oath, and Explicating Act,
And all you say`s not worth a plack:
If you the Matter rightly weigh,
You`ll find it is the King's to see,
What is Con^enient and Right
In Church Af^airs; The oversight,
And sole Power of Determination
Is his, and all`s by Derivation
That we can claim; know what you`re doin^
Le^ there may be untimeous rueing.
Be sober for we will you danton,
(...) at the pre^ent hot and wanton:
A^ empty Pantrie, and ^oom Pots,
Will make you look like half drowned Roats*
^ook on good Fellows and advise it,
Warr`s sweet to them who never ^ryes i^.
He said no more but set him down,
Then some began to hark and rown:
^omes heart began to ^aint and fail,
^o think that Cabbage, Beef, and Ale,
Mutton, and Capon should be wanting,
^uch thoughts made some ^o ^all a gaunting*
Some to what hand to turn was deeming,
And some did look, like those that`s dreaming.
^ome (...) concluding we must do it*
There`s no help; we will be put to it.
^ome their hair from their beards plucked*
And some did claw where nothing yooked.
^ome said a secree^ Pater Noster,
And some were in a Laughing Poster,
^ome began to Jock and Gibe,
others were cursi^g the whole Tribe
^f these, who made such ^ellish act*
To put Men`s Conscience on racks,
Others prepared to appear,
and Rancounter the Cavalier.
^ow by the way I must beg leive,
(...) brief Character for to give,
^f this brave Fellow spoke so home,
and to the Point so clos^ did come*
Which in few Words I think I can,
He was a Courtly ^lergie Man:
Which taken in it`s Latitude,
Does all that I can say include.
It`s true I dare not be precise,
To say, he all the Properties
Has of a Courtier; that't a Taill
Too long for Jo^n of Laud^rdail:
Which if he had, it`s like he might,
Play to the Tikes some Foxes slight,
By taking it betwixt his feet,
And with hot water making`t wet*
And when the Tikes were near to hold'im,
Might with a whisk almost blindfold`um:
Although the Cavalier does want
Some Properties, yet I must grant,
Considering this present ^ime,
He has some that are Tight and Prime:
For Champion Conscience none will bate him,
For Flattery t^ere`s few will mate him
Of Power Supe^iour, and forsooth,
He has a Tongue that`s gay and smooth:
He ha^h some art to tincture Vice,
And to sell Hemlock seed for Spice.
To ^et Court Sadles on skeigh Nages;
And help to back unruly Stages.
To strowe Beans on his Neighbors stairs,
And trouble other Men`s Affairs.
And to set Prospects to some Eyes,
Who cannot well discern a prise*
Tho he can swear from side to side,
And lie, I think he cannot hide.
He has been several times affronted
By sly Backspearers, and accounted
An empty Rogue; They are not fit
^or Stealth, that want a good Up* put*
But now a Priest rose to withstand him,
Who well knew where his own shoe band him,
And said, your Lordship I commend,
You take your Tale by the Right End.
I must confess, the Matter's here,
Here is the thing that nicks us near.
I know there may be something said,
That when this Alleadgeance was made,
We thought the King would not assert
To him more Power than was his part.
And that he all our Grants would bring
Square to the Nature of the thing.
Our Loyalty was so profuse,
Nothing he ask`d we did refuse.
Crediting Truth and every thing
To the Benigneness of a King,
Looking he would not spoil us straight,
Of that to which we had a Right.
By Apostolic Institution,
Who would have thought on such Confusion,
Of Air and Water, Heav`ns and Earth,
Bringing the World to it`s first Birth.
The Ancient Chaos wanting figure,
Who could expect so strange a Rigor.
Yea several Acts of Parliament,
Might have occasion^d our Consent,
Framed in favors as you`ll see,
Of Churches Right and Liberty:
But truly when I d^ perpend
The Matter to the nether end,
I must confess, this fair like sconce,
Gives little Shelter, Help, or Sonce:
Tho I were hasting to the Mooles,
I`ll say some knaves were, some were fools,
And some were both thus, let it stand,
That ^cots* men`s wise behind the hand.
But when you argue to the ou^most,
In Truth your Arguments are but dust;
Though Terms to which we have consented
Makes us sit dumb, and I repent it:
Your Argumentings all do hang
On Hobbs, and Others of that gang;
So you rub alse much of the Blutter
Of the Augeian stall and gutter,
On your own Cheeks as you do sting,
On these who will not you Note sing.
And more Sir, they`re accounted Babies,
By solid Men, and Learned Rabbis,
Whose Sentiments are all supported
By Reasons, may be well r^torted.
For g^ant Power absolute to Princes,
Pray from what ground shall your Defenses
Flow nea^ly out, and solid be,
Against the Pope`s Sup^emacie.
Let us go to the King, for sight
Of what`s conform to Truth and Right.
What Actings fair are, what are foul,
The King`s to us the higher Rule
Than Sacred Write. Whither ye lean you,
The Pope with your own Arms will ^tain you.
If you say there are Contradictions
In several Popes, their Noddle Fictions,
Against ushe cuts that same Caper,
Founded on word of mouth and paper.
They`re fals^oods now that once were Truth,
By Father CHARLES`s dying mouth:
But I think some will grant each such thing,
When once it comes to go or touching;
But Clergy Men may knock at Hell`s gate,
And yet return, this is fell fa^e.
For me I do not love such ch^ps*
Or in a Pulpit to kiss knops.
Be pleased, Sir on it to think,
Ye shall not all of us hood-wink:
I`ll say no more lest I should make
Things rather worse, and lose my talk.
Upstart another with a smile,
And said, my Lord* shall all your while
Be spent in idle clitter clatter,
And waving fingers in the water.
This work at present will not wo^k,
As long's these Lowns gets leave to lurk*
In their fat Man^es naught prevails,
They stair on you, and tell old Tales.
To say`t my Lord, ^ will not spare
The fault is in the Country Air,
That so constringeth our wind pipes,
Our W^asands, Stomachs, and small Tripes,
That we can scarce get ought ov`r put,
That`s any greater nor a Nut.
Yea there are some Men that do feel,
Great stress in swallowing a Pill.
Yea some will spue and bock and spit
At moats like to a Midge`s foot.
We scunner at most part of meat,
Which we`re not used for to e^t.
Hence few of us can eat Swine`s flesh,
Let it be ree^ed salt or fresh.
Their Gentlemen have Weasands narrow,
That makes them tartle flinch and tarrow:
A Medicine I will prescrive,
And paun my Thraple it shall thrive.
Send them a while to other Nations,
Whence their Veins may have Dilatations:
When they return, they`ll you request
To have the favor of the Test,
They are not few Experiments,
To prove the Point, but one presents
It self at present, which I^ll relate,
And put the matter beyond debate.
A Man of narrow Conscience,
A while ago went over to France,
It`s well known what was the Occasion,
He could not take the Declaration.
When he returned he got it ov`r
Without a Host, a Bock, or Glour.
And when this Test came first a thort,
Any that saw this strange Deport,
Perceived his Maw to Hink and Jarr,
He went Abroad, but not so far.
If this last part want verity, I Am wrong informed, pardon me.
As soon as London Air he got,
It slipped like Oysters ov`r his Throat;
He said no more b^t down did get,
And Keckled at his own Conceit.
With this rose up a good old Cannie*
A pluffie cheek`d red Bearded Mannie.
Who all this time had taken ease,
And fostred Lavrocks, Doves, and Bees,
To keep him Company at home,
For seldom he abroad did come.
He st^oakes his Beard, and rubs his Chin,
And claws his Luggs, then did begin;
It is a good old ^onsie saying,
That little Wit makes meikle straying;
If we had made our Judgments lurk,
Till once we`d seen how things would work,
We should ^ave met with little more
Of foul Reproaches than before;
But we fo^sooth must fyke and fling,
And make our Pulpits sound and ring
With bulkie words, against the Test,
And now we see the day I guest.
I^ was great has^e, but where your Sp^ed,
Your buying Wi^, that`s dear indeed.
We might have mist a beastly blunner,
Had we not spewed out our skunner,
Against this Test, in every where,
As Antichristian hellish wa^e.
If now our fame be (...),
We worse than Devils will be repute.
I count their wits not worth a Hare^s dung,
That have not learned to keep a fair tongue.
I must confess, the Contradict
Gave my old frozen heart a nict,
That did its motion so extend,
That its pyramide neither end
First banged my breast, and then my back,
I Am sure it bade not such a rack,
These twice ten Years, if it was not,
When I thought Whiggs should cut our Throa^
Although they did not u^e such deeds,
You know the guilty still mi^dreads.
But e're ye cast me out from yonder,
Fat Man^e and Gleib, I Will further ponde^
The ^est. When Men can get no Right,
They Are forced to use some bitts of ^light:
Let Us chew it over like a figg,
And in their pocket break an egg:
Like to Turn* coats who in short,
Can swallow all that comes a thort:
But this he uttered, not for fear,
But laughed it in his Gossips Ear*
Who being one of that same gang,
Says better goss than steall and hang.
I^ we with Manse and Gleib be twined,
I swear I know no Trade behind.
A stipend is not on each bank,
It Is good to keep in hand an hank.
Up rose a Priest to tell his Tale,
Whom some thought dizzi^ with strong Ale.
Some thought he had his brains oppressed,
By striving to connect the Test.
Some thought that he was at a loss,
By too much striving it to cross.
Some thought he looked like those that spent
Betwixt a Conscience and Church Rent.
Some did allege it was the Moon,
That did his Vitals ^o mistune.
Some who perceived his puls^ to quive,
Alleged that he was in a Fever.
The Torrie ^lergie Men professed,
It was the Nature of the Beast.
Whatever it was, it does appear,
His Intellectuals were not clear.
He moved his shoulders, he^d did ^ling,
From Van to Rear, from wing to wing.
Some were alleging, that had good skill,
He could not speak i^ he had stood still.
Like some School Boy, their Lessons saying,
Who rocks like Fiddlers a playing.
Like Gilbert Burnet when he Preaches,
Or like ^ome Lawyers making Sp^eches;
He making Hands; and Gown, and sleives wavel,
Half singing ven^s this Reavel Ravel.
I have been hearing ma^y things,
Of Kings, of Clerkie, and Designs;
My memory is very skant,
Some Words I have, some words I want.)
Of Popes Supremacy and Whiggs,
Of cutti^g Capers and Intrigues,
(Sirs, my Reflecting is but bad,
I Am sure I Will pair, it is like I Will add)
Of Covenants, and Ancient Creeds,
Monks, and of Preter Scriptural Deeds,
Of Test, and those that do it ^oster,
And of a secret Pater Noster*
The Test was formed, in my Opinion,
To make Division, and yet Union;
To make a clear Distinction,
Of these have Truth, and these have none:
It Is like the strange Connex did come,
Not without Ignorance in some;
Though sight and policy did faill,
Yet force is like to drive the Nail.
Prejudicat and greedy Judges,
Make Men seek desperate Refuges.
(Sometime the Hare has Ground to flee,
Le^t her Luggs, Horns should counted be.)
Or Jaws must be of full Extent,
For the je^ black Council of Trent*
Who speaks of Helps and Explications,
Rears up but slymie Machinations.
I^ Memory do not miscarry,
Before the first of January;
We must sub^crive, and March comes in
Before the Parliament begin;
Hence I infer, though I Am no Plotter,
No Help nor Gloss can weigh a snotter.
I trow we would be in a strait,
To know what Heads should be delate.
Tho we should now the thing consider,
And close the Point without a ^widder:
Some slay Objector might arise,
And make us take a new Advise.
Some's for the Top, some's for the Tail*
And others would reform the Hail,
Some are for bitts often here and there,
And some cries over with it hove and hair.
Some's for it as it does consist,
And so's for any end they list:
But keep in this, and put out that,
And so we swear we wot not what:
But will you stowe me frae the Rump,
Deferr the taking of the Lump,
Until the Parliament explain it*
And then it is like I will be sai^ often.
Tho our great Court when it does gather,
Should cut away the foul taire Leather,
That does impede Inte^pretation,
Men and confirm this Explication,
(For as it stands it has no Mence,
It being contraire common Sense.)
Yet let the present swearing Tru^tees,
Know they give Conscience Cowper Justice.
And by subscribing it in gross
Renounces every solid gloss:
And this I offer to mantain
Against all the Clerks in Aberdeen.
Who with such trash would be content,
Makes King and Counsel Parliament;
And if my Judgment be not scant,
Some Lybel will be relevant,
And all the Process firm and fast,
To give the Counsel Jedburgh east*
Its no discre^tive Explication,
That Is ^ram'd to warrant a whole Nation.
Who ever gets this Test down swallowed,
May let the Levia^an ^ollow't.
Tyrants the Alc^ran may improve,
Far better for their own behove.
Than Popery look on Cham or Turk,
Yet France makes Popery strangely work.
But I would have you understand,
Each Tyrant is not Lewis le Grand.
I do not doubt a person dreads,
When the mantainer of old feads,
Have vote and do sit on their size,
All whom the Lawyers do advise,
Gets not off Sca^ free, but are fain
To take some other shift or train.
Some Highland Ralphs, and Muirland Jannets,
Says there are showers falls out in Planets,
Some showers with dew the mountains fills,
And causes Roses grow on Hills.
And Strawberries on Banks of Sands,
Some may make Argillaceous Lands.
Bring forth good store of hearty grain,
And make the Country laugh again.
Such things have been, and may be yet,
Fools and proud men had need of wit*
And Curats had need to preach well,
For there are very few tha^ feel
Instruction and Edification,
By our Lives and Conversation.
Let Us swear impossibilies,
And then our Truths will be thought Lies*
The cursed Jeroboams Priests
Performed their Worship before beasts:
But we somes Priest must with our mouth
Evert the very ground of Truth.
Pack Holy Write and Sacred Critics
^um Theologico Politics.
And Cook had need of cleanly fingers,
And Dukes of Iu^ie strong purse hingers,
And dull brained head pieces that swears
They Will not import prohibit wares.
Had need of other Trades to s^ick to,
Their's are possessed pro de relicto.
Though some be old and dull of learning,
They may attain the trade of swearing;
So much in fashion at this season,
^sham plo^ and putative Treason.
And Whiggs had need to learn to think,
They sleep not all that seem to wink.
It Is folly with Kail Wives to flyte,
Some Dogs ba^k best after they b^te.
Some sna^ch the Heels and Tail about,
And so get all their Harns dung out
A well trained Royster fast will close,
His Jaws upon a mad Bull's Nose.
Some Cowlies murders more with words,
Than Trowpers do with Guns and Swords.
The sore brunt Client makes Complaint,
Of those Pick pockets with consent,
Calling^um more* exhausting Thieves,
Th^n Highway men that stealls and reaves.
Lawyers, Advocats, and Clerks,
May give their Thoughts, and their Remarks,
On Laws, who ever to this hour
Gave them a Legislative Power.
Enough of this, therefore I Will had,
Lest all the Polland Dogs go mad,
Before their wonted time of Year,
When such poor Cowish S^ust they hear.
Juries should know how Matters stands,
Lest they with Pilate wash their hands.
Pomantick fellows should not be
Advanced to too much Dignity.
Some places Celia in a shrine,
And she for that makes them be seen
With brows adorned wit^ long dilemmas,
Which some repute no pleasant gemmas.
It Is like some think another thing,
If they be gif^ed by a King.
^y horned Logicks I conclud^
And very Pithily make good
That those who for the Test give votes
Are very Ignorants and So^s.
Either they this confession knew
Or not. And if the first be true
They Are men of round spu^ noddle fictio^
Who understood not contradictions:
But if the second must hold foot
I will aff^ they are ^kant of wit
Who in a Supreme Court like that
Will ^umph and vote they wot not (...)
These Horns pricks pi^hily the side^
Of Ghostly Fathers our Church guides
Bu^ like these Sain^s are in a (...)
Unto the mother of (...)*
Without demur^ing I will say it
They are for order peace and quie^;
Who (...) would be content
With a (...) Form in Parliament,
The matters clear, no more deb^e
A vote (...) all, a speech in S^ate.
There are some persons I su^one,
Would swime with all but sink with none.
Who darres to trust such snakeing slave^,
Are greater fools the^ they are knaves*
Some may be courted for a while
Whom yet the Gallows may beguile*
Corrupters have ground to suspect
Corrupted persons and their neck
Is very fair to bide a stresse
When they have done their business.
They Will bury us when we are dead,
Without a stipend at our head.
My talking wants top, main and tail,
And my Concep ives seem to fail.
These have scarce Time and little Reason,
Would see they do not p^atle Treason*
He set him down, the Sophee rose
With face so fiery, that his Nose
Might have endangered Corn stacks*
And fired Powder, Lint or Flax.
And cries, Good Fellows ye may ken, that
Quos Jupiter perdit dementat.
He set him down. And so I end,
Whom I have wronged let others men^*
If any ask for the Conclusion,
Let them conclude it was Confusion.
Although there wants not Inquisition,
If other Kirkmen did petition;
Whether they be exempt by paction*
By secret emption or transaction*
Or if there is powder at its root,
I choose at present to be mute.
If Circumstances call to clear it*
Its like hereafter you may hear it*
Follows the Tenor of the Oath of the TEST To be taken by all Persons in
Public TRUST.
I A. B. Solemnly Swear in Presence of the Eternal GOD, Whom I invocat as Judge

help me GOD.

VERSES made upon the Death of that famous Gospel Minister, Mr. ROBERT M KW
AIRD. Who died in Holland, after 18 years Banishment from Scotland, his Native
Country.
WAS it for naught that blustering sparkling Rays
Of strange stupendous Comets, did the eyes
Of Earths Inhabitants, so long detain,
In days but lately past? who can refrain,
(Considering our stroke so great, so sad
Heightn`d with Circumstances dark and bad,)
From saying, sure these Portants did presage,
Some future Tragidie, to this poor Age,
Which new`s begun, so shrewdly for to think,
On what may follow, may make Spirits shrink,
In drou^e grief, and sorrow since he`s gone,
Who with a Spirit, Seraphick, his allone
Resisted Truths Opposers, who did stand,
Throwing their Darts at him at every hand;
Yet not allone, for the great Sovereign,
The King of Kings, whose Glorious splendent Train,
Did fill the Temple, was his strength and stay,
In whom he Lived; in whom he clos`d his day,
With whom he now Triumphs, with whom he sings,
The Lambs and Moses song, he drinks the Springs
Of Joy and Consolation in a kind,
Not heard nor seen, nor entered in the mind
Of Mortals to conceive, while now above,
In full Fruition, of that Matchless Love:
Tho he Triumphs, yet we may mourn and Weep,
Since in such Cloudie days is fallen a sleep,
So great a Seer, such a shining light,
Whereby our day is almost turn`d to night;
For Truth a Champion both by Tongue and Pen,
Regardless of the wrath and rage of Men.
What Pen can write, or what Tongue can express,
His Choicest parts, his worth, his usefulness?
Some praise the Liberal Soul, ^aud some do prize
The mind that is steadfast, others magnisies
The Tongue that`s eloquent, others admire,
A breast not subject to, nor touched with fear,
Some praise the learn`d; some think the prudent be,
Above the Common fate and destiny,
Of other mortals, some takes the devote,
For persons Blessed in their hardest Lot,
For Poesy some have a Veneration,
With some the Sedulous in their Vocation,
Are in esteem, how to be praised is he,
In whom these Virtues in a high degree
Did burn and Blaze? Let all who do esteem
These Choicest Virtues, of a Heavenly strain,
Come join and mourn with me, O let them come,
And help me to express, or sitting dumb,
In Melancholious muteness, and in Tears.
Regrait our present loss, and ground offears;
He did Survive the rest of these great lights,
Discharged their native Lands by cursed Wights,
Which makes our stroke, more misty, sad and dim,
For while he liv`d, they seem`d to live in him,
As if the rest, who did before ascend,
In loves thrice burning Chariot to attend,
Their high and lofty One, their Mantles dropped,
And he the same receiv`d, where with he stopped
Defections current, he himself on dry,
And solid ground went to Eternity.
Yet e`re he went prepar`d to leave behind,
Such Fragrant Writings from his candid mind,
Such strengths and Bulwarks for the Truth that he,
Thereby remains to teach posterity,
His famous works, serves to transmit his Fame,
From Age to Age, and Eternize his Name,
Some few Lines composed by him for Divertisement, from Melancholic Thoughts,
when traveling abroad.
To the Tune of, Fancy free.
Over Hills, over Mountains, sc^ogie woods
Over Heaths o`re Deserts dry,
O^re dusky Marshes and Floods, where Tritons Company
So wantonly skipt here and there, within these ^aterie Vawes,
Un^anton`d by that ca^cking care which Human Wights inslaves.
(2)
O`re stony hights, o`re champine ground where Ceres bows her head,
O`re ragged Rocks where Echoes sound and bearded people feed,
O`re walled Cities. frightsome forts, o`re waterie sinking sands,
Retrenched Villages and Boges where Neptouns Castle stands.
(3)
Through wounding woods of glistering spears, prepared for Humane Death,
Through sudden Showers of leaden Spears, that quickly cut the breath,
Through armed troops, where horses prance, as if they would incite,
Their roaring Riders to advance their Counter part to meet.
(4)
Where Trumpets sound and Drums do beat, as in a solemn way,
They were ordain`d of Sovereign fate, a Triumph to convey;
Great Souls of Heroes as they fly at wounds of Bteast and Brain
And then bass forth their Elogie iu mournful groaning strain.
(5)
5 Through Razing rage of cursed Kings whom vicious Souls admire;
Through unjust sentences which springs from avarice or fear,
Or some such like infernal cause hence guiltless people quake,
Before his face, whose Sword, whose Laws, should their opposers shake.
(6)
6 Through fiery Fevers wasting Wounds through Melancholious want;
Through sad disastures which abound to such as long and pant;
Even for true virtue, which sure the weakly spirit faints,
Who forced troubles to Endure must die in discontent.
Through Calumnies through frauds and slights that moves mortals mind;
Through slandering tongues of bruttish wights to pevishness inclin`d:
They must adventure who intends in Virtues camp to war,
Abhoring mean penurious ends that brave exploits do mar.
(8)
If when travers`d by all such fates honor and virtue be,
Both proof against Enchanting bates: and frowning destiny
A Soul may have a sure solace when stormed on every side.
And look proud Tyrants in the sace with scorn to be dismay`d.
(9)
Contentment with a present case to praise I`le not forbear,
Sure it deserves the highest place amongst these virtues rare,
By Heathen people so much sought but never yet obtain`d,
Its Heaven`s great gift, not to be bought nor by Industry gain`d.
Some Lines made by him upon the Observation of the Vanity of Worldly Honors,
after he had been at several Princes Courts
To the Tune of Come let us walk and veiw the Spring.
HOw mean a thing is it to stay,
On praising Emperors of Clay;
While He who being Life and Breath
To every Mortal granted has,
Does us invite to Praise and Sing
The Trophies of his Glorious Reign.
Hosts of strong Angels to express,
His pow`r and perfect Blessedness,
Their spacious thoughts extended have,
Since Times first morning, yet perceive
Their notes so low, they shade with Wings
Their blushing Countenance and Sings.
Heaven, Earth, and all that in them is,
Eehoes their notes, and adds this,
We't but thin shaddows of that light,
That Wisdom, Goodness, Truth and Might,
Which from noughts Bowels us Extracted,
By which we`re ordered and acted.
The whole Creation does accord,
To Adam`s Sons, they will afford,
Constraining matters to concert,
With them for acting of a part
That so conjoined, with those above,
They may advance in light and Love.
The splended Sun by subtle Rays,
Preaches his Glory to our eyes,
The Seas, and Thunder do declare,
His Might and tertour to the ear,
His Milk, and Honey, Corn, and Wine,
Taste of a Goodness that`s Divine.
In Heats we feel, his Cooling Gales,
His Florid fields of Bounty smells,
He sends his Ministering Spirits*
Who Man protects* Instructs, incites,
In their blessed Chore, to take a place,
And sing albeit, a Feeble bass.
In Heavenly state from Sinai Hill,
He published his Sacred will,
His Fiery Throne surrounded with Thunder,
And smokie Oceans, caused such wonder,
And fright, that those conveened to hear it,
Had Souls too limited to bear it.
His shadow on meek Moses Face,
Did more than dazzle Jacob's Race.
Which Vail`d, he did them declare,
GOD`s will in sounds, which they might bear,
And did in Aarons hands Consign,
Books of the manner of his Reign.
Omnipotence, could not sp ak low
Enough, to make blind Mortals know,
Much of himself, even Mojes eye,
Though strong, his Glory would not see,
His Trembling ear heard him proclaim,
The high Abridgement of his Name.
By all we`re forced to conclude,
He Is Wisdom* Strength, He`s Just and Good,
But when we fixedly Consider,
How to bring Heaven and Earth together,
Wrapped in a Vail of Ahram's seed,
GOD came himself, and Crushed their feed.
The first advances disappear,
Angels blessed spirits, and Saints draw near,
In through that Vail, the place to enter,
Where Holiness and Glory Center,
Where Seraphims themselves see more,
Of his blessed nature them before,
But here its fit, I hide my Face,
I stop my mouth, and pant for Grace,
With Adoration to admire,
Until he wholly me retire,
Where Elect Souls, and Angels strong,
Consoris the Lambs and Moses long.
An Answer to a Letter, from a Soldier Comerad, while in the Camp.
I have Received thy Line, thy Heart
With a thrice sad adieu*
Which so my Marble Breast did smart,
That makes me to avow:
Tho hard it be in Friendship true
And still Resolve^ to be,
That hates to lose but still Renew
Especially with thee.
Thy Heart of Gold I do append,
To this my Marble Breast,
There to Remain, till Death shall send
It`s Breathing to arrest;
T^en I Am content that she or he,
That shall the same ^nloose,
In this suc^eed to me and thee,
I^ Heart and Br^asts dispose.
But since these Fates thou`rt mind to try,
In Sympathy with thee;
These several ri^ks, I`m mind to run;
But sure our Company
Would help full sweet and grateful ^e;
These leaden showers before,
But let`s not blame out Destiny,
But rather hope the more.
Our meeting, I do not Despair,
But till it chance to come,
No other Music I will care,
But shot and tuck of Drum.
My ^eeble Meeter up I`le sum;
No muse I`le more implore,
But rather wish they may sing dumb,
And hear the Cannon Roar,
No Venus smile, notwinkling eyes,
No specious Graceful port,
Which we^kly mortals of^ surprise,
Shall Lines from me extort*
I`le me dem^ne in such a sort,
That naught but Languid Prose,
My Souls i^tentions shall Report,
Thrice thrice adieu I close*
The Popish Party, after the defeat of Monmouth and Argyle: published an
Insulting Ballad, To the Tune of, Hey Boys up go we, which coming to the hands
of Leiutenant Col: Cleland, ^e made the second part, t^ the same Tune and
Strain, holding forth the Language of their ^ayes. Anno 1685.
NOW down with the Confounded Whiggs let Loyalty take place:
Let Hell possess their Damn`d intrigues,
and all that cursed Race;
Let Oaths abound, and Cups go round* and Whoores and Rogues go free,
And Heaven it Self ^toop to the Crown. For Hey Boys up go We.
Come, let us Drink a Health about, unto our Holy Father,
His sacred Maxims without Do^bt, we will Embrace the rather
Because they are fram`d with Wit and Sense and favors Monarchy,
And can with all ou^ Sins Dispense: so Hey Boys up go we.
There we shall Ramble at our case, and still enjoy the best,
And all our wild affections please in a Religi^us Vest;
And yet keep Heaven at our Dispose, if such a t^ing there be;
And D^ag the people by the Nose, so Hey Boys up go we.
Our M^nastries, they will provide, and store above all Measure,
And spacious Nun^eries beside, where we may take our pleasure.
The English Ladi^s when ^hey ^ind restraint in Liberty,
Will prove to us Excessive kind, s^ H^ Boys up g^ we.
There`s some who do for Virtue plead, and Glory, do miscarry,
Assert we serve a Parricide or an Incendia^ie;
Bu^ we will murder, Sham and Trick, of such to make us free,
We^ll burn alive, and (...) Quick, so Hey Boys up go we.
The Pa^liament, these poor sham Sots, we`l make them well conten^,
To give supplies to cut their Throats, and when they do consent,
We`ll kick these Villans on the breach, no more of them will we,
But Britain, better manners teach for Hey Bo^es up go we.
But if they C^ance to Temporize, and foster fond Suspicions,
And tell King James of their Franchees, their Charter and Conditions;
He`ll piss upon them and their Laws, they`re blind that cannot see
The longest Sword decides the Cause, thus Hey Boys up go we.
The si^s of the long Parliament, he`ll visi^e them upon,
Their other Crimes and Heinous faults, which since are come and gone,
Of Westminster and Oxfoord too the Damned Memory;
He has an Jrish Job to do, so Hey Boys up go we.
And that he may Faeilitat, his work he`l work a while,
By Toleration, Lull asleep, the Rogues, and them beguile,
Some subtle potions he will compose, of Grace and Clemency,
To blunt all those, who him oppose, so Hey Boys up go we.
Some few Lines made upon the sight of Printed Papers of Mr. William Houstouns.
To die obscure must be a dismal Fate,
Since Mortals purchase Fame at such a rate;
As burning Cities, razing Regal seats.
Destroying Temples; overturning States.
But meaner spirits whom Destiny contracts,
Not to aspire unto such Glorious Acts;
Yet Phaetons in conceit, will be content
E`re Fame be wanting to be Fools in Print.
FINIS.
Follows some Verses made by diverse Hands upon Leiutenent Col: William
Cleland, after his Death.
An ELEGY upon the Death of the much Honored, Leiutenent Colonel WILLIAM
CLELAND.
IS Cleland gone? And is there any Breath,
Will not bemoan this galant Hero`s death
Yea Clelands gone; who after him can be
A Cleland, to compose his Elegy?
His Pen, wherewith he did immortalize
The death of others, for a hand now cries
To be employed, to publicat his Fame,
In his own Style, who can exhaust this Theme?
Some praise the Liberal Soul, and some do prize
The Mind that`s steadfast, others magnifies
The Tongue that's eloquent, others admire
A Breast, not subject to, nor touched with fear.
Some praise the Learned, some think the Prudent be
Above the common Fate and Destiny
Of other Mortals; some think the Devote
Are persons blessed in their hardest Lot.
^or Poesy some have a Veneration,
^ith some, the Sedulous in their Vocation
Are in esteem: How to be praised is be,
In whom these Virtues in a high degree,
Did burn and blaze in a most lofty strain,
Who from his Praises can himself refrain.
Come Poets all, supply my lake of skill,
To write his praises bring each one his Quil.
From wings of Pegasus, and do not spare;
To celebrate in Verse, his Virtues rare,
Mourn ye Inhabitants of Helicon,
Your Captain now lies dead at Galedon.
Come Philosophic wits employ your Arts,
To find out what perfections and parts
The Learned do aceomplish, which he wanted*
And what they have which to him was not granted
Mourn all ye Learned, and his death bemoan,
Who was the Muses eldest, dearest Son.
Come all ye Lovers of the Mathematics,
Students of politics, and Laws or practicks;
Ye that the Divine Mysteries of Truth
Profess to search, admire this excellent Youth,
Deplore his death, whose great Soul did aspire
To all the highest secrets you admire.
Come all Religions Lovers, who for duty,
And for your Zeal, for Reformations beauty
Were persecute, by treacherous Tyrants hands
Chased in your own, baniish to other lands,
Bedew his hearse with tears, who ne`r comply
With Tyrants snares, nor yielded to their pride
But ever did undauntedly oppose
True Liberties, and true Religious oes.
And ever scorned danger, or demur
With any glorious project to concur.
The Church in its due order to retrive,
His Country from all slavery to relieve,
His Princes Interest for to advance,
Against all attempts of Ireland or of France.
In these no danger were his dread, but pleasure,
Where in he spilt his blood, and spent his treasure.
Come therefore all ye Soldiers, sons of Valor,
Over his funeral express your dolor.
Who for undaunted Magnaminity
`Mong th`Ages Worthies may plac`d be in the first three
`Mong Hero's all, of whom this age can glory,
No worthy, more may be renown`d in story.
You chiefly are oblig`d of all the Region.
Poor little remnant of his proper Legion:
To turn your Triumphs into bitter mourning,
And with your brinish tears to quench the burning
Of ruinous Dunkel, in whose black smoke,
His Soul did soar up to its Eternal Rock.
Cursed Caledon, Gilboa of the Highland,
Where Canaanites, did kill our bravest Cleland.
Be thou for ever barren, and unbuilt,
Like Jericho, in punishment and guilt;
Be thou henceforth famous for naught, but from
Leiutenent Colonel Cleland's Marble Tomb.
In MEMORY of Leiutenent Colonel WILLIAM CLELAND*
I`m doubtful whom first to invite, to share
In what my Griefs and heavy Sorrows are.
Mars or the Muses; both receiv`d a Wound
That dismal day, Great Cleland fell to Ground;
Who e`re love Learning, must his fall deplore:
For in his Brain was comprehended more
Philosophy, Divinity and Law,
Than of his Years, this Age in one Man saw,
I justly may then call the poreing Tribe,
That in the Courts of Great Appollo bide,
To join with me, and to Lament in Verse
And pour a shower of Tears upon his Hearse:
Oh! fruitless Tears, for they cannot return
This Worthy Hero from his Mournful Urne;
Mournful to us, to him a sweet Repose;
For`s Mortal part: While as his Soul with those
Who are Redeem`d, sweet Halelujahs Sings*
And'mongst those crown`d heads triumphs and reigns
In the next place, my sad and grieved Heart
Calls greatest Sword Men here to take a part:
And tho ye`re more acquaint with Blood than tears*
Yet when this sad distressing Sight appears,
Brave Cleland`s Corpse laid in a da^ksome Grave*
Dry Eyes, ty`d Tongues, or whole Hearts can you have*
He`s gone, who Valor could the Valiant teach^
He`s gone, who`s Conduct was of no mean reach*
(But if he fell by Craft, or Treachery;
When he`s turn`d Dust, his precious Blood shall cry)
He Is gone, prefer`d his Honor to his Breath;
He`s gone priz^d Life, yet never feared Death.
He`s gone, whose Art in using Tempered Steel.
Has made his Foes seek safety from their Heel.
No Mortals Name I will bid you Adore,
But such a loss, ye surely should deplore
And grieve he`s gone: It is but now and then,
This barren Earth, produces such rare Men.
Great Cleland, when thy soul from earth took flight
Thou prov`d it true, saints can both pray and fight*
And gave the lie to their reproachful Words,
Say Praying men, can make no use of Swords.
And as thy Life to Enemies was Pain,
As Sampsons death, so thine may prove their Bane
From many eyes, thy fall a salt shower drew:
But God still lives. Blessed Soul we bide Adieu.
EPITAPH.
Grace, Learning, Valor centered in one
Adorn`d that dust, lies here below this stone:
Because on Earth, his Equals were but few,
His Soul took wing, and early Heavenward flew
That he might shun earths folly stains, and care,
And with His Mates, sing Halelujahs there.
ELEGY
Upon the Death of Leiutenent Colonel WILLIAM CLELAND. Who died at Dunkel, 21
of August, 1689.

Composed by the Lord of Airdrie.
WHat? Cleland dead! would he had never been,
Or (...) in some Cloister, past unseen;
Then we`d liv`d ignorants, ne`re come to know
To what a pitch in virtue man might grow
It had been an easy Faith. that death had been
Our due, and but the just reward of sin:
But now my doubting Fancy does surmize;
Death might have made attempt on Paradise,
In spite of Innocence, and can`t forbear,
Even with Religion, thus to interfeir.
I`m grown (great Cleland) cross to thy design,
I`m grown half Atheist, through this fall of thine
Inclin`d almost with passion to dispense,
To curse hard Fa^e, and quarrel Providence.
Was`t but t`amaze the World, kind Heaven, he came
And past like lightning, vanished like a flame?
Was it for only this, thou sent him here,
To make all other wonders disappear?
Or was`t to make poor silly mortals know,
What worth thou could on mortal flesh bestow?
Or but to make th`ungrateful earth repine,
That Heaven envy`d it any thing Divine?
What ever brought him here, or took him hence
It was no mean, or common influence,
Of Heavens best metal, that inform`d his soul,
And made all virtue, but a blubr`d scrol
Of his great mind: So that a doubt it is
If he were Virtues soul, or she were his.
I cannot solve the doubt; but this I find,
He being gone, she could not stay behind.
For if she was his soul, he being gone,
She has no Organ, now to work upon.
If he were hers, he being s^ar`d above,
She`s but a carcass dead, and cannot move.
He`s gone, no mortal pensil e`re shall limn
A lively draught, or of his worth, or him.
Wit finds it self for that great Task unfit:
For Cleland was an Universe of Wit.
Dumb Rhetoric has lost her Tongue and sense,
Is quite benumbed, for he was Eloquence,
And Sense in the pure abstract. Reason she
By weeping her sad loss, has lost her Eye:
Retaining only store of tears, to keep
A Consort with the mourning World, and weep.
The Muses sorry wights, have quit their mountain.
And drown`d their harps in their forsaken fountain.
They were his Converts, he had made them follow
His Heavenly lays, and quit the devil Apollo.
Had given them Zion for Parnassus Hill,
Taught them in David's streams to dip their q^
Learning has lost her Son and hop^ul Heir,
And damps the Crystal skys, with sighs and car^
Her hopes with him, are now for ever gone,
To trace the Laberinths, of her secret stone.
Even Mars himself, through loss of him is sai^
T`have broke his sword, and cursed his fighting trade
But those are losses of a second rate,
Poor Triff^s scarcely worth a grave regrait:
There comes a Lady, in a mourning guise;
Whose bloody gaping wounds, and weeping eyes
Crave all our tears, and all our sighs as due,
To her, and wills us even forget him too:
Religion! Heaven befriend thee, thou have lost:
Scarce thy remaining stock, will clear thy co^
Long have thou been a stranger, to these Land^
Banish`d and torn by sacriligious hands;
And but in hope once more to raise thine head
When by a fatal blow, thy patron`s dead.
He was thy son, but such a hopeful Child,
As gave the Mother, (fatally beguil`d)
Just hopes of conquest, O`re the powers of Hell*
And all that durst, against her Laws rebel.
Thy first Grand Enemy, the Dragons Beast;
Was by his matchless Courage, cou`d, and chas'
The Whore, its rider, found it plain, that she,
Had ne`re Encounterd such an Enemy:
And that beneath the Sun, was not one Name
Was justly more Romes terror, and her shame.
Could foil with Reason, and the force of words*
Her Reason; and her Treason, with sharp Swords*
This Justifies the Figure, where I said,
That he was verrues Soul, and she now dead.
Mark but how that black vermins poisonous gall.
Along this Worlds, consuming Gorps does crawl;
Me thinks I see, how Romes mas smumbling Moles:
Like frighted Rats, peep from their Dens and hols;
Fearful, least Fame perhaps may have belyed,
Their credulous hops, in telling Cleland`s dead:
Or least he may, although he now be gone,
Anticipat the Resurrection:
And make them once more doubt, which does afford
Most fright, his Reasons conquest, or his Sword.
But now expect no Legends of his praise,
For all these Triffles, Lawralls, Mirtles, Bays,
Were Herogliphicks Dark, and Figures dimn,
Were honour`d by, but could not honor him:
His was a greater Crown, envy will grant,
He Reconcil`d the Soldier and the Saint^
For Monument, his Memory can not need;
He build before hand his own Piramid,
On solid Virtue, whence he did aspyre,
Elijah like, to Heaven, in Flames of Fire,
And since no hand could write an Elegy,
Or speak of him as he deserv`d, but he*
With his own hand, he made his honor good,
And wrote his Obsequies, in Rebels Blood.
Tears, Tears of Blood! not these saint streams that rise,
A Wheining Sacrifice, in Female Eyes;
Become the Mournful memory of his Hearse,
Stop Muse: least thou profane it with thy Verse.
(...)
Vivit post Funera Virtus.
An ACROSTICK upon his NAME.
WEll, all most stoop to death, none dare gainsay
If it command, of force we must obey:
Life, honor, Riches, Glory of our State,
Lies at the all disposing Will of Fate:
If It were not so, why then by sad loud thunder
And sulph`rous crashes, which rends the skies asunder
Must a brave Cleland by sad destiny.
Culled out a Victime, for his Country die.
Lo, here is a Divine Hand, we find in all,
Eternal Wisdom had decreed his fall.
Let all lament it, while loud fame reports
And sounds his praise inCountry, Cities, Courts
No old forgetful Age shall end his story.
Death cut his days, but could not stain his glory
FINIS. CORONAT OPUS.
