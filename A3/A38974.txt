THE Examination OF Edward Fitz-Harris, RELATING TO THE Popish-PLOT, Taken the
Xth of March, 1680/1.
WHO says, That he was Born in Ireland, and is the Son of Sir Edward
Fitz-Harris; and that he was Bred and is a ROMAN CATHOLIC: That in One
Thousand six hundred sixty-two, he first went out of Ireland and then went into
France to learn the language as an Accomplishment, being then of the age of
fourteen Years.

IN One Thousand six hundred sixty-five, He returned thence through England
into Ireland, where He continued till about One thousand six hundred
sixty-eight when he went to Prague in Order to serve the EMPEROVR in His War in
Hungary, but there then finding a Peace concluded, He came by the way of
Flanders into England.

AND then Sir George Hamilton being about raising a Regiment of fifteen hundred
Foot in Ireland for the French King's Service, This Examinant obtained from Sir
George Hamilton a Commission to be Captain of one of the Companies in that
Regiment to be raised. Whereupon He went into Ireland, raised the Company, and
Conducted them into France, and soon after His Landing there, He was Reformed
and Discharged of His said Command; whereupon He went to Paris, and having but
little Money, He lived there difficulty about a year.

IN One thousand six hundred seventy-two, going to take his leave of Father
Gough an ENGLISH PRIEST at Paris, He said to this purpose.

YOU are going for ENGLAND, within these two years you will see the CATHOLIC
RELIGION Established there as it is in France.

THE Examinant asking him how that could be, since the KING was a PROTESTANT;
He answered, if the KING would not Comply, there was Order taken and things so
laid* That he should be TAKEN OFF or KILLED.

THAT the DUKE of YORK was a CATHOLIC, and in his Reign there would be no
Difficulty of doing it: This Examinant then asking him how long the DUKE had
been a CATHOLIC; he answered, That the QUEEN MOTHER had made him so.

HE further said that the DECLARATION of INDULGENCE was in order to that end of
Introducing the CATHOLIC RELIGION in ENGLAND.

AND that to the same end the War was made against HOLLAND for that HOLLAND was
A NEST OF HERETICS, and if they were destroyed, the work would be easily done
in ENGLAND because the English (or ENGLISH PROTESTANTS he said) would then have
no assistance from abroad.

AND he said that MADAM came over to Dover about this design.

THE Examinant coming over about the end of October, one thousand six hundred
seventy-two, about February following, had a Commission to be Lieutenant of
Captain Sydenbants SYDENHAMS Company, in the DVKE of ALBEMARLES Regiment, which
was then raised, being one of the Regiments in the ARMY, which was the Summer
following Mustered at Black Heath. And he says, he knew many of the
Lieutenant-Collonels, Majors, Captains, and Officers of that Army to be
ROMAN CATHOLICS.

That afterward the ACT passing to disable ROMAN CATHOLICS to bear OFFICE, He
and others of them were forced to quit their Commands.

AND says, That the Common Intelligence and Opinion among them was, That that
ARMY was raised with Design to bring in and settle the ROMAN-CATHOLICK-RELIGION
in ENGLAND, for which end the Invasion of HOLLAND, and the awing of the CITY of
LONDON, were fit means.

BUT the measures that were thus taken being broken, by means of the PEACE, and
by the DUKE of YORK'S, as well as these and other Officers quitting all
Commands, and the KING failing in the Expectations they had from him; the
ROMAN CATHOLICS that were engaged in this Council came to a Resolution to
DESTROY the KING, as Father Parrey, Confessor to Don Francisco de Melo, the
PORTVGVESE-EMBASSADOR, told this Examinant in One thousand six hundred seventy
three.

AND said, if all other means failed, the QUEEN would procure the Doing of it.

AND He says this Father used this Confidence toward him, because he was well
acquainted with him, and used to Confess to him.

AND this Father repeated the same Discourse to him in Summer One thousand six
hundred seventy Eight, with more assurance; adding then, that the business was
now near, and he should soon see it done.

ABOUT April, One thousand six hundred seventy nine, Marquess Montecuculi,
ENVOY from the DUKE of MODENA, after having sworn him to secrecy, told him,
That if he would undertake THE KILLING THE KING, either in his own Person, or
by any other, that he should have TEN THOUSAND POUNDS; which he refusing, the
Marquess said, If you will not, The DUCHESS OF MAZARINE understands poisoning,
as well as her Sister; and a little Vial, when the KING comes there, will do it.

AND this Examinant had a great acquaintance with the said Marquess, having
first met him several times at the DUCHESS of YORKS Chapel, and afterward,
Let him a House, and sold him the Furniture therein, and has very often eaten,
drank, and walked with him.

AND the Marquess at the same time told him, that upon KILLING THE KING the
ARMY in FLANDERS and parts adjacent to FRANCE, was to come over into ENGLAND,
to destroy the PROTESTANT PARTY, and that money was levying in ITALY, to
recruit and supply Forces in the place of those that should so come over into
ENGLAND.

AND That after that time there should be no more PARLIAMENTS in ENGLAND; and
that the DVKE of YORK was privy to all these Designs.

That about April, One thousand six hundred and eighty, he met Kelley the
Priest at Calais, who there in discourse with him owned, that he was one of the
persons concerned in the Murder of Sir EDMUND BVRY-GODFREY, and that the same
was done much in the manner as PRANCE had related it.

This Examinant has known Kelley about twelve years, in part of which time he
has had intimate Conversation with him, and has sometimes confessed to him,

That he has been acquainted six or seven years with Monsieur DE PVY, a
Servant to the Duke of York; and that soon after the Murder of Sir Edmund
Bury-Godfrey, this De PVY told this Examinant, that that Murder was consulted
at Windsor.

And about the same time said, that the DVKE was very desirous to come to the
CROWN, for that the KING was uncertain, and did not keep touch with them. And
that DE PVY said, there was a necessity of taking OFF the KING, and that it
would be soon done.

That the DVKE of YORK having an Estate in Ireland, a part of which was this
Examinants Fathers, and his Examinant, being acquainted with Father
Bedingfield, asked him, how he could give Absolution to the DVKE, till he had
made Restitution. The Father said, that every Penitent was supposed to know his
own sins, and to make them known to his Confessor. To which this Examinant
replying with some warmth* But since you know it, you ought to take notice
thereof. The Father answered, Be not angry, for ere it be long you may be in a
better condition.

MARCH One thousand six hundred seventy nine eighty, he went to Paris to
compound a Debt he owed there; staying there about eight days, where meeting
Father Patrick (who well knew this Examinant's Father and Friends, and this
Examinant) talking of a Rupture that might be between England and France, he
said the French intended in such case to send Mareshal BELFONDS into Ireland
with an Army of Ten thousand Foot and Two thousand Horse, with Arms and
Ammunition for 30000 Men more to be raised in Ire- IRELAND, and the Father
promised this Examinant a Regiment of the Men so to be Raised, and Armed in
IRELAND, and the Design was to restore that Kingdom to its former Owners,
subject to the FRENCH.

HE also desired him to send him all the LIBELS that came out in LONDON; and
said, That LIBELLING the KING and the GOVERNMENT, was a thing necessary to be
done, in order to Distaste the KING, and make him Afraid and Jealous of his
People.

THAT he knew Mr. Everard at PARIS, in One thousand six hundred sixty five, and
has since continued and increased his Acquaintance with him; that the Opinion
of Father Patrick, was an Encouragement to him to to Correspond and Concur with
Mr. Everard, as to the LIBEL lately written by Mr. Everard.
