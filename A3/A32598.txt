WHereas complaints have been made to His Majesty by the Ministers of several
Princes and States now in Amity with His Majesty, That diverse of His Subjects
have lately taken Commissions from some Princes and States now in Amity with
His Majesty, to serve at Sea against others, who are likewise His Majesty's
Allies; His Majesty for the preservation and continuance of Friendship and
Amity between Him and His respective Allies, does by this His Royal
Proclamation (with the Advice of His Privy Council) strictly Prohibit and
Forbid all His Subjects whatsoever, to take any Commission at Sea from any
Foreign Prince or State, against any other Foreign Prince or State now in Amity
with His Majesty, their Vassals or Subjects, or by virtue or color of any such
Commission already taken, or hereafter to be taken, to set out, or employ any
Ship or Vessel of War, or to serve as Mariners or Seamen in any Ship or Vessel
which shall be employed against any Prince or State now in Amity with His
Majesty, their Vassals or Subjects, during the present War. And all His
Majesty's Subjects are required to take notice of this His Royal Command, and
to conform themselves to the same, as they tender His Majesty's high
displeasure, and upon pain of being punished with the utmost severity of Law
and Justice.
