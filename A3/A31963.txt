HIS MAJESTY'S LETTER TO THE MAJOR, ALDERMEN, Sheriffs, and the rest of the
Common Council of the City of BRISTOLL.
TRusty and Welbeloved We greet you well.
Whereas We are informed that by the power and Authority of certain Factious
and Rebellious Persons in that Our City of Bristoll, diverse of Our good
Subjects (as namely Robert Yeomans, George Bourchier, William Yeomans, Edward
Dacers and others) of that Our City are imprisoned for preserving their Duty
and Loyalty to Us, and for refusing to join in, or assist this horrid and
odious Rebellion against Us, and that the said wicked and traitorous Persons,
have presumed to condemn the said innocent Men to dye, and upon such their
sentence notoriously against the Laws of God and Man, they intend to execute
and murder Our said Subjects; We have thought fit to signify to you the Major,
Aldermen, Sheriffs, and the rest of the body of the Council of that Our
City, that if you suffer this horrid and execrable murder to be committed
upon the Persons aforesaid, and thereby call the just judgment of God, and
bring perpetual infamy upon that Our City, We shall look upon it as the most
barbarous and inhumane Act that has been yet committed against Us, and upon
you as the most desperate betrayers of Us, and of the Lives and Liberties of
your fellow Subjects, And We do therefore will and Command you, not to suffer
any violence to be done upon the Persons aforesaid, but that if any such be
attempted against them, that you raise all the power and strength of that Our
City for their rescue, and to that purpose We command all Our good Subjects of
that Our City to aid and assist you upon their Allegiance, and as they hope
for any Grace and Favor at Our hands, And that you and they Kill and Slay all
such who shall attempt or endeavor to take away the lives of Our said
Subjects, And for so doing this shall be your warrant. And here of you may not
fail at your utmost Peril.

Given at Our Court at Oxford the 29. day of May. 1643
