Die Jovis 21. die Octobris. 1641.
WHereas upon the Lords meeting after their late Recesse, finding that there
are many Petitions depending in the House, and conceiving that many more may
come in, which may occasion the repair and attendance of diverse of His
Majesty's Subjects at this place: their Lordships have thought fit, and
accordingly have ordered it, That because of the danger of Infection, and
because there are many public businesses of great importance in agitation,
which concern the safety and weal of the Kingdom, that all private businesses
be deferred and put off till the thirtieth of November next. Whereof their
Lordships do hereby give public notice to the whole Kingdom, to prevent the
charge and trouble which otherwise the Petitioners might be put unto in
repairing hither.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1641
