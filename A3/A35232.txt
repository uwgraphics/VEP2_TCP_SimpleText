TO THE READER.
THough Women from the injurious estimates of the World, have been commonly
reckoned incapable of noble undertakings, from which God and Nature have no
more excluded the Feminine than the Masculine part of mankind, yet it will be a
little hard to pronounce that they really are so, if we consider how many
outward advantages men are allowed above them, having their Parts improved by
Education, Learning and Arts, and so seem by industry and Husbandry to become
different from what they naturally would appear; and if Women had the same
helps, I dare not say but they would make as good returns, of which there have
been many famous instances in former Ages. Socrates confesses himself to have
been instructed in Rhetoric by Aspatia, and even in the highest points of
Philosophy by Diotime; The Roman History informs us of the deep wisdom of
Tanaquil, Cornelia, Livia and others; which encouraged me, having first served
my own Sex, by publishing the History of the Nine Worthies, to try whether I
could not find out as many renowned Women in History, who for Virtue or Valor
might seem to equal, if not in some things, excel the other, which indeed I
found no very hard task, for though my Lord Montaign in his Essays writing of
three Good Women, says merrily, they are not to be met with by the Dozen, yet
I quickly discovered Nine whom I thought worthy to be proposed as admirable
examples, either for Goodness, Courage, Chastity, Magnanimity, yea a generous
contempt of Death, of which they are usually charged to have a slavish fear,
whereby it appears that as their Souls are of as Divine an Original and endless
a Duration as Men's, so their Minds are capable of as Gallant Achievements, yet
I will not undertake to justify self Homicide of which some of my Heroinies
were guilty, though the exigencies and extremities to which they were reduced,
may be some kind of Justification, however I hope none will make that a
President, since so many worthy things may be observed in their Lives and
Actions, both for information and delight.

The History of Deborah the Prophetess:
Deborah the Prophetess

AFter the death of valiant Joshua
The Israelites rebelled against Gods Law,
For which he gave them up unto their Foes
Who filled their Land with miseries and woes,
At length they cried for mercy to the Lord,
Who does these Penitents quick relief afford,
Raising renowned Deborah, by whose might
They Sisera and his Armies put to flight,
Himself being vanquished by a Woman's hand,
And Liberty restored unto their Land.
Which happily they enjoyed near forty years,
Serving the Lord; redeemed from all their fears.
AFter the death of Joshua who brought the Israelites into Canaan, the people
required Phineas to inform them whom God had appointed to succeed for managing
their Affairs, and carrying on the War against the Canaanites; He answered,
That the Lord had commanded them to give the Government to the Tribe of Judah,
thereupon they desired Simeon to join with them, who undertook the War upon
this condition, That when they had utterly rooted the remainder of the
Canaanites out of their own Tribe, they should employ their conquering Armies
to extinguish their Race out of all the rest; Mean time the Enemy encouraged by
Joshuas decease, expected the Israelites with a great Host under Adonibezeck
their King, near the City of Bezeca, with much confidence of success, but these
two Tribes engaged their numerous Forces with so much valor and success, that
they slew ten thousand and put the rest to flight, taking their King Prisoner
in the Fight, whose hands and feet having commanded to be cut off, he
acknowledged the Divine Justice therein, confessing that he had used seventy
two Kings in former time in the same manner.

The Israelites improving their Victory, overran the Country, and took diverse
Cities with small resistance in a short time; At length they Besieged
Jerusalem, and entering the lower City put all the Inhabitants to the Sword, but
the higher City being very well fortified with Walls and Bulwarks, together
with the strength of its natural Situation, caused them not to attempt the
assaulting it at present; whereupon marching to Hebron they soon became Masters
thereof, and slew all therein; At this time there were still left some of the
Race of the Giants, who for their Stature and Countenance were very dreadful,
and their Bones which were found many hundred years after, discovered the
vastness of their Limbs and Bulk; The City of Hebron was given to the Levites
out of respect to them, with two thousand Cubits of Land, and the rest of the
Country was bestowed upon Caleb, as Moses had commanded, he being one of the
Spies who was sent to discover the Land of Canaan; There were likewise Lands
and Possessions settled upon the Posterity of Jethro the Father-in-law of Moses,
and the Tribes of Judah and Simeon taking Possession of Asealon and Azoth two
Cities of the Mountainous Country, settled there, and after this good success
discharged themselves from the Wars.

As for the Benjamites to whom Jerusalem belonged, they took Tribute of the
Inhabitants, and agreed to live in Peace with them, so that now they all
employed themselves quietly in manuring the Country; The rest of the Tribes
did the same, suffering the Canaanites to continue in peace, only the Tribe of
Ephraim having Besieged the City of Bethel, and finding it difficult to gain
it, had it at length delivered into their hands by one of their own Citizens,
whom they therefore saved alive according to their agreement, but put all the
rest to the Sword; After this the Israelites behaved themselves more mildly
toward the Canaanites, using their service in Husbanding their Lands and
Fruits, and thereby growing rich and at ease, they grew dissolute and negligent
of the commands of God, and the policy and precepts of their Forefathers;
whereupon the Lord was grievous angry for their wickedness, and that contrary
to his express will they had spared the Canaanites, declaring that those whom
they had thus preserved should in time exercise great cruelties against them;
The Israelites little regarded these threats of the Almighty, but were wholly
corrupted, both Magistrates and People, which caused a dreadful mutiny and
commotion among themselves upon this occasion.

A certain Levite who lived in the Tribe of Ephraim having married a wife of
incomparable beauty, out of the City of Bethlem in Judah, he loved her
entirely, but suspecting that she had not the same affection toward him, much
difference arose between them, which increased so far that the woman leaving
him, went and dwelt with her Father, The husband quickly followed her, and by
reason of his extraordinary kindness to her was soon reconciled, and being
treated by her Parents four days with much respect, on the fifth he designed to
return home, but proceeded not on his Journey till toward noon by reason of the
unwilling farewell the Father and Mother took of them; He had a Servant with him
and an Ass whereon the woman rode; having traveled about 30 furlongs and
approaching Jerusalem, the Servant advised him to take up his lodging
thereabout, lest some disaster might befall them so near an enemies Country;
but he unwilling to lodge among the Canaanites, resolved to travel 20 furlongs
further to some City of the Benjamites, and accordingly came to Gibeah late in
the night, where they found none to receive them, till at length an old man
coming out of the Country, being an Ephraimite by birth but dwelling in that
City, meeting him, asked him whence he came, and how he was so late without a
lodging, he replied, he was a Levite, who having brought his wife from her
Parents was returning to his house among the Ephraimites; the old man having a
respect to his Tribe, entertained him into his house.

But certain young men of the City having observed the woman, were even
ravished with her beauty and resolved to assault the house and seize upon her;
The old man earnestly requested them to depart and offer no violence to
Strangers, but they furiously demanded to have the woman delivered, or else
threatened further mischief, neither could his alleging the worthiness of her
birth and parentage, the dignity of her husband, being a Levite, nor the
Villainy of the Fact deter them, but they still persisted in their menaces to
murder him and his Family if he did not instantly satisfy their brutality. In
this extremity the old man thought it less inconvenient to prostitute his own
daughter to their lawless desires than that his Guest should suffer any
outrage; But this would not in the least content them, so that their rage
increasing they violently seized on the woman and carried her away to their own
lodgings, where having abused her all night, about break of day they thrust her
out of doors, who being exceedingly disturbed at this horrid usage, and ashamed
to appear before her husband after this unfortunate accident she fell down dead
at the door of the house where he lay.

In the morning her husband finding her in that posture, imagined that she was
only asleep, and endeavored to awake and comfort her, since what had been done
was without her consent, and by the brutality of those miscreants, but at
length perceiving there was no life in her, he with much perturbation of mind
laid the dead Carcass upon his Ass, and carried it to his own house, where
being arrived he divided it into twelve pieces which he sent to the twelve
Tribes of Israel, commanding the Messenger to relate the occasion, and manner
of his wives death, and how horridly she had been abused. The Tribes were much
disturbed at this unheard of outrage, and assembling together in Siloe before
the Ark, they resolved instantly to take arms and utterly destroy the
Gibeonites as their mortal and implacable Enemies; But the Elders restrained
their wrath by representing to them the reasonableness of first sending to
demand satisfaction for this notorious abuse, which being denied they might
then justly proceed to punish them with severity; Accordingly some persons were
sent to require the delivery of those young men that had perpetrated this
wickedness against the woman, that they might suffer the Law according to their
demerits, but the Gibeonites peremptorily deny to yield them up, since the
whole Tribe of Benjamin wherein this City of Gibeah was situated resolved to
join with them in defense of these profligate Wretches.

This Report being brought to the rest of the Tribes, they solemnly bound
themselves by Oath to each other, that none should give their Daughters in
marriage to a Benjamite, but would mutually assist each other in the total
extirpation of that Tribe, and accordingly they put themselves into arms, and
in a short time brought an Army of four hundred thousand into the Field; The
Host of Benjamin was about twenty six thousand, and the first Battle was fought
near Gibeah wherein the Benjamites put the Israelites to flight, and slew two
and twenty hundred, many escaping by the darkness of the night; The Benjamites
returned joyfully to their City, but the Israelites were very much discouraged
by this unexpected disaster; Yet hoping for better Success they renewed the
fight next day, wherein the Benjamites again prevailed with the slaughter of
eighteen thousand of the Israelites, who thereupon left their Camp and retired
to Bethel. The day after they fasted, and humbled themselves before God,
beseeching him to appease his wrath toward them, and that he would at length
give them victory over their Enemies, which the Lord assured them by the mouth
of Phinehas the High Priest, they should obtain the next day.

Hereupon they divided their Army into two parts, one whereof they laid in
ambush near the City of Gibeah, and with the other marched against the
Benjamites, who issued out with assurance of the same success as before, and
the Israelites thereupon retiring, confirmed them in their error, so that
proceeding with much fury they were at length drawn quite out of the City, few
or none being left therein since all hoped to be sharers in the spoil and prey;
when on a sudden the Israelites making a stand and falling upon them, and at
the same time giving notice to the ambush to come on, who quickly appeared with
a great shout, the Benjamites were instantly encompassed, and though they made
the best defense they were able, yet in a short time were all slain, except six
hundred, who desperately fought their way through the midst of their enemies,
and escaped to the Mountains, all the rest being about Twenty five thousand
falling that day, and the City of Gibeah was burnt and all the women and
children therein killed; using the like severity against the rest of the Cities
of Benjamin.

The fury of the Israelites being by this bloody slaughter appeased, they began
to consider that by their rage they had almost extinguished one of the Tribes
of their Brethren, and repenting of their severity they considered of some way
to prevent their total destruction, whereupon remembering that the men of Jabesh
Gilead had refused to join with them against the Benjamites, they sent twelve
thousand chosen men against them, who slew all that bore arms with the women
and children, reserving only four hundred Virgins; At their return the
Israelites sent Messengers to the Benjamites who fled into the deserts, and had
secured themselves in the rock Rimmon, to desire them to come back to their
former possessions which they had forfeited by the Just Judgment of God for
their wickedness in protecting such impious offenders from condign punishment;
the Benjamites by the persuasions of their brethren came and possessed their
inheritance, and the Israelites gave them the four hundred Virgin Captives in
marriage; but because two hundred yet remained without wives, and they had
solemnly sworn not to give them their daughters, they concluded the Benjamites
should take the advantage of seizing two hundred of the daughters of the City
of Shiloh who came to a Feast every year near Bethel; accordingly when the
Feast approached these two hundred Benjamites went and hid themselves by two
and three in a company among the Vines and thickets to surprise the Damsels,
who suspecting nothing, were dancing very pleasantly in the Fields, when the
young men suddenly issuing out seized each upon a Virgin at unawares, and
carried them home to their houses, and having married them they repaired their
Cities and dwelt therein, whereby the Tribe of Benjamin that was near
extinguished, began in a short time to increase and flourish as before, and thus
ended this fatal War.

In this History I have followed Josephus who differs in time from what is
written in the Holy Scriptures.

After this another generation arose who forgot the works of the Lord, and
disobeyed his holy Laws and Commandments, giving themselves up to all manner of
Vice and Luxury, and wallowing in all the abominations and Idolatry of the
Canaanites, for which cause the wrath of God was kindled, and he stirred up the
Nations round about against them, delivering them into the hands of the king of
Mesopotamia, who ruled over them eight years, taking many Prisoners, and
bringing their Cities into subjection; In this their calamity they called upon
the Lord who stirred up a certain man called Othniel, who was warned from
Heaven to deliver the Israelites out of this their cruel bondage; he calling
together some of his Companions in danger who were discontented at their
present condition and desired a change, they first fell upon the Garrison that
the Mesopotamians had placed over them, whom having soon discomfited they
thereby took courage to meet them in the open Field, and their numbers
increasing by this first success they seemed equal to their Enemies, whom they
therefore engaged in battle and overcame with a very great slaughter, their
King being taken Prisoner, and the liberty of the Israelites thereby restored
to them; the terror of their arms after this was so great to all the Nations
round about, that none durst oppose them, and Othniel for his valor received
the Government from the peoples hands and exercised the Office of a Judge over
them peaceably forty years.

After whose death the Government being void, the affairs of the Israelites
began again to decline, the people neither giving due honor to God nor
obedience to the Laws, whence it came to pass that Eglon K. of the Moabites
observing their disorders made War and prevailed often against them, weakening
their Forces, and obliging them to pay tribute, and proud of his Victories,
removed his Court to Jericho, omitting no practices to vex and molest the
Israelites, so that they lived in much misery under him eighteen years, when
the Almighty moved with their supplications and sorrows freed them from this
intolerable thraldom by the hand of Ehud the Son of Gera, who insinuated
himself into the favor of Eglon, and by the gifts and presents he made him was
much respected by the king and all his Court; One day it happened that as Ehud
carried certain presents to Eglon accompanied by two of his household Servants,
he privately girt a dagger under his Garments, and entering into the presence he
delivered his gifts to the King who was then solacing himself in a Summer
Chamber; being now by themselves Eglon having sent away his attendants, to hear
the secret Message which Ehud said he had to deliver him, he suddenly stabbed
the king into the belly with his dagger, and left the weapon swallowed up in
his bowels, by reason Eglon was a very fat man; and then privately escaped
shutting the door upon him; His Servants finding the door of the parlour
locked, suspected nothing of mischief, but supposed it was upon some natural
occasion, in this error they continued till toward Evening, when fearing what
had happened they entered and found Eglon fallen down dead on the Earth; In this
interval, Ehud had time to secure himself out of danger, and coming to Jericho
gave them an Account of the matter, offering himself to be their Leader in
recovering their lost liberty, who readily accepting this proposal presently
took arms, and blowing a trumpet they assembled all the people of the Country,
who joining together fell upon the Moabites before they were prepared, who were
so dismayed at the dismal Accident of the death of their King, that they knew
not how to make any defense, insomuch that the Israelites charging fiercely
upon them killed many upon the place, and the rest being about ten thousand
betook themselves to flight hoping to recover their own Country, but the
Israelites having before fortified the passages of Jordan, pursued and slew
them all; By this means the Israelites were freed from the servitude of Moab,
and continued quiet from any Invader fourscore years.

After this Shamgar the Son of Anath was Elected Governor, who slew six hundred
of the Philistines with an Ox-goad and thereby in some measure delivered them;
but the Israelites not yet reclaimed by their former sufferings returned again
to impiety and disobedience though they had so lately shaken off the yoke of
the Moabites; So that God in just Judgment gave them into the hands of Jabin
king of Canaan, who kept his residence at Hazor on the Lake of Sachonites; He
had an Army of thirty thousand Foot, ten thousand Horse, and nine hundred
Chariots of iron. Over these Forces Sisera was Commander in chief a great
Favorite with the King, who encountering with the Israelites reduced them into
such a low condition that they accepted of servitude, and were obliged to pay
tribute for twenty years; In this lamentable state, they began to reflect upon
their transgressions, and provocations against the Almighty, acknowledging the
Justice of Heaven in punishing them for their ingratitude and contempt of the
Divine Laws, and repaired to a certain Prophetess named Deborah, which in
Hebrew signifies a Be, beseeching her that by her Prayers she would entreat
the Lord to have mercy upon them, and free them from their bondage under the
Canaanites; Hereupon God being inclined to compassion promised them
deliverance, and appointed Baruc, whose name signifies Lightning, of the Tribe
of Napthali to be their Chief; to him therefore Deborah sends a message, That
he should instantly raise ten thousand choice men, and lead them against their
Enemies, affirming that they were sufficient with the assistance of Heaven to
conquer that mighty Host; But Baruc denying to undertake the War except she
would join with him, and accompany him in the War, Deborah being somewhat
moved, Will thou, said she, surrender up the Dignity that God has given thee
to a Woman? well I will not refuse to go with thee, but remember that this
expedition will not be for thine honor since the Lord will sell Sisera into
the hand of a Woman.

Whereupon having levied ten thousand Soldiers, they pitched their Tents near
the Mountain Itabar, of which Sisara having notice proceeded presently by the
Kings command to fall upon them, and encamped near them; Baruc and the
Israelites being terrified with the multitude of their Enemies were encouraged
by Deborah who commanded them that very day to give Battle, assuring them that
God would assist and certainly deliver their Adversaries into their hands.
Whereupon they charged the Canaanites with much valor, who were in a short
time wholly discomfited, and all their Host fell with the edge of the Sword;
Sisera alighted from his Chariot and fled away afoot; Josephus relates, that in
the beginning of the fight there suddenly fell a storm of rain mixed with hail,
which the wind drove against the faces of the Canaanites, and took away their
sight, whereby those that fought with Darts and Slings were made unserviceable,
and the Targetiers had their hands so benumbed with cold that they could scarce
weild their Swords, but the Tempest being on the back of the Israelites was so
far from disturbing them, that believing it a manifest token of the immediate
favor and assistance of Heaven, they were thereby encouraged to assault their
enemies with the greater vigor, and breaking through the front of their Battle
they made a very great slaughter of them, so that a vast number fell by the
Sword, and the rest were overrun by their own Chariots and Horsemen. Sisera
flying with all speed, after he saw his Army turn their backs, arrived at the
Tent of a woman of Cenetis called Jael the wife of Heber, and earnestly
besought her to conceal him, which she seemed very willing to do, and covered
him with a Mantle, who being very dry, desired a Cup of water, when she
presented him with a dish of milk; And then covering him again, he entreated
her, That if any came to inquire she should deny she had seen him, and then
fell asleep; whilst he lay buried in slumbers by reason of his extreme toil and
weariness, Jael took a nail and with a hammer struck it through his temples and
fastened it to the ground whereby he instantly gave up the Ghost, soon after
Barue with his Soldiers coming thither, she brought them in and showed what
she had done, and thus a woman according to the prediction of the worthy
Prophetess Deborah, was the Author of this glorious Victory; The Army being
likewise managed by the conduct of Deborah a woman, the Israelites thereby
subduing their inveterate Foes the Canaanites: And Baruc leading his Army to
Hazor slew Jabin their King, who came out against them, levelling the City to
the ground, and thereby freed the Land from bondage, which had rest forty years
after this notable success; And that they might not seem ungrateful to the Lord
for so great a deliverance, Deborah and Baruc composed the following Song of
praise and thanksgiving, which they sung in the hearing of all the people.
Deborah lived in the year from the creation 2641. and before the Nativity of
our Savior 1350.

Judges 5.
YOur Great Preserver celebrate
He who revenged our wrongs of late,
When you his Sons in Isreal's aid
Of life so brave a tender made.
You Princes with attention hear
And you who awful Scepters bear,
While I in sacred numbers sing
The praise of our Eternal King.
When he through Seir his Army led
In Edoms Fields his Ensigns spread,
Earth shook, the Heavens in drops descend
And Clouds in tears their substance spend.
Before his face the Mountains melt
Old Sinai unknown servor felt,
When Israel Shamgars Rule obeyed
And Jael that Virago, swaid;
She bold of Heart; He great in War,
Yet to the fearful Traveller
All ways were then unsafe; who crept
Through woods, or past when others slept.
The land uncultivated lay,
When I arose, I Deborah
A mother to my Country grew
At once their Foes and Fears subdue,
When to themselves new Gods they chose
Then were their Walls besieged by Foes.
Did one of forty thousand wear
A Coat of Steel or shook a Spear
You who with such alacrity
Led to the Battle; O how I
Affect your valor; with me raise
Your voices; sing Jehovahs praise.
Sing you who on white Asses ride
And justice equally devide.
You who those ways so feared of late
Where now no thieves assassinate;
You lately from your Fountains barred
Where you their clattering quivers heard
There with united joy record
The Righteous Judgments of the Lord;
You who your Cities repossess,
Who reap in peace, his praise profess
Arise, O Deborah, arise;
In heavenly Hymns express thy Joys;
Arise, O Baruc; Thou the Fame
And Offspring of Alcinoam;
Of Israel the renowned head
Captivity now Captive lead:
Nor shall the noble memory
Of our strong aids in silence dye.
The quiver bearing Ephraimite
Marched from his Mountain to the fight,
Those who on Amalek confine
The small remains of Benjamine.
From Machir Princes not a few,
Wise Zebulun with Letters drew,
The valiant chiefs of Issachar,
With Deborah, hasted to this war;
Who down into the valley tread
The way which noble Baruc led.
But Reuben from the rest disjoined
By Hills and Floods, was so in mind,
Did thou these glorious wars refuse
To hear the bleating of thy Ewes?
O Great in Council! Oh how wise!
That could both Faith and Fame despise.
Gilead of thundering drums afraid,
Or slothful, beyond Jordan staid;
Dan his swift failing ships affects
And public liberty neglects.
While Ashur on his clifts resides
And fortifies against the Tides.
But Zebulun and Nap^hali
Who never would from danger fly,
Were ready for the public good,
On Tabors top to shed their blood.
Then Kings, Kings of the Cananites,
To Tanach Plains addressed their fights.
Where swift Megiddo's waters ran
Yet neither spoil nor Trophy wan,
The Heavens against Sisera fought, the Stars,
Moved in their Courses to those wars.
By Ancient Kishon swept from thence,
Whose Torrent falling clouds incense
Thou O my joyful Soul at length,
Have trod to dirt their mighty strength.
Their wounded Horse with flying have
Fall headlong and their Riders cast:
Thus spoke an Angel; cursed be
Thou Meroz all who dwell in thee
That basely would no aid afford
In that great battle to the Lord.
O Jael, Hebers wife thou best
Of women be thou ever blessed,
Blessed above all; Let all that dwell
In Tents, thy Act, O Jael tell
She brought him milk above his wish
And butter in a princely dish.
A hammer and a nail she took
And into Sisera's Temples struck
He fell, fell down unto the floor,
Lay where he fell bathed in his gore,
Lay grovelling on his feet, and there
His wretched Soul sighed into air.
His mother at her window staid,
And looking out from thence, she said,
"Why are his Chariot whee it so slow?
"And don't my Son in Triumph show?
When her wise Ladies standing by
Yea she her self made this reply,
"Have not their Swords yet won the day?
"Have they not shared the wealthy prey?
"Now every Soldier for his pains.
"A Hebrew Dame, or Virgin gains
"While Sisera, choosing, lays aside
"Rich Robes in various colors died,
"Rich Robes with curious needles wrought
"On either side; from Phrygia brought
"The thread spun from the Silkworms womb
"Such as a Conqueror become.
Great God! so perish all thy Foes,
Love such as love thee, On let those
Shine like the Sun when he displays
In The Orient his increasing Rays.
The History of the Valiant Judith.
depiction of Judith

WHen Holofernes by the proud command,
Of Nebuchadnezzar was sent, the Land
Of Israel to invade, and overthrow
Their Towns and Cities, so to bring them low,
The Hearts of all were filled with fear and dread,
How such great force should be encountered,
Then Valiant Judith for her Countries sake
Deliverance for them does undertake.
Courageously the General she slays
And Isreal's dying hopes does thereby raise.
Who do their flying foes fiercely pursue,
And unto Judith render praises due.
THough the History of Judith is placed among the Apocryphal writings, and not
allowed to be canonical Scripture, as not being delivered by the inspiration of
the Holy Spirit; yet it is thought by the learned that the matter thereof is
true, and the worthy and reverend Archbishop Usher in his Scripture Chronology
sets it down as a matter very certain, and that it happened in the year from
the Creation 3348. in the reign of Manasseh King of Israel, and before the
birth of our Savior about 652.

Having premised this to encourage the reading the life of this famous Heroine
not as a fiction or Romance but a story full of veracity, I proceed.

Nothing feminine must be expected in this woman, all her actions were manly
and full of generosity, and what was wanting in her Sex, was fully recompensed
in her Virtue and Valor; her hand was triumphant in destroying above an
hundred thousand men, by cutting off only one head, but her eye did much more
than her hand, that first conquered Holofernes, and with a little ray of its
flames burnt up a whole Army. It was in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar King of
Assyria, that this female worthy lived, who being elevated by the many
victories and successes he had obtained, his ambition sweld him so much that he
resolved to afflict the whole earth, and to destroy all the Gods of the Lands,
and oblige all Nations to worship him, and that all Tongues and people should
adore him only as God; to prosecute this impious design he commanded Holofernes
his Chief Captain to muster an Army of an hundred and twenty thousand foot, and
twelve thousand Horse; with this mighty force this renowned General ruined all
before him that made resistance, and received those to mercy who desired peace
and submitted to those idolatrous terms he required of them; the motions of
this dreadful host brought terror to the stoutest hearts, and confusion to the
weak and cowardly; before it marches Noises, Affrights and Threats; after it,
Weepings, Ruins, and Desolations.

The report of this overflowing deluge of men came to the poor Israelites at
Jerusalem, which raised Sighs and Groans in the most obdurate Souls, who being
sensible of this furious tempest approaching, their courage was dismayed, their
hands hang down, and their tongues were silent, having no other defense but
their tears which they poured out abundantly in prospect of the Funerals of
their Native Country; At this time Manasseh was king of Jerusalem who not
foreseeing any possibility of stoping this violent torrent, or preventing the
impending misery of his kingdom, abandoned himself to sorrow and desperation;
but Joachim the High Priest, who likewise executed the Office of a General,
used all possible means to revive the drooping Spirits of this disconsolate
people; he sends Messengers to all the Cities to furnish what men and
provisions they were able, to stop if possible the course of this barbarous
enemy, and to endeavor to take possession of the streights and narrow passages
of the Mountains where a few might do great execution, and thereby prevent
their descent into the Plains, where the multitude of their Forces would soon
incompass and swallow all that opposed them. He then commands public
supplications to be made to the Almighty, and covers the Altar-of the Lord with
Sackcloath, and the Priests with Haircloth, who with tears, and fastings (even
the little children too) prostrated themselves on the earth to implore the
mercy of Heaven toward them; but knowing that prayers without endeavors would
be fruitless, he visits all the Cities in person, comforting the afflicted,
strengthening the weak, and enlivening the dull, thereby giving life and vigor
to all the members of the body politic.

Holofernes having advice that the Jews made preparations to oppose him by
force was filled with rage and disdain, and called the Princes of Ammon, Moab
and the Governors of the Seacoasts to him, of whom he demanded, what people
they were who inhabited canaan, what strength they had, and who was their King,
that they presumed to withstand them, and would not come and submit themselves
as the other Nations had done. To whom Achor Prince of Ammon thus replied.

If my Lord will not be angry I will give him a full Account of those people
which dwell near the Hill Countries, without diminishing or concealing any
thing of the truth; Be it known to my Lord that they are originally descended
from the Caldeans, but separated themselves from them by reason of their
Religion, refusing to worship the Gods of their Fathers, and adoring only one
God the Maker of Heaven and Earth, and departed into Mesopotamia, where they
continued many years; but were at length commanded by their God to depart from
thence and go into the Land of Canaan where they dwelt and multiplied
exceedingly, increasing in Gold, Silver, Cattle, and all the blessings of this
life. After this a terrible Famine happening in their Country they went down
into Egypt to get food, where they were kept alive, and grew to a very great
number insomuch that they began to be a terror to the Egyptians, and that King
endeavored by all means to diminish them, imposing cruel bondage upon them in
making bricks, thereby to bring them low; upon which they cried to the Lord
their God who revenged their wrongs by horrible plagues upon the Egyptians, so
that they were forced to let them go whithersoever they pleased; when they were
gone the King repented of what he had done, and resolved to pursue and utterly
destroy them, but God dried up the Red Sea before them so that they passed
safely through, and the Egyptians were all drowned therein; From hence their
God led them to Mount Sinai, and through the barren deserts of Arabia, and
miraculously nourished them there with food from Heaven, and waters out of the
Rock, and caused them to be victorious over all the people of the Countries
through which they passed; Thus as long as they served their God they were
invincible over all their enemies, devouring the Amorites, Jebusites,
Perezites, and other Nations as fire consumes the chaff, and possessing their
Lands and Estates; But when they departed from Gods worship and defiled
themselves with iniquity, they were then forsaken of Heaven, defeated in many
battles, and led captive into the land of their adversaries, the Temple of
their God being cast down and their Cities taken from them; But they are now
again returned to their former worship, and their Country and Temple at
Jerusalem where they fortify themselves against us; Let us therefore, my Lord,
be advised before we proceed against them, for if their God be angry with them
by reason of any provocation, it will be easy for us to subdue and destroy
them; but if he be reconciled and will defend them, it will be in vain to
attempt any thing, since he will certainly ruin and defeat all that shall
assault them, be their strength and multitude never so great.

Achior having thus spoken, the Commanders of the Army were extremely incensed
against him, and desired he might be slain, who had the confidence to imagine
that so small a number of people as the Israelites were, should be able to
withstand the force of the Royal Army of Nebuchadnezzar, whom they doubted not
but to discomfit at their very first appearance. Holofernes having quieted the
tumult raised among his Soldiers by this Oration, spoke thus to him and his
Associates.

Who art thou Achior, and who are you Hirelings of Ephraim that you have
prophesied we should not make War with the people of Israel because their God
will defend them, as if there were any other God but Nebuchadnezzar, whose
Servants will utterly destroy them, the Mountains shall be drunk with their
blood, and their Fields covered with their dead bodies; And thou Achior shall
see my face no more till I take vengeance of these people that came out of
Egypt, and in the mean time I will deliver thee into their hands.

Accordingly some Soldiers were sent to carry Achior bound and throw him down
the Hill near the walls of the City, which the Israelites perceiving came and
brought him into Bethulia, and being carried before the Priests and Governors
of the City, who inquired the meaning of this adventure, he gave them an
account of all he had said to Holofernes, and what Testimony he had given of
the Power and Majesty of God; whereat the people were even ravished for joy,
and fell down crying to the Lord of Heaven to behold the pride of their
enemies, and pity the low estate of his servants; And then comforted Achior,
and promised him all security and protection.

Mean time Holofernes endeavored to surprise little Bethulia, but found it
hard to be effected by reason of some valiant men who lay in ambush in the
Mountains, and much gauled his Army in the narrow passages; whereupon his
Soldiers persuaded him not to hazard his whole Army in this dangerous attempt,
but endeavor to stop the channels that carried the water from the Fountains,
which would quickly oblige them to yield; This was performed accordingly, and
was very like to have effected their design, for the people began to murmur and
mutiny aloud against the Priests for bringing them into this dangerous
condition by their rashness, since there was little hope of prevailing against
such a formidable power as had already subdued so many Nations, and with one
voice required them to surrender up the Town to the Assyrians; Ozias in the
absence of Joachim endeavored to appease the cries and tears of the people,
and desired them to take courage and trust in God, and if deliverance did not
come in five days he would then do as they pleased.

There was then in the City of Bethulia a great Treasure whose worth and merit
was utterly unknown; It was the valiant Judith of a worthy Family of the Tribe
of Reuben, whose husband was named Manasseh, and had been dead about three
years and an half, leaving her very rich; She was exceeding beautiful and very
religious, spending all her time in devotion, and wearing sackcloth upon her
loins, whereby she gained much reputation among the people. This worthy Lady
hearing of the resolutions of Ozias was much disturbed at the miseries of her
Country, and sending for Ozias and the rest of the Princes of the people she
thus addressed them.

O ye Governors and Inhabitants of Bethulia, in my opinion you have been very
rash in what you have spoken this day to the people, and in the Oath you have
taken and pronounced between the Lord and them in promising to deliver up the
City to the enemy if God do not send you help within five days, which is to
tempt, and prescribe to him the time of his mercies, and not to depend upon his
providence who knows best when and how to bring Salvation to those that put
their trust in him; Let us therefore continue to serve the Lord according to
his Laws and Commandments, and not turn aside to worship other Gods (as our
Fathers did before us, and for which they were given up to the Sword of their
Adversaries) and in Gods good time which is the best, he will work out
deliverance for us. Ozias replied, All that she had said was true and
excellent, and that it was not the first time wherein she had manifested her
wisdom and knowledge, for which she was always held in admiration, but that
the extreme thirst of the people and the violent exclamations they raised, had
caused them to enter into an Oath which they durst not break; But (said he)
since we know thee to be a religious woman and upright in thy conversation, we
beseech thee to pray to God for us that he will please to send us rain and fill
our Cisterns, and then we shall take courage to defend our selves. Hereupon
Judith told them, That she would perform an Act which should resound through
all generations, defiring them to leave one of the City Gates open through
which she might freely pass that very night, accompanied with her Servant,
since she had some good work in her heart for the benefit of her Country,
which she would not yet discover, but assured them that God would save them by
her hand within the time limited for giving up the City; Ozias and the Princes
bid her go in peace, and prayed the Lord God to be with her, and to take
vengeance of their enemies. Before she undertook this mighty Action, she
retired to her closet, and putting ashes on her head, and sackcloth on her
loins, prostrated her self to the earth and prayed earnestly to God in this
manner.

O Lord the God of my Fathers to whom nothing is impossible, look down upon the
Armies of Assyria who exalt themselves against thee, and glory in the strength
and number of their Forces, and let them know that thou art the God of Battles,
and the Lord of Hosts is thy name, and that thou breakest in pieces the mighty
powers of the earth with one glance of thy eyes; Throw down their strength by
thy Almighty arm, and lift up that hand which has made it self renowned from
all ages by so many wonders as thou have wrought against those that have
opposed thy peculiar people. Confound their pride, and suffer them not to
violate thy Temple, pollute thy Sanctuary, nor destroy thy Tabernacle where thy
Glorious name rests, and is called upon by thy afflicted Servants: Send thy
wrath upon them, and deliver into my hand who am a weak widow the Commander of
their Camp, give me such eloquence and utterance that my words may prevail upon
him to his destruction; And since thy strength is not in the multitude of
Soldiers, nor in the valor of Horsemen, make it now appear that thou can
save by the most weak and unlikely means, and that thou who art the God of the
distressed, the helper of the oppressed, the supporter of the most destitute,
and the Protector and Savior of those that are without hope, art able to bring
down thy most haughty and presumptuous Foes even by the hand of an impotent
woman. Remember thy Covenant O Lord, give counsel to my heart, words to my
mouth, and strength to my arm for the defense of thy House and People that all
the Nations of the world may know there is no God like unto thee.

Having thus armed her self with her Prayers and Confidence in the God of
Heaven, she puts off her mourning and sackcloth, and washes and adorns her self
with Rings and Jewels to the best advantage, so that she appeared exceeding
amiable in the eyes of all, though her virtues and graces were much the greater
ornament to her, and then having prepared meat and drink for her self and
servant, because she would not be polluted with the dainties of the Heathens,
she leaves her house, and goes toward the gate of Bethulia where she finds
Ozias, and the Chiefs of the City Chabris and Charmis, who seemed ravished with
the luster of her heavenly beauty, yet inquired not into her design, but
implored the blessing of God upon her, and the enterprise she had undertaken,
and the gates being opened, she attended only by her maid, went directly toward
the Camp of the Assyrians, all the people of the City looking after her as far
as they could see; As she went down the Mountain at break of day the Soldiers
having discovered her, ran presently to seize on so lovely a prize, and were
much surprised with the charms and splendour of her countenance, and having
inquired of her Country, and present intentions, she told them, That she was a
woman of Bethulia, and that she had that night deserted the people of that
miserable City, who were obstinate to procure their own destruction from the
triumphant arms of the Assyrians, into whose hands they would at last certainly
fall, but that she would have no share in their crime, hoping to escape their
disasters also, and that her business was to reveal to Holofernes a certain way
how to take the City and all the Country round about without loss of a man.
The Soldiers were amazed at her comeliness and discourse, and assured her she
had taken the only course to secure her life and honor, and that their Lord
would receive and entertain her with all manner of kindness and respect.

It may seem a rash attempt that a woman so handsome as Judith, should venture
her self and her honor, to the rudeness of the dissolute Soldiers, who
propound to themselves the ravishing of women for one part of the reward of
their dangers and toils in war; And we may be apt to think that an honest woman
would scarce expose her chastity to so many hazards and affronts, although it
were to save a City; In humane reason this conduct of hers can hardly be
defended, but who dares condemn what seems to proceed from a manifest
inspiration of Heaven, which kept her as safe in the midst of the greatest
seeming difficulties as if immured in the strongest Castle.

She was then conducted to the Tent of Holofernes, who was leaning upon his Bed
under a rich Canopy of State imbroidered with Gold, Purple, Emeralds and
Jewels, who having notice of her approach came to the door of his Tent with
Silver Lamps before him; Judith being come into his presence, struck him and
all his Attendants into admiration at her furprizing handsomness, and being
fallen at his feet, he caused her to be instantly raised up, and to encourage
her, treats her with incomparable sweetness, assuring her, That he was not
terrible to any who would submit themselves to the obedience of his great
Master Nebuchadnezzar the King of all the Earth, neither would he have
permitted a Sword to have been drawn against her Nation if according to their
duty they had rendered their Towns to the arms of that Mighty Monarch, and
therefore desired her to inform him upon what account she had forsaken the
City, and was come to his Camp.

Judith endeavored to gratify his request by this subtle Oration. My Lord, I
am very well satisfied that the Great Nebuchadnezzar is ordained of God to be
the King of the whole world, and that all the strength of his Monarchy, and
management of his warlike affairs is included in your Person, and conducted by
your wisdom and policy, for the safety and protection of the good, and the
chastisement of evil doers. The valor and prudence of the worthy Holofernes is
renowned through all the Earth, who desires to be powerful only that he may be
merciful, of which all the Provinces which have fallen under his conquering arm
have had comfortable experience; As for the words which Achior declared to my
Lord, he has repeated the same in the ears of the people of Bethulia, thereby
endeavoring to encourage them to defend themselves valiantly, and what he has
said is most true and certain, that the Israelites shall not be punished,
neither can the Sword prevail against them except they sin against their God;
But now their sin will overtake them, and thereby make them an easy prey to
their enemies, for since their victuals and water fail them, they are resolved
to kill all their Cattle, and to eat all things, even those forbidden by their
Law, and not to spare those which were sanctified, and reserved for the use of
the Priests, and service of the Temple, whereby they will provoke their God to
anger; For this cause, my Lord, have I left that abominable City, and am come
as a Messenger from Heaven to give you this advice; and to perform such an act
that all the earth shall be astonished therewith, for thy Servant is religious,
and worshippeth the God of Heaven every day and night, and I will pray unto him
to discover his will to me, and to show me when they have committed these sins
against him, that so I may inform you of the utmost time which is determined
for this miserable Town, and then you may march even to the very gates of
Jerusalem, and settle your Throne there, since the people will deliver
themselves up to you as sheep without a shepherd, and a dog shall not open his
mouth against you, it being very reasonable that men and beasts should submit
themselves to such a formidable power as is conducted by the hand of the most
High, and by the direction of his providence.

Holofernes who was before taken by the eyes, was now charmed by the ears with
the pleasantness of her discourse, and admired her above all women in the world
both for her beauty and wisdom, promising that her God should be his God, and
that he will advance her to great dignities in the house of Nebuchadnezzar, and
make her renowned through all the earth. And at the same time brings her into
the Chambers of his Treasure and Magnificence, and ordered her provisions both
of meat and wine daily from his own Table, which she excused, since her Law did
not permit her to eat of any other Viands but her own, which she had provided
and brought along with her; But what (says Holofernes) if your own store should
be spent, how shall we supply you? Judith replies, That she did not doubt but
to accomplish the business she came about before that time; After this she was
conducted into a stately Tent, where she reposed till midnight, and toward the
morning watch she sent to Holofernes that he would please to permit her to go
out before day to address her prayers to God, which he readily granted,
commanding his Guards to let her pass freely; She went therefore in the silence
of the night into the valley of Bethulia, where she washed her self in a
Fountain of water, and then prayed earnestly to God that he would prosper her
design for freeing her Country, and again raise up their drooping spirits.

Having continued in the Camp three days, watching an opportunity to execute
her intended project, behold a fit season was presented by Holofernes himself,
who would needs make a sumptuous banquet for his servants and familiars only,
to which he resolved to invite Judith as the chief Guest, hoping that when she
was merry he might obtain his desire of her, since the Assyrians account it a
great dishonor to a man to court a woman and not enjoy her; And therefore he
ordered one of his Eunuchs to wait upon her and impart his Masters pleasure to
her, and how far she was in his favor, since he desired that very day to have
her company at the magnificent Feast he had prepared, which was the greatest
honor she could ever receive, and therefore ought to make no scruple of
obeying, but to be pleasant and free with him who had laid so great an
obligation upon her; Judith soon understood what his discourse tended to, and
readily answered, That she was wholly disposed to perform his Lords commands,
and would have no other will but his; And instantly adorns her self in the best
manner, to wound his heart with her graces and charms, and passing into his
Pavilion, seats her self nigh unto him, where she eats what she had provided,
and tells him she will now drink cheerfully, since she had cause to count this
the most happy day of her whole life.

When Holofernes saw her so near him and alone, his heart was wholly ravished
with her beauty, he thought himself the most fortunate man upon earth; His
passion did not permit him to speak much he was so extremely moved; He
contented himself only with inviting her to be merry, and drank large draughts
to make himself so; And Judith expressing, her great content to see him in so
good an humor, he to please her as he thought, drank so much more than
ordinary, that he was even dead with drunkenness and the fumes of the strong
wine; The Eunuch having the word to do his Office, dismisses all the servants,
and Attendants, and shuts the door upon his Master and Judith; Holofernes lay
sleeping upon his bed full of wine, but Judith was never more wakeful, she
contemplates the gallant General lying in his drunken sleep, and earnestly
called upon God to prosper her bold undertaking for the exaltation of Israel,
and going to the pillars of the bed she takes down thence the sword of
Holofernes, and undauntedly drawing it, she takes hold of the hair of his head,
and saying, Strengthen my arm O Lord God of Israel this day, she smote him
twice upon the neck with all her force, and with the last blow struck off his
head, throwing his body on the ground; then pulling down the Canopy from the
Pillars, and giving it her Maid, with the head, she put it into her bag among
the meat, and both of them pass through the Army without being questioned, the
Officers having order to let them go as usually to prayers.

Having passed the Camp, they went up the Mourtain of Bethulia, and arriving at
the City gates before morning, she cried to the Sentinel afar off to open the
gates with all speed, since God had done worders for Israel, and had appeared
in a strange manner for their deliverance from their enemies; The people
hearing her voice, soon let her in, and ran to give notice to Ozias and the
Rulers; all the inhabitants both great and small coming together to hear what
tidings she had brought, whom they looked upon as a lost woman, and like one
come from the other world, and having made a great fire to give light to the
Assembly, they stood round about her, who spoke thus in the midst of them with
a loud voice, Praise God, praise ye the Lord I say, who never forsakes his own,
but has by me this day accomplished his promise to his chosen people, and has
by me and by my hands slain the common enemy of our Nation this very night.

She then drew out of the bag the horrible head of Holofernes, all pale and
bloody which she showed to them all, adding, Behold the head of the Capt. Genesis
of the Armies of Assure, and then spreading abroad his Pavilion, Behold said
she, the Canopy wherein he reposed himself in his drunkenness, and where the
Lord smote him by the hand of a woman; It is the living God alone that has
preserved me from all danger in this most perilous attempt, and though my
countenance has been his ruin, yet I take that God whose Angel has been my
guard to witness, he has not offered me the least shame nor reproach; To God
be all the glory whose mercy and goodness endures forever. The people were even
transported with joy at this unexpected deliverance, and seeing the dismal head
only by torch-light, were almost persuaded it was but a dream; But that the
multitude which saw the same thing confirmed them their eyes were not deluded;
They therefore shouted with praises to the God of Heaven the only worker of
Miracles, and then turning to Judith they gave her a thousand thanks and
blessings for being the instrument of so mavelous a salvation that day.

Then Ozias the Prince of the people of Israel in Bethulia spoke thus to her,
Blessed be you O Daughter, and most excellent above all the women in the Earth,
and praised be the great Creator of Heaven and Earth who has assisted your
Victorious arm for the destruction of the principal of our Enemies, whereby you
have rendered your name immortal to all ages to come, and shall be had in
admiration by all that have any sense of the wonderful works of God while the
world endures, since none can forget how little you valued your own life and
honor, so that you might thereby free your Nation from the inevitable ruin
which seemed to hang over their heads. After this Achior was called to whom
showing the head of Holofernes, and assuring him that what he had affirmed of
the might and power of the God of Israel was now fully verified, since he that
had vowed their total desolation was now no more, and their great Commander
Holofernes was himself without a head; Achior was even astonished at her words
and action, and with the surprise fell down into a swound, but at length
recovering he threw himself at her feet with so much reverence, as was near to
adoration, and by her means was more confirmed in the true Religion, and he
with all the people shouted, and gave glory to God with a loud voice.

Judith to perfect her Conquest advised the people to place the head upon one
of the highest Towers of the City, and in the morning to make a salley out upon
the Assyrians, who at the alarm would presently run to the Tent of Holofernes
to awake him, and finding what had happened, would be extremely amazed and sell
their lives at a cheap rate, and might be pursued and utterly destroyed out of
all their Coasts with very little damage to themselves. This was put in
execution, and the Captains instantly repaired to the Generals Tent to receive
orders, desiring Bagoas the Eunuch to wake their Lord, since the Israelitish
slaves had presumed to make a sally upon them tho to their own destruction; The
Eunuch after long tarrying at last ventred in, and coming near the bed and
hearing no body stir, he at length opened the curtains thinking he had still
slept with Judith, but instead thereof found the dead body cast on the floor
and his head taken from him; At this fight he cried out aloud and became so
furious that he rent his cloths, and went in a rage to Judiths apartment,
threatening her with a thousand deaths; but missing her there, he sent out many
frightful Schreeches among the People, and declared aloud, That the Slaves had
dealt treacherously with them, and that one Hebrew woman had brought shame and
confusion upon the House of Nebuchadnezzar, who had slain Holofernes and left
his carcass without a head.

All ran to behold this dismal Spectacle, and the whole camp was filled with
horror, astonishment, and despair; Tears and howling had taken possession of
the whole Army when at the same time the head of Holofernes appeared upon one
of the Towers of Bethulia, which so astonished the Assyrians, that they fled
and scattered themselves round about the City, every one seeking safety in
running away, and none durst trust another; The Israelites pursued with all
manner of briskness and vigor, making a great noise that their number might
appear considerable, though there needed no great force to vanquish run-a-ways:
All the neighboring Cities came in to take part of the spoil and to pillage
their routed enemies whom they cut off with a most dreadful slaughter, and the
booty in the Camp was so prodigious that the people were thirty days in
dividing it. The rich movables of Gold, Silver, Pearls and Jewels found in
Holofernes Tent were all presented to Judith, with the praises and acclamations
of the multitude, who unanimously applauded her as the glory of Jerusalem, the
joy of Israel, the honor of her people, the gallant woman, the chaste and
valiant Princess by whose hand God had done great things in delivering his
people, and whose fame should live to eternal Ages. The women of Israel
likewise assembled themselves to meet and bless her, dancing before her with
branches of Olive in their hands, whereof they composed a Garland which they
put upon her head, and then Judith leading the dance before them proceeded
toward her own house, all the men of Israel following in their armor with
garlands on their heads and songs in their mouths. Judith likewith made the
following song of Praise and Thanksgiving, which all the people sang after her.

SIng to the Lord my God, sing praise,
A new Psalm to him sing.
Exalt his glorious name always,
He is our God and King.
The Armies he to pieces breaks
Of those that are his Foes.
He me delivered from their hands
Who did me round enclose.
Assure with thousands from the North
Came Israel to assail,
And by his multitudes did not doubt
Against them to prevail.
He boasted he our Towns would burn
And our young men destroy,
Women and Virgins ravish, and
Our Infants make a prey.
But they have disappointed been
By the Almighty Lord.
A woman's hand did them withstand
They fled with one accord.
Their Great Commander did not fall
By any Giants power
'Twas Judiths beauty him inthrall'd
And brought his fatal hour.
For her oppressed people she
Her mourning laid aside.
And to surprise his amorous eyes
Her Person beautified.
Her Charms over his Soul prevailed,
And ravished his sight;
He Is made a Prisoner to her face,
She is his Hearts delight.
The Sword quite through his neck did pass
And parted it asunder.
The Persians at her boldness quake,
The Medes thereat did wonder.
The Afflicted then did shout for joy
Thy weak Ones cried aloud.
The Foes astonished were 'cause God
Had overthrown the proud.
The Young men have them pierced through,
And wounded them in Fight,
The Fugitives fiercely they pursue
And slay their men of Might.
I unto God new Songs will sing;
O Lord thou art most Glorious,
In power thou art Wonderful,
Invincible, Victorious.
Let all the Creatures worship thee
At whose word made were they,
At thy voice they created were
None thee can disobey.
The Fountains shall be moved at thee
The Rocks shall melted be.
Yet merciful thou art to those
That serve and worship thee.
All Sacrifice and Offerings
Unto thee are but small,
But those that fear the Lord their God
To Honor he will call.
Woe to the Nations that advance
Themselves against Israel.
The Lord will vengeance take of those
That against him do rebel.
He will put fire into their flesh,
And worms shall them annoy,
They shall much misery feel; God will
For ever them destroy.
After this Judith dedicated to the Temple the Pavilion of Holofernes, and
other rich habiliments given her by the People, that the memory of this
glorious Action might never be forgotten, and then returning to her own house
she there continued a chaste widow to the day of her death, being honored and
respected of all the people as their Great Deliverer; she made her servant a
free woman, and lived in the house of her husband Manasseh till she was an
hundred and five years old, and then dying was buried in his Sepulcher, for
whom all the Israelites made a deep and solemn mourning seven days without
intermission, and the terror of this admirable success made such an impression
on all the Neighbor Nations that none of them troubled Israel all her days nor
a long time after her death.

How great art thou O Lord of Hosts, and how terrible is thy power thou God of
Battles, a General in the midst of an Army of an hundred thousand valiant
Soldiers, environed all with steel and fire, who says I will go, I will do, I
will level with the ground, who decreed the firing of Cities and destruction of
Countries, behold him now conquered, slain, tumbled in his blood by a woman who
makes a play-game of his head, and all this by the assistance of that God who
acted in her, and put courage into her soul to overthrow the mighty, and bring
to confusion the Sons of pride and violence.

The History of Queen Esther.


WHen Haman in his proud ambitious mind
Utter destruction to the Jews designed,
When for the fault of one they all must dye,
All must be ruined for poor Mordecai,
Then prudent Esther does her self oppose
Against her Uncles and her Peoples Foes,
Ventures her life her Nation to save,
And Mercy for them of the King does crave.
Who hears and grants her suit most graciously,
Haman is hanged for his Treachery,
And Mordecai his Office does enjoy,
Who for the Jews his Interest does employ.
IN the year from the Creation of the world 3543. and before the birth of our
Savior 521. during the Captivity of the Jews in Babylon; Cyrus (the son of
Xerxes whom the Grecians called Artaxerxes) was King of Persia; in whose reign
all the race of the Jews both men, women and children were in danger to have
been utterly exterminated, had it not been happily prevented by the mercy of
God, and the excellent conduct and admirable courage of our renowned Heroine
Queen Esther.

For the better understanding hereof, we read that after Artaxerxes was settled
in the Kingdom, and had established Governors over an hundred and seven and
twenty Provinces from India as far as Ethiopia, in the third year of his reign
he made a most Royal and Magnificient Feast for all the Grandees of his mighty
Empire, wherein he displayed the opulency and grandeur of his Dominions for one
hundred and fourscore days together; After which he for 7 days treated the
Ambassadors of all Nations in the Palace of Shushan, sitting in a Tent, the
Pillars whereof were Gold and Silver and the covering of Scarlet, of such a
vast extent that thousands might be entertained under it; all the provisions
were served in Vessels of Gold enriched with Jewels, and of excellent
workmanship; The King commanded his Attendants that none should be enforced to
drink, but according to the Persian usage, each at his own discretion; He also
sent an Order throughout all his Countries that they should all cease from
their labor many days, and make Holyday in Honor of his Royalty.

At the same time Vashti his Queen made a Royal Banquet to her Ladies, and the
King being merry with wine the seventh day of the Feast, sent one of his
Eunuchs to cause her to come with the Crown upon her head in the most glorious
manner, and her most gorgeous attire, to display her beauty to the eyes of all
the people, but she being too tenacious of the Persian custom that count it a
crime to be seen by strangers, refused to come, and though he renewed his
desires diverse times, yet she persisted in her denial, upon which being
extremely displeased, he rose suddenly from the Banquet, and calling to him
seven of his Counselors by whose advice he managed his affairs, and who
expounded the Law to him, he desired to know what punishment they thought due
to his wife who had put such an open affront and indignity upon him before that
Great Assembly; one of them answered, That this was a crime of State, and might
occasion a general disorder throughout the Realm, since all other women
following the example of the Queen might from thence take a licentious power to
disobey their husbands, and every where domineer over them, thereby
overthrowing the order of Nature, and cause quarrels and disturbance in all
Families; His opinion therefore was, that she who had done him this public
dishonor should be divorced from the King her husband, and that a Proclamation
should be published throughout all his Provinces signifying the cause thereof,
and asserting the just subjection of wives to their husbands. The King who had
an extraordinary passion for Vashti, and could hardly entertain any thoughts of
a separation from the dear object of his love, seemed for some time wholly
abandoned to grief and sorrow, which his Nobles observing, endeavored to
remove by representing the unreasonableness of his concernment for such an
unworthy woman who had so extremely disobliged him, and that he might soon find
out another who in beauty and all other Princely qualifications should far
exceed her, and by whose pleasing demeanor the thoughts of Vashti might be
utterly extinguished.

The King confirming the Judgment they had given against Vashti, sent abroad
messengers to bring into his presence the fairest Virgins that were to be found
in his Kingdoms; Whereupon a great number being assembled, there was among them
a young Orphan whose parents being dead, she was educated under the tuition of
her uncle Mordecai of the Tribe of Benjamin, and a principal man among the
Jews, her name was Esther and was judged the most beautiful of all that
youthful company, and for her amiable countenance caused all Spectators to
stand still and admire her; Whereupon the Eunuchs attended her with more than
ordinary diligence, and she was prepared for the kings pleasure with odors and
perfumes for six months, in the company of four hundred other Virgins; After
which the Officer judging them fit to approach the Royal bed, sent one every
night to the King, who returned her back in the morning; But when Esther came
into his presence, he was so surprised with her love that he took her for his
lawful wife, and settled his affections upon her above all the others; The
marriage was solemnized in the seventh year of his reign in the twelfth month
called Adar, or February; And edicts were sent throughout all his kingdoms to
proclaim a Feast in honor of this wedding, he himself likewise feasting the
Medes, Persians, and Princes of other Nations, for a whole month upon that
account.

When Esher entered the Royal Palace, the king set a Diadem of gold upon her
head, and lived with her with all manner of content and satisfaction, never
questioning her birth nor of what Nation she was; Her uncle Mordecai came with
her from Babylon (where she was found by the Kings officers) to Shusan the
chief City of Persia, and walked daily before the Palace inquiring of her
welfare, whom he loved as tenderly as if she had been his own; Now the king had
published a Law, that no man should approach his presence unless (...) sent
for; In pursuance whereof, while he sat on his Royal Throne certain Officers
stood with their Axes ready to punish any that should attempt to infringe this
Decree; The king himself sat aloft, holding a golden Scepter in his hand, and
when any presumed to come near without being called, if the King would save his
life he touched him therewith, who thereby avoided death.

It happened about this time that Bigthan and Teresh two of the kings
chamberlains had conspired against their Master, which Mordecai who was not of
a drowsy Spirit soon perceived, and narrowly observing their carriage, he
discovered the whole design, which he imparted to Queen Esther, and she to the
King in the name of Mordecai, who being taken and examined confessed their
abominable Treason and received their due reward; the king at present only
returned Mordecai hearty thanks for saving his life, but commanded him to
continue in his Palace, and ordered his name to be registered in the Chronicles
of Persia with the whole process against the Malefactors.

After this Ahasuerus exalted Haman an Amalekite above all his Princes and
Nobles, and he became the chief Favorite, so that the king saw but with his
eyes, and heard with his ears; All the Court adored this new Idol, and all
knees were bowed before him, but Mordecai showed him no reverence nor respect
both because he knew the wickedness of his nature, and that the Laws of the
Jews forbad him to give honor to any of the wicked race of Amalek; Haman
elevated even to giddiness by the greatness he so suddenly arrived to, had at
first little regard to it, but being daily advertised thereof by his
Flatterers, who informed him that they had often in vain reproved Mordecai for
his contempt, he was thereat inflamed with rage against him, and understanding
he was a Jew, was much disturbed that all the Persian Nobility who were free
should prostrate themselves before him, and a Jewish slave should refuse to
reverence him, he therefore scorns to revenge himself on Mordecai alone, as
thinking it much below his grandeur to punish one man only, but resolves
utterly to exterminate the whole race of the Jews, to whom he was a mortal
enemy by nature, the Amalekites his predecessors having been destroyed by the
Israelites in former ages; and revenge may be imagined thus to inflame him.

Remember Haman there is no sweeter pleasure
Than swift revenge; for to revenge by leisure
Is but like feeding when the Stomach's past,
Not pleasing the eager appetite nor taste,
It Is not for the honor of thy personage
Nor stands it with thy greatness to engage
Thy noble thoughts to make revenge so poor
To be revenged on One alone; thy sore
Needs many Plasters; make thy honor good
Not with a drop, but with a world of blood,
Borrow the sithe of Time, and let thy passion
Mow down and ruin the whole Jewish Nation.
In pursuance of this hellish resolution Haman addresseth himself to the King
and tells him; That there were a certain cursed people called Jews dispersed
through all the Provinces of his kingdom, who were divided by Religion and laws
from the rest of the World, and by affection from his Person and government;
That they were pernicious to his Empire, and upon all occasions ready and
disposed to insurrections and rebellions, and that for preventing the mischiefs
which might happen by them, nothing would be more secure than to cut them off
all at once, and utterly to extinguish their race, so that neither Captive nor
Slave should be left alive among them; And lest their destruction should prove
prejudicial to his Majesty's Revenue, he freely offered to pay out of his own
Estate forty thousand Talents of Silver into the Exchequer, being willing
rather to part with so much money for the public safety than that such a
cursed generation of men should endanger the kingdom.

Thus is the horrid Scene laid for the ruin of so many millions of people by
the pernicious counsel of one malicious and ambitious favorite; The king is
soon led away by this evil advice, and trusts this proud Haman with the
execution thereof, as if he had committed the sheep to the protection of the
Wolf; He triumphs with joy for having obtained his desire and the kings Ring;
He calls the Secretaries and commands them in the name of Ahasuerus to write
bloody Letters to all the Provinces; That the thirteenth day of the last month,
(which was February) the Jews should be massacred in all the Cities and Towns
within the utmost limits of the Empire and that from the least to the greatest,
not sparing man, woman nor child, all should be put to the sword without
remorse, and their goods to be confiscate, and exposed to pillage; These
Letters confirmed with the Kings seal flew like lightning through the hundred
and twenty seven provinces of the Persian Monarchy; The evil was universal, and
the terror began at the Capital City of Shushan, where the Edict hanged upon
Pillars was seen and read to all the world, containing this dreadful Sentence.

Ahasuerus Rex.

Let every Province in the Persian Land,
(Upon the day prefixed) prepare his hand
To make the Channels flow with Rebels blood
And from the earth to root the Jewish brood;
Let not the softness of a partial heart,
Through melting pity, Love, or false desert,
Spare either young or old or man or woman
But like their crimes, so let their plagues be common
Decreed and signed by our Princely Grace
And given at Shushan from our royal place.
This sanguinary Proclamation being published in all places, many bloody
Miscreants rejoiced at the news, and prepared themselves to execute the
contents thereof, resolving at the day appointed utterly to destroy the Jews,
and to leave no remembrance of them upon earth; The Metropolitan City of
Shushan abounded with these Instruments of cruelty, though in the mean time the
K. and Haman, feasted and drowned themselves in debauchery; Poor Mordecai
foreseeing the Tempest ready to fall upon his people, clothed himself with
Sackcloth and put ashes upon his head, in which equipage he walked through the
City protesting that his Nation had done nothing to deserve this severity
designed against them, and at length arriving at the Palace he stood at the
gate, (it being unlawful for him to enter in that dress) with many of the Jews
in his company and in the same mourning attire; The news hereof coming to the
Queen, she was much surprised, and sent an Eunuch to bid him change his
garments, which he absolutely refused till the cause of his putting them on was
removed; Whereupon she again dispatched her servant to him to know what sad
occasion had induced him to put on that dispairing habit, and to pour out such
lamentable and incessant cries; Upon which Mordecai sent her an account of the
terrible edict lately published against the Jews and proclaimed through all the
provinces by the Kings command, with the great Sum of money which Haman had
offered to pay into the Exchequer, whereby he had purchased the utter
desolation of the Jewish Nation; and herewith he delivered a Copy of the Edict
to the Messenger, with a strict injunction to Esther to cloth her self in the
most abject fashion, and to present a petition to the king for the saving her
people from the deplorable destruction decreed against them. Esther having
received this advertisement sent again to Mordecai to tell him; That she knew
not when she should be called for by the King, and to presume to come into his
presence without order would undoubtedly endanger her life, unless the king
should happen to extend the golden Scepter of mercy to her; Mordecai returned
answer; That she ought to venture her own safety for saving the lives of her
whole Nation, assuring her, that if she neglected their security, yet Heaven
would do it by some other means, and she and her fathers house should be
destroyed by those she had slighted and contemned; Says he, Go tell the Queen
it rests in her powers
To help; The case is hers as well as ours,
Go tell the fearful Queen, too great's her fear,
Too small her zeal, her life she rates too dear,
How poor's the adventure to engage thy blood
To save thy peoples life, and Nations good?
Who knows if God on purpose did intend
Thy high preferment for this happy end,
If at this needful time thou spare to speak,
Our speedy help shall, like the morning, break
From Heaven, together with thy woes, and he
That succors us, shall heap his plagues on thee.


Upon this severe reprimand the Queen sends to Mordecai commanding him to call
a general assembly of the Jews to Shushan, and to enjoin them to fast and pray
three days for his safety and good success, assuring him that she and her
servants would do the same, and that at the end thereof she would present her
self before the king, and says she, If I perish, I perish; Mordecai according
to her direction caused the people to fast and pray for her, and he himself
made earnes^ supplication to the Almighty; To have compassion on their desolate
and distressed Nation, and as he had formerly preserved them, and pardoned there
offenses, so he would graciously please to deliver them from that imminent
destruction which now hung over their heads, since they were now condemned to
death not for any iniquity of their own but merely because he only had incensed
proud Heman against them, in refusing to pay that honor and adoration to him
which was due to God alone for which he had contrived this severe revenge
against the whole Nation of the Jews, to cut them all off from the face of the
Earth; The people likewise beseeched God to secure them from the outrage
intended against them; And Esther cast her self prostratstrate on the earth
clothed in Sackcloth, devoutly imploring the God of her Fathers to assist and
defend her that when she should come before the King she might mollify, and
persuade him to have pity upon her and her distressed people.

The three days being over she threw off her mourning, and adorned her self in
the most majestic manner that was possible, and attended by her Servants went
into the presence Chamber, where the king sat on his Throne, the splendour and
glory whereof did at first somewhat astonish her; When Ahasuerus holding out
the golden Scepter revived her fainting Spirits, and drawing near she touched
the top thereof, and the King very endearingly asked her, What her request to
him was; She replied, That she only desired his Majesty to honor her with his
presence at a Banquet she had prepared for him, and that his dear Friend Haman
might likewise attend him. The King readily consented, and Haman joyfully came
thither; Now in the midst of the Treat when the King became warm with wine, he
commanded Esther to declare her suit unto him, assuring her he would deny her
nothing she should demand; Esther at present declined to discover her intent,
but humbly beseeched the King to come again next day with Haman, and partake of
another Banquet, when she would fulfill his desire. Ahasuerus promised to
revisit her, and Haman went home with great joy that he only had the great
happiness to feast with the King and Esther, an honor which none of the
Nobility of the Empire had ever arrived to; But in his return observing
Mordecai at the Court gate, who would not show him the least respect, his great
heart sweld with indignation against him; Arriving at his house he called for
his Friends and his wife Zeresh, to whom he related the glory of his riches,
and the greatness of his dignity, whom the K. had advanced above all the
Princes of the Realm, and that Esther suffered no man but himself to come with
the King to the Banquet, and that to morrow he was again to attend his Majesty
thither to a second entertainment; Yet, says he, all this avails me nothing,
nor am I in the least contented, when I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the
Gate and refusing to rise or show the least reverence to me; Zeresh his wife
being as full of revenge and pride as he, pronounced a sudden and short
sentence against Mordecai, advising him; To cause a Gallows to be set up fifty
foot high in his own Court, and the next day if he did but desire the King to
let him hang Mordecai thereon, no doubt but it would be granted, and then he
might go and sup with the Queen with a merry heart; This counsel pleased Haman
very well, and the Gallows was soon erected, but Divine Providence had prepared
other business for him to dispatch, to make him know, That no body designs the
ruin of another without hastening his own destruction.

The evening bofore this fatal day the K. was laid upon his bed to repose
himself, but could get no sleep all night long, without having the least
appearance of care or trouble on his spirit, and to employ himself caused his
Secretary to bring and read before him the Chronicles of his Realm, wherein
among other Transactions in the reign of his Ancestors and his own, he found it
recorded that Bigthana, and Teresh two of the Kings Chamberlains had conspired
to murder him, and in all probability their Treason had succeeded, but that
Mordecai the Jew happily discovered the whole Conspiracy, for which the
Traitors received their deserved punishment; At the recital of this passage the
King was somewhat moved and asked whether there were no mention of any honor
or reward bestowed upon Mordecai as a recompense for this worthy service, who
replied; That he found nothing set down of that kind, neither had he as yet
received any reward upon that account; Hereupon in the morning the King
demanded who was in the Court, and being told Haman was there, who came thither
more early than usual to beseech the king that he would please to give him
leave to put Mordecai to death, The K. commanded him to come into his presence,
to whom he said; That as his faithful friend and servant he desired him to
advise what honor and dignity was fit to be bestowed on that Person whom the
K. had a very great favor and respect for; Haman who did not in the least
doubt but the person designed to be thus advanced was himself, made this
confident-reply; The man to whom your Majesty intends so much honor as to be
counted the Kings Friend and Favorite, ought to be mounted upon one of your
own Horses, and to be clothed with the Royal Robes, with a Chain of Gold about
his neck and the Imperial Crown upon his head, and let one of your most Worthy
Princes go before him through all the streets of the City, and make
proclamation That thus it shall be done to the man whom the King delights to
honor; The King liking the proposal, commands Haman to go instantly to
Mordecai that sat at the gate and to invest him and proclaim before him
according to his own advice; Haman with a heavy heart performs the Kings Orders
through the whole City, and Mordecai returned triumphantly to the Palace.

Haman hastened home confounded and ashamed at what had happened, and with tears
related his strange misfortune to his Wife and Friends; who all concluded, That
it was a very ominous accident, for Mordecai was of the seed of the Jews, and
since he had begun to fall before him, it was much to be feared that it would
end in his ruin, because God was with that Nation to save and defend them from
their Enemies; While they were thus discoursing, a Messenger came from Esther
to call Haman to the Banquet; The King seated at this second Entertainment,
began again to be earnest with Esther to declare the petition and request she
had to make to him, since he was fully resolved to gratify her therein, yea to
divide his Crown and Scepter with her rather than deny her suit; To whom Esthe
after a sad sigh declared the danger she and her people were in, to this
purpose; If in the bounty of your Princely grace
Your sad Petitioner may find a place
To shroud her most inutterable grief
Which if not there may hope for no relief.
If I have favor found, O let my Lord
Grant me my life, my life so much abhorred
To do him service and my peoples life
Which now lie open to a Tyrants knife.
Our lives are sold, it is I, it is guiltless I
Your Loyal Spouse, it is she and hers must dye,
The spotless blood of me your faithful Bride
Must swage the swelling of a Tyrants pride.


The King enraged at her discourse asks who was the man that had thus conspired
the destruction of her self and all the Jews, she replied, Even that wicked
Haman to whom your Majesty has given your Seal, it is that perfidious Traitor
that has caused bloody Letters to be written (not to banish or sell us for
Slaves, for then I should have held my peace, but) that we should be cut off by
the Sword in the Provinces of the Empire.

Who is the man that durst attempt this thing?
Where is the Traitor? what? am I a King?
May not our Subjects serve, but must our Queen
Be made the Subject of a Villains Spleen?
Is not Queen Esther bosomed in our heart?
What Traitor then dares be so bold to part
Our heart and us? who dares attempt this thing?
Can Esther then be slain and not the King?
Replied the Queen, the man that has done this
That cursed Haman, wicked Haman is.
The King rose furiously from the Table, and went into the Garden; when Haman
began to beseech Esther to intercede for him, and forgive the offense he had
committed, and being very earnest he fell down on the bed where the Queen was,
when the King returning hastily back, and finding him in that posture was much
more displeased than before, and cried out; O thou most cursed among men, will thou ravish my Queen also? Haman was so confounded at these words that he could
make no reply, and the Officers covered his face; Hereupon one of the
Chamberlains stepped forth and told the King, that Haman had erected a Gallows
fifty foot high at his own house whereon he designed to have hanged Mordecai;
whereupon Ahasuerus commanded that Haman himself should be hanged thereon,
which was instantly executed accordingly.

For (says the King) it seems just and good
To shed his blood that thirsts after blood,
Who plants the tree deserves the fruit; it is fit
That he who bought the purchase hansel it,
Hang Haman there for it is his own wood,
So let the Horse-leech burst himself with blood.
And herein was the Justice of Heaven manifested' not only in punishing the
wickedness of Haman according to his deserts, but in causing him to fall into
that snare and pit he had prepared for an innocent person; This was the end of
that great but wretched Favorite who by abusing the interest he had in the
Kings breast brought woeful ruin upon himself and his whole Family, his goods
were given to the Queen who bestowed them on Mordecai, whom the King
understanding to be her Uncle, he was called to the Palace and had Hamans Ring
given unto him, and succeeded in his dignity.

After this Esther humbly entreated the King to command Letters to be sent
through all the Provinces to countermand those contrived by Haman for the utter
destruction of the Jews, for how (said she) can I endure to see the ruin of my
Nation and all my Relations; This her request was thought very reasonable, and
the King granted it, adding, that as he had hanged Haman because of his bloody
intentions against her people, so she her self should write on their behalf in
his name and by his Authority to all the Governors of his Kingdom to reverse
the dreadful sentence that was gone out against them; In pursuance whereof the
Secretaries of State were instantly employed in that affair, and writ to all
the Magistrates of the Kingdom to this purpose.

Ataxerxes the Sovereign Lord and King of all the Nations that are from India
to Ethiopia, To the Princes and Governors of the seven and twenty Provinces of
our Empire, Greeting; Whereas many through pride abusing the goodness of their
Princes, and the honors bestowed upon them, do not only oppress the people,
but endeavor the absolute desolation of all that do not comply with their
haughty and unreasonable desires, of which the late wicked Haman an Amaletite
by Nation, is a fresh instance, who being a stranger from the Persian blood,
after he had been promoted by our beneficence to the second place of the
kingdom has endeavored to cut off at once the innocent Jewish Nation, and
among them our beloved Queen, and companion of our bed Esther, though we have
discovered that those thus destined to death by this wicked Villain are without
fault, living under excellent Laws, and are the Children of the most high, most
great and everliving God by whom our Empire is given and preserved to us; We do
therefore make void and disannul the Letters which that vild wretch directed to
you in our names, whereby they were commanded to be murdered, he himself who
was the Author of that cursed slander against them having been publicly hanged
at the gate of his own Palace, God thereby rendering to him his deserts; And we
further will and command you, that the Jews who live in all our Provinces
according to their own Laws be protected, and that you assist them in bringing
their Enemies to punishment the same day that they had determined to destroy
them, that so they may revenge themselves of those that shall offer any outrage
against them, and since the day of their destruction is by the providence of
the Almighty turned to their preservation; We command this day to be put in the
number of the Feasts, that posterity may know what recompenses we bestow on our
faithful Servants and the punishment of those that oppose our will, and make
attempts upon our State.

The commands of the King were diligently executed, and the Jews were dreaded
and honored in all places by reason of the great credit that Mordecai had with
his Master, who was clothed in a Royal habit, and adorned with a Crown of Gold
and a Chain of the same about his neck; In short the Jews encouraged by the
Kings Letters slew five hundred of their Enemies in Shushan, for adhering to
miserable Haman, and ten of his sons were hanged to accompany the punishment of
their Father, and through all the rest of the kingdom much Persian blood was
shed on the same day that had been assigned for the Massacres of the Hebrewt,
so that we must acknowledge this history to be wonderfully tragical and one of
the most prodigious revolutions of fortune that ever arrived to a great
Favorite, and may make posterity fear the Judgments of heaven whose hand is as
weighty in the chastisement of enormous crimes as his eye is quick sighted in
discerning the hearts of all mortals.

So often as I fix my serious eye
Upon Ahashuerus reign, methinks I spy
The Angels dance; methinks my ravished ear
Rapt with the secret music that I hear,
Attends the warble of an Angels Tongue
Resounding forth this sense bereaving song
Vashti shall fall, and Esther rise,
Sion shall thrive when Haman dies.
The History of the Virtuous Susanna.
depiction of Susanna

WHen Virtuous Susanna was accused
By two false Elders, and her Fame abused;
Because she would not yield unto their lust
And be unto her marriage vows unjust.
And falsely charged with base adultery
For which great crime she was adjudg'd to dye
In this distress she unto Heaven appeals
Who by young Daniels means, the truth reveals
And absolutely clears her innocence.
The perjured Elders for their vile offense
Are both condemned at the fatal Bar
To that sad death they had designed for her.
THough this (as well as the former History) is not found in those Books of
Scripture which are usually termed Canonical, yet the Thirty Nine Articles of
the Church of England declare, That those other books commonly called
Apocrypha, the Church ( as St. Jerome says) does read for example of life and
instruction of manners, but yet does not apply them to establish any Doctrine
of Christianity, and among others, sets down this History of Susanna, which
from such Authority may certainly claim the credibility of any Common Story,
and be reckoned no unprofitable President of Chastity and Modesty and therefore
proper for our present design.

The time when this was acted is most probable to be about 3400 from the
Creation, not long after that of the preceding History of Judith, when there
happened to live in Babylon a man called Joachim, who married a wife named
Susanna the daughter of Chelcias brought a Captive from Judea, for the sins
whereby they had provoked God to anger, to Babylon, who was exceeding fair, of
Person, but her soul much more beautiful in that she feared the Lord And as she
feared, she loved; No servile fear
Such as base slaves unto their Tyrants bear
But like a daughter who with filial care
TO her Fathers just commands does give an ear
She served her Maker; so it is hard to say
If Love or Fear most taught her to obey.


Her Parents were likewise very religious, and educated their daughter in all
Gods commandments according to the Law of Moses; And being rich and wealthy,
they had a fair Garden adjoining to their house, and many of his Captive
brethren of the Jews resorted to him as a Person of the greatest remark of
their Nation; Among others two of the most reverend among them who were
appointed to the Judges for deciding controversies, much frequented his house
and there heard all causes, and suits in Law depending between them, but
instead of being upright and sincere in giving judgment, they were such as were
foretold should come, Who though ancient Judges, yet from them should proceed
wickedness and injustice, and instead of governing according to equity they
should pervert the Law of God. These old Fornicators had east their amorous
eyes upon the charms of Susanna, and having observed that she usually walked in
this pleasant Garden, they contrived to surprise and ravish her there, and
though they were both wounded alike with the love of her, yet they durst not
discover their passion to each other, though both watched all manner of
opportunities to fulfill their lustful desires, and having abandoned all
thoughts of Religion and Conscience they made it their whole business to find
some advantage against her. It happened once that having taken leave of each
other morder to go to dinner at noon, they parted asunder, but being intent
upon the same matter, which was if possible to find Susanna alone, they both
returned back at the same instant, at which they were at first a little amazed,
one enquiring of the other what bufiness he had there, and after some short
discourse they perceived both came about the same errand, whereupon they soon
settle a right understanding between themselves, and concluded to be joint
Partners in this amorous prize, only waiting a convenience for effecting their
purpose.

During this their longing expectation a promising season seemed to fall out,
for Susanna being desirous to bath her self at the Fountain in the Garden in
the heat of the season, attended only by two of her waiting Women, she sent
them both away to provide Oil and Nitre in order thereto, and then unclothed
her self and went into the Water; the old Letchers had watched all her
proceedings having secretly hid themselves under the covert of the Trees, and
when they perceived her Servants were gone and had shut the doors after them,
they doubted not but the happy minute was arrived, and therefore suddenly
issuing out from their concealment they ran to her, and seizing upon this
innocent and helpless Fair One, they began to discover the extraordinary
passion they had for a long time retained for her, and that the doors being now
shut if she would consent to their desires it could never be detected.

Think how Susanna blush't, looked pale, and then
Trembled for fear, blush't and looked pale again
Whilst they; "Fair Creature now behold the doors
"Are all made fast, y' are now within our powers
"Yet we entreat; consent, come don't deny
"We'er smitten Lady and with you must lie
"There Is none can see; it is witness causes shame
"Whilst unrevealed ills are free from blame.
But if you refuse (say they) to comply we our selves will complain against
you, and accuse you that we found a young man committing folly with you, who
sent away your maids to be more private in your wickedness.

If you will not comply, we Judges are
And against your innocence will both declare
That as we walked in this neighboring Grove
You played the Harlot with your wanton Love,
Therefore your maids were sent away lest they
Should notice take of your hot amorous play.
Susanna was in a great straight, and venting many bitter sighs and tears she
said, I am in much distress on every side, and know not which way to incline,
for if I do this thing I sin against the Law of God, and ought to be cut off
from my people, and if I do not I shall fall under your false accusation,
however it is better for me to venture suffering under a malicious prosecution
than to sin in the sight of the Lord, and provoke Divine vengeance against me.

Susanna cried, Let Heaven be my guide
I am betrayed, distressed on every fide
If I consent, by Moses Law it is said
No Wife shall climb up to another bed
Unpunisht which divine decree implies
Death's the reward of all adulteries.
If I refuse y' already have designed
What base return true Virtue's like to find!
However I must not, dare not sin; your skill
Extends no further than this life to kill,
But God will me avenge, and one day plead
My guiltless cause with vengeance on your head.
The Elders finding threats had no impression on her chastity, may be supposed
to use the Atheistical Arguments of the debauched wits of the present age, who
have thereby endeavored to gain their lewd purposes in such strains as these,
Lady such coyness mis-becomes your years
It Is time enough when care has sown gray hairs
And plowed deep furrows on your aged head
Then to confine unto a husbands bed.
Nor be offended that Old Age has drawn
A ghostly curtain over our youthful Lawn
Or think it strange that amorous blood remains
Still in the channel of our paler veins,
It Is you that gave it life, the fault is yours
Do but consent and then it shall be ours.


But Susanna no way moved with this lascivious Rhetoric, still makes
reflection on her honor, her conscience, and her conjugal fidelity, and
finding all her labor to reduce them to reason utterly in vain, she as the
last remedy sets up a loud cry as they began more rudely to approach her, which
was heard through the whole House; And these treacherous Elders seconded it
with another as loud against her; the servants at the noise running with all
speed into the garden found the Elders with her, who impudently alleged, that
they saw her committing adultery, wherewith her Attendants were much surprised
and ashamed, since they always esteemed her the most virtuous woman in the
World. Next day when the People were assembled before Joachim her husband these
Villainous Elders full of malice and indignation for such an unhappy
disappointment appeared likewise, and with much confidenee required that
Susanna should be brought before the Assembly and judged and executed according
to the Law; Joachim could not deny their earnest desire, and therefore
commanded his wife Susanna to be sent for, who came accompanied with her
Father, Mother, Children and all her kindred, and being exceeding beautiful
these old Miscreants ordered her vail to be taken off her face, that they might
in part satiate their desires by beholding her delicate form; This being an
affront not usually offered to women of her quality was yery grievous to her
friends, who wept to see her thus abused, which forced tears also from all the
Spectators; Then the two impious Elders stood up in the midst of the people and
laying their hands on her head began to accuse her; Poor Susanna made her
appeal to Heaven, humbly beseeching the Almighty Lord to vindicate her
innocence when these wretches thus proceeded.

It happened as my brother and I were walking together in the Garden alone
under the shady walks, we perceived this woman and two of her maids coming in,
being entered she sent them away and shut the door. Soon after a young man who
lay concealed came to her and committed folly with her; We observing this
wickedness ran toward them and endeavored to seize the youth, but he being too
strong for us made his escape and opening the garden door fled away with all
speed; whereupon we took this woman and examined very strictly who the man was
that had acted this iniquity, but by all our threats and persuasions could not
prevail with her to discover him, and therefore now desire justice against her,
for her crime which we here solemnly swearwe saw her commit.

The Elders cry; O sons of Jacob dear
To this our Evidence lend a gracious ear
You know that Moses of eternal fame
Who did our sacred Laws and Statutes frame
Which after were confirmed by heavens broad seal
That each Command did unto him reveal
Among the rest; If man or woman be
Surprised in the Act of Adultery
Both of them must abjudged be to dye.
That they, not we, may bear the iniquity
This wicked woman (as we lately were
In The Garden walking there to take the air
And happening to cast our eyes aside)
With an adulterous youth we there espied
But that to innocence she might pretend
Two maids at first upon her did attend
Until impatient grown they did straightway
By her command convey themselves away
And shut the door; So that now none but we
Who lay concealed this wicked act could see
For then a young man by appointment sure
Secretly lodged in the Trees coverture
Draws near, and lovingly does her embrace
She likewise him, such willingness there was.
Till close approaches (for we both it saw)
Made them Transgressors of the sacred Law,
Then from a corner of the garden whence
We closely standing saw this foul offense
Both of us made to the adultrous pair
And came upon them e're they were aware
To apprehend him; but the sturdy knave
Got from our feeble hands and did us leave
And in swift have out from the Garden flew.
As whom the guilt of conscience did pursue
And she though much entreated ne'rtheless
Will by no means the Criminals name confess;
These things are true, which we here testify
Now brethren judge if she ought not to dye.
The Assembly were in much consternation to hear this sever accusation against
a woman who was renowned for Chastity, but having the testimony of two grave
Elders and Judges of the people to justify the truth thereof, they could do no
other but condemn her to death for this notorious crime; Susanna having no
defense for her innocence on earth, appeals to heaven for her justification and
cried out with a loud voice in the midst of the people; O everlasting God who
know the secrets of all hearts, and from whom nothing is concealed or
hidden, for thou see all things before they are acted, I appeal to thy just
judgment against these perjured and unjust Elders; Thou-knowest O Lord that
what they have witnessed against me is utterly false, and behold I must dye,
for what I am not in the least guilty of, thou know that it is all forgery
and malice against me, and that it is a conspiracy of these wicked Villains
against my life in that which I am absolutely ignotant of; Vindicate my
innocence O God of truth and bring shame and confusion upon these false
accusers.

O everlasting Lord, to whom alone
The thoughts of all men are entirely known
O great Jehovah whose all seeing eye
Runs through the circle of Eternity
Thou know stand thou alone the wrong I bear
From those who have polluted Moses Chair
Have Law perverted, and have witness given
Against their conscience, my poor life, and heaven
Against me that now must innocent dye, and shame
To after ages my disgrace proclaim.
It pleased divine providence to hearken to her request, and therefore as she
was leading to execution with a train of doleful mourners following her, the
Lord stirred up the H. Spirit of a young youth whose name was Daniel who cried
out with a loud voice; I am clear from the blood of this woman; The whole
multitude were much surprised to hear such words uttered by a young man, and
turning toward him asked what was his meaning; Upon which Daniel standing up in
the midst of them with an undaunted courage proceeded thus, Are you such fools
ye sons of Israel that without thorough examination and proof of the truth ye
have condemned a daughter of Israel? Return back into the seat of judgment and
take more strict knowledge of this cause, for though you have rashly sentenced
this fair Innocent to death, yet I am very certain that upon a more severe
scrutiny into the matter, you will find she as altogether faultless, and that
these old perjured wretches have born false witness against her.

Are ye such fools indeed
In weighty things to make such careless speed
Nay when a life's concerned; For shame my friends
See what dishonor all rash acts attends,
It makes us odious in the sight of those
Who neither God, nor yet true judgment knows
When ere the truth's discovered, or the cause;
You are so quick to execute the Laws
And upon Isreal's daughter sentence give
Who has done nothing but she still may live
Return ye then unto the Judgment Seat
Examine well, for sure the impostures great
And witnesses more false than Hell have stood
To imbrue their hands in this Chaste Ladies blood.
Whereupon all the people being astonished at the becoming confidence of Daniel
whom they judged to be a Prophet inspiried from above, turned back again in
have, and the Judges commanded him to come and sit down among them saying,
Declare to us the truth of this affair since God has bestowed the honor upon
thee to be an Elder if not in years yet in wisdom and understanding; Daniel
then ordered that the two Elders should be put asunder, and then he would
examine them apart; which being done, he called one and said unto him; O thou
wicked wretch who art even grown old in malice and iniquity, now is the time
that the villanys which thou have formerly committed are come to light, and thy
own conscience accuses thee that thou have pronounced false Judgment and have
wilfully condemned the innocent, and let the guilty go free, though the Lord
God has said, The innocent and righteous thou shall not slay; And now pray
under what tree was it that thou pretendest thou saw this chaste Lady commit
adultery? Who answered, Under a Mastick tree; Then said Daniel; Very well, thou
have now wickedly lied, and thereby forfeited thy head to Divine Justice, and
even now the Angel of God has received commission to cut thee in two; The
first being set aside, he commanded the other to be brought to whom he fiercely
said; O thou seed of Cham and not of Judah, beauty has deceived thee, and lust
has perverted thy heart, thus have you often done to other daughters of
Israel, who for fear of your power, and malicious vengeance have complied and
been polluted by you, but the virtuous Susanna would not be frightened into
wickedness, and therefore you contrived her destruction; Under what tree I
beseech you did you see the young man defile her, who answered, Under an Holm
tree; Well, said Daniel, thou also have lied against thy own life, and the
Angel of God waits with his sword to cut thee asunder and destroy thee.

Then pious Daniel to him mildly said
Even now thou have thy cursed life betrayed
Gods holy Angel has commission ta'n
Forthwith to cut thy wretched life in twain
And with a sword attends this very hour
Feirce vengeance on thy sinful head to pour
At this strange discovery the whole Assembly were amazed and cried out aloud,
glorifying and praising the name of that God who saves and delivers those that
put their trust in him, and finding these two base Elders thus notoriously
convicted of perjury out of their own mouths, they seized upon them, and
according to the Law of Moses executed the same sentence upon them, which they
maliciously and wickedly designed against this chaste Lady putting them to death
in the sight of the whole multitude, who adored the divine Justice in their
deserved punishment, which had that day so eminently appeared in saving
innocent blood, and punishing the guilty by the unexpected prudence of young
Daniel, who from that day was in much esteem and reputation among all the
people; And Chelcias and his wife gave abundant praises to Heaven for
vindicating their daughters honor, Joachim her husband and all her Friends
joining with them in thanksgivings that there was no dishonesty nor unchastity
found in her.

"O thou most worthy to be feared Great God
"Who rul'st the nations with an iron rod
"But gently do thine own Choice Israol bring
"To be refreshed at thy mercies Spring
"Our Fathers trust in thee was not mistaken
"Nor were they in their greatest wants forsaken.
"Thou heard'st Susanna's fighs and tears even when
"She stood betrayed, condemned by wicked men
"Who falsely charged her, though no stain was found
"Whereby thy faithful handmaid to confound.
"Blessed and admired always be thy name
"May after ages praise thy mighty fame;
"That to deaths door thou bring man, and then
"Proclaim'st; Return agenye sons of men
The History of the Chaste Lucretia.
Lucretia

THE Chaste Lucretia would no longer live
When wicked Tarquin basely did deprive
Her of her Chastity; Hating to be
Rather than lead her life in Infamy.
From her own hand she cold Death does embrace
Which vengeance brings on Tarquins Treacherous race
The Roman People utterly disclaim
His Power, His Family, and his hated name
The Ravisher to banishment is driven
Wheresoon his just reward he meets from Heaven
Being stain by those to whom for life he flies
Who seek revenge for former injuries.
HAving already related the Lives and Actions of four Jewish Worthies, I now
present you with a Noble Roman Lady even the chaste Lucretia, who to redeem her
honor ravished away by Sextus Tarquin, scorned to live any longer, and
therefore sacrificed her self for saving her Country; yet I cannot commend
this last and great act of her life, since the Christian Law allows none to be
their own Executioners, and the principle of self preservation seems to be
implanted in us by nature as well as in all other living creatures; However she
may serve as an example of extraordinary Chastity, which she has been reckoned
to be in all ages since, and to discover great Magnanimity of Soul, who rather
than live with shame and disgrace, chose not to live at all, and though her
mind were absolutely innocent, yet put an end to her days with her own hands
for the forcible defilement of her body.

This tragical accident happened about the year from the Creation of the World
3432. and about fix hundred years before the Birth of our Savior; It was in
the reign of Tarquinius Superbus, or Tarquin the Proud, the seventh and last
King of the Romans from Romulus the first Founder of that Kingdom which
afterward arrived to such immense grandeur; He was Surnamed the Proud because
he denied his Father-in-law and Predecessor Servius Tullius the common rites of
Burial, saying, That Romulus was never buried after his death; and killing all
the Roman Senators whom he thought Favorers of him, for having no pretense to
the Kingdom, besides force, he endeavors to maintain his Usurpation by the
same means, therefore since he could repose no trust in the love and affection
of the Citizens he was resolved to secure himself by fear, taking cognizance of
all Capital Causes alone in Person, without the advice or consent of any of the
Senators, whereby he put to death, banished, or fined any whom he thought
ill-affected to his Tyranny; He reduces the Senators to a small number that
they may be less esteemed by others, and more observant of himself; He marries
his daughter to the Latins to prevent the danger of allying her amongst his
own Friends, and increases his Guards with strangers that he might Tyrannize
over the Romans, and having by this marriage obtained much reputation among the
Latins, he desired their Nobility to meet him one day in the Florentine Wood
to treat of public affairs.

But delaying his coming at the appointed time Turnus one of the Nobility with
great liberty but small discretion made a severe Speech against him,
intimating, That the Romans might well entitle him Tarquin the Proud, since he
had now put so great an affront upon such an Illustrious Assembly, and that it
might well be suspected he designed to impose upon them, and usurp Dominion
over their Country, who could put such a slight upon the whole Nobility that
came so far only upon his request; With much more to this purpose, when in the
midst of his Oration, Tarquin arrived and endeavored to excuse his delay, but
having notice how Turnus had inveighed against him, he instantly contrived his
destruction, and that very night again calling the Latin Nobles together he in
a studied Oration strove to possess them with the belief of a dangerous design
laid by Turnus to kill him and all the Chief of the people, and having
corrupted one of the Servants of Turnus with money to let him carry a great
number of Swords into his Masters Lodgings, Tarquin told the Lords, That to
confirm what he had said, he could make it appear that Turnus had conveyed a
great quantity of Arms into his own house, wherewith he intended with the
assistance of his accomplices to massacre them all next day when they should
come to Council; Desiring them to accompany him to Turnus his house that they
might be eyewitnesses of the truth of what he had asserted; The Lords go to
his house, prepared to believe all if they found that of the Arms true; Coming
thither the Officers waked Turnus and stood round about him, having first
secured his servants who out of love to their Master were endeavoring to make
resistance, the Swords which were hid were brought forth out of every corner of
the room, which with the fierce disposition of Turnus, and the Speech he had
made the day before, seemed a full confirmation of this treacherous Design,
which so extremely incensed the Latins, that they would not suffer him to make
the least defense for himself, but presently sentenced him to lose his life by
a new kind of execution, for he was thrown into a River with an hurdle upon his
head whereon stones were piled to prevent his rising again, and by this means
was drowned.

Tarquin having again summoned a Council of the Latin Nobles commends the
revenge they had taken upon such a seditious Rebel, and desires them to renew
their League and friendship with the Romans, who were easily induced thereto,
and then commanding all the armed Youth of both Nations to meet together, he
out of both formed an Army, with which he makes war against the Volscians and
took some Towns from them by storm with a booty to the value of four hundred
Talents of Silver and Gold wherewith he designed to build a magnificent Temple
to Jupiter. After this he engaged in a War against the Gabins who inhabited a
Neighboring City which he attempted to gain by storm, but being beaten back
with great loss, he began to despair of obtaining his end by main strength, and
he solved to add policy thereto, therefore while he pretended to have laid
aside all thoughts of War, and seemed employed in the foundation of his Temple
and other stately buildings in Rome he had recourse to treacheries, wherein he
found none so fit to be employed as his youngest Son Sextus (afterward the
villainous ravisher of Lucretia) to whom he thus discourst; We have in vain O
Sextus assaulted the Gabins by power, nothing now remains but craft, which is
the second step to Greatness; Go then my Son to the Gabins, seem as if you fled
from me, accuse me of cruelty, strive to insinuate your self into their
confidence, behave your self as one of their confederates and companions, and
as you succeed you shall receive from me further instructions; Sextus
Tarquinius the wicked Son of a Tyrannical Father, was ready prepared to execute
his commands though never so impious, and Tarquin found that these perfidious
lessons were given to a Son who was expert in villainy; He obeys, flies to the
Gabins, to whom he made a grievous complaint of his Fathers intolerable cruelty
in words to this effect.

Lo here a Son O Gabins escaped from his Fathers Sword to shield himself under
the protection of his enemies; He brought me up and then designed me as a
sacrifice and oblation to his cruelty, if fathers thus turn unnatural enemies,
I hope to find my enemies a father to me in my misfortunes; He has now turned
his pride and severity from strangers to his own family, and would willingly
cause the same desolation and solitude in his own house that he has made in the
Senate; He is even weary of his Children and knows not how to be a Father
either of them or his Country; All his thirst is after blood, he covets rule
and dominion that he may kill and destroy; He desires the command of Cities
only that he may dispeople them, and would utterly exterminate the whole Senate
because it resembles a principality; He sees he has sons, and fearing they are
like himself, he dreads them because he dreads himself; The consciousness of
his own misdeeds pursues him, and he is affrighted with his own imaginations,
which represent only dreadful things to his apprehension, and thinking to
secure himself from them he commits fresh murders, and the more he imbrues his
hands in blood, that he may be thereby freed from the fear of others, he fears
himself the more; It Is safer to be Tarquins enemy than his son, that being the
only way to escape his private and malicious assassinations; Startle not O ye
Gabins at my being begot by Tarquin, Children do not always resemble their
Fathers, if so, there would be no variety in nature, and you shall find that I,
even I will revenge so many wrongs and villainies, for notwithstanding his
pretense of laying aside the War, yet he is preparing to surprise and ruin you
with the first advantage; I have escaped my Fathers Swords and Darts, and think
my self no where safe but among his adversaries, and if my unfortunate
condition can find no relief from you, I will wander over all Latium, yea over
all the Nations in the world, till I find out those who will protect innocent
Children from the cruel and unjust prosecutions of unnatural and bloody
Fathers, and whom I may persuade to engage against that proud King and his
barbarous Followers.

After this florid Oration he seemed indifferent whether they would entertain
him or not, pretending to go instantly to some other place, which made the
Gabins more ready to receive him, as they did with very great civility, telling
him, That it was no wonder Tarquin proved so unnatural to his children, since
he had been so treacherous to his own Countrymen and Allies, and that they did
believe he would at last offer violence to himself if he wanted a subject to
exercise his brutish rage upon; That Sextus his coming to them was very
grateful, and they hoped by his assistance to carry the War in a short time
from their own City to the very Walls of Rome. After this he was admitted into
their public Councils, wherein he expressed a singular modesty in referring all
things to the Judgment of the most ancient Counselors, only he much approved
of the continuance of the War, wherein he said, he pretended to the greatest
knowledge as being sensible of the strength of both people, and that the pride
of Tarquin must needs be very hateful to his subjects since his own Children
were not able to endure it; By such discourses as these he provoked them to
continue the War, and went with the most active Youth to forage the Country,
where in several small Skirmishes he came off with so good success that he
thereby gained such reputation as to be made General of their Army, in which
office he still got more credit, for in all the bickerings between the Romans
and Gabins he generally had the better, so that the whole people thought him
sent to them as a blessing from Heaven; For his despising of dangers, and
activity in every place of difficulty, but especially his freeness in
distributing all the booty, gained him so much love, and engaged the hearts of
the people to him that his authority among the Gabins was no less powerful than
his Father Tarquins among the Romans.

Having proceeded thus far in his traitorous design, and judging himself strong
enough to carry on his purpose, he sends a Messenger to his Father to signify
what he had done, and to receive further directions, since Heaven had so
ordered it that he could act what he pleased among the Gabins; The Messenger
being not thought faithful enough, Tarquin sent no positive answer by him, but
taking him into the garden as if to consult what message to return, the King
walked silently along, and with his staff cut off the heads of the highest
Poppies; The Messenger weary of expecting an answer withdrew, and hastened back
to Sextus, telling him, That whether out of anger, hatred, or natural pride he
had not sent him a word in return, but only as he walked in the garden he with a
stick struck off the heads of the highest Poppies. Sextus quickly apprehends
these dumb signs, and thereby understands his wicked Fathers mind, and soon
after causes the Chief men of the City to be put to death by accusing some to
the people, and stirring up others out of envy to ruin their fellow Citizens,
many were executed publicly and diverse against whom he could prove nothing
murdered privately; Some fled their Country, others were banished, and all
their Estates, as well as those put to death, distributed among the people, who
for the sweetness of the booty and the particular profit they received, lost
the sense of their public misfortunes, and were laid asleep from whence they
never awaked till they were deprived both of counsel and power and the Gabine
Liberty was at an end; The City being at length surrendered by this Subtle
Stratagem to the King of Rome without the least bloodshed or resistance.

After this Tarquin makes peace with the rest of his Neighbors, and then
applies his mind to City affairs resolving to finish the Temple of Jupiter he
had begun, which being with the help of many hands in a short time finished, he
next imploys the people it some other public works, which whilst they were
intent upon a great prodigy appears, a Serpent (...) seen to come out of a
Pillar of Wood; which much affrighted Tarquin and his whole Court, filling his
breast with such anxious thoughts that he could not rest till he was satisfied
what it did portend; There fore though in other strange accidents, he used only
the judgment of his own Country Diviners, yet i^ this extraordinary case, he
resolved to consult the oracle of Delphos, then the most famous upon earth* He
therefore sends his two elder Sons, Titus and A^ron to the oracle who take with
them as their companion Lucius Junius Brutus the son of Tarquinia h^^ Sister,
whom he had not only suffered to live after having slain his brother, but as a
fate permitted hi^ to keep company with his Sons.

This young man having heard that the Chief of t^^ City were murdered by his
Uncle, resolved to give him no occasion of fear from any designs of his, and
knowing there was no greater safety under the Tyrant, than to be scorned and
neglected, since Law and Justice gave little security, he that none might covet
his fortune, industriously feigned himself a fool or mad man, which was much
assisted by his natural inclination to melancholy, permitting the King to
dispose of his Person and Estate as he thought fit, nay did not refuse the
Surname of Brutus (that is Foolish or Sottish) though under this title he
concealed a noble Soul which afterward discovered it self in delivering the
Roman people from slavery; At the last Scene he unmasks himself and every one
then commends him when they consider him, because they did not understand him
till the end of the Tragedy. The Sons of Tarquin take this dull Brutus along
with them to Delphos only for sport and divertisement, though it is said he
then secretly carried a golden staff, enclosed in one of Wood, as a present to
Apollo, which was a sign of his ingenuity; They come to the Oracle, and having
made known their Fathers desires, the young men were very earnest to make
inquiry of the succession, and to which of them the Roman kingdom should fall,
whereupon, they say, a voice ascended from the bottom of the Cave saying, He
among you three shall have the chief dominion in Rome who gives his Mother the
first kiss; The two brothers agreed to conceal this answer from Sextus the
youngest then at Rome, lest he should prevent them, and to commit it to fortune
by Lot, which of them should first kiss their Mother when they arrived, but
Brutus who knew the answers of oracles were seldom very clear, but full of a
thousand ambiguities, imagining there might be some other meaning in it,
pretending to fall by chance, kissed the earth which he considered was the
common Mother of all men living

They return to Rome with the answer to their Father, whom they find engaged in
War against the Rutilians a rich people, and besieging Ardea, with whose Spoils
the Tyrant hoped to engage the affections of the Romans, who grew very insolent
and uneasy, for being made so long Carpenters and Masons. They first attacked
the City by storm, but being repulsed, laid a formal Siege thereto, which made
the Campaign more tedious than dangerous, so that the Officers had leisure
enough to treat and entertain one another; The Kings Sons and kinsmen often
feasted each other, particularly one night they were drinking together with
Sextus, where Collatinus Tarquinius the Son of Egerius being in company, there
grew a contention among them concerning their wives each extolling his own
above the rest, from whence a quarrel arising Collatinus said, there need no
dispute in the case, since it might easily be known how far his Lucretia
excelled the rest; Therefore said he; It is in vain to talk, but if you have
any vigor in you, let us mount our Horses and go see with our own eyes what
kind of lives our wives lead in our absence, and that shall be the test of
their virtue according as each man shall find her employed at his sudden
arrival. They were all heated with Wine and therefore cried unanimously, Come
on, it is agreed, and so galloped to Rome, and arriving toward evening went
thence to Collatia, where they found Lucretia not like the rest of the Kings
daughters in Law, whom they saw feasting and rioting among their companions,
but fitting up late at night in the midst of her women spinning and dividing
out their work; They all grant her the Victory, and with one voice commend her
above their own; She received her husband and the rest very kindly, and
Collatine having thus got the conquest, treated the Royal Youths with a Noble
banquet; At supper a base lust surprizeth Sextus, and her beauty and chastity
raising a furious desire in him to enjoy her, he resolves to compass his wicked
intent with the utmost hazard, for the look of a lascivious man is like that of
a Basilisk, it kills Chastity with beholding it; Having ended their Juvenile
pastimes for that night, the next morning they all returned to the Camp.

Not long after Sextus who could find no rest in his mind till he had fulfilled
his unlawful desires, takes a full resolution to perpetrate that wicked Act,
and without giving notice to any he secretly returns to Collatia, where he was
received and treated with all kind of civility by the innocent Lucretia, who
little imagined upon what impious design he made her that visit, but welcomed
him with all manner of sweetness as the Friend and Companion of her beloved
husband; After supper he was conducted to his Chamber, but so inflamed with
love that sleep was the least thing he desired or intended, he revolves in his
thoughts the hazard, and treachery of this dishonorable attempt, and yet
sometimes seems to flatter himself with success from the free treatment of this
chaste soul.

Quoth he, she took me kindly by the hand
And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes
Fearing some bad news from the Warlike Band
Where her beloved Collatinus lies.
O how her fear did make her color rise
Nor could she put off this her trembling fear
Until her husbands welfare she did hear.
At length taking courage, he rises from his uneasy bed, and having observed
where Lucretia lay, he opens the doors and enters her Chamber whom he found
fast asleep, and approaching the bed with his drawn Sword, he lays his hand
upon her breast, and has recourse to the instruments of hatred for his
assistance in love; he who was wont to vent his angry passions against his
enemies with his Sword, knows not how to lay it aside in prosecuting the most
tender passion; At this rude approach the poor affrighted Lucretia awaked, and
finding him in this dreadful posture and her self in so dangerous a state; she
was extremely amazed, when the villainous Ravisher thus addressed her, Lucretia,
said he, Hold your peace, I am Sextus Tarquin, speak not a word, for if you do
this Sword shall instantly end your life; He then proceeded to declare his
transcendant passion for her, and uses all manner of inducements to bring her
to his will, tells her, That her beauty is the cause of this misfortune, that
he had considered the fatal event of it, but yet had rather endure the greatest
torments, yea death it self, than not to fulfill his desire, says he, I have
debated even in my Soul
What wrong, what shame, what sorrow it will breed,
But nothing can my furious Love control
Or stop the headlong current of its speed.
Although repentant Tears ensue the deed
Together with reproach and enmity
Yet I must needs embrace my infamy.


He speaks her fair and then intermixes threats, but seeing her readier to
embrace death than him, rather willing to lose her life than honor, he adds
disgrace to fear, and tells her he would first kill her and then stab a slave
and lay him naked by her, so that it should be certainly believed she was slain
in the very act of adultery.

Lucrece, says he, this night I must enjoy thee
If thou deny then force must work my way.
For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee
And then some wretched slave of thine i will slay
To kill thine honor with thy lives decay.
And in thy dead arms I resolve to place him
And swear I slew him finding thee embrace him.
See how this villain threatens to bereave her of her honor, that he may
thereby bereave her of it; Lucretia thus assaulted makes many compassionate
pleas in defense of her chastity, upbraids him with his unreasonable and
brutish lust, adjures him by all manner of Arguments not to use violence
against a poor weak woman, but nothing she could say had the least influence
upon him.

She him conjures by fear of Heaven above
By her untimely tears, her husbands love,
Quoth she, "Reward not hospitality
"And Friendship, with such wicked treachery
"Think but how vile a spectacle it were
"Did thy crime in another man appear
"If ever man was moved with woman's moans
"Be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans,
"Melt at my tears and be compassionate
"Some pity enters at an iron gate
"Thou seem not what thou art, a God, a King.
"For Kings like Gods should govern every thing.
Have done, quoth he, my uncontroulled tide
Turns not, but swells the higher by this let,
Small lights are soon blown out, huge fires abide
And with the wind in greater fury fret.
And putting his words into act he first gagged, and then ravished her
notwithstanding the utmost resistance she could possible use, so that she
forcibly yielded to Sextus prevailing lust, who having obtained his will goes
away over-joyed, and returns to the Camp Triumphant, while the most unhappy
Lucretia remains overwhelmed with grief; She sends to her Father Spurius
Lucretius, and her husband, that they would instantly repair to Collatia with
two or three of their most assured Friends, since a most unfortunate and
grievous accident had befallen her; They make speed to come, and bring Publius
Valerius and Lucius Junius Brutus along with them; They find Lucretia in a very
desolate condition, who upon their coming into her Chamber burst out into a
flood of Tears; Her husband asked her; art thou not well my Dear, No said she,
how can that woman be well who has lost her Chastity, the signs of another man
O dear Collatine are yet to be seen upon the bed, yet is my body only violated,
my mind is still guiltless of which my death shall be an undoubted evidence,
but first give me your hands and solemn promises that you will not suffer the
Adulterer to go unpunished, Sextus Tarquin is the man, who like an enemy rather
than a Guest came last night armed to my bed, and thence forced pleasures,
which if you are men of courage may prove as fatal to him as they are like to
be to me; They all one after another engaged to revenge the injury she had
received, and endeavored to comfort and persuade her grieved soul that she was
altogether innocent, and the guilt lay only upon the Ravisher, and that her
mind (not her body) could only commit the offense, and where was no consent
there was no crime; Do you, says she, consider what the Ravisher deserves? for
though I absolve my self from the crime, yet I will not be free from the
punishment; Nor shall any unchaste woman ever plead hereafter that Lucretia was
an Example of lendness to her. And then proceeded to this purpose.

And what could unfortunate Lucretia do? If she had died that she might have
lived Chaste, you would have thought her slain for having been unchaste; O most
cruel Law of Honor, which savest not the innocent! A Law never descended from
Heaven but came from the deepest Abyss of Hell, I who would have my honesty
proclaimed to all, have more studied glory than chastity, and whilst I was
ambitious of the name of Chaste, I am with infamy become unchaste, I was enforced
to choose life that I might preserve my honor, and by my living I have lost it;
I am resolved to dye if not for what has already befallen me, at least for
what may hereafter happen to me; But what then? If I die I shall seem to
acknowledge I have done amiss; they will say my guilty conscience killed me; If
I live you will believe I have done so too and say I consented out of two much
love of life, O of all others the most unfortunate Lucretia, whose innocence
neither life nor death can justify. This Soul (O Collatine) whose delight was
chastity abhors now that body which is polluted, and as being wholly thine
cannot endure to have any longer a being since I can no more be only thine. The
wicked Ravisher did never prostitute me, it was not Lucretia it was a Carcass,
for the Soul is not where it consents not, sin is the offspring of the will
not of the body, where consent is not there is no sin, yet I think my self
worthy of death 'cause he desired, and blame my self though faultless because I
pleased him; O Beauty perniciously coveted by our unsound minds! O frail and
fading vanity of the body whereby the eternal beauty of the Soul is clouded!
they which are endowed with you either sin with you, or cause others to sin by
you. But what was there in me that encouraged this vile miscreant to commit so
great a crime? perhaps my honesty which he thought greater than others; Most
sacred Honesty art thou then become an incitement to lust? and instead of
defending do thou offend? Instead of bridling unlawful desires, do thou
provoke to fury and violence? His cruel heart that delights only to kill the
innocent, is likewise a receptacle of wicked lust that covets none but the
Chaste; To attain what they desire is not that which the Tarquins desire, they
find no pleasure where they use no force, and like lightning rend and destroy
most where they meet most resistance; And whither can unfortunate Lucretia go
for revenge? To the Kings Family? It is they have injured me; To my own
Friends? It is I have injured them. O ye Gods of Hospitality, it is you I call
upon, but to what purpose call I on you since you have permitted it? Revenge me
you Infernal Powers, but why invoke I you, since you were his assistants in
this horrid crime? I my self will revenge my self, and will by my own death
take greater vengeance on this my Enemy than by living. I will dye not to
lessen my own faults, but to aggravate his villainy, not because I have sinned,
but to show that she did not subject her self to sense, who voluntarily
deprives her self of sense. I will die that I may not live in such wretched
times that make life a shame, and to be born is the greatest misfortune, my
fall shall ease your thoughts, and make my revenge happy, and I who will not
live an example of dishonor to Women will die an example of courage to men.

Ah poor Lucretia! what a cruel Guest
Did thou receive? How was thy House unblest
And by mistake how sadly did thou prove
Thy Table fed a Serpent not a Dove
As she uttered these last words she plunged a knife into her breast and fell
down dead thereon; Her Father and Husband surprised at this sudden stroke set
out a loud cry, Daughter, Dear Daughter, old Lucretius cries
That life was mine which thou have here deprived
If in the Child the Fathers Image lies
Where shall I live now Lucreece is unliv'd?


Collatinus her husband seconds these Lamentations, My Dear Lucretia, in whose
breast does lie
My Life, is fled unto Eternity,
She Is dead, She Is dead and Oh! if that were all
In time I might endeavor to recall
My Grief; but she is (ah what I speak's too true)
Ravished by Death, ay and by Tarquin too.


Brutus while they where full of grief drew forth the bloody knife out of
Lucretia's wound and said; I swear by this blood which was so chaste before the
wicked Ravisher stained it (and ye Gods be ye all witnesses of my vow and
resolution) that I will endeavor to extirpate Tarquin the proud, his wife, and
all his Race with sword, fire or any other violent means that I have power to
use, nor will suffer them nor any other King to have any Authority or Dominion
in Rome; At these words Collatine and Lucretius the husband and Father, and
likewise Valerius, were even astonished to see the dull disposition of Brutus
so soon altered, they therefore threaten nothing but revenge, and their Laments
are turned into indignation, resolving to follow the resolutions of Brutus who
thus incited them to endeavor to root out the wicked Family of the Tarquins
from among them.

In prosecution whereof they carried the body of the bleeding Lucretia into the
Market place, where they endeavored to inflame the people with the prefence of
so dismal an object, which occasioned every one to exclaim against the cruelty
and violence of the Tarquins, yet had not this woeful sight nor the doleful
cries of her Father and husband so much effect upon them as the earnest
excitations of Brutus who with all manner of eloquence and zeal persuaded them
to act as became men, and Romans, who were sollicitous for the liberty of their
Country, by taking Arms against their common Enemy. Upon which the brisk young
men immediately assembled ready armed and having left sufficient Guards at the
Gates of Collatia to prevent any Intelligence from going to Tarquin, the rest
followed Brutus their Commander to Rome, where being arrived the people of that
City were much alarmed, and seeing such considerable Persons command them,
thought it was no rash attempt they had undertaken; So that the multitude
running from all parts to the Market place, the Crier summoned them to appear
before the Tribune, which Office Brutus himself at that time happened to bear;
Being assembled he made a very ingenious and pathetick speech to them, wherein
he discovered much more sense and understanding than he had ever before
pretended to, in words to this effect; Most Noble Romans, will you still suffer
this ravenous, cruel, lustful tyrant? To what end do you bring up your Sons? To
what purpose do you give education to your daughters? Wherefore do you heap up
riches? for a Cruel wretch which will kill your Sons, for a Lascivious Tyrant
to debauch your daughters, for an avaritious taskmaster who will rob you of
your wealth; If you bear with Tarquin or any of his Race in hopes they may
amend, it is vanity; If because you fear him, it is madness; A Tyrant is a
Monster who is by nature intended only for a scourge to men and therefore none
can be safe under him, he equally fears and hates both good and wicked men, and
despises lukewarmness and indifferency; What is it you expect? perhaps the old
kings death; Who can imagine the Sons will be better than the Father; Their
tempers are composed of the blood of two wicked ones; They are educated by a
Tyrant, born in the proud commanding family of the Tarquins, and therefore like
to be altogether as insupportable as their parents. Tarquins lust is not
extinguished by Lucretias death, 'twill be more raging if it remain unpunish't,
the calamities of other persons may be a lesson to you, and he who can learn by
others harms though he may want experience, yet he is certainly more happy; Let
your bosoms then be no more exposed to the loss of blood, for increasing the
grandeur and dominion of that City which belongs to another; And for which you
will be rewarded with nothing but blood and wounds; Are you not aware that you
conquer Nations only to reduce them under Tarquins tyranny? That by bringing
others into bondage you make your own slavery the greater; No longer then
suffer your hands which were formerly accustomed to noble deeds and to bring
home glorious Triumphs for adorning your Capitol, to be basely employed in
emptying Vaults, and removing Uncleanness; Courage! Noble Citizens, deceive
your selves no longer through ignorance of your own power, but henceforth learn
to know your own strength, delay no longer in such an enterprise wherein
delaying may be your ruin; Now you have one to lead, you need not fear to want
followers, all men's wills are alike opposite to Tyrants, only few are so daring
as to begin, I will be your Head to drive out Tarquin, I will be your companion
in forming your liberty, I will be the first in danger and the last in
happiness.

Brutus his words make a sudden impression upon the People, and he who would
have them follow him need use no other enchantment but the name of Liberty,
which carries an universal influence with it though very few truly understand
what it is; The incensed multitude unanimously resolve to abrogate Tarquins
power and banish him with his Wife and Children; Whilst Brutus and his youthful
Volunteers went to Ardea to inflame the Army against the King, He having notice
of these mutinous practices at Rome hastened thither but found the Gates shut
against him, and defiance proclaimed to him and all his Family whom they
declared to be banished from ever having any command in the Government for the
future; Brutus mean while arrived another way at the Camp, where having fully
informed them of all passages he was received with extreme Joy as the deliverer
of their City by expelling thence the Tyrant and his Children.

Tarquin much surprised at this unexpected turn of fortune, retires toward the
Tuscans for security, and his son Sextus Tarquin the Ravisher, and unhappy
cause of the ruin of his Family flies to the Gabins where he breaths forth
nothing but revenge and discontent.

Must I be banished then into a place
Of no Society, and there embrace
Perpetual woe? Oh! how could hell contrive
So great a plague to keep me still alive
What shall I do in this extreme Abiss
Of woe and torments? Death had been a bliss
Beyond expression; Ah! must wretched I
Be so acurst to offend, and yet not die
But stay, shall I forget? Was I not born
A noble Roman and shall I not scorn
Their impositions? Shall I now relent
And prove a willing slave to discontent?
Courage my heart, be bold and let them find
Thou have an Army in thy valiant mind.
Ah what a sad companion is a heart
Burdened with guilt? Alas! I can impart
No comfort to my self, all things declare
My ruin, that is attended with despair
Methinks I have a still continued flood
Before my eyes of chaste Lucretia's blood,
Nor is my eye disturbed alone, my ear
Is grown of late accustomed to hear
Strange Dialects, methinks Lucretia cries
Revenge, Revenge my woeful injuries.
And thus my eyes and ears sadly portend
A present woe, a miserable end,
Lucretia, ah Lucretia thou did find
A body rape't; but I a ravished mind.
Neither were these forebodings of Sextus Tarquin vain, for though he had lost
that power and reputation among the Gabins which made him to be feared and
esteemed, yet thinking himself rather beloved by them than only tolerated, not
having lost those qualities which he thought desirable, he returns to them, as
unto his own Kingdom, but found his reputation much sunk with his fortune, for
he was soon after slain by certain Persons who resolved by his death to revenge
the ancient quarrels he himself by slaughter and rapine had been the Author of
Brutus and his Companions imposed an Oath upon all the Roman People not to
suffer any of the Tarquins to reign at Rome, and was so enraged against them
that some time after he beheaded diverse Noble Youths, among whom were foam of
his own and his Sisters Sons, for conspiring to restore the Regal race again;
And Tarquin himself after several unsuccessful attempts to regain his kingdom,
dyed a banished man at Cumae after he had reigned twenty five years, the Roman
People being after governed by Consuls. All this desolation of the Tarquins,
and the stupendous alterations which followed being chiefly occasioned by the
Rape of our gallant and Chaste Heroine Lucretia.

The History of Voadicia Queen of Britain.
depiction of Boadicea, Queen of Britain

THe Noble Voadicia whose hard fate
Subjected her unto the Roman State
Over which the bloody Nero did command
And cruel thraldom brought upon her Land.
Her countrymen does gallantly incite
That for their Ravished freedoms they would fight
And that her self will their Commander be
And venture all, that their lost liberty
They may redeem; And to fulfill her word
Her utmostaid she does to them afford
Discomfiting their Roman Enemies
Then bravely in the bed of Honor dies.
THe next instance of Feminine Valor is a Lady of our own Nation called
Voadicia Queen of Britain in the time of the Roman Government here, the bloody
Tyrant Nero being then Emperor; But because I am willing to take all occasions
to inform my Countrymen of whatever may be useful to them concerning their own
Nation, I shall therefore relate what is written by some ancient Authors of the
Original Inhabitants of this renowned Island, of which they may have heard some
imperfect account, but are ignorant of what has been recorded of them, though
as to the certainty and credibility of these relations so far distant from us
in time, every man is left to his own belief.

Though the beginning of this as well as all other Nations is doubtful, yet
some writers of great Antrquity are of opinion that this Island was formerly
part of the continent and joined to France, but afterward divided either by
some mighty inundation or dreadful Earthquake, but to let this pass, John Bale
our Countreyman and a diligent searcher into such obsolete Histories does
probably conjecture that this Land was inhabited and replenished with People
before Noah's flood, when the Scripture says, That men began to multiply upon
the face of the Earth; After the flood Noah was the sole Monarch of all the
world, which he divided among his sons, assigning to Shem the eldest all that
part now called Asia; to his second son Cham, Africa, and to Japhet his third,
Europe, with the Isles thereto belonging and ours among the rest; He is said to
have died in Mauritania and by confent of the Greek and Latin writers first
peopled Europe which he after left to his Children, Tubal having the Kingdom of
Spain; Gomer, Italy, and Samothes Celtica, containing Germany, France and
Britain. Thus was this Nation peopled two hundred years after the Deluge, and
we read in Genesis that in the time of Peieg the offspring of Japhet inhabited
the Isles of the Gentiles of which Britain is one. Samothes is reported to
excel in learning and knowledge which he imparted to his people in the
Phenician Language and Letters, from whence his Followers were called
Samotheans, who says Aristotle were skillful in the Law of God and man. Magus
his Son succeeded who built many Cities in Germany and Britain, whose names
then bore the addition of their Founder as Neomagus now Chester, Niomagus now
Buckingham with diverse others; The name is applied by the Persians to their
Priests or Magicians, who were called Magi from their skill in Magic, as the
Poet Mantuan intimates.

Ille penes Persas Magus est qui fidera novit, etc.
The Persians him a Magi call
Who the Stars course does know
The power of Herbs; and what worship
Man unto God does owe.
By threefold knowledge thus the name
Of Magus then did grow.
Sarron his Son was his Successor who founded certain public places for
Professors of Learning and Moral Philosophy, without whose assistance the
people were taught not to sacrifice to their Gods as reckoning them skilful in
divine Mysteries, and near to God, by whose intercession they expected all the
good they required, and whose advice they followed both in peace and war. Druis
was his Successor, both in his Dominions and Wisdom from whom proceeded the
famous Sect called Druides, many of whom went hence into Gallia, now France,
and other Countries, they had their residence in the Isle of Anglesey; These
says J. Caesar in his Commentaries, had the office of sacrificing, of
discussing points in Religion, of educating youth, determining differences,
with full power to exclude those from Sacrifice who disobeyed their precepts
and sentence; To make the people valiant they strove to arm them against the
fear of death by teaching, That men's Souls could not dye but passed out of one
body into another; They were likewise Astrologers, and not altogether ignorant
of one Eternal and Almighty God; All their Learning was written in the Greek
Tongue of which the British language retains many words to this day; But as
all things degenerate so these Druides in time grew very barbarous, for they
use to stab men to death, and by their falling, bleeding, or dismembring
pretended to foretell things to come, for which and many other wicked practices
this Sect was extirpated in Gallia, and long after in Britain by King Lucius
when he had received the Gospel.

Bardus the Son of Druis succeeded, and was much admired by his People for
inventing Songs and Music, and such as excelled therein he constituted into an
Order of Philosophical Poets or Heralds, calling them by his own name Bards,
and J. Caesar reports he found some of them here at his arrival; Their business
was to record the noble exploits of their valiant Captains in Songs and
Ditties, which they sung to their Instruments at the solemn Feasts of their
Grandees, and were so highly esteemed that when two Armies were even ready to
engage if a Bard had stepped between, both Parties would have held their hands
(to hear his advice,) till he were out of danger, of whom Lucan thus sings, Vos
quoque qui fortes animas belloque peremptus, etc.
Then you brave Bards securely sung
The Praises of dead Peers.
In lofty strains so to prolong
Their Fame for many years.


And because these Poets were neither repugnant to the Roman civility nor the
Christian Religion they alone above all other Sects were suffered to continue
long after the birth of Christ, nay some report there are many of them to be
found in Wales to this day still called Barthes, and an Island near that
Country is named Bardsey upon that account.

After Bardus death the people neglecting the Laws of their Predecessors and
falling into Luxury were easily subjected by Albion the Giant, said to be the
Son of Neptune the Sea God and the same with Naphthuim (mentioned by Moses) the
Son of Cham, who had by his wife Amphitrea four Sons to each of whom he gave an
Island; Albion the youngest landed in England which he quickly subdued,
arriving in light Ships covered over with beasts skins, and called the Country
by his own name, so that the race of the Samotheans being extinguished the
Succession was changed from the Family of Japhet to that of cursed Cham; Having
named the Isle Albion, he and his Companions were called Giants, though not as
some think from their stature, which yet was much larger than now, but Gigantes
or Sons of the Earth, many huge bones discovered in our age demonstrating that
they were much taller than we are now; As Albion conquered Britain so his
Brother Berguin commanded in Ireland and the Orkneys; These two had notice that
the Great Hercules their Cozen after he had subdued Spain resolved to pass into
Italy against their Brother Lestrigo to revenge the murder of his Father
Osyris, whom these Sons of Cham had slain, though he was their uncle, as being
Brother to Neptune, and to add to their barbarity had divided his carcass each
preserving a piece of his flesh as a monument of their victory; Upon this
account Hercules whom ( Moses calls Laabin) proclaiming War against them,
having first destroyed the Tyrants Tryphon and Busiris in Egypt, Anteus in
Mauritania, and the Gerions in Spain, he leads his Armies thence toward Italy,
both the Brothers joined to oppose him, and near Rhodanus a terrible Battle was
fought, wherein Hercules doubting of success his Soldiers having spent all
their arrows, he commanded them to throw stones, (whereof there were plenty) at
their enemies, by which they obtained an entire victory, killing Albion and
Berguin in the field with most of their Forces which made the Poets feign that
Jupiter assisted his Son Hercules by throwing down stones from Heaven.

Albion being thus slain, the people at home having no Governor fell into all
kind of disorders and seemed to differ little from wild beasts till the arrival
of the daughters of Danaus, of whom ancient Historians give this Account. Belus
the son of Epaphus had two sons Danaus and Egyptus; both Kings of Egypt, Danaus
ruled the upper Region, and by diverse wives had fifty daughters, and his
brother Egyptus happened likewise to have 50 sons, who desiring the Dominion of
the whole Country, earnestly required the daughters to be married to his sons;
But Danaus having notice by an Oracle, That he should receive his death by a
son in law, refused the proposal, whereupon his brother made War upon him and
drove him out of his Kingdom, who imbarquing himself and his daughters in some
small Boats, arrived in Greece, and dispossessing Gelenor King of Argos of his
Realm by the assistance of his own subjects who hated him, he reigned there
with so much glory that the Greeks were after called Danai from his name;
Egyptus his brother vexed that he should escape, sent his Sons with a great Army
to pursue their uncle, with commission not to return till they had either slain
Danaus, or obtained his daughters in marriage; who thereupon coming into Greece
were so successful that he was forced to give them up, and married they were,
but Danaus bent upon revenge, gave every one a dagger charging them after their
husbands were asleep to kill them all, and that he would certainly be the death
of her who should refuse; They all obey his will but Hypermenestra, over whom
love prevailed more than fear of her Fathers severity, who awake't her husband
Lynceus, and advising him to fly back to Egypt for safety; Danaus having notice
of the disobedience of Hypermenestra resolved to have put her to death but was
hindered by the Argives yet kept her close Prisoner. He then endeavored to get
husbands for his daughters, but they were so abhored for their treachery, that
it was hard to procure them.

Lynceus arriving safe in Egypt, his Father was so incensed at the murder of
his other sons that he sent him back with strong Forces against his uncle, who
prevailed and soon dispatched him, setting his wife at liberty, and subduing the
whole Kingdom of the Argives, and then sending for Danaus daughters he judged
them not worthy to live for their cruelty, yet being his wives sisters he would
not put them to death but commanded they should be put into a Ship without
Sails or Oars, and so left to the mercy of the wide Ocean; Who after many
dangers were at length cast happily upon this Isle of Albion, where getting
ashore, and seeking for food by hunting Deer, they met with some of the
Inhabitants, who were rude and Savage Giants, living more like Devils than men,
yet finding no others they had commerce with them, from whom proceeded a
generation not unlike their Parents, yet none of these Ladys were named Albina
as some conjecture, so that the Island was called Albion from the Giant
aforementioned.

And thus you have the History of the Inhabitants of this land before Brute of
which you may judge as you please; I now proceed to Brutes arrival hither, of
whom we find recorded, that he was the son of Julius whose Father was Aeneas of
Troy; So that the Abionists being gone off the stage, the Trojans next
succeeded; Brute being about twenty five years old was hunting with his Father
in the Forest whom by misfortune he killed with an arrow in shooting at a
Deer, for which he was banished his Country of Italy and in the company of
several young Trojans arrived in Greece, where they found diverse of their
Countrymen in slavery, who joining with them they took several Forts and
Castles, and then sent a Letter to Pandrasus the King of the Country to this
effect.

Brute Leader of the remnant of the Trojan people to Pandrasus King of the
Greeks sends greeting; Because several of the Noble blood of Dardanus have
received high affronts, and have not been treated according to their merits,
therefore they have chosen to live freely in woods and Forests rather than
comply with the pride of ungrateful men, and have contented themselves with
herbs and raw flesh to avoid the yoke of thraldom which they must otherwise be
subject to; And if this course of life offend your Highness, yet they are not
to be blamed but pardoned since every Captive Slave desires to be restored to
his former freedom and liberty. If then you have any compassion for our
condition, suffer us to remain quietly within these woods which we have got
into our possession, and if not then suffer us quietly to depart out of your
Country into some other place.

Pandrasus was much furprized with their Letter and request, but considering
their small number, he resolved to root them out, before they should increase,
and marching with his Forces to that purpose, as he passed near the Town
Sparatinum toward the Woods, Brute suddenly issued out thence with three
thousand men, and assaulted them with such fury that they fled, hoping to save
themselves in the adjoining River of Akalon, but were so hotly pursued that
many were drowned; Antigonus the Kings brother made a stand with some Grecians
hoping to renew the battle, but the Trojans pressing on them, took him Prisoner
slaying and dispersing the rest; After which Brute put 600 men into the Town,
and returning to the rest in the woods was received with extreme joy; Pandrasus
vexed at his ill success raised another Army wherewith he came before the Town,
in hope to have taken it by storm, but Brutes men held it very valiantly till
wanting provisions they sent to him for speedy relief, who being too weak to
engage in open Field, came suddenly in the night upon the Kings Camp, being
directed by a Prisoner he had taken where to make the easiest approach, so that
he encountered them with much advantage and overthrow their whole Forces taking
Pandrasus himself Prisoner, whereby the War was ended and soon after an
absolute peace concluded, by which The King was obliged to give Brute his
daughter Innogen in marriage, with a sufficient Dowry in gold and silver; To
furnish him and his people with a Navy of Ships well provided of all
necessarys, and Lastly, That they should freely depart the Country whither
they pleased to seek adventures; This being performed, Brute with his wife and
people imbarqued, and after two days sail arrived at an Island called Leogitia
(now unknown to modern Geographers) where they consulted with an Oracle, or
Idol of Diana, Brute kneeling and holding a bowl of Wine prepared for sacrifice
in his right hand, and the Blood of a white Hind in the other, thus addressed
himself to the Goddess.

Diva potens nemorum, terror Sylvestribus apis etc.
Thou Goddess that in Woods
And Groves do take delight
Who do pursue the foaming Boar
That flies thy dreadful sight
Thou who do soar aloft
And glidest through the Sky
Who div'st into the dismal Cells
That in dark earth do lie.
Declare to us our Fate,
Direct us in our way
Where we may habitations find
And where to make our stay.
Where thou desire we
Temples to thee should build
Where Virgins may thy Praises sing
Who are in Music skilled.
After this Prayer and performing the Ceremonies of Pagan Superstition, Brute
expecting an answer chanced to fall asleep; when the Goddess appearing made him
this return.

Brute sub occasum solis, trans Gallia regna, etc.
Brute farther west, beyond
The Gallic shore is found
A noble Island which the Sea
Does quite incompass round.
Where Giants once did dwell
But now are rooted out
There Is room enough to plant thy self
And all thy warlike Rout.
Sail thither then with speed
Possess it as thy due
A lasting seat for thee and thine
Where Troy shall rise anew.
Kings of thy Noble Race
In after times shall rise
Who all the world shall conquer, and
Their Fame shall reach the Skies.
Having thus Complemented the Lady, and received this gentle answer in the same
language he courted her; Brute when he awak't remembered his Dream, and began to
question whether it were a Vision, or the real Advice of the Goddess who had
thus spoken to him with Humane Voice; whereupon consulting his Companions it
was unanimously concluded to be the counsel of the Divine Oracle, at which
there was much rejoicing, and bonefires made wherein wine, milk and other
superstitious ingredients were thrown, which done they instantly went a
shipboard in hope of the promised success, and sailing westward arrived at the
streights of Gibarlter., where on the Spanish Coasts they met with another
company of Trojans who were descended from Antenor after his escape from the
Siege of Troy; Their Captain was called Corineus a man of great wisdom and
valor, with whom upon consideration of their Country they joined and made one
entire body, these new comers adventuring their Fortunes with them; Sailing
Eastward they came to the mouth of the River Loyre in France, and landed in the
Dominions of a King called Goffarius Pictus because his people painted their
faces and bodies wherein consisted their gallantry, and the Country from
thence (it is thought) is called Poictou to this day (part of Scotland being
named Pictland upon the same account) Goffarius having notice of their arrival
sent to know how they durst presume to come into his Land without license; The
Messengers addressed themselves to Corineus whom they found with two hundred of
his Company that came with him from the Ships, hunting Venison in a Forest for
sustaining their lives and gi^^ng Corineus some disdainful words he endeavored
to appease them, when Imbert their Chief suddenly let fly an arrow at him,
which Corineus soon returned with such force that it clave his head in sunder,
whereat the rest of the Poictovins fled and brought the news to Goffarius, who
instantly raised a mighty Army, wherewith he marched to encounter the Trojans,
between whom a sharp battle was fought, but in the end Brute by the admirable
courage of Corineus obtained the Victory, and Goffarius fled further up into
Gallia or France endeavoring to incite all his Neighbor Princes to join with
him in this common danger; Brute mean time marched forward destroying all before
him with Fire and Sword, and having got great booty carried it to his Ships;
Goffarius and his Confederates with mighty forces resolving to revenge these
injuries came suddenly upon the Trojans, being thirty times as many, and
assaulted them often in their Camp with so much fury and such inequality of
numbers that they besieged them therein, hoping by famine to compel them to
yield to mercy.

In this extremity Corineus and Brute resolved to use some stratagem for their
deliverance, and the next night Corineus drawing three thousand choice men out
of the Camp into a wood that lay on the back of the enemy, in the morning Brute
fell upon them furiously in the front, when at the same time Corineus
assaulting them courageously on the Rear they were so surprised and confounded
that they instantly fled, whom the Trojans eagerly pursued with great
slaughter, Brute lost many of his men in this battle, and among others his
Nephew Turnus from whom, it is said, the City of Tours in France, which Brute
built, took its name and was called Turonium, Turnus being there buried: though
Brute had cause to rejoice in this victory, yet finding his forces decay every
day and his enemies increase, it was resolved they should bring the riches they
had got to their Ships, and all imbark once again to find out the Island the
Oracle had promised; After a few days sailing they arrived at an haven now
called Totnes in Devonshire, in the year from the Creation of the World 2850.
After the destruction of Troy 66. From the deliverance of the Israelites out of
Babylon 397. in the eighteenth year of the reign of Tyneas King of Babylon, and
the thirteenth of Melanthus King of Athens; Before the building of Rome 368.
And before the Nativity of our Savior 1116. For as the Poet sings of Brute.

The Gods did guide his sail and course
The winds were at command.
And Totnes was the happy shore
Where first he came to land.
Brute having entered the Country he immediately went in search of it from one
end to the other, and found it to abound in Woods, Grass, pleasant Springs, and
fair Rivers, though in the way he was encountered by diverse strong and mighty
Giants, whom he at length subdued and brought the Land wholly into subjection;
Among others there was one Giant of extraordinary strength and reputation
called Gogmagog, with whom Brute obliged Corineus to wrestle at a place near
Dover where it happened that Gogmagog broke one of the ribs of Corineus with a
fall, who being therewith enraged, recovered himself, and redoubling his
courage he prevailed against the Giant and cast him down headlong from one of
the Rocks now called Dover Clifts, but for many ages after retained the name of
Gogmagogs leap, and if Tradition is to be relied on in this case, it may
somewhat confirm the truth of the foregoing History, since the two Figures
placed in Guild Hall London are by some believed to represent these two Giants,
Gogmagog and Corineus; For this and many other valiant Achievements Brute
bestowed upon Corineus the whole Country of Cornwall whose Inhabitants are
still famous for wrestling, occasioned it may be from this their first governor.

I. Brute having conquered all that opposed him in the whole Island, resolved
to build a City which might be the Royal Seat of his kingdom, to which purpose
he chose a plat of ground on the Northside of the Thames, convenient for
pleasantness, clearness of air, goodness of soil, plenty of woods, and
especially accommodated with a Noble River for bringing in Merchandise and all
other necessaries proper for a multitude of inhabitants; He began to lay the
foundation thereof in the tenth year of his reign, which he called Troynovant
or New Troy in remembrance of that famous City from whence he and his people
were descended, but now named London, which having finished, he by the advice
of his Nobility commanded the Isle of Albion to be called Britain and the
people Britains, as a perpetual memorial that he was the first who brought
them hither. He had by his wife three sons Locrinus, Camber and Albanack, to
the elder at his death he gave that part now called England which was long
called Loegria from his name, To the second Wales named from him Cambria, and
to the third all the North part of the Isle beyond the River Humber, which he
called Albany, now Scotland. Having thus divided the Land Brute died in the
twenty fourth year after his arrival, and was buried at Troynovant or London,
but in what place is now unknown

II. Locrinus his eldest Son succeeded in Loegria and his brother Albanack in
Albania, but Humber King of the Hunns or Scythians invading his Country slew
him in battle, and took possession of his Land, till Locrinus with his brother
Camber King of Wales joining their Forces to revenge their brothers death, fell
upon him with such valor that they put his Army to flight, and pursued him so
eagerly that he with abundance of his people were drowned in the River which
divided Loegria from Albania, and from that K. has ever since retained the
name of the River of Humber among many others, three Virgins of excellent
beauty were taken Prisoners, with one of whom called Estrild a Scythian Kings
daughter Locrinus fell so in love, that notwithstanding a former contract
between him and Guendolen daughter of Corineus King of Cornwall he resolved to
marry her, but by the persuasions and threats of her Father durst not do it in
his life time, and though he married Guendolen he kept Estrild as his
Concubine, and after Corineus death forsook Guendolen and married her; Who
being thus cast off by her husband went to her kindred in Cornwall whom she
provoked to make War upon Locrine her husband, wherein he was slain near the
water of Stour, after he had reigned twenty years and was buried by his Father
at Troynovant.

III. Madan his Son by Guendolen succeeded him, but being under age his Mother
was by common consent of the Brittans made Ruler of the kingdom, wherein she
administered justice and equity fifteen years till her Son came to manhood, to
whom she then resigned the government, of whom little is recorded but that he
used much Tyranny over his Subjects forty years, after which as he was one day
going on hunting he lost his company and was devoured of Wild Beasts in the
Woods, leaving two Sons Mempricius and Manlius; He is said to have built Madan
Castle now Doncaster.

IV. Mempricius at the beginning of his reign had much trouble from his brother
Manlius, who out of an ambitious mind of ruling provoked the Britains to
rebellion and the war was long and bloody; But Manlius under pretense of
treating being slain, he reigned more peaceably which yet produced as bad an
effect, for being quiet he ran into all manner of debauchery, ravishing the
Wives and daughters of his Subjects, and at length grew so unnatural in his
lust that he forsook his wives and Concubines, and fell into the abominable sin
of Sodomy; Whereby he became odious to God and man, and met with the fate of
his Father being slain by Wolves in the forests, after twenty years reign.

V. Ebrank his Son by his lawful wife was his Successor, he had (as is said)
twenty one wives on whom he begot twenty sons and thirty daughters. He built
many Cities in his own kingdom and elsewhere; He sent his daughters into Italy
to be married to some noble Trojans whom his sons conducted thither, and in
their return conquered part of Germany, that impeded their passage, and planted
themselves there. Ebrank built Caerbrank now York, and Maidens Castle in
Scotland, now Edinburgh. After which he invaded Gallia now France, and subduing
the Galls returned home with great riches, and having reigned forty years died
and was buried at York.

VI. Brute Greenshield his Son was King after him in the year of the world
2009. Asa being then King of Judah, and Baasha of Israel. He always wore a
Green Shield from whence he took his Surname, and prosecuted his Fathers
Conquests in France, which he wholly subdued, and then dying.

VII. Leil his Son built the City of Carleil after his own name, and repaired
Caerleon now Chester which was built before Brutes coming by a famous Giant
named Leon Gaur; In the beginning of his reign he was very good and virtuous,
but afterward degenerated into all kind of voluptuousness, whereby he caused
great divisions and disturbances among his Subjects which continued during his
life; He was buried at Carlisle and left the Government to his Son.

VIII. Lud or Hudibras who appeased the dissentions raised in his Fathers
reign, and reduced the Realm to quietness; he built Kaerkin now Canterbury,
C^^rguent now Winchester, and Mount Palondour, now Shaftsbury; In his reign
Aquila a learned man writ his Prophecies of which some fragments now remain in
Latin. Having reigned thirty nine years he left his kingdom to his Son.

IX. Bladud who was famous for Astronomy and Necromancy by which means he is
reported to have made those hot Baths in the City of Caerbran now called Bath,
and was so addicted to the study of Magic and other strange practices that he
taught them to his people, and to magnify his Skill therein undertook to fly in
the air, but his Skill failing he fell upon the Temple of Apollo in Troynovant
now London, and was dashed to pieces after he had reigned twenty years.

X. Lear his Son undertook the Government after him, a Prince of a gallant
temper and ruled with much justice; He built the Town of Caerlier now Leicester
upon the River Sore. It is related he had three daughters named Gonerilla,
Regan, and Cordilla, whom he loved very tenderly especially the youngest, and
growing aged without an Heir, he resolved to try the affection of his
daughters, and to leave the Kingdom to her who should express most fatherly
kindness to him; He therefore demanded of the first how much she loved him, who
with great earnestness called Heaven to witness That she loved him above her
own life, and was very ready to lose it for preserving his; With which reply he
was well satisfied, and asked the same question of the second, who with mighty
attestations assured him, That her affection was beyond expression, and that
she valued him above all things in the World; Lastly he required Cordilla the
youngest to declare what kindness she had for him, who replied, Knowing the
extreme love and parental indulgence you have always born to me, I do solemnly
and from my conscience protest I ever did, and ever shall love you as a natural
Father, and no otherwise. Lear was much discontented at her answer, and
therefore soon after married his two eldest daughters one to the Duke of
Cornwall and the other to the Duke of Albany, and ordained that after his death
the Kingdom should be divided between them, but reserved nothing for Cordilla;
Yet it happened that Aganippus King of Gallia, now France, hearing of her
beauty, wisdom and virtue, sent to her Father to desire her in marriage, who
answered; He might marry if he pleased without a Dowry, since all his land was
already disposed to her elder sisters; Aganippus notwithstanding for her
excellent qualities made her his Queen; He was one of the twelve Kings that
then ruled in Gallia.

Lear was now very aged, and the two Dukes thinking it very long before they
enjoyed the Kingdom, taking arms deprived him of the Government, only allowing
him a certain revenue during life, but after a while they grew weary, and much
diminished his allowance, yea his two daughters who made such zealous
profession of love, now thought much of what their Father enjoyed, so that he
went from the eldest to the second to whom he represented the unnaturalness of
her sister, who used him as ill as the other, and at last reduced him to so
mean a condition that he had not one servant to wait on him. At length wearied
with their affronts and abuses, he fled secretly into France to seek relief of
his youngest daughter, Cordilla having notice of the arrival of her Father in
so mean and wretched a state, she sent him privately some money to provide
necessaries, and to retain a number of servants that he might appear at Court
honorably attended according to his former dignity, whither being come, he was
received with all manner of respect and honor by the King and his daughter,
wherewith he was exceedingly comforted, and gave them an account of the bad
treatment he had received from his other daughters upon which Aganippus raised
a great Army and conveyed them over into Britain in a gallant navy of Ships,
together with King Lear for recovering his Kingdom, who had made an agreement
that Cordilla should succeed after his decease, since her sisters by their
disobedience had forfeited their former right; In short time they landed in
Britain Cordilla being with them, and meeting with the two Dukes they engaged
in battle and put them to flight, the Dukes being both slain, and Lear
thereupon restored to his Kingdom, who reigned two years after, and then died
after he had ruled in all forty years, and was buried in a vault under the
Chanel of the River Soar near Leicester.

XI. Cordilla being admitted Queen of the Realm reigned very happily five
years, at the end of which her two Nephews Morgan and Cunegad her sisters sons
disdaining to live under the government of a woman raised a rebellion against
her, and having destroyed great part of the Country and defeated her Forces
they took her and kept her close Prisoner, wherewith, being much disturbed, and
despairing of regaining her liberty she out of Feminine valor stabbed her self
to the heart and died after five years reign.

XII. After her death the two Nephews divided the Land, that part beyond Humber
even as far as Caitness in Scotland falling to Morgan, and the other to
Cunegad; Having reigned jointly two years, Morgan was incited by some evil
counselors to endeavor to gain the whole to himself he being Son of the
eldest daughter, and was told it was a shame to be partner with a younger
brother; Pride, Covetousness and Ambition soon prevailed upon him to raise an
Army for effecting this unjust design, wherewith entering the Territories of
Cunegad he miserably ruined all before him, but was quickly met by his brothers
Forces, who gave him battle, wherein a great number of Morgans men being slain,
the rest fled and were pursued from one Country to another till they came into
Wales, where Morgan resolved once more to try his fortune, but being too weak
for a victorious army he was there slain in the Field, the Country being
afterward called from his name Glamorgan. After which Cunegad became sole
Governor of Britain, which he ruled peaceably thirty three years and was
buried at Troynovant, He is reported to have built three Temples, one dedicated
to the God Mars at Perth in Scotland, another to Mercury at Bangor, and a third
to Apollo in Cornwall.

XIII. Rival his Son ruled after him in much prosperity. In whose time it
rained blood three days together, after which followed such a multitude of
noisome and poisonous flies, that breeding a great contagion many died thereof.
Rome was built about this time; He reigned forty six years and was buried at
York, leaving the Realm to XIV Gurgusius his Son, in the year of the world
3249. of whom little is related in our British Chronicle, but that having
reigned thirty seven years he was buried at York likewise, XV Sysillus his Son
who succeeded, or his Brothers Son as some write has as little recorded of him,
nor of XVI Jago Cozen of Gurgusius, but that he died without issue. XVII
Kinmark his Brother governed after him and reigned fifty four years; XVIII
Gorbodug succeeded, and after sixty three years died and was buried at London,
leaving the Land to be ruled jointly by XIX Ferrex and Porrex his two Sons, who
continued some years in good correspondence, but flattery and thirst of
Dominion at length raised variance between them whereby Ferrex was forced to
fly into France, and having received aid from that Prince returned in hope to
conquer all for himself, but his Brother being ready to receive him, he was
slain with the greatest part of his Army; The Mother of them having greater
love for Ferrex than his Brother, was so enraged at his death, that she
contrived to murder the Survivor, which she effected with the help of her
women while he was asleep in the night, and then cut him into small pieces to
evidence the malice of her feminine revenge; After this for fifty years the
Kingdom was in great distraction, the Government being divided between five
Governors, who were all at length subdued by Dunwallo Duke of Cornwall; And
here ancient writers affirm the line of Brute ended, there being none of his
Race left alive after the two brethren Ferrex and Porrex; The names o^ the five
Rulers are said to be, Rudacus King of Wale^ Clotenus King of Cornwall, Pinnor
King of Loegria, St^^terus King of Albania, and Yewan King of Northunberland,
but Dunwallo having obtained the rule of t^^ whole Land, begun his Reign about
seven hundr^^ years after Brutes arrival, who was the first Crow^ed King of
Britain, for before this the Chief Ma^^strates of the Kingdom were
indifferently cal^ Kings, Rulers or Governors, but had not any sol^ Coronation
according to the custom of other Countries; I shall therefore now begin a new
Catalogue with a new Family, of which,

I. Malmutius Dunwallo Duke of Cornwall was the first in the year of the world
3529. and about five hundred years before our Saviors Nativity. He built in
Troynovant or London, the Temple of Peace, which some think is Blackwell Hall,
now used for selling cloth; He made many good Laws which were called by his
name, and long after translated out of British into Latin and mingled among
the Statutes of King Alfred; He gave privileges to Temples, Ploughs and
Cities; that whoeser fled to either in any criminal cause should be secured,
and have liberty to go thence into what Country he pleased, he built Malmsbury
and the Devizes. After he had settled the Kingdom he by the advice of his Lords
caused himself to be Crowned with a Crown of Gold with all the Heathen
Ceremonies of that Age, and was therefore called the first Monarch of Britain;
He ordained rules about Weights and Measures, and made strict Laws against
Robbers, and after forty years reign was buried in the Temple of Peace leaving
the Kingdom to be ruled by his two Sons.

II. Belinus and Brennus, the first governing Loegria, Wales, and Cornwall, and
Belin all the Country beyond Humber; They both reigned very quietly about
seven years, when Brennus ambitious of gaining the whole was persuaded by some
unquiet youths to sail into Norway where he married the daughter of Elsing Duke
of that Country; Belin vexed that he should marry without his advice, in his
absence seized all his Castles and Fortresses, and put Garrisons therein, of
which Brennus having intelligence, he was assisted by his Father-in-law with a
great Fleet of Ships and a stout Army of Norwegians wherewith sailing homeward,
he was encountered by the way by Guldac King of Denmark who with his Navy lay in
wait to surprise the young Lady Brennus had married, to whom Guldac had been
long a Servant but could never obtain her Fathers consent. The two Fleets
meeting, a bloody fight ensued, but at length the King of Denmark prevailed and
took the Ship wherein the Lady was, whom he brought into his own Vessel Brennus
making his escape; The Danes had no sooner obtained this great victory and
prize when a sudden tempest arising the navy was scattered, and the King in
danger of being lost, but after five days he was driven by storm into
Northumberland with the few Ships that remained; Belin being then in that
Country providing defense against his brother, having notice of it caused the
King to be detained.

Mean time Brennus having again got together his dispersed Ships, and furnished
them and his Soldiers with all necessaries, sent to his brother to demand the
restoring his wife, and his Country, both which were wrongfully detained from
him; But receiving a positive denial to both, he landed his Army in Albany, now
Scotland, and his brother coming toward him, a cruel battle was fought near a
Wood called Calater wherein the Britains at length discomfited the Norwegians
with so great a slaughter that few were left alive; Brennus was forced to fly
into France, where having made his addresses for Succor to several Princes in
vain, he was at length entertained by Seguin Duke of Savoy, or as others say of
Armorica, called afterward Little Britain.

Belin having subdued his Enemies called his Council at York to consult what to
do with the King of Denmark, where at length it was agreed that he should have
his liberty on condition to do homage for his kingdom to the King of England,
and to pay yearly a thousand pound Tribute; Belin now sole Governor of
Britain, confirmed his Fathers Laws, and finished the four highways begun by
him for the convenience of Travel; The first was called the Fosse beginning at
Totnes in Devonshire and passing thence through Sommerset-shire by Tutbury and
Cotswald to Coventry, Leicester, Newark, and ending at Lincoln; The second
named Watling-street which began at Dover passing through the middle of Kent
over Thames near Westminster, and thence to Saint Albans, Dunstable, Stratford,
Worcester, Cardigan and the Irish Sea; The third was Erminstreet beginning at
St. David's in Wales and stretching to Southampton; The fourth Hicknelstreet
going from Worcester to Winchcomb, Brumigam, Litchfield, Darby, Chesterfield,
York, and ending at Tynmouth Castle.

Belin thus employed in the affairs of his Realm his brother Brennus who fled
into France only with eleven persons, being a complete handsome Gentleman, and a
Man of honor and courage, became a very great Favorite to Duke Seguin, who
for his worthy qualities gave him his daughter in marriage, and declared, that
if he dyed without issue Male, he should succeed, but if otherwise then his
heir should assist Brennus in recovering his rightful inheritance from his
brother Belin; These conditions being mutually assented to by the Duke and his
Nobility, Brennus about a year after Seguin died, and his Duchess not being
with Child by him, the Lords of the Country received Brennus for their Supreme
Governor; Being settled in his Government he raises an Army wherewith he lands
in Britain to make war on his brother, who soon assembles his forces to
entertain him, but being just ready to join in battle, by the intercession of
their mother, who interposed between the Armies, and used all manner of tender
persuasions to them not to go on thus to destroy and ruin themselves and their
Subjects, she prevailed so far that a perfect agreement and friendship was
confirmed between them.

After which both coming to London, they called their Peers and Counselors
together, to advise about settling their Dominions where it was at length
accorded between them, that both Armies should go into Gallia to subdue that
Country, where they had such notable success that in a short time (says
Jeffery of Monmouth) they conquered most part of Gallia, Italy and Germany, and
at length took the City of Rome it self (if at least these be those Commanders
who led the Gauls into Italy, and made such devastations in that part of
Europe) Having passed the Alps, and arriving in Tuscany they besiege the City
of Clusium, which being distressed, sent to Rome for succor; the Romans tho
they had no League with the Clusians, yet considering it might soon be their
own condition, sent Ambassadors to the Captains of the Gauls in the name of the
Senate not to molest their Neighbors, and friends, to which Brennus returned
answer; That they were willing to make peace with the Clusians if they would
consent to let them have part of their Country, who had more than they could
employ, but otherwise no peace would be granted; The Ambassadors offended at
this demand, asked; What they had to do in Tuscany; Which raising fierce
disputes, they at length resolved to end the matter by arms, and the
Ambassadors contrary to the Law of Nations, went presently and joined
themselves to the Clusians, encouraging them to hold out the City, which so
enraged the Gauls that with one voice they required their Princes to raise the
Siege from Clusium that they might go and take Rome itself; Brennus first sent
Messengers to the Senate requiring that those who had thus broken the Laws
might be punished as they deserved, but the Ambassadors were so far from being
blamed that they were chosen Tribunes for their good Service.

Whereat the Gauls were so much provoked that they instantly marched toward
Rome destroying all before them. The Romans at length met them with an Army of
Forty thousand, and engaging near the River Albia about eleven miles from Rome,
the Romans were quickly discomfited and overthrown. The Gauls could hardly
believe they had got the victory with so small resistance, but perceiving all
had left the Field they got together the plunder, and marched directly to Rome,
at whose approach the Citizens were so affrighted, that the young Senators, and
all the youthful Gentry retired into the Capitol which they provided with all
necessarys for a long Seige; The Ancient Fathers and Common people remained
still in the City resolving to expect the fate thereof; The Gauls soon after
entered by the Gate Collina and went directly to the Market place, but were much
surpised to observe that the Houses of the meaner sort were shut against them,
but the Greater and richer stood wide open, and at first were cautious of
entering for fear of Treachery, but at length some going in, found the Reverend
Senators sitting in their Chairs clothed in rich Robes at if they had been in
the Senate house, with so much gravity and state that the Gauls reverenced them
as Gods; It happened that Marcus Papyrius struck one of the Gauls on the head
with a staff for presuming to stroke his beard, wherewith being provoked he
instantly slew Papyrius as he sat, wherewith the Slaughter being begun, all
the rest of those Honorable Persons were killed in their Chairs, the whole
City without regard to age or sex suffering the like Calamity with them; And
thus was Rome taken by the two brethren Belin and Brennus 265 years from the
building thereof.

After this the Gauls attempted to take the Capitol in the night, and had
certainly succeeded but that some Geese with their noise and crying discovered
the design, by awaking the Sleeping Romans, who seasonably repulsed their
enemies; Being in great distress, they resolved to recall Camillus whom they
had unjustly banished, and make him Dictator, and Sole Commander over all their
Lives and Estates, who forgetting the injuries done him applied himself
instantly for delivering his Country, and raised as puissant an Army as the
time would permit: Mean while those in the Capitol being even famished for want
of Victuals treated with the Gauls, and made an agreement to give them a
thousand pound weight in gold for their liberty; which being paid they were to
march out of the City and all the Roman Territories. As the money was weighing
some of the covetous Gauls threw their swords into the Scales where the weights
were that they might get the more, which the Romans would not admit, and while
some difference arose upon this account, Camillus with his Forces comes in
amongst them, and commands the Gold to be carried away since no composition
could be made without consent of the Dictator, and bid the Gauls prepare for
battle, who having more mind to the Gold than to fight were soon defeated, many
being slain, and the rest flying out of the City; Some affirm that a Peace was
concluded between them, and that Brennus went afterward into Germany and Belin
returned home to Britain employing the rest of his reign in building Churches
and beautyfying Citys and Palaces; among others he built a famous Gate at a
Port in London on the top whereof was set a Vessel of Brass, wherein the ashes
of his body (which was burnt according to the custom of those times) were
afterward put, which was then called Bellinus but now Billingsgate; He also
built a Castle not far off which was called Bellins Castle now the Tower of
London. Having reigned 26 years he left the Kingdom to his son III Gurgint, who
sailed with a mighty Army into Denmark for recovering the Tribute promised to
his Predecessors, where he made such devastations with fire and sword that the
King of Denmark by persuasion of his Nobles was compeil'd to continue the
payment thereof. As he returned home he met with thirty Ships near the Isles of
Orkney freighted with men, women and children under their Captain named
Bartholin, who being brought before the King declared, They were banished out
of Spain and were called Balenses, who had sailed long on the Sea in hope to
find some generous Prince who would assign them a place to inhabit, and to whom
they would willingly be subject, humbly beseeching him to commiserate their
condition; Who with the advice of his Barons granted them Ireland for an
habitation, which then lay wast; Though some writers relate that, it was
peopled long before by a people called Hibernensis from Hiberus their Captain
who brought them from Spain. Gurgint returning home made many good Laws, and
administered Justice worthily nineteen years; In whose reign Cambridge and the
University are said to be built by one Cantaber.

IV. Guintolin succeeded, a prudent Prince and happy in a virtuous and
beautiful Queen, who after his death administered the affairs of the Kingdom
during the minority of her Son; After he had revived and enforced all the good
old Laws and added what new were wanting, whereby he settled the Land in peace
and tranquillity, he left it to his Son.

V. Sicilius, not then about seven years old, who reigned about seventeen
years, most part of which his Mother Martia managed all State affairs.

VI. Kinarus his Son ruled after him, who giving himself up to Luxury and
Debauchery was slain by some of his enemies as he was a hunting in the Fields.

VII. Elanius his Son, or as others write, his Brother was his Successor, of
whom little is recorded but his name, and that he reigned eight years, and then
VIII Morindus his Son by a Concubine was admitted King of Britain, a man of
much valor, and conduct, but withal so barbarously cruel that he delighted to
inflict lingering torments upon those that offended him, yea oftentimes with his
own hands he severely tortured his people. In his reign a certain King of a
people called Moriani landed with a great Army in Northumberland and made
horrid ravage with fire and sword; Against whom Morindus having raised his
Britains marches with all expedition, and in a dreadful battle defeated and
pursued them to their Ships, taking a great number Prisoners, whom to satisfy
his bloody humor he caused to be executed in his presence, some being beheaded,
some strangled, and others ripped up alive. They were thought to come from some
part of Germany. At length this bloody Prince hearing there was a Monster come
ashore out of the Irish Sea, resolved to encounter therewith, but was devoured
by it after he had reigned eight years, leaving five Sons, Gorbomen,
Archigallo, Elidure, Vigenius and Peredurus.

IX. Gorbomen the eldest succeeded, and was a very religious Prince according
to the devotion of that age, repairing many old Temples, and erecting diverse
new. He built the Town of Grantham and enclosed Cambridge with walls, and a
strong Castle, procuring Philosophers to come thither from Athens, who
instructed the youth of the Kingdom in Learning and the Liberal Sciences, he
died without issue, and X Archigallo his Brother came after him who much
degenerated from his Father, and caused dissension among his Nobility by taking
away their Honors and Estates illegally, and bestowing them upon mean unworthy
persons, whereby the Gentry were reduced to beggary and misery, who therefore
conspired against him, and at length deprived him of his Royal Dignity having
reigned only one year advancing XI Elidure the third Son of Morindus to the
Throne, who was a person of such a gallant temper that he used all manner of
means for restoring his Brother to the Crown. It happened that as he was one
day hunting in a Wood near York he met Archigallo wandering to seek relief, whom
he treated with all kindness, conveying him secretly to his own house; soon
after he feigned himself sick, and sent with all speed for his Barons to attend
him with whom he dealt so effectually one by one in his Privy Chamber that at
length they agreed to admit his Brother again to be King, and then assembling a
great Council at York he resigned his Dignity to him after he had ruled with
much wisdom three years; A worthy example of fraternal love, considering how
ambitious all men naturally are of dominion. Archigallo thus restored in hope
of his upright administration of justice for the future, did not disappoint his
people, but became a new man, and acted with so much prudence and moderation
that he was beloved of all his Subjects to the end of his life, and having
reigned ten years was buried at York. After which Elidure having right by
Succession as well as by the inclination of the Britains was acknowledged King
with general Applause, who had not sat on the Throne a year when his two
Brothers raised a Rebellion against him, and in a pitched Field he was taken
Prisoner and committed to the Tower of London, after which XII Vigenius and
Peredurus the two youngest Sons of Morindus divided the Kingdom between them,
all the Country from Humber west falling to the eldest, and the other
northward to Peredurus. Vigenius after seven years died, and Peredurus took
possession of the whole Land, and reigned very tyrannically eight years, and
then dying without issue, XIII Elidure as next Heir was the third time admitted
King, having continued in Prison all this while, and during his four years
reign managed all matters to the great satisfacton of his people, and being
then grown very aged dyed and was buried at Carlisle. From this time to the
reign of Helie there passed about one hundred and eighty years, and some
ancient Authors have reckoned up near thirty three Kings who reigned in that
space, but do not agree either in their names or number, and therefore we shall
let them pass as Fairy Princes and proceed.

XIV. Helie is the next in order from whom some think the Isle of Ely is named,
though others affirm it to arise from a multitude of Eels into which the
married Priests were said to be transformed for refusing to obey St. Dunstans
Order, That Priests should tive single, though the true denomination may come
from Helig in British a Willow with which that Isle abounds. This Helie had
three Sons Lud, Cassibelane, and Nunnius.

XV. Lud succeeded his Father in the year of the World 3895. And before the
birth of Christ seventy two. He was a very worthy Prince who repealed many old
Laws and evil customs establishing better; He repaired several decayed Cities,
but took particular delight to beautify Troynovant now London which he enlarged
with buildings and fortified with strong Walls, Towers and Gates, and among the
rest Ludgate so called from him to this day; He founded a Temple where it is
thought St. Paul's now stands, and a Palace not far off judged to be Baynalds
Castle whereby this City became famous and full of Inhabitants above any other
in the Land, and the name was changed to Cair Lud, or Luds Town, and afterward
London; He was successful against his enemies, bountiful in hospitality, and
very much honored and beloved of all his people; and having reigned
prosperously eleven years he died and was buried near Ludgate leaving two sons
Androgeus and Theomantius, who being under age their uncle XVI. Cassibelane was
admitted to the administration of the Government, wherein he behaved himself
with so much justice and uprightness, that the Britains had little regard to
the sons of Lud; But least it might be thought he usurped their right, he
assigned them an honorable maintenance during their nonage, Androgeus enjoying
London and the County of Kent, and Theomantius the County of Cornwall while
Cassibelane ruled in Britain Julius Caesar being sent by the Senate of Rome
with a mighty Army for the conquest of Gallia or France, after he had subjected
them, resolved to try his fortune in subduing Britain, which the Romans knew
nothing of but by report, yet had heard that great supplies came daily thence
to assist the Gauls their Enemies, and though it was now toward Winter, he
resolved to attempt the discovery of their Ports, and the nature and manners of
the Inhabitants of which he could receive no satisfaction from such Merchants
as traded thither; Hereupon he draws his Forces toward Callice called then
Itius Portus, and sent out a small vessel to survey the Coasts, and return
again.

The Merchants giving notice to the Britains of the intended Invasion, all
that were able were put into arms, and several Citys, who it seems had
particular Governors of their own, sent Ambassadors to offer subjection to the
Romans, whom Caesar received with much kindness, and sent one of his Commanders
back with them to persuade the other Citys to submit themselves likewise; But
he names no King they had nor is Cassibelan mentioned till his second Voyage
though the British Historys say; That Caesar required Tribute of him who
answered, He had not yet learned to live in bondage, but with sword in hand
resolved to defend the Liberty of his Country if the Romans blinded with
covetousness and ambition should adventure to disquiet them. The Galley that
went upon discovery returning in five days with a full account of all the
Coasts on that side, Caesar imbarqued two Legions of Soldiers in several
Ships, and about midnight departed from Callice arriving next day at noon upon
the British Shore near Dover which he found all covered with men of War to
inintercept his landing, who observing the inconvenience of going aland there
because of the high Cliffs from whence the Britains might annoy them with
their bows and darts, he sailed seven or eight miles farther toward Deal where
the shore was more flat and level; Which the Britains perceiving caused all
their Horse and Chariots of War wherein they fought to march thither the rest
soon following, so that Caesar much doubted of success, yet resolving to
venture, he brought his great Ships as near land as possible from whence his
Soldiers issuing, were forced to march a great way in the water laden with
their heavy armor, and were briskly assailed by the British Horse who went
into the Sea, and courageously assaulted them with their arrows at such
disadvantage that the Romans unused to this kind of fighting were ready to give
ground; which Caesar perceiving ordered the Galleys to row near the shore, and
annoy the Britains with their Darts and slings while their companions got to
land; At which the Britains, having never seen Galleys with Oars, were much
amazed, and being severely galled with the Roman Artillery they began a little
to retire which a Roman Ensignbearer observing, he cried out, Leap out now
Worthy Companions in Arms if you will secure the Ensigns of your Honor from
the Enemy, for I am resolved to do my duty both to the Commonwealth and my
General; And therewith throwing himself into the water he marched with his
Ensign directly toward the Enemy; The Romans doubting the disgrace of losing
their Ensign leapt out of their Ships with all expedition and followed their
gallant Leader, but were put into some disorder, finding no sure footing in the
water, and not able to march orderly under their own Ensigns, of which the
Britains took the advantage, and being acquainted with the shelves and
shallows of the Water, they again feircely encountered them with their Horse, so
that a multitude of them would incompass a small party of the Romans, and the
numerous Darts of the Britains from the shore galled them exceedingly, which
Caesar observing caused his Soldiers to go into small boats for releiving
those who were most distressed, and thus new succors continually supplying the
place of those that fell, the Romans at length got all to land, and putting
themselves into order soon forced the undisciplined Britains to fly, but could
no^ pursue them for want of their Horse, which they lef^ behind in France, and
expected long ere now, which seemed a little to cross the fortune of Caesar,
who in all other enterprises was usually exceeding successful.

After this the Britains sensible of their own weakness sent Hostages to treat
of Peace, and with them the Roman Ambassador that Caesar had before sent to
persuade them to subjection, whom contrary to the Law of Arms they had made
Prisoner, for which he reproved them severely, but at length pardoned their
folly; requiring Hostages to remain with him for securing their Fidelity;
Having accordingly received them, four days after the Romans arrival a Peace
was concluded between them, at which time the eighteen Ships on which the Horse
were imbarqued approached so near the British Coasts that the Romans in their
Camp had sight of them, when there suddenly rose so dreadful a Tempest that
they were all dispersed, together with those that brought over the Foot,
wherewith the Romans were much discouraged since they had no provisions for
Winter, and little hope to get back again to France. The British Commanders
perceiving their disturbance, and judging by the small circuit of their Camp,
their number was not considerable, resolved to assemble their Forces, and
hinder any relief from coming to them, of which Caesar having intelligence,
sent one of his Legions to reap Corn a good distance from the Camp, who when
they had begun their work were suddenly surprised by the Britains out of the
Woods, who slew diverse and disordered the rest, which Caesar by the
extraordinary dust thereabout perceiving, sent another Legion to their
assistance, who were very hardly beset by the British Chariots which moved
with great swiftness in the most dangerous places, but upon the approach of
these fresh succors, the Britains retreated into the Woods, and the Romans
not knowing the Country, would not venture to pursue them.

Mean time the Britains sent through all the Land to give notice that the
strength of the Romans was so inconsiderable that if they would join together
they might easily free themselves from servitude for ever, whereupon a
multitude of Horse and Foot approacht the Roman Camp, and Caesar considering if
he should repulse them they would as formerly make their escape by swiftness of
foot, he placed thirty Horsemen which came from France in the Front, and then
joined battle with his Legions; the Britains unable to sustain the impression
of such valiant men fled with all speed, the Roman Horse pursuing, and killing
many, and burning their Houses all about, returned to their Camp; That very day
they again sent Ambassadors to Caesar to sue for Peace which he gladly accepted
on condition they sent over to France double the number of Hostages before
agreed on for securing their Faith; After which having repaired his broken
Vessels, he returned back with all his people into France; This account he
himself gives in his Commentaries of his first Journey hither, though the
British History relates, That Caesar being beaten in a pitched field at the
first encounter, withdrew back into Gallia, and made this Rhyme upon him.

Territa quaesitiis ostendit terra Brittannis
He Britains fought but force
To conquer them does lack
And therefore like a coward flies
And shows his fearful back.
After Caesar's arrival in France two Cities only sent their Hostages, whereupon
resolving on an entire conquest of the Island, next Spring he landed with five
Roman Legions, whom the Britains on the Shore durst not oppose, but fled for
safety to the Mountains, the sight of eight hundred Ships great and small upon
their Coasts being very terrible to them; Caesar being safely landed went in
pursuit of his enemies twelve miles into the Country and there discovered
their Camp, and assaulting them with his horse they fled into the Woods, which
they secured with trees laid cross all the passages; Caesar ignorant of the
Country, called back his forces to fortify his own Camp; Next day he had
intelligence that a terrible storm had shattered a great part of his Navy,
which having employed one of his Legions ten days in repairing, and sending
for more Ships from France, he again advanced toward his Enemies, who giving
general notice through the kingdom of the great forces wherewith Caesar was
again returned, they all made Cassibelane their General, with full power to
order all things as he should think meet for the common defense of their
Country. The Horse and Chariots had diverse Skirmishes with the Romans, and
were often forced to retreat into the woods, where they cut off many of their
enemies who too eagerly pursued them: This kind of fight they renewed several
times, the Britains issuing out of the Woods in small parties, having others
to succor them, and falling suddenly upon the Romans did them much mischief,
whom their heavy armor made unfit for such kind of warfare; At length Caesar
resolving to engage in a set battle followed them to Kingston, where he
intended to pass over with all his Forces of which Cassibelane and the
Britains being aware placed sharp stakes at the bottom of the Thames thereby
to annoy them, standing in readiness on the other side to oppose their coming a
shore, yet the Roman courage surmounted those difficulties, who passed over
both Horse and Foot without inconvenience, the foot being so deep in the water
that nothing but their heads appeared above, and getting to the further bank
assaulted the Britains with such violence that not able to sustain their force
they instantly fled.

Cassibelane after this would not venture the trial of a battle, but keeping
about him four thousand Chariots he wasted all the Champaign Country, and
fortified himself within the thick woods and Forests from whence he often
started out in ways well known upon the Roman forragers and did them much
damage; Mean time the Troynovants, which are thought to be the people of Essex
and Middlesex, whose City of London had escaped the desolation which others
felt, sent Ambassadors to Caesar to offer their submission and obedience who
commanded them to send him forty Hostages and provisions for his Army, which
being performed he took them into his protection, after whose example several
other Countries submitted themselves, by whom he understood that the Town
wherein Cassibelan resided and defended by the thickness of the Woods, was not
far off, and assaulting it two ways at once, they with some loss at length
prevailed, and entering the fortress found great numbers of Cattle killing and
taking Prisoners many Britains. Whereupon Cassibelane sent to the four chief
Rulers in Kent to muster all their strength, and assail the Roman Camp which
lay there for defense of the Ships, which they attempted accordingly, but were
received with such valor by the Romans who issued out of their Camp that they
were utterly defeated; Cassibelane much discouraged at these repeated losses
sends Ambassadors to Caesar who intending to winter in France, took Hostages,
and appointed him to pay a yearly Tribute, strictly charging him not to disturb
the Londoners, and then taking all his Romans aboard his Ships he returned into
Gallia.

Thus Caesar and other credible writers have related this Transaction, though
the British Historians differ herein, affirming, that Caesar at his second
coming was repulsed and beaten as at first, and wonderfully annoyed by piles
armed with iron placed in the Thames by Cassibelane which destroyed his Ships,
and that at his landing he was defeated by the Britains; For joy of which
victory Cassibelane made a Royal Feast at London and sacrificed to their Gods;
At which time there happened a quarrel about wrestling between two young
Gentlemen Herilda Nephew to Cassibelane, and Ewelyn Kinsman to Androgeus Earl
of London, and a desperate fray happening thereupon by the partakers on each
side, Herilda was slain and diverse others killed and wounded, at which the King
much displeased resolved to punish Ewelyn according to Law, who was summoned to
appear, but being countenanced by Androgeus he refused to obey and both
departed the Court in great contempt of the King, who thereupon raising forces
resolved to reduce them to reason, but they sensible of their own weakness,
sent Letters to Julius Caesar for his assistance, who joyful of the message and
the variance between them returns speedily with a mighty Army toward Britain,
but doubting some treachery in Androgeus, he first takes thirty of the Nobility
for Hostages, and then landing joins with Androgeus in a Valley near
Canterbury; Cassibelane having notice thereof comes with all the power of
Britain to give them battle, where having fought long with much courage,
Androgeus fell so vigorously upon their right wing that the Britains were
utterly discomfited, and killed without mercy, yea the pursuit was so furious
that Cassibelane retiring with four thousand to a place as he thought of
safety, was environed with the Roman Legions and compelled to a composition,
being obliged to pay Caesar three thousand pound yearly Tribute. Who having
settled all affairs here returned to France with Androgeus in his company who
much feared the displeasure of Cassibelane; Yet did not Caesar wholly subdue
Britain, for he never came toward the north (which several Roman Emperors
after him endeavored for many years to bring into subjection) but conquered
only those parts of the Island lying next France, so that he may seem rather to
have discovered than subjected it to the Roman power. This happened in the year
from the creation ^913. And before our Savior 53.

Julius Caesar having thus made the Britains Tributants returned into Gallia,
after which Cassibelane reigned seven years in all 17 and then died; It appears
both by Caesar's Commentaries, and other authentic Writers that Britain in
those days was not ruled by one Supreme Monarch but divided into several
Governments, and that Cassibelane commanded over the Counties of Oxford, Berks,
Buckingham and Bedford, in which state it continued during the Roman Dominion
and long after, even till it was finally subjected by the Saxons.

XVI. Theomantius the youngest Son of Lud succeeded Cassibelane, Androgeus his
elder brother having utterly abandoned the Land, being sensible the Britains
abhorred him for his Treachery in assisting the Romans against his Uncle
Cassibelane; He governed the kingdom with much justice and peace; paying
constantly the Tribute his Predecessor had agreed to give the Romans, and
having reigned twenty two years died and was buried at London.

XVII. Kymbeline his Son was by the Britains admitted King after him; He is
said to have had his education at Rome, and was made a Knight by Augustus
Caesar (Successor to Julius,) and that he served under him in his Wars, and
obtained so much favor with him, that when he came to be King he left him at
liberty whether he would pay the usual Tribute or not; Thus our British
Historians write, though the Romans relate that Augustus designed no less than
thrice to make an expedition hither and recover his rights but was as often
diverted by insurrections in diverse parts of his mighty Empire. He reigned 25
years, and then left the kingdom to his eldest Son, XVIII. Ginderus who began
his reign in the 17 year of our Lord, and being a man of much courage refused
to own any homage to the Romans; Whereupon Caligula the Emperor disliking the
negligence (as he termed it) of his Predecessors Augustus and Tiberius,
resolved to reduce Britain as being the utmost bounds of the Roman Monarchy,
making very great provision for this noble enterprise in the fourth year of his
reign, which Ginderus having notice of, prepared to make the best defense
possible, and daily expected his arrival, but after all this pompous show he
only came to Callice, from whence he beheld the Clifts of Britain with much
admiration, but hearing they were ready to receive him on the opposite Shore,
seeming nothing discouraged he went aboard a Galley, in which having passed
about two bow-shots from the land, he immediately returned, and then getting up
into a Pulpit purposely provided on the Sea side, he from thence by sound of
Trumpet gave a signal to his Soldiers to engage, yet not the Britains who
were for enough off, but charged every man to gather up Cockle Shells from the
Shore, which he called, The Speils of the Ocean, and gave as great rewards to
them for these trifles as if they had performed some notable Service in War; He
carried many of these Shells to Rome boasting of this honorable Voyage, and
requiring to have a Triumph granted him for this rediculous expedition, which
the Senate seeming unwilling to grant, he was almost resolved to have murdered
them all. From the Senate he ascended his Royal Throne in the Market place, and
summoning the Common people together, told them a long story of his Adventures
in conquering the Ocean, and when he perceived them to begin to shout as if
they acknowledged him to be a God or a mighty Champion, to increase their cry
he threw great quantities of Gold and Silver among them, in striving for which
many were pressed to death, and others murdered with the Calthrops made of
iron with three spikes standing up, which having poisoned he cast out with the
money on purpose to do mischief wherewith many in the crowd were invenomed and
died, and this was the end of the ridiculous Voyage of Caligula into Britain.

But Claudius his successor upon a rebellion that arose, sent two of his
Commanders Plautius and Narcissus hither, who coming unexpected found no
resistance, the Britains flying into the Woods for security, so that they had
more trouble to discover than subdue them, but having at length met with
several Parties they soon defeated them, by killing their Chariot Horses; Yet
others growing very troublesome to the Romans, Plautius pursuant to his orders
sent for the Emperor Claudius who soon arriving fell upon the Britains
encamped about the Isle of Shepey in Kent, and putting them to flight, took the
City of Camalodunum now Malden in Essex, and having thus subjected part of the
Britains, he returned back to Rome six months after his departing thence, and
named his son Brittanicus in memory of this Conquest. The British story says,
That Claudius landing at Porchester now Portsmouth, beseiged that Town; to
relieve which King Ginderus came in person and giving the Romans battle
prevailed, till one Hamo a Roman arming himself like a Britain, thrust
unsuspected into the midst of the Army till coming where Ginderus was, he
instantly slew him, which Arviragus the Kings brother perceiving he to prevent
the Britains from being discouraged, clothed himself with the Royal
habiliments, and fought with such courage that he put the Romans to the rout,
Claudius returning to his Ships, and Hamo flying to the adjoining Forest, whom
Arviragus so feircely pursued that at length he drove him toward the Sea, and
there slew him before he could get to the Haven, from whence (it is said,) it
obtained the name of Hamo's Haven, and after Hampton, now Southampton.

XIX. Arviragus succeeded his brother, forty six years after Christ, who after
the departure of Claudius went in progress about the Realm, repairing decayed
Towns and Citys and making new Laws for governing his people, and finding that
in short time the Land begun to flourish, he was so elated that he denied to
pay the Romans their accustomed Tribute, whereupon Claudius sent Vespasian
(afterward Emperor) as his Lieutenant into Britain, who attempting to land at
Sandwich was valiantly opposed by Arviragus, so that sailing farther West he
came ashore at Totnes in Devonshire, and beseiged Exeter, but by the Queens
means a reconciliation was made without blows; Thus write the Britains, but
Suetonius the Roman Historian relates, That Vespasian being sent with a Legion
of Soldiers into Britain fought thirty feveral battles and brought under
obedience two mighty Nations, and above Twenty Towns with the Isle of Weight;
Arviragus finding his strength insufficient to contend with the power of the
Empire, in his old age made a firm League with the Romans which continued till
his death, who having reigned thirty years dyed and was buried at Gloucester.

In his time about fifty three years after the birth of Christ, Joseph of
Arimathea being sent by Philip the Apostle, came into Britain with several
other Christians, preaching the Gospel and instructing them in the Religion of
the blessed Jesus, whereby many were converted and baptized, these Holy men
continued here all their lives having a place assigned them by the King near
the City of Wells, where after was erected the Abbey of Glastenbury. This
Arviragus was reckoned a very puissant Prince by the Romans as appears by what
Juvenal Writes.

Regem aliquam capies aut de Temone Brittanno
Excidit Arviragus.
It shows to honor thou shall rise,
Or some great King restrain,
Or shake the fierce Arviragus
Out of his British Wain.
After his death the Land was many years under Roman Governors or Lieutenants;
First Ostorius then Aulus Didius, and after him by Pautinus Suetonius, during
which the Britains made many Essays for recovering their lost liberty, wherein
they sometimes prevailed, and were otherwhile defeated; In the reign of that
cruel Emperor Nero Successor to Claudius, the Romans received a great overthrow
from the Britains, which Paulinus endeavored to retrieve by assaulting the
Isle of Anglesey then fully inhabited with people of desperate fortunes, and
having provided flat bottomed boats to ferry over his Forces, the Britains
were ready to oppose him on the shore, the women likewise with the hair about
their ears, clothed in strange garments, ran about the Camp with firebrands in
their hands, and a great company of Druids or Priests appeared who lifting
their hands toward Heaven thundered out curses and execrations against the
Romans, who were so much surprised at this unexpected treatment that they
suffered themselves to be slain like senseless creatures, till by the
incitation of their General, and their encouraging each other not to be daunted
by a company of mad women, they came forward with so much fury that they beat
down all before them, and with their own fires smothered and burnt the
Britains to ashes, taking possession of the whole Island, and cutting down
their woods wherein they use to Sacrifice the Prisoners they had taken to their
Gods, and by their entrails when dismembered pretended to Divine their future
success. While Paulinus was thus employed, the Britains in other parts of the
Land got together and consulted how to free themselves from the insupportable
slavery and misery wherein they lived, one among the rest deploring their
wretched condition in words to this effect.

Dear Countrymen and Friends, the more wrongs and injuries we patiently endure
from the governing his people, and finding that in short time the Land begun to
flourish, he was so elated that he denied to pay the Romans their accustomed
Tribute, whereupon Claudius sent Vespasian (afterward Emperor) as his
Lieutenant into Britain, who attempting to land at Sandwich was valiantly

Devonshire, and beseiged Exeter, but by the Queens means a reconciliation was
made without blows; Thus write the Britains, but Suetonius the Roman Historian
relates, That Vespasian being sent with a Legion of Soldiers into Britain
fought thirty several battles and brought under obedience two mighty Nations,
and above Twenty Towns with the Isle of Wight; Arviragus finding his strength
insufficient to contend with the power of the Empire, in his old age made a
firm League with the Romans which continued till his death, who having reigned
thirty years dyed and was buried at Gloucester.

Land got together and consulted how to free themselves from the insupportable
slavery and misery wherein they lived, one among the rest deploring their
wretched condition in words to this effect.

Dear Countrymen and Friends, the more wrongs and injuries we patiently endure
from the Romans, the greater pressures they lay upon us; Our Country had
formerly but one King over it, but now we have two, the Lieutenant who with his
Officers and Soldiers spills our Blood like water, and the Treasurer, or
rather Thief who bereaves us of all our Goods and Estates; so that nothing is
free from their Tyranny or Covetousness, and the greatest Robber is counted the
stoutest man, yea our Houses are commonly plundered by cowardly Rascals, who
never acted in any warlike enterprise. Our Children are taken from us and we
our selves pressed into Foreign Wars as if we knew not how to spend our lives
in defense of our Country, and how many thousands of us have been transported
into other Countries upon this account none of you are insensible of; The
Germans have by their valor thrown off the heavy Roman yoke, though parted
from them only by a River, whereas we are defended and separated by the Main
Ocean; The Britains fight in a just cause, even the defense of their Country,
their Parents, Wives, Children, Liberties, yea their own Lives, the Romans only
out of an avaritious desire to gain by rapine what others have gathered by
labor, to serve their insatiable lusts and pleasures. And if we Britains did
but exert some of that gallant courage and prowess which was found in our
Ancestors when they compelled Julius Caesar to depart the Land, and not shrink
or be discouraged at small losses, we might soon rid our selves of this
insulting enemy, for Fortune always assists the bold, and the Gods seem now to
take some pity on the poor Britains by confining our Foes within the compass
of a narrow Island, let us therefore take the opportunity offered, and proceed
with all speed in our business, resolving rather to dye manfully in
endeavoring to regain our freedom than to suffer death tamely for thus
consulting to effect the same.

This warm Oration had such influence upon the people that they concluded to
adventure all for their future security, having been sufficiently provoked by
the multiplied wrongs the Romans had offered, and among others, That whereas
King Arviragus had made Nero the Emperor and his two daughters his Heirs,
hoping thereby to secure the Kingdom to his Family it happened otherwise, for
the Land was spoiled and ruined by the Roman Captains and his Queen Voadicia
beaten and abused by the Soldiers, her daughters ravished, the Nobles bereft
of their Estates and the Kings Friends made slaves, together with confiscating
the lands of many other Chief men whom Claudius had before pardoned, to which
was added this misfortune, that Seneca having lent some of the Nobility five
hundred thousand pound Sterling at high interest, he now required the whole sum
at once with much rigor though he had forced his money upon them; Likewise the
Roman Soldiers quartered at Camolodienum (now Maidon in Essex) expelled the
Britains out of their Houses and possessions accounting them their conquered
Vassals; yea the Priests who served at the Temple built in honor of Claudius,
spoiled and destroyed their neighbors goods unpurnshed. And as in times of
general defection every accident is reckoned an encouragement, many strange
Signs and Prodigies were reported to happen which incited the Britains to
proceed; It being said that the Image of Victory in the Temple of Camolodunum
fell down and turned her back upon the Romans as if she had now forsaken them;
great and wonderful noises were heard in the Hall of Justice, with much
laughing, and disturbance in the Theater, and sometimes woeful weeping,
lamentation and howling, when it was certainly known no humane Creature was
there. The Sea at Spring-tyde appeared like blood, and the Tide being gone the
shapes of men's bodies were visible on the Sands; Many women as if bereaved of
their wits, prophesied that some tremendous desolation was at hand which much
elevated the Britains, and dejected the Romans. Whether these things happened
from natural causes, or by illusion of the Devil or ill men, or whether the
Almighty would hereby warn the people of approaching calamities, I shall not
now determine, only mention them as matters of Fact. But they were chiefly
provoked to an insurrection by the just complains of our Valiant Heroine Queen
Veadicia.

And now I am at length arrived to the subject matter of my History, and have
purposely made so large a Prologue, for though in a book of the same volumn
called Englands Monarchs, I have given some brief account of some of these
Transactions, yet I had never so pertinent an opportunity to enlarge upon
particulars as at this time, wherein I have given a succinct account of the
Original Inhabitants of these famous Islands with as much truth and authority
as things of so great Antiquity will allow.

To proceed; Queen Voadicia made many sensible Remonstrances to the Britains
of the unsufferable wrongs had been put upon her, and because they found her
earnestly bent upon revenge, and perceived her inveterate hatred to the Romans,
they made use of her name and authority with the People, and chose her their
Commander in chief against their Enemies, and entering into a general
conspiracy, wherein the Londoners and Essexians were engaged, they raised an
Army of an hundred thousand men, and without scrupling het sex willingly
submitted to her Conduct as Captain General; who ordering a place to be erected
where she might be heard of all, she made a long and pertinent Oration to
encourage them in this gallant undertaking; Her tall and comely Person, her
severe countenance and Majestic voice; Her tresses of Hair hanging below her
middle with her noble Apparel caused reverence and admiration in the multitude,
she wore a massy Chain of Gold about her neck, and a glorious Garment of diverse
colors next her, over which was a Royal Robe of State, a Spear in her hand,
and a Crown on her head; in which Equipage she thus addressed her self to the
Army.

I doubt not (Dear Lovers, Friends and Companions in Arms) but every one here
present is very sensible how much freedom and liberty is to be valued before
bondage and thraldom, but if hitherto any of you have been so deceived by the
illusions of the Romans as not to perceive much difference, yet I hope that now
you have tried both, your judgment is better informed, and by the miserys you
have suffered you will acknowledge your mistake and recant your former error;
And if some of you have preferred Foreign power above the Laws and Customs of
your own Country, I question not but you now perfectly understand that poverty
with liberty is much better than riches to which servitude is entailed. For
what can possibly happen more intolerable to the nature of man, than what the
Romans since their entering this Island have inflicted upon us? Are we not all
deprived of our Lands and Estates? Do we not Till the ground for their
advantage, and yet do we not pay all kind of Tributes, yea our very carcases
are subject to their pleasures; How much better is it then to hazard all
thereby to become Free indeed, than under the false name and pretext of Liberty
to pay continually for the worst of slaverys? How much more commendable is it
to lose our lives in defense of our Country, than not to have even our own
heads toll free, but to be daily oppressed and laden with innumerable
exactions? But why do I repeat these things, since they will not suffer Death
it self to make us free, for none here is ignorant how much we are forced to
pay for those that are dead; No Nations were ever under such dismal slavery but
that by death they were always discharged from bondage, the Romans only make
dead Vassals to be still alive to them, only to increase their gain and
advantage; If any of us are without money (as I know not well how we should get
any) then are we robbed of all that is in our Houses, which are left desolate
and we our selves remain as dead within them. And how shall we expect better
usage hereafter since they already deal so cruelly with us, but to speak the
truth, we our selves are the Authors of our own Calamities, who at first
suffered them to set foot on our Island, and did not immediately drive them
back, as we did Caesar, or kill them ere they were settled; or make them
sensible how dangerous it was to attempt any thing against us, as we sometimes
treated Agustus and Caligula; We therefore who inhabit this Island which for
the largeness thereof may be called another World, incompast with the Sea; We I
say, whose name and Nation have been for many ages hid from the most learned
and inquiring men, are now contemned and despised by those who aim at nothing
but Tyranny and the invading other men's Rights; Therefore my well-beloved
Citizens, Friends and Kindred (for so are all the native Britains) Let us now,
even now attempt what we have too long neglected, and while the remembrance of
our ancient liberty remains with us let us unanimously join together and
perform what becomes People of renowned valor and courage, that we may at
length enjoy not the name only, but freedom it self, and thereby leave examples
of magnanimity to our posterity, for if we who have been brought up in freedom
should utterly forget our former felicity, what will become of our successors
who will be born and bred to thraldom and misery? I do not rehearse these
things to provoke your dislike of your present condition being fully satisfied
you already sufficiently abhor it, nor to frighten you with vain fears of what
may hereafter come to pass, since nothing is more certain than the destruction
we foresee will happen if things continue in this posture; But that I may
return you hearty thanks for your readiness and willingness to engage in this
Common Cause without any dread of the Roman Power; If you respect their numbers
they are no greater than yours; If their strength, they are no stonger, as
appears by your Armor and Weapons, and by the Walls, Ditches, and Trenches you
have made to defend your selves, and offend your Foes afar off according to the
rules of martial discipline; Therefore we do far exceed them in force, our arms
are stronger than their stone Walls, and our Targets far less cumbersome and
more useful than their heavy armor, so that if we obtain the victory our
adversaries must be all our prisoners, or if we lose the Field our escape will
be easy, for we have the Marshes below to hide and the hills above to defend
our selves against their fury, who being laden with their own arms, will
neither be able to pursue us if we fly, nor to escape us if themselves should
be defeated, and if at any time they make Sallies upon us out of their Camp we
may follow and take them as birds in a Net; In all which things as they are
inferior to us so especially are they unable to endure hunger, thirst, cold,
and heat as we can do. In their Houses and Tents likewise they cannot subsist
without their baked Meats, Oil, and Shadows from the burning heat of the Sun,
if any of these fail them they either dye presently or else languish and
consume with sickness, whereas to us Britains every herb and root is food,
every juice an oil, all water pleasant, and every shady tree an House; Beside,
no place of advantage in the Country is unknown to us for our security,
whereas the Romans are utterly ignorant where they march; We can with ease
either clothed or naked swim over those deep Rivers which they with their great
Ships are scarce able to perform; Let us therefore with assurance of good
success fall upon them courageously and make them understand that since they
are no better than Hares and Foxes it will be an unequal match to engage
against Greyhounds and Wolves.

At which words Voadicia lets slip a Hare she had concealed under her garments
as an Omen to them of their good success and accordingly, all the people raised
loud shouts of approbation and consent to what she had declared resolving
unanimously to revenge the violences offered to so magnanimous and worthy a
Princess. Then Voadicia again commanding silence proceeded in a Prayer to
Adraste one of the British Deities with her hands elevated, to this purpose.

I give thee thanks O Adraste, and call upon thee thou worthiest of women, who
do not reign over the slavish Egyptians like Nicotius, nor over their
Merchants as Simiramis, for these fables we have lately learnt of the Romans;
Neither do thou rule over the people of Rome as not long since Messalina and
Agrippina did, and as Nero does now, who is called a man, but by his voice, his
harp and his woman's attire appears of the other Sex, but I address my self to
thee as the Goddess that governest the Britains, who employ themselves not in
tilling the Fields, or mechanic Trades, but in the more noble Art of War, who
have their Wives and Children as well as all other things in common whereby
women arrive to the same audacity and boldness in battle with men; Therefore
since I have obtained a kingdom in so mighty and gallant a Nation, I beseech
thee grant them conquest and liberty, and subdue those wicked contentious men
who Tyrannize over them, if they may be properly called men who indulge
themselves with warm baths, delicate fare, hot Wines, sweet Oils, soft beds and
pleasant Music to gratify their outrageous lusts, and who are altogether
addicted to avarice and cruelty as their actions have too plainly discovered.
Let not I beseech thee the Neronian tyranny any more prevail against me, or
rather against thee, but make those submit to thee, whose heavy oppressions
upon thy people thou have so long been sensible of, and be thou our Protector
and defender O most noble Lady we humbly beseech thee.

Having concluded her prayer she proceeds with all alacrity against her
enemies, who were at that time without a Commander, Paulinus being then
confined in the Isle of Anglesey as has been said; The Romans in Garrison at
Camoludunum sent for more aid to Caius the Treasurer, who could furnish them
with only two hundred ill armed men; the City was not fortified either with
Ditch or Rampart they being persuaded by those in the Conspiracy that the able
youth within were a sufficient defense, so that not suspecting any assault the
Britains easily overthrew all before them, entering and burning the City, and
slaying all they met with, the Romans being so amazed at the mighty force of
the Britains that they made very weak resistance, so that in two days the
place was won, and every Soul within it slain; The Britains encouraged with
this first success, went to encounter Petus with the ninth Legion, whom they
soon vanquished killing all the Foot, Petus with the Horse narrowly escaping
back into the Trenches; Caius the Treasurer affrighted with this overthrow and
sensible of the hatred of the Britains toward him who by his covetousness had
occasioned all these mischiefs fled over to France; But Paulinus advertised of
all, with much courage broke through his enemies, and marched toward London,
where at that time were few Romans, it being full of Merchants and Merchandise;
when considering the weakness of his forces, and the fate of Petus he concluded
not to venture all for recovering one Town, and therefore retired into places
of safety, nothing moved with the prayers and tears of his Countrymen who
craved succor from him.

After this, Ver^lamium a famous Roman City near St. Albans ran the same fate,
being utterly destroyed by the Britains who leaving the Castles and strong
Forts unassaulted pursued their Victory by plundering all the Romans in the
open Country, using their conquest with so much cruelty that it is recorded
they slew above seventy thousand Romans, carrying Fire, Gibbets, and other
instruments of revenge wherever they went, sparing neither age nor Sex; Some
Noble Ladies they hanged up naked, cutting off their duggs and forcing them
into their mouths that they might seem to feed on them, and others were impaled
upon stakes, with all manner of barbarities that a people bereaved of their
liberties could invent for revenge upon their oppressors. At the same time
feasting and sacrificing to Andates the Goddess of Victory in the Roman Temples.

Mean while Paulinus having received a supply of ten thousand Soldiers, and
finding a scarcity in his Camp, resolved to give the enemy battle, choosing an
advantageous place very narrow, and backed by a thick wood; The Britains
confident in their multitude and good fortune, resolved to engage them though
at disadvantage, and Queen Voadicia conducting them, the other Ladies being
placed in Chariots to see the fight) she with her daughters mounted in a lofty
Chariot rid through the armed Bands, encouraging the Soldiers of diverse
Countries to fight valiantly though under a woman's command, it being the custom
of the Britains to make no distinction of Sexes, and that she came not now
among them as a person of high birth and Nobility to fight for her kingdom, but
as one equal with themselves, who sought to regain their freedom and to revenge
her self on her enemies for scourging her like a Vagabond, and deflouring her
daughters, whose lascivousness was insupportable, having whipped her an ancient
Lady stark naked to satisfy their malice, and ravished her daughters to cool
their filthy lust, but (says she) The Gods are at hand to take just vengeance
on their villainies; The Legion which presumed to encounter us is destroyed, the
rest fled into their strong Holds unable to endure the noise of our multitudes,
if you therefore scriously consider what moved you to engage in this War; you
will certainly resolve within your selves either to die with honor in battle,
or to vanquish your implacable adversaries, for I though a woman have made this
resolution, rather than to be ever again brought into bondage.

Paulinus was not wanting to encourage his Soldiers by telling them, there
were more women than men in the British Army, and many of them being without
Armor and unskilled in discipline would never endure the force of the Romans
who had so often put them to flight, and though their own number were small yet
would the glory be the greater to vanquish so vast a multitude with so few
hands, and that they ought not to regard the spoil till they had assured the
victory, which would then be certainly their own to divide at pleasure; The
Romans much encouraged by this Oration, the onset was given in those Streights
much to their advantage, who were but an handful in comparison of their
enemies, the fight at first was very obstinate and bloody, but the Britains
unable to relieve each other or incompass the Romans with their numbers in that
narrow place, or to sustain the violence of their Foes, were constrained to
retreat in disorder, and in a short time were utterly discomfited; There were
slain of the Britains that day near fourscore thousand as Tacitus writes, for
the Streights being stopped by their own Chariots the Britains could not easily
escape, and the Romans were so bent on revenge that they spared none in the
heat of the Battle, though they afterward took many Prisoners; There dyed of
the Romans in this memorable Battle not above four hundred, and as many
wounded; Those that escaped would have recruited and fought a second time, when
Queen Voadicia who had made her escape, after she had showed all the courage of
a gallant Commander, and had made such a notable though unsuccessful attempt
for redeeming he^ Country from Bondage, Doubting she might at one time or
other fall into the hands of her Enemies, (like another Lucretia) fell upon her
Sword and died. This happened in the seventy third year from our Saviors Birth.

After this several other Roman Emperors commanded here, as Galba, Otho,
Vitellius, Vespasian Titus, Domitian, Nerva, Trajan, Adrian, Antonin^^,
Commodus, Pertinax, Didius, Severus, Caracalla, M^crinus, Heliogabilus, and
others, Theodosius being the last that had power in Britain in 423. when the
Goth who had served under the Romans twenty years, being disobliged, rose
against them, and caused dreadful devastations in the Empire, forcing them to
leave their Conquests, after they had commanded here 500 years; When they took
their last farewell, but had levied so many Soldiers from hence for Foreign
Countries that the Land was almost unpeopled, so that the Britains were at
length obliged to call in the Saxons against their new Enemies the Picts, and
having overcome them, they themselves finally made a complete Conquest of the
whole Country except Wales, whither the Britains fled for safety, and
continue there to this day.

The History of Mariamne the wife of King Herod.
Mariamne, wife of King Herod

HErod a furious Monster made of blood
Who boldly God and Natures Laws withstood
Neither with Virtue, nor with Grace indu'd
Of Visage hideous, and of manners rude.
To whom the beauteous Mariamne was
A Chaft and Loyal wife; But yet alas!
He that used Tyranny and foul debate
As well in Love as in his Royal state.
This Virtuous Queen did from the Earth remove
To seat her in a Higher state above.
Who lives thus bravely, and thus leaves breath
Makes of a Dying life a living Death.
ABout fifty years before the birth of our Savior the Kingdom of Judea, which
had continued through many invissitudes from the time of King David almost a
thousand years, was brought into great distractions by the discord between two
Brothers; The Chief Rulers over the Jews who had for many years contented
themselves with the title of Governors or High Priests, now aspire to the name
of Kings among whom Hircanus reigned, a good man but a bad King, who had
honesty and innocence, but not sufficient prudence nor courage to manage so
great a charge; He being sensible of his own weakness freely resigned the
Kingdom to his brother Aristobulus, a valiant and stout though unsuccessful
Prince; At which time Antipater the Father of Herod an Idumean being a wealthy
desiquing person, resolved to take the opportunity of those concussions in the
state to advance himself to the Throne, but found it would be very difficult to
attain his ends whilst the courageous Aristobulus bare sway, he therefore sowes
seditious seeds of revolt among the People, intimating That they had done very
ill in removing so good a Prince and suffering him to be dethroned to promote
another who was of so turbulent and violent a spirit that they should soon find
his ill management of affairs would occasion much defolation in Palestine, but
however it was not yet too late to prevent the threatened mischeifs if they
would return to their Loyalty and duty and again restore Hyrcanus to the
Government, whose modesty in declining advancement made him appear most worthy
of having it bestowed upon him.

The common people not reaching the depth of Antipaters designs (who if he
could again advance Hyrcanus did not question but by the facility of his nature
he might bring all into his own power, and raise up a Monarchy to himself and
Heirs,) began to give ear to his Remonstrancers, especially those that loved
change, and some out of a sense of Justice; Antipater having thus begun,
resolved to prosecute the bu^^ess to the utmost, endeavoring to gain the good
opinion of Hyrcanus by all manner of observances, and pretenses of friendship
which at length prevailed so much upon his easy temper, that Hyrcanus resigned
himself and his affairs absolutely to his conduct; whereupon Antipater
proceeded to represent to him his great miscarriage in suffering the Kingdom to
be taken from him, and earnestly persuaded him to endeavor to resume it; but
found this motion received very cold entertainment from Hyrcanus who objected
the breach of his Oath, whereby he had absolutely renounced the Sovereignty and
his inability to regain it with force; to the first Antipater replied, That the
matter of the Oath was illegal, and thereby void in it self, and to the second,
that he would supply him with Arabians who should enable him to recover his
right; By such discourses he at length gained him, especially by instilling
jealousies into his mind that Aristobulus designed to take away his life, so
that Antipater having engaged Arethas an Arabian King in the quarrel, he comes
into Jude^ ^ith a great Army ruining all before him, and at length driving
Aristobulus into Jerusalem which they besieged; At which very time the Romans
ambitious of enlarging their already immense Dominions sent Pompey the Great
into Syria, whose Forces so far surmounted the Arabians that they durst not
stand before him, but were scattered as chaff before the wind, and the whole
Country soon reduced to their obedience; The two Brothers both plead their
cause at the feet of Pompey, who seemed more inclined to Aristobulus, he having
prepossest his mind by a Noble present of a Golden Vine, accounted one of the
greatest rarities in the world; and other rich Gifts.

Antipater perceiving which way things tended and doubting his projects would
miscarry endeavored by all kind of aspersions and misrepresentations to render
Aristobulus odious and suspected by the Romans, who penetrating into his
designs was so enraged that he desperately engaged against the strength of that
mighty Empire, but soon found the match very unequal, Aristobulus himself was
taken Prisoner and laid in fetters, and with his two Sons and as many daughters
carried to Rome to heighten the glory of Pompeys Triumph, Jerusalem is brought
under Tribute, and Hyrcanus (late King) now constituted High Priest but the
chief authority given to Antipater, who in his name managed all affairs, and at
length being sensible of the weakness of the High Priest, and his own strength,
he makes his eldest Son Phaselus Governor of Jerusalem and Herod his youngest
Tetrarch of Galilee.

After his death the two brothers endeavor equally to obtain the favor of
Hyrcanus making him own what either of them had done; Yet Herod seemed to be of
the most aspiring humor, who being as politic and intreguing as his Father,
gained much interest among the Romans by all manner of submission and Services,
thereby hoping at length to obtain the kingdom which yet seemed at a great
distance from him, his elder brother being alive, and ruling the greatest part
of Judea, and Aristobulus who was in Chains at Rome having likewise two Sons;
The eldest named Alexander Father to our excellent Mariamne and Antigonus, the
youngest; Alexander who succeeded his Father in misfortune getting some forces
together attempted the recovering his Country but was soon suppressed by the
Romans who assisted Herod and by their Order beheaded; Antigonus and his Father
Aristobulus escaping from Rome fled to the Parhians, who engaged to reestablish
him in the kingdom, and came upon Herod so suddenly and with so much fury,
though Hyrcanus and Phaselus were joined with him that they discomfited Herod's
Army and had almost surprised his Person, which so much astonished him that he
was ready to have fallen upon his own Sword, Phaselus his brother unable to
bear so strange a change of fortune beat out his brains against the side of a
rock, and Hyrcanus by the cruel command of Antigonus had his ears cut off,
being thereby made forever incapable of the Office of High Priest.

Herod being a little recovered from his amazement, resolved still to throw
himself upon the assistance of the Romans, imploring their help, and
representing the mischiefs committed by Antigonus, and with all manner of arts
so far insinuated himself into their favor, that he is declared King of Judea,
and Antigonus at the same time proclaimed an utter enemy to the Empire, who
being taken by Mark Antony was beheaded at Antioch, and Herod thereby secured
in the Throne, Hyrcanus being carried Captive to the Parthians, he there
continued peaceably, little moved with all the horrible changes he had met
with; However he was much respected by the Jews that fled thither for security
from their own Country, who gave him as great reverence as if he were still
their King, though now in Captivity in a strange Land; Herod hearing of it, and
fearing the consequence, sends great gifts and earnest Letters to the Parthian
King, beseeching him to send home Hyrcanus his Father and Benefactor that he
might share the Scepter with him, and have the comfort of so faithful a Friend
and Counselor; The King of Parthia sensible what interest Herod had with the
Romans, give Hyrcanus leave to go whither he pleased, who resolved to return to
Jerusalem, though dissuaded by his most faithful friends, and was there
received with much seeming kindness by Herod who had now all the Royal Family
of Judea in his own power.

Alexandra the daughter of Hyrcanus a woman of an imperious Spirit was Wife to
Alexander aforementioned by whom she had two Children. Aristobulus, and
Mariamne; This daughter was reckoned one of the greatest beauties in the World,
and admired by many Neighbor Princes, and therefore could hardly escape the
observation of Herod, who required her in marriage of her Grandfather and
Mother, who having neither courage nor power to deny, and hoping she might
incline him to be kind to the Royal blood, gave her to him for a Wife, though
she her self were sensible that she was hereby delivered into the paw of the
Lion, who might seem to take delight in her beauty but would at length destroy
her. Yet perferring obedience to her Parents before her own safety she seemed
contented with their determination; But though this marriage might seem
somewhat to fortify his Title to the kingdom, yet Herod was unquiet whilst so
many others appeared to have more right thereto, and already showed his
disaffection to these his new Allies; For Hyrcanus being incapable of holding
the High Priesthood because of his deformity in the loss of his ears, all men's
eyes were upon Aristobulus brother to Mariamne a Person of excellent hopes and
bred up in the Court whereby he was accomplished for this great Office; But
Herod doubting he had already too much favor with the People designed to
prefer another Jew named Ananel whom he had found out beyond Euphrates;
Mariamne perceiving by this how her family was affronted, and what an indignity
it would be for her brother to be deprived of that honor, which by nature and
kindred he seemed designed for, being of a generous mind addressed her self to
Herod telling him; That her brother was the only hope of her house, which yet
was so decayed that he had no reason to be suspected of attempting the Crown;
If he would bestow the High Priests Office on him he would make him his
Creature who was yet so young that any impression might be made upon him, and
that this act would indear him in the affections of his Subjects to be so kind
to a Grandson of Hyrcanus whose virtue they had always admired. Herod was
persuaded by these pressing reasons from so sweet a Tongue and constituted
young Aristobulus High Priest dismissing Ananel who at present did officiate;
Alexandra the mother was so transported at the news that she wept for joy and
freely declared to Herod; That she was ambitious of no more advancement for her
Son, and did absolutely renounce all pretensions to the kingdom, and could now
dye very well satisfied since she was so happy to see her daughter a Queen and
her Son High Priest.

At the feast of Tabernacles Aristobulus then but seventeen years old entered
into his Office, and was much reverenced by the Jews who had a great opinion
that he would equal if not exceed his Predecessors. They remembered that his
Grandfather Hyrcanus was but like a Statue, and Aristobolus was carried in
Chains to Rome like a Gally-slave, and his Father Alexander and Uncle Antigous
had lost their lives by opposing foreign Servitude, and hoped that this young
Prince who had escaped so many Shipwracks was reserved for some notable Service
to his Country; Herod whose jealousy never slept, observing with what
affection the people received him, caused Spies to be set upon him, his Sister
and Mother, so that they could not stir out of the Palace but he had notice of
it; Mariamne was so discreet as not to discover much resentment at this unkind
usage, but her mother Alexandra not enduring this Royal confinement, resolved
to endeavor her freedom, and therefore writes to Cleopatra the renowned Queen
of Egypt, who upon many accounts had an aversion to Herod, complaining of the
calamities she suffered from him, and entreating her assistance in order to
their deliverance, or that she would afford them a sccure retreat into her
kingdom till the storm of Herod's jealousy was over-blown.

Cleopatra invited her to come with all speed into Egypt with her Son, and that
she should think it her glory to be instrumental in serving so great a
Princess, whereupon she resolved secretly to depart with Aristobulus her Son,
not daring to impart the secret to her daughter Mariamne least the tenderness
of her Nature should divert her from so perilous an attempt; She then caused
two Coffins to be made in which she contrived her self and Son should be
carried out in the night, and put into a Bark prepared for that purpose which
should instantly sail into Egypt, but one of her Servants discovering the
design to Herod he took no notice thereof till it was put in execution, and
then seizing the Coffins surprised them both, yet seemed not much concerned but
pretended to pardon her out of the greatness of his Spirit, though the chief
cause was the fear of disobliging Cleopatra whom he knew would highly resent
it, however he inwardly resolved to make away Aristobulus after some time, that
it might not be suspected to be any act of revenge in him.

When the Feast was over Herod went to Jericho where he was entertained at the
house of Alexandra, and feigned to have buried all past actions in oblivion,
entertaining Aristobulus with much endearedness, and playing like a young man
with him at several sports, wherewith they exercised themselves so long that
being all in a great heat, they concluded to cool their bodies in the adjoining
River which was shaded with Trees and pleasant Arbors; Aristobulus by the
persuasions of Herod went in likewise, when Herod's Confederates whom he had
hired to commit the murder came toward him, and pretending to hold him in
sport under water, they never left him till he was stifled therein.

The news coming to Jerusalem the whole City was drowned in tears, and the
women made woeful lamentations over the dead body, and all thought themselves
concerned in this public loss, but especially Alexandra the mother, who was so
enraged at this unspeakable mischief, especially since she was sensible how
treacherously he was destroyed; yet durst not discover her knowledge lest it
should prevent her revenge; Mariamne who suffered in the sorrows of her mother,
had not the least share in this deplorable misfortune, especially in the death
of a Brother whom she loved as her own life, and though endued with
extraordinary patience and discretion, could now hardly resist the impetuous
violence of her passion, and approaching the Corpse of her Brother, I have
nothing now left in this world, says she, either to fear or hope, he for whom I
feared and for whom I hoped being now by a secret providence of Heaven taken
from me, to whose will I desire entirely to resign my self in all things,
resolving for the future to wean my soul from all temporal felicities, and
place my affections upon more divine and sublime objects.

Herod endeavored to make it appear by his external behavior, and the
magnificence of his Funeral whereat he shed many tears, that he was no way
accessory to his death, though Alexandra who knew the truth of the business was
the more enraged thereat, and resolved to bring speedy vengeance on his head
for the same, and therefore sent Cleopatra a full account of the whole matter,
and incited her by all means to assist her, who having long desired occasion
against Herod, enjoined Mark Anthony the Roman General and her Lover to call
him to account for his Villainies, who having obtained the Kingdom without any
just Title imbrued his hands in the blood of the Royal Family, Mark Anthony
disliking this cruel act sent for Herod to appear and answer the accusations
laid against him, who not daring to deny, though he much feared Cleopatra's
violent prosecution, went to Anthony committing the Government of his Kingdom
in his absence to his Uncle Joseph with secret Orders, That if any mischief
should happen to him and prevent his return he should put Mariamne to death,
for whom he had such an extravagant passion that he was either jealons or
envious any should enjoy her even after his decease.

When Herod was gone Joseph was very conversant with Mariamne, both upon
account of public affairs, and for his own private divertisement, wherein he
often discourst of the extraordinary Passion Herod had for her, whom he valued
above all the World, Alexandra the mother seemed to laugh and slight these
pretended kindnesses of Herod to her daughter, judging them not real but upon
design, when Joseph being earnest to confirm the truth of his assertions,
unadvisedly replied; That nothing could be a greater evidence of his ardent
love for her than that he could neither live nor die without her, since if he
should miscarry in his Journey he had commanded him to put her to death, to
accompany him into the other World.

The Ladys were much scandalized at this kind of passion, and considered it not
as a demonstration of Herod's good will to her, but rather a manifestation of
his sanguinary and malicious nature, who at his death would have her perish
with him. At this time there was a report raised by Herod's enemies in Jerusalem
that M. Anthony had inflicted so great torments upon him that he died under
them, whereupon all his Court were much disturbed and especially the Ladys, so
that Alexandra persuaded Joseph to remove from Court, and secure themselves
under the protection of the Roman Legions (who were at that time quartered
about the City under the command of Julius the Tribune) where they might be
safe if any mischief should happen in the Kings house and have the Romans
assistance, and that afterward if M. Anthony did but see her daughter Mariamne
he would be so taken with her beauty that she might obtain all things at his
hands, and no doubt he would restore her to her Kingdom and Royal dignity;
While they were thus consulting there came Letters from Herod of his sudden
return, who coming into the presence of M. Anthony obtained so much favor by
the rich Presents he made him, that the matter being suddenly heard it was soon
determined in his favor, and Anthony fully appeased and satisfied, though it
were little pleasing to Cleopatra, to whom Anthony pleaded; That there was no
reason a King should be acountable for what he did in his own Kingdom, since he
would thereby cease to be King, who with that dignity had all other Regal power
and authority given to him; Herod at length returned with large Testimonials of
the favor of M. Anthony, who entertained him with much kindness in several
public Feasts and Assemblies; Cleopatra likewise renounced her pretenses to
Judea, having received of M. Anthony, Caelosyria instead of it.

Upon his arrival his Mother and Sister Solome the wife of Joseph gave him a
full account of the intentions of Alexandra and her Friends, accusing also her
husband Joseph of two much intimacy with Mariamne (who it seems had once
objected to them the meanness of their birth.) Herod was much disturbed at the
news, but however the inflamed affection he bore toward Mariamne restrained him
from that violence which his rage and jealousy suggested to him, and therefore
examining her strictly what secret familiarity had passed between her and
Joseph, she by many solemn Oaths and Protestations, with all manner of
Allegations of her innocence, so far appeased him that he was fully satisfied
she had sufficiently cleared her self from all those slanders raised against
her, so that he gave her a thousand thanks for her conjugal fidelity and
affection to him, and openly declared the great esteem and love he had for her;
At length as it often happens among Lovers, both fell into tears and embraced
each other with a most indearing passion, whereupon Mariamne said covertly to
him; It is no great sign of such unfeigned Love that thou wast so unkind to
give command if any ill should happen to thee I should instantly be put to
death, had who never in the least offended thee, neither is it any great
argument of love to a wife to desire her company in another World.

Herod seemed thunderstruck with these words, and fell into such a monstrous
rage that he cried out and tore his hair with the greatest fury imaginable,
saving, He had now very evident proof that Joseph had committed Adultery with
her, since he would never have discovered what he had so strictly enjoined him
to keep secret unless they had put great confidence in each other, and that
there were much intimacy between them; And in this furious jealousy he could
hardly refrain from killing his wife, yet his former love at length returning,
he forbore though with much inward trouble and emotion; However he ordered
Joseph to be instantly put to death without Trial or Justification, and
committed Alexandra the author of all these troubles close Prisoner.

After this Aretas the Arabian King refusing to pay Herod his accustomed
Tribute, he pretends to make War against him, and coming suddenly upon the
Arabians was in great probability of obtaining the conquest, when Athenio who
then commanded some of Cleopatra's Forces in those parts, bearing a secret
grudge to Herod, stood ready to observe the event of the battle, resolving not
to meddle if the Arabians overcame, but they having the worst, he sent them a
fresh supply who snatched the Victory out of the hands of the Jews and made a
great slaughter among them, so that they were wholly discomfited; Though Herod
with some recruits made diverse successful inroads afterward into Arabia, and
prevailed notably against them; Whereat being much elevated his joy was soon
checked by the death of Mark Anthony his Patron who was slain by Augustus
Caesar in the battle of Astium, and his Army wholly overthrown; Wherewith Herod
was much dismayed, not doubting but he should be severely treated for
entertaining so strict a friendship and alliance with him as he had hitherto
done; His Friends and Enemies judged him a lost man, yet having escaped so many
dangers he resolves not to despair but to find out Caesar then at Rhodes and
prostrate himself before him, but was loath to undertake this Voyage while
Hyrcanus the only remainder of the Royal Line was alive, and his own friends
gave a seeming pretense to effect his wicked purpose.

For Hyrcanus being of a very mild temper was unwilling all his life time to
intermeddle in state affairs, but Alexandra his daughter a proud aspiring woman
solicited him continually no longer to suffer Herod's Tyranny, who was the
plague of their Family, but to endeavor to resettle himself in the Kingdom;
Which motion he at first absolutely refused, but by her continual importunity
was at length prevailed upon by her advice to send to the Governor of Arabia to
assist him with some Horsemen to make his escape from Jerusalem; The Letters
being intercepted and brought to Herod he commanded Hyrcanus to be presently
put to death; After which Alexandra and Mariamne were more closely confined
than before, yet the daughter endeavored to sweeten the discontents of the
Mother, though she her self received no comfort but from Heaven, and thus
discourst with her self; How unhappy am I above all women, from the time the
Diadem was placed on my head, I have felt nothing but Thorns, and Royal Dignity
has been to me Royal slavery, but since I can find no consolation here, I must
expect it in another place to which I care not how soon I remove.

Hyrcanus being thus dispatched the bloody Herod addresseth himself with more
satisfaction to his Journey to Caesar, and committed Alexandra and his wife
close Prisoners, in the Castle of Alexandriam to the custody of Sohemus the
Itrurian, giving him strict order that if any finister hap befell him he should
kill them both, and endeavor to the utmost to retain the Kingdom in his
Family; Here these poor Ladys were detained in a continual expectation of
death, and every visit the Jailer made them, expected he came to fetch them to
execution, but at length Sohemus growing more familiar with his Royal
Prisoners, Mariamne presumed to ask him, what news there was abroad, adding;
That though they were now in this deplorable condition yet she did not doubt
but that the storm would blow over, and we (says she) may be able to reward
your kindness, therefore pray tell us why Herod has locked us up here, and how
his Affairs stand. Sohemus wonderfully surprised at these words, knew not what
return to make, but at length overcome by their repeated entreaties, he gave a
full account of his Commission, Well then, said the poor Princess, we must dye
whatever happens, wherever I turn me I behold the Image of death with which I
now begin to be well acquainted.

Herod all stained with blood was now imbarqued in his Voyage to Caesar, and
being admitted into his presence freely declared what service he had done to
Mark Anthony, promising no less duty and service to him if he might be received
into his favor; Caesar observing the resolution wherewith he made his defense,
was inclined to embrace his Friendship, and setting the Diadem on his head
exhorted him to be as faithful to him as he had been to Anthony; Herod
over-joyed at this Royal bounty attended Caesar toward Egypt, and entertained
his Army by the way with all kind of Provisions, and having presented him with
eight hundred Talents for his many favors, returned to his own Kingdom where
he found Alexandra and Mariamne much discontented, especially his wife, who
could see no end of her miseries, and going to visit and give her an account of
his exalted fortune, she instead of receiving satisfaction therein burst forth
into a flood of tears, which so discontented Herod that he entered into new
jealousies, and was confirmed in his mind that she had an utter hatred and
aversion to him, so that he was even distracted between love and revenge, when
at the same time his Sister Salome and her mother having notice of his
disturbance resolved to take this opportunity to ruin her, and endeavored to
whet his anger by many vile slanders raised against her, which he seemed
willing to hear, yet had not the heart to attempt any thing against his wife,
who was both chaste and faithful to him, but not able to bear the many injuries
she imagined were offered her, presumed so much upon the entire affection he
bare toward her as sometimes publicly to reproach him with his crimes.

It happened one day that the King having withdrawn into his Banqueting room
sent for Mariamne, whom he entertained with all kind of pleasantness and
dalliance, but found her very averse to his humor, neither would she accept of
his addresses, but told him severely of his cruelty to her Father and Brother;
wherewith Herod extremely moved was ready to strike her, when Salome his Sister
hearing a noise within, sent the Butler (whom she had hired falsely to accuse
Mariamne) into the room, commanding him to tell the King, That his Wife had
prepared a drink to incite and quicken him to love; and if he found him
disturbed at it, and should inquire the meaning, to tell him boldly, That
Mariamne having prepared a Cup of Poison for his Majesty had been tempting him
to present it; Having delivered this message Herod was much troubled, and
caused one of Mariamnes most faithful Servants to be tortured and examined
concerning the Poison, judging it could not be undertaken without his
knowledge; He in the midst of his Torments confessed nothing about the
poisoning, but told the King, That the aversion Mariamne discovered toward him
proceeded from what Sobemus had revealed to her; He had scarce uttered these
words, when Herod cried out aloud, That if Sohemus who had hitherto been so
faithful to him and his Kingdom had declared his secret Orders to Mariamne, it
was a clear evidence of a criminal familiarity between them; and therefore
commanded him to be instantly seized and put to death.

He then resolved to bring his wife to a public trial, always endeavoring to
procure some color of Justice for hiding his most exorbitant actions, and
assembling his most intimate Friends, who with horror and silence expected the
conclusion of this Tragedy, he brings forth the courageous Mariamne who armed
with invincible constancy was little concerned, against whom the monster
belches out this accusation.

Dear Friends, it has pleased the Almighty to counterballance the prosperity
he has given me by many piercing misfortunes, and I who have escaped so many
dangers, and found safety in such great winds and tempests, have now met with
the most deplorable storms in my own House; You are all very sensible how
tenderly I have cherished the Family of Hyrcanus even in their greatest
calamities, and yet I have taken into my bosom a Serpent instead of a Dove, by
whom I have been often stung but have as often by patience cured my self, yet I
am not so unsensible that no injuries will penetrate me, and therefore being
provoked by new wrongs I can no longer suffer them; Behold the Queen my wife,
who (following her mothers example) is always studying to disquiet and hinder
my repose. For after my return from so perilous a Voyage when I brought her
the happy news of my success, she received me and my intelligence with the
greatest scorn and disdain, and denied me those favors which I had right to
demand, and she ought not to have refused to a husband, and not content
herewith, she proceeded to contrive bloody designs against me, endeavoring to
have suborned one of my own servants to poison me; Thus I who returned with my
head crowned with Laurel am made the mark of the malice and treachery of a
woman whom I can neither reclaim by love nor gifts no more than if she were a
Lioness; Judge you therefore whether it is not time for me to secure my self
from so implacable a creature, who can never be safe so long as she lives.

Mariamne knowing it in vain to defend her self (though she was altogether
innocent of the charge laid against her,) being sensible his violent nature
would not be contradicted, made little reply, only as to the business of
poisoning she appealed to all the Assembly, whether there were any probability
of it since she was always more afraid of Herod's love than hatred; But however
she declared, That her life was a burden to her having had little comfort in
it, and much loss in the Court wherein she never enjoyed the least contentment,
and that if false Testimonies must make her guilty, none were safe, it being
very easy thereby to remove any who should be thought troublesome, and though
her husband did deprive her of her head, yet it was not in his power to bereave
her of the reputation of a Princess of Honor, which descended to her from her
Ancestors, and which she would carry to her Grave.

There were none found bold enough to plead the cause of this Innocent, or to
endeavor to mollify Herod's passion, but on the contrary all seemed to approve
of his resolution: Yet this bloody man began ostartle when he thought seriously
of being deprived of so sweet a Companion, and commanded her only to Custody;
But his Sister, the enraged Salome continually alleged the danger of some
sedition if he should keep her alive in Prison, so that at length he spoke
these bloody words; Let her be taken away; Whereupon instantly an Officer was
dispatched to her with this message, Madam the King commands that you shall
presently dye; She without any emotion replied, Let us then go, my Friend, it
cannot be more pleasing to Herod than it is welcome to me; And to Crown her
patience, Alexandra her own Mother and the Companion of her imprisonment
fearing the like usage from Herod and hoping to free her self from the
Suspicion of being concerned with her daughter in those crimes whereof Mariamne
was accused, went out to meet her going to execution, and very undecently
laying aside her former magnanimity, reproached this dying Innocent, crying
out, she was a wicked and ungrateful woman to her husband and well deserved the
punishment she was going to suffer for her vile attempt, and her ingratitude to
so loving and gracious a Prince, yea proceeded so far in her rage that she
would have dragged her on the pavement by the hair of the head had not the
people prevented her, who all condemned her shameful hypocrisy; Mariamne took
little notice of these horrid indignities only mildly answered, Mother, Let my
Soul depart in peace which is already upon my lips, and trouble not the repose
of my death; Then passing on with a generous filence and invincible courage and
unconcern to the place of execution she there put an end to all her sorrows (by
having her head divided from her body) which then began in the Spectators whose
eyes were full of tears and their hearts of grief to observe so much Nobility,
Virtue, Constancy and admirable Beauty sacrificed to the jealousy of a cruel
Tyrant; Who after her death became more powerfully inflamed in his affections
toward her, so that he would not believe she was dead, often calling for her as
if alive, but being at length recovered from this strange distraction, his
grief for her death exceeded his rage when living, wherewith he was so
overwhelmed that the Plays and Entertainments which he provided to divert his
thoughts profited him nothing and a plague happening soon after in the City, he
interpreted it as a just Judgment of God for the unjust death of his Queen; Her
unnatural Mother having again attempted something against Herod was put to
death; Her two sons when they grew up and understood this impious act of their
Father accounted him their mortal Enemy; whom he at length caused to be
strangled; So that Caesar hearing of it said; He had rather be Herod's swine
than his Son; Because the Jews will not kill nor eat Swine, This is that wicked
King Herod of whom we read in the Holy Scriptures, in whose reign our blessed
Savior was born, and who executed that merciless butchery upon the innocent
Infants of Bethlem, and committed many other horrible massacrees for which at
length the hand of God seized upon him by an horrible disease being visited
with a vehement pain and Ague; With an intolerable Itch over his whole body,
the Colic daylytormented him; His feet and Belly were swollen with the dropsy;
His privities putrified and bred worms, he had great difficulty of breathing,
and a violent cough; was almost famisht with hunger yet could not eat; All
which terrible afflictions made him weary of his life calling for a knife to
cut his throat, and five days after died miserably having reigned thirty seven
years.

The History of Clotilda Queen of France.
Clotilda Queen of France

THis Virtuous Queen by her True Zeal did cause
Renowned Clovis to embrace Christ's Laws
Who all his Pagan vain Idolatry
Did quite renounce and utterly defy.
And after by Heavens mighty help and aid
His fiercest Enemies his Power obeyed.
And Clovis by his Strength and Policy,
Founded the Potent, Great, French Monarchy.
Clotilda Earthly Glory did despise
And only True Religion does prize
Which to promote she spared no cost nor pains,
Fully assured of Everlasting gains.
CLovis the husband of our worthy Heroine was King of France in the year of our
Lord 485. And had scarce arrived to fifteen when he was seated on the Royal
Throne, a Prince of growing hopes, born to build up that Great Monarchy where
of his Predecessors had laid the foundation having the honor to be the first
king who received the Christian Religion which was the choicest Jewel in his
Crown; France was at that time divided into several petty Royalties to which
great privileges were annexed, yet acknowledging Clovis to be their Sovereign;
But this being little more than having the name and Title of King, Clovis
resolved if possible to become absolute Master of this goodly Country, to
obtain which he begins with the weakest and most obnoxious, whereby he at
length attained his end getting possession of the greatest part of Gaut, and
then having the County of Burgundy in his eye, he desires Gombalt at that time
Duke to let him have Clotilda (the daughter of his younger brother Chilperick
whom he had barbarously murdered) to wife, Gombalt was very averse to this
alliance, yet not daring to discover the real cause alleged that his Niece had
never the ambition to aim so high as to be Queen of France, and besides there
was one essential hindrance, namely the diversity of their Religion, it being a
thing without example that a Christian Lady should marry an Heathen Prince
which he could not permit to be done without manifest danger to her Soul and
wounding his own honor to all posterity. The French Ambassador replied; That
since his Master had a great respect for Clotilda, he was very well pleased
with her quality, and that it was probable his Master by converse with a
Princess of such admirable virtues and perfections might be at length induced
to embrace Christianity.

Gombalt said, Matters of so great consequence ought not to be left at
uncertainty; And with this answer dismissed the Messenger, hoping he had now
utterly prevented the match; but Clovis transported with an entire affection to
her, soon returned an answer to this objection, solemnly promising to renounce
his Pagan Superstition, and embrace Christianity; Whereat Gombalt was extremely
disturbed since he understood, that in case he gave a denial the King of France
would proceed to arms which might be fatal to his Country, especially since
many of the Burgundian Gentry were very conversant in the French Court and
passionately desired this alliance as the greatest security and advantage to
their Nation.

This business being of much importance, was not thought fit to be concluded
without the general consent of the States of the Country, who being assembled
to that purpose Gombalt endeavored by many arguments to infuse jealousies into
their minds of the great danger of being so nearly allied to so potent a
Monarchy, but found his allegations had little effect upon the Burgonians, who
unanimously concurred to have the marriage consummated, as the surest bond of
peace, since the French were become so powerful it was dangerous to deny them
any thing, and it might therefore be feared that the entreaties of a Lover
would be changed into the rage of a Conqueror; That Clotilda whose Piety to God
and love to her Country were both very eminent, might by her worthy demeanor
to her husband prevail upon him both to embrace Christianity, and to be very
kind to her Nation.

Gombalt could not well find an answer to these convictive reasons, but at
length raised another scruple; That Clotilda had vowed Virginity to Heaven, and
was resolved not to be married at all; At this the Ambassador smiled, desiring
she might be called that her self might give him his answer; Clotilda being
asked the question replied; That she had never yet been so devout to make any
vow of Virginity, and though she were extremely pleased with her present
retirement, yet if her Uncle thought fit to marry her to the King of France
upon condidition he would become a Christian, she would not be so undiscreet to
refuse it. At these words the Ambassador and his Attendants gave a loud shout
declaring the marriage was concluded; Gombalt dissembled his resentment fince
he could not prevent the appointments of Heaven, and therefore made speedy
provision for her Journey into France saying, Well Neice I now find you are of
the humor of most other women, and had rather be a Queen than continue with an
Uncle, your affectation of glory exceeding your devotion, however I am very
well satisfied with your choice and wish you all manner of content therein,
having always made it my endeavor to advance your family according to my
power; And as for the death of your Parents I take God to witness no man was
more concerned thereat than my self it being done by the advice of my Council
to secure the peace and welfare of my Subjects, and now I hope though you leave
your Country you will not forget to perform all good Offices in your power for
the benefit thereof.

After this he kissed her, and taking his leave Clotilda began to weep, though
she had never more cause of Joy, being now delivered out of the paw of the
Lion, and going to be the wife of a Great Monarch, who expected her at Soissons
with the utmost impatience, and at her arrival was even transported at his
happiness in the enjoyment of so absolute a beauty and so discreet a Princess,
He embraced her with the most tender affection and was never weary of gazing on
her; She fell at his feet, and told him, She came to offer her service to him
as her Lord and King, and to be subject to all his commands; He quickly takes
her up, kisses her, and entertains her with the most indearing expressions of
kindness; The Nobility and People adored her even almost to Idolatry, and
nothing was to be seen in the Court but Feasting Comedies and all manner of
diversions and demonstrations of satisfaction.

The Queen would not suffer her self to be too much elevated with these
prosperities, for she had still some kind of concernment how to manage the main
affair which was the Conversion of her Lord, and therefore during the
preparations for solemnizing the Nuptials, she offered diverse occasions to him
to discourse of Religion, which he as politickly evaded, but at length taking
courage she resolved to discover her mind, and spoke thus to him; I find your
Majesty has so generous a soul that you bestow your bounty and liberality upon
all the World, and have therefore no reason to doubt your denial of one request
that I shall make to you; The King supposing she would ask some favor for one
of her Attendants readily answered; Madam, Whatever you defire cannot be denied
and therefore ask confidently what you please and it shall be granted; Well
then says she, if your Majesty has that kindness for me which you seem to
demonstrate, I would beseech you that I might not enter the bed of a Pagan the
first night of my Nuptials, but that I may embrace a Christian for my Husband
and Sovereign, than which nothing can be more desirable to your most obedient
Wife; The King a little surprised told her, It was not yet time to think of
that matter, though he would take the first opportunity to consider seriously
of it, and act accordingly, his thoughts being now too much employed in
admiring her perfections to think of any thing else, but however she need not
scruple in the mean time to converse with a Pagan Husband, since her own Law
taught her, That the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife.

Clotilda somewhat doubted whether she should embrace his company till he had
fulfilled his promise; but fearing to exasperate and make him quite reject
Christianity, she resolved to render him all marriage duties, and endeavor to
gain him by her prayers and good example. The King observing her discreet
carriage was very much pleased, and respected her the more, who finding she had
an absolute Empire over his heart, used her power with all kind of sweetness
and complasance, exercising her devotions with the greatest sincerity and
constancy, so that her Apartment seemed rather like an Oratory or Chapel, than
a place dedicated to vanity or pleasure, which the King having very often
observed it bred in him a very great inclination and reverence to her Religion
and caused him more highly to honor her Person; But upon occasion he would be
objecting to her some difficulties that appeared in the Christian Religion, as
beleiving the Trinity and the Doctrine of a Crucified Jesus; The threats of
Judgment and promises of mercy in another life; And therefore he thought it
better to continue in his own Religion wherein he was educated, and did not
doubt but God would have mercy upon him since he practiced to the best of his
knowledge.

To this Clotilda answered; That he ought not to be deterred by such seeming
difficulties, fince God who created the Soul of man has made it capable of
beleiving things above the reach of human reason, and whose small understanding
must submit to the Divine Wisdom, and his finite knowledge must not think to
equal that which is infinite, since God alone is the immense Fountain of
Goodness, Wisdom and Knowledge; That if his Majesty should promise a Servant
what to his reason might seem impossible and incredible, yet he is bound to
believe it without any reply, as depending upon the Kings infallible word, now
if one smful mortal man does thus exact faith of another, why should you doubt
says she what the Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth has declared to be true?
Why should we not believe there are three Persons, and one only God, fince we
daily find our memory, understainding and will make but one Soul? Why should we
scorn to adore a Crucified Man, since nothing can more confirm our believe than
that Consideration, For if our blessed Savior had come to subdue the World by
Legions of Horses and Armies as your Majesty conquers Kingdoms, it would not
have appeared so great a wonder, but when only by sufferings and the cross he
has brought the greatest part of the World, yea many Crowned heads under the
Dominion of his Laws and Precepts, this makes it appear that all is done only
by the Almighty power of God since so little of man is seen in it, I would
therefore humbly beseech your Majesty no longer to defer your Baptism, that you
may be one of the most glorious Kings on earth that France ever enjoyed, and
happy in Heaven to all Eternity.

Clovis replied, that her persuasions and arguments were unanswerable, and that
his soul was convinced of the truth of what she had affirmed, but Policy and
Religion being different things, he ought maturely to confider whether
forsaking the Gods of his own Country who were worshipped by such a multitude
of his Subjects might not occasion some rebellion or disturbance among his
people in defense of their Old Religion. Clotilda who found this one of the
main obstacles of his Conversion briskly answered, That his Nobility and People
were already sufficiently convinced of the falsity of their Idolatrous
superstition, and wanted nothing but his example and encouragement to declare
their belief of the truth of the Christian Faith, but that if it were
otherwise, yet he ought to encounter all difficulties, and venture all dangers
for the salvation of his Soul. These earnest solicitations of the Queen being
often renewed, the King at length began seriously to consider the
reasonableness of them, and soon after Clotilda being delivered of a Son, he
permitted him to receive Christian Baptism, but the Child dying soon after, he
told her, Shewas too vehement in her Religion, and that he feared the health of
the Child was impaired by its being so soon Baptized. The Queen answered that
life and death were in the hands of God, and this Infant was not so much to be
lamented having now changed this vain life into that of Angels, and that God if
he pleased could yet bless their Royal Bed with a numerous issue, and she was
sure Baptism was no prejudice to him since it was an Ordinance and Appointment
of Heaven, and therefore being delivered of a second Son she conferred Baptism
upon it as well as on the former, which likewise dying soon after, Clovis was
more offended than before, saying, He believed that that water was fatal to
Children, and she should take care never to move him for the like liberty
again; Clotilda with a resolved mind alleged, that if God should have made her
barren, he ought to have been contented, and adore the divine providence, and
not to reflect upon the Baptism of Christians but upon her sins as the cause of
the loss of her Children; The King was fully pacified with this prudent return,
and at length became resolved to profevs Christianity, which was hastened upon
this occasion.

The Swevi a People of Germany passing the Rhine under the command of several
Princes, with design to root out the Gauls or French, and ruin their new
erected Monarchy, Clovis with the assistance of some of his neighbors resolved
to oppose their numerous Forces, and a great Battle was fought near Collen
where the King commanding in chief, he was suddenly surrounded by his Enemies
and in great danger of his life, and though he performed the duty both of a
great Captain and a valiant Soldier, yet terror had so seized his flying Army
that his affairs were in a very desperate posture, when by the perfuasion of
one of his chief Favorites he made a solemn Vow to God, That if he returned
victorious he would perform his promise made to the Queen and be Baptized a
Christian, and then calling aloud upon the God whom Clotilda worshipped for
assistance and deliverance, his Forces rallied, and his Foes seemed to decline,
whom he so vigorously prosecuted that the Fields were all covered with dead
bodies, and this sudden discomfiture struck such terror into the other German
Princes that they speedily sent to desire Peace, and became Tributary to him.

The Queen was very joyful at this notable success, but much more at the devout
resolution of her husband, and therefore went several miles to meet him in his
return accompanied by a renowned Bishop called Remigius, a person famous for
piety in that age; Clovis no sooner approached the Queen but even ravished both
with her presence and his great Victory he told her; That he had indeed
triumphed over the Almains, but she had conquered him, and that he would now
defer his Baptism no longer; The Queen extremely pleased at the news told him,
that the glory of his Conquests was only due to the God of Battles, to whom he
could not make a more pleasing return than by giving up himself to his worship
and service, and that she had brought an Holy person with her to perform that
acceptable duty to the Almighty; Soon after he was accordingly Baptized with
great Solemnity at Rhemes, and it is said, that his Children, his Sisters, and
above three thousand Courtiers, Gentlemen, Commanders and Soldiers were made
partakers of the like blessing at the same time; After which Clovis publishing
a favorable Edict toward the Christians, almost all the French Nation were
converted, and with much Zeal threw down the Idols and Altars of their former
Superstition.

The Queen to prosecute this blessed work she had so happily begun, persuaded
Clovis to build diverse Christian Churches and endow them with considerable
revenues, after which he subdued Burgundy and united it to his Kingdom together
with Provence, Dauphine and Savoy, and then marches with his Victorious Army
into Langudoc against the Visegoths where he slew Alarick their king with his
own hand and obtained a remarkable Victory, seeming irresistible in all his
attempts and having extended his Empire from the Rhine to the Sein and from the
Pyrenean Mountains to the Ocean, he at length submited to the fate of all other
Mortals, and died leaving his dominions divided between his four Sons.

Clotilda was very sensibly afflicted for the loss of so indulgent an husband,
and so great a Conqueror, but time having in some measure abated her sorrows,
she resolved to wear out the remainder of her days in a devout and retired
life, but however was much disturbed in this her recluse condition by hearing
of the horrible confusions and disorders among her Sons, who not content with
their Fathers allotment, raised dreadful wars against each other, till at
length after the destruction of all the rest, Clotair the third Son alone
enjoyed the whole kingdom; Clotilda used her utmost endeavors to have appeased
their quarrels, and one time among the rest prevented a battle ready to begin
by her prudent advice, saying; My Dear Children I had great expectation that
after the death of my loving Lord I should have reaped much comfort from your
mutual agreement, and never expected that you could believe it a worthy matter
to unpeople the World, or that you ought to violate the law of nature and
brotherly love for enlarging your power, or to establish your Thrones by the
blood of each other; Return then my Children to the ways of peace which you
have forsaken and be united in an indissoluble affection, do justice to your
people, and live now as you expect to dye; I give you my last farewell, and pray
remember the words of your dying Mother and bury me in the Sepulcher of the
King your Father as I have ever desired; At which words they laid by all their
anger, and were at present made Friends; After this being sensible of her death
approaching she continued in sweet ecstasies of Soul, and praises to God for her
deliverance out of this troublesome World, and about midnight uttering with much
earnestness these words; To thee O Lord I commit my Soul; O God I have put my
trust in thee therefore let me never be ashamed, She gave up the ghost; Her
name and memory being in much reverence in France to this very day.

The History of Andegona Princess of Spain.
Andegona, Princess of Spain

SWeet Andegon the most endeared wife,
Of Ermangild, who loved her as his life
Though of Great Sufferings she did partake
Yet the true Faith by no means would forsake,
Neither could all the Wiles nor cruelty
Of a Stepmother shake her constancy.
Which over her husbands Soul such power did gain
He the same Faith with zeal did entertain
And with such courage does the same profess
His bloody Father could not dispossess
His mind thereof; But with unnatural rage
Puts him to death his fury to assuage.
OUr Ninth and last Feminine Worrhy I shall fetch from Spain, her name
Andegona, who in the year of our Lord 486. was married to Ermangild Son to
Lenigild King of Spain an Arrian, she was one of the most accomplished
Princesses in the World, in whom virtue, grace and beauty made an admirable
harmony; Her native Country was France being the daughter of Sigebert
grandchild of the pious Clotilda our former Heroine; At her arrival in Spain
her husband Ermangild was surprised with her graces and his Soul was
transported with a sweet violence toward a person of such extraordinary
endowments, so that never were Nuptials more full of content, nor amities more
faithful than between these two endeared Lovers, which yet in a short time met
with some Clouds of discontent and trouble.

Lenigild her Father in Law was about this time married to a second Wife an
Arrian, named Gosintha, as deformed in body as mind, who notwithstanding had
obtained such Sovereignty over the heart of this old King, that she had the
sole management of his affairs, and all was acted according to her will and
pleasure; However she pretended an extraordinary contentment at the
consummation of this marriage, and went in Person to wait upon and entertain
the Princess, seeming to overwhelm her with kindness and courtesy. Yet at
length out of an envious or malicious disposition, she seemed much disturbed at
the chaste dalliances between them, especially since she saw Ermangild wholly
transported with love to his excellent Lady, so that he could hardly endure her
out of his fight, whereby their discourses, conversation, and pleasures became
as troublesome to Gosintha as if she had been one of those Infernal Spirits that
possess and torment poor mortals.

Though Andegona had the greatest passion in the World for her Lord, yet she
durst not refuse the company of this troublesome Creature, whereby her husband
to his great regret was deprived of it, who told her, That she ought to be
satisfied with the power and interest she had in affairs of state, and not pry
into nor interrupt his converse with his dearest spouse, Gosintha repled, That
the frequent Conferences she had with his Princess were only in order to
convert her to the Arrian Faith (so called from Arrius Bishop of Alexandra the
author of a wicked and blasphemous Heresy against the Divinity of our blessed
Savior denying him to be equal with God the Father) and in prosecution of this
impious design she spared no pains nor endeavors, using both Flattery and
Threats, to induce her to comply thereto, insinuating; That God might as well
be worshipped in one Religion as another, and that she ought to conform her self
to the usages and customs of the place wherein she was, especially since
thereby she would very much oblige the King and create greater respect in him
toward her: That she was not come into Spain to give but receive Laws, and to
exercise obedience; That her husband could never faithfully love her if she
entertained any other Sentiments, Opinions or Sacraments than himself; 'That
she could never expect to reign happily over a People who were of a contrary
Faith to hers; That she should not fear the reproaches of her own Countrymen
who would count her very indiscreet not to comply with the times, and that if
for small matters some great men would be persuaded to renounce their former
Religious Observances, much more might she be excused in her conformity to the
Truth, when the reward thereof was no less than a Kingdom.

With such pungent motives and arguments as these this wicked woman did
continually afflict the ears of this innocent Princess, who nothing moved
therewith, replied; That if she persisted in these discourses she would for the
future take all occasions to avoid her company, since nothing could be less
grateful to her than using so many subtilties to remove her from her Faith from
which she was resolved never to recede during her life, yea though the utmost
torments were inflicted on her to force a renunciation. And therewith going
hastily out of her Chamber, Gosiniha was very much offended, yet concealing her
anger, resolved to attempt her once more not without hope of prevailing, and
having by a thousand protestations of kindness and affection endeavored to
make up the breach, she at length more earnestly pressed her with many urgent
reasons to be again baptized after the Arrian manner, which Andegona absolutely
refused prudently replying; That thanks be to God she was already baptized in
the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and that if the water of the
Arrian Baptism should be cast on her head, though she loved her hair as well as
any woman need, yet she would pluck it off, yea tear the Skin along with it
that had been defiled with such an abomination.

This was the last effort Gosintha made, and judging her self extremely
affronted at this resolute reply, she left Andegona, foaming with Rage and
Threats, That since she refused the Arrian Baptism, she should be baptized in
another manner, which should wash her from head to foot; And returning again
soon after, she barbarously dragged this poor Princess, about by the hair of
the head, and then abusing her to the loss of blood she commanded two or three
of her waiting women to strip her stark naked, and bind her with cords, and in
this posture to throw her into a pool of water in a very cold season of the
year; It was a miserable spectacle to see the daughter of a King who was so
lately received with such Triumphs and Rejoicings thus cruelly treated in the
same place; Gosintha who stood at the brink of the Pool to behold this unworthy
execution, ordered her to be drencht in the water by degrees that she might be
more sensible of the peircing cold, and often repeated these words, If you will
confess you are an Arrian, you are safe, and shall be presently released from
your misery; But the courageous Princess who had not so great an apprehension
of death as fear to be seen naked, cried out aloud, I am a Christian, an
Orthodox Christian, take away my life if you will, yet shall neither fire nor
water force me to gainsay or renounce my Profession; Gosintha finding all her
attempts in vain, at length suffered her to come out and put on her garments,
admiring and envying the constancy and greatness of her Soul, which no tortures
could shake or disturb.

Ermangild utterly ignorant of what had passed, perceiving his Princess
somewhat pale and disordered by this rough usage, asked whether she were
discomposed either in body or mind, which she prudently endeavored to conceal
as not worthy his notice, but by the manner of her discourse finding she had
received some sensible affront, he made a strict scrutiny of those who were
able to inform him, who soon related the cruel indignity his Mother-in-law
Gosintha had put upon her, which raised his passion to such an height, that he
had certainly torn that wicked Queen in pieces had not the fear of God and the
charming Eloquence of his wife somewhat pacified his fury; The Virtuous
Andegona fell at his feet, beseeching him not to precipitate himself and her
likewise into inevitable danger by any extremities, so that at length they
concluded to remove from the Court to Sevil, which was given him as a Patrimony
by his Father for his present subsistence; Whither being retired they fully
enjoyed those delights which had been in some measure obstructed by this ill
accident, Ermangild believing himself the happiest of all mortals in beholding
so many Virtues in so great a beauty; And the modesty and piety wherewith she
had managed her last disgrace made him think he could not sufficiently adore so
much goodness.

Andegona observing what power she had over her husband by the repeated
instances of his tender affection, and being now without fear of a Stepmother
resolved to improve this opportunity for the good of his Soul, and solicited
him seriously to renounce his Arrianism and embrace true Christianity, by
insisting on the falsness and unreasonableness of this opinion so derogatory to
the honor of the Son of God and Savior of the World, the author of it being a
wicked Priest who was made a Bishop out of mere spite, and was rejected and
solemnly condemned in a Council of three hundred and eighteen Bishops; And that
it had been remarkt, that all the Arrian Kings round about had come to unhappy
ends and it might be feared Spain could not escape the vengeance of Heaven
unless it were purged from these pestilent errors. Ermangild could not well
resist the strength of truth and love both assaulting him at once in the same
Person, and therefore took time to deliberate; Whereupon the good Princess
prevailed with him to confer with a famous Bishop who so well managed the
Spirit of this gallant Prince that by divine assistance and the continual
solicitations and prayers of Andegona who moved Heaven and Earth for his
conversion, he at length renounced his error, and became an Orthodox Christian.

Lenigild the Father having notice hereof was exceedingly displeased, and
Gosintha his Wife was not wanting to inflame him against his son, however not
willing presently to bring things to extremity knowing the greatness of his
Spirit, and that many of the Nobility were ready to engage in his cause; He
sent Letters to him full of fair promises and invitations to return to Court,
not without some sharp reflections upon the change of his Religion without his
consent, and that he had put himself into a posture of War and rebellion
against his own Father, which no pretense to Piety could possibly justify.
Ermangild seemed doubtful what answer to return, but his young Counselors too
warmly alleged; That there was now no place to retire, since he had to do with
a Prince who was both imperious and turbulent, and with a Mother in Law
altogether irreconcilable and revengeful, who would never be satisfied but in
his utter destruction, and that if he did not now take arms to secure his life
he would be chased like awild Beast, and hardly find security even in the
deserts; He therefore sent back to his Father; That his Religion had taught him
to bear patiently the sharpness of his words to whom he was bound by immortal
obligations, but that he could not think his life safe in a place where his
wife, for whose sake only he lived, had received such horrible abuses, and as
for his changing his Religion he ought to know; That a Father requires
imnatural obedience when he exacteth it of a Child against his conscience, and
therefore humbly desired that he would suffer him to repose peaceably at Sevil
least their arms might be as shameful to the Conqueror as miserable to the
vanquished.

Lenigild more exasperated now than before, especially by the constant
aggravations of the wicked Stepmother, resolved to reduce his son by force,
and acts of Hostility were begun, till at length Ermangild was besieged in
Sevil, where he had continued three years since his departure from Court; The
Religious Andegona apprehending the sad effects of these impending
distractions, besought her husband with the utmost tenderness and tears in her
eyes, to reconcile himself to his Father, who unable to resist such potent
pleaders seemed wholly changed at her motion and told her that since she
desired it, he was resolved to submit to his father, but advised her, That to
prevent falling again into the hands of the merciless Gosintha, he should
retreat to Constantinople for safety till she faw what entertainment he should
meet with. Andegona was extremely afflicted at this proposal, and wept bitterly
at the thoughts of being separated from the chief object of her love; But
however necessity compelling them Ermangild took his little Son that hung at
the breast and told her, See here Madam the most precious pledge of our
marriage which I recommend to your care, Let God dispose of it as he please,
but you must bring it up as a King; At which redoubling her sighs they parted
with violent convulsions of grief, Andegona at her last farewell adjuring him
that by no means he should lose his faith, which he assuring her to maintain to
the last moment, they were then separated never to meet again in this World.

The King understanding his Son was inclined to peace rejoiced thereat, and
dispatched his younger brother Ricardo to his Camp, who arriving there, and
seeing his brother Ermangild cried out; O my brother before I embrace thee I
desire to know whether I am come to a friend or an enemy; Ermangild embraced
him tenderly in sight of the whole Army assuring him of the great affection he
had ever born both to his Father and himself, and instantly both hasten to the
Court where the Prince prostrating himself at the feet of the King, he with all
kind of submission declared. That he was ready to live or dye at his feet; The
King either feignedly or in earnest told him that he found he had been much
misrepresented, but that this action had cleared all his suspicions, and that
he was very welcome, inquiring where his wife was; Who replied, she would
speedily be at Court; Gosintha then present seemed mightily pleased showing him
all manner of kindness, upon which Ermangild banishing all suspicion resolved
to send for Andegona to Court; But all her pretenses were only pernicious
flatteries, for much doubting if he should gain his Fathers heart, her faction
might be disturbed, she forged Letters and suborned witnesses to swear that all
this submission of his Son was only a trick and design to bereave him of the
Kingdom, which she seemed so clearly to demonstrate that the old doting King
was in a greater fury than before, and commanded him to be arrested for treason
and committed him close Prisoner laden with irons and clothed in Sackcloth,

The Prince by this violent procedure perceiving his hour was nigh, renounced
all the concernments of this World, and courageously prepared himself for
death, when the King coming to visit him, was so far transported with rage as
to call him, Ungrateful wicked wretch; To whom the Prince mildly answered, that
he could not possibly imagine what he was guilty of, and therefore must dye in
silence and without making any defense; His father told him his own evil
conscience sufficiently accused him if he would be so just as to acknowledge
his vile intentions, and of which he should be very glad to find him innocent;
Hereupon Ermangild made a large Apology wherein he fully cleared himself from
all things charged upon him; So that the King being convinced had nothing to
charge him with but the change of his Religion, which the Prince freely
acknowledged and vowed That he would dye a thousand deaths rather than reneunce
that True faith which he had now embraced. The father called him fool, and
remanded him back to Prison wherewith some difficulty he writ a letter to his
dear Andegona, wherein he returns her many thanks that from her he had received
the true knowledge of God, and was resolved to suffer the utmost extremity in
defense of the same, advising her after his death, to make her escape to
Constantinople.

Mean while Ricardo his younger brother was extremely troubled that by being a
mediator for peace he had been the occasion of this deplorable Tragedy, and
seeing Ermangild covered with sackcloth and loaded with chains he stood at
first mute like a statue, and then breaking forth into tears said, Ah brother
it is I that have betrayed you, it is I who have fettered you like an
ignominious slave, take therefore my dagger and revenge your wrongs upon my
guilty head for being accessory though against my will, to your destruction.
His brother endeavored by gentle words to appease his passion, and told him it
was no fault of his, and that he would most willingly lay down his life for his
Religion which was the only charge his enemies had against him; Riccardo went
to the King and by all manner of entreaties endeavored to mollify his bloody
mind, but the Faction of Gosintha much doubting the resentment of the brothers,
sounded nothing in his ears but the danger of so great an Offender, who showed
himself so insolent in his misery that nothing could be expected but his utmost
vengeance in his prosperity; The credulity of the unfortunate Father was so far
prevaild on by these discourses, that he sent an Executioner to his Son in
prison with this Message; That a Sword or a Crown were now presented to his
choice, that if he would renounce his Religion he should be received into
favor and enjoy the Scepter after him; But if not he should be instantly
beheaded in that place; Ermangild told him; That he would rather dye by a
thousands torments than forsake the true faith which he had embraced, and
added; I thank thee O Almighty God that as thou have given me a mortal,
perishing, uncertain life from my Father, so by his means I shall now receive a
glorious and happy life to all Eternity; And then kneeling down, and praying
earnestly for his Father, Stepmother and all his enemies and persecutors, he
cheerfully stretched out his neck to the Executioner, pronouncing the name of
his dear Andegona to the last moment, and at one blow had his head severed from
his body.

The sad tidings of this lamentable accident arrived to Andegona who had made
her escape into Africa, where she likewise received the last Letter from her
husband out of Prison; Her attendants at the news began to make doleful
Lamentations as if themselves had been condemned to dye; But Andegora kissing
the Letter of her dear Lord, and then reading it cried out, Ah noble and
faithful Soul, thou have acted as a good man ought to do, thou have fought the
good fight of Faith, and have now attained the Crown of glory, and I desire
nothing but to imitate thy constancy; Weep not then, my Servants for me, since
it is this day I am a Queen indeed and esteem my self the most happy Princess
on earth, who have a husband a Martyr in Heaven. And then taking her little Son
Ermangild almost tired with hard Travel she said, Go sweet babe partake of the
blessings of your dear Father, God has bestowed great favors in you to be
banished already for your Religion, go then little Innocent and rejoice with
others before the Altar of the Lamb, your Mother will not stay long behind you.
The Child dyed soon after, and the magnanimous Andegona having long combated
with these Armies of afflictions at length resigned up her Soul with these
words; O my God the father and son are at rest, there now remains nothing but
to take the mother, I have ended all my hopes in this World, why stayest thou O
my blessed Savior to receive my Soul which is now upon my lips. Her prayer was
heard, for a few days after wasted with love, travel and desires, she died an
exemplary death and found a Tomb in Africa.
