To the Right Honorable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in PARLIAMENT
Assembled.
The Great Grievances and Oppressions of James Child, late of the Parish of
Amersham in the County of Bucks, Occasioned by the Proceedings in the late
Times.
1. AMersham being a Borough Town, and sending Members to Parliament, some of
the Burgers that were designed to make an Interest there for a Parliament which
should please the late King James, added near Twenty Poor People to pay Scot
and Lot, which were not able, only to bring them in for Voices, and then
privately without notice made a Rate, pretending for Repairs of the Church,
although in truth there was no such thing, it being only done to lay the
Burden of those Additional Burgers upon others; whereupon the said James Child
and some others refused to pay that Illegal Rate, and the Churchwardens
thereupon Presented them in the Ecclesiastical Court, and they were put to near
Three Hundred Pound Charges before they could obtain a Prohibition, which at
last was granted upon the Motion of the Honorable Sir Henry Pollixfen, Knight.

2. King Henry the Fourth in the Ninth Year of his Reign grants a Charter of
several Liberties and Privileges to the said Parish of Amersham, and several
other places in the County of Bucks, which Charter was Exemplified in the
Seventeenth Year of King Charles the Second, at the Request of the said James
Child, and others; and the Exemplification, by consent of the Persons
concerned, put into the Hands of the said James Child in Trust for all Parties.

The late Lord Chancellor Jefferyes Combining with some Persons who Invaded
the Privileges granted by the said Charter, did in May 1684 contrive a
Complaint to be made against the Charter aforesaid, and upon that Complaint
Ordered the said James Child to deliver up the Exemplification, which he being
a Trustee was unwilling to do, whereupon the late Lord Chancellor sent for the
said James Child by a Messenger, and had him taken into Custody, where he
remained several Days until he was compelled to deliver the Exemplification
up, and then the late Lord Chancellor Ordered the Exemplification to be
Vacated, and the Charter to be taken off the Roll by the Name of a Schedule,
upon pretense of a Forgery, although there was not the least color or reason
of such Proceedings; by reason whereof all Persons concerned have lost their
Rights and Privileges, if not Redressed by the present Parliament.

By the hard Usages aforesaid, the said James Child was put to exceeding
Charges, which with the loss of his Time, and the Noise of his being a
Prisoner, and that the late Lord Chancellor had Threatened his Ruin, made his
Creditors call in their Moneys, whereby he was forced to Abscond, and to Sell
an Estate worth above 2000 l for 1800 l and has at this time a Wife and Eight
Children and nothing to depend upon but the Charity of Friends.
