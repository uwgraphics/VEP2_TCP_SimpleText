THE CASE OF Sir EDWARD WYNDHAM, Baronet, AND WILLIAM HELYAR Junior, Esquire Who
are Elected, and Returned.
THE said Borough is an ancient Borough, that has many Ages sent Members to
Parliament, and the Elections have time out of Mind been made by the Bailiff,
and the Capital Burgesses, and Commonalty of the said Borough; and time out of
Mind some of the Capital Burgesses have lived out of the Town, and yet have
served as Bailiffs, given their Votes, and signed the Returns.

At the last Election, a fair Pole was taken; and there voted for Sir Edward
Wyndham, and Mr. Helyar Fifty eight; for Mr. Strode Fifty two; for Mr. Speak
Fifty; which the Bailiff allowed to be good Votes.

There were tendered twelve more by Sir Edward Wyndham, and Mr. Helyar, and
eight more by Mr. Strode and Mr. Speak; all which the Bailiff refused, as not
good.

That amongst the twelve that offered to vote for Sir Edward Wyndham, and Mr.
Helyar, were three Housekeepers, and one Mr. Raymond, that pays more Scot and
Lot than all those that voted for Mr. Speak, and Mr. Strode: And of the Eight
tendered by them, not one good, as will be fully proved, if there be time to
examine it.

That after the Pole cast up, and before the Return made, which was done in the
public Town Hall, three Proclamations were made, that if any one could object
against the Pole taken, or the returning of Sir Edward Wyndham, and Mr. Helyar,
he should come forth, and should be heard; but no one making the least
Objection, the Bailiff returned Sir Edward Wyndham, and Mr. Helyar.
