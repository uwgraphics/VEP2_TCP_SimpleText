A MESSAGE TO THE PRESENT RULERS OF England.

A MESSAGE TO THE PRESENT RULERS OF England.

Whether COMMITTEE of SAFETY; (so called) Council of Officers, or Others
whatsoever.

Delivered unto them by an Ambassador from the only Right Heir of the
Government, whose Right alone it is to Rule, And by special Authority and
Commission from him, this is sent unto them, that they may hear, and fear, and
learn Wisdom, and may deliver up the proper Right of the only King unto him,
that they may be blessed; but on the contrary depends their destruction.

West End of Paul's. 1659.

THese things were upon me, to deliver even by speech and word of mouth to the
present men in power, that they might be warned lest they perish; But no way
being made for me so to do, I have written what was upon me, even as short as
possibly I could, and in as little Compass as might be, having hinted at
things which might more largely bin spoken to; and I order this to be printed
and given to their particular hands, with speed.

E. B.

To the present Rulers of England, A MESSAGE to you all, by an Ambassador from
the Lord God, The Great and Mighty King; And Jesus Christ, the only Prince of
Peace and Righteousness, whose Right alone, it is to Rule, over us in our
Nation, and not Another, In his Name and Authority, I am come unto you.
FRiends, My Master is a High and Mighty, and powerful Prince, and very
Honorable; And fear, reverence, respect and subjection belongs to him alone,
from you and all mankind, he is wise and understanding, and of great strength:
And his dominion is from everlasting to everlasting; And he can do whatsoever
he will in Heaven and Earth; for he rules with his Iron Rod over the World, and
whatsoever he says, it is done; for his Word is an everlasting Command; If he
say to a man Live, it is so; and if he say to him Die, It comes to pass; and
if he give peace to a man or a Nation, none can make War; and if he make War
with a person, or in a Nation, no man is able to make Peace. For why, he has
all power in his hand, and to him all Judgment and Authority is given, he is
the Son of the living God, the everlasting Creator; he was, and is, and is to
come; his eye beholds all things, and his Arm compasses Heaven and Earth;
and what his purpose is, he has always, and will ever bring it to pass; if
he set up Rulers, they must rule; and if he pull them down, none can hinder;
whom he will he honors, and if it be his pleasure, he brings men to shame;
if he break a Nation down, none can build it up; and if he confound Powers and
Authorities in the Kingdoms of men, they all fall as withered grass before
him; Behold ye men! he is so great and mighty, and of so great Authority, that
whatsoever he says, it is done, and whatsoever he wills, it comes to pass;
and none is able to resist him and overcome his power; when his pleasure is to
accomplish a work; By him all things are that be, and all things live that has
life, and through him all things moves, and of his fullness every creature in
Heaven and Earth receives; and this my Master is altogether honorable in
birth and otherwise; and altogether mighty in all his works; he is just and
merciful, full of goodness, righteousness and truth, and all virtue dwells in
him: and his Judgment and Mercy, his Authority and Meekness: and his wrath and
his Love, they are Companions; And what are ye before him? or how shall ye be
able to resist him? or to turn backward what his purpose is concerning you and
this Nation? for ye have no being nor breath without him. Behold ye men; ye are
verily as the dust before the wind, so are ye to him soon blown away, and your
place not found, as the Grass before the Mower, so are ye before him, soon cut
down and withered, and your beauty utterly extinguished, as a Potters vessel
under an iron Rod, even so are you to him, he can immediately break you, never
to be bound up, as a drop to the Fountain, so are you to him, soon dried up,
and made nothing; wherefore ye men, ye mortal creatures, ye ignorant persons,
sons of a transgressor, ye dust and ashes; for thus you are in comparison of
him this mighty Prince; Hearken to his Message which comes to you from him:
Hear and fear, and be not stout-hearted against the Lord God that is about to
speak unto you.

As for this little Island of England, wherein your present place and being is;
it is an Island which the Lord has showed great favor unto, in ages past, and
in this present time: and I must tell you he has a purpose of love toward it,
and to honor it in the view of the world, though through great tribulations,
and he has an intent of great good unto it: For he has a seed, a precious
seed in it, scattered abroad, and he has a people that fears his Name, and
has walked in his ways, and he has made them, and elected them, and what
they are, it is by him: that he may dwell among them, and have the whole
Government over them all, yea, he has a speedy purpose verity concerning this
Nation, and he will purify it in Judgment, and refine its inhabitants through
the fire of tribulations, that it may be pleasant to him, and fit to do his
Will: he has a purpose to work some great thing in it I must tell you, as he
has said unto me, so to do; he will have his Name exalted and reverenced in
this Island, and his terror shall be sent out of it through the world, and his
branch from it shall spread over the earth, he does purpose in his season to
take it into his own hand, and to sway the Government thereof with his own
Scepter, and to set up Righteousness alone, and to overthrow all oppressions
and oppressors, and the Kingdoms of this world must become the Kingdoms of the
Lord, and of his Christis.

True it is, such has bin the coming to pass of time, and of things for many
Ages bypast, that my Master has bin as it were banished from the Nation, and
has not bin suffered to enjoy his Right, but has bin expelled, even as it
were by the force of Satan, and Antichrist, who has long usurped Authority
over the inhabitants of this Nation; and in my Masters absence, lamentable
injustice, cruelty, unmercifulness, tyranny and oppression, has bin exercised
upon the inhabitants, and the poor creatures has bin held in great slavery by
their Rulers, that have ruled by the Dragons power, and bin kept in great
blindness and ignorance, and under great oppression both in body and spirit,
by Antichristian Teachers, for this many years, even while the great King has
bin absent, and as it were gone into a far Country: even all this time has
Antichrist and the devil ruled and reigned, and has made and executed
oppressing and tyrannical Laws and Decrees, both in Church and State, and all
the Nation has bin out of right order, and laid waste and barren of good
fruit, and it has bin as a wilderness, by reason hereof; and men that have
ruled for many years, have not ruled singly by my Masters Authority, but by
another power, though not without the knowledge of my Lord, neither as though
he had not power to have done otherwise; but for his own pleasure he has
suffered it thus to be, and let men go on to rule and govern in their own
wills, and after their own lusts; and people have walked wickedly toward him,
and toward one another, and all this he has suffered, not as if he gave
toleration for it: for his messengers now and then, and his witness in peoples
consciences, have bin reproving their ungodly ways, and he has often showed
his dislike by diverse ways and tokens, and many judgments and strange
overturning: to the way and proceeding of both Rulers, Prophets and Teachere of
this Nation: But yet they have gone on, against his mind, and contrary to his
Will, notwithstanding his Reproofs and Judgments, not that he had not power to
have executed his pleasure in wrath upon them, and to have destroyed them al
together, and have made the Nation a heap, and as nothing, long before this
day: for power was in his hand to have done it: But he has bin long-suffering,
and of great patience, and born all things, and taken the injustice, and
cruelty, and wickedness, and idolatry, and all unrighteousness that has
abounded in the Nation upon himself, and suffered under it, and born it for its
season, while woeful and lamentable oppressions has bin practiced in Civil
State, even hellish Laws, and devilish Executors of them, merciless Tyrants
have born the Scepter, and reigned for many years over the inhabitants, and in
Church and State, has bin heinous Idolatry, and Superstitious vanities
committed in a high nature, and measure, and even all men, and States of men,
and orders of men, of every degree, has bin abominably corrupted, in the fight
of my Lord; even from the Prince to the Beggar, even Rulers and Subjects,
Teachers and People, Judges and Prophets, they have bin corrupted both in heart
and hand, and they have dealt falsely, and wickedly toward him, and toward one
another, even to the great displeasure and vexation of him, and his blessed
Spirit, and to the high provocation of him, to their own destruction, if his
long suffering had not prevailed, and all this, while he has laid, as it were
asleep, and at rest in himself, and he has left men to try them, what they
will do, and he has given them a day, many Kings and Rulers, he has let them
have a little time, to see how they would use it, but they have abused it, and
not Ruled for him, nor accomplished his work, nor fulfilled his will, but acted
even in defiance of him, and of his Power, and to his great dishonor, Alack! I
must be plain with you, my Lord has bin utterly exiled, and greatly
dishonored, and highly provoked and vexed, by reason of such proceedings, as
has bin in this Nation for this many years, through the corruption of all
sorts of men in place, and power, who has not ruled for him, but for the
Devil, to their own corrupted ears, only he has suffered men to go on in
their course for a season, some as it were appearing on the Stage for a time,
and suddenly cast down again, for their iniquities sake, and his hand has bin
in all these things, though very privately and secretly, not known and discerned
by the Sons of men, yet has he Ruled over the Kingdoms of men, and pulled down
one and set up another, and to forbear the several actings and proceedings of
many by-passed ages, and to come to this generation, and to speak of things
that have happened within these few years, and of the changing and overturning
that has happened in this Nation; such was the cruelty, tyranny, and oppression,
and Idolatry, both in Church and Civil State, that the People of this Nation
were held under, in the days of Papal-Power, such I say, was the exceeding
height of Cruelty, and tyranny of that time, that not any that feared or
reverenced my Lord, in any measure could scarce live, or have a being in the
Nation, even against every man, that did but incline toward him, and desire
the knowledge of his ways, Hells mouth was opened against them, and they were
swallowed up, and many of their lives taken from the Earth, by the hellish
power that had in that day usurped Authority in this Island, and when thus it
was, then he looked down from Heaven, and his bowels of compassion were
opened, for the sake of the oppressed People that desired after him, in so much
that he broke, and threw down the power of their oppressors in some measure, as
it stood in Papall-Authority, and when the iniquity of that power was filled
up, he took vengeance upon it* and I must tell you, it was he that brought it
about, even the destroying of that Power in this Nation, and freeing the Nation
from it, though the men that were instruments in the cause were not his
Servants, otherwise then as Nebuchadnezzar served him, for he has a secret way
to have a service from the wicked, and such is his Power, that he can turn the
wickedness of the wicked to his glory, and he can make a Rod to whipp his
Adversaries, and burn it when he has done, and he has often destroyed one
wickedness by another. Well, but to leave that, though he did in some measure
free this Nation from much tyranny and cruelty, in the casting out Popish
Authority, yet alack the Nation in a few years was near as much violated by
Injustice, tyranny, and cruelty, under the prelatical power, as ever it was
once under the Papal power, though before there had bin some small reformation,
and change in outward appearance, though little in ground and nature, yet
oppression, and tyranny in Civil State, and Idolatry, and Superstition in
Church and State, and all profaness and wickedness among people, was grown so
high, like as it had bin under the Papal power before, and all that desired
after the Lord, and was weary of iniquity, and of the then present oppressions
and Idolatries, were persecuted, and slain, and destroyed, and Injustice and
cruelty excercised upon them, even almost to the rooting out of
righteousness, and to the grieving of the Lords Spirit* well then, because of
the cry of the People, and the oppression of the Nation under that Authority,
my Lord looked down again, and even for his Name sake, and his seeds sake, he
had compassion on this Nation, to set it free, and to break off its
oppressions, and by his hidden hand and secret power, he overthrew that
oppressing power of Kings, Lords, and Bishops, both in Church, and Civil
State, and brought some Tyrants and Oppressors to just execution, for their
wickedness and in a great measure, he did deliver the people of this Nation in
many things, and there was a part of reformation wrought, and much pretended
and looked for, and all this came to pass through him, and my Lord did
accomplish it, however the instruments by which he wrought proved deceitful,
and became oppressors, as others before them, and though there was in this
Nation a day of great troubles, and wars, and contention, and great strife,
and the wasting of much blood, and earthly treasure, and none of these things I
must tell you, fell without the ordering of my Masters hand, yet so it was, and
came to pass, that after this Nation was restored to peace; though much
unrighteousness, and Injustice was removed, yet there was much also left
behind, and men that he had used as instruments in his hand in a good work,
and to whom he had given wisdom, and understanding, and appeared in much mercy,
and in great deliverance, yet they even turned to seek themselves, and became
corrupted in the spoils of their Enemies, and when peace, and plenty abounded,
the Lord was forgotten again, and then the Land fell under oppressors, and
began again to cry out for freedom, even when other horns of the first Beast
sprang up, and went one each of them after his fellow, and though one horn
has striven to break another, yet after one has bin cast down, another has
risen, and made an Image to the first, and ruled and reigned by the same Spirit
and Authority derived from the Dragons power, in cruelty and oppression, and
made Laws and executed them, to the dishonor of the Lord, and to the great
oppression of his people, and to the filling of this Island with Injustice and
cruelty, even from one generation to another, until this day, and thus up and
down, has times and seasons bin altered, power and Authority changed, and
altered, Statuts, Laws, and Decrees, changeable, and alterable, for as the
iniquity of one power was filled up, that was cast down, and another had its
day, till the measure of the first was also finished, that he might partake of
the same judgments, and in all these over-turnings, breakings down, and
over-throwings, the very hand of my Lord has bin, though secretly, and not
discerned, yet his power has brought about, and suffered all these things to
come to pass, and who shall charge him with Injustice? or who shall say what
have thou don? or why have thou don it? for as I have said, he is a high and
mighty Prince, and can do whatsoever he will; and he is the Supreme Power and
Authority which Rules and Reigns in, and over all the Kingdoms of men; and
what though he has used wicked men, as an instrument to accomplish his work,
and made the wicked his Rod, and even brought it to pass, that one wickedness
should destroy another, and one oppressor break down another, and the Kingdom
of Antichrist confound its self, yet what of all these things? all flesh must
be silent before him, and all people, and the whole Earth must be subject unto
him, for the Government and Dominion over Heaven and Earth are his, and all
Power and Dominion belongs to him alone, and all Judgment is in his hand, to
bring to pass whatsoever he will, and by whomsoever, as he pleases.

But now my Friends, though I would not be tedious to you, yet must I tell you
the truth, and faithfully deliver the Lords Message unto you: and as concerning
this last overturning, there was something of the hand of my Lord in it; and
he can, and will bring forth his own work and praise by it, and it shall be
for the good of all his people that waits upon him, though there was much
ambition and corrupted ends in the Instruments, and neither part were perfectly
single to the Lord in their proceedings; but their work was tasted with the
false Idolatrous spirit of self-seeking: Yet notwithstanding the Lord may bring
forth his Government, and his pleasant Plant, through and beyond all this, even
out of another Root, which yet appears not among either of them, and
Righteousness may arise in the Nation contrary to both of them, out of another
stem, and he will set up his Kingdom, and in the mean time leave one Potsheard
of the Earth to break another. And as for you that now sits on the Throne and
bears Rule, Is meant here chiefly the new Committee of Safety * (so called.)
whether Committee of Safety (so called) chiefly, though it is not without my
Master, for he has the knowledge of it, at least, yet you are not the only
men of his Choice, truly called of him to the place of Government, neither is
your Government the Government of the Lamb, neither must it be for ever
established by him; its foundation is not blessed, nor can its building be
prosperous: For why? alas, it is but another Horn of that fourth Beast, that
has been made to Rule over the world, and upon the earth for many Generations,
and it is but hitherto a very little refined from the last, and is of the last,
even as the eight was of the seventh, spoken of by that servant Rev. 17.11. and
it may also make war with the Lamb and his followers for a little season, and
it may have a small measure of injustice, and persecution to bring forth in the
Land, even till the words of God be fulfilled, and his Kingdom be fully come;
the way of which is but yet a preparing by all these overturnings: and this
your present Government Originally is leavened with the spirit of the old
Dragon, that has killed the Saints, and drunk their blood, and how should the
Lord establish it? Nay, your Kingdom may prove but small and little, and full
of uproars, and troubles, and little peace, and satisfaction, and establishment
in it to your selves, nor the people under you; but confusion will attend it,
and fear will compass it about: Though this I must tell you, as you are men,
you have your day of Trial, what you will do, as many others have had before
you, and something you may and ought to do, if but to make the Whore (the false
Church) more naked, and to scourge her, more than some others have done; and
indeed my Lord requires something more of you (as such) to do, then others
before you could do, and you have a price put into your hands which you may
improve to the Lords honor, and to the Nations good, and to our own happiness;
which if you be faithful to the Lord to do what he requires of you, and if you
become meek and humble men and fear his name, and deny your selves, and not
seek your own honors, nor any earthly advantage to your selves; if you do
thus, then My Lord will show Mercy to you, and you shall not suddenly fall
before your enemies, though many may rise up against you; but your days shall
be lengthened, and the purpose of the Lord may be turned to your longer
continuance, and not to your sudden destruction, and if you walk in this way,
and Rule, only for the Lord, then shall you be honored as men, if not as an
Authority, and you and the Nation preserved in peace, and the force of the
wicked shall be turned backward, and you shall not suddenly fall. And the late
sundry overturnings in this Nation may be examples to you, that you follow not
the stepps of those that God has cast out, lest you come to the same end of
confusion and misery: For as concerning that Assembly of men that last sat
on the Throne, something was done by them, in their day and time, and in both
their assemblings in some things they served my Lord, and they were a Rod in
his hand to smite his Enemies, yet they were not faithful to the end, till all
his Enemies were destroyed; but rather joined themselves to fight against the
Lord and his people, and were hastening on toward the way of Oppression, and
persecution; and it was time for the Lord to remove them, and to lay them
aside, as an empty vessel, sometimes useful; and to break them as a Rod,
sometime of service to be a scourge upon his Enemies; and when the day of their
trial was over, which God gave unto them, being any longer (for present) unfit
Instruments for his hand, then he cast him into the fire; and this his purpose
came to pass upon them, so that they and the whole Nation may be contented and
yield themselves subject, to what he has done concerning them; for they being
entering into the very same spirit of wickedness, of oppression, and
persecution, which the Lord had once reproved through them, and cast out by
them; then was a Rod raised up against them; even as they had been against
others, and they were dealt withal as they had done to others; and this was in
the justice of my Lords hand, and what has Mortal man to question his
proceedings? and though some of you (present Rulers) be looked upon as great
Traitors and Tyrants in your dealing toward them; and doubtless the men of
that part will seek vengeance against you, even by preaching and praying, and
they will curse you in the name of their God, and seek continually your
destruction, as such as have taken away part of their strength, and cast down
their Idol: But alas! all this is nothing, for the Lord does not account as
men: For these things must needs thus come to pass for the furtherance of the
Kingdom and Government of Jesus Christ, that it may arise through all; and if
you were but faithful to what the Lord requires of you in your present
proceedings; what you have done unto them should not be reckoned on account
against you, neither by God nor good men: But, and if, you of the Army, be
always treacherous and disobedient toward him, and abuse your power, and
disregard your price that God has given you, and trifle away your hour about
places of Honor, and such self-seeking matters, and the Cause of God be
neglected by you, and his people continued oppressed sufferers under you, as
they have long been, even then shall you be cast aside with shameful disgrace,
and the heavy hand of the Lord shall be upon you in judgment, and you shall be
smitten more then any before you; your Estates shall not be spared from the
spoiler, nor your souls from the Pit, nor your persons from the violence of
men, no nor, your necks from the axe; for if you be unfaithful, and
continually treacherous to the Cause of God, then shall you be left to the will
of your Enemies, and they shall charge treachery and treason upon you, and
your persons and estates shall be given for a prey to your Enemies, and you
shall not deliver your selves, neither will the Lord deliver you from the
execution of merciless men; for my Lord shall leave the cruel-hearted to plead
with you.

Wherefore that you may be warned, I advise you be faithful, let not the cause
of God fall, nor the cause of his Enemies prosper before you, for there is no
other way, whereby you can be preserved, nor no other defense shall you ever
find from the wrath of the Lord, and from the fury of your devouring Enemies,
then your faithfulness in Gods cause, and therefore relieve the oppressed, and
take off all oppression, break down all unjust Laws, and set all people free,
from unjust burdens, and let all oppression cease, both in Church and Civil
State, and even all oppressive Laws, and unjust Judges, and evil men in power,
let all this be removed, and the Nation clean quitted and discharged even from
all men, and Laws whatsoever, that have held under oppression the Persons,
Estates, and Consciences of the good people of this Land, and let the Nation be
corrected, and all orders and places of men, and Laws and decrees purified,
for this my Lord, the great King requires; and he will suddenly have it
brought to pass in the Nation, if not by you, then contrary to you, and to
your utter destruction, and this is the very substance of my Message to you,
that my Master has given me to say unto you, and on his behalf I am come to
claim of you my Masters long lost right, let him have his right, from which he
has long bin banished, I demand it of you, all ye, whatsoever, that seems to
bear rule in this Nation, I charge you in his name, let him have his title and
prerogative, let him be Lord and King wholly in his own Kingdom, let him have
the exercise of his peoples consciences by his own Spirit, in all things,
related to his worship and service, and let him have the full Authority by his
Spirit, in all things pertaining to Church, and Ministry, and Faith, and
Religion, and let his Spirit have the alone Authority, to persuade and diswade
people from, or to such or such Ministry, Worship, and practices of Religion,
and let all forced Maintenance to Ministers, and Tithes be speedily taken away,
and let all Laws, and decrees whatsoever, made, and practiced in the days of
Antichrist upon the Bodies, Estates, and consciences of the People, in
oppression and unjustnesse about Church, and Worship, and Religion, be utterly
repealed, and made void, and never more be in force in this Nation; But let my
Lord be sole Ruler and Governor, and have the full Authority in his own
Kingdom, in all things whatsoever pertaining thereunto, and let no man
henceforth hereafter, ever be entrusted with the liberties of the Members of
Christ's Kingdom, as they are such, nor to judge over them, in any matters of
Faith, and Worship, but give that right and privilege wholly unto the Spirit of
Jesus Christ, for unto him only it pertains, to be whole Judge, and to have
full power in his own Kingdom, and until you give him this right, and deliver
up unto him his own Kingdom, and the exercise of Peoples consciences in all
things about Religion, you shall never prosper, nor none that comes after you,
that shall in any measure abridge my Master of his proper right, from which he
has long bin banished as I have said, and till his right be given him, in the
case aforesaid, he will dash one man against another, and none shall never be
Established, but horn after horn shall be broken, and one power after another
brought into confusion

And therefore ye men, do not strive with him in this matter, but yield unto
him, the exercise of your own consciences by his Spirit in you, and let him do
so unto all others, even as ye hope to prosper, and upon the penalty of his
sore displeasure upon you in this World, and in the World to come; and let just
men and righteous men, and meek men, and men that have the fear and wisdom of
God in them, without exceptation of Birth or otherwise, let such men have the
Power and judgment committed to them, to determine in things between man and
man; down with all the false hearted flatterers that have ruled for man, and
not for God, and for themselves, and not for the good of the people, cast all
such out from among you, for the good among you is choked by them, down with
all that judge for rewards, and away with all hireling rulers, that executes
the Law for money, and will not plead the cause of the poor without great fees;
and down with all that will not serve places of Trust without so large
stipends, away with all these things out of the Land, for they are heinous
oppressions unto men, and great abominations in the sight of God, and the Land
has long groaned under the weight of these things, and the Earth is weary of
them, and my Lord requires their utter dissolution, as being iniquities fully
ripe, and having the guilt of so much cruelty, Injustice and oppression, lying
upon the Nation because hereof, therefore is the Lords season to destroy them,
and remove them out of the Land, which if you be the instruments in such a
work, it will be your greatest Crown, and your perpetual honor, for the Lords
purpose is one way or other to cleanse the Land of all these and other
oppressions whatsoever, that the people of this Land may be a free people from
all the heavy yoakes of Antichrist, which has long sorely pressed them down,
and the purpose of the Lord is to break the yoakes of oppression and tyranny,
from off the necks of this People, and therefore is it that he overturneth, yea,
and will overturne all men and Authorities that shall oppose his work, and none
shall be able to stand before him, for the presence of my Lord is more
dreadful to a Nation when he shows himself in his wrath, then any multitude of
Armed men, and woe is unto you if you be found opposeing of him, and if you
seek to stopp his work, you shall not cumber the Earth very long, nor oppress
the Nation many days, wherefore consider, cursed will you be if you be
unfaithful in what you have to do on the Lords behalf, for your hour passes
over that is allotted you, and will be suddenly expired, never to be recalled,
and then you cannot work.

And whereas there is a great Cry about Ministry, for sending forth, and
maintaining, and encouraging a godly Ministry, as you say; now to this, I do
answer on my Lords behalf* and I must tell you plainly, as for a true godly
Ministry truly called and sent of God, such a Ministry and such Ministers you
can never be able to hinder, but the Lord will send them out, maintaining them,
and preserve them, whether you will or no, and while you are troubling your
selves about such a matter, you are but meddling with things above your line,
and out of your Jurisdiction, while you act in such a Case, for it belongs to
his Government to send out Ministers whom and as he will, and to maintain them
and defend them according to his own pleasure, and all this without you, for
such Ministers truly called thereunto, and sent of the Lord, will not seek to
you to be sent forth or maintained by you, they will not be beholding to you in
such a Case, but even without you and contrary to you, must they be sent out
and maintained, so that the Lord will have a Ministry in this Nation purely of
his own, and not of man, nor by man, and such a Ministry you shall not be able
to hinder.

And I must tell you plainly, as for these men called Ministers in this Nation,
the way of their setting up, and sending forth, and the way of their
Maintenance, and the way of their standing and defense, and in every
particular of their being such; they are the greatest and most woeful
oppression in the Nation, even the most abominable and unjust cruelties and
tyrannies is acted through them, as any other thing in the Nation, and they are
(as such aforesaid) the woeful cause of the Nations groaning under merciless
dealing; and there is upon their account the guilt of blood, injustice, and
oppression lying upon this Nation; their iniquities, their iniquities cries for
vengeance upon their own heads, for they are full, they are full, and the
measure thereof is near finished, and Gods eternal vengeance is their next
reward, from the eternal God; what shall I say of them but this, The Earth is
oppressed by them, the Inhabitants groans under them, and the righteous God is
vexed through them, and they are the very men of high indignation and fierce
wrath, and all their practices (as such) are the fuel of his Anger, to be
consumed by the fire of his jealousy; the Nation is weary and its
Inhabitants; and the Lord is weary because of these men, and is this the
Ministry cried up by you as godly and pious, etc? are these the men that the
Nation must be forced to maintain in their pride and idolatry? is this the
Ministry that must be encouraged? Well, if these be the men, and this the
Ministry which must be established and encouraged by you, in so doing you
shall never prosper, but thereby gain the displeasure of the Almighty unto you,
to bring a curse upon all your doings even because hereof; for I must tell you,
the hand of my Lord is against them, and whosoever shall seek to defend them,
shall not prosper in their doings, because their oppressions, cruelties,
deceits, and abominations are nigh finished and fulfilled; wherefore take heed
unto your selves, for this is my Masters advice unto you; let this Ministry
alone, and join not your selves to Baal, lest you perish; neither take part
with Antichrist any longer, neither be ye fighters against the Lamb and his
Kingdom, but free the Nation, and let all its Inhabitants be freed from the
cruel tasks and yoaks of such men and such a Ministry as aforasaid; uphold it
not against the Lord, for if you do, you shall never be established: and this
is from the mouth of my Lord unto you.

And last of all, my Master has a People in this Nation, even a suffering
people, that have born the burden of the cruelty and injustice and wickedness
both of Rulers and Teachers, who has as it were trodden them down, and made
them a very prey to their devouring mouths; the very cry of their sufferings
has reached unto heaven, and the very sound thereof your ears have heard; and
this People are greatly beloved, and my Lord will assuredly honor them, and
his hand shall be continued to preserve them, and defend them against all their
Enemies whatsoever; and he does reserve them to himself, and for a glorious
work that he has to do by them, and he has formed them for himself, and
they cannot join with any of the horns of the great beast, neither can a
place of honor pervert them from their perfect way, but my Lord he compasses
them about on every side, and has kept them in the midst of trials,
reproaches, and sufferings* and covered them in the heath, and in the storm,
and his pleasure is to make further use of them, they are his, and not their
own, and they must fulfill his will, and none besides, and they lie at rest in
him, while Mountains are overturned, and while one Potsherd of the Earth
breaks another, and this must be even till the appointed time, and to say no
more of them though much might be said, they are had in remembrance before the
Lord, to do with them even for his own glory, and for this Nations perpetual
good, and to the Authority of the most high through them, shall Kings of the
Earth, and Nations of the World bow and tremble, wherefore ye men touch them
not, neither do ye afflict them even as you hope to prosper, remember their
cause, and suffer it not always to be rejected as it has long bin, but keep
your selves free from the injustice and cruelty of them that have gone before
you, who have bin merciless and oppressors of that people, even till my Lord
has confounded them, and brought them into confusion, for there is the weight
of blood, of tyranny and oppression lying upon the Nation in that peoples
cause, and my Lord will revenge them in his season, and though they are not
weary of their sufferings, but are in the patience, which bears all things,
yet the Nation can never be happy, nor its Govrnment ever blessed while this
people are held in bondage, and their sufferings are deeply considered of the
Lord, and the season thereof is expireing toward an end, and when this comes
to pass, then woe unto the Kingdom of Antichrist, and to the Whore, and false
Prophet, even when their strength is dried up, by which they have made War
against the Lamb, and his followers, yea, woe unto them, great fearfulness
shall be upon all the World, when the King of that people Reigns upon the
Earth, and the time is at hand, blessed is the man that waits for it, and
blessed is he that is not offended in his coming, but is prepared to receive
him in his appearing, which suddenly comes upon all the World.

And thus I have told you the Lords present Message unto you, which I received
from him, and thus far I am clear, and whether you accept it or reject it, my
peace and reward is for ever with him, who am a Subject of his Kingdom, and a
Friend to this Nation, however otherwise judged by ignorant men.

The 9. Mo. 1659.
THE END*
