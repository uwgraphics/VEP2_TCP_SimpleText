A Brief Relation OF A Wonderful Accident, A DISSOLUTION OF THE EARTH, IN THE
Forest of CHARNWOOD, About Two Miles from LOUGHBOROUGH in Leicestershire;
Lately Done, and Discovered, and Resorted to by many People, both OLD, and
YOUNG.

To the READER.
TO your ingenious Acceptance, we communicate these our Observations; not for
fil^hy Lucres s^^^, but for public Sa^^sf^ction, and Truth s^ke, (being
provoked thereto by some Persons of Quality:) considering he evil custom of
erroneous Reports, and the fearful Rumors of ignorant People.

Read and judge charitably, without critical, or incredulous Censure; here is
no wand^^ing Prol^^^^y, nor superfluous embellishm^nt of El^q^^nce, but a
S^^^^y into the proper Antithesis, appar^ll'd with necessary Language. Be
candid, not canine.

THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS Wonderful BREACH.
THE Figure is almost circular, posited in a declining condition to the
Horizon, it being the end or fragment of a hilly body, and contains about two
Acres of ground. In its upper Divison, or primary Breach, the lower, or (...)
p^^^ of it, lies a Yard (in some places) beneath the u^moved body: ab^^^ three
parts of this c^^^^ar wonder^ shows s^mpton^s of the efficient cause; and the
rest shows little, or no defect.

About three paces from the upper Breach, (or prime Divison) is a second Trench
all down one Curve of the Circle, (aforesaid) and some second Fractures on the
other side these be over the prime Trench or Breach li^th a narrow path way;
the fa^^n part, whose Hypotenusal should fall upon the true Angular Point, (i^
it had a Perpendicular Fall:) is subverted, and turned aside on Foot, or more.

Between the Prime Breach, and second Curvery Fracture, the Earth shows a
Perpendicular Decent, or Downright Falling, because it does thrust it self
within its former bounds; on the other side of the Curve, which is higher
Ground, the parts of the Earth fallen, and un^allen, shows the distance of a
Foot; which if it should be raised to a Parallel with its former Bounds, would
differ half a Yard. The Sine for these Curves, is the Radius, or total Sine.

The lower part of the Periphery, (or Arch opposite to the Primary Breach) is
rolled in, with an overshooting of his Bounds; as if it were driven, being
light in substance, and stones (in some places thereof) thrusts forth
themselves. This lower Curve contains about half the Radius for its versed Sine.

The unbreached part of the Periphery lies on the lower side of the Hill, in
respect to the Hills ridge.

Some Persons judge WATER to be the cause of the BREACH; others, say WIND.
The latter we account proper, and consider both, in method and manner
following.

1. That it was not WATER. 2. That it was occasioned by Wind.
REASONS Negative, and Affirmative, That it was not WATER.
Reas. 1. Water does naturally run in a Channel, hasting forward, yea, and that
where the Ground is level: but where the Ground descends through which it is
to pass, there it forces with a more direct course, and speedy stream; not
dilating it self, but rather drawing its Body more close into narrow Bounds.

Reas. 2. If Water had been the cause, then it should not have run in a round
Figure, where the Hill is so much descending; unless some artificial Pipes had
been laid, which by the attractive power of the Air should draw the Water up
again; which if Fancy, or any persons Supposition should incline to, yet
nevertheless it would have more powerful force in its Descent, than Ascent.

Reas. 3. Had Water (by its violent Billows) caused this Accident, it would
either have done it by an Eruption outward, or a Dissolution of the Earth
within, whereby the upper Superncies should have fallen in, or sunk within its
counterminal Sides. Indeed, some part of the Ground we allow to be depressed,
but another part is not, but rather heightened, by rolling up. And how any thing
should produce contrary effects to its nature, is mavelous!

Reas. 4. Had Water been the cause by demolishing the intrels of the Earth,
then (running in a Channel) the Breach should be opposite to its Current; and
should from hence the current of Water be guest to fall where the Ground is
fallen in all down one Curve of the Circle, then should not other Breach
considerable appear from its Production, and the Earth would have been overshot
or carried that way as the Current of Water past; but the Earth is carried that
way where no such salling in appears.

That it was WIND.
Reas. 1. Because it is so improbable to be Water; but we judge Wind ^^gh^ be
the Ca^^^, fora^much as it is its property to produce ^^ch (...).

Reas. 2 For Wind being gathered, and straightened within the Bowels of the
^arth, in order to an Earthquake, does at last (by a vo^^tile motion) break or
burst forth in some plac^, or other, with g^^at violence, rending, tw^^^ing in,
and burying the ea^^^ within is own b^^vels: and in ^s motion, arc^^ng, flying,
and searching about, might (very naturally) cause this Breach.

Reas. 3. Because the lower part of the Periphery which is oversh^^ lies rolled
in, hu^^, or blown* dar^ing from its swo^n (or enlarged) Pores, Stones o^ a
considerable weight: as also the root of a Tree, which is turned up in the
Primary Breach.

Reas. 4. This being at the Front of a hilly Range, the Earthquake might come
running along, and there disburden it self: and that moreover that it is free
from Rocks, the Ground solvable; and consequently the Pores more easily
extended.

Arguments corresponding with the former Reasons.
1. Arg. If Water had been the cause, then from a slant Descent, or Ascent, the
Breach would have showed it self in a right lined, or serpentine Figure, and
more especially in a right lined Figure, its Surface having Declination.

But this Breach is circular, and declining, contrary to a right lined, or
serpentine Figure.

Therefore the Cause could not be Water.

2. Arg Water was not the Cause, but rather Wind; for Wind is volotile, light,
and forcible, and known to be of circular motion; where it is streighten'd, and
wants liberty to disburden, or disperse it self into its own Element, it
searches a passage, and by Operation, is (by Philosophers) accounted the cause
of Earthquakes, it vents, and turns up the Earth in its delivery thence.

But, in this Breach the Figure is circular, diversely fractured, blown or hu^^
up, writhed, which are the Symptoms of an Earthquake.

Ergo. Wind was the proper and true Cause.

Now it remains that we answer three Objections, and conclude.
1. Object. May some say, Had there been an Earthquake, why was it not
discerned, felt, or discovered by one or other?

2. Object. Though Towns be not very nigh, yet there be some Inhabitants on the
^orest nigh resident, and would not they have been sensible of some motion or
noise which accompany Earthquakes?

3. Object. There be many Trees not far off, would not some of them have
received prejudice by overturning, or Rocks where you suppose the windy
commotion ran along.

Answers to the Objections.
Ans. 1. Had there been any Inhabitants dwelling on the said Hill, they might
then have felt it.

Ans. 2. As for them that dwell nigh, they might very well be unsensible of
noise, or motion, which might happen in the Night; and because Earthquakes
(more general ones) have been experienced to operate in one part of the Town,
and not in another part of the same; or in a various manner, in little
distance; no wonder then if such Inhabitants perceive it not.

Ans. 3. As for Trees, how should they be prejudiced, where the Earthquake came
not? but had Trees stood where the Breach was made, they would probably then
have been overthrown (as the roo^ of a Tree aforesaid) and as for Rocks being
not removed over the windy passage, they might be spared for the same reason
that the ground in those places was; and both spared, because the disturbance
hastens along to the Front, as a Stone to its Center.

FINIS.
