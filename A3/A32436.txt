A PROCLAMATION For due Execution of the late Act of Parliament against
Importing Cattle from Ireland, and other Parts beyond the Seas.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings Majesty being advertised, That since, and contrary to the said late
Act, great numbers of Cattle have been brought from Ireland into several parts
of this Realm, and sundry fraudulent practices used, to evade the said Act, and
the Forfeitures and Penalties thereby imposed: His Majesty therefore (by the
Advice of His Privy Council) does hereby strictly Charge and Command, That the
said Act be duly obseved, and in no wise eluded by any fraudulent contrivance
whatsoever, And forasmuch as His Majesty is informed, That amongst other undue
practices, the Officers (who by the said Act are appointed to be Seizors) after
the Seizure made, by underhand, agreements between them and the Owners, or some
on their behalf, have made colorable Sales to them, or for their use, of the
Cattle seized, at small and unvaluable Prices, intending thereby, and other
like frauds, to avoid the said Act: His Majesty does strictly Charge and
Command the Constables, Tythingmen, Headboroughs, Churchwardens, and Overseers
of the Poor, to make due Seizures according to the said Act, and to take
especial care that the Cattle seized be sold for the full and real value
thereof, and that the moneys arising thereby, be duly disposed as by the said
Act is directed, without any fraud or collusion. And His Majesty Wills and
Commands the Justices of Peace of the respective Counties, and especially
those who live near the place where such Cattle shall be landed, strictly to
enquire into all abuses tending to evade the said Act, and bind over the
Offenders, as well the Owners and Importers of the Cattle, and their Agents, as
the Officers that shall Seize the same, to the next Assizes or Sessions to be
held for the County where such Seizure shall be, and cause them to be Indicted
and prosecuted for the confederacies and other practices against the said Act.

And His Majesty does further direct the Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers,
and other Officers of His Ports where such Cattle shall be landed (if any be)
forthwith to certify His Privy Council, the Numbers, and the Names of the
Owners or Importers thereof, and the Parish or place into which they shall be
first brought, to the end such further directions may be given, and proceedings
had, as shall be agreeable to Justice, and that the said Act of Parliament may
be inviolably observed.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Thirtieth of September, 1667.
