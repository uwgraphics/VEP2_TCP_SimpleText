John Hawkins As an acknowledgement of unmerited favors, humbly Dedicateth
this Manuel of Arthmetick.

Courteous Reader,
I Having the Happiness of an Intimate Acquaintance with Mr. Cocker in his life
time, often solicited him to remember his Promise to the world of Publishing
his Arithmetic, but (for Reasons best known to himself) he refused it, and
(after his Death) the Copy falling accidentally into my hands, I thought it not
convenient to smother a work of so considerable a moment, not questioning but
it might be as kindly accepted as if it had been presented by his own hand. The
Method is Familiar and easy, discovering as well the Theorick as the Practick
of that most Necessary Art of Vulgar Arithmetic: and thou may speedily
expect his Decimal, Logarithmetical, and Algebraical Arithmetic, concerning
which thou have a further account given at the end of this Book. In the mean
time Judge favorably of the present undertaking, and thou will Oblige him, who
is,

Thine to Serve thee, John Hawkins.
From my School near St. George's Church in Southwark, Nov. 29. 1677.
Mr. Edward Cocker's PROEME or PREFACE.
BY the sacred influence of Divine Providence, I have been instrumental to the
benefit of many, by virtue of those useful Arts, Writing and Engraving: And do
now with the same wonted alacrity cast this my Arithmetical Mite into the
public Treasury; beseeching the Almighty to grant the like blessing to these,
as to my former labors.

Seven Sciences supremely excellent
Are the chief Stars in Wisdom's Firmament:
Whereof Arithmetic is one, whose worth
In beams of Profit and Delight shines forth.
This crowns the rest: this makes man's mind complete;
This treats of Numbers, and of this we treat.
I have been often desired by my intimate Friends to publish something on this
Subject; who in a pleasing freedom have signified to me that they expected it
would be extraordinary. How far I have answered their expectations, I know not;
but this I know, that I have designed this Work not extraordinary abstruse or
profound, but have by all means possible, within the circumference of my
capacity, endeavored to render it extraordinary useful to all those whose
occasions shall induce them to make use of Numbers. If it be objected that the
Books already published, treating of Numbers, are innumerable; I answer, that is
but a small wonder, since the Art is infinite. But that there should be so many
excellent Tracts of Practical Arithmetic extant, and so little practiced, is
to me a greater wonder: knowing that as Merchandise is the Life of the
Weal-publick; so Practical Arithmetic is the Soul of Merchandise. Therefore I
do ingenuously profess, that in the beginning of this undertaking, the numerous
concerns of the honored Merchants first possessed my consideration: and how far
I have accommodated this Composure for his most worthy service, let his own
profitable experience be judge.

Secondly, For your service, most excellent Professors, whose understandings
soar to the subli^^^y of the Theory and Practice of this noble Science, was
this Arithmetical Tractate composed: which you may please to employ as a
monitor to instruct your young Tyroes, and thereby take occasion to reserve
your precious moments, which might be exhausted that way, for your more
important affairs.

Thirdly, For you, the ingenious Offspring of happy Parents, who will
willingly pay the full price of Industry and Exercise for those Arts and choice
accomplishments which may contribute to the felicity of your future state. For
you, I say (ingenious Practitioners) was this Work composed, which may prove
the pleasure of your youth, and the glory of your age.

Lastly, for you the pretended Numerists of this vapouring age, who are more
disingenuously witty to propound unnecessary questions, than ingeniously
judicious to resolve such as are necessary. For you was this Book composed and
published, if you will deny your selves so much as to invert the streams of
your ingenuity, and by studiously conferring with the Notes, Names, Orders,
Progress, Species, Properties, Proprieties, Proportions, Powers, Affections and
Applications of Numbers ^elivered herein, become such Artists indeed, as you
now only seem to be. This Arithmetic ingeniously observed, and diligently
practiced, will turn to good account to all that shall be concerned in
Accounts. All whose Rules are grounded on Verity, and delivered with Sincerity.
The examples are built up gradually from the smallest consideration to the
greatest. All the Problemes or Propositions are well weighed, pertinent and
clear, and not one of them throughout the Tract taken upon trust; therefore
now, Zoilus and Momus lie you down and dye,
For these inventions your whole force defy.


Edward Cocker.

Courteous Reader,
Being well acquainted with the deceased Author, and finding him knowing and
studious in the Mysteries of Numbers and Algebra, of which he had some choice
Manuscripts, and a great Collection of Printed Authors in several Languages. I
doubt not but he has writ his Arithmetic suitable to his own Preface, and
worthy acceptance, which I thought to certify on a request to that purpose
made to him that wishes thy welfare, and the progress of Arts.

CHAP. I. Notation of Numbers.
I. ARITHMETIC is an Art of Numbering, or Knowledge which teaches to Number
well; ( viz.) the Doctrine of Accompting by Numbers. And there are diverse
species and kinds of Arithmetic and Geometry, the which we do intend to treat
of in order, applying the Principles of the one, to the Definitions of the
other: For as Magnitude or Greatness is the subject of Geometry, so Multitude
or Number, is the subject of Arithmetic; and if so, then their first
Principles and chief Fundamentals, must have like Definitions; or at least, a
Semblable Congruency.

II. Number, is that by which the Quantity of any thing is Expressed or
Numbered; as the Unit is a number by which the quantity of one thing is
expressed or said to be one, and two by which it is named two, and half by
which it is named or called half, and the Root of 3 by which it is called the
Root of 3, the like of any other.

3. Hence it is that Unit is Number, for the part is of the same matter that is
his whole, the Unit is part of the Multitude of Units, therefore the Unit is of
the same matter that is the Multitude of Units; but the matter of the multitude
of Units is number, therefore the matter of Unit is number: for else if from a
number given no number be subtracted, the number given remains; let three be
the number given, from which number substract, or take away one (which as some
conceive is no number) therefore the number given remains, that is to say,
there remains three, which is absurd.

4. Hence it will be convenient to examine from whence number has its Rise or
Beginning; Most Authors maintain that Unit is the beginning of number, and it
self no number; but looking upon the Principles and Definitions in the first
rudiments of Geometry, we shall find, that the definition of a point is in no
way congruous with the definition of an Unit in Arithmetic; and therefore one,
or unit must be in the bounds or limits of Number, and consequently the
beginning of number is not to be found in the number one; wherefore to make
number and magnitude congruent in Principles, and like in Definitions, we make
and constitute a Cipher to be the beginning of number, or rather the medium
between Increasing and Decreasing numbers, commonly called absolute or whole
numbers, and negative or fractional numbers, between which, nothing can be
Imagined more agreeable to the definition of a point in Geometry; for as a
point is an adjunct of a line and it self no line, so is (0) Cipher an adjunct
of number and it self no number: And as a point in Geometry cannot be divided
or increased into parts, so likewise (0) cannot be divided or increased into
parts; for as many points though in number infinite do make no line, so many
(0) Ciphers, though in number infinite do make no number. For the line AB
cannot be ^ Increased by the addition of the point. C, neither can the number D
be increased by the addition of the (0) Cipher E, for if you add nothing to 6,
the sum will be 6, (0) neither increasing nor diminishing the number 6, but if
it be granted that AB be extended or prolonged to the point C, so that AC be
made a continued line, then AB is increased by the addition of the point C, In
like manner if we grant D 6 be prolonged to E (0) so that DE (60) be a
continued number making 60, then 6 is Augmented by the Aid of (0) as to the
constituting the number (60) sixty, And furthermore that one or unit is
material and a number, and that (0) is the beginning of number, is proved by
all Authors although indirectly, for the Tables of Sines and Tangents prove one
degree to be a number, because the Sine of 1 degree is 174524 (the Radius being
10000000) and the beginning of that Table is (0) and to it Answers 00000 etc.

5. Hence it is that number is not quantity discontinued, for all that which is
but one quantity, is not quantity disjunct; (60) sixty as it is a number, is
one quantity, viz. one number: (60) sixty therefore as it is number, it is not
quantity disjunct; for number is some such thing in magnitude, as humidity in
water; for as humidity extends it self through all and every part of Water, so
Number alated to magnitude, does extend it self through all and every part of
magnitude. Also as to continued Water does answer continued Humidity, so to a
continued Magnitude does answer a continue^ Number. As the continued Humidity
or any entire Water, suffers the same Division and Distinction that his Water
does; so the continued Number suffers the same Division and Distinction that
his Magnitude does. From all which considerations we might enlarge a farther
digression concerning Number and Magnitude, by comparing the Definitions of the
one, with the Principles of the other, for having found a (0) Cipher to be
answerable in Definition to a point in Magnitude, we may very well conclude
that number may be congruent to a line; as also the Figurative number to be
consonant in definition with a superficies, and solid, etc. in the order of
Geometrical Magnitudes.

6. The Characters or Notes by which Numbers are signified, or by which a
Number is ordinarily expressed, are these following, ( viz) 0 Cipher or
nothing, 1 One, 2 Two, 3 Three, 4 Four, 5 Five, 6 Six, 7 Seven, 8 Eight, 9
Nine; The Cipher which though of it self signifies nothing, ( viz.) expresses
not any certain, or known quantity, but is the beginning, Radix or Root of
Number, and the other nine Figures or Characters are called significant Figures
or Digits.

7. In Numbers of any sort, two things are to be considered, ( viz.) Notation
and Numeration.

8. Notation teaches how to describe any Number by certain Notes and
Characters, and to declare the value thereof being so described, and that is by
Degrees and Periods.

9. A degree consists of three figures, ( viz.) of three places comprehending
Units Tens and Hundreds, so 365 is a degree, and the first figure (5) on the
right hand, stands simply for its own value, being Units or so many ones (
viz.) five; the second in order from the right, signifies as many times ten, as
there are units contained in it, ( viz.) sixty; the third in the same order
signifies so may hundreds as it contains units so will the expression of the
Number be, three hundred sixty five, also 789, is seven hundred eighty nine,
etc.

10. A period is when a Number consists of more than three figures, or places,
and whose proper order is to prick or distinguish every third place, beginning
at the right hand, and so on to the left; so the Number 63452 being given it
will be distinguished thus, 63.452 and expressed thus sixty three thousand four
hundred fifty two, likewise 4.578.236.782 being distinguished as you see will
be expressed thus, four thousand five hundred seventy eight millions, two
hundred thirty six thousand, seven hundred eighty two.

11. Number is either Absolute or Negative.

12. An Absolute, or Entire, whole, Increasing Number, is that which by
annexing of another figure or cipher it becomes ten times as much as it stood
for before; and if two figures or ciphers be annexed, it makes it a hundred
times more than it stood for before, etc. as if you annex to the figure 6 a
Cipher, then it will become (60) sixty: so if two Ciphers be annexed, then it
will be (600) six hundred; and if you do annex to it a (4) four, then it will
be (64) sixty four; and if you annex (78) seventy eight, it will be then (678)
six hundred seventy eight, and so on: By annexing more figures or ciphers, it
will increase in a decuple proportion ad Infinitum.

13. A Negative, or Broken, Fractional, Decreasing Number, is that which by
prefixing a point or prick toward the left hand its value is decreased from so
many units, to so many tenth parts of any thing; and if a point and (0) cipher,
or a digit be prefixed, it will be then so many hundred parts, and if a point,
and two Ciphers, or digi^s be prefixed, its value is decreased to be so many
thousandth parts; as if you would prefix before the figure 3 a point (.) or
prick thus (.3) it is then decreased from 3 Units or Integers, to (3) three
tenth parts of a Unit or Integer, and if you prefix a point and cipher thus
(.03) it is decreased from 3 Integers to 3 hundredth parts of an Integer, and
by this means 5 l. Absolute by prefixing of a point will be decreased to 5 l.
Negative which is 5 tenth parts of a pound, equal in value to ten shillings;
And so by prefixing of more Ciphers or Digits, its value is decreased in a
decuple proportion ad infinitum. As in the following Scheme or rather order of
Numbers, we have placed (0) Cipher in its due place and order, as it is both
the beginning and medium of Number; for going from (0) toward the left hand
you deal with Entire, Absolute, Whole, Increasing Numbers.

Increasing Numbers. Decreasing Numbers 29 876 543 256 21 0 12 345 678 976 3 mm
mmm mmm mmm CX U XC mmm mmm mmm m mm mmm mmm CX XC mmm mmm m mm mmm CX XC mmm m
mm CX XC m X

But going from (0) the place of Units toward the Right hand, you meet with
broken, Negative, Fractional and Decreasing Numbers. And hence it follows that
Multiplication increases the product in Absolute Numbers, but decreaseth the
product in Negative Numbers; Also Division decreaseth the quotient in whole
Numbers, and increases it in Negative, or Fractional Numbers.

14. An Absolute, Entire, whole, Increasing number, has always a point annexed
toward the right hand and therefore

15. A Negative, Broken, Decimal, decreasing number, has always a point
prefixed before it toward the left hand. When we express Integers, or whole
number, as 5 pounds, 5 feet, 26 men, we usually annex a point or prick after
the number thus 5.5.26.347. l. feet. men. Inch.
But when we express Decimals, or Numbers that are denied to be Entire, as
decreasing numbers, we do commonly prefix a point or prick before the said
decimal, or decreasing number, thus (.3) that is 3 tenths, or 3 primes,.03,
that is 3 hundredths or 3 seconds.

16. A whole or absolute number is an unit or a Composed multitude of units,
and it is either a prime or else a compounded number.

17. Prime numbers amongst themselves are those which have no multitude of
units for a common measurer as 8 and 7 or 10 and 13 because not any multitude
of units can equally measure or divide them without a Remainder.

18. Compound numbers amongst themselves are those which have a multitude of
units for a common measurer, as 9 and 12 because 3 measures them exactly and
abbreviates them to 3 and 4.

19. A Broken number commonly called a fraction, is a part or parts of a whole
number; viz. a part of an Integer, as 1/^; one third, is one third part of an
unit.

20. A broken number, or fraction, consists of 2 parts, viz. the Numerator and
the Denominator.

21. The Numerator and Denominator of a fraction, are set one over the other,
with a line between them; and the Numerator is set above the line, and
expresses the parts therein contained.

22. The Denominator of a fraction is the Inferior number placed below the
line, and expresses the number of parts into which the unit or Integer is
divided; as let be the fraction given, so shall 3 be the numerator, and does
express or number the multitude of parts contained in this fraction, for is a
fraction composed of fourths, or quarters, and the figure 3 in numbering shows
us that in that fraction there are 3 of those fourth parts or quarters; also in
the same fraction, 4 is the denominator and does express the Quality of the
fraction, viz. that the whole, or integer, is here divided into 4 equal parts.

23. A broken number is either Proper or Improper; viz. Proper, when the
numerator is lesser than the denominator; so is a perfect proper fraction: But
an Improper fraction has its numerator greater, or at least equal to the
denominator; thus 13/8 is an Improper fraction: the Reason is given in the
definition.

24. A proper broken number, is either Simple, or Compound; viz. Simple, when
it has one Denomination, and Compound when it consists of diverse
Denominations. If l. 6/12 l. 25/100 l. were given, we say they are either of
them single, or simple fractions because they consist but of one numerator and
one denominator; but if of 6/12 of 25/100 of a pound sterling were given, we
say that it is a compound broken number, or fraction, because the expression
and representation, consists of more denominations than one; and such by some
are called fractions of fractions; and they have always this particle (of)
between them.

25. When a single broken number or fraction, has for his denominator a number
consisting of a Unit in the first place toward the left hand, and nothing but
Ciphers from the Unit toward the right hand, it is then the more aptly and
rightly called a decimal fraction; under this head are all our decreasing
numbers placed, and in our 13th definition called Negative, and by that order
there prescribed we order them to be Decimals, by signing a point or prick
before them, or the numerator rejecting the denominator: Therefore according to
our last Rule, 5/10 5/100 25/100 25/1000 are said to be Decimals; and a Decimal
fraction may be expressed without its denominator (as before) by prefixing a
point or prick before the numerator of the said fraction, and then shall the
former fraction 5/10 and 25/100 stand thus.5 and.25.

But oftentimes as in the second and 4th fractions 5/100 and 25/1000 a prick or
point will not do without the help of a cipher or ciphers prefixed before the
significant figures of the numerator, and therefore when the numerator of a
decimal fraction, consists not of so many places, as the denominator has
ciphers, fill up the void places of the numerator with prefixing Ciphers before
the significant figures of the numerator, and then sign it for a decimal, so
shall 5/100 be.05 and 25/1000 will be.025 and 72/10000 will be.0072. Now by
this we may easily discover the denominator having the numerator; for always
the denominator of any decimal fraction, consists of so many Ciphers as the
numerator has places, with a unit prefixed before the said Ciphers, viz. under
the point or prick.

26. A Decimal number or fraction, is that which is expressed by Primes,
Seconds, Thirds, Fourths, etc. and is Number decreasing. Here instead of
Natural and Common fractions, as of a thing, we order the thing or Integer into
Primes, Seconds, Thirds, Fourths, Fifths, etc. that our expression may be
consonant to our former order.

27. In Decimal Arithmetic, we always imagine (and it would be very commodious
if it were really so) that all entire units, Integers, and things are divided
first into ten equal parts, and these parts so divided we call Primes; and
secondly, we divide also each of the former primes into other ten equal parts,
and every of these divisions we call seconds; and thirdly, we divide each of
the said seconds into ten other equal parts, and those so divided we call
Thirds, and so by decimating the former and sub-decimating these latter, we run
on ad infinitum.

28. Let a pound sterling, Troy weight, Averdupois weight, Liquid measure, Dry
measure, Long measure, time, dozen or any other thing, or Integer be given to
be decimally divided; in this notion premised, we ought to let the first
division be Primes, the next division Seconds, the next Thirds, etc. So one
pound sterling being 20 shillings, which divided into ten equal parts the value
of each part will be two shillings; therefore one Prime of a pound sterling
will stand thus (.1) which is in value 2 shillings: Three Primes will stand
thus (.3) and that is in value 6 shillings. Again, a Prime or.1 being divided
into ten equal parts, each of those parts will be one Second, and is thus
expressed, (.01) and its value will be found to be 2d. farthing and 6/10 of a
farthing; and so will.05 signify one shilling or five Seconds. And if.01 be
divided into ten other equal parts, each of those parts so divided will be
Thirds, and will stand thus.001, and its value will be found to be.96 of a
farthing, or 96/100 of a farthing; and.009 Thirds will be 2d. and.64 of a
farthing, or 64/100 of a farthing, etc. So that.375 l. will be found to
Represent 7 s. and 6 d.; for the 3 Primes are 6 shillings, and the 7 Seconds
are 1 s. 4 d. and 8/10 of a penny, and the five Thirds are 1 penny and 2/10 of a
penny, both which added together make 7 s. 6 d.

29. If you put any bulk, or body, representing an Integer; if it be decimally
divided, then the parts in the first decimation are Primes, the next Seconds,
and the next decimation is Thirds, the next Fourths, etc. As let there be given
a bullet of Lead, or such like, whose weight let be 50 l. Troy, this call an
unit, Integer, or thing; then with the like weight and matter make 10 other,
the which together will be equal to 50 l. and will weigh each of them 5 l. a
piece; take of the same matter, and equal to 5 l. make 10 more, then each of
those will weigh 6 ounces a piece; also if again you take 6 ounces and thereof
make 10 other small bullets each of them will weigh 12 penny weight Troy; and
thus have you made Primes, Seconds, and Thirds, in respect of the Integer
containing 50 l. Troy weight: So that 5 Primes is equal to the half mass, and
2 Primes and 5 Seconds, is a quarter of the mass; and therefore 1 of the first
division, 2 of the second division, and 5 of the third division, will be equal
in weight to a quarter of the mass and contain 6 l. and 3 ounces.

30. When a decimal fraction follows a whole number, you are to separate or
part the decimal from the whole number by a point or prick; so if.75 followed
the whole number 32, set them thus 32.75. You will find that diverse Authors
have diverse ways in expressing mixed numbers, as thus, 3275_ or 32 75/100 or
32.75 but you will find that 32.75 thus placed and expressed is fittest for
Calculation.

31, A mixed Number has 2 parts, the whole and the broken; the whole is that
which is composed of Integers, and the broken is a fraction annexed thereunto.
So the mixed Number 36 8/12 being given we say that 36 is the whole Number,
which is composed of Integers, and the 8/12 is the broken Number annexed, which
shows that one of the former Integers (of that 36) being divided into 12
parts, this 8/12 does express 8 of those 12 parts more belonging to the said 36
Integers.

32. Denominative Numbers are of one, or of many, and those are of diverse
sorts and kinds, viz. Singular called unit, as 1; and Plural called multitude
as 2, 3, 4, 5: Single of one kind only, called digits, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, and Compound of many, as 10, 11, 12, etc. 102, 367, etc.

Proportional as single, Multiple, Double, Triple, Quadruple, etc. Denominate
as Pounds, Shillings, Pence; Undenominate as 1, 2, 3, etc. Perfect as 6, 28,
496, 8128, 130816, 2096128, etc. Whose parts are equal to the numbers;
Imperfect, unequal and more in the sum as 12 to 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Imperfect,
unequal and less than the sum, as 8 to 1, 2, 4. Numbers Commensurable and
Incommensurable, as 12 and 9 are Commensurable because three measures them both.

But 6 and 17 are Incommensurable because no one Common number or measure can
measure them; Linear in form of a line, as............ Superficial in form of a
Superficies or plane, as triangular array of dots or square array of dots etc.
and number Cubical or Solid in form of a Cube. These two latter are otherwise
called figurative numbers: There are also other numbers called Tabular, as
Sines, Tangents, Secants, etc. Others that be called Logarithmetick or borrowed
numbers, fitted to proportion for easy and speedy Calculation of all manner of
Questions.

CHAP. II. Of the Natural Division of Integers, and the several Denominations
of their parts.
1. BEfore we come to Calculation or the ordering of Numbers to operate any
Arithmetical Question proposed, we will lay down Tables of the Denomination of
several Integers; and after that (having mentioned the several Species or kinds
of Arithmetic) we shall immediately handle the Species of Numeration, which
are the main Pillars upon which the whole Fabric of this Art is built.

Of Money, Weights, etc.
2. The least Denomination or Fraction of money used in England is a farthing,
from whence is produced the following Tables, called the Tables of Coin, (viz.)
and therefore 1 farthing make 1 farthing l. s. d. qrs 4 farthings 1 Penny 1 20
12 4 12 Pence 1 shilling 1 20 240 960 20 Shillings 1 Pound 1 12 48 1 4 The
first of these Tables viz. that on the left hand is plain and easy to be
understood, and therefore wants no directions. In the second Table above the
line you have 1 l. 20 s. 12 d. 4 qts. whereby is meant that 1 pound is equal to
20 shillings, and one shilling is equal to 12 pence, and one penny equal to 4
farthings, under the line is 1 l. 20 s. 240 d. 960 qts. which signifies one
pound to contain 20 shillings or 240 pence, or 960 farthings; in the second
line below that is 1 s. 12 d. 48 qts. the first standing under the denomination
of shillings, whereby is to be noted that one shilling is equal to 12 pence, or
48 farthings, and likewise that below, that one penny is equal in value to four
farthings; understand the like reason in all the following Tables of weight,
measure, time, motion, and dozen.

Troy weight.
3. The least Fraction or Denomination of weight used in England is a grain of

Troy Weight serves only to weigh Bread, Gold, silver, and Electuaries; it
also regulateth, and prescribes a form how to keep the money of England at a
certain standard. The Goldsmiths have divided the ounce Troy weight into other
parts, which they generally call mark weight, the denominative parts thereof
are as follows, viz. A mark (being an ounce Troy) is divided into 24 equal
parts, called Carects and each Carect into 4 grains, so that in a mark are 96
Grains; by this weight they distinguish the different finess of their Gold, for
if to the finest of Gold be put 2 Carects of Alloy (which is of Silver, Copper,
or other baser mettle, with which they use to mix their Gold or silver to abate
the finess thereof) both making when cold but an ounce, or 24 Carects, then
this Gold is said to be 22 Carects fine, for if it come to be Refined the 2
Carects of alloy will fly away and leave only 22 Carects of pure Gold, the like
to be considered of a greater or lesser quantity; And as the finess of gold is
estimated by Carects, so the finess of silver is distinguished by ounces, for
if a pound of it be pure, and loses nothing in the Refining, such silver is
said to be twelve ounces fine, but if it loses any thing, it is said to
contain so much fineness as the loss wants of 12 ounces, as if it lose an
ounce, it is said to be 11 ounces fine, and if it lose one ounce 14 penny
weight, then it is said to be 10 ounces 6 penny weight fine, and that which
loses two ounces four penny weight 16 grains, is said to be nine ounces 15
penny weight 8 grains fine, etc. the like of a greater or lesser quantity.

Apothecaries weights.
4. The Apothecaries have their weights deduced from Troy weight, a pound Troy
being he greatest Integer, a Table of whose division and sub-division
follows, viz. 1 pound makes 12 ounces And therefore 1 ounce 8 drams l. oun.

5. Thus much concerning Troy weight, and its derivative weights (which as was
said before) serves to weigh Bread, Gold, Silver, and Electuaries; now besides
Troy weight there is another kind of weight used in England, commonly known by
the name of Averdupois weight, (a pound of which is equal to 14 ounces 12 penny
weight Troy weight) and it serves to weigh all kinds of Grocery wares, as
also butter, Cheese, Flesh, Wax, Tallow, Rozen, Pitch, Lead, and all such kind
of garbel, the Table of which weight is as follows.

The Table of Averdupois weight.
4 quarters of a dram makes one dram 16 drams one ounce 16 ounces one pound 28
Pounds 1 quarter of a hundred 4 quarters 1 hund. weight, or 112 20 Hundred 1
Tun.

And therefore.

Wool is weighed with this weight, but only the divisions are not the same; A
Table whereof follows.

A Table of the denominative parts of Wool-weight.
7 Pounds make 1 Clove 2 Cloves 1 Stone 2 Stone 1 Todd 6 Todd 1 Stone 1 Wey 2

Note that in some Countries the Wey is 256 l. Averdupois, as is the Suffolk
Wey; But in Essex there is 336 l. in a Wey.

6. The least Denominative part of Liquid measure is a Pint, and it is taken
from Troy weight, because 1 pound of wheat Troy weight makes 1 Pint liquid: A
Table of which Measure follows.

The Table of Liquid Measure.
1 pound of wheat Troy make 1 pint 2 pints 1 quart 2 quarts 1 pottle 2 pottles
1 gallon 8 gallons 1 firk. of ale, soap, or herr. 9 gallons 1 firkin of beer 10
gallons and a half 1 firk. of Salmon or Eeles 2 firkins 1 Kilderkin 2
Kilderkins 1 barrel 42 gallons 1 Tierce of wine 63 gallons 1 hogshead 2
hogsheads 1 pipe or butt 2 pipes or butts 1 Tunn of wine

And Therefore.

Tun* pipes hhds gall. pts grains of wh. 1 2 2 63 8 7680 1 2 4 252 2016

Thus you see that according to the standard of England a pint does contain
7680 grains of Natural wheat, but whosoever shall try the wheat growing in
Norfolk, shall find a Concave inch (that is a hollow, or hole made just the
bigness of an inch) to contain 280 kernels of wheat, and if you admit of 28
solid Inches in a pint, which according to the Judgment of Artists, is the
content of a pint wine-measure (the least of all measures) then a pint of such
measure will contain 8085 grains of wheat; which is very different from the
standard, but these things Quere.

7. The least Denominative part of dry measure is also a pint, and this is
likewise taken from Troy weight. The Table of whose division follows.

The Table of Dry Measure.
1 pint make 1 pint 2 pints 1 quart 2 quarts 1 pottle 2 pottles 1 gallon 2

And therefore.

8. The least Denominative part of Long Measure is a Barley-corn well dried and
taken out of the middle of the ear: whose Table of parts follows.

The Table of Long Measure.
3 barley corns make an Inch 12 Inches 1 foot 3 feet 1 yard 3 feet 9 inches or
a yard and quart. 1 Ell English 6 feet 1 fadom 5 yards and an half 1 pole or
perch 40 poles or perches 1 furlong 8 furlongs 1 English mile

And Therefore.

And note that the yard, as also the ell, is usually divided into 4 quarters,
and each quarter into 4 Nails.

Note also, that a Geometrical pace is 5 feet; and there are 1056 such paces in
an English mile.

9. The parts of the Superficial measures of land, are such as are mentioned in
the following Tables, viz.

The Table of Land Measure.
40 Square Poles or Perches make 1 Rood or quarter of an Acre. 4 Roods 1 Acre.

By the foregoing Table of long Measure, you are Informed what a pole, or
(which is all one) perch is; and by this that 40 square perches are 1 Rood. Now
a square perch is a Superficies very aptly resembled by a square Trencher,
every side thereof being a Perch or 5 Yards and a half in length, 40 of them is
a Rood, and 4 Roods an Acre. So that a Superficies that is 40 perches long and
4 broad is an Acre of land the Acre containing in all 160 square Perches.

10. The least Denominative part of Time is a Minute, the greatest Integer
being a Year; from whence is produced this following Table.

The Table of Time.
1 Minute make 1 Minute 60 Minutes 1 Hour 24 Hours 1 Day natural 7 Days 1
Week 4 Weeks 1 Month 13 months 1 day and 6 hours 1 Year.

But the year is usually divided into 12 unequal Calendar Months, whose names
and the number of Days that they Contain, follow, viz.

days January 31 February 28 March 31 April 30 May 31 June 30 July 31 August 31
September 30 October 31 November 30 December 31 So that the year contains 365
days, and 6 hours, but the 6 hours is not reckoned but only every 4 year, and
then there is a day added to the latter end of February, and then it contains
29 days, and that year is called Leap-year, and contains 366 days.

And here Note, that as the Hour is divided into 60 Minutes, so each Minute is
subdivided into 60 Seconds, and each Second into 60 Thirds, and each Third into
60 Fourths, etc.

The Tropical year by the exactest observations of the most accurate
Astronomers, is found to be 365 Days, 5 Hours, 49 Minutes, 4. Seconds and 21
Thirds.

CHAP. III. Of the Species or Kinds of Arithmetic.
1. Arithmetic is either Natural, Artificial, Analiticall, Algebraical,
Lineal, or Instrumental.

2. Natural Arithmetic, is that which is performed by the Numbers themselves;
and this is either Positive or Negative. Positive which is wrought by certain
infallible numbers propounded, and this is either single or Comparative;
Single, which considers the nature of numbers simply by themselves; and
Comparative which is wrought by numbers as they have Relation one to another.
And the Negative part relates to the Rule of False.

3. Artificial (by some called Logarithmetical) Arithmetic is that which is
performed by Artificial or borrowed numbers invented for that purpose, and are
called Logarithmes.

4. Analiticall Arithmetic, is that which shows from a thing unknown, to find
truly that which is sought; always keeping the Species without Change.

5. Algebraical Arithmetic, is an obscure and hidden art of Accompting by
numbers in resolving of hard Questions.

6. Lineal Arithmetic, is that which is performed by lines, fitted to
proportions as also Geometrical projections.

7. Instrumental Arithmetic, is that which is Performed by Instruments, fitted
with Circular and Right lines of proportions, by the motion of an Index or
otherwise.

8. The parts of single Arithmetic are Numeration and the Extraction of Roots.

9. Numeration is that which by certain known numbers propounded, we discover
another Number unknown.

10. Numeration has four Species; viz. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication,
and Division,

CHAP. IV. Of Addition of whole Numbers.
1. ADdition is the Reduction of two, or more numbers of like kind together
into one Sum or Total. Or it is that by which diverse numbers are added
together, to the end that the Sum or Total value of them all may be discovered.

The first number in every addition is called the Addable number, the other,
the number or numbers added, and the number invented by the Addition is called
the Aggregate or Sum, containing the value of the Addition.

The Collation of the numbers, is the right placing of the numbers given
respectively to each denomination; And the Operation is the Artificial adding
of the numbers given together in order to the finding out of the Aggregate or
Sum.

2. In Addition, place the numbers given respectively the one above the other,
in such sort, that the like degree, place, or denomination may stand in the
same Series, viz. Units under Units, Tens under Tens, Hundreds under Hundreds,
etc. Pounds under Pounds, Shillings under Shillings, Pence under Pence, etc.
Yards under Yards, Feet under Feet, etc.

3. Having thus placed the numbers given (as before) and drawn a line under
them, Add them together, beginning with the lesser denomination, viz. at the
right hand and so on, subscribing the sum under the line Respectively; as for
Example.

Let there be given 3352 and 213 and 133 to be added together, I set the Units
in each particular number under each other, and so likewise the Tens under the
Tens, etc. and draw a line under them as in the margent, then I begin at the
place ^ of Units and add them together upwards saying, 3 and 3 are 6 and 2 make
8, which I set under the line, and under the same figures added together; then
I proceed to the next place, being the place of Tens, and add them up in the
same manner as I did the place of Units, saying 3 and 1 are 4 and 5 are 9,
which I likewise set under the line Respectively; then I go to the place of
Hundreds, and add them up as I did the other, saying 1 and 2 are 3 and 3 are 6,
which I also set under the line; and lastly I go to the place of Thousands, and
because there are no other figures to add to the 3, I set it under the line in
its respective place, and so the work is finished; and I find the sum of the 3
given numbers to be 3698.

4. But if the sum of the figures of any Series exceeds ten, or any number of
tens, subscribe under the same the Excess above the tens, and for every ten
carry one to be added to the next Series toward the left hand, and so go on
until you have finished your addition; always remembering, that how great
soever the sum of the figures of the last Series is, it must all be set down
under the line Respectively. So 3678 being given to be added to 2357, I set
them down as is before directed and as in the margent, with a line drawn under
them, then I begin and add them, saying 7 and 8 are 15 ^ which is 5 above ten,
I set 5 under the line, and carry 1 for the ten to be added to the next Series,
saying 1 that I carried and 5 is 6 and 7 are 13 I set down 3 and carry 1 for
the ten, then to the next Series, I say 1 that I carried and 3 are 4 and 6 are
ten, now because it come to just 10 and no more, I set 0 under the line and
carry 1 for the ten to the next, and say 1 that I carried and 2 are 3 and 3 are
6 which I set down in its Respective place, thus the addition is ended, and the
total Sum of these numbers is found to be 6035, several Examples of this kind
follow.

^

5. If the Numbers given to be added are contained under diverse denominations,
as of Pounds, Shillings, Pence and Farthings; or of Tuns, Hundreds, Quarters,
Pounds, etc. Then in this case having disposed of the numbers, each
denomination under other of like kind; begin at the least denomination,
(minding how many of one denomination do make an Integer in the next) and
having added them up, for every Integer of the next greater denomination that
you find therein contained, bear a unit in mind to be added to the said next
greater denomination, expressing the excess respectively under the line,
proceed in this manner until your addition be finished, the following Examples
will make the Rule plain to the learner. Thus these several sums being given to
be added, viz. 136 l. 13 s. 4 d. 2 qrs. and 79 l. 07 s. 10 d. 3 qrs. and 33 l.
18 s. 09 d. 1 qrs. also 15 l. 9 s. 5 d. 0 qrs. The numbers being disposed
according to order will stand as in the Margent. Then I begin at the
denomination of Farthings l. s. d. qrs. 136 13 04 2 79 07 10 3 33 18 09 1 15 09
05 0 265 09 05 2 and add themup, saying 1 and 3 are 4 and 2 make 6, now I
consider that 6 Farthings, is 1 penny and 2 farthings, wherefore I set down the
2 Farthings in its place under the line, and keep 1 in mind to be added to the
next denomination of Pence; then I go on, saying 1 that I carried and 5 are 6
and 9 are 15 and 10 are 25 and 4 are 29, now I consider that 29 pence are 2
shillings and 5 pence, wherefore I set the 5 pence in order under the line and
keep 2 in mind for the 2 shillings, to be added to the shillings; then I go on
saying, 2 that I carried, and 9 are 11, and 18 are 29, and 7 are 36, and 13 are
49; then I consider that 49 shillings are 2 Pounds and 9 shillings, wherefore I
set the 9 shillings under the line, and carry 2 for the 2 pounds, to the next
and last denomination of pounds, and proceed saying, 2 that I carried, and 5
make 7. and 3 are 10, and 9 are 19, and 6 are 25; I then set down 5 and carry 2
for the 2 tens and proceed saying 2 that I carry and 1 is 3, and 3 are 6, and 7
are 13, and 3 make 16; I set down 6 and carry 1 for the ten, and go on saying 1
that I carried and 1 are 2 which I set in its place under the line, and the
work is finished, and thus I find the Sum of the foresaid Numbers to be 265 l.
09 s. 05 d. 2 qrs. This to the Ingenious practitioner is sufficient, but I
shall (for the further illuminating of weaker apprehensions) explain the
operation of another Example in Troy weight; and here the Learner must take
notice of the Table of Troy weight, mentioned or set down in the third Section
of the second Chapter. The numbers given in this Example, are 38 l. 07 oz. 13
p.w. 18 gr. And 50 l. 10 oz. 10 p.w. 12 gr. And 42 l. 08 oz. 05 p.w. 16 gr. And
in order to the Addition thereof, I place them as you see, and proceed to
operation; saying 16 and 12 are 28, and 18 are 46; now because 24 grains l. oz.
p.w. gr. 38 07 13 18 50 10 10 12 42 08 05 16 132 02 09 22 make 1 penny weight,
46 grains are 1 penny weight and 22 grains; wherefore I set down 22, and carry 1
for the the penny weight, and going on I say o^e that I carry and 5 make 6, and
10 are 16, and 13 are 29, which is 1 ounce and 9 penny weight; I set down 9 in
its place under the line, and carry 1 to the ounces, saying 1 that I carry and
8 are 9, and 10 are 19, and 7 are 26, and because 26 ounces make 2 pound 2
ounces, I set down 2 for the ounces, and carry 2 to the pounds; going on, 2
that I carry and 2 are 4, and 8 make 12, that is 2 and go 1; then 1 I carry and
4 are 5, and 5 are 10, and 3 are 13, which I set down as in the Margent, and
the work is finished, and I find the sum of the said numbers to amount to 132
l. 02 oz. 09 p.w. 22 gr. This is sufficient for the understanding of the
following Examples, or any other that shall come to thy view. The way of
proving these or any sums in this Rule is showed Immediately after the ensuing
Examples.

The proof of Addition.
6. Addition is proved after this manner, when you have found out the sum of
the Numbers given, then separate the uppermost line from the rest, with a
stroke or dash of the pen, and then add them all up again as you did before,
leaving out the uppermost line, and having so done add this new invented Sum to
the uppermost line you separated, and if the Sum of those two lines be equal to
the Sum first sound out, then the work was performed true, otherwise not, As
for Example, let us prove the first example of Addition of money whose sum we
found to be 265 l. 9 s. 5 d. 2 qrs, and which we prove thus, having separated
the l. s. d. qts. 136 13 04 2 79 07 10 3 33 18 09 1 15 09 05 0 265 09 05 2 128
16 01 0 265 09 05 2 uppermost number from the rest, by a line as you see in the
margent, then I add the same together again, leaving out the said uppermost
line, and the sums thereof, I set under the first Sum, or true sum, which does
amount to 128 l. 16 s. 01 d. 0 qrs. then again I add this new Sum to the
uppermost line that before was separated from the rest, and the Sum of these
two is 265 l. 9 s. 05 d. 2 qrs. the same with the first Sum, and therefore I
conclude that the operation was rightly performed.

7. The main end of Addition in Questions Resolvable thereby to know the sum of
several debts, parcels, Integers, etc. some Questions may be these that follow

Quest. 1. There was an old man whose age was required, to which he replied, I
have seven sons each having two years between the birth of each other, and in
the 44 year of my age my eldest son was born, which is now the age of my
youngest; I demand what was the old man's age?

Now to Resolve this Question, ^ first set down the fathers age at the birth of
his first child, which was 44, then the difference between the eldest and the
youngest, which is 12 years, and then the age of the youngest which is 44, and
then add them all together, and their sum is 100, the complete age of the
Father.

Quest. 2. A man lent his friend at several t^mes, these several sums, ( viz.)
at one time 63 l. at another time 50 l. at another time 48 l. at another time
156 l. now I desire to know how much was lent him in all.

Set the sums lent one under another, ^ as you see in the margent, and then add
them together, and you w^ll find their sum to amount to 317 l. which is the
Total of all the several sums lent, and so much is due to the Creditor.

Quest. 3. From London to Ware is 20 miles, thence to Huntington 29 miles,
thence to Standford 21, thence to Tuxford 36 miles, thence to Wentbridge 25
miles, from thence to York 20 miles. Now I desire to know how many miles it is
from London to York according to this Reckoning?

Now to answer this Question, ^ set down the several distances given as you see
in the margent, and add them together, and you will find their sum to amount
to 151, which is the true distance in miles between London and York.

Quest. 4. There are 2 numbers the least whereof is 40, and their difference is
14, I desire to know what is the greater number, and also what is the sum of
them both? First set down the least ^ viz. 40, and 14 the difference, and add
them together, and their sum is 54 for the greatest number, then I set 40, (the
least) under 54, (the greatest) and add them together, and their sum is 94,
equal to the greatest and least numbers.

CHAP. V. Of Subtraction of whole Numbers.
1. Subtraction is the taking of a lesser number out of a greater of like kind,
whereby to find out a third number, being or declaring the Inequality, excess,
or difference between the numbers given, or Subtraction is that by which one
number is taken out of another number, given to the end that the residue, or
remainder may be known, which remainder is also called the rest or difference
of the numbers given.

2. The number out of which Subtraction is to be made, must be greater, or at
least equal with the other number given, the h^gher or superior number is
called the major number, and the lower or inferior is called the minor number,
and the operation of Subtraction being finished, the rest or remainder is
called the difference of the numbers given.

3. In Subtraction place the numbers given respectively, the one under the
other, in such sort as like degrees, places, or denominations may stand in the
same Series, viz. Units under units* Tens under Tens, etc. Pounds under Pounds,
etc. Feet under Feet, and Parts under Parts, etc. This being done, draw a line
underneath, as in Addition.

4. Having placed the numbers given as is before directed, and drawn a line
under them, Substract the lower number, (which in this case must always be
lesser than the uppermost) out of the higher number, and subscribe the
difference, or remainder, respectively below the line; and when the work is
finished, the number below the line will give you the Remainder; As for
Example, let 364521 be given to be Subtracted from 795836, I set the lesser
under the greater as in the margent, and draw a line under them, then beginning
at the Right hand, I say 1 out of 6 and ^ there Remains 5, which I set in order
under the line; then I proceed to the next, saying 2 from 3 rests 1, which I
note also under the line, and thus I go on until I have finished the work, and
then I find the Remainder or difference to be 431315.

5. But if it so happen (as commonly it does) that the lowermost number or
figure is greater then the uppermost; then in this case, add ten to the
uppermost number, and Subtract the said lowermost number from their sum, and
the remainder place under the line, and when you go to the next figure below,
pay a unit by adding it thereto for the 10 you borrowed before, and subtract
that from the higher number or figure: And thus go on until your Subtraction
be finished. As for Example; Let 437503 be given, from whence it is required to
subtract 153827, I dispose of the numbers as is before directed, and as you see
in the margent; then I begin, saying 7 from 3 I cannot, but (adding 10 thereto
I say) 7 from 13 and there Remains 6 ^ which I set under the line in order;
then I proceed to the next figure, saying 1 that I borrowed and 2 is 3 from 0 I
cannot, but 3 from 10 and there remains 7, which I likewise set down as before;
then one that I borrowed and eight is nine, from five I cannot, but nine from
fifteen and there remains six; then one I borrowed and three is four, from
seven and there remains three; then five from three I cannot, but five from
thirteen and there remains eight; then one I borrowed and one are two, from
four and there rests two; And thus the work is finished, and after these
numbers are Subtracted one from another, the inequality, remainder, excess, or
difference is found to be 283676. Examples for thy further experience may be
these that follow.

From 3475016 From 3615746 Take 738642 Take 5864 Rests 2736374 Rests 3609882

6. If the Sums or Numbers to be Subtracted, are of several Denominations,
place the lesser Sum below the greater, and in the same Rank and order as is
showed in Addition of the same Numbers; then begin at the Right hand, and take
the lower number out of the uppermost, if it be lesser; but if it be bigger
then the uppermost, then borrow a Unit from the next greater Denomination, and
turn it into the parts of the lesser Denomination, and add those parts to the
uppermost Number, and from their Sum substract the lowermost, noting the
remainder below the line; then proceed and pay 1 to the next Denomination for
that which you borrowed before, and proceed in this order until the work be
finish^ed, An Example of this Rule may be thi^ that follows; let 375 l. 13 s.
07 d. 1 qrs be given, from whence let it be required to Subtract 57 l. 16 s. 03
d. 2 qrs. In orde^ whereunto I place the numbers as you see i^ the margent, and
thus I begin at the leas^ Denomination saying l. s. d. qr^ 375 13 07 1 57 16 03
2 317 17 03 ^3 two from one I cannot, therefore I borrow one penny from the next
denomination and turn it into farthings which is four, and adding four (...)
one which is five I say, but two from fiv^ and there remains three, which I put
und^^ the line; then going on, I say one that I borrowed and three is four,
from 7 and there Rests three; then going on, I say sixteen from thirteen I
cannot, but (borrowing one pound and turning it into twenty shillings; I add it
to thirteen and that is thirty three, wherefore I say) sixteen from thirty
three, and there remains seventeen, which I set under the line and go on,
saying one that I borrowed and seven is eight, from five I cannot, but eight
from fifteen and there remains seven; then one that I borrowed and five is six,
from seven there Rests one, and nothing from three Rests three, and the work is
done; And I find the remainder or difference to be 317 l. 17 s. 03 d. 3 qrs.

Another Example of Troy weight may be this, I would Subtract 17 l. 10 oz. 11
p.w. 20 gr. from 24 l. 05 oz. 00 p.w. 08 gr. I place the numbers according to
Rule and begin, saying twenty l. oz. p.w. gr. 24 05 00 08 17 10 11 20 06 06 08
12 from eight I cannot, but borrow one penny weight which is twenty four grains,
and add them to eight and they are thirty two, wherefore I say twenty from
thirty two Rests twelve; then one that I borrowed and eleven is twelve, from 00
I cannot, but twelve from twenty (borrowing an ounce which is twenty penny
weight) and there remains eight; then one that I borrowed and ten is eleven,
from five I cannot, but eleven from seventeen and there rests six; then one
that I borrowed and seven is eight, from four I cannot but eight from fourteen
and there Rests six; then one that I borrowed and one is two from two and there
rests nothing; so that I find the Remainder or difference to be 6 l. 6 oz. 8
p.w. 12 gr.

7. It many times happens that you have many Sums or Numbers to be Subtracted
from one number; as suppose a man should lend his friend a certain Sum of
Money, and his friend had paid him part of his debt at several times, then
before you can conveniently know what is still owing you are to add the several
Numbers or Sums of Payment together, and Subtract their Sum from the whole
Debt, and the Remainder is the Sum due to the Creditor, as Suppose A lends to
B 564 l. 13 s. 10 d. and B has Repaid him 79 l. 16 s. 08 d. at one time, and
163 l. 18 s. 11 d. at another time, and 241 l. 15 s. 08 d. at another time; and
you would know how the Account stands between them, or what more is due to A.
In order whereunto I first set down the Sum which A lent, and draw a line
underneath it, then under that line set the several Sums of payment as you see
in the margent; and having brought the several l. s. d. Lent 564 13 10 paid at
several paym. 79 16 08 163 18 11 241 15 08 paid in all 485 11 03 Remains 79 02
07 Sums of payment into one Total by the 5th. Rule of the 4th. Chapter
foregoing, I find their Sum amounts to 485 l. 11 s. 3 d. which I Subtract
from the sum first lent by A by the 6th Rule of this Chapter, and I find the
Remainder to be 79 l. 02 s. 07 d. And so much is still due to A.

When the Learner has good knowledge of what has been already delivered, in
this and the foregoing Chapter, he will with ease understand the manner of
working the following Examples.

The Proof of Subtraction.
8. When your Subtraction is ended, if you desire to prove your work, whether
it be true or no, then add the remainder to the minor number, and if the
aggregate of these two be equal to the major number, then was your operation
true, otherwise false; thus let us prove the first Example of the fifth rule of
this Chapter, where after Subtraction is ended the ^ numbers stand as in the
Margent, the remainder or difference being 283676 now to prove the work, I add
the said remainder 283676 to the minor ^ number 153827, by the fourth Rule of
the foregoing Chapter, and I find the sum or aggregate to be 437503 equal to
the major number, or number from whence the lesser is Subtracted, behold the
work in the Margent.

The proof of another Example, may be of the first Example, of the sixth Rule
of this Chapter where it is required to Subtract 57 l. 16 s. 03 d. 2 qrs. from
375 l. 13 s. 07 d. qrs. and by the Rule I find the Remainder to be 317 l. 17 s.
03 d. 3 qrs. now to prove it, I add the said Remainder 317 l. 17 s. l. s. d.
qrs 375 13 07 1 57 16 03 2 317 17 03 3 375 13 07 1 03 d. 3 qrs. to the minor
number 57 l. 16 s. 03 d. 2 qrs. and their sum is 375 l. 13 s. 07 d. 1 qrs.
equal to the major number which proves the work to be true, but if it had
happened to have been either more or less than the said major number, then the
operation had been false.

9. The general effect of Subtraction is to find the difference or excess
between two numbers, and the Rest of a payment made of a greater sum, the date
of Books printed, the age of any thing by knowing the present year, and the
year wherein they were made, created or built; and such like.

The Questions appropriated to this Rule, are such as follow.

Quest. 1. What difference is there between one thing of 125 foot long and
another of 66 foot long?

To resolve this Question, I first set down the major or greater number ^ 125
and under it the minor or lesser number 66, as is directed in the third rule of
this Chapter, and according to the fourth Rule of the same, I Subtract the
minor from the major, and the Remainder, excess, or difference I find to be
59, see the work in the Margent.

Quest. 2. A Gentleman owes a Merchant 365 l. whereof he has paid 278 l. what
more does he owe?

To give an Answer to this Question, I first set down the major number, 365 l.
and under it I place 278 the minor, and subtract the one from the other, and
thereby I discover the excess, difference, or remainder to be 87, and so much
is still due to the Creditor.

Quest. 3. An obligation was written, book printed, a child born, a Church
built, or any other thing made, in the year of our Lord 1572, and now we
Account the year of our Lord 1677, The Question is to know the age of the said
things, that is how many years are passed since the said things were made; I
say if you subtract the lesser number 1572, from the greater 1677, the
Remainder will be 105* and so many years past are since the making of the said
things.

Quest. 4. There are 3 Towns lie in a straight line (viz.) London, Huntington,
and York, now the distance between the f^rthest of these towns, viz. London and
York is 151 miles, and from London to Huntington, is 49 miles, I demand how far
it is from Huntington to York.

To Resolve this Question, subtract 49 the distance between London and
Huntington, from 151 the distance between London and York, and the remainder is
102, for the true distance between Huntington and York.

CHAP. VI. Of Multiplication of whole Numbers.
1. Multiplication is performed by two numbers, of like or unlike kind, for
the production of a third, which shall have such reason to the one, as the
other has to unite, and in effect is a most brief and artificial compound
Addition of many equal numbers of like kind into one sum. Or Multiplication is
that by which we Multiply two or more numbers, the one into the other, to the
end that their product may come forth, or be discovered.

Or Multiplication is the increasing of any one number by another, so often as
there are unites in that number, by which the other is increased, or by having
two numbers given to find a third, which shall contain one of the Numbers as
many times as there are unites in the other.

2. Multiplication has three parts, first the Multiplicand, or number to be
Multiplied, Secondly, the Multipliar, or number given, by which the
multiplicand is to be multiplied, and Thirdly, the product or number produced
by the other two, the one being multiplied by the other, as if 8 were given to
be multiplied by 4, I say 4 times 8 is 32, here 8 is the multiplicand, ^ and 4
is the multipliar, and 32 is the product.

3. Multiplication is either single by one figure, or compound that consists of
many.

Single multiplication is said to consist of one figure, because the
multiplicand and multipliar consist each of them of a digit, and no more, so
that the greatest product that can arise by single multiplication is 81, being
the square of 9; and Compound multiplication is said to consist of many
figures, because the multiplicand or multipliar consist of more places than
one; as if I were to multiply 436 by 6, it is called compound, because the
multiplicand 436 is of more places than one, ( viz) 3 places.

4. The Learner ought to have all the varieties of single multiplication by
heart before he can well proceed any further in this Art, it being of most
excellent use, and none of the following Rules in Arithmetic but what have
their principal dependence thereupon, and they may be learnt by the following
Table.

Multiplication Table.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 4 8 12 16 20
24 28 32 36 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 7 14 21 28 35
42 49 56 63 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81

The use of the precedent Table is this, in the uppermost line or Collume you
have expressed all the digits from 1 to 9, and likewise beginning at 1 and
going downwards in the side-colume you have the same; so that if you would know
the product of any two single numbers multiplied by one another, look for one
of them (which you please) in the uppermost Collume, and for the other in the
side Collume, and running your eye from each figure along the respective
Collumes, in the common Angle (or place) where these two Collumes meet there is
the product required. As for Example, I would know how much is 8 times 7, first
I look for 8 in the uppermos^ Collume, and 7 in the side Collume, then do I
cast my eye from 8 along the Collume downwards from the same, and likewise from
7 in the side Collume, I cast my eye from thence toward the right hand, and
find it to meet with the first Collume at 56, so that I conclude 56 to be the
product required, it would have been the same if you had looked for 7 in the
top, and 8 on the side, the like is to be understood of any other such numbers.
The learner being perfect herein, it will be necessary to proceed.

5. In Compound Multiplication, if the Multiplicand consists of many places,
and the multipliar of but one figure; first set down the multiplicand, and
under it place the multipliar in the place of unites and draw a line underneath
them, then begin and multiply the multipliar into every particular figure of
the multiplicand, beginning at the place of units, and so proceed toward the
left hand, setting each particular product under the line, in order as you
proceed, but if any of the products exceed 10 or any number of tens, set down
the excess, and for every 10 carry a unite to be added to the next product,
always remembering to set down the Total product of the last figure; which work
being finished, the sum or number placed under the line shall be the true and
total product required. As for example, I would multiply 478 by 6, first I set
down 478, and underneath it 6 in the place ^ of units, and draw a line
underneath them as in the Margent, then I begin saying 6 times 8 is 48, which
is 8 above four tens, therefore I set down 8 (the excess) and bear 4 in mind
for the four tens, then I proceed saying 6 times 7 is 42 and 4 that I carried
is 46, I then set down 6 and carry 4, and go on saying 6 times 4 is 24, and 4
that I carried is 28, and because it is the last figure, I set it all down, and
so the work is finished, and the product is found to be 2868, as was required.

6. When in Compound Multiplication the Multipliar consists of diverse places,
then begin with the figure in the place of units in the Multipliar, and
Multiply it into all the figures of the Multiplicand, placing the product below
the line as was directed in the last Example, then begin with the figure in the
second place of the Multipliar ( viz.) the place of tens, and Multiply it
likewise into the whole Multiplicand (as you did the first figure) placing its
product, under the product of the first figure, do in the same manner by the
third, fourth, and ^^fth, etc. until you have Multiplied all the figures of the
Multipliar particularly into the whole multiplicand, still placing the product
of each particular figure under the product of its precedent figure; herein
observing the following Cau^ion.

In the placing of the product of each particular figure of the Multipliar, A
Caution.
you are not to fol^ow the 2 Rule of the fourth Chapter, viz. ^ot to place
units under units, and tens under tens, etc. but to put the figure or Cipher in
the place of Units of the second line under the second figure or place of Tens
in the line above it, and the figure or Cipher in the place of units of the
third line under the place of Tens in the second line, etc. Observing this
order till you have finished the work, viz. still placing the first figure of
every line or product under the second figure or place of Tens in that which is
above it, and having so done, draw a line under all these particular products,
and add them together; so shall the sum of all these products be the total
product Required.

As if it were Required to Multiply 764 by 27, I set them down the one under
the other with a line drawn underneath them; then I begin saying seven times
four ^ is 28, then I set down 8 and Carry 2, then say 7 times 6 is 42 and 2
that I carried is 44, that is 4 and go 4; then 7 times 7 is 49, and 4 that I
carry is 53, which I set down because I have not another figure to Multiply;
Thus have I done with the 7; then I begin with the 2 saying 2 times 4 is 8,
which I set down under the 4 the second figure or place of tens in the line
above it, as you may see in the margent; Then I proceed, saying 2 times 6 is 12
that is 2 and carry one, then two times seven is fourteen, and one that I carry
is fifteen, which I set down because it is the product of the last figure; so
that the product of 764 by 7 is 5348, and by 2 is ^528 which being placed the
one under the other as before is directed, and as you see in the margent, and a
line drawn under them, and they added together Respectively, make 20628 the
true product Required, being equal to 27 times 764.

Another Example may be this; Let it be Required to Multiply 5486 by 465, I
dispose of the Multiplicand and Multiplier according to Rule, and begin
Multiplying the first figure of the Multiplier, ^ which is five, into the whole
Multiplycand, and the product is 27430; then I proceed and Multiply the second
figure (6) of the Multiplier into the Multiplicand and find the product to
amount to 32916 which is subscribed under the other product Respectivly, then
do I Mult^ply the third and last figure (4) of the Multiplier into the
Multiplicand, and the product is 21944, which is likewise placed under the
second line Respectively; then I draw a line under the said products (being
placed the one under the other according to Rule) and add them together and the
sum is 2550990 the true product sought being equal to 5486 times 465, or 465
times 5486.

More Examples in this Rule are these following.

^

7. Although the foormer Rules are sufficient for all Cases in multiplication,
yet because in the work of multiplication many times great labor may be saved,
Si e numeris propositis unus vel uterque adjunctos habeat ad dextram circulos;
omissis circulis siat ipsorum numerorum multiplicatio, and facto demu^r tot
in^uper integrorum loci accenseanturquot sunt omissi circuli in utroque
factore. Cl^vis Math: c. 4.3.
, I shall acquaint the Learner therewith, viz. If the multiplicand or
multiplier, or both of them end with Ciphers, then in your multiplying you may
neglect the Ciphers, and multiply only the significant figures; and to the
product of those significant figures; add so many Ciphers as the Numbers given
to be multiplied did end with; that is, annex them on the Right hand of the
said product, so shall that give you the true product Required. As if I were to
multiply 32000 by 4300, I set ^ them down in order to be multiplied as you see
in the margent, but neglecting the Ciphers in both numbers, I only multiply 32
by 43 and the product I find to be 1376, to which I annex the 5 Ciphers that
are in the multiplicand and multiplier and then it makes 137600000 for the true
product of 32000 by 4300.

8. If in the multiplier, Ciphers are placed between significant figures, then
multiply only by the significant figures neglecting the ciphers, Si intermedio
multiplicantis loco circulus suerit, ille negl gitu. Alsted: Cap. 6. de Arithm.
but here special notice is to be taken of the true placing of the first figure
after the neglect of such Cipher or Ciphers, and therefore you must observe in
what place of the multiplier the figure you multiply by stands, and set the
first figure of that product under the same place of the product of the first
figure of your multiplier; As for Example, let it be Required to multiply
371568 by 40007, first I multiply the multiplicand by seven and the product is
^ 2600976, then neglecting the Ciphers, I multiply by 4 and that product is
1486272 now I consider that four is the fifth figure in the multiplier,
therefore I place two (the first figure of the Product by four) under the fifth
place of the first Product by seven, and the rest in order, and having added
them together, the total product is found to be 14865320976. other Examples in
this Rule are these following.

^

9. If you are to multiply any Number by a unit with Ciphers, ( viz.) by 10,
100* 1000, etc. Then prefix so many Ciphers before the multiplicand, and that
Numbe^ when the Ciphers are prefixed is the Pro^duct Required; as if you would
multiply 428 by 100, annex two Ciphers to 428 and it is 42800; If it were
Required t^ multiply 102 by 10000, annex 4 Cypher^ and it gives 1020000 for the
Product Required.

The Proof of Multiplication.
10. Multiplication is Proved by Division and to speak truth all other ways
are false; and therefore it will be most convenient in the first place, Neque
est quod aliam expectes examinandi viam; nam aliae vulgares and falsae sunt,
and nullo inn^xae fundamento. Gem. ^ris.
to learn Division and by that to prove Multiplication. There is a way (at this
day generally used in Schools) to Prove multiplication, which is this, first
add all the Figures in the multiplicand together, as if they were simple
Numbers, casting away the Nines as often as it comes to so much, and noting the
Remainder at last, which in this case cannot be so much as 9, Cast likewise the
Nines out of the multiplier as you did out of the multiplicand, and note that
Remainder; then multiply the Remainders the one by the other, and cast the
Nines out of that Product, observing the Remainder, and lastly, Cast the Nines
out of the total product, and if this Remainder be equal to the Remainder last
found, then they conclude the work to be Rightly performed; but there may be
given a thousand (nay infinite) false Products in a multiplication, which after
this manner may be Proved to be true, and therefore this way of Proving does
not deserve any Example; but we shall deferr the Proof of this Rule till we
come to Prove Division, and then we shall Prove them both together.

11. The general effect of Multiplication is contained in the definition of the
same which is to find out a third Number, so often containing one of the two
given Numbers as the other contains unit.

The second effect is by having the length and breadth of any thing (as a
pararellogram, or long plain) to find the superficial content of the same, and
by having the superficial content of the base and the length, to find the
solidity of any parallelepipedon, Cylinder ar other solid figures.

The third Effect is by the contents price, vallue, buying, selling, expense,
wages, exchange, simple Interest, gain, or loss of any one thing, be it Money,
Merchandise, etc. to find out the value, price, expense, buying, selling,
exchange, or Interest of any Number of things, of like Name, Nature and Kind.

The fourth Effect is (not much unlike the other (by the Contents, Vallue, or
price of one part of any thing Denominated, to find out the Content, Vallue or
Price of the whole thing, all the parts into which the whole is divided,
multiplying the price of one of those parts.

The Fifth Effect is, to aid, to compound and to ma^e (...) Rules, as chiefly
the Rule of (...), called the Golden Rule* (...) of three; also by (...) things
of (...) are reduced to another.

(...) any Number of Integers by the price of the Integer, the Product will
discover the price of the Quantity, or Number of Int^gers given.

In a R^ctangular Solid, if you multiply the bred^h of the base by the depth,
and that Product by the length, this last Product will discover the Solidity or
content of the same Solid.

Some Questions proper to this Rule may be these following.
Quest. 1. What is the content of a square piece of ground, whose length is 28
perches, and breadth 13 perches.

Answer, 364 square perches, for multiplying 28 the length, by 13 the breadth,
the Product is so much.

Quest. 2. There is a square battle whose Flank is 47 men, and the files 19
deep, what Number of men does that battle contain? Facit 893, for multiplying
47 by 19, the Product is 893.

Quest. 3. If any one thing cost 4 shillings, what shall 9 such things cost?
Answer, 36 shillings; for multiplying 4 by 9, the Product is 36.

Quest. 4. If a piece of Money or Merchandise be worth or cost 7 shillings,
what shall 19 such pieces of Money or Merchandise cost? Facit 133 shillings,
which is equal to 6 l. 13 s.

Quest. 5. If a Soldier or Servant get or spend 14 s. per month, what is the
Wages or Charges of 49 Soldiers or Servants for the same time? multiply 49 by
14 the Product is 686 s. for the Answer.

Quest. 6. If in a day there are 24 hours, how many hours are there in a year,
accounting 365 days to constitute the year? Facit 8760 hours to which if you
add the 6 hours over and above 365 days as there is in a year, then it will be
8766 hours, now if you multiply this 8766 by 60 the Number of Minutes in an
hour, it will produce 525960, for the Number of Minutes in a Year.

CHAP. VII. Of Division of whole Numbers.
1. DIVISION is the Separation, or Parting of any Number, or Quantity given,
into any parts assigned; Or to find how often one Number is Contained in
another; Or from any two Numbers given to find a third that shall consist of so
many Units, as the one of those two given Numbers is Comprehended or contained
in the other.

2. Division has three Parts, or Numbers Remarkable, viz. First the Dividend,
Secondly the Divisor, and Thirdly the Quotient. The Dividend is the Number
given to be Parted or Divided. The Divisor is the Number given, by which the
Dividend is divided; Or it is the Number which shows how many parts the
Dividend is to be divided into. And the Quotient is the Number Produced by the
Division of the two given Numbers the one by the other.

So 12 being given to be divided by 3, or into three equal parts, the Quotient
will be 4 for 3 is con^ained in 12 four times, where 12 is the Dividend; and 3
is the Divisor, and 4 is the Quotient.

3. In Division set down your Dividend, and draw a Crooked line at each end of
it, and before the line at the left hand, place the Divisor, and behind that on
the right hand, place the figures of the Quotient, as in the margent, where it
is required ^ to divide 12 by 3; First I set down 12 the Dividend, and on each
side of it do I draw a crooked line, and before that on the left hand do I
place 3 the Divisor; then do I seek how often 3 is contained in 12, and because
I find it 4 times, I put 4 behind the Crooked line on the Right hand of the
Dividend, denoting the Quotient.

4. But if the Divisor being a single Figure, the Dividend consists of two or
more places, then (having placed them for the work as is before directed) put a
point under the first Figure on the left hand of the Dividend, provided it be
bigger then, (or equal to) the Divisor, but if it be lesser then the Divisor,
then put a point under the second Figure from the left hand of the Dividend,
which Figures as far as the point goes from the left hand are to be Reckoned
by themselves, as if they had no dependence upon the other part of the
Dividend, and for distinction sake may be called the Dividual, then ask how
often the Divisor is contained in the Dividual, placing the answer in the
Quotient; then multiply the Divisor by the Figure that you placed in the
Quotient* and set the product thereof under the Dividual; then draw a line
under that product, and Subtract the said Product from the Dividual, placing
the Remainder under the said line, then put a point under the next figure in
the Dividend, on the Right hand of that which you put the point before, and
draw it down, placing it on the Right hand of the Remainder, which you found by
Subtraction; which Remainder with the said Figure annexed before it, shall be a
new dividual; then seek again how often the divisor is contained in this new
dividual, and put the Answer in the Quotient on the Right hand of the Figure
there before, then multiply the divisor by the last Figure that you put in the
Quotient, and subscribe the Product under the dividual, and make Subtraction,
and to the Remainder draw down the next Figure from the grand dividend, (having
first put a point under it) and put it on the right hand of the Remainder for a
new dividual as before, etc.

Observing this general Rule in all kind of Division, first to seek how often
the divisor is contained in the dividual; then (having put the answer in the
quotient) multiply the Divisor thereby, and Subtract the Product from the
dividual. An Example or two will make the Rule plain. Let it be Required to
divide 2184 by 6, I dispose of the Numbers given as is before directed, and as
you see in the margent, in order to the work, then (because 6 the ^ divisor is
more then 2 the first Figure of the dividend) I put a point under 1 the second
Figure, which make the 21 for the Dividual, then do I ask how often 6 the ^
divisor, is contained in 21 and because I cannot have it more then 3 times, I
put 3 in the Quotient, and thereby do I multiply the divisor 6 and the product
is 18, which I set in order under the dividual, and Subtract it therefrom, and
the Remainder (3) I place in order under the line as you see in the Margent.

Then do I make a point under the next Figure of the dividend being 8, and draw
it down, placing it before the ^ Remainder 3, So have I 38 for a new dividual,
then do I seek how often 6 is contained in 38, and because I cannot have more
than 6 times, I put 6 in the quotient, and thereby do I multiply the divisor 6,
and the product (36) I put under the dividual (38) and Subtract it therefrom,
and the remainder 2 I put under the line as you see in the Margent.

Then do I put a point under the next (and last) Figure of the dividend ^
(being 4) and draw it down to the remainder 2, and putting it on the Right hand
thereof it makes 24 for a new dividual; then I seek how often 6 is contained in
24, and the Answer is 4, which I put in the quotient, and multiply the divisor
(6) thereby and the product (24) I put under the dividual, and Subtract it from
it, and the Remainder is 0, and thus the work is finished, and I find the
quotient to be 364, that is, 6 is contained in 2184 just 364 times, or 2184
being divided into 6 equal parts, 364 is one of those parts.

If it were Required to divide 2646 by 7 or into 7 equal parts, the quotient
would be found to be 378, as by the following operation appears.

^

So if it were Required to divide 946 by 8, the Quotient will be found to be
118 and 2 (...) after Division is ended. The work follows.

^

Many times the dividend cannot exactly be divided by the divisor, but
something will Remain, as in the last Example; where 946 was given to be
divided by 8, the quotient was 118 and there Remains 2 after the division is
ended; Now what is to be done in this case with the Remainder, the Learner
shall be taught when we come to treat of the Reducing, or Reduction of
Fractions.

And here Note, that if after your Division is ended, any thing do Remain, it
must be lesser then your divisor, for otherwise your work is not Rightly
performed.

Other Examples are such as follow.
^

5. But if the divisor consists of more place then one, then choose so many
Figures from the left side of the dividend for a dividual, as there are Figures
in the divisor, and put a point under the farthest Figure of that dividual to
the Right hand, and seek how often the first Figure on the Left side of the
divisor, is contained in the first Figure on the Left side of the dividual, and
place the Answer in the quotient, and thereby multiply your divisor, placing the
product under your dividual, and Subtract it therefrom, placing the Remainder
below the line; then put a point under the next Figure in the dividend, and
draw it down to the said Remainder, and annex it on the Right side thereof,
which makes a new dividual, and proceed as before, etc.

And if it so happen that after you have chosen your first dividual (as is
before directed) you find it to be lesser then the divisor, then put a point
under a Figure more, nearer to the Right hand, and seek how often the first
Figure on the Left side of the divisor, is contained in the two first Figures
on the Left side of the dividual, and place the answer in the quotient, by
which multiply the divisor and place the product thereof in order under the
dividual, and Subtract it therefrom, and proceed etc.

Always remembering, that (in all the cases of division) if after you have
multiplied your divisor by the Figure last placed in the quotient, the product
be greater then the dividual, then you must cansel that Figure in the quotient,
and instead thereof put a Figure lesser by a unit (or one) and multiply the
divisor thereby, and if still the product be greater then the dividual, make
the Figure in the quotient yet lesser by a unit, and thus do until your
product be lesser then the dividual, or at the most equal thereto, and then
make Subtraction, etc.

So if you would divide 9464 by 24, the quotient will be found to be 394, I
first put down the given Numbers as before is directed, now because my divisor
consists of two Figures, I therefore ^ put a point under the second Figure
from the Left hand in my dividend, which here is under four, wherefore I seek
how often two the first figure (on the Left side of the divisor) is contained
in nine (the like first in the dividual) the answer is four, which I put in the
quotient and thereby multiply all the divisor and find the product to be ninety
six, which is greater than the dividual ninety four, wherefore I cancel the
four in the quotient, and instead thereof I put three (a unit lesser) and by it
I multiply the divisor twenty four, and the product is seventy two, which I
Subtract from ninety four the dividual, and the Remainder is twenty two, then
do I make a point under the next Figure six in the dividend, and draw it down
and place it on the Right side of the Remainder twenty two, and ^ it makes 226
for a new dividual, now because the dividual 226 consists of a Figure more
then the divisor, therefore I seek how often 2 (the first Figure of the
divisor) is contained in 22 (the two first of the dividual) I say nine times,
wherefore I put nine in the quotient, and thereby multiply the divisor 24, the
product 216 I place under the dividual 226, and Subtract it from it, and there
Remains 10.

Then I go on and make a point under the next and last Figure (4) in the
dividend, and pull it down to the Remainder 10, and it makes 104, for a new
dividual, which is also a Figure more then the divisor, and therefore I seek
how often two is contained in ten, I answer five, but multiplying my divisor by
five, the product is 120, which is greater then the divisor, ^ and therefore I
make it but four, and by it multiply the divisor, and the product is 96 which
being placed under, and Subtracted from the Dividual, there Remains 8, and
thus the whole work of this Division is ended, and I find that 9464 divided by
24, or into 24 equal parts the Quotient, or one of those equal parts, is found
to be 394 as was said before, and there Remains 8.

Another Example may be this, let there be Required the quotient of 1183653
divided by 385, first I dispose of the Numbers in order to their dividing, and
because 118 the three first Figures of the dividend is lesser than the divisor,
I therefore make a point under the fourth Figure, which is 3, and seek how
often 3 ^ is contained in 11? the answer is (3) which I put in the quotient,
and thereby multiply the divisor, and the Product is 1155 which I subtract from
the dividual 1188 and there Remains 28. Then ^ (as before) I pull down the
next Figure, which is six, and place it before the Remainder 28, so have I 286
for a new dividual, and because it has no more Figures than the divisor I seek
how often 3 (the first Figure in the divisor) is contained in 2 (the first
Figure of the dividual) and the answer is 0, for a greater Number cannot be
contained in a lesser, wherefore I put 0 in the the quotient and thereby
(according to Rule) I should multiply my Divisor, but if I do the product will
be 0, and 0 Subtracted from the dividual 286 the remainder is the same;
wherefore I pull down the next figure (5) from the dividend ^ and put it before
the said Remainder 286 so have I 2865 for a new dividual, and because it
consists of four places ( viz.) a place more than the divisor, I seek how
often 3 (the first Figure of the divisor) is contained in 28 (the two first of
the dividual) and I say there is 9 times 3 in 28, but multiplying my whole
divisor (385) thereby I find the product to be 3465, which is greater than the
dividual 2865, wherefore I choose eight which is lesser by a Unit than nine,
and thereby I multiply my divisor 385, and the product is 3080, which still is
greater then the said dividual, wherefore I choose another Number yet a Unit
lesser, viz. 7; and having multiplied my divisor thereby the product is 2695
lesser than the dividual 2865, wherefore I put seven in the quotient, and
Subtract 2695 from the dividual 2865, and there remains 170, then I pull down
the last figure 3 in the dividend and place it before the said Remainder 170,
and it makes 1703 for a new dividual, then (for the reason abov-said) ^ I seek
how often three is contained in 17, the answer is 5, but multiplying the
divisor thereby, the product is 1925 greater than the dividual, wherefore I say
it will bear four, a Unit lesser, and by it I multiply the divisor 385, and the
product is 1540, which is lesser than the dividual, and therefore I put four in
the quotient, and Subtract the said product from the dividual* and there
Remains 163, and thus the work is finished, and I find that 1183653 being
divided by 385, or into 385 equal shares or parts, the Quotient or one of those
parts is 3074, and besides there is 163 Remaining.

And thus the Learner being well versed in the method of the foregoing
Examples, he may be sufficiently quallified for the dividing of any greater
sum or number into as many parts as he pleases, that is, he may understand
the method of dividing by a Divisor consisting of 4 or 5 or 6 or any greater
number of places, the method being the same with the foregoing Examples in
every Respect.

Other Examples of Division.
^

So if you divide 47386473 by 58736 you will find the Quotient to be 806, and
45257 will Remain after the work is ended.

In like manner if you would Divide 3846739204 by 483064, the Quotient will be
7963 and the Remainder after Division will be 100572.

Compendiums in Division.
1. IF any given Number be to be Divided by another Number that has Ciphers
prefixed on the Right side thereof, (omitting the Ciphers) you may cut off so
many Figures from the Right hand of the Dividend, Et si Divisor adjunctos sibi
habeat Circulos ad dextram, omissis circulis and abseissis totidem ultimis
figuris dividendi, in numeris Reliquis fiat divisio in fine autem divisionis
Restituendi sunt tum omissi circuli, tum figurae abscissae. Ough^. Cla. Math.
Cap. 5.3.
as there are Ciphers before the Divisor, and let the Remaining numbers in the
Dividend, be divided by the Remaining number or numbers in the Divisor;
observing this Caution, that if after your Division is ended, any thing Remain;
you are to prefix the number or numbers that were cut off from the Dividend
before the Numbers Remaining; and such new found Number shall be the Remainder.
As for Example; Let it be Required to divide 46658 by 400 now because ^ there
are two ciphers before the divisor, I cut off as many Figures from before the
Dividend, viz. 58, so that then there will Remain only 466 to be divided by 4,
and the Quotient will be 116, and there will Remain 2, before which I prefix
the two Figures (58) which were cut off from the Dividend and it makes 258 for
the True Remainder, so that I conclude 46658 divided by 400 the Quotient will
be 116, and 258 Remains after the work is ended; as by the work in the
Margent.

2. And hence it follows that if the divisor be (1) or a unite with Ciphers
prefixed, you may cut off so many figures from before the dividend, Divisurus
quemcunque numerum per 10, Aufer ex dextera part unicam, eamque primam
figuram; Reliquae enim figurae productum ostendunt; ablatum Residuum, etc. Gem.
Fris. Arith. par. 1.
as there are Ciphers in the divisor, and then the figure or figures that are
on the left hand, will be the Quotient, and those on the right hand will be the
Remainder, after the Division is ended: as thus, if 45783 were to be divided by
10, I cut off the last figure (3) with a dash thus (45783) and the work is
done, and the quotient is 4578 (the number on the left hand of the dash,) and
the Remainder is 3 (on the right hand,) In like manner if the same Number 45783
were to be divided by 100, I cut off 2 figures from the end thus (45783) and
the quotient is 457, and the remainder 83. And if I were to divide the same by
1000, I cut off 3 figures from the end thus (45783) and the quotient is 45, and
783 the Remainder, etc.

6. The General effect of Division is contained in the definition of the same,
(th^^ is) by having two unequal numbers given to find a third number in such
proportion to the dividend, as the divisor has to unite, or 1, It also
discovers what reason, or proportion there is between numbers, so if you divide
12 by 4 it quotes 3, which shows the reason, or proportion of 4 to 12 is triple.

The second effect is by the superficial measure or content, and the length of
any oblonge, Rectangular paralelogram, or square plane known, to find out the
breadth thereby; or contrariwise by having the superficies, and breadth of the
said figure, to find out the length thereof. Also by having the solidity and
length of a solid to find the superficies of the base, and Contra.

The third effect is, by the contents, Reason, price, vallue, buying, selling,
expenses, wages, exchange, interest, profit, or loss of any things (be it
Money, Merchandise, or what else) to find out the contents, reason, price,
value, buying, selling expense, wages, exchange, interest, profit, or loss, of
any one thing of like kind.

The fourth effect is to aid, to compose, and to make other Rules, but
principally the Rule of proportion, called the Golden Rule, or Rule of three;
and the Reduction of Moneys, weight and measure, of one denomination into
another, by ^t also fractions are abbreviated by finding a common measurer,
unto the numerator and denominator, thereby discovering commensurable numbers.

If you Divide the value of any certain quantity by the same quantity, the
Quotient (...) the Rate or value of ^he Integer, as (...) eight yards of Cloth
cost 96 shillings, here if you divide (96) the value, or price of the given
quantity by (8) the same quantity, the Quotient will be 12 s, which is the
value or price of 1 of those yards, and contra.

If you divide the value, or price of any unknown quantity, by the value of the
Integer, it gives you in the quotient that unknown quantity, whose price is
thus divided; as if 12 shillings were the value of 1 yard, I would know how
many yards are worth 96 shillings, here if you divide (96) the price or value
of the unknown quantity, by (12) the rate of the Integer, or one yard, the
quotient will be 8, which is the number of yards worth 96 shillings.

Some Questions answered by Division may be these following.
Quest. 1. If 22 things cost 66 shillings, what will 1 such like thing cost?
facit 3 shillings, for if you divide 66 by 22 the Quotient is 3 for the Answer;
so if 36 yards or else of any thing be bought or sold for 108 l. how much shall
1 yard or ell be bought or sold for? facit 3 l. for if you divide 108 l. by 36
yards the Quotient will be 3 l. the price of the Integer.

Quest. 2. If the expense, charges, or wages of 7 years amounts to 868 l. what
is the expense, charges, or wages of one year? facit 124 l. for if you divide
868 (the wages of 7 years,) by 7 (the number of years) the Quotient will be 124
l. for the Answer, see the work.

^

Quest. 3. If the content of a superficial foot be 144 Inches, and the breadth
of a board be 9 Inches, how many Inches of that board in length will make such
a foot? facit 16 Inches; for by dividing 144 (the number of square Inches in a
square foot,) by 9 (the Inches in the breadth of the board) the Quotient is 16
for the number of Inches in length of that board, to make a superficial foot.

^

Quest. 3. If the content of an Acre of Ground be 160 square Perches, and the
length of a furlong (propounded) be 80 Perches, how many Perches will there go
in breadth to make an Acre, facit 2 Perches for if you divide 160 (the number of
Perches in an Acre) by 80 (the length of the furlong in Perches) the Quotient
is 2 Perches; and so many in breadth of that furlong will make an Acre.

^

Quest. 5. If there be 893 men to be made up into a battle, the front consists
of 47 men, what Number must there be in the File? Facit 19 deep in the File:
For if you divide 893 (the Number of men) by 47 (the number in front) the
Quotient will be 19 the file in depth, the work follows.

^

Quest. 6. There is a Table whose Superficial Content is 72 feet, and the
breadth of it at the end is 3 feet, now I demand what is the Length of this
Table? Facit 24 feet long; for if you divide 72 (the content of the Table in
feet) by 3 (the breadth of it) the Quotient is 24 feet for the length thereof
which was Required. See the operation as follows.

^

The proof of Multiplication and Division.
Multiplication and Division Interchangably prove each other; for if you would
prove a sum in Division, whether the operation be Right or no, Multiply the
Quotient by the Divisor; and if any thing Remain after the Division was ended,
add it to the Product, which Product (if your sum was Rightly divided) will
be equal to the Dividend; And Contrariwise if you would prove a sum in
Multiplication, divide the Product by the Multipliar, and if the work was
Rightly performed, the Quotient will be equal to the Multiplicand. See the
Example where the work is done and undone; Let 7654 be given to be Multiplied
by 3242, the product will be 24814268 as by the work appears.

^

And then if you Divide the said Product 24814268 by 3242 the Multipliar, the
Quotient will be 7654 equal to the given Multiplicand.

^

In like manner (to prove a Sum or Number in Division) If 24814268 were
Divided by 3242 the Quotient would be found to be 7654; then for proof, if you
Multiply 7654 the Quotient by 3242 the Divisor, the Product will amount to
24814268, equal to the Dividend.

Or you may prove the last or any other Example in Multiplication thus, viz.
Divide the Product by the Multiplicand, and the Quotient will be equal to the
Multipliar see the work.

^

From whence arises this Corollary, that any operation in Division may be
proved by Division; for if after your Division is ended, you divide the
Dividend by the Quotient, the new Quotient thence ariseing will be equal to the
Divisor of the first operation; for Trial whereof let the last Example be again
Repeated.

^

For proof whereof divide again 24814268 by the Quotient 7654, and the Quotient
thence will be equal to the first Divisor 3242 see the work.

^

But in proving Division by Division, the Learner is to observe this following
Caution, that if after his Division is ended there be any Remainder, before you
go about to prove your work, Subtract that Remainder out of your Dividend, and
then work as before, as in the following Example, where it is Required to
divide 43876 by 765, the Quotient here is 57 and the Remainder is 271; See the
work following.

^

Now to prove this work Subtract the Remainder 271 out of the Dividend 43876
and there Remains 43605 for a new Dividend to be divided by the former
Quotient 57, and the Quotient thence arising is 765 equal to the given Divisor,
which proves the operation to be Right.

Thus have we gone through the four Species of Arithmetic, viz. Addition, Hae
sunt igitur quatuor illae species arithmetices per qua^ omnia quaecunque
deinceps dicenda sunt vel quae per numeros fier^ possbile est, absolvantur.
Quare ea^, quisquises, ante omnia perdisces. Gem. Fris. Arith. par. 1.
Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division; upon which all the following Rules
and all other operations whatsoever that are possible to be wrought by numbers
have their Immediate dependence, and by them are Resolved. Therefore before the
Learner make a further step in this Art, let him be well acquainted with what
has been delivered in the foregoing Chapters.

CHAP. VIII. Of Reduction.
1. REDUCTION, is that which brings together 2 or more numbers of different
denominations, into one denomination; or it serves to change or alter Numbers,
Hills Arith. Chapter 13.152.
Money, Weight, Measure, or Time, from one Denomination to another; and
likewise to abridge fractions to their lowest Terms. All which it does so
precisely, that the first Proportion Remains without the least jot of Error
or Wrong Committed. So that it belongs as well to Fractions as Integers, of
which in its proper place. Reduction is generally performed, either by
Multiplication or Division; from whence we may gather, that

2, Reduction is either Descending or Ascending.

3. Reduction Descending, is when it is Required to Reduce a Sum or Number of a
greater Denomination, into a lesser; which Number, when it is so reduced, shall
be equal in value to the Number first given in the greater Denomination; as if
it were Required to know how many shillings, Wing. Arith. Chapter 7.2, 3, 4.
pence or farthings are equal in value to a hundred pounds? or how many ounces
are contained in 45 hundred weight; or how many days, hours, or minutes, there
are in 240 Years, etc. And this kind of Reduction is generally performed by
Multiplication.

4. Reduction Ascending, is when it is Required to Reduce or bring a Sum or
Number of a smaller Denomination into a Greater, which shall be equivalent to
the given number; As suppose it were Required to find out how many Pence,
Shillings or Pounds, are equal in value to 43785 Farthings; or how many
Hundreds are equal to (or in) 3748 l. pounds, etc. and this kind of Reduction
is always performed by Division.

5. When any Sum or Number is given to be Reduced into another Denomination,
you are to consider whether it ought to be Resolved by the Rule Descending or
Ascending, viz. by Multiplication or Division; If it be to be performed by
Multiplication, consider how many parts of the denomination into which you
would Reduce it, are contained in a Unit or Integer of the given Number, and
multiply the said given Number thereby, and the Product thereof will be the
Answer to the Question. As if the Question were, in 438 l. pounds how many
shillings? here I consider that in one pound are 20 shillings, and that the
number of shillings in 38 l. pounds will be 20 times 38 wherefore I multiply 38
l. by 20, and that product is 760, and so many shillings are contained in 38
pounds.

But when there is a Denomination, or Denominations between the Number given
and the Number Required, you may (if you please) Reduce it into the next
inferior Denomination, and then into the next lower than that, etc. until you
have brought it into the denomination Required; As for Example, let it be
demanded in 132 pounds, how many Farthings? ^ First I multiply 132 (the Number
of pounds given) by 20 to bring it into shillings, and it makes 2643 shillings,
then do I Multiply the shillings (2640) by 12, to bring them into pence, and it
produces 31680, and so many pence are contained in 2640 shillings, or 132
pounds; then do I Multiply the pence, viz. 31680 by 4 to bring them into
Farthings (because 4 farthings is a penny) and I find the product thereof to be
126720, and so many farthings are in equal value to 132 pounds, the work is
manifest in the Margent.

And if the number propounded to be Reduced, is to be divided, or wrought by
the Rule Ascending; consider how many of the given numbers are equal to an Unit
or Integer in that denomination to which you would reduce your given number,
and make that your divisor, and the given number your dividend; and the
Quotient thence arising will be the number sought or required; As for Example,
Let it be Required to Reduce 2640 shillings into ^ pounds; here I consider that
20 shillings are equal to one pound, wherefore I divide 2640 (the given number)
by 20, and the Quotient is 132 and so many pounds are contained in 2640
shillings. In Reduction descending and ascending the Learner is advised to take
particular notice of the Tables delivered in the second Chapter of this Book,
where he may be informed what Multipliars, or Divisors to make use of in the
reducing of any number to any other denomination whatsoever, Especially English
Moneys, Weights, Measures, Time and Motion, but in this place it is not
convenient to meddle with Foreign Coins, Weights or Measures.

But if in Reduction Ascending it happen that there is a denomination, or
denominations between the number given and the number Required, then you may
Reduce your number given into the next Superior denomination, and when it is
so Reduced, bring it into the next above that, and so on until you have brought
it into the Denomination Required. As for Example,

Let it be demanded in 126720 farthings, how many pounds? First I divide my
given number (being farthings) by 4, to bring them into pence, (because 4
farthings make one penny) and they are 31680 pence, then I divide 31680 pence by
12, and the Quotient gives 2640 shillings, and then I divide 2640 shillings by
20, and the Quotient gives 132 pounds, which are equal in value to 126720
farthings. See the whole work as it follows.

^

6. When the number given to be Reduced, consists of diverse denominations, as
pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings; or of hundreds, quarters, pounds, and
ounces, etc. then you are to Reduce the highest (or greatest) denomination into
the next Inferior, and add thereunto the number standing in that denomination
which your greatest or highest number is Reduced to; then Reduce that Sum into
the next Inferior denomination, adding thereto the number standing in that
denomination; do so until you have brought the number given into the
denomination proposed. As if it were Required to Reduce 48 l. 13 s. 10 d. into
pence, first I bring 48 l. into shillings, by multiplying it by 20 and the
product is 960 shillings, to which I add the 13 shillings and they make 973,
then I multiply 973 by 12, to bring the shillings into pence, and they make
11676 pence, to which I add the 10 pence, and they make 11686 pence for the
Answer, see the whole work done ^

7. If (in Reduction Ascending) after Division is ended, any thing Remain, such
Remainder is of the same denomination with the Dividend.

Examples in Reduction of Coin.
Quest. 1. In 438 l. how many shillings? Facit 8760 shillings, for Multiplying
438 by twenty, the Product amounts to so much.

^

Quest. 2. In 467 l. how many pence? First multiply the given number of pounds
467 by 20, to bring it into shillings, and it makes 9340 shillings, then
multiply the shillings by 12 and it produces 112080 pence, thus ^ Or it may be
Resolved thus, viz. multiply the given number of pounds 467, by 240 the Number
of Pence in a Pound, and the Product is the same, viz. 112080 pence, ^

Quest. 3. In 5673, l. how many Farthings? First Multiply the given Number by
20 to bring it into shillings, and it produces 113460, then multiply that
product by 12 to bring it into pence, and it produces 1361520; then lastly,
Mult^ply the pence by 4, and it produces 5446080 farthings. See the operation.

^

Or this Question might have been thus Resolved, viz. Multiply 5673 the given
Number of pounds by 960 the Number of farthings in a pound, and it produces
the same Effect.

^

Otherwise thus, First bring the given Number 5673 l. into shillings, and
multiply the shillings by 48, the Number of Farthings in a shilling, and the
same effect is thereby likewise produced, viz. ^

These various ways of Operating are expressed to Inform the Judgment of the
Learner with the Reason of the Rule; more ways may be shown, but these are
sufficient even for the meanest capacities.

Quest. 4. In 458 l. 16 s. 07 d. 3 qrs. how many farthings? To Resolve this
question consider the 6 Rule of this Chapter, and work as you are there
directed, and you will find the aforesaid given number to amount to 440479
farthings, viz. ^

This last Question (or any other of this kind, viz. where the number given to
be Reduced consists of several denominations) may be more concisely Resolved
thus viz. when you multiply the pounds by 20 to bring them into shillings, to
the product of the first Figure, add the Figure standing in the place of Units
in the denomination of shillings, but because the first Figure in the
Multipliar is (0) I say 0 times 8 is nothing, but 6 is 6, which I put down for
the first Figure in the product, then because this Multipliar is 0, I go on no
further with it, for if I should, the whole product would be 0, but proceed,
and when I come to multiply by the second Figure in the multipliar, to the
Product of it, and the first Figure of the Multiplicand, I add the Figure
standing in the place of tens in the denomination of shillings, which is (1)
saying 2 times 8 is 16 and (the said Figure) 1 is 17, then I set down 7 and
carry a Unit to the product of the next Figure as is directed in the 5 Rule of
the 6 Chapter foregoing; and finish the work. So that you now have the whole
product and sum of shillings at one operation; and when you multiply the
shillings by 12 to bring them into pence, after the same manner add to the
product, the number standing in the denomination of pence, and so when you
multiply the pence by four to bring them into Farthings, add to the product the
number standing under the denomination of Farthings, see the last Question thus
wrought.

^

After the method last prescribed (which if Rightly considered, differs not
any thing from the sixth Rule of this Chapter) are all the following Examples
that are of the same Nature wrought and Resolved.

Quest. 5. In 4375866 farthings I demand how many Pounds, Shillings, Pence and
Farthings.

To Resolve this Question, first I divide the given number of Farthings by 4,
and the Quotient is 1093966 pence, and there Remains 2 after the Division is
ended, which (by the Seventh Rule foregoing) is two Farthings; then I divide
1093966 pence by 12, and the quotient is 91163 shillings, and there Remains
10 after division which by the said 7th Rule is so many Pence, viz. 10 d. then
I divide 91163 shillings by 20, and the Quotient is 4558 l. and there Remains
3 shillings; so the work is finished, and I find that in 4375866 farthings
there are 4558 l. 03 s. 10 d. 2 qrs. See the Operation.

^

Quest. 6. In 4386 l. I demand how many Groats?

To Resolve this Question, I Reduce the given number of pounds into shillings,
and they are 87720 shillings, now I consider that in a shilling are 3 Groats,
therefore I multiply the shillings by 3, and it produces 263160 Groats; See
the work.

^

This Question might have been otherwise Resolved thus, viz. considering that
in a pound (or 20 shillings) there are three times 20 Groats which makes 60, by
which I multiply the number of pounds given, and it produces the same effect
at one operation as follows.

^

Quest. 7. In 43758 three pences I desire to know many pounds?

To Resolve this (many such like) Question, first I divide my given number of 3
pences by 4 because 4 three pences are in a shilling, and the Quotient is 10939
shillings; and there Remains 2 after division is ended, which is 2 three
pences (by the seventh Rule of this Chapter) which are equal in value to 6 d.
then I divide 10939 shillings by 20, and the quote gives 546 l. and 19
shillings Remain; so that I conclude in 43758 pieces of three pence per piece,
there are 546 l. 19 s. 06 d. as by the work appears.

^

This question might have been otherwise

This question might have been otherwise Resolved thus, viz. first multiply the
given number of three pences 43758, by 3 the number of pence in three pence,
and the product viz. 131274 is the number of pence equal to the given number of
three pences, which number of pence may be brought into pounds by divid^ng by
12 and by 20, and the quotient you will find to be equal to the former work,
viz. 546 l. 19 s. 06 d.

^

Or thus, divide the given number of 3 pences by the number of 3 pences in 1 l.
or 20 shillings (which you will find to be 80 if you multiply 20 s. by 4, the
number of three pences in a shilling) and you will find the quote to be 546 l.
as before, and a Remainder of 78 three pences, and if you divide those 78 three
pences by 4, you will find the quote to be 19 s. and 2 three pences Remain,
which are equal to 6 d.

^

Quest. 8. In 4785 l. 13 s. how many pieces of 13 d. 1/^ per piece?

This Question cannot be Resolved by Reduction, descending, or ascending,
absolutely, (because 13 d. 1/^ is no even part of a pound) but rather by them
both (...) viz. by Multiplication and Division; for if you bring the number
given into half pence, and divide the half pence by the half pence in 13 d.
viz. 27, the quotient will be the Answer; for having brought 4785 l. 13 s. into
half pence, I find it makes 2297112, which I divide by 27, because there are so
many half pence in 13 d. and the quote gives 85078 pieces of 13 d. and 6
halfpence Remain over and above, observe the work following.

^

It would have produced the same answer if you had Reduced your given number
into farthings, and divided by the farthings in 13 d. viz. 54, (for always the
dividend and the Divisor must be of one denomination) and then you would have
had a Remainder of 12 farthings which are equal in vallue to the former
Remainder of 6 halfpence.

Quest. 9. In 540 Dollars at 4 s. 4 d. per dollar, how many pounds sterling.

First bring your given number of Dollars into Pence, and then your pence into
Pounds according to the former directions. Thus in 4 s. 4 d. (viz. a dollar)
you will find 52 pence, by which multiply 540 dollars, and it produces 28080
pence, which if you divide by 240 (the pence in one pound) the quotient will
give you 117 l. which are equal in value to 540 dollars at 4 s. 4 d. per
dollar; observe the operation.

^

The foregoing question might have been otherwise wrought, thus, viz. Multiply
your given number of dollars by 13 the number of groats in a dollar, or 4 s. 4
d. and it produces 7020 groates, which divide by 60 (the groats in one pound
or twenty shillings) and the quote is 117 l. as before.

^

Quest. 10. In 547386 pieces of 4 d. per piece, I demand how many Pounds,
Shillings, and Pence.

First bring your given number of four pence half pen^es all into half pence,
which you will do if you multiply by 9 the number of halfpence in 4 d., and
the product is 4926474 halfpence, which are brought into pounds if you divide
them by 24 (the halfpence in a shilling) and 20 (the shillings in a pound, and
it makes 10263 l. 09 s. 9 d. as by the work.

^

Quest. 11. In 4386 l. I demand how many pieces of 6 d of 4 d. and of 2 d. of
each an equal Number; that is to say, what Number of Six-pences, Groats, and
two Pences, will make up 4386 l. and the Number of each equal.

The way to Resolve questions of this nature is to add the several pieces (into
which the given Number is to be brought) into one sum and to Reduce the given
Number into the same denomination with their Sum, and to divide the said given
Number (so Reduced) by their Sum, and the Quotient will give you the exact
number of each piece. And after the same method will we proceed to Resolve the
present Question, viz. ^

So that I conclude by the operation that 87720 six-pences, and 87720 groats,
and 87720 two-pences are Just as much as, (or equal to) 4386 l. or if you admit
of 5 s, to be thus divided, it is equal to 5 six pences, and 5 four pences or
groats, and 5 two pences. For if two Right lines (or two Numbers) be given, and
one of them be divided into as many Parts, or Segments as you please, the
Rectangle, (or Product) comprehended under the two whole Right lines, (or
Numbers given) shall be equal to all the Rectangles (or Products) contained
under the whole line (or Number) and the several Segments, (or Parts) into
which the other line (or Number) is divided, Eucl. 2.1.

Another Question of the same Nature with the last may be this following, viz.

Quest. 12. A Merchant is desirous to Change 148 l. into pieces of 13 d., of 12
d. of 9 d. of 6 d. and of 4 d.; and he will have of each sort an equal Number
of pieces, I desire to know the Number?

Do as you were taught in the last question, viz. add the several pieces
together, and Reduce it into half pence, then Reduce the sum to be changed,
viz. 148 l. into the same denomination, and divide the greater by the lesser,
and in the Quotient you will find the Answer, viz. 798 is the Number of each of
the pieces Required and ^8 does Remain, as by the following work appears.

^

The truth of the 2 foregoing operations will thus be proved, viz. mult^ply the
Answer by the parts, or pieces into which the given Number was Reduced, and
^aving added the several products together, If the^r sum be equal to the
given Number, the Answer is Right, otherwise not.

So the Answer to the 11 Question was 87720, which is proved as follows, viz.
l. 87720 Six-pences make 2193 Four-pences make 1462 Two-pences make 731

The total Sum of them 4386 which was the Sum given to be Changed.

The Answer to the 12th question was 798, and 18 half-p^nce Remained after the
work was ended, now the truth of the work may be proved as the former was, viz.
d. l. s. d. 798 Pieces of 13 1/^ make 44 17 09 Pieces of 12 make 39 18 00
Pieces of 9 make 29 18 06 Pieces of 6 make 19 19 00 Pieces of 4 make 13 06 00
and 18 halfpence or 9 d. rem. 00 00 09 The total Sum of them 148 00 00 which
Total Sum is equal to the Number that was first given to be changed, and
therefore the operation was Rightly performed.

Reduction of Troy weight.
We come now to give the Learner some Examples in Troy weight, wherein we shall
be brief, having given so large a Taste of Reduction in the foregoing Examples
of Coin, and now the Learner must be mindful of the Table of Troy weight
delivered in the second Chapter of this Book.

Quest. 13. In 482 l. 07 oz. 13 p.w. 21 gr. how many Grains?

Multiply by 12^ by 20, and by 24, taking in the Figures standing ^n the
several denominations, according to the direction given in the 6 Rule of this
Chapter, and you will find the Product to be 2780013 Grains, which is the
Number Required, or Answer to the Question.

^

Quest. 14. In 2780013 grains I demand how many pounds, ounces, penny weights,
and grains?

This is but the foregoing question Inverted, and is Resolved by dividing by
24, by 20, and by 12, and the Answer is 482 l. 07 oz. 13 p.w. 21 gr.

^

Quest. 15. A Merchant sent to a Goldsm^th 1^ Ingots of S^lver, each co^taining
in weight 2 l. 4 ^z. and ordered it to be made into Bowls of 2 l. 8 oz. per
bowl, and Tankards of 1 l. 6 oz. per piece, and Salts of 10 oz. 10 p.w. per
Salt, and Spoons of 1 oz. 18 p.w. per Spoon; of each an equal Number I desire
to know how many of each sort he must make?

This Question is of the same Nature with the 11 and 12 Questions foregoing,
and may be answered after the same method viz. First add the weight of the
several vessels (into which the silver is to be made) into one sum, and Reduce
it to one denomination, and they make 1248 penny weights then Reduce the weight
of the Ingot into the same denomination, viz. penny weights, (and it makes 560
penny weights) and multiply them by the Number of Ingots, viz. 16, and the
product will give you the weight of the 16 Ingots, viz. 8960, then divide this
Product by the weight of the vessels, viz. 1248, and the quotient gives you
the Answer to the question, viz. 7, and 224 p.w. remaining over and above.

^

The Proof of the work is as follows, Viz.
l. oz. p.w. l. oz. p.w. 7 Bowls of 2 08 00 per bowl is 18 08 00 Tank. of 1 06
00 per tank. is 10 06 00 Salts of 0 10 10 per salt is 06 01 10 Spoons of 0 01
18 per spoon is 01 00 06 224 penny weight Remaining is 00 11 04 Total Sum 37 03
00

So that you see the Sum of the weights of each vessel together with the
Remainder is 37 l. 03 oz. which is equal to the weight of the 16 Ingots
delivered.

Reduction of Averdupois Weight.
In Reducing Averdupois weight, the Learner must have Recourse to the Table of
Averdupois weight delivered in the second Chapter foregoing.

Quest. 16. In 47 C. 1 qrs. 20 l. how many ounces?

Multiply by 4 by 28 and by 16, and the last product will be the Answer, viz.
84990 ounces.

^

Quest. 17 In 84992 ounces I demand ho^ many C. qrs. l. and ounces?

This is ^he foregoing Question Inverted, and will be Re^olved if you divide by
16, by 28, and by 4, and the Answer 47 C. 1 qrs. 20 l. equal to the given
number in the foregoing question.

^

Quest. 18. A Chapman buyeth of a Grocer 4 C. 1 qrs. 14 l. of Pepper, and
ordered it to be made up into parcels of 14 l. of 12 l. of 8 l. of 6 l. and of
2 l. and of each parcel an equal Number now I would know the Number of each
parcel.

This Example is of the same nature with the 11. and 12, and 15 questions
foregoing and after the same manner is Resolved, see the operation as follows.

^

Reduction of Liquid Measure.
Quest. 19. In 45 Tun of wine, how many Gallons.

Multiply by 4, and by 63, the product is 11340 Gallons for the Answer*

^

Quest. 20. In 34 Rundlets of wine each containing 18 Gallons, I demand how
many Hogsheads?

First find how many Gallons is in the 34 Rundlets, which you may do if you
multiply 34 by 18 the content of a Rundlet and the Product is 612 Gallons,
which you may Reduce into Hogsheads if you divide them by 63, and the Quote
will be 9 Hogsheads and 45 Gallons; See the work.

^

Quest. 21. In 12 Tun how many Rundlets of 14 Gallons per Rundlet?

Reduce your Tuns into Gallons, and divide them by 14, the Gallons in a
Rundlet, and the Quotient 216 is your Answer; See the work following.

^

Reduction of Long Measure.
Quest. 22. I demand how many Furlongs, Poles, Inches, and Barley Corns, will
Reach from London to York, it being accounted 151 Miles?

^

Quest. 23. The Circumference of the Earth (as all other Circles are) is
divided into 360 Degrees, and each degree into 60 Minutes, which (upon the
Superficies of the Earth) are equal to 60 miles; now I demand how many miles,
Furlongs, perches, yards, feet, and Barley-corns will Reach round the Globe of
the Earth?

^

Facit 4105728000 Barley Corns; And so many will reach Round the World, the
whole being 21600 Miles, so that if any Person were to go Round, and go 15
Miles every Day, he would go the whole Circumference in 1440 Days, which is 3
Years, 11 Months, and 15 Days.

Reduction of Time.
Quest. 24. In 28 years 24 weeks 4 days 16 hours 30 minutes, how many Minutes?

^

Note that in Resolving the last question after the method expressed there is
lost in every year 30 Hours, for the year consists of 365 Days and 6 Hours,
but by multiplying the years by 52 weeks, which is but 364 days you loose 1 day
and 6 hours every year* wherefore to find an exact Answer, bring the odd weeks
days, and hours into hours, and then multiply the years by the Number of hours
in a year, viz. 8766, and to the Product add the hours contained in the odd
time, and you have the exact time in hours, which bring into Minutes as before.
See the last Question thus Resolved ^

So you see that according to the method first used to Resolve this Question
the hours contained in the given time are 248752, but according to the last,
best, or true method, they are 249592 which exceeds the former by 840 hours.

But for most occasions it will be sufficient to multiply the given years by
365, and to the product add the days in the odd time if there be any, and then
there will be only a loss of 6 hours in every year, which may be supplied by
taking a fourth part of the given years, and adding it to the contained days,
and you have your desire.

Quest. 25. In 438657540 Minutes, how many years? Facit 834 years, 4 days 19
hours.

^

Quest. 26. I desire to know how many hours and minuits it is since the birth
of our Savior Jesus Christ, to this present year, being accounted 1677 years?

This Question is of the same Nature with the 24th foregoing, and after the
same manner is Resolved; viz. Multiply the given Number of years by 8766, the
Product is 14700582 hours, and that by 60 and the product is 882034920 minutes;
See the work.

^

Note that as Multiplication and Division do Interchangeably prove each other,
so Reduction Descending, and Ascending, prove each other by Inverting the
Question, as the 13 and 14 and likewise the 16 and 17 Questions foregoing, by
Inversion, do Interchangeably prove each other, the like may be performed for
the proof of any Question in Reduction whatsoever?

Thus far have we discoursed concerning single Arithmetic, whose Nature, and
parts are defined in the second, eighth, ninth, and tenth definitions of the
third Chapter of this book, for although Reduction is not reckoned or defined
among the parts of single Arithmetic, yet considered Abstractly, it is the
proper effect of multiplication and division; and as for the extraction of
Roots (which ought to be handled in the next place as parts of single
Arithmetic) we shall omit, until the Learner is made acquainted with the
Doctrine of Decimals, and Immediately enter upon Comparative Arithmetic.

CHAP. IX. Of Comparative Arithmetic, viz. The Relation of Numbers one to
another.
1. COmparative Arithmetic is that which is wrought by Numbers as they are
considered to have Relation one to another, Boethius Arith. lib. 1. cap. 21.
and this consists either in quantity, or in quallity.

2. Relation of Numbers in Quantity, is the Reference or Respect, that the
Numbers themselves have one to another: vide Wing: Arith. chapter 34.
where the Terms, or Numbers propounded are always two, the first called the
Antecedent and the other the Consequent.

3. The Relation of Numbers in quantity, consists in the differences, or in the
Rate or Reason (...) is found betwixt the Terms propounded the difference of
two Numbers, being the Remainder found by Substraction, Alsted Mathemat. lib.
2. cap. 11. and 12.
but the Rate or Reason betwixt two Numbers is the Quotient of the Antecedent
divided by the Consequent. So 21 and 7 being given the difference betwixt them
will be found to be 14, but the rate or reason that is betwixt 21 and 7 will be
found to be Triple Reason, for 21 divided by 7 quotes 3, the reason or rate.

4. The Relation of Numbers in Quality, (otherwise called Proportion) is the
Reference or Respect that the Reason of Numbers have one unto another;
therefore the Terms given ought to be more than two. Now this Proportion or
Reason between Numbers relating one to another, Alsted. Math. lib. 2. cap. 12.
is either Arithmetical or Geometrical.

5. Arithmetical proportion (by some called Progression) is when diverse Numbers
differ one from another by equal Reason, that is, have equal differences.

So this Rank of Numbers, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, differ by equal Reason,
viz. by 2 as you may prove.

6. In a Rank of Numbers that differ by Arithmetical proportion, the Sum of the
first and last term, being multiplied by half the number of terms, the Product
is the total Sum of all the Terms.

Or if you multiply the Number of the terms by the half Sum of the first and
last terms, the Product thereof will be the total sum of all the Terms.

So in the former Progression given, 3 and 17 is 20, which Multiplied by 4 (
viz. half the Number of terms) the Product gives 80, the Sum of all the terms,
or multiply 8, (the Number of terms) by 10 (half the sum of the first and last
terms) the Product gives 80, as before.

So also 21, 18, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, being given, the Sum of all the terms will be
found to be 84; for here the Number of terms is 7, and the Sum of the first and
last ( viz. 21 and 3) is 24, half whereof ( viz. 12) multiplied by 7, produces
84 the sum of the terms sought.

7. Three numbers that differ by Arithmetical proportion, the double of the
mean (or middle number) is equal to the sum of the Extremes.

So 9, 12 and 15 being given, the double of the mean 12 ( viz. 24) is equal to
the sum of the Extremes, 9 and 15.

8. Four numbers that differ by Arithmetical proportion (either continued or
interrupted) the sum of the two means is equal to the sum of the two Extremes.
So 9, vide Wing. Arithm. chap. 35.
12, 18, 21, being given, the sum of 12 and 18 will be equal to the sum of 9
and 21, viz. 30; also 6, 8, 14, 16, being given, the Sum of 8 and 14, is equal
to the sum of 6 and 16, viz. 22. etc.

9. Geometrical Proportion (by some called Geometrical Progression) is when
diverse numbers differ according to like Reason.

So 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. differ by double Reason and 3, 9, 27, 81, 243,
729, differ by Triple Reason, 4, 16, 64, 256, etc. differ by quadruple Reason,
etc.

10. In any numbers that increase by Geometrical proportion, if you multiply
the last term by the Quotient of any one of the terms, divided by another of
the terms, which being less, is next unto it, and having deducted, or
subtracted the first term out of that product, divide the Remainder by a number
that is an unit less then the said Quotient, the last quote will give you the
sum of all the Terms.

So 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, being ^ given, first I take one of the terms, viz.
8 and divide it by the term which is less and next to it, ( viz. by 4) and the
Quotient is 2, by which I multiply the last term 64, and the Product is 128,
from whence I subtract the first term, (viz. 1) the Remainder is 127 which
divided by the quotient 2 made less by 1 ( viz. 1.) the quote is 127 for the
sum of all the given terms, as by the work in the margent.

So if 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024 were given, the Sum of all the terms ^ will be
found to be 1364. For first I divide 64 one of the terms by his next lesser
term, and the Quotient is 4, by which I multiply the last term 1024 and it
produces 4096; from whence I substract the first term 4, and the Remainder is
4092, which I divide by the quote less 1 ( viz. 3) and the quote is 1364 for
the total sum of all the terms, as per margent.

So likewise if 2, 6.18, ^ 54, 162, 486, were given the sum or total of all the
terms will be found to be 728, see the work.

11. Three Geometrical proportionals given, the square of the mean is equal to
the Rectangle, or Product of the Extremes.

So 8, 16, 32 being given, the square of the mean, viz. 16 is 256, which is
equal to the Product of the Extremes 8 and 32, for 8 times 32 is equal to 256.

12. Of 4 Geometrical proportional numbers given, the Product of the two means,
is equal to the Product of the two Extremes.

So 8, 16, 32, 64, being given, I say that the Product of the two means, viz.
16 times 32 which is 512 is equal to 8 times 64 the product of the Extremes.

Also if 3, 9, 21, 63, were given (which are Interrupted) I say 9 times 21 is
equal to 3 times 63.

From hence arises (that precious Gem in Arithmetic, which for the excellency
thereof is called) the Golden Rule, or Rule of 3.

CHAP. X. The single Rule of three Direct.
1. THE Rule of Three (not undeservedly called the Golden Rule) is that by
which we find out a fourth number, in proportion unto three given numbers, so
as this fourth number sought may bear the same Rate, Reason, or Proportion to
the third (given) number, as the second does to the first, from whence it is
also called the Rule of Proportion.

2. Four Numbers are said to be Proportional, when the first contains, or is
contained by the second, as often as the third contains, or is contained by
the fourth. Vide Wingates Arith. Chap. 8. Sect. 4.

So these Numbers are said to be Proportionals, viz. 3, 6, 9, 18, for as often
as the first Number is contained in the second, so often is the third contained
in the fourth, viz. twice. Also 9, 3, 15, 5, are said to be Proportional, for
as often as the first Number contains the second, so often the third Number
contains the fourth, viz. 3 times.

3. The Rule of Three is either simple, or composed.

4. The simple (or single) Rule of three, consists of 4 Numbers, that is to
say, it has 3 Numbers given to find out a fourth; and this is either Direct,
or Inverse. Vide Alsted. Math. lib. 2. Cap. 13.

5. The single Rule of three direct, is when the Proportion of the first term
is to the second, as the third is to the fourth; or when it is Required that
the Number sought ( viz.) the fourth Number must have the same Proportion to
the second, as the third has to the first.

6. In the Rule of three, the greatest difficulty is (after the question is
propounded) to discover the order of the 3 terms, viz. which is the first,
which is the second, and which the third, which that you may understand
observe, That (of the three given Numbers) two are always of one kind, and the
other is of the same kind with the Proportional Number that is sought; as in
this Question, viz. If 4 yards of Cloth cost 12 shillings, what will 6 yards
cost at that Rate? here the two Numbers of one kind are 4 and 6, viz. they both
signify so many yards; and 12 shillings is the same kind with the Number
sought, for the price of 6 yards is sought.

Again observe, that of the 3 given numbers, those two that are of the same
kind, one of them must be the first, and the other the third, and that which is
of the same kind with the number sought, must be the second number in the Rule
of three; and that you may know which of the said numbers to make your first,
and which your third, know this, that to one of those two Numbers there is
always affixed a demand, and that Number upon which the demand lies must
always be Reckoned the third Number. As in the forementioned Question, the
demand is affixed to the Number 6, for it is demanded what 6 yards will cost?
and therefore 6 must be the third Number and 4 (which is of the same
denomination (or kind) with it) must be the first, and consequently the Number
12, must be the second, and then the Numbers being placed in the forementioned
order will stand as follows, viz. yards s yards 4 12 6

7. In the Rule of three Direct (having placed the Numbers as is before
directed, the next thing to be done will be to find out the fourth Number in
proportion which that you may do) Multiply the second Number by the third, and
divide the Product thereof by the first, or (which is all one) multiply the
third term (or Number) by the second and divide the Product thereof by the
first, and the Quotient thence arising is the fourth number in a direct
proportion, and is the Number sought or Answer to the Question, As thus let the
said Question be again Repeated, viz. If 4 yards of Cloth cost 12 shillings,
what will 6 yards cost?

Having placed my Numbers according to the 6 Rule (of this Chapter) foregoing,
I multiply the second number 12, by the third number 6, and the product is 72,
which I divide by the first number 4, and the quotient thence arising is 18,
which is the fourth Proportional or number sought, viz. 18 shillings, which is
the Price of the 6 yards, as was Required, see the work following.

^

Quest. 2. Another question may be this, viz. If 7 C. of Pepper cost 21 l. how
much will 16 C. cost at that Rate?

To Resolve which question, I consider that (according to the 6 Rule of this
Chapter) the terms or numbers ought to be placed thus, viz. the demand lying
upon 16 C. it must be the third number, and that of the same kind with it must
be the first, viz. 7 C. and 21 l. (being of the same kind with the number
sought) must be the second number in this Question, then I proceed according to
this 7 Rule, and multiply the second number by the third, viz. 21 by 16, and
the product is 336 which I divide by the first number 7, and the Quotient is 48
l. which is the value of 16 C. of Pepper at the Rate of 21 l. for 7 C. See the
work as follows.

^

8. If when you have divided the product of the second and third numbers by the
first, any thing Remain after Division is ended, such Remainder may be
multiplied by the parts of the next Inferior denomination, that are equal to a
unit (or Integer) of the second number in the question, and the product thereof
divide by the first number in the question, and the quotient is of the same
denomination with the Parts by which you multiplied the Remainder, and is part
of the fourth number which is sought. And furthermore, if any thing Remain,
after this last Division is ended multiply it by the parts of the next
inferior denomination equal to a unit of the last quotient, and divide the
product by the same divisor, ( viz. the first number in the question) and the
quote is still of the same denomination with your Multipliar; follow this
method unt^ll you have Reduced your Remainder into the lowest denomination,
etc. An Example or two will make the Rule very plain which may be this
following.

Quest. 3. If 13 yards of Velvet (or any other thing) cost 21 l. what will 27
yards of the same cost at that Rate?

Having ordered, and wrought, my Numbers according to the 6 and 7 Rules of this
chapter, I find the quotient to be 43 l. and there is a Remainder of 8, so that
I conclude the price of 27 yards to be more than 43 l. and to the intent that I
may know how much more I work according to the foregoing Rule, viz. I multiply
the said Remainder 8, by 20 s. (because the second number in the Question was
pounds) and the product is 160, which divided by the first number, viz. 13, it
quotes 12, which are 12 shillings, and there is yet a Remainder of 4, which I
multiply by 12 pence (because the last Quotient was shillings) and the product
is 48. which I divide by 13 (the first number) and the quotient is 3 d. and yet
there Remains 9, which I multiply by 4 farthings, and the product is 36,
which divided by 13 again, it quotes 2 farthings, and there is yet a Remainder
of 10, which (because it comes not to the value of a farthing) may be
neglected, or Rather set (after the 2 farthings) over the Divisor with a line
between them, and then (by the 21 and 22 definitions of the first Chapter of
this book) it will be 10/13 of a farthing; So that I conclude, that if 13 yards
of Velvet cost 21 l. 27 yds. of the same will cost 43 l. 12 s. 3 d. 2 10/13
qrs. which Fraction is ten thirteenths of a farthing. See the operation as
follows.

^

Quest. 4. Another Example may be this following, viz. If 14 l. of Tobacco cost
27 s. what will 478 l. cost at that rate?

Work according to the last Rule, and you will find it to amount to 921 s. 10
d. 1 2/14 qrs. and by the 5 Rule of the 8 Chapter 921 s. may be Reduced to 46
l. 01 s. So that then the whole worth or value of the 478 l. will be 46 l. 01
s. 10 d. 1 2/14 qrs. the whole work follows.

^

9. In the Rule of 3 it many times happens that although the first and third
numbers be Homogeneal (that is, of one kind) as both money, weight, measure,
etc. yet they may not be of one denomination, or perhaps they may both consist
of many denominations, in which case you are to reduce both numbers to one
denomination; and likewise your second number (if it consists of diverse
denominations) must be reduced to the least name mentioned, or lower if you
please which being done, multiply second and third together and divide by the
first, as is directed in the 7 Rule of this Chapter.

And note that always the Answer to the question is in the same denomination
that your second number is of, or is Reduced to.

Quest. 5. If 15 ounces of Silver be worth 3 l. 15 s. what are 86 ounces worth
at that Rate?

In this question the numbers being ordered according to the 6 Rule of this
Chapter, the first and third numbers are ounces, and the second number is of
diverse denominations, viz. 3 l. 15 s. which must be Reduced to Shillings, and
the shillings multiplied by the third number, and the Product divided by the
first gives you the Answer in shillings, viz. 430 s. which are reduced to 21 l.
10 s. See the work.

^

In resolving the last question the work would have been the same if you had
reduced your second Number into pence, for then the Answer would have been 5160
pence, equal to 21 l. 10 s. or if you had Reduced the Second number into
farthings the Quotient, or Answer, would have been 20640 farthings equal to the
same, as you may prove at your leisure.

Quest. 6. If 8 l. of Pepper cost 4 s. 8 d. what will 7 C. 3 qrs. 14 l. cost?

In this Question the first number is 8 l. and the third is 7 C. 3 qrs. 14 l.
which must be reduced to the same denomination with the first, viz. into
pounds, and the second number reduce into pence, then Multiply and Divide,
according to the 7 Rule foregoing and you will find the answer to be 6174 pence
which is reduced into 25 l. 14 s. 6 d.

^

Quest. 7. I^ 3 C. 1 qrs. 14 l. of Raisons cost 9 l. 9 s. what will 6 C. 3 qrs.
20 l. of the same cost?

Here the first and third numbers each consist of diverse denominations, but
must be brought both into one denomination etc. as you see in the operation
which follows; the Answer is 388 s. which is Reduced into 19 l. 8 s.

^

Quest. 8. If in 3 weeks 4 days I spend 13 s. 4 d. how long will 53 l. 06 s.
last me at that Rate?

Answer, 2238 days equal to 6 year^ 48 days. See the work.

^

Quest. 9. Suppose the yearly Rent of a house, a yearly pension, or wages be 73
l. I desire to know how much it is per day?

Here you are to bring the year into days, and say, If 365 days Require 73 l.
what will 1 day Require?

Now when you come to multiply 73 by 1 the product is the same, for 1 neither
multiplyeth nor divides, and 73 cannot be divided by 365 because the divisor
is bigger than the dividend, wherefore bring the 73 l. into shillings, and they
make 1460, which divide by the first number 365, and the quote is 4 shillings
for the Answer, as you see in the work.

^

Quest. 10. A Merchant bought 14 pieces of broad-cloath, each piece containing
28 yards, for which he gave after the Rate of 13 s. 6 d per yard, now I desire
to know how much he gave for the 14 pieces at that Rate.

First find out how many yards are in the 14 pieces which you will do if you
multiply the 14 pieces by 28 the number of yards in a piece, and it makes 392,
then say If 1 yard cost 13 s. 6 d. what will 392 yards cost? work as follows
and the Answer you will find to be 127400 halfpence, which Reduced make 265 l.
8 s. 4 d. For after you have multiplied your second and third numbers together
the product is 127400, which (according to the Rule) should be divided by the
first number, but the first number is 1, which neither multiplyeth nor
divides, and therefore the quotient, or fourth number is the same with the
Product of the second and third, which is in halfpence because the second
number was so Reduced. See the work.

^

Quest. 11. A Draper bought 420 yards of broad-cloth, and gave for it after the
Rate of 14 s^ 10 d. per Ell English, now I demand how much he paid for the
whole at that Rate?

Bring your ell into quarters and your yards given into quarters, the ell is 5
quarters and in 420 yards are 1680 quarters, then say, If 5 quarters cost 14 s.
10 d. or 715 farthings, what will 1680 quarters cost? facit 250 l. 05 s. 00 d.

^

Quest. 12. A Draper bought of a Merchant 50 pieces of Kersies each piece
containing 34 Else flemish, (the Ell Flemish being 3 quarters of a yard) to pay
after the Rate of 8 s. 4 d. per Ell English, I demand how much the 50 pieces
cost him at that Rate?

First find how many Else Flemish are in the 50 pieces by multiplying 50 by 34,
the product is 1700 which bring into quarters by 3 it makes 5100 quarters, then
proceed as in the last question, and the Answer you will find to be 102000
pence or 425 l.

^

Quest. 13. A Goldsmith bought a wedge of Gold which weighed 14 l. 3 oz. 8 p.w.
for the sum of 514 l. 4 s. I demand what it stood him in per ounce? Answer 60
shillings or 3 l. See the work.

^

Quest. 14. A Grocer bought 4 hhds of Sugar, each weighing neat 6 C. 2 qrs. 14
l. which cost him 2 l. 8 s. 6 d. per C. I demand the value of the 4 hhds. at
that Rate?

First find the weight of the 4 hhds, which you may do by Reducing the weight
of one of them into pounds, and multiply them by 4 (the number of hhds) and
they make 2968 l. then say, If 1 C. or 112 l. cost 2 l. 8 s. 6 d. what will
2968 l. cost? Facit 64 l. 5 s. 3 d, as by the operation.

^

Quest. 15. A Draper bought of a Merchant 8 Packs of Cloth, each pack
containing 4 parcels, and each parcel 10 pieces, and in each piece 26 yards,
and gave after the Rate of 4 l. 16 s for 6 yards, now I desire to know how much
he gave for the whole, Answer 6656 l.

First find out how many yards there were in the 8 packs, as by the following
work, you will find there are 8320 yards; then say, If 6 yards cost 4 l. 16 s.
what will 8320 yards Cost, etc.

11. The General Effect of the Rule of three Direct, is contained in the
definition of the same, that is, to find a fourth number in proportion
consisting of two equal Reasons, as has been fully shown in all the foregoing
Examples.

The second Effect is, by the price or value of one thing to find the price or
value of many things of like kind?

The third Effect is by the price or value of many things to find the price of
1, or by the price of many things (the said price being 1) to find the price of
many things of like kind.

The fourth Effect is, by the price or value of many things, to find the price
or value of many things of like kind.

The fifth Effect is, thereby to Reduce any Number of moneys, weight or measure
the one sort into the other, as in the Rules of Reduction contained in the 8
Chapter foregoing Examples of its various Effects have been already Answered.

12. The Rule of 3 Direct is thus proved, viz. Multiply the first Number by the
fourth, The proof of the Rule of Three Direct.
and note the product, then multiply the second Number by the third, and if
this product is equal to the product of the first and fourth, then the work is
Rightly performed, otherwise it is Erroneous.

So the first Question of this Chapter (whose Answer, or fourth Number we found
to be 18 s.) is thus proved, viz. the first Number is 4, which multiplied by 18
(the fourth) produces 72. And the second and third Numbers are 12 and 6, which
multiplied together produce 72, equal to the product of the first and fourth,
and therefore I conclude the work to be Rightly performed.

Allways observing, that if any thing Remain after you have divided the product
of the second and third Numbers, by the first, such Remainder in proving the
same, must be added to the product of the first and fourth Numbers, whose sum
will be equal to the product of the second and third, (the second number being
of the same denomination with the fourth, and the first with the same
denomination of the third.)

So the Fourth Question of this Chapter, being again repeated, viz. If 14 l. of
Tobacco cost 27 s. what will 478 l. cost at that Rate? the Answer (or 4th
number) was 46 l. 01 s. 10 d. 1 qrs. 2/14 which is thus proved, viz. bring the
fourth number into farthings and it makes 44249 which multiplied by the first
number 14 produces 619488 (the 2 which remained being added thereto) then
(because I Reduced my fourth number into farthings) I Reduce my second ( viz.
27 s.) into farthings and they are 1296 which multiplied by the third number
478, their product is 619488 equal to the product of the first and fourth
Numbers. Wherefore I conclude the operation to be true. This is an Infallible
way to prove the Rule of 3 Direct, and it is deduced from the twelfth Sect. of
the 9th. Chap. of this Book.

Thus much concerning the single Rule of 3 Direct, and I Question not but by
this time the Learner is sufficiently quallified to Resolve any Question
pertinent to this Rule, not Relying upon fractions, or Geometrical magnitudes.
Those that are desirous to see the demonstration of this Rule, let them Read
the 6th. Chapter of (the Ingenious) Mr. Kersies Appendix to Wingates
Arithmetic. Or the 6th. Chapter of Mr. Oughtreds (Incomparable) Clavis
Mathematicae: By both which Authors this Rule is largely demonstrated, being
grounded upon the 19 Prop. of the 7th, and the 19 Prop. of the 9th. of Euclids
Elem.

CHAP. XI. The single Rule of three Inverse.
1. THE Golden Rule or Rule of 3 Inverse is when there are 3 Numbers given to
find a 4th. in such Proportion to the 3 given Numbers, so as the 4th. proceeds
from the second, according to the same Rate, Reason, or Proportion that the
first proceeds from the third, or the Proportion is

As the third number is in proportion to the second, Alsted. Math. lib. 2. cap.
14.
so is the first to the fourth.

So if the 3 numbers given were 8, 12, and 16, and it were Required to find a
4th. number in an inverted proportion to these, I say that as 16 (the third
Number) is the double of the first term or number (8) so must 12 (the second
number) be the double of the 4th; so will you find the 4th. term or number to
be 6. And as in the Rule of 3 Direct, you multiply the second and third
together, and divided their product for a 4th Proportional number, So

2. In the Rule of 3 Inverse, you must Multiply the second term by the first
(or first term by the second) and divide the product thereof by the 3d. term,
so the Quotient will give you the 4th. term sought in an Inverted Proportion.
The same order being observed in this Rule as in the Rule of 3 Direct, for
placing or disposing of the given numbers, and after your numbers are placed in
order, that you may know whether your Question be to be Resolved by the Rule
Direct or Inverse, observe the general Rule following.

3. When your Question is stated, and your numbers orderly disposed, Consider
in the 1st. place whether the 4th. term or number sought, ought to be more, or
less then the second term; which you may easily do; And if it is required to be
more, or greater then the second term, then the lesser Extreme must be your
divisor, but if it require less, then the biggest Extreme must be your
Divisor, (In this Case the 1st and 3d numbers are called Extremes in Respect of
the second) and having found out your Divisor, you may know whether your
Question belong to the Rule Direct or Inverse, for if the 3d. term be your
Divisor, then it is Inverse, but if the first term be your Divisor, then it is
a Direct Rule. As In the following Questions.

Quest. 1. If 8 Laborers can do a certain piece of work in 12 days in how
many days will 16 Laborers do the same? Answer in 6 days.

Having placed the numbers according to the 6 Rule of the 10th. ^ Chapter. I
consider that if 8 men can finish the work in 12 days, 16 men will do it in
lesser (or fewer days then 12) therefore the biggest Extreme must be the
Divisor which is 16 and therefore it is the Rule of 3 Inverse, wherefore I
multiply the first and second numbers together viz. 8 by 12 and their product
is 96, which divided by 16 Quotes 6 days for the Answer, and in so many days
will 16 Laborers perform a piece of work when 8 can do it in 12 days.

Quest. 2. If when the measure ( viz. a peck) of wheat cost 2 shillings the
penny Loaf weighed (according to the Standard, Statute, or Law of England) 8
ounces, I demand how much it will weigh when the peck is worth 1 s. 6 d.
according to the same Rate or Proportion? Answer 10 oz. 13 p.w. 8 grs.

Having placed and reduced the given Numbers according to the 6 and 9 rules of
the 10th Chapter I consider that at 1 s. 6 d. per Peck, the penny Loaf will,
weigh more then at 2 s. per Peck, for as the price decreaseth, the weight
Increases, and as the price Increases so the weight diminishes, wherefore
because the term Requires more then the second, the lesser Extreme must be the
Divisor, viz. 1 s. 6 d. or 18 pe^^e, and having finished the work I find the
Answer to be 10 oz. 13 p.w. 8 gr. and so much will the penny Loaf weigh, when
the peck of wheat is worth 1 s. 6 d. according to the given Rate of 8 ounces,
when the peck is worth 2 shillings, the work is plain in the following
operation.

^

Quest. 3. How many pieces of money or Merchandise at 20 s. per piece, are to
be given, or Received for 240 pieces, the value or price of every piece being
12 shillings? Answer 144. For if 12 s. Require 240 pieces, then 20 shillings
will Require less; therefore the biggest Extreme must be the Divisor, which is
the 3 number, etc. See the work.

^

Quest. 4. How many yards of 3 quarters broad are Required to double, or be
equal in measure to 30 ^ yards, that are 5 quarters broad? Answer 50 yards. For
say If 5 quarter wide Require 30 yards long, what length will three quarters
broad require? here I consider that 3 quarters broad will Require more yards
then 30, for the narrower the cloth is, the more in length will go to make
equal measure with a broader piece.

Quest. 5. At the Request of a friend I lent him 200 l. for 12 months,
promising to do me the like Courtesy at my necessity, but when I came to
Request it of him he could let me have but 150 l. now I desire to know how long
I may keep this money to make plenary Satisfaction for my former kindness to my
Friend? Answer, 16 Months.

I say, If 200 l. Require 12 Months, what will 150 l. Require? 150 l. will
Require more time then 12 Months, therefore the lesser extreme (viz. 150) must
be the Divisor, Multiply and Divide, and you will find the 4th inverted
Proportional to be 16, and so many Months I ought to keep the 150 l. for
satisfaction.

Quest. 6. If for 24 s. I have 1200 l. weight carried 36 M. how many M. shall
800 l. be carried for the same money? Answer, 24 M.

Quest. 7. If for 24 s. I have 1200 l. carried 36 Miles how many pound weight
shall I have carried 24 miles for the same money? Answer, 800 l. weight.

Quest 8. If 100 workmen in 12 days finish a piece of work or service, how
many workmen are sufficient to do the same in 3 days? Answer 400 workmen.

Quest. 9. A Colonel is besieged in a Town in which are 1000 Soldiers, with
provision of Victuals only for 3 Months, the Question is how many of his
Sould^ers must he dism^ss that his Victuals may last the Remaining Soldiers 6
Months? Answer, 500 he must keep, and dismiss as many.

Quest. 10. If wine worth 20 l. is sufficient for the ordinary of 100 men, when
the Tun is sold for 30 l. how many men will the same 20 pounds worth suffice
when the Tun is worth 24 l. Answer, 125 men.

Quest. 11. How much plush is sufficient to line a Cloak which has in it 4
yards of 7 quarters wide, when the Plush is but 3 quarters wide? Answer 9 yds.
of Plush.

Quest. 12. How many yards of Canvas that is Ell wide will be sufficient to
line 20 yards of Say that is 3 quarters wide? Answer, 12 yards.

Quest. 13. How many yards of matting that is 2 foot wide, will cover a floor
that is 24 foot long, and 20 foot broad, Answer, 240 foot.

Quest. 14. A Regiment of Soldiers consisting of 1000 are to have new Coats,
and each coat to contain 2 yds. 2 qrs. of Cloth that is 5 qrs. wide, and they
are to be lined with Shalloon that is 3 quarters wide, I demand how many yards
of Shalloon will line them? Answer, 16666 yards?

Quest. 15. A Messenger makes a Journey in 24 days when the day is 12 hours
long, I desire to know in how many days he will go the same when the day is 16
hours long? Answer, in 18 days.

Quest. 16. Borrowed of my friend 64 l. for 8 Months, And he has occasion
another time for to borrow of me for 12 Months, I desire to know how much I
must lend to make good his former kindness to me? Answer 42 l. 13 s. 4 d.

4. The General Effect of the Rule of 3 Inverse is contained in the Definition
of the same, that is, to find a fourth term in a Reciprocal Proportion,
inverted to the Proportion given.

The second Effect, is by two prises or values of two several pieces of money
or Merchandise known, to find how many pieces of the one price is to be given
for so many of the other. And consequently to Reduce or Exchange one sort of
Money, or Merchandise, into another. Or contrariwise to find the price unknown
of any piece given to Exchange, in Reciprocal Proportion.

The third Effect, is by two d^ffering prizes of a measure of wheat bought or
sold, and the weight of the Loaf of bread, made answerable to one of the prises
of the measure given, to find out the weight of the same Loaf, answerable to
the other price of the said measure given. Or contrariwise by the two several
weights of the same prized Loaf, and the price of the measure of wheat
answerable, to one of those weights given, to find out the other price of the
measure answerable to the other weight of the same Loaf.

The Fourth Effect, is by two lengths and one breadth of two Rectangular planes
known, to find out another breadth unknown* Or by two breadths and one length
given, to find out another length unknown in an inverted Proportion.

The fifth Effect, is by double time and a Capital sum of money borrowed or
lent, to find out another Capital sum answerable to one of the given times, Or
contrariwise, by two Capital sums, and a time answerable to one of them given,
to find out a time answerable to the other Capital sum in Reciprocal Reason.

The sixth Effect is, by two differing weights of Carriage, and the distance of
the places in Miles or in Leagues given, to find another distance in miles
answerable to the same price of payment, Or otherwise by two distances in miles
and the weight answerable to one of the distances (being carried for a certain
price) to find out the weight answerable to the other distance for the same
price.

The seventh Effect* is by double workmen, and the time answerable to one of
the numbers of workmen given, to find out the time answerable to the other
number of workmen, in the performance of any work or service. Or contrariwise,
by double time, and the workmen answerable to one of those times given, to find
out the number of workmen answerable to the other time, in the performance any
work or service.

Also by a double price of provision, and the number of men, or other Creatures
nourished for a certain time, answerable to one of the prises of provision
given, to find out another number of Men or other Creatures answerable to the
other price of the provision for the same time. Or contrariwise by two numbers
of Men or other Creatures nourished, and one price of provision answerable to
one of the numbers of Creatures given, to find out the other price of the same
provision answerable to the other number of Creatures, both being supposed to
be nourished for the same time, etc. As in the foregoing Examples is fully
declared.

To prove the operation of the Rule of 3 Inverse, multiply the third and fourth
terms together, and note their product, then multiply the first and second
together, and if their product is equal to the product of third and fourth,
then is the work truly wrought, but if it falls out otherwise then it is
erroneous.

As in the first Question of this Chapter the product of 16 (the third number)
mult^plyed by 6 (the 4th. number) is 96, and the product of 8 (the first
number) multiplied by 12 (the second number) is 96, equal to the first product
which proves the work to be Right.

And Note, that if in Division any thing Remain, such Remainder must be added
to the product of third and 4th. terms, and if the sum be equal to the product
of the first and second (the homogeneal terms being of one denomination) the
work is Right.

CHAP. XII. The double Rule of three Direct.
WE have already delivered the Rules of Single Proportion, and we come now to
lay down the Rules of Plural Proportion.

1. Plural Proportion, is when more operations in the Rule of 3 than one, are
Required before a Solution can be given to the Question propounded. Therefore
in Questions that Require Plurality in Proportion, there are always given more
then three numbers.

2. When there are given 5 numbers, and a sixth is Required in Proportion
thereunto, then this sixth Proportional is said to be found out by the double
Rule of 3, as in the Question following, viz.

If 100 l. in 12 Months gains 6 l. Interest, how much will 75 l. gain in 9
Months?

3. Questions in the double Rule of 3 may be Resolved either by two single
Rules of three, or by one single Rule of 3 compounded of the 5 given Numbers.

4. The double Rule of three is either Direct or else Inverse?

5. The double Rule of 3 Direct is when unto 5 given Numbers a sixth
Proportional may be found out by two single Rules of three Direct.

6. The 5 given Numbers in the double Rule of three, consist of two parts, viz.
first a Supposition, and secondly of a Demand. The Supposition is contained in
the three first of the 5 given Numbers, and the Demand lies in the two last; as
in the Example of the second Rule of this Chapter, viz. If 100 l. in 12 Months
gain 6 l. Interest, what will 75 l. gain in 9 Months? here the Supposition is
expressed in 100, 12, and 6, for it is said if (or suppose) 100 l. in 12 Months
gain 6 l. Interest; and the Demand lies in 75 and 9; for it is demanded how
much 75 l. will gain in 9 Months?

7. When your Question is stated, the next thing will be to dispose of the
given Numbers in due order and place, as a preparative for Resolution; which
that you may do, first observe which of the given Numbers in the Supposition is
of the same denomination with the Number Required; for that must be the second
Number (in the first operation) of the single Rule of 3, and one of the other
Numbers in the Supposition (it matters not which) must be the first Number, and
that Number in the demand which is of the same denomination with the first,
mu^t be the third Number, which three Numbers being thus placed, will make one
perfect Question in the single Rule of three, as in the forementioned Example,
first I consider, that the Number Required in the Question is the Interest or
Gain, of 75 l. therefore that Number in the Supposition which has the same
name ( viz. 6 l. which is the Interest or Gain of 100 l.) must be the second
Number in the 1st operation, and either 100 ^ or 12 (it matters not which) must
be the first Number, but I will take 100, and then for the 3^ number, I put
that number in the Demand which has the same denomination with 100, which is
75, (for they both signify pounds principal) and then the Numbers will stand
as you see in the margent.

But if I had for the first number put the other number in the Supposition viz.
12, which signifies 12 Months, then the third Number must have been ^ 9, which
is that number in the Demand which has the same Denomination with the first,
viz. 9 Months, and then they will stand as you see in the Margent.

There yet Remains two numbers to be disposed of, and those are, ^ one in the
supposition, and another in the Demand, that which is of the supposition, I
place under the first of the three Numbers and the other which is in the demand
I place under the 3d number, and then 2 of the terms in the Supposition will
stand (one over the other) in the first place, and the 2 terms in the Demand
will stand (one over the other) in the third place, as in the margent.

8. Having disposed, or ordered the numbers given according to the last Rule,
we may proceed to a Resolution, and first I work with the three uppermost
numbers which according to the first disposition are 100, 6, and 75, which is
as much as to say, If 100 l. Require 6 l. (Interest) how much will 75 l.
Require, which by the 3 Rule of the 11 Chapter I find to be Direct, and by the
7 and 8 Rules of the 10th. Chapter I find the 4th. Proportional number, to be 4
l. 10 s. so that by the foregoing single question I have discovered how much 75
l. will gain Interest in 12 M. the operation whereof follows on the left hand
under the Letter A; and having discovered how much 75 l. will gain in 12
Months, we may by another question easily discover how much it will gain in 9
Months, for this 4th. number (thus found) I put in the middle between the two
lowest numbers of the five, after they are placed according to the 7th. Rule of
this Chapter; and then it will be a second number. In another Question in the
Rule of 3, the numbers being ^ the first and third numbers being of one
denomination, viz. both Months, and may be thus expressed. If 12 Months
Require 4 l. 10 s. Interest, what will 9 Months Require? and by the 3 Rule of
the 11 Chapter, I find it to be the Direct Rule, and by working according to
the directions laid down in the 7, 8, and 9 Rules of the 10th. Chapter, I find
the 4th. Proportional number to the last single Question to be 3 l. 07 s. 06.
which is the sixth Proportional number to the 5 given numbers and is the Answer
to the General Question. The work of the last single Question is expressed on
the Right side of the page under the letter B as follows.

^

So that by the foregoing operation I conclude that If 100 l. in 12 Months gain
6 l. Interest, 75 l. will gain 3 l. 7 s. 6 d. in 9 Months, after the same Rate.

The Answer would have ^ been the same, if the 5 given numbers had been ordered
according to the second method, viz. as you see in the margent.

For first I say, If 12 Months gain 6 l. what will 9 Months gain, this Question
I find to be Direct by the 3 Rule of the 11th. Chapter, and by the 7 and 8
Rules of the 10th. Chapter, I find the fourth Proportional number to these
three to be 4 l. 10 s.

Thus have I found out what is the Interest of 100 l. for 9 Months, and I have
now to find the Interest of 75 l. for 9 Months, to effect which, I make this
4th. number (found as before) to be my second number in the next Question, and
say, If 100 l. Require 4 l. 10 s. what will 75 l. Require, this Question I find
(by the said 3 Rule of the 11th. Chapter) to be Direct, and by the said 7, 8,
and 9 Rules of the 10th Chapter, I find the Answer to be as before viz. 3 l. 7
s. 6 d.

This Rule has been sufficiently explained by the foregoing Example, so that
the Learner may be able to Resolve the following (or any other) questions
pertinent to the double Rule of 3 Direct, whose answers are there given, but
the operation purposely omitted to try the Learners ability in the knowledge of
what has been before delivered.

Quest. 2. A second Example in this Rule may be as follows, viz. A Carrier
Receives 42 shillings for the Carriage of 3 C. weight 150 Miles* I demand how
much he ought to Receive for the Carriage of 7 C. 3 qrs. 14 l. 50 Miles at that
Rate? Answer 36 s. 9 d.

Quest. 3. A Regiment of 936 Soldiers eat up 351 quarters of wheat in 168
days, I demand how many quarters of wheat 11232 Soldiers will eat in 56 days
at that Rate? Answer 1404 qrs.

Quest. 4. If 40 Acres of Grass be mowed by 8 men in 7 days, how many Acres
shall be mowed by 24 men in 28 days? Answer, 480 Acres.

Quest. 5. If 48 Bushels of Corn (or other seed) yield 576 Bushels in 1 year,
how much will 240 Bushels yield in 6 years at that Rate? that is to say, if
there were sowed 240 Bushels every one of the 6 years? Answer 17280 ^ushels.

Quest. 6. If 40 shilli^^ (...) wages of 8 men for 5 days, (...) shall be the
wages of 32 men for 24 days? Answer 768 shillings, or 38 l. 8 s.

Quest. 7. If 14 Horses eat 5^ bushels of provender in 16 days, how many
Bushels will 20 horses eat in 24 days? Answer 120 Bushels.

Quest. 8. If 8 Cannons in 1 day spend 48 barrels of Powder, I demand how many
barrels 24 Cannons will spend is 12 days at that Rate? Answer, 1728 barrels.

Quest. 9. If in a Family consisting of 7 Persons, there are drank out 2
Kilderkins of beer in 12 days, how many Kilderkins will there be drank out in
8 days, by another Family consisting of 14 persons? Answer 48 Gallons, or 2
Kilderkins and 12 Gallons.

Quest. 10. A Usurer put 75 l. out to Receive Interest for the same, and when
it had continued 9 Months, he Received for Principal and Interest 78 l. 7 s. 6
d. I demand at what Rate per Cent. per annum, he Received Interest? Answer, at
6 l. per Cent. per annum.

CHAP. XIII. The Double Rule of three Inverse.
1. The Double Rule of 3 Inverse, is when a question in the Double Rule of 3 is
Resolved by 2 Single Rules of 3, and one of those Single Rules falls out to be
Inverse, or requires a 4th. number in Proportion Reciprocal, (for both the
questions are never Inverse.)

2. In all questions of the Double Rule of 3 (as well Inverse as Direct) you
are (in the disposing of the 5 given numbers) to observe the 7th. Rule of the
12 Chapter, and in resolving of it by two single Rules, observe to make choice
of your Numbers for the first, and second, single questions, according to the
directions given in 8 Rule of the same Chapter, as in the Example following,
viz.

Quest. 1. If 100 l. Principal in 12 months gain 6 l. Interest, what Principal
will gain 3 l. 7 s. 6 d. in 9 Months?

This Question is an Inversion of the first question of the 12 Chapter, and may
serve for a proof thereof.

In order to a Resolution, I dispose of the 5 given numbers according to the
7th. Rule of the last Chapter, and being so disposed will stand as follows.

12 100 9 l. s. d. 6 3 -7 -6

Or thus l. s. d. 6 -100 -3 -7 -6 12 9

Here observe, that according to the 8th. Rule of the 12 Chapter, the first
question (if you take it from the 5 numbers as they are ordered or placed
first) will be, If 12 Months Require 100 l. Principal, what will 9 Months
Require? (to make the same Interest) this (according to the 3 Rule of the 11
Chapter) is Inverse, and the Answer will be found (by the 2 Rule of the 11th.
Chapter) to be 133 l. 6 s. 8 d. the second question then will be, If 6 l.
Interest, Require 133 l. 6 s. 8 d. Principal, how much Principal will 3 l. 7 s.
6 d. require, this is a direct Rule, and the Answer in a direct Proportion is
75 l. See the work.

^

^

So that by the foregoing work I find that if 6 l. Interest be gained by 100 l.
in 12 Months, 3 l. 7 s. 6 d. will be gained by 75 l. in 9 Months.

But if the Resolution had been found out by the numbers as they are Ranked in
the second place, then the second question in the single Rule would have been
Inverse, and the first Question Direct, and the conclusion the same with the
first method; viz. 75 l.

Quest. 2. If a Regiment consisting of 936 Soldiers can eat up 351 quarters of
wheat in 168 days, how many Soldiers will eat up 1404 quarters in 56 days at
that Rate? Answer, 11232 Soldiers.

Quest. 3. If 12 Students in 8 weeks spend 48 l. I demand how many Studen^s
will spend 288 l. in 18 weeks? Answer, 32 Students.

Quest. 4. If 48 l. serve 12 Students 8 weeks, how many weeks will 288 l. serve
4 Students? Answer, 144 weeks.

Quest. 5. If when the Bushel of wheat cost 3 s. 4 d. the penny Loaf weighs 12
ounces, I demand the weight of the Loaf worth 9 pence when the Bushel cost 10
s.? Answer, 3 l. or 36 ounces.

Quest. 6. If 48 pioneers in 12 days, cast a Trench 24 yards long, how many
pioneers will cast a Trench 168 yards long in 16 days? Answer, 252 pioneers.

Quest. 7. If 12 C. weight being Carried 100 miles cost 5 l. 12 s. I desire to
know how many C. may be carried 150 miles at that Rate? Answer, 18 C.

Quest. 8. If when wine is worth 30 l. per Tun, 20 pounds worth is sufficient
for the ordinary of 100 men, how many men will 4 l. worth suffice when it is
worth 24 l. per Tun? Answer 25 men.

Quest. 9. If 6 men in 24 days mow 72 Acres in how many days will 8 men mow 24
Acres? Answer in 6 days.

Quest. 10. If when the Tun of wine is worth 30 l. 100 men will be satisfied
with 20 l. worth, I desire to know what the Tun is worth when 4 l. worth will
satisfy 25 men at the same Rate? Answer 24 l. per Tun.

CHAP. XIV. The Rule of three Composed of 5 Numbers.
1. THE Rule of three Composed, is when questions (wherein there are 5 Numbers
given to find a 6 in Proportion thereunto) are Resolved by one single Rule of 3
Composed of the 5 given Numbers.

2. When questions may be performed by the double Rule of 3 Direct, and it
required to resolve them by the Rule of 3 Composed, (first Order or Rank your
Numbers according to the 7 Rule of the 12th. Chapter, then)

The Rule is

Multiply the terms (or numbers) that stand one over the other in the first
place, the one by the other, and make their Product the first term in the Rule
of 3 Direct, then Multiply the terms that stand one over the other in the third
place, and place their product for the third term in the Rule of 3 Direct, and
put the middle term of the 3 uppermost for a second term, then having found a
fourth Proportional, direct to these 3, then this 4th. Proportional so found,
shall be the Answer Required.

So the first question of the 12 Chap. ( viz. If 100 l. in 12 Months gain 6 l.
Interest, what will 75 l. gain in 9 Months? the numbers being Ranked (or
placed) as is there Directed and done.

Then I multiply the 2 first terms 100 and 12, the one by the other, and their
Product is 1200 (for the first term) then I multiply the two last terms 75 and
9 together, and their Product is 675 for the 3d. term. Then I say, As 1200 is
to 6, so is 675 to the Answer, which by the Rule of 3 Direct will be found to
be 3 l. 7 s. 6 d. as before.

3. But if the Question be to be Answered by the double Rule of 3 Inverse, then
(having placed the 5 given terms as before) multiply the lowermost term of the
first place, by the uppermost term of the third place, and put the Product for
the first term; then multiply the uppermost term of the first place, by the
lowermost term of the third place, and put the Product for the third term, and
put the second term of the 3 highest numbers for the middle term to those two,
then if the Inverse Proportion is found in the uppermost 3 numbers, the 4th.
Proportional direct to these 3 shall be the Answer; so the first question of
the 13th. Chapt. being stated, viz. If 100 l. Principal in 12 Months gain 6 l.
Interest, what Principal will gain 3 l. 7 s. 6 d. in 9 Months? State the
numbers as is there Directed in the first order, viz. M. l. M. 12 100 9 l. l.
s. d. 6 3 7 -6 then Reduce the 6 l. and 3 l. 7 s. 6 d. into pence, the 6 l. is
1440 d. and 3 l. 7 s. 6 d. is 810 d. then multiply 1440 by 9, the product is
12960 for the first term in the Rule of 3 Direct, and multiply 810 by 12, the
product is 9720 for the third term, then I say, As 12960 is to 100 l. so is
9720 to the Answer, viz. 75 l. as before. But if the terms had been placed
after the second order, viz. l. l. l. s. d. 6 100 3 -7 -6 M. M. 12 9 then the
Inverse Proportion is found in the lowest numbers, and having composed the
numbers for a single Rule of 3 as in the second Rule foregoing, then the Answer
must be found by a single Rule of 3 Inverse, for here it falls out to multiply
810 by 12 for the first number, and 1440 by 9 for the third number, and then
must say, As 9720 is to 100 l. so is 12960 to the Answer, which by Inverse
Proportion will be found to be 75 l. as before.

The questions in the 12 and 13 Chapters may serve for thy further experience?

CHAP. XV. Single Fellowship.
1. FELLOWSHIP is that Rule of Plural Proportion, whereby we balance Accounts
depending between diverse Persons having put together a general Stock, so that
they may every man have his Proportional part of gain, or sustain his
Proportional part of loss.

2. The Rule of Fellowship is either single, or it is double.

3. The single Rule is when the Stocks propounded are single numbers, without
any Respect or Relation to time.

4. In the single Rule of Fellowship, the Proportion is, As the whole Stock of
all the Partners, is in Proportion to the total Gain or Loss, so is each man's
particular share in the Stock, to his particular share in the Gain or Loss.
Therefore take the total of all the Stocks for the first term in the Rule of 3,
and the whole Gain or Loss for the second term, and the particular Stock of any
one of the partners for the third term, then Multiply and Divide according to
the 7 Rule of the 9th. Chapter, and the 4th. Proportional number is the
particular Loss or Gain of him whose Stock you m^de your second number,
wherefore repeat the Rule of 3 as often as there are particular Stocks, or
Partners in the question, and the 4th. terms produced upon the several
operations, are the Respective Gain or Loss of those particular Stocks given,
as in the Examples following.

Quest. 1. Two Persons, viz. A and B bought a tun of wine, for 20 l. of which A
paid 12 l. and B paid 8 l. and they gained in the Sale thereof 5 l. now I
demand each man's share in the Gains according to his Stock?

First I find the sum of their Stocks, by adding them together, viz. ^ 12 l.
and 8 l. which are 20 l. then according to this Rule I say first, If 20 l. (the
sum of their Stocks) Require 5 l. the total gain how much will 12 l. (the Stock
of A) Require? Multiply and Divide by the seventh Rule of the ninth Chapter,
and the Answ^^ is 3 l. ^ for the (...) of A in the gains; then again I say, If
20 l. Require 5 l. what will 8 l. Require? the Answer is 2 l. which is the gain
of B. So I conclude that the share o^ A in the gain is 3 l. and the share of B
in the gain is 2 l.

Quest. 2. Three Merchants, viz. A, B and C, enter a joint Adventure; A, put
into the the common stock 78 l. B, put in 117 l. and C, put in 234 l. and they
find (when they make up their Accounts) that they have gained in all 264 l. now
I desire to know each man's particular share in the gains?

First I add their Particular stocks together, and their sum is 429 l. ^ then
say, If 429 l. gain 264 l. what will 78 l. gain? and what 117 l. and what will
234 l. (the stocks of A, B, and C) gain? work by 3 several Rules of 3 and you
will find that ^

Quest. 3. Four Partners, viz. A, B, C, and D, between them build a Ship, which
cost 1730 l. of which A paid 346 l. B 519 l. C 692 l. and D 173 l. and her
Freight for a certain Voyage is 370 l. which is due to the Owners, or builders,
I demand each man's share therein according to his charge in building her?

Answer
^

Quest. 4. A, B, and C, enter Partnership for a certain time, A put into the
common stock 364 l. B put in 482 l. C put in 500 l. and they gained 867 l. now
I demand each man's share in the gain, Proportionable to his Stock?

Answer.
l. s. d. A 234 09 3 354/1346 B 310 09 5 ^^^/1346 C 322 01 3 930/1346 Sum 867
00 0

5. To prove the Rule of Single Fellowship, add each man's Particular gains or
loss together, and if the sum total is equal to the general gain or loss, The
proof of the Rule (...) Single Fellowship.
then is the work Rightly perfomed, but otherwise it is erroneous. Example in
the first question of this Chapter, the Answer was that the gain of A was 3 l.
and the gain of B 2 l. which added together make 5 l. equal to the total gain
given.

If in finding out the Particular shares of the several Partners, any thing
Remain after Division is ended, such Remainders must be added together (they
being all Fractions of the same denomination) and their sum divide by the
Common divisor in each question ( viz. the total stock) and the Quotient add to
the Particular gains, and then if the Total sum is equal to the total gain the
work is Right otherwise not.

As in the last question, the Remainders were 354, 62, and 930 which added
together make 1346 which divided by 1346 (the sum of their Stocks) the quotient
is 1 d. which I add to the pence etc. and the sum of their shares is 867 equal
to the Total gain; wherefore the work is Right.

CHAP. XVI. Double Fellowship.
1. DOUBLE Fellowship, is when several persons enter into Partnership for
unequal time, that is, when every man's Particular stock has Relation to a
Particular time.

2. In the Double Rule of Fellowship, multiply each Particular stock by its
Respective time, and having added the several products together make the^r sum
the first number (or term) in the Rule of 3, and the Total gain or loss the
second number, and the Product of any ones particular stock by his time, the
third term and the 4th number in Proportion thereunto is his Particular gain or
loss, whose Product of stock and time is your third number.

Then Repeat (as in single Fellowship) the Rule of 3 as often as there are
products (or partners) and the 4th. terms Invented are the numbers Required.
Example.

Quest. 1. A and B enter Partnership, A put in 40 l. for 3 months, B put in 75
l. for 4 Months, and they gained 70 l. now I demand each man's share in the
gains, proportionable to his stock and time? Answer A 20 l. B 50 l.

To Resolve this question I first multiply the stock of A ( viz. 40 l.) by its
time (3 Months) the product ^ is 120, then I multiply the stock of B by its
time ( viz. 75 by 4) and it produces 300, which I add to the Product of A his
stock and time, the sum is 420. Then by the Rule of 3 I say; As 420 (the sum of
the products is to 70 (the total gain) so is 120 (the product of A his Stock
and time) to 20 l. the share of A in the gains. Then I say again, As 420 is to
70, so is 300 to 50 l. the share of B in the gains.

Quest. 2. A, B, and C, make a Stock for 12 Months, A put in at first 364 l.
and 4 Months after that he put in 40 l. B put in at first 408 l. and at the
end of 7 Months he took out 86 l. C put in at first 148 l. and 3 Months after
he put in 86 l. more, and 5 M. after that he put in 100 l. more, and at the end
of 12 Months their gain is found to be 1436 l. I desire to know each man's
share in the gains according to his stock and his time?

First I consider, that the whole time of their Partnership is 12 Months. Then
I proceed to find out the several products of stock and time as follows.

A, had at first 364 l. for 4 Months wherefore their product is 1456 Then he
put in 40 l. which with the first sum makes 404 l. which continued the
Remainder of the time, viz. 8 Months, and their product is 3232 The sum of the
products of the stock and time of A is 4688 B, had 408 l. in 7 Months whose
product is 2856 And then took out 86 l., therefore he left in Stock 322 l.
which Continued the Rest of the time viz. 5 Months, whose product is 1610 The
Sum of the Products of the stock and time of B is 4466 C* put in 148 l. for 3
Mon. whose product being multiplied, is 444 Then he put in 86 l. which added to
the first ( viz. 148) makes 234 l. which lay in stock 5 mon. their product is
1170 Then he put in 100 l. more, so then he had in stock 334 l. which continued
the Remainder of the time ( viz. 4 months) which multiplied together produce
1336 The sum of the product of the money and time of C is 2950 B 4466 A 4688
The Total sum of all the product is 12104

Then I say, As 12104 is to 1436 (the total gain) so is 2950 to the share of A
in the gains, etc. go on as in the foregoing Examples, and you will find their
shares in the gain to be as follows, viz.

Answer.
l. s. d. The share of A is 556 03 6 6192/121^4 B 529 16 9 5496/21^4 C 349 19 8
416/2104 1436 00 0

Quest. 3. Three Grasiers A, B, and C, Take a piece of Ground for 46 l. 10 s.
in which A put 12 Oxen for 8 months, B put in 16 Oxen for 5 months, and C put
18 Oxen for 4 months, now the question is, what shall each man pay of the 46
l. 10 s- for the Ground?

Answer.
l. s. A shall pay 18 00 B 15 00 C 13 10 46 10

3. The Proof of this Rule is the same with that of Single Fellowship, laid
down in the 5th. Rule of the 15th. Chapter, and note that

If a loss be sustained instead of gain amongst Partners, every man's share to
be be born in the loss, is to be found after the same method as their gain,
whether their stocks be for equal or unequal time.

CHAP. XVII. Allegation Medial.
1. THE Rule of Allegation is that Rule in Pl^ral proportion, by which we
Resolve questions, wherein is a composition or mixture of diverse simples, as
also it is useful in the Composition of medicines both for quantity, quallity,
and price. And its species are two, viz. Medial and Alternate.

2. Alligation Medial is when having the several quantities, and prises of
several simples propounded we discover the mean price, or Rate of any quantity
of the mixture compounded of those simples and the proportion is

As the sum of the simples to be mingled is to the Total value of all the
simples, so is any part, or quantity of the Composition or mixture, to its mean
Rate or Price.

Quest. 1. A Farmer mingleth 20 bushels of wheat at 5 s. per bushel and 36
bushels of Rye at 3 s. per bushel, with 40 bushels of barley at 2 s. per
bushel, now I desire to know what one bushel of that mixture is worth?

To Resolve this question, add together the given quantities and also their
values, which is 96 bushels, whose total value is 14 l. 8 s. as appears by
the work following, for bush. l. s. 20 of wheat at 5 s. per bush. is 05 00 36
of Rye at 3 s. per bush. is 05 08 40 of barley at 2 s. per bush. is 04 00 The
sum of the given quantities is 96 and their value is 14 08

Then say by the Rule of 3 Direct.

If 96 Bushels cost (or is worth) 14 l. 8 s. what is 1 Bushel worth?

^

Quest 2. A Vintner mingleth 15 gallons of Canary at 8 s. per gallon with 20
gallons of Malligo at 7 s. 4 d. per gallon, with 10 gallons of Sh^rry at 6 s. 8
d. per gallon^ and 24 gallons of white wine at 4 s. per gallon* now I demand
what a gallon of that mixture is worth? work as in the last Quest. and you will
find the Answer to be 6 s. 2 d. 2 qrs. 4^/6^.

Quest. 3. A Grocer has mingled 3 C. of Sugar at 56 s. per C. with 4 C. of the
Sugar at 3 l. 14 s. 8 d. per C. and with 6 C. at 1 l. 17 s. 4 d. per C. I
desire to know the price of a hundred weight of that mixture? Answer. 2 l. 13
s. 1 d. 7/13.

3. The proof of this operation is by the price of any quantity of the mixture
to find out the total value of the whole composition, The proof of Alleg.
Medial.
and if it is equal to the total value of the several simples, the work is
right, otherwise not. As in the first example, the Answer to the quest. was
that 3 s. is the price of one bushel, wherefore I say by the rule of
proportion, If 1 bushel be 3 shillings, what is 96 bushels. Answ. 14 l. 8 s
which is the total value of the several simples, wherefore the work is right.

CHAP. XVIII. Allegation Alternate.
1. ALlegation alternate is when there are given the particular prises of
several simples, and thereby we discover such quantities of those simples, as
being mingled together shall bear a certain rate propounded.

2. When such a question is stated, place the given prises of the simples one
over the other, and the propounded price of the Composition against them in
such sort that it may represent a root and they so many branches springing from
it as in the following example.

Quest. 1. A certain Farmer is desirous to mix 20 bushels of wheat at 5 s. or
60 d. per bushel with rye at 3 s. or 36 d. per bush. and with Barley at 2 s. or
24 d. per bushel, and Oats at 1 s. 6 d. per bushel, and desires to mix such a
quantity of Rye, Barley and Oats with the 20 bushels of wheat as that the whole
composition may be worth 2 s. 8 d. or 32 d. per bushel.

The prises of the simples being placed according to the last rule, with the
price of the composition propounded as a root to them will stand as follows, ^

3. Having thus placed the given numbers you are to link or combine the several
rates of the simples the one to the other, by certain arches in such sort that
one that is lesser then the root, (or mean rate) may be linked or coupled to
another that is greater then the mean rate, so the question last propounded
will stand, ^

4. Then take the difference between the root and the several branches, and
place that difference against the number or branch, with which it is coupled,
or linked, and having taken all the differences and placed them as aforesaid,
then those differences so placed, will show you the number of each simple to be
taken to make a composition to bear the mean rate propounded.

So the branches of the last question being linked together as in the first
manner, I say the difference ^ between 32 and 60 is 28 which I put against 18
because 60 is linked with 18, then the difference between 32 and 36 is 4 which,
I put against 24 because 36 is linked or coupled with 24, then I say the
difference between 32 and 24 is 8 which I place against 36 (for the reason
aforesaid) then I say the difference between 32 and 18 is 14 which I place
against 60; and then the work will stand as you see in the margent.

So I conclude that a composition made of 14 bushels of wheat at 60 d. per
bushel, and 8 bushel of Rye at 36 d. per bushel and 4 bushels of Barley at 24 d.
per bushel, and 28 bushels of Oats at 18 d. per bushel, will bear the mean
price of 32 d. or 2 s. 8 d. per bushel. And here observe that in this
composition there is but 14 bushels of wheat, but I would mingle 20 bushels,
and this kind (or rather case) of Allegation alternate ( viz. when there is
given a certain quantity of one of the simples, and the quantities of the rest
sought to mingle with this given quantity that the whole may bear a price
propounded) is called alternation partial.

And the proportion to find out the several quantities to be mingled with the
given quantity is as follows, viz.

As the difference annexed to the branch that is the vallue of an integer of
the given quantity is to the other particular differences, so is the quantity
given, to the several quantities required.

So here, to find out how much Rye; barley, and Oats must be mingled with the 20
bushels of wheat, I say by the single rule of three direct, if 14 bushels of
wheat require 8 bushels of Rye, what will 20 bush. of wheat require? answer 11
6/14 bushels of rye.

Again, if 14 bushels of wheat require 4 bushels of barley what will 20 bushels
of wheat require? answer 5 10/14 bushels of barley. Again, I say, if 14 bushels
of wheat require 28 bushels of Oats, what will 20 bushels of wheat require?
answer 40 bushels of barley.

And now I say that 20 bushels of wheat mingled with 11 6/14 bushels of rye,
and 5 10/14 bushels of barley, and 40 bushels of oats each bearing the rates as
aforesaid, will make a composition or heap of Corn that may yield 32 d. per
bushel.

But if the branches had been coupled according to the second order, or manner,
then the differences would have been thus placed, viz. the differences ^
between 32 and 60 is 28 which I set against 24 because 60 is linked thereto,
and the difference between 32 and 36 is 4 which I set against 18, and the
difference between 32 and 24 is 8, which I set against 60, then the difference
between 32 and 18 is 14 which I set against his yoke fellow 36, and then I
conclude that if you mix 8 bushels of wheat with 14 bushels of Rye, 28 bushels
of barley, and 4 bushels of oats each bearing the foresaid prises the whole
mixture may be sold for 32 d. per bushel as by the work in the margent.

You see by this work we have found how many bushels of rye, barley, and oats,
ought to be mixed with 8 bushels of wheat, and to find out how many of each
ought to to be mixed with 20 bushel of wheat I say, As 8 is to 14 so is 20 to
35 bushels of rye. As 8 is to 28 so is 20 to 70 bushels of barley. As 8 is to 4
so is 20 to 10 bushels of oats. whereby I conclude that if to 20 bushels of
wheat I put 35 bushels of rye, 70 bushels of barley, and 10 bushels of oats
bearing each the foresaid prises per bush. that then a bush. of this mixture
will be worth 32 d. or 2 s. 8d.

And if the branches had been linked as you see in the third place, where each
branch bigger then the root, is linked to two that are lesser then the root,
then in this case you must have placed the several differences between the root
and branches, against those 2 with which each is coupled, as first the
difference between 32 and 60 is 28 which I Put against 24 and 18 because it is
^ coupled with them both, then the difference between 32 and 36 is 4 which I
set likewise against 24 and 18, because 36 is linked to to them both then the
differenee between 32 and 24 is 8 which I put against 60 and 36 because 24 is
linked to them both, then the difference between 32 and 18 is 14 which I put
against 60 and 36 the yoke fellows of 18.

Lastly, I draw a line behind the differences and add the differences which
stand against each branch and put the sum behind the said line against its
proper branch as you see in the margent.

And now by this work I find that 22 bushels of wheat mingled with 22 bushels
of rye, and 32 bushels of barley, and 32 bushels of oats each bearing the said
price will make a mixture bearing the mean rate of 32 d. per bushel.

And to find how much of each of the rest must be mingled with 20 bushels of
wheat I say

As 22 is to 22 so is 20 to 20 bush of rye.

As 22 is to 32 so is 20 to 29 2/22 bush. of barley. As 22 is to 32 so is 20 to
29 2/32 bushels of Oats.

Whereby you see the questions of Allegation alternate will admit of more true
answers then one for we have found 3 several answers to this first question.

Question of alternation partial are proved the same way with questions in
Allegation medial, which you may see in the 3 rule of the 17 Chap. The proof of
alternation partial.


Quest. 2. A Grocer has 4 sorts of Sugar, viz. of 12 d. per l. of 10 d. per l.
of 6 d. per l. and of 4 d. per l. and he would have a composition worth 8 d.
per pound the whole quantity whereof should contain 144 l. made of these 4
sorts, I demand how much of each he must take?

Questions of this nature are resolved by that part of all^gation alternate
called by Arithmeticians alternation total, viz. where there is given the sum,
and prises of several simples, to find out how much of each simple ought to be
taken to make the said sum, or quantity, so that it may bear a certain rate
propounded.

To resolve this question I place the several prises of the simples, and mean
rate propounded, and link them together as is directed in the 2 and 3 rules of
this Chapter, and place the differences between the root and branches according
to the 4 rule of this Chapter, which will then stand one of these 3 ways, viz. ^

5. Then add the several^ differences together which I have done, and the sums
of the first and second order are 12 l. and of the third 24 l. as you may see
above, but it required that there should be 144 l. of the composition,
therefore to find the quantity of each simples to make the whole composition
144 l. observe this general rule, viz.

As the sum of the differences, is to the several differences, so is the total
quantity of the composition, to the quantity of each simple.

So to find how much of each sort of Sugar I ought to take to make 144 l. at 8
d. per l. I say

l.

As 12 is to 4, so is 144 to 48 l. at 12 d. per l. As 12 is to 2, so is 144 to
24 l. at 10 d. per l. As 12 is to 2, so is 144 to 24 l. at 6 d. per l. As 12 is
to 4, so is 144 to 48 l. at 4 d. per l.

Whereby I find that 48 l. at 12 d. per l. and 24 l. at 10 d. per l. and 24 l.
at 6 d per l. and 48 l. at 4 d. per l. will make a composition of Sugar
containing 144 l. worth 8 d. per l.

But as the branches are linked in the second order, the Answer will be 24 l.
at 12 d. per l. and 48 l. at 10 d. per l. and 48 l. at 6 d. per l. and 24 l. at
4 d. per l. to make the said quantity, and to bear the said price^

And if you had worked as the branches are linked after the third order then
you would have found the quantity of 36 l. of each.

Quest. 3. A Vintner has 4 sorts of wine, viz. Canary at 10 s. per gallon,
Mallaga at 8 s. per gallon; Rhenish wine at 6 s. per gallon, and white wine at
4 s. per gallon; and he is minded to make a Composition of them all of 60
gallons that may be worth 5 shillings per gallon, I desire to know how much of
each he must have?

The numbers or terms being ranked according to the second Rule of this
Chapter, the branches will be linked as follows, and will admit of no other
manner of coupling, because there is but one branch that is lesser then the
Root, therefore all the rest must be linked unto it; and the differences
between the ^ Root and the three 1. branches, viz. 10, 8, and 6, which are 5,
3, and 1 must be set against 4 because they are all coupled wit^^^t, and the
difference between the Roo ( viz. 5) and ^ which is 1 must be set against the 3
other because it is linked to them all, so I find 1 gallon of Canary, 1 gallon
of Mal^aga, 1 gallon of Rhenish wine, and 9 gallons of White Wind, prised as
above, being min^led together will be worth 5 s. per gallon, the Sum being 12
gallons but there must be 60 gallons wherefore I say

As 12 is to 1, so is ^0 to 5 gallons of Can. As 12 is to 1, so is 60 to 5
gallons of M^ll. As 12 is to 1, so is 60 to 5 gallons of (...). As 12 is to 9,
so is 60 to 45 gallons of white wine.

So that 5 gallons of Canary, 5 gallons of Malliga, 5 gallons of Rhenish, and
45 gallons of white wine mingled together, will be in all 60 gallons, worth 5
s. per gallon, which was Required.

Quest. 4. A Goldsmith has Gold of 4 several sorts of finess, viz, of 24
Carects fine, Read Chap. 2. deff. 2. of this book.
and of 22 Carects fine, of 20 Carects fine, and of 15 Carects fine. And he
would mingle so much of each with alloy that the whole mass of 28 ounces of
gold so mingled may bear 17 Carects fine? the second and third Rules of this
Chapter being observed (for instead of the alloy I put 0 because it bears no
finess, but it makes a branch in the operation) the terms may be Allegated and
the differences added any of these 4 ways following.

^

^

More ways may be given for the Allegating, or linking of the terms in this
question, but these are sufficient, and it shall also suffice to give an Answer
to the question as the terms are linked the first way, not doubting but the
ingenious practitioner will be able at his leisure, to find Answers to the
other 3 ways, viz, oz. p.w. Car. As 56 is to 17, so is 28 to 8 10 of 24 As 56
is to 2 so is 28 to 1 00 of 22 As 56 is to 19, so is 28 to 9 10 of 20 As 56 is
to 8, so is 28 to 4 00 of 15 As 56 is to 10, so is 28 to 5 00 of alloy.

Thus much well practiced and understood, is sufficient for the understanding
of Allegation.

In questions of Alternation Total, the Answer is given true, when the sum of
each of the quantity of simples found, The proof of Alternation Total.
agrees with the Sum or Quantity propounded; as in the last Question, the
Answer was 8 oz. 10 p.w. of 24 Carrects fine, 1 oz. of 22 Carrects fine, 9 oz.
10 p.w. of 20 Carrects fine, 4 oz. of 15 Carrects fine, and 5 oz. of Alloy,
which added together make 28 oz. the quantity propounded.

CHAP. XIX. Reduction of Vulgar Fractions.
1. WHat a Vulgar fraction is, and its parts, and several kinds, has been
already showed in the 19, 20* 21, 22, 23, 24 and 31 definitions of the first
Chapter of this book, which the Learner is desired diligently to observe before
he proceed.

2. To Reduce a Vulgar fraction (which discovers the Principal knowledge of
fractions, and therefore ought greatly to be Regarded) we shall discover
plainly under these 8 several heads (or Rules) fol^owing, viz.

1. To Reduce a mixed number into an improper Fraction.

2. To Reduce a whole number into an Improper Fraction.

3. To Reduce an Improper fraction into its equivalent whole (or mixed) number.

4. To Reduce a Fraction into its lowest terms equivalent to the Fraction given.

5. To find the value of a Fraction in the known parts of Coin, Weight,
Measure, etc.

6. To Reduce a Compound Fraction to a simple one of the same value.

7. To Reduce diverse Fractions having unequal denominators, to fractions of the
same value having equal denomination.

8. To Reduce a Fraction of one denomination to another of the same value.

I. To Reduce a mixed Number to an Improper fraction.
The Rule is vide Chap. 1. defin. 31.

Multiply the Integral part (or whole Number) by the denominator of the
Fraction, and to the product add the Numerator, and that sum place over the
denominator, so this new fraction shall be equal to the mixed number given. As
for Example

1. Reduce 18 3/7 into an improper fraction, multiply the whole number 18 by 7
the denominator, and ^ to the product add the numerator 3 the sum is 129 which
put over the denominator 7 and it makes 129/7 for the answer as per margent.

2. Reduce 183 5/12 to an improper fraction facit. 2201/1^.

3. Reduce 56 13/21 to an improper fraction facit 1189/21.

II. To Reduce a whole number to an Improper fraction.
The Rule is
Multiply the given number, Vide Chapter 1. defin. 23.
by the intended denominator and place the product for a numerator over it, as
for example.

1. Let it be required to reduce 15 into a fraction whose denominator shall be
12. To effect which I multiply 15 by the intended denominator (12) the product
is 180 which I place over ^ 12 as a numerator and it makes 180/12 which is
equal to 15 which was required as per margent.

2. Reduce 36 into an improper fraction whose denominator shall be 20 facit
936/26.

3. Reduce 135 into an improper fraction whose denominator shall be 16 facit
2160/16.

III. To Reduce an improper fraction into its equivalent, whole or mixed number.
The rule is,
Divide the numerator by the denominator, and the quotient is the whole number
equal to the given fraction, and if any thing remain put it for a numerator
over the divisor, example.

1. Reduce 436/8 into its equivalent mixed number, divide the ^ numerator 436 by
the denominator 8 and the quotient is 54 and 4 remains which put for a
numerator, over the divisor 8 the answer 54 4/8 as per margent.

2. Reduce 3476/15 to a mixed number, facit 231 11/15.

3. Reduce 15576/136 to a mixed number, facit 114 72/136.

IIII. To Reduce a fraction into its lowest terms* equivalent to the fraction
given.
The Rule is.
1. If the numerator and denominator are even numbers take of the one and half
of the other as often as may be and when either of them falls out to be an odd
number, then divide them by any number that you can discover will divide both
numerator and denominator without any remainder; and when you have thus
proceeded as low as you can reduce them then this new fraction so found out
shall be the fraction you desire, and will be in vallue equal to the given
fraction, example.

1. Let it be required to reduce 192/336 into its lowest terms. 192 96 48 24 12
4 336 168 84 42 21 7 First I take the half of the numerator 192 and it is 96
then half of the denominator and it is 168, so that now it is brought to 96/168
and next to 48/84, and by halving still to 24/42 and their half is 12/21 and
now I can no longer half, it because 21 is an odd number, wherefore I try to
divide them by 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. and I find 3 divides them both without any
remainder, and brings them to 4/7 as per margent.

So I conclude 4/7 thus found to be equal in vallue to the given fractions
192/336.

2. What is 103^/1184 in its lowest terms? answer 7/8.

3. What is 1342/1586 in its lowest terms? answer 11/13.

There is yet another way more excellent then the former to reduce a fraction
into its lowest terms, Vide Ought. cla. Math. cap. 7.
and that is by finding a common measurer, viz. the greatest number that will
divide the numerator and denominator without any remainder, and by that means
reduce a fraction to its lowest terms at the first work, and to find out this
common measurer, divide the denominator by the numerator, and if any thing
remains divide your divisor thereby, and if any thing remains then divide your
last divisor by it, do so until you find nothing remains, then this last
divisor shall be the greatest common measurer, which will divide both numerator
denominator and reduce them into their lowest terms at one work.

Example.
4. Reduce 228/304 into its lowest terms by a common measurer. To effect which
I divide the denominator 304 by the numerator 228 and there remains 76, then I
divide 228, (the first divisor) by 76 (the remainder) and it quotes 3 and
remains nothing wherefore the last divisor 76 is the common measurer, by which
I divide the numerator of the given fraction, viz 228 it quotes 3 for a new
numerator, then I divide the denominator 304 by 76 and it quotes 4 for a new
denominator, so that now I have found equal to 228/304.

5. Reduce 6048/7392 into its lowest terms by a common measurer, facit 9/11.

6. Reduce 3081/20^82 into its lowest terms by a common measurer facit 13/6.

A Compendium.
Note that if the numerator and denominator of a fraction end each with a
Cipher or Ciphers then cut of as many ciphers from the one as from the other
and the remaining figures will be a fraction of the same vallue, viz. 3400/710^
will be found to be reduced to 34/71 by cutting of the 2 ciphers from the
numerator and denominator thus, 34/1700/00 and 460/700 will be 46/70 thus
4^/700/0 etc.

V. To find the vallue of a fraction in the known parts of Coin, weight, etc.
The rule is.
Multiply the numerator by the parts of the next inferior denomination that
are equal to an unit of the same denomination with the fraction, then divide
that product by the denominator, and the quote gives you its value, in the same
parts you multiplied by* and if any thing remain multiply it by the parts of
the next inferior denomination, and divide as before, do so till you can bring
it no lower and the several quotients will give you the vallue of the fraction
as was required, and if any thing at last remain place it for a numerator over
the former denominator, example.

1. What is the value of 27/29 l. Sterling? To Answer this question I multiply
the numerator 27 by 20 (the shi^^ings in a pound) the product is 540 which I
divide by 29 (the denominator) and the quotient is 18 s. and there Remains 18
which I multiply by 12 pence and the product (216) I divide by the denominator
29 the quotient is 7 d. and 13 Remains, which I multiply by 4 farthings, the
product is 52, which I still divide by 29, the quotient is 1 farthing, and
there Remains 23, which I put for a Numerator over the denominator 29, so I
find the vallue of 27/29 l. to be 18 s. 7 d. 1 qrs. 23/29 as per the following
operation.

^

2. What is the value of 11/15 l. Sterling? facit 14 s. 8 d.

VI. To Reduce a Compound Fraction to a simple one of the same value.
What a compound Fraction is, has been showed in Chap. 1. Definition 24, and
to Reduce it to a simple Fraction of the same value.

The Rule is,
Multiply the Numerators continually and place the last product for a new
Numerator, then multiply the denominators continually, and place the last
product for a new denominator. So this single Fraction shall be equal to the
compound fraction given. Example.

1. Reduce of of to a Simple Fraction.

Multiply the Numerators 2, 3, and 5 together, they make 30, for a new
Numerator; then I multiply the denominators 3, 5, and 8 together and their
product is 120 for a denominator, so the simple Fraction is 30/120 and cutting
off the Ciphers it is 3/^12 equal to.

^

2. What is 7/10 of 5/9 of 4/7 of 11/12 Answer 1540/7560 or 154/756 or 77/373.

3. What is 11/12 of 13/14 of 21/29 Answer 3003/4872.

By this you may know how to find the value of a Compound Fraction, viz. first
Reduce it to a simple one, and then find out his value by the 5 Rule foregoing.

4. What is the value of of of 9/10 of a pound Answer 11 s. 3 d.

VII. To Reduce Fractions of unequal denominators to Fractions of the same
value, having equal Denominators.
The Rule is,
Multiply all the denominators together, and the product shall be the Common
denominator? Then multiply each Numerator into all the denominators except its
own, and the last product put for a Numerator over the denominator found out as
before; So this new Fraction is equal to that fraction whose Numerator you
multiplied into the Denominators. Do so by all the Numerators given, and you
have your desire. Example,

1. Redu^^ ^/4 and into a common Denomination.

Multiply the Denominators 4, 5, 6, and 8 together continually, and the product
is 960 for the common Denominator; then multiply the Numerator 3 into the
Denominators 5, 6, and 8, and the product is 720, which is a Numerator to 960
(found as before) so 720/96^ is equal to the first fraction, then I proceed to
find a new Numerator to the second fraction, viz. 4, and I multiply 4 (into all
the denominators except its own; viz.) into 4, 6, and 8, which produces
768/960 equal to, then multiply the Numerator 5, into the denominators 4, 5,
and 8, the product is 800/960 equal to. Then multiply the Numerator 7 into the
denominators 4, 5, and 6, the product is 840/960 equal to and the work is done,
so that for and I have 720/960, 768/960 800/960 and 840/960.

2. Reduce 1114/1223 and 19/21 into a common denominator, faciunt 5313/5796
3528/5796 and 5244/5796.

VIII. To Reduce a fraction of one Denomination to another.
1. This is either Ascending, or Descending. Ascending when a fraction of a
smaller is brought to a greater Denomination; and Descending when a fraction of
a greater Denomination is brought lower.

2. When a fraction is to be brought from a lesser to a greater Denomination,
then make of it a Compound fraction, by comparing it with the intermediate
Denominations between it, and that you would have it Reduced to, then (by the 6
Rule foregoing) Reduce your compound to a simple fraction, and the work is
done. Example.

Quest. 1. It is Required to know what part of a pound sterling 5/7 of a penny
is?

To Resolve this, I consider that 1 d. is 1/12 of a shilling, and a shilling is
1/20 of a pound; wherefore 5/7 d. is 5/7 of 1/12 of 1/20 of a pound, which by
the said 6th. Rule I find to be 7/1680 l.

Quest. 2. What part of a pound Troy weight is of a penny weight? Answer of 1/20
of 1/12 l. equal to 4/1200 l. Troy.

3. When a fraction is to be brought from a greater to a lesser denomination,
then multiply the Numerator by the parts contained in the several denominations
betwixt it, and that you would reduce it to, then place the last product over
the denominator of the given fraction. Example,

Quest. 3. I would reduce l. to the Fraction of a penny? to do which I multiply
the Numerator 3 by 20 and 12 the product is 720 which I put over the
denominator 5 it makes 720/5 of a penny, equal to l.

Quest. 4. What parts of an ounce Troy is l.? Answer 60/^6 oz.

CHAP. XX. Addition of Vulgar Fractions.
1. IF your Fractions to be added have a common Denominator, then add all the
Numerators together, and place their sum for a Numerator to the common
Denominator, which new Fraction is the sum of all the given Fractions; and if
it be Improper, Reduce it to a whole, or mixed Number, by the 3 Rule of the 19
Chap.

Quest. 1. What is the sum of 7/24 9/24 16/24 and 14/24?

The Denominators are equal, viz. 24, wherefore add the Numerators together,
viz. 7, 9, 16, and ^4* their sum is 46, which put over the Denominator 24, it
makes 4^/21 the sum of the given Fractions, which will be Reduced to the mixed
Number 1 22/24 or 1 11/12.

2. But if the Fractions to be added have unequal Denominators, then Reduce
them to a common Denominator, by the 7th. Rule of the 19th. Chap. and then add
the Numerators together, and put the sum over the common Denominator, etc. as
before.

Quest. 2. What is the sum of 9/10 and 11/12?

The fractions Reduced to a common Denominator are 2880/4800 4200/4800
4320/4800 and 4400/480^, the sum of their Numerators is 15800 which put over
the common Denominator makes 15800/4800 or 158/48 equal to the mixed Number 3
14/48 or 3 7/24 for the sum Required.

Quest. 3. What is the sum of 13/17 21/49 and 3/47? Answer 1 37555/3915^.

3. If you are to add mixed Numbers together, then add the fractional parts as

and add its Integral part to the Integral parts of the given mixed Numbers, and
the work is done.

Quest. 4. What is the sum of 13 and 24?

First add the fractions and, sum is 1 12/32 then add this Integer 1, to 13 and
24 their sum is 38, and put after it the fraction 12/32 it is 38 12/32 for the
Answer.

Quest. 5. What is the sum of 48 3/7 64 and 130 2/^? Facit 243 180/224.

be Reduced to a Simple Fraction by the 6th. Rule of Chapter 19, and then add it
to the Rest according to the 2d Rule of this Chapter. Example,

Quest. 6. What is the sum of 4/6 and of of?

Reduce 7/^ of of into a simple Fraction, and it is 105/192 which Reduced with
the other two, and added are 1 2766/5760.

Quest. 7. What is the sum of 11/12 and of of 5/^? Answer 1 4/12.

5. If the Fractions to be added are not of one denomination, they must be so
Reduced, and then proceed as before.

Quest. 8. What is the sum of l. and s.?

Here of the given Fractions, one is of a pound, and the other the fraction of
a shilling; and before you can add them together, you must Reduce s. to the
fraction of a pound as the other is by the 8 Rule of Chapter 19, and it makes
5/120 l. then l. and 5/120 l. will be found to be 380/480 l. or 38/^8 l. by the
7th. Rule of Chapter 19, and in its lowest terms 19/24 l. by the 4 Rule of
Chapter 19.

It would have been the same, if (by the latter part of the 8th. Rule of
Chapter 19) you had Reduced l. to the fraction of a shilling, which you would
have found to have been 60/4 s. which added to s. by the said 7th. Rule of the
last Chapter the sum is 15 s. 30/24 which is equal to the sum found as before,
viz. 19/24 l. for (by the 5th. Rule of Chapter 19) the vallue of 19/24 l. will
be found to be 15 s. 10 d. and so will 15 s. 20/24 be found to be just as much.

Quest. 9. What is the sum of l. s. and d.? Answer 379500/600000 or 3795/6000 l.

CHAP. XXI. Subtraction of vulgar fractions.
1. THe rules in Addition for reducing the given fractions to one denomination
are here to be observed; for before Subtraction can be made, the fractions must
be reduced to a common denominator, then Subtract one numerator from the other,
and place the remainder over the common denominator, which fraction shall be
the excess or difference between the given fractions, example.

Quest. 1. What is the difference between and 5/7? the given fractions are
reduced to 21/^8 and 20/^8, then Subtract the numerator 20 from the numerator
21, and there remains 1 which put over the denominator 28 makes 1/28 for the
answer, or difference between and 5/7.

Quest. 2. What is the difference between and of?

Reduce the compound fraction of to a simple fraction, then proceed as bebefore
the answer is 110/240 equal to 11/24.

2. When a fraction is given to be Subtracted from a whole number subtract the
numerator from the denominator and put the remainder for a numerator to the
given denominator, and Subtract a unit (for that you borrowed) from the whole
number, and the remainder place before the fraction found as before which mixed
number is the remainder or difference sought, example.

Quest. 3. Subtract 7/10 from 48?

Answer, 47 3/10 for if you Subtract 7 (the numerator) from 10 (the
denominator) remains 3, which put over 10 is 3/10 and 1 (I borrowed) from 48
rests 47, to which join 3/10 makes 47 3/10 for the excess.

Quest. 4. Subtract 13/21 from 57? remains 56 8/^1.

3. If it is required to Subtract a fraction from a mixed number, or one mixed
Number from another reduce the (...) fractions to a common denominator, and if
the fraction to be Subtracted be lesser then the other, then Subtract the
lesser numerator from the greater and that is ^ numerator for the common
denominator; then Subtract the lesser integral (...) from the greater, and the
remainder (...) the remaining fraction annexed is the difference required
between the two given mixed numbers, examp^e.

Quest. 5. Subtract 26 3/^ from 54?

First, Subtract 3/^ viz. 18/^^ from ^/6 viz. 3^/4^ the remainder is 17/^2 then
26 from 54 remains 28 to which annex 17/4^ it makes 28 17/42 for the Answer.

4. But if the fraction to be Subtracted is greater then the fraction from
whence you subtract, then take the numerator of the greater fraction out of the
denominator, and add the remainder to the numerator of the lesser fraction, and
their sum is a new numerator to the common denominator, which fraction note,
then (for the unit you borrowed) add 1 to the integral part to be subtracted,
and subtract it from the greater number, and annex the remainder to the
fraction you noted before, so this new mixed number shall be the difference
sought, Example.

Quest. 6. Subtract 14 from 29 4/7?

The fractions reduced are viz. equal to 21/28 and 4/7 equal to 16/28, now I
should subtract 21/2^ from 1^/28 but I cannot therefore I subtract 21 from 28
rests 7 which added to 16 (the lesser numerator) makes 23 for a numerator to 28
viz. 23/28 then I come to the Integral parts 14 and 29 and say 1 that I
borrowed and 15 from 29 rests 14 to which annexing 23/28 it is 14 23/28 for the
remainder or difference between 14 and 29 4/7.

Quest. 7. Subtract 36 9/10 from 74 4/9 facit 37 49/90.

CHAP. XXII. Multiplication of Vulgar Fractions.

product (25) is a numerator for the quotient, then I multiply (8) the
denominator of the dividend into (3) the numerator of the divisor and the
product (24) I put in the quotient for a denominator, so I find 25/24 is the
quotient sought. Q. What is the quotient of 16/21 divided by? A. 30/42 equal to
5/7 in its lowest terms.

2. But if you would divide a simple fraction by a compound, or a compound by a

CHAP. XXV. The Rule of Three Inverse in fractions.
1. IT has bin already taught (in the 3 rule of the 11 Ch.) how to discover
when the 4th proportional number (to the 3 given numbers) is to be found out by
a Rule of 3 direct, and when by a Rule of 3 inverse to which Rule the learner
is now referred.

Inverse, viz. when the third term is the divisor, then (having reduced the
terms exactly according to the Rules in Chap 24.) multiply the numerator of the
3 fractions into the denominators of the second and first fractions, and the
product is a new denominator, then multiply the denominator of the third
fraction into the numerators of the second and first fractions, and the product
is a new numerator, which new fraction thus found is the Answer to the question.

CHAP. XXVI. Rules of Practice.
1. IN the single Rule of 3 when the first of the 3 numbers in the question
(after they are disposed according to the 6 Rule of the 10 ch.) happens to be
a unit (or 1) that question many times may be resolved far more speedily then
by the Rule of 3, which kind of operation is commonly called Practice, and
indeed it is of excellent use amongst Merchants, Tradesmen and others, by
reason of its speediness in finding a resolution to such kind of questions.

2. The chiefest question resolveable by these brief Rules may be comprehended
under the seven general heads or cases following ( viz.)

When the given price of the integer Consists.
1 Of farthings under 4 2 Of pence under 12 3 Of pence and farthings 4 Of
shillings under 20 5 Of shill. pence and farthings 6 Of Pounds 7 Of pounds,
shillings, pence and farthings.
It would be very convenient for the practical Arithmetician, to have by heart
the several products of the 9 digits multiplied by 12, for his speedy reducing
pence into shillings or shillings into pence, which he may gain by the
following Table.

12 Times 1 is 12 2 24 3 36 4 48 5 60 6 72 7 84 8 96 9 108

3. Shillings are practically reduced into pounds thus, viz. cut of the figure
standing in the place of units with a dash of the pen and note it for
shillings, then draw a line under the given number and take half of the
remaining figures ^ (after the first is cut off) and set them under the line,
and they are so many pounds, but if the last figure is odd, then take the
lesser half and add 10 to the figure so cut off (as before) for shill^ngs, as
if I were to reduce 43658 shillings into pounds, first I cut of the last figure
(8) for shillings, then I take half of the remaining figures (4365) thus half
of 4 is 2, which I put under the line, then of 3 is 1, and because 3 is an odd
number I make the next figure 6 to be 16, and go on saying of 16 is 8, and then
of 5 is 2 which is the last figure, wherefore because 5 is an odd number I add
10 to the 8 I cut off and it makes 18 s. so that I find it to be 2182 l. 18 s.
as per margent.

4. It is likewise Convenient that the Learner be acquainted with the Practical
Tables following, the first containing the Aliquot (or even) parts of a
shilling, the second containing the Aliquot parts of a pound.

d. s. The even parts of a shilling. 6 is 4 3 2 1 1 1 s. d. l. The even parts
of a pound. 10 00 is 6 08 5 00 4 00 3 04 2 06 2 00 1/10 1 08 1/12 1 00 1/20

Case 1.
5. When the price of the Integer is a farthing, then take the sixth part of
the given Number which will be so many three half pence, and if any thing
Remains it is farthings by the 7th. Rule of Chapter 9, then consider that three
halfpence is of a shilling, wherefore take the eighth parts of them for
shillings, and if any thing Remain, they are so many 3 halfpence, which Reduce
into pounds by the 3d Rule foregoing. Example 67486 l. at a farthing per l.
First I take of 67486, and it is 11247 three halfpence and 4 farthings, or 1
penny, then of 11247 is 1405 s. and 7 Remains, which is 7 three half penies or
10 d. which with the 4 farthings before make 11 and 1405 shillings which by the
3 Rule is 70 l. 5 s. In all 70 l. 5 s. 11 d. for the Answer, See the work
following.

^

Other Examples follow.
^

6. When the price of the Integer is 2 farthings, then take the third part of
the given Number for so many three halfpence, and the Remainder (if any) is
halfpence, then take the eighth part of that for shillings as before, etc.

Examples.
^

7. When the price of the Integer is 3 farthings then take half the given
Number for three half-penies (and if any thing Remain it is 3 farthings, then
take the eighth of that for shillings as before, etc.

Examples.
^

Case 2.
8. When the given price of the Integer, is a part, or parts of a shilling (
viz. pence) divide the given Number of Integers (whose value is sought) by the
denominator, of the fraction Representing the even part, and the quote is
shillings, (always minding the 7th. Rule of Chapter 9) and those shillings
may be Reduced to l. by the 3 Rule of this Chapter. Example, Let it be Required
to find the value of 438 l. at 3 d. per l. I consider 3 d. is of a shilling,
and 438 l. will cost so many 3 pences, wherefore I divide 438 by 4 the
denominator of and the quote is 109 shillings, and 2 Remains, which is 2 three
pences or 6 d. the whole value is 5 l. 9 s. 6 d. as by the following work
appears ^

More Examples follow.
^

9. If the price of the Integer be pence under 12 and yet not an even part,
then it may be divided into even parts, and so the parts of the given Number
taken accordingly, and added together as if it were 5 d.; which is 3 d. and 2
d. viz. and of a shilling, first take of the given Number, and then thereof,
and add them together, and their sum is the Answer in shillings, still
observing Rule 7 of Chap. 9. for the Remainders (if any be) then bring the
shillings into pounds by the 3 Rule foregoing. Likewise 7 d. is and so 9 d. is
and ^/4 and 10 d. is and and 11 d. is and and of a shilling, as in the
following Examples, viz.

^

Case 3.
10. When the price of the integer is pence and farthings, if it make an even
part of a shilling work as before, but if they are uneven as penny farthing,
penny three farthings, 2 d. 1 qrs. or 2 d. 3 qrs. 3 d. 3 qrs. or the l^ke, then
first work for some even part, and then consider what part the rest is of that
even part, and divide that quotient thereby, then add them together and reduce
them to pounds as before, example 3470 l. at 1 d. 1 qrs. per l. first I work
for the penny by dividing 3470 by 12 for 1 d. is 1/1^ of a shilling, and the
quote is 289 s. 2 d. then I conceive ^ that 1 farthing is of a penny, and the
vallue at 1 farthing, will be of the vallue at 1 penny and therefo^^ I take of
289 s. 2 d. which is 72 s. 3 d. 2 qrs. and add them together and they are 18 l.
1 s. 5 d. 2 qrs. as by the margent, other examples in the same nature follow.

^

Case 4.
11. When the price of the Integer is 2 s. then cut of the figure in the place
of units of the given number, and double it for shillings, and the figures of
the other hand are pounds, example 436 yds at 2 s. per yd. cut of the last
figure 6 and ^ double it, it makes 12 shill. and the other 2 figures, viz 43
are so many pounds so that their vallue is 43 l. 12 s. as per margent.

12. Hence it is evident that (when the given price of the integer is an even
number of shillings then) if you take half of that (even) number of shillings,
and multiply the given number of integers thereby, doubling the first figure of
the product and setting it a part for shill. the rest of the product will be
pounds, which pounds and shill. is the vallue sought, example, what cost 536
yds. at 8 s. per yd.? to resolve which I take of 8 s. (the price of a yd.)
which is 4 and multiply 536 thereby, saying 4 times 6 is 24 then I double the
first figure 4 makes 8 for shill. and carry 2 to the ^ next product etc. I find
the rest of the product to be 214 which I note for pounds so the vallue of 536
yds. at 8 s. per yd. is 214 l. 8 s. as per margent, more examples follow.

56 yds. at 6 s. per yd./16 l. 16 s. facit. 420 yds. at 12 s. per yd./252 l.
facit. 123 yds at 4 s. per yrd./24 l. 12 s. facit. 326 yds. at 14 s. per
yd./228 l. 4 s. facit. 48 else at 8 s. per ell./19 l. 4 s. facit. 48 yds. at 16
s. per yd./38 l. 8 s. facit. 84 yds. at 10 s. per yd./42 l. facit. 52 yds. at
18 s. per yd./46 l. 16 s.

13. If the given price of the integer is an odd number of shillings, then work
first for the even number of shillings by the last Rule, and for the odd
shilling take 1/20 of the given number of integers according to the 3 Rule of
this Chapter and add them together and you have your desire, examples follow.

^

14. Except when the given price of the Integer is 5 s. for then it is sooner
answered by taking of the given Number whose value is sought, as in the
following Example.

^

Case, 5.
15. When the given price of an integer is shillings and pence, or shillings,
pence, and farthings, then if the shillings and pence be an even part of a
pound divide the given number of integers whose value you seek by the
denominator of that fraction representing that even part, as for example, what
is the price of 384 yds at 6 s. 8 d. per yd.? here I consider that 6 s. 8 d. is
of a pound wherefore I divide 384 by 3 and the quote is the answer viz. ^ 128
l. so that 384 yds. at 6 s. 8 d. per yd. amounts to 128 l. per margent, still
observing the 7 Rule of the 9 Chap.

More Examples follow.
^

16. When the given value of the Integer is shillings and pence, and not an
even part of a pound, yet many times it may be divided into parts ( viz. 6 s. 6
d. is 4 s. and 2 s. 6 d. for the 4 s. work according to the 12 Rules foregoing*
and for the 2 s. 6 d. take the eighth part of the given Number and add them
together their sum is the value Required.)

So 8 s. 6 d. will be divided into 6 s. and 2 s. 6 d. and the price of the
given Number may be found out as before, etc. Examples follow.

^

17. When the given price of the Integer is shillings and pence, and you cannot
Readily divide them according to the last Rule then multiply the given Number
whose value you seek by the Number of shillings in the price of the Integer,
and then for the pence, work by the 8th. Rule foregoing, then add the Numbers
together, and their sum is the value sought in shillings; as for Example, what
is the value of 392 yds. at 6 s. 9 d. per yard? Here 6 s. 9 d. cannot be made
any even part, nor indeed can it be divided into even parts of a pound,
wherefore I multiply the given Number of yards 392 by 6 for the 6 s. the
product is 2352 shillings, then for the 9 d. I divide it into 6 d. and 3 d.,
and work for them by the 8th. Rule foregoing, and at last add the shillings
together they make 2646 s. and by the 3 Rule they are reduced to 132 l. 6 s.
the value of 392 yds. at 6 s. 9 d. per yard. See the work following.

^

Other Examples follow.
^

18. When the given price of the Integer is shillings, pence, and farthings,
then multiply the given number of Integers by the Number of shillings contained
in the value of the Integer, and for the pence and farthings follow the 10th.
Rule of this Chapter

Examples.
^

Case 6.
19. When the given value of the Integer is pounds, then multiply the Number of
Integers whose value is sought by the price of the Integer and the product is
the Answer in pounds.

Examples.
C. l. C. l. 42 at 2 per C./84 l. facit 13 at 8 per C./104 l. facit C. l. C. l.
30 at 3 per C./90 l. facit 48 at 12 per C./576 l. facit.

Case 7.
20. If the price of the Integer is pounds and shillings, then for the pounds
work as in the last Rule, and for the shillings as in the 12 and 13 Rules
before going; then add the Numbers produced from them both, and the sum is the
value sought.

Examples.
^

21. When the given price of an Integer consists of pounds shillings and pence,
with farthings, then work for the shillings pence and farthings first,
according to the 18. Rule of this Chap and find the total vallue of the given
number, as if there were no pounds, then work with the pounds according to the
19 Rule of this Chapter, and add the numbers thus found, and their sum is the
total value Required.

Examples of this Rule follow.
^

22. When there is given the value of an Integer, and it is required to know
the value of many such Integers together with or or 3/^ of an integer, then
first (by the former rules) find out the value of the given number of Integers*
and then for of an Integer take ^/4 of the given value of the Integer, or for
1/^ take of the given value of the integer, and for first take of the given
value, and then of that 1/^, setting each part under the precedent, then adding
them together their sum will be the Required value of the Integers and their
parts. Example, what is the value of 116 yds. at 4 s. 6 d. per yard? To give an
Answer, first I work for the value of 116 yds. by the 15 ^ Rule foregoing, and
then for the yard I take of 4 s. 6 d. which is 2 s. 3 d. and add to the Rest
found as before, then adding them together, I find the total value of 116 yds.
at 4 s. 6 d. per yard to amount to 26 l. 04 s. 3 d. as by the work in the
Margent.

Other Examples follow.
^

Many more questions may be stated, and several other rules of practice may be
shown according to the method of diverse authors but what have been delivered
here are sufficient for the practical Arithmetici-cases whatsoever.

CHAP. XXVII. The Rule of Barter.
1. BArter is a Rule amongst Merchants which (in the exchanging of one
Commodity for another) informs them so to proportion their Rates as that
neither may sustain loss.

2. To resolve questions in barter, it will not be difficult to him that is
acquainted with the Golden Rule, or Rule of 3, it being altogether used in
resolving such quest^ons.

Quest. 1. Two Merchants, viz. A and B barter, A has 13 C. 3 qrs. 14 l. of
Pepper at 2 l. 16 s. per C. and B has Cotton at 9 d. per l. I demand how much
Cotton B must give A for his Pepper?

Answer. 9 C. 1 qr.

First find by the Rule of 3 how much the Pepper is worth, saying

If 1 C. cost 2 l. 16 s. what will 13 C. 3 qrs. 14 l. cost.

Answ. 38 l. 17 s.

Secondly by the Rule of 3 say, if 9 d. buy 1 l. of Cotton how much will 38 l.
17 s. buy?

Answer. 9 and so much Cotton must B give to A for 13 C. 3 qrs. 14 l. of pepper
at 2 l. 16 s. per C. when the Cotton is worth 9 d. per l.

Quest. 2. Two Merchants (A and B) barter, A has Ginger worth 1 l. 17 s. 4 d.
per C. but in barter he will have 2 l. 16 s. per C. B. has Nutmegs worth 5 l.
12 s. per C. now I demand how B must rate his Nutmegs per C. to make his gain
in barter equal to that of A?

Answer, 8 l. 8 s.

Say by the Rule of 3 if 1 l. 17 s. 4 d. require 2 l. 16 s. in barter what will
5 l. 12 s. require in barter?

Facit 8 l. 8 s.

Quest. 3. A and B barter, A has 120 yds of Broadcloath worth 6 s. per yd. but
in barter he will have 8 s. per yd. B has shalloon worth 4 s. per yd. Now I
demand how many yds. of shalloon B must give A for his broad-cloth making his
gain in barter equal to that of A?

Answer, 180 yds. of shalloon.

First (as in the last question) find out how B. ought to sell his shalloon in
barter, viz. say If 6 s. require 8 s. what will 4 s. require?

Answer. 5 s. 4 d.

Thus you see that B must sell his shalloon in barter at 5 s. 4 d. if A sell
his broad-cloth at 8 s. per yd.

It remains now to find how much shalloon B must give for 120 yds. of
broad-cloth, which after the same method used to resolve the first question of
this Chap. is found to be 180, and so many yds of shalloon must B give A for
the 120 yds. of broad-cloath.

Quest. 4. A and B bartered A had 14 C. of Sugar worth 6 d. per l. for which B
gave him 1 C. 3 qrs. of Cinnamon, I demand how B rated his Cinnamon per l.?

Answer 4 s. per pound.

Quest. 5. A and B barter, A has 4 Tun of Brandy worth, 37 l. 16 s. ready
money, but in barter he has 50 l. 8 s. per tun, and A gives B 21 C. 2 qrs. 11
1/^ l. of Ginger for his 4 tun of Brandy, I desire to know how B sold his
Ginger in barter per C. and how much it was worth in ready money?

Answer. For 9 l. 6 s. 8 d. in barter, and it was worth 7 l. per C. ready money.

Quest. 6. A and B barter A has 320 dozen of Candles at 4 s. 6 d. per dozen,
for which B gives him 30 l. in money, and the rest in Cotton at 8 d. per I. I
demand how much Cotton he must give him more then the 30 l.?

Answ. 11 C. 1 qr.

Quest. 7. A and B barter, A has 608 yds. of broadcloth worth 14 s. per yd.
for which A gives him 125 l. 12 s. ready money and 85 C, 2 qrs. 24 l. of
Beeswax, now I desire to know how he reckoned his Wax per C.?

Answer. 4 l. 13 s. 4 d. per C.

CHAP. XXVIII. Questions in Loss and Gain.
Quest. 1. A Merchant bought 436 yds of broad-cloth for 8 s. 6 d. per yd. and
sells it again at 10 s. 4 d. per yrd. now I desire to know how much he gained
in the sale of the 436 yds?

Answ. 39 l. 19 s. 4 d.

First find out by the Rule of Three or Practice how much the Cloth cost him at
8 s. 6 d. per yd. viz. 185 l. 6 s. then by the same Rule find out how much he
sold it for viz. 225 l. 5 s. 4 d. then subtract 185 l. 6 s. which it cost him,
from 225 l. 5 s. 4 d. which he sold it for, and there remains 39 l. 19 s. 4
d. for his gain in the sale thereof.

Otherwise it may sooner be resolved thus, first find out how much he gained
per yd. viz. subtract 8 s. 6 d. which he gave per yd. from 10 s. 4 d. which he
sold it for per yd. the remainder is 1 s. 10 d. for his gains per yd. then say.

If 1 yd gain 1 s. 10 d. what will 436 yds. gain? Answer. by the Rule of three
is 39 l. 19 s. 4 d. as was found before.

Quest. 2. A Draper bought 124 yds. of Holland cloth, for which he gave 31 l. I
desire to know how he must sell it per yd. to gain 10 l. 6 s. 8 d. in the whole
sale of the 124 yds? answ. at 6 s. 8 d. per yd.

Add the price which it cost him, ( viz. 31 l.) to his intended gain ( viz. 10
l. 6 s. 8 d.) the sum is 41 l. 6 s. 8 d. then say.

If 124 yds require 41 l. 6 s. 8 d. what will 1 yd. require? by the Rule of
Three I find the answer 6 s. 8 d.

Quest. 3. A Grocer bought 3 C. 1 qrs. 14 l. of Cloves which cost him 2 s. 4 d.
per l. and sold them for 52 l. 14 s. I desire to know how much he gained in the
whole? answer 8 l. 12 s.

Quest. 4. A Draper bought 86 (...) for 129 l. I demand how he must sell the^
per piece to gain 15 l. in laying out 100 l. at that rate? answer 1 l. 14 s. 6
d. per piece, for

As 100 l. is to 115 l. so is 129 l. to 148 l. 7 s.

So that by the proportion above, I have found how much he must receive for the
86 Kersies to gain after the rate of 15 l. per C. then to find how he must sell
them per piece I say.

As 86 pieces is to 148 l. 7 s. so is 1 piece to 1 l. 14 s. 6 d. which is the
number sought.

Quest. 5. A Grocer bought 4 C. of pepper for 15 l. 14 s. 7 d. and (it proving
to be damnified) is willing to lose 12 l. 10 s. per C. I demand how he must
sell it per l.? answer 7 d. per l.

Subtract 12 l. 10 s. the loss of 100 l. from l. and there remains 87 l. 10 s.
then say

As 100 l. is to 87 l. 10 s. so is 15 l. 17 s. 4 d. to 13 l. 17 s. 8 d. so much
as he must sell it all for to lose after the rate propounded, then to know how
he must sell it per l. I say.

As 13 l. 17 s. 6 d. is to 4 C. so is 1 l. to 7 d.

Quest. 6. A Plummer sold 10 fodder of Lead (the fodder containing 19 C.) for
204 l. 15 s. and gained after the rate of 12 l. 10 s. per 100 l. I demand how
much it cost him per C.? answer 18 s. 8 d.

To resolve this question add 12 l. 10 s. (the gain per C.) to 100 l. and it
makes 112 l. 10 s. then say.

As 112 l. 10 s. is to 100 l. so is 204 l. 15 s. to 182 l.

Which 182 l. is the sum it cost him in all then reduce your 10 fodders to half
hundreds and it makes 390, then say

As 390 half hundreds is to 182 l. so is 2 half hundreds to 18 s. 8 d. the
price of 2 half hundreds or one C. weight and so much it stood him in per C.

Quest. 7. A Merchant bought 8 tuns of Wine, which being sophisticated he
sells for 400 l. and loses after the rate of 12 l. in receiving 100 l. now I
demand how much it cost him per tun? and how he must sell it per gall. to lose
after the said rate? answer it cost 56 l. per tun, and he must sell it at 3 s.
11 d. 2 10/21 qrs. per gallon to lose 12 l. in receiving 100 l.

To resolve this question I consider in the first place, that in receiving 100
l. he loses 12 l. therefore 100 comes in, for 112 l. laid out, wherefore to
find how much he laid out for the whole I say

As 100 l. is to 112 so is 400 l. to 448 l. and so much the 8 tun cost him,
then to find how much it cost per tun, I say

As 8 is to 448 l. so is 1 to 56 l. the price it cost per tun.

Now to find how he must sell it per gall. reduce the 8 tuns into gallons they
make 2016, then say

As 2016 gall. is to 400 l. so is one gall. to 3 s. 11 d. 2 10/2^ qrs. the
price he must sell it per gallon to lose as aforesaid.

Quest. 8. A Merchant bought 8 tuns of Wine, which being sophisticated he is
willing to sell for 400 l. and loses 12 l. in laying out 100 l. upon the same,
now I demand how much it cost him per tun?

Here I consider that for 100 l. laid out he receives but 88 l. therefore to
find what the 8 tuns cost him I say

As 88 l. to 100 l. so is 400 l. to 454 6/11 the price it all cost him, then to
find how much per tun I say

As 8 is to 454 6/11 l. so is one to 56 9/11 or 56 l. 16 s. 4 d. 1 5/11 qrs.
per tun.

CHAP. XXIX. Equation of Payments.
1. EQuation of payments, is that Rule amongst Merchants whereby to reduce the
times for payment of several sums of money to an equated time for the payment
of the whole debt without damage to Debtor or Creditor, and

The Ruie is
2. Multiply the sums of each particular payment by its respective time, then
add the several products together and their sum divide by the total debt, and
the quotient thence arising is the equated time for the payment of the wole
debt. Example.

Quest. 1. A is indebted to B in the sum of 130 l. whereof 50 l. is to be paid
at 2 months, and 50 l. at 4 months, and the rest at 6 months, now they agree to
make one payment of the total sum, the question is what is the equated time for
payment without damage to debtor or creditor?

To resolve this question I multiply each payment by its time, viz. 50 l.
multiplied by 2 months produces 100 50 l. multiplied by 4 months produces
200 30 l. multiplied by 6 months produces 180 The sum of the products is 480

Then I divide 480 (the sum of the products) by 130 (the total debt) and the
quotient is 3 9/13 months for the time of paying the whole debt.

Quest. 2. A Merchant has owing him 1000 l. to be paid as follows, viz. 600
l. at 4 months, 200 l. at 6 months. and the the rest which is 200 l. at 12
months; and he agrees with his debtor to make one payment of the whole, I
demand the time of payment without damage to debtor or Creditor; 600 l.
multiplied by 4 months is 2400 200 l. multiplied by 6 months is 1200 200 l.
multiplied by 12 months is 2400 The sum of the products is 6000 and the sum of
the products (6000) divided by the whole debt 1000 l. quotes 6 mon. for the
time of payment of the whole debt.

3. The truth of this Rule is thus manifest, if the interest of that money
which is paid (by the equated time) after it is due, The proof of the Rule of
Equation of Payments.
be equal to the interest of that money which (by the equated time) is paid so
much sooner then it is due at any rate per C. then the operation is true,
otherwise not. example. In the last question 600 l. should have been paid at 4
months but it is not discharged till 6 months (that is 2 months after it is
due) wherefore its interest for 2 months at 6 per C. per annum is 6 l. and then
200 l. was to be paid at 6 months which is the equated time for its payment,
therefore no interest is reckoned for it, but 200 l. should have been paid at
12 mon. but it is to be paid at 6 months which is 6 months sooner then it
ought, wherefore the interest of 200 l. for 6 months is 6 l. (accompting 6 l.
per Cent. per annum) which is equal to the interest of 600 l. for 2 months
wherefore the work is right.

Quest. 3. A Merchant has owing him a certain sum to be discharged at 3 equal
payments viz. at two months at four mon. and at 8 mon. the question is what is
the equated time for the payment of the whole debt?

In questions of this nature ( viz. where the debt is divided into equal or
unequal parts) each of the parts is to be multiplied by its time, and the sum
of the products is the answer multiplied by 2 mon. produces multiplied by 4
months produces 1 multiplied by 8 months produces 2 The sum of the products
is 4 which is 4 months for the equated time of payment.

If instead of the fractions (representing the parts) you had wrought by the
numbers themselves (represented by those parts) according to the first and
second, examples, it would have been the same answer, as suppose the debt had
been 90 l. then of it is 30 l. for each payment, viz. at 2, 4 and 8 months,
then 30 l. multiplied by 2 mon. produces 60 30 l. multiplied by 4 mon.
produces 120 30 l. multiplied by 8 mon. produces 240 The sum of the products
is 420 which divided by 90 (the whole debt) quoteth 4 60/90 or 4 months as
before.

Quest. 4. A Merchant owes a Sum of money, to be paid at 5 Months, and at 8
Months, and at 10 Months, and he agrees with his Creditor to make one total
payment; I demand the time, without damage to Debtor or Creditor? Work as in
the last Question, and you will find the Answer to be 7 Months.

Quest. 5. A is indebted to B 640 l. whereof he is to pay 40 l. present money,
and 350 l. at 3 Months, and the rest ( viz. 250 l.) at 8 Months, and they
agree to make an Equated time for the whole Payment, now I demand the time?

In Questions of this Nature ( viz. where there is ready money paid) you are
(in Multiplying) to neglect the money that is to be paid present, and work with
the rest as is before directed, and Divide the sum of the Products by the whole
Debt, and the Quote is the Answer: for here 40 l. is to be paid present, and
has no time allowed, and according to the Rule it should be Multiplied by its
time, which is (0) therefore 40 times 0 is 0, which neither augmenteth nor
diminishes the Dividend; wherefore (to proceed according to direction) I say,
350 by 3 Months, produces 1050 250 by 8 Months, produces 2000 The Sum of
the Products is 3050 which Divided by 640, the whole Debt, the Quote is 4 49/64
Months, the time of payment.

Quest 6. A is indebted to B in a certain Sum, whereof is to be paid present
money, at 6 Months, and the rest at 8 Months; now I demand the Equated time
for the payment of it all?

Answer. 3 months is the time of payment.

Quest. 7. A is indebted to B 120 l* whereof ^/^ is to be paid at 3 months, a^
6 months, and the rest at 9 months; what is the Equated time for the payment
of the whole Sum?

Answer. At 6 months.

Quest. 8. A is indebted to B 420 l. which is due at the end of 6 months; but
A i^ willing to pay him 140 l. present, provi^ded he can have the remainder
forborne so much the longer to make Satisfaction for his kindness, which is
agreed upon, I desire to know what time ought to be allotted for the payment of
the 280 l. remaining?

To resolve this Question, first, find ou^ what is the Interest of 140 l. for
the time i^ was paid before it was due, at 6 per Cent. (or any other rate) (
viz. 6 months) and you will find it to be 4 l. 4 s. Then it is evident that
the remaining 280 l. must be detained so much longer than 6 months, as the
while it may eat out that Interest, viz. 4 l. 4 s. which is thus found out,
viz. First, see what is the Interest of 280 l. for a month, or any other time;
but here we will take one month, and its Interest for one month is 28 s.

Then by the Rule of Three say,

As 28 s. is to 1 month, so is 84 s. to 3 months; so that the 280 l.
remaining must be kept 3 months beyond its first time of payment, ( viz. 6
months) which added thereto, makes 9 months, at the end of which time A ought
to make payment of the remainder.

CHAP. XXX. Exchange.
1. THE Rule of Exchange informs Merchants how to Exchange Moneys, Weights,
or Measures of one Country, into (or for) the Moneys, Weights, or Measures of
another Country, and when the Rate, Reason, or Proportion betwixt the Money,
Weights, or Measures of different Countries is known, it will not be difficult
for the Practitioner that is well acquainted with the Rule of Proportion (or
Rule of Three) to solve any Question wherein it is required to Exchange a given
quantity of the one kind, into the same value of another kind.

2. In Questions of Exchange, there is always a Comparison made between the
Coyns, etc. of two Countries (or kinds) or of more.

3. In Questions where there is a Comparison made between two things (whether
they be Moneys, Weights, etc.) of different kinds (or Countries) there may be a
solution found by a single Rule of 3, as may appear by the following Example.

Quest. 1. A Merchant at London delivered 370 l. Sterling, to receive the same
at Paris in French Crowns, the exchange 3 French Crowns per pound Sterling. I
demand how many French Crowns ought he to receive?

In placing the Numbers observe the 6 Rule of the 10 Chapter, which being done,
ths given Numbers will stand thus, l. Crowns. l. 1 3 370 and being Reduced
according to the Rules of the 24 Chapter, will stand thus, As ^ is to ^ so is ^
to ^ So that I conclude he ought to Receive 1233 French Crowns at Paris for his
370 l. delivered at London.

Quest. 2. A Merchant delivered at Amsterdam 587 l. Flemish, to receive the
value thereof at Naples in Ducats, the exchange 4 Ducats per l. Flemish: I
demand how many Ducats he ought to receive?

The Proportion is as follows.

As ^ is to ^ so is ^ to ^

So I find he ought to receive 2817 Ducats at Naples for the 587 l. Flemish
delivered at Amsterdam.

Quest. 3. A Merchant at Florence delivers 3478 Ducatoons, to receive the
value at London in pence, the exchange 53 1/^ pence Sterling per Ducatoon; I
demand how much Sterling he ought to receive?

The Proportion for Resolution is,

As ^ is to ^ so is ^ to ^ which is equal to 775 l. 6 1/12 for the Answer.

I might here (according to the Custom of Arithmetical Writers) lay down Tables
for the Reduction of Foreign Coyns to English; but by Reason of their
Instability (for they continue not at a constant standard, as our Sterling
money does, but are sometimes raised, and sometimes depressed) I shall forbear.

4. When there is a Comparison made between more than two different Coyns,
Weights, or Measures, there arises ordinarily two different cases from such a
Comparison.

1. When it is Required to know how many Pieces of the first Coin, Weight, or
Measure are equal in value to a known number of Pieces of the last Coin,
Weight, or Measure.

2. When it is Required to find out how many Pieces of the last Coin, Weight,
or Measure are equal in value to a given number of the first sort of Coin,
Weight, or Measure.

An Example of the first Case may be this, VIZ.
Quest. 4. If 150 pence at London are equal to 3 Ducats at Naples, and 4 4/^
Ducats at Naples make 34 Shillings at Brussels, then how many pence at London
are equal to 138 shillings at Brussels? Facit 960 d.

This Question may be Resolved at two single Rules of Three; for first I say,

If 3/1 Ducats at Naples make 150 pence at London, how many pence will 4 Ducats
make?

Answ. 240 pence.

By the foregoing Proportion we have discovered, that 4 Ducats at Naples make
240 pence at London: And by the Tenor of the Question we see that 4 Ducats at
Venice make 34 shillings at Brussels, therefore 240 pence at London are equal
to 34 shillings at Brussels, (for the things that are equal to one and the same
thing, are also equal to one another,) wherefore we have a way laid open to
give a solution to this Question by another Single Rule of Three, whose
Proportion is,

As 34 shillings at Brussels is to 240 pence at London; so is 138 shillings at
Brussels to 960 pence at London, which is the Answer to the Question.

An Example of the Second Case may be this, VIZ.
Quest. 5. If 40 l. Averdupoize weight at London is equal to 36 l. weight at
Amsterdam; and 90 l. at Amsterdam makes 116 l. at Dantzick, then how many
pounds at Dantzick are equal to 112 l. of Averdupois weight at London?

Answer. 129 23/25 pounds at Dantzick.

This Question is likewise answered at two single Rules of Three, viz. First, I
say,

As 36 l. at Amsterdam is to 40 l. at Land.

So is 90 l. at Amsterdam to 100 l. at Land.

And by the Question you find that 90 l. at Amsterdam is 116 l. at Dantzick;
and therefore 100 l. at London is likewise equal thereunto, wherefore again I
say,

As 100 l. at London is to 116 l. at Dant.

So is 112 l. at London to 129 23/25 at Dant.

By which I find that 112 23/25 l. at Dantzick are equal to 112 l. Averdupois
weight at London.

5. There is a more speedy way to Resolve such Questions as are contained under
the two Cases before mentioned, laid down by Mr. Kersey in the third Chapter of
his Appendix to Mr. Wingates Arithmetic, where he has given two Rules for the
Resolution of the Questions pertinent to the two said Cases.

6. But I shall lay down a general Rule for the solution of both Cases; and
first, let the Learner observe the following Directions in placing of the given
terms, viz.

7. Let there be made two Collumes, and in these Collumes so place the given
terms one over the other, as that in the same Collume there may not be found
two Terms of the same kind one with the other.

Having thus placed the Terms, the General Rule is,

Observe which of the said Collumes has the most Terms placed in it, and
multiply all the Terms therein continually, and place the last Product for a
Dividend; then multiply the Terms in the other Collume continually, and let the
last Product be a Divisor; then divide the said Dividend by the said Divisor,
and the Quotient thence arising is the answer to the question.

So the example of the first of the said cases being again repeated, viz. If
150 pence at London make 3 ducats at Naples, and 4 ducats at Naples make 34
shill. at Brussels, then how many pence at London are equal to 138 shillings at
Brussels?

The terms being placed according to the 7 Rule will stand as follows.

A B Pence at Land. 150 3 Duc. at Na. Ducats at Na. 4 4/^ 34 shill. at Bruss.
Shi^l. at Bruss. 138 having thus placed the terms, that in neither collume
there is 2 terms of one kind, then I observe that the collume under A has most
terms in it, therefore they must be multiplied together for a dividend; viz.
150 mult. by 4 4/^ produces 3600/5 which multiplied by 138 produc. 106800/5
for a dividend, then in the collume under B there are 3 and 34 which multiplied
together produces 207/2 for a divisor; then having divided 496800/^ by 207/2
the quotient is 960 pence for the answer as before.

Again, let the example of the second case be again repeated, viz. If 40 l.
Averdupois weight at London make 36 l weight at Amsterdam, and 90 l. at
Amsterdam make 116 l. at Dantzick, then how many pounds at Dantzick are equal
to 112 l. Averdupois weight at London.

The terms being disposed according to the 7 Rule foregoing will stand thus A B
l. at Land. 40 36 l. at Amsterdam. l. at Amst. 90 116 l. at Dantzick. 112 l. at
London. whereby I find that the terms under B multiplied together produce
467712 for a dividend, and the terms under A viz. 40 and 90 produce 3600 for a
divisor and division being finished the quotient gives 129 3312/3600 pounds at
Dantzick for the answer.

CHAP. XXXI. Single Position.
1. NEgative Arithmetic called the Rule of False, is that by which we find out
a truth, by numbers invented or supposed, and this is either single or double.

2. The Rule of Single Position is when at once, viz. by one False position, or
feigned number, we find out the true number sought.

3. In the single Rule of False, when you have made choice of your position,
work it according to the tenor of the question, as if it were the true number
sought, and if by the ordering of your position you find the result either too
much or too little you may then find out the number sought, by this proportion
following viz.

As the result of your position, is to the position, so is the given number to
the number sought.

Example.
Quest. 1. A Person having about him a certain number of Crowns, said if the
fourth and third and sixth of them were added together they would make just 45,
now I demand the number of Crowns he had about him? Answer 60 Crowns.

To resolve this question I suppose he had 24 Crowns (or any other number that
will admit of the like division) now the fourth of 24 is 6, and the third is 8,
and the sixth is four, all which parts ( viz. 6, 8, and 4,) being added
together make but 18, but it should be 45, wherefore I say by the Rule of three.

As 18 the sum of the parts, is to the position 24 so is 45 the given number to
60 the true number sought.

For the fourth of 60 is 15, and the third of 60 is 20, and the sixth of 60 is
10, which added together make 45.

Quest. 2. Three Persons, viz. A, B, C, thus discourse together concerning
their age, quoth B to A I am as old, and half as old again as you, then quoth C
to B I am twice as old as you, then quoth A to them, and I am sure the sum of
all our ages is 165, now I demand each man's age? Answer A 30, B 45, C 90, years
of age, which added together makes 165.

CHAP. XXXII. Double Position.
1. THe Rule of Double Position is, when 2 False positions are assumed, to give
a resolution to the question propounded.

2. When any question is stated in double position, make such a cross as
follows.

^

3. Then make choice of any number you think may be convenient for your
working, which call your first position, and place it at that end of the cross
at a, then work with this position (as if it were the true number sought,)
according to the nature of your question, then having found out your error,
either too much or too little place, it on that side the cross d, then make
choice of another number of the same denomination with the first position
(which call your second position) and place it on that side of the cross at b,
then work with this position as with the former, and having found out your
error, either too much or too little, place it on that side of the cross at c,
and then the positions will stand at the top of the cross, and the errors at
the bottom each under his correspondent position, and then multiply the errors
into the positions cross-wise, that is to say multiply the first position by
the second error, and the second position by the first error, and put each
product over its position.

4. Having proceeded so far, then consider whether the errors were both alike,
that is, whether they were both too much, or both too little, and if they are
alike, then subtract the lesser product from the greater and set the remainder
for a dividend, then subtract the lesser error from the greater, and let the
remainder be a divisor, then the quotient arising by this division is the
answer to the question.

5. But if the errors are unlike, that is one too much and the other too
little, then add the products of the positions and errors, together and their
sum shall be a dividend, then add the errors together and their sum shall be a
Divisor, and the quotient arising hence is the Answer; which two last Rules may
be kept in memory by this verse following, viz. When Errors are of unlike kinds
Addition does ensue
But if alike, Subtraction finds
Dividing work for you.


Quest. 1. A, B and C Build a house which cost 76 l. of which A paid a certain
sum unknown, B paid as much as A and 10 l. over, and C paid as much as A and B,
now I desire to know each man's share in that Charge?

Having made a Cross according to the 2 Rule, I come according to the third
Rule to make choice of my first position, and here I suppose A paid 6 l. which
I put upon the Cross as you see, then B paid 16 l. (for it is said he paid 10
l. more then A) and C paid 22 l. for it is said he paid as much as A and B, then
I add their parts ^ and they amount to 44, but it is said they paid / 2 l.
wherefore it is 32 too little, which I note down at the bottom of the Cross
under its position for the first error.

Secondly, I suppose A paid 9 l. then B paid 19 l. and C 28 l. all which added
together make 56, but they should make 76, wherefore the error of this position
is 20 which I put at the bottom of the Cross under his position, for the second
Error, then I multiply the Errors and the Positions Cross-wise, viz. 32 (the
Error of the first Position) by 9 (the second position) and the product is 288.
Then I multiply 20 (the Error of the second Position) by 6 (the first Position)
and the Product is 120.

Then (according to the 4th. Rule) I subtract the lesser product from the
greater, ( viz. 120 from 288 because the Errors are both alike, viz. too
little) and there Remains 168 for a dividend, then I subtract 20 (the lesser
Error) from 32 (the greater Error) and the remainder is 12 for a Divisor, then
divide 168 by 12 and the Quotient is 14 for the Answer, which is the share of A
in the payment.

6. Again secondly, If the errors had been both too bigg it had had the same
effect, as appears by the following work; for first I suppose A paid 20 l.
then B paid 30 l. and C 50 l. which in all is 100 but it should have been no
more then 76, wherefore the first Error is 24 too much. Again I suppose A paid
18 l. then B must pay 28 l. and C must pay 46 l. which in all ^ is 92 l. but it
should have been but 76 l. wherefore the second Error is 16 too much; then I
Multiply 20 (the first Position) by 16 (the second Error, and the product is
320, again I multiply 18 (the second Position) by 24 (the first Error) and the
product is 432.

Then because the Errors are both too much I subtract 320 (the lesser product)
from 432 (the greater product) and there Remains 112 for a Dividend, likewise
I subtract 16 (the lesser Error) from 24 (the greater Error) and the difference
is 8 for a Divisor, then perform Division, and the Quotient is 14 (as before)
for the answer.

Again Thirdly, If the Errors had been the one too bigg, and the other too
little, Respect being had to the 5th. Rule foregoing, the answer would have
been the same; as thus, I take for my first Position 6, and then the error is
32 too little, then I take for my second Position 18, and then the error is 16
too much, then I multiply the Positions and errors Cross-wise, and the products
are 96 and 576, and because the errors are unlike ^ viz. one too bigg, and
another too little, I add the products 96 and 576 together, and their sum is
672 for a Dividend, I likewise add the errors 32 and 16 together, and their sum
is 48 for a Divisor, then having finished Division I find the quotient to be 14
which is the answer, as was found out at the 2 several Trials before.

For Proof of the work I say l. If A paid 14 Then B paid 14 and 10 ( that is)
24 And C paid 14 and 24 ( that is) 38 The Sum of all is 76 which is the total
value of the building and equal to the given Number.

Those who desire to see the demonstration of this Rule, let them Read the 7th.
Chapter of Mr. Kersyes Appendix to Wingates Arithmetic, Petiscus in the 5th.
Book of his Trigonometria. Or Mr. Oughtred in his Clavis Mathematicae.

Quest. 2. Three Persons, A, B, C, thus discoursed together concerning their
age; Quoth A I am 18 years of age, quoth B I am as old as A and C; and quoth C,
I am as old as you both, if your years were added together, Now I desire to
know the age of each Person? Answer A is 18, B is 54, and C is 72, years of age.

Quest. 3. A Father lying at the point of Death, left to his 3 Sons, viz. A, B,
C, all his Estate in Money, and Divided it as follows, viz. to A he gave
wanting 44 l. to B he gave and 14 l. over, and to C he gave and 30 l. over, now
I demand what was the sum left, and each man's part? Answer, the sum bequeathed
was 588 l. whereof A had 250 l. B had 210 l. and C had 128 l.

Quest. 4. Two Persons viz. A and B had each in their hands a certain Number of
Crowns, and A said to B, If you give me 1 of your Crowns I shall have 5 times
as many as you, and said B to him again, If you give me one of yours then we
shall each of us have an equal Number; now I demand how many Crowns had each
Person? Answer, A had 4 and B had 2 Crowns.

Quest. 5. What Number is that unto which if I add of it self, and from the sum
subtract of it self the Remainder w^ll be 210? Answer 192.

Many more questions may be added but these well understood will be sufficient
(even for the meanest Capacity) for the Resolution of any other question
pertinent to this Rule.

There may be an Objection made because we have not treated particularly upon
Interest, and Rebate, but the operation of such questions, being more
applicable to Decimals, are omitted, till we come to acquaint the Learner
therewith.
