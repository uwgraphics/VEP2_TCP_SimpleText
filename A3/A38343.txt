Die Martis, 17. Maii. 1642.
WHereas the Lords in Parliament, have this day been Informed, That the King is
Resolved to adjourn the next Term from Westminster to York; Upon which, The
Lords sent a Committee to the Lord Keeper of the great Seal of England, to know
of him, whether he had received any command touching the same, who acquainted
the said Committee, That he had received command from His Majesty, to issue
Proclamations, and Writs, to that purpose.

Whereupon, This House taking the said matter into consideration, has Voted;
That the Kings removal of the Term to York, from Westminster, sitting this
Parliament, is Illegal.

And has further ordered, That the said Lord Keeper, shall not issue out any
Writs, or Seal any Proclamation, for adjourning the said next Term from
Westminster to York, as aforesaid.
