That in prosecution of Justice and reparation, your Majesty was graciously
pleased particularly to own the said cause, in a more especial manner in the
Treaty Anno 1662. then all other damages of that nature, to your subjects, in
regard of the many services and sufferings, of Sr. William Courten, and others
Intrested, that had lent one Hundred and Twenty five Thousand Ponnd Sterling to
his late Majesty, at usual Interest, toward the ordinary charge of the
Crown before the year 1640, which remains yet unsatisfied, as by the Tallies
and Assignements in the Exchequer appears.

That during the late War Anno 1672. your Majesty most graciously appeared
again, concerning the damages of the said Ships, holding your self obliged, in
Justice, and honor, to get satisfaction, from the principal Offenders for the
same. As by the orders of the Council Table, and reports, of the Commit of
Lords, intimating the merrits of the said cause to your Majesty accordingly.

That notwithstanding all the orders, procedings, and special grants, under
the great Seal of England, concerning the said Ships, Goods, and Fraights,
the Hollanders do still pretend, they are not obliged to give any satisfaction
for the same, being made a debt incumbant upon the Crown, by the last Treaty
at London, whereby eight Hundred Thousand Pattacones are to be paid unto your
Majesty by the States General, at four equal payments, for which the Crown
of Spain stands obliged, that they shall be paid accordingly.

Your Peticioners do therefore most humbly pray, that your Majesty would be
most graciously pleased, to assign some part, and proportion of the said Money
payable to your Majesty by the States, unto your Peticioners in Satisfaction
of the said damages, and losses, concerning the said Ships as aforesaid, or to
grant them, some assignment, upon any branch of your Majesty's revenue in liew
thereof,

And your Peticioners, shall ever pray, etc.
