WHereas We the LORDS and COMMONS have Ordered, That it be referred to the
Committee for the safety of the Kingdom, to prepare Heads of an Humble Address
unto His Majesty, for composing the present Differences and Distractions, and
settling the Peace of the Kingdom, and to present them to the House.

To prevent all Misconstructions or Neglects, whereby our just Defense may be
hindered, We do Declare, That the Preparation of Forces, and all other necessary
means for the Defense of the Protestant Religion, the Privileges of
Parliament, the Laws and Liberties of the Subject, shall be prosecuted with all
vigor.
