The Order for Morning PRAYER.
Let him that ministers read with a loud voice these Sentences of Scripture,
and after them the Exhortation following.
REnt your heart, and not your Joel 2. 13
garments, and turn unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious, and merciful,
slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents him of the evil.

To the Lord our God belong Dan. 9. 9, 10.
mercies, and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him: neither have
we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws which he set
before us.

Correct us, O Lord, but with judgment; not Jer. 10. 24
in thine anger, lest thou bring us to nothing.

DEarly beloved brethren, the Scripture moves us in sundry places, to
acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness, and that we should
not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty God our heavenly
Father, but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient heart,
to the end that we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness
and mercy. And although we ought at all times humbly to acknowledge our sins
before God, yet ought we most chiefly so to do, when we assemble and meet
together, to cast our selves down at the throne of his heavenly Grace, and to
pour out our humble Supplications for the averting of his Judgments, and for
the procuring of his Blessings upon our Sovereign and his Kingdoms, to render
thanks for the great benefits that we have received at his hands, to set forth
his most worthy praise, to hear his most holy word, and to ask those things
which are requisite and necessary, as well for the body as the soul: Wherefore
I pray and beseech you as many as are here present, to accompany me with a pure
heart and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace, saying after me.

The Confession to be said of the whole Congregation after the Minister, all
kneeling.
ALmighty and most merciful Father, We have erred and strayed from thy ways
like lost sheep, We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own
hearts, We have offended against thy holy laws, We have left undone those
things which we ought to have done, And we have done those things which we
ought not to have done, And there is no health in us: But thou, O Lord, have
mercy upon us miserable offenders; Spare thou them, O God, which confess their
faults; Restore thou them that are penitent, According to thy promises declared
unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for
his sake, That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the
glory of thy holy Name. Amen.

The Absolution to be pronounced by the Priest alone, standing; the people
still kneeling.
ALmighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desires not the death
of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and live, and has
given power and commandment to his Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his
people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of their sins: He
pardons and absolveth all them that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe his
holy Gospel. Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true repentance and his
holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do at this present, and
that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and holy, so that at the last
we may come to his eternal joy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The people shall answer here, and at the end of all other Prayers, Amen.
Then shall the Minister kneel, and say the Lords Prayer; the people also
repeating it with him.

Our Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy
will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And
lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil: for thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

Then likewise he shall say,
O Lord open thou our lips.

Ans. And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.

Priest. O God make speed to save us.

Answer. O Lord make haste to help us.

Here all standing up, the Priest shall say,
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the holy Ghost.

Answer. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen.

Priest. Praise ye the Lord.

Answer. The Lords name be praised.

Instead of Venite, exultemus, shall be said this Hymn following; one Verse by
the Priest, and another by the Clerk and people.
O Come, let us humble our selves, and fall Psalm. 95. 6.
down before the Lord: with reverence and fear.

For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people 7.
of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.

Come therefore, let us turn again unto our Hos. 6. 1.
Lord: for he has smitten us, and he will heal us.

Let us search, and try our ways: let us lift up our Lam. 3. 40, 41.
hearts with our hands unto God in the heavens.

Let us repent, and turn from our wickedness: Acts 3.
and our sins shall be forgiven us.

Let us turn, and the Lord will turn from his heavy Jonah 3.
wrath: he will pardon us, and we shall not perish.

We acknowledge indeed, that our punishments Joh 11. 6. Wisd. 11. 23.
are less than our deservings: but yet of thy mercy, O Lord, correct us to
amendment, and plague us not to our destruction.

We have provoked thine anger, thy wrath is waxed hot: and thy heavy
displeasure is sore kindled against us.

But thy hand is not shortened, that thou can Es. 59. 1.
not help: neither is thy goodness abated, that thou will not hear.

Thou have promised, O Lord, that before we Es. 65. 24.
cry, thou will hear us: whilst we are yet speaking, thou will have mercy upon
us.

For none that trust in thee shall be confounded: neither shall any that call
upon thee be despised.

Our Fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, Ps. 22. 4.
and thou did deliver them.

They called upon thee, and were helped: they 5.
put their trust in thee, and were not confounded.

And now in the vexation of our spirits, and the Baruch 3. 1, 2.
anguish of our souls we cry unto thee: hear, Lord, and have mercy.

For many troubles are come about us: our Psalm. 40. 15.
sins have taken such hold upon us, that we are not able to look up.

For thine own sake, and for thy holy Names Dan 9. 18, 19.
sake, incline thine ear; and hear, oh merciful Lord.

For we do not present our Supplications before 18.
thee, trusting in our own righteousness: but in thy manifold and great mercies.

Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Ps. 79. 9.
thy Name: oh deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins for thy Names sake.

So we that are thy people and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will always be showing forth thy Praise from Generation to Generation.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end.
Amen.

Instead of the Psalms for the Day, shall these proper Psalms be used, VI. XXV.
LI.
Domine, ne. Psalm. vj.
O Lord, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.

2 Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
vexed.

3 My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long will thou punish me?

4 Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercies sake.

5 For in death no man remembers thee: and who will give thee thanks in the
pit?

6 I am weary of my groaning, every night wash I my bed: and water my couch
with my tears.

7 My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine
enemies.

8 Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord has heard the voice of
my weeping.

9 The Lord has heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.

10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they shall be turned
back, and put to shame suddenly.

Ad te, Domine, levavi. Psalm. xxv.
UNto thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul, my God, I have put my trust in
thee: O let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.

2 For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such as transgress
without a cause, shall be put to confusion.

3 Show me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.

4 Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my
salvation; in thee has been my hope all the day long.

5 Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy loving kindnesses,
which have been ever of old.

6 Oh remember not the sins, and offenses of my youth: but according to thy
mercy think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.

7 Gracious, and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the
way.

8 Them that are meek, shall he guide in judgment: and such as are gentle, them
shall he learn his way.

9 All the paths of the Lord are mercy, and truth: unto such as keep his
covenant, and his testimonies.

10 For thy names sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.

11 What man is he, that fears the Lord: him shall he teach in the way, that
he shall choose.

12 His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.

13 The secret of the Lord is among: them that fear him: and he will show them
his covenant.

14 Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of
the net.

15 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate, and in misery.

16 The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.

17 Look upon my adversity, and misery: and forgive me all my sin.

18 Consider mine enemies how many they are: and they bear a tyrannous hate
against me.

19 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for I have put my
trust in thee.

20 Let perfectness, and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope has been
in thee.

21 Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.

Miserere mei, Deus. Psalm. li.
HAve mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offenses.

2 Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.

3 For I knowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.

4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
might be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.

5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin has my mother conceived me.

6 But so, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shall make me to
understand wisdom secretly.

7 Thou shall purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shall wash me,
and I shall be whiter then snow.

8 Thou shall make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou have
broken may rejoice.

9 Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.

10 Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.

11 Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.

12 O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free
Spirit.

13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted
unto thee:

14 Deliver me from bloud-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my
health: and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.

15 Thou shall open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall show thy praise.

16 For thou desire no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou
delightest not in burntofferings.

17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O
God, shall thou not despise.

18 O be favorable, and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.

19 Then shall thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the
burnt-offerings, and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.

The first Lesson appointed to be read, is Isaiah l. or Isaiah lviij.

After the first Lesson shall follow Te Deum Laudamus in English.
WE praise thee, O God: we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.

All the earth does worship thee: the Father everlasting.

To thee all Angels cry aloud: the heavens, and all the powers therein.

To thee Cherubin, and Seraphin: continually do cry,

Holy, holy, holy: Lord God of Sa^aoth.

Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty: of thy glory.

The glorious company of the Apostles: praise thee.

The goodly fellowship of the Prophets: praise thee.

The noble army of Martyrs: praise thee.

The holy Church throughout all the world: does acknowledge thee.

The Father: of an infinite Majesty.

Thine honorable: true, and only S^n.

Also the holy Ghost: the Comforter.

Thou art the King of Glory: O Christ.

Thou art the everlasting Son: of the Father.

When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man: thou did not adhor the Virgins
womb.

When thou had overcome the sharpness of death: thou did open the kingdom
of heaven to all believers.

Thou fittest at the right hand of God: in the glory of the Father.

We believe that thou shall come: to be our Judge.

We therefore pray thee help thy servants: whom thou have redeemed with thy
precious blood.

Make them to be numbered with thy Saints: in glory everlasting.

O Lord save thy people: and bless thine heritage.

Govern them: and lift them up for ever.

Day by day: we magnify thee.

And we worship thy Name: ever world without end.

Vouchsafe, O Lord: to keep us this day without sin.

O Lord, have mercy upon us: have mercy upon us.

O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us: as our trust is in thee.

O Lord, in thee have I trusted: let me never be confounded.

For the second Lesson, Luke xiii. or Luke xxi.

BLessed be the Lord God of Israel: for he has visited and redeemed his people.

And has raised up a mighty salvation for us: in the house of his servant
David.

As he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets: which have been since the world
began;

That we should be saved from our enemies: and from the hands of all that hate
us;

To perform the mercy promised to our forefathers: and to remember his holy
covenant;

To perform the oath which he swear to our forefather Abraham: that he would
give us;

That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies: might serve him
without fear;

In holiness and righteousness before him: all the days of our life.

And thou, Child, shall be called the Prophet of the Highest: for thou shall go
before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;

To give knowledge of salvation unto his people: for the remission of their
sins,

Through the tender mercy of our God: whereby the dayspring from on high has
visited us;

To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: and to
guide our feet into the way of peace.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

Then shall be said the Creed by the Minister, and the people standing.
I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth: And in Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord; who was conceived by the holy Ghost, born of the
Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead and buried; he
descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended
into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from
thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the holy
Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of
sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Collect for Grace.
O Lord our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting God, who have safely
brought us to the beginning of this day, defend us in the same with thy mighty

O Most mighty God, and merciful Father, who have compassion upon all men, and

that he should rather turn from his sin, and he saved; Mercifully forgive us
our trespasses; receive and comfort us, who are grieved and wearied with the
burden of our sins. Thy property is always to have mercy; to thee only it
appertains to forgive sins, Spare us therefore, good Lord, spare thy people
whom thou have redeemed; enter not into judgment with thy servants, who are
vile earth, and miserable sinners; but so turn thine anger from us, who mer^^y
acknowledge our vileness, and truly repent us of our faults; and so make haste

TVrn thou us, O good Lord, and so shall we be turned, Be favorable, O Lord,
be savourable to thy people, Who turn to thee in weeping, fasting, and praying.
For thou art a merciful God, Full of compassion, Long-suffering, and of great
pity. Thou sparest when we deserve punishment, And in thy wrath think upon
mercy. Spare thy people, good Lord, spare them, And let not thine heritage be
brought to confusion. Hear us, O Lord, for thy mercy is great, And after the
multitude of thy mercies look upon us, Through the merits and mediation of thy
blessed Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

GRant, we beseech thee, merciful Lord, to thy faithful people pardon and
peace, that they may be cleansed from all their sins, and serve thee with a
quiet mind, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

A Prayer of S. Chrysostom.
ALmighty God, who have given us grace at this time with one accord, to make
our common supplications unto thee, and do promise that when two or three are
gathered together in thy Name, thou will grant their requests: Fulfill now, O
Lord, the desires and petitions of thy servants, as may be most expedient for
them, granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to
come life everlasting. Amen.

THe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of
the holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen.

The Communion-Service.
The Priest standing at the North-side of the Lords Table, shall say,
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy
will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And
lead us not into temptation: But deliver us from evil. Amen.

ALmighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and from whom
no secrets are hid: cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of
thy holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy
holy Name, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

Minister.

GOd spoke these words, and said, I am the Lord thy God: Thou shall have none
other gods but me.

People.

Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.

Minister.

Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under
the earth. Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship them; for I the Lord
thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children,
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show mercy unto
thousands in them that love me, and keep my commandments.

People.

Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.

Minister.

Thou shall not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will
not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.

People.

Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.

Minister.

Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbathday. Sir days shall thou labor and do
all that thou have to do, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God. In it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and thy
daughter, thy manservant, and thy mild-servant, thy cattle, and the stranger
that is within thy gates. For in sir days the Lord made heaven and earth, the
sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord
blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.

People.

Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.

Minister.

Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which
the Lord thy God gives thee.

People.

Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.

Minister.

Thou shall do no murder.

People.

Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.

Minister.

Thou shall not commit adultery.

People.

Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.

Minister.

Thou shall not steal.

People.

Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.

Minister.

Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

People.

Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.

Minister.

Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy neighbors
wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing
that is his.

People.

Lord have mercy upon us, and write all these thy laws in our hearts, we
beseech thee.

Let us pray.
ALmighty God, whose kingdom is everlasting and power infinite; have mercy upon
the whole Church, and so rule the heart of thy chosen servant Charles our King
and Governor, that he (knowing whose Minister he is) may above all things seek
thy honor and glory: And that we and all his subjects (duly considering whose
authority he has) may faithfully serve, honor, and humbly obey him, in thee,
and for thee, according to thy blessed Word and Ordinance, through Jesus Christ
our Lord, who with thee and the holy Ghost, lives and reigns ever one God,
world without end. Amen.

ALmighty and everlasting God, who hate nothing that thou have made, and do
forgive the sins of all them that are penitent; Create and make in us new and
contrite hearts, that we worthily lamenting our sins, and acknowledging our
wretchedness, may obtain of thee, the God of all mercy, perfect ^emission and
forgiveness, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

GRant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we, who for our evil deeds do
worthily deserve to be punished, by the comfort of thy grace may mercifully be
relieved, through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

For the Epistle, Joel II. 11.
THe day of the Lord is great, and very terrible, and who can abide it?
Therefore also now, says the Lord, Turn ye even to me with all your heart, and
with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning. And rent your heart and not
your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and
merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents him of the evil.
Who knows if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even
a meat offering, and a drink offering unto the Lord your God? Blow the trumpet
in zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly. Gather the people: sanctify
the congregation: assemble the elders: gather the children, and those that suck
the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of
her closet. Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch
and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine
heritage to reproach; that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should
they say among the people, Where is their God? Then will the Lord be jealous
for his land, and pity his people.

The Gospel. S. Matthew. VI. 16.
WHen ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they
disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto
you, they have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head,
and wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
which is in secret; and thy Father which sees in secret, shall reward thee
openly. Lay not up for your selves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust
does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. But lay up for your
selves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where
thieves do not break through nor steal. For where your treasure is, there will
your heart be also.

I Believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of
all things visible and invisible:

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten of his
Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God,
begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things
were made: who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and
was incarnate by the holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was
c^ucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, He suffered, and was buried, and
the third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures, and ascended into
heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father. And he shall come again
with glory to judge both the quick and the dead: whose kingdom shall have no
end.

And I believe in the holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds
from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is
worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the Prophets. And I believe one
Catholic and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of
sins. And I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to
come. Amen.

Then follows the Sermon; and after that shall be said,
Blessed be the man that provideth for the sick ^sal. 41. 1.
and needy: the Lord shall deliver him in the time of trouble.

He that has pity upon the Poor, Lends Prove. 19. 17.
unto the Lord: and look what he lays out, it shall be paid him again.

Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church militant here on earth.
ALmighty and everliving God, who by thy holy Apostle have taught us to make
prayers and supplications, and to give thanks for all men: We humbly beseech
thee most mercifully (to accept our alms and oblations, and) to receive If
there be no alms or oblations, then shall the words (of accepting our alms and
oblations.) be left out unsaid.
these our prayers, which we offer unto thy divine Majesty, beseeching thee to
inspire continually the Universal Church with the spirit of truth, unity and
concord: and grant that all they that do confess thy holy Name, may agree in
the truth of thy holy Word, and live in unity and godly love. We beseech thee
also to save and defend all Christian Kings, Princes, and Governors, and
especially thy servant CHARLES our King, that under him we may be godly and
quietly governed. And grant unto his whole Council, and to all that are put in
Authority under him, that they may truly and indifferently minister justice, to
the punishment of wickedness and vice, and to the maintenance of thy true
Religion and virtue. Give grace, O heavenly Father, to all Bishops, and
Curates, that they may both by their life and doctrine set forth thy true and
lively Word, and rightly and duly administer thy holy Sacraments. And to all
thy people give thy heavenly grace, and especially to this Congregation here
present, that with week heart and due reverence they may hear and receive thy
holy Word, truly serving thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of
their life. And we most humbly beseech thee of thy goodness, O Lord, to comfort
and succor all them who in this transitory life are in trouble, sorrow, need,
sickness, or any other adversity. And we also bless thy holy Name, for all thy
servants departed this life in thy faith and fear; beseeching thee to give us
grace so to follow their good examples, that with them we may be partakers of
thy heavenly kingdom. Grant this, O Father, for Jesus Christ's sake our only
Mediator and Advocate. Amen.

GLorious, and gracious God, whose Judgments against obstinate Offenders are
most severe, and terrible; but thy Mercies infinite to All, that with hearty
Repentance, and true Faith turn unto thee: We, sinful people of this Land, do
acknowledge before thee, to thy Glory, and our own Shame, and Confusion, that
never any Nation under Heaven had more Experience of all the Instances of thy
Goodness, and the Methods of our Amendment; nor yet did ever any more
shamefully abuse them. When thou gave us great, and long Prosperities; we fed
our selves to the full, waxed fat, and wanton, and kicked against thee. When
thou threwest us into horrid Confusions, from which we saw then little Hope of
arising; even in the time of that Distress did we trespass yet more against
thee. When by Miracles of Mercy thou had turned our Captivities; we soon
returned to Folly, to our Vomit, and to our wallowing in our former, or greater
Filthiness. Though thy Plagues have been since upon us to high, and dreadful
Degrees; we did not then (as we ought) look every Man into the Plague of our
own Hearts, nor return to him that smote us. We went through Fire, and Water;
but were not by that severe Discipline purified from our Dross, or purged from
our Pollutions. Even while thou were fighting for us against our Enemies
abroad; we were by our Sins at home fighting against Heaven, and against thee.
And now we are no more worthy to be called either thy Sons, or thy Servants;
whom neither thy Fear has driven, nor thy Goodness led to Repentance. It is of
thy mere Mercies, O Lord, that we are not consumed; thy unwearied unconquerable
Patience, that thou have not long since given us over as incorrigible. We adore
the unsearchable Depths of thy infinite Goodness, that we are still under thy
Discipline: We are ready here before thee meekly to kiss all the smarting Rods,
which we may justly fear thou now hold over us; beseeching thee by the Aids,
and Influence of thy Grace to make them effectual to our Correction, and not to
our Destruction. In Mercy awaken our drowsy Consciences; Soften and subdue our
hard hearts into deep Contrition, and Repentance; Pardon the many great
Offenses of us thy Servants, and the crying sins of the whole Nation; Remove
the Evils we now lie under; Avert those Judgments which we justly fear, because
we most justly deserve; Unite all our hearts in the Profession of the true
Religion, which thine own right hand has planted and established amongst us,
and in a holy Conversation answerable thereunto. To this end Pour out the
richest of thy Blessings spiritual, and temporal, upon our gracious Sovereign;
that all his Counsels, Resolutions, and Endeavors may tend to, and end in the
Glory of thy great Name, the Advancement of Piety, and Justice, the
Preservation of thy Church, and the Security, Peace, and Prosperity of all
Estates, and Conditions of Men in these, and all other his Dominions: All which
we humbly beg in the Name, and through the Mediation of Jesus Christ, thy Son,
our Savior. Amen.

ALmighty God, who have promised to hear the petitions of them that ask in thy
Sons Name, we beseech thee mercifully to incline thine ears to us that have
made now our prayers and supplications unto thee, and grant that those things
which we have faithfully asked according to thy will, may effectually be
obtained to the relief of our necessity, and to the setting forth of thy glory,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then the priest shall let them depart with this Blessing.
THe peace of God which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds
in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and the
blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, be amongst
you, and remain with you always. Amen.

The Order for Evening PRAYER.
Let him that ministers read with a loud voice these Sentences of Scripture,
and after them the Exhortation following.
REnt your heart; and not your Joel 2. 13
garments, and turn unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious, and merciful,
slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents him of the evil.

To the Lord our God belong Dan. 9. 9, 10.
mercies, and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him: neither have
we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws which he set
before us.

Correct us, O Lord, but with judgment; not Jer. 10. 24
in thine anger, lest thou bring us to nothing.

DEarly beloved brethren, the Scripture moves us in sundry places, to
acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness, and that we should
not dissemble not cloak them before the face of Almighty God our heavenly
Father, but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient heart,
to the end that we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness
and mercy. And although we ought at all times humbly to acknowledge our sins
before God, yet ought we most chiefly so to do, when we assemble and meet
together, to cast our selves down at the throne of his heavenly Grace, and to
pour out our humble Supplications for the averting of his Judgments, and for
the procuring of his Blessings upon our Sovereign and his Kingdoms, to render
thanks for the great benefits that we have received at his hands, to set forth
his most worthy praise, to hear his most holy word, and to ask those things
which are requisite and necessary, as well for the body as the soul: Wherefore
I pray and beseech you as many as are here present, to accompany me with a pure
heart and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace, saying after me.

The Confession to be said of the whole Congregation after the Minister, all
kneeling.
ALmighty and most merciful Father, We have erred and strayed from thy ways
like lost sheep, We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own
hearts, We have offended against thy holy laws, We have left undone those
things which we ought to have done, And we have done those things which we
ought not to have done, And there is no health in us: But thou, O Lord, have
mercy upon us miserable offenders; Spare thou them, O God, which confess their
faults; Restore thou them that are penitent, According to thy promises declared
unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for
his sake, That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the
glory of thy holy Name. Amen.

The Absolution to be pronounced by the Priest alone, standing; the people
still kneeling.
ALmighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desires not the death
of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and live, and has
given power and commandment to his Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his
people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of their sins: He
pardons and absolveth all them that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe his
holy Gospel. Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true repentance and his
holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do at this present, and
that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and holy, so that at the last
we may come to his eternal joy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The people shall answer here, and at the end of all other Prayers, Amen.
Then shall the Minister kneel, and say the Lords Prayer; the people also
repeating it with him.

Our Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy
will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And
lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil: for thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

Then likewise he shall say,
O Lord open thou our lips.

Ans. And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.

Priest. O God make speed to save us.

Answer. O Lord make haste to help us.

Here all standing up, the Priest shall say,
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the holy Ghost.

Answer.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

Priest. Praise ye the Lord.

Answer. The Lords name be praised.

Instead of Venite, exultemus, shall be said this Hymn following; one Verse by
the Priest, and another by the Clerk and people.
O Come, let us humble our selves, and fall Psalm. 95. 6.
down before the Lord: with reverence and fear.

For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people 7.
of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.

Come therefore, let us turn again unto our Hos. 6. 1.
Lord: for he has smitten us, and he will heal us.

Let us search, and try our ways: let us lift up our Lam. 3. 40, 41.
hearts with our hands unto God in the heavens.

Let us repent, and turn from our wickedness: Acts 3.
and our sins shall be forgiven us.

Let us turn, and the Lord will turn from his heavy Jonah 3.
wrath: he will pardon us, and we shall not perist.

We acknowledge indeed, that our punishments Joh 11. 6. Wisd. 11. 23.
are less than our deservings: but yet of thy mercy, O Lord, correct us to
amendment, and plague us not to our destruction.

We have provoked thine anger, thy wrath is waxed hot: and thy heavy
displeasure is sore kindled against us.

But thy hand is not shortened, that thou can Es. 59. 1.
not help: neither is thy goodness abated, that thou will not hear.

Thou have promised, O Lord, that before we Es. 65. 24
cry, thou will hear us: whilst we are yet speaking, thou will have mercy upon
us.

For none that trust in thee shall be confounded: neither shall any that call
upon thee be despised.

Our Fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, Ps. 22. 4.
and thou did deliver them.

They called upon thee, and were helped: they 5.
put their trust in thee, and were not confounded.

And now in the vexation of our spirits, and the Baruch 3. 1, 2.
anguish of our souls we cry unto thee: hear, Lord, and have mercy.

For many troubles are come about us: our Psalm. 40. 15.
sins have taken such hold upon us, that we are not able to look up.

For thine own sake, and for thy holy Names Dan 9. 18, 19.
sake, incline thine ear; and hear, oh merciful Lord.

For we do not present our Supplications before 18.
thee, trusting in our own righteousness: but in thy manifold and great mercies.

Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Ps. 79. 9.
thy Name: oh deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins for thy Names sake.

So we that are thy people and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will always be showing forth thy Praise from Generation to Generation.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.

Proper Psalms are XXXII. CXXX. CXLIII. Beati, quorum. Psalm. XXXII.
BLessed is he, whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is covered.

2 Blessed is the man, unto whom the Lord imputes no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.

3 For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.

4 For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is like the
drought in summer.

5 I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.

6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgavest the
wickedness of my sin.

7 For this shall every one, that is godly, make his prayer unto thee, in a
time when thou may be found: but in the great water-flouds they shall not
come nigh him.

8 Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shall preserve me from trouble: thou
shall compass me about with songs of deliverance.

9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way, wherein thou shall go: and I
will guide thee with mine eye.

10 Be ye not like to horse, and mule, which have no understanding: whose
mouths must be held with bit and bridle, left they fall upon thee.

11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whosoever puts his trust in the
Lord, mercy embraces him on every side.

12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful all ye,
that are true of heart.

De profundis. Psalm. CXXX.
OVt of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.

2 O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.

3 If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may
abide it?

4 For there is mercy with thee: therefore shall thou be feared.

5 I look for the Lord, my soul does wait for him: in his word is my trust.

6 My soul flees unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.

7 O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him
is plenteous redemption.

8 And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.

Domine, exaudi. Psalm. CXLIII.
HEar my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire: hearken unto me for thy truth
and righteousness sake.

2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.

3 For the enemy has persecuted my soul, he has (...) thy (...) to the
ground: he has laid (...) in the darkness, us the men that have been long dead.

4 Therefore is my spirit (...) ^ithin me: and my heart within me is desolate.

5 Yet do I remember the time past, I ^^se upon all thy works: yea, I exercise
my self in the works of thy hands.

6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty
land.

7 Hear me, O Lord, and that look, for my spirit waxes faint: hide not thy
fate from me, left I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

8 O let me hear thy loving kindness bet^mes in the morning, for in thee is my
trust: show thou me the way that I should walk in, ^or I li^t up my soul unto
thee.

9 Deliver me, O Lord, from ^^ne enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.

10 Teach me to ^^ the thing that ^^^^seth thee, for thou art my God: let thy
loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.

11 Quicken me, O Lord, for thy names sake: and for thy righteousness sake
bring my (...) of trouble.

12 And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them that ^ex my
soul, for I am thy servant.

The first Lesson is, Amos vj. or Jonah iij.

Magnificat. MY soul does magnify the Lord: and my spirit has rejoiced in God
my Savior.

For he has regarded: the (...) of his hand-maiden.

For behold, from henceforth: all generations shall call me blessed.

For he that is mighty has magnified me: and holy is his Name.

And his mercy is on them that fear him: throughout all generations.

He has showed strength with his arm: he has scattered the proud in the
imagination of their hearts.

He has put down the mighty from their seat: and has exalted the humble and
meek.

He has filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he has sent empty
away.

He remembering his mercy has helped his servant Israel: as he promised to our
forefathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and in the holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end, Amen.

The second Lesson is, 1 Cor. X. beginning Verse. 1. and ending with Verse. 13.
or, ^ Pet. III.

Deus misereatur. Psalm. 67.
GOd be merciful unto us, and bless us: and show us the light of his
countenance, and be merciful unto us.

That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.

Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.

O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shall judge the folk
righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.

Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.

Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God,
shall give us his blessing.

God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

As it was in the beginning, etc.

Then shall be said the Creed by the Minister, and the people standing.
I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth: And in Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord; who was conceived by the holy Ghost, born of the
Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead and buried; he
descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended
into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from
thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the holy
Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of
sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

And after that, these Prayers following; all devoutly kneeling, the Minister
first pronouncing with a loud voice,
The Lord be with you.

Answer.

And with thy spirit.

Minister.

Let us pray.
Lord have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy
will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And

Answer.

From the face of our enemies.

Priest.

O Lord hear our prayer,

Answer.

And let our cry come unto thee.

In stead of the first Collect shall these two be used.
ALmighty and everlasting God, who hate nothing that thou have made, and do
forgive the sins of all them that are penitent; Create and make in us new and
contrite hearts, that we worthily lamenting our sins, and acknowledging our
wretchedness, may obtain of thee, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and
forgiveness, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

GRant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we, who for our evil deeds do
worthily deserve to be punished, by the comfort of thy grace may mercifully he
relieved, through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

O God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do
proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot give, that
both our hearts may be set to obey thy commandments, and also that by thee we
being defended from ^^e fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and
quietness, through the merits of Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.

LIghten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord, and by thy great mercy defend
us from all perils and dangers of this night, for the love of thy only Son, our
Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

O Lord, we beseech thee mercifully hear our prayers, and spare all those who
confess their sins unto thee, that they whose consciences by sin are accused,
by thy merciful pardon may be absolved, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

O Most mighty God, and merciful Father, who have compassion upon all men, and
hate nothing that thou have made, who would not the death of a sinner, but
that he should rather turn from his sin, and be saved; Mercifully forgive us
our trespasses; receive and comfort us, who are grieved and wearied with the
burden of our sins. Thy property is always to have mercy; to thee only it
appertains to forgive sins. Spare us therefore, good Lord, spare thy people
whom thou have redeemed; enter not into judgment with thy servants, who are
^ile earth, and miserable sinners; but so turn thine anger from us, who meekly
acknowledge our vileness, and truly repent us of our faults; and so make haste
to help us in this world, that we may ever live with thee in the world to come,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then shall the people say this that follows, after the Minister.
TVrn thou us, O good Lord, and so shall we be turned. Be favorable, O Lord,
be favorable to thy people, Who turn to thee in weeping, fasting, and praying.
For thou art a merciful God, Full of compassion, Long-suffering, and of great
pity. Thou sparest when ^e deserve punishment, And in thy wrath think upon
mercy. Spare thy people, good Lord, spare them, And let not thine heritage be
brought to confusion. Hear us, O Lord, for thy mercy is great, And after the
multitude of thy mercies look upon us, through the merits and mediation of thy
blessed Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

GRant, we beseech thee, merciful Lord, to thy faithful people pardon and
peace, that they may be cleansed from all their sins, and serve thee with a
quiet mind, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

A Prayer for the Kings Majesty.
O Lord our heavenly Father, High and Mighty, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, the
only Ruler of Princes, who do from thy Throne behold all the dwellers upon
earth, most heartily we beseech thee with thy favor to behold our most
gracious Sovereign Lord King Charles, and so replenish him with the grace of
thy holy Spirit, that he may always incline to thy Will, and walk in thy way;
endue him plenteously with heavenly gifts; grant him in health and wealth long
to live; strengthen him, that he may vanquish and overcome all his enemies, and
finally after this life he may attain everlasting joy and felicity, through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

A Prayer for the Royal Family.
ALmighty God, the Fountain of all goodness, we humbly beseech thee to bless
our gracious Queen Catherine, James Duke of York, and all the Royal Family;
Endue them with thy holy Spirit, enrich them with thy heavenly grace, prosper
them with all happiness, and bring them to thine everlasting Kingdom, through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

A Prayer for the Clergy and People.
ALmighty and everlasting God, who alone workest great marvels; Send down upon
our Bishops, and Curates, and all Congregations committed to their charge, the
healthful Spirit of thy grace; and that they may truly please thee, pour upon
them the continual dew of thy blessing. Grant this, O Lord, for the honor of
our Advocate and Mediator, Jesus Christ. Amen.

GLorious, and gracious God, whose Judgments against obstinate Offenders are
most severe, and terrible; but thy Mercies; infinite to All, that with hearty
Repentance, and true Faith turn unto thee: We, sinful people of this Land, do
acknowledge before thee, to thy Glory, and our own shame, and confusion, that
never any Nation under Heaven had more Experience of all the Instances of thy
Goodness, and the Methods of our Amendment; nor yet did ever any more
shameful^y abuse them. When thou gave us great, and long Prosperities; we fed
our selves to the full, wared fat, and wanton, and kicked against thee. When
thou threwest us into horrid Confusions, from which we saw then little Hope of
arising; even in the time of that Distress did we trespass yet more against
thee. When by Miracles of Mercy thou had turned our Captivities; we soon
returned to Folly, to our Vomit, and to our wallowing in our former, or greater
Filthiness. Though thy plagues have been since upon us to high; and dreadful
Degrees; we did not then (as we ought) look every than into the plague of our
own Hearts, nor return to him that smote us. We went through Fire, and Water;
but were not by that severe Discipline purified from our Dross, or purged from
our Pollutions. Even while thou were fighting for us against our Enemies
abroad; we were by our sins at home fighting against Heaven, and against thee.
And now we are no more worthy to be called either thy Sons, or thy Servants;
whom neither thy Fear has driven, nor thy Goodness led to Repentance. It is of
thy mere Mercies, O Lord, that we are not consumed; thy unwearied unconquerable
Patience, that thou have not long since given us over, as incorrigible. We
adore the unsearchable Depths of thy infinite Goodness, that we are still under
thy Discipline: We are ready here before thee meekly to kiss all the smarting
Rods, which we may justly fear thou now hold over us; beseeching thee by the
Aids, and Influence of thy Grace to make them effectual to our Correction, and
not to our Destruction. In Mercy awaken our drowsy Consciences; Soften, and
subdue our hard hearts into deep Contrition, and Repentance; Pardon the many
great Offenses of us thy Servants, and the crying Sins of the whole Nation;
Remove the evils, we now lie under; Avert those Judgments, which we justly
fear, because we most justly deserve; Unite all our Hearts in the Profession of
the true Religion, which thine own right hand has planted and established
amongst us, and in a holy Conversation answerable thereunto. To this end Pour
out the richest of thy Blessings spiritual, and temporal, upon our gracious
Sovereign; that all his Counsels, Resolutions, and Endeavors may tend to, and
end in the Glory of thy great Name, the Advancement of Piety, and Justice, the
Preservation of thy Church, and the Security, Peace, and Prosperity of all
Estates, and Conditions of Men in these, and all other his Dominions: All which
we humbly beg in the Name, and through the Mediation of Jesus Christ, thy Son,
our Savior. Amen.

A Prayer of St. Chrysostom.
ALmighty God, who have given us grace at this time with one accord, to make
our common supplications unto thee, and do promise, that when two or three
are gathered together in thy Name, thou will grant their requests; Fulfill now,
O Lord, the desires and petitions of thy servants, as may be most expedient for
them, granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to
come life everlasting. Amen.

2 Corinthians. 13. 14.
THe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of
the holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen.

FINIS.
