BY THE KING.
A Proclamation for the Assembling the Members of both Houses at Oxford, upon
occasion of the Invasion by the Scots.
WHEREAS We did by Our Proclamation, bearing date the twentieth day of June
last, upon due consideration of the miseries of this Kingdom, and the true
cause thereof, warn all Our good Subjects no longer to be misled by the Votes,
Orders, and pretended Ordinances of One or Both Houses, by reason the Members
do not enjoy the Freedom and Liberty of Parliament, which appears by several
instances of Force and Violence, and by the course of their proceedings
mentioned in Our said Proclamation, and several of Our Declarations: since
which time Our Subjects of Scotland have made great and Warlike preparations to
enter and invade this Kingdom with an Army, and have already actually invaded
the same, by possessing themselves, by force of Arms, of Our Town of Barwick,
upon pretense that they are invited thereunto by the desires of the two Houses;
the which as we doubt not all Our good Subjects of this Kingdom will look upon
as the most insolent Act of Ingratitude and disloyalty, and to the apparent
breach of the late Act of Pacification so solemnly made between the Kingdoms,
and is indeed no other then a design of Conquest, and to impose new Laws upon
this Nation, they not so much as pretending the least provocation or violation
from this Kingdom so We are most assured that the Major part of both Houses of
Parliament do from their souls abhor the least thought of introducing that
Foreign Power, to increase and make desperate the miseries of their unhappy
Country. And therefore that it may appear to all the world how far the Major
part of both Houses is from such Actions of Treason and disloyalty, and how
grossly those few Members remaining at Westminster have and do impose upon Our
People, We do Will and require such of the Members of both Houses, as well
those who have been by the Faction of the Malignant Party expelled for
performing their duty to Us, and into whose rooms no Persons have been since
chosen by their Country, as the rest who have been driven thence, and all those
who being conscious of their want of Freedom, now shall be willing to withdraw
from that Rebellious City, to assemble themselves together at Our City of
Oxford, on Monday the twenty second day of January, where care shall be taken
for their several Accommodations, and fit places appointed for their meeting,
and where all Our good Subjects shall see how willing We are to receive Advice
for the Preservation of the Religion, Laws and safety of the Kingdom, and, as
far as in Us lies, to restore it to its former Peace and Security (Our chief
and only end) from those whom they have trusted, though We cannot receive it in
the place where We appointed. And for the better encouragement of those Members
of either House to resort to Us, who may be conscious to themselves of having
justly incurred Our displeasure by submitting to, or concurring in unlawful
actions; And that all the World may see how willing and desirous We are to
forget the Injuries and Indignities offered to Us, and by an Union of English
hearts, to prevent the lasting miseries which this Foreign Invasion must
bring upon this Kingdom, We do offer a free and General Pardon to all the
Members of either House, who shall at, or before the said twenty second day of
January appear at Our City of Oxford, and desire the same, without Exceptions:
which considering the manifest Treasons committed against Us, and the condition
We are now in, improved by Gods wonderful blessing to a better degree then We
have enjoyed at any time since these Distractions, is the greatest instance of
Princely and Fatherly Care of Our People that can be expressed, and which
Malice it self cannot suggest to proceed from any other ground. And therefore
We hope, and are confident, that all such who upon this Our gracious Invitation
will not return to their duty and Allegiance, shall be no more thought
Promoters of the Religion, Laws and Liberty of the Kingdom (which this way
may be, without doubt, settled and secured) but Persons engaged from the
beginning, out of their own Pride, Malice, and Ambition, to bring confusion
and desolation upon their Country, and to that purpose (having long since
contrived the Design) to invite and join with a Foreign Nation to ruin and
extinguish their own, and shall accordingly be pursued as the most desperate
and malicious Enemies of the Kingdom. And Our Pleasure is, That this Our
Proclamation be read in all Churches and Chappells within this our Kingdom,
and Dominion of Wales.

Given at Our Court at OXFORD, the 22th day of December, in the Nineteenth
year of Our Reign. 1643.
