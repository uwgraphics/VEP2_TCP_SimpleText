THREE MINISTERS Communicating their COLLECTIONS And NOTIONS, Touching Several
Texts of Scripture (most part practical) at their Weekly Meetings.

WHEREIN The Law and Gospel, Faith and works, justification and salvation, and
in short the Substance of primitive Christianity is set forth, as appears in
the INDEX prefixed.

Contents of the N. Test. by one of the Three.

THE FIRST YEAR.

Hebr. 13. (...). LONDON, Printed for Samuel Keble at the Unicorn in
Fleetstreet, between Sergeants Inn and Ram Alley. 1675.

Govern. of the Tongue. p. 216. Would some of parts and authority but make the
experiment, I cannot think that all places are yet so vitiated, but that they
may meet with many, who would relish sober and ingenious (and religious)
discourse, and by their example propagate it to others. To the Right Reverend
Father, Lord Bishop of the Diocese: This Essay with continual Prayers for his
Lordships happiness is the humble Oblation of A. B. C.

THe courteous Readers may be pleased to understand, these Three Ministers
reside in the Country at so little distance, that they easily meet once a week
in course at their private Chambers.

There they have a sober Treat, they distinctly read their Papers, they confer
calmly upon the particulars, and discourse upon the affairs of Learning and
Religion; consider also, how to do more good in their cures, and comfort one
another against Adversities.

The Names of the Authors (Non-commentators) are not mentioned (though they are
worthy of a thankful Remembrance) but the Notes are left to commend themselves
to the judicious Readers; to whom we appeal from the Vulgar, who value things
only according to that affection they have for the persons.

The names of the Collectors are concealed, not to decline Blame, but rather to
shun the praise, due to such as endeavor, by uniting themselves to promote
Christian Piety and Uniformity in their stations.

And they humbly conceive, this way of Meeting of conforming Ministers (and
withal the very Reading of the Explicit Stipulation) countenanced by
Superiors, will prove a good expedient to reduce a more regular obedience to
the Church of England, our honored Mother.

But, it will be very sad, if we fall into an Age, wherein both Grievances and
Remedies are intolerable. Deus meliora!

Be not hasty to censure, but first have recourse (as the Ministers do in their
conferences) to your Bible, see the Scope, Antecedents and Consequents of the
place, weigh them, and then spare not to pass your Sentence.

Amongst 468. Notes, every one (we doubt not) who does without prejudice go
through the Book, will find so many things agreeable and useful to his own
soul, that he will not repent to have read it over more than once or twice. Do
but open the Book, and you cannot miss of some good Lesson or other. Not a
Leaf, sine bona fruge.

But remember that all the Texts are not expounded, but some alluded to, and
ingeniously accommodated to the purpose of the Writer.

If perhaps a new Notion or unusual Interpretation occur, know, that it is not
imposed on your Belief, but proposed to your examination.

Let not any words be wrested to the undervaluing of God's grace, or
over-valuing of Man's will. Not unto us, but unto God a^one in Christ be the
glory of our Salvation.

These few sheets are pushed forth to discover what Reception the rest may hope
for at your Hands.

An Alphabetical Index follows, to give you a prospect of what Sum is
offered to the intelligent Reader.

And at the end, you have Contents of the New Test. in Verse, being a help of
Memory, and not to be despised.

FINIS.
THREE MINISTERS Communicating their Collections and Notions touching Several
Texts of Holy Scripture.
At their weekly Meetings.
The first Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew. 16. 18. That the gates of Hell shall not prevail against the Church,
proves not the pretense of Infallibility. Instead of Hell, the word may be
rendered Grave. So, the meaning is: Death (which is the mouth and gate through
which we pass into the grave) shall never prevail against the Church. i. e. The
Church shall never die.

II. Matthew. 16. 18. On this rock. Suppose the rock on which the Church was to
be built, were S. Peter himself, that is not peculiar unto him, since we are
all built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets: and on the twelve
foundati^ns of the new Jerusalem are written the names of the twelve Apostles
of the Lamb.

III. Mat. 16. 19. The keys of the Kingdom of Heaven given to Peter, says no
more, but that he was to open the Gospel, which is usually called the Kingdom
of God, or of Heaven, in the new Testament. Now, the use of keys being to open
the door, this was in peculiar S. Peter's honor, who did first publish the
Gospel both to Jews and Gentiles, and in particular did first receive the
Gentiles into the new dispensation.

B.
I. LUke 19. 26. Unto every one that has, i. e. has made use of the talent of
Grace intr^^^ed to him (as Heb. 12. 28. To have Grace signifies to make use of
it to the end to which it is designed) shall be given; and from him that has
not: i. e. has not made use of his talent; even that he has shall be taken
from him.

II. Act. 2. 47. The Lord added daily to the Church such as should be saved.
(...), the saved. The word signifies peculiarly those who received that
exhortation v. 41. that is, those that repented of their sins: and therefore
the Syriac renders it, the Lord added daily those that became safe in the
Church, i. e. recovered themselves from that danger in which they were involved
among that wicked Generation, and betook themselves to the Church, as to a
Sanctuary.

III. Hebr. 2. 16. He takes not hold of Angels, but of the seed of Abraham he
takes hold. So the words are rightly rendered in the margin. Where (...)
signifies to catch any one, who is either running away, or falling on the
ground or into a pit, to fetch back or recover again. Thus Christ did for men,
in being born and suffering in our Flesh; but for Angels he did it not.

C.
I. Matthew. 1. 23. They shall call his name Emmanuel. i. e. He shall be God with
us, or God incarnate in our flesh. For in the Hebrew tongue, word and thing,
calling and being, name and person, are all one, No word (i. e. no thing) shall
be impossible with God. And My house shall be called (i. e. shall be) the house
of prayer to all People, Gentiles as well as Jews. And so many names i. e. so
many men.

II. Mark. 1. 24. Art thou come to destroy us? And in another place, Art thou
come to torment us, before our time Matthew. 8* 29. The Devils acknowledge that
Christ was to destroy them (they understood so much in the Sacred predictions)
but withal hope, it was not yet the time for that execution; and in the mean
while counted it a kind of destruction and torment to them to be cast out, or
retrenched of any of their power which they had over the bodies or souls of men.

III. Romans 4. 22. It was imputed (or counted) to him for Righteousness. i. e.
God took this for such an expression of Abraham's faithfulness, and sincerity,
and true piety, that he accepted him as a righteous person, tho no doubt he had
many infirmities and sins, which he was, or had been guilty of in his life,
unreconcilable which perfect righteousness.

The second Meeting.
A.
I. 2. COr. 13. 5. Know ye not that Christ Jesus is in you (among you as Ex.
17. 7.) except you be reprobates* The words may be best resolved into a
question and an answer. Know you not, discern you not, your selves, by the
miracles and preaching, the demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that
Christ Jesus, that is, the power of the Gospel, is come amongst you? this by
the context appears to be the meaning. And then the Answer, except ye be
reprobates, i. e. ye are obdurate, insensate creatures, unless you do know it.

II. Romans 5* 3, 4, 5. Tribulation works patience, and patience experience,
and experience hope, and hope makes not a shamed. Here the word (...) which we
render experience, Signifies being approved upon a trial, and the sense runs
thus: Tribulation is a season and a means to work patience, and that patience
to produce approbation, as of one that is tried in the fire, and has past the
test; and this a means to work an hope or expectation of reward; and that hope
will keep from being ashamed of those sufferings, and make us rather rejoice in
them, as in benign auspicious signs, that in another world there is a reward
for the righteous. So Romans 12. 12. rejoicing in hope, and patient in
tribulation, are joined togeher.

III. 1 John 3. 3. Every man that has this hope in him (on him, relying on his
mercy) purifieth himself. By this you shall know a Christian hope from all
other. The Hypocrite, or Carnal man, hopes, and is the wickeder for hoping, he
fears nothing, and so discerns not the necessity of mending. The best way to
reform such a one is to rob him of his ungrounded hope. But this hope of seeing
God being grounded on the Conditional promises (and the conditions being purity
and holiness, 2 Cor. 7. 1.) sets presently to the performance of the conditions.

B.
I. Matthew. 22. 37. Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with
all thy Soul, with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. The heart seems
to signify the affections: the Soul, the will, or elective faculty: the mind,
the understanding, or rational faculty: and the strength, the powers of the
body for action. All four together make up the whole man: and the word all is
affixt to each, not to exclude all other things from any inferior part of your
love, but only from an equal or superior love: to exclude a partial or a
half-love.

II. Jam. 5. 16. Confess your faults one to another. The context seems very
probably to mean the presbyters: for they are to be called, v. 14. And for the
cure of sin, it will sure be very profitable to advise with the Physicians of
the Soul: to which end alone the disclosing of the particular estate is more
then profitable. And this may tend much to your comfort, when the Minister of
God, upon a strict survey of your former life, and your present repentance,
passes judgment on you, better than you can do on your self.

III. 1. John 3. 9. Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin (i. e. does
not live in sin as in a trade or course) for his seed remains in him: (there
is in the regenerate a new principle, or seed of life, a cognation with God,
which whilst it continues keeps out sin) and he cannot sin in such manner,
because he is born of God: or if he do sin thus, he is no longer a child of
God, or a regenerate person. So we say, An honest man cannot do this: not
affirming an impossibility* but that his principles of honesty will not suffer
him to do it; or if he do it, he is no longer to be counted an honest man.

C.
I. GAl. 5. 17. The flesh lusts against the spirit etc. By the spirit it
meant the seed of Grace planted in the heart by God, as a principle of new
life; or, the mind and upper Soul elevated yet higher by that supernatural
principle: By the flesh is meant the carnal appetite, still remaining in the
most regenerate during this life: The lusting of one against the other, is
their contrariety, that whatsoever one likes, the other dislikes; (...), So
that you do not the things ye would: this contrariety gives you trouble, that
whatsoever ye do on either side, you do it not quietly, but with resistance. In
this opposition, we must be sure that the flesh do not carry it against the
Spirit, i. e. do not get the consent of the will to it. For he that fulfils the
lust's of the flesh, walks not in the Spirit, and consequently is not in a
regenerate estate.

II. Matthew. 16. 24. If any man will come after me, let him deny himself. Self
denial is to renounce whatsoever comes at any time in competition with Christ:
namely, all opinion of my own abilities toward the attaining of any
supernatural end; not depending upon any righteousness of my own for Salvation,
but only the free mercy of God in Christ, not imputing unto me sin: All
unlawful desires of the flesh, and even lawful liberty, my reputation, my
estate, and life if self, when either Christ must be parted with, or these. By
taking up the Cross in the following words, is meant bearing of Affliction,
patiently, and cheerfully.

III. Phil. 1 29. To you it is given: i. e. It is granted as a grace and
Vouchsafement of Gods special favor, to suffer far Christ; and that grace is
designed to reform what is amiss, and to punish here, that there may be nothing
of evil left for another world. Wherefore we are bound not only to patience,
but thankfulness also in our Afflictions,

The third Meeting.
A.
I. 1. COr. 2. 9. Eye ha^h not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
the heart of man, the things which God ha^h prepared for tbem that love him.
The true superlative delights even to flesh and blood, that are in Sanctity and
the practice of Christian Virtues, beyond all that any sensual pleasure
affords, are so great that when they are expressed by the Apostle in these words,
they are ordinarily mistaken for the description of Heaven.

II Romans 7. 23. I see another law in my members warring against the law of my
mind. This war is the persuasion of sin or carnal objects on the one side, and
the law of God on the other commanding the contrary. In this Combat the person
which has not the grace of Christ to sustain him, will by his carnal appetite
be led to do those things which the Law tells him he should not do: which if he
do and continue in them, this condition you will have no color of reason to
mistake for a regenerate estate. The serving of sin, or Captivity to the law of
sin, is all one with the reigning of sin: a sure token of the unregenerate.

III. Prove. 28. 13. Who so confesses and forsakes his sins shall have mercy:
forsakes, i. e. in hearty sincere resolution abandons the sins of the old man,
shall have mercy, and none but he. God will not pardon, till we in heart reform
and amend. They that say our sins are pardoned before we convert to God, and
resolve new life, are in a dangerous error; which is in effect to exclude
Justification by faith, that first grace of receiving Christ, and resigning our
hearts up to him, and must be in order of nature precedent to our
Justification, or pardon of sin: or else can be neither instrument nor
condition of it.

B.
I. Romans 12. 20. Thou shall heap coals of fire on his head. That's the way that
Metallists use, to melt those things that will not be wrought on by putting
fire under them. So, if you heap kindnesses upon the head of your enemy, the
injurious person, you may hope to melt him, and make a friend of him; which is
the noble victory of a Christian, to overcome evil with good.

II. Math. 5. 5. The meek shall inherit the Earth. Literally, the promise is
all one with that annexed to the fifth Commandment. A prosperous long life is
ordinarily the meek, man's portion which he that shall compare and observe the
ordinary dispensations of Gods providence, shall find to be most remarkably
true; especially, if compared with the contrary fate of turbulent seditious
persons. This temporal reward can no way deprive him of the eternal. The earth
here is a real inheritance below, and a pawn of another above.

III. Matthew 5. 39. Resist not evil, or, the injurious, evil man. We Christians
must bear small, supportable injuries, without hurting again or so much as
prosecuting and impleading the injurious person. In weightier and more
considerable matters, tho we may use means to defend ourselves, and to get
legal reparations for our losses; yet even it those the giving way to
revengeful desires is utterly unlawful.

C.
I. Matthew. 5. 48. Be ye therefore perfect. Instead of which St. Luke has, Be
ye merciful. Whence you may note; this Mercy, or Alms, or Benignity to
enemies, to be the highest degree of Christian perfection.

II. 1 Cor. 16. 2. Let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has
prospered him. This place seems to require all to be set apart, that comes in
by way of gain: for it is not (...) as, but (...) whatsoever. It was, it seems, a
peculiar case at that time, for relieving the poor Christians at Jerusalem.
However, hence may every rich man, or thriving man; every one that has either
constant revenue, or gainful Trade, learn to lay by him such or such a
proportion for charitable purposes, that it may be ready for such occasions, as
God shall offer to them.

III. Matthew. 5. 16. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your
good works. There is a great difference between doing our good works so that
men may see them, and doing them to be seen of men: and again, between doing
them that men may glorify our Heavenly Father, and that we may have glory of
men. The former is only a charitable care, that your good actions may be
exemplary to others: the latter, is a desire that they may be matter of
Reputation to our selves, Which reputation, if we aim at that, shall be our
only reward, instead of that which otherwise God would give. Such is the folly
and unhappiness of this sin of vainglory.

The Fourth Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew. 6. 17. When thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face. As for
thy outward guise, appear in thy ordinary countenance and habit, (the Jews were
wont to anoint themselves daily, unless in time of mourning:) that thou appear
not to men to fast: (that no man out of thy Family be witness of thy private
Fasts:) but to thy Father which is in heaven, that thou may appear desirous
to approve thy self to him only, who only is able to reward thee.

II. Luke 6. 30. From him that takes away thy goods, ask them not again,
(...), that receives by way of loan any of thy Goods; (...), require no usury,
according to the notion of that word in the Text. Which being joined with, give
to every man that asks of thee, denotes a work of mercy: as indeed lending
is a prime way of mercy. The good man is merciful and lends. Now ordinary
prudence will interpret the words so, that if a Covetous rich man ask of you,
you are not bound to give to him, but only to him whose wants sets him on
asking: and so the prohibition to exact or require use of him that borrows,
belongs not to the poor or mean Creditor, when a rich man borrows of him; but
only when the rich lends to the poor man, to whom a free loan is a seasonable
mercy.

III. Act. 2. 46. Breaking Bread from house to house, margin, at home. (...),
in some house, or Room: as the upper room Act. 1. 13. assigned and separated
from all other to that peculiar use, to be the place of Christian Assembly; it
being by the Jews, permitted them to pray in the temple, but not to break bread
or administer the Sacrament. v. 47. having favor with all the people: (...),
having or exercising charity: whereby is intimated that offertory which was
then, and ever since, used constantly in the Church of Christ at the receiving
of that Sacrament: and by the phrase all the people, is signified the
liberality of those offerings, and the impartiality of distribution.

B.
I. 1 COr. 6. 10. Drunkards shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. (...) vinosi,
vinolenti, from (...) strong or sweet wine. The word is not to be restrained to
those who drink to bestiality; to the depriveing of themselves of the use of
their reason: but belongs to all, that drink wine or strong drink
intemperately; tho through their strength of brain, they be not at present
distempered by it.

II. Act. 2. 31. His soul was not left in hell. The word (...) which we render
hell, may signify the common state of the dead: (...) the living Soul, or that
faculty by which we live: and the not leaving this in that, is the not
suffering him so long to continue deprived of life, as that, this body should
see corruption: i. e. above the space of three days: which term consisting of
72. hours, is the space required for the revolution of humors, after which
Physicians observe the body that continues so long dead, naturally putrifies.

III. John. 16. 8. H shall convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of
judgment. For

1. The very coming of the spirit shall prove their crime in not receiving
Christ, thus testified and demonstrated to be the true Prophet.

2. He shall convince the World, that Christ was a most Righteous person, and
most unjustly crucified, by his assumption into Heaven.

3. He shall convince the World by an Argument from the Judgment showed upon
Satan, to be turned out of his Kingdom, his Oracles silenced; and Heathenish
Idolatry overthrown.

C.
I. Matthew. 28. 19. Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the holy Ghost. The meaning is, First, in respect of the Minister, that
what he does he does not of himself, but by Commission, from the blessed
Trinity: Secondly, And more especially in respect of the person baptized, that
he acknowledges those three; that he delivers himself to them as the Authors of
Christian Religion; that he gives himself up to be ruled by them.

II. 1 Timothy 5. 8. But if any (widow) provide not for her own. The word (...)
signifies to rule and govern: or, to educate and instruct. Among the rest of
the qualities required of a widow in the Church (an office of some rule and
oe^onomy at that time) she must be one that has ru^ed and instructed her own
family well. This differs much from the notion that some worldly fantasies
affix to this place, thinking themselves obliged, with much thoughtfulness or
secular fore-casti^g, to provide estates and riches for their Children.

III. Tit. 1. 15. To the pure all things are pure. i. e. All things of that
nature, which are there spoken of, in themselves indifferent, may lawfully be
used by them which are rightly instructed. But they that are misled by Jewish
fables, whether they abstain superstitiously, when they are not bound by God to
abstain, sin by being subject to ordinances, (Col. 2. 20.) or whether they
abstain not, when they are persuaded they ought to abstain, sin against
conscience.

The Fifth Meeting
A.
1. Matthew. 12. 31. But the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be
forgiven unto men. This blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is not any one act, no
nor ha^it of sin (particularly, not that speaking against Christ here
mentioned) but a final ^olding out against, and resisting the whole ^ffice of
the Holy Ghost, and all those gracious methods conscquert to it.

II. 1. Kings 15. 5. David turned not aside, save only in the matter of Uriah.
Wherein it appears, he continued near the space of a year, from before the
conception till after the birth of the Child, as is proved by the time of
Nathans coming to him, 2 Samuel 1^. ^1. David, we know, had been guilty of
several acts of sin, marked and censured in the word of God; but continued not
with indulgence in any of them This sin made another manner of separation
between God and David, Contracted a greater guilt, wasted the conscience more
than any of those, more speedily retracted: it was the only remarkable (...)
drawing back or turning aside from obedience to God, the only grand defection,
shaking of Gods yoke, and so the only s^hism in his regenerate estate.

III. Deuteronomy. 30. 11. The Commandment which I command this day is not hidden from
thee? The seventy, not two heavy for t^ee, and elsewhere, not impossible 1 John
5. His commands are not greivieus: the word signifies heavy, Christ himself
says, his yoke is casie, and S. Paul, that he can do all things through
Christ: not sufficient of himself to do any thing.

B.
I. LUke. 17. 37. Wheresoever the body is, thither will the Eagles be gathered
together. Here are noted the Roman Armies, whose ensign was the Eagle: which
found out the rebellious Jews and destroyed them (as the Eagle seeks the prey,
Job. 39. 29.) wheresoever they dispersed themselves.

II. Matthew. 24. 34. This generation shall not pass till all these things be
fulfilled. They shall come to pass in this age, or within the life of some
present: as Matthew. 16. 28. There be some standing here that shall not taste of
death, till they see the Son of man coming in his Kingdom: Which is interpreted
of this matter, his illustrious coming to destroy his enemies the Jews. So,
Joh. 21. 22. If I will that he tarry till I come, etc. is spoken of this coming
of Christ, which S. John lived to see.

IIl. Gal. 5. 19. Adultery, fornication, uncle anness, etc. Emulation, wrath,
strife, etc. Here is an enumeration of Sins unreconcilable with a good
conscience. And the same; with some variation and addition, 1 Cor. 6. 9. and
Ephesians. 5. 5. Every one of these at the very Commission (deliberately) have the
nature of peecata sauciantia, wounding the sinner to the heart, and weakening
the habit of Christian Virtue; and if they be not strait retracted by
repentance, proceed further, to wast the conscience and betray us even to
desperation, and withdrawing of Grace, and delivering us up to our own lusts.

C.
^. I. JOh. 5. 16. He shall give him life for them that sin not unto death?
Here, ^ot unto death, is to be taken, not from the ^atter of the sin, but from
the disposition ^f the sinner: namely from his desiring and abouring to get out
of it: which supposes ^ome remainder of exciteing grace: while he other goes on
without any care or desire ^f reformation. It is clear, that this privi^edge
belongs to the prayers of the Faithful, or such a more moderate degree of
relapsed ^^reformed sinners. Upon their request, God ^ill give life to such, i.
e. such a degree of ^race as may enable them to recover. As for ^e secure
Impenitent, the Christian brother ^ not here obliged to pray for him; and yet
seems he is not forbidden neither.

II. Matthew. 18. 6. He that shall offend on^ of those little ones: That is, He
that shall occasion their falling off into any sin: or, which the place
especially imports, shall by comtempt discourage them from the study of piety.
For so, on the other side, to receive them, v. ^ is by S. Mark, 9. 41. said to
consist in doin^ them kindness, and encourageing them in the way of God.

III. Joh. 6. 61. Jesus said unto them does this offend you? They were offended
his words of eating his flesh, carnally understood; discouraged from following
hi^ So Gal. 5. 11. persecution is called the sca^dal of the Cross, that upon
which so man are discouraged from professing the crucifi^ Savior: and so, in
the parable of the sow Matt. 13. 21.

The sixth Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew. 16. 23. Thou a^t an offe^ unto me. i. e. By express^ thy detestation
against my suff^^gs, thou offerest to bring me into an hor^ and fear of
Suffering, and so in effect temptest me to sin. But* though Peter were an
offense to Christ, tempted him, and said that which was to ensnare him, yet
Christ was not offended, ensnared, or overcome by the temptation.

II. Romans 14. 3. Let not him that eats despise him that eats not. Those who
are in Judaical errors are appointed by S. Paul to be tenderly handled, not to
be Vilified or set at naught. And yet Gal. 3. 1. they are by the Apostle
reviled and chid out of their Judaical perswafions. The reason of this
difference is, the different estates of the Romans from the Galatians. These
had been fully instructed by him in the nature of Christian liberty: Those had
not yet been sufficiently taught to put off the opinion of legal abstinences.

III. Romans 4. 3. Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for
righteousness. Abraham was Justified by believing and depending on God for the
performance of his promise, and resigning himself up wholly to him to obey his
precepts. Or, by that Faith, which howsoever it was tried, whether by promises
of incredible things, or commands of very hard duties (as killing his only Son)
did constantly approve it self to be a true Faith: without unsinning Obedience,
or Obedience to the Mosaical law, (Abraham heing then uncircumcised v. 10.) i.
e. without Works.

B.
I. GAl. 5. 2. If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. It Is
spoken of those, who urge abolisht Ceremonies, as still of force by divine
precept: upon this ground, that Christ coming as the substance typified by
those legal Institutions, did consequently set a period to their obligingness.
Which, if it should still be urged would be interpretative! the denying of
Christ, and so most justly the forseiting of those Benefits which are to be
expected from him.

II. 1 Timothy 4. 8. Bodily exercise profits little. This place of bodily
exercise, does belong to such kind of (...), abstinence, continence, as are
aforementioned: Which, though when they are taught as necessary, to the
defaming of marriage or meats as unlawful, are then signs of departing from
the Faith, v. 1. yet considered in themselves, as voluntary acts are here said
to be profitable, in an inferior degree, being compared which piety, a little
profitable, or for a little.

III. Col. 2. 23. In will worship, and humi^y, and neglecting of the body, or,
not sparing. That will worship is here taken in a good creditable sense,
appears by the joining of it with two not only lawful but laudable Christian
Virtues, humility (which is Dei and hominum reverentia, Calv.) and mortifying
of the body, which as an act of self denial cannot be unacceptable to Christ.

C.
I. Col. 2. 23. not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh. Not
administering to the Body things to the filling or satiating of the flesh. (...)
care in relieving of wants. Matthew. 15. 6. Or, those abstinences from flesh are
commendable for chastning the Body, so that in the mean time it be not indulged
otherwise, as with wine and sweetmeats.

II. Luke. 10. 27. Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. i. e.
sincerely, and above all other things. Yet, one man may love God in a more
intense degree then another does, and the same person may constantly love God
above all, and yet have higher expressions of that love at one time then
another. Whence it follows, that Free Will offerings are reconcilable with
that command.

III. Genesis 44. 5. And whereby indeed he divineth. The cup, with which he
receives presages: for 'twas (it seems) but a drinking cup, wherein he used to
drink, in those Sacrifices, by which he prepared to receive presages from God.

The Seventh Meeting.
A.
I. Exodus 7 13. And he hardened Pharaohs heart. It Is not to be understood, as we
read it, God hardn'd Pharoah's heart. The words do not bear it, nor had any
such thing yet been in timated in the story. Here is an act of Stubbornness in
Pharaoh, an obstinate resistance or refusal, against Gods calls and miracles.
There was indeed a prediction of it, 2. 19. and that grounded only on Gods
prescience: which has no more influence on the effect, nor causality of it,
then your seeing of any object

II. Matthew. 16. 19. I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of Heaven. Here,
as in many other places, the kingdom of Heaven signifies the Chruch of Christ
militant. So, 23. 13. the Pharisees shutting up the Kingdom of Heaven, is the
keeping men from entering the Church, from becoming Christians. Peter, and in
him the rest of the Apostles, and Successors, Governors of the Church, had the
Keys of the Church given them, i. e. clearly, a power of shutting out, or
receiving into to the Visible militant Church, of removing the cotumacious by
censure of Excommunication, and readmitting them being humble penitents, by
Absolution.

III. Matthew. 12. 32. It shall not be forgiven him ((...) impersonally) he shall
not receive absolution, neither in this World, i. e. in the Church from the
Ecclesiastic Censure: nor in the World to come: i. e. at the day Judgment.

B.
I. 2. These. 3. 14. Have no company with him that he may be ashamed. The end of
Excommunication is, that the offender may be brought to a sense and shame of
his own vileness, the most necessary preparative to reformation: a great act of
mercy and charity, though under the show of Severity. It follows v. 15. Count
him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. This binding and loosing is
used as a means of exemplifying that great Truth that Christ came to save and
reduce that which was lost. Matthew. 18. 11.

II. Matthew. 20. 22. Ye know not what ye ask. Jesus represseth the Mothers
demand, by ^elling her, she is mistaken in the kind of dignity that should be
instated upon his disciples: not such a one, as in any worldly respects would
prove desirable, but, as a place of great burden, so subject to great
persecutions, and even death it self.

III. Matthew. 20. 26. but it shall not be so among you. Heathen princes use
their power in order to their own profit, and pleasure, and praise ((...))
behaving themselves as Lords and Masters over so many Servants. Your
pre-eminence brings along with it no great secular felicity, but an office of
burden, and pains and humility, and doing of service. The pre-eminence of
Christ himself was such. This excludes not disciples of Christ from power: for
he ownes the title of Lord and master, Joh. 13. 13. but from Lording, and
governing by violence, and in an imperious way, seeking their own gain and
honor.

C.
I. Romans 13. 2. They that resist shall receive to themselves damnation: (...),
Some render it Judgment, as that signifies some temporary punishment which the
higher powers may inflict, and nothing else. But v. 5. be subject not only for
wrath: temporal punishment is meant by wrath: which if it were all, then how
can it be true that we must be subject not only for that? He that resists shall
receive more then man's punishment, if he prevent it not by repentance; it
wounds his conscience, and binds him over to Gods punishment likewise.

II. 1 Pet 4. 17. Judgment must begin at the house of God. Here are specified
two parts of Judgment: (...), the first part; and (...), the end, or (as the
word sounds) the tail of it. So that only the tolerable easy part of the
Judgment belongs unto the godly: but the end, the dregs, the unsupportable
part, to those that obey not the Gospel. The first part is Gods retribution to
sin here, wherein the Godly have their part: the other, his rendering to the
wicked hereafter. Prove 11. 31.

III. Joh. 2. 15. He drove them all out of the Temple. This fact of Christ was
done jure Zelotarum, by a power that belonged to the Zelots: for whom the Law
allowed such liberty. Whereupon the disciples remembered how it was written of
him: The zeal of thine house, *((...)) has fed on me. Not all things that were
done by the Jews, under pretense of this right, were well done: but only such
as were done by men truly incired by God, like Phinehas and Elias.

The Eight Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew 16. 24. And take up his Cross. This extends to the voluntary
embracing of shame and contumely (for the Cross was a contumelious death Heb.
12. 2.) and consequently all other loss of goods, liberty etc. and beyond that,
pain of Body, and death it self. Which are said to be taken up, not when we
bring them unnecessarily upon our own shoulders; but whenby the providence of
God they are laid, or permitted to lie in our way to Christ, or Christian
Obedience; so that we cannot serve Christ perfectly, but that it must be some
detriment or damage to us; then voluntary to undergo that detriment, whatever
it is, is to take u^ the Cross.

II. Heb. 2. 10. To make the captain of our salvation perfect thr^ugh
sufferings. God bringing, or being about that gracious work of bringing many
sons unto glory, consecrated or inaugurated (so (...) signifies, the word used
at the consecration of Priests) Christ by sufferings. Who being so consecrated
((...)) became the Author of Eternal salvation, 5 9. Thus are we Christians to
exspect our (...), whether consecration to our dignity of being Kings and
Priests, i. e. Christians here, or consummation and crowning hereafter, by the
same method, by sufferings.

III. Heb. 12. 6. Whom the Lord loves he chastneth etc. Not only, if you be
not prepared to bear, but if you be without Chastisement, then are ye not sons.
Which when it is set down as an Aphorism of divine Observation in the Kingdom
of Christ, there will be no safety in laboring to avoid the literal importance
of it.

B.
I. Romans 8. 20. All things work together for good. Those all things are
specified v. 35. Tribulation, Distress, Persecution, etc. These are the things
to which the Lovers of God are foreappointed and predestinate: to those they
are called; to be conformable to Christ. So S. Peter also speaks, 1. 2. 21.

II. Mark. 10. 30. -- With persecutions. The hundred fold which Disciples are
promised to recieve now in this time, though they be secular blessings, houses
and brethren etc. yet must they be with persecution. Which words, though
neither St. Matthew nor St. Luke records, yet St. Peter, who dictated this
Gosple, remembered them, as he had most reason, being an Answer directed to a
question of his proposing. Those Duties, which are promised the greatest reward
on this earth, must not expect payment without a mixture.

III. Isa. 2. 4. They shall bea^ their swords into plow shares. It Is a phrase
to express the duty and obligation of Christians. Charity is the only Precept,
Peace the only despositum, that Christ took care to leave among them. They i.
e. These subjects of Christ's Kingdom that are his disciples indeed,
effectually changed by his Spirit, and made new Creatures, they will certainly
do so.

C.
I. Matthew 11. 30. My yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Some think, there
is no need of duty, Obedience is unnecessary Christ has a yoke and a burden.
Some confessing a necessity of Christian Obedience conceive it impossible.
Christ's yoke is easy, his burden light. Some yiedling both the necessity and
possibility, say it is an unpleasant task. Here is (...) for them; which
signifies more than easy, a gracious, joyou, and gainful yoke.

II. 2 Pet. 1. 20. No prophecy of the Scripture is of any private
interpretation. (...), of their own incitation, or motion: but the Prophets
were moved by the Holy Ghost, as it follows in the next verse.

III. 1. Cor. 3. 21. All things are yours: not absolutely, but subordinately:
Serviceable according to the exigence of your condition, and furtherance of
your salvation.

The Ninth Meeting.
A.
I. Psalm. 37. 25. I have not seen the righteous forsaken: Nor his seed begging
their bread. i. e. Never so wholly forsaken, if they were inheriters of their
Fathers hope and profession, as to make a constant trade of begging. Or thus:
never forsaken, though they begged their bread, but even in that extremity God
was present with them.

II. Ps. 66. 3. Through the greatness of thy power shall thy Enemies submit
themselves unto thee. In the Original it is, they shall lie unto thee; and so
it is translated by some, men^ientur. A forced submission to God is seldom in
truth.

III. Ps. 37. 16. A little that the righteous has, is better than great riches
of the ungodly. The righteous live, and eat, and are clothed, they have comfort
more, less anguish of heart, less vexation and contention of mind. And to them
it is all one, whether they go to Heaven through the gate or through the wicket.

B.
I. 1. COr. 6. 7. A fault, because you go to Law. The words are not positive,
but comparative: That a man should rather choose to leave his name, life, estate
unvindicated, then by defending them, unavoidably bring a Scandal upon Christ.

II. Jude 8. They speak evil of Dignities.) The word is (...) Glories. Men in
eminent place are, or should be, the glory of the places where they live.

III. Act. 7. 20. Moses was exceeding fair The word (...) signifies fine and
neat, so as Citizens are wont to be. (...) fair to God, divinely beautiful. By
addition of which word is fignified excellency. Jon. 3. Nineveh a very great
city, Heb-magna Deo.

C.
I. ECcles. 11. 1. Cast thy bread upon the Waters. Husbandmen to perpetuate the
fruits of the earth, cast some of their corn back again into a fruitful soil,
where the Waters come, and in due time receive it multiplied. So should we do
with Worldly goods, bestow some of them upon the bowels and backs of the poor
members of Christ, and in the day of harvest we shall have a great increase.

II* Amos. 2. 7. That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor.
The Prophet speaks of cruel oppressors, who greedily pursue the poor to
extremity, depriving them of their very livelihood, till they are fain to lie
down in the dust.

III. Duet. 24. 5. When a man has taken a new wife he shall not go out to War.
One reason my be this: because when the mind is strongly set upon any object,
till the strength of that desire is abated, a man will be unfit to deal with an
Enemy, or attend business.

The Tenth Meeting.
A.
I. Exodus 35. 30. The Skin of his f^shone. It is to denote the exceeding purity
and brightness of the Law, which no sinner is able (with peace) t^ look upon.

II. Genesis 25. 22. And the Children struggle^ together within her. Jacob was a
man of contention and wrestling from the beginning: Contention with his brother
in the Birth, Contention for the Birthright: Contention with an Angel for the
blessing: Contention for his Wife, and for his wages with Laban. He was a
Typical man: his name was Israel, and he was a pattern to the Israel of God. We
must be all men of Contention; contend and wrestle, not only with God in strong
and importunate prayers for his blessings but with our Elder Brother Esau, with
the lusts and frowardness if our own hearts.

III. Lament. ^. 39. Wherefore does a living man complain, etc. Here are Three
strong Reasons against murmurers. 1. We are Men. and at Gods dispose. 2. Sinful
men, punishment is our due. 3. Living, and therefore punished less then we
deserve.

B.
I. ISa. 1. 2. Hear O Heavens, and give ear O earth! Nothing so far from the
voice of the Prophet as the Heavens, nothing so dull and impenetrable as the
Earth: and yet the Heavens likeller to hear, the Earth likelier to listen and
attend, then Obdurate sinners.

II. Genesis 18. 21. I will not curse the ground any more for man's sake, for
(though so Jos. 17. 18.) though the imagination, etc. Although men are so
wicked, that if I would meo jure uti, take advantage to pour out my displeasure
upon them. I might do it every day, yet I will spare them.

III. 2. Cor. 5. 17. Behold all things are become new. If a man be Christ's,
there will be Nova regalia extremely opposite to those of sin, a new heart for
the throne of the Spirit, new members to be servants of righteousness, new
Counselors, namely the Laws of God; a new panoply, the whole armor of God;
new laws, the law of the mind; thoughts, Words, Actions, all new.

C.
I. Romans 7. 8, Without the Law sin was dead. The Law is said to quicken sin,
not perse, out of the intention of the Law, but by accident and antiperistasis,
exciting and provoking that strength which was in sin before, tho undiscerned,
and less operative: as the presence of an enemy does actuate and call forth
that malice, which lay habitually in the heart before.

II. 1 Cor. 7. 31. The Fashion of this world paseth away. (...), the figure,
intimating that there is nothing of firmness, or solid consistency in the
Creature: it is but a surface, and outside, an empty show; all the beauty of it
is but skin*deep.

III. Ephesians. 4. 26. Be angry but sin not. It is not a precept, but a speech by
way of Concession, or supposition. If through your infirmity, you be overtaken
with anger, do not harden the Passion into an habit: let not a spark become a
flame.

The Eleventh Meeting.
A.
I. Ephesians. 4. 30. Whereby ye are sealed. You are said to be sealed by the Spirit,
because that spiritual holiness, which is in the word, is fashioned into your
hearts, as the image of the seal in the wax,

II. Ephesians. 2. 2. Ye walked according to the course of this World. Such are
example, custom, good intentions, mercy taken without conditions, pleading
frailty of nature, we are all men, the best have their infirmities;
distinctions, extenuations, evasions, and such like.

III. Col. 2. 8. Beware lest any man spoil you through Philosophy and vain
deceit: Learning it self is an honorable and noble endowment. It Is recorded
for the glory of M^ses, that he was Learned in all the Wisdom of the
Egyptians. But corruption is apt to turn learning into leaven, to infect the
heart with pride; which being armed and seconded with Wit, breaks out into
perverse disputes.

B.
I. 1. TIm 6. 17. God gives us all things richly to enjoy. This importes a
delightful, sweet, orderly use of them: which is the fruit of the Gospel
promises. Wicked men have a lawful interest, possession, and use of them, but
all this does not reach to a fruition.

II. Hebr. 11. 1. Faith is the substance of things hoped for. Faith gives being
and present subsistency to things far distant from us; makes those things which
in regard of natural causes are very remote, in regard of Gods promises to seem
nigh at hand.

III. Hebr. 12. 2. Looking unto Jesus. We must not always cast our eye to the
clog: but look unto him that can carry us through all difficulties: Look what he
did, what contradiction he endured; look what he promises, a victory over our
lusts, and a crown after victory.

C.
I. Genesis 2. 9, 17. The Tree of Knowledge of good and evil. So called, because
it signified unto them, that as now while they stood upon terms of Obedience
with their Creator, they knew nothing but good, so, at what time soever they
did trangress his Commandment, they should begin to know evil also. Not but
they had an intellectual knowledge of it before (Rectum est index sui and
obliqui) but that till then they had never felt any evil, they never had any
Experimental knowledge of it.

II. 1 Cor. 3. 10. As a wise Master Builder I have laid the foundation. Great
Scholars possibly may think, that it stands not so well with their credit to
stoop so low, and spend time, in teaching the principles of the doctrine of
Christ: but they should consider these words of the great Apostle: That the
laying of the foundation skilfully, as it is the matter of greatest importance
in the whole building, so it is the very Master piece of the Builder.

III. Ezech. 18. 30. Make you a clean heart In another place, A new heart will
I give you. How do these consist? He commands us to do, what he promises to do
himself; to teach us, that it is the Work of his Grace, which we must not resist
when it is offered. Ille facit, ut nos faciamus quoe praecepit. Augustine.

The Twelfth Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew. 6. 11. Give us this Day our Daily bread. By saying, Give us, we
acknowledge that it is from God: but when we call it Ours, we show how God
gives it: namely in the use of means. For bread is ours, not only in the right
of the promise, but by service, and quiet working in an orderly calling.

II. Hebr. 6. 19. We have hope, as an anchor of the soul. We have no reason to
hope for any thing, which is not promised; nor upon other conditions, then as
promised. Wherefore, hope is compared to an anchor sure and steadfast; because
it must have something of firmness and stability to fasten upon, before it can
secure the soul in any tempest. To hope without a promise, or otherwise then it
stands, is but to let an anchor hang in the water, or catch in a wave, and
thereby to exspect safety to the Vessel.

III. 1 John 4. 20. He that loves not his brother whom he has seen, etc. How
can he abide the Sun of righteousness and the splendour of his holiness, who
cannot endure or delight in a ray of holiness in his Brother, being of the same
nature and passions with him?

B.
I. 2 PEt. 1. 4. Partaker of the divine nature. It notes two things. 1. a
participation of the divine Holiness which is communicated to us by our union
with Christ. 2. A participation of the divine Blessedness which is here begun,
and shall be complete in the beatifical vision of God.

II. Ps. 110. 3. The dew of thy birth is of the ^omb of the morning. The
prophet in passion of joy misplaceth his words. The right order is: Thy birth
from the Womb is as the morning dew, which waters and refreshes the whole
earth, not Gideons fl^ece alone, not the Jews only.

III. Col. 2. 3. In him are bid the treasures of Wisdom. Not, that they may
not be found, but that they may be sought, Christ has wisdom as a Kings
Treasurer has riches, as a Dispenser of it to the friends and servants of his
Father.

C.
I. JOh. 1* 16. Of his fullness have we all received, and Grace for Grace.
Christ was full, not as a Vessel, but as a fountain, and as a Sun, to
communicate unto us. And as a child in generation receives from his Parents
member for member; so in regeneration, Christ is fully formed in you, and you
receive in some measure and proportion Grace for Grace: there is no Grace in
Christ appertaining to general Sanctification, which is not in some degree
fashioned in you.

II. Joh. 3. 17. I came not to condemn the World. This was no motive or
impulsive cause of my Coming, though it were an accidental event, consequent,
and emergency thereupon. So is Christ a rock of offense, Romans 9 33. Set for the
fall of many. Luke 2. 14.

III. Ephesians. 4. 4. One body and one Spirit. The Spirit of Holiness was Chists,
jure proprio, and he was Full of Grace: his members have the Spirit derived to
them from their head; the same Spirit in truth, but not in the same measure of
Grace.

The Thirteenth Meeting.
A.
I. 1. COr. 2. 14. The natural man percieveth not the things of the Spirit,
etc. The word (...) does properly signify animalis. The animal man is such a
one, as gives himself up to the government of his inferior faculties: a carnal
sensual man: so that he is so far from being a man of reason, that he is most
irrational. Such a man recieveth not the things of God: he being drowned in
sensuality cannot relish such things, i. e. while he remains so. They are
spiri^ually discerned. i. e. by Virtue of a higher principle, then that which
is predominant in thi^ man. Men cannot receive the things of Gods Spirit, till
by the assistance thereof, their reason has regained its authority, and be
able to keep under their brutish affections.

II. Deuteronomy. 13. 1. etc. If there arise among you a Prophet, etc. From this
passage, these two things are plainly to be gathered. 1. That we are to
consider the doctrine it self, before we believe it to be of God, as well as
the means of its confirmation. 2. That God, for certain reasons, may suffer
wonders to be wrought, i. e. such things as no man can give account how they
should be effected by natural means, for the confirmation of a false doctrine.

III. Romans 4. 9. Jam. ^. 23. As S. Paul proved what he designed, by showing
that Abraham was justified by Faitb without the works of the Law; so S. James
proves his design by showing, that the Faith Abraham was justified by, was
such as discovered it self by Obedience to Gods commands; and instanceth in the
highest act of obedience too, viz. his offering Isaac upon the Altar.

B.
I. PHil. 3. 9. Not having my own righteousness, etc. He means that which
consisted in the observance of the Jewish Law: which he calls his own, as
being that which before his conversion he gloried in; or, which he obtained by
his own natural power consisting in merely external performances. To which he
opposes the Righteousness which is of God by Faith: i. e. the righteousness of
the new creature, wrought in him by Gods Holy Spirit and is an effect or fruit
of believing Christ's Gospel.

II. Phil. 3. 10. That I may know him, etc. i. e. experimentally, in raising me
up to newness of life, and in killing and mortifying all my corrupt affections.

III. Romans 4. 5. God justifies the ungodly. i. e. those that were once so:
before, not at the same time when they are justified. For, to say that God can
pronounce a person just and righteous, that is unjust and unrighteous, is a
contradiction to his own righteousness; and makes him to pronounce a false
sentence, and to do that which himself has declared an abomination, Prove. 17.
5.

C.
I. Romans 3. 28. A man is justified by Faith. We shall find that justification,
or remission of sins, is sometimes ascribed to other Virtues as well as to
faith: but then they are understood either in so general a sense as to include
Faith, or as supposing it. As, Act. 3. 19. to conversion and repentance: to
forgiveness of Trespasses, Matthew. 6. 14. to showing mercy, Matthew. 5. 7. to
works, or sincere Obedience, Jam. 2. 24. But whereas Justification is mostly
attributed to Faith, the reason is, because all other Graces are Virtually
contained in it; and that is the principle from whence they are derived.

II. Romans 4. 22. It was imputed to him for Righteousness. His Faith (which we
know was not idle but very operative) was of the same account with God, (...)
it was reckoned (as in two Verses of this Chapter it is translated) or it was
valued by God at as high a rate, as if it were complete righteousness. Christ's
imputed right^o^sness, or the imputation of Christ's righteousness is not to be
found in all the Bible. It may be allowed in this notion: That those which are
sincerely righteous, and from an inward living principle allow themselves in no
known sin, nor in the neglect of any known duty (which is to be truly
Evangelicall righteous) shall be dealt with and rewarded, in and through
Christ, as if they were perfectly so.

III. Phil. 2. 13. Work, etc. For it is God which works in you, etc. The
Apostle here reconciles the doctrine of Gods Grace with, and shows the
indispensableness of men's endeavors, making Gods readiness to work in us to
will by his preventing grace, and to do by his assisting, a motive to us to
work out our own salvation.

The Fourteenth Meeting.
A.
I. HEb. 8. 10. I will put my Law into their hearts, etc. It cannot be; I will
do all for them, they need do nothing at all. This would make all the precepts
of the Gospel insignificant. Neither can this be the sense: I will sanctify
their natures, and so cause them to keep my Laws without their concurrence in
that act: But, I will afford them my grace and spirit, whereby they
cooperating therewith, and not being wilfully wanting to themselves, shall be
enabled so to do. Or, I will do all that reasonable Creatures can reasonably
expect from me, toward the writing of my Laws in their hearts.

II. Heb. 8. 11. And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, etc. i. e.
There shall be no need of such pains in teaching men how they must obey the
Lord, and what they are to do, as under the Law of Moses (which consisted in
Observations that were only good because commanded) but the Precepts now given
shall be found written in every man's heart; so that none need be ignorant of
what is enjoined for the substance of it, that will consult the dictates of
their own nature.

III. Gal. 3. The law was added because of transgression, etc. The Jewish and
Mosaical law (in a strict sense) was not given as any new condition, whereby
they were to attain to the promises; but they should, till they were fulfilled
be restrained and kept under discipline, backed on by temporal rewards and
punishments.

B.
I. Romans 5. 1. Being justified by Faith. Faith put for the doctrine of Faith,
Justify, as an instrument (as the Law condemns) as it contains the Covenant
of Grace, and holds forth pardon to sinners. Faith, as it signifies the
Virtue or duty of Faith, justifies as it is the condition of the new Covenant,
wherein forgiveness of sin is offered. God the Father is the principle
efficient cause, Jesus Christ the only meritorious cause of justification.

II. Jam. 4. 8. Cleanse your hands ye sinners. The Scripture seems one while to
give all to God in the work of regeneration and conversion, and another while
to make it wholly men's w^^ act. To reconcile the places Cleanse you -- I will
Clense] we must go in a middle way. I mean, that where God speaks as if he did
all in this great work, we are to judge, that he supposes men's endeavors; and
where he speaks as if men were to do all, that he supposes the concurrence and
assistance of his own grace.

III. Jam. 1. 26. He that seems to be Religious and bridleth not his tongue,
that man's Religion is vain. May we not justly fear upon the account of the
reviling and censuring (even their superiors too) not a few of the Godly party
(so called) are guilty of that they are no better than mere pretenders to
Religion, as great a profession as they make of it.

C.
I. JAm. 2. 24. A man is justified by works, and not by Faith only.) As works
signify sincere Obedience to Christ's Gospel, we cannot account it any seandal
to have it said of us, that we hold Justification by works. Why should any man
be more shy of acknowledging this than St. James. Nor need we so mince it, as
to say that Faith justifies our person, and works our Faith: for understanding
Works, for a Working Faith, our persons (is ever they be) must be justified by
them. We must not give the Papists occasion to think, we have a slight opinion
of good Works.

II. Ezeck. 18. As I live says the Lord. Although God professes kindness to all
men, and says, nay swears too, that he wills not the death of sinners, but
had rather they would turn from their wickedness and live: yet, according to
the doctrines of some men, this is but a declaration of his Voluntas signi, The
like to which should one assert concerning any honest man, he would think
himself not a little reproached.

III. Joh. 3. 17. God sent not his Son into the World to condemn the World. If
the doctrine of absolute Reprobation be true, our Saviors coming was to
aggravate the Condemnation of the generality of men (which would be far more
properly called the World, then a very few) for not believing in him, who never
died for them, so much as to put them into a possibility of being saved.

The fifteenth Meeting.
A.
I. HE gave himself for a ransom for many: for the Vulgus, or multitude of the
people. So the word (...) which is rendered many does among the Greeks most
commonly signify. And St. Paul says, He gave himself a ransom for all, 1 Timothy 2. and did taste death for every man, Heb. 2. 9. and that he is the
Savior of all men, though especially of those that believe. And he sadly
bewailed men's not coming that they might have life; and wept over Jerusalem for
her obstinate persisting in unbelief, and most pathetically with tears wished,
that she had known, in that her day, the things that be^onged to her peace.

II. 2 Timothy 3. 2. Men shall be lovers of themselves, proud, covetous, etc. In
this and other places where men's sins are foretold, instead of shall, we may
put will. The shalls make those Places look as if they contained declarations
of desires, whereas wills would make them ^t first sight to appear that they
contain only ^redictions and expressions of Gods f^re-knowledge, that men
would commit such and such sins, not of his Will and purpose that they should.

III. Romans 9. 13. Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated. This is a
quotation out of Malachy 1. 3. Where Esau's person was not spoken of, but by
Esau* his posterity, the Edomits are understood. He meant no more tha^ that he
less loved them than the Israelites, or was not so kind to them, as he was to
these. Or, we may conceive, that by hating is to be understood very severely
punishing, which was after their wicked and most unnatural behavior toward
their brethren, an^ upon that account. See Obad. 10. Not^ what was said to
Rebecca, that two Nation^ were in her Womb. And, Esau in his ow^ person did
never serve Jacob.

B.
I. Romans 9. 15. I will have mercy on who^ I will have mercy. i. e. I will
besto^ my kindness where I please, without givin^ account to any one. And
therefore God man justly accept Gentiles to his special favor, ^ idolatrous
and wicked as generally they a^ (for he is not obliged to damn all that defer^
it) and cast off his ancient people the Jew^ at his pleasure, as strict
observers as they are of one Law, they being disobedient to another.

II. Romans 9. 16. So then it is not of him that wills etc. i. e. From thence
it is evident, that this mercy and favor of God is not the desert and
prerogative of those that with great Zeal aspire to it, but in a wrong way, i.
e. by the Mosaical performances, as the Jews do (See v. 31. 32.) but to be had
from the Free Grace and mercy of God by Jesus Christ.

III. Romans 9. 17, For this same purpose have I raised thee up. Heb. I have made
thee stand. Vulg. sustentavite* Pharaoh having hardn'd his own heart, God at
length says concerning him that he would harden his heart in his just
judgment, i. e. does at which he would be further hardn'd by: and adds, that
he would presently cut him off, but that he preserved him, and raised him out
of great dangers, for no other end but to make him an example of his just
indignation against obdurate rebels in the more signal and illustrious manner.

C.
1. Romans 9. 18. Whom he will ^e hardneth. We are not to understand any action
of his, whereby he puts wickedness into men, or intends, and increases that
which is already in them: for then would he be the Author of sin; which to
assert is the highest blasphemy: Neither Gods withdrawing all manner of
necessary helps whereby sinners may be mollified: but no more than his doing
such things to wicked men, which are not in their own nature, but accidentally,
through their Wickedness the occasion of further hardening. And so and no
otherwise, he did harden the Jews; nay, chiefly were they hardn'd by the divine
forbearance.

II. V. 20. Who art thou that reply against God? As for his dealing in such
a manner with you, as that you become by that means more hardened, and averse to
obey his Gospel, you may thank your selves for it, and therefore have no cause
to object against Gods justice. It Is long of your own wickedness that you
become more hardened by any of his providence.

III. Romans 9. 22. The Vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. They are such as
the Apostle says, God endured with much long suffering; and therefore they
were not made so by any absolute decree of his, but made themselves so by their
wilful and free-sinning. For what long-suffering can it be, to bear with the
sins of those that could never have possibly been avoided? The Apostle here
asserts not any other reprobation of the Jews, then that, which wilful
reprobation of the Messiah was the cause of. Gods purpose to cast them off, so
far as that they should be no more a distinct nation or body politic, was
unchangeable: not; that none of them should come to eternal salvation.

The sixteenth Meeting.
A.
I. JEr. 10. 23. The way of man is not in himself. Our purposes sink and fail
almost as soon as they are up. In matters of indifferency, and sometimes in
those of the greatest Concernment; we think we resolve, when we do but think.
And what strength has such a thought against a friend and importunity.

II. Jam. 1. 16. Err not] Men are prone to error. Hence it is, that God is made
more cruel then man, and yet more merciful than he is: That men are Saints, and
yet the Law impossible: That imputed righteousness is all, when we have none of
our own: That our Election may be sure, tho we do not make it so: That
Christian liberty is let loose against Christ himself. That God is brought in
to do himself what he does command: That Grace is miraculous and irresistible,
etc.

III. Act. 4. 12. Toll Augustinum de causa, Take away the names of Augustine,
of Luther, of Calvin, and Arminius, for they are but names, not arguments.
There is but one name by which we must be saved: and his name alone must have
authority and prevail with us, who is the Author and finisher of our Faith. We
may honor others, and give unto them that which is theirs; but we must not
deifie them, nor pull Christ out of his throne, to place them in his room.

B.
I. Matthew. 5: 9. Blessed are the peacemakers. It was as wise counsel as could
have been given to those who sat to solve knotty doubts, and to determine
controversies in Religion in the Council at Dort, and it was given by a King,
and it would have made good his motto, and styled him a peacemaker, tho there
had been nothing else to contribute to that title; Paucissima defimienda, quia
paucissima necessaria, That they should not be too busy and earnest in
defining and determining many things, because so few were necessary. Questions
in Divinity are like meats in this: The more delicate and subtle they are, the
sooner they putrify.

II. 1 Cor. 15. 43. I do not enquire, how the body, that shall rise, can be the
same numerical body with that which did walk upon the earth: it is enough for
me to know, that it is sown in dishonor, and shall be raised in Glory: And my
business is to rise with Christ here, and make good my part in this first
resurrection, for then I am secure, and need not to extend my thoughts to the
end of the world to survey and comprehend the second.

III. Jude 3. It were to be wished, that men would in Scripture Phrase speak of
the acts of God (as in Justification) and not seek out diverse inventions, which
do not edify, but many times shake and rend the Church in pieces, and lay the
truth it self open to reproach: which had triumphed Gloriously over error, had
men contended, not for their own inferences and deductions: for that Common
Faith which was once delivered to the Saints.

C.
I. GAl. 5. 6. What profit is it busily to enquire, whether the nature of
Faith, by which we are justified, consists in an obsequious assent, or in a
more fiducial apprehension of the merits of Christ; whether it be an
instrument, or condition; when I may seek and rest upon this, which every eye
must needs see, That it must not be a dead, but a Faith working by Charity:
Which is the language of Faith, and demonstrateth her to be alive. My sheep
hear my voice, says Christ: (...) says Basil. They hear and Obey, and never
dispute or ask questions: they taste and not trouble and mud that clear water
of life. Men talk of Faith and the power of it, and are worse than infidels; of
Justification, and please themselves in unrighteousness; of Christ's active
Obedience, and are to every good work reprobate; of his passive Obedience, and
deny him when they should suffer for him; of the inconsistency of Faith and
good works in their Justification, and set them at as great a distance in their
lives and conversations.

II. Gal. 5. 24. Certainly it would be more safe for us, and more worthy our
calling, to be diligent and sincere in that which is plainly revealed; to
believe, and in the strength and power of that Faith to crucify our flesh with
the affections and lusts, then to be drawing out of schemes and measuring out
the actions and operations of God. For then our work is done, and all Gods
promises are Yea and Amen, and fall close with the performance of our duty.

III. 2 Cor. 10. 5. It is necessary to bring in to captivity every thought to
the Obedience of Christ, but it is not necessary to be under this or that
discipline, tho the best, further then in affection and desire. For, in the
midst of the changes and chances of this world, we cannot be what we would, nor
be governed as we please.

The Eighteenth Meeting.
A.
I. REv. 2. 10. All art and endeavor has been used by many, to make
themselves great on earth; the one half of which might have wrought out a crown
for them in a better place. For that may be had if we will, and if we be
Faithful to the death it will fall upon our heads.

III. 1 Cor. 2. 7. Romans 16. 25. We speak says S. Paul, the Wisdom of God in a
mystery, the hidden Wisdom, and the Gospel is the revelation of that mystery.
And if it be revealed, it is no longer hidden: if it be known, as fa^ as it is
known it is not a mystery: And if it were yet a hidden mystery it could not
concern us; because that can have no influence upon our will which yeildeth no
light at all to our understanding. Mysteries when they are hidden are to us as
nothing: I know now no mysteries in Divinity: for it is agreed on all hands,
that whatsoever is necessary to the end is perspicuous and naked to the
understanding. I may say, mystical Divinity is an art of teaching nothing, of
moving and standing still; an art of filling men with empty speculations.

III. Job. 12. 20. When power speaks, every mouth must be stopped, Logic has
no sinews, an argument no strength, Antiquity no authority, Councils may err,
the Fathers were but Children, all Churches must yield to one, and the first
Age be taught by the last: Speech is taken away from the crafty, and
understanding from the aged.

B.
I. Psalm. 49. 20. We were enemies to God, fallen from our first honor, and
made like the beasts that perish. But now, by Christ's assimilation to us we are
made like unto God; we are exalted by his humiliation, raised by his descent,
magnified by his minoration.

II. Heb. 11. 17. Wherefore in all things it behooves him to be made like unto
his brethren. Each answers other: Christ made like unto men: and again, Men
made like unto him, so like that they are brethren: Christ made like in all
things, which fill up the office of a Redeemer; and men made like unto God in
all things, which may be required at the hands of those who are Redeemed. There
is a kind of Convertency in these terms, Christ and his Brethren. Christ like
unto his brethren, and these brethren like unto Christ. Christ is ours, and we
are Christ's. 1 Cor. 3. 23.

III. Psalm. 52. 9. Lay us in the balance, We are lighter than vanity it self,
(...), Men fallen below the Condition of men, Lame and impotent, not able to
move one step in the ways of Glory, Living dead men. Who will now stand up for
us? Who but he, who is the Captain of our salvation. Heb. 3. 10.

C.
I. ISa. 5^. 8. The Captain of our salvation is the true Son of God begotten
not made; the brightness of the Father, streaming from him as light from light;
his Image, not according to his humane nature, but according to his divine: the
Image and Character, not of any qualities in God, but of his person; the true
stamp of his substance, begotten as brightness from the light, as the character
from the type, as the word from the mind: which yet do not fully declare him.
Quis enarrabit? Who shall declare his generation. The manner is known only to
the Father who begat, and to the Son who is begotten. Thy Faith is thy honor:
a great favor it is that thou art taught to believe that he is the eternal
begotten Son of God.

II. Joh 1. 14. The Word was made flesh. As the soul and body, tho two distinct
natures, grow into one man: so did the Godhead assume the manhood without
confusion of the natures, or distinction of the persons. They are united as the
Sun and light, as a graf^ to a plant: As in a fiery Sword there are two
distinct natures, the fire and the sword; two distinct acts, to cut and to
burn; and two distinct effects cutting and burning; from whence arises one
common effect, to cut burning, and to burn cutting. This must be rasted cum
grano salis, and seasoned witha sober application. For there is some
resemblance, but great disproportion.

III. 1 Pet. 1. 12. The Angels themselves those second lights, wax dim with
admiration, and their holy desire is to stoop and bow down and look into this
mystery. All the representations the wit of man can find out, cannot express
it, but they leave us still in our gaze and wonder, whilst the manner of it is
hid from our eyes. Those beasts which came too near to this mountain, this high
mystery, were stricken through with a dart, and staggerd in the very at tempt,

The Eighteenth Meeting.
A.
I. JOh. 5. 39. Search the Scriptures: for they are they that testify of
Christ. They testify that he was God blessed for evermore: That that word
which was God was also made flesh: That he was the Son of God and the Son of
man. The manner how the two dist^nct natures are united is unsearchable and
unfordable: and the knowledge of it, if our narrow understanding could recieve
it, would not add one hair to our stature and growth in Grace. That Christ is
God and man, that the two natures are united in the Person of thy Savior and
Mediator, is enough for thee to know, and to raise thy nature up to him.

II. Joh. 17. 24. Father,, I will that they whom thou have given me (and he
gives him none but those who are like him) be where I am. Heaven has received
him; and it will recieve none but those who are like him, holy as he is Holy
just as he is just, humble ble as he is humble: not those that name him; not
those who set his name to their fraud, to their malice, to their perjury, to
their oppression; not those many Antichrists, whose whole life is a
Contradiction to him.

III. In the volumn of the book it is written of him, and in the same volumn we
shall find it written of us, that we should do Gods will, and have his Law in
our hearts. And in this, as in other things, our first thought, should be what
will become us. An humble Christ, and a proud Christian* an Obedient Christ,
and a traitorous Christian; Christ fasting, and a Christian riding, non been
convenient, there is no decorum in it, nothing but absurdity and incongruity.

B.
I. Luke 16. Is it necessary to be rich? Be-hold Dives in hell, and Lazarus in
Abraham's bosom. Is it necessary to be noble? Not many noble are chosen: Is it
necessary to be learned? Where is the Scribe? where is the Disputer of this
World? 1 Cor. 1.

II. Psalm. 72. 18. When we say, He only can do wondrous works; When in all
humility we acknowledge, that he can do more than we can think; that he can
uphold us when we are ready to fall, enrich us in our poverty, strengthen us in
weakness supply us with all necessary means and encouragements in this race;
when we believe and rely on it, that he can tread down all our enemies, and
bind. Satan in chains; that he is able to immortalize our flesh, to raise us
out of the dust and set us in heavenly places; we need not set our Songs and
Hallelujahs to a higher note.

III. Romans 8. 32. He that spared not his own Son, etc. He that gives his Son,
will also give salvation: And he that gives salvation, will give all things
that may work it out. It is impossible it should be otherwise, Christ comes
not naked, but clothed with blessings: He comes not empty, but with the riches
of Heaven, the treasures of wisdom and happiness: Christ comes not alone, but
with troops of Angels, with glorious promises and blessings. Nay, to make it
unanswerable; It is his nakedness that clotheth us, his poverty that enricheth
us, his no reputation that enobleth us, his mino^ation that makes us great,
and his exmanition and emptying of himself that fills us, and his being
delivered for us delivers to us the possession of all things.

C.
I. JOh. 3. 16. So God loved the world, etc. Must the Son of God be delivered?
Love sends him down. Charitas de caelo demisit Christum. It was love that
bowed the heavens, when he descended. Must he suffer? Love nailed him to the
cross, and no power could do it but love. Must he be sacrificed? Love calls
it a baptism, and is str^itned till the sacrifice be slain. Must he dye? Must
the. Son of God dye? Love calls it (...) his perfection. Heb. 2. 10.

II. Mark. 14. 36. The bitter ingredients so filled up his Cup, that he made it
his Prayer to have it taken out of his hand. The consideration of which truth
induced some to conceive that sense of pain had so weakened his intellectual
faculties that he forgot himself. Non fuit haec meditata Christi oration, Calv*
But we may truly say, Non fuit haec interpretis meditata oration: that would
leave Wisdom it self without the use of it. No question it was the language of
a bleeding heart, and the resultance of grief. There was no disorder, no
fullenness in it.

III. Matthew. ^6. 39. He prayed, Let this Cup pass from me: But that was not, as
some think, the Cup of his Cross and Passion but the Cup of his agony. And in
that prayer it is plain he was heard; For there appeared an Angel unto him from
heaven to strengthen him Luke 22. 43.

The Nineteenth Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew. 27. 46. Why have thou forsaken me: God in a manner forsook him,
restrained his influence, denied relief, withdrew comfort, stood as it were a
far off, and let him fight it out unto death.

II. Tit. 3. 4. We must seek the true cause in the bosom of the Father, nay in
the bowels of his Son, and there see, why he was delivered for us written in
his heart: It was (...), the love of God to mankind. Delexisti me, Domine,
plusquam te, quando mori voluisti pro me. August. Such a high esteem did he set
upon a Soul, which we scarce honor with a thought but so live as if we had
none.

III. Esai. 53. 5. He was wounded for our trangressions. Our sins nailed him to
the cross, which not only crucified him in his humility, but crucify him still
in his glory, now he sits at the right hand of God, and put him to shame to
the end of the world. Falso de Judaeis querimur. Why complain we of the Jews
malice? or Judas's treason? or Pilat's injustice? We, we are they, who
crucified the Lord of Life. Our treachery was the Judas which betrayed him: Our
malice, the Jews which accused him: Our perjury, the false witness against him:
Our injustice, the Pilat that condemned him: Our pride scorned him: Our envy
grinned at him: Our luxury spate upon him, Our Coveteousness sold him.

B.
I. Romans 8. 32. For us all. All, not considered as elect, or reprobate; but as
men, as sinners. ^or that name will take in all, for all have sinned: some turn
all into few, make the World not the world, and whosoever not whosoever, but
some certain men; ded^ct whom they please out of all people, nations, and out
of Christendom it self: leave some few with Christ upon the Cross, whose
persons he bears, whom they call the elect, and mean themselves.

II. Joh. 3. 16. God so loved the World, i. e. the Elect, say they: They are
the World; where it is hard to find them, for they are called out of it. And
the best light we have, which is the Scripture, discovers them not unto us in
that place. If the Elect be the World which God so loved, then they are such
Elect as may not believe; such elect as may perish, and whom God will have
perish if they do not believe. It is true, none have benefit of Christ's death
but the elect: but from hence it does not follow that none might have had.

III. 1 Timothy 4. 10. God is the Savior of all men, but especially of them that
believe. All, if they believe and repent; and those who are Obedient to the
Gospel, because they do. The blood of Christ is poured forth on the Believer
and with it he sprinkleth his heart, and is saved; the Wicked trample it under
their feet and perish.

C.
I. 2 PEt. 3. 9. God would not that any should perish. In this all agree: both
hold up the privilege of a believer, and leave the rod of the Stubborn
impenitent to fall upon him: The death of Christ is not applied to all, say
some: It is not for all, say others. The Virtue of Christ's meritorious passion
is not made use of by all, say some. It was never intended that it should, say
others. The event is the same: For if it be not made use of and applied, it is
as if it were not, as if it had never been obtained.

II. Joh. 3. 19. This is the condemnation that light came into the world, etc.
The Indians live at the very rising of the Sun, yet their bodies are black, and
swarthy, and resemble the night: So, many there be who live in the very region
of light, where the beams fall upon them hot and pure, and are darted at their
very eyes, and yet they remain the Children of darkness. Facit infidelitas
multorum ut Christus non pro omnibus moriatur, qui pro omnibus mortuus est.
Amb. Infidelity and impenitence are the worst restrictives, that contract and
sink all into a few.

III. Heb. 1. 3. Christ is the brightness of his glory. And if we do not still
Love darkness, and make it a pavilion round about us; he will look upon us
through this light, and look lovingly upon us with favor and affection.

The Twentieth Meeting.
A.
I. 1 COr. 3. 21. All things are yours, when you are Christ's. There is a civil
dominion and right to these things: and this we have jure Creationis, by right
of Creation. For the earth is the Lords, and he has given it to the Sons of
men. And there is an evangelical dominion; not the power of having them, but
the power of using of them to Gods Glory; that they may be a gift: and this we
have jure adoptionis, by right of adoption, as the Sons of God, begotten in
Christ.

II. 2 Cor. 4. 4. St. Paul calls the Devil, the God of this World: and
Worldings in effect make him so: For as if he had been lifted up and nailed to
the cross for them, to him every knee does bow: nor will they receive the true
Messiah but in his shape: they conceive him giving gifts, not spiritual but
temporal, not the graces of the Spirit, humility, meekness and Contentedness;
but Silver and gold; making not Saints, but Kings upon the earth.

III. 1 Cor. 3. 21. With Christ we have all things, which work to that end for
which he was delivered. We have his commands, which are the pledges of his
Love: We have his promises of immortality and eternal life: He has given
Faith, to apprehend and receive the promises, and hope to lift us up unto them:
He has given us his Pastors to teach us: He has given us his Angels to
minister unto us: He has given us his Spirit, and filled us with his Grace, if
we will recieve it, which will make his commands which are now grievious,
easy; which may carry us on in a regular and peaceable course of piety and
obedience: all those things we have with Christ.

B.
I. GAl. 6. I am crucified with Christ. Let us recieve Christ in his shame, in
his Sorrow, in his Agony, take him hanging on the cross; take him, and take a
pattern by him: that as he was, so we may be troubled for our sins; that we may
mingle our tears with his blood, drag sin to the bar, accuse and condemn it,
revile and spit in its face at the fairest presentment it can make, and then
nail it to the cross; that it may languish and faint by degrees, till it give
up the Ghost and dye in us.

II. Heb. 7. 26. Such a High Priest became us, who is not only merciful, but
just: not only meek, but powerful: not only fair, but terrible; not only
clothed with the darkness of humility, but with the shining robes of majesty;
who can dye and can live again, (Revel. 1. 18) and live for evermore; who
suffered himself to be judged and condemned, and shall judge and condemn the
world it self.

III. Luke 24. 26. Tota Ecclesia cum Christo computatur ut una persona: Christ
and his Church are in computation but one person. He ought to suffer, and they
ought to suffer: they suffer in him, and he in them, to the end of the World.
Nor is any other method answerable, either to his infinite Wisdom and Justice,
which has set it down in indelible Characters; or to our mortal and frail
condition, which must be bruised before it can be healed, and be levelled with
the ground before it can be raised up. That which is convenient for Christ, is
profitable for us. That which becomes him, we must wear as an ornament of
grace unto our head. There is an oportet set upon both: He ought, and we ought,
first to suffer, and then to enter into glory, to dye first, that we may rise
again.

C.
I. HEb. 4. 15. and ^. 17. There is life in Christ's death, and comfort in his
sufferings. For we have not such an High Priest who will not help us, but
(which is one and a chief end of his suffering and death) Who is touched with
the feeling of our infirmities, and is merciful and faithful: has not only
power (for that he may have and not show it) but will and propension also,
desire and diligent care to hold up them who are ready to fall, and to bring
them back, who were even brought to the gates of death. He has Learnt
compassion by his sufferings and death. For the way to be sensible of another
misery, is first to feel it ourselves.

II. Joh 20. 29. Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed. Why
should the Resurrection of Chist be made manifest to the eye? this is not to
seek to confirm and establish, but to destroy our Faith. For if these truths
were as evident as it is that the Sun does shine, when it is day, the
apprehension of them were not an act of our faith but of our knowledge.
Therefore Christ showed not himself openly to all the people at his
resurrection; ut fides non mediocri proemio destinata, non nisi difficultate
constaret, Tertul. That Faith, by which we are destined to a Crown, might not
consist without some difficulty, but commend it self by our Obedience; the
perfection and beauty whereof is best seen in making its way through
difficulties.

III. Joh. 7. 48. Did any of the Pharisees believe in him? And the reason of
this is plain: For tho Faith be an act of the understanding, yet it depends
upon the Will, and men are incredulous, not for want of those means which may
raise a Faith, but for want of Will to follow that light, which leads to it:
they do not believe because they will not, and so bear themselves strongly upon
opinion preconceived, beyond the strength of all evidence whatsoever. When
affections and lusts are high and stand out against it, the evidence is put by
and forgot, and the Object, which calls for our eye and Faith, begins to
disappear and vanish, and at last is nothing.

The one and twentieth Meeting.
A.
I. COl. 3. 3. Our life, says the Apostle, as hid with Christ in God: And
whilst we leave it there by a continual meditation of his meritorious
suffering, by a serious and practical application of his glorious Resurrection,
we hide it in the bosom of Majesty, and no dart of Satan can reach it

II. 1 Timothy 3. 5. and 5. 17. The pastors are set a part in Christ's stead to
minister to his Church, yea to rule and govern his Chuch. And they carry about
with them his commission, a power delegated from him to sever the Goats from
the Sheep, even in this life, that they may become Sheep, to segregate them, to
abstain or withhold them, to exanctorate them, to throw them out, to strike
then with the pastoral rod, to anathematize hem, etc. This was the language of
the first and purest times. By degrees this power fell in its esteem through
some abuse of it, it being drawn down from that most profitable and necessary
end, for which it was given: and this at last brought all Religion into
disgrace.

III. Job. 18. 14. Death is a King of terrors: But Christians, having the
divine Image restored in them, are secure and fear it not. For what can that
Tyrant take from them? Their life? That is hid with Christ in God. It cannot
cut them off from pleasures: for their delight is in the Lord. It cannot rob
them, of their treasure. For that is laid up in Heaven. It can take nothing
from them but what themselves have already crucified, their flesh. It cannot
cut off one hope, one thought, one purpose: for all their thoughts, purposes
and hopes, were levelled not on this but in another life.

B.
I. Luke 19 41. shall Christ shed his blood for his Church, that it may be one
with him, and at unity in it self, and can thou not drop a tear when thou
see this his body thus rent in pieces, as it is at this day? when thou see
the world, the love of the World, break in and make such havoc in the Church
(Oh it is a sad Contemplation!) will none but Christ weep over Jerusalem?

II. Romans 10. 10. He that believes from the heart cannot but be obedient to
the Gospel: Unless we can imagine, there can be any man that can so hate
himself as deliberately to cast himself into hell, and run from happiness, when
it appears in so much Glory.

III. Act. 2. 1. when the day of Pentecost was Come, Every day to a Christian
is a day of Pentecost: his whole life a continued holy day, wherein the Holy
Ghost descends, both as an Instructor and as a Comforter, secretly and
sweetly by his word characterizing the Soul, and imprinting saving knowledge;
not forcing or drawing by violence, but sweetly leading and guiding us into all
truth.

C.
I. JOel. 2. 28. I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh. Christ's Advent was
for the fulfilling of the Law, and the Spirits for the fulfilling and
completing of the Gospel: Christ's advent, to Redeem the Church; and the
Spirits, to teach the Church: Christ, to shed his blood; and the Spirit, to
wash and purge it in his blood; Christ, to pay down the ransom for us
Captives; and the Spirit, to knock off our fetters: Christ to preach the
acceptable year of the Lord; and the Spirit, to interpret it.

II. Joh. 16. 13. He will guide you into all truth. Ille, He, designeth a
certain person, and Ille, He, in Christ's mouth, a distinct person from himself.
Besides we are taught in the Schools, Actiones sunt suppositorum, Actions and
operations are of persons.

III. Joh. 16. 13. The Spirit of Truth. We may be zealous, and not cruel;
devout, and not superstitious: we may hate Idolatry, and not commit sacrilege;
stand fast in our Christian liberty, and not make it a cloak of miliciousness,
if we did follow the Spirit in all his ways, who in all his ways is a Spirit of
Truth. For he Commands zeal, and forbids r^ge; he commends devotion, and
forbids superstition; he condemns Idolatry, yea, and condemns
sacrilege; he preaches liberty, and preaches obedience to superiors; and in
all is the same Spirit.

The two and Twentieth Meeting.
A.
I. JOh. 20. 21. As my Father sent me, sait^ our Savior to his Disciples, so
send ^ you. And he sends us too, wh^ are haereditarii Christi discipuli,
Christ's discipl^s by inheritance and succession; that every one, as he is
endowed from above, should serve him by serving one another. And tho our
serving him cannot deserve that name, yet is he pleased to call it helping him:
that we should help him to feed the hungry, to guide the blind, and teach the
ignorant; and so be Christ's Vicars, as the spirit is Christ's.

II. 1 Timothy 1. 10. He brought Life and Immortality to light. For whatsoever the
Prophets and great Rabbis had spoken of immortality, was but darkness in
comparison of this great light.

III. 1 Cor. 2. 2. I determined to know nothing but Christ and him crucified.
Here his desire has a non ultra. This truth is all: this joyneth Heaven and
Earth together, God and Man, mortality and immortality, misery and happiness in
one, draw^th us near unto God, and makes us one with him.

B.
I. Ephesians. 2. 8. Faith is called the gift of God, not only because it is given
to every bel^ever (and too many are too willing to stay till it be given) but
because the Spirit first found out the way to save us by so weak a means as
Faith. And as he first found it out, so he teaches it, and leaves out
nothing, not a tittle, not an Iota, which may serve to complete and perfect
this divine Science.

II. Joh, 16. 13. -- into all Truth. The Spirit (in the Gospel) has framed
rules an^ precepts to order and regulate all the faculties of our soul, in
every act, in every motion and inclination: if the Eye offend, pluck it out: if
the Hand, cut it off: Rules, which limit the Understanding to the knowledge of
God, bind the Will to obedience, moderate and confine our affections, level our
hope, fix our Joy, stint our Sorrow; frame our Speech, compose our Gesture,
Fashion our Apparel, set and methodize our outward Behavior.

III. 1 Cor. 13. The acts of Charity are manifest. Charity suffers long, even
injuries and errors; but does not rise up against that which was set up to
enlarge and improve her. Charity is not rash, to beat down every thing that had
its first rise and beginning from Charity. Charity is not puffed up, swells
not against a harmless, yea, and an useful constition, tho it be of man.
Charity ^e^keth not her own, treads not the public peace underfoot to
procure her own. Charity thinks no evil, does not see a serpent under every
leaf, nor Idolatry in every bough of devotion. If we were Charitable, we could
not but he peaceable.

C.
I. REpent and believe the Gospel. See God has shut up Eternity within the
compass of two words, Believe and Repent, the sum of all he taught. Lay your
foundation right, and then build upon it. Because God loved you in Christ, do
you love him in Christ: Love him and keep his Commandments, than which no other
way could have been found out to draw you near unto God. Believe and Repent
this is all. What malice, what defiance, what gall and bitterness amongst
Christians? yet this is all, Believe and Repent. Every part of Christendom
almost is a stage of war, and this pretense is written in their banners, you
may see it waving in the air: For God and Religion: yet this is all, Believe
and Repent. Who would once think, there should be such wars and fighting
amongst Christians for that which is shut up and brought unto us in these two
words, Believe and Repent; for this is the Gospel of Christ, this is the whole
will of God.

II. Act. 10. 34. Of a truth I perceive, that God is no respecter of persons:
i. e. that now ^he partition wall is broken down, that Jew and Gentile are both
alike, and the Church which was formerly shut up in Judea, is now become
Catholic: a body which every one that will may be a member of.

III. Ephesians. 2. 20. Christ sent his Apostles to make us Christians, to make that
which he taught them a Rule of life and to fix it on the Church as on a Pillar,
that all might read it, that none should add to it, or take away from it. And
for this they are called a foundation, and we are said to be built upon them,
Jesus Christ being the head corner stone.

The three and Twentieth Meeting.
A.
I. 1 John 4. 1. Believe not every Spirit. Ou^ present Age has showed us many
who, tho very ignorant, yet are wise^ than their teachers, so Spiritual, that
they despise the Word of God which is the dictate ^^ the Spirit. If they
murder, the Spirit move^ their hand and drew their sword; if the throw down
Churches, it is with the breat^ of the Spirit: if they would bring in parit^
the pretense is, the Spirit cannot endure the any should be supreme. Our
humor, o^ madness, our malice, our violence, our implacable bitterness, our
railing and revilling, must all go for Inspirations of the Spirit.

II. 1 John 4. 2. Every Spirit, that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in
the flesh, is of God. i. e. Whosoever striveth to advance the kingdom of
Christ, and to set up the Spirit against the flesh; to magnify the Gospel, to
promote men in their ways of innocence and perfect obedience (which infallibly
lead to happiness) is from God. Every such Inspiration is from the Spirit of
God.

III. Matthew. 7. 20. By their Fruits ye shall know them. Their hypocrisy, as
well and cunningly wrought as it is, is but poor cobweb lawn, and we may easily
see through it: We may see these Spiritual men swearing and toiling for the
flesh, these spirits diging in the minerals, and making have to be rich. Sure I
am the Spirit of Truth looks upward, moves upward, directs upward to those
things which are above; and if we follow him, neither our doctrine nor our
actions will ever favor of this dung.

B.
I. 2. COr. 4. 3. If the truth be hid, it is hid to them that perish. If we
have eyes to see her, she is a fair object, as visible as the Sun. If we do but
love the truth, the Spirit of truth is ready to take us by the hand, and lead
us to it: but those that withdraw themselves does his Soul hate.

II. Prove. 2. 4. If thou seek her as Silver, etc. Truth is best bought when
it costeth us most: it must be Wooed often, and seriously, and with great
devotion. To Love seven years are but a few days, (Genesis 29.) great burdens are
but small, and labor is a pleasure. When we walk in the region of truth,
viewing it and delighting in it, gathering what may be for our use, we walk as
in a Paradise. Never did any rise up early, and in good earnest travel toward
it, but he was brought to his journeys end.

III. Ephesians. 1. 5. God dispenses all things according to the good pleasure of
his Will. And certainly he will not lead thee, if thou will not follow; he will
not teach thee, if thou will not learn: Nor can we think that the Truth will be
sown in every ground, and as Devils tares grow up in us whilst we sleep.

C.
I. Matthew. 6. 33. Seek ye first the Kingdom of God: And in that Kingdom every
thing in its order. There is something first, and something next to be
observed. We must keep a set Course in our studies and proceedings.

II. Heb. 6. 1. The Apostle tells us of principles of doctrine, which must be
learned before we can be led forward to perfection, of milk and of strong meat,
of plainer lessons, before we reach at higher mysteries. Most Christians are
perfect too soon, which is the reason why they are never perfect.

III. Heb. 11. 6. Without Faith it is impossible to please God. It is true: but
without justice and honesty Faith is but a name. For can we imagine that
Religion should turn Theif, and Devotion a Cutpurse?

The four and Twentieth Meeting
A.
I. MIch. 6. 6. Shall I come before him with burnt offerings? It Is in effect, I
must not do it. The question makes the denial more strong. That which is
Religion has so little relation to it, that it can subsist without it, and
most times has been swallowed up and lost in it. It was in the World, before
any Command came forth for sacrifice, and it is now most glorious when every
Altar is thrown drown, and has the sweetest savor now there is no other smoke.

II. Jer. 7. 22. I spoke not to your Fathers concerning burnt offerings. They
were before they were enjoined, and the Fathers offered them up out of a
voluntary affection to the honor of God, devoting that unto him, which was
with them of highest esteem. God did not Command, but did accept them for the
zeal and affection wherewith they were offered, being in themselves neither
good nor evil.

III. Gal. 4. 10. Joh. 4. 20. The Ceremonies were confined to time and Place.
You observe days and months, says the Apostle. Yea, and they observed places
too: Ye say that Jerusalem is the place, says the woman of Samaria to our
Savior. But that, which is truly good and in it self, is of that Nature that
Time and place has no power or influence on it. It is never out of season,
never out of place. Every day, every hour, every minute is the good man's
sabbath and rest. The Church is the place and the market is the place, and the
prison may be the place: nay Sodom it self. And it is the greatest Commendation
to be good among the worst.

B.
I. ISai. 1. 15. Will I be pleased with thousands of rams? i. e. I will not. We
may then learn thus much from the Prophets question, That the Ceremonious part
of Gods worship tho en^oyned by God and performed most exactly by men, yet if
is be not driven to that end, for which it was commanded, is so far from
finding acceptance with God that it is odious and hateful in his sight.

II. Isa. 64. 4. All our righteousness (he means formal and counterfeit
righteousness) is as a menstruous Cloth.

III. Matthew. 25. Come ye blessed, etc. The form or reason is not for you have
sacrificed, ye have fasted often, ye have heard much, etc. yet these are holy
duties, but they are ordinata in a liud, ordained for those that follow For I
was hungry, and ye gave, etc. Then the outward worship has its Glory and
reward, when it draws the inward along with it: when I sacrifiee and obey,
hear and do, pray and endeavor, contemplate and practice, fast and repent.

C.
I. JOh. 3. 5. Except ye be baptized, etc. It is not absolutely necessary to be
baptized, but it is necessary to cleanse our selves from sin. S. Augustine
thought, not to be baptized was to be damned: and therefore was forced to
create a new hell, and to find out mitem damnationem, more fit, as he thought,
for the tenderness of Infants.

II. Matthew. 12. 34. The moral man, that keeps the Commandments is not far
from the kingdom of God: and he that is a Christian, and builds up his
morality, and justice and mercy upon his Faith in Christ, shall enter in and
have a mansion there, when speculative and Seraphic Hypocrites shall be shut
out doors.

III. Luke 16. 25. Thou bast received thy good things, Says Abraham to Dives:
good things, but thine, such as thy lusts esteemed so: thy good things and such
good things, as have helped to hurry thee to this place of torment.

The five and Twentieth Meeting.
A.
I. Psalm. 24. 1. The World is the Lords (and the world is the Souls) and all
that therein is: And to behold the ^reature, and in the world, as in a book, to
study and find out the Creator, to contemplate his Majesty, his goodness, his
wisdom, and to discover that happiness which is prepared for it; this is the
proper act of the soul for which it was made, this, this alone was proportioned
to it.

II. 2 Timothy 1. 13. The form of Sound words, Erasmus (Praef ad Hieron.) will
tell us, that Religion was never more sincere and incorrupt, than when they
used but one Creed, and that a short one.

III. Isai. 13. 3. Let us not seek our peace in false and deceitful, but in
true and real goods, such as fill and satisfy: here let us let down our
pitchers, and draw Waters out of this well of Salvation; even those waters
which will sweeten our miseries, and give a pleasant taste to bitterness it self.

B.
I. Ephesians. 5. 14. Awake thou that sleep in Sloth and idleness; thou that
sleep in a tempest, in the midst of thy unruly and turbulent passions; arise
from thy grave and sepulcher wherein thy sloth has intombed thee, where so
many vicious habits have shut thee up. Christ shall give thee light, if not to
know the uncertain (yet certain) ways of Gods providence, yet to know the
certain and infallible way to bliss.

II. Psalm. 100. 3. It is he that has made us not we our selves: And he made us
to this end, to his glory, to be united to himsef, to bow under his power, to
be conformed to his will; and so to gain a title to that happiness, which is
ready to meet them that run unto it by doing what he requires at their hands.

III. Psalm. 139. 14. I am fearfully and wonderfully made, says David,
marvellously made, excellently made; set a part, selected from all the other
Creatures. My members were curiously wrought, drawn as with a needle (so the
word signifies) embroidered with all variety, as with diverse Colors, every
part fitted for its use.

C.
I. Romans 3. 13. He does not say, All must sin: but, All have sinned. For both
the Gentiles might have kept the Law of nature, and were punished because they
did not, as it is plain, Romans 1. and the Jews might have kept that law, which
was given to them as far as God required it. David, Asa, Josias, kept the Law,
so far as that God was pleased to accept it as a full payment. Augustine. It is
in our power to do what God requires (cum Dei adjutorio) by the help of Grace.

II. Matthew. 11. 30. My yoke is easy, says our Savior, and my burden is
light. For it is fitted to our necks and shoulders, and it is so far from
taking from our nature, or pressing it with violence, that it exalts and
perfecteth it. There is love and hope to sweeten them and make them easy and
pleasant.

III. 1 Cor. 2. 15. Wicked men, if an eye of flesh may judge, are the greatest
favorites of God: But the spiritual man judges all things; and to his eye they
are but a sad and ruful spectacle, as condemned men led with music to
execution.

The six and Twentieth Meeting.
A.
I. GAl. 6. 12. We are as so many looking glasses, which present the actions of
men in power back upon themselves, doing in all as they do, and all to gain our
peace, or, lest we should suffer persecution for the Cross of Christ. The
denial of our own will is not a thing of such difficulty as it is thought. We
may do that for Gods cause, which we do for our own.

II. Ephesians. 4. 25. Wherefore cast off lying, etc. The reason follows, For we are
members one of another. Thou art a part of him, and he is a part of thee, being
both hewn out of the same rock, formed and shaped of the same mold. Therefore
by lying to thy be other, thou put a cheat upon thy self; and as far as in
thee lies, upon that God that made you both, and gave you tongues not to ly
but to instruct, and wits not to decieve but counsel and help one another.

III. Matthew. 10. 3. Beware of men. A strange caution it is from him who so
loved men, that he dyed for them. Beware of men transformed and Brutified. That
smiling friend may be a tempter: he that calls himself a Saint may be a
seducer: his oily tongue may wound thee, and his embrace crush thee to pieces.

B.
I. Matthew. 7. 12. This is the Law and the Prophets. Upon this Law of Nature
depend the Law and the Prophets. Or, this is the sum of all which the Law and
the Prophets have taught, to wit, concerning justice and honesty, and those
mutual offices and duties of men to men.

II. Heb. 11. 1. Faith is the substance and expectation of a future and better
condition: but we do not use to expect a thing, and have no eye upon the means
of attaining it Can we expect to fly without wings, or go a journey without
feet? No more can we hope ever to enter those heavens wherein dwells
righteousness, without righteousness.

III. Mar. 7. 11. The Pharisees taught Children to say to their Eather and
Mother, Corban: which is not a Curse, as some have imagined, but their cra^t
and policy: to teach children, which were offended with their parents, to
consecrate their wealth to the Treasury, that so they might avoid that other
Law, which bound them to supply their parents in want and distress.

C.
I. Romans 13. 13. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; and not after those blind
Guides, the Love of our selves, and the glory of the World; which will lead us
on pleasantly for a while, and at last slip from us and leave us in the dark,
there to lament and curse the folly of our ways.

II. 1 John 2. 11. He that hates his brother walks in darkness: that he
cannot see a man in a man, nor a brother in a brother; a man in the same shape,
and built up of the same materials, a man of the same passions with himself.

III. Psalm. 19. 2. Day unto Day teaches knowledge: and every act of piety is
apt to promote and to produce a Second, to beget more light, which may yet lead
us further from truth to truth, till at last we be brought to that happy
estate, which has no shadow of falsehood.

The seven and Twentieth Meeting.
A.
I. 2 Timothy 3. 5. Having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof. As
virtes and other fruit trees bear the less fruit* ^hen they are suffered to
luxuriate and spend their sap upon superfluous sucker^ and abundance of leaves:
so commonly we may observe both in civil conversation where there is great
store of formality, there is little sincerity, and in Religion, where there is
a decay of true and cordial piety, there men entertain and please themselves
with external formalities and performances.

II. Joh. 14. 15. If ye Love me keep my commandments. This is not the office of
a friend to bewail a dead friend with vain lamenations: sed quae voluerit
meminisse, quae mandaverit exsequi: to remember what he desires and execute
what he cammands: so ^^id a dying Roman to his friend: And so says our Savior
to us, To love him is not to profess kindness, but to perform Obedience to ^im.

III. 1 John 3. 17. He that shuts up his bowels, etc. He that keeps from
any brother in Christ, that which his brother wants, and he wants not, does but
vainly think that he loves God, and therefore vainly hope that God loves him.

B.
I. Matthew. 18. 3. Except ye become as little Children. Christ requires of men
humility, like to that of little Children, and that under the highest pain of
damnation That is, that we should no more overvalue our selves, or desire to
be highly esteemed by others, no more under-value, scorn or despise others; no
more affect pre-eminence overs others, than little Children do, before we have
put that pride into them, which afterward we charge wholly upon their natural
Corruption.

II. Matthew. 3. 2. Repent for the Kingdom etc. Much better, because freer from
ambiguity, Amend your lives, (...). That repentance to which remission of sin^
and salvation is promised is perpetually expressed ^ the word (...), which
signifies a through change of the heart and soul, of the life an^ actions.

III. Duet. 23. 9. When thou go to w^ with thine enemies, then take heed
there be no wicked thing in thee: Not only no wickedness in the cause thou
maintainest, nor no wickedness in the means by which thou maintainest it, but
no personal impieties in the persons that maintain it; lest the goodness of
their cause sink under the burden of their sins.

C.
^ Luke 24. 47. That repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his
name. The condition of the new Covenant to which remission of sins is promised
is expressed by the word (...). Which if ye compare that in S. Matthew. 28.
teaching them to observe all, you see that what our Savior calls in one place
(...) Repentance, that in the other he calls observing all that he has
commanded: Which, if Repentance were no more but sorrow for sin, and intending
to leave it, certainly he neither could nor would have done.

II. Act. 20. 21. S. Paul profeiseth, that the whole matter of his preaching
was nothing else but Repentance toward God, and Faith in our Lord Jesus
Christ. It is manifest in his Epistles, he preaches and presses every where,
the necessity of Mortification, Regeneration, new and sincere Obedience, all
which are evidently not contained under the head of Faith: and therefore it is
evident he comprised all these under the head of Repentan^^.

III. Heb. 6. 1. We shall do much right to this place, and to that Act. 2^. and
make them more clear and intelligible, if instead of Repentance, we should put
conversion (as it is in some of the best Latin translations) and read
conversion from dead works, and conversion to God. You see, it is more
perspicuous and more natural.

The eight and Twentieth Meeting.
A
I. Matthew. 3. 9. Every tree that brings not forth good fruit, etc. It is not
then the leaves of a fair profession, no nor the blossoms of good purposes and
intentions, but the fruit, the fruit only, that can save us from the fire:
neither is it enough, not to bear ill fruit unless we bring forth good.

II. Matthew. 7. 26. Our Savior, after he had delivered his most divine precepts
in his Sermon on the mount (which Sermon contains the substance of the gospel)
closes up all with saying, He that hears these sayings of mine, and does
them not (and yet these were the hardest sayings that ever he said) I will
liken him to a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: that is, his
hope of salvation upon a sandy and false ground.

III. Gal. 5. 24. They that are Christ's have Crucified the flesh, etc. They
then that have not done so, not crucified the flesh with the affections and
lusts, let them be as sorrowful as they please, let them intend what they
please as yet are none of Christ's. And, Good Lord! What a multitude of
Christians then are in the World, that do not belong to Christ!

B.
I. 1 John 3. 3. He that has this hope purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
The meaning is not, with the same degree of purity, for that is impossible; but
with the same kind, the same truth of purity. He that does not purify himself
may, nay does flatter himself, and without warrant presume upon Gods favor;
but this hope he has not.

III. The fool has said in his heart, etc. i. e. Not so much persuades
himself in secret, that there is no God; but rather expresses so in his life,
or in his affections: being a person of the same mould that are described, Tit.
1. 16. They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, being
abominable and disobedient, and to every good work void of judgment, (...),
ignorant, imprudent, inconsiderate.

II. Luke 7. 12. When they have heard, then comes the devil, etc. The Devil
will give people leave freely to hear the word of God preached, to study it, to
dispute it, upon condition they resolve not to be the better for it in their
lives: He will suffer it to swim in the brain, so that he may stop the passages
to the heart: It troubles him not, to have the precious seed of the word
entertained by a man, so that it may be kept in granaries, and not multiply in
to a fruitful harvest.

C.
I. 1 COr. 13. 4, etc. Here you may behold almost all the Virtues that can be
named, enwrapped in one Virtue of Charity; and Love, according to the several
acts thereof changed and transformed into so many several graces. It suffers
long, and so it is Longanimity: It is kind, and so it is Courtesy: It vaunteth
not it self, and so it is Modesty: It is not puffed up, and so it is Humility: It
is not easi^y provokt, and so it is Lenity: It thinks no evil, and so it is
Simplicity: It rejoices in the truth, and so it is Verity: It bears all
things, and so it is Fortitude: It believes all things, and so it is Faith: It
hops all things, and so it is Confidence. It endures all things, and so it is
Patience: It never fails, and so it is Perseverance.

II. Joh. 9. 34. -- that they which see might be made blind. Not as if Christ
did imprint or inflict blindness upon any man, but only occasionally: i. e.
those which walk in darkness, and love it; when the light comes upon them, and
discovers their wandering, they hate it and turn their eyes from it, and become
perversely and obstinately blind. In the same sense that S. Paul says, Romans 7.
Sin taking occasion by the Law becomes more sinsul: whilst sin is not opposed,
it goes on in its course quietly, but when the Commandment comes, and
discovers, and rebukes it, it becomes furious and much more raging and violent.

III. Luke 14. 26. He that hates not father and mother, etc. This speech does
not bind me to hate, persecute, and destroy all the kindred I have; no, but
rather to love and honor them: yet if those persons, or if it be possible for
ought else to be more dear and precious than they, stand in my way to hinder me
from coming to Christ, I must trample them under my feet. And a man is no more
bound to sell his goods i. e. to throw them away and renounce them, than to
hate his Parents. Only, neither of them may by any means offend us or weary us
in our journey to Christ.

The nine and Twentieth Meeting.
A.
I. JAM. ^. 19. The Devils believe and tremble. They do assent unto the truth
of all the mysteries of our salvation: But these things are to them occasion of
horror that there should be such glorious things which do nothing concern
them, and of malice to those who have an interest therein.

II. Heb 11. 1. Our Faith is the substance of things hoped for. Of things which
concern us: we do not only acknowledge that the precepts of God are good, but
also necessary to be performed by us; and that the promises of God are not only
desirable in themselves, but also that being such, they are destined to us,
when we shall have performed such conditions, as may by the assistance of God
be executed by us, even with ease and pleasure. Where th^se persuasions are,
there will accompany them earnest and serious endeavors.

III. Psalm. 60. 16. What art thou that take my word, etc. And if that be so
great a crime for a man only to talk of God, to make mention of his Name, when
the heart is unclean and unreformed; with how much greater reason may Christ
say, what art thou that take Me into thy mouth, and dare come to the
Heavenly feast with spotted and unclean affections.

B.
1. ROm 8. 18. The Apostle, who had been traduced, revi^'d, buffeted, scourged,
imprisoned, shipwrack'd, and stoned, for his zeal to propagate the Gospel;
after he had once had a glimse of that great Recompense of reward that is
reserved for us in heaven, scruples not to pronounce, that he finds upon
casting up the account (for he uses the Arithmetical term (...)) that the
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory
that is to be revealed in us.

II. 1 Kings 3. 5, Solomon had an opportunity of satisfying his desires,
whether of Fame or any other thing that he could wish: Ask what I shall give
thee, was the proffer made him by him that could give all things worth
receiving; and yet his Choice approved by God himself, consisted indeclining
the most ambition'd things of this life, for those things that might the better
qualify him to serve and please God.

II. Heb. 12. 2. He, who by leaving heaven, did, to dwell on earth, quit more
than any Inhabitant of the Earth can to gain heaven; and denied more to become
capable of being tempted, than he did when he was tempted with an offer of all
the Kingdoms of the World and the glory of them; This Savior of ours, is said
to have, for the joy that was set before him, endured the Cross and despised
the shame; as if Heaven had been a sufficient Recompense for even his
renouncing honors and embracing torments.

C.
I. Romans 2. 7. That immarcescible Crown, (as S. Peter calls it) which the
Gospel promises to them, who by patient continuance in well doing seek for
glory and honor, will make a rich amends for a fading wreath here upon Earth,
where Reputation is often times as undeservedly acquired as lost: whereas in
Heaven the very having celestial honors argues a Title to them.

II. Math. 5. 12. Since it is our Savior's reasoning, that his Disciples ought
to rejoice when their Reputation is pursued by Calumny as well as their lives
by persecution, because their Reward is great in heaven; we may justly infer;
That the grounded Expectation of so illustrious a Condition may bring us more
content, even when it is not attended with a present applause, than this applause
can give those who want that Comfortable Expectation.

III. 2 Chronicles. 25. 9. In all deliberations wherein any thing is proposed to be
quitted or declined, to obey or please God, we may fitly apply that brisk but
rational Answer of the Prophet to the Jewish King: The Lord is able to give
thee far more than this.

The Thirtieth Meeting.
A.
I. AMos. 6. 5. David became no less Skilful in music, than chose that were
addicted to it only to please themselves in it: tho we may reasonably suppose
that so pious an Author of Psalms and Instruments aspired to an excellency in
that delightful science, that he might apply and prefer it to the service of
the Temple, and promote the celebration of God's praises with it.

II. Genesis 27. 3. Tho Esau did at length miss of his aim, yet while he was
hunting Venison for the good Patriarch that desired it of him, besides the
pleasure he was used to take in pursuing the Deer he chased, he took a great
one in considering that now he hunted to please his Father, and in order to
obtain of him an inestimable Blessing.

III. Genesis 2. 20. They say, Adams knowledge before the fall was such, that he
was able at first sight of them to give each of the beasts a name expressive of
its nature. But I could never find, that the Hebrew names of Animals mentioned
in the beginning of Genesis, argued a much clearer in sight into their natures
than did the the names of the same or some other Animals in Greek or other
languages.

B.
I. Psalm. 145. 3. The Scripture says of God that his greatness is
incomprehensible, and his wisdom is inscrutable, etc. And the heathen
Philosopher, who wrote that eloquent book de Mundo speaks of the power, and
wisdom, and amiableness of God, in terms l^^tle less lofty, tho necessarily
inferior to so in^^ni^^ely sublime an Object. Which they that think they can,
especially without Revelation, sufficienly understand, do very little
understand themselves.

II. Romans 1. 19. I readily confess, being waranted by an Apostle, that the
(...) was not unknown to the heathen Philosophers; and that so much knowledge
o^ God is attainable by the light of Nature duly employed, as to encourage men
to exercise themselves, more than most of them do in that noblest of studies.

III. Job. 1. 8. When God himself is pleased to give Elogiums to Job, David,
Daniel, etc. whilst they were a live, and to others after they were dead, and
were passed to an irreversible state, we may learn with comfort, both that the
performance of such an Obedience as God will accept, is a thing really
practicable by men: and that even great sins and misdemeanors are not (if
seasonably repented of) certain evidences, that a man shall never be happy in
the future life. And it seems to be for such an use of Consolation to frail men
(but not at all to encourage licentious ones) that the lapses of holy persons
are so frequently recorded in the Scriptures.

C.
I. REvel. 7. 9. I saw in heaven a great multitude, not to be numbered, of all
nations. Ergo, Hence we may learn, that heaven is not reserved only for
Prophe's, and Apostles, and Martyrs, and such extraordinary persons (whose
sanctity the Church admires) but that through Gods goodness multitudes of his
more imperfect servants have access thither. A great and well grounded
Consolation to a considering Christian, who has due apprehensions of the
inexpressible happiness or misery of an immortal state.

II. Joh. 3. 2. As Aristotle teaches, that the Soul does after a sort become
that which it speculates: S. John assures us, that God, is a transforming
Object, and that in heaven we shall be like him, for (or because) we shall see
him as he is.

III. Psalm. 18. 1. I will love thee, O Lord my strength, etc. He that discerns
God's power and Goodness will be more disposed than others, to admire him, to
love him, to trust, and so to resign up himself to be governed by him. Which
frame of mind, both is it self a great part of the worship of God, and does
directly tend to the production and increase of those Virtues, without the
practice of which, the Scripture plainly tells us, that we can neither obey
God, nor express our Love to him.

The one and Thi^tieth Meeting.
A.
I. HEb. 1. 14. Tho the Angels are wont to appear in a dazzling splendour, yet
are they all of them ministering Spirits, employed for the good of the designed
beirs of Salvation. And they do not only refuse men's adoration, but style
themselves, follow servants to the Lord's disciples.

II. 2 Pet. 2. 4. Jude. 6. The Apostate Angels are so far from being able to
confer that happiness, which their worshippers expect from them, that
themselves are wretched Creatures, reserved in chains of darkness to the
Judgment of the great day. At which they shall be doomed to suffer everlasting
torments, in the company of those wicked men that they shall have prevailed on.

III. Jam. 3. 6. 1 Pet. 3. 7. Theology teaches us expressly from divine
Revelation, that the present Course of Nature shall not last always; but that
one day this World (or at least this Vortex of ours) shall either be abolished
by An^ihilation or, (which seems far more probable) be innovated, and as it
were transfigur'd; and that by the intervention of that fire, which shall
dissolve and destroy the present frame of Nature. So that, either way the
present state of things, as well natural as political, shall have an end.

B.
I. Act 24. 15. As the Scripture teaches us, how the body of man had its first
beginning; so it likewise assures us, what shall become of the body after
death; the bare natural Reason will scarce be pretended to reach to so abstruse
and difficult an Article as that of a Resurrection: which, when proposed by S.
Paul, produced among the Athenian Philosophers nothing else but wonder or
laughter. Act, 17. 20, 32.

II. Joh. 5. 39. Few make it their business to search the Scriptures for those
things (such as are unheeded Prophefies, oversook'd mysteries and strange
harmonies) which being clearly and judiciously proposed may make that Book
appear more worthy of the high extraction it challenges, and consequently of
the Veneration of considering men.

III. Isai. 5. 4. What could I have done, etc. In the production of the
material World, and the setting the frame of Nature, God employed not only
laws and commands, but revelations, miracles, promises, threats, exhortations,
mercies, judgments, and diverse other methods and means.

C.
I. JOb. 38. 5, 6. It Is the probable Opinion of D^vines, that the Angels were
created before the material World, as being meant by those Sons of God and
morning stars, that with glad Songs and acclamations celebrated the foundations
of the earth.

II. Psalm. 57, 23. How pleasing men's hearty praises are to God, may appear by
that Royal Prophet, whom God was pleased to declare a man after his own heart:
for he introduces God pronouncing, Who so offers praise glorifieth me: Where
the Word our Interpreters render offers, in the Hebrew signifies to
sacrifice. With which agrees, that elsewhere those that pay God their Praises,
are said to sacrifice to him the calves of their lips. Hos. 14. 2.

III. Psalms. That excellent person to whom God vouchsased so particular a
testimony, was so assiduous in this excrcise, that the Book which we, following
the Greek, call Psalms, is in the Original, from the things it most abounds
with, called Sepher Tehillim. i. e. The Book of Praises.

The two and Thirtieth Meeting.
A.
I. LEvit. 25. 23. The land is mine, and ye are sojourners. God granted the use
of it to them; yet kept still the right and full disposal of it to himself: For
the Lord calls them for all this grant, but sojourners and strangers: who held
what they possessed, under God, and continued in it no longer than he gave them
leave, from whom he might take it away, and bestow it on whom he pleased.

II. Psalm. 19. 12. Cleanse me from my secret sins: Sins which fly our sight,
that steal from us in crowds or borrowed shapes, so slily as man (who is the
most absurd flatterer of himself) cannot discern them: as pride in decency,
malice in zeal, hypocrisy in devotion, boasting in charity, covetousness and
extortion under the name of providing for our families.

III. 1 King. 15. 5. David is said to have done all things well, excepting the
matter of Vriah: not that he could indeed clear himself from all guilt: for
whosoever marks his story, will find many foul actions, besides this of Vriah:
but because he did not lie dead in any tin but this, for he had a child before
ever he thought he had committed adultery.

B.
I. JEr. 12. 1. why do the wicked prosper. The Objection supposes a false
thing. We think them in a better condition then they are. For wicked men did
never prosper in the world, unless you will call it happiness for a man to
assure God's wrath upon himself, and to have a liberty to improve his sins, and
increase his damnation.

II. Psalm. 37. 1. Envy thou not the ungodly. Alas, we should rather pity and
pray for them, as much as if we saw them, like the Lunaticks in the Gospel,
cutting and tearing their own flesh. For the Lord is not slack, he is but
whetting his sword, putting on his armor and then will go out with a shout,
and all the world shall say, Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous.

III. Psalm. 42. 14. Why art thou so troubled, O mysoul! For the Devil himself
cannot so much as stir without Gods leave, as appears by many examples in Job
and the Gospel too; and wicked men are but Gods instruments, his hammer and his
hatchet, as the Prophet Isaiah calls them, with which he cuts, carves, polishes
and works our hearts, which otherwise would remain rude stone for ever.

C.
I. Matthew. 16. 24. Whosoever will come after me, etc. Our Lord and Master
requires this principle of his disciples, as a necessary qualification; To
resolve before hand thus much, never to regard any thing hereafter besides him,
to strip our selves of all earthly considerations whatsoever; to go continually
with our lives and fortunes in our hands, ready in an instant to lay them down,
as soon as ever the Lord has need of them. So as none must dare to follow
Christ without his Cross.

II. Phil. 4. 11. I have learned in what state soever I am, etc. This is the
knowledge which makes us Wise, Rich, Free, Happy, every thing; supplies all our
wants, and sets us above danger; to have learnt quietly to submit our selves to
God in all the variety of dispensations, to be content ((...)) to be
selfsufficient, to have provision within our selves against all accidents.

III. Phil. 4. 1. S. Paul calls these Philippians whom he had instructed with
good success his joy and his Crown. For if there be degrees of bliss hereafter,
as our Savior, as well as the Prophets seems to imply, we may not doubt, but,
he who converts a Soul to God as he is said to increase the joys of heaven by
doing it, so certainly he shall partake more of them and shine as a star for
ever and ever, Dan. 12. 3.

The three and Thirtieth Meeting.
A.
I. 1 COr. 9. The Apostle proves the Ministers right by all kind of Arguments,
from Custom, Reason, and Scripture, and lest you should pretend the abrogation
of this Law by Christ, he adds v. 14. that the Lord has ordained, That they
who preached the Gospel should live of the Gospel. He has ordained, enacted
it, and made it a Law for ever: it is not left to your choice and discretion.
And our Savior, when he sends out his Apostles, call, their maintenance their
hire, Man. 10. As if there did pass a tacit contract and bargain between the
preacher and the Audience, that as he feeds their Souls, they should feed his
Body.

II. Romans 13. 8. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. A most
excellent speech, and means thus: as if he said, you may pay your bills at a
shop, and be out of the Trades-mans debt; you may lay down your money, and take
up your bonds, you may really satisfy all other engagements, but this debt of
Charity never: This you must always be paying, yet never think it satisfied.

III. Gal. 3. 3. Have ye begun in the Spirit and are ye now made perfect in the
flesh? Will ye fall back from the Spirit, which teaches true and solid piety,
to a carnal and outward worship of God, to the Ceremonies of the Law? Christ
and Moses, the Gospel and the Law cannot consist together; To seek for
justification by the Law is quite to shut out Christ, whose peculiar office it
is to justify and save us.

B.
I. ISai. 14. 12. How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer! How art thou
fallen from being a Minister of light to be a Prince of darkness, from being so
filled with the Grace of the Divinity, to be a foul receptacle of malice? from
waiting on God in all his Majesty, to be thrust down into the foulest pit,
there to be his Executioner? And how art thou fallen O man, whosoever thou be
that hate thy brother, from heaven (for in earth there is no other heaven
than what love makes) to hell it self, malice and envy?

II. Gal. 4. 12. Brethren I beseech you. As we are Brethren by nature, soar we
by Grace and our celestial calling. and major fraternitas, Christi quam
sanguinis: The brotherhood we have by Christ is a greater and nearer tie than
that we have by blood or nature. Justin Martyr and Optatus have been so far
charitable as to call Judaizing Christians and Donatists by the name of
brethren.

III. Gal. 6. 1. He who considers, that himself also may be tempted, will use
the Spirit of meekness toward an erring brother. Great is the difficulty of
finding out truth in all things, and of avoiding error. This consideration
made S. Austin so compassionate and mild even toward the worst of Heretics
the Manichees, and to think that none could be enraged against them, but those
who thought it an easy matter to screne the mind against carnal pleasures, and
who knew not how hard a thing it is for the eye of the inward man through so
many mists of Objections to look upon the Sun.

C.
I. Mark 9. 50. Have salt in your selves. No text of Scripture in its
exposition can retain the sense and meaning of the blessed Spirit which does
not edify in charity. For that doctrine cannot be of any use in the Church,
which exasperates one man against another. And this moderation, this discretion
is that salt which Christ requires to be in us, that wise seasoning of our
words, that purging of our affections, among which ambition and envy are the
most violent: Have this salt in your selves, and then you shall have peace one
with another.

II. 2. These. 3. 14. If any man obey not our word, i. e. be refractory to the
Gospel of Christ; have no company with that man, that he may be ashamed: that
seeing others avoid him, he may be forced to have recourse unto himself, to
hold colloquy with his own Soul, to find out that plague of his heart, which
makes him like that leper under the Law, which no man must come near. Have no
company with him: i e. by thy company give him no encouragement in his sin. And
yet for all this, Have company with him: for Count him not as an enemy, but
admonish him as a brother: Which we cannot do, if we avoid his company.

III. 1 Cor. 5. 10. In this sense also we must take that of the Apostle where
he forbids to eat witb public and notorious offenders. For the Apostles mind
was not that such men were to be given over for gone, or that we should
acquaint our selves only with the good, and not with the bad. For our Savior
Christ familiarly conversed, eat and drank with publicans and sinners, and
gives the reason of it: Because he came to call, not the the righteous, but
sinners to repentance.: and we cannot think that S. Paul is contrary to Christ.

The four and Thirtieth Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew. 7. 7. Search and ye shall find: not every particular Truth; for
experience teaches us that cannot be the interpretation: but whether you find
or no the Truth which you search for, you shall find the reward of Searching,
which is happiness,

II. 1 Cor. 2. 14. The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit, etc.
I conceive it ought to be rendered, the sensual man: for such is (...) in the
Greek, and animalis in the Latin; (...) many times signifying the lower, and
sensitive part of the soul, in distinction to (...) which is the upper or
rational. So, the meanning is: That whilst a man's reason is seduced by his
appetites and passions, it is an unfit judge of spiritual matters; neither can
be Umpire for a peace, having joined it self to the party of those things which
are in perpetual war far against the Spirit.

III. ^. Cor. 10. 5. Casting down reasonings, etc. S. Paul relates in
vindication of his own just greatness against the calumnies of some that
despised his person (especially as weak and rude of speech) how he had confuted
those persons that opposed themselves by reasonings against the doctrine of
Christ. And whereas their understandings before were enslaved and captivated to
the desires of the sensual soul, which hindered them from the obedience of
Christ, he freed them from their cruel bondage, by casting down all their
strong holds, and brought them into another captivity by right of conquest, but
such a one, where the yokes are light and the burdens easy, i. e. by true
reason he overcame and captivated their false ones.

B.
I. 1 COr. 5. 11. With such a one no not to eat. By eating with him is
understood familiar society in diet or lodggin. For in case I come to an
ordinary or Inn to eat and see at the Table an excommunicate person sitting
whom I have no power to exclude, what can hinder me from dining with him?

II. Cor. 11. 28. Let a man examine himself. And yet perfect Faith ^r
Repentance is not required; as some by too much urging perfection, which is no
where found, shut out almost all for ever from the Communion. God accepts of a
weak Faith, if it be sincere.

III. 1 Cor. 13. 7. Chari^y bears all things, believes all things. He
requires here simplicity and humanity in judging, these being the perpetual
companions of Charity; whereby a Christian thinks it better to be deceived
through his benignity and facility, than by a sinister suspicion to grieve his
brother.

C.
I. 1 COr. 12. 8. S. Paul reckons Wisdom and knowledge in the first rank of
the gifts of God, and if he any where seem to reflect severely upon wisdom or
humane learning, he only censures the Abuse, never intending to blame the
thing it self.

II. 1 Cor. 11. 22. What, have you not houses to eat and drink in; or despise
ye the Church of God? Where that by Church is not meant the Assembly meeting,
but the place in which they used to assemble, is evident, partly from what went
before; for their coming together in the Church is expounded by their coming
together into one place; partly from the opposition which he makes between the
Church and their own private houses; in this verse. If they must have such
irregular banquets, they had houses of their own much fitter for it, and for
their ordinary repast, than that place set a part for the common exercises of
Religion.

III. 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2. The Apostle giving directions to the Church of Corinth
(as he had done in the like case to other Churches concerning their
contributions to the poor suffering brethren, he bids them lay aside upon the
first day of the weak: which seems plain^y to respect their Religious
Assemblies upon that day; for then it was that every one according to his
ability deposited someting for the relief of the poor, and the uses of the
Church.

The five and Thirtieth Meeting.
A.
I. REv. 1. 18. On the Lords day. This was the more proper and prevalent name
of the first day week, that day whereon our Lord made his triumphant return
from the dead. This Justin Martyr assures us (Apol. 2.) was the true Original
of the Title, upon Sundays (says he) we all assemble and meet together, etc.
He and Terlullian call it Sunday; and it seldom passes under any other name in
the imperial Edicts of the first Christian Emperors. The Primitive Christians
looked upon this day as a time to be celebrated with great expression of joy,
and accordingly restrained whatever might savor of sorrow and sadness: A day
of rest, that men might have nothing to do but to worship God, and be better
instructed in the Christian Faith.

II. Gal. 4. 15. S. Paul bears record to the Galatians, that he was accounted
so dear to them, that if the plucking out their eyes would have done him any
good, they were ready to have done it for his sake. And the ancient Christians
carried themselves toward their Bishops and Ministers, with all that kindness
and veneration which they were capable to express toward them. S. Clement
testifies of the Corinthians, that they walked in the Laws of God, being
subject to them that had the rule over them, yielding due honor to their
spiritual guides.

III. Col. 3. 16. In the ancient times, even the most rude and illiterate
persons, instead of profane wanton songs, which vitiate and corrupt the minds
of men ((...) Chrysostom calls them) Songs of the devils composure, used
nothing but spiritual and divine Hymns, so that (as Hierome relates of the
place where he lived) you could not go into the field, but you might hear the
Plowman at his Hallelujahs, the Mower at his hymns, and the Vinedresser
singing David's Psalms.

B.
I. 1 COr. 11. The Lords supper. The Eucharist which S. Paul speaks of in the
Church of Corinth was solemnized in the morning, the Apostle calling it a
supper (as Chrysostom thinks) not because 'twas in the evening, but the more
effectually to put them in mind of the time when our Lord did institute those
holy mysteries.

II. 1 Timothy 5. 10. S. Paul expressly requires it as a qualification in a Widow,
that was to be taken in as a Deaconess into the Church, that she be one that
has used to lodge strangers, and to wash the Saints feet. Tertullian assures
us, 'twas usually done by Christians in his time, to go into the prisons to
kiss and embrace the Martyrs chains, to harbor and provide for indigent
brethren, and to bring water to wash, the Saints feet. No office so low, which
they were not content to stoop to.

III. Matthew. 16. 24. Let him deny himself. Nazianzen tells us (Orat. 1.) that
of those excellencies and endowments which God had given him, health, wealth,
esteem, and eloquenc^, he reaped this only benefit, that he had something
which he could contemn, and by which he could show that he infinitely valued
Christ before them.

C.
I. 2 These. 2. 2, 3. This did mightily contribute to the weaning of the first
Christians from the World, and did strongly animate them to a quick and speedy
diligence about the affairs of the other life; namely, an opinion they
generally had of the day of Judgment being near at hand: An opinion started
early, as appears by that Caution which St. Paul gives the Thessalonians about
it.

II. 1 Pet. 3. 3. The Apostles require of women, not the outward adorning of
gold and fine apparel, but shamfac'tness and so briety, the hidden ornament of
the heart, That tho they were rich, yet they were to consult the honor and
modesty of their profession, and might not go to the utmost bounds of what was
lawful; some things being lawful which were not expedient; especially when by
their wanton and lascivious dress they might be a means to kindle in the
breasts of others the flames of an unchaste and unlawful passion, and so prove
the occasion of their ruin.

III. Romans 13. ult. The Law of Christ commands us to fast often, to keep under
the body, and to make no provision for the flesh. If nature regularly governed
be content with little, Religion will teach us to be content with less.

The six and Thirtieth Meeting.
A
I. JAm. 2. 21. Ahraham is said to have been justified hy Faith, when he
offered his Son Isaac upon the Altar: tho he did not actually sacrifice him:
because he endeavored to do so, God graciously accepting the will for the
deed, accepted also of the blood of a Lamb instead of Isaac's.

II. 1 Timothy 3. 16. The Gospel is styled, The mystery of Godliness: and S* Paul
else where calls what it teaches, The truth which is according to godliness,
Tit. 1. 2. i. e. a doctrine framed and fitted to promote the interest of Piety
and Virtue in the World. This Character belongs to the more retired truths
discoverd by speculation, as well as to those more obvious ones, that are
familiarly taught in Catechisms.

III. Ex. 15. 25. The inward gratulations of Conscience, for having done our
duties, is able to guild the bitterest pills, and like the wood that grew by
the Waters of Marah, to correct and sweeten that liquor, which before was the
most distasteful.

B.
I. MAth. 5. 29. Though to deny some lusts be, in our Saviors esteem, no less
uneasy than for a man to pluck out his right eye, or cut off his right hand;
yet even Maids have with satisfaction chosen, not only to deny themselves the
greatest pleasures of the sense, but to sacrifice the seat of them, the body
itself, to preserve the satisfaction of being chaste

II. 1 Pet. 112. The Gospel mysteries are of so noble and excellent a nature,
The Angels themelves desire to look into them. And it was the earnest desire of
a great King and no less a Prophet, that his eyes might behold the wondrous
things of God's Law, Psalm. 119, 18.

III. Matthew. 11. 15. It Is not only those Truths that make Articles of the
Creed, but diverse other doctrines of the Gospel that Christ himself judged
worthy to be concluded with this epiphonema: He that has ears to hear, let him
hear. On which the excel^ent Grotius makes this just paraphrase: Intellectus
nobis a Deo potissimum datus est, ut eum intendamus documentis ad pietatem
tendentibus.

C.
I. HEb. 5. 9. The Creed proposes the credenda, not the agenda of Religion:
whereas the Scriptures were designed, not only to teach us what Truths we are
to believe, but by what rules we are to live; the obedience to the Laws of
Christianity being as necessary to Salvation, as the belief of its mysteries.

II. Col. 3. 16. Whether or no those words of our Savior to the Jews, (...),
be to be rendered in the imperative, or indicative mood; S. Paul would have the
word of Christ to dwell richly in us, thereby teaching us, that besides the
things which are absolutely necessary there are several Truths that are highly
useful, to make us more clearly understand, and more rationally and firmly
believe, and more steadily practice the points that are necessary.

III. 1 Timothy 2. 4. Through the great goodness of God, who is willing to have
all men saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, necessary to salvation,
there are much fewer Articles absolutely necessary to be by all men distinctly
believed, then may be met with in diverse long Confessions of Faith: some of
which have, I fear, less promoted Knowledge than impaired Charity.

The seven and Thirtieth Meeting.
A.
I. 1 COr. 13. 9. Now we know in part, etc. Doubtless, tho Heaven abound with
inexpressible Joys, yet it will be none of the least, that shall make up the
Happiness even of that place, that the knowledge of divine things, that was here
so zealously pursued, shall there be completely attained

II. Matthew. 5. 8. The contentment afforded by the assiduous discovery of God
and divine mysteries, has so much of affinity with the pleasures that shall
make up men's Blessedness in heaven it self, that they seem rather to differ in
degree than in kind. For our Savior, to express the celestial joys, reserved
for those who for their sake denied themselves sensual pleasures, makes them to
consist in the Vision of God: Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God.

III. Matthew. 23. No less than eight woes are denounced against the Scribes and
Pharisees by our Savior himself (who is not very forward to destroy, he came
upon a far other business) and all those woes for their folly and blindness. In
the denouncing of every woe but one, he styles them hypocrites. And an
hypocrite is the veriest fool in the world, for he thinks to cousin and put a
cheat upon God, whom yet himself confesses to be omniscient, knowing all
things. In that single woe, he calls them blind guides, elsewhere fools and
blind. This was our Saviors judgment of them, and you may rest upon it.

B.
I. Matthew. 12. 36. Our blessed Savior told us, that we must a^count for every
idle word: not meaning, that every word which is not designed to edification,
or is less prudent, shall be reckoned for a sin; but that the time, which we
spend in our idle talking and unprofitable discoursings, that time which might
and ought to have been employed to spiritual and useful purposes, that is to be
accounted for.

II. Ezekiel. 16. 49. Idleness is called the sin of Sodom and her daughters, and
indeed is the burial of a living man; an idle person being so useless to any
purposes of God and man, that he is like one that is dead, unconcerned in the
changes and necessities of the world: and he only lives to spend his time, and
eat the fruits of the earth.

III. Jer. 48. 10. Do not the work of God negligently and idly: Let not thy
heart be upon the World, when thy hand is lift up in prayer and be sure to
prefer an action of religion in its place and proper season before all worldly
pleasure. In honoring God and doing his work put forth all thy strength, for
of that time only thou may be most confident that it is gained, which is
prudently and zealously spent in God's service.

C.
I. Ephesians. 5. 16. Be sure by a timely deligence to redeem the time, i. e. to be
pious and religious in such instances in which formerly you have sinned; and to
bestow your time especially upon such graces, the contrary whereof you have
formerly practiced; and then by all arts to watch against your present and
future dangers, from day to day securing your standing. This is properly to
redeem your time, i. e. to buy your security of it at the rate of any labor
and honest arts.

II. 1 Cor. 7. 5. Let him that is most busied set a part some solemn time every
year, in which, for the time quitting his worldly business, he may attend
wholly to fasting and praying, and the dressing of his soul by confessions,
meditations, and attendances upon God; that he may make up his accounts and
renew his vows.

III. 1 Cor. 10. 21. That we should intend and design Gods glory in every
action we do, whether it be natural or chosen, is expressed by S. Paul: Whether
ye eat or drink do all to the glory of God. Which rule when we observe, every
action of nature becomes religious, and every meal is an act of worship, and
shall have its reward in its proportion, as well as an act of prayer.

The eight and Thirtieth Meeting.
A.
I. Luke 1. 18. Whereby shall I know this? Zacharias questioned with the Angel
about his message, and was made speechless for his incredulity; but the blessed
Virgin questioned too and was blameless: for she did it to enquire after the
manner of the thing, but he did not belielieve the thing it self: he doubted of
Gods power, or the truth of the messenger, but she only of her own incapacity.

II. Matthew. 10. 42. The poor Farmer that gave a dish of cold water to
Artaxerxes was rewarded with a golden goblet; and he that gives the same to a
Disciple in the name of a disciplo shall have a Crown.

III. Psalm. 115. 1. Let every action of concernment be begun with prayer, and
Sanctify your purpose, and in the prosecution of it renew and reinkindle your
purpose by short ejaculations, as this: Not unto us, O Lord, etc. For then be
sure, as the glory is his, so the reward shall be thine.

B.
I. 1 Samuel 1. 8. What Helkanah said to the mother of Samuel, Am I not better to
thee than ten sons? is most certainly verified concerning God, that he who is
to be our judge is better than ten thousand witnesses. And indeed that man has
a strange covetousness, or folly, that is not contented with this reward, that
he has pleased God.

II. Matthew. 6. 2. When thou do alms, etc. Good actions degenerate without
purity of intention. Thus alms are for charity, fasting for temperance, prayer
for Religion, humiliation is for humility, austerity or sufferance is in order
to the Virtue of patience. And when these actions fail of their several ends,
or are not directed to their own purposes, alms are misspent, fasting is an
impertinent trouble, prayer is but lip-labor, humiliation is but hypocrisy,
sufferance is but vexation.

III. Matthew. 6. 22. When there is both truth in election and Charity in the
intention, when we go to God in ways of his own choosing or approving, then our
eye is single, and our hands are clean, and our hearts are pure.

C.
I. JEr. 23. 24. That God is present in all places, that he sees every action,
hears all discourses, and understands every thought, we are taught not only by
right reason, and the consent of all the wise men in the world, but also by God
himself in holy Scripture, Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall
not see him, says the Lord, etc. All things are naked and open to his eyes,
Heb. 4. 13.

II. Matthew. 6. 9. Which art in heaven. God is more specially present in some
places by the several and more special manifestations of hmself. Thus his seat
is in heaven, because there he sits encircled with all the outward
demonstrations of his glory, which he is pleased to show to all the inhabitants
of those his inward and secret Courts.

III. Matthew. 18. 20. Where two or three are gathered together, etc. God is by
Grace and benediction specially present in the assemblies of his servants. God
will go out of his way to meet his Saints, when themselves are forced out of
their way of order by a sad necessity: but else, Gods usual way is to be
present in those places where his servants are appointed ordinarily to meet and
by public authority. But his presence there signifies nothing but a readiness
to hear their prayers, to bless their persons, to accept their offices, and to
like even this circumstance of orderly and public Meeting.

The nine and Thirtieth Meeting.
A.
I. 1 COr. 3. 16. The spirit of God dwells in you. God is especially ^resent
in the hearts of his people by his holy Spirit. For God reigns in the hearts of
his servants; there is his Kingdom: The power of grace has subdued all his
enemies; there is his power: They serve him day and night, and give him thanks
and praise: That is his glory.

II. Psalm. 139. 6. Whither shall I flee from thy presence. This thought by
being frequent will make an habitual dread and reverence toward God, and fear
in all thy actions. For it is a great necessity and engagement to do
unblamably, when we act before the judge, who is infallible in his sentence,
and intolerable in his wrath and indignation.

III. Psalmist Seven times a day do I praise thee, and in the night, etc. In
your retirement make frequent colloquies or short discoursings between God and
thy own soul, so did David. And this is called a building to God a chapel in
our hearts. Thus in the midst of your works you retire into your Chapel, and
converse with God by frequent address and returns.

B.
I. 1 COr. 9. 25. The life of a Christian is a perpetual exercise* a wrestling
and warfare; to which sensual pleasure disables him, by yielding to that enemy
with whom he must strive, if ever he will be crowned. And this argument the
Apostle intimated He that striveth for masteries is temperate in all things,
etc.

I^. Revel. 2. 17. In the same degree in which we relish and are in love with
spiritual delights, the hidden Manna, with the sweetnesses of devotion, with
the joys of thanksgiving, with rejoycings in the Lord, with the comforts of
hope, with the deliciousness of Charity and alms deeds, with the sweetness of a
good conscience, with the peace of meekness, and the felicities of a contented
spirit; in the same degree we disrelish and loath the husks of swinish lusts,
and the parings of the apples of Sodom, and the taste of sinful pleasures.

III. 1 Cor. 10. 25. Whatsoever is set before you eat. If it be provided for
you, you may eat it, be it never so delicate, and be it plain and common, so it
be wholesome and fit for you, it must not be refused upon curiosity: for every
degree of that is a degree of intemperance.

C.
I. Luke 21. 34. Take heed to your selves lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged, etc. Christ forbids both the actual and the habitual intemperance;
not only the effect of it, but the affection to it: for in both there is sin.
It is a sin inordinately to love or use the drink, tho the surfeiting or
violence do not follow.

II. 1 These. 5. 8. Let us who are of the day be sober. The Faith of the
Mahometans forbids them to drink wine, and they abstain religiously as the Sons
of Rechab: And the Faith of Christ forbids drunkenness to us, and therefore is
infinitely more powerful to suppress this vice, when we remember that we are
Christians, and to abstain from drunkenness and gluttony is part of the Faith
and discipline of Jesus, and that with these vices neither our love to God, nor
our hopes of heaven can consist.

III. 1 Cor. 6. 12. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought
under the power of any. In all cases be careful that you be not brought under
power of such things which otherwise are lawful enough in the use. To be
perpetually longing, and impatiently desirous of any thing, so that a man
cannot abstain from it, is to loose a man's liberty, and to become a servant of
meat and drink, or smoke.

The Fortieth Meeting.
A.
I. 1 These. 4. 4. -- to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor.
Chastity is that grace which forbids and restrains all irregular desires in the
matter of carnal pleasures, keeping the body and soul pure in that state in
which it is placed by God, whether of the single or of the married life.

II. Revel. 14. 4. Single life is more excellent then the married, in that
degree in which it has greater religion, and a greater mortification; a less
satisfaction of natural desires, and a greater fullness of the spiritual: and
just so is to expect that little Coronet or special reward which God has
prepared (extraordinary and besides the great Crown of all Faithful souls) for
those Who have not defiled themselves with women, but follow the Virgin Lamb
for ever.

III. Hos. 2. 6. The Appetites of uncleanness are full of cares and trouble,
and its fruition is sorrow and repentance. The way of the adulterer is hedged
with thorns: full of fears and jealousies, burning desires and impatient
waitings, tediousness of delay, and sufferance of affronts and amazements of
discovery.

B.
I. Matthew. 5, Blessed are the pure in heart. A pure mind in a chaste body is the
mother of Wisdom and Sober counsel, Love of God and self-denial; peace and
confidence, holy prayer and spiritual comfort and a pleasure of spirit
infinitely greater than the scottish and beastly pleasures of unchastity, For
to overcome pleasure is the greatest pleasure, and no victory is greater then
that which is gotten over our lusts and filthy inclinations. Cyprian.

II. Genesis 26. 11. Abimelech to the men of Gerar made it death to meddle with
the wife of Isaac: and Judah condemned Thamar to be burnt for her adulterous
conception: and God, besides the law made to put the adulterous person to
death, did constitute a settled and constant miracle to discover the adultery
of a suspected woman, that her bowels should burst with drinking the waters of
jealousy. Number. 5. 14.

III. Matthew. 5. If a man lets his eye loose, and enjoys the lust of that, he is
an adulterer. Look not upon a woman to lust after her. And supposing all the
other members restrained, yet if the eye be permitted to lust, the man can no
otherwise be called chaste, than he can be called severe and mortified, that
sits all day long seeing plays and revellings, and out of greediness to fill
his eye neglects his belly.

C.
I. 1 PEt. 1. 22. Seeing ye have purified your souls -- see that ye love one
another, etc. A Virgin that consecrates her body to God, and pollutes her
spirit with rage, or impatience, or inordinate anger, gives him what he most
hates, a most foul and defiled foul.

II. 1 Cor. 7. 5. It is S. Paul's rule, that by consent for a time they should
abstain, that they give themselves to fasting and prayer. And tho when
Christians did receive the holy communion every day, it is ^ertain they did not
abstain, but had children: yet when the Communion was more seldom, they did
with Religion abstain from the marriage bed during the time of their solemn
preparatory devotions, as anciently they did from eating and drinking til the
solemnity of the day was past.

III. Ephesians. 5. 32. Marriage is by Christ hallowed into a mystery to signify the
Sacramental and mystical union of Christ and his Church. He therefore that
breaks this knot, which the Church and their mutual Faith has tied, and Christ
has knit up into a mystery, dishonours a great rite of Christianity, of high
spiritual and excellent signification.

The one and Fortieth Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew. 11. 29. Humility is the great ornament and jewel of Christian
Religion, having been first put in a discipline and made part of a religion by
our Lord Jesus Christ, who propounded himself imitable by his Disciples so
signally in nothing as in the twin sisters o Meekness and humility: Learn of me
for I am Meek and humble, etc.

II. Dan. 4. 27. Entertain no fancies of vanity and private whispers of this
Devil of pride: such as was that of Nebuchadnezzar, Is not this great Babylon
which I have built for the honor of my name? Some fantastic spirits will
walk alone, and dream waking of greatnesses, of Palaces, of excellent Orations,
loud applauses: nothing but the fumes of pride.

III. Jam. 4. 6. God resists the proud, professing open defiance and
hostility against such persons; but gives grace to the humble, Grace and
pardon, content in all conditions, tranquillity of spirit, patience in
afflictions; love abroad, peace at home; and freedom from contention, and the
sin of censuring others, and the trouble of being censured themselves.

B.
I. Matthew. 7. 3. The humble man will not judge his brother for the mote in his
eye, being more troubled at the beam in his own eye; and is patient and glad to
be reproved, because himself has cast the first stone at himself and therefore
wonders not that others are of his mind.

II. Joh. 13. 15. I have given you an example. His whole life was a great
continued example of humility, a vast descent from the glorious bosom of his
Father to the swomb of a poor Maiden; to the form of a ervant, to the miseries
of a sinner, to a life of labor, to a state of poverty, to a death of
malefactors, to the grave of death, and to the intolerable calamities which we
deserved: and it were a good design, and yet but reasonable, that we should be
as humble in the midst of our greatest imperfections and basest sins, as Christ
was in the midst of his fullness of the spirit, great wisdom, perfect life, and
most admirable Virtues.

III. Phil. 4. 8. Be a curious observer of all those things which are of good
report, and are parts of public honesty, public same, and the sentence of
prudent and public persons is the measure of good and evil in things
indifferent.

C.
I. JAm. 3. 2. The due managery of this unruly and slippery member, the tongue,
may rightly be esteemed one of the greatest mysteries of Wisdom and Virtue: If
any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, etc. The story of Pambo
a Primitive Christian is here to be remembered.

II. Matthew. 12. 37. Tho in our depraved estimate the ^loquence of language is
more regarded then the innocence; tho we think our words vanish with the breath
that utters them, yet they become records in Gods Court, are laid up in his
Archives as witnesses either for or against us: for he who is truth it self
has told us, that by thy Words shall thou be justified, and by thy Words thou
shall he condemned.

III. Matthew. 18. 7. As in all civil insurrections the Ringleader is looked on
with a particular severity; so doubtless in private quarrels the first provoker
has by his seniority a double portion of the guilt, and may consequently expect
of the punishment according to the doctrine of our Savior, Woe be to that man
by whom the offense comes.

The two and Forrtieth Meeting.
A
I. JOh. 8. 44. False accusation is of all other sins the most diabolical,
being a conjunction of two of Satan's most essential properties, malice and
lying. It Is his peculiar title, The accuser of the brethren, and when we
transcribe his copy, we also assume his nature, entitle our selves to a descent
from him, Ye are of your Father the Devil.

II. Revel. 2. We find the Love of a lie ranked in an equal form with the
maker. And surely he must be presumed to love it that can descend to be the
broker to it, help it to pass current in the World

III. 2 Timothy 2. 25. With meekness instruct the contrary minded, Each Sect or
Opinion represents its Antagonist as odious as it can, and whilst they contend
for speculative truth, they by mutual calumnies forfeit the practice: a sad
thing, that those who all pretend to the same Christianity, should only be
unanimous in the violating that truth and charity it prescribes.

B.
I. Matthew. 22. 20. There is nothing does more secure Satan's title to us, than
^^e vice of Calumny, it bearing his proper impress and figure: and we may fear
Christ will one day make the same Judgment of persons, as he did of Coin, and
award them to him whose Image and Superscription they bear.

II. 1 Cor. 13. 5. Charity, whose property it is, not to seek her own, will
prompt me to prefer a greater concern of my neighbors before a slight one of
my own; but in equal circumstances, I am sure at liberty to be kind first to my
self. If I will recede even from that, I may: but that is then to be accounted
among the heroic Hights of Charity, not her binding and indispensible laws.

III. 1 King. 18. 44. To an envious person every little infirmity or passion,
looked on through his optics, appears a mountainous guilt. He can improve the
least speck or freckle into a leprosy, which shall overspread the whole man,
and a cloud no bigger than a man's hand, like that of Elisha, may in an instant
with the help of prejudice, grow to the utter darkning of the brightest
reputation, and fill the whole horizon with tempest and horror.

C.
I. Matthew. 5. Is it not a great shame, that that evangelical precept, doing as
we would be done to, which met with so much reverence even from heathens, that
Severus the Emperor preferred it to all the maxims of Philosophers, should be
thus comtemned and violated by Cbristians.

II. Matthew. 7. 1. Private Judgments are superseded by our great Lawgiver in
that express prohibition, Judge not, and that backed with a severe penalty, that
ye be not judged. As God has appropriated vengeance to himself, so has he
judicature also; and it is an invasion of his peculiar, for any but his
delegates, the lawful Magistrates, to pretend to either.

III. 1 Cor. 13. Love is patient, and content with any thing, so it be together
with its Beloved: Love is also impatient of any thing that may displease the
beloved person, hating all sin as the enemy of its friend.

The three and Fortieth Meeting.
A.
I. GAl. 6. 15. In Christ Jesus neither circumcision, etc. i. e. In the Gospel
and Religion of Christ, nothing is of any value to recommend us to the favor
of God, but a new nature, a holy and Virtous life: The Law preferred
circumcision before uncircumcision, but the Gospel of Christ makes no such
distinction, but instead of these external signs, requires the inward purity
of the heart.

II. Ephesians. 4. 20, 21. But ye have not so learned Christ, if so be, etc. What can
learning Christ signify, but learning the Gospel of Christ? And how could the
Ephesians who never saw Christ in the flesh be said to hear him in any other
sense, then as they heard his Gospel preached to them? And to be instructed in
him as the truth is in Jesus (for so (...) signifies) must be expounded of his
Religion, in its genuine and primitive simplicity, so as Christ taught his
disciples.

I. I. 2 Cor. 5. 17. If any man be in Christ he is a new Creature, i. e. Every
sincere Christian is a new Creature; or, Whosoever professes the Faith of
Christ, and lives in the Society of the Christian Church, has obliged himself
to live a new life.

B.
I. 1 Timothy 2. 4. God would have all men to be saved. We cannot imagine why he
should lay a narrower design of Love in the Redemption, than in the Creation of
Mankind; that when in the first Creation, he designed all men for happiness, in
the new and second Creation he should design and intend the happiness only of
some few; which is to make him less Good in Redeeming than in Creating Mankind,
tho Creation cost him no more than the Exercise of his Power, but Redemption
the expense of his blood.

II. Tit. 2. 12. Teaching us that denying ungodliness, etc. Christ's great
design was to reform the debaucht manners of the World, to reduce mankind to
the Obedience of God, to Teach men how to live as well as ^alk, and to restore
the practice of Piety and Justice, of Meekness and Humility, and an Universal
Good Will; and so to restore them to that Honor, and Happiness, and
immortality they had lost.

III. Romans 8. 9. If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his,
i. e. Unless he have the same temper and disposition of mind which Christ had,
which is called having the Spirit of Christ, by an ordinary figure of the cause
for the effect; for all those Virtues and Graces, wherein our conformity to
Christ, consists, are called the Fruits of the Spirit, Ephesians. 5. 9.

C.
I. GAl. 4. 19. Christ is formed in us, when we are thoroughly instructed in the
doctrine and Religion of Christ, and are thereby molded into his likeness and
Image: When we love God and men, as our Savior did; when we are Meek, and
humble, and patient, and contented, as he was.

II, Joh. 3. 5. To he born again of Water, is to be made the Disciples of
Christ, and Subjects of his Spiritual Kingdom by making a public profession
of our Faith in Christ, and of Obedience to him in our Baptism, and we are born
of the Spirit too, when our minds become subject to Christ, and our Faith is
sincere and hearty, and governs all the Motions and Desires of our Souls, and
makes us really such as we pretend to be: for all Christian Graces and Virtues
are in Scripture attributed to the Spirit of God, as the Author of them.

III. Luke 10. 16. He that hears you hears me, and He that despises, etc.
When nothing is made the condition of our Communion, which is expressly
forbidden by the Laws of our supreme Lord, we acknowledge his Authority in our
subjection to our spiritual Guides; and we disown his Authority in disowning
and affronting theirs.

The four and Fortieth Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew. 5. 44. I say unto you, Love your enemies, etc. He that shall compare
these precepts with the practices of most men, will be ready to say with
Linacer: A^t hoe non est Evangelium, aut nos non sumus Evangelici. Such is the
palpable contradiction of the lives of the generality of Christian men now, to
the Rules of the Religion.

II. Heb. 10. 25. Forsake not the assembling etc. The confluence to the public
worship was in his days so Great, and consent of heart and voice so universal,
that S. Hierom^ said, The Hallelujahs of the Church was like the noise of many
waters, and the Amen like thunder.

III. Romans 1. 8. The Roman Church, whose Faith was Famous, and spoken of
through all the World, is now as infamous for usurpation, superstition, and
cruelty, and so deformed with Pagan rites that Christianity is the least part
of her.

B.
I. Genesis 50. 20. God disposed it for Good. It is the usual method of Almighty
God to bring about his own designs, by making the sinister intensions of men
cooperate toward them. He made use of the unnatural cruelty of Joseph's
brethren to the preservation of the whole family of Jacob, sending Joseph, as a
harbinger and nurse, to provide for them in a famine, The obstinacy and
incredulity of the Jews proved to be the riches of the Gentiles. The
persecution of the Apostles at Jerusalem made way for the spreading of the
Gospel into all other Countries. Instances of this kind are innumerable.

II. Gal. 1. 8. If an Angel from heaven, etc. If we admit of new revelations,
we lose the old, and our Religion together; we accuse our Savior and his
Apostles, as if they had not sufficiently revealed Gods mind to the World, and
we incur S. Paul's Anathema, which he denounces against him, whosoever he shall
be. If an Angel from heaven, that shall preach any other doctrine than what had
been recieved. And S. Jude has told us, the Faith was once, that is, at once,
or once for all, delivered to, or by the Saints.

III. 1 Cor. ^. 4. The Church of Corinth first needed the severe check of an
Apostle for their wantonness and divisions, that one was of Paul another of
Cephas, etc. And who can give a more probable account of this their luxuriancy,
than from the riches, ease, plenty, and liberty of that City.

C.
I. 11. Romans 12. 18. When he so passionately exhorts, If it be possible, and so
far as in you lies have pe^^^ with all men, surely he did not mean, that we
should only accept of peace when it is offered us for nothing; or be quiet, till
we can pick a quarr^l: but that we should be at some cost to purchase it, and
part with something for it, and deny our selves something, which (but upon that
account) we might ^^lly have enjoyed.

II. 1. Cor. 1. 20. I became things to all men. He was no longer a starcht
inflexible Pharisee, but a complaisant Christian, as some perhaps would have
called him, a Latidudinarian He that will sacrifice nothing to public
tranquillity must live in perpetual flames here, whatsoever become of him
hereafter.

III. Act 15. 29. When a Council of the Apostles at Jerusalem decreed, that the
Gentiles should abstain from things strangled and from blood, they deprived
them of a part of their Christian liberty, merely to conciliate the Jews to
them, and required that to be done for peace, which no Law of God required at
their hands.

The five and Fortieth Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew. 17. 27. Our Savior himself, when he came into the world, complied
with the laws and customs which he found; when a certain tribute was demanded
of him, he first proves that he was not obliged to pay it, yet least he should
offend them, determins to pay it, and works a miracle to enable Peter to do it.

II. Jer. 6. 16. Stand upon the way and enquire etc. i. e. Inquire for a better
way, but stand upon the old ways till you have discovered it. And its
reasonable, before we leave the present Church Way, to produce a better model,
least instead of having a new Church we have no Church.

III. Romans 16. 16. The holy kiss, the feasts of love, the order of Deaconesses
are no where now observed; several things instituted by the Apostles were
intended, and so construed to be obliging only so long as circumstances should
stand as then they did, and no longer. It Was no design of the Apostles to bind
the Church for ever to a certain form of rituals.

B.
I. Ephesians. 2. 14. The Jewsh Rituals were contrived on purpose to distinguish
them from all other people in the world, and therefore is called the middle
wall of partition. But the Christian Religion was to throw down all enclosures,
and make of all nations one people, and therefore must be left with that
freedom as to circumstanials, that all nations, notwithstanding their diverse
customs and forms of government, might be capable of receiving it.

II. Math. 23, 24. We must have better notions of God, than to think him a
Captious Deity that watches advantages against his Creatures; nor make Religion
a piece of nice scrupulosity, and consequently must we neither swallow Camels
nor strain at gnats, but serve God with the generosity of a free and a
comfortable mind.

III. Ma^^h. 1^. 7. If you had known what that means etc. It is as if our
Savior had said, Had you censorious Pharisees, understood either God or
Religion, as ye might and ought to have done, ye would have known that so long
as there is not contumacy and contemt in the omission of those Rituals, but the
excuse of a just necessity or the rational consideration of a greater good to
preponderate the omission, God does not impute it for a sin.

C.
I. ACts 16. 3. The Apostle circumcised Timothy, to the intent that thereby he
might render himself and his ministry more acceptable to the Jews. wherein he
has taught us, that all ceremonial Appendages are perfectly subordinate, and
ought to yield to the designs of peace, charity, and edification, as the
greater good.

II. Romans 14. 17. The Kingdom of God, i* e. the Gospel, is not meat and drink
i. e. consists not, or lays little str^ss upon those nice and perplexing
matters, but in righteousness peace and joy: All the weight is laid upon the
more substantial observances of a righteous and Holy life, and a peaceable
spirit and conversation.

III. 1 Cor. 13. 7. Charity believes all things, hops all things. Christian
simplicity, as it means no hurt, so it does not easily suspect any. But it is
the genius of an evil man to suspect every man means mischief, because he does
so himself. It Is natural for all men to take measures by themselves.

The six and Forti^th Meeting.
A.
I. Matthew. 4, 5. Jerusalem the Holy City. The Papists are much pleased with
calling themselves Catholics, and that sometimes others call them so; not
considering in the mean while, that titles in all tongues do continue most
commonly long after the things signified by them are gone, upon the same
account that St. Matthew calls Jerusalem the Holy City, tho this had lost her
Holiness, as that has depraved her Religion,

II. Luke. 8. 5. Papists have the common Faith, and their own proper Romanism,
to the very same or like purpose, as the Jews have the Law and the Prophets,
and the Talmud of their Rabbis; and as the Turks have both much of Moses and
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and all the impieties of Mabomet; this latter to
choke the former, a^ the thorns in the parable did the good seed.

III. Matthew. 26. 13. Mark. 14. ^. The true doctrine of Christ only, and all
such other Holy Precepts, Ordinances and Traditions as were proper to his
Gospel, as they went forth with a Commission, had suitable power to carry them,
and to maintain them throughout all parts, and to all Creatures every where
(whom God would call) in the whole world. Hence come such Doctrines, and the
Churches on their account to be called Catholic.

B.
I. MArk. 9. 34. If God intended a supreme power for S. Peter, a public
declaration might have presently both quelled the dangerous and undecided
contention among the Disciples, who should be the greatest; and prevented all
the disorders, which have ever since troubled the Church for want of knowing
this supreme and infallible Governor.

II. Judge. 2. 10, 11, 12. All the Roman prayers and devotions to Saints has
not so much as the shadow of Catholic: for it crept in among Christians; as
the Baalim did in Israel, when the Holy men that had seen Moses and Joshua, and
the elders of that generation were all departed; when our Savior, and his
Apostles, and the first preachers of the Gospel had left the world.

III. 2 Cor. 6. 15. No sincere Israelite can ever think of being saved by the
Religion of Dan and Bethel, because it keeps still Moses Law; nor by the
Samaritan Religion, because they serve God as well as Baal, Mixed and corrupt
Religions are not to be valued so much in what is trodden under men's feet, as
by what is predominant and set upon their high Altars. The great building
raised at Jerusalem by Adrian, did not cease to be Jupiters Temple for being
raised upon Holy foundations.

C.
I. MArk. 16. 20. 1 Cor. 14. 12. True Christian Mira^les are commonly but for a
time* and for the Authorizing of the Gospel: For the gift of Working miracles
is as that of speaking languages, intended for the conversion of unbelievers,
and for assisting the Gospel, whenever it should be first preached.

II. Matthew. 7. 22. The true Mira^les done in Christ's Name (and power too) shall
recommend only Christ's Gospel, not their iniquity who work them.

III. 2 These. 2. 9. The Roman Miracles, after that the Gospel had been
abundantly confirmed over all the world by true Miracles, were done in times
reserved for false miracles, and are branded by this prediction, that
Antichrist should come and enchant men with strong delusions and lying wonders.

The seven and Fortieth Meeting.
A.
I. 2. COr. 6. 17. Be ye separate: This text cannot clear our separatists from
the guilt of Schism: which is a voluntary departure, without just cause given,
from the Church whereof they were once members: or, a breach of that Communion
wherein a man might have continued without sin.

II. Judge. 18. 7. The magistrates are called Masters of restraint. Hebr. And as
such, they must needs be an eye sore to all loose or exorbitant persons, who do
consequently wish, that Authority should lose its force and laws their
veneration, that so their vices may be uncontrouled.

III. Acts. 15. 10. The law of Moses was a yoke which neither we nor our
fathers were able to bear: upon this account especially, because it enjoined a
great number of little Observances, which by their multitude were hard to be
remembered, by their nicety difficult to be observed, and having no essential
goodness in themselves had less power upon the consciences of men to awaken
their care and diligence about them.

B.
I. Acts 15. 29. The Apostles in their Council found out a middle way for the
Jews and Gentiles to meet in: that the Gentile Converts should comply with the
Jews in abstaining from fornieation, from things strangled, and from blood; and
on the other side the Jewish Converts should abate of their rigor, and not
require of the Gentiles the strict rerms of complete Judaism.

II. Gal. 3. 19. Where unto then served the Law? It was added etc. It was a
kind of Interim, or like a parenthesis, which when it shall be left out, the
former and latter parts join together again without any interruption of the
sense: i. e. when this Interim, or temporary provision of the Law shall be
taken away, the primitive Patriararchal Religion, and that brought in by our
Savior, shall seem to be of one piece, the latter beginning where the former
ended.

III. Romans 19. 2. Let every one of us please his neighbor. i. e. in such things
as are not not the matter of any law. For as I must have respect to my brothers
infirmity, so must I much more reverence God's ordinance, the lawful Magistrate.

C.
I. GAl. 5. 13. By love serve one another. And with great equity: for he that
will provoke his brother to sin, by doing that which he himself can omit
without sin, is guilty of sin in so doing.

II. 1 Cor. 8. 13. If meat make my brother to offend, etc. The eating of flesh
was under no command, and consequently he should not offend if he forbear it;
therefore he resolves that he would abridge himself of his own liberty, rather
than offend another.

III. Ephesians. 3. 8. Haman designing to ruin the whole Church of the Jews, first
delates their Religion as not fit for the protection of the Prince, that it
contained laws contrary to all people, and that they would not obey the Kings
Laws. There is nothing casts so indelible a blemish upon Religion, as when the
professors of it are turbulent, unperswadable; ungovernable.

The eight and Fortieth Meeting.
A
I. GAl. 3. 27. He that is baptized into Christ has put on Christ i. e. has
engaged himself to be conformed to his Image and likeness, to adorn his mind
with all those virtues and graces which appeared in our Savior's life.

II. John. 6. 53. The Lords Supper is a spiritual seeding on Christ, Eating his
flesh and drinking his blood: That is, when those visibles figures of his death
and sufferings affect our minds with such a strong and passionate sense of his
love to us, and excite in us such a hope in God as transforms us into a divine
nature. And this is our real union to Christ; as it were flesh of his flesh,
and bone of his bones* Ephesians. 5. 30.

III. 1 John. 1. 6. If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in
darkness, we lie. i. e. We abuse ourselves, if we hope that God will own
himself our Father, and bestow the inheritance of children on us, while we live
in sin: but when we join the practice of real righteousness with the visible
profession of Christianity, then God will own us for his children, and Christ
for true members of his body.

B.
I. 2 COr. 6. 14. Be ye not unequally yoked with unbelievers i. e. have no
society with those men, whose religion is so contrary to yours, that you will
be as uneasy to each other, as two heifers in the same yoke, which draw
different ways.

II. 1 Cor. 10. 16. Is it not the communion of the body of Christ. He calls it
the communion because it signifies the fellowship of Christians with each
other, and as it signifies also our fellowship with God; for we eat of the
Sacrifice which is God's meat, being entertained at his Table.

III. 1 John 1. 3. Our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus
Christ. When we join in communion with the Church of Christ, and live in a
regular subjection to our spiritual Governors, and a mutual discharge of all
Christian offices, when we profess to believe the Gospel, and to obey the laws
of our common Savior; then we are visibly united to Christ, as subjects to
their Prince, and members to their head. And when this profession is sincere
and hearty, then our union to Christ is real and spiritual too. And this union
or fellowship with Christ entitles us to his peculiar care and providence.

C.
I. JOh. 1. 16. Of his fullness we all received, and Grace for Grace. The
fullness which was in Christ is a fullness of Grace and truth: This Grace and
truth is opposed to the Law of Moses, and signifies the Gospel, which is a
Covenant of Grace, and is expressly called the Grace of God, Tit. 2. 11. and
contains the most clear Revelations of the divine will, in opposition to types
and shadows. This is the fullness we receive from Christ, a perfect relation of
the divine will concerning the salvation of mankind, which contain^ so many
excellent promises, that it may well be called Grace; and prescribes such a
plain and simple religion so agreeable to the natural notions of good and evil,
that it may well be called Truth. The repetition of the word Grace with a
preposition, signifies only that abundance of grace which is now manifested by
the Gospel of Christ.

II. Joh. 1. 18. No man has seen God, etc. i. e. No man ever before had so
perfect a knowledge of the will of God (which is here called seeing God, because
sight gives us the clearest evidence and the most perfect and particular
knowledge) but the Son of God, who perfectly understood all his most secret
counsels, has perfectly declared the will of his Father to us.

III Col. 2. 3. In Christ are hid all the Treasures: rather, in whom are all
the hidden Treasures of Wisdom and knowledge. i. e. who has now revealed to us
all those Treasures which in former ages were hidden from the world.

The nine and Fortieth Meeting.
A.
I. COl. 2. 9. For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead (of the
Deity) bodily. An allusive and metaphorical expression. For God, who is a
spirit, cannot in a proper sense dwell Bodily in any thing. Here is an allusion
to Gods dwelling in the Temple at Jerusalem by Types and Figures, which were
the symbols of his presence. Bodily is opposed to figurative and typical: and
this is a plain demonstration of the perfection of the Gospel-revelation, that
the fullness of the Deity dwelt substantially in Christ: we need not doubt, but
that so excellent a prophet as he was, in whom the Deity it self inhabited,
has perfectly revealed God's will to us.

II. Ephesians: 1. 23. Which is his Body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.
Where the Church is called the fullness of Christ, which makes him (as it were)
complete and perfect: for he cannot be a perfect head without a body. Hence the
Church is called Christ, 1. Cor. 12. 12. And Beza tells us this is the reason
of that phrase which so frequently occurs in the new Testament, of being in
Christ, i. e. being members of the Christian Church.

III. Ephesians. 1. 23. The Christian Church is called the fullness of Christ, with
respect to its extent and Universality, that it is not confined to any
particular nation, as the Jewish Church was, but takes in Jews and Gentiles,
bond and free. For this, if we consult the Text, seems to be the meaning of,
Col. 1. 19. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell. He
is made the Head of the Universal Church both in heaven and earth.

B.
I. Ephesians. 1. 23. He fills all in all, i. e. does not confine his care and
providence, and the influences of his grace, to any one Nation or People, but
extends it to the whole world.

II. Ephesians. 4. 13. To the measure of the Stature of the fullness of Christ. Which
is the explication of to a perfect man; i. e. to that perfection of Faith and
knowledge which becomes the Christian Church

III. John. 18. 6. I am the way, the truth and the life. i. e. I declare the
true and only way to life and happiness, and no man can thoroughly understand
the will of God, nor consequently be a true worshipper of him, without learning
of me.

C.
I. IOh. 11. 26. I am the resurrection and the life, etc. i. e. He has power
to raise the dead, and will actually raise all those who are his sincere
^ollowers, and reward them with immortality.

II. Joh. 5. 25. Tbe dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, etc. i. e. He
first raises those who are dead in sin to a new spiritual life, and then has
authority to raise them to an immortal life.

III. Col. 3. 3. You are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. You
profess your selves to be dead to this World, in Conformity to the death of
Christ; and that immortal life, which you expect to enjoy with Christ, is at
present concealed from your view.

The Fiftieth Meeting.
A.
I. 1 COr. 1. 22. The Jews require a sign, and the Greeks, etc. The Jews were
all for signs and miracles, the Greeks were for curious Philosophical
speculations, which might gratify their inquisitive minds; and therefore
neither of them could relish the plain simple Doctrine of a Crucified Christ.

II. 1 Cor. 1. 24. This crucified Savior is the power of God and the wisdom
of God. i. e. the most powerful method which was ever used by God for the
reforming the World, and the contrivance and effect of excellent wisdom. And
thus the Gospel of Christ is called the power of God to salvation to them that
believe, Romans 1. 16. And by this foolishness of preaching, i. e. by preaching
this foolish doctrine (as it was accounted by the wise men of the World) of a
crucified Christ, it pleased God to save them that believe.

III. Jer. 23. 6. Christ is expressly called The Lord our Righteousness. ^s it,
that the only Righteousness where with we must appear before God is the
^ightenousness of Christ imputed to us? Or rather, Righteousness here signifies
no more than Mercy, kindness and beneficence? And so the Lord our Righteousness
is the Lord who does good to us, who is our Savior and deliverer. Which is
very agreeable to the reason of this name, that in his days Judah shall be
saved, and Israel shall dwell safely

B.
I. ISai. 54. 17. Their Righteousness is of me says the Lord. Which is a
parallel expression to The Lord our Righteousness, and signifies no more than
that God will avenge their cause, and deliver them from all their enemies.

II. Isa. 61. 10. The Garments of Salvation and the robe of Righteousness do
not signify an imputed righteousness, but those great deliverances God
promised to Israel in the former verses, which should make them as glorious in
the eyes of men, as a splendid garment would.

III. Matthew. 5. 19, 20. Our Savior in his Sermons to the peoplemakes ^o
mention at all of imputed righteousness, but severely injoyns them the practice
of of an universal righteousness, and threatens those who break the least
commandment, that they shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

C
I. PHil. 3. 9. Is it not worth observing that in all the New Testiment there
is no such expression as the Righteousness of Christ imputed? We find there the
Righteousness of God (that which he commands and rewards) and the Righteousness
of Faith, and ^he Righteousness of God which is by Faith in Jesus Christ. Is i^
not strange that neither Christ nor his Apostl^s should once tell us of the
Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, did the mystery of the Gospel consist in
it?

II. Romans 3. and 4. The great Dispute in the Epistle to the Romans is, whether
we must be justified by the Law of Moses or by the Faith of Christ. That is,
whether the observation of all the external Rites and Ceremoni^s of the Law,
and an external conformity of our actions to the moral precepts of it, will
justify a man before God; or that sincere and universal obedience, which the
Gospel of Christ r^quires, which transforms our minds into the likeness of God,
and makes us new creatures.

III. Romans 4. 3. Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for
Righteousness: And this, while he was uncircumcised; Which is a convincing
argument against the Jews, that circumcision and the observance of the Law of
Moses is not necessary to justification. Because Abraham, who was the Father of
the Faithful, and is set forth for a pattern of our justification, was
justified without it.

The one and Fiftieth Meeting.
A:
I. HEb. 2. 10. God sent sent his Son into the world to take upon him our
nature, and him being the Captain of our Salvation he would perfect through
sufferings; that no man might think it much to suffer, when God spared not his
own Son; and every man might submit to the necessity, when the Christ of God
was not exempt. And yet no man could fear the event, which was to follow sad
beginnings, when it behoved even Christ to suffer, and so to enter into glory.

II. Eccles. 12. 7. God did not only by Revelation and the Sermons of the
Prophets to his Church, but even to all mankind, competently teach, and
effectively persuade, that the soul of man does not die; but that although things
were ill here, yet they should be well hereafter; that the evils of this life
were short and tolerable; and that to the good, who usually feel most of them,
they should end in honor and advantages.

III. 2 These. 1. 5. We must through much tribulation, etc. Christ himself, and
his Apostles, and his whole army of Martyrs, dyed under the violence of evil
men. When Virtue made good men poor, and free speaking of brave truths made the
wise to lose their liberty; when an excellent life hastened an opprobrious
death, and the obeying God destroyed our selves; it was but time to look about
for another state of things, where justice should rule and Virtue find her own
portion; where the men that were like to God in justice and mercy, should also
partake of his felicity.

B.
I. 1. COr. 15. 19. If in this life only etc. We are sick and we are
afflicted, we do well and we are disgraced, we tell truths and few believe us,
speak well and we are derided; but the proud are exalted, and the wicked are
delivered, and evil men reign over us, and the covetous snatch our little
bundles of money from us, and every where the wisest and the best men are
oppressed: but therefore because it is thus, and thus it is not well, we hope
for some great good thing hereafter. For if in this life only we had hope, then
we Christians, all we to whom persecution is allotted for our portion, we^ who
must be patient under the Cross, and receive injuries and say nothing but
prayers; We certainly were of all men the most miserable.

II. 1 Cor. 15. 19. If in this life only we had hopes, says the Apostle,
meaning that in another life also we have hopes, we shall go into another
place, and in the state of separation we shall have more hopes: our faith shall
have more evidence, and our hope, shall be of more certainty and perspicuity,
and next to possessions; we shall have very much good, and be very sure of much
more.

III. Matthew. 22. 32. God is the God of Abraham etc. i. e. the gracious God, the
Benefactor, the Rewarder, and there fore Abraham is not dead, but is fallen a
sleep, and he shall be restored in the Resurrection to receive those blessings
and rewards, by the title of which, God was called the God of Abraham.

C.
I. 1 COr. 15. 19. Then are we of all men most miserable. But because this
cannot be, that God who is ust and good should suffer them that heartily serve
him, to be really and finally miserable, and yet in this world they are so,
very frequently: therefore in another world, they shall live to receive a full
recompense of reward. Deus est justus, animus est imm^rtalis, S. Clemens.

II. Mark. 12. 27. God is not the God of the Dead but of the Living: But God is
the God of Abraham, and the other Patriarchs: Therefore they are not dead; dead
to this world, but alive to God: That is, tho this life be lost, yet they shall
have another and a better: a life in which God shall manifest himself to be
their God to all the purposes of benefit and eternal blessings.

III. Job. 35. 10. God my Maker is he that gives Songs in the night. said
Elihu. That is, the servant of God is not so permitted to the malice of evil
men, or the asperities of fortune, that they have not many refreshments, and
great comforts, and the perpetual sestivities of a Holy conscience. God as a
reward gives a cheerful spirit, and makes a man to sing with joy; when other
men are sad with the solemn darkness, and with the affrights of conscience, and
with the illusions of the night.

The two and Fiftieth Meeting.
A.
I. Luke 16. 19. It is remarkable in the parable of Dives and Lazarus, that the
poor man, the afflicted Saint dyed first, Dives being permitted to his purple
and fine linen, to his delicious fare, and (which he most of all needed) to a
space of repentance: But in the mean time the poor man was rescued from his sad
portion of this life and carried into Abraham's bosom.

II. Luke 16. 22. Into Abraham's bosom. He who was denied in this World to be
feasted even with the portion of dogs, was placed in the bosom of the
Patriarch, that is in the higstest room: for so it was in their Discubitus, or
lying down to mea^: the chief guest, the most beloved person, did lean upon the
bosom of the master of the feast, so did S. John l^an upon the breast of
Jesus, and so did Lazarus upon the breast of Abraham.

III. Ibid. Sinus Abraham may be rendered, the bay of Abraham, alluding to the
place of rest, where ships p^tin after a tempestuous and dangerous navigation.
The storm was quickly over with the poor man; and the Angel of God brought the
good man's soul to a safe port, where he should be disturbed no more.

B.
I. REvel. 14. 13. Blessed are the dead. As soon as ever the soul goes from the
body, it is blessed. Blessed, I say, but not perfect: it rejoices in peace and
a holy hope. Here we have hopes mingled with fear, there our hope is hightened
with joy and confidence: it is all the comfort that can be, in the expectation
of unmeasurable joys: it is only, not fruition, not the joys of a perfect
possession, but less then that, it is every good thing else. It is the comfort
of that joy, which makes them blessed, who die in the love of God, and in the
faith and obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ.

II. Luke 23. ^3. Our blessed Savior told the converted thief, he should that
day ^e with him in paradise. As the Garden of Eden was a place o^ great beauty,
pleasure and tranquillity; so the state of separate souls, was a state of peace
and excellent delights. That day both Christ and the Thief were to be in
Paradise: but Christ himself was not then ascended into heaven, and therefore
Paradise was no part of that region, where Christ now, and the Saints
hereafter* s^all reign in glory. Christ said, tho you only ask to be remembered
when I come into my Kingdom, not only that shall be performed in time, but even
to day thou shall have great refreshment, the comfort of Paradise* as Lazarus
was comforted.

III. 2 Cor 12. 2. 4. Taken up into the third Heaven: into Paradise. The
raptures and visions were distinct. For S. Paul being a Jew, and speaking after
the manner of his nation, makes Paradise a distinct thing from the third
heaven: the Jews deny any orbs to be in heaven, but they make three regions
only, the one of clouds, the second of Stars, and the third of Angels.

C.
I. REvel. 2. 7. To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life
By eating of this tree of life in the Paradise of God, is meant, that they who
dye well shall immediately be feasted with the deliciousness of a holy
Conscience: their tree of life shall germinate, they shall then feel the
Comforts of having done good works, a sweet remembrance and a Holy peace shall
caress and feast them, and there they shall walk in white, Revel. 3. 4. as
candidats of the resurrection to immortality.

II. Matthew. 8. 11. Sit down with Abraham Because he is the father of the
faithful, therefore to be with Abraham, or to sit down with Abraham (in the
time of the old Testament) did signify the same thing as to be in Paradise:
but to be in Abraham's bosom, signifies a great eminence of place and comfort,
which is indulged to the most excellent and the most afflicted.

III. Phil 1. 23. As being with Abraham was the specification of the more
general word of Paradise in the Old Testament; so being with Christ is the
specification of it in the New, so S. Stephen prayed, Lord Jesus receive my
spirit, and S. Paul said, I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.
