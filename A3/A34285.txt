A CONGRATULARY POEM, ON THE Safe Arrival of King William TO ENGLAND, In this
present Year 1699.
COme all ye People of our English Shore,
Praise God for that our King is now come over
Once more unto our Nation, for to sway
His Golden Scepter, and us Rule each Day,
In Peace and Love, as we all ought to be,
Governed and Led by his Great Majesty;
And here our Hopes they do begin to be
Renewed to us in Felicity,
Expecting Trading, now he is come to Land
To Rule and Govern with a wise Command,
Great Man of God, whom God does Call and Choose,
On Earth his Great Lieutenants place to use,
We Bless the time, wherein the threefold Crown,
And Diadem with Peace and great Renown,
In that so long foretold and stately Cheer,
Thou on thy Brave and Royal Brow did bear,
As from that time thy Absence bred us bain,
Thy presence now Restores us joys again,
Thou wents away to England's deep Displeasure,
But thy Return Brings Mirth beyond all measure:
Now all true English Men, come give the Praise,
To God above, who to us him did raise,
Who drove Rome's swarming, Plotting Vermin clear,
Out of our Land, all in a happy Year.
Just as Queen Mary's Crew with one accord,
With Bloody Minds, they could naught else afford,
Unto her Subjects, but the Fire and Sword.
No less would these have done, had not he came,
For which we bless Heroic Nassan's Name:
Oh may that God, who does assist all Men,
Direct me here with my unlearned Pen,
To speak of him and his most Nobler ways
Great Monarch, here I Will issue forth his Praise,
And naught but what was always his just due
Considering what he did for us go through,
So let him Rule in Honor and great Fame,
Who with his Sword, unto our Rescue came;
Come now ye Nations, all prepare to Ring
For the Return, of this our Mighty King,
Who in the Field, his Foes did dread to see,
Because they took him for their Enemy,
And well they might, for that he Marched through,
Their Walled Ci^ys, and their Warriers slew.
But they it was who gave the chiefest cause,
Who broke at first our Protestants good Laws,
And thou most willingly like Alexander
Come over here, and proved a great Commander,
And certain it is, no Lewis nor French Peer,
Would venture as thou did, when you came here,
England before, had no such one as thee,
Who with great freeness, came this Land to free:
From our great Thraldom, which we were then in
Till thou with Romish Locust did begin,
Just as the Macedonians Swords and Shields,
With Terror went clear through the Persian Fields,
To Alexander, then Darius yields.
So did the Romish Crew, to you great Prince,
Who was so willing us to come and free,
That they dare not once more attempt to come,
For fear with Shame you make them back return
To where they were, in their own Native Land,
Thou makes them know that you do here Command;
And will, till Death, be our great Prince and King,
For which our Nation may Exalt and Sing,
Praises on high for this your safe Return,
Without which you had caused all to Mourn:
But that is all over, we our Joys obtain,
Since that in Safety You are come again,
To be amongst Your loving Subjects here:
Happy's the Day, when you first did appear,
To save this Land, whom France would fain invade,
And cut us off from all sort of good Trade;
But thou appeard'st here with Flaming Sword,
And to our Enemies thou did afford
A civil Usage, though they would betray,
Thy Kingly Person, and thy Crown away.
But they were out, thou keeps thy own, and will,
Thy Law and Promise here on Earth fulfill.
Now that this Princes Days may not be done,
Till the great coming, of God's Blessed Son,
Likewise his Wealth, also his Joy and Peace
May they all as his Reign and Years increase.
London, Printed for A. H. near Aldersgate, 1699.
