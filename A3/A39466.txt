Cum gratia and Privilegio Regiae Majestatis.

TO THE HONORABLE Sir EDWARD TURNER Knight, SPEAKER of the COMMONS House of
PARLIAMENT.
SIR,
HAving observed so many Learned and worthy Persons, upon diverse occasions,
both in their Studies and Employments, especially at the Assizes and Sessions
of Peace, to make use of Mr. Wingate's Abridgment of the Statutes with good
Approbation, I could not but think a little Pains might be well bestowed, in
continuing the same Method, and adding to it the Statutes made in the time of
His present Majesty, and inserting the same, especially such as are of public
and daily use, under their proper Titles; and seeing how eminent a Place and
Part You have had in the Passing the same, it seemed to Me not improper, by
this Address under Your Name, to advertise such others also, as may have
occasion to make use of this Book; That although for the most part You may find
the Statutes, at the least those of frequent use, so fully abridged, that I
hope You will not have often occasion, to trouble Your Self with the Books at
large, or to seek for such as be dispersed: Yet being but an Abridgment,
continued of the late Acts, as of the other, when You shall doubt or find any
thing obscure, the unavoidable accident of Brevity, You would not rely on it,
but have recourse to the Statutes at large; some of which, to avoid the
increasing of the Book to too great a bulk, especially such as be but upon
continuance, I have only pointed at and referred to: And as to the late Acts
passed at Oxford, being after the Book was almost finished in the Press, they
are added by way of Appendix: And such Statutes as more particularly concern
the Justices of the Peace, and Penal Laws, are marked with a Hand or Star.

And for the Table being Mr. Wingate's own, I was unwilling to alter the Frame,
but rather supply it with the Additional Heads and Titles; which though at
first, it may seem somewhat general, yet by diligent observation, the Method
and References, to particular Clauses under the several Heads, I hope it will
answer the use and ease to the Peruser intended: Which is the Aim and Desire of

SIR, Your very affectionate Friend and Servant, T. M.

at the Qu. Seff. to fine him 20 sh. II. The Qu. Seff. or two such Justices have
power to put down Alehouses at their discretion, and to take Bond and surety of
Alehouse-keepers by recognisance, that they shall not use unlawful Games or

oath, before one Justice, is sufficient conviction. VI. The penalties aforesaid
are given to the poor of the Parish where the offense is committed, and are to
be levied by the Constable and Churchwardens by distress, which after six days
may be sold to satisfy the penalty: and in default of distress, the party
delinquent must suffer imprisonment, till he pay the penalty. VII. Here every
Officer that neglects to levy the said penalties, or rectify (within twenty
days) the default of distress, shall forfeit likewise to the poor forty

at the Ass. Qu. Sess. in corporate Towns and in Leets. XVI. One convicted the
second time of drunkenness, shall be bound in ten pounds with two sureties to
the good behavior. XVII. All Constables, Churchwardens, Headboroughs,

color of his office, without special warrant pertaining to his office,

libero tenemento. VI. It shall also be for Common of Turf-land, fishing, and
such like common appendant to Freehold, or by special deed, (as it heretofore
held place for common pasture) provided the estate therein be (at least) for
life. VII. If any holding for years or in ward aliene the fee, remedy shall be
had by this Writ, and both the feoffors and feoffees shall be had for
disseisors; so that during the life of any of them the said Writ shall hold
place, and if they die, the remedy shall be by Writ of Entry. VIII. The giving
of this Writ in new cases shall not diminish the force thereof in those wherein

without taking the Assise, and shall give to the Plaintiff double damages,

afterward offer to prove to the Court by matter of record, that there was just
exception, whereby the Plaintiff might have been barred, he shall have a Venire

Plaintiff shall be warned to appear at a certain day, and the Defendant shall
then have again his seisin and damages, and the Plaintiff shall be punished by
imprisonment at the discretion of the Justices. In like manner also shall the

the Plaintiff purchased the Assise contrary to his own deed, he shail be
punished, as aforesaid. XI. The Sheriff shall not take an Ox of the disseisee,

Pasture has been usurped during Nonage, Coverture, tenancy in dower, by the
courtesy, for life, years, or in tail, it has been holden, that, if such
possessor of common be deforced, he ought to have Action by Writ of Novel
disseisin: it must now be holden, that such as have entered within the time that
an Assise of Mortdancester has lain, if they had no common before, shall not
recover by Writ of Novel disseisin, albeit they be deforced. XIII. Stat. de
conjunct. feoffatis, 34 E. 1. In an Assise of Novel disseisin, if joynt-tenancy
be pleaded by force of a Deed, upon the Plaintiff's averment against it, the
Justices shall keep the Deed until the trial, and in the mean time shall by
scir' facias summon the absent joynt-tenant to be present with the Defendant at
the said trial, and they shall there maintain the Plea, if they can: But if it
shall then be proved by an Assise, that the Plea was maliciously alleged to
delay the Plaintiff, albeit the Assise does pass for the Defendants, yet he who
pleads that exception shall suffer one whole year's imprisonment, and shall
not be enlarged without grievous fine: And if it be found by Assise, that the
Plaintiff was disseised, he shall recover seisin and double damages, and the
trial shall go on, notwithstanding such plea, and albeit neither of the
pretended joynt-tenants appear; howbeit joynt-tenancy shall not be pleaded by
Bailiffs. XIV. Also in Assizes of Mortdancester, and juris utrum, the like
course shall be taken as in those of Novel disseisin. XV. In other Writs
likewise, whereby Tenants are demanded; save that in them the damages are
referred to the discretion of the Justices. XVI. Stat. Eborum. 34 E. 2.1.

by the disseisee for such lands as are granted by the King's Patent, without
title first found by inquest for the King, without suit to be made to the King
in that behalf; and if the Patentee pray in Aid of the King, a Procedendo shall
be also granted without suit. XIX. Here if the Assise pass for the disseisee,
he shall recover treble damages against the Patentee. XX. Stat. 4 H. 5.8. If
any make forcible entry into lands by way of maintenance, the Chancellor of
England shall grant a special Assise without suing to the King: and if the

forfeit each of them, Sheriff or Bailiff, 40 l. XXII. Stat. 11 H. 6.2. In an
Assise, if the Sheriff be named a disseisor by Collusion, to the end the Writ
may be directed to the Coroner, and the Assise secretly awarded by the tenant's
default, upon the Plaintiff's averment thereof, and if it shall also be found
by the Assise to be so, the Justices shall abate the Writ, and grievously
amerce the Plaintiff. XXIII. Stat. 21 H. 8.3. The Plaintiff in Assise may
abridge his plaint of any part whereunto a bar is pleaded, without prejudice
to the residue.

and issues, and the reversioner to the arrearages: but if he be dead, or be
found of Covin with the demandant, the reversioner shall have all; yet the
tenant may traverse the Covin by Scire facias out of the Judgment or Writ of
Attaint, if he please. XI. Stat. 13 R. 2.18. Upon a false verdict given before
the Mayor and Bailiffs of Lincoln, an Attaint shall be sued in the King's Bench
or Common Pleas, and the Jury shall be of the County of Lincoln, returned by

4. the name of Bailiffs of the City of Lincoln being translated to Sheriffs,
lest it might be douted which Sheriff ought to return the Jury in Attaint, the
former Statute of 13 R. 2.18. is explained and confirmed. XIII. Stat. 11 H.
6.4. The Plaintiff in Attaint shall recover against all the Jurors, Tenants,
and Defendants, the costs and damages which he shall sustain (by delay
otherwise) in that suit. XIV. Stat. 15 H. 6.5. No Sheriff, Bailiff, or Coroner

freehold or inheritance (not ancient Demesne, within the five Ports, or
Gavel-kind) worth 20 l. per annum, and shall not return against them less
issues then 40 s. at the first Writ of distresses, 10 s. at the second, and
double afterward, in pain to forfeit 100 l. to the King, and as much to the
Plaintiff: And none but persons of that worth shall be impannelled upon
Attaints, if challenge thereof be made by the Plaintiffs. XV. If any of the
Defendants plead a foreign plea, and fail thereof, the Justices shall give
Judgment against them, as if the Grand Jury upon the Articles of the Writ had
passed against them: Howbeit the rest of the Defendants shall not be prejudiced
thereby: neither shall this Act extend to Cities or Boroughs. XVI. If there
shall not be in the County (under the degree of a Baron) enough of that worth
to fill the panel, then shall the said Officers impannel and return the most
sufficient persons there under that worth, upon the like pain. XVII. Stat. 18
H. 6.2. Owners of Inheritance or Freehold lands in Gavel-kind of 20 l. per
annum, may also be impannelled upon Attaints, notwithstanding the Statute of 15
H. 6.5. XVIII. Stat. 11 H. 7.21. None shall be impannelled upon a Jury in
London, except he have lands and tenements, or goods and chattels worth 40

Jurors defect herein is a principal challenge. XIX. The issues of the Jurors
for default of appearing shall be at the first summons 12 d. at the second 2 s.
and double afterward; and the issues lost in the Mayor's Court shall accrue to
the Mayor and Commonalty, and those lost in the Sheriff's Court, to the
Sheriffs. XX. An Attaint may be sued by Bill in the Hustings of London, upon
any false verdict given in any of the Courts of that City: And thereupon the
Mayor shall award a Precept to every Alderman to present (either by themselves
or their Deputies) unto the said Mayor at the next Hustings the names of four
indifferent and discreet Citizens out of each of their Wards, each of them
being worth in estate 100 pounds at least; out of which the Mayor and six
Aldermen, or more, shall impannel 48, whom the Mayor shall cause to be summoned
together with the Tenants or Defendants in the Attaint to appear at the next
Hustings: and if upon default of appearance or otherwise there shall need a
Tales, the panel shall be supplied out of the rest presented, or by other such
Citizens, at the discretion of the said Mayor and six Aldermen. XXI. Pleas of
Attaints commenced in London shall be tried there by Inquests of the same City,
and not elsewhere. XXII. In an Attaint there, no challenge shall lie for lack
of sufficiency in estate. XXIII. The Judgment in such an Attaint shall not
extend to lands or tenements, nor yet to other punishment of the petty Jury, or
other processes then such as are limited by this Act. XXIV. In such an Attaint,
if the petty Jury be attainted, Judgment shall be given against the Defendant,
as at the Common Law, and against the petty Jury; to forfeit each of them 20 l.
or more, at the discretion of the Court, to be employed as other penalties
forfeited before them, and to suffer six months imprisonment, or less, at the
like discretion of the Court, and to be for ever after disabled to be a Juror.
XXV. But if the verdict be affirmed, the Grand Jury shall-further inquire the
corruption of the petty Jurors, and if any of them be found to have taken any
reward, or promises thereof, he shall forfeit ten times the value thereof to
the Plaintiff, and shall further incurr imprisonment, and disability to be a
Juror, as aforesaid. The like forfeiture also and imprisonment shall be
inflicted upon the Tenant or Defendant that shall give such reward or promise;
but this last forfeiture shall accrue to the City, in manner aforesaid. XXVI.
If a debt, costs or damages are recovered in the first Action, (whereupon the
Attaint is brought) and that verdict found false, the Plaintiff in such Attaint
may sue for restitution of such debt, costs and damages by Writ, Bill, or
Plaint, in any of the King's Courts, wherein no wager of Law shall be admitted.
XXVII. In such an Attaint, if the Plaintiff be nonsuit, or the first verdict
affirmed, the Plaintiff shall be imprisoned, and make fine (to the use of the
City) at the discretion of the Court. XXVIII. Where there are one or more
Plaintiffs, if any of them die, or be nonsuit, and albeit all the Tenants or
Defendants and some of the petty Jury die, yet shall not the Attaint abate, so
that two of that Jury remain in life. XXIX. The Grand Jurors that make default
shall forfeit for the first, forty shillings, for the second, five pounds, and
for every other afterward, ten pounds. XXX. Such process shall be made against
the Jurors and parties in this Attaint as is usually made in Attaints at the
Common Law, and shall be returnable at every Hustings. XXXI. The Attaint shall
not remain to be taken after the first summons for the default of the Tenant or
Defendant, or any of the petty Jury; neither shall any essoign be allowed in
the same. XXXII. When the trial is to be per medietatem linguae, the Mayor and
Aldermen shall impannel half strangers, worth an hundred pound a piece. XXXIII.
Stat. 23 H. 8.3. Upon every untrue Verdict before Judges of Record (except
where the thing in demand extends not to the value of 40 l. or concerns
life) the party grieved shall have an Attaint against the petty Jury, and also
against the party that has the judgment thereupon. XXXIV. The Processes here
shall be summons, re-summons, and distress infinite, as well against the petty
Jury and party, as against the Grand Jury, who shall be of the accustomed
number, and have lands of the yearly value of 20 marks out of ancient demesne.
XXXV. The distress shall be awarded 15 days before the return thereof, and
shall be made upon the land of every one of the Grand Jury, as is used in other
distresses. XXXVI. Albeit the Defendant, or petty Jury, or some of them appear
not, yet the grand Jury shall proceed. XXXVII. If any of the petty Jury appear,
the Plaintiff shall assign the false serement, whereunto the petty Jury shall
have no other answer (if they be the same persons, and the Writ, Processes,
Return, and assignment be good) but that they made true serement, which shall
be tried by 24 of the Grand Jury; unless the Plaintiff has before been
nonsuit, or discontinued his suit, or had judgment against the same Jury for
the same Verdict. XXXVIII. Howbeit the Defendants may plead that they gave a
true verdict, or any other matter which may bar the Attaint: but
notwithstanding such plea, the Grand Jury shall nevertheless inquire whether
the first Jury gave a true verdict or no. XXXIX. If the petty Jury be found to
have given an untrue verdict, they shall each of them forfeit 20 l. to be
divided betwixt the King and the Plaintiff, and incurr several fines at the
discretion of the Justices, and be ever after disabled to give testimony in any
Court. XL. If the Defendant's plea in bar be found against him, the Plaintiff
shall have judgment to be restored to that he lost, with his reasonable costs
and damages. XLI. Outlawry or Excommunication shall be no plea against the
Plaintiff in Attaint; and in the aforesaid process such day shall be given as
in dower, but no essoign or protection allowed. XLII. If the Grand Jury appear
not, so that the petty Jurie's verdict remains untried, the defaulters shall
upon the first distress forfeit 20 s. upon the second 40 s. and upon every
default after 5 l. The like penalty is also to be inflicted upon the Tales.
XLIII. The Attaint is maintainable so long as any two of the petty Jury are
alive. XLIV. An Attaint shall also lie for a personal thing under the value of
40 l. in manner aforesaid; save only that in such case the Grand Juror is to
have lands worth 5 marks per annum, (out of ancient demesne) or to be worth 100
marks in goods; and the forfeiture of each petty Juror shall be but 5 l. XLV.
For want of sufficient Jurors in one County, a Tales shall be awarded into
another County at the discretion of the Justices. XLVI. An Attaint shall also
lie for him in reversion or remainder. And also in Attaint if the Plaintiff be
nonsuit, or discontinue the suit, he shall be fined at the discretion of the
Justices. XLVII. All Attaints shall be hereafter taken in the King's Bench or
Common Pleas, and not elsewhere; and Nisa prius shall be granted upon the
distress at the discretion of the Justices: also any of the petty Jury may
appear and answer by Attorney. XLVIII. As concerning the forfeitures, the
several moieties shall be recovered by the King and parties respectively by Ca.
sa. or Fi. fa. or Elegit, or Action of debt against each of the petty Jury,
their Executors or Administrators, having then sufficient goods of the
Testators not administered. XLIX. Judgment and Execution of restitution to the
Plaintiff, and of discharge of restitution to the Tenant or defendant, shall be
given and had, as in case of a grand Attaint has been used. L. The Nonsuit or
release of one Plaintiff shall not prejudice his companions. LI. In every writ
of attaint after the Test these words shall be inserted, Per statutum
continuatum usque annum 23 H. 8. Dei gratia, etc. LII. This act shall not be
prejudicial to the Statute of 11 H. 7.21. but every man for any untrue verdict
in London may bring an Attaint upon this or that, at his pleasure. LIII. Stat.
37 H. 8.5. Citizens of London being worth 400 marks in personal estate may be
impannelled and returned by the Sheriffs of London upon Attaints there, albeit
they have no real estates, notwithstanding the Statute of 23 H. 8.3. LIVE. The
Justices shall hereafter sit upon Attaints in London at Guildhall, or some
other convenient place in that City, and not elsewhere; neither shall the
Citizens there be compellable to appear upon any such Attaint in any other
place, notwithstanding the sa^d Statute of 23 H. 8.

his suit for him. II. West. 2. Cap. 10. 13 E 1. Any person may make a general
Attorney to sue in all Pleas, during the circuit of Justices in Eire: howbeit
that shall not excuse the party from being put upon Juries and Assizes before
the same Justices. III. Stat. 7 R. 2.14. They who shall depart the Realm with
the King's license, may before their departure have a Patent from the
Chancellor (with the advice of the Justices) inabling them to make general

prejudiced thereby. VI. As any die or cease, the Justices shall appoint others,
being virtuous, learned, and sworn, as aforesaid. VII. If an Attorney be found

be adjudged guilty of high Treason; and their receivers, aiders and maintainers
(knowing them to be such, and at liberty) shall be adjudged felons, without
benefit of Clergy. LIVE. All others brought up in Seminaries beyond Sea, and
not as yet in Orders, as aforesaid, which do not within six months after
Proclamation made in London (in that behalf) return into this Realm, and within

repairing to Church (according to the Stat. of 23 El. 1.) and which are
revocable by the offender, intended for his maintenance, left at his
disposition, or in consideration whereof he or his family are to be kept, shall
be utterly void against the Queen, as to hinder the levying of the forfeitures
for not coming to Church, or saying, hearing, or being at Mass, or the making
of seizures for the same purpose. LXIII. Every conviction of any offense before
mentioned shall be in the King's Bench, or at the Assize or Jail-deliver, and

20 l. a month, for so long time as they shall forbear to come to Church,
according to the said Stat. of 23 Eliz. 1. LXV. The indictment against such an
offender shall be sufficient, although no mention be therein made that the
party is within the Realm. LXVI. When an indictment is found against such an
offender, Proclamation shall be made, that he shall render himself into the
Sheriff's hands before the next Assize or Jail-deliver; which if he do not,
that neglect shall be as sufficient a conviction, as if upon the same
indictment a trial by verdict had proceeded. LXVII. But here upon the
offender's submission (according to the said Stat. of 23 El.) or death, no
forfeiture shall ensue, save only the arrearages due at the time of such
submission or death. LXVIII. The Lord Treasurer, Chancellor, and chief Baron,
or any two of them, shall assign a third part of the forfeitures of 20 l. a

themselves above a month from Church, without any lawful cause, impugned the
Queen's authority in causes Ecclesiastical, or frequented Conventicles, or
persuaded others so to do, under pretense of exercise of Religion, they shall
be committed to prison, and there remain until they shall conform themselves,
and make such open submission as hereafter shall be prescribed: And if within
three months after such conviction they refuse to conform and submit
themselves being thereunto required by a Justice of Peace, they shall in open
Assize or Sessions abjure the Realm; and if such abjuration happen to be before
Justices of Peace in Sessions, they shall make certificate thereof at the next
Assize or Jail-deliver. LXXI. If such an offender refuse to abjure, or going
away accordingly, does return without the Queen's license, he shall be adjudged
a felon, and shall not enjoy the benefit of Clergy; but if before he be
required to abjure he makes his submission, the penalties aforesaid shall not
be inflicted upon him. LXXII. The form of the Submission is as follows. I A.
B. do humbly confess and acknowledge, that I have grievously offended God, in
contemning her Majesty's godly and lawful government and authority, by
absenting my self from Church, and from hearing Divine Service, contrary to the
godly Statutes and Laws of this Realm, and in using and frequenting disordered
and unlawful Conventicles and Assemblies, under pretense of Exercise of
Religion; and I am heartily sorry for the same, and do acknowledge and testify
in my conscience, that no other person has or ought to have any power or
authority over her Majesty: And I do promise and protest, without any
dissimulation, that from henceforth I will from time to time obey and perform
her Majesty's Laws and Statutes, in repairing to the Church and hearing Divine
Service, and do my utmost endeavor to maintain and defend the same. LXXIII.
The Minister of the Parish where the submission is made shall presently enter

shall take no benefit thereby. LXXV. The forfeitures of this Act and of 23
Eliz. 1. may be recovered by action of debt. LXXVI. The third part of the

And if they have no certain abode, then are they to repair to the place where
they were born, or where their father or mother dwells; and within 20 days
after their arrival there, to give their names in writing to the Minister,
Constables and Headboroughs, which Minister is to enter them in a Book to be
kept for that purpose, and he, together with the said Constables and
Headboroughs, is to certify the same to the next Quarter-Session, where the
Justices of Peace shall cause them to be enrolled. LXXIX. A Copiholder shall in
this case also forfeit his estate, during life, (if his estate continue so
long) to the Lord of the Manor, if he be no Recusant convict, nor seized or
possessed in trust to the use of a Recusant; for then the Queen shall have the

or Coroner certified in at the next Assize or Jail-deliver. LXXXI. If such

restrain a Recusant (urged by process or summons without fraud) to travel

him that is compelled to render his body to the Sheriff. LXXXIV. If such an
offender before conviction, upon a Sunday or some Festival day, repair to
Church, and there hear Divine Service, and before the Gospel make the
Confession following, he shall be discharged of the penalties inflicted by this
Act. The Confession is this. LXXXV. I A. B. do humbly confess and acknowledge,
that I have grievously offended God, in contemning her Majesty's godly and
lawful government and authority, by absenting my self from Church, and from
hearing Divine Service, contrary to the godly Laws and Statutes of this Realm,
and I am heartily sorry for the same; and do acknowledge and testify in my
conscience, that the Bishop and See of Rome has not, nor ought to have, any
power or authority over her Majesty, within any of her Majesty's Realms or
Dominions: And I do promise, and proceed without dissimulation, that from
henceforth I will from time to time obey and perform her Majesty's Laws and
Statutes, in repairing to the Church, and hearing Divine Service, and do my
utter most endeavor to maintain and defend the same. LXXXVI. The Minister of

according to 23 El. 1. * XCIV. None shall send any child or other person under

every Parish, or one of them, or (if there be none such, then) the High
Constable of the Hundred there, shall present once every year at the general

and their children being above the age of nine years, and their servants,
together with the age of their children, as near as they can know them, in pain

the Exchequer, in such convenient certainty, that the Court may thereupon award

and leases, in case the 20 l. a month be not paid, as aforesaid. CV. The King
may refuse 20 l. a month, and take two third parts of his lands and leases;
but here he shall not include the Recusant's Mansion House, nor demise his two
parts to a Recusant, or to any other for a Recusant's use: And the King's

as by the Court of Exchequer shall be thought sufficient. CVI. It shall be
lawful for the Bishop of the Diocese, or two Justices of the Peace (1. Qu.) out

tendered unto them, the Bishop or Justice aforesaid shall bind them over to the
next Ass. or Sess. where if they again refuse it, they shall incur a
Praemunire, except women covert, who in that case shall only suffer
imprisonment till they take it. The Tenor of the Oath is as follows. CVIII. I
A. B. do truly and sincerely acknowledge, profess, testify and declare in my
conscience, before God and the world, that our Sovereign Lord King James is
lawful and rightful King of this Realm, and of all other his Majesty's
Dominions and Countries; and that the Pope, neither of himself, nor by any
authority of the Church or See of Rome, or by any other means, with any other,
has any power or authority to depose the King, or to dispose of any of his
Majesty's Kingdoms or Dominions, or to authorize any foreign Prince to invade or
annoy him or his Countries, or to discharge any of his Subjects of their
allegiance or obedience to his Majesty, or to give license or leave to any of
them to bear arms, raise tumults, or to offer any violence or hurt to his
Majesty's Royal person, state or government, or to any of his Majesty's
Subjects within his Majesty's Dominions.

Also I do swear from my heart, that notwithstanding any Declaration or
Sentence of Excommunication or Deprivation made or granted, or to be made or
granted, by the Pope or his successors, or by any authority derived or
pretended to be derived from him or his See, against the said King, his heirs
or successors, or any absolution of the said Subjects from their obedience, I
will bear faith and true allegiance to his Majesty, and him and them will
defend to the uttermost of my power, against all conspiracies and attempts
whatsoever, which shall be made against his or their persons, their Crown and
dignity, by reason or color of any such Sentence or Declaration, or otherwise;
and will do my best endeavor to disclose and make known unto his Majesty, his
heirs and successors, all treasons and traitorous conspiracies which I shall
know or hear of, to be against him or any of them.

And I do further swear, that I do from my heart abhor, detest and abjure, as
impious and heretical, this damnable Doctrine and Position, That Princes which
be excommunicated or deprived by the Pope may be deposed or murdered by their
Subjects, or any other whatsoever.

And I do believe, and in my conscience am resolved, That neither the Pope, nor
any person whatsoever, has power to absolve me of this Oath, or any part
thereof, which I acknowledge by good and full authority to be lawfully ministered
unto me, and do renounce all pardons and dispensations to the contrary.

And all these things I do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and swear,
according to the express words by me spoken, and according to the plain and
common sense and understanding of the same words, without any equivocation, or
mental evasion, or secret reservation whatsoever. And I do make this
recognition and acknowledgment heartily, willingly and truly, upon the true
faith of a Christian: So God me help.

full age, of good memory, and out of prison; and if a feme covert be one, she
must be examined by four of the said Justices, and if she consent not, the fine
cannot be levied. III. The reason of such solemnity in the taking of a fine,
is, because it bars all persons, of full age, out of prison, of good memoand
within the four Seas, the day of the fine levied, if they make not their claim
of their Action within a year and a day by the Country. IV. Stat. De finibus
levatis, 27 E. 1. Stat. 1. It shall be no good exception to a fine, that before

according to the former Ordinance. IX. Neither the Barons of the Exchequer, nor
the Justices shall admit any Attorneys save only in Pleas, that pass before

Common Bench by the Chirographer, shall be recorded in a Roll, to remain with

of Assize of the County where the land lies, to be there also proclaimed at
every Assize holden there that year, and then also all Pleas shall cease. XVI.

same County, to be in like sort proclaimed at their four Sessions holden that
year: and both the Justices of Assize and Peace shall make Certificate of such
Proclamation made, the second return of the term then next following. XVII. A
fine so proclaimed and certified shall conclude all persons, both Privies and
Strangers (except women covert other then such women as the parties to the
fine, persons under age, in prison, out of the Realm, or not of sound mind) if
they pusue not their right, title, claim, or interest by way of action or
lawful entry within five years after the proclamation so made and certified, as
aforesaid. XVIII. The right of Strangers, which happens to come unto them after
the fine is engrossed, is saved; so that they lawfully pursue their right or
title within five years after it so comes to them, and here, an Action against
the pernor of the profits is maintainable. XIX. If the parties to whom such
right or title comes, be covert, under Age, in prison, out of the Land, or not

persons under age, in prison, out of the Realm, or of non-sane memory, being
not parties to the fine. XXIII. The right and interest, that any person or
persons (other then parties) has or have at the time of the fine engrossed, is
saved, so that they or their heirs pursue such their right or interest by
action or lawful entry within 5 years after the Proclamations so made: so also
is the right and interest saved, which accrues after the engrossing of the
fine, so that the parties having the same pursue it within 5 years after it so
accrues, and in this case the Action may be brought against the Pernor of the
prosits. XIV. If at the time of the fine engrossed, or of such accruer, as
aforesaid, the persons be covert (and no parties to the fine) under age, in
prison out of the Realm, or of non sane memory, they or their heirs have time
to pursue their Actions within 5 years after such imperfection removed. XXV.
The exception, that none of the parties nor any to their use had any thing in
the lands at the time of the fine levied, is saved to all persons, except
parties and privies. XXVI. Fines at the Common law have the same force they had

any persons accrued by reason of any fine levied by a woman, after her husbands
death, contrary to the Statute of 11 H. 7.20. XXIX. A fine levied by him, who

notwithstanding this Act. XXX. This Act shall not extend to any fine heretofore
levied of lands now in suit, or heretofore lawfully recovered in any Court by

fine levied being in the King. XXXI. Stat. 37 H. 8.19. Fines levied before the

lying within that County Palatine, viz. upon three several days in the Sessions

Sessions then next following, shall be of like force as fines acknowledged
before the Justices of the Common Pleas. XXXII. Stat. 2. 3 E. 6.28. This
Statute ordains all fines of lands within the County Palatine of Chester to be

Recognisance and Statute-Merchant.
I. Acton Burnel, 11 E. 1. The Merchant that will be sure of his debt, shall
cause his debtor to come before the Mayor of London, York, or Bristol, or
before the Mayor and Clerk (which the King will appoint) to acknowledge the debt
and the day of payment; which recognisance shall be entered into a Roll with the
hand of the said Clerk. II. The Clerk shall make with his own hand a Bill
Obligatory, whereunto the seal of the Debtor shall be put together within the
Kings Seal, to be appointed for that purpose; which Seal shall remain in
keeping of the said Mayor and Clerk. III. If the Debtor fail at the day, upon
notice thereof to the Mayor and Clerk, they shall cause his chattels, and
divisible Burgages to be sold, as far as the Debt does amount, by appraisement
of honest men, and the money without delay shall be paid to the Creditor; and
in case they cannot sell them, they shall cause so much of the movables to be
delivered unto him as amount to the Debt, and the Kings Seal shall be put unto
the sale and deliverance of the Burgages. IV. If the Debtor have no movables
within the Mayors jurisdiction, then shall the Mayor send the Recognisance unto
the Chancellor under the Kings Seal, and the Chancellor shall thereupon direct
a Writ to the Sheriff, in whose Bailiwick the movables of the Debtor be, who
shall proceed therein, as the Mayor might have done, if the said movables had
been in his power. V. If the Appraisors set too high a value upon the things
that are to be sold, they shall be compellable to take them at the same price,
and shall forthwith be answerable to the Creditor for his Debt: And albeit the
moveable goods are sold for less than they are worth, yet is the Debt without
remedy; and it shall be imputed to his own folly, that he would not sell them
himself, when he might. VI. If the Debtor have no movables, whereupon the debt
may be levied, he shall be imprisoned, and there remain until he agree with
the Creditor; and if he be in want, the Creditor shall find him bread and
water, which the prisoner shall also satisfy before he be enlarged: a
Merchant-stranger shall also be satisfied for his stay about the said business.
VII. If the Debtor have sureties, they shall be bound and proceeded against in
like form, as is before declared against the Debtor; Howbeit, so long as the
Debt may be levied of the goods moveable of the Debtor, his pledges or
main-pernors shall be without damage. VIII. Stat. De Mercatoribus, 13 E. 1. The
Merchant shall cause his Debtor to come before the Mayor of London, or before
some chief Warden of a City, or other good Town, where the King shall appoint,
and before the Mayor or chief Warden or other discreet men chosen and sworn
thereto, when the Mayor or chief Warden cannot attend, and before one of the
Clerks, that the King shall thereto assign when both cannot attend, and to
acknowledge the Debt and Day of payment, which recognisance shall be enrolled by
one of the said Clerks hands, being known, and the Roll shall be double;
whereof one part shall remain with the Mayor, or chief Warden, and the other
with the said Clerk. IX. Then one of the Clerks shall write an Obligation,
whereunto the Seal of the Debtor shall be put together with the Kings Seal
provided for that purpose; which Seal shall have two pieces, whereof one part
shall remain with the Mayor or chief Warden, and the other with the aforesaid
Clerk. X. If the debt be not paid at the day, upon the Merchants account, the
Mayor or chief Warden shall cause the Debtor to be imprisoned (if he be Lay,
and in their power) there to remain at his own costs, until he have agreed the
debt; And the Keeper of the Prison there shall receive him, in pain to answer
the debt himself, or (if he be not able) he that committed the Prison to his
keeping. XI. If the Debtor connot be found by the Mayor, or chief Warden, they
shall send the Recognisance under the Kings Seal into the Chancery, from whence
shall issue a Writ to the Sheriff of the County, where the Debtor is, to take
his body (if he be Lay) and safely to keep him in prison, until he agree the
debt; And within a quarter of a year after he is so taken, his goods and lands
shall be delivered unto him, to the end he may pay the debt, within which time
the sale of his lands shall be good. XII. If he do not satisfy the debt within
that quarter, all his lands and goods shall be delivered to the Merchants, by a
reasonable extent, to hold them, until the debt be wholly levied,
nevertheless, his body shall still remain in Prison, and the Merchant shall
find him bread and water. XIII. The Merchant or his assigns shall have such
Seisin in the said lands, that he may maintain a Writ of Novel Disseisin, if he
be put out, and a re-disseisin also, as of a freehold to him and his assigns,
until the debt be paid; but when the debt is levied, the body of the Debtor
shall be delivered, together with his lands. XIV. In the Writ awarded by the
Chancellor, the Sheriff shall be directed to certify the Justices of one of
the Benches at a certain day, how he has performed the service, and then the
Merchant shall sue before the said Justices, if he be not satisfied. XV. If the
Sheriff make no return of the Writ, or return a tardt, or that he has directed
to the Bailiff of some Franchise, the Justice shall proceed according to the
Statute of Westminster, 2. Chap. 39. which see in return of Sheriffs and
Bailiffs. XVI. If the Sheriff return a Non est inventus, or that he is a Clerk,
the Merchant shall have Writs to all the Sheriffs, where he has any land, that
they shall deliver him all the goods and lands of the Debtor, by a reasonable
extent, to hold to him and his assigns in form aforesaid; nevertheless, he may
also have a Writ to what Sheriff he will, to take his body (if he be Lay) and
to detain him in manner aforesaid, and then the Keeper must answer the body, or
the debt; but yet the Debtor may sell the lands so the Merchant be not
damnified by the appraisement. XVII. Here, the Merchant shall be always allowed
their damages, and all necessary and reasonable costs for their labors, suits,
delays, and expenses. XVIII. If the Debtor have sureties, the like course shall
be taken against them, as is above limited to be taken against the principal
Debtor. XIX. All the lands in the hands of the Debtor at the time of the
Recognisance acknowledged are chargeable, in whose hands soever they come
afterward; but after the debt satissied, they shall return to the Grantees, as
also the rest to the debtor. XX. If the debtor or his sureties die, he Merchant
shall not take the body of his heir, but shall have his lands, as aforesaid, if
he be of age, or at his full age, until he has levied his debr. XXI. There
shall be also another Seal provided, that shall serve for Fairs, and shall be
sent to every Fair under the Kings Seal by a Clerk sworn, or by a keeper of the
Fair. XXII. Of the Communalty of London, there shall betwo Merchants chosen and
sworn, and the Seal shall be opened before them, whereof one piece shall be
delivered to the said Merchants, and the other shall remain with the Clerk.
XXIII. Before these Merchants, or one of them, the Recognisances shall be
taken, and before they be enrolled, the pain of the Statute shall be openly
read before the Debtor, that he may not afterward excuse himself by ignorance
of the said pain. XXIV. For the Clerks maintenance, the King shall take a penny
for every pound, where the Seal is, except in Fairs, and there penny half penny.
XXV. This Act shall be from henceforth observed throughout England and Ireland,
between any that will make Recognisances, except Jews, to whom it dothnot
extend. XXVI. By this Statute, the Writ of Debt shall not be abated, neither
shall the Chancellor, Justice of either Bench, or Justices Errants be hereby
estopped to take recognisances of debts before them acknowledged, and to issue
execution thereupon, as has heretofore been used. XXVII. Breve fundatum super

any delay whatsoever of either side: And therefore here days of grace shall be
given by the discretion of the Judges between the demandant and the party so
received, and not the common day in plea of land, unless the demandant will

must plead to two adversaries. V. Howbeit they in the reversion, who so pray to
be received, shall find sureties for the issues, of the tenements demanded for

and obedience, in such cases the Escheat pertains to every Lord of his own Fee.

offender, as if such Treason had been found to have been committed within the
Realm: Also all Process of Outlawry within the Realm against such offender

the time of the Process awarded, and such Outlawry pronounced. VIII. Every such
offender, being lawfully convict by presentment, confession, verdict, or
process of Outlawry, shall forfeit to the King all such Lands, Tenements, and

conditions, possessions, reversions, remainders, and all other things of such
offender, and shall be as well adjudged in actual and real possession of all
such things of the offender, which the King ought lawfully to have or which the
offender ought or might lawfully lose or forfeit, as if he had been attainted
by the Parliament, without any Office or Inquisition to be found of the same.
XII. The right, etc. of all others (except of the offenders, etc.) is saved.

and made against the offender, as if such Treason had been found to have been

and wounds, a man shall have his Writ, as before has been used. IV. The
Defendants in such pleas, may make their Attorneys, where Appeal lies not; so
that if they be attainted of Trespass, being absent, the Sheriffs shall be
commanded to take them, and they shall incur like pain, as they should have
had, if they had been present at the Judgment given. V. If the Plaintiffs in
such Trespasses cause themselves to be Essoined after the first appearance, day
shall be given them, till the coming of the Justices, and the Defendants in the
mean time, shall be in peace. VI. In such pleas and others, where attachments
and distresses do lie, if the Defendant Essoin himself of the Kings service,
and do not bring his warrant at the day given by the Essoin, he shall
recompense the Plaintiffs damages for his Journey, 20 s. or more, at the
discretion of the Justices, and besides shall be grievously amerced to the
King. VII. Stat. 43 El. 7. If any shall be convicted by his own confession, or

such time, as by the said Justice, or Head-Officer, shall be appointed: And in
case the party offending, shall not by the said Justice or Officer, be thought
able to discharge the said damages, or shall not discharge them according to
the Order, then shall the said offender be by them, or either of them
(respectively) committed to the Constable, or other Officer of the place where

or other inferior Officer that herein refuses or neglects to do his duty,
shall by any such Justice of Peace or Head-Officer, be committed to Prison

Trial.
I. Stat. 9 E. 3. Stat. 1. cap. 4. Whereas many be delayed in their Actions,
for that the Tenants or Defendants plead in Bar a release, quit-claim, or
other special Deed, made within a Franchise, where the Kings Writ runs not;
It is enacted, That when such Deeds are showed forth in Bar of an Action, and
bear date within a Franchise; Albeit the witnesses named in the Deed be of the
Franchise, yet if the Deed be denied, Process shall be awarded in the Court
where the Plea depends, to cause the Country and the witnesses to appear; and
if the witnesses come not at the great distresses returned, notwithstanding
such absence of the witnesses, the Justices shall not let to proceed to the
taking of the Enquest, as well as if such Deed did bear date within the County,
where the Plea was moved, and that the witnesses were of the same County. II.
Stat. 8 H. 6.29. The Statute of 28 E. 3.13. (which see in Staple) ordering that
an Enquest shall be, De medietate linguae, where an Alien is party, is
confirmed: And it is by this Act further declared, that the Statute of 2 H.
5.3. ( which see in Jurors) does only extend to Enquests taken between Denizen
and Denizen; so that an Alien may be put upon Enquests according to the Statute
of 28 E. 3. albeit he have not lands of the yearly value of 40 s. III. Stat. 20
H. 6.9. Trial of Dutchesses, Countesses, and Baronesses, for Treason or Felony,
shall be as of Noblemen, Peers of the Realm, and not otherwise,
notwithstanding the Statute of Magna Carta, cap. 9. which mentions men only
to be tried by their Peers. See that Chapter of Mag. Cart. in Accusation. IV.
Stat. 4 H. 8.2. Pars inde. Where a Murderer or Felon (to delay his arraignment)
pleads that he was taken out of a privileged place, in a foreign County; and
if it be alleged by the Kings Attorney (or some other in the Kings behalf)
that he was taken in the County, where he is so to be arraigned, they shall be
tried by the Enquest, who are to try the Murder or Felony, and before the same
Justice; and if it be found, that he was taken in the same County, such
foreign plea shall do him no advantage or benefit. V. Stat. 27 H. 8.4. Murders
and Robberies committed by Pirates upon the Sea, or in any other place, where
the Admiral pretends jurisdiction, shall be inquired into, tried, heard, and
determined in such Counties and places within the Realm, as shall be limited by
the Kings Commission, in like manner, as if such offenses were done at Land.
And such Commissions (being under the Great Seal) shall be directed to the Lord
Admiral, his Lieutenant, or Deputy, and to three or four such others, as the
Lord Chancellor shall name. VI. The said Commissioners, or three of them, have
power to inquire of such offenses, by twelve lawful men of the County so
limited in their Commission, as if such offenses were done at Land within the
same County, and every Indictment so found and presented, shall be good in Law;
And such Order, Process, Judgment, and Execution, shall be used, had, done, and
made thereupon, as against offenders for Murder, or Felony done at Land: Also
the trial of such offenses (if they be denied) shall be had by twelve men of
the County, limited in the said Commission (as aforesaid) and no challenge
shall be had for the Hundred: And such as shall be convict of such offenses,
shall suffer death without benefit of Clergy, and forfeit lands and goods, as
in case of Felonies and Murders done at land. VII. This Act shall not prejudice
any person or persons (urged by necessity for taking Victuals, Cables, Ropes,
Anchors, or Sails out of another Ship, that may spare them, so as they either
pay ready money, or money-worth for them, or give a Bill for the payment
thereof, viz. if they be taken on this side the Straits of Moro^ke, within four
months; but if beyond, within twelve months. VIII. When any such Commission
shall be sent to any place within the Jurisdiction of the Cinque Ports, it
shall be directed to the Warden of the said Ports, or his Deputy, with three or
four such other persons, as the Lord Chanceller shall name: And the Inquisition
and Trial of such offenses there shall be made and had by the Inhabitants of
the said Ports, and the members of the same. IX. Stat 28 H. 8.15. This Act is
verbatim the same with 27 H. 8.4. save only that it extends as well to Treasons
and all other capital offenses committed within the Admiral's Jurisdiction, as
unto Felonies, Robberies, and Murders there done. X. Stat. 33 H. 8.12. The
manner of the Trial, and punishment of Murder and Bloodshed within the Kings
Court. See the Statute at large. XI. Stat. 33 H. 8.23. If any person, being
examined before the Kings Council, or any three of them, upon any Treason,
misprision of treason, or murder, does confess the same, or by the said Council
is vehemently suspected to be guilty thereof, in this case the King shall
direct Commission of O^^r and Terminer to such persons, and into such County or
place as he pleases, for the speedy trial, conviction, or deliverance of such
offenders; And here, no challenge for the County or Hundred shall be allowed,
but a Juror may be challenged, if he have not Freehold worth 40 s. per annum;
in this case also trial of a Peer shall be by his Peers. XII. Stat. 2, 3. E.
6.24. Where any is feloniously stricken or poisoned in one County, and dies of
such stroke or poisoning in another County, an Indictment thereof found by
Jurors of the County where he dies, shall be as good in Law, as if the stroke
or poisoning had been done in the County where the party so dies: And Justices
of Jail-delivery, and Oyer and Terminer in the County where such Indictment is
taken, as also the Justices of the Kings Bench, before whom such Indictment is
removed, may proceed thereupon in all points, as if such stroke or poisoning,
and death, had all happened in one and the same County. XIII. Also an Appeal
may be commenced, taken, and sued in the County where the party so stricken, or
poisoned shall dye, as well against the principal as accessory, in whatsoever
County such accessory be guilty thereof; And the Justices before whom such
Appeal is prosecuted (within the year and day after the offense committed)
shall proceed against every such accessory in the County, where such appeal is
so taken in like manner, as if the offense of such accessory had been committed
in the same County, as well concerning trial by Jurors, upon the offenders plea
of not guilty, as otherwise. XIV. Where any Murder or Felony is committed in
one County, and more persons be accessory thereunto in another County, an
Indictment found and taken against such accessory before Justices of Peace, or
other Commissioners in the County where such person is accessory, shall be as
good in Law, as if the principal offense had been committed in the same County.
XV. The Justices of Jail-delivery, or Oyer and Terminer, (or two of them) of
the County where the party so became accessory, shall (upon request) write unto
the Custos Rotulorum, where the principal shall be attainted or convicted, to
certify them whether the principal shall be attainted, convicted, or otherwise
discharged; and then the Justices of Jail-delivery, Oyer and Terminer, or
others authorized, shall proceed upon every such accessory in like manner, as
if both the principal offense, and accessory had been committed in the County
where the party so became accessory: and thereupon every such accessory shall
answer upon his arraignment, and receive such trial, judgment, and execution,
and suffer pains and forfeitures, as are used in other ^ases of Felony.

other, at a reasonable rate, without fine; but if they will not take them, then
shall the said Chancellor and Treasurer cause them to be preserved by the said
Escheators, or others, and the reasonable profits thereof to be answered to the
King. III. Stat. pro Clero, 5. 14 E. 3. This Chapter is also for demising them
to the Dean and Chapter, or Prior and Convent, at as reasonable rate, and
without fine, as before, and that the Escheator or other Minister shall not
enter or molest them.
Vagabonds, Rogues, Beggars, and Poor People.
* I. Stat. 39 El. 4. Justices of Peace within every County and Corporation,
have power in Sessions to give order for erection of Houses of Correction, and

Beggars. III. If any such Vagabond shall be taken begging, wandering, or
misordering him or her self, he or she, by the appointment of any Justice of
Peace, Constable, Headborough, or Tithing-man there, (the two last being
assisted by the Minister, and one other of the Parish) shall be stripped naked
from the middle upwards, openly whipped, till their body be bloody, and
forthwith sent the next way from Parish to Parish, by the Officers of each
Parish, toward the place of their birth: But if it cannot be known, then
toward the place where they last dwelt, by the space of one whole year before
such punishment; and if that cannot be known, then to the Town through which
they last passed without punishment; and if it cannot be discovered where they
were born, or last dwelt, as aforesaid, then are they to be conveyed by the
Officer there, to the house of Correction, or common Goal of the County, to be
employed in work, or placed in some service, and so to continue by the space of
one year; or in case they be not able in body, that Town is to keep them, till
they may be placed in some Almshouse within the same County. IV. After which
whipping, the Vagabond shall have a Testimonial under the hand and seal of the
said Justice, Constable, Head-officer, Tything-man, and Minister, or any two of
them, testifying the day and place of his punishment, the place to which he is
to be conveyed, and the time limited for his passage thither; which time, if by
his own default he exceeds, he shall from time to time incur the like
punishment, till he arrive at the place limited; the substance of which
Testimonial, shall be registered by the said Minister in a Book provided for
that purpose, in pain of 5 s. V. If any such Rogue seem dangerous, or will not
be reformed, two Justices of Peace, (one of Quorum) shall commit him to the
house of Correction; and if at the next Quarter Sessions by the more part of
the Justices there, he shall not be thought fit to be delivered, he shall by
them be banished; and at the charge of that County, shall be conveyed to such
parts beyond the Seas, as shall by six, or more of the Privy Council for that
purpose be assigned, whereof the Lord Keeper or Treasurer to be one; or
otherwise adjudged to the Galleys of the Realm, as the said Justices shall
think fit: And if a Rogue so banished return without license, he shall suffer

Constable, Headborough, or Tything-man, be found negligent in the due execution

l. and to be bound to the good behavior. VII. None shall transport such a
Rogue out of Ireland, Scotland, or the Isle of Man, (being born in any of these
places) in pain to forfeit 20 s. to the use of the poor where he lands: And if

licensed to pass by two Justices of Peace where they dwell, and provided with
relief, both for their journey and abode there, and shall also return within
the time limited by their license, in pain to be reputed and punished as
Rogues: and the City of Bath or Town of Buxton shall not be chargeable with any
such. IX. Justices of Peace of the Counties, shall not intermeddle in Cities or
Corporations, but only the Officers of the same, who shall have like power
there, as the said Justices have in Counties. X. This Act shall not extend to
restrain the power which the City of London has in the Government of Saint
Thomas Hospital in Southwark, or to prejudice any jurisdiction or inheritance
of John Dutton of Dutton, in the County of Chester Esquire. XI. The forfeitures
and fines which shall accrue by this Act (other then that above otherwise
limited) shall be employed for the maintenance of houses of Correction, or the
relief of the poor where the offense shall be committed, at the discretion of
the said Justices of Peace, and may be levied by warrant under the hands and
seals of two Justices of Peace, by distress and sale of goods: And here the
confession of the offender, or proof by two witnesses before two such Justices
shall be sufficient conviction. XII. Two Justices of Peace, (one of Quorum)
shall have full power to hear and determine all causes which may come in
question by reason of this Act. XIII. The Lord Chancellor or Keeper for the
time being, shall have power to make Commissioners to enquire of money given

or other such like uses. XIV. A Seafaring-man suffering shipwreck, not having
wherewithal to relieve himself, and having a Testimonial under some Justice of
Peace his hand and seal, near the place where he landed, declaring the time and
place of his landing, the place of his dwelling or birth, unto which he is to
pass, and the time limited for his passage, may in the direct way home, and
within the time so limited for his passage, ask and receive necessary relief,
without incuring the penalties of this Act. XV. This Act shall not extend to
children under seven years old, nor to glass-men, which travel without begging,
by licenses under the hands and seals of three Justices of Peace, (one Quorum)
of the County through which they travel. XVI. Stat. 39 El. 17. Wandering
Soldiers and Mariners, and all others, wandering as Soldiers or Mariners,
which will not settle themselves to work, or have not a Testimonial under the
hand of some one Justice of Peace near the place of their landing, setting down
the place where they landed, the place whither they are to pass, and the time
of their passage, or having a Testimonial, exceed the time therein limited,
above fourteen days, or counterfeit Testimonial, or produce one which they know
to be counterfeit, shall in all these cases, suffer as Felons, without benefit
of Clergy. XVII. Justice of Assize, Jail-delivery, and of Peace, in their
Sessions, have power to proceed against these offenders, as in case of Felony
without Clergy, unless some sufficient man (allowed by the Justices) will enter
into Recognisance of 10 l. to the Queen, to retain the offender for one whole
year, and to bring him to the next Sessions of Peace and Jail-delivery after
the year ended. And if he within the year depart that service without license,
he shall afterward suffer as a Felon without Clergy. XVIII. Soldiers and
Mariners, which fall sick in their passage home, shall be excused, though they
exceed the time limited in their Testimonial, so that they perform this Act in
convenient time after their recovery. XIX. If, when they come home, they cannot
get work, the two next Justices (upon their complaint) shall take order, that
they may be provided of work, or otherwise shall tax the whole Hundred for
their relief, until work may be had. XX. The Soldier or Mariner (licensed by
a Justice of Peace to whom he shall make his poverty known) having not
wherewith to bear his charges home, may ask and take relief, so it be in his
direct way home, and within the time limited by his license. XXI. These
offenses shall cause no corruption of blood. XXII. Stat. 1 Jac. 7. Noble
Personages shall authorize none to go wandering abroad; and Glass-men shall be
reputed and used as Rogues, notwithstanding the Statute of 39 El. 4. XXIII.
Instead of banishing an incorrigible Rogue, or committing him to the Galleys
(as was ordained by 34 El. 4.) he shall in open Sessions be branded in the left
shoulder with a burning iron, having a great Roman R. upon it as broad as a
shilling: And from thence shall be sent to the place of his last dwelling; if
that cannot be known) to the place of his birth: After which time if he offend
again, he shall suffer as a Felon, without benefit of Clergy. XXIV. Every
person that sees or knows any Rogue to beg, shall convey or cause him to be
conveyed to the next Constable or Tything-man, in pain of 18 s. to be levied
and employed as the forfeitures of 39 El. 4. and in default thereof, then by
the Lord of the Leet, or his officer, in like manner as the persons authorized
by the said Statute should have levied and employed the same. And here also if
the Constable or Tything-man do not punish him according to that Statute, he
shall forfeit 20 s. to be also levied and employed, as by the same Statute is
appointed. XXV. This Act shall not prejudice the jurisdiction or inheritance of
John Dutton of Dutton in the County of Chester Esquire. XXVI. Stat. 7 Jac. 4.
There shall be an house of Correction provided in every Shire to set Rogues and
other idle people to work. XXVII. The Justices in Sessions shall from time to
time appoint a Governor for the said house, who shall have power to set such
Rogues and idle people to work, and to punish them by moderate whipping or
putting fetters or gives on them; which rogues and idle persons shall not be
chargeable to the Country, nor have other allowance than what they shall
deserve by their own labor. XXVIII. The said Justices shall at least twice
every year within their several divisions (and oftener if need be) assemble and
meet together for the better execution of this Statute, and some four or five
days before their meeting, shall by warrant command the Constables and
Tything-men of every Hundred, Town, and Hamlet, (being assisted with other
sufficient men) to make a general privy search in one night within their

charge to make escape, or to be troublesome to the Country by going abroad, or
otherwise, they shall incur what fine the same Justices in Sessions shall think

Jurisdiction: Howbeit, as to the transportation of Corn, this Statute has
since been diverse times altered by sundry subsequent Acts, viz. 13 El. 1 Jac.
25. and 21 Jac. 28. and last of all, by 3 Car. 4. which see in Corn, and so it
stands at this day. XXIII. Stat. 21 Jac. 21. The Statute of 32 H. 8.41.

View.
I. West. 2.48. 13 E. 1. View of Land shall not be granted, but where it is
necessary: for example, if one lose land by default, and afterward moves for
a Writ to demand the same Land; or when one by an exception dilatory abateth a
Writ after view had, as by non-tenure, misnaming of the Town, or the like; In
these cases, upon purchase of another Writ, view shall not be granted, if he
had view in the first Writ: so in a Writ of Dower, when the Dower in demand is
of Land, which the husband aliened to the Tenant, or his Ancestors, whereof the
Tenant ought not to be ignorant: Here, albeit the husband dyed not seized, yet
view shall not be granted to the tenant: Also in a writ of entry, which abated,
because the Demandant misnamed the entry; here, if the demandant purchase
another Writ of Entry, the tenant having had view in the first Writ shall not
have it in the second: Likewise, in all Writs, where Lands are demanded by
reason of a Lease made by the demandant or his ancestor to the tenant himself,
being within age, non compos mentis, in prison, or the like, view shall not be
granted, but if the demise were made to his ancestor, view shall lie, as has
been heretofore used. II. Stat. De visu terrae, and Essoin de servitio Domini
Regis 12. E. 2. View shall be granted in a writ of ward, of customs and
services, of Advowson of a Church ( viz. when there be more Churches then one

Villenage.
I. The Statute of Purveyors, cap. 18. 25 E. 3. Notwithstanding adjournment
made in Air, by writ, de liberate probanda, purchased in favor of Villeins
to delay their Lords in their Actions for such Villeins, the Lord may in all
Writs plead the exception of Villenage against them, whether such Writ were
purchased by deceit, or otherwise: The Lords also may seize their bodies, as
well as they might have done before such Writs de liberate probanda purchased.
II. Stat. 38 E. 3.17. No Writ shall be abated by exception of Cognizance of
Villenage, if the Demandant or Plaintiff will aver, that the party alleging
the exception was free the day of the Writ purchased. III. Stat. 9 R. 2.2.
Because diverse Villeins and Neifs did fly to London, and other enfranchised
places, and there did feign diverse suits against their Lords, with intent to
make themselves free by their Lords answers, it was ordained, that from
henceforth no Lord should be barred of his Villein because of his answer in
Law.

just right, title, and interest to the Patronages thereof, being of full age:
And all such Union and Consolidation shall remain as good in Law, as if it had
been so declared by writing under the seals of such Ordinary, Incumbents, and
Patrons. II. All such Unions heretofore made, are confirmed: Howbeit, the Kings
tenths and First Fruits of such Churches and Chapels already, or hereafter to
be so consolidated, are saved. III. Such consolidations shall not be in
Corporate Towns without the consent of the Magistrates thereof, declared in
writing under their Common Seal. IV. Provided, that where the Inhabitants of
any such Parish, or the more part of them, within a year after such Union, by
their writing sufficient in Law, shall assure the Incumbent there and his
successors so much money yearly, which together with the value thereof in the
Kings books shall amount to 8 l. that then such union shall be void: Howbeit,
this proviso shall not extend to any such Union made before this Statute. V.
Stat. 1 E. 6.9. An Act for uniting certain Churches in York, with diverse
clauses concerning that matter. VI. Stat. 1 M. Parl. 1.14. An Act for

and two Justices. IV. This Act shall be suspended during the Queens presence,
her Heirs and Successors, or within seven miles distance therefrom. V. The
Liberties of the Mayors, Bailiffs, and Communalties of Oxford and Cambridg are

or other Minister of the Queen, her heirs and successors, shall take or Bargain
for any grain or other victual in either of the said Universities, nor within
the compass of five miles from either of them, without license of either of the
said Chancellors or Vice-Chancellors, in writing under the seal of their
Office, and not otherwise then as in the said license is expressed, and so as
the same give unto them no further power then they may lawfully use in other
parts of the Country without the said five miles: neither shall they take away
or bargain for any such commodity bought and provided for any College or Hall
to be spent within the same without such license, as aforesaid, upon such pains
and forfeitures, as by the Statute of 2, 3 P. M. 15. are ordained, and to like
uses as are therein limited. VII. The said Chancellors or Vice-Chancellors,
with two Justices of Peace of the Universities, City, Town, or County, shall
inquire, hear and determine the said offenses, as by the Statute of 2.3. P. M.
is appointed. VIII. If any person within the said five miles, refuse to serve
the Universities, then it shall be lawful for the Queens Purveyors to provide
for the Queens use, any corn or victual of any such person within the said five
miles, as shall be declared to the said Purveyors, to be persons not worthy of
the said privilege, for not serving the Universities, by the Chancellor or
Vice Chancellor, with the consent of two such Justices as aforesaid, under the
hands and seals of the said Chancellor, or Vice Chancellor, and two Justices,
in such sort as the said Purveyors lawfully may in any other place without the
said five miles, and not otherwise. IX. This Act shall be in suspense, during
the Queens presence there, or within seven miles distance. X. The Liberties of
the Majors, Bailiffs, and Communalties of Oxford and Cambridge are saved.
Voucher.
I. Marlbr. 29. 52 H. 3. None vouched to Warranty before Justices in Air, in
plea of land, shall be amerced, because he was not present, when he was
vouched, except it be the first day of the coming of the Justices; but if the
party be within the County, the Sheriff shall cause him to come in within three
or four days; and if out of the County, he shall have summons of 15 days at
least. II. West. 1.39. 3. E. 1. In Writs of Possession, as Mortdancester,
Cosinage, Ayel, nuper obiit, intrusion, or the like, whereby land is demanded,
which ought to descend, revert, remain, or Escheat by the death of any
Ancestor, or otherwise, if the tenant vouch to Warranty, and the demandant will
counter-plead him, and aver, by assize or by the Country, as the Court shall
award, that the tenant or his Ancestor (whose heir he is) was the first that
entered after the death of him, of whose seisin he demands, this averment
shall be received, if the tenant will abide thereupon; but if not, he shall be
compelled to another answer, unless he have his Warrantor present, who will
immediately enter into the Warranty: And then also, the demandant may have the
like exception against the Vouchee, as he had against ^he first tenant. III. In
a Writ of Entry in the degrees none shall vouch out of the line. IV. In Writs
of right and of possession (as before) it is also a good counter-plea, that
neither the Vouchee nor his Ancestors had ever seisin of the land, or any thing
in the services by the hand of the tenant or his ancestors, from the time of
the seisin, whereof the demandant declares, until the Writ purchased, so that
he might a feofment make to the tenant or his ancestors; and this averment of
the demandant shall be also received, if the tenant will abide thereupon; but
if not, the tenant shall be compelled to another, as before, unless the Vouchee
be present, and will immediately enter into Warranty, and then also the
demandant may have like exception as before. V. If the Tenant have a deed, that
comprised Warranty of another man, his recovery by a Writ de Warrantia carta,
out of the Chancery shall be saved to him: howbeit the plea shall not be
delayed by reason thereof. VI. The Stat. of Gloucester 12. 6. E. 1. If a man
impleaded for a tenement in London, vouch a foreigner to Warranty, he shall
have a Writ out of the Chancery, to summon the Warrantor at a certain day
before the Justices of the Bench, and another to the Mayor and Bailiffs of
London, to surcease the matter before them, until the plea of the Warranty be
determined in the Bench, and when the plea at the Bench shall be determined,
then shall the Vouchee be commanded to go into the City to answer the chief
plea, and a Writ shall also be awarded at the Demandants suit by the Justices
to the Mayor and Bailiffs, to cause them to proceed in the plea: And if the
Demandant recover against the tenant, the tenant shall come before the Justices
of the Bench, who shall direct a Writ to the Mayor and Bailiffs, to cause the
land so lost by the tenant to be extended and valued, and to return that extent
at a certain day unto the Bench, and after the Sheriff of the County (where the
Warranty was summoned) shall be commanded to deliver to the Voucher land of the
Vouchee answerable in value to the land that the Voucher has lost: See a
correction and some enlargement of this Statute, 9 E. 1. VII. West. 1.6. 13. E.
1. As the tenant shall lose the land in demand, in case where his Vouchee
discharges himself of the Warranty, so also shall the Vouchee lose, where he
denies the Warranty, and it be tried against him: Also, where an Enquest is
depending between the tenant and his Vouchee, and the Demandant will require a
Writ to cause the Jury to come, it shall be granted him. VIII. The Statute of
Vouchers, 20 E. 1. This counterplea of Voucher, viz. that neither the Vouchee
nor his Ancestor^, had ever any thing in the land, so that he might a feofment
make with Warranty, shall be received, albeit the Vouchee be ready to enter
into Warranty. IX. Stat. 14 E. 3.18. Where the tenant voucheth to Warranty ^
dead-man, the Demandant shall be received, to aver, that the Vouchee is dead,
and that there is none such.
Upholsters.
* I. Stat. 11. H. 7.19. None shall put to sale in Fairs or Markets any
Featherbeds, Bolsters, or Pillows, except such as are stuffed with one sort of
stuff, viz. dry pulled feathers, or clean down, and not with scalded feathers,
fen-down, or any other unlawful corrupt stuff, in pain to forfeit the same:
Howbeit any (for their private use) may make or cause to be made any such
unlawful stuff or wares, so as the same be not exposed to Sale in Fairs or
Markets, upon the like pain. II. Also Quilts, Mattresses, and Cushions, shall
be stuffed with one sort of stuff only, viz. clean wool, or clean flocks, and
not with horse-hair, Fen down, Nets-hair, Goats hair, or other unlawful stuff,
in pain to forfeit the same. * III. Stat. 5. 6 E. 6.23. None shall make (to the
intent to sell or offer to be sold) any Fether-bed, Bolster, or Pillow, except
the same be stuffed with dry pulled feathers or clean down only, without
mingling of scalded feathers, Fen-down, Thistle-down, Sand, Lime, Gravel, or
other unlawful or corrupt stuff, in pain to forfeit the same (so offered to be
sold) or the value thereof. IV. None shall make (to the intent to sell or offer
to be sold) any Quilt, Mattress, or Cushions, stuffed with any other stuff,
then feathers, wool, or flocks alone, in pain to forfeit the same (so sold or
put to sale) or the value thereof. V. The Forfeitures aforesaid are to be
divided betwixt the King and the Prosecutor.

his Feoffors should have, if the action were brought against them: And if such
Pernor happen to die, his heir being within age, his heir shall also have his
age, and all other advantages, as if his ancestor had died seized of the land
in demand: Also all recoveries had against such Pernors, their Heirs or their
Feoffees, or Cofeoffees and their heirs, shall be as good as if such Pernors
were tenants indeed, or feoffees to their use, at the time of such actions
brought. III. Stat. 3. H. 7.4. All Deeds of gift of goods and Chattels made in
trust to the use of the grantor shall be void. IV. Stat. 19. H. 7.15. The
Sheriff or other Officer having a Writ to execute upon lands against any person

him, against whom execution is so sued. V. Also the heir of Cestuy que use of
land in soccage, shall pay relief, Herriot, and all other duties to the Lord of
the Fee, as if his ancestors had died seized thereof. VI. Howbeit, upon such
execution served, as aforesaid, Cestuy que use shall have all such advantage as
he might have, if he were seized of the land. VII. Cestuy que use being a bond
man, the land may be seized by his Lord. VIII. Stat. 27. H. 8.10. Where any

of such person or persons, as are seized of any Lands, Tenements, or
Hereditaments, to the use, confidence, or trust of any such person or persons,
or body politic, shall be deemed and adjudged to be in him or them, that have

Wales.
I. The second Volume of the Book of Old Statutes is a long Act made Anno 12 E.
5. entitled, Statuta Walliae, whereby it appears, that Wales was then
incorporated and united to England, and there you shall also find many good
Laws concerning the division of Wales into Counties, Trials and Division of
Actions, together with diverse forms of Writs, and the proceeding thereupon much
like to the Laws of England; For all which, see there that Act at large. II.
Stat. 28 ^. 3.2. All Lords of the Marches of Wales shall be perpetually
attending and annexed to the Crown of England, as they and their Ancestors have
been in times past, and not to the Principality of Wales, in whose hands soever
the same shall come. III. Stat. 9 H. 4.4. No Thief or Felon in Wales (openly
known) shall be suffered to disclaim out of the Seigniory, where the Felony was
committed. But such manner of disclaimer, shall be from henceforth utterly put

other person shall be deputed and sworn in open Court for the true keeping of
the Jurors, who (without special order of the Court) shall not suffer them to
have any bread, drink, meat, fire, or light, nor to speak to any person
whatsoever; nor speak to them himself, before they are agreed upon their
verdict, unless it be only to ask them, whether or no they are agreed; and all
this such^ Keeper shall observe, in pain to be imprisoned and fined, at the
discretion of the Court. VI. Here, if the Jurors give any untrue verdict
against the King, contrary to good and pregnant evidence, or otherwise
misdemean themselves, the Lord President and Council (upon complaint thereof)
have power to convent them before the said Council, and to punish them at their
discretions. VII. Stat. 26 H. 8.6. All persons dwelling in Wales or the

within theirs. VIII. If any Steward or other Officer there do feign any untrue
surmise against any person that shall so appear, as aforesaid, and thereupon
commit him to prison, contrary to Law, or the custom of that Lordship, the
Commissioners or Council (upon complaint) have power to send for such Steward
or Officer, and if upon good proof it be found that the party was so imprisoned
without lawful cause, they shall assess such Steward or Officer to pay him 6 s.
8 d. for every day of his imprisonment, or more at their discretions, as the
damage shall deserve; the Commissioners shall also fine him to the Kings use,
whether he appear or not, and may compel him by imprisonment to pay such fines
and penalties both to the King and the party grieved. IX. None in Wales or the
Marches thereof, coming to any Sessions or Court there, shall bring or cause to

or of the Commissioners or Council there. X. None, without the Commissioners
license in writing, shall there, or in the Counties thereto adjoining, require

making for any of the said offenses in any Lordship marcher, shall be no bar
for any person or persons indicted for the same within 2. years next after such
offense committed. XIII. The said Justices of Peace and Jail-delivery have
power to award all manner of Process, as well of Outlawry as otherwise, against
every such offender, and shall send to the Lord or Officer of the Lordship,
where the offender is resiant, a Certificate under the seals of two of them at
least, of any such outlawry, or attainder, commanding him under the pain of 100
l. to be forfeited to the King, to apprehend, or cause to be apprehended, the
body of such offender, and safely to keep him, until such convenient time
before the next Jail-delivery of the County, where he was so outlawed, as shall
be thought fit for his conveyance thither, and then he shall be conveyed from
marcher to marcher by the Lords or Officers thereof, to the said next Sessions
of Jail-delivery of the County, where he was so outlawed, as aforesaid. And
here, the Lords marchers and Officers aforesaid, by whom he is so to be
conveyed, shall not be negligent herein, in pain to forfeit (each of them so
making default) 100 l. to be levied to the Kings use: Also the said Lords or
other Officers shall at the said Sessions make due return of such Certificate,
upon the like pain: Howbeit here, all traverses, challenges, exceptions,
advantages, and all other Pleas upon any such outlawry are saved to the
offender. XIV. Here, an offender attainted of Felony as Principal or accessory,
upon surety found for the good behavior, may (for one time only, by the assent
of the President and two Commissioners) be discharged, and admitted to a Fine,
to be levied for the King's use, so as no appeal be then depending against him
for such offenses. XV. Provided, That this Act shall not extend to abridg the

at the request of his Lord, he shall not be compelled thereunto: But when he is
of full age, he shall pay his Lord (before he receive his land) as much as any
would have given the Lord for the marriage: And that, whether the heir will
marry himself or not; for, of right, the marriage of the heir within age
pertains to the Lord. VIII. Marlbr. 6. 52 H. 3. Where any enfeoff their
eldest sons and heirs within age of the Inheritance, with purpose to defraud
the Lords of their Wardships: It is accorded, that by occasion of any such
Feoffment no chief Lord shall lose his Ward. IX. As for such as feign false
Feoffments of their land, which they would deliver out for term of years, with
purpose to defraud the chief Lords of their Wards, in which Feoffments is
contained, that they are satisfied of the whole service due unto them, until a
certain time, so as such Feoffees are bound at the said term to pay a certain
sum to the value of the same lands, or far above, so that after the end of such
term, the land shall return to such Feoffors and their heirs, because no man
will be content to hold it at the price: It is accorded that by such fraud no
chief Lord shall lose his Ward: Howbeit, the Lords shall not disseize such
Feoffees without judgment, but shall have a Writ of Ejectione custodiae to
recover the Ward; And when by the witnesses to the Feoffment, with other lawful
men of the Country, the value of the land, and the quantity of the sum payable
after the term, it shall be tried, whether such Feoffments were made bona fide,
or by Collusion, as aforesaid: And if the chief Lords in such cases recover
their Wards by judgment, the Feoffees nevertheless may have their action to
recover such term or fee (which they had therein) when the heirs come to their
lawful age. X. Where chief Lords maliciously implead such Feoffees, feigning
this ease, when the Feoffments were made bona fide, in such cases, the Feoffees
shall recover against the chief Lords their damages and costs, and besides, the
Plaintiffs shall be punished by amerciament. XI. Marlbr. 7. 52 H. 3. In a plea
of Communi Custodia, if the deforceors come not at the great distress, that
Writ shall be renewed twice or thrice, at such terms as it may be done in,
within the half year following, so as at every such time the writ may be read
in open County (if the deforceor be not found before) and be there openly
proclaimed, that he may appear at the day limited; and if he come not in to
answer within the half year, nor the Sheriff can take his body, to answer
before the Justices, according to Law; then as a Rebel and one that will not be
justified, he shall lose the seisin of the Ward; saving to him at another time
his Action, if he have right to the same. XII. Howbeit, where the Wardship
belongs to the Guardian of Wards, being within age, and where Guardians demand
a Wardship, which belongs to the heir, such heirs (within age) shall not lose
their inheritance by the negligence of their Guardians, as in the case
aforesaid, but in such cases the Common Law shall run as has been accustomed.
XIII. Marlb. 17. 52 H. 3. Guardians in Soccage shall make no waste, sale, or
destruction of the heirs inheritance, but safely keep the same to the use of
the heir, and when he comes to age, shall answer him the issues thereof by a
lawful account, saving their reasonable costs: Neither shall such Guardians
sell the marriage of such heir; but to his advantage, and the Kinsfolk, that
have such Ward (from the time that Writs of impleading have not been granted,
which seems to be by Magna Charta 27. See before 3.) shall have such Wardship
to the heirs advantage, without making waste, sale, or destructions, as
aforesaid. XIV. West. 1.21. 3 E. 1. Guardians shall keep the Lands in Ward
without destruction, according to Magna Charta: so also shall Archbishopricks,
Bishoprics, Abbacies, Churches, and all spiritual dignities be kept in time of
vacation. XV. West. 1.22. 3 E. 1. The Statute of Merton 6. (before 4.) as to
the marriage of heirs without their Guardians consent, is confirmed. XVI. The
Lord may hold the land of heirs females two years after their age of 14. within
which two years if he marry them not, they shall go quit, without giving any
thing for the Wardship, or Marriage, and if they will not accept a convenient
marriage tendered by the Lord, he shall hold their land till their age of 21
years and over, until he have taken the value of the marriage. XVII. West.
2.16. 13 E. 1. Where one holds sundry lands of diverse Lords by
Knight Service, that Lord shall have the marriage, by whom the child's Ancestor
was first enfeoffed, without having respect to the sex, or the quantity of the
land, but only to the more ancient Feoffment. XVIII. West. 2.35. 13 E. 1. Where
children (whose marriage belongs to another) are taken away (the ravisher
having no right to marriage) albeit the ravisher afterward restore the child
unmarried, or pay for the marriage, yet for his offense he shall be punished by
two years imprisonment: and in case he do not restore, or marry the child after
years of consent, and be not able to satisfy for the marriage, he shall abjure
the Realm, or have perpetual imprisonment, and thereupon the Plaintiff shall
have a Writ of Ravishment of Ward in this form: XIX. Si A. secerit te securum
de clamore sue, etc. tunc pone per vad. etc. B. quod sit coram Justic. etc.
oftensurus, quare talem haeredem ins^^a aetatem existentem, cujus maritagium ad
ipsum pertinet, tali loco inventum rapuit, and abduxit contra voluntatem ipsius
A. and contra pacem nostram, etc. XX. If the heir be in the same County, then
this clause is to be added: Et diligenter inquiras, ubi ille haeres sit in
baliva tua, and ipsum (ubicunque fuerit inventus) capias, and salvo and secure
custodias, ita quod eum habeas coram praefat. Justic. nostris ad praefat.
terminum, ad reddendum, cui praedictorum A. vel B. reddi debeat. XXI. Process
shall be made against the offender by distress, if he have whereby to be
distrained, or else (for his contumacy) he shall be outlawed. XXII. If the heir
be married, or carried into another County, the Writ shall be directed to the
Sheriff of that other County, in this form: Questus est nobis A. quod B. nuper
talem haeredem infra aetatem and in custodia sua existentem tali loco in tali
Comitatu rapuit, and de Comitatu tali ad talem locum in Com. tuo abduxit,
Contra voluntatem ipsius A. and contra pacem nostram, etc. Et ideo tibi
praecipimus, quod praedicium haeredem (ubicunque in baliva tua invenire
poteris) capias and salvo and secure eum custodias; Ita quod eum habeas coram
Justic. nostris, etc. tali dic, quam idem A. habet versus praedict. B. ad
reddendum, cui de jure reddi debeat. XXIII. The death of the heir (before he
can be found or restored to the Plaintiff) shall not stop the Suit, nor excuse
the ravisher from punishment; or if the Plaintiff die, his heir shall revive
the Suit, if the right did belong unto the Plaintiff by reason of his proper
fee; but if it were by gift, sale, or the like, the suit shall be revived by
his Executors; or in case the Defendant die, the suit shall be re-summoned
betwixt the Plaintiff, his heirs, or executors, and the Executors of the
Defendant, or his heirs, if the Executors be not sufficient to satisfy the
value of the marriage, but not as to the pain of imprisonment, for none shall
be punished for another offense. XXIV. Also in a Writ de Communi custodia, if
either party die, hanging the Suit, resummons shall be made betwixt the heirs
and executors of the Plaintiff; and the heirs and executors of the Defendant,
and when they have passed to the great distress, day shall be given, within
which time three Counties may be holden at least, in every of which
proclamation shall be made that the deforceor shall appear in the Bench at the
day contained in the Writ to answer the Plaintiff, at which day if he come not,
and the proclamation be returned once, twice, or thrice, the Judgment shall
pass for the Plaintiff, saving the defendants right, if after he will claim it:
The like also shall be done in a writ de ejectione custodiae. XXV. The Stat. of
Wards and Reliefs, 28 E. 1. where any relief is given, there Wardship is
incident, and contra. XXVI. Unto Grand Serjeancy, viz. to go with the King in
his Host, ward and relief are incident; but not to petty Serjeancy, as to bear
shield or spear there. XXVII. A free Sokeman shall neither give ward or relief,
but shall double his rent after the death of his Ancestor, and shall not be
unmeasurably grieved. XXVIII. There are two kinds of Writs to recover Wards,
viz. the one is where land is holden in Knight Service, and the other, where it
is holden in soccage: The Ward of Land in Knight Service belongs to the Lord,
and the marriage also (which ought to be without disparagement) until he
attains to the age of 21 years. XXIX. The Ward of an Heir that holds in
soccage, if the land descended on the mothers side, belongs to the next friend
on the Fathers side, and contra. XXX. There are three manner of Writs to
recover Wards. 1. When both the land and heir is demanded, called a Writ de
Communi custodia, and in this case the chief Lord shall recover both the Ward
and marriage. 2. When the tenant has purchased lands holden of several Lords,
in which case the Lord, of whom the land last purchased is holden, shall
neither have the land nor heir, but the Lord that first enfeoffed the tenant
shall have them. 3. When one has lands by reason of a Ward, but has not the
Heir, here he may have a Writ to demand the heir, and not the land; and this is
called a Writ of Ravishment of Ward. XXXI. Prerog. Reg. 1. 17 E. 2. The King
shall have the Ward of all lands holden of him in chief by Knight Service,
whereof the Tenant dyed seized (of whomsoever they hold by like service, so as
they held anciently any land of the Crown) until the Heir came to his lawful
age; except the fees of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Du^^sme
between Tine and Tees, fees of Earls and Barons in the Marches where the Kings
writ runs not, and where such Archbishops, Bishops, Earls, and Barons ought to
have such Wards, albeit they hold of the King in some other place. XXXII.
Prerog. Reg. 2. 17 E. 2. The King shall have the marriage of an heir being
within age and in his Ward, whether his lands have appertained to the Crown of
ancient continuance, or came by Escheat, being in the Kings hands, or by reason
of another wardship, without respect of priority or posteriority of feoffment,
albeit such heir held also of others. XXXIII. Prerog. Reg. 6. 17 E. 2. If a
Woman (before her ancestors death that held of the King in chief) be married
before her age of consent, the King shall have the ward of her body, until her
age of consent, and then it is at her election, whether she will have him whom
she first married, or him whom the King will offer her. XXXIV. None that holds
of the King in chief by Knight Service, shall (without the Kings license) alien
so much of his lands that the residue is not sufficient to do his service:
Howbeit, this is not to be understood of members and parcels of such lands.
XXXV. Stat. 14 E. 3. Stat. 1.13. After the death of the Kings tenant in chief,
the Escheator shall cause to be seized into the Kings hands, the lands as to
their office appertains, without doing waste in houses, Woods, Parks, Ponds, or
other extortions, which may tend to the damage of the heir, and forthwith after
the Diem clausit extremum delivered to him, shall make return thereof by a good
and true extent in the Chancery. XXXVI. After such return, if the next friends
of the heir, to whom the inheritance cannot descend, shall come and offer to
take the said lands, until the heir be at age, and to give for the same as
much as another, without fraud, by accord of the Chancellor and Treasurer, they
shall have Commission to keep them (upon good security) until his full age,
answering to the King the value thereof. XXXVII. Howbeit, this Act shall not
conclude the King from having an Action of waste against such Guardians and
Farmers; the Heir also may have like Action against them, when he comes to age.
XXXVIII. Stat. 39 H. 6.2. Women being of the age of 16 years, at the time of
the death of their Ancestors, shall have livery of their lands descended to
them. XXXIX. Stat. 4 H. 7.17. The Statute of Marlb. 6. 52 H. 3. ( before 4.) is
confirmed. XL. The Lord of Cestuy que use (no Will of his Ancestor being
declared in his life time) shall have a Writ of right of Ward for the body and
the land; and the heir of Cestuy que use being at full age at the death of his
ancestor, shall pay relief; the heir also of Cestuy-que use shall have like
action of waste, as if his ancestor had dyed seized, and if the Lord be barred
in his Writ of right of Ward, the Defendant shall recover damages.

be holden of the chief Lord of the fee, or of other, and not of the feoffors
and their heirs, reserving no service, and without homage, and the aforesaid
clause: here, the feoffors Heirs shall not be bound to Warranty: Howbeit, the

II. The Statute of Gloucester, 3. 6 E. 1. Where tenant by the curtesy aliens his
Wives land, his son (having no ossets by descent) shall not be barred to
recover the land by a Writ of Mortdancester, of the seisin of his mother;
albeit his fathers deed mentions, that he and his heirs shall be bound to
warranty; but in case any land descend to the heir of his fathers side, he
shall be barred for the value of the inheritance so descended. III. Also if
afterward any inheritance descend to him by the same father, the tenant shall
recover against him of the seisin of his mother, by a Judicial writ to be
issued out of the Rolls of the Justices, before whom the plea was pleaded, to
resummon his warranty, as has been heretofore used in cases, where the
warrantor pleads ^iens per descent from him, by whose deed he is vouched. IV.
Likewise the issue of the son may recover by Writ of Cousinage, Ayel, and
Besayel, neither shall the heir of the Wife be barred of his action, after the
death of his father and mother, by writ of Entry, for land which his Father did
alien in the time of his mother, whereof no fine is levied in the Kings Court.

other profits. V. Stat. 11 H. 7.18. Every person in England and Wales having
any office, fee, or annuity of the Kings grant, shall personally attend upon
him, when he goes himself in person in the Wars (unless he have the Kings

office, fee, and annuity. Howbeit, this Act shall not extend to any spiritual

Justices of either Bench, Barons of the Exchequer, or other Officers or Clerks
of the said places, the Kings Attorney or Solicitor, Sergeants at Law, any of

Weights and Measures.
I. Magna Charta, 25.9. H. 3. One measure of Wine shall be throughout the
Realm, one measure of Ale, and one measure of Corn, viz. the quarter of London,
and one breadth of dyed cloth, Rusfet, and Haberjects, viz. two yards within the
lists; and it shall be of weights, as it is of measures. II. Ashsa Pants and
Cervitiae, 5 1 H. 3. By this Statute the Assize of bread was rated, viz. when a
quarter of wheat should be sold for 12 d. wastel bread of a farthing (a kind of
bread then in use) should weigh 6 pounds 16 shillings, viz. 6 pounds 9 ounces
and 12 penny weight, according to Troy-weight: For at that time a pound of
silver, by Troy-weight, was a pound Sterling, or 20 shillings, and a penny now,
was three ^ence then: And so it continued, until H. 6. raised the ounce of
Silver (which was before but 20 pence) to 30 pence, and after that the old
penny was valued at three half pence: Afterward E. 4. raised it to 40 pence:
then H. 8. to 45 pence, and last of all Qu. El. to 5 shillings, at which rate
it yet stands: And all this was done by the said Kings and Queens
Proclamations, according to the exigencies of affairs in the Commonwealth at
the times, when it was so altered. III. According to the proportion ordained by
this Statute, the ensuing Table is framed for the due Assize of Bread now in
use. A Table of the Assize of Bread, according to Troy-weight, having Twelve
Ounces in a Pound, and twenty Peny-weight in each of those twelve Ounces.

abovesaid rate (at the time when this Statute was made) a Baker in a Quarter of
Wheat (as was then proved by the Kings Bakers) might gain 4 d. and the bran,
and two loaves for advantage; for three servants 1 d. ob. for two lads ob. for
salt ob. for kneading ob. for candle qu. for wood 3 d. and for his boultel, ob.
in toto, 12 d. ob. qu. Which being trebled, according to the rate of money now)
amounts to 3 s. 2 d. qu. and may therefore be now conceived fit for the Baker
to gain in the uttering of every Quarter of Wheat ^ Howbeit note, That by the
Book of Assise now in use, published by Proclamation toward the latter end of
the Reign of Queen Elizabeth) Bakers inhabiting Corporate Towns (in regard they
pay Scot and Lot there) are allowed six shillings in every Quarter of the
middle-prized wheat for their charge in baking: And Country or Foreign Bakers
only 4 s. For Example; When the middle price of wheat is 30 s. the Quarter, for
assize of Town-Bakers you are to find in the aforegoing Table the assize of
bread answering to 36 s. but for the assize of Foreign Bakers, that of 34 s.
And therefore (in that case) the penny white loaf put to sale by Town-Bakers
ought to weigh nine ounces, eight penny weight; but that uttered by foreign
Bakers nine ounces nineteen penny weight, as appears in the Table. V. When a
Quarter of wheat is sold for 3 s. or 3 s. 4 d. and barley for 20 d. or 2 s. and
oats for 16 d. the quarter, Brewers in Cities may afford to sell two gallons of
beer or ale for 1 d. and out of Cities three gallons for 1 d. and when in a
Town three gallons may be sold for 1 d. out of a Town four gallons may be
afforded: And this Assize shall be observed throughout England. VI. The Assize
of Bread shall be rated according to the middle price of wheat, and shall not
be changed but by 6 d. increasing or decreasing in the sale of a Quarter. VII.
Stat. de ponderibus and mensuris. An English penny sterling (being now three
pence) shall weigh 32 grains of wheat taken out of the middle of the ear, and
20 d. do make an ounce 12 ounces a pound, 8 pounds a gallon, 8 gallons a London
bushel, which is the eighth part of a quarter. Stat. 31 E. 1. See Rastal,
Weights 7, 8. VIII. Stat. of Pillory and Tumbrel, 51 H. 3. If a Baker or Brewer
be convict not to have observed the Assize; for the first, second, and third
fault, he shall be amerced, except the offense be grievous and often, and then
shall the Baker to the Pillory, and the Brewer to the Tumbrel, or some other
Correction. IX. Six men shall be sworn truly togather all the measures and
weights of the Town, and of Mills, and upon the measures and weights, as also
upon every loaf shall the name of the owner be distinctly written: After this,
twelve lawful men shall be sworn to make true answer on the Kings behalf upon
Articles hereafter following: and the Bailiff shall be commanded to bring the
Bakers and Brewers with their measures, and all things underwritgen, X. Then
first the Jury shall inquire the first, second, and third prices of Wheat sold
the last Market Day; and also how Barley and Oats; and upon how much increase
or decrease of the price of Wheat, the Baker ought to change the Assize of his
bread, and how much it ought to weigh, according to the present price of Wheat
and whether the Town have a Pillory of convenient strength. XI. Again, they
shall inquire of the assize and price of Wine, and the Vintners names, and how
they sell, and whether they utter that which is wholesome for man's body: also
of the assize of ale in the Court of the Town, how it is, and whether it be
observed; and if the Brewers be found to have sold contrary to the Assize, they
shall be amerced, or else judged to the Tumbrel. XII. They shall inquire
likewise of such as use double or false Weights or Measures, of Butchers and
Cooks that sell unwholesome meat; and of forestallers, which buy any thing
before the accustomed time of Market. XIII. Stat. de Pistoribus, 31 E. 1. The
assize or weight of wheat shall never be changed, but when there is six pence
increasing or decreasing in the price of a quarter. XIV. If a Bakers bread be
found a farthing weight lacking in two shillings six pence, or under, he shall
be amerced; and if it pass the same number, he shall suffer the punishment of
the Pillory, which shall not be remitted for gold or silver: and every Baker
shall have a mark of his own for bread. XV. According to which proportion, it
seems, that if a Bakers bread wants not a penny weight in six ounces, he shall
not incur amerciament. XVI. Every Pillory or Stretch-neck must be made of
convenient strength, for that execution may be done upon offenders without
peril of their bodies. XVII. The Toll of a Mill shall be taken according to
custom and the strength of the water, either to the 20 or 26 corn: also by a

cantell; and if the Farmers find the Millers their necessaries, they shall take
nothing besides their due toll, in pain to be grievously amerced. XVIII. The
assize of Ale shall be assessed, proclaimed, and kept, according to the price
of corn, whereof Malt is made; and the Brewer shall not increase more in a
gallon, but according to the rate of 6 d. rising or falling in a Quarter of
Malt: and if he break the assize for the first, second, and third time, he
shall be amerced; but for the fourth, he shall incur the Pillory. XIX. A
Butcher that sells Swines-flesh mezled, or dead of the murrin, shall for the
first time be amerced, for the second incur the Pillory, for the third be
imprisoned, and make fine; and for the fourth, shall forbear the Town: and in
this manner shall it be done to all that offend in like case. XX. The Standard
of Bushels, Gallons, and Elns, shall be signed with an Iron Seal of the Kings;
and no Measure shall be in any Town, unless it do agree with the Kings Measure,
and be marked with the Seal of the Shire-Town. XXI. If any do sell or buy with
Measures unsealed, and not examined by the Mayor and Bailiffs, he shall be
grievously amered. XXII. All Measures shall be viewed twice every year; and if
any be convict of a double Measure, he shall be imprisoned, and grievously
punished. XXIII, The Standard, Bushels and Elns shall be in the custody of the
Mayor and Bailiffs, and of six lawful persons of the Town being sworn, before
whom all Measures shall be sealed; and no grain shall be sold by the heap or
Cantel, except it be Oats, Malt, and Meal. XXIV. No Fore-staller shall be
suffered to dwell in any Town; and if any be convict of that offense, for the
first time he shall be amerced, and lose the thing so bought; for the second,
shall have judgment of the Pillory; for the third, shall be imprisoned and make
fine; and for the fourth, shall abjure the Town: and like judgment also shall
be given his accessaries. XXV. An Ordinance for measuring of land, 34 E. 1. See

(except bodies politic and corporate) by his last Will and Testament in
writing, or by Act executed in his life, by himself solely, or by himself and
others jointly, severally, or particularly, or by all those ways, or any of
them, as much as in him of right is, all his said manors, lands, tenements,

may give, dispose, will, or assign to any person or persons (except bodies
politic and corporate) by his last Will and Testament in writing, or by an Act
executed in his life, by himself solely, or by himself and others jointly,
severally, or particularly, or by all those ways or any of them (as much as in
him of right is) two parts, as well of all the said Manors, lands, etc. as of
all other rents, and hereditaments, or of any of them, or any rents, commons,
profits, or commodities out of, or to be perceived of the same two parts, or
out of any parcel thereof, in three parts to be divided, or as much thereof as
shall amount to the yearly value of two parts thereof, in three parts to be
divided (of what person or persons soever they be holden) at his free will and
pleasure. XVII. Such Will so declared shall be good for two parts of the said
Manors, lands, etc. although it be made of the whole, or more then the two
parts thereof: the said division to be made by the devisor, or owner of the
said Manors, lands, etc. by will in writing, or otherwise in writing: and in
default thereof by Commission out of the Court of Wards upon inquiry of the
true value thereof, by the oaths of 12 men: and upon return thereof in the same
Court, the division shall be made by the Master of the Wards, if the said
Master and parties cannot otherwise agree upon the division: and the issues and
profits of the two parts shall be restored to them that shall have right
thereunto, from the death of the owner or deviser. XVIII. Every person being

his last Will and Testament in writing, or by act, executed in his life,
solely, or jointly, as aforesaid, two parts thereof, or any rents, common, or
profits, to be perceived out of the same two parts, or out of any part thereof,
etc. And such Will shall be good for such two parts, albeit it be made of the
whole lands so holden, or of more then the said two parts; and shall also be
good for all lands not holden in Knight Service, and for all rents, commons,
and other profits, to be perceived out of the same. XIX. Here also, the
division of the third part is to be made, as before, where it concerns the
Kings Interest, but where it concerns other Lords, the division shall be by
Commission out of the Chancery, if such Lords and the parties in the mean time
cannot agree thereupon. XX. The savings (in this Act, and in that of 32 H.
8.1.) of custody, wardship, relief, and primer seisin to the King, and of
custody and wardship to other Lords, shall be expounded thus: That the King
shall have for his full third part such manors, lands and tenements, as shall
descend, as well in fee-tail, as in fee-simple, to the heir of the person, that
made such Will or disposition, as aforesaid; and that the will or gift of the
two parts shall be good in Law, albeit the will or gift be made of all the
fee-simple lands, or the more part thereof: Howbeit if the King have not a full
third part left him, he shall take out of the two parts so much as shall make
it up, to be severed by commission, as aforesaid; and such advantage also is
given to other Lords for their third parts; and the like shall both the King
and they do, in case their third parts, or any parcel of them be evicted from
them or determined. XXI. A Pardon of alienation must be sued by those to whom
lands are devised, for which they shall pay a third part of the value of the
lands, holden in chief; and this Act shall be sufficient warrant for the Lord
Chancellor to grant such pardons under the Great Seal, without further suit to
be made to the King for the same. XXII. Wills or Testaments of manors, lands,
etc. made by femes covert, Infants, Idiots, or persons of non sane memory,
shall not be good in Law. XXIII. If any person or persons shall (by will or act
executed) make any estate for years, life, or lives, with one remainder over in
see, or with diverse remainders over for term of life, years, or in tail, with a
remainder over in fee-simple, or any other estates, conditions, mesnalties,
tenures, or conveyances, by fraud and covin, to the intent to defraud the King
of his Prerogative, primer seisin, livery, relief, wardship, marriages, or
rights, or any other Lords of their wardships, reliefs, heriots, or other
profits, and such estates or other conveyances be found by office to be so made
by covin, fraud, or deceit: In this case, the King shall enjoy his Prerogatives
and profits aforesaid, according to this and the said former Act
(notwithstanding such estates or conveyances) until such office be annulled by
traverse, or otherwise: Also other Lords shall have their remedy in such cases,
for their wardships, by writ of right of ward, and shall distrain, and make
avowry, or conusance by themselves or their Bailiffs, for their reliefs,
heriots, and other profits, as if no such estate had been made: Howbeit the
right and title of the donees, feoffees, lessees, and devisees thereof, against
the devisors and his heirs, after the interest of the King and other Lords
determined, are saved. XXIV. Provided, that every person, from whom the King or
other Lord shall take any manors, lands, etc. for their third part, or to make
it up, may have relief in Chancery against every person, who shall be entitled
(by any such will or gift) to the other two parts, to have such contribution
for the same, as the Lord Chancellor or Keeper shall think convenient.
