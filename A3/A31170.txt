The CASE of the People, called Quakers, as it concerns an Affirmation, which
they desire may be extended to all Britain.
THE Legislature being acquainted, with the Quakers Conscienclously scrupling
to take any Oath, did very tenderly, and favorably, grant them an Affirmation
to be used instead of an Oath.

But the said Affirmation, (notwithstanding the Union of the two Kingdoms) does
not extend to Scotland; and many of the said People in the Northern Countries,
and diverse other Parts of England, do conscienciously scruple that Affirmation
(even to their own Prejudice, in respect of their Properties) because as they
think, the Title of the Act seems to intimate, as if it was an Oath, (though not
in the usual Form) and that there are Expressions in the Affirmation it self,
which are too much like an Oath; of which mind are the said People in Scotland.

For these Reasons, the said People, called Quakers, do now apply to the
Parliament, for such an Affirmation, as will be agreeable to the Religious
Sentiments of their Friends, in North- Britain, and elsewhere.

And the said People are willing, that not only the present Penalties of
Perjury, but also such farther Punishment, as shall be thought meet, be
inflicted on them, in case they falsely, or corruptly, make use of the
Affirmation they desire.

Thus, with the greatest Security to others, they may be, both eased, with
respect to their Scruples, and rendered more generally useful, to their
Neighbors, and themselves.

All which is Humbly submitted the Legislature.
THE CASE Of the People, called QUAKERS.
