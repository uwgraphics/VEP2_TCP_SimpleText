TO THE KINGS Most Excellent MAJESTY: The Most Humble and Faithful ADVICE of
Your Majesty's ever Dutiful Subject and Servant the Bishop of Durham.
THat Your Majesty would be pleased to withdraw your Protection of those Romish
Chapels, which are daily made the occasion of so much Disturbance and Mischief
here, and if continued any longer, I fear, will unavoidably endanger the Peace
and Safety of this Your great City, and consequently of Your whole Kingdom.

That the Archbishopric of York, which Your Majesty has been pleased to offer
me, may be filled with some other more deserving Person: And that Your Majesty
would be pleased to make another Dean of Christ-Church in Oxford, instead of
Mr. Massey, who is utterly incapable thereof by Law: That the Fellows of
Sidney-Colledge in Cambridge, for whom I have so often moved Your Majesty, may
have leave to elect a New Master in the place of Mr. Bassett (he being also
unqualified on the same account) and to proceed in all other Affairs relating
to that Society, according to their original Statutes and Constitutions.

That Your Majesty would be pleased to Call a Free Parliament so soon as may
be, this being the only probable means for preserving Your Sacred Person, for
preventing the Effusion of Christian Blood, and for establishing Your Throne,
and Government both in Church and State upon sure and lasting Foundations.

N. DURHAM.
