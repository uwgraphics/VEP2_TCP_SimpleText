A Proclamation Commanding the due observation of the Desires of the
Commissioners for the Contribution of the Country of Oxford, and for punishing
all straggling Soldiers and others, Robbing, and Plundering the Country.
WHEREAS the High-Sheriffe, and other the Commissioners for Contribution of
this Our County of Oxford, have lately by their humble Petition acquainted Us
with the many and frequent Insolences offered the Inhabitants thereof by the
Soldiers, and others pretending themselves to be of Our Army, as in taking
away Horses from the plough, robbing by the Highway, wasting and destroying of
Corn, and other personal Injuries daily offered unto them: And likewise that
Free Quarter is frequently taken where the Contribution is paid, We thereupon
in tender Commiseration of their sufferings, and being most ready to satisfy
their just requests, were graciously pleased to give Order, That the Desires of
the Commissioners for the weekly Loan, for the supply of the Horse of Our Army,
from this Our County of Oxford, should be forthwith published in Print, for the
better information of the Officers and Soldiers of Our Army, the which We do
hereby strictly charge and Command all the said Officers and Soldiers
punctually to observe, and not to infringe them, or any of them at their
perils. And for prevention of the like violences and outrages hereafter; We do
farther require and authorize the Lord-Lieutenant-Generall of Our Army, to
ordain and allow such a fit person as the Commissioners shall make choice of to
be a Provost-Marshall, who with a sufficient Guard of Twenty persons shall
constantly scour the Country, and apprehend and punish by Marshall-Law all
straggling and wandering Soldiers, and all such as shall any kind offer any
violence to the Inhabitants, according to such directions as he shall from time
to time receive (...)rom the Lord-Lieutenant-Generall. And to the end Our good
Subjects of this County may find the effect of Our Care (...)or their
preservation; We do farther require the Lord-Lieutenant-Generall, to name and
appoint a Court of War to (...)it Constantly every Wednesday and Saturday with
the Commissioners, to hear and give redress to their just Com(...)laints; to
which Court of War the Provost-Marshall is likewise to give a weekly account
of his proceedings. This (...)ur grace and favor We Command shall be forthwith
put in execution, and therefore Our Pleasure is, That it be pub(...)shed in all
the Hundreds, Towns, and Parishes of this County, and annexed to the late
printed Desires of the Commissi(...)ners, that so it may be hence forward duly
observed by all the Officers, and Soldiers of Our Army, at their perils.

Given (...) Our Court at Oxford this Fourteenth of February, in the Nineteenth
year of Our Reign.
