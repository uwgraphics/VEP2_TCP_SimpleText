SERIOVS CONSIDERATIONS for repressing of the increase of IESVITES, PRIESTS,
and PAPISTS, without shedding of Blood.

Written by Sir R. C. and Presented to King JAMES of happy Memory.

Printed Anno Dom. MDCXLI.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE REPRESSING of Priests, Jesuits, and Recusants, without
drawing of Blood.
I Am not ignorant, that this later Age has brought forth a swarm of busy
heads, which measure the great mysteries of State by the Rule of their
self-conceited wisdom; But if they would consider, that the Commonwealth
governed by grave Counselors, is like unto a Ship directed by a skillful
Pylot, to whom the necessities of occasions and grounds of Reason, why he
steereth the Helm to this or that point of the Compass, are better known,
then to those that stand aloof off; they would perhaps be more sparing if not
more wary in their Resolutions.

For my own particular, J must confess, that J am naturally too much inclined
to his opinion, who once said; Qui been latuit, been vixit, and freshly
recalling to mind, the saying of Functius to his Friend at the hour of his
untimely Death: Disce, meo exemplo, mandato munere fungi:
Et fuge ceu Pestem, (...).


J could easily forbear to make my handwriting the Record of any opinion,
which nevertheless I protest to maintain, rather deliberatively then by the
way of a conclusive assertion; Therefore without wasting precious time any
longer, with needless Prologue, I will briefly set down the question in the
terms following:

Whether it be more expedient to suppress Popish practices, against the due
Allegiance to his Majesty, by the strict execution of the Laws Touching
Jesuits, and Seminary Priests, or to restrain them to close Prison during
life, if no reformation following.

The doubt propounded consisting of Two Branches, necessarily requires to be
distinctly handled, that by comparing either part the convenience, mentioned in
the Question, may be cleared with more facility.

1. In favor of the first Division there are not a few, who grounding
themselves on an ancient Proverb, (...), A dead man bites not: Affirm that
such are dangerous to be preserved alive, who being guilty, condemned, and full
of fear, are likely for puchase of life and liberty, to engage their utmost in
desperate adventures against their King and Country.

2. No less is it to be feared, that while the Sword of Justice is remiss in
cutting off heinous offenders, against the dignity of the Crown, the misled
Papal multitude in the interim, may enter into a jealous suspense, whether
that forbearance proceed from the fear of exasperating their desperate
humors, or that it is now become questionable, whether the execution of their
Priests be simply for matter of State, or pretended quarrel for Religion.

3. And whereas in a remediless inconvenience, it is lawful to use the
extremity of Laws against some few, that many by terror of the Example may be
reformed; what hope can there be, that clemency may tame their hearts, who
interpret his Majesty's grace in Transporting their Priests out of this Realm
to be a mere shift, to rid the Prisons of those whom Conscience could not
condemn of any capital crime.

4. Neither are their vaunting whisperings to be neglected, by which they seek
to confirm the fearful Souls of their party, and to inveigle the ignorant,
doubtful, or discontented persons; for if the glorious extolling of their
powerful Friends, and the expecting of a golden day be suffered, to win
credit with the meaner sort, the relapse cannot be small, or the means easy
to reform the Error, without a general combustion of the State.

5. Let experience speak somewhat in this behalf, which has evidently
discryed within the current of few years; That the forbearance of Severity
has multiplied their Roll in such manner, that it remains as a Corrasive to
thousands of his Majesty's well affected Subjects.

6. To what purpose serves it, to muster the names of the Protestants, or to
vaunt them to be ten for one of the Roman faction, as if bare figures of
numeration could prevail against an united party resolved and advised
aforehand, how to turn their faces with assurance unto all dangers, while in
the mean time, the Protestants nestling in vain security, suffer the weed to
grow up that threateneth their bane and merciless ruin?

7. Sometimes the Oath of Supremacy choked their presumptuous imaginations,
and yet could not that infernal smoke be wholly smothered, nor the Locusts
issuing there-out, be cleansed from the face of this Land. Now that the
Temporal power of the King, contained in the Oath of Allegiance, is by the
Papal Sea, and many of the Adorers thereof, impudently avowed to be unlawful;
shall the broachers of such Doctrine be suffered to live, yea to live and be
received of us, for whose destruction they groan daily?

8. To be a right Popish Priest, in true English sense, is to bear the
Character of a disloyal Renegade, of his natural obedience to his Sovereign;
Whom, if by connivence he shall let slip or chastise with a light hand; what
immunity may not Traiterous delinquents in lesser degrees expect or challenge
after a sort, in Equity and Justice.

9 If there were no receivers there would be no Thieves: Likewise, if there
were no Harbourers of the Jesuits, it is to be presumed that they would not
trouble this Isle with their presence; Therefore Rigor must be extended against
the Receiver, that the Jesuit may be kept out of doors; were it then
indifferent Justice to hang up the Accessory and let the Principal go free;
namely to suffer the Priest to draw his breath at length, while the entertainer
of him under his Roof submits his body to the Executioners hand? Without doubt
if it be fit to forbear the chief, it will be necessary to receive the second
offender into protection. Wherewith a mischief must ensue of continual
expense; and scandalous restraint of so great a number.

10. Reputation is one of the Principal Arteryes of the Commonwealth, which
Maxim is so well known to the Secretaries of the Papacy; That by private
Forgeries and public impressions of Calumniations, they endeavor to wound us
in that vital part; Howsoever therefore, some few of that stamp being better
tempered then their fellows in defense of this present government, have not
spared to affirm; That tyranny is unjustly ascribed thereunto, for so much as
freedom of Conscience, after a sort, may be redeemed for money;
Notwithstanding there want not many Pamphleters of their side, who
opprobriously cast in our teethes, the converting of the Penalty, inflicted on
Recusants, and refusers of the oath of allegiance from the Kings Exchequer to
a particular purse: surely we cannot presume that these Libellers may be
dissuaded from spitting out their venom maliciously against us, when they
shall see their Priests mewed up without further process of Law: For either
they will attribute this calm dealing to the Justice of their cause, the
strength of their party or patience, or that tract of time has discovered our
Laws importing overmuch sharpness in good policy, to be thought fitter for
abrogation, by non vsance, then repealed by a public decree.

11. Moreover it is forethought by some, that if these Seminaries be only
restrained, that they may prove hereafter like a snake, kept in the Bosom,
such as Bonner, Gardener, and others of the same Livery showed themselves to be
after Liberty, obtained in Queen Mary's days; And if the loss of their
Ghostly Fathers agrieve them, it is probable, that they will take Arms sooner,
and with more courage to free the Living, then to set up a Trophie to the dead.

12. How soever the Jesuits Band is known in their Native soil, to be
defective in many respects, which makes them underlings to the Protestants; as
in authority, arms and the Protection of the Laws, which is all in all:
Nevertheless, they insinuate themselves to foreign Princes, favoring their
party, with promises of strange assistance at home; if they may be well backed
from abroad; To which purpose they have divided the Inhabitants of this Realm
into four Sects; Whereof Ranking their Troops in the first place (as due to
the pretended Catholics) they assumed a full fourth part to their property,
and of that part again they made a Subdivision into two portions; namely of
those that openly renounced the established Church of England, and others whose
certain number could not be assigned: Because they frequented our service, our
Sacraments, reserving their hearts to their Lord God the Pope. The second party
they allot to the Protestants, who retain yet, as they say, some Relics of
their Church; The third Rank and largest, was left unto the Puritans, whom
they hate deadly, in respect, that they will hold no indifferent quarter with
Papistry. The fourth and last maniple; They assign to the Politicians: Huomini
(say they) Senza Dio, and Senz anima: Men without fear of God, or regard of
their Souls; Who busying themselves only with matters of State, retain no
sense of Religion: without doubt, if the Authors of this partition have cast
their account aright, we must confess, the latter Brood is to be ascribed
properly unto them; For if the undermining of the Parliament House, the
scandalizing of the King in Print, who is Gods anointed; And the refusal of
natural obedience, be works of those that neither stand in awe of God or
Conscience; well may the Papists boast, that they are assured of the first
number; and may presume likewise of the lasts friendship, when occasion shall
be offered; For the preventing of which combination; it is a sure way to cut
off the Heads; that should tie the knot, or at least, to brand them with a
mark in the forehead, before they be dismissed, or after the opinion of
others, to make them unwelcome to the faeminine Sex; which now with great
fervency imbraceth them.

These are for the most part Arguments vented in ordinary discourse, by many
who suppose a Priests breath to be contagious in our English Air; others there
are, who maintain the second part of the question, with reasons not unworthy
of observance.

Death is the end of Temporal woes; But it may in no wise be accounted the
grave of memory; Therefore howsoever it is in the power of Justice to suppress
the person of a man, the opinion for which he suffered (conceived truly or
untruly in the hearts of a multitude) is not subject to the edge of any swor^
how sharp or keen soever: I confess that the Teeth are soon blunted, that
byte only out of the malice of a singular faction: But where poison is diffused
through the veins of a Commonwealth with intermixture of Blood, good and bad,
separation is to be made rather by vacuation, then by present incision: The
greatest byter of a State is Envy joined with thirst of Revenge, which seldom
declares it self in plain Colors, until a Jealousy conceived of personal
dangers breaks out into desperate resolutions: Here comes it to pass, that
when one mal-contented member is grieved, the rest of the body is sensible
thereof; neither can a Priest or Jesuit be cut off without a general murmr
of their Secretaries, which being confident in their number, secretly arm for
opposition, or confirmed with their Martyrs blood, (as they are persuaded)
resolve by patience and sufferance to glorify their cause; and to merit
heaven. Do we not daily see, that it is easier to confront a private Enemy,
then a society or Corporation: And that the hatred of a State is more immortal
then the spleen of a Monarchy; Therefore except it be demonstrated, that the
whole Roman City which consists not of one brood, but of a succession of
Persons may be cut off at the first stroke, as one entrei head, I see no cause
to think our state secured by sitting on the skirts of some few Seminaries,
leaving in the mean time a multitude of snarlers abroad, who already show
their Teeth and only wait opportunity to bite fiercely. I will not deny, that
whom we fear, we commonly hate; provided always, that no merit has
interceeded a reconciliation; For there is great difference between hatred
conceived against him that will take away the life, and him that may justly do
it, and yet in Clemency forbeares to put it in effect, For the latter breeds
reverent awe, whereas the former subjecteth to servile fear, always
accompanied with desire of innovations. And although it has bin affirmed of
the Church of Rome; Quod Pontificium genus semper crudele; Nevertheless out of
Charity, let us hope that all Devils are not so black as they are painted; Some
or perhaps many of them there are, whom Conscience or in default thereof, pure
shame of the world will constrain to confess, that his Majesty most
graciously distinguishes the Theory of Popery, from the Active part thereof;
as being naturally inclined; Parvis peccatis veniam, magnis sever itatem
commodare; nec poena semper, sed Saepius poenitentia Contentus esse.

2. Mistaking of punishments, legally inflicted, commonly proceeds from fond
pity, or the interest which we have in the same cause, both which beget blind
partiality. Admit then that the Papal side, affecting merit, by compassion may
be merely touched, with the restraint of their Seminaries; that cannot be
denied, I hope, except they had the hearts of Tigers; that in humanity they
will prefer their ease of durance before the Rigor of death: And albeit that
PARSONS, BELLARMINE, and the POPE himself, constrain their spiritual
Children, to thrust their fingers into the fire, by refusing the oath of
allegiance: Notwithstanding we have many Testimonies in Judicial Courts, and
printed Books, that the greater part of them are of that Theban Hunters mind,
who would rather have seen his Dogs cruel Acts, then have felt them, to his
own cost.

Garnet himself also in one of his secret Letters lamented, that after his
death, he should not be enroled amongst the Martyrs: Because that no matter of
Religion was objected against him, yet it plainly appears in his demeanure;
That he would gladly have survived the possibility of that glory, if any such
hope had remained, neither is it to be presumed, that being in prison, he would
ever have conceived that we durst not touch his Reverence, or that the Law was
remiss, which had justly condemned him and left his life to the Kings mercy,
it was the distance of the place and not persons, that interpreted the sending
over Seas of the Priests, to be a greater Argument of their innocence, then of
his Majesty's forbearance: For had Father Parsons himself bin Coram nobis, his
song would rather have been of mercy then Justice. It is truly said, that we
are all instructed, Better by examples then precepts; Therefore if the Laws
printed, and indictments recorded cannot control the Calumniations of those
that wilfully will mistake Treason for Religion, By the execution of 2. or 3.
of that Backbiting number, I doubt not, but the question may readily be
decided, Namque immedicabile vulous ense recidendum est, ne pars sincera
trahatur.

To dally with Pragmaticall Papists, especially with those that by their
example and counsel pervert his Majesty's Subjects, I hold it a point of mere
Injustice: For what comfort may the good expect when the bad are by connivence
freed to speak and imboldened, to put their disloyal thoughts in execution?
For explaining therefore of my meaning, it is necessary to have a regard unto
the nature of the Kings Liege people, that are to be reformed by example of
Justice, and other forrayners who will we, nill we, must be censurers of our
actions.

It has been truly observed, that the Nations of Europe, which are most remote
from Rome, are more superstitiously inclined to the dregs of that place, then
the near neighbors of Italy: whether that humor proceed from the complexion
of the Northern bodies which is naturally more retentive of old Customs, then
hotter Regions; or that the vices of the City, seated on 7. Hills, are by crafty
Ministers of that Sea, concealed from the vulgar sort, Ilist not now discuss,
but most certain it is, that the people of this Isle exceed the Romans in
zeal of their profession: Insomuch, that in Rome it self, I have heard the
English Fugitives taxed by the name of Pichiapetti Inglesi. Now as our
Countrymen take surer holdfast of Papal Traditions, then others: so are they
naturally better fortified with a courage to endure death for the maintenance
of that cause; For this Clymate is of that temperature, out of which Vegetius
holds it fittest, to choose a valiant soldier, where the heart finding it
self provided of plenty of blood to sustain sudden defects, is not so soon
apprehensive of death or dangers, as where the storehouse of blood being small,
every hazard makes pale Cheeks and trembling hands (Angli) say ancient
writers, bello intrepidi, nec mortis sensu deterrentur: And thereunto Botero
the Italian bears witness in his relations of many strangers, therefore
coming out of foreign parts, among the Rarities of England, desired to see
whether report has not bin too lavish in affirming that our condemned persons
yield their bodies to death with cheerfulness. And were it not that by daily
experience, we can call our selves to witness of this truth, J could produce
the Reverend Judge Fortescue, who in commendation of our English Laws, made
suitable, as he well observes, to the inbred conditions of the Inhabitants of
this Soil, avoweth that the English people in trial for criminal causes are
not compelled by Tortures to confess, as in other Nations it is used, for as
much as the quality of the English is known to be less fearful of death,
then of Torments, for which cause, if the Torments of the Civil Law were
offered to an innocent person in England, he would rather yield himself guilty
and suffer death, then endure the horror of lingering pains; Insulani plerumque
fures (says one) and so true it is, that this Country is stained with that
imputation, notwithstanding that many are put to death, to the end that others,
by their fall, might learn in time to beware: if then it does appear that
terror prevails not to keep men from offenses, which are condemned by Law and
Conscience, what assurance can there be to scare those who are constantly
satisfied in their minds, that their sufferings are either expressly or by
implication for matter of Religion and health of their Souls; In such a case
to threaten death to Englishmen; Quibus nihil interest humive, sublimive
putrescant, is a matter of small consequence, Purpuratis Gallis, Italis aut
Hispanis ista minitari, to a settled resolution of death, menaces to prolong a
wearisome life, prevail much more in such cases. Rightly did Clement the 8th
consider that by burning two Englishmen in Rome for supposed Heresy, he rather
impaired his cause, then bettered it; Jnsomuch that many present at the
resolute death of Mr. Marsh, who was brought to dust in Campo di Santa Fiore,
spared not to proclaim him for a Martyr, carried away of his ashes for a
Relic, and wished their souls in the same place with his; which news
brought to the Popes ear, caused him (as it was bruted about in Rome) solemnly
protest; That none of the English Nation should publicly from that time
forward, be consumed with fire; On the other side, if we read the volumes
written in praise of their Priests constancy, their Martyrologie or Calendar of
Martyrs, and Path way of salvation, as it were chalked out unto the Papists, by
sacrificing their lives for the Pope; we shall find that by taking away of one,
we have confirmed and invited many; whereof I could give particular instances,
if I thought any scruple were made in that point.

As for foreign parts, which hold with the Papal Supremacy, it is clear,
that they will be severe and partial Judges in this cause; For albeit that
here in England it is well known to all true and loyal Subjects; that for
matter of Roman Doctrine, no man's life is directly called into question: But
that their disobedience in reason of State, is the only motive of their
prosecution; Nevertheless where a great Canton of Christendom is rooted in a
contrary opinion, and things in this world are for the most part esteemed by
outward appearance; this Land cannot escape malicious scandals, neithet shall
there be want of Colleges to supply their faction with Seminaries. Therefore
again, and again I say, that if the state of the question were so set that it
were possible by a general execution of the Priests and their Adherents, to
end the controversy, J could in some sort with better will subscribe
thereunto; But seeing J find little hope in that course, J hold it safer to be
ambitious of the victory, which is purchased with less loss of blood, and to
proceed, as Tully teaches his Orator; who when he cannot wholly overthrow his
Adversary, yet ought he to do it in some part, and with all endeavor to
confirm his own party in the best manner that may be.

4. He that forbeareth to sow his ground in expectance of good wind, or a
favorable Moon, commonly has a poor Crop, and a lean Purse; So shall it
fare with this state, if private whisperings of disco^tented persons, that
neverlearnt to speak well, be too nicely regarded; yet ought they not to be
slightly set at naught, lest our credit grow light, even in the Balance of our
dearest friends. The Papasticall Libels inform against us, as if we were
desirous to grow fat with sucking of their Blood, the very walls of their
Seminary College at Rome, are bedawbed with their lying phansies, and in every
corner, the Corner-creepers leave some badge of their malicious spleen against
us, crying out of cruelty and persecution: But if the penalty of death be
changed into a simple indurance of Prison, what moate can they find in our eyes
to pull out; or with what Rhetoric can they defend their obstinate
malipertnesse, which with repaying us ill for good, deserve to have coals of
indignation powered upon their heads, Visne muliebre consilium, said Livia to
Augustus, let severity sleep a while, and try what alteration the pardoning of
Cinna mayprocure; The Emperor harkened to her Counsel, and thereby found his
Enemies mouths stopped, and the malice abated; some there are perchance, that
will term this Clemency, innovation, and vouch the Precedent of that City, who
permitted none to propound new Laws, that had not a Cord about their necks,
ready for vengeance, if it were found voprofitable: But let such Stoyicks know,
that there is great difference between the penning of a new Law, and advise
given for the manner of executing it; neither by their Leaves, are all
Jnnovations to be rejected; For divine Plato teaches us, that in all Common
wealths, upon just grounds, there ought to be some changes; And that Statesmen
therein must behave themselves like skillful Musicians, Qui artem Musices non
mutant, sed musices modum.

5. That an evil weed grows fast, by example of the new Catholics increase
is clearly convinced; But he that will ascribe this generation simply to his
Majesty's Heroical virtue of Clemency, argues out of the fallacy which is
called Ignoratio Elenchi. Was not the zeal of many cooled toward the last end
of Queen Elizabeth's Reign, has not the impertinent heat of some of our own
side bereft us of part of our strength? And the Papacy with tract of time
gotten a hard skin on their Consciences; Parva metu primo, mox sese attollit
in altum: But if we will with a better insight, behold how this great quantity
of Spawne is multiplied, we must especially ascribe the cause thereof to their
Priests, who by their deaths prepare and assure more to their sect, then by
their lives they could ever persuade. It were incivility to distrust a friend,
or one that has the show of an honest man, if he will franckly give his word,
or confirm it with a sacred Oath: But when a protestation is made upon the
least gasp of life, it is of great effect, and possesses those that cannot
gain say it upon their own knowledge. The number of these Priests, which now a
days come to make a Tragical conclusion, is not great; Yet as with one Seal
many Pattents are Sealed, so with the loss of few lives numbers of wavering
spirits may be gained, Sanguis martyrum semen Ecclesiae; And though these
Priests having indeed a disadvantagious cause, are in very deed but counterfeit
Shadows of Martyrs unto a true understanding, yet will they be reputed for
such by those that lay their souls to pawn unto their Doctrine, with whom, if
we list to contend by multitude of voices, we shall be cried down, without all
peradventure; For the gate of their Church is wide, and many there are that
enter thereinto.

6. By diverse means, it is possible to come to one and the selfsame end;
seeing that then the some of our welwishings is all one; Namely that Popish
Priests may have no power to do harm; It is not impertinent to try sundry
paths, which may lead us to the perfecting of our desires. Politicians
distinguish; Inter rempub: constituta^ and rempub: constituend: According to
the several natures whereof, Statists are to dispose of their Counsels and
Ordinances. Were now the Rhemists and Romulists new hatched out of the shell,
the former course of severity might soon bury their opinions with their
persons; But sithence the disease is inveterated, variety of Medicines is
Judiciously to be applied. The Romans did not punish all Crimes of one and the
selfsame nature with extremity of death; For some they condemned to
perpetual Prison, and others they banished into an Island, or some remote
Country, even in the case of Religion, they were very tender to dip their
fingers in Blood; For when Cato was Consul, and it seemed good unto the Senate
to suppress with violence the disordered Ceremony of the Bacchanals, brought
by a strange Priest into the City; He withstood that Sentence, alleging that
there was nothing so apt, to deceive men as Religion; which always presents a
show of Divinity; And for that cause, it behoved to be very wary in chastizing
the professors thereof, lest any indignation should enter into the Peoples
minds, that somewhat was derogated from the Majesty of GOD. Others more
freely, have not spared to place Religion (J mean that Religion which is
ignorantly zealous) amongst the kinds of Frenzy, which is not to be cured
otherwise then by time, given to divert or qualify the fury of the Conceit;

Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum!

Howsoever, in valuing the power of a city, or strength of Arguments, quality,
and worth is to be preferred before number: Nevertheless, where the uttermost
of our force is not known, it imports much to have it conceived, that the
multitude stands for us; for doubts and suspicions cast in an Enemies way,
evermore make things seem greater, and more difficulty tha^ they are indeed;
we have by Gods mercy, the sword of justice drawn on our behalf, which upon
short warning, is able to disunite the secret Underminers of our quiet, we have
a King zealous for the house of the Lord, who needs not to fear less
success in shutting up of Priests, then our late Queen had in restraining them
in Wisbich Castle; where lest their factious spirits should grow rusty, they
converted their Canker to fret upon themselves, and vomiting out gall in
quodlibets, showed that their Disease was chiefly predominant in the spleen.
Whattempests they have raised in their College at Rome, their own books, and
many Travelers can witness; The storm whereof was such, that Sextus Quintus
complained seriously of the vexation, which he received oftener from the English
scholars, then all the Vassals of his Triple Crown. And untruly is the
Magistrate noted of negligence, or overmuch severity, that lays wait to
catch the Foxes, and the little Foxes, which spoil the Vinyard; Though
afterward without further punishment, he reserve them to the day, wherein God
will take account of their Stewardship. For if Aristotle's City defined to be a
society of men, assembled to live well, be the same, which in our Law has
reference to the maintenance of the poor in peace: so long as we taste of the
sweet of a peaceable Government; we cannot say, but that we live well, and that
the City consisting of Men, and not of Walls, is happily guided.

8. An Oath is a weak Band to contain him that will, for pretended Conscience
sake, hold no Faith with Heretics, or by absolution from a Priest, thinks
himself at liberty to fly from any promise, or protestation whatsoever.

Therefore when I remember, that Watsone the Priest, notwithstanding his
invectives against the Jesuits, gained liberty to forge his traiterous
inventions, and had others of his society in the complot: I judge it safer to
make Recluses of them, then to suffer such to dally with us by Books, and some
idle intelligences cast abroad only, as a Mist to bleare our eyes: but how
shall we find the means to apprehend those disguised Romanists, that borrow
the shapes of Captains, Merchants, Gentlemen, Citizens, and a^l sorts of
people, and by equivocation, may deny themselves to be themselves? In answer to
this question, I will first show the Reason, why they are not pursued and
taken, and hereafter make an overture, how they may be boulted out of their
Hutches. The Nature of Man, howsoever in hot blood it be thirsty of revenge; in
a cooler temper, it has a kind of Nausea, as I may call it, or a distaste of
taking away of the lives, even of the Nocent: Insomuch that in all Assizes and
Sessions, an offender can hardly be condemned, whom the foolish pity of many
will not after a sort excuse, with laying some imputations on the Judge, part
on the Jury, and much on the Accuser; and such is their blind affection, that
the Prisoner who, perhaps, was never recommended for handsomnesse, will be
esteemed of them, for one of the properest men in the company: from hence it
comes, that the name of a Sergeant, or a Pursevant is odious, and the
Executioner, although he be the hand of Justice, is esteemed no better then an
Enemy of Mankind, and one that lost honesty and Humanity in his Cradle.
Reverend Master Fox was wont to say, that Spies accusers, where necessary
Members in a Commonwealth, and deserved to be cherished, but for his own part,
he would not be of any of that number, or wish his friends to affect such
impliments, and albeit that the Law permits and commands every man to apprehend
a Fellon; do we not commonly see very many content to stand by and look on,
while others perform that office?

Likewise, it is evident, that if such as are tender of their reputations, be
very scrupulous, personally to arrest men for civil actions of debt, they will
be more unwilling instruments of drawing their bodies to the Rack, or the
Gallows; especially when their is any color of Religion to be pretended in
their defense; The diversity of men's faces is great, but the difference of
their minds in this Case is more variable, wherein the meanest have thought as
free as the highest, besides this, there are too many of the blind Commonalty,
altogether Popish, though not reconciled Papists, who, in their foolish
ignorance, will say, it is pity any should dye for their Conscience, though
indeed they make honorable amends for their Treason; verily I know not, what
misgiving of their mind? it is, that makes men forecast the possibility of
alteration in matters of Religion, and for that respect, they are exceeding
backward, in discovery and laying hands on Seminaries, yea, and are timorous,
in enacting sharp Laws against them, as those that silently say among
themselves, Sors hodierna mihi; cras erit illa tibi: some also survive, who
remember, that in Queen Mary's time, the Protestants alleged a Text, that
the Tares should not be plucked up before Harvest: Nay, shall I speak a Bugges
word; there is no small number, that stand doubtful, whether it be a grateful
work to cross Popery, or that it may be done safely without a soul aspersion
of Puritanisme, or a shrewd turn, for their labors at some times, or other: By
which unhappy ambiguity it comes to pass, that these, Animalia amphibia, the
Priests I mean, that prey on the souls and bodies of either Sex, unattached
revell where they list, though they be no more seen, then a man dancing in a
net. How much fitter were it for us courageously to invite them to our party,
by Preaching, or confuting them by writing, and unto the state wherein we
stand, wisely to apply the exhortation of the Assyrian King to his soldiers,
you are fools (quoth he) if there be any hope in your hearts, to redress
sorrow, by flight, or rather endeavor to make them fly that are the causers
of your grief, assuring your selves, that more perish in flight, then in the
battle, even as many seeking to meet the Papists half way, discomfort our
own party.

9. It follows now, according to the Method prescribed before, that an
overture be made, how to get the Jesuits and their shadows, the Priests into
possession: it has bin heretofore recited, that the unwelcome name of a
Blood-sucker, a Busiebody, or a Puritan has bin shrewd scarecrowes unto many
honest minds, by abrogating therefore of those or such like imputations, many
will be stirred up to undertake the apprehending of the Adversaries unto the
truth: especially, when for their pains and time employed, they shall deserve,
and have the titles of good Patriots, dutiful Subjects, and zealous
Christians: how ready is every common person to carry a Malefactor to the
stokes, rather then to the goal or Execution, and doubtless, they will be no
less forward to attach a Priest when they are assured that the worst of his
punishment shall be a simple restraint within the walls of some old Castle. A
certain kind of People there is, with whom money plays a more forcible Orators
part, then any persuasion of the dutiful service, which they owe to their
Commonwealth: These men will not be negligent to give intelligence, and also
to procure it faithfully provided, that reward may help to line their
threadbare purses, and exempt them from need to sell liberty unto Seminaries:
and where assurance of gain is propounded, for discovery what Master or
Housekeeper will trust his servant with keeping of his Priest, or sleep
quietly while he is engaged to the danger of a Mercenary? I remember, that in
Italy it was often told me, that the bountiful hand of Sir Francis Walsingham,
made his intelligencers so active, that a Seminary could scarcely stir out of
the Gates of Rome, without his privitie: which success, by mediation of Gold,
may as readily be obtained from Sivill, Valcdolid, Doway, Lovaine, Paris, and
other places, and by forewarning given of their approach, they may be waited
for at the Ports, and from thence, soon conveied to a safe Lodging. But whence
shall the stream follow that must feed this bounty? It is a doubt easily
satisfied. If some thousands of pounds out of the Recusants penalties be
reserved in stock, and committed by his Majesty into the disposition of zealous
distributers, who will not be afraid to conclude Perdat fiscus ut capiat
Christus: neither need we seek any further succor to repair decayed Castles,
and therein to defray the charge of the Priests, with a sure guard to keep
them: then the foresaid forfeitures, that by the Justice of the LAW may be
collected: which course, if ever it come happily to be entertained, and that
Recusancy cause to be an ignominous prey to the subjects, the proceedings for
Religion shall be less blamed, and perhaps altogether unjustly accused, by any
graceless, Gretzerus or Cacodaemon, Johannes, tincting their pens in Gall,
and vinegar, For besides occasion of calumniation, given by suites of that
nature, it is evident that many Recusants that would be indicted for the King,
and the effecting of the project aforesaid, shall escape without punishment,
and be borne out against the power of a private person, begging them to no
other purpose, then has heretofore bin used, and albeit the penalty be rated
at xxl a month, yet was it never the Lawmakers intent, that such as was not
able to pay so great a sum, should go scot-free. But that according to the
proportion of their ability, they should do the penance of their purses for
their disobedience; whereas now (if the voice of the People, which is said to
be the voice of God, is to be credited) the poorer sort is skipt over, as if
they ought no souls to God, nor duty to their Sovereign, a poor man, says
one, is to be pitied, if he offend through necessity: but he do amiss
voluntarily, he is more severely to be chastised; forasmuch, as wanting
friends, and means to bear him out, it shows that his fault proceeds from
presumption.

10. Let us now presuppose that all the whole Regiment of Jesuits and
Seminaries, were lodged in safe custody, may we then persuade our selves that
Popery will vanish like a dumb show? I am clearly resolved, that though it
receive a great Eclipse, notwithstanding, without other helps, the Kingdom of
Antichrist will only lie hidden as a weed, that seems withered in winter, and
is ready to sprout out with the Spring. Temporal Arms are Remedies serving
for a time: but the Spiritual sword is permanent in operation, and by an
invisible blow works more then Mortal man can imagine. The word of God
carries this two edged weapon in its mouth, which is to be used by faithful
Ministers of the Church, whom pure zeal, without respect to wordly promotion
or persons, ought to encourage. Of Judges, the Scripture says Estote fortes,
and daily we see that sitting in their judicial seats, God inspireth them
with greater courage, then when, as private Persons, they are to give their
opinions: No less is the power of the holy Ghost in his servants, that out of
the Pulpit are to deliver his Embassage. Let them therefore not be dismayed to
speak out plainly, and tell the truth without running a middle course between
heat and cold. Unprofitable descanting upon the Scripture with an old Postell,
or for want of better matter, waste the poor time shut up in an hour Glass,
with skirmishing against the worthy Pillars of our own profession. Rumor
which is ever ready to take hold of evil, has raised a secret, though (as I
hope) a causeless suspicion; that there should be some secret combination
under hand, by changing the state of Questions, to put us in our old days, to
learn a new Catechism; and when they have brought us out of conceit with the
Reverend Interpreters of the Word, to use us then, as the Wolves (mentioned in
Demosthenes Apology) handled the Shepherds, when they had delivered up their
Dogs. Most sacred was that Speech of our most gracious King concerning
Vorstius; he that will speak of Canaan, let him speak the Language of Canaan.
How can we draw others to our Church; if we cannot agree, where, or how to lay
our Foundation? Or how may we cleanse the Leprous Disease of dissension, which
the Papists, which are least assured to themselves, and most doubtful of their
salvation, are not ashamed to ascribe unto many of us? I would not have
Ministers indiscreet, like Dogs, to bark against all, whether they know, or
know them not. I like better the opinion of Aristotle, who advises those that
stand in guard of a place, to be cursed; only to such as are about to endammage
the City. If Pursevants, and other civil Officers, would learn to keep this
rule, they might go about their business, with much credit. The imagined
fear of inviting the Romish faction, by force to deliver their ghostly Fathers
out of prison, move me not a whit; For I cannot believe, that they esteem them
at so dear a price, that they would run the hazard, by freeing others out of
hold, to put themselves into their places. some will say, that a man of straw
is a head good enough for a discontented Multitude. That the Papists are very
Choleric, it appears sufficiently by their writings: yet it has pleased God
to send those cursed Cowes short horns, that when they could not find a man of
sufficiency to serve their turn, they were feign to do homage to Garnets
straw; forgetful as they are, that such stubble cannot endure the trial of
fire; but unto us, that ought to be doers, as well as Professors of the
Gospel, let this remain as a memorable Theoreme: Religion is the Mother of
good Order; good Order, is the cause of prosperous Fortune, and happy success
in all Counsels, and enterprises; wherefore in what estate soever, their
wants good Order, it is an evident Argument, that Religion goes backward.

11. I have ever held it for a kind of injustice, to omit the execution of mean
laws, made to prevent the effects of idleness, and then to apply main
extremity of the sword, when the proling habit gotten by ye vice comes to
light. No less is the course uncharitable (with par-don for this presumption
be it spoken, when we spare them that have no Religion at all, and censure
those that can give account of somewhat tending to that purpose.

He that is in misery must be borne withal if he speak miserably, and when the
child from his Mothers Breast has sucked nothing but Popery, a man had need to
be angry with discretion, if he hear him speak in the voice of a Papist. God
calls some by miracle; but the ordinary means in his Word: if that means, in
many places of this Land be wanting; of what Religion is it likeliest, the
people will be? I suppose, that few men will gainsay my assertion, that outward
sense will direct them to Popery which is fuller of Pageants, then of
spiritual doctrine. And what is the cause, that after so many years of
preaching of the Gospel, that the common people still retain a sent of the
Roman perfume? The cause is, for that the formal obedience of coming to
Church, has bin more expected, then the instruction of private families;
public Catechizing is of great use, but the first elements thereof are to be
learnt at home: and these, which we learn from our Parents, stick most surely
in our minds. What was the cause why the Spartans continued their government so
many Revolutions of times, without mutations? Histories record, that learning
their Country Customs from their infancy, they would not be induced to alter
them; And in this our native soil, we perceive that the common Laws which
rely on ancient Customs, are better observed then late Statutes of what worth
soever they be: so does it fare with the poor People, which being once
seasoned with the old Dregs of Papisme, will hardly be drawn from it: till the
Learning of the true Faith be grown to a Custom. I will prescribe no order of
aff^ires, to effect this; But I suppose, that the ancient laudable course by
the Bishops confirmation, will not be sufficient to fulfill so great a task;
the Ministers must and ought, to be the principal and immediate hands to give
assistance to so gracious a work, and in case, any be defective in their duty,
the Reverend Bishops may take notice thereof in their Visitations.

Perhaps it will be thought a hard task to constrain old People to learn the
A. B. C. of their Christian Belief. But how hard soever it be, I hold it no
incivility to prepare people of all Ages for the Kingdom of heaven. By the
order contained in the Book of Common prayer, on Sundays and Holidayes, half
an hour before the Evensong, the Curate of every Parish ought to examine
Children sent unto him in some points of the Catechism, and all Fathers,
Mothers, Masters, and Dames should cause their Children, Apprentises, and
servants, to resort unto Church, at the time appointed: There obediently to
hear, and be ordered by the Cutate; until such time, as they have learnt all
that in the said Book is commanded: And when the Bishop shall appoint the
Children to be brought before him, for their confirmation, the Curate of every
Parish shall send or bring in writing, the names of those Children of his
Parish, which can answer to the Questions of the Catechism; and there ought
none to be admitted to the Holy Communion, until such time as he can say his
Catechism, and be confirmed: many times I have stood amazed, to behold the
magnificence of our Ancestors Buildings, which their Successors as this day are
not able to keep up; But when J cast mine eyes upon this excellent Foundation:
laid by the grave Fathers of the Church, and perceive their children neglect to
build thereupon: with exceeding marvel, I rest almost besides my self. For
never was their better Ground-plots laid, which has bin seconded with less
success. It was not the hanging up of the Bull of Pius Quintus on the Bishop
of Londons doors, or the forbearing to hang up Priests, that has wrought this
Apostasy: but the idleness, and insufficiency of many Teachers, conspiring
with the Peoples cold zeal, that has bin the contriver of this unhappy Web.
Until the xith. year of Queen Elizabeth's Reign, a Recusants name was
scarcely known: The reason was, because that the zeal, begotten in the time
of the Marian persecution, were yet fresh in memory; And the late Persecutors
wat so amazed with the sudden alteration of Religion, that they could not
choose but say Digitus Dei est hic. In those days, there was an emulation
between the Clergy and the Laity: and a strife arose, whether of them should
show themselves most affectionate to the Gospel; Ministers hanted the houses
of worthiest men, where Jesuits now build their Tabernacles; and poor Country
Churches were frequented with the best in the Shire. The Word of GOD was
precious, Prayer and Preaching went hand in hand together: until Archbishop
Grindals disgrace, and Hatfields hard conceit of prophesying, brought the
flowing of these good graces to a still water: The name of a Papist smelt
rank, even in their own Nostrills, and for pure shame to be accounted such,
they resorted duly, both to our Churches and exercises: But when they saw their
great Coriphaeus Sanders had slily pinned the name of Puritans, upon the
sleeves of Protestants, that encountered them with most courage, and perceived
that the word was pleasing to some of our own side, they took heart agrace to
set little by the service of God, and duty to their Sovereign, therewith start up
from among us, some that might have bin recommended for their zeal, if it had
bin tempered with discretion, who fore-running the authority of the Magistrate,
took upon them in sundry places and publicly to censure, whatsoever agreed not
with their private conceits, with which cross humors vented in Pulpits and
Pamphlets, most men grieve to be frozen in zeal, and in such sort benumbed,
that whosoever ( as the worthy Lord Keeper Bacon observed in those days)
pretended a little spark of earnestness, be seemed no less then red fire,
hot in comparison of the other; And as some things fare the worse, for an ill
Neighbors sake, dwelling beside them, so did it betide the Protestant, who
seeking to curb the Papist, or reprove an idle Droane, was incontinently
branded, with the ignominous note of a Precisian. All which wind, brought
plenty of water to the Popes Mill, and there will most men grind, where they
see appearance to be well served.

12. If without great inconvenience the children of Papists could be brought up
out of their company, it were a happy turn: But I find it to be full of
difficulty; There is provision made to avoid Popish Schoolmasters, but there
is no ward against Popish Schoolemistresses, that infect the silly Infants
while they carry them in their Arms, which moves me to suppose that the
former proposition to examine how Children and servants are brought up; and
truly to certify the list of the Communicants, and Recusants, will be the
readiest means to let his Majesty know the yearly increase or decrease of the
church in every Diocese: And whosoever shall send his children, or any of his
Majesty's subjects, to be placed in Monasteries, or Seminary Colleges, or
Popishly to be brought up in sorraine parts: I think that for punishment both
the one and the other, worthily might be disfranchised of the privileges, due
to natural Englishmen; so far-forth, as any good by the Laws may descend to
them: But not to be exempted from the penalties thereof; or the Regal
jurisdiction of the Crown. J know well that contradiction is odious, and makes
a man seem ambitious, to be thought more understanding then others. In which
case, the Spanyard uses only to term him presumptuous, whom he would call
Fool, if civility would bear it. But in my defense, I hope it shall suffice
again, to revive my former protestation, that Idiscourse by the way of
proposition, rather then Arrogance of defining any thing: with pardon
therefore, may I be permitted to say. That the first easy Law of xijd.
inflicted on him that could not give a reasonable excuse, for his absence from
Church or Sundays, was one of the best Ordinances, that has hitherto bin
enacted. But while we sought to make new Statutes, savouring of more severity,
we neglected the old, and were loath to execute the new: For it is a certain
Rule, that whosoever in policy will give liberty, and yet seem to suppress a
crime, let him procure sharp Laws to be proclaimed, which are only necessary
for some times, and rare occasions to be put in Execution; but not to be an
ordinary work, for every day of the Week. Daily use likewise teaches us,
that it is less grievous to punish by an old Law, then by a new: For So Much, as
Truth it self, seldom gets credit without proof, and it is hard to free the
people of suspicion, that new Laws are not rather invented against the
particular persons and purses of men, then against the corrupt manners. By
force of which reason, I am induced to conceive that the old use of the Church,
contained in good nurture, and Ecclesiastical censures will much more prevail
to muzzell Popery, then any fresh devises whatsoever. Neither do J think it
blameworthy, to affirm that our cause has taken harm, by relying more on
the Temporal, then the Spiritual Arms. For while we trusted that Capital
punishments should strike the stroke; we have neglected the means, which
would, for the most part, have discharged the need of such severity. The Oath
of Allegiance is not offered generally, to servants and mean People; who if
they had taken the Oath by absolution of a Priest, might recoyle from it, or
change their opinion at leisure, without any ready means to discover their
Leger-demaine: that Oath I fear will not be often pressed, and to them that
shift from place to place, how can it be tendered? The principal Papists now
cover themselves, in the crowde of the multitude: but if we can discover the
affection of the multitude, they easily will be unmasked, and being singled
out, rest ashamed of their nakedness; which under correction of better
judgment, may be effected, if every new commer, to inhabit in a Town, and
servants newly entertained within a Week, or xiiij. days, be caused to
repair to the Minister, there in presence of the Churchwardens, and other
honest men; to subscribe unto such brief and substantial Articles concerning
Faith, and Allegiance, as shall be according to Gods Word, and Justice,
ordained to distinguish the sheep from the Goats. In foreign Countries,
every Host is bound to bring his Guest before an Officer; there to certify his
name, with the occasion of his coming, andintended time of his abode in those
parts; and in case he stay longer, he must again renew his License, so curious
and vigilant: also are they to keep their Cities from infection, that without
a Certificate, witnessing their coming from wholesome places, they may not
escape the Lazeretto. No less ought we to be watchful to prevent the
contagion of our Souls, then other Nations are of their bodies, every thing is
hard, and scarcely pleasing in the beginning: But with time, some such course
may be readily put in Execution: which I propound rather as matter for better
heads, to work on; then peremptorily to be insisted on in the same Terms.

But lest any charge me with Temerity; that when I desire to know the
multitudes inclination, by the means aforesaid: I satisfy my self with their
Parrots Language, pronouncing it knows not what: I think it not impertinent,
to put them in mind, that heretofore I have required instructions, both
precedent and subsequent; and am ever of the mind, that though all this cannot
be done at once; yet it is necessary always to be doing our best: knowing,
that not to go forwards in Religion, is the ready way to go backwards. It is
not the outward obedience of coming to Church, that discovers the inward
thought of the heart: it is the confession of the Tongue that must utter these
secrets. And where the Curates are insufficient, or the Parish great, I wish
they had Catechistes to assist them, maintained by the Purses of the Recusants:
which Pension being collected for Gods cause, will free us of scandal; though
it grieve them to pay the spiritual Army, waged against their own Stratagems:
surely by giving them way in petty matters, they are grown to be very
masterfull in their party: Plato affirms, that the Popular state proceeded
from the License, which the people took to make immoderate Applauses in the
Theaters: when, as by arrogating that immunity, without contro ement, in place
of their Governors, and perceiving the Nobility to join with them in the same
passions, they thought their Heads as worthy to govern, as any of those that
were made out of the selfsame mould: In like manner, while we suffer
ignorance openly to maintain such petty glimpses of Popery, as are thought to
be scarce worthy, to be looked at, and in small matters run an indifferent
course, which neither make sure friends, nor feeble Foes; unawares they take
the bridle from us, and eat out Religion, as it were by an insensible Gangrena.

Principiis obsta, sero, medicina paratur.
Cum malaper longas convaluere moras.
For by sufferance of breaking smaller Laws, People are emboldned to set the
greater at naught.

To comprehend all things in a Law, which are necessary to the Reformation, I
neither hold it profitable nor expedient; yet it is discretion to provide for
the most important: smaller matters, whereof the Laws speak not, are to be
commended to the discretion of Parents, Masters, and other reverent persons,
who by example and advice, may prepare younglings, by education and custom, to
obey the Laws: especially such as are in high place ought, in this behalf, to
be like Caesar's Wife. Non solum crimine, sed etiam criminis suspitione vacare,
and with circumspection to behave themselves; that the world may conceive, in
requiring obedience to God and their Sovereign, that they hold the multitude
rather for companions, then slaves: if great men take another way, they may
seduce many by example; though by Words they express not their concealed
opinions; Tace and loquere, said God to Moses, it is the speech of the heart,
which utters more then words and syllables: And in our common Laws, it is held
maintenance, when a great Personage, only by his presence countenanceth a
cause. Neither let us secure our selves with this Argument: the Papists are
pliable in small matters, ergo, they will yield in greater; And because they
took no Arms in 88. therefore it were needless curiosity to suspect them
now: for who knows not, that small baits are used to take the greatest Fish,
vt cum esca una etiam hamus devoretur. Wariness is the sinews of Wisdom, and
nothing is more dangerous, then to be secure in matters of State: Therefore for
the Laws already made, I wish that the most effectual of them, which least
concerns life, may be executed; For better it were not to make them, then by
neglect to set them at liberty; seeing that many offenses there are, which men
would abstain from, if they were forbidden, but when a strict commandment is
avoided without punishment, therout springs an unbridled License, hardly to be
reformed by any rigor.

To conclude, I say freely, that who so ends his days by a natural death,
he shall be subject to receive many men's doomes, for every particular offense;
But when for Religions sake, a man triumphs over the sword, that one eminent
virtue razeth out the memory of other errors, and places him, that so dies,
in Paradise; if common opinion may be lawfully vouched; which glory having many
followers, and admirers, awaketh even dull spirits to affect their footesteps,
and to sell their lives, for the maintenance of the same cause: J need not envy
the name of a Martyr to the Jesuit; for his cause if it be rightly weighed,
will blanch that title: but I desire to have all those Lineaments defaced,
which may compound that counterfeit Image, in prosecuting of which purpose, if
J have failed in my advice, and by confused handling intricated the question, J
humbly request, that a wise man's verdit, may mitigate the heavines of yt
censure. It is neither good to praise bad Counsels, because of their good
success; nor to condemn good Counsels, if the Events prove not fortunate;
lest many be animated, to advise rashly, and others dishartned, to counsel
gravely.

Illi mors gravis incubat,
Qui notus nimis omnibus,
Ignotus moritur sibi.
Senec. Trag.
