A PROCLAMATION For Taking off the late Restraint Laid upon the Ships of
Merchants and others from going to Sea.
CHARLES R.

HIs Majesty by His Order made in Council upon the Seventh day of February
last, having laid a general Imbargo upon all Ships Trading from this Kingdom in
such manner as is therein Declared; And having also since that time Declared
His further Pleasure, That no Passes or Protections for Ships, formerly granted
by his Royal Highness, should be of any force or effect; Is now Graciously
pleased to take off the said Restraint; And has therefore thought fit by
Advice of His Privy Council to Publish this His Royal Proclamation, hereby
Declaring, That it shall and may be lawful to and for all and every of His
Majesty's Loving Subjects, as well Merchants as others, to Set out any Ships to
Sea, and to carry on their Trade and Commerce as fully and amply as they could
or might have done, if no such Restraint or Imbargo had been made; Any thing in
such Restraint contained to the contrary notwithstanding. And His Majesty is
further pleased to Declare, That all Passes and Protections for Ships and
Mariners, formerly Granted by His Royal Highness Lord High Admiral of England,
or hereafter to be Granted, shall be of as full Force and Effect, to all the
intents and purposes therein contained, as the same could have been, if no such
Imbargo had ever happened; Any former Declaration of His Majesty's Pleasure to
the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

Given at His Majesty's Court at Whitehall this Two and twentieth day of May,
in the Twenty fourth year of His Majesty's Reign.
