A PROCLAMATION For the Free Exportation of Woollen Manufactures until the 25th
day of December next.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, taking into His Princely consideration, the
deadness of Trade in Cloth, and other Woollen Manufactures of this Kingdom, by
reason of the present War, and late dreadful Contagion, and that great
quantities of Woollen Clothes do at present lie upon the hands of many poor
Clothiers; His Majesty therefore out of His Clemency and tender Compassion to
the necessities of His Subjects, does by the Advice of His Privy Council, and
with the free consent of the Company of Merchant-Adventurers of England, hereby
give free Liberty and License to all and every person and persons whatsoever,
as well Natives and Denizens, as Strangers and Foreiners, from the day of the
Date hereof, until the Five and twentieth day of December next, to Transport
and Carry out of this Kingdom, all Woollen Manufactures whatsoever, to any Port
or place beyond the Seas, lying within the Limits and Bounds of the said
Merchant-Adventurers Patent. (Except the Mart Towns of Dort and Hamburgh) Yet
His Majesty would not hereby be thought to have a light esteem of the Services
of that Company to Himself, and the Crown in former times, nor of their
usefulness toward the Advance and Increase of the Trade of this Kingdom; nor
does His Majesty by this Temporary Dispensation intend to lessen the Authority
of their Charter, as to the Government of that Society, either at home or
abroad. And His Majesty does hereby Require and Command, That during the time
of this License and Dispensation, due Payment be made of all Duties for
Licensing the Exportation of White Clothes, according to former use and
practice.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the 15th day of April, 1666. in the 18th year
of Our Reign.
